[[*user DianaBerry]]\n\nThis article contains mentions of loneliness and depression. Also contains mentions of non serious suicidal ideation. (ie: ‘I’m gonna kill my self’) jokes.\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:info-cw]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-8094\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation Web Crawler Delta-441 (\"MACAROON”) is to search the web for all mentions of SCP-8094 and is to download them onto a secure hard drive. SCP-8094 is currently separated from the general public and is being held on Foundation intranet. A disinformation campaign has been set up to pass SCP-8094 off as an ‘Alternate Reality Game’ or ‘ARG’ that has ended. An account posing as the person who ran this ‘ARG’ is to be run by the Site-83 SCP-8094 containment team, and should be kept up with daily.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8094 refers to a blog on the social media site ‘Tumblr’ under the name of ‘Macaroon-Creamxx’ or 'Marina Hodgkins' which depicts the life of a subject from an unknown dimension. SCP-8094 has depicted celebrities, people, fictional media, places, etc that do not exist in baseline reality. SCP-8094 has shown the capability to find other posts that line up with its apparent reality and has reposted them to its blog, but upon further inspection no blog hosting these posts have been found to exist, most likely due to essogenic stability failures. \n\nSCP-8094 has been tested by the Foundation and has been proven to not be artificial intelligence. The posts on SCP-8094 are being uploaded in real time. SCP-8094 has been traced to an IP address; however, it was never traced to an actual device.\n\nWhile SCP-8094 claims to have access to the world and web outside of ‘Tumblr,’ SCP-8094 can only be contacted through the website.\n\nA team of multi-dimensional experts has been consulted to attempt to find a reality that lines up with what has been mentioned to exist in SCP-8094’s reality. However, no such reality has been discovered to date. SCP-8094's reality appears to have once existed, but SCP-8094 is seemingly the only source of life that remains.\n\n\n**Addendum-1:** SCP-8094 posts \n\nThe following is a collection of posts made by SCP-8094 before its discovery by the Foundation. It is of note that while SCP-8094’s posts appear on different days for any onlooker, SCP-8094 has confirmed that the day remains February 18th for it.\n\n[[div class=\"tumblrbox\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding-bottom:15px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/alone-with-myself/mac style=\"width:32px;height:32px\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding-left:8px;\"]]\n**Macaroon-Creamxx**\n[[span class=\"postdate\"]]Feb 10, 2021[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n\nSo the new episode amiright \n \n\n[[div class=\"tagges\"]]\n#Angels Reborn @@ @@ #im literally screaming rn @@ @@ #macaroon speaks\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notas\"]]\n[[div class=\"notasub\"]]\n**15** ##5f5f5f|notes##\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"tumblrbox\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding-bottom:15px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/alone-with-myself/mac style=\"width:32px;height:32px\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding-left:8px;\"]]\n**Macaroon-Creamxx**\n[[span class=\"postdate\"]]Feb 12, 2021[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n\n\nI need to work on some art I’ve just been so lazy, work has been a bitch too\n\n[[div class=\"tagges\"]]\n#marcaroon speaks  @@ @@ #kill me  @@ @@ \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notas\"]]\n[[div class=\"notasub\"]]\n**6** ##5f5f5f|notes##\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"tumblrbox\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding-bottom:15px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/alone-with-myself/mac style=\"width:32px;height:32px\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding-left:8px;\"]]\n**Macaroon-Creamxx**\n[[span class=\"postdate\"]]Feb 13, 2021[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n\nGreat so I’m out of my anti depressants \n \n\n[[div class=\"tagges\"]]\n#Im a mess@@ @@ #i should probably order some more but I don’t feel like leaving the house  @@ @@ #macaroon speaks\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notas\"]]\n[[div class=\"notasub\"]]\n**4** ##5f5f5f|notes##\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"tumblrbox\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding-bottom:15px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/alone-with-myself/mac style=\"width:32px;height:32px\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding-left:8px;\"]]\n**Macaroon-Creamxx**\n[[span class=\"postdate\"]]Feb 14, 2021[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n\nliterally why does Zander’s food taste like ass \n\n[[div class=\"tagges\"]]\n#I hate their chicken so much @@ @@ #I prefer Lanaly’s chicken  @@ @@ # is tumblr the place to rant about fast food?

As SCP-8094 does not require basic nutrients, no meal plan has been given. SCP-8094 is to undergo weekly therapy with Denna Caplin, Site-58's resident therapist. \n\nSCP-8094 has requested a collection of different materials, which are as follows:\n\n* A television (Granted, which programs are allowed are to be moderated by the SCP-8094 containment team)\n* A digital art tablet (Denied)\n* Traditional art supplies such as sketch books and markers (Granted)\n* Anime figurines for room decoration (Granted, but are to be kept in a locked glass case)\n* A pet of some sort (Denied)\n* Stuffed animals (Granted)\n* More personalized clothing items (Under review)\n* A cellphone (Denied)\n* The ability to converse with Researcher Rosie Machin. (Granted, at least 2 times a month, depending on Research Machin's schedule.)\n\n**Description:** SCP-8094 refers to female 26-year-old Marina Hodgkins, a human extracted from a remote alternative reality, which was undergoing a ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario. SCP-8094 exhibits low Hume levels, and as such only some metabolic functions persist: it does not need to eat, drink, sleep, or expel waste; however, it can still experience mild symptoms of sleep deprivation.\n\nSCP-8094 was first discovered on the social media site 'Tumblr' when its account anomalously contacted our reality. Mentions of people, locations, and franchises that do not exist alerted the Foundation to its existence.\n\nInference from its posts and mutual conversation through 'Private Messages' implied its universe's state of reality failure. In an effort to preserve the object, a Mobile Task Force was assembled to locate the object and extract it. On visual contact, SCP-8094 was unconscious at the center of a 2-kilometer bubble of elevated Hume levels in the interstitial space of the multiverse- all that remained of SCP-8094's dimension. The object revitalized on return to baseline reality.\n\nResearch into the destruction of SCP-8094's reality is currently ongoing.\n\n**Addendum-1:** Therapist Log\n\nThe following is a log from Doctor Caplin of her first therapy session with SCP-8094, recorded on 04/10/2021, around a month after SCP-8094 was first acquired by the Foundation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-8094\n\n**Interviewer:** Doctor Denna Caplin\n\n------\n\n<Start Log>\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Hello, Marina. I'm Doctor Caplin, I'll be your therapist for the foreseeable future. \n\n**SCP-8094:** You’re a lot more formal than my old therapist. I shouldn’t have stopped seeing her. I don’t know why I did. Depression is such a weak excuse to stop therapy.\n\n//SCP-8094 sighs.//\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** I hear you, it's hard to feel motivated. Coming here is a step in the right direction. Many of my clients suffer from depression, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n**SCP-8094:** Well, I haven’t done much since I got here. I mean I used to just be a normal person. Now I’m what, a test subject? With no one to talk to but scientists for the rest of my life? You may be nice, but you’re not my friends.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:**  Sudden change can make us feel anxious. You must be terrified. I promise, I'll support you throughout your stay. We can start with-\n\n**SCP-8094:** I want my world back.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** I'm sorry, Marina. We haven't found any way to recover your reality.\n\n**SCP-8094:** Of course. I just… hate that everything's gone forever, except me. Why me? Why did the universe choose me? It doesn’t make any sense. I’m not anyone special. I worked on graphic design from home, I used to take Prozac, God… Why not a politician or a scientist or someone that could actually make an impact here?\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** We don't know anything yet. We’re lucky we were able to track it down and find you.\n\n//SCP-8094 and Doctor Caplin sit in silence. After a minute, SCP-8094 speaks again.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** I like the anime you have here. \n\n**Doctor Caplin:** I’ve never watched anime. You can tell me about it.\n\n**SCP-8094:** It's good but it makes me miss Angels Reborn. At least I remember what Amily looked like, so I can still draw her. But that’s the only way I’m going to see my baby again. I know I’m a freak for referring to a fictional character that way. You’re probably not used to it.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** I don’t interact with a lot of spaces like that, no. But I don't think less of you for liking a character.\n\n**SCP-8094:** It doesn’t matter. It’s not like I’ll be able to watch it again.\n\n//SCP-8094 throws its head back.// \n\n**SCP-8094:** What else could you want me to say? My depression has gotten worse. I’ll never be able to eat my favorite foods again because I don’t need to eat. I’ll never see any of my favorite shows again. My family. My friends-- Hell, I’ll never even be able to work again! And you’re all just fine with this? ‘There’s nothing we can do’ I know, I know! \n\n**Doctor Caplin:** I’m sorry, Marina.\n\n**SCP-8094:** You’re not though! You’re just saying that!\n\n//SCP-8094 stomps its foot.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** But I get it. There’s not another choice. I’ll be fine.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Marina, I care about your well-being. I'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible here once you let me.\n\n//SCP-8094 pauses.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** Um... can I have a pink bunny plush? You've given me some stuffed animals, but none like that.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Of course, that can be arranged. May I ask why you want a pink bunny in particular?\n\n**SCP-8094:** Oh, because I used to have one like it. Back in my world. Her name was Lucy. I've had her since I was like, 15. \n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Tell me more about that.\n\n//SCP-8094 slightly smiles.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** Oh, okay.\n\n//SCP-8094 shuffles its feet.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** Well, back when I had real life friends, when I was like 15, it was my birthday, right? I was with Angela, this girl I had a crush on, and had for like forever. \n\n//SCP-8094 laughs.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** I wanted to go to the arcade for my birthday. A few different friends went with me. But it meant a lot Angela was there. After we ate cake and stuff, and it was time to open presents, she realized she had left her gift for me at home. She felt //super// bad, but I was like 'no it's okay!' And she was like 'no it's not okay.' And insisted she win something for me at one of the like, game machine thingys. Once I saw Lucy, I knew I //had// to have her. I love pink, and I love bunnies! We only had enough money for so many tokens. We //both// spent all our money on it because we were 15 and broke L-O-L. \n\n//SCP-8094 laughs again.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** On the 16th try, our 16th token, she did it. Winning Lucy for me. We were so happy we hugged and I was //so// embarrassed. I was a little baby lesbian! But anyway, 16 has sorta been my lucky number ever since. Even though she moved away, I still liked to keep Lucy with me as a reminder of her. I wish we still talked but it was so long ago. Oh! That does remind me of another story-\n\n//SCP-8094 pauses.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** But it's not like it matters... they're all gone. Angela, my parents, Lucy, everyone and everything I ever loved. I sorta forgot that for a sec. \n\n//SCP-8094 moves its hand to wipe a tear from its eye.//\n\n**SCP-8094:** I guess I sorta like the feeling of pretending they're still here.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** It's valid to want to hold onto what you've lost. We can get you a pink bunny plush. \n\n**SCP-8094:** Thank you. I just... I feel so //stupid// for not appreciating what I had more. \n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Marina, if you ever want to talk about your home dimension, I'll let you speak out to your heart's content. \n\n**SCP-8094:** I appreciate it. Um... can I go back to my room now? I'm tired, Caplin.\n\n**Doctor Caplin:** Of course. I'll see you next week.\n\n**SCP-8094:** See you... next week.\n\n<End Log>\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8093]]] | SCP-8094 | [[[SCP-8095]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** mac\n> **Author:** [[*user DianaBerry]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/alone-with-myself/mac\n\n> **Filename:** marina\n> **Name:** Father of Lies.jpg\n> **Author:** Father of Lies\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Father_of_Lies.jpg\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
