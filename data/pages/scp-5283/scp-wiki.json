Seriously. I have tried everything. Manpower. Blades. Saws. Fire - no, you do not need to remind me of how big of a failure that was. Detonation charges. I even spent over an hour shouting at the damn thing! No matter what I do, it doesn't budge. Nothing! I feel like I'm going insane. I've become a laughingstock here. The guy who \"can't even move a nerf dart.\" It's degrading.\n\nIf you have any ideas, I'd //love// to hear them. Because I am this fucking close to submitting my resignation letter.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Researcher Harbor Wilson (wilson_h@secure.scipnet)\n**From:** Senior Researcher Rebecca Larson (larson_r@secure.scipnet)\n**Subject:** RE: THE DAMN NERF DART\n[[/div]]\n------\nHave you tried asking it nicely?\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this email correspondence, Dr. Wilson was seen walking into Site-37's central cafeteria while muttering the phrase \"What kind of bullshit idea is that?\" He then reportedly walked over to SCP-5283 and asked, \"Can you please get off of the ceiling, SCP-5283?\" He was immediately met with the laughter of most nearby staff - much to Wilson's seeming embarrassment - though it ceased moments later when SCP-5283 seemingly obliged the request, falling from the ceiling. Since its removal, all anomalous effects have ceased and SCP-5283 has been reclassified as \"Neutralized.\"\n\nDr. Wilson has since started seeing a Foundation therapist.\n\n[[div style=\"display: none;\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
