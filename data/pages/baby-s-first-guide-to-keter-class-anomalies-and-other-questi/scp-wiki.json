The aforementioned hard drive has since been confiscated by security personnel and delivered to the Site Director's office in order to be searched for any additional information constituting a breach of sensitive material pertaining to objects Dr. ███████'s clearance level and project assignments do not involve. Dr. ███████ has since been transferred to Site-██ for questioning as of 12/██/15. Investigations as to the intended recipient of these documents are ongoing.//\n\n//- Dr. ████ █████████, current assistant director of information security, 17:32 12/23/15//\n\n[[image title_page.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_1.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_2.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_3.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_4.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_5.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n[[image page_6.PNG style=\"display: block; border: solid 1px #666; box-shadow: 0 1px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.25); width: 640px; margin: 0 auto;\"]]\n\n//In addition to these images, the following .txt file was found saved as qwerty12345.txt in the same folder (named \"kids_book\") on the hard drive, along with the seven .png files shown above and .psd Photoshop document containing the original text and artwork://\n\n> //Hey honey,//\n>   \n> //In the midst of all this stress, I was thinking I could spare three hours to make this for us. I probably couldn't, but I did it anyway, as you can see. Yes, I have no idea how to write poetry, but I tried. Anyway, I'm afraid I can't bring it by you because that'd be a bit of a red flag, but this note will (hopefully) prove I'm not procrastinating as much as you say I tend to when I give it to you once we're out of here and the baby's out of you! Which we will be! Out of here, I mean! Very soon! Just sit tight down there while I get the last of everything straightened out. You'll know I mean it when I give you this note and the book later. I promise!//\n>  \n> Love,\n> ████\n\n[[=]]\n,,[[[scp-2708|continue ▶]]],,\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Cyantreuse]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** All of the files present on this page\n> **Author:** Cyantreuse\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
