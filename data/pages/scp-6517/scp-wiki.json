The current containment protocols are only aimed at keeping public awareness of SCP-6517 outside the scope of the paranormal world. SCP-6517 will be monitored by Foundation-filed agents embedded in the French police and tourist guides. Any abnormal behaviors shown by SCP-6517 must be reported to the project research head immediately.\n\nIn the event that an SCP-6517-B instance appears in an urban area, field agents will be deployed to control and assess the situation. The Foundation's Department of External Affairs will work with the local government in the area where the SCP-6517-B instance has appeared to cover up the event with an appropriate story. This cover story will involve tourism purposes, allowing civilians to approach it as much as the circumstances permit.\n\n Foundation web crawlers are to scan and remove any mentions regarding knowledge about SCP-6517 or its anomalous properties from the internet.\n\n**Update:** Foundation agents are prohibited from engaging in aggressive or hostile actions against SCP-6517 or any of its instances to avoid provoking a hostile reaction from SCP-6517.\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/Eiffel%20tower|caption=SCP-6517.|width=140px]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6517 refers to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. It is unknown when or how the Eiffel Tower acquired its anomalous properties. The examination of the tower's original blueprints and construction records did not reveal the use of any anomalous materials or occult engineering associated with the structure. The analysis of samples taken from SCP-6517 revealed that the entire structure is composed of organic material of unknown origin, resembling metal in both appearance and composition.[[footnote]]Similar to what we can see with [[[SCP-217]]] instances.[[/footnote]] The analysis also showed a match with the DNA profile of **[REDACTED]**, though the tests were inconclusive.\n\nSCP-6517 possesses a network of metallic roots that extend underground through the tower's four bases and continue to grow and expand in a manner similar to non-anomalous tree roots. The total length of these roots is unknown, but laser imaging has shown that they may extend at least 4 km deep underground and horizontally span to more than 80,000 km.[[footnote]]It is unknown where SCP-6517 gets the required materials for its expansion. It is currently hypothesized that SCP-6517 absorbs materials from its surroundings like a plant.[[/footnote]] Often, these roots will begin to resurface and breach the earth in or near urban areas around the world, and will then start to grow in size and intertwine with each other. When this occurs, an instance of SCP-6517-B will be created. \n\nSCP-6517-B are near-identical replicas of the Eiffel Tower. These replicas exhibit some deviations from the original tower, including but not limited to differences in size and height to decorative details, and can in shape range from a simplified version of SCP-6517 to an exact one-to-one replica. It was later discovered that SCP-6517-B instances emit a memetic effect that causes human viewers to ignore the abnormal and sudden appearance of the tower, leading them to believe that the tower has always existed in its current location.[[footnote]]This effect will be neutralized if the observer is already aware of the SCP-6517 anomalous characteristics.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/Las%20Vigas|caption=SCP-6517-B-05 instance in Las Vegas.|width=60px]]\n\nDue to a notable increase in the frequency of SCP-6517-B instances creation since the 1980s, to the present day. Project researchers speculate the potential of an EFK-class end-of-world scenario. According to this theory, SCP-6517-B instances will proliferate rapidly in urban areas worldwide, concentrating in dense clusters. As a result, the growth of these structures will displace surrounding human infrastructure, eventually rendering civilian life within cities and urban zones impossible.\n\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Addendum-6517-01: Documented historical references\" hide=\"- Addendum-6517-01: Documented historical references\"]]\n\n**Document-6517-06-023:** The following documents have been collected from Maurice Koechlin's memoirs, which are believed to be responsible for creating the Eiffel Tower's original blueprint.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n07 May, 1884\n@@@@\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/blueprint|caption=Original Eiffel Tower blueprint that was found with journal. Drawn by Maurice Koechlin.|width=70px]]\nFinally, after a long evening of planning, erasing, and drawing, I now have in my possession the blueprint of the tower that I discussed with Émile. While the drawing itself was not the most challenging part, trying to simplify our ideas about the tower's design on paper was harder to conceptualize. Since the announcement of the Exposition Universelle[[footnote]]1889 Paris Exposition, was a world's fair held from 6 May to 31 October 1889.[[/footnote]] design competition, Émile and I have spent days deciding what we would present to Mr. Eiffel for the competition. Our ideas have finally come together, and we have settled on this model to work with. A great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals. \n@@@@ \n@@@@\nDespite Émile's and my optimism about the design, convincing Mr. Eiffel is another matter entirely. Eiffel's company is one of the most prestigious architectural firms, with many engineering marvels bearing our name in France and around the world. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Eiffel remains cautious about the initial concept.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n09 May, 1884\n@@@@\nWe have already presented the tower's design to Mr. Eiffel, and I must say, I did not expect him to express such enthusiasm for the initial concept. This is a good sign, but of course, he wasn't entirely satisfied with my drawing. He requested more decretive details and improvements before approving the plan. Perhaps I can come up with something new if I brainstorm a bit with Émile.\n@@@@\n18 May, 1884\n@@@@\nA few days ago, Émile introduced me to a man named Mr. Jean Barsan. He told me that Barsan is an old acquaintance of his, and an architectural artist, and believes he has some ideas that could add some architectural embellishments to the tower's exterior. While I am not opposed to a fellow architect sharing his artistic vision with us, I can't shake the feeling that something about this man is unsettling. His smile alone gives me a sense of discomfort. I don't want to seem rude in front of Émile's friend, and I can't quite pinpoint what's wrong with me. Mr. Barsan seems like a pleasant person overall—I'm probably just anxious about the project.\n@@@@\n@@@@\nIt worked! Mr. Barsan added decorative arches to the base, a glass pavilion to the first level, and the cupola at the top to our design, and it appears that this was enough for Mr. Eiffel to approve it. We've sold the patent, and everything is going smoothly. It seems I was just being paranoid because of the tower.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n15 February, 1888\n@@@@\nThis is truly a sad day for the world of modern architecture. Today, we were informed that Mr. Eiffel, following the trial related to the Panama scandal, has resigned from his position as head of the company and announced his intention to sever ties with the institutions bearing his name. I also received a telegram notifying me of my appointment as Director of Management. At the very least, I can ensure that the tower will be constructed as planned.\n@@@@\nWhen I met Mr. Barsan this evening at the tower’s construction site, he said to me, \"It is truly unfortunate to lose a colleague with the experience and creativity of Gustave, but we can't keep flogging a dead horse. After all, the French Empire wasn’t built without sacrificing some brave soldiers in the pursuit of spreading French values.\" While I admire Jean's dedication to the project, it seems to me that his patriotist spirit occasionally causes him to lose sight of the real goal. I fail to see how Mr. Eiffel's resignation adds any value to the tower. If anything, it only makes the situation more challenging.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n31 March, 1889\n@@@@\nIt’s finally here. I’m writing this as I stand before the tower, after all these years of waiting. The 1889 Exposition is witnessing the greatest masterpiece French architecture has ever produced. This colossal 300-meter tower stands tall in the heart of the capital, just as I envisioned it. I couldn’t care less about the criticisms of those whining children who lost to our concept. Anyone can critique, but not everyone can create something of equal grandeur. “I’m glad the view of the capital from the top was worth all the effort,” Émile told me when we reached the summit. As he and I descended, Jean decided to stay a little longer—I don’t blame him if he wanted to.\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n15 May, 1889\n@@@@ @@@@\nIt has been about a week since the exposition commenced here in Paris, and we have welcomed numerous distinguished visitors. However, I cannot help but note Jean’s conspicuous absence. Given his initial enthusiasm for this project, it is indeed perplexing that he would choose to miss this significant occasion.\n\nI have consulted with Émile regarding Jean's whereabouts. His repeated assertion is that Jean is engaged in another project outside the country and will not return in the immediate future. While this explanation may appear sufficient, I still find the entire situation warrants further scrutiny.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n**Document-6517-10-056:** The following documents have been collected from Emile Nouguier's personal constructions record.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nThe construction is progressing steadily, and the tower should be completed within two years at the latest. However, the same cannot be said for the sphere. I have offered my assistance to Jean on several occasions, but he insists on handling everything on his own. If I didn’t know the man as well as I do, I might accuse him of being obstinate and causing delays, but I understand his relentless pursuit of perfection. It’s not selfishness—it’s his meticulous nature. Still, it frustrates me to see the project dragged on when it could benefit from collaboration.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nJean has finally completed the work on the sphere, and I must admit, it surpasses my expectations. The only task that remains is to power it up. For a brief moment, I feared we might have to resort to some archaic ritual, like barbarians, but I was taken aback when Jean declared he would undertake this himself. He spoke of this being the most significant project of his life, and that’s precisely why he feels compelled to shoulder the responsibility alone.\n\nI didn’t attempt to dissuade him, knowing well that my words would have little effect. Jean has always demonstrated a readiness to go to great lengths for his craft—a truth I’ve recognized since our last venture in the city of Velmont.[[footnote]]No records of any town that has ever existed with the same name in France.[[/footnote]] So, let whatever may come, come.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n**Document-6517-12-030:** The following documents have been collected from Thomas Edison's personal journal after his return from Paris.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nToday, after arriving in Paris, I had the opportunity to inspect Mr. Gustave Eiffel's tower during the Exposition. While I respect the engineering behind it—Eiffel is a clever man—I still maintain that the structure is a blemish on the skyline, resembling an unfinished power plant more than a monument.\n\nHowever, the real event of the day was something I’ll not soon forget. I nearly lost my life. As I climbed the tower with Jimmy, we approached the edge of the platform to get a better view of the city. It was then that I stumbled on something, losing my balance. If Jimmy hadn’t grabbed me, I’d have been dashed to the ground below. When I turned back to see what had tripped me, I discovered it was a set of metal rods jutting from the platform’s surface. The oddest thing was that these rods hadn’t been there before, and for a moment, they resembled a human hand—before receding into the floor.\n\nNow, I’m no fool, nor am I prone to flights of fancy. Jimmy saw it, too. But I’ve decided not to speak of this to anyone. My work is rooted in facts and reason, and I won’t let an unexplained anomaly tarnish my scientific standing.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@ @@@@\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Addendum-6517-02: PoI-124\" hide=\"- Addendum-6517-02: PoI-124\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) 20px 20px/20% no-repeat; margin: auto; max-width: 500px; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ PoI-124 INFORMATION FILE.\n\n----\n[[/=]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/Jean|caption=PoI-124.|width=100px]]\n@@@@ @@@@\n**Real name:** Jean Barsan.\n\n**Date of birth:** May 1840.\n\n**Sex:** Male.\n\n**Background:** Jean Barsan is a French architectural anartist and a confirmed member of \"Are WE Cool Yet?\" (AWCY?). It is believed that Jean officially joined the group in 1876 when he was accepted into a group called \"Association Des Architectes Cools Francais,\"[[footnote]]Association of the cool French Architects.[[/footnote]] (AACF) which is believed to have originated as an independent branch of AWCY? This club was a gathering of anartists specializing in anomalous architecture and structure design.[[footnote]]The AACF was disbanded in 1941.[[/footnote]]\n\nDuring a comprehensive survey of anomalous objects discovered in France, it was confirmed that the PoI-124 had been involved in the creation of multiple sites and buildings exhibiting non-Euclidean properties, both before and following his membership in the AACF. The most recent finding pertains to a villa in Marseille, where passing through any door within the property results in the individual being randomly transported to a different room in ███████ with each traversal.\n\nIn 1879, PoI-124 was officially expelled from the AACF. The specific reasons for his expulsion remain undocumented. However, according to the statements by the remaining members about him: \"//His methods and worldview were far too excessively extreme, even by the organization's standards.//\" Following his expulsion, there were no further reports of anomalous objects linked to PoI-124 until his involvement in the design of SCP-6517 was later uncovered.\n\n**State:** Current location is unknown.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Addendum-6517-03: Incident-6517-Echo.234-11 Report\" hide=\"- Addendum-6517-03: Incident-6517-Echo.234-11 Report\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E8E8E8; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n ##red|**Subject:**## Incident-6517-Echo.234-11.\n\n ##red|**Date:**## ██/██/2007\n\n ##red|**Location:**## Tianducheng, China.\n\n----\n\n In the year 2007, an entity designated as SCP-6517-B-11 emerged in Tianducheng, China. During this period, agents associated with the Global Occult Coalition (GOC) stationed in China successfully identified the anomalous properties of the entity that manifested in that location. Furthermore, the GOC established communication with the government of the People's Republic of China prior to the deployment of the Foundation's field agents, who were tasked with implementing standard handling protocols. In collaboration with the Chinese government, all civilians within Tianducheng and a 6-kilometer radius surrounding SCP-6517-B-11 were evacuated. At ██:██ PM, a surface-to-surface missile was launched towards SCP-6517-B-11 from one of the GOC bases located in ████████, approximately kilometers away, with the intention of neutralizing the entity.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/lightning%20eiffel|caption=SCP-6517-B-11 **[REDACTED]**, during Incident-6517-Echo-11. Photographer unknown|width=80px]]\n\n The data retrieved from the GOC by the Foundation indicates that the procedure destroyed a significant portion of SCP-6517-B-11. However, this was followed by a violent reaction from the entity. The GOC report states that SCP-6517-B-11 retracted **[REDACTED]** seismic activity and subsequently released a wave of energy of unknown origin, resulting in the deaths of ██ GOC agents and ██ Chinese military personnel confirmed to have been involved in the operation targeting the entity. SCP-6517-B-11 then began regenerating itself from the damage. Ten minutes later, the tower emitted a second energy wave, which, although its effects were not immediately observed, later revealed that an unknown number of people within an undefined radius of SCP-6517-B-11 had forgotten how to speak their native language and adopted French instead.[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6517/China|caption=Tianducheng City after Incident-6517-Echo-11.|width=70px]]\n Following the complete regeneration of SCP-6517, the adjacent buildings and structures in Tianducheng underwent significant physical alterations and redesigns. This phenomenon persisted for a duration of 40 minutes, culminating in the transformation of all proximate edifices into traditional French architecture, closely resembling a replica of Paris. A subsequent investigation of the city unveiled the existence of a spatial-temporal anomaly at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1165|███████ ████ Street leading to ███████, located 0.3 km from downtown ███████]]]. Further research remains imperative. Additionally, a residential apartment has been identified at, designated as PoI-124-A2. A comparative analysis of the design and the location of PoI-124-A2 with the architectural plans and property ownership records from Paris indicates that it corresponds with the previous residence of PoI-124. The apartment is furnished in a 20th-century style and has been found to contain various documents and journals, which are believed to have belonged to PoI-124, including one categorized as document-6517-21-035. (Refer to addendum-6517-04.)\n----\n**Closing Note:** Following the incident, the SCP Foundation contacted the Chinese government to take over the handling of SCP-6517-B-11 from the GOC. Standard containment procedures were implemented for the case. A campaign was launched by the Foundation's field agents during which all witnesses to the incident, including civilians and Chinese military personnel, were administered Class-B amnestics.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Addendum-6517-04: Recovered document-6517-21-035\" hide=\"- Addendum-6517-04: Recovered document-6517-21-035\"]]\n\n**Document-6517-21-035:** The following document was recovered from PoI-124-A2, on ██/██/2007.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ ##red|__Project Proposal 1889-228: \"La dame de fer\"__##\n\n**Name:** Jean Barsan\n\n**Title:** La dame de fer\n\n**Material Requirements:**\n\n* 70kg of cement (Already used in the sphere).\n* The French flag (Already used in the sphere).\n* The thunder of Zeus (Already used in the sphere).\n* The spirit of the French Revolution ( I'll save this for the last step).\n* A monument that will represent the French Republic (This will be the Eiffel Tower)\n \n**Abstract:** The first step is to wait for the tower's construction to be completed. \n\nThe sphere will be placed at the highest point on the tower, where the sun meets the horizon, aligning perfectly with the sphere.\n\nNext, the sphere must be powered, and for that, I will summon the spirit of the French Revolution. To do this, I will need to use mine as a host for the spirit. If everything goes according to plan, the sphere will merge with the tower’s structure, allowing it to expand.\n\nThe final step will be to extend the tower's foundations underground and then to any location on the planet. If the spirit can remember its original form, I will be able to reconstruct the tower with varying precision, but it should serve its purpose. \n\n**Intent:** As for myself, I like to think that I've been a patriot since I was a child. When I was young, I always enjoyed reading about the Napoleonic wars, a time when our nation was at the height of its power and glory. The only cowardly way we were defeated was by others avoiding direct combat with us in the first place. And although we are still considered one of the great powers today, I feel that our downfall isn’t far off. It’s the cycle of life for every empire that has reached its golden age—to eventually fall back into darkness.\n\nIn addition to history, art was one of the hobbies that held a special place in my heart. I wanted to become an artist, but of course, my father had a different idea. He wanted me to specialize in mathematics and accounting. Naturally, I didn’t want to give up my passion for art, but I wasn’t in a position to stand up to my father. However, I managed to reach a compromise with him and decided to specialize in architectural design. Architecture wasn’t what I initially envisioned as an artistic field, but I’ll admit that I grew to love it over time.\n\nIn the years that followed, nothing particularly remarkable happened in my life. I went to college, met Émile there, graduated, and started working for various architecture firms. But the turning point came when I discovered a new field of art—a field that would give my architectural creations a new dimension, a spirit of their own, allowing them to speak for themselves. Unfortunately, there weren’t many people interested in this field, and some exhibitions in France even banned it. However, I eventually managed to find and join a community here in Paris that shared my liberating artistic vision—or so I thought, until I realized they were just a group of arrogant, envious individuals lacking any sense of adventure into the unknown, and my last adventure with them was during the exhibition held in Velmont, and among everything showcased there, my piece was so magnificent that it made the city jump. Because of this, they came up with some feeble excuses to expel me from the community. But I see it as liberation from their boxed-in ideas. I regret nothing.\n\nSimply put, my works have always depicted the golden age of the Republic, representing how our values and ideas influenced the world in both the past and the future. The Eiffel Tower will be the true portrayal of France: an elegant and cultured lady, yet also strong and stubborn like iron, extending her values like roots to all the civilized nations of the world and establishing them.\n\n I have grown old now and considered retiring for a while, but not before making a grand exit, which is why I trust no one but myself to undertake this task.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Addendum-6517-05: Note from Dr. Harrison\" hide=\"- Addendum-6517-05: Note from Dr. Harrison\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAfter what happened with the GOC, I have become certain that neutralizing SCP-6517 using physical force is crossed out of our options.\n\nMy analysis of the incident in China leads me to believe that the tower might be sentient, which could indicate the presence of some spirit inhabiting it. Therefore, my alternative proposal is to apply traditional exorcism to the tower, which might completely neutralize its anomalous properties. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7779|Its either that, or we're gonna have to remove the entire country of France from the existence.]]] But, witnessing the results of the last neutralization attempt, makes me question whether it is truly worth the risk. \n\n-- Dr. Harrison\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n@@@@ @@@@\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 20px 20px/20% no-repeat; margin: auto; max-width: 500px; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\nDuring a routine database check, we discovered a written entry in this file.
