Access to SCP-7216 is limited to personnel who are approved by both the current Head Researcher and Site Director. As SCP-7216 is currently actively utilized by Site-77's D Class Enrollment Program, it is to be handled with extreme care to ensure it remains functional. SCP-7216 is to be cleaned daily, and is not to be removed from its locker for more than twelve continuous hours at any time. The item is to be unloaded before it is placed back into its storage locker.\n\nTesting with SCP-7216's \"primary fire\" ability is forbidden indefinitely. Only SCP-7216-1 instances created through the utilization of the item's \"secondary fire\" ability are to be enrolled as D Class personnel. Any SCP-7216-1 instances created through the utilization of the item's primary anomalous property are to be --terminated-- temporarily contained on Site-77 and are to await transfer to an available Humanoid Containment Site.\n\nInvestigation into the existence of GoI-6127 (\"Saunders Brothers, Incorporated\") is ongoing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7216 is a physically non-anomalous SIG Sauer P226 full-sized service pistol[[footnote]]SCP-7216's date and place of creation are ambiguous, as all efforts to identify the item's serial number have failed. It is unknown if SCP-7216 appears in J. P. Sauer & Sohn Maschinenbau GmbH's company records or if the said company was involved at all with SCP-7216's creation.[[/footnote]] designed to fire 9Ã—19mm Parabellum cartridges. When held and fired, SCP-7216 functions as a regular pistol of its kind would. However, projectiles fired from SCP-7216 do not act as non-anomalous bullets of their kind would upon being propelled by the weapon and are thus designated SCP-7216-1.\n\nSCP-7216-1 instances display decreased momentum and acceleration rate upon exiting the gun. Due to a rapid increase in their mass, instances of SCP-7216-1 will usually lose most of their kinetic energy after travelling for 20-40 centimeters and fall to the ground. This makes SCP-7216 relatively less effective as a combat weapon unless it is fired at point blank, although doing so can lead to unpredictable results due to the properties of SCP-7216-1.\n\nUpon being fired from SCP-7216, an instance of SCP-7216-1 will undergo spontaneous alterations to its composition. SCP-7216-1's composition will become entirely biological and analysis of tissue samples taken from SCP-7216-1 instances have shown they are genetically identical to modern humans (//Homo sapiens//). \n[[footnote]]Analysis has additionally shown that SCP-7216-1 instances of identical gender will always be genetically identical to each other.[[/footnote]] Following its propulsion from the gun, SCP-7216-1 will undergo rapid cellular duplication which leads to an increase in mass. This process will last for somewhere between five to twelve seconds. By the end of this period, SCP-7216-1 will have gone through every stage of its developmental process and transformed into a fully sapient adult human of varying gender with a complete set of functioning organs, bones, muscles and nerves. The biological age of these humans can range from around 20 to 50 years. \n\nSCP-7216-1 instances formed through this process claim to be able to recall a set of mostly vague memories of a purported life prior to their ejection from SCP-7216. Even though SCP-7216-1 instances will usually struggle to fully recall details regarding their purported experiences, most of the details that the instances are able to recall are almost completely identical across every SCP-7216-1 instance of the same gender. For example, instances of SCP-7216-1 universally claim to have been born in the city of Lugano, Switzerland on 22/11/1975 and are fluent in both Italian and German. It is unknown how SCP-7216-1 instances are able to develop outside of a womb or how SCP-7216 is able to form these memories.\n\nSCP-7216's secondary anomalous property activates only if its handler vocalizes one of the ten phrases which can supposedly trigger a particular portion of SCP-7216's \"code\" and fires the weapon less than thirty seconds following this vocalization. See Addenda for more details on SCP-7216's \"secondary fire\" ability.\n\n**Addendum 7216.01:** Discovery\n\nSCP-7216 was recovered from the corpse of Franzi Bolliger, an illegal arms dealer operating in Lugano, after emergency services were dispatched to Bolliger's house following a call from a civilian woman, Nola Felix, who had reportedly witnessed Bolliger's lifeless body resting on the floor while looking through the house's window. Felix later claimed to have come into contact with Bolliger through the Internet and that he had offered to sell her what he referred to as \"a gun with supernatural powers.\" Even though she was reportedly sceptical of this offer at first, Felix was persuaded by Bolliger after he messaged a video to her in which he demonstrated the anomalous properties of SCP-7216. The said video was confirmed to exist later on and recovered from Felix's hard drive.\n\nBolliger's cause of death was determined to be massive cranial trauma caused by the manifestation of 63 kilograms of various biological material inside his skull; including skin, muscle tissue, brain tissue, bone fragments and nails. Following the genetic analysis of these materials and discovery of SCP-7216's anomalous properties, it has been ruled that Bolliger died as a consequence of mishandling the weapon.\n\nPer standard protocol, Nola Felix and every emergency service personnel who witnessed Bolliger's corpse were administered Class B amnestic treatment. Bolliger's death was explained as suicide via gunshot. \n\nThe aforementioned video recovered from Ms. Felix's laptop was transported onto a USB and subsequently taken into custody. An English transcription of the video has been provided below.\n\n> **Transcript 7216-D-01**\n> \n> **Recovery Date:** 05/01/2016\n> \n> **Duration:** 3m 38s\n> \n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> //[The footage begins with the shot of an open grassland. Multiple trees are visible several meters in front of Bolliger, who is filming.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** Hello, Ms. Felix. I'm sure you can reckon the reason I'm contacting you now. You called me a liar, so here's my alibi.\n> \n> //[Bolliger holds SCP-7216 up with his right hand and shows it to the camera.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** This gun you see here is a full sized service pistol that fires nine by nineteen milimeter Parabellum cartridges. This is no ordinary gun though. I paid quite a hefty price for this and I've had it for around six months. Long story short, I got bored and now I'm looking to sell it. I am... not allowed to disclose who I bought it from but rest assured, it wasn't the mafia. I'm sure you'll see why once I demonstrate it.\n> \n> //[Bolliger aims SCP-7216 at one of the trees and shoots. The fired SCP-7216-1 instance fails to make contact with the tree and falls to the ground after travelling for several centimeters.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** If you were looking for weapons to protect your property, I'm afraid this'll disappoint you. But trust me.\n> \n> //[The SCP-7216-1 instance begins to rapidly grow in size. It begins assuming a humanoid shape after three seconds and after ten seconds have passed, the instance has finally become a fully grown SCP-7216-1. The instance (SCP-7216-1-01) is a male human with blonde hair, green eyes and freckles on its face. It sits on the grass and observes its surroundings, apparently confused.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** This is much more fun.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** What? Where am I? \n> \n> **Bolliger:** Once fired, the gun dispenses a standard adult human of random gender. There is a fifty-fifty chance of it being a woman or a man. This is what the male version looks like.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** Who are you? Are you filming this?\n> \n> **Bolliger:** And this is what the female version looks like.\n> \n> //[Bolliger fires SCP-7216 again after aiming it at a tree behind SCP-7216-1-01. SCP-7216-1-01 becomes distressed and covers its ears.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** Dear God! Careful with that, you maniac! That thing is loud!\n> \n> //[The fired SCP-7216-1 instance (SCP-7216-1-02) similarly drops after travelling for several centimeters and begins growing in size, transforming into a fully grown instance within seven seconds. The instance is a male of identical appearance.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** What the hell is happening? \n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-02:** Huh? [points at Bolliger] Who are you? Why am I here? [notices SCP-7216-1-01] Oh God. I'm high, aren't I?\n> \n> **Bolliger:** Ah, shit. Like I said, this thing is a bit unreliable at times because its shooting is randomized. But I'm very certain if we try again-\n> \n> //[Bolliger aims SCP-7216 between the two SCP-7216-1 instances and fires a third time. This time, the instance takes five seconds to fully grow. This instance (SCP-7216-1-03) is a female with blonde hair, green eyes and freckles on its face. Upon completing its growth, SCP-7216-1-03 holds its abdomen and retches.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-03:** [groans] My stomach is killing me. [grabs its head] And my head hurts. Where... Where am I?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** Wait a minute. I recognize you. [stands up] You look familiar. What's your name? \n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-03:** My name? Milla, I think? I don't know, my head really hurts. Who are you? And why are you-\n> \n> **Bolliger:** And //that// is what the female version looks like. And if that's not to your liking, well... there is only one way to dispose of them, I'm afraid.\n> \n> //[Bolliger drops SCP-7216 on the ground and pulls out an identical service pistol.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-01:** Wait, what do you mean by dispose? No, wait, don't-\n> \n> //[Bolliger fires the pistol three times and shoots SCP-7216-1-01, -1-03 and -1-02; in that respective order, killing all three instantly. Bolliger then drops the pistol and picks up SCP-7216 again.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** Yeah. But if you don't want to deal with that, and why would you, this weapon also fires custom bullets. There are ten different custom bullet options you can shoot with, five male and five female. You can have more, it's just that I couldn't afford it. \n> \n> //[Bolliger points SCP-7216 at the sky.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** [speaking slow and clear] Ryan Rodney Reynolds.\n> \n> //[Bolliger fires SCP-7216. The fired SCP-7216-1 instance drops right in front of Bolliger and fully grows within eight seconds. The instance (SCP-7216-1-04) stands erect facing Bolliger. It doesn't appear to blink or breathe and maintains a blank expression. Even though only SCP-7216-1-04's face can be captured on camera, the instance closely resembles Canadian born actor, producer and businessman Ryan Reynolds as he appeared in his early thirties.]//\n> \n> **Bolliger:** [chuckles] I bet I have your attention now, don't I? Just message me back and we can discuss the details later. I have a feeling you're going to be interested in this, Ms. Felix.\n> \n> //[Bolliger terminates the film.]//\n> \n> [END LOG]\n\nFollowing the recovery of this footage, the Bolliger estate was raided by Foundation agents who discovered three drums containing hydrochloric acid which were presumably used by Bolliger to dispose the bodies of the deceased SCP-7216-1 instances seen in the film. An extensive investigation of the estate followed, during which one of the teams located a letter hidden underneath one of the house's floorboards with a message printed on it in Italian and an English translation provided under it. An English transcript of this document's text has been provided below.\n\n> **Document 7216-D-01**\n> \n> To whomever this may concern,\n> \n> Thank you for purchasing Saunders-Grade Pleasure Pistolâ„¢ v. 1.0. This manual is intended to provide you with instructions on how to maximize your satisfaction with our services and to prevent any accidents which may occur due to customer mishandling. Please remember the Saunders brand is not responsible for any injuries which may result from any such accidents.\n> \n> Because you answered that you are bisexual in the customized survey we provided for you[[footnote]]There exists no known evidence to corroborate this information, as all official records of Bolliger's life support that he identified as a heterosexual male throughout his life time.[[/footnote]], this product has been equipped with the genetic codes of five male and five female celebrities of your own choosing.[[footnote]]None of the individuals named in this document contacted by undercover Foundation operatives demonstrated any familiarity with either SCP-7216, Franzi Bolliger, Nola Felix or the brand referred to as \"Saunders Brothers.\"[[/footnote]] In the event of this item being fired normally, it will dispense a standard human being of one of the two registered biological sexes. Frequent usage of this feature is not advised as doing so can lead to unwanted accidents around your household and risk violating the agreements of the non-disclosure pact you signed with Saunders Brothers, Incorporated. Instead, you can benefit from this item's secondary feature by uttering the full legal name of any of the following individuals and firing your weapon within no more than thirty seconds of doing so.\n> \n> This item has been equipped with the codes of five **males**:\n> \n> 1.

Felix's passport was successfully recovered, although no errors could be determined with it, contrary to the claims of numerous border guard officers. Records of her online interactions with Mr. Bolliger have been seized and investigation into the conditions under which she and Bolliger died is ongoing.\n\n**Addendum 7216.02:** Excerpts from Testing Log 7216-A\n\n> **Test #:** 001\n> \n> **Protocol:** D-8657 was ordered to aim SCP-7216 at an immobile target located 25 meters away from his position and shoot once. The purpose of this test was to collect more information on the cognitive extent and origins of SCP-7216-1.\n> \n> **Result:** SCP-7216 ejected a female instance of SCP-7216-1 (SCP-7216-1-04) which landed approximately 35 cm away from D-8657 and fully developed within 8 seconds. The ejected instance's appearance was identical to the one observed on the film recovered from Nola Felix's hard drive. It measured 165 cm in height, 45 kg in weight and spoke fluent Italian in a Swiss accent. The instance's biological age was estimated to be 20-30 years old. The instance was interviewed by Dr. Polifemo Corsi and subsequently terminated.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 7216-A-01\" hide=\"- Interview Log 7216-A-01\"]]\n> **Interview Log 7216-A-01**\n> \n> **Foreword:** Interview originally conducted in Italian.\n> \n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Hello and good afternoon, Subject 7216-1-04.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** That's a very long name. I'm not sure it's mine. Thanks for the clothes, by the way.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** It's the provisional designation we gave you, don't think too much about it. And also, you're welcome. Before we start, is there anything you'd like to ask me first?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Just one thing, at least for now. What is this place?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** This is a scientific research facility. We are trying to figure out who you are and where you came from.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Ah. Good luck then.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Are you able to explain the unusual properties of the weapon which led to your creation?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** The... weapon that lead to my creation? That's a weird way to describe it but... Are you talking about my mother-\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** [interrupting] I'm going to take that as a no. Does the name \"Saunders\" mean anything to you?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I have no idea what that means.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** That's fine. Do you have a name?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Funny you should ask. [pause] My name is Milla.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** What's your full name?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Milla isn't short for anything. My full name is Milla.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Do you have a surname?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Everyone has a surname.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** What's yours?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I don't remember.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** How can you forget your surname?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I forget a lot of things. I don't even remember how I got here. Don't you have any better questions? These aren't helping anyone.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Right. How about parents? Do you remember anything about a mother or a father? Do you remember your mother's name, if you had one?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** No. But I remember having a mother. [pauses and thinks] I remember her as having an interest in guns. She also had interest in other things, but I don't want to talk about them. I don't think I miss her. My head hurts sometimes. I think it's her fault. [another, longer pause] She might've done something to me.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** How about your father? Do you remember your father's name?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** No. But I remember he's dead.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** How did he die?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Given the information at hand... gun violence, probably. [chuckles]\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Was that an attempt at humor? I suggest you take this interview a little more seriously. \n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I know, I know. Sorry.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Do you remember where you were born?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Lugano. It's... a city in Switzerland. Ever heard of it?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Yes. I was born in Italy. It borders Switzerland, as you may know.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Good.... good for you. [whispering to itself] Italy, Germany, France, Austria. Italy, Germany, France Austria. Italy, Germany, France-\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** We shouldn't go off topic. If you're from Switzerland, can you prove it by telling me what the capital of Switzerland is?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** It doesn't have a capital.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** ...alright. Did you attend school in Lugano? Or were you raised some place else? Do you remember?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I remember college. I had some friends there. Don't remember names or faces, was never good with them. I think I miss them. They didn't do anything to me. [spits on the floor] Sorry about that. Just felt like doing it.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** It's okay. Do you remember when you were born?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Twenty second of November nineteen-seventy-five. \n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** You sound sure of it.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** It's the only date I remember. Figured it was my birthday.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** What's the latest memory you can remember?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Something about... a cake, candles and a table. My mother isn't there. Neither is my father, although he has a good excuse. Somebody else is there. I don't know who they are but they're there. I remember feeling really sleepy, it's so bad that I'm having a hard time keeping my eyes open and can't focus on anything. Then I black out and when I open my eyes again, I see a guy pointing a gun at me.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** What's the earliest memory you can remember?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** [grabs its head] Too far. You went way too far. Hurts to think about.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** I understand and I apologize. I have one last question.\n> \n> //[Dr. Corsi procures a photograph of a male instance of SCP-7216-1.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Do you know this person?\n> \n> //[SCP-7216-1-04 leans forward to look at the picture.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Yes, but I don't remember them.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Please elaborate.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I know that I know them, but I don't know who they are. I know that he knows me, but... [pause] No. Now that I think about it, who even am I? Does anyone even know? Do you know? \n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Well, you said your name is Milla.\n> \n> //[SCP-7216-1-04 opens its mouth in shock. It seems to panick and cover its face with its hands, whimpering.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said it.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Why not?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** Because my name does not belong to me. It does not. Not anymore. My essence is someone else's. My body... My body is someone else's. I have a purpose. I don't know what it is but it's not this. [points at its shirt] I can't have things. Why did you give these to me? I can't have things, how can I? These belong to you.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** They don't. We gave them to you.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-04:** These clothes are yours. Don't lie, I can feel it. I'm so, so sorry.\n> \n> //[SCP-7216-1-04 stands up and begins to hyperventilate while grasping at its chest. Dr. Coris becomes uncomfortable and stands up as well.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** I see you're not equipped to answer any more questions. I thereby conclude this interview. [in English] We're done here. \n> \n> //[Dr. Corsi exits the room. Two guards enter soon after to subdue SCP-7216-1-04 and remove it for subsequent termination.]//\n> \n> [END LOG]\n> \n> **Conclusion:** //SCP-7216-1-04 demonstrated symptoms in line with cases of dissociative amnesia and severe infantile amnesia throughout the interview. Post-mortem analysis results show the instance never actually suffered any visible brain damage, meaning this condition was likely either caused by psychological trauma or another issue stemming from the anomalous rapid development of a  brain.

But this \"something\" isn't chasing me down or anything. It's more like I'm trying to put a distance between myself and someone or something that I don't like. That's why I'm walking, to get away from my problems as much as I can. I think.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Is that all you can remember? \n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Like I said, I remember being pretty high or drunk. I couldn't walk straight. I remember a black van passing by me. That's the moment I passed out and woke up here a little later. How long have I been asleep, by the way?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** I don't know, couldn't say. What's the last date you can remember?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** I don't remember when this happened. It couldn't have been more than a couple days ago. What's today's date?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** It's the seventh of January.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Then this probably happened on the sixth.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Just out of curiosity, what year do you think we're in?\n> \n> //[SCP-7216-1-06 does not answer. Instead, it stares and smiles at Dr. Corsi, occassionally nervously glancing to its right.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** [sighs] Well. Moving on then. Are you able to explain the unusual properties of the weapon which led to your creation?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** I'm just going to take that as a no again. Does the name \"Saunders\" mean anything to you?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Where are these questions even coming from? Who is Saunders?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** It's alright if you don't know. Do you have a name?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** How is that relevant? \n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** How is that not relevant?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** I don't think I was supposed to have a name. People like me aren't supposed to have names.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Can you explain why?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** You're wasting your time with redundant questions. I have this innate feeling. I have a purpose to fullfil here, I can //feel// it in me and my name wouldn't have anything to do with it even if I could remember what it was. You people are not cops. No. That would be too simple. I know it.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** You're not really being helpful. You clearly have some kind of medical condition. It's not normal for a person to forget their name. Whatever happened to you last night, it clearly affected you in a serious way and we're trying to help you. Can't you remember anything? Like your mother's name? Or your father's?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Nope. Don't remember anything about my father. And my mother... well... I can remember a face. Brown hair. Hazel eyes. Lazy left eye. But that's all. No name.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Do you remember where you were born?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Oh, that's easy. My home town's Lugano. You know, southern Switzerland? [pause] We're still in Switzerland, right?\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Yeah, sure. Did you attend school here, in Lugano? Or were you raised some place else?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** I don't remember ever leaving this place my entire life. It's my home, you know.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Can you recall anything about your life that really stand out? Anything at all? Like your birthday? Any partners or friends or pleasent moments like your wedding or any embarrassing memories like... I don't know, falling to the ground in front of your crush? Anything?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Oh boy, that's a lot of details to consider. My birthday is on the twenty second of November. I was born in nineteen-seventy-five. I remember that, would never forget //that//. [chuckles] Other than that, I guess I can remember a... a girl? With blonde hair? I think she was my girlfriend or someone very, very close. The image is there but there is still no name.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** Could this be the person you're talking about?\n> \n> //[Dr. Corsi shows SCP-7216-1-06 a picture of a female instance of SCP-7216-1.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** Eh. It could be. She looks pretty familiar, but it could be just another blonde lady. In fact, you know what, let's just... [hands the picture to Dr. Corsi] It's just that I feel like I already said too much and... this picture and all these questions... it's just... It's all a bit too much, okay? Remember when I talked about having a purpose? I think none of this has anything to do with that and I'm tired of wasting my time. Do what you gotta do with me. Come on. Whatever it is, I can take it.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** What?\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-06:** You know, don't you? Oh, you cunning little thing. You knew all along. You have to know, someone has to know. Come on then. Do it. Show me my purpose. I'm tired of sitting here doing nothing.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** I asked everything I had to ask. I conclude this interview. Thank you for your cooperation, 7216-1-06.\n> \n> //[SCP-7216-1-06 spontaneously bursts into laughter and falls off its chair. Dr. Corsi ignores this and exits the room. Two guards enter soon after to subdue SCP-7216-1-06 and remove it for subsequent termination.]//\n> \n> [END LOG]\n> \n> **Conclusion:** //Despite appearing significantly better adjusted to their condition than SCP-7216-1-04 and -05, SCP-7216-1-06 demonstrated similar symptoms of severe amnesia. Autopsy results also similarly showed the specimen was otherwise in perfect health at the time of death.// - Dr. Polifemo Corsi\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n> **Test #:** 004\n> \n> **Protocol:** D-8657 was ordered to aim SCP-7216 at an immobile target located 25 meters away from his position and shoot once immediately after vocalizing the words \"Dwayne Douglas Johnson.\" The purpose of this test was to collect more information on the secondary anomalous property of SCP-7216 mentioned in Document 7216-D-01.\n> \n> **Result:** SCP-7216 ejected a male instance of SCP-7216-1 (SCP-7216-1-07) which landed approximately 35 cm away from D-8657 and fully developed within 11 seconds. This instance showed abnormal behavior; it didn't appear to breath, blink or react to any external stimuli other than verbal commands. Additionally, the instance's physical appearance resembled that of American actor, professional wrestler, and businessman Dwayne Douglas \"the Rock\" Johnson as he appeared in the late 90s during the early years of his wrestling career. The instance did not resist containment, was interviewed by Dr. Polifemo Corsi and subsequently terminated.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 7216-A-03\" hide=\"- Interview Log 7216-A-03\"]]\n> **Interview Log 7216-A-03**\n> \n> **Foreword:** Part of interview originally conducted in Italian.\n> \n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> //[Dr. Corsi enters the room where SCP-7216-1-07 is standing erect, facing the interview room's door.

It's a pleasure to be in the presence of a celebrity, Mr. Johnson. Tell me more about yourself.\n> \n> **SCP-7216-1-07:** I am an American actor, professional wrestler and businessman. I am signed to WWE, where I perform on a part-time basis. Widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, I was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling Federation, WWF, now WWE, during the Attitude Era. I wrestled for the WWF full-time for eight years before pursuing an acting career. My films have grossed over three point five billion American dollars in North America and over ten point five billion American dollars worldwide, making me one of the world's highest-grossing and highest-paid actors. I am a co-owner of the United Football League, a member of the board of directors of TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of UFC and WWE, and co-founder of Seven Bucks Productions.\n> \n> **Dr. Corsi:** That was... awfully detailed.

Autopsy results showed us that even though the instance possessed a complete set of organs, none of them were functional and it is unknown how the instance was able to move on its own. Additionally, tissue samples taken from the instance showed a 99.99995% likelihood of a genetic match with the real Dwayne Johnson.//\n> \n> //It appears the information provided in Document 7216-D-01 was correct after all. Firing SCP-7216 after vocalizing the full legal name of one of the ten individuals mentioned in the said document will cause the resulting SCP-7216-1 instance to be genetically identical to the individual whose name was spoken. Instances created through this method appear to lack free will and are compelled to obey any verbal commands directly given to them in the native language of the individual the instance is physically identical to.//\n> \n> //I believe we can utilize this ability, given that all SCP-7216-1 instances produced through this method are still entirely genetically human. Since all my requests to utilize SCP-7216-1 instances created through SCP-7216's primary fire ability as D Class personnel were denied for reasons that are still a mystery to me, I hope the Ethics Committee will act reasonable and hear me out this time.//\n> \n> //I am thereby submitting this as a formal request. I'll be awaiting my answer, patiently.// - Dr. Polifemo Corsi\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email? One (1) new message!\" hide=\"Re:REQUEST\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**TO:** Leo Mustafa, Ethics Committes Liaison for Site-77\n**FROM:** Doctor Polifemo Corsi\n**SUBJECT:** Here's your response, for which you had been waiting patiently\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello Dr. Corsi, I hope this email finds you well.\n\nAs a representative of the Committee, I speak for all of us here when I say we find your treatment of SCP-7216-1 instances highly concerning. I have read the unabridged testing logs, and my //god//, there is something fundamentally broken with you. The O5s might have turned a blind eye to this, but if I could, I would've done this to you sooner. We all agree that we have learned everything we could from testing with SCP-7216-1 instances. The Council and Committee have jointly ruled that further testing with these instances is to be forbidden //forever//. Additionally, you will be removed and replaced as the head researcher of the SCP-7216 project. Allow me to explain why:\n\nThe minds of those people you experimented on, yes, //people//, had degraded to such a point that they were unable to remember even their own names, yes. But that doesn't mean they were less human than you or I, Corsi. I watched the logs. I heard the desperation in those women and men's voices. They were scared, Corsi. I could tell they were scared and confused, how would //you// feel if you were in the place of those poor bastards? What even was the point of some of those experiments? What do you think was going to happen when you had that one D Class fire the gun at another guy's abdomen? And why didn't you abort the test after you heard all those god-awful bone crunching sounds coming from the guy's stomach? Both of those people were visibly in pain, what was the point of dragging their torment on for as long as possible? What was there to learn from that?\n\nYou'll be happy to know your request to integrate SCP-7216 into Site-77's D Class Enrollment Program has been approved. However, as long as I have anything to say in this matter, SCP-7216-1 instances created using the weapon's primary fire option will NOT be used for any such purpose. The fact that those people are able to recall memories, no matter how vague, means they are //real people// with //real emotions//. I won't stand for that kind of abuse.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeo Mustafa\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7215]]] | SCP-7216 | [[[SCP-7217]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=arhanandic]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** gun.jpg\n> **Name:** gun.jpg\n> **Author:** IrrationalBeing\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sig_Sauer_P226_Legion_1.jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** Image is cropped\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
