I like to draw people and sometimes things. Do you have a person or a thing you would like me to draw? Ask me if I'm currently taking commissions! Usually I am. Just tell me what you're interested in getting and I'll give you a quote. My starting rate is 25$/hour, so full-color full-body art is usually $50, just as a frame of reference.\n\n+++ Disclaimer!\nI am best at drawing humans/humanoid things. While I can draw animals, mechanics, landscapes, locations, etc, I am not very good at it and rates will probably be a bit higher for things like that. My honest recommendation is that if you're looking for something in that realm, commission a different artist who can make something that is worth the money because for real mine probably won't be.\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
