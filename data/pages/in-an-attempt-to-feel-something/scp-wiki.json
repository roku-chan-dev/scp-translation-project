Wrapped it around their throat and tightened as the fruits tumbled and fell. I caught a glimpse of their face: confused, petrified, struggling, weak. Slowly, it shifted to a ##blue|frozen blue## then a ##purple|poisonous purple## before they gave in. How they flailed, how their extremities failed to release themselves from my grasp. It almost felt rejuvenating. I almost felt alive…\n\n##gray|//Almost.//##\n\nAlways teetering on the edge while my owner went and tripped. Pushed them off in an attempt to feel something. A heartbeat, a disturbance, some sense of movement. A half-something even, a quartered-halved-part of a feeling. But no, it's nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nSamples without tastes.\n\nBooks without pages.\n\nMouths without ears.\n\n##gray|A gap in the process.##\n\nI choked my owner to death in an attempt to feel something. Loosening my grip, I watched as their limp body dropped with a silent thud. Every day, they would make their usual for breakfast, took some berries and ice and the like, stuffed them in me for a whirl and a whisk. Tastes almost sweet, //almost// delectable. Something's always off, though. It never tasted like enough. Missing, missing a flavor, something to fill the hole. Every day, it felt empty. I knew nothing at all.\n\nFace planted on the ground, the sound of breathing ceased long ago. I thought some amusement would meet me here but I was only waiting, waiting, waiting for dead silence. Still bright outside, but bleak from where I stood. Fruit gathered ants, ants gathered flies. Gentle buzzing but it was quiet in between. Almost warm but cold nonetheless. Cold, cold, ##blue|//cold.//##\n\nI stood before a corpse growing cold in an attempt to feel something. Maybe some sense of regret, some sadness, relief, or realization. Not even boredom, I only knew numbness. The ceiling fan swirled in circles, a metaphor in a way. Always thought it would fall down, down, down eventually. This desperation for a struck chord, left to linger for forever. Something to stir the pot, something to ring a bell, something to keep me alive.\n\nAlive.\n\n[[size 125%]]Alive.[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]//Alive.//[[/size]]\n\n[[size 175%]]//ALIVE.//[[/size]]\n\n[[size 200%]]##gray|//A L I V E.//##[[/size]]\n\nALIVE, I JUST WANT TO FEEL ALIVE.

Tasteless, a nothing burger. Nothing worth saying, nothing worthwhile. I dug their arm deeper and deeper into my blades. A physical-to-mental approach maybe, an indirection. I just want a FEEL, I just want a TASTE. Please keep me together, something, anything. Can't stress, can't express, my emotions are SPEAKING IN //DIFFERENT// .-.. .- -. --. ..- .- --. . ... I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND.\n\nHollowed out and naked, knocking on wood in an attempt to feel something. I'm a glass vase shattered into pieces, water escaping from my everything. All I sense is blood, an almost feeling. Half way somewhere, half of a someone. A caricature, a draft, a sketch. But I want to be more, something complete, something finished, something //real.// I just want to be enough.\n\nCan't I be enough?\n\n…\n\nNo, it's\nnev\ner\n\nEno\nugh.\n\nI'm never\n##gray|enough.##\n\nAlways out of\n\n[[>]]\ntouch,\nalways a quarter,\nalways a half,\nalways almost there,\nbut it'll never work out,\n##gray|I'll //never// be enough.##\n[[/>]]\n\n…\n\nNobody's here.\n\nNobody's here anymore.\n\nNobody's home.\n\nThis home is just a house.\n\n…\n\nI ground the corpse into a paste in an attempt to feel something. ##red|Red## splattered the walls of my chamber, ##blue|blue## grew the body, ##green|green## spread the mold, yet it all felt so, so ##gray|gray.## Numbness, emptiness, lackadaisical in every sense of the word.
