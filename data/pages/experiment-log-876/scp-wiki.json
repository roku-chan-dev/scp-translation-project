No organic material discovered in the debris, but small amounts of graphite and [REDACTED] found.\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-2**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-2 (helium), followed by one from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen).\n**Results:** No effect.\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-3**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-18 (argon), followed by one from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen).\n**Results:** Subject lapsed into a coughing fit. Hydrogen content of surrounding air found to be increased post-experiment.\n**Notes:** //It apparently treats the contents of the victim's lungs as part of the body. -Dr. ████//\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-4**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure:** D-class personnel instructed to swallow a small, steel ball bearing. Following that, D-class was instructed to swallow one pill from SCP-876-26 (iron), followed by one from SCP-876-79 (gold).\n**Results:** Subject immediately collapsed and expired, as expected. Dissection of the stomach revealed the steel ball to have converted into a gold-colored ball.\n**Notes:** //This also works for the stomach contents. -Dr. ████//\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-5**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure 1:** D-class personnel anesthetized and the stomach cut open. One SCP-876-1 pill (hydrogen) added to the stomach and observed. \n**Result 1:** The pill did not dissolve in stomach acids.\n**Procedure 2:** Robotic arm used to lift SCP-876-2 (helium) pill and insert it into D-class's stomach. High-speed camera used for observation.\n**Result 2:** Both pills disappeared approximately 0.01 seconds before conversion and the resulting explosive decompression.\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-6**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure:** Pill extracted from SCP-876-1 (hydrogen), then bisected with a laser.\n**Results:** Small puff of yellow flames, signaling a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-7**\n\n**Date:** ██-██-██\n**Procedure:** Pill extracted from SCP-876-92 (uranium), then bisected with a laser.\n**Results:** Geiger counter detected no amount of uranium in the pill.\n**Notes:** //Why does it only do this for radioactive elements? Look into it. -Dr. ████//\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-8**\n**Procedure:** One half of pill used in experiment 876-A-6 welded to one half of pill used in 876-A-7. Resulting capsule is similar in appearance to pills from SCP-876-█ and SCP-876-██. D-class personnel instructed to swallow the gold ball from 876-A-4, followed by a capsule from SCP-876-79 (gold) and then the new pill.\n**Results:** D-class doubled over in pain and promptly fell unconscious. Geiger counters detected a concentrated source of radioactivity inside D-class, suggesting [DATA EXPUNGED]\n**Notes:** //That's certainly interesting. The mechanisms must be slightly different. -Dr. ████//\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-9**\n**Procedure:** One pill from SCP-876-40 (zirconium) and one from SCP-876-80 (mercury) placed side-by-side, colors aligned. Capsules are visually identical, colors █████ and ██████. Both pills placed under a microscope.\n**Results:** Despite extensive analysis, no difference between the pills could be visually determined. Identities of pills were not recorded, so --it is not known which corresponds to which element-- See Experiment Log 876-A-10.\n**Notes:** //Pay attention to which one is which next time. -Dr. ████//\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-10**\n**Procedure 1:** Unidentified pills from Experiment 876-A-9 were weighed.\n**Result 1:** Significant discrepancy in mass. This is attributed to a difference in density of the contents. \n**Procedure 2:** Mercury-zirconium amalgam administered to D-class. Heavier pill administered, followed by lighter pill. D-class then sedated and stomach dissected to retrieve amalgam.\n**Result 2:** Amalgam changed into a lump of zirconium.\n\n**Experiment Log 876-A-11**\n**Procedure:** One pill each from SCP-876-71 (lutetium), SCP-876-75 (rhenium), SCP-876-37 (rubidium), SCP-876-57 (lanthanum), SCP-876-62 (samarium), SCP-876-78 (platinum), SCP-876-64 (gadolinium), SCP-876-49 (indium), SCP-876-72 (hafnium), SCP-876-76 (osmium), SCP-876-60 (neodymium), SCP-876-48 (cadmium), and SCP-876-23 (vanadium) are extracted and bisected with a laser.\n**Result:** The samples of lutetium, rhenium, rubidium and lanthanum are pure Lu-175, Re-185, Rb-85, and La-139. The platinum sample showed no Pt-190, and the samarium sample showed no Sm-147 but contains the less radioactive Sm-148, as well as other naturally occurring isotopes. All other samples are consistent with terrestrial composition.\n**Notes:** //Apparently there is an upper limit to which the pills define an isotope to be radioactive (currently estimated to be 10^^13^^ years). -Dr. ████//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
