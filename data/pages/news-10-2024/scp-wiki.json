This event, similar to SCiPtember, is all about reading articles with specific tags or in some cases, specific articles instead, and creating art about them. This year mostly features specific articles, however. For a complete list of the articles and other information regarding SCPtober, head on over to their website [http://scptober.wikidot.com/2024 here]!\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts! Every month there will be user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. \n\nThis month's prompts are below! \n\n[[size x-large]]The Nazca Lines[[/size]] //Submitted by Mister_Toasty//\nPeru's most famous and mysterious tourist attraction hasn't received much attention in the SCP universe. Let's change that.\n\n[[size x-large]]The Comeback Kid[[/size]] //Submitted by PinkHatPinkJeans//\nWrite something starring a character who’s only appeared in one other article before.\n\nIf you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month's prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn't a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month's prompts as well! [[footnote]]Please note that in the event of an official contest, contest entries that were inspired by a Site News prompt will be featured the month after the contest ends.[[/footnote]]\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Seminars\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size x-large]]Critclub!
