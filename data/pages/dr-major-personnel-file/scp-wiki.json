He subsequently served for 5 years in the armed forces of ████████. Dr. Major was brought to Foundation attention during the events of Incident ███-2 (involving first recorded contact with SCP-███) in which, with the rank of major, he was the medical and scientific observer for a platoon of ████████ special forces. \n\nDuring Incident ███-2, [DATA EXPUNGED] leading to the neutralisation of all ████████ troops save Dr. Major, who survived due to the intervention of Foundation personnel. Standard Class A amnesiac procedure was overruled by Agent ████, the ranking Foundation officer on site, who recommended Dr. Major as a possible asset to the Foundation.

I joined this site in the early days of 2009 and wrote a few articles, but went inactive for a couple of years, due to changing RL circumstances and running out of ideas. \n\nI came back a few years later and wrote a few more articles, but went inactive for a couple of years, due to... well, you can guess. \n\nA few months ago I had a look at some of the newer articles and got hooked again seeing the different themes and writing styles the site has gone through, and wrote some more stuff. Maybe I'll try to write for longer this time, but if not, based on my previous history you can expect a new batch of articles in 2020.\n\nMy education/work background is in medical science and the health industry. I enjoy history, sci-fi, PC games, travelling and long walks on the beach.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n++ Database Information\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Projects Supervised]]\n* [[[SCP-516]]] - Intelligent Tank\n* [[[SCP-535]]] - Communicative Beaker\n* [[[SCP-606]]] - 'The Teacher'\n* [[[SCP-901]]] - The Building on the Square\n* [[[SCP-800]]] - An Eastern History\n* [[[SCP-505]]] - Ink Stain\n* [[[SCP-1022]]] - Suspiciously Clean Coat\n* [[[SCP-1221]]] - Unidentified Bus\n* [[[SCP-1101]]] - An Interesting Topic\n* [[[SCP-3205]]] - Adventure Tourist\n* [[[SCP-3322]]] - Sister Cities\n* [[[SCP-3925]]] - It's All Papers and Forms\n* [[[SCP-3497]]] - Backfiring Birds\n* [[[SCP-3968]]] - Immoral Minefield\n* [[[SCP-3978]]] - The World Is Going Away\n* [[[SCP-3891]]] - Paradise Lost and Found\n* [[[SCP-3952]]] - Flying Ace\n* [[[SCP-3656]]] - Governments in Exile\n* [[[SCP-3298]]] - Miss Connection\n* [[[SCP-3320]]] - Ethical Relativity\n* [[[SCP-3919]]] - In Memoriam\n* [[[SCP-4848]]] - Cross of Iron\n* [[[SCP-4995]]] - Übermensch\n* [[[SCP-4422]]] - O Tempestas, O Mores\n* [[[SCP-4985]]] - High Finance\n* [[[SCP-4919]]] - Belle Époque\n* [[[SCP-5013]]] - Old, Unhappy, Far-Off Things\n* [[[SCP-5919|Apartment 5919]]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Documentation Authored]]\n* [[[The Last Man]]] - based on [[[SCP-2399]]] ([[*user djkaktus]])\n* [[[Countdown]]] - based on [[[SCP-3034]]] ([[*user The Great Hippo]])\n* [[[Where Is This Going?]]] - based on [[[SCP-3925]]] ([[*user ModernMajorGeneral]])\n* [[[Five Minutes to Midnight]]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Personal Archive]]\nHere is my list of things on the site that I like for my reference (in no particular order) and as recommendations.
