The Russian Outer Ring Exploratory Company has already been alerted of and assented to these proceedings.

In Ibeiqia, where they once lived at peace under the canopies and carved out homes from the giant mushrooms, the successive thaumic chaos of the deicide and the Sealing cast a malignant undeath over their forest home.\n@@ @@\nThe fungi are now the overlords of these forest-dwelling gnomes, what remains of their homes and shops and town squares overgrown with rotting biomass and their shambling corpses animated only by roots of mycelium to further spread the spores of contagion. Ex-Russian colonial cities were abandoned when the Veil began, allowing the epidemic to spread to them as well. Now the streets I walk are empty and filled with the stench of decay, the only few survivors having fled to the deepest caves or the tops of the highest trees. \n@@ @@\nI am fortunate to have not been consumed by the infection outright upon discovering it when I arrived at the shores of Ibeiqia, for the fungal plague only feeds upon the already-deceased.

Their influence can be felt across the whole of Earth, from the kingdoms, city-states and principalities of Europe and Isea, to the vast expanses of the Asian steppe and the Pleostrian wilds, to the wilds of Yazoya, Australia, Australis, and Sahul, as well as in much of the Library. The Mountebanks offer demonic bargains on a scale and with a level of syndicated coordination unheard of for any organization of terrestrial fiend-bloods, particularly considering such mortals must divinatively locate and translocate to their targets manually without the privileges of tartarean planarity. Those among their ranks will often wash up in the Library bearing great tales -- often, but not always fabricated -- of past deeds and bargains made, not to mention silver-tongued promises of what could be offered to a prospective wanderer, aiming to swindle them into a favorable deal.\n\nThe home of the Mountebanks is a desolate territory inland with only a few coastal cities, where sulfuric mountains are mined for brimstone and mercury as demons emerge from their calderas and settle by the blackened sea. It is said those who pawn their spirits to the Mountebanks are reborn in one of the combusting mountains as a fiend of Tartarus themselves, being forced to work in their new unlife for the native entities in their hives and elsewhere in their ashen homeland.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #004F00; background:#FFFDD9; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n//\"The shaitan defrauders arrived in my court carrying all manner of treasures and unholy splendor from their forsaken bargains.

The only documentation of Telug I have access to is a clipping from a tome of a Serpent's Hand precursor organization from around the time of the Sealing, describing it as the operating base of a mercurial and potentially-threatening Group of Interest with often multiversal reach -- I had never heard of the so-called Mountebanks, but notes appended by Extradimensional Relations apparently indicate they're still out and about, a major thorn in our side to this day.\n@@ @@\nIf this source is to be believed, the Brimstone Hills of the Second Ring haven't changed much in the past hundred-odd years. The Sealing, as intended, saw a considerable drop in tartarean contact with mortals in the Prime Earth, but if the wanderers are to be believed, they could have made up for it by continuing their forays into the Library and scattering across the Ways for new targets. In any event, we're probably seeing one of the longest-standing continuous civilizations in Greater Earth still going strong, and nobody on our side of the Sealing Bound -- not the Foundation or the GOC or any equivalent body -- has even bothered to check up on them or the threat they pose.\n@@ @@\nWe've been to the stars and back since 1881, but I'm beginning to realize how much we neglected the potential threats on our own doorstep in that time by insisting to lock them out and us from them both ways. In many cases, occult continents and civilizations in outlying dimensionalities of our own world were and remain more distant and obscure than any distant planet or star. All the Sealing did was exaggerate this; the Foundation has bases on the Moon and on Mars, but not one in even the First Ring, and that was intended by design when the Veil was signed into existence. And in those places we abandoned and overlooked, there were already empires as vast in scale as China or as dynamic and commercially-influential as Britain or France. //That// was in 1881 -- how advanced are they now? If you look between the creases and the folds of old mages' maps, once in a blue moon you'll see things that would be a security threat greater than anything or anyone terrestrial the Foundation deals with; They could still be out and at large today, and we would have no way of knowing.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://lounge.hexick.com/uploads/0a423dea78e5984d/image.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Bermuda Ultima[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 2022 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n+ [[size 160%]]##80FF80|CCRU##[[/size]]\n\nThe hyperstitional parageographic exclave now known as Bermuda Ultima was discovered by polymath Daniel Charles Barker on an expedition intended to uncover archaeological remnants of Lemurian temporal eigenweapons in 1977. The unique feature of this location is an unintentionally-created hypersigil spanning the entire land area of the island, causing the patagenetic insertion of narrative devices representing anomalous persons, objects, and phenomena. All manifestations that appear in Bermuda Ultima are concepts obscured via fictionalization by the SCP Foundation, a massively-accelerative spectacular Cold God entity sovereign over the majority of physical paranormal reality.

But after the instantiation of that ritual, and more pressingly of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6460/offset/2 Project Pantheon], massive noetic shifts in Prime caused the paranormal waste products of the Veil to be dumped here and fueled a dormant narrative anomaly, giving rise to a new land where all the fictions and false truths spread by the perpetuation of normalcy become real.\n@@ @@\nNever before has such an event been recorded by Foundation pataphysicians or misinformation noetics specialists to my best knowledge.
