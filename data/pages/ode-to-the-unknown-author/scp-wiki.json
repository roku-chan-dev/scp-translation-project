What we know and love today started out with a [[[scp-173|single creepypasta]]] on 4chan's /x/ board before moving over to EditThis, and finally coming to rest here on Wikidot. However, a lot of things get lost when one moves, and that includes the original attributions for some of the site's most prolific works. \n\nIt is on this page where we thank them for contributing to a project they likely don't even know is still going strong over a decade later. We hope to find the original authors with the help of the recently found [https://archive.org/details/4chan_threads_archive_10_billion 4chan archive], but some may regrettably be forever lost to history. Though their names be lost, their contributions will forever be remembered by us.\n\nBelow you will find a list of articles written by an Unknown Author. \n----\n= [[size 80%]]Please refrain from editing the list below!
