Papa gets upset when she doesn't. But it's such a nice day! And she hasn't gotten to explore in a while! Besides, Papa and those weird guys were all busy!\n\nShe listens to the birds chirping in the distance as branches bend slightly in the cool breeze. Evening sun filters through the canopy, speckling the forest floor with patches of light. A chill rushes through her small body as she notices the late hour. She should really be getting home before Papa has to come to find her.\n\nStopping her adventure, she takes a moment to observe her surroundings. Everywhere she looks, unfamiliar woods span into the distance, causing uneasy nerves to rise in her throat. Papa's going to yell at her when she gets back. \n\nWhich way did she come from? \n\nShe picks a direction and walks. \n\nAnd walks. \n\nAnd walks. \n\nAnd walks. \n\nThe moonlight flickering through the canopy isn't enough to illuminate the ground beneath her feet by the time she accepts she might be lost. Shadows move above her, the distinct //chi, chi, chi// repeating endlessly, attempting to swallow her. \n\nA shiver races down her spine as the shadows dance around her. With her throat closing around her nerves, she braces herself and starts walking once more. Leaves crunch under her shoes while branches and bushes whip past her. A root comes up to trip her and it's only luck that keeps her from falling. \n\nHer blood runs cold as the feeling of being watched lands squarely on her back. //Chi, chi, chi.// Something brushes against her clothes, vanishing halfway through the act. Breathing heavily, she searches for the cause. \n\nThere's nothing she can see. \n\nSwallowing thickly, she forces her attention back on the path ahead â€” or, well, where she thinks there may be a path. There are fewer trees in this direction. \n\nThe //crunch, crunch, crunch// of her footfalls almost succeeds in pulling her attention away from the gaze boring into her back. No matter what she does, she can't shake the feeling. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// A yelp tears from her throat as her heart pounds in her chest; she only just holds back the urge to run. It's not going to help. At most, she trips and breaks a leg. \n\nBushes rustle beside her, and her breath catches in her throat as she falls silent. Maybe if she just stands still, it'll forget about her and go away. \n\nA growl sounds from the bushes. Something brushes against her, disappearing into the shadows long before she can put a shape to the shadow. Growls, yelps, and the tearing of flesh break through the silence. \n\nShe runs with her blood pounding in her ears.\n\nAnd runs with the branches slicing into her skin. \n\nAnd runs with the hope she won't run into a tree. \n\nAnd trips. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// \n\nWith her heart plummeting into the ground, she scrambles up, hoping that wasn't her last chance. Footfalls sound behind her, but she doesn't dare look back. Blood pounds in her ears as her feet pound the ground. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// No! It can't get her! She wants to go home! \n\nCloser still come footfalls only just above a whisper. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// There's hot breath on her neck and moisture left behind.\n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// She trips, and pain cuts into the panic as she lands roughly on the ground. Her skin splits, spilling sticky red across the darkened ground. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi.// Wet, hot breath pants over her, causing her to scream as she scrambles away from the shadow above her. \n\n\"I- I need a break.\" Oh, gods. That's going to be the last thing she ever says. She's going to die because she was stupid enough to get lost. \n\nTears prick at her eyes as the glint of fang appears before her. She's not going to get home. Low, dangerous growls pierce the otherwise silent night. The fangs grow closer as she trembles in the oddly bright moonlight.\n\n//Chi, chi, chi.//\n\nShe backs up, scraping her hands on the ground as she goes. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi.//\n\nHer back hits the rough bark of a tree. She wants Papa.\n\n//Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi.//\n\nSwallowing painfully, she closes her eyes and accepts whatever fate has in store for her. \n\n//Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi. Chi, chi, chi --//\n\nA warm breeze slices through the chill. She feels a tug in the pit of her stomach, familiar and welcoming.\n\n\"Thank you for bringing her home, noble beast.\" Tears fall from her eyes when Papa's strong hand lands on her shoulder. \"For your efforts.\" She smells rice. A happy bark fills her ears before the rice is taken away. \n\n\"You worried me, Shiko.\" Hot tears cut tracks across her dirt-encrusted cheeks as she's picked up and pulled close. \"I thought I told you not to go so deep into these woodlands.\" \n\n\"'M sorry...  I didn't mean to; I just wanted to explore.\" She buries her face in his chest. \"I thought I saw monsters in the woods. Monsters aren't real, right, Papa?\"\n\nHis warm embrace envelops her, a safe haven from the dangers of the world. He steps them into the warm safety of their interdimensional home. She's always safe with Papa around.\n\n\"My dear child. Monsters are very, very real.\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
