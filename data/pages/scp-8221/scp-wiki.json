Despite the number of human hosts growing exponentially since ~33 AD (Following event Câ€ ) the number of human souls has remained roughly around 800 million.\n\nThis suggests that while true human consciousness is bound to a finite number of reincarnating souls, a considerable and growing amount of the population is being animated by an unknown force and/or deific entity. Furthermore, long-term post-mortem studies indicate that several thousand of the original souls have failed to reincarnate, instead remaining as posthumous anomalies or perishing due to exorcisms. (roughly 0.00015% of souls a year.)\n\n**Notable Findings:**\n\n* Cognitive and theological profiling of a global sample (N=100,000) suggests that a statistically significant percentage of individuals lack the expected hallmarks of sapient self-awareness. (This includes roughly 63% of SCP Foundation personnel.) While they appear normal, they show clear differences in deep-memory retention.\n* At current birth rates, Foundation projections estimate that by 2150, the number of humans piloted by souls will be outnumbered 5:1.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n* Immediate classification of this phenomenon as SCP-8221 (Object Class: Keter) for continued research and monitoring.\n* Expanded cognitive testing across Foundation personnel to assess operational risks.\n* Research into the creation or revival of human souls.\n* Attempt deicide should the number of sapient individuals reach 0.01% of the human population.\n* Establish changes to normalcy in the event that the human species is no longer the primary intelligence inhabiting its own civilization.\n\n[[>]]\n- Tiana Mark Roseanne, Tact.
