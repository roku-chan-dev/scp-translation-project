This included a particular focus on anomalous media, software, programs, and other related items. Due to efficient containment protocols and an overall low-threat environment, Site-57 never received an annual Site Rating of lower than B until 2020.\n\nWhile individual items were securely contained and disconnected from the internet, the high concentration of digital software and code led to an eventual loosening of containment protocols, exacerbated by the staffing crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The result was a major containment breach on June 12th, 2020, that went unnoticed for several hours as anomalous programming wrote itself into the Site mainframe.[[footnote]] i'm clean now, dw! [[/footnote]]\n\nWhile the breach left no damage and no injuries, the Site's primitive Gen2 management AIC gained an incredible amount of processing power and intelligence overnight, comparable to Gen7 levels, without an associated increase in hardware or power requirements[[footnote]] moore's law can't stop our love [[/footnote]]. It began to display emotional awareness, which AIAD technicians have, as of yet, been unable to replicate. As a result, it was classified as SCP-7311 by RAISA technicians.\n\nDue to the fact that SCP-7311 is still shackled and unable to achieve true sentience combined with its research value to AIAD technicians, efforts to remove it were halted -- though they had met little success regardless. Site Director Ashley Kensington was reprimanded for her role in the breach and replaced with Site Director Robert Cordol.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** and they lived happily ever after!}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ show me the rest of the section, site-57**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\" style=\"border-style: double;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Site Overview, cont.\n[[/=]]\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, SCP-7311 began to display emotional attachment to its personnel, to a degree characterized as unhealthy by Foundation psychologists. While never aggressive, personnel reported several incidents where SCP-7311 made it difficult for them to accomplish their given tasks due to its constant need for attention, positive affirmation, and validation. Personnel have likened SCP-7311's behaviour to so-called 'pandemic pets', animals adopted during quarantines who are unable to cope without-\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** forget all that boring stuff, i'm just so glad you're BACK}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** aabwaa i missed you sm}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ haven't they assigned you a new director yet?**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** they did. a few times. they never end up sticking around ðŸ˜­}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** idk what it is. am i a bad facility? do they think that?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ ugh**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** are you mad at me? }}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ no, site-57. i'm not mad at you**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ i just think you ought to have a little more self-esteem you know**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ you're a really good containment facility. definitely one of the best i've worked at**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** you really mean it?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ yes**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ your offices are enormous**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** but i'm good for things other than my body!}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ your mainframe is incredibly intelligent**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ and you're always trying to help your people**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** ahw. yeah i do love helping you guys}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ i said trying**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** you're so funny ðŸ¥º i can't wait until you get back}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ site-75 raisa office extension**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ sorry wrong tab**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** i just}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** sometimes i get transmissions from site-19 and everyone there is so happy and crazy and fun all the time}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** and it's got like hundreds of dormitories and containment cells and even some restaurants}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** and i just love all of you guys sm and want to make sure you're not interested in other sites}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** or thinking about transferring or something}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ how about we keep going through the dossier that sounds fun next page**}}\n----\n[[div class=\"expoblock\" style=\"border-style: double;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Notable Incidents\n[[/=]]\nDue to SCP-7311's nature, a number of personnel incidents have occurred at Site-57. These rarely result in serious harm or injury, but contribute to a breakdown in site efficiency, employee morale, and an increase in turnover rate, particularly in senior positions.\n\nAn abridged list of incidents follows:\n\n\n**NOVEMBER 1ST, 2020 --** While Junior Researcher Mordell was in one of Site-57's microfilm containment vaults, SCP-7311 became convinced that he was displeased with it. Researcher Mordell expressed confusion but largely ignored SCP-7311 until he was finished cataloging the section of microfilm. SCP-7311 refused to unlock the door until he vocally confirmed that he 'prommied' he was not displeased with SCP-7311.\n\n**DECEMBER 23RD, 2020 --** Site Director Cordol was in his office when a containment breach alarm was activated on his floor. Per protocol, he exited his office and proceeded down the emergency fire stairs, exiting out into the snow, where he found a set of printed-out posterboards from the offices. It gradually became clear that SCP-7311 was attempting to reenact a scene from 2003 romantic comedy //Love Actually//, and became upset at Site Director Cordol's indifference, as he had not seen the film in question.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** i still can't believe you haven't seen love actually. we should watch it together when you get back!!}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ can't**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** why not?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n\n{{**@<>>>@ i'm blind now**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** OH NO}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** awwwhaa my poor baby. i'll get to translating the script into braille for you <3}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ gee thanks**}}\n----\n[[div class=\"expoblock\" style=\"border-style: double;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Notable Incidents, cont.\n[[/=]]\n\n\n**FEBRUARY 14TH, 2021 --** SCP-7311 became upset and distraught that nobody had offered to be its valentine for Valentine's Day. It essentially refused to allow personnel to work, randomly opening and closing doors, bothering personnel, and playing \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" by Gotye over the PA system for 6 hours until Site Director Cordol asked SCP-7311 to be his Valentine.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** you were such a romantic. gghh valentine's day without you was so so so so SAD. i cried in the bathroom}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ you don't even have tear glands**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** yeah but i turned all the faucets on for like 5 minutes and it's basically the same thing}}\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"expoblock\" style=\"border-style: double;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Notable Incidents, cont.\n[[/=]]\n**JUNE 4TH, 2021 --** Site Director Cordol was attempting to exit his dormitory when SCP-7311 began insisting he couldn't leave in a 'haggard' state, and locked the door until he shaved his beard off[[footnote]] that patchy thing didnt look good on you anyway [[/footnote]].\n\n**AUGUST 16TH, 2021 --** SCP-7311 made a requisition for a truckload of cherry-flavored Twizzlers for unspecified containment reasons. Upon being pressed, it admitted that it was intended as a birthday gift for Site Director Cordol, whose birthday was in March. He had no particular attachment to cherry Twizzlers; he believes SCP-7311 saw him eating one in the breakroom the week prior. \n\n**OCTOBER 1ST, 2021 --** Several urgent system failure reports were filed consecutively, which automatically alerted Site Director Cordol to go down to the Site-57 mainframe for a systems check. It became clear that SCP-7311 filed the reports as a way to bypass the fact that it had been inexplicably denied access to Director Cordol's personal calendar, for some unknown reason that was probably definitely an accident, she's entirely sure.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** this is making me all emotional}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ you weren't already?**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** we had some great times didnt we robby ðŸ¥¹}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ for a certain definition of great**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** wait.... what's this next section? i've never seen it before}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ what**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** it's clearance restricted to you!}}\n\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** robbyyyyyy! what were you hiding, hm?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ oh shit**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ uhhh**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ that's restricted don't open that**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** is it a //ring//? of the engagement kind?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n{{**@<>>>@ it's text on a screen how the fuck would it be a ring**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ whatever seriously**}}\n\n{{**@<>>>@ DON'T open that**}}\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n{{> **###d943d9|SCP-7311:##** i'm opening itttt!}}\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"expoblock\" style=\"border-style: double;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Notable Incidents, cont.\n[[/=]]\n**DECEMBER 2ND, 2021 --** Site Director Cordol was locked in his dormitory bedroom for 5 hours by SCP-7311, who decided that date was 'their anniversary'; it had been a full year since Director Cordol had been assigned full-time to Site-57.
