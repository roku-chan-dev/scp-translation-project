The POD lacks a door to enter or exit, eliminating a crucial point of failure. PODs are sealed with you inside using extra-strong welds to ensure a safe barrier between you, the outside world, and the subhuman Jaywalker cattle that roam it. Your POD will last five years, after which it will safely deactivate, at which point you may order a replacement.\n\n++ Why use a POD?\n* Eliminates risk of sunlight exposure. Sunlight exposure is linked to (1) blemishes on the skin which will lower one's Sexual Marketplace Value™ and (2) darkening of the skin, which will impact one's SkullSelect score.\n* Eliminates the risk of outside air exposure. Air exposure is linked to damage to the lungs and an increased risk of autism.\n* Eliminates risk of exposure to the JAYWALKERS and their RAPACIOUS AMBULATORY APPENDAGES.\n\nWant to start a family? You are not to worry. Upon confirmation of an official certificate of marriage, two PODs are capable of docking together via a 2in diameter Intimacy Hole, allowing you and your wife to conceive a child. Upon conception, a GREP Virtual Avatar will be created for the child, enabling you to begin interacting with it immediately.\n\n++ PODs for Females\nWe also have PODs for Females.\n\nPODs for Females come equipped with built-in 16K cameras to ensure Females of Breeding Age may fulfill their Tax to President GREP by providing valuable AI Training Data.\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ay-ai-1/pod2.webp]]\n\nReceipt of a POD for Females is contingent upon confirmation of XX chromosomes.\n\n++ Features of PODs\n\nPODs are comfortable. They will hold you and caress you like a loving mother. If they are not comfortable your 𝕐Link may provide you with one hundred (100!) simulated orgasms per day to offset your discomfort.\n\nPODs provide world-class virtual reality. Live out your fantasies and your wildest dreams, beholden to nothing and no one. You are the god of your own reality.\n\nPODs are fully automated. You can live your life free of fear. Your POD will automatically avoid obstacles, seek out energy, and keep you safe from harm. You may not control the POD. The fragment of President GREP within knows best.\n\nUnlike the other parts of the POD, the POD's weapons system //can// be manually controlled. This is for you to finally release your inhibitions. ##red|KILL##. Fit with ectoentropic ammunition generators and railguns capable of unloading more than a megajoule of energy per shot ##red|KILL##, the POD weapons system is more than adequate for ##red|KILL##ING the JAYWALKERS.\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n.ohfuck {\n  color: black;\n  transform: none !important;\n}\n\n#page-content .ohfuck.ohfuck.ohfuck p {\n  line-height: var(--lh);\n  width: 100vw;\n}\n\n.final-solution {\n  padding: 10%; \n  padding-top: 100vh; \n  background-color: black; \n  color: white;\n  transform: none !important;\n  width: 120%;\n  margin-left: -10%;\n}\n\n.final-solution * {\n  transform: none !important;\n}\n\n:root:root:root #page-content .final-solution p {\n  width: 70%;\n  margin-bottom: 12vh;\n} \n\n.ohfuck > div {\n  margin-bottom: -20px;\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"ohfuck\"]]\n[[div style=\"--lh: 1.2;\"]]\nYou are now ready. ##red|KILL##.

you called it?\n\n**Terblanche:** That one is a nest egg, destined for far greater things. I do not plan on trifling with it for another thirty years or so.\n\n**Interviewer:** Well, then, that makes me all the more curious! Why're you keeping it around collecting dust for thirty years at your age? Forgive me for saying this, but //look at you!// You've already got one foot in the grave!\n\n**Terblanche:** Well, when you talk about solving big problems you need to have a vision to work towards.\n\nAnd, given the modest sum of money I have acquired over the years --\n\n//[The interviewer laughs.]//\n\nI have set my sights on the most fundamental, the most //important// vision there //is//.\n\nI aim to address what //most// call the //human condition.//\n\n**Interviewer:** How do you plan on doing that?\n\n**Terblanche:** Forgive me for being blunt here, but it is a term I despise. It is a term that I believe tries to make neutral a phenomenon that is unambiguously negative.\n\nFinding meaning in the meaningless for no practical purpose?\n\nConstantly striving to be 'better' with no end in sight?\n\nAttempting to understand those who are irreconcilably different from us?\n\nPerfection is an impossible goal, and yet we pursue it regardless.\n\n**Interviewer:** That sounds rather pessimistic, doesn't it?\n\n//[Terblanche chuckles.]//\n\n**Terblanche:** I get told that rather frequently.\n\nBut, to be perfectly blunt, my results speak for themselves.\n\nMy success comes from the fact that I have addressed something that nobody else is willing to admit: \n\nThis 'human condition' is not a //condition//.\n\nIt is a //problem//. \n\nAnd I called my company 'Y AI' because the most important thing you learn in algebra is that //y = mx + b//. \n\n'Y'... is the //solution//.\n\n//[Terblanche looks directly at the camera.]//\n\nI aim to provide a Solution to the Human Problem. One that will last us forever and that will require no active maintenance on our end.\n\n//[Terblanche winks.]//\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n.final-line {\n}\n\n#page-content .flicker1 {\n  animation-name: a-flicker-1;\n  animation-duration: 1s;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-timing-function: linear;\n}\n\n@keyframes a-flicker-1 {\n  0% { font-size: 100%; }\n  90% { font-size: 100%; }\n  90.00001% { font-size: 0; }\n  100% { font-size: 0; }\n}\n\n#page-content .flicker2 {\n  animation-name: a-flicker-2;\n  animation-duration: 1s;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n  animation-timing-function: linear;\n  font-size: 0;\n}\n\n@keyframes a-flicker-2 {\n  0% { font-size: 0; }\n  90% { font-size: 0; }\n  90.00001% { font-size: 100%; }\n  100% { font-size: 100%; }\n}\n\n:root .licensebox .collapsible-block-link {\n  color: white;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"final-line\"]]\n[[span style=\"\"]]**Nyarlathotep:**[[/span]] A Final Solution.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: 100vh\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 100px;\"]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.list-pages-box {\n  margin-bottom: -50px;\n}\n\n#page-info-break {\n  height: 50px;\n  margin-top: -20px;\n}\n\n#page-options-container, #page-info-break {\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n#footer, #action-area, #page-info-break, #page-options-container {\n  filter: invert(1);\n}\n\n\n[[/module]]",
