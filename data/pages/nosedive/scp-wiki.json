There was great controversy when the Foundation transitioned from opiates and chloroform to Y-909, and there will be controversy again when the Foundation inevitably moves past ATZAK-derived amnestics [[footnote]]For instance, see the 2019/09/16 Ethics Committee meeting on pausing auxiliary ATZAK PROTOCOL funding.[[/footnote]]. --Already, senior researchers have begun voicing opposition to the Rhizome Experimental Compound, basing their claims on unfounded hearsay.-- Therefore, in order to ensure that Project Rhizome has enough momentum to eventually become the basis of newer-generation amnestics, an altered and targeted rollout strategy must be utilized instead.\n\nThe first stage of this proposed rollout strategy is the implementation of Rhizome-based Class-A, -B, and -C amnestics on a per-project, per-SCP basis. Amnestics Department liaisons affiliated with Project Rhizome will attempt to persuade head [[span style=\"opacity: 0.65;\"]]researchers of the importance of using[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.6;\"]]amnestics based on the Rhizome compound,[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.55;\"]]and facilitate[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.5;\"]]the development[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.4;\"]]of new[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.3;\"]]amnestic[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.2;\"]]therapies[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.1;\"]]dependent on[[/span]] [[span style=\"opacity: 0.05;\"]]Project Rhizome[[/span]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n= {{DEPARTMENT OF AMNESTICS | DRAFT DOCUMENT}}\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Date:** 2019/12/08\n**To:** Tabitha Ingram <tabitha.ingram29@scip.net>\n**From:** Eve Amber Patel <evea.patel@scip.net>\n**Subject:** Re: Calling in that favor\n[[/div]]\n----\nTabby,\n\nEthics has a copy of Juan's resignation letter stored locally, but it's above the clearance of mid-level liaisons like me. The only thing I could find is that he seemed to have been involved with the Site Director's office, and submitted the letter to Director Graham directly. Afterwards, someone on the committee stuck their neck out for Juan and spirited him away from Site-17 on short notice. I'd do more digging, but my superiors are probably keeping the whole thing under wraps for a good reason.\n\nI had a bit more success with the Reintegration Committee records (attached). They're currently being reformatted by RAISA, so you‚Äôre not the only person who‚Äôs had problems with access. There hasn't been an update in nearly a year, so you should get in touch with Hasan Amir (hasan.amir@scip.net), because he's either not doing his job or he's giving a soft red light by not moving the case forward.\n\nFinally, about SCP-6113. All I can tell you is that SCP-6113-3 (Chloe) was abducted during a containment breach. Everything else is above your clearance, unfortunately. I don't think I need to tell you that you shouldn't share this with Andrew.\n\nAll that said, I‚Äôve read through your notes. The fact that Andrew lost both Chloe and Juan so recently seems to be affecting him greatly, and I encourage you to keep talking about those subjects, if only to find some sort of closure. Might I suggest you encourage Andrew to socialize in the common areas more? I know that he still has Anthony, but he really needs to make another friend.\n\nEve\n//she/they//\n//Ethics Subcommittee for Humanoid Entities//\n\n‚ÄÇ‚ÄÇüñáÔ∏è {{[# ao1434ReintCase2019.pdf]}}\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Chapter Five: Thought Patterns\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nIt is common for patients in containment to feel decreased motivation for tasks and routines, even in the absence of depression. While prior sections of this worksheet focused on behavioral interventions, it is equally important to restructure our cognitive responses to containment, as we find that our thought patterns often precede and negatively influence our behaviors.\n\nConsider the following question:\n> \"Why should I bother doing anything when I‚Äôm going to be in containment for the rest of my life?\"\n\nWhen we‚Äôre faced with negative thoughts like the example above, we often attempt to respond combatively, which can result in a negative spiral. Instead, consider these responses:\n\n* \"I am not going to be in containment for the rest of my life.\" ‚Äì This is an ever-probable outcome as the Foundation continues to develop new pathways to reintegrate humanoid anomalies into public life. In fact, preparing oneself to be fit for reintegration provides a concrete and achievable goal for many patients in containment.\n\n* \"I can still accomplish a lot even in containment.\" ‚Äì It is true that your life circumstances are far from ideal, but remember that Foundation staff are trained to help you, even if your anomalous effects render you incompatible with outside society. Consider the case of SCP-5031, a formerly homicidal entity who was solely capable of sustained screaming and inflicting grievous injuries. After being mentored by one of our doctors, SCP-5031 is now a skilled chef renowned throughout the Foundation. Consider what resources you might require, and never hesitate to ask us for anything necessary for your wellbeing in containment.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Date:** 2019/12/16\n**To:** Tabitha Ingram <tabitha.ingram29@scip.net>\n**From:** Chaim Cannon <ccannon@scip.net>\n**CC:** Ryland John Hart <rjhart@scp.int>, Su Bai <su.bai58@scip.net>\n**Subject:** Re: AO-1434 containment review notice\n[[/div]]\n----\nDr. Ingram,\n\nThe Department of Humanoid Risk Assessment has reviewed your latest progress report regarding AO-1434.

Dr. Murphy of the Amnestics Department is to... is to test the efficacy of treating trauma, depression, and other mental health issues with Rhizome-based Class-C amnestics. If the results are sound, the subcommittee will consider broader authorization.\n\n**Researcher Bai:** This is unprecedented. Amnestics are used for security, not for treating mental illness.\n\n**Dr. Ingram:** I can't believe we're debating this.\n\n**Liaison Patel:** I want it on record, I disagreed with the subcommittee's conclusions, and-\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Enough! We are doctors, and we will act as such. Dr. Murphy, please explain your proposal.\n\n**Dr. Murphy:** Certainly. Unlike prior amnestics, our Rhizome compound allows us to not only target specific memories, but also the emotions, reflexes, attitudes, and other baggage associated with those memories. Erase a targeted moment, say the death of a friend, and we also erase the depression, anxiety, and trauma resulting from it. In AO-1434's case, its suicidality comes entirely from several traumatic recent events. If AO-1434 ceases to recall these events, then its current symptoms will also cease. Of course, we'd most likely want to erase //all// memories of persons involved with these traumas, for example SCP-6113-3, SCP-6546, and Dr. Luna. Otherwise, the brain might find ways to... burrow through our suppression.\n\n**Dr. Cannon:** I can see why Director Graham went to you, Dr. Murphy. This is excellent.\n\n**Dr. Ingram:** You're actually serious... you're going to erase everything. Do you know what Andrew has left after you rob him of all his time with the only people he's ever cared about? He'll have nothing. Nothing!\n\n**Dr. Murphy:** Dr. Ingram, the Foundation routinely erases larger periods of memory, and I can assure you that the Rhizome compound reduces the chances of full personality removal to near-zero.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Dr. Murphy, how completely does the Rhizome compound erase the memories themselves? Are they merely locked up, or do you scramble the neurons to destroy them altogether?\n\n**Dr. Murphy:** I... will admit that there is a slight chance of recall. Which is why our amnestic therapy also injects heightened suggestibility into the subconscious, allowing a trained psychologist to easily make the patient doubt any memories that remain. In the case of AO-1434, we already have a perfect alibi in the form of SCP-953. It should be easy enough to convince it that all its memories of Dr. Luna and the others merely came from the anomaly, and its internalization of that fact will do the rest.\n\n**Liaison Patel:** Murphy, I hope you've weighed the moral costs of wiping away //years// of Andrew's life.\n\n**Dr. Murphy:** Liaison, if I may be candid, I see no reason why this treatment is immoral when the alternative is AO-1434's potential death, or at the very least its continued suffering.\n\n//Dr. Hart clears his throat.//\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Dr. Murphy, you know that I have my own reservations about this casual use of amnestics. But if what you propose is genuinely effective, then we have an obligation to Andrew to see it through. Tabitha, I'm assigning you to evaluate Andrew's post-amnestic state. You will catalog the effects of the procedure, and work on psychologically eliminating recall of any residual memories.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Tabitha?\n\n**Dr. Ingram:** I'm not gaslighting Andrew into believing that his best friend was the invention of a fucking //fox//.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** I'm sorry Tabitha, but that's an order.\n\n**Dr. Ingram:** I'd rather resign.\n\n//Dr. Cannon chuckles.//\n\n**Dr. Cannon:** Do it.\n\n**Dr. Ingram:** //(Pauses)// What?\n\n**Dr. Cannon:** Write your letter of resignation.

Without even a farewell to 1434, no less. And all because of what? Because he saw something that hurt his feelings? Because he had to wade through the same shit as the rest of us?\n\n**Liaison Patel:** Cannon, that's enough.\n\n**Dr. Cannon:** I don't do my job because I enjoy it. Some days, I want to leave everything behind just as much as you do now. But I still show up and work my damnedest every day. Why? Because I- //we// have a responsibility.
