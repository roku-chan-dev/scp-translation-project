Daniel Navarro the anartist will officially be dead. Agent Navarro will take his place. That means that all of your former friends and colleagues will be POIs first, and friends second, if they can even still be considered friends at that point. Your signature here will burn a lot of bridges. Just… take a few seconds, at least, to consider if those are bridges you can afford to never cross again.”//\n> \n> //“And what, waste all this time we spent training?

The failsafe. God knows we train enough agents who don’t hit the brakes here when it would have been better for everyone if they did. Just take a second…”//\n> \n> //Navarro nodded and thought back to all of his friends from Portland, Jill, Tom, Alexis, Jackson, Jericho, Eric, Tanya, Francis, and Elizabeth.//\n> \n> //“Alright.

In exchange for serving as a double agent for the Foundation, Navarro avoided being amnesticized and in 2005 was officially employed as a Foundation agent, serving as an anart specialist and liaison between various anart groups. However, someone with as many connections as Agent Navarro doesn't simply join the Foundation without stepping on more than a few toes, and past actions are very quick to haunt him...\n-----\n* Part 1: [[[15-11-2012]]]\n* Part 2: [[[Meeting Over Coffee]]]\n* Part 3: [[[JTH]]]\n* Part 4: [[[The Templar Incident]]]\n* Part 5: [[[Bridges Burnt]]]\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
