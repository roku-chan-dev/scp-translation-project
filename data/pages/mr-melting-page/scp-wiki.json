Especially if you're who I think you are. I left your realm fair and square, //and I ain't going back!//\n\n...If you're //not// who I think you are, then hi! You can call me Melting or Neon, but pretty much any nickname would work as long as I know you're referring to me.\n\nI was born on a certain day in 2004, though my body has aged significantly faster than time should allow if the creaking of my joints is anything to go by. The only pronouns I use are he/him, and you //will// use them to refer to me because they took a lot of work to get.\n\n++* Isn't this an //author page?//\n\nWell, yeah, I was getting to that. Damn. Cool your tits.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Skips]]\n**[[[SCP-7361]]]** - It's Not Your Fault\n[[collapsible show=\"Thoughts\" hide=\"Stop thinking\"]]\n7361 holds a special place in my heart. It kinda sucks, I'll be the first to admit that, but it was my first. Not my first idea, no, that honor goes to a blackberry vine that grows in your veins that I lost the google doc to a few years ago. This idea was actually something I came up with while I was writing it, and...it shows.\n\nI won't rewrite it. Not any time soon, at least. I could do //so much better//, but for now I'll leave it as is. It's like baby steps; shaky and unsteady, but irreplaceable. I do want to do more with Seth Riers, but I've got nothing at the moment. Maybe I'll eventually write a tale on what he's getting up to. I don't know. Thumbs up emoji.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[SCP-7946]]]** - Jerahmeel\n[[collapsible show=\"Thoughts\" hide=\"Stop thinking\"]]\nI hate this /pos. It's a confusing, meandering mess, and not in a good way. I had fun making the gamebook, but //man//, have I learned a lot about Twine since then. Jerahmeel is actually from an older project I abandoned, and I feel bad I couldn't do them justice in this skip. Not even sure how I'd fix this without changing the whole thing.\n\nIt's not the worst thing I've ever done, of course. It //did// help me realize that I do way better when writing character-centric pieces. That's something. Plus, everyone has at least one sucky article, right?\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tails]]\n**[[[To Feel What You Feel]]]**\n[[collapsible show=\"Thoughts\" hide=\"Stop thinking\"]]\nWoah! A Gamers Against Weed tale that has some batshit insane spell I pulled out of my ass to fit a cute idea? Yep! I love GAW a whole lot, so I really wanted to write something for them. And when I randomly thought of this idea at work after reading [[[I Just Want To Get Away From Me]]], I got to writing!\n\nI was really worried I wrote them //wildly// out of character, but then I got two (!!) posts praising how I wrote them! It made me feel a lot more confident in myself. Haven't used that confidence yet; I'm saving it up for now.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Knockoff Yelp]]\nThis is where you can write on my page like a child with a pack of crayons in a millenial's sad beige home.\n\n{{^ first}} - Trout\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Is that it?]]\nWhat? My three pages weren't enough for you? Fine, fine. I have a [[[http://mrmeltingpoint.wikidot.com/|website]]] with more information about my off-site stuff. I'll add to this author page as I write more stuff, which according to my schedule, should be...mix together about 3/4 cup of brown sugar in a bowl with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger. Wait, what? Hang on, this is a recipe. I lost my schedule.\n\n...Oh well.\n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
