She was a mad display of contorted hair, tired eyes, and clothes that were last cleaned two nights ago. \n\nShe chose an isolated seat at an empty edge of the room and, with few in close proximity, she began eating her lunch.

People clapped and cheered in encouragement, watching on as he carefully steadied the fruit. When the apple fell to the floor they all erupted in disappointment.  \n\nElise chuckled at the sight quietly, being cautious not to alert anybody that she was watching. \n\nShe found herself losing interest, though, as the scene returned to normalcy.

You should've realized that sooner.//\"\n\nKessler shook his head slightly. \"It's not.. it isn't that.\"\n\n\"//It is.//\"\n\nJean quietly analyzed him, before slipping away from the computer and strutting out of the room without a word. Kessler was left standing there with nothing but the soft murmurs of security agents. \n\nAfter a few minutes of standing silently, he turned and left.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nA number of hours later and Kessler, seated at his desk and ruminating on the day's events so far, heard the phone ring. He gazed over dreadfully, listening to it ring before reaching over and bringing it to his ear.\n\n\"This is Doctor Kessler,\" he said.\n\n\"Kessler?\" A deep male voice came through the line. Kessler recognized it immediately.\n\n\"Yes, Director?\" His voice perked up.\n\n\"I've just heard about Doctor Hill. I'm sorry about what happened.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Uh, she was a, uh...\" Kessler paused, \"a shining star amongst us.\"\n\n\"Uh..\" There was some shuffling on the other end. \"I understand that she had clearance to access the new SCP. Her fob should've been deactivated.\"\n\nKessler sighed. \"She did an experiment with the SCP, I didn't figure to revoke her clearance until she left. It was still her main assignment, and--\"\n\nThe Director interrupted. \"--well, look, it's something you should've done. I also understand that she was a bit isolated in the workplace, would you say that factors into her behavior last night?\"\n\nHis grip on the phone tightened and his voice became hushed. \"..//uhm,// I... suppose so, yes.\"\n\n\"Were you aware of her social issues beforehand?\"\n\n\"To an extent. I didn't, uhm.. know her very well.\"\n\nThe director inhaled deeply and his voice became firm. \"So, why didn't you act?\"\n\nKessler's brows furrowed, he shook his head faintly. \"I--..\" He stuttered. \"I //did// act. I tried moving her.\"\n\n\"--it, evidently wasn't the right move,\" said the director. \"People are saying she was irrational because she was being moved. One of the representatives from the Ethics Committee called me and said he received a pretty detailed outline of what happened. //He wants to see something done.//\"\n\n\"Ethics Committee?\" Kessler nearly laughed at the Director's words. \"Just one representative, it doesn't matter //that// much, does it..?\"\n\nThere was another pause, and the director exhaled. \"Look, Kessler, the Site Ethics Evaluation is week after next and I can't risk this sort of thing right now. //They want someone to take the blame.//\"\n\nKessler's eyes widened. \"--but, wait.. what?\"\n\n\"Yeah.. Kessler, you've done a lot of good work but, uh..\" The director sighed. \"There's a real nice spot out at a research outpost in Antarctica. It's understaffed and I think you'd be better off there.\"\n\nKessler leaned forwards, \"Wait-.. but, that's not entirely necessary, I'll... how about I go to the representative myself and--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry Kessler, preparations are already underway for your moving. I've got my guys on the paperwork right now.\"\n\nThere was a long line of stutters from Kessler. He stared down at his desk with a shocked expression. \"--but, sir.. I... I //did// try to help her, I wasn't trying to hurt her I just.. I was going to talk to her about getting a psychologist, and I figured that moving her would be good for her, too, and..\"\n\n\"//Too little too late...//\" murmured the director. \"Kessler, I'll be honest with you, man.. you know how to handle spending and keep workers in line, but you're so //damn// naive when it comes to people. Get your things in your dormitory ready, the RD will see you off.\"\n\nThe phone hung up before Kessler could say anything else. \n\nHe stared ahead silently, listening to the repeated beep of the disconnected phone. His face had turned pale and his eyes were widened to their greatest extent. \n\nKessler gently placed the phone back in its place. He covered his face with his hands, leaning back and sitting in prolonged silence. \n\nHe was called to the RD's office three hours later.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[Image \nhttp://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/messyboi/Lone_Tree_on_Farmland_off_Enfield_Road_at_Sunset_-_geograph.org.uk_-_46481%281%29.jpg]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n//Kessler awakens.//\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nHis eyes flick open to a sky adorned with pink and red. He feels tall grass brushing against his side, and raises his head to gaze at the field he was laying in. \n\nStanding up, Kessler again sees the deer grazing by the apple tree. He analyzes it for a few moments, noticing a bloody gash going up its right thigh and wincing at the gory sight.\n\n//Thump.//\n\nAn apple falls between them, they both glance as it hits the ground. The deer notices Kessler and stares at him warily.\n\nHe slowly walks towards the apple, so the injured dear takes a defensive stance. Kessler reaches down and picks the apple from the ground. He takes a moment to observe the deer as he raises back up, looking at it with an inquisitive expression. The deer's ribcage is tight against its skin and its limbs are slim and lanky.\n\nThe animal remains locked in place. Kessler slowly reels his arm back to toss the apple toward it, but stops himself midway through and lowers his arm. \n\nHis eyes trail off toward the ground in thought. After a moment, he gazes back at the deer and holds the apple out in its direction.\n\nThe deer cautiously stares at his hand, and its mouth begins to slobber. Eventually, it begins moving towards Kessler, its gaze fixated to the fruit. Once close enough, it reaches its head out and bites into the apple with a noisy crunch.\n\nIt starts to slobber over the fruit, chomping through its core and eventually consuming it all. Kessler lowers his hand once the apple is gone, tilting his head at the animal. The deer takes a step back from Kessler and observes him more comfortably. \n\nAfter a moment of silence, Kessler's eyes begin to water and his expression sours with regret.\n\n\"//I'm sorry,//\" he murmurs, \"//I'm sorry I didn't do more to help.

It was a cramped space, with walls made of fiber padding to keep the cold out and a severe lack of decoration.\n\nKessler sat up and gazed tiredly through a small porthole beside his bed. Outside was harsh, with a menacing sky pelting down snow onto an infinite plane of ice.\n\nOut at the edge of the ice, though, there was a figure. Kessler squinted at it, reaching for his glasses on the adjacent nightstand and propping them up on his face.\n\nThrough the lens of his glasses he identified the figure, they disappeared the moment he recognized them. \n\nIt was a person with short, contorted blonde hair and big round glasses standing alone in the arctic plane. The woman held something to her chest, staring out at the ice with a sad expression on her face. \n\nKessler struggled to make out the object in her hand, but realized what it was once she disappeared.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n//Elise Meredith Hill held an apple to her heart.//\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:fade-in speed=1]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:midnight-rush]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Underground_blast_doors,_BC_corridor,_at_entry_to_building_501,_looking_west_-_Offutt_Air_Force_Base,_Strategic_Air_Command_Headquarters_and_Command_Center,_Command_Center,_901_SAC_HAER_NE-9-N-3.tif.jpg\n> **Name:** Underground blast doors, BC corridor, at entry to building 501, looking west - Offutt Air Force Base, Strategic Air Command Headquarters and Command Center, Command Center, 901 SAC HAER NE-9-N-3.tif\n> **Author:** Library of Congress (Unnamed NPS Worker)\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Underground_blast_doors,_BC_corridor,_at_entry_to_building_501,_looking_west_-_Offutt_Air_Force_Base,_Strategic_Air_Command_Headquarters_and_Command_Center,_Command_Center,_901_SAC_HAER_NE-9-N-3.tif\n\n> **Filename:** 281633.jpg\n> **Name:** Foglio protocollo a righe A4\n> **Author:** inkscapeforum.it [Note: NOT a link.
