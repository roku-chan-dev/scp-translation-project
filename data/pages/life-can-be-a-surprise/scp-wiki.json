Despite her eventual actions, and her abilities prior to the Vanishing, she was still quite immature for her age, as can be seen in her writing and prose. \n\nShe had a certain natural fondness for rhyme, but not necessarily for rhythm. The art style, however, was a conscious design choice.\n\nWe fared relatively well in the immediate aftermath of the Vanishing. But what followed took harsh tolls on us all.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"row\"]]\n[[=image noparents.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"row\"]]\n[[div class=\"column lc\"]]\n+++ My Mother\n\nWhen I woke up on Saturday, \nMy parents weren't there to play.\nMom had promised she'd teach me how \nTo do some magic with a bough.\n And dad would watch and smile and yawn\n After waking early to mow the lawn.\nThey weren't there, which wasn't odd—\nThey often left because of their jobs.\nAnd Rich, as always, had locked his door, \nWatching anime and porn. \nThey weren't back by midnight's fall\nSo I went to bed, no cares at all.\n\nOn Sunday, still, I was alone, \nso I made the day my own. \nI ran and played and skipped and pranced, \nAnd at the park my friends all danced. \nI gorged myself on sweet desserts \nUntil they made my tummy hurt. \nWhen I returned just past sundown, \nRich was waiting with a frown. \nThrough tears, he asked if I could say \nI'd seen a grown-up all that day. \nIt's then I realized this was bad. \nI started missing mom and dad. \n\nI'm really starting to feel their lack. \nI hope my parents will come back\n\n\n--Rhonda H.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"column\"]]\n++++ A Commentary by R. House\n\n\nOur mom was big on poetry, always said that the written word was a kind of magic of its own, which in retrospect was kind of sus. I guess it should've been obvious that she was a thaumaturge, like Rhonda.\n\nWe grew up so fast.\n\nI don't remember exactly what I did on that first day – it's been a long time, after all. \n\nI wasn't watching porn. I swear.\n\n--R.

House\nI suppose I thought I was clever by leaving the crossed-out \"Mister\" in. Looking back now, it seems kitsch. Foolish. Yet removing it would be a betrayal of who I was. A final erasure.\n\nWhoever Mister Beast was, whatever he may have meant to me before… he was a symbol of an era that's gone now, a time that can't exist any longer. The free internet back then was a wild west that we lost in the transition.\n\nRhonda was surprised, honestly, that I still watched him at my age, but in retrospect, sixteen isn't that old. Especially for all of our idols to evaporate overnight, leaving behind only digital ghosts.\n\nThirteen, indeed, is even younger.\n\n--R.

House\nWe didn't talk nearly as much as we should have, I think. \n\nIn the immediate aftermath, all we had were each other. We were surviving off of a week's worth of groceries. But even then we didn't talk about our emotions. We were focused much more on survival. The first Mission of the Global Occult Coalition -- I doubt anyone else alive even remembers who they were.\n\nOur house kept getting power and air conditioning and heating, so I guess nobody was around to turn those things off – but nobody was around to keep them on, either.\n\nI don't know how long we would've lasted if Director Thereven hadn't found us.\n\n--R.

House\nThe worst part was the survivor's guilt. In reflection, I was an angsty teen and my thoughts were excusable, normal even, but I didn't know that then.\n\nThere was a lot I didn't know.\n\nFortnite didn't even have looting. I think Rhonda told me that. I didn't play it more than once or twice.\n\nWe were thrown into adulthood. I had been rushing towards it as fast as I could, but once it was thrust upon me, it was more than I could bear. Who among us didn't dream of being free to rule ourselves? Yet once it happened, once we had no more choice… we weren't ready.\n\nI still don't feel ready, but I suppose that's imposter syndrome.\n\nThere were, of course, things I simply wasn't qualified to do. I was very lucky that my parents gave \"The Talk\" to Rhonda because I would not have been able to.\n\nGod, I miss them.\n\n--R.
