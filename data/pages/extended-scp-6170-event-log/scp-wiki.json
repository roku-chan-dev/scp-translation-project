This has resulted in the area gaining the ability to alter the cell-division cycle of organisms within it.

Due to the lack of checkpoints ensuring the integrity of the replicated DNA, mutations in the organism's genome occur far more often.

Gameplay is fairly basic and consists of using Agents to fight exponentially more difficult threats based on various anomalies.\n\nPlayers receive 1 free pull a day, but can pay $5 for an additional chance to \"pull\" Agents.

In fact, most Gamma-type individuals display more interest in the concept than before.\n* Beta-type Individuals and their opinions on space travel have been reversed, with the majority of them supporting it due to it being \"very beneficial\" and \"obviously the next step to human technology\". Conspiracy theories created by these individuals focus more on apocalyptic scenarios on earth, suggesting abandonment of the planet and travel into space as the only way to evade the events.\n* Alpha-type individuals now alarmingly try to hasten any Space travel project and operations, and will determinably suggest and plan projects that will transport a large portion humanity out of earth, sometimes without a destination. Most Alpha-type individuals are politicians or people at high-ranking positions in space traveling organizations.\n\nDue to the reported hostile changes of 200+ documented extraterrestrial/space-located anomalies caused by SCP-6170 and the discovery of [DATA EXPUNGED], containment procedures of SCP-2001 have been altered to prevent and stop any human space travel operation plans by any means necessary.//~ Rsr.

The panic was only further escalated when personnel testing with the object fired at a news broadcast, causing the public to believe that the newscaster had been shot live on television. SCP-674 has been placed in a locked containment box, and testing is no longer allowed until further notice. //~ Dr. Jerald Dino//\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nCLASSIFICATION\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nOBJECT CLASS\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[[SCP-7403]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nLegally Acquiesce\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC; text-align:center\"]]\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\"]]\n\nIn addition to its already dangerous bureaucratic effect, SCP-7403’s radiation now causes humans[[footnote]] Interestingly, this also applies to ‘offshoots’ of humanity such as [[[SCP-1000]]], [[[SCP-3199]]], and [[[[SCP-655 |DATA EXPUNGED]]]] [[/footnote]] to legally become employed in SCP-7403.

Multiple entrances to SCP-106's pocket dimension have manifested throughout the Site, facilitating the emergence of hostile entities designated as SCP-106-1 to 106-5. These instances exhibit formidable abilities akin to SCP-106, proving challenging to recontain.\n\nCharacteristics of the emerged instances are detailed as follows:\n\n**SCP-106-1:** Resemble disfigured humanoid figures coated in a corrosive black substance, seemingly exuding from their facial orifices. Each entity appears to wield a corroded shotgun-like weapon.\n**SCP-106-2:** Enormous moth-like creatures possessing human limbs and covered in a similar black corrosive substance, though the origin of their secretions remains undetermined. They demonstrate flight capabilities and exhibit remarkable agility and aggression.\n**SCP-106-3:** Bipedal canines with dual heads lacking visible ocular organs. Despite this, they display proficient tracking abilities and viciously maul their victims, tearing their bodies apart upon capture.\n**SCP-106-4:** Neutralized.\n**SCP-106-5:** Neutralized.\n\nEfforts to recontain these emergent instances have thus far proven ineffective. //~ Dr. Alexander Avenlee//\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nCLASSIFICATION\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nOBJECT CLASS\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[[SCP-3000]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nApollyon\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC; text-align:center\"]]\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\"]]\n\nIt has been observed that SCP-3000 has evaded radar detection, resulting in an ominous absence on all monitoring systems within the oceanic regions, with the entire ocean registering as a black expanse, presumably due to an overabundance of Y-909 secretion by SCP-3000.

Audible manifestations of intense emotional anguish, including loud sobbing and heightened vocalizations, were reported, escalating in intensity over time. Roughly thirty minutes subsequent to these initial signs, SCP-096 engaged in forceful impacts against the reinforced steel enclosure housing it. In response to the escalating situation, a Mobile Task Force, equipped with appropriate scramble gear, was swiftly dispatched to secure the anomaly and prevent a potential breach of containment. For a duration of approximately three hours, persistent and escalating vocalizations, along with forceful impacts, were documented emanating from SCP-096's containment area. \n\nThe situation abruptly ceased after the three-hour mark, prompting the dispatch of the Mobile Task Force to conduct an internal investigation. Within the containment area, SCP-096 was discovered deceased on the floor, exhibiting severe trauma. Its head was detached from its body, its ocular organs removed, and the skull of the severed head appeared to have sustained significant damage, likely due to repeated impact. No signs of vitality or movement were observed. Upon verification through comprehensive postmortem examinations, SCP-096 was officially deemed neutralized. //~ Dr. Alexander Avenlee//\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@ @@\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nCLASSIFICATION\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC\"]]\nOBJECT CLASS\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[[SCP-1974]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nSafe\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: #A0A0A0; color: #FCFCFC; text-align:center\"]]\nDESCRIPTION OF CHANGES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\"]]\nFor a span of seven days, both SCP-1974-1 and SCP-1974-2 failed to vocalize despite all of the conditions being met.
