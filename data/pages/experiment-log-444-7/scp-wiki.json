Dr ████, sociology expert.  ██████, military assessor.\n\n**Experimental Parameters:** It has been suggested that psychological deviations may occur as a result of long term infection with SCP-444, due to limitation of vocabulary.  50 Class D personnel with violent backgrounds were exposed to SCP-444 and placed in a sealed environment with limited but sufficient resources.  They were informed that they were not to be released at any point and their environment would not be interfered with by the Foundation.  A control group of 50 Class D personnel was also maintained.  Monthly terminations were suspended for both groups.\n\n**Date: ██-██-19██**\n\nControl group:  Group introduced to environment.  By the end of week 2, population stands at 42.\n\nTest group: Group introduced to environment.  By the end of week 2, population stands at 47.\n\n**Date: ██-██-19██**\n\nControl group:  Wide-scale violence and gang culture has developed.  By end of month 1, population stands at 26 with several subjects suffering from malnutrition.\n\nTest group: Group has entered stable group dynamic behind 4 dominant personalities.  By end of month 1, population stands at 42.\n\n**Date: ██-██-19██**\n\nControl group:  Violence escalated significantly.  By end of month 6, population stands at 7.  Group terminated as non-viable.\n\nTest group: Group authority has dissolved, organization is functioning as an ideal anarchic commune.  By end of month 6, population stands at 42 with several pregnancies.\n\n**Date: ██-██-19██**\n\nControl group:  Extinct.\n\nTest group: 1 year after experiment commenced population stands at 52.  1 additional, unexposed, category D personnel introduced.  Group rapidly accepts introduced personnel as leader, showing no resistance to subjugation.  Group terminated and youths placed in custody to establish development in infants.\n\n**Date:  ██-██-19██**\n\nInfant group: Progressive development confirmed, group terminated.\n\n**Notes:** Potential cure is still being examined.  Behaviour of SCP-444 infectees would be valuable in D-class personnel if its spread could be contained.  Value of SCP-444 as a potential invasion tool confirmed.\n\nReturn to [[[SCP-444]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
