He[[footnote]] **Emergency Correction:** {{ALL RIGHT LOOK I JUST STARTED CALLING UBU A \"HE\" AND IT STUCK AFTER A WHILE OKAY I AM AWARE HE'S GENDER NEUTRAL VIS A VIS BEING AN ANOMALOUS PILE OF MONSTER FLESH OR WHATEVER BUT FOR FUCK'S SAKE I'VE BEEN AT THIS HOW LONG NOW??? JUST LET ME HAVE THIS}} [[/footnote]] is an affront to every positive and loving concept in the human consciousness. Rather than our lives, he seeks to destroy our quality of life to sate his own sick desires.\n\nThink about it: The taste of ice cream. Playing with your dog. The way you felt after your first kiss.\n\n//That is UBU's sworn enemy.//\n\nNo fate is too cruel for him. No hatred is strong enough.\n\nWhen Project Beluga's charter was signed, 592 GOC officers and Foundation staff were present at the ceremony. Our troops numbered in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nI, Dr. Laurence Michaud, am the only surviving member - and always will be. What I lack in numbers is compensated thousandfold by my weapons, my mind, my replicated bodies, and aeons of experience.\n\nThe following record serves one purpose alone: that once justice has been brought to UBU, humans in the shining and golden UBU-free future will understand that one person can accomplish through the power of hard science and raw emotion entwined in a perfect and indestructible braid.\n\n+++ ...and while we're at it, you're very welcome.\n\n[[=]]\n//- Dr. Laurence Michaud//\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[=]]\n++ Abridged Record of SCP-001 Activations:\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Cycle 1: \"Initial\"\n\n**Description:** (See Previous Documentation)\n\n**Activation Point:** 2/14/3030 CE\n\n**Notes:** Initial discovery and usage of SCP-001.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Cycle 2: \"Cooperation\"\n\n**Description:** First year spent on perfecting the use of SCP-YEZ to achieve the spread-consciousness effect. The next 12,000 years focused on the expansion of the base Site-Beluga[[footnote]] Located within SCP-FNA, which itself is inside SCP-001. [[/footnote]], the creation of usable replicates for Dr. Michaud through the use of the onsite Hominid Replicators, clandestine collection of resources, and observation for any historical factors that would have led to the appearance of SCP-UBU. Remainder spent on securing Foundation resources & possible assistance.\n\n**Activation Point:** 4/14/1995 CE\n\n**Notes:** The SCP Foundation can no longer be trusted.

Civilian population forcibly evacuated. Century prior to UBU appearance spent in the construction of BELUGA-1 in the epicenter of UBU's appearance.\n\nBELUGA-1 consists of the following:\n\n* 100 high-yield nuclear weapons.\n* Heat-amplification runes copied from SCP-NSF.\n* A targeting beacon for SCP-DAG.\n* Five antimatter-gathering pods from SCP-HNM.\n\nBELUGA-1 detonated on schedule on 5/12/2588 at 0533 GMT.\n\n**Activation Point:** 9/1/2588 CE\n\n**Notes:** SCP-UBU unharmed. Rampages proceeded similarly to Cycle 1, save for the additional environmental threat posed by the slowly expanding lake of magma in Greenland.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Cycle 4: \"Competition\"\n\n**Description:** Greater scope of clandestine control gained over the Foundation & Global Occult Coalition via the use of replicates. 25 years prior to UBU's scheduled arrival, [[[SCP-2803]]]-A was consulted via email.\n\n> **SCP-2803-A:** Sosososoo GOOT to am beeng do amrucan BUSNUS witf MESTERIUS forain invoster such as youselfl, mr micho.

Some //Eastern// joker by the name of UBU wants to put a serious dent into consumer electronics in particular.

The resulting creature was 1.5 times SCP-169's size and had multiple heads.\n\nBillions died overnight from collateral damage. I tried to stick around and observe the inevitable fight with UBU for anything that could at least make the bastard flinch. The fight lasted centuries, but no damage whatsoever was done to anyone on either side. UBU finally made the killing slap when it stopped being fun.\n\n**Activation Point:** 1/4/2992 CE\n\n**Notes:** Moving forward, it would be best not to fight through a third party.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n++ [truncated for brevity]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f7ffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Cycle 273: \"Spirited Away\"\n\n**Description:** Increased the aperture from the BELUGA-94 project to teleport the entire continent of Greenland into another dimension after the UBU materialization event.\n\nUBU and Greenland successfully disappeared on 5/12/2588 at 0534 GMT.\n\nAt 0539 GMT, a //second// UBU materialization event occurred in the exact same place.

Construction of the BELUGA-X unit was completed over the course of 3,000 years at Site-ASSEMBLY.\n\nTo achieve this, the Church of the Broken God was infiltrated and forcibly repurposed into the False Pretense Labor Division of Project Beluga. Sarkic cult activity goes unchecked throughout much of Eastern Europe as a result. Damage deemed acceptable.\n\nBELUGA-X is a heavily armed construct based on the design of [[[SCP-2406]]].
