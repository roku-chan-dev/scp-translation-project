SCP-106.☦[[/size]]\n\nSomeplace, in a dirty, damp basement, there sat a figure in a rocking chair. \n\nA hanging lantern swung directly over the figure's bald head, dimly reflecting itself on his sweat. An unbuttoned leather vest revealed his gray, distended belly.\n\nHe rocked back and forth anxiously with a wide, toothy grin on his wrinkled face.\n\nHe reached for his liquor, then began singing softly to nobody in the empty basement.\n\n//Clumsy bear is roaming about the woods//\n\n//He picks up cones and sings his songs//\n\nHe could smell what he would not be able to describe as ozone. There was muffled screaming, and he could hear the latch to the basement being rustled. \n\nMore screaming now, but he wasn't sure what was producing the noise. The old man shook his head and closed his eyes.\n\n//A cone sprang back in his face//\n\n//And it hit him good//\n\nThe old man took to the fallout better than most of his friends did. He watched everyone die. He watched himself die. Such things happened. You couldn't dwell too long on them. \n\nA black puddle materialized on the ground in front of him.\n\n//This made the bear angry//\n\n//So he stomped his foot!//\n\nThe man sang with his smile intact, but there was confusion in his eyes. There was confusion enough to warrant another swig of the clear liquor. He saw the reflection of his face, smiling, rise up through the puddle of black.\n\n//The bear screamed, ow! ow!//\n\n//He stepped again on this acorn.//\n\n\"You don't want this,\" he said in his inquisitive drawl, turning his head slightly \"go fuck yourself.\"\n\nHis reflection smiled at him, seeing that it was himself. He sank back into the bubbling black circle and the old man continued to rock in his chair.\n\n------\n\nThe testing subject felt the tingle of his flesh being emancipated as he ran through the endless, acidic corridors of the pocket. He had an upset stomach, too.\n\n//Clumsy bear is roaming about the woods//\n\n//He picks up cones and sings his songs//\n\nWhere was that sound coming from? Finding it was the only thing to do here.\n\nHe turned a corner a bit too sharply and planted his hand on the dry frying pan walls. He took solace that the only limit to pain was greater pain, so he recovered and continued on toward a chained old wooden door in the distance. \n\nHis eyes began to burn to the nerve. This was difficult to ignore. He closed his eyes and charged into the door. Everything was rotten, so this wood would give.\n\nNo give.\n\n//A cone sprang back in his face//\n\n//And it hit him good//\n\nHe opened his eyes, and in the brief, white pain he could see that there was no old man lurking around the corners. \n\nBut his eyelids were beginning to burn off now, and his lack of skin meant covering them was going to cause more problems than it was worth.\n\n//This made the bear angry//\n\n//So he stomped his foot!//\n\nThe singing was just beyond that door, he could hear it so... no, he couldn't hear anything anymore. Something was wrong with his eardrums. \n\nThis whole situation was frying his brain.\n\n//The bear screamed, ow! ow!//\n\n-----\nHe dragged the man through the walls, through time, deep into the maze.\n\nHe was now gliding, exceptionally still, watching the man run through the halls of the labyrinth. He approached the human like he approached everything: at roughly 4 kilometers an hour.\n\nHe sunk into the wall, and glided, hidden, alongside the man in the corridor. Absorbing the burning flesh caused him a sort of gratification that he couldn't really place. He didn't care though, he couldn't care, he didn't really have what you would call higher brain function.\n\nHe just did this one thing, and...\n\n//This made the bear angry//\n\nHe didn't do anything else.\n\nHe poked his head up through the floor and looked stupidly at himself in the rocking chair.\n\n\"You don't want this,\" he said in his inquisitive drawl, turning his head slightly \"go fuck yourself.\"\n\nHe sank back in the floor.\n\n-----\n\nHe laughed quietly to himself.\n\nAnd he rocked in his chair in the isolated cell underneath a sprawling labyrinth of tight tunnels, underneath a large, decaying facility in a cold part of a dead world.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=faminepulse]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
