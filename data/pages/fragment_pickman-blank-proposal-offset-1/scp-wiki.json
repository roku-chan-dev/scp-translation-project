Research into sustaining, extending and strengthening its memetic properties is an Alpha-One priority at all times. Individuals found resistant to SCP-001 are to be amnesticized, detained, or terminated where appropriate and/or necessary. All SCP Foundation personnel rated above [/security-clearance-levels Class C] must undergo Antimeme-001 inoculation.\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Everest.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance.|\n    width=300px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is a memetic complex known internally as \"The Frontispiece\" residing in the human collective consciousness. It exerts an anomalous force upon all initialisms[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Abbreviations consisting of initials which are read and spoken individually.[[/span]] containing the Latin letter sequence S-C-P: without Antimeme-001 inoculation, considerable memetic conditioning or thaumaturgic/ontokinetic capabilities, no human being encountering such initialisms is capable of mentally connecting them, or whatever objects, personages or organizations they are applied to, with the SCP Foundation. The Frontispiece therefore allows the Foundation to operate public-facing front organizations which are simultaneously identifiable at a glance to agents in the field, and veiled from hostile operatives or the general populace. For example: all \"Snooze 'n' Cruise Palace\"[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A chain of novelty retro-style hotels and restaurants with over two hundred locations, primarily in the South-Western United States.[[/span]] franchise locations also operate as Foundation safehouses, while \"Sawyer's Cheesy Pretzels\" eateries[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A chain known for specializing in soft pretzels seasoned with a variety of high-quality cheeses, operating locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Japan.[[/span]] act as intelligence-gathering hubs and launching points for Mobile Task Force operations.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=1\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Website.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-001 instance.\n]]\n\nSCP-001-1 is \"The Sigil,\" a non-linguistic visual trigger mimicking the SCP-001 effect. (See Addendum 001-3.)\n\nAntimeme-001 is a thaumaturgically-produced inoculant for SCP-001, supplied to all Foundation personnel on a regular schedule.\n\nThe Frontispiece possesses a singular fault which to date remains unexplained by anomalous science. There is a non-zero chance that it will entirely fail to operate on individuals who frequently encounter anomalous phenomena, or who were exposed to it during their youth. Such individuals inevitably come to recognize the connection between Foundation front organizations and, eventually, the Foundation itself. This most commonly occurs with agents belonging to Groups of Interest, hostile or not. It has been hypothesized that exposure to a presently-unquantified element common to all anomalous phenomena carries an inoculant effect similar to that of Antimeme-001.\n\nSCP-001 was intentionally created and implemented by the Foundation in 1969, at the height of the Panopticon Crisis.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 001-1, Panopticon Crisis Overview:** In the 1960s the SCP Foundation drew the ire of multiple national governments when it was discovered that Overwatch Command was simultaneously aiding and hindering all major players in the Cold War.\n\nCanada was among the first to withdraw support, in 1964, after the actions of [[[span class=\"normal\"]][http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-good-work DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]] resulted in the violent death of Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Raynard Watts, chair of the Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce. Israel and Lebanon mutually agreed to cut ties with the Foundation following the disastrous outcome of 1965's Operation EIGHTH TRUMPET.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]While successful in halting an XK-Class Scenario, the damage to Tel Megiddo resulted in the loss of an unknown quantity of artifacts relevant to all Abrahamic faiths.[[/span]] In 1967, Egypt and several other North African states withdrew support after it was discovered that the stranding of the so-called 'Yellow Fleet' in the Suez Canal was caused in part by the Foundation, due to an anomaly in transport aboard the SCPS //Conrad//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Publicly known as the Swedish ship //MS Nippon//.[[/span]] breaching containment.\n\nThe most devastating withdrawals came from the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. While providing materiel and personnel to the U.S. government during the Vietnam War, the Foundation was simultaneously working with communist regimes to secure both funding and a sustainable D-Class personnel population. When President Lyndon B. Johnson was informed of Overwatch's involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]During which prototype teleportation technology was provided to the Cuban government for the purpose of transporting radioactive material, in exchange for access to samples of Fidel Castro's hair and blood for use in a thaumic contingency.[[/span]] in 1964, he terminated all financial, tactical, and personnel arrangements, only allowing the Foundation to continue operations on U.S. soil after a United Nations resolution backed by the Global Occult Coalition.\n\nThe USSR was alerted to Foundation involvement in the development of the Enigmagraph[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Developed under Project Paperclip, the Enigmagraph is an anomalous derivative of the Nazi Enigma Machine; unlike the cipher-based encoding of an Enigma Machine, the Enigmagraph creates messages that are only decipherable by the intended recipients. It was later a key element in PROJECT:ROSETTA, resulting in the creation of 8-Ball.aic by the [/aiad-homescreen AIAD].[[/span]] and its extensive use in western espionage operations. The Foundation was ousted from many Soviet territories, only maintaining scattered Sites outside Western Germany.\n\nThis left the Foundation's sole strongholds in Japan, South America, Latin America, and the Bahamas; even then, the relationship with Cuba had to be bolstered with donations of early-stage cloning technology, to assist with Fidel Castro's failing health and need for organ donations.\n\nEach of the incidents described above was exacerbated by the intervention of a hostile agent identified as PoI-001.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFE9D9; padding: 6px; width: 700px\"]]\n**Profile: PoI-001**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px;\"]]\n**Name:** Unknown\n**Occupation:** Operative (various)\n**Primary Alias:** Elizabeth Crocker\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\n\n\"Elizabeth Crocker\" joined the United States Central Intelligence Agency in 1959, brought on as part of MKISOLDA[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A CIA research project focusing on the creation and weaponization of an anomalous religion dedicated to the worship of the United States of America.[[/span]] and rising through the ranks until becoming personal assistant to Director John Alexander McCone. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Crocker.jpg|\n    caption=PoI-001|\n     width=191px |\n    align=left\n]]\n\nShortly after joining the CIA, Crocker developed a romantic relationship with Dr. Alexandre 'Hill' Hilbert, a CIA researcher responsible for the development of the 'Quantum Brace', an experimental //eigenweapon// capable of altering probability. Hilbert was killed in 1964 during a test of the Quantum Brace, shortly after the Foundation attempted to recruit him; Crocker incorrectly believed the test was sabotaged by the Foundation following Hilbert's refusal of said offer, and subsequently leaked Overwatch's involvement in the Cuban Missile Crisis to President Johnson.\n\nCrocker is a Class-3 (\"Magus\") Thaumaturge with training in cryptomancy, a branch of thaumaturgy dealing with anomalous symbology, language, and codes. Her training predates her recruitment into the CIA, though her exact date of birth, and therefore the timeline of her training, is unknown.\n\nOn 10/19/1967, Crocker disguised herself as O5-7's personal driver and proceeded to shoot her over one dozen times before leaving her body in front of a Foundation safehouse in San Francisco. A note was attached to the corpse.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDo you know the secret to democracy? Here's the most common wrong answer: \"One man can make a difference.\" That's not democracy at all, of course, it's autarchy. One man making all the difference is no different from, say, thirteen men doing it. \n\nOh, the violence that misconception lets people like you perpetrate! It conditions us to tyranny in the name of the greater good, as defined by the lesser evil of tyrants. You want us all marching to your master plan, and you don't care who has to get tread under foot on the way.\n\nNo, the real secret to democracy is that no two people want to make the same difference, and when they see how different their friends and neighbours and colleagues already are, it makes them so goddamn hopping mad. Nobody likes to confront the fact of someone else's reality, nobody wants to toil toward someone else's utopia, and everybody, __everybody__, loves to play the blame game. \n\nThey've got a lot of grievances to lay blame for, right now. And as luck would have it, they've also got a ready-made scapegoat sitting right under their noses.\n\nIt's high time somebody broke up your tidy little racket. No, more than one somebody. \n\nEverybody.\n\n__We're__ going to contain __you__, and you're going to suffocate.\n[[/div]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nThe assassination of O5-7 created a vacancy in the O5 Council that could not easily be filled, more often than not leaving Overwatch deadlocked on major decisions. This marked the beginning of what Archives and Revision personnel have subsequently termed the \"Panopticon Crisis,\" due to the constant scrutiny from world governments precipitated by PoI-001. With the Foundation haemorrhaging resources and the increasing difficulty of operating in a clandestine manner, it was feared that an LV-1 \"Burning Veil\" Scenario would ensue, culminating in an LV-0 \"Broken Masquerade\" Scenario.\n\nOn 11/23/1967, Overwatch Command issued a radio transmission to all surviving Foundation Sites ordering their personnel to attempt amelioration of this situation by any means at their disposal. Site-01 subsequently enacted complete radio silence, as Agent Crocker and a team of anomalocryptographers were then finalizing the process of deciphering the Foundation's most secure communications ciphers. The following transcript is taken from a brainstorming meeting between several members of Foundation personnel trapped in Havana, Cuba in January of 1968.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-1\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-1\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Personnel in Attendance:** Dr. Amity Noble, Proxy for O5-10; Dr. Vivian Lesley Scout, Director, Site-43; Dr. Arik Euler, Thaumatologist[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Period term; the present-day terminology is 'Thaumaturge'.[[/span]];  Agent Charles Correia, Mobile Task Force Oliver-19 (\"Contingency's Contingency\"); Kady O'Donnell, Department of Accounting; Dr. Vladimir Dyer, former USGOV Liaison. \n \n**Dr. Scout:** Let's get it over with.

Department of Defence forces attempted to enter the Site, without effect; on 01/07/1968, therefore, two OSAT teams were dispatched.\n\nTeams MACDONALD and STEELE entered Ipperwash Provincial Park without incident, but expected heavy resistance when attempting to enter the camp itself; similar attempts on previous occasions had been thwarted by mythological figures belonging to the nearby Indian reserves, which typically ignore the soldiers stationed at Ipperwash. This experience was not repeated, however; though a number of supernatural beings residing in the woods, and beneath Lake Huron, observed the advancing teams, they made no effort to interfere.\n\nTeam STEELE's Grade-1 clairvoyant was able to 'read' the Foundation operatives within the structure housing the Site's sole service elevator. Taking advantage of a shift change, Team MACDONALD successfully entered and disabled the guards within. Under interrogation, these guards revealed the construction of a subterranean rail network reaching to Grand Bend, Ontario, as well as rumours of tunnels beneath the bedrock; Team STEELE is presently engaged in sounding Ipperwash Park to determine the precise location of either feature. The elevator has so far resisted attempts to summon it or to breach its shaft, but with the camp under OSAT control, it is only a matter of time before the Foundation is forced to face their eviction.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- Sergeant Gordon Shine, Chief Superintendent, OSAT//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWithout elevator or subway access, Site-43's topside operations were restricted to only those assets already located beyond the interdiction zone and capable of radio communication.

Dr. Falkirk was not cleared for the full extent of this information. The present-day iteration of PoI-382's profile is appended below.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFE9D9; padding: 6px; width: 700px\"]]\n**Profile: PoI-382**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px;\"]]\n**Name:** Thilo Zwist\n**Occupation:** Memeticist-at-large\n**Known Aliases:** Ira Braun, Dr. Bromide, Tolliver Brumley, Will Deaver, Mr. Gloss, Joseph Heino, Dr. Jim, Angela Mercy, Reiki Rick, Alexander Scoffield, Uncle Teddy, Hammond Washburn, etc.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\n\nThilo Zwist was apprenticed into a now-extinct ancient society of highly advanced cryptomancers known as the //schriftsteller// (the Writers), a society of which he is now the only known surviving member.

In his youth he altered the Germanic language family to incorporate a deadly disease trigger -- accidentally -- and a decade after the Panopticon Crisis ended he insinuated a nonexistent political personage into the historical record. The latter act was at the behest of the SCP Foundation, with whom he is nominally aligned; Site-43 Director Dr. V.L. Scout spent many decades ostensibly pursuing Zwist, but the two were in fact engaged in a covert collaboration to advance the aims of societal survival and stability (though they would never meet in person). The primary reason for this collaboration was the resurgence of GoI-5054, the //giftschreiber// (the Poison-Writers), first in the form of a right-wing Canadian think-tank called the Righting History Institute.\n\nFor unclear reasons, the //giftschreiber// have engaged in periodic attacks on societal stability worldwide. Their anarchic activities are primarily attested in the western world, but Archives and Revision research has uncovered //giftschreiber// activity in over one hundred and forty nations worldwide. Their attacks are invariably memetic in nature, though the form varies; many //giftschreiber// utilize the written word, while some use images, and others employ audio.\n\nZwist himself has proven capable of using all aforementioned media, though his primary area of expertise is written memetics. His command of this skill is such that he is essentially impossible to detain, and he has gone unmolested by the Foundation since the early 1980s.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nArmed with the 1968 equivalent of this information, Chief Strauss advanced a theory: via a Foundation thaumatologist in Cuba,  Dr. Scout had planted a reference to the //giftschreiber// in Dr. Okorie's mind to suggest that PoI-382 be contacted about crafting a cryptomantic solution to the Panopticon Crisis. (This would later be proven correct; the thaumatologist in question had been Dr. Euler.) As Dr. Falkirk was not cleared for this information, Chief Strauss and Dr. Okorie planned their response in private. Two of Site-43's Mobile Task Forces regularly attempted pursuit of Zwist -- for training purposes only -- and a raid on his last known place of business had in fact been in the late stages of planning when the DND and OSAT occupation made egress impossible. Without MTF support, Dr. Okorie would attempt to make contact with the cryptomancer on 03/12/1968.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-3\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-3\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Dr. Okorie approaches a row of abandoned businesses in the Harbourfront district of Toronto.

Have you seen mine?\n\n//Zwist chuckles.//\n\n**Zwist:** Not that I'd have let you remember.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** I'm not here to capture you, doctor.\n\n**Zwist:** I'm not a doctor, but you look like you might be. I've been expecting a visit.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You have?\n\n**Zwist:** There's a lot of uninvited visitors nosing about your camp, lately. Thought the local wildlife would've prevented that.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** We've been giving the Nexus reserves fresh water for twenty years now, but we had to shut that down when OSAT closed in. I think the myth monsters are cross with us.\n\n**Zwist:** As well they should be. One shouldn't abandon one's responsibilities just because the going gets tough.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** We've been under rather a lot of pressure, if you hadn't noticed.\n\n**Zwist:** And it'll only get worse, if I know Elizabeth Crocker.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** //Do// you know Elizabeth Crocker?\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Zwist:** Are you here to ask for my help, or did I let you find me for no good reason?\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** I assume this place has some significance to you?\n\n**Zwist:** Oh, quite. It's an object lesson. This bakery used to be just one link in a world-wide chain. The very first one was built in my little village of Amstetten, and I painted them a very special sign as one of many tests in my long, long apprenticeship.\n\n//Zwist sighs.//\n\n**Zwist:** It was a remarkable piece of craftsmanship. I prepared it with great care.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You're talking about cryptomancy.\n\n**Zwist:** Crypwhat? I'm talking about //writing,// though not writing the way you'd understand it. I was a promising young writer, and my efforts paid dividends for the client. I painted more and more signs for them, pouring everything I knew into them, and within a month there wasn't another baker in Amstetten. Within a year, they were breadmaker to kings and czars. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Making bread, huh.\n\n**Zwist:** Yes.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Dough.\n\n**Zwist:** Yes, thank you, the metaphor has been tired for nearly a century, you're not adding anything to it now.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Sorry. You were about to get to the instructive part about how mismanagement ruined the effect?\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** We get a lot of monologuers in my business. You learn to recognize patterns.\n\n**Zwist:** Good, pattern recognition will be important later. I'll make my point: some man who knew more about accounting than art began to wonder why every new franchise location required the services of some strange old painter from some obscure Austrian workshop. They stopped calling me, and started knocking off copies of my sign with their own inferior materials. Even without the inaugural magic I painted into the bricks of each bakery, the thing had a power all its own... but it was not strong enough to withstand long decades of progressive meddling in the name of 'improvement'. The work was diffused, abstracted, abstrused, and in the end, disabled entirely. By the time they had a worldwide empire, they also had a dead duck product. Without my work to advertise their dubious virtues, they were nothing.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Zwist:** It was never very good bread.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Solid ending.\n\n**Zwist:** I hear a few of the older bakeries stayed in business. Something of my Writing lingers in the brickwork, and they still draw in the tourists. So I hear.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** When did all this happen? You made signs in Austria, but also in Canada? Did you emigrate after the war, or...?\n\n**Zwist:** Yes, the Thirty Years' War. I made the first sign in 1637, when I was fifteen.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Back up. That would make you... three hundred and forty-six years old.\n\n**Zwist:** Three hundred forty-five. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Why are half the people I work with immortal?\n\n**Zwist:** Pardon?\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Nothing. It's just... nothing.\n\n**Zwist:** We all have our burdens to bear.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** In any case, you're saying that you can use writing and thaumatology in order to... \n\n**Zwist:** Create words of power. Or words of poison. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** And you can use that to... help the Foundation?\n\n**Zwist:** I can craft you a phrase like the one I made for the bakers, something to... distract the world at large, make them not see you for who you are, so long as you show the sign. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You can just... write the words? And people will ignore us?\n\n**Zwist:** Essentially. At the very least, you will be able to move about unharrassed. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You'll forgive me if I'm skeptical.\n\n**Zwist:** I would never forgive you if you weren't. But if it's proof you want, read this.\n\n//Sound of paper unfurling.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** ...what is...?\n\n**Zwist:** Try moving your apple arm.\n\n//Silence on recording, followed by a startled yelp from Dr. Okorie.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** The hell did you do to me?!\n\n**Zwist:** I conflated the concepts of 'apple' and 'right'. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Well, un-conflate them!\n\n//Sound of paper being handled.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Okay, so it works. But //how// does it work? You're using the same words the rest of us use, and you're doing something different with them.\n\n**Zwist:** Yes, that's called 'writing'.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:**  Don't be coy! Your writing is very obviously different.\n\n**Zwist:** Writing is writing. Smuggling concepts out of your head and into someone else's through the medium of words. A good writer can make the reader see, feel, even believe anything.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:**  That's lovely, but most writers aren't magicians. Even the really good ones are working within established parameters.\n\n**Zwist:** No, they aren't. The really good ones use those parameters as a dartboard. There are underlying grammars defining the relationship of every word in every language, and when you master them, you can make them behave very strangely indeed, and to terrific effect. In the hands of a master, grammar can work even better when it's broken! I'm merely aware of a deeper layer, an under-underlying grammar, and applying the same principles to it.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You've lost me again.\n\n**Zwist:** We're both overcomplicating things, so I'll put it this way instead: whether you're a writer or a Writer, the progression is identical. You learn the system, know it inside and out, and then you subvert it. You learn the rules, then learn how to break them. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:**  Can you explain the rules which... prevent normal writing from becoming anomalous? And how to break those rules?\n\n**Zwist:** Yes!\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** When do we start?\n\n**Zwist:** We don't. I said I //can.// Under no circumstances will I do it. I have trained apprentices before, a mere handful, and it hasn't always worked out the way I'd like. I know too much about your Foundation to want to hand you the keys to this particular thought-vehicle, particularly if you've been such poor neighbours that the locals no longer vouch for you. I know what your enemies say you are, and in many ways they aren't far wrong... I've escaped enough jackbooted stormtroopers to say that with confidence. I //am// going to help you with this, nevertheless. You deserve the chance to improve your moral backbone, and Crocker is certainly more demagogue than democrat. I will not enable you to replicate the effects afterward, however. A line must be drawn.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** What precisely will your help entail, then?\n\n**Zwist:** I married the concept of 'quality' to the concept of this bakery. I will divorce the concept of 'the Foundation' from... well, from whatever is chosen.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Would an initialism work?\n\n**Zwist:** More adaptable than an acronym, certainly. What do you have in mind?\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Well, as you might be aware, we call ourselves the SCP Found--\n\n//Zwist laughs.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** What?\n\n**Zwist:** Nothing, nothing. Yes, I have heard that. This is going to work out splendidly.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nOne week after this meeting, Zwist presented Dr. Okorie with an anomalous logo design for the nonexistent \"Scout's Cargo Packing,\" and the chemical formula for an inoculant (later developed into Antimeme-001). As Zwist's dealings with Dr. Scout were at this time unknown to the Foundation at large, Dr. Okorie claimed to have captured these items during his supposed raid. A quorum of the Site Directors' Executive Committee of the Whole rejected the use of this untested thaumaturgy, but in light of the Foundation's vastly reduced budget and the absence of safer solutions, they were overruled by the O5 Council. The logo was printed on moving vans under Zwist's covert direction, and the Foundation's first Panopticon Crisis-era front company was commissioned. Its cover as a courier service allowed for the transport of personnel and materials across North America without interference from various world governments, allowing for the limited re-establishment of supply lines between various Sites across the Continental United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. OSAT was ejected from Camp Ipperwash, and Dr. Scout was able to return to Site-43; Dr. Euler became a consultant for Scout's Cargo Packing, as he was very eager to examine Zwist's work and attempt to decipher it. With the Crisis by no means over, extending this cryptomantic umbrella over the entirety of the Foundation was designated an Alpha-One priority. That project therefore became, by default, SCP-001.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Packing.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001, first iteration (civilian period photograph).|\n    align=center|    \n    width=600px|\n]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 001-2, Creation of the Frontispiece:** In May of 1968, a collision along Route 66 in the central United States rendered an instance of Zwist's work unusable. He had stressed to Dr. Okorie that the products of his Writing were dangerous if damaged, and Dr. Okorie therefore personally supervised the acroamatic abatement of such instances whenever accidents occurred.\n\nThis particular instance and its handlers -- Dr. Euler among them -- were stopped at the Canadian border by enemy agents. The ensuing incident is recounted by Dr. Euler in his testimony excerpted below.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-4\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-4\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Beginning recording. Agent Louis Kirkhope acting as interrogator in the matter of a skirmish at the Canadian border between the Foundation and an... unknown faction.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** They're CIA, I'm telling you.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** State your name, occupation, and security clearance for the record, please.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** For the love of-- Arik Euler, approved thaumatologist, 001/4.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** You may begin your testimony at any time, Doctor. \n\n**Dr. Euler:** It was about noon when we were going to cross over into Canada. We were told that our transport was going to get extra screening, just to make sure we weren't taking contraband into the country. It's a hazard we knew we were going to run into with the courier cover. But on the other side, we found... well, I'm just going to say it again, they were fucking CIA Agents.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** How could you tell? \n\n**Dr. Euler:** There was a woman leading them, with a very distinctive haircut. Cropped very short, sort of a pompadour, almost? I thought she was a man at first, but then she spoke. Brown hair, about five-foot-two, brown eyes--\n\n**Dr. Noble:** Scar on her upper lip? Insisted on being addressed as \"Doctor\" as opposed to \"Agent\"?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Yes. Her lip looked like it had been bitten by something. I'd recognized her from the files we were given. It was--\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Elizabeth Crocker. If she has a doctorate, we've not located it.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** After the bags were put over our heads, we were driven somewhere remote -- still over the border, I knew that much. Didn't go back over the bridge. When the bags came off, it was night, and they were... preparing something. They had gotten a van that looked like ours and had rammed it into a tree, getting ready to set it on fire. They were already loading men into it to make it look like we had died in a crash.\n\n...I panicked. I don't know if it was the bags, or the fire, or the way those agents marched, but it was... too much for me.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** It's lucky American anti-thaumic measures are decades behind, or else I may not have gotten out.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** What did you do, exactly?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I was handcuffed. My thaumatology is a sort of... I don't want to call it alchemy, but it's essentially magical chemistry. I can take things, solid things, and reduce them to their base components. I can also... repurpose them. The handcuffs I was wearing, for instance. Steel. Easy to take the iron out and leave highly brittle carbon in its place, while infusing my bones with the metal for a bit of reinforcement. So, that's what I did. And then I just... tried to do the same thing, to everything around me.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** To what effect?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I knew Crocker herself was a mage, but... she was stronger than I thought. She managed to confound my rites, somewhat. Instead of splitting molecules, they were reformed into something new. She made it //rain// using magic that's supposed to make it easier to start //fires//.\n\nI... I thought I was going to die. That we were all going to die. But one of my rites went... wild, in a way. Hit the Frontispiece, on the side of the van, and reduced it.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** I beg your pardon?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** That's what I've been calling the... thing, hidden in our acronym. The Frontispiece. The first thing anyone sees of us, and hopefully the last thing they think of when it comes to us. I hit the Frontispiece -- the SCP initialism -- and reduced it. In that reduction, I saw... well it might be better if I just showed you. Can I borrow a pen?\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** One moment.\n\n//Sound of scratching as Dr. Euler draws an unusual pattern on a piece of paper.//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Retroactively identified as a fractal, after Benoit Mandelbrot concretized the terminology in 1975.[[/span]]\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Taht si tahw? Tahw, tiaw? Gnineppah s'tahw?! Kcuf eht tahw?!\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Don't be alarmed, you're just speaking backwards. Let me just...\n\n//Further scribbling sounds.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** And look at that.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** What the //fuck// was that?! It... it felt like it was //inside my head!//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** It was. Zwist lied -- there aren't any secret grammars to his writing. There are //patterns//. Patterns arcane and anomalous, while simultaneously completely natural. \n\n//Dr. Euler taps the paper.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** This was embedded in the 'r' in the word 'Cargo'. I believe its original intent was... to reverse attention. But I've adapted it to reverse //speech//.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** That explains how Crocker saw through it. She's a cryptomancer -- her thaumatology deals in codes and hidden patterns. She's probably at least partially immune to Zwist's work. But... how did you escape?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** In the \"S\" in \"Scout's\", there was a pattern -- I won't draw it here, don't worry -- that aided in miscommunication. I isolated it, and imposed that pattern on the eyes of every CIA agent who was there.\n\nIn a way, I imitated //Migdal Bavel//.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** I... don't follow.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Let me put it a bit more plainly, then. Where do we get the word 'babble' from?\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Dear god.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** We got in their car and drove back here, to 43.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Matches up with the testimony from the others. This... reduction process you use. How much knowledge do you retain from it, when you use it on pen and paper?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** They did... experiments on me, when I was inducted into the Foundation. Maybe three pages of material, double-spaced. But it fades -- that pattern I drew, and the counteragent, is the last of it.\n\n**Agent Kirkhope:** Could you do it again? Write it down as it comes to you?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** ...don't tell me you mean to replicate the work. What Zwist does is... //impossibly// complex. I get a migraine just thinking about it.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** But tell me... how does acroamatic abatement process textual anomalies?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nThe destruction of all non-functioning instances was halted in order to subject them to more rigorous investigation. Dr. Euler formed the Mimesis and Cryptomancy Research Group with acroamatic abatement specialists Dr. Okorie and Dr. Ilse Reynders. As the latter suffered from a [/scp-5616 condition] which did not permit her to leave a sealed chamber at Site-43, communicating only through its single window, O5 Command re-assigned Dr. Euler to that facility.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Damage.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance, damaged.|\n     width=300px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\nIt was quickly determined that, contrary to Zwist's warnings, examples of his Writing did not become universally fatal when damaged; their cognitocatalytic qualities instead took on new, though admittedly mostly undesirable, attributes. Dr. Euler began breaking down each damaged instance via thaumaturgy, with the ultimate aim of producing further examples for more varied purposes. Dr. Reynders designed microscopy equipment capable of examining the decomposed cryptomancy at the atomic level, while Dr. Okorie researched remote reading and the collective unconscious in order to better understand how Zwist's powers acted so effectively on human communication.\n\nMeanwhile, what remained of the Foundation's facilities in the Soviet Union was slowly being destroyed. The GRU Psychotronics division's inexperience with, or outright apathy toward Foundation containment methods resulted in over seventy anomalies breaching within Soviet territories during the 1960s. This culminated in June of 1968 with the Soviets raiding an isolated, abandoned Biological Containment Site near Lake Baikal, unleashing an anomalous mutagenic virus resulting in [[[span class=\"normal\"]][http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-610 DATA EXPUNGED][[/span]]]. This is widely considered one of the most disastrous events of the Panopticon Crisis, and it resulted in Leonid Brezhnev issuing the order to surrender all remaining Foundation facilities. Threatened with overwhelming force, Overwatch reluctantly agreed; a hurried evacuation commenced.\n\nA shipping container labelled with the insignia of a former Foundation front company was discovered by operatives embedded in the Port of Los Angeles on July 2, 1968, containing a badly-beaten but still alive Site-03 Director Abrasha Sokolsky. The following note was pinned to his necktie:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nCan you feel the noose yet?\n[[/div]]\n\nUnbeknownst to the Soviets, [/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120] in Częstochowa, Poland remained operational. Personnel had evacuated into the extradimensional Free Port of [/scp-5373 Esterberg], accessible via a Way[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A thaumaturgical gate.[[/span]] within Site-120 ten days prior to Soviet occupation. In the process, they removed all documentation and took with them whatever anomalies were feasible to contain within a pocket dimension. \n\nBrezhnev's orders would have resulted in the deaths of dozens of biological and/or sapient anomalies if not for the actions of Anna Wójcik, a Site-120 thaumaturge. Wójcik was able to curry favour with the //Kapuza Bazyliszka//, a Polish sect of the Serpent's Hand whose views ran counter to Soviet interests. The //Kapuza// mobilized allied cells across the USSR to care for the isolated anomalies and maintain containment where necessary. While inevitably many items were still lost, Europe and Asia were spared an undoubtedly cataclysmic mass containment failure due to the efforts of the //Kapuza Bazyliszka// and Wójcik. This uncharacteristic cooperation is credited as a major reason for the warmer relations between the Foundation and the anomalous community in Eastern Europe today as compared with the rest of the world.\n\nIt was a scientific breakthrough in late July of 1968, however, which was to permanently alter the course of the Panopticon Crisis.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-5\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-5\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Where are we at with the thaumatology, Erik?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I think... I //think// I've just about worked it out. I've never tried disintegrating something in such a targeted manner, you understand; it's normally enough just to destroy a thing. Destroying it in such a way that you can still see how it was originally put together, well, that's tricky.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** The monitoring equipment is built, though it isn't quite what we'd hoped for. The whole supply chain is in ruins, and Ilse's specifications were exacting... but. We've done the research, and I think I know what to look for. It's going to be delicate at first, but we can make it work.\n\n//Dr. Okorie sighs.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Because we have no choice.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You've been awfully quiet, Ilse.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** I don't talk when I don't have anything to say.

Why did he call it that? Why was //that// the sign he chose to work with?\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Scout's his nemesis, they've been playing cat and mouse for decades. It's a joke at the Director's expense.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Is it? Did he need to use the SCP acronym to make that joke? \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** I've always thought the acronym was already a joke. It can't really stand for \"Secure, Contain, Protect,\" that's gibberish as a name. It doesn't stand for anything, just like \"Scout's Cargo Packing\" doesn't mean anything. Perfect fit.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** But is that the simplest possible explanation?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** What could be simpler?\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Something in the words themselves made that specific string of characters work better for his purposes. The joke was just a blind, to make it seem like there was no deeper reasoning.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Zwist is older than Canada, Ilse. His mind is a labyrinth, you're not gonna get far trying to parse his... underlying mental grammar.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Grammar. It's all about grammar, isn't it? This is a man who can infect grammar with diseases. There's obviously a scientific, or thaumatological, basis for all that, but... what if there's also a grammatical one?\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Go on.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** What if he's not just exploiting unnatural... no. What if he's not just employing //supernatural// mechanisms, but also linguistic mechanisms? What if his cryptomancy works because it's magic //and// because it exploits the rules of language?\n\n//Dr. Reynders gasps. She pounds her forehead with the palm of one hand.//\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Ohhh, //potverdorie.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Pot what?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** She's cursing. Mildly.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** I'm right, I'm right, of //course// I'm right. It's so obvious.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Make it obvious for us, too?\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** The string of characters might be important, but it's the acronym he's exploiting. And oh, good lord, we can exploit it too. We're going to do incredible things, gentlemen.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Ils--\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** SCP. For //decades// we've already been... how did we get that lucky? And how did I miss it?! I have a degree in literary studies, I should have seen this right away. SCP!\n\n//Dr. Reynders laughs.//\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** More words in English start with those three letters than with any others! \n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nDr. Reynders theorized that this apparent accident of grammar had aided the construction of Zwist's cryptomancy, and might allow for far more comprehensive applications once the field of study was better understood. If the Scout's Cargo Packing emblem did in fact rely on the SCP acronym, then the Foundation would not necessarily need to create many new fronts to alleviate its international pressure -- the thaumaturgic processes functioning within the existing sign could, in theory, be transferred to another without completely understanding the means by which Zwist had set them in motion. The Site Directors' Executive Committee of the Whole recommended that work on this stop-gap measure be matched with a parallel program of research into the actual origins of Zwist's cryptomancy. The following day, after a mass containment breach occurred at Area-97 due to poorly-maintained facilities, the O5 Council again overrode their concerns.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Simpson2.jpg|\n    caption=Simpson Centre for Policy signage.|\n     width=200px |\n    align=left\n]]\n\nThough the practice had fallen out of favour in the post-war period, many early front organizations had already employed the SCP acronym in their titles for purposes of deniability. Site-43 itself had immediate access to two of these: Lake Huron Supply, Control and Purification[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The surface front for Site-43's acroamatic abatement network.[[/span]] and the Simpson Centre for Policy.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A deprecated think-tank in Toronto which served as the original front for what became Site-43's Archives and Revision Section.[[/span]] As these fronts still had public-facing functions, however, Dr. Scout would not release them for thamaturgic experimentation until the working theory was proven correct. \n\nIn August, the Foundation lost contact with Regional Command in South Africa. Agent Crocker had infiltrated Site-52 in Johannesburg some years prior under the alias \"Dr. Gabrielle Fish,\" and in that time had been inciting distrust between white and black personnel throughout the region. This culminated in Regional Director Rupert Jansen issuing an ultimatum on 16 August 1968 that all non-white Foundation personnel be removed from the country immediately, or else face execution.  This was only possible due to the fact that Dr. Anje Verhoten, the previous Regional Commander, had been //de facto// removed from her position by way of being stranded with her family in the central United States by the 1967 radio silence order.\n\nCrocker's manipulations led to the loss of over two hundred members Foundation personnel, along with the last Site south of the Congo. The only active facility in Africa until the end of the Panopticon Crisis would be Site-27 in Tanzania, presumably overlooked due to its isolated location and the low-risk anomalies contained within. Crocker executed Jansen, then proceeded to give the Fouché administration access to anomalies they would use to attempt to silence the anti-Apartheid movement gaining traction throughout the nation. Jansen's freeze-dried but thawing corpse was discovered by a routine patrol of the Site-19 interdiction zone following these developments, a note in his jacket pocket:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou're running out of continents.\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 09/03/1968 Drs.

Class D personnel exposed to the new instance experienced disorientation and a lack of recognition of their surroundings; while the effect was nowhere near as strong as with the Scout's Cargo Packing emblem, the results were nevertheless extremely promising. (It was assumed, as would later be proven correct, that Zwist performed additional thaumaturgy during the application of his art which could not be replicated without his aid.) The company was put into full operation, and began managing the legal and materiel processes for the creation of new fronts utilizing the SCP initialism.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Shell.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance.|\n     width=250px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\nAfter acquiring numerous subcontractors and setting up separate offices in five major North American cities, the Shell Construction Partnership came under legal threat by the Royal Dutch Shell petroleum conglomerate. It is believed that Agent Crocker was responsible for alerting them to the front's existence. Shell asserted that the new company was guilty of serious copyright infringement. However, they proved unable to successfully execute their lawsuit due to persistent confusion, demotivation and even amnesia on the part of their legal counsel -- particularly in preliminary hearings with the Partnership's own counsel, the hastily-empowered fictional law firm of Sloane, Corbin and Paiva -- providing the ultimate proof that the research group's program of study was a promising one. Dr. Euler began studying the composition and behaviour of the anomalous particles in earnest, while Dr. Reynders conducted research into linguistic and paralinguistic theory. Dr. Okorie was further able to occlude the activities of the Simpson Centre for Policy and Lake Huron Supply, Control and Purification, but no further progress on this front was made in 1968. Zwist had determined that enemy action could not possibly be responsible for damaging the quantity of his Writing Dr. Okorie had asked him to replace, surmising that the Foundation was now attempting to reverse-engineer his work; he therefore cut off all contact.\n\nMonths of intensive study followed, and on 02/17/1969, the research group submitted the following to the O5 Council.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-7\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-7\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-top: 12px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **RESEARCH FIELD PROPOSAL**\n**\"Quantum Linguaphysics\"**\n\nDr. Arik Euler\nDr. Izaak Okorie\nDr. Ilse Reynders\n[[/=]]\n\n**Summary:** Thousands of discrete acroamatic abatement processes carried out upon instances of a complex piece of cryptomancy confiscated from PoI-382, unaligned thaumatologist Thilo Zwist, have revealed an entire new field of scientific study. By thaumatologically breaking these instances down at the atomic level, and examining the results, we have been able to discover a particle basis for anomalous semantic interference.\n\nWhen all non-anomalous material was discarded, what remained was five new anomalous particles in a family we have termed 'linguanons'. Extensive experimentation has identified them as:\n\n//Phonemeons//, which affect the irreducible building blocks of meaning, the quantum of language;\n\n//Morphemeons//, which alter words;\n\n//Syntaxions//, which strengthen, weaken or detach the 'glue' binding words into meaningful concepts;\n\n//Semantions//, which inflect the meaning of words to suit context;\n\n//Orthons//, which connect symbols to concepts.\n\nIt is our belief that PoI-382 and his historical colleagues produced these particles thaumaturgically; it is our further belief that, given sufficient time and resources, the process can be replicated.\n\nThe decomposition of anomalous sentences produces syntaxions and semantions as a byproduct. Sentences emit semantions when interacting with other sentences. The decomposition of anomalous individual words produces phonemeons, the base linguanon unit. Words are bound into sentences through strategic bombardment by orthons. The method of producing orthons is unclear; we are, therefore, limited to the use of whatever orthons can be salvaged from existing examples of PoI-382's work. Developing rigorous techniques for applying these processes will allow us to replicate, though initially in a crude manner, his cryptomantic effects.\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/F1.png]][[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/F2.png]][[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/F3.png]][[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/F4.png]][[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/F5.png]]\n[[/=]]\n\nThe emblem PoI-382 created for \"Scout's Cargo Packing,\" which generates an impenetrable aura of secrecy around it, is an excellent case subject for describing the effects of each particle. We separated all varieties of linguanon save one from an instance of the sign, and observed its effects on observers. With only the phonemeons present, the sign gave observers an inexplicable sense of \"something [being] off.\" The morphemeons caused observers to forget the meanings of the words \"Scout's,\" \"Cargo,\" and \"Packing.\" The syntaxions made the sign immensely fascinating. The semantions caused observers to associate the words \"Scout's,\" \"Cargo,\" and \"Packaging\" with concepts related to secrecy or stealth. The orthons, most startlingly, revealed the existence of the SCP Foundation to observers! Each particle introduced a new nuance into the existing symbology of the English language words imprinted on the sign, working in concert to produce the effacing effect.\n\n**Proposal:** Based on these findings, we assert the need for a comprehensive schedule of research into what we are calling QUANTUM LINGUAPHYSICS. The end goal of this schedule is the achievement of what we are calling PRAGMATICS, complete mastery over the field of cryptomancy -- including the artificial production of each particle, orthons in particular. To demonstrate the attainment of that goal, we commit to the eventual production of an overarching thaumaturgic shield for all SCP Foundation activities, tentatively named THE FRONTISPIECE. Working in concert with linguanon-saturated imagery, this measure should permanently defuse the present geopolitical crisis.\n\n**Executive Summary:** Quantum linguaphysics will allow the SCP Foundation to redefine the relationship between actual and perceptual reality.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Site Directors' Executive Council of the Whole strenuously objected to this project on the basis of its potential to injure the combined cognition of mankind. The research group acknowledged this point in private correspondence with Site-01. The O5 Council's response was to suspend all meetings of the Executive Council until the conclusion of the Panopticon Crisis, at which point they would be free to again air their concerns.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Cheyenne.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance.|\n     width=300px |\n    align=left\n]]\n\nCrocker’s campaign against the Foundation continued. In early February, whilst the Foundation was attempting to negotiate a new treaty with the People’s Republic of China, she used cryptomancy to instil a sense of severe paranoia in Chairman Mao Zedong (who had made the unusual decision to attend the talks in person). Mao specifically believed that the proxy for O5-10, Dr. Amity Noble, was wearing recording equipment broadcasting to western intelligence-gathering bases. The talks rapidly deteriorated until Mao ordered the People's Liberation Army to forcibly eject the Foundation representatives. While Dr. Noble was able to escape unharmed, this event left the Foundation without any foothold in China until after the end of the Cold War.\n\nDr. Noble discovered a note in her personal effects upon arriving safely at Site-01:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nFive minutes to midnight.\n[[/div]]\n\nCrocker went on to infiltrate Site-95[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A facility discovered by the Foundation in Alaska, notable for containing twelve large rooms whose gravity matches that found on other bodies in the solar system while maintaining a terrestrial atmosphere, making it useful for testing of space technology; the origin of this facility remains unclear.[[/span]] for a period of two months. She alerted President Nixon to its existence, and Nixon ordered the US Army to storm and occupy the facility for the sake of national security. It is believed that USGOV intended to use Site-95 to falsify photographic evidence in the event that the Apollo program proved fruitless. Ultimately, Apollos 9-12, 14-17, and 19 were all successful in their missions to the moon, with Apollo 13 famously suffering a mechanical error and Apollo 18 [REDACTED], rendering the occupation moot. Site-95 would only be ceded back to the Foundation in November of 2001.\n\nAs the urgency of the Frontispiece project mounted, Drs. Euler, Okorie and Reynders began confronting the reality of what they were about to do. It became apparent that only direct contact with, and alteration of, the collective human consciousness would be able to effect the changes required to make the Frontispiece operative. Having intensively studied the budding field of noetics via the works of chemist Vladimir Vernadsky and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Dr. Okorie declared the experiment technically possible. Troubled by the moral implications and desiring to commit their reasoning to posterity, however, each doctor typed a single note to be opened only when the full history of this event might finally be written.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-8\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-8\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"margin-top: 12px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFE9D9; padding: 6px; width: 700px\"]]\n**FROM THE DESK OF ILSE REYNDERS**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nCommunication.\n@@ @@\nIt's the only way I interact with the world.

She began killing Foundation personnel indiscriminately, using cryptomantic runes to induce targeted cardiac arrests or aneurysms; the runes would then dissipate before causing collateral damage. In May of 1969, Crocker used one of the first known instances of an auditory cryptomantic agent (embedded in a recording of The Beatles' \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\") to kill ten members of Foundation personnel meeting in a safe house in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Produce.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance.|\n     width=300px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\nWhile ignorant of the Foundation's reverse-engineering of the Frontispiece, Zwist had supplied a series of single-use counteragents to Crocker’s cryptomantic assaults. These typically took the form of text and/or imagery which appeared at first glance to be non-anomalous[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]One instance, which remains framed in the Director’s Office at Site-43, is a replica of René Magritte’s //The Treachery of Images//; long-term exposure leads to complete immunity to hostile cryptomancy.[[/span]] and could easily be concealed until needed. These were now pressed into service, and demand very quickly outpaced supply.\n\nThe research group was now producing linguanons in vast quantities, including a very small supply of orthons. The Shell Construction Partnership oversaw and underwrote the creation of nineteen functioning front companies, primarily those which could be made financially self-sustaining; the Foundation's overall program of SCP research was reduced by nearly forty percent to support the startup costs. While these organizations were not fully immune from persecution, as they would be when the larger work was complete, their cryptomancy-empowered logos were sufficiently disorienting to enemy agents to supply a field advantage to Foundation operatives worldwide.\n\nThis chain of events came to a head when Crocker, leading a squadron of OSAT agents, commandeered a Foundation vehicle and used it to infiltrate Site-43 on 07/04/1969.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-9\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-9\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**17:15** | Topside cameras show an armoured truck labelled with the \"Strauss Contract Policing\" logo entering  Camp Ipperwash.

The Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce began an intensive procedural review to determine how she was able to infiltrate their ranks so effortlessly, issued a warrant for her capture, and withdrew from Camp Ipperwash after issuing an official apology to the Foundation. (Notably absent was any admission of wrongdoing on their part.) No further interference with the Frontispiece program was experienced, and Drs. Euler and Okorie prepared to implement it at Site-01 (with Dr. Reynders participating remotely via radio) by special dispensation from the O5 Council on 07/09/1969.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-10\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-10\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Sorry you couldn't be here, Ilse.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** I'm used to it.

Dr. Euler clears his throat.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Thank you for joining us.\n\n//Dr. Euler gestures to the collection of covered white booths which fill the room.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** There are twenty-six thaumatologists in this room, myself and Dr. Okorie included. Twenty-four of them are sealed in soundproof cubicles, containing a table, a chair, and one piece of white cardstock printed with a single letter of the alphabet.\n\n//Drs. Okorie and Euler hold up their own cards, printed with the letters \"Y\" and \"Z\" respectively.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** We will be conducting an experiment in chained remote reading today; if it works, we will be implementing Project FRONTISPIECE in its entirety. The first thaumatologist will focus on their letter; beyond keeping their mental safeguards down, that will be their only role today. The next thaumatologist will focus on their letter, but also remote read the first. The third thaumatologist will focus on //their// letter, and remote read the second -- and, by extension, the first as well. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** As we move down the line, each thaumatologist will be receiving more and more mental signals, containing the thought patterns of more and more of their fellow readers via mental daisy chain. Through this nuanced network of noetic signals they will begin to glimpse the contours of the sphere of reason, our shared conceptual network.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** We are essentially using thaumatologists to create a three-dimensional mental snapshot of the alphabet. We will be locating, in the human //zeitgeist,// the letters S, C, and P. And with a significant expenditure of energy, informed by the collective unconscious of our hand-picked thaumatologic collective, we will be altering them.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Dr. Euler will perform the most directed thaumaturgy, as only he will have a complete picture of the alphabet -- by reading all twenty-five of us at once, and his own letter, and envisioning the mental web. I will assist him with my imperfect understanding. Every thaumatologist involved in this project has been fortified with mnestics and mind-focusing agents, to help mitigate the severe psychological strain we expect to experience. We have furthermore re-routed nearly the entire electrical system of this Site into a concentrated oriykalkos-core reactor; we need access to that much raw thaumic energy to make such an unprecedented intervention even remotely possible.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Two points must be emphasized. First: this experiment is only feasible because of a lucky accident, a mistake made by the cryptomancer from whom we have co-opted these powers. I do not believe it will be possible for us to replicate this effect for the other letters of the alphabet, or to attempt any other alterations on this scale. I furthermore do not believe there will ever be sufficiently convincing reason to try, as the risk of permanently damaging worldwide human cognition is far too high.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** We are agreed on this point.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Even within the limits we have set, this experiment carries a non-zero risk of permanent knock-on effects for human thought.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** This point as well.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Furthermore, nearly every trained remote reader presently employed by the SCP Foundation is in this room right now, and we imagine as many as three-quarters of them could be badly injured, possibly even killed, by the strain of holding this many mental images in their minds simultaneously. We believe this to be a once-in-a-lifetime act, even by the standards of our honoured guests, only justifiable as an alternative to the complete destruction of the Foundation and therefore the human race.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Do we proceed?\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**O5-1:** Well?\n\n**O5-4:** Aye.\n\n**O5-7:** Aye.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The empty post had finally been filled one day prior to this experiment, with the anticipation of a diminished threat from Elizabeth Crocker.[[/span]] \n\n**O5-12:** Aye.\n\n**O5-8:** Yes.\n\n**O5-9:** Aye.\n\n**O5-11:** Aye.\n\n**O5-1:** I vote aye as well.

Let's hope our work translates more directly.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nThough both Drs. Euler and Okorie were severely drained by the process, the Frontispiece was successfully applied. Within two weeks its obfuscatory effects could be observed worldwide, as fronts which had formerly offered only limited protection now thoroughly frustrated enemy agents and offered obvious succour to Foundation operatives. It was found that continuing to apply linguanons to each sign produced an amplified effect; the practice therefore continued, as did research into more sophisticated applications.\n\nThe creation of new front organizations took place at a feverish pace. The Foundation re-established its revenue streams, and was able to fully resume normal functions in the western world by June of 1970. By 1971, revenue had reached the point where ten new high-cost containment Sites could be built each year. Governmental relations were essentially 'reset' during this period; each outgoing administration carried their anomie towards the Foundation with them, and the Frontispiece prevented the new arrivals from acquiring the leverage their predecessors had enjoyed. The Panopticon Crisis was essentially over.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Frontispiece2.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001, selected examples //in situ//.|\n    align=center|    \n    width=700px|\n]]\n\nDr. Euler took up permanent residence at Site-43 as the head of the new Mimesis and Cryptomancy Section, known today as Memetics and Countermemetics, and intensified the Foundation's investigation of anomalous writing and speech.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 001-3, Panopticon Crisis Aftermath:**  In August of 1971, an incident in the German Democratic Republic exposed a crucial vulnerability in the Frontispiece.\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-11\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-11\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Dr. Scout is in his office when Dr. Euler suddenly enters, slamming open the door.

But... we've run into a major complication with the Frontispiece.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** What happened?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** It failed at the Berlin Wall when we tried to extract some stranded agents. Damn border guards only read Cyrillic. Opened fire on the convoy.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Son of a bitch. Reynders was worried about that. Casualties?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Three wounded, one dead.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Dammit. We were supposed to expand into the Bloc before the end of the year. Do you think Crocker...?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I don't, actually. It's like she gave up completely the moment we put the Frontispiece in place.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** That hardly seems likely, but I suppose it's not important at the moment. This new problem, on the other hand... reconvene the research group, and--\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I might already have a solution, actually. There's this artist in New York, he's rather popular back in America -- for reasons I can't fathom. I figured there might be something more to it, so I reduced his work.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Just because you can't see the appeal in an artist doesn't mean he's exerting mind control, Arik.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** No, but... In his paintings and photographs, I found the same kind of alterations between phonemeons and orthons that we exploited for the Frontispiece. The man has the gift, in both senses of the word.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** You're telling me there's a //giftschreiber// working out of New York, as an artist?\n\n**Dr. Euler:** I'm not sure he even knows what he is. But it made me realize: if he can use his gift with cryptomancy to make people enjoy his work, maybe we can repurpose it? I'm on a flight to New York in the morning, acting as an interested patron.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** How will we be able to use art to conceal ourselves from the Russians? The Chinese? Even Japan's growing tired of us, at this point.\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Well... we mainly conceal ourselves using logos, yes? And logos are a form of art -- or so this man thinks. He parodies them, exploits iconography, and essentially tries to point out the absurdity of--\n\n//Dr. Euler pauses.//\n\n**Dr. Euler:** Apparently his cryptomancy also includes inducing unprompted navel-gazing art critique.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** This artist sounds... familiar.

This action inadvertently brought PoI-922's attention to his own innate cryptomancy, of which he had previously been ignorant. Following his death in 1987, members of PoI-922's workshop would form the artistic terrorist group \"Are We Cool Yet?\" using his cryptomantic art as the basis for their own interventions.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Sigil.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001-1 instance.|\n     width=600px |\n    align=center\n]]\n\nIn 1975 O5 Command ordered a sweeping overhaul of Foundation nomenclature, standardizing the SEKTANA Object Class system[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, Apollyon, Neutralized, Archon.[[/span]] and discontinuing terms such as 'thaumatology', 'deific' and 'eigenweapon'. While several of these decisions have been revised or reversed in the intervening years, the terms 'Quantum Linguaphysics' and 'cryptomancy' remain discontinued, as does the 'imagomancy' performed by PoI-922. All three of these terms are now jointly covered by the blanket term //memetics.// \n\nElizabeth Crocker eventually resurfaced in Canada, having founded a think-tank known as the Righting History Institute under the assumed identity of conservative political scientist Ophelia Righting. The Righting Institute had been working with a //giftschreiber// front in order to [/scp-5054-ex disrupt the 1979 Canadian federal election]. A team of thaumaturges under the direction of Dr. Okorie raided the Righting Institute and drove out the //giftschreiber// in late 1979, though no prisoners were taken and Crocker again escaped custody.\n\nOn January 1st, 1980, Dr. Okorie was found dead in his family home, apparently murdered by an unknown assailant. Three weeks later it was discovered that he had used thaumaturgy to capture audio of the events leading up to his death and imprint them on an EP vinyl record originally containing the Marvin Gaye album //What's Going On//.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Expand Log 001-12\" hide=\"Hide Log 001-12\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//The sound of a television playing// Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1980 //is heard for the first ten minutes of the recording.

If it were fifty-two, sixty, even //seventy// percent, the Foundation wouldn't have looked.\n\n**Crocker:** Not the most audacious thing we've done. But this was... a test run.

Plus... you didn't hear it from me, but Ronnie's brain is going to look more like a sponge than a sweetmeat in a few years. Your Frontispiece won't work very well on someone with Alzheimer's.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Good luck with that. We know how to fight you, now.\n\n**Crocker:** Yes, thank god for that. Thilo's kept his tools to himself for far too long, it was good of you to liberate them for us.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** What?\n\n//Crocker laughs.//\n\n**Crocker:** That stroke of luck with \"SCP\" didn't seem a little too convenient? All three of the English language's most magical word-starters, lined up in a neat little row in your outrageously ponderous name. \"The Foundation,\" now //that// was impersonal and frightening. I don't know how she convinced you all to change it; \"The Secure, Contain, Protect Foundation\"? So damn goofy! \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Who's \"she\"? You had someone on the inside? //Decades// ago?\n\n**Crocker:** Until very, very recently. O5-7 says \"hi,\" by the way, best of luck to her replacement. She's really enjoying retirement; lots of time to focus on her Writing, now.\n\n//Crocker laughs.//\n\n**Crocker:** Why the long face? Don't give us too much credit. We never dreamed it would pay off like this; we figured that when Thilo finally noticed that dangling initialism, and saw you running around zapping witnesses and abducting children and all that fun stuff, he'd use it to throttle you. We've wanted you out of the way for, well, for ever, and this looked like just the ticket. We never figured out how Thilo manages his //real// magic, the really big //spiritus mundi//-mucking stuff, or we'd have done it ourselves. We were so damn sure he'd take the bait, though... but, instead, he sat on it. For decades. Then he turned around and made nice with you! That occasioned a change of plans, I don't mind admitting.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** I thought we were the planners? I thought you were an anarchist, and a woman of the people. Or was that just another smokescreen? \n\n//Dr. Okorie laughs harshly.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Oh, who am I talking to? The woman who helped shore up apartheid. You're about as liberal-minded as Margaret Thatcher.\n\n**Crocker:** That really hurts, coming from the man who prodded every single live human being in the brain just ten years back. But sure, I'll admit, I played a fun little game with you. Once we knew for certain that poor, addled Thilo would rush to your defense in a moment of crisis, we had to manufacture one. Or two. Or dozens on dozens of them. I'm only sorry it took so long to prime the world to turn on you. Mmm, it was like Christmas when Seven handed me that list of all your worst security gaps. I could barely decide which scab to pick at first! Which nation to liberate.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Drop the act. We're not fascists, and you're no liberator. You're a thug.\n\n**Crocker:** You're a thug for tyrants. I'm a thug for principle.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Bullshit. You could have spent the last ten years tearing down dictators and building up bridges, instead of siccing the actual tyrants on us. With your abilities, and the clout you used to have, you could've helped kill tyranny stone dead. Why didn't you?\n\n**Crocker:** Priorities. With your reach and your resources, cryptomancy could be a global phenomenon within the span of one generation just so long as you had a compelling reason to pursue it. We made you into our own private think-tank, and the best part is, even if you'd known it was happening, you wouldn't have been able to stop.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Why didn't you--\n\n**Crocker:** --do the whole thing ourselves? We're small potatoes, sad to say, stuck at the one-to-one scale. We have to get things done through influence. The only way anyone was ever going to figure out how to match Thilo at his own game was through cold, hard science, and nobody's colder or harder than you lot. I don't know if you know this, but anarchists? Not as prone to science as the movies would have you believe. And can you even imagine how hard it is to //organize// them? Fascists, though, fascists love their experiments, and they're //such// big builders. We planted the idea in your heads, and you ushered in a whole new goddamn age for us. All that structure, finally good for something.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You can't honestly think you've won. Once Overwatch finds out--\n\n**Crocker:** --they'll do nothing. They've got plans within plans within plans, just like I've been telling you all along. Showing you, even. You think they didn't know the price of the power you gave them? They just didn't care, Izaak. As long as they imagine that they can control the burn, they'll let the fire spread. But it isn't their fire. It's mine, and it's yours, and really it belongs to everyone. Now some day, thanks to us, everyone's going to have it. \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** This sounds like a prepared speech. You've never struck me as a true believer, Elizabeth.\n\n**Crocker:** My motives are my own busin--\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Your motives are transparent. It was all laid out in that first note you sent, remember? You needed someone to blame, and you made up a reason. All this death and destruction because you couldn't cope with what you'd lost, with the fact that it was nobody's fault but yours. You tried to make it everybody's fault. But Alexand--\n\n//Gunshot on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You //bitch!//\n\n**Crocker:** His name was //Hill//. Not Alexandre, not Dr. Hilbert, //Hill//. That's all I knew him as, that's what I'll remember him as. It's the least I can do for him.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** And what would he think if he could see you now? Would he be proud of what you've done? \n\n//He laughs, and coughs.// \n\n**Dr. Okorie:** And your reasons?

The O5 Council dismissed these demands, citing the invaluable protection conferred by the Frontispiece and the need to prepare for the worldwide escalation of memetics prophesied by Crocker (and attested by the formation of Are We Cool Yet?).\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Properties.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-001 instance.|\n     width=300px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\nCrocker herself remained active throughout the 1980s, passing on her knowledge of cryptomancy in the USA and Canada, in particular falling in with members of the 'phone phreaking' community; she may have been involved in the 1980 ARPANET Crash, as signs of cryptomancy proliferated through it, then the CSNET, and finally the internet.\n\nAs she had predicted, President Reagan proved less susceptible to SCP-001 than Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter, to the point where he promised to expose the Foundation in February of 1981. The attempt on his life on March 30th provided the Foundation an opportunity to expose him to memetic reinforcements while he received treatment at George Washington University Hospital. How Crocker knew of Reagan's Alzheimer's Disease over a decade before his official diagnosis remains unknown. \n\nIt is believed that Crocker is deceased as of 2021, barring access to [[[SCP-8443|anomalous life extension means]]]; she would now be over one hundred years old. Fragmentary evidence suggests that an individual fitting her rough description was involved in the re-election of President George W. Bush in 2004, however, and the name \"Ophelia Righting\" appears on a roster of campaign staff. \"Lisbet Geschenk,\" another likely alias, is on a list of financial donors.\n\nFor nearly four decades Dr. Euler refused, on practical grounds, to consider further alterations to the noosphere. The O5 Council also approached Dr. Reynders, who claimed to have exhausted her insights into the field of memetics. Dr. Euler declared the research group defunct, and was transferred to Site-87 in 1984. He and Dr. Ryan Melbourne collaborated on several more immediately practical projects, including the Memetic Resistance Index, Cognitive Resistance Value Index, and the Euler-Melbourne Memetic Resistance Test -- all designed to combat the effects of cryptomantic proliferation.\n\nWhen he was again pressured to resume large-scale experimentation in 2007, Dr. Euler travelled to Site-01 and demanded a formal injunction.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/OldEuler.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. Arik Euler, 2007.|\n     width=200px |\n    align=left\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou want me to make you a Zwist Army Knife, a tool for every occasion, and that's fine.

Though the work he carried out before and since represents the foundation of modern memetics, all experiments conducted subsequent to the Frontispiece -- including the BERRYMAN-LANGFORD Project, and the Lillihammer Cognitohazard Register -- continue to operate on individual cognition. Periodic votes are, however, held by the O5 Council to overturn Dr. Euler's objections to wide-range noetic tampering. As of this writing, the objections stand by a narrow margin; a slim majority of the Council believes that the inadvertent and inconvenient spread of memetics knowledge is directly attributable to the Frontispiece project, as Crocker suggested in 1980, and that repeating this experience could prove unwise.\n\nFive decades of continuous experimentation has improved the individual memetic effects of all new memetic signage, before taking into account the blanket coverage of the Frontispiece effect; though older instances are therefore less efficient, subjecting them to acroamatic recycling is now a low priority due to the relative ease of modern linguanon production.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Camps.jpg|\n    caption=Obsolete SCP-001 instances decomposing.|\n    align=center|    \n    width=100%|\n]]\n\nAll SCP-001 media still retain the singular flaw allowing individuals familiar with the anomalous to see through their effects. While occasionally useful in the event the Foundation must coordinate with organizations such as OSAT, the Global Occult Coalition, the FBI's Unusual Incidents Unit, the British Occult Service or Poland's ZM \"Witch Slayer\" Division, this is more often than not a detriment to efficient clandestine operations. Many theories have been advanced to explain this curious defect, and the discovery of a note from Thilo Zwist in Dr. Euler's effects after his death in 2013 has provided fertile ground for further speculation. It has been dated to 1980, the year of Dr. Okorie's murder.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFE9D9; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\nArik,\n\nI don't know if you saw me at the funeral, but I was there. You and your fallen friend have borne the weight of your deeds most admirably, these past few years -- though I would not have done the things you did, I can understand your reasons. To a certain extent. I myself have acted more rashly on such sympathetic impulses (though not for a few centuries).\n\nYou alone now carry the responsibility. You must ensure that what you did can never again be done, ensure that it was worth doing in the first place, and most of all ensure that you -- only you -- can do it again, should the worst come to pass. You must also remember how seductive a quick and dirty solution can be, and show your successors where the pitfalls lie. It is not enough that your apprentices succeed you; they must also excel you.\n\nThe Foundation protects the world. You sometimes like to imagine you do it alone, reciting comfortable, meaningless aphorisms to cover a great deal of violence, cupidity, ruthlessness and cruelty. You will forgive me if I hope you do not find your burdens light. \n\nAnd you don't, do you? Is the Frontispiece that perfect creation you imagined it would be, as your equations and diagrams assure you it //must// in fact be, or does the wind keep rushing beneath it, exposing you to the surrounding climate? Again you will forgive me if I consider this outcome ideal. You will never be completely safe, you will never, ever be able to act with total impunity. You will need to keep cultivating allies, cutting deals and making friends -- ones you have not only protected, but genuinely supported and loved, who will support and love you back. \n\nIf you did not have to do these things, I fear that you would not.\n\nBecause you, like me, are only human.\n\nWhen you are gone, I suppose your responsibilities will fall to me. I played my part in this little drama, after all, and played it well. Too well; you probably think you pulled quite the fast one on me, breaking down all those van panels and poking around in the particles. But your magic umbrella was only borrowed, not mastered or even properly understood. I know nothing of baking bread, I admit, but I am an expert //parasolmacher.// My handiwork cannot be bent or broken unless I wish it.\n\nWas it a nasty little trick to play? Perhaps, but you need to stop falling for such simple deceits. The world cannot long afford your naiveté. In future, when you wield a tool, be certain that you fully understand it.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Apickman-blank-proposal-offset-1/Sign.jpg|\n    caption=Enclosed photograph.|\n     width=300px |\n    align=right\n]]\n\nFinally, a warning. I do not remember the anger I felt all those long years ago, the grief I poured into the words which poisoned a thousand thousand minds. I am still dealing with the fallout, but that great and awful blast... I cannot feel it anymore. Time wears away such things. \n\nIf you forget why your consciences balked at the critical hour, Arik, if you begin to lose sight of what separated you from Elizabeth Crocker, or start to become the monsters she accused you of being... if you begin to see the world as a chessboard, and all its people pawns, and grant yourselves the right to fuel extravagant strategies with their lives...\n\nBut no, you won't, of course you won't. You don't need this warning at all, because your course was set the moment I baked that lovely little flaw into the Writing which you stole. I robbed you of the opportunity to become the tyrants of all our nightmares. You will have no choice but to be better than that, because evil only flourishes in ease. You will never know ease. You, and those who come after you, will need to keep doing the work.\n\nYou __will__ get to decide how well you do it, of course. And on that matter, I have a suggestion:\n\nDo it right.\n\nStop Compromising Principles.\n\n[[=]]\n//-- Thilo//\n[[/=]]\n\nN.B. Ideas are flame, and flames burn 'til the fuel is spent. You have opened the Writing to mankind; you have made kindling of us all.\n\nLook to your [/scp-6382 firebreaks].\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5243-video-transcripts SCP-5243 Video Transcripts]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[The Martinet Effect]]]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
