[[/footnote]] device, which they are to activate as a last resort in case exit becomes impossible. In case of activation, an emergency contingent of modified Scranton Reality Anchors are to rapidly increase the Hume levels around SCS-74.

All documentation on SCP-8118 prior to the abandonment of SCS-74 has been lost within the structure, making identification of the anomaly a priority for Observers sent into the building housing it. Due to the hostile terrain on location, as well as severe anomalous energy fluctuations within SCS-74, the information recovered from these assignments is limited at best. Debriefs following every attempt at exploration within the area of influence of SCP-8118 have revealed the following information:\n\n* SCP-8118 is capable of altering the environments within SCS-74, spontaneously rearranging the internal structure of its environment. Despite this, SCS-74 will generally look similar to other Foundation sites constructed in the late 20th century.\n\n* The interior of SCS-74 is devoid of natural light, despite the windows visible from the exterior of the structure. Artificial sources of light are noted throughout the site, although the environment remains poorly illuminated at all times. Theories surrounding a negative interaction between natural light and SCP-8118 have been widely accepted within FLAT BOX personnel, and its fundaments are utilized in the inner workings of GIVEN CRY.\n\n* Doorways and hallways are particularly affected by spatial distortion within SCS-74, with several rooms connecting to their own entrances and exits. Despite this, the internal structure shows no signs of non-Euclidean topology, and the effect has been ascribed to sudden displacement of the Observer in conjunction with rapid changes in the environment.\n\n* SCP-8118's alterations to the environment have been known to mimic familiar environments and favor certain common elements. This has been used to ascribe a degree of sentience to the anomaly, although this is unconfirmed at this time.\n\n* Some level of psychic interference occurs as a direct effect of being within the range of SCP-8118's anomalous effect field. Observer subjects have referred to significant auditory and visual hallucinations that persist for the entirety of their assignment, compounded by spatial distortions that accent and accommodate said hallucinations. This has been observed in every exploration to SCP-8118, regardless of Cognitive Resistance Value or mental reinforcement of any kind.\n\n* One of the few references to SCP-8118 within the Foundation's database that remains uncorrupted stresses the danger in allowing SCP-8118 to come into direct contact with brain matter. Although the significance of this warning remains unclear, the suggested courses of action in case this happens have been deemed severe enough to make this warning a top priority. The deployment of GIVEN CRY was determined to be necessary by the Ethics Committee in order to abide by this warning.\n \n@@ @@\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**Addendum-8118-A** \n//Documentation of Observer Assignment 15/02/2024.//\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"fragment\" parent=\".\" order=\"random\" limit=\"5\" offset=\"@URL|0\"]]\n%%content%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| previous-url = /\n| next-url = scp-8724\n| next-title = SCP-8724\n| hub-url = /\n| hub-title = ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓\n]]",
