It is in the American people's best interest to ensure a safe and competent acquisition of the western territories from our conquered neighbor.\n\nIt won't be long now before our hands of justice embrace both seas of this glorious homeland; with the grace of God and the knowledge of our Forefathers, we will emerge from the bloodshed born anew, with revitalized determination for our destiny.  With this, I call upon all citizens that hail the United States his home to duty; to uphold his sacred honor to self, God, and country, to respect the authority of his elected governors, and to fulfill his purpose to this blessed soil. Victory will not elude us; with the glory of this great authority, we will prevail.\n\nWith conviction everlasting, done at the City of Washington the eighth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-six, and of the independence of the United States the seventieth.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[>]]\n**JAMES K.

Captain Frémont had us march at noon so that the natives could witness our military might in the light of day. We packed for a show, not a fight. Our cannons were empty and our rifles were sparsely prepared. \n\nWe got within eyeshot of the town before a volley of fire rained on our convoy. We all scattered; I caught a glimpse of the Captain on his mount turn and ride for cover. I hid behind a mound until the volley ceased. I couldn't tell how many were wounded or killed, but the fire was heavy and sustained. I would have thought the natives had been trained; if their aim hadn't been so lousy.\n\nBefore we could return fire, a booming voice echoed around us. \n\nI looked up to see a huge man, covered in navy blue wool and leather straps. He spoke with a slight Spanish accent, yet I felt I had known his voice all my life. A glittering rapier rested on his belt, and his wide-brimmed hat covered his face in shadows.\n\n\"Invaders, you are trespassing on the soil of this new nation. You have one chance, and one chance only, to return to your camps before we return you to your camps by force,\" he bellowed. \"My men will not miss the next time we fire.\"\n\nIt was then when we heard the Captain's trumpet sing its song of retreat, that we graciously fled to the cover of the trees at the far end of the hills.  Not a single shot rang as we made our escape. \n\nI don't know what to make of today's events. No one spoke of an army in California, so why is one here? And who was their general? I will write more in the morning; it's getting late and we're regrouping with the 7th battalion for a second assault on San Fransisco tomorrow.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[size 150%]]\n//President James K.
