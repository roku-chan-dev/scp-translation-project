Thaddeus O'Dell, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\"\n\n------\n\n+++++ <Begin Log>\n\n**<00:00:00>:** O'Dell's body cam switches on, revealing a dark, spacious area resembling a temple. Mosaic murals can be barely seen on the walls and floors through the rays of light from outside. There's a deafening sound from outside like rushing wind, rendering speech during the first five minutes and 27 seconds of audio unintelligible.\n\n**<00:00:26>:** Six other members of ST-48 are alive and accounted for.\n\n**<00:00:39>:** O'Dell orders 48-1 and 48-2 to check their dropship for survivors.\n\n**<00:00:42>:** O'Dell turns to face the dropship. The craft is hanging halfway out of what used to be a blastproof window decorated with turtle motifs.\n\n**<00:00:52>:** The dropship falls outward from the window.\n\n**<00:00:57>:** O'Dell rescinds the order. Remaining personnel: 48-L and 48-1 through -6.\n\n**<00:01:14>:** O'Dell switches his rifle's light on. The others follow suit.\n\n**<00:01:49>:** O'Dell and the rest of the team make their way to a pair of blast doors, which open automatically.\n\n**<00:02:10>:** The team steps through a series of tubelike corridors. Aside from the inital chamber where they landed, there are no flat surfaces.\n\n**<00:05:28>:** The loud noise from outside begins to decrease in pitch and volume.\n\n**<00:05:41>:** (Crew audio comes in clearly for the first time.)\n\n> +++ <Audio Log>\n> \n> **O'Dell:** ...haven't found any hostiles or traps yet, but just getting around is difficult. Feels like I'm trying to jog across the halfpipes at a skate park. Most of the doors here are on the ceilings. This whole place was designed with zero-grav in mind. And as much as I'd like to go back to base and grab some magnetic shoes so we can stop slipping all the goddamn time -\n> \n> **48-3:** Wait. \n> \n> **O'Dell:** Can it, I'm trying to log here.\n> \n> **48-3:** But I can hear you now!\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Then prove it by listening to... hold up, yeah, I wasn't able to hear you before. What the hell?\n> \n> **48-4:** Maybe it's powering down.\n> \n> **48-3:** Huh?\n> \n> **48-4:** The ship, I mean. Doesn't that sound like heavy machinery slowing down?\n> \n> **O'Dell:** That's ridiculous. Tarrare hasn't slowed down once since it got here.\n> \n> **48-5:** And we're the first ones who boarded the ship.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Don't be stu -- ...hmm.\n> \n> **48-6:** I have a theory.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** The floor is yours.\n> \n> **48-6:** Whoever's piloting this ship knows they can't continue the mission until they're sure they know whatever boarded them has been neutralized.\n> \n> **48-1:** I'll second that.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** I mean, we didn't exactly sneak in. Weapons up, but keep going.\n> \n> **48-5:** {{I want to go through the Party Door.}}\n> \n> **48-1:** What?\n> \n> **O'Dell:** What?\n> \n> **48-5:** What?\n> \n> **O'Dell:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **48-5:** By what?\n> \n> **O'Dell:** You just said you want to go through the -\n> \n> **48-5:** I didn't say anything!\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ [TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**<00:15:57>:** O'Dell's team enters an elaborate series of tubes throughout the ship. Other than their lamps, only light sources come from a series of rapidly changing and undulating glyphs on the wall, the majority of which are orange. \n\n**<00:21:12>:** 48-5 once again says that she wants to {{\"go through the Party Door.\"}}\n\n**<00:22:31>:** 48-5 once again denies having said anything.\n\n**<00:24:07>:** The team comes to the top floor of one of the towers on SCP-001's upper deck. The chamber appears to be a shrine to a deity represented by a turtle with 27 hands, holding a flute.\n\n**<00:25:34>:** 48-1 and -2 take photographs - the latter of the shrine's interior, and the former of the rest of the ship, visible from observation windows.\n\n**<00:28:40>:** 48-5 points out of one of the windows toward the center of SCP-001.\n\n> +++ <Audio Log>\n> \n> **48-5:** {{That's where the Party Door lives.}}\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Oh, for God's sake...\n> \n> **48-5:** {{There is a party behind the Party Door and I wish to go there because that's where a party is.}}\n> \n> **48-4:** Wait. Does anyone here have experience with mind-affecting anomalies?\n> \n> **48-2:** -5 does.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** You mean other than right now?\n> \n> **48-2:** She //should// have a high resistance to cognitohazards. The highest out of all of us here, in fact.\n> \n> **48-5:** **{{[https://youtu.be/6Zbi0XmGtMw?feature=shared&t=27 (Hums.)]}}**\n> \n> **48-1:** And doesn't that just fill you with confidence?\n> \n> **48-3:** {{I hear all the cool kids are hanging out at the party which is behind the Party Door and has party things.}}\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Not the time, 3!\n> \n> **48-3:** What? I didn't say --\n> \n> **O'Dell:** //FUCK!//\n> \n> **48-5:** {{I wanna be a cool kid.}}\n\n**<00:32:49>:** The team holds an emergency meeting regarding the possibility of mental interference.\n\n**<00:37:01>:** At a 6-1 vote, the meeting concludes on the decision that Captain O'Dell is a {{\"party-hating nerd\"}}. Everyone but O'Dell deserts.\n\n**<00:38:48>:** O'Dell weeps.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ [TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**<01:48:02>:** After over an hour of encountering identical scenery and impassable passageways, O'Dell enters what appears to be a storage area in the lower decks. There are 18 black, semi-transparent pillars containing organic remains of indeterminate origin. All but one have been shattered.\n\n**<01:48:59>:** O'Dell approaches the pillar that hasn't shattered. His hand comes within five centimeters of what appears to be a control panel. \n\n**<01:49:14>:** An arc of static electricity jumps between his finger and the panel. He yelps.\n\n**<01:49:18>:** The pillar collapses. O'Dell falls backward.\n\n**<01:50:49>:** As he gets back up, his light lands on [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp0012/offset/2 a 2.5-meter-tall crustacean entity] emerging from the collapsed pillar's liquid. Its neck and many legs are covered in an elaborate series of shackles and metallic cables to impede movement. Withered red shrubbery can be seen on the back of the entity's shell.\n\n**<01:51:01>:** O'Dell instinctively draws his pistol at the entity.\n\n**<01:51:05>:** The entity bows politely.\n\n**<01:51:14>:** He half-lowers his gun.\n\n**<01:51:30>:** The entity speaks from an electronic device in its collar. The voice is feminine.\n\n> +++ <Audio Log>\n> \n> **Entity:** It would seem that you have rescued me. That's rather nice of you.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** You speak English?\n> \n> **Entity:** I speak what I please. //(Indicating the collar)// Your perception fills in the blanks. On whose authority have you come to save me?\n> \n> **O'Dell:** I wasn't planning on saving anyone. This ship's tearing my planet apart. I came to destroy it.\n> \n> //(He raises the gun again.)//\n> \n> You wouldn't happen to have something to do with that, would you?\n> \n> **Entity:** That's... curious. This is no warship. This is an asteroid-harvesting vessel of the Threll Dominion. They haven't been at war with anyone in 184 {{**[succulent maraschino cherries]**}}. At least, not anyone who could fight back.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** I'm gonna go ahead and assume you meant to say \"space year.\"\n> \n> **Entity:** Hmm. I sense great confusion in your soul.\n> \n> //(He lowers the gun completely.)//\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Then let's start over. My name's Captain Thaddeus O'Dell.\n> \n> **Entity:** My people's names are difficult to translate. I am **{{//[Muh-muh-muh-Myyyy Sharona!]//}}** of the **{{[WEASELS?!]}}**.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Of //course// you are.\n> \n> --Entity:-- **Sharona:** I also sense that the name \"Threll\" means nothing to you.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Aliens?\n> \n> **Sharona:** Very much so, even to their own homeworld. They're a nomadic fleet of merchants spanning countless dimensions -- comparable to the Silk Road of you earthlings. Though alive, their progenitor was born among the dead: HAJHETI[[footnote]](Pron. Ha-ZHAY-tee}[[/footnote]] of the Primrose Deep. Sixth Prince of Corbenic. Lord of commerce, trade, and hierarchies.\n> \n> //(Indicating her shackles.)//\n> \n> Everything the Threll have created -- including this ship -- runs on the power of an unwilling host. \n> \n> Autonomous machines are against the word of HAJHETI. There has to be an element of subjugation in all aspects of Threll existence. Even something as simple as a Threll-made knife requires a little animal grafted to its handle for posterity.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Damn. So what was your function?\n> \n> **Sharona:** Teleportation. My people's specialty. Before I was put back to sleep, my last orders were, roughly translated, to \"shunt this vessel into one of the expendable dimensions on this list before that idiot cooks the whole fleet.\"\n> \n> **O'Dell:** And who was 'that idiot?\"\n> \n> **Sharona:** Hmm. Someone unintelligent, I'd imagine. \n> \n> //(Sharona lumbers out of the pile of debris.)//\n> \n> Let's continue this somewhere devoid of any Threll. I don't believe they've tested a human's \"utility\" yet - best not to stoke their curiosity.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** I haven't seen any other lifeforms.\n> \n> **Sharona:** Oh? Then they must be hiding. I'll check.\n> \n> //(Sharona meditates for five seconds.)//\n> \n> ...my, my. You've been busy.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Huh?\n> \n> **Sharona:** Every Threll on this ship is dead.\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Huh. Well, I wasn't the one who killed them. ...you know, maybe since I saved you and all, you could help me figure this place out? Like, to pay me back.\n> \n> //(Sharona raises her arms.)//\n> \n> **Sharona:** Maybe later. After all, now that there's no longer a master to stop me, {{I think I'll check out the Party Door because I've heard there is a cool kids party on the other side of said Party Door.}}\n> \n> **O'Dell:** Wait! First off, what even //is --//\n> \n> **Sharona:** {{Party time.}}\n> \n> //(Sharona disappears. The space she occupied is replaced with a cloud of heated gases.)//\n> \n> //(O'Dell calls out to the ceiling)//\n> \n> **O'Dell:** //Where's my FUCKING invitation?!// \n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ [TRUNCATED FOR BREVITY]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**<23:12:19>:** The video feed has been out for six hours. Audio can still be heard from O'Dell.\n\n> +++ <Audio Log>\n> \n> **O'Dell:** ...and, I'm back. Just... Just hear me out.\n> \n> I'm out of rations, my crew has abandoned me, and this is a one-way transmitter, so I have //no// idea if anyone on the earth below me is still alive! And there haven't been any more of Yusupov's fucking suicide bombs I MEAN dropships, which means help is NOT coming!\n> \n> But you know what I DO have?! KIND OF a functioning understanding of these stupid hieroglyphs all over the ship! \n> \n> Okay, look - you can't see it, but I'm writing these down. I was looking at this wall for an //inordinately// long amount of time. Several years, in fact![[footnote]](At this point, 23 hours had elapsed since recording began. Cpt. O'Dell has been recommended for a psychiatric evaluation.)[[/footnote]]\n> \n> Some of these symbols look more like what they're supposed to mean than others. This turtle thing is obviously a Threll, or their turtle god, Prince Horchata or something. And if you touch the walls enough - the whole thing's basically a touchscreen. You can even see some photographs. Mostly of Threll congratulating other Threll for doing Threll things. They look like what would happen if a leatherback sea turtle fucked a chimpanzee and their kid was raised by donkeys. I've drawn some pictures of Threll for reference.[[footnote]](Said drawings recovered from O'Dell's notebook were a hastily-drawn comic of a chimpanzee having sexual congress with a sea turtle, along with concept art of a donkey nanny named \"Good Lady Jackenassy.\")[[/footnote]]\n> \n> None of the pictures show any Threll with their mouths open. So, my going theory is that the Threll don't have vocal folds, so they write everything down instead of speaking. And since they do business with so many other cultures in their Silk Road bullshit, it's only natural that they'd want to have a writing system that anyone could understand. Kinda like how Chinook Jargon was used in trading.\n> \n> Anyway, there's this symbol that means \"fire,\" and this one... I wanna say \"traitor.\" And there's this compound-symbol icon keeps showing up in warning prompts, like, a circle of 16 \"fire\" symbols surrounding a \"traitor\" symbol.\n> \n> This Traitor-Flame has been showing up a lot in diagrams of the ship. I keep seeing it near the mouth. It's Tarrare's power source. \n> \n> But why \"traitor?\" That's obvious enough. It's another creature the Threll kidnapped and enslaved. At some point, it must have broken out of containment, killed its masters - along with most of the other slaves, too - and hijacked the ship.\n> \n> If this is true, it means that the Traitor-Flame is also the one responsible for Tarrare \"mining\" our planet to death. But why would it want to take it out on //us?// \n> \n> Then again, the Traitor-Flame hasn't moved from the Mouth area ever since it got here. It's using this ship's hardware to help it consume as much as possible. So, maybe there isn't a vengeful or moral aspect to any of this. Maybe it's just hungry.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> On a related note, regarding this \"Party Door\" business... I might have found the answer in these diagrams.\n> \n> Speculation that the Mouth is its own pocket dimension seems to be correct. Definitely a bigger-on-the-inside situation. An area of nothing but flame, plasma, and the Traitor-Flame, hanging from a thousand power cables connected to the rest of the ship. But from these diagrams, I've been seeing a crack on the third floor - an opening that something had punched through.\n> \n> That must be the Party Door. That's how the Traitor-Flame killed them all - it hypnotized the Threll into walking face-first into their own furnace.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> //(Rumbling and dopey giggling can be heard in the distance, coming closer and closer.)//\n> \n> Oh, right.\n> \n> There's one more thing I forgot to mention.\n> \n> The hypnosis doesn't work on everyone. I'm living proof. So, to round up the stragglers...\n> \n> **[Unknown 1]:** //WOOO hoo hoo! Foogh schnaaba!
