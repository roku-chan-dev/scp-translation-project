Falkirk was attacked by [[[SCP-5056]]] -- a sapient being inhabiting reflective materials -- on the 14th of January, 2003. The attack was presumably precipitated by SCP-5056 identifying Dr. Falkirk as a threat to the object of its undivided attentions: one Philip E. Deering, Janitorial and Maintenance Technician. The means of attack was manifestation on the lens of the left eye. The precise psychological results of this manifestation remain unclear, but significant emotional trauma is indicated as Dr. Falkirk proceeded to manually remove the affected eye. SCP-5056 then manifested on his right eye; when prevented from removing it as well, Dr. Falkirk entered a psychotic state and then, within one hour, a comatose state. He has not recovered in the intervening eighteen years, requiring the following medical procedures: oesophageal tube (for nutrition), ileostomy (for defecation), antipsychotics (during bouts of violent, unconscious activity). Termination has been postponed due to his high security clearance level.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FDF6D7; padding: 6px;\"]]\nTherapeutic Assessment: Bradbury, Dr. Melissa\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;\"]]\nIt's been a long road to recovery. Dr. Bradbury was one of the most promising young researchers at Site-43 in 2002, before SCP-5056 reacted to a period of sustained containment by manifesting on the lens of her eyeglasses, resulting in severe (if apparently indescribable) psychological torment. While remaining on the Site-43 duty roster and capable of light duty in the years that followed, it was not until late 2020 that she was able to confront her fears and return to the Site proper. She now serves in the (largely supervisory) role of Chair of Research and Experimentation, and resides in the dormitories with her partner Dr. Blank.\n\nDr. Bradbury and I have worked out a program of therapeutic interventions to help her continue to adjust:\n* reinforcement therapy (self-applied)\n* psychiatric counselling (three times weekly)\n* self-stimulatory behaviour (satin scarf)\n* enclothed cognition (tight, sturdy, warm clothing)\n* mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\n* control mastery therapy\n* relational life therapy\n\nIt is my professional opinion that Dr. Bradbury is more than capable of continuing to execute her duties, so long as the above measures remain effective. It is my further opinion that every measure must be taken to ensure that no member of staff is perceived as a threat by SCP-5056 -- a threat to itself, or a threat to its subject of focus, Philip E. Deering. It would be inhumane to subject another living being to what Dr. Bradbury has already gone though.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- Dr. N.
