Security is to detain and amnesticize any SCP-8148 instances and store it on site until the conclusion of its according SCP-8148-1 event. Security is permitted to terminate SCP-8148 if it is uncooperative. Once the corresponding SCP-8148-1 event has concluded, the SCP-8148 instance is to be relocated to a permanent humanoid holding cell and is to be contained until SCP-8148 demanifests.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8148 is a 180.34 cm tall Type Blue 27-year-old caucasian male who refers to itself as “Doctor Silvian King.” SCP-8148 believes itself to be a Foundation Researcher of thaumatology.[[footnote]] Magic.[[/footnote]] No Foundation employee has been taught thaumatology due to its anomalous nature. There is also no record of the Foundation employing a \"Doctor Silvian King\" at any point in its history. Despite SCP-8148 visibly aging while in containment, it always remanifests at 27 years old. \n\nSCP-8148’s anomalous effect appears when a Temporary Object-Holding Site contains at least 1 temporary dormitory. Appearing to be asleep, at exactly //00:00//, SCP-8148 may manifest inside the bed of an empty temporary dormitory. The likelihood of an SCP-8148 instance manifesting increases with the number of SCP objects and D-Class stored at the site. SCP-8148 will wake up at //08:00,// and, during the day, will usually attempt to aid staff in their activities. SCP-8148 shows varying degrees of knowledge in the task it attempts to assist in. Its behavior is also highly dependent on manifestation.\n\nSCP-8148 has reacted to staff in a variety of ways ranging from complete obedience to orders given to it, to disregarding staff and acting outwardly violent towards them. On rare occasions, SCP-8148 has attempted to break into on-site armories.\n\nSCP-8148 will stay manifested until its anomalous effects trigger again, at which point it will demanifest and a new manifestation of SCP-8148 will appear. This effect persists after death. Within 24 hours after the manifestation of SCP-8148, SCP-8148-1 will occur. SCP-8148-1 is the breach of containment at the site where SCP-8148 manifested. SCP-8148-1 has been observed containing several different types of breaches, all of which are listed below:\n\n* The breach of Keter Class anomalies.\n* The breach of Euclid class anomalies.\n* The invasion of the Site by an enemy GOI.\n* The invasion of the Site by an anomaly.\n* The escape attempt of D-Class Personnel.\n* The manifestation of a new anomaly.\n\nSCP-8148 believes that it has survived all SCP-8148-1 instances it's interacted with. SCP-8148's behavior is inconsistent along with its memory of all the SCP-8148-1 events it has been involved with, commonly forgetting or referring to SCP-8148-1 events that not occurred. \n\n**Addendum 8148.1-476:** The following is a series of video logs from SCP-8148 manifestations.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Video log #18: 3/14/1953\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 3/14/1953.\n\n**NOTE:** SCP-8148 manifested 2 days after the transfer of SCP-████ onto Temporary Object-Holding Site-12B.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Footage retrieved from the cafeteria located on level 5.//\n\n**16:04:** SCP-8148 enters the cafeteria and sits next to Dr. Carlos Blacke. It and the doctor are seen talking to each other for 22 minutes as they eat.\n\n**16:26:** An SCP-8148-1 event occurs and SCP-████ breaches containment. Alarms start blaring and both SCP-8148 and Dr. Carlos Blacke go to a Breach Shelter.\n\n//Footage retrieved from the camera located in Hallway 5-12B.//\n\n**16:32:** Both SCP-8148 and Dr. Carlos Blacke arrive at BS:5-2[[footnote]] Breach Shelter: 5-2.[[/footnote]].\n\n//Footage retrieved from the camera located in BS:5-2.//\n\n**16:36:** On-site security stationed in the Shelter identify and detain SCP-8148.\n\n**18:43:** MTF successfully recontain SCP-████ and retrieve SCP-8148.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-████ was safely relocated to Site-18. SCP-8148 was transferred to Site-02 and stayed there till its demanifestation 6 weeks later. Dr. Carlos Blacke was interviewed on his conversation with SCP-8148; and stated that he and it were talking about their favorite novels, with SCP-8148 naming several novels that do not exist.[[footnote]] //\"Honestly, I'm surprised my encounter with it felt like just another conversation I'd have with an employee. If it didn't keep mentioning bizarre books like \"Harry Potter,\" I wouldn't have suspected a thing.\"// - Dr. Carlos Blacke.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Video log #72: 9/23/1979\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 9/23/1959.\n\n**NOTE:** Due to several D-Class transfer requests from Site-19, Temporary Object-Holding Site-18B was acceding the recommended maximum capacity for D-Class stored on site.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**11:00:** A group of seven D-Class are returning to their cells, being escorted by two guards. \n\n**11:02:** An SCP-8148-1 event occurs and, before reaching the cell block, three D-Class attack one of the guards while two others attack the second one. They manage to overpower and disarm the guards, shooting them. They proceed to break into the cell block, unlocking all cells in the process. All on-site security is called to deal with the situation.\n\n//Footage retrieved from the camera located in hallway 2-6//\n\n**11:06:** SCP-8148 is seen walking down the hallway when two security guards intercept it. They tell SCP-8148 to retreat deeper into the facility. After 2 minutes of noncompliance from SCP-8148, the two guards identify SCP-8148 and attempt to detain it. SCP-8148 resists and attempts to take one of the guard's firearms. The second guard terminates SCP-8148 and both leave. \n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAll D-Class that contributed to the riot were terminated and incinerated. The 2 security guards that encountered SCP-8148 described that it was attempting to offer its help to resolve the breach. Once identified as an SCP-8148 instance, it became hostile, stating that its arrest was \"unjustified\" and \"unimportant compared to the breach currently occurring.\"\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Video log #194: 12/19/1998\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 12/19/1998.\n\n**NOTE:** Security Officer Thomas Strider had been stationed at the nightshift at the Temporary Dormitories at Temporary Object-Holding Site-02.\n----\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Footage retrieved from the camera located in the Temporary Dormitories hallway.//\n\n**23:46:** Security Officer Thomas Strider breaks into and enters Temporary Dormitory 16.

Security intercepts SCP-8148 and terminates it.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe corpse of Security Officer Thomas Strider was found inside Temporary Dormitory 16 with scorch marks across his body and a bullet in his head. A radio, a blueprint of the site, and several letters with symbols originating from The Chaos Insurgency were found. Several runes were drawn in blood and scratched into the walls around the room. Background checks on Security Officer Thomas Strider confirmed that he had never been hired by the Foundation. Investigations into how he was able to infiltrate security are ongoing.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n> As of 12/7/2005 this page is outdated, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8148/offset/1|access next page?]]]",
