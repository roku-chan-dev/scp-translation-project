I get a sense there is quite a story there, but so far, they are staying tight-lipped as ever, except for us to expect more new friends in the near future.\n\nNot sure what they are doing over there, but it did come with an additional chunk of funding.\n\nFrom the jump, our new friends seem like a handful, but we've never failed to rise to a challenge before. Let's make them feel at home, yeah?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\nCritter Profile: Portia\n[[/div]]\n [[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nOverview!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[f<image Portia.png width=\"300px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731;\" title=\"Portia out for a stroll\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Name:** Portia\n\n**Species:** //Loxodonta africana//\n\n**Primary Caretaker:** Jenni Mallory\n\n**Diet:** Fruits, vegetables, & hay. Supplementary tree branches are offered as enrichment. (Preference for watermelons, has an odd fascination with chewing gum, so be careful!)\n\n**Housed:** Wilson Wildlife Center, Enclosure 84\n\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nCreature Features!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nPortia is the name of the female African Bush Elephant who was remanded to our care following an altercation between the Supervisor and some former staff and their friends. Regardless, she is a sweet and arguably shy giant who has taken quite a liking to her new home and the staff already; I am happy to report!\n\nPortia has a number of quirks; the first, of course, is that she is pink. From the tip of her trunk right down to the pads of her feet and even her blood, as our veterinarians can attest! The intensity and exact color of pink can change, sometimes day from day, but commonly, she stays one shade for a week before going through a transition. We don't know exactly why this is and haven't found any direct tie to her physical health or mental/emotional status.\n\nThe next is that physically, she more closely resembles a male African Bush Elephant than a female, but in temperament and mentality, she remains in line with baseline females.\n\nThe last is that she naturally exudes a pheromone that smells of bubblegum, which causes those around her to feel like they are drunk, but not a sad drunk, but more like a giddy, sleepy drunk. It doesn't actually impair your inhibitions, as I can personally attest, but it does, I suppose, elevate the time spent with her! Which is already fantastic, in my opinion.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[=image portia2.png width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]//Portia after Mudbath//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\nPortia came to us in a situation a bit different from the other new arrivals. About a month ago, Wilson's was attacked by those Snake Finger folks with the guidance of one of our former employees.\n\nFollowing the attack, the supervisors sent some of their people to Portland, Oregon, but they were not sure which. During the raid, they discovered Portia. The boys who brought her in were treating her really sweetly. It's nice to know there are folks within the Supervisors who love critters as much as we do!\n\nInitially, she was fairly nervous around visitors, so we hoped to slowly introduce her to more people as time went on to lessen any possible stress. \n\nRegardless, she's come around to people more and more in the time she's been here and genuinely loves interacting with guests. Thanks to her quirk, she's got quite a fan club, but we try to keep visitor interaction to just a few hours each day. That and we try and get some of the more... odd ducks at arm's length, if you get my drift. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nEnclosure 84 is a perfect fit for her, with plenty of space to roam, lots of shade, and places to swim, but it is rather empty.\n\nElephants are social animals, and leaving them alone is very bad for their mental and emotional well-being. We're looking into finding her a friend, if not a handful to spend time with. We're not sure if her quirk affects other animals like it does Humans, but I have noticed that birds congregate around her more often than our other larger critters. So, only time will tell.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Portia!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nPortia does appear to have a minor form of PTSD, tied explicitly to loud noise, particularly those that sound like gunshots/explosions. Cars backfiring, fireworks, thunder, and due to her much keener hearing, even if you don't hear something, it doesn't mean she can't.\n\nEarly signs include her startling, sudden, frantic trunk wagging and mock charges, which could lead to injuries for those who are not prepared for it. What follows are bouts of depression that we are hoping to lessen with the introduction of other elephants to the enclosure. Right now, being in the presence of staff she trusts during these moments has been incredibly beneficial. A resting area has been placed in the loft of her barn for staff to sleep in to help alleviate her isolation-based stress following these events, but only for that! If I catch you napping in there on your breaks, you will be cleaning one of our nasty bois cages for the next month!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jenni Mallory\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 06/11/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey Fae, we've already begun to see that she is becoming more comfortable around staff and visitors, but it is clear she has her favorites (aka Me!

He's lost three hats to the jokester.\n\nPortia seems to enjoy his company, though she is still a bit standoffish when it comes to sharing the barn and hugging closer to where staff can stay.

Don't engage with them physically unless you think you or one of the animals are in danger. Just let them know you see them. From what Jenni said, that seems to scare them off.

We're gonna be keeping a close eye on him; Jenni has practically moved into the enclosure since she heard the news.\n\nSo let's just keep doing our best, and remember, if you see any of those damn carnies around the property, report it to the Castaways on the premise, or if you're feeling feisty, give them a punch in the jaw cosigned from me! Joking, joking. (Sups say this is a bad idea, so... try not to, and overall, just be careful, please?)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Unknown Login Detected\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 11/11/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nSending your attack dogs after us wasn't very friendly of you.\n\nSpeaking of friends, we noticed you're coming up short of finding a new one for Portia and people to take care of her.\n\nWe have plenty waiting for her whenever you're ready.\n\nWe'll give her and the little bundle of joy a home fit for kings.\n\nIt's better than your collared little nonprofit anyway.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Internal Record\nDate: 12/24/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nSometimes I think I'm just a fool.\n\nThings aren't great at the Center right now. Just one problem after the other keeps piling up, and the Supervisors have gone back to their usual selves, honestly.\n\nJack's health got worse again, and since he didn't have a quirk, they weren't keen on helping cover it; they just wanted us to focus on Portia and the baby. I tried to explain again that elephants are communal animals and that losing him would be detrimental to both, but...\n\nThe folks at 84 would have had my back, but they've been quiet lately. Really quiet. The Castaways got pulled away, too. \"More pressing matters.\" I thought their whole thing was helping //us//.\n\nThings were so good with the Sups I  forgot how far down on the fucking totem pole we are.\n\nWe were trying to figure out how to get the money together to help him, and he...\n\nHe's gone. Jenni found him. She, fuck, I found her curled on top of him, just weeping. He had started playing with Portia again, bringing her toys and food gifts. He loved watermelon. I'd just bought a whole batch.\n\nGods. \n\nPortia is already beginning to regress; she won't eat, she won't interact with staff, not even Jenni. I've kept trying to find another companion for her, but any offer I make is undercut within minutes; judging by their email, Herman Fuller's Circus of Dickery is behind it. \n\nWe're keeping a vet with her as often as we can, monitoring the baby. Can't they see they're endangering both of them because of this?! I'm not sure if Portia would survive losing the baby. We need to get her eating again, but Jenni's too cut up right now, and forcing her to eat feels wrong. It's suffering both ways and-\n\nI don't know what we're going to do. The supervisors might end up having to take Portia away, and I know she won't get the level of love there she does here.\n\nI'm not even sure why they are doing this! Dad always said they were odd people but could be worked with at the end of the day. They were creepy but reliable enough actually to take care of things properly when push came to shove.\n\nNot this level of petty bullshit.\n\nGods, I wish he were here. He'd be able to figure it out, set down terms, and not be ignored by everyone and their brother just because they're young or \"naive.\"\n\nWhat a Merry Christmas.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Unknown Login Detected\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 1/1/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHello again, Ms. Wilson,\n\nI will keep this brief; as we enter a new year rife with opportunity, I ask again if you wish to rethink your stance.\n\nWe are sorry for the state of our relationship and hope you wish to make amends as well.\n\nWe hope to hear from you soon.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Unknown Login Detected\nDate: 1/1/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nYou want ME to apologize to you?\n\nAfter everything you've done?

I don't know what is going on with you folks, but orders are more than spotty, and your boys keep vanishing.\n\nI'm not sure if we'll be able to keep our end of the bargain, and I haven't gotten a response from anyone else, so I figured I'd try this.\n\nWe need help. Bad.\n\nMy people are getting hurt, animals tormented, buildings sabotaged, and people have stopped coming.\n\nMy dad's dream is at risk, and I'm not sure if it's because I'm unlucky, too stubborn, or some other personal failing.\n\nPortia is eating again, but I'm worried about her and the calf.\n\nJenni, Portia's caretaker, is in critical condition, and she's only still with us because of Portia.\n\nThe paddock is a wreck; my people have been cleaning up spattered clowns for hours, and I'm worried what happened to Jack will happen to her.\n\nThey want me to hand her over, and I refuse to do that, especially now, but I'm worried I'm gonna sink my dad's dream.\n\nThings haven't always been good between us, the Park and the Supervisors; it's always been, you say, jump, we hop in time, grumbling occasionally, crying more times than I care to admit.\n\nBut she belongs here. We just need the circus to take a boot to the face.\n\nYou've got the biggest boots I know, so please.   \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Margaret Waller\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 1/18/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHello, Ms. Wilson\n\nI am devastated to hear about all that has occurred between our conversations, and I deeply apologize for our relative detachment lately.\n\nAs is often the case, we've had too many irons in the fire, but I can happily say that things have calmed down enough that immediate aid can be sent.\n\nWe at 84 have always held your work in high regard, to think it threatened, especially over an entity we handed into your care. We can't let that stand, now can we? You might consider us distant from your plights, Fae, if I can call you Fae, but I assure you we have more commonalities than you might expect, as many others at the Site would attest after recent events.\n\nBut that is not a pressing matter of conversation. I want to hear everything that has transpired in full, perhaps in person or a more direct line of communication, and I promise I will see that this comes to a satisfactory outcome.\n\nNow, what do you need of me? Did you mention a circus?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Unknown Login Detected\nDate: 2/10/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nFine. You win.\n\nYou win.\n\nPortia can go with you, but I know she won't be happy about it. She's gotten good at squashing clowns, and you know the saying: They never forget.\"\n\nYou can have her on Valentine's Day AFTER we have a memorial for Jack with her.\n\nLet us at least have that.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Unknown Login Detected\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 2/10/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nFantastic!\n\nWe knew you would see sense in the end, and again, we must offer our deepest condolences that things became too ugly between us.\n\nPortia will learn to forget; I assure you, that is the way of the Circus. The joy of the show overtakes all else.\n\nAnd of course, of course! What do you take us for, monsters?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Margaret Waller\nDate: 2/15/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThat went better than I had hoped.\n\nThank you again. Things have already begun to feel better around here. They're a lot less tense, even with your boys hanging around. I think my people are just grateful they can get some rest without needing to keep one eye open. I know I am.\n\nThe vets checked out Portia, and despite everything, the baby is still developing without issue.\n\nWith the additional funds you brought, we'll be back to peak by the end of the month. It wasn't expected, but it was very much appreciated. I'm not used to this sort of amenable back-and-forth with you folks, I'm not going to lie.\n\nPlease let me know when we should expect the next batch of critters. Again, I really appreciated how quickly this all got wrapped up.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Margaret Waller\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 2/15/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHappy to have been of service, Fae.\n\nI only regret we were able to take all of those carnies into custody; my peers are quite excited to see what they can learn from those we did take into custody, however. The circus has been a little too slippery for far too long. They'll be back, but hopefully, they will think better of meddling in your affairs.\n\nOh, some of our Agents were able to track down several of those missing elephants as well, if you are still eager to find Portia a companion. The funds should be more than enough to cover the expansion of her paddock and food costs.\n\nI'm glad this reached the desired conclusion, and I look forward to further collaboration. As I said, being a peer is a much more amenable status quo. You will assuredly be hearing from us again soon, and please don't be afraid to reach out if you need similar aid; many members of 84 are ever ready to assist.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Unknown Login Detected\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 2/15/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThat was rude.\n\nAnd unfair.\n\nAnd all around, it's not very fun at all!\n\nYou tricked us!\n\nWhen all we wanted to do was spread joy! Everyone smiles when the Circus comes to town!\n\nAnd you had your big sister come down and kick in our teeth!\n\nWe will remember this, Fae.\n\nBut... you win. Portia is yours for now.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Unknown Login Detected\nDate: 2/15/23\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nForever* I think.\n\nThis is done and over. My people aren't gonna be bullied by a bunch of fools in bad makeup.\n\nYou come back here, and I'll twist that face of yours right-side up, hand to whatever god you fear.\n\nNow fuck off.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): All Staff\nTopic: Enclosure 84\nDate: 2/10/24\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey folks, it's been almost a year since the Valentine's Day Incident and even more since Jack's sad passing. I just wanted to give an update to those who aren't aware of how everything is going!\n\nThis is especially helpful as another individual has joined their little \"family\" and will likely be taking up a good bit of the staff's time. Many of you already know where I'm going with this, but Jenni and I had to keep it under lock and key for a bit while they acclimate.\n\nMay I introduce you to... Jet!\n\n[[=image jet.png width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]//Portia's Little Boy!//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nHe's already quite a handful, but we think it's safe for him and his mom to be allowed back in now that the new safety precautions have been established and the rest of the herd has been normalized to him. Also, I bet all of you fifty that you're not gonna be able to pry him away from Jenni. I'm pretty sure she loves him more than his own Mama.\n\nJokes aside, many of you were asking why we put crash pads around the enclosure and soft netting around the edges. Well, little Jet has a quirk, like his Mama, but his is a bit more bombastic.\n\nI'll hint at what he can do: \"I'll have seen almost everything when I see an elephant...\"\n\nOh, and a warning: you can expect to see some of the Supervisors coming around more frequently soon to check on Jet and drop off a handful of new friends for us to give a hefty helping of comfortable living. Luckily, it's our pals from 84 primarily, so don't sweat it too much. Regardless, let's continue to make this year a good one. Oh, and if you see any clowns this time around, remember what the local boys showed you. Just be sure to tell the custodial staff about the ensuing mess. \n\nHave a good day!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Classic\n> **Author:** U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Headquarter's photostream\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/usfwshq/6841454516/]\n\n> **Filename:** ELEPHANTS\n> **Author:** JOHN K THORNE\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/seattlecamera/19501233375/]\n\n> **Filename:** Baby-Elephant-Revision-39\n> **Author:** Bruce Detorres\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/brucedetorres/43338597295/]\n\n> **Filename:** Clown disc, Espey and Daly's Hi-Land mini golf, 7011 Chippewa, Saint Louis, Missouri (LOC)\n> **Author:** Libary of Congress\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/51331018984/]\n\n> **Filename:** Clown Harmony\n> **Author:** Alan Levine\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/cogdog/34406077550/] \n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
