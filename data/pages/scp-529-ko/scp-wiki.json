However, it has been friendly and cooperating with the Foundation. As a result, the Foundation signed multiple agreements with it, and the containment procedure was updated. Below are some of the clauses of the agreement.\n# The Foundation does not interfere with the instance's activity as long as SCP-529-KO does not directly harm civilians.\n# SCP-529-KO always shares its location with the Foundation using a Foundation-issued GPS device.\n# The Foundation acknowledges the right for SCP-529-KO to conduct pest removal in ██ sites, including Site-21K, Site-01K, and Site-19K. (Further contents omitted)\n\nMTF Unit Lambda-92(\"Shutter Chance\") is to record the subject's position at all times using the GPS device on its person. When Anomalous Incident 529-KO occurs, Lambda-92 moves to the location and conducts coverage and disinformation activities. Detainment or administration of amnestics to related individuals is permitted when needed.\n\nAt the end of the incident, Lambda-92 collects all the corpses of SCP-529-KO-1 and incinerates them. The owner of the damaged property may be either financially compensated or treated with amnestics.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scpkrsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/payroy529/SCP-529-KO.png\n|caption=SCP-529-KO during an interview.]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-529-KO is a humanoid entity of unknown origin. It is always seen wearing an aluminium suit and helmet. There is very little information related to SCP-529-KO; the only fact known from documents mentioning the entity is that it has been active since at least the 20th century.\n\nSCP-529-KO is capable of teleportation or a similar form of movement. It has been confirmed that SCP-529-KO's range of movement encompasses the entire Earth, but the entity is particularly often sighted in East Asia.\n\nSCP-529-KO typically appears inside inhabited houses, often while the residents are present. SCP-529-KO approaches the residents and attempts to persuade them to leave the house. This usually involves a brief self-introduction or warnings about potential dangers related to the current state of the house.[[footnote]]Here, SCP-529-KO uses an anomalous device to make the residents more agreeable.[[/footnote]] If the residents remain uncooperative despite these efforts, SCP-529-KO forcibly evicts them from the house using physical force.\n\nOnce SCP-529-KO successfully evicts the residents, it takes some time to prepare by inspecting the house's condition or checking its equipment. SCP-529-KO then operates an anomalous machine it had prepared, transforming the house's interior into a different kind of space-time. During this process, the internal space of the house undergoes anomalous changes, such as expansion or increased complexity. Following this, numerous instances of SCP-529-KO-1 appear within the house, an event designated as 'Anomalous Incident 529-KO'.\n\nSCP-529-KO-1 are anomalous creatures genetically similar to arthropods. These entities share common characteristics, such as significant body size or a more pronounced bodily part; some may possess exceptional anomalous properties. These traits greatly enhance their survivability and aid in attacking or killing humans. SCP-529-KO-1 entities typically inhabit small burrow-like extradimensional pockets within human residences, absorbing the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-arad|Elan-Vital Energy(EVE)]]] of the occupants to obtain necessary nutrients. They exhibit predatory behaviour, which is especially evident in their actions of killing or devouring humans.\n\nThe objective of SCP-529-KO is to exterminate all SCP-529-KO-1 entities that appear within the house during Anomalous Incident 529-KO. To achieve this, SCP-529-KO utilises various advanced equipment. [[footnote]]Some of it resembles equipment used for pest extermination.[[/footnote]], producing these tools by placing its hand at its waist. How SCP-529-KO stores or pulls out this equipment remains unknown.\n\nAll intervention attempts during Anomalous Incident 529-KO have failed. This is due to various interference effects, such as personnel entering the house being immediately transported to the opposite side or lost and malfunctioning equipment. Additionally, a cognitohazardous effect envelops the entire house, causing slight perceptual distortions in those who become aware of it. This effect ensures that surrounding residents either remain completely oblivious to the anomalous activities or show no interest in them.\n\nThe incident continues until SCP-529-KO exterminates all SCP-529-KO-1 entities within the house. This process lasts from a minimum of three hours to as long as a week. Immediately after the incident, all anomalous effects in the house gradually dissipate over an extended period until they completely vanish. SCP-529-KO then disappears from the scene[[footnote]]SCP-529-KO leaves the scene unattended.[[/footnote]]. Following a brief hiatus[[footnote]]. All attempts to locate SCP-529-KO during this period have failed.[[/footnote]], SCP-529-KO moves to a new location and repeats the process.\n\nSCP-529-KO was first acknowledged when a resident of a house in [REDACTED], South Chungcheong Province, South Korea, reported, \"Someone is committing terrorist activities in my house\". The resident recorded a Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) of 12.5, which is believed to make him resistant to the cognitohazardous effects manifesting in the house at that time. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#epsilon-6|Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\")]]], operating in South Korea at the time, was the closest unit to the scene and was promptly deployed. After a three-hour standby, Epsilon-6 made contact with SCP-529-KO and was able to capture it. During this time, SCP-529-KO did not resist and remained compliant. The Foundation spread disinformation, presenting the incident as a burglary attempting to steal valuables.\n\nAfter its capture, SCP-529-KO was transported to Site-21K. While temporarily held in a standard containment cell for analysis, SCP-529-KO requested to speak with a Foundation researcher. During the interview, SCP-529-KO inquired about the Foundation's purpose and responded positively to the explanation. It requested not to interfere with its activity and exhibited mild anxiety and compulsive symptoms. Immediately after the interview, SCP-529-KO said it would meet again and disappeared before the interviewer's eyes. SCP-529-KO was next discovered in a residential area in Florida, USA, leading the Foundation to confirm its teleportation abilities. The Foundation sought cooperation from SCP-529-KO to facilitate easier containment and a formal agreement was soon established.\n\n**Transcript SCP-519-KO.12**\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n**Location:** Berlin, Germany\n\n-----\n\n[Start of Log]\n\n//Dr Clara commences communication with SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, can you hear me?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Yep. So, you want to see me working?\n\n**Dr Clara:** That is correct. First, could you find the small drone we gave you?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Wait a minute. (//Sound of going through his belongings//) Phew, found it.\n\n**Dr Clara:** The drone is on now. Could you gently throw the drone?\n\n//SCP-529-KO throws the small drone. A camera built into the drone turns on.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** Great. Visuals are clear.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Brief silence//) Makes me shy, staring into me like that.\n\n**Dr Clara:** When does the anomalous incident start? I mean... your job.\n\n//As soon as Dr Clara finishes her sentence, SCP-529-KO is flung back after being hit with an object.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Right now.\n\n//A 2-metre tall moth is seen in front of SCP-529-KO lying on the floor. The moth observes SCP-529-KO while he also looks at the moth. SCP-529-KO carefully pulls out a red fly swatter from behind his back. Then, the moth charges into SCP-529-KO from the air.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Wait, no fair--\n\n//The moth grabs SCP-529-KO and flutters its wings. SCP-529-KO is raised into the sky. As the moth twists his writs, he drops the fly swatter. SCP-529-KO keeps resisting, waving his arms. The moth tightens its grasp around his arms in response.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh!\n\n//SCP-529-KO's violent resistance makes the moth shake. SCP-529-KO takes the opportunity to free one hand and rip out the moth's antenna. The moth screeches and crashes to the ground. SCP-529-KO kicks off the moth and lands with his hands. The moth is kicked to the wall, hitting it.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Shaking of the fur on his hands//) All this fur. I'm allergic to this thing. How are you gonna repay it? (//brief pause//) Death, of course.\n\n//SCP-529-KO picks up the fly swatter. The moth stares at the SCP-529-KO and moves its gaze towards the ceiling.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Don't get all mushy on me.\n\n//SCP-529-KO slowly approaches the moth. The moth suddenly lets out a loud, metallic screech. SCP-529-KO frantically covers his ears.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh! You bastard, what is this?\n\n//SCP-529-KO runs towards the moth. The moth twists his body, attempting to hit him. SCP-529-KO dodges the attack and hits the moth with the fly swatter. The moth's abdomen bulges up and explodes. SCP-529-KO is covered with blood and viscera. He pulls out a towel and wipes off the gunk on his body.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Now, it's time to bounce.\n\n**Dr Clara:** What?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** That screech is no run-of-the-mill last word. It's--\n\n//From the corner, a row of ants, each 1 metre long, emerges. An ant charges towards SCP-529-KO and bites his forearm. SCP-529-KO shakes it off and kicks it away. Ants also emerge from the ceiling. One of them falls on SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh! It was to call these freaks!\n\n//SCP-529-KO pins the fallen ant's head on the ground and violently stomps on it. Other ants approach and bite SCP-529-KO on the leg. Blood leaks out from his dented suit. SCP-529-KO kicks the ants out and runs to the corner. The floor under SCP-529-KO collapses as he runs. SCP-529-KO manages to catch the floor before falling. Under the floor are hastily positioned stakes protruding upwards.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Clever girls. Fuck.\n\n**Dr Clara:** Are you okay, SCP-529-KO?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** My leg is infected, and my arm feels like jello. I'm thriving! (//Heavy breathing//) But can you not talk to me now? It's quite a task.\n\n//SCP-529-KO crawls out of the ground. Ants rushes towards SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Oh, come here, ladies.\n\n//SCP-529-KO pulls out a blue fire extinguisher. He positions himself and sprays it towards the ants. Instead of foam, blue paste comes out of the hose. The ants that came in contact with the paste spasm and die. Other ants appear cautious of the paste on the ground.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** What is that?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Toothpase. Minty.\n\n//A black, sharp projectile darts from behind SCP-529-KO. SCP-529-KO turns his body and blocks it with the fire extinguisher. Dozens of wasps appear in front of SCP-529-KO. They position themselves to fire their stinger. SCP-529-KO does a front flip, dodging the stingers. While dodging, he produces a spherical device glowing in blue and throws it in the path of the wasp's trajectory.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Oh, you're witnessed alright!\n\n//The device lets out a large warning sound and turns into a huge mosquito net, trapping the wasps. They try to rip out of the net with their stingers but to no avail.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** You wait right there.\n\n//SCP-529-KO turns to the ants. The ants are still hesitant to approach the toothpaste. SCP-529-KO sits down, leaning on the floor and pulls out a pesticide can and lighter. He then ignites the lighter as he sprays the pesticide towards the ant. A large flame engulfs the ants, killing them.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Voilla, crispy roasted ant, well done. Want some?\n\n**Dr Clara:** No thank you.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** It's a joke. It tastes like shit and smells like shit. Just what you'd expect from an ant.\n\n**Dr Clara:** What? So you've tried--\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Let's not talk about it.\n\n//SCP-529-KO sprays the pesticide on the wasps. They all fall lifelessly.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Part A, complete.\n\n//SCP-529-KO moves to another location. Along the way, eggs, presumed to be from cockroaches, are scattered throughout the corridor. Each time SCP-529-KO encounters an egg, he stomps on it and crushes it. As he continues walking, SCP-529-KO spots something and hides behind a wall. Around the corner, there is a cluster of cockroach-sized entities moving together. The cockroaches are scurrying around the room, nibbling on various items.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Over ten thousand. I have just the trick.\n\n//SCP-529-KO pulls out a blue electric fly swatter. As SCP-529-KO try to ambush, a one-metre-long camel cricket jumps at SCP-529-KO and kicks him. SCP-529-KO is flung to the wall.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Coughs//)\n\n//The cricket leaps toward SCP-529-KO. SCP-529-KO tries to stand up. The cricket kicks his head and climbs on SCP-529-KO, pinning him down. It pushes its open jaw toward SCP-529-KO. He blocks the cricket with his arms.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO? Are you okay?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh, yes, I'm fine. (//Brief pause//) ...It's just another day at work.\n\n//The cricket scratches SCP-529-KO with its legs. SCP-529-KO twists his body to create space to kick the cricket's abdomen away from him. SCP-529-KO rolls to the electric fly swatter on the ground.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I'm gonna blow you up.\n\n//SCP-529-KO turns on the electric fly swatter and charges towards the cricket. It quickly recovers and starts hopping in all directions. SCP-529-KO swings the electric fly swatter repeatedly but misses. The cricket changes direction and kicks SCP-529-KO in the back, causing him to stumble forward. The cricket then turns again, this time aiming for SCP-529-KO's abdomen. SCP-529-KO swings the fly swatter and hits the cricket right on the head. An intense spark flashes, and the cricket slams to the floor. Black smoke rises from the creature's body.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Hopping bastard. What are you, a frog?\n\n//The cricket twitches, and dozens of horsehair worms emerge from its abdomen. The worms wriggle and then invert their bodies, transforming into cricket nymphs. SCP-529-KO crushes the nymphs underfoot or zaps them with the electric fly swatter. Each dying nymph releases dozens of horsehair worms. SCP-529-KO promptly crushes all the worms underfoot before they can turn into crickets. After resolving the situation, SCP-529-KO hides behind the wall again and observes the room. The swarm of cockroaches is no longer visible.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** What the hell? Where did they g--\n\n//A roach falls on SCP-529-KO's shoulder. SCP-529-KO slowly looks up at the ceiling, where thousands of roaches are present.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** AAAAAAAAA!\n\n//SCP-529-KO rushes into the room. The swarm of roaches drops down to the floor like rain. They chase after SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** This is too much...\n\n//SCP-529-KO pulls out a device and installs it on the ground. The device activates, and a protective barrier envelops the surrounding area. In a second, the swarm of roaches pile up on the layer. SCP-529-KO prepares for battle. Just as the barrier is about to fail, a crimson ray hits the swarm.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Silence//) Huh?\n\n//The surviving roaches scram. As the protective barrier disappears, SCP-529-KO ducks and looks around. Suddenly, another crimson ray hits SCP-529-KO on his right arm, disintegrating it.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh! What the fuck is that?!\n\n//SCP-529-KO clenches on his right arm.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO! Are you alright?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Nope, quite distressed, actually!\n\n//SCP-529-KO drops to the floor. A two-metre-long mosquito breaks through the wall.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** The door's right there! Have you no manners?\n\n//The mosquito swings around its proboscis, flying towards SCP-529-KO. He jumps away to dodge the attack. SCP-529-KO stands up and throws several drones. The drones revolve around SCP-529-KO, preheating its six-shot firearm. Thousands of roaches swarm from behind him.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** There's more of them! This is why mommy told you not to eat after midnight--\n\n//The mosquito darts toward SCP-529-KO. He turns around, dodging it. The roaches gather to form a giant tire-like shape and roll towards SCP-529-KO. The drone, finishing its preheating, empties its bullets at the roaches. SCP-529-KO presses the button on the fly swatter, which transforms into a giant sword. Sparks can be seen flashing on the blade. SCP-529-KO swings the blade at the mosquito. It parries it with its proboscis.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I've seen enough Bruce Lee movies to know where this is going.\n\n//The mosquito swings its proboscis around, which the SCP-529-KO parries with the sword. SCP-529-KO signals the drone to gather around him. A crimson ball of energy gathers around its proboscis. As the drone shoots at the mosquito, it fires its ray at the drones, destroying all of them. SCP-529-KO dodges the ray, rolling to the side.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** We're fair now. Lost some weight?\n\n//The mosquito darts toward SCP-529-KO, its probiscis high up in the air.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Come over here!\n\n//SCP-529-KO taunts the mosquito, hands behind his back. The mosquito penetrates SCP-529-KO's abdomen. Its proboscis twitches and sucks on SCP-529-KO's blood.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh, bon appetite, motherfucker!\n\n//SCP-529-KO raises his sword high. The mosquito tries to pull out but can't. The blade slashes into the mosquito's head. It raises all its legs, then goes limp. SCP-529-KO pulls out the proboscis from his belly and grabs the wound with his hand. The bleeding stops. Next, SCP-529-KO pulls out a metal prosthetic hand and attaches it.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Laughs//) Pesticide flows through my veins, you idiot! ... Part B, over.\n\n//SCP-529-KO glances at the device on his wrist.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Remaining organisms... 42,312... Mostly roaches. Gonna be a cakewalk from here.\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, I've been wondering: Part A, Part B... What are those \"parts\"?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Brief silence//) Don't ask. It just... sounds cool.\n\n[End of Log]\n\nNote: The incident ended three hours after the transcription. SCP-529-KO suffered the amputation of the right arm, loss of a left eye, concussion and abdominal damage. SCP-529-KO disappeared right after the incident was over. The GPS device did not show any location until SCP-529-KO emerged again six months later. On his subsequent discovery, all his wounds from the previous incident were completely healed.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Transcript SCP-529-KO.13**\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n**Location:** Shanghai, China\n----\n[Start of Log]\n\n//Dr Clara commences communication with SCP-529-KO. The camera on the drone turns on.//\n\n**SCP-519-KO:** Get out. Out, out.\n\n//SCP-529-KO lets the civilians out of the building.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Ah, it's been a while, doctor. \n\n**Dr Clara:** What happened? We've lost track of you for six months.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Nothing much, just on vacation.\n\n**Dr Clara:** You were on vacation for six months?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Yep. There was no work to do. I got a blast out of it. Went shopping, went to the beach. (//Straightens his back//)\n\n**Dr Clara:** No work... Weren't you making SCP-529-KO-1?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** What? Hey, doc, what did you think of me? (//Angrily//) Find bugs and wipe them all off; that's my job! (//Brief pause//) Did you think I was some- some- cult leader or something?\n\n**Dr Clara:** (//Brief pause//) No, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Nah, don't get all timid like that. Just wanted you to know. Well, let's start working.\n\n//SCP-529-KO searches the area. As there are no yields, SCP-529-KO starts swearing.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Well, I'll be damned. It says it's right here.\n\n//SCP-529-KO walks, looking at the device on his wrist.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Just one... Oh, wait.\n\n//SCP-529-KO frantically starts running.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO? What is it?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** It couldn't be, it couldn't! Fuck, It shouldn't be, no. (//Brief silence//) Wait!\n\n//SCP-529-KO starts searching for SCP-529-KO-1 in the rooms. However, SCP-529-KO-1 is nowhere to be seen.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Cough//) It's just like before. One... Fuck, why is there only one!\n\n//SCP-529-KO breaths heavily. He runs across the corridor and stops in front of a metal door. SCP-529-KO carefully grabs the door handle. A staircase leading to the basement can be seen as he opens the door. Cobwebs cover the space between the stairs. SCP-529-KO descends cautiously.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** These are all spider webs?\n\n//More cobwebs could be seen as he descends. SCP-529-KO pulls out a small sword and cuts through the web, blocking the path. Huge, black legs can be seen crawling up from below. They snatch SCP-529-KO and throw webs at him.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Agh!\n\n//The legs pull him down below.//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO!\n\n//The drone turns on its light, descends, and searches the area.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Mommy?\n\n//SCP-529-KO is dangling upside down, tied in webs. In front of him is a giant spider spinning a web. It ties SCP-529-KO again with the web using its legs.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Oh, you're tight. Care to loosen up a bit?\n\n//Suddenly, the web wrapped around SCP-529-KO rips open. He manoeuvres his body to make a safe landing. SCP-529-KO stares at the spider, wiggling his finger. The spider charges toward SCP-529-KO with its front legs lifted. SCP-529-KO pulls out a pesticide and sprays at it.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Bang! Adios.\n\n//The spider, sprayed with pesticide, falls. SCP-529-KO observes the area, cutting through the web. At that moment, the spider opens its eyes and hits SCP-529-KO with its leg. SCP-529-KO is flung towards a pile of rusty metal. Soon, the pile collapses over SCP-259-KO, covering him. He digs out from the pile with his hand and looks at the spider crawling.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Coughs//) Not fair...\n\n//The spider rushes toward SCP-529-KO and tries to slam him with its front legs. SCP-529-KO dodges all the attacks by rolling and fleeing. SCP-529-KO stands up, grabs the wall, and shakes his body with his fist clenched.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Alright, bring it on!\n\n//The spider's abdomen twitches, and a colossal centipede crawls out from its rear. The centipede cahrges towards SCP-529-KO. He pulls out a roll of newspaper and hits dead centre in the centipede's head, flying it afar.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** That's a home run!\n\n//SCP-529-KO throws away the paper roll and pulls out his sword. Then, he leaps towards the centipede's head and slices it in twine. SCP-529-KO lands on the floor. The centipede's body twitches, and a new head sprouts from it.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Hah. (//Chuckles//)\n\n//The centipede opens its mouth and spits out a green orb. SCP-529-KO dodges it. The floor where the orb hit starts melting down. SCP-529-KO throws the sword. It starts spinning fast, creating a spark, and cuts all four legs on the spider's right. As the spider loses balance, the centipede stops spitting orbs. SCP-529-KO pulls out a pistol-shaped weapon and aims it at the centipede's head.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Taste my squirt gun!\n\n//SCP-529-KO pulls the trigger. A mysterious liquid is ejected from the barrel and hits the centipede. Its shell starts dissolving from the liquid. While the centipede is trying to recover, the spider crawls towards SCP-529-KO. SCP-529-KO keeps shooting the gun and walking back. The stream from the gun grows weaker.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** What is this? Is it not working?\n\n//SCP-529-KO shakes the gun and throws it at the centipede. The centipede elongates its body and rushes towards SCP-529-KO. He dodges by ducking forward. Then, he grabs the centipede's head and rides on it. The centipede twists its body, trying to shake him off. SCP-529-KO stands up and slides down the centipede's body. He then steps on the spider's head, leaping up high, and lands near where the sword is stuck.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Wow, that was cool.\n\n//SCP-529-KO grabs the sword and assumes the battle position. The centipede starts spitting the green orbs again. SCP-529-KO runs towards the spider, dodging the orbs left and right. The spider lifts its abdomen and throws webs at him. SCP-529-KO cuts through the webs while running. As the centipede charges towards SCP-529-KO, he uses its head as a pedestal to leap upwards. Then, he throws the sword at the spider. The centipede throws its body to take the sword instead of the spider. SCP-529-KO hits the pommel with his fists as the sword stabs into the centipede. The sword penetrates deeper, finally slicing into the spider's head. A huge spark flashes from the sword as SCP-529-KO grabs it. Both the spider and the centipede twist its body left and right. Finally, as both the creatures stop moving, SCP-529-KO strikes the sword again and pulls it out.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** The end!\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, are you feeling okay?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Good as ever. Seems like it's done for today. Let's see... (//Looks at wrist//) Uhh... (//Silence//)\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** ...Fuck, it can't be. Why. (//Deep breath//) One, ten hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, one millio-\n\n//Millions of flying insects swarm in front of SCP-529-KO. It soon clumps together to form a humanoid form(SCP-529-KO-A). SCP-529-KO falls backwards while backing up from SCP-529-KO-A.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** No, no, no. Why the fuck are you here. No, no, NO!\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** (//Silence//) You.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Deep Breath//) A- AAAAAAAGH!\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** Yes, you. (//Lifts up arm//) You. Were. Alloy Ranger. Aluminium Man.\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO? What in the world--\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** You, you killed everyone! So... (//Brief pause//) So, you're dead. You were fucking dead!\n\n//SCP-529-KO-A slowly walks toward SCP-529-KO. SCP-529-KO calms his breathing and grabs his sword. He then assumes the battle position, charges toward SCP-529-KO, and slices it in two. SCP-529-KO-A's body is bisected but soon recovers.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** You... Were. There. Aluminium Man.\n\n//SCP-529-KO keeps slicing at SCP-529-KO-A. It does not resist. A huge spark flashes from the sword, burning thousands of the flying insects. SCP-529-KO-A lifts its arm towards SCP-529-KO, and he ducks. Thousands of bugs fly out from SCP-529-KO's arm, forming a giant hand, clenching on SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Cough//) Fuck, you piece of shit!\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** Too. Loud.\n\n//SCP-529-KO-A lifts SCP-529-KO and slams him onto the ground. He lets out a short, painful moan. Then, SCP-529-KO-A throws him into the wall. Clutter from the shelf falls as he hits the wall.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Silence//) \n\n//SCP-529-KO-A glances at SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** Aluminum Man.\n\n//Flying bugs swarm around SCP-529-KO-A. As it reaches toward the window, thousands of bugs hit the window, breaking from the impact. SCP-529-KO climbs up the wall and exits through the window. Soon after, SCP-529-KO wakes up. Then, he sits down, leaning on the wall.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Brief pause//) We're all gonna die.\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO...?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** We're all gonna die! (//Long, slow laughter//) We're all gonna die... Shit, we're screwed.\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO. \n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Fuck.\n\n**Dr Clara:** We need to talk.\n\n[End of Log]\n\n**Note:** MTF Unit Nu-15 is currently searching for SCP-529-KO-A's whereabouts. An interview with SCP-529-KO is booked for ██/█/20██.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Interview Log SCP-529-KO.4**\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Interviewer:** Dr Clara\n\n**Interviewee:** SCP-529-KO\n\n**Foreword:** After the events of Transcript SCP-529-KO.13, Dr Clara reported to higher command and booked an interview with SCP-529-KO.\n\n[Start of Log]\n\n**Dr Clara:** You're here, SCP-529-KO. You look worse for wear.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I couldn't sleep after that day.\n\n**Dr Clara:** I see. (//Brief Silence//) I'll cut to the chase. Can you see this? (//It's a photo of SCP-529-KO-A taken during Transcription SCP-529-KO.13.//) SCP-529-KO-A... What is this? This looks different from other SCP-529-KO-1 organisms. On top of that, it escaped the scene.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Silence//) I'll explain everything. (//Hands start shaking//) Before that, I have something to tell you.\n\n**Dr Clara:** What is it?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** My past, sort of speak. It's relevant to the context, so better tell it now. Before, I was just an ordinary guy, full of ambition. Being an actor or celebrity could make me famous more quickly, but I craved something more unique. While I was struggling for that special something, my old friend called me. He hasn't contacted me in ages. At first, I thought he was going to borrow money from me, so--\n\n**Dr Clara:** Let's stick to the topic.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Sorry, I'm out of my mind. That friend who hadn't called me in a while was different from before. His voice sounded the same, as did his way of speaking. But I noticed something: that he achieved something extraordinary.\n\n**Dr Clara:** What did he tell you?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** That... (//Chuckles, nervously//) Oh, the audacity to tell me that. He said he's saving the world but is in a pickle now. He needed my help... You call me in ages, and you tell me that crap? (//Laughter//)\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, you mean...\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Yep, just how you think it went. He gave me a deal, and I accepted it just because I wanted to be famous. Damn. Did you see Interstellar? S-T-A-Y! (//Laughter//) Ha, fuck, no shit. I shouldn't have done that.\n\n**Dr Clara:** Calm down.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Brief silence//) I made an appointment and met him. He had some kind of log on his head. (//Laughs//) He gave me the suit and said: \"Welcome, I missed you so much\".\n\n**Dr Clara:** Good. So, SCP-529-KO-A, when did this thing(//Showing picture//) first emerge?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I adapted to my new life very quickly. That was just another day fighting the bugs. It was a straightforward job: there were only weaklings. After exterminating the bugs, we were going to come back. Then, it appeared. Millions of vermin were swarming up to form a human. Do you know what I did? I ignored my friends and jumped at it. I thought I grew stronger growing the bugs. I was so full of myself. It poked a hole right through my stomach. Just as I was about to faint and die, right as it was gonna deliver its final blow... (//Brief silence//) My friend got hit instead of me.\n\n**Dr Clara:** So... What happened?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** His left arm fell off, and he collapsed. My friends rushed towards it to protect us. I- I had nothing I could do but hold my dying friend and cry, asking if he was okay. It killed every one of my comrades. Blood and guts everywhere, arms crushed, heads split... (//Brief pause//)\n\n**Dr Clara:** (//Brief pause//) From what you have told, SCP-529-KO, it's a miracle you've survived. How did you?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** It wasn't in its best shape when the fight ended. It lost too many bugs. As soon as the humanoid form was broken, the bugs just scattered. It was done. I, who should have died, survived. My friends died instead. What a comedy. (//Heavy breathing//) I... Do you have any Idea what passed through my head? Thank goodness I'm alive. (//In a raised voice//) It's all because of me! Fuck, they all died because of me! The mere thought of it makes me gag and tear up... Fuck.\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, I know how you feel. But please, stay calm.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//In a shaky voice//) Let me ask you something. (//Brief silence//) Where is it? (//Shaking the picture//) Where is this thing?!\n\n**Dr Clara:** We're currently tracking SCP-529-KO. It'll be found soon.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Good. No, not good. It's not good at all. People are dying because of it. I'm sure it, that fucking monstrosity, feeds on humans to grow. (//Long pause//) It's... It's all because of me...\n\n//Silence//\n\n**Dr Clara:** SCP-529-KO, this is an off-topic question. Why do you keep doing such a dangerous task?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** (//Brief pause//) Why do I do it? After all my friends died, I swore I'd give up everything to kill these bugs, not giving a single damn about anything else. It's been decades, and soon it'll be centuries. (//Brief pause//) Doctor, do you know why I kill only bugs? I'm a useless piece of shit bastard, son of a bitch, but someone has to do this. Only I can save the world. This isn't for some petty redemption. Any reason I can think of is nothing more than hypocrisy. (//Silence//) Doc... You know I blurt out useless nonsense and bullshit when I dogfight those bugs. Do you know why?\n\n**Dr Clara:** (//Frustrated//) What?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I'm scared. I'm scared I must do something everyone did alone as a team. Those gibberish jokes that say are a method to run away from fear. This is just a hero's play. A hero never dies. No matter how strong the enemy is, he wins. (//Brief silence//) A hero who acknowledges death is a fool. When I eat, sleep, kill those things... My hands shake. I'm afraid. I'm so fucking afraid. I'm afraid of dying. I wish I'd rather go insane and forget everything. Fuck, but... (//Breathing, shaking//) I, I shouldn't die. If I'm gone... If I die... I can't see my friends in the eye. (//Sobbing//)\n\n[End of log]\n\n**Note:** SCP-529-KO disappeared right after the interview ended.

I'm just the Aluminium Man. Alloy Ranger, Aluminium Man.\n\n//SCP-529-KO pulls out the electric fly swatter and dozens of drones. As SCP-529-KO activates the drones, they start glowing in the middle, and blades protruding from the drones start to rotate.//\n\n**N15-1:** What are you going to do, SCP-529-KO?\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** I've thought this through. Should I run, or should I fight? I did some rock-paper-scissors to decide. You asked me what I'm going to do. It's obvious: burn that bastard. \n\n**N15-1:** What are you--\n\n//SCP-529-KO jumps off the helicopter. His back starts flashing blue, and a pair of fabric wings emerge. SCP-529-KO uses the wings to glide towards SCP-529-KO-A at high velocity. The drones follow him. N15-1 throws a small drone to track SCP-529-KO.//\n\n**N15-2:** (//Silence//) So, you'll stand here and look?\n\n**N15-1:** Let's observe the situation first.\n\n//SCP-529-KO-A starts twitching after seeing SCP-529-KO. It extends its hand to snatch him. SCP-529-KO turns around, evading the hand. SCP-529-KO ascends above SCP-529-KO-A's head.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** You are here! I knew you were alive, Aluminium Man! Entertain me with your tricks! Now!\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** AAAGH! I need antibiotics! I cannot hold! (//Laughter//) Joking. \n\n//SCP-529-KO rips apart his wings and falls towards SCP-529-KO-A. Thousands of bugs swarm at SCP-529-KO. When SCP-529-KO signals at the drones, they rotate their blades, keeping the bugs away. A drone penetrates through the front of SCP-529-KO-A, making some space.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** This is for my teammates!\n\n//SCP-529-KO turns on his electric fly swatter and swings it. A giant spark flashes, burning numerous bugs. SCP-529-KO-A flinches, frustrated.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** This is for my friends!\n\n//SCP-529-KO-A swells up, trapping SCP-529-KO. Shortly after, another giant spark flashes inside it. SCP-529-KO escapes from SCP-529-KO-A. The creature suffers massive damage in the process.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** And this is for me!\n\n//The fly swatter's net grows as SCP-529-KO presses a button. He swings the swatter as hard as he can. Then, a spark bigger than anyone before flashes, engulfing SCP-529-KO-A. Its form collapses, and SCP-529-KO plummets to the ground.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Finally... It's done...\n\n//As SCP-529-KO stands up, SCP-529-KO appears, piercing his stomach. SCP-529-KO slowly turns his head towards SCP-529-KO-A. Its size became much smaller.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** You... You motherfucker...\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** Surprised. But. End. Die.\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Who says I'm dying, you bastard!\n\n//SCP-529-KO raises his hand, and drones charge at SCP-529-KO-A from the sky. Suddenly, hundreds of bugs emerge from the ground, attacking the drones. All of the drones explode. SCP-529-KO drops to the ground, kneeling.//\n\n**SCP-529-KO-A:** Fool. You. That tree.

Shoot it!\n\n//A huge, red drone spirals in front of the helicopter at a low altitude. N15-1 aims at the drone and fires at it. As it breaks, dozens of decoys shaped like SCP-529-KO drop around the area. All of them start to glow blue, and then alarms start blasting. As it reaches the ground, they start exploding, causing a fire. Hellish flames surround SCP-529-KO and SCP-529-KO-A.//\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-529-ko/SCP-529-KO3.jpg\n|caption=SCP-529-KO.]]\n\n\n**SCP-529-KO:** Electric fly swatter, mosquito-catching drones...
