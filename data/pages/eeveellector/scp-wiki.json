Whether you‚Äôre here through [https://twitter.com/Eeveellector Twitter], Instagram, [https://bsky.app/profile/eeveellector.bsky.social Bluesky], Discord, Whatsapp, Youtube, [https://www.discogs.com/user/Eeveellector Discogs] or seeing me flash the link on National TV during NDP 2023, I hope that you‚Äôll enjoy your stay here.\n\nNow, a bit about myself: I am a 19 y/o author from Singapore who is currently studying as a (not very good) Motion Graphics and Design student. I like to eat, listen to music, collect records (and slowly CDs too) and watch VTubers (mainly Hololive and Kiichan).\n\nI was first exposed to the SCP Wiki through Confinement when a classmate of mine showed it to me, but I didn‚Äôt actually know it was related to SCP until much later. During 2020, I was in the process of plotting out a Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure fanfiction, and based one of the villains on another classmate, with his Stand being that he could summon fictional characters and items. When I asked him about it, he mentioned he wanted to summon SCPs, so I was like: ‚ÄúDamn what are those‚Äù, searched it on Youtube, watched a couple of The Rubber‚Äôs videos (yeah I know not the best place to start) and was hooked.\n\nI‚Äôve enjoyed writing for as long as I can remember, with me writing SCP articles (on Google Docs) around the end of 2020 to 2021, before taking it a little more seriously and writing for the Wiki since 2022. While it is not super obvious given I only have a few published articles here and one collab, I tend to write/conceptualise more dialogue driven/character focused pieces which are more slice-of-life/grounded. Also my naming conventions for articles are usually related to music (with the exception of collabs), which was inspired by how Stands are named in Jojo lmao\n\nSo, with this smooth segway, here are my:\n\n[[size x-large]]**SCP Articles:**[[/size]]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-733-j SCP-733-J]: System Of A Down\n**Musical Reference:** The band of the same name.\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Show Author Commentary\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nAh yes my first article, and it‚Äôs a joke tale about the Wikidot servers going down. A shitpost cobbled together during class after seeing a tweet by Dr. Asteria and housed on Google Docs because I couldn‚Äôt access the sandboxes, I was not expecting this to have succeeded and blow up the way that it did, with it now just a little bit over 20 upvotes away from reaching +100 (so please go upvote thank you i love you <3).\n\nFunnily enough, at that point I was still a bit upset that I did not get into the specialisation I wanted[[footnote]]My school offers a shared curriculum for the entire cohort for the first semester, then we indicate which specialised area we want to go to at the end of it and see what happens. Some are way more popular than others and I wanted to get into the popular one, but I got rejected and ended up somewhere else.[[/footnote]], but the things I learnt during that specialisation actually helped me create this article. Yeah I mean if you look at it it isnt a full on SCPMAD created with an insane and intricate amount of knowledge of After Effects, but it definitely helped me learn about the basic transformative tools available in it and also how to separate and transfer Adobe Illustrator layers into AE.\n\nOverall, I did have mixed feelings about this one, but as time went on, I found myself to slowly grow proud of this article. I think it also helped that I managed to turn something in my life that was negative (at that time) and channel that into one of my most successful articles here.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6485 SCP-6485]: Want A Coffee For Your Head?\n**Musical Reference:** death bed (coffee for your head) by Powfu ft. beabadoobee\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Show Author Commentary\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nThis is my second article, but it was supposed to be my first article on the site until I posted 733-J. I first came up with this idea as part of a r/fanstands contest entry in 2021 iirc (under the category of posthumous stands), but when I decided to actually try and write something for the Wiki, I chose to write a story based on that. Since it has been 2 years since its initial conceptualisation, I can‚Äôt really remember too much on how I came up with the idea\n\nThis took way, way too long to write, I remember starting near the end of 5k and only published it a few days after 7kon wrapped up, which meant it took more than a year to fully finish. It‚Äôs definitely one of the most difficult articles to write since I‚Äôm not the strongest writer, and I really tried my hardest to make it as emotional and vulnerable as I could with a topic as sensitive as grief, going through many, many iterations until I settled on the final product you see today.\n\nOverall, I am extremely proud of this article as I‚Äôve put in the most effort into writing it and I feel like through it, I‚Äôve grown as a writer and storyteller. When I finally posted this, it felt like such an achievement to have completed something this ambitious. If you could only read one article from me, please check this one out.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7426 SCP-7426]: Defying Gravity\n**Musical Reference:** Defying Gravity by Stephen Schwartz\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Show Author Commentary\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nThis was originally SCP-7330: Komm Susser Todd (which is now another space apollyon anomaly what are the chances), but it was deleted.\n\nI think that with the original being deleted, the //very welcoming// reception SCP-733-J-J received during Coldpostcon 2023 and me not being able to come up with ideas on how to rewrite the article, it kind of took me out of writing for the Wiki for a bit. I think at that point, I also had other drafts I was trying and failing to cook, so I was at a bit of a loss on how I could proceed on from 6485.\n\nThankfully, I managed to whack something together and submitted it for WriterBotFestFestivalCelebrationCon2023, and the incredibly positive feedback and reaction from both Darnell and Tanhony gave me the confidence to finally post this rewrite, and I‚Äôm surprised to see how well it has taken off (on the first day of posting).\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-050-int SCP-050-INT]: Keep Calm and Babble On, cowritten with [[*user Guaire]], [[*user J T K C]], [[*user Crow-Cat]] and [[*user Sobek109]] (and Orchid in spirit).\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-050-int EN Port] available here\n**Musical Reference:** NIL\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Show Author Commentary\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nThis is a collab done with my friends for the International Wiki‚Äôs IntCon 2023. Tbf I wasn‚Äôt planning to participate in it originally, but I gave it a thought and was like ‚Äúfuck it i have time lets ball‚Äù and joined the DSCP team. It was genuinely such a fun article to write, and even though it was an absolute slog to get through especially since I‚Äôd be vcing anywhere from 11pm-1am in my timezone for discussions I still had a really good time writing it.\n\nI‚Äôd like to also take the time to thank my wonderful teammates for putting up with my ideas[[footnote]]Department of Virtual Youtubers[[/footnote]] and suggestions. It was really such a fun time working on this article with yall looking back, and I hope we‚Äôll get the chance to collaborate again!\n\nP.S. if there are any int mods or crom au admins reading this for some reason the metadata aint working and the other coauthors arent credited so if yall could help figure out whats wrong itll be great thanks xoxo\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[size x-large]]**Tales:**[[/size]]\n\nNIL\n\n[[size x-large]]**Miscellaneous:**[[/size]]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/eeveellector Eeveellector's Author Page]\n**Musical Reference:** Scaring The Hoes by Danny Brown and JPEGMAFIA\nAuthor Commentary coming soon \n\n----\n\nNow, I would not have come this far (2 metres) without the helpfulness and patience of my friends over in the Discovering SCP Discord, so I would also like to shout them out here:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ananomalouswriter-s-wallpaper-place-and-more An][https://www.youtube.com/@ananomalouswriter AnomalousWriter]** - \"how memey/serious do you want it to be?\"\n----\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-122 SCP-122: no more monst…òrs.]** - This one scared the shit out of me\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6424 SCP-6424: The Interstellar Prophet and the False Planet]** - Really good cosmic horror article\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6658 SCP-6658: Because The Stars Are Out]** - Really underrated and well-written article\n\nAlso would like to shoutout his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhaBZTxNpJs&ab_channel=AnAnomalousWriter ProtoFixer SCPMAD], this one's real fucking good and I think it's his best work yet (totally not because he included SCP-733-J yeah totally not because of that).
