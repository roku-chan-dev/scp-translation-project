They are H-03 \"Sigrun (left) & H-02 \"Herja\" (right). \n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n[[=image https://i.ibb.co/8r3C7zc/Valkyries-1.jpg width=\"350em\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI had a lot of fun making this piece due to it being EONS since I last did any sort of character design and I've never drawn anything with mechanical components. It was an interesting challenge and wonderful opportunity to work with the author of SCP-6952 to create a visualization that really displays who Sigrun & Herja are. I drew them in grayscale for two reasons: I had no idea how to color their cybernetic arms & I thought that it would make the design of Sigrun & Herja pop. \n\nPlease let me know either in the discussion or PM if you'd like to see more character designs or if you have an article that you may want me to design a human or humanoid for. I also make a variety of art, but once I get a good base of humanoid designs, I'll go ahead and begin to consider drawing further out of my comfort zone (which this piece already was). Thanks for checking out my art!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false| last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/ | previous-title=None\n| next-url=/art:the-pale-lady| next-title=art: The Pale Lady\n| hub-url=/art:sigrun-herja | hub-title= art: Sigrun & Herja\n]]",
