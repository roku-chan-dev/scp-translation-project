Wild caught; each serving is another beast out of the seas!\n# **Olney Corporate Crostini** -- Roasted pork belly braised in a blood orange sauce and garnished with pickled red onions, served on crostini. Locally sourced from the stress-free demon swine that eternally torment the executives of Olney Ironworks at their corporate headquarters.\n# **Margherita à la Lindholm** -- Sicilian pizza made with buffalo mozarella and a creamy tomato sauce, topped with out-of-this-world fresh tomatoes and basil, bred by reclusive parabotanist Stella Lindholm.

[[/footnote]]:** Eggplant parmigiana stuffed with chicken parmigiana, forever: it's stuffed all the way down.\n# **Primavera of the Old Gods:** The vegetables in this dish, grown long before the advent of language, have no name.

Gluten-free.\n# **Black and White Macarons** -- A decadent assortment of dual-flavored macarons, representing a variety of chocolates and vanillas from across time and space. Savor each bite; who knows when the shifting tides of the here and now will force us to change the recipe?\n# **Golden Apple Crumble** -- There's nothing supernatural about these golden apples, but double-blind tests suggest even the gods can't tell the difference.

It's not particularly surprising; this far behind the veil, it's hard to surprise potential consumers. Harder still to surprise a representative of Marshall Carter & Dark, though I'm pleased to say I was pleasantly surprised with the novelty displayed within.\n> \n> In accordance to my strict deiphage diet, the dishes that I ordered were the Scarlet Calamari, the Manhattan Shoggoth Chowder, the Primavera of the Old Gods, the {{cheese}}cake, and the Golden Orange Cider. I'm pleased to report that not only was each course beautifully prepared, but that the establishment avoided falling to the shortcomings of a great many older deiphagy establishments.\n> \n> I found the general gallery to be interesting enough, being a good mix of artistic medium and style. Of the selection, most would fit right at home in the den of a savvy collector. My only complaint was that, compared to the Violet Gallery, the main floor felt somewhat thematically haphazard.\n> \n> My biggest complaint largely regards the opening night music show. While I suppose a representative of Marshall Carter & Dark would be the last woman one expects to cry for artistic integrity, inviting an anticapitalist art collective to such a naked display of conspicuous consumption was predictably disastrous, no matter how much one hid it underneath a veneer of \"performance art\". House of Spades and It's Free Jazz! in particular (groups which I've made my distaste for //quite// clear) worked rather hard to subvert the establishment ambiance.\n> \n> If not for Luna Zapata's hauntingly beautiful violin, I'd have written off the experience and told you, the reader, not to go. I suppose, however, that some art is just not for me.\n> \n> As an aside: the building appears to be haunted, which is always a plus. Coming off of Mrs. Zapata's marvelous rendition of the Devil's Trill, I witnessed a weeping woman disappearing into a wall.[[/span]]\n> \n> [[span style=\"color: #CC3168; font-family: 'Ruluko'; font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;\"]]//~Abigail del Toro//[[/span]]\n\n> ★★★★★\n> \n> [[span style=\"color: #2116e5; font-family: 'Ruluko'; font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;\"]]CERTAINLY THE ART WORLD OF EARTH IS PECULIAR THOUGH FROM TESTIMONY THROUGH FELLOW ILLUMINATED AMBASSADORS I HAD ASSUMED IT HOSTILE AND UNINHABITABLE\n> \n> HAVING NO NEED FOR THE PRIMITIVE SUSTENANCE I DID NOT PARTAKE\n> \n> THE MUSIC FELT PLEASANTLY GRIM AND THE VARIOUS INSTALLATIONS WERE DELIGHTFUL DIVERSIONS\n> \n> ESPECIALLY THE INTERMITTENT FIDDLE[[/span]]\n> \n> [[span style=\"color: #CC3168; font-family: 'Ruluko'; font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;\"]]//~ THE [[[SCP-3472|CHROMATIC VIZIER]]]//[[/span]]\n> \n>> [[span style=\"color: #2116e5; font-family: 'Ruluko'; font-size: 1.15em; font-weight: bold;\"]]**Restaurant Response:** Thank you for your patronage!

To get into the art scene, not as an artist but as a man who goes to art galleries. I want to have fun, you know? Not be bombarded with performative woke nonsense, spearheaded by some hack who thinks she's clever.\n> \n> I counted about two times where a woman with a violin would approach me, glare sternly in my direction, and play a(n admittedly rather nice) solo before storming off. Afterwords, I would be accosted by a series of (admittedly rather convincing) actors playing the role of... I don't know, ghosts of Christmas? All \"please don't turn off my heat\" this and \"give me two more weeks\" that, some naked attempt to tug at heartstrings.
