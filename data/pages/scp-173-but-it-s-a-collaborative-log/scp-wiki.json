When people must enter the room where Thing 173 is kept, at least 3 must enter and the door must be locked behind them. Two people must keep looking at Thing 173 until all people have left the room and locked the door. People who work on Thing 173 should tell each other when they are going to blink. \n\nThe room must be cleaned two times a week.\n\n**What It Is:** Thing 173 was moved to Place 19 in 1993. We don't know where it came from. It is made from human-made rock and strong sticks not made of wood and a little paint. Thing 173 can move and likes to hurt people. It stops moving while people look at it. Thing 173 hurts people by breaking their neck or holding their neck very hard until they die.\n\nPeople say they hear rock rubbing noises from the room where Thing 173 is kept when no one is inside. This is normal, and if it changes someone should tell the top person for keeping Thing 173.\n\nThe red brown stuff on the floor is shit and blood.

If and when it is necessary for SCP Foundation staff to enter SCP-173's designated containment space, no fewer than 3 individuals may enter at any time, with a seal maintained at the entry point during their presence and stay in the room. On all due occasions, a pair of souls are advised to sustain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all such personnel have vacated and resealed the premises.\n\n**Description of Item:** Transferred to SCP Foundation Research and Containment Site-19 during the year of 1993. The curiosity's point of creation is as of yet uncertain. The anomaly in question is constructed utilizing a mixture of sediment and dihydrogen monoxide [[footnote]] Colloquially referred to as 'concrete'. [[/footnote]] and rebar struts, with the addition of gaseously-applied art products produced and sold by the corporation \"Krylon\". SCP-173 is capable of locomotion and may become extremely unpleasant towards the act of biological function. The object in question is incapable of movement if within the direct visual range of any living organism with functional retinas. Retinal observance must not be hindered at any time regarding SCP-173. Persons required to cross the threshold of the containment space are instructed to alert one another before briefly rehydrating one's eyeballs. The object has been suggested to hinder life functions by separating the cervix at the base of the cranium, or by cessation of respiration ability. In the event of hostility, personnel are to observe Class IV hazardous object restriction protocols.\n\nPersonnel allegedly claim that sounds of scraping stone emanate from within the container while no individual is present within.

But the one I want to talk about today is the most fucked up.\n\nI lived in Boring, Oregon. There's a big forest just beside my house. I also had a window in my bedroom to look at it. I have been to this forest multiple times when I was young, there is not a bunch of animals there. Even less dangerous ones.\n\nSometime in 1994, I was hiking with my friends when we noticed something strange. On the ground, we noticed an unusual amount of reddish-brown //goo//. Well, I'm still not sure what it was, but it smelled like shit. So it was probably just a bunch of weird-looking shit.\n\nA rumour of a killer wandering in the forest had been going around town. Most of us didn't believe it at first. I didn't for sure.\n\nThat was until my dog, Juno, was found dead. His head has been entirely twisted, his bones sticking out of his throat. None of us heard a sound when it happened, and my dog usually barks on site when something approaches the house. I only heard a weird sound, kind of like scraping stone, but I didn't think much of it 'cause I was trying to sleep. Want to know the strangest part? I saw that same reddish-brown shit around the corpse of Juno.\n\nThe night after that, I couldn't sleep at all. Juno was a good dog, and everything that happened kept going back and forth in my mind.\n\nAnd then, I heard it. That same exact sound of scraping stone I had heard during the night of Juno's murder. I got out of my bed and ran up to the window.\n\nIt was there.\n\nA humanoid creature that looked like it was made out of concrete and rebar. Its... face? was covered in spray paint, forming some kind of pattern. It didn't move at all, like a regular sculpture. But I somehow knew it was alive.\n\nI looked at it, deeply. It did not make a sound. Not in the slightest. I looked on until my eyes hurt. Then I blinked. Just once. And it was gone. Gone back into the forest. Never saw it again.\n\nWe left Boring not so long after all of that. My dad got a promotion at the robotics company he worked at.\n\nIt's been 10 years since we moved, but I can't get the image of that creature out of my head. Its lifeless form clear as day in front of me through the window, and in a single blink, it was just... gone.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##purple|**ffffffffffffffff**## ##white|03/21/12 (Wed) 23:55:49 #38492763##\n[[span style=\"color:white\"]]\n------\nYou spelled sight as site.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**BananaWar**## ##white|03/21/12 (Wed) 23:55:49 #38492763##\n[[span style=\"color:white\"]]\n------\nDude, that's actually kinda scary.\n\nMaybe the feces around your house is someone that got very scared because of your stories?\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply3\"]]\n##blue|**Punchey**## ##white|03/24/12 (Sat) 05:24:35 #57492759##\n[[span style=\"color:white\"]]\n------\n##red|**BananaWar**##, I'm going to ask you to give some respect here. ##green|**Moto24**## is a new user and your comment is inappropriate\nThis is a warning, next time something similar happens, it's a ban.\n\n**This is a closed post, do not respond to this if you are not staff.**\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but it's a Critter Profile □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but it's a Critter Profile ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n----\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\nCritter Profile: Perry!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nOverview!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\n\n\n**Name:** Perry\n\n**Species:** --//Arachis hypogaea// (Peanut)-- N/A \n\n**Primary Caretaker:** Moto Mitsuaki \n\n**Diet:** None needed!\n\n**Housed:** Willson's Wildlife Center, Enclosure 19\n\n**Note:** For some reason, the photos we take of Perry get automatically removed for \"copyright reasons\".

They are a concrete sculpture with some fancy Krylon-paint makeup that makes up their face. Now I know what you're thinking: \"Wilson's Wildlife is now treating an inanimate object like a puppy?! They must have gone mad!\", but don't be mistaken! Perry is actually very much alive and can move like any other Critter, although they only move when no caretakers are looking at them. Poor Perry must be very shy.\n\nIn fact, Perry is //so// shy that they will violently kill anyone nearby, without any hesitation, at the second no one is watching. They're quite the troublemaker! So if you're planning to visit our good pal, make sure to bring a friend along with you that keeps a good eye on them, and make sure that they alert you when they will blink, to keep Perry from doing some silly accidents.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nSo, don't get scared or anything, but we have absolutely no idea where Perry came from. Our buddy was given to us by the Supervisors back in '93, and they have refused to give us any knowledge on how they found them ever since. Quite the mysterious little bugger!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nAs Perry is not of the social kind, we decided it would be best to keep their enclosure indefinitely closed while they are inside. They seemed to have no problem with this and enjoy their time alone! A win-win for all!\n\nMake sure to keep accompanied caretakers with you when visiting Perry, and always make sure to close the enclosure door when everyone has entered. We don't want another Tuesday, do we? Or a Wednesday too for that matter. or that Friday. Or Monday. Or...\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Perry!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nPerry seems to have so much fun in their enclosure. You can sometimes hear them scraping the walls of their room in joy! How cute! Do make sure to alert Mr. Wilson if these scraping sounds suddenly stop, we don't wanna see our little friend in a sad mood.\n\nWhile Perry does not need to be fed, they still are capable of doing quite a doody! We don't know where it exactly comes from, but we did find a concerning amount of human blood on it, so, there's that. Make sure to clean the place two times a week with your partners, although we would really appreciate it if you do it as soon as you can because everyone else is either too scared to deal with this thing or has died and the shit is now filling up the entire place and I'm pretty sure they're gonna break out at any time now and i dont know what to do im losing my SHIT RIGHT NOW PLEASE I CANT KEEP PRETENDING THIS IS OKAY PLEASE HELP US\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but it's a Nexus □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but it's a Nexus ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Nexus #:** Nx-173\n\n**Civilian Designation:** \"Sculpture Island\"\n\n**Population:** Unknown\n\n**Area Class:** Dunwich\n\n**Nexus Interaction Protocol:** Nx-173's entrance is to be kept locked at all times.

When unobversed by another being, it moves at extreme speeds to snap the neck of nearby organisms, but otherwise stays still when sighted. Notably, it is able to generate fecal matter and human blood.\n\nIt is completely non-anomalous (see **History**).\n\n**History:** SCP-173-EX (at the time designated just \"SCP-173\") was transported to Site-19 in the year 1993 from Nx-173. Due to the unfamiliar nature of the entity and its abnormally aggressive behaviour, it was presumed to be anomalous and classified as Euclid.\n\nIt was not until four weeks later that the anomalous qualities of the item were questioned when the Explanation and Research Department (ExaRD) filed an investigation into SCP-173 due to the lack of information on its previous whereabouts and the rushed classification of its object class.\n\nExaRD argued that SCP-173 is not an anomalous animate sculpture as initially concluded by researchers, but is, in fact, a member of an undiscovered predatory species that is absolutely explainable under current scientific norms. The following points supported this theory:\n\n* The \"concrete\" and \"rebar\" that constitues SCP-173's body is actually organic material that consists of the exoskeleton and bone structure of the entity, respectively, and their similarities to human-made objects could be explained as an intentional camouflage design of its body, enabling cover from predators in urban human cities, which is assumed to be its natural environment. The Krylon-paint is theorized to not be an actual part of the entity's biology, but rather an act of vandalism by unknown parties.\n\n* Its hostility to human life is no less common to other predatory animal species. While SCP-173 has never been seen consuming its prey while in containment (probably due to the corpses of D-Class personnel being taken away from its chamber while being constantly observed, never giving it a chance to eat its targets), the excrement and human blood mixture that manifests around it confirms that it has eaten human beings at prior times.\n\n* SCP-173's behavior when in line of sight of another entity can be explained as both a defense and an attack mechanism, keeping itself still to give the impression of a dead animal to predators, while giving prey a false sense of security.\n\n* Finally, the most seemingly anomalous quality of the entity, its speed, is equal to various known small flying insects. The size and weight of SCP-173 can perfectly allow such speed to be made possible by an animal, as researched by ExaRD.\n\nWith permission from the Overwatch Council, the Explanation and Research Department reclassified SCP-173 from Euclid to Explained. As per protocol for explained animals and the Boring Agreement, custody of SCP-173-EX was given to Wilson's Wildlife Solutions's non-anomalous animal care sectors, for further research by the civilian scientific community and general residence.\n\n**Addendum:** As of the current date, SCP-173-EX has escaped the custody of WWS due to a structural collapse of its enclosure, which was filled with feces and human blood. Various neck-based injuries and deaths were reported in Boring, Oregon after this point, but SCP-173-EX has yet to be located by local animal control services. WWS was reprimanded appropriately.\n\nNo efforts to recover SCP-173-EX are being planned, as it is a non-anomalous animal. \n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"□ Me but written by yours truly □\" hide=\"▣  Me but written by yours truly ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Item:** SCP-173\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** I live in a locked container, pretty bollocks actually, I should be let out time to time.

Object Class: Euclid.” Robert’s not sure what they mean, but whatever they’re talking about can’t be good. \n\n“Special containment procedures?” Robert could tell this man is new here. He seems to be as curious as he is. “Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them,” the intelligent guard recites from memory. \n\nThe other one seems to be catching on now. “At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.” The second guard nods in approval at this statement. It was then that Robert gathered enough confidence to ask what he really wanted to know. \n\n“Description?” Robert muttered under his breath, although he’s sure they won’t give him the answer.\n\n“Moved to Site-19 1993.

It’s a ripped piece of cardboard with “SORRY 4 YOUR LOSS” written in what appears to be red paint (hopefully).]\n\n//“I know this isn’t enough, but, like… what else am I supposed to do? I’m literally made of concrete and rebar. Therapy? With 999? Sure. That’s happening. But he just… jiggles. Doesn’t really help me not snap necks.”//\n\n[SCP-173 wobbles on the stool again. There’s a loud crash as the stool breaks, and SCP-173 tumbles to the floor. The camera pans wildly before settling, slightly off-center. The synthetic voice resumes as though nothing happened.]\n\n//“Anyway, uh… thanks for watching, I guess. I’ll try to… be better? Or whatever. Like, share, subscribe, and... Don’t blink.”//\n\n[The video abruptly cuts to black, with no outro.

Uninterruptedly, two men must upholdeth a continuous gaze of focus at One-Seven-Three, until all men have vacated the dungeon and sealed the gate of iron.\n\n**Character of the Aberration:** Transported to the Great Nineteenth Fortress in the Year of our Lord Fifteen Ninety-Three. Ancestry is foreign and faraway. Constructed from moulded stone and rods of steel, with remnants of markings from the Krylon kingdom. One-Seven-Three is mobile and of great antagonistic belligerence. One-Seven-Three is stunned if given a gaze of unblinking focus. Unblinking gaze must never be interrupted with One-Seven-Three. Men prescribed duty with One-Seven-Three must communicateth any interruption of their gaze to one another. One-Seven-Three is observed to aggress on its prey via a fatal fracture of the bone of the nape, or via strangulation. Should any man bear witness to an assault by One-Seven-Three, wardens must consult the Fourth Degree Scrolls for guidance on the assertion of justice.\n\nPasser-byes of the dungeon may heareth reverberations of earthly grinding arising from the dungeon when no man’s unbroken gaze is present. Such reverberations are occurrences of ordinary and frivolous importance, and thou shalt communicateth any alterations of this demeanour to thine on-duty warden.\n\nThe scarlet-maroon texture which layeth itself upon the ground, is a repulsive aggregation of rectal excrement and sanguine fluids. The provenance of here bastardly materials are beyond the realm of contemporary knowledge. A fortnightly sanitation of the dungeon is currently organized.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but a child wrote it □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but a child wrote it ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Item #:**SCP-173\n\n**Objct Clas:** DANGRISS!!\n\n**Spechl Box Stuff:** 173 lives inside a big room, there is a dor and it got to be shut al the time or else he wil catch u!
