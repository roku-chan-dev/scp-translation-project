The same researchers are to accept the existence of SCP-[[$ \\sqrt{-1} $]] -J as axiomatic and ignore the naysayers. Inklings to hypothesize \"more likely\" reasons for the central question of this research project are to be resisted because the author desperately needs to publish something and quick, you guys.\n\nIn the event of never-before-approved, research-oriented screenings, testers of the study group are not to participate without cellophane lenses that are impregnated with tourmaline-based anaglyph technology and capable of antagonizing Aleph Meta level cognitoadverse effects. To protect further, and as a failsafe in the event of (1) an equipment malfunction or (2) the emergence of tourmaline-resistant instances, testers are to maintain 75% contraction of their orbicularis oculi muscles[[footnote]] Results in squinting. [[/footnote]] for the duration of the film(s). Electrodes may be placed to assist in the sustainment of said contractions.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Anaglyphspectacles|\n    caption=The current model of approved spectacles.

If approached with suspicion by any non-Foundation personnel, researchers are to immediately begin diversional maneuvers as outlined by Protocol SQRT—1.[[footnote]] \"If approached by a civilian or civilians, agents should maintain the guise of being homeless, preferably excusing themselves to micturate and/or defecate in any appropriately shaped receptacle or natural concavity, maintaining constant visualization with the civilian(s) until the post is safe to reapproach. Extended grunting has been correlated with increased efficacy. If successful production of stool is observed during such a manuever, the guise of vagrancy is to be discontinued and proper hygiene is to be performed. Conversely, if approached by a constabulary authority, agents should begin proselytizing abstruse esoterics of whichever hobby is most familiar to them. \n\nThese diversional maneuvers are intended to counterbalance any suspicion with disinterest and/or disgust in lieu of the Foundation not supporting any other proposed countermeasures, or the funding thereof.\"[[/footnote]]\n _\n\n**Description^^-1^^:**[[footnote]]The following were theses posed by the author throughout his --career-- tenancy, but were rejected by senior leadership because each has already been researched extensively, some to the limit of their usefulness.
