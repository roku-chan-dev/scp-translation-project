One of my few days off in spring. I drank milk straight from the jug without looking at the expiration date - it should have been spoiled for two days. It wasn't. Still fresh. \n> \n> 8:00 AM, Penny Naismith was off to school, and Mrs. Rosa Naismith told me that she had to go to a parent-teacher conference for Penny later.\n> \n> \"I'll go,\" I said.\n> \n> \"Don't,\" she said. \"It's your day off.\"\n> \n> \"Last week, I saw a D-class eaten alive by a snake made of intrusive thoughts. I think I can deal with bitchy teachers.\"\n> \n> Rosa grimaced, skeptical. //It's Mr. Glassman, isn't it,// I thought, starting to miss the Mind Viper.\n> \n> 9:00 AM. I sip a mimosa. There's a classic Doctor Who marathon on PBS. Old Tom Bakers. Rosa catches me grinning ear-to-ear as the title theme comes on. She laughs. \n> \n> 3:00 PM. Mr. Glassman, assistant principal, told me that my daughter \"doesn't handle bullies well.\"\n> \n> I said, \"then how about we do something about the kids trying to provoke her?\"\n> \n> He said, \"look, when she's older, you won't be there to force her to toughen up. Do you want to coddle your daughter all your life, or let her build character?\"\n> \n> Half an hour of smiling and nodding later, I took a photo out of my wallet. Said it was of Penny at her baptism. \n> \n> The photo was a of NARCISSUS-class visual cognitohazard that had just been decommissioned. Seeing the foam come from his mouth was one of the finer points of my life as a father, and well worth the reprimand from the O5 council.\n> \n> Mr. Glassman's still healthy, of course. Only difference is, he believes that if Penny ever cries, a seven-foot-tall eel-man lurking outside his peripheral vision will eat his eyeballs. \n> \n> 6:00 PM. Penny and I watched a movie that introduced her to swear words. She laughed hard enough to start wheezing. \n> \n> 8:00 PM. Penny's in bed early, contented. \n> \n> 8:30 PM. Pretty sure I can't go into detail on a Foundation email server, but Rosa's still got it after ten years. My pelvis still hurts thinking about it. God Bless America.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> You want happy endings?\n> \n> Fuck you.\n> \n> You want sad endings?\n> \n> Again, fuck you.\n> \n> There are only endings. If 15 years of service to a shadow fascist organization bent on locking up all our demons in boxes has taught me anything, it's that \"good\" and \"bad\" are completely subjective. One man's ZK-class reality failure is another man's orgasm.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> So.\n> \n> //Why bother?//\n> \n> -----\n> \n> Because sometimes, temporarily, everything goes right.\n> \n> Whatever your situation, however bad things get - As long as you're alive, there can always be a great day.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> You got this, Lisle. You're making Penny and Rosa proud, and Dr. Henderson too, wherever he is.\n>  \n> Don't let the nihilists and quitters seduce you. There will be more May 12th, 2016's if you can keep the bastards locked up.\n> \n> And if you can help it, don't detonate the on-site nuke until you've finished the Tom Baker episodes.\n> \n> Love,\n> Dr. Lisle Naismith\n> Site Director, Foundation Site-59\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
