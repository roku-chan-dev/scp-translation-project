These residences, designated collectively as SCP-6545-A, instantly replace the interior of the person's current property following 2-3 days after contact. Notably, a set of criteria is applied when detailing the abode the individual desires, which is as follows:\n\n* The property must not be used as a means to harm anyone, including oneself\n* The individual is prohibited from selling or otherwise taking advantage of any amenities within the property in terms of business\n* The property is unable to include any organisms, excluding plants\n* The property is unable to replicate areas which already exist\n\nThe subject is able to repeat the process multiple times as well as ask for a 'refund', in which case their home’s interior returns back into its previous state. Those attempting to go against the given rules automatically have their property reverted to its previous condition; any further attempts to contact Eccentric Quarters by these individuals are rejected.\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+++ **__EXPERIMENT LOGS__**\n[[/=]]\n\nThe following is a selection of test logs conducted using SCP-6545, the full list of which can be found in the Site-43 Database.\n\n||~ Test No.||~ Request||~ Result||\n||= 01||A garden with a tree at the center, capable of producing numerous kinds of fruits.||Request **##green | accepted.##** The floor was replaced by dirt, various plants were scattered across the area, along with a tree of an unidentified species centered in the room that grew various common and undiscovered fruits.

This was under the agreement that Dr. Simmons would file a request afterward.\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Simmons:** Alright, it should be recording.\n\n**PoI-6545:** Oh, you're recording this?\n\n**Simmons:** Yes, for future reference.\n\n**PoI-6545:** Is that so? //(Sighs)// Okay, then. Let's just hurry this up. I don't have all the time in the world, you know.\n\n**Simmons:** Apologies... Anyways, let's begin, shall we? //(Clears throat)// How long have you been working for Eccentric Quarters, Mrs. Tillson?\n\n**PoI-6545:** I prefer Janette, and this is my, what, second year here? Yeah, I've been working hard since mid-April.\n\n**Simmons:** And how'd you get the job?\n\n**PoI-6545:** You know, the usual. Filled in the job application, went on for an interview, and got the job a week or so after. The rest is history.\n\n**Simmons:** How has the company been treating you?\n\n**PoI-6545:** I'd say it's quite alright. Nothing special, but alright. I just sit here and mind my own business, really. Pay's also good.\n\n**Simmons:** Any complaints?\n\n**PoI-6545:** I guess you could say it's a bit boring? Well, I don't mind. I'm quite used to it by now.\n\n**Simmons:** Who else works for the company? Anyone you knew beforehand?\n\n**PoI-6545:** Only a few of my colleagues.\n\n**Simmons:** How're they?\n\n**PoI-6545:** They're fine most of the time, though they can be somewhat pushy. That might just be me, who knows... How many questions do you have left? I wanna hurry this up.\n\n**Simmons:** It's only this question, then we're done. Again, I apologize. Could you possibly tell me the corporation’s process when gifting people their //(pause)// \"dream house?\"\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**Simmons:** Hello? Is anybody home?\n\n**PoI-6545:** Ah, well, umm...it starts with- //(coughs)// sorry, c-could you give me a sec? I'm like half asleep right now.\n\n**Simmons:** Sure.\n\n**PoI-6545:** I truly am sorry. I just haven't had coffee this morning.\n\n**Simmons:** It's quite alright. You don't need to apologize. Just take your time.\n\n**PoI-6545:** Thank you.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**PoI-6545:** Right, so basically, it starts with the caller sending in a request of their dream home. Then, after some planning and such, we head out and presto-change-o, their house gets remodeled. Well, it's only the interior, but still.\n\n**PoI-6545:** I would go more into detail, but I only make the calls. I don't know much of anything else.\n\n**Simmons:** Could you at least elaborate on how they can locate their current home or what you mean by \"presto-change-o\"?\n\n**PoI-6545:** Like I said, not my department, so I can't say //(yawns)//... So yeah, we're done here, right?\n\n//Simmons flips through the pages in his notepad.//\n\n**Simmons:** Mhm, that is all. Thank you very much for this interview.\n\n**PoI-6545:** Hey, don't go thanking me just yet. You still haven't told me your dream house. We promised, remember?\n\n**Simmons:** Of course, of course. Just, um, just give me a moment to think.\n\n**PoI-6545:** Alright.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**PoI-6545:** You done?\n\n**Simmons:** Right, right, uh… I guess, maybe, Hogwarts? An empty version of it, obviously. //(Breathes in deeply)// I was quite the fan of Harry Potter when I was a young lad, so that would be nice.\n\n**PoI-6545:** No can do, sir.\n\n**Simmons:** How come?\n\n**PoI-6545:** It's in the rules... Are you not aware of the rules?\n\n**Simmons:** I am, but what is the problem?\n\n**PoI-6545:** //(Sighs)// Hogwarts is in use.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n**Afterword:** PoI-6545 declined to provide further information on this topic, citing client privilege.
