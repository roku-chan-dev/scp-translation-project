Intruders are to be apprehended and ammnesticized appropriately prior to release.\n\nSCP-XXXX[[footnote]]Not a typo.[[/footnote]] [sic] is to remain sealed within the confines of SCP-7537 indefinitely.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7537 is a large building resembling an office block, located in a previously barren section of desert in [REDACTED], United States. A single sub-level exists beneath SCP-7537, accessible via a lone elevator shaft. Between this level and SCP-7537 is a proportional amount of empty underground-space, containing no additional sub-levels or subterranean implementations, save for the elevator shaft.\n\nThe SCP Foundation insignia appears throughout SCP-7537’s interior, although no identifying site designation has been discovered as of yet. No additional buildings exist within the surrounding area. Through SCP-7537’s windows can be seen various rooms, including a central lobby, offices, and hallways that are painted grey or white and lit up by fluorescent ceiling lights. No activity has been detected within SCP-7537 since its discovery.\n\nThe area in which SCP-7537 manifested was formally designated as a potential location for constructing future Foundation facilities, passing all environmental safety and security requirements. Given the location's expansive size and separation from public notice, the area would have most likely been used as the grounds for a containment facility for potentially high-risk anomalies. No proposals for such a site were ever planned. SCP-7537 manifested gradually over the span of a single week, initially being incorporeal and appearing heavily faded to viewers, before eventually becoming tangible.\n\n**Addendum - Exploration Log:**\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Exploration Log\" hide=\" \"]]\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Command:** Mics clear. Continue.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Ok. Entering the main lobby.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** God, this place is boring. Look at it, no decorations or anything. Not even any music.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Why’d there be music?\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** The lighting functions just fine. Whole place has been lit up for two weeks straight since initial discovery. Why wouldn’t a lobby have music playing before it jumped? Does in most Foundation sites I’ve been to.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Not where I was before transferal.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Christ, Site-17 must've been boring.\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Maybe it's to fit the ambiance?\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Yeah, which is none at all. I assumed this was gonna be one of those “transported from another reality” sort of deals. But this place is just dull, no personality or obvious cause. \n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** There’s a clock on the wall just there… It’s stuck on 11:59:59, odd.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Let’s keep going.\n> \n> //Agents exit the main lobby and enter a lit hallway. They pass by several rooms containing nothing of interest. Agents enter into a large cafeteria. Tables and chairs are neatly arranged, various meals sit on trays.//\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Huh. Food’s fresh. Look, some are still steaming hot. No movement was detected in this area before we entered, right?\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Yes, not since initial manifestation either. Let’s check the kitchen.\n> \n> //Agents pass by several tables. Food consists of standard hot and cold meals served in Foundation sites. Food countertops are powered on and contain untouched food. Agent Brendon enters the kitchen, which is empty.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Check the ovens and stoves.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** They’re all cold. No heat on the hobs either. So how’s everything out there warm?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Look over here. The fridge and freezers are completely empty. Not even any ice. Pantry’s empty too. Not even any shelves.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Clock's the same in here too.\n> \n> //A clock on the wall reads “11:59:59”.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** No time has passed. The food’s been like this for at least two weeks, just sitting out there ready to be eaten.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** It should be the offices up next.\n> \n> [Extraneous data removed]\n> \n> //Agents enter an office. Ticking can be heard.//\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Clock’s the same in here too? Seconds hand isn’t moving though… So where’s the ticking coming from?\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Could be from one of the cubicles. Try looking for anything that stands out.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Everything looks the fucking same in here.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Yeah. Almost identical to 17's accounting office.\n> \n> //Team separates into two groups. Agents Brendon and Cameron search the cubicles, Agents Paulson and Richards inspect nearby offices. All cubicles contain an identical workstation consisting of a computer, chair, and filing cabinet. All computer monitors are turned on, displaying either a plain desktop, or blank writing document. Agents Brendon and Cameron eventually encounter a cubicle with three polaroid photographs pinned to its interior wall.//\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Finally, something different.\n> \n> //The three photographs all include an identical middle-aged man with balding white hair. In one, the man stands alongside a woman of similar age and a young girl. The Eiffel Tower is visible in the background, all three are smiling. In another, the man is pictured standing next to a sign reading “Yellowstone National Park”, he stares towards the camera vacantly. The last picture shows him amongst several other people in an office space. A banner reading “Merry Christmas!” hangs from the ceiling; most appear to be celebrating while he is visibly tired and frowning.//\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Wait. Look at this…\n> \n> //Agent Cameron closely examines the third photograph. He is pictured standing amongst the other staff.//\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** What the fuck? \n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** That’s the 2019 Christmas party we had back at Site-17. I remember the whole thing. You drank too much and got thrown out, didn’t you?\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** That’s not relevant. I don’t remember this guy though. Name plate on the desk reads “Ronald Christian”. Ring any bells?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** I remember posing for the photograph, actually… I’m trying to remember if he-\n> \n> //Agent Cameron pauses.//\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Strange. When I try remembering that guy, nothing comes up. Just a vacant spot where he should be standing.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Ok, that’s weird. You feel ok?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Yeah, I’m fine. We get checked for cognitohazards after this anyway.\n> \n> //Elsewhere, agents Paulson and Richards check several office doors. Most name plates are blank, until they find one reading “Site Director William Debris”. They enter the office, which contains a single desk, chair, a potted plant in the corner, and other basic furnishings. A framed photo on the desk shows a young man with a cybernetic arm and a young boy. The boy is looking at the man’s arm excitedly while the man laughs.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Haha, cute.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** I swear, I’ve seen that guy in stock images…\n> \n> //Agent Paulson opens a drawer in the desk. She pulls out the only item: A folder with “SCP-XXXX” [sic] printed on the front. She opens the file, revealing several written documents that have been almost completely censored with black bars and the phrases  “[REDACTED]”, and “[DATA EXPUNGED]” throughout. A photograph inside the file shows a large metal door, with a window that has been partly censored. Underneath a caption reads “SCP-XXXX’s containment chamber”.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** “XXXX”. Could it be an esoteric designation?\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Containment procedures are right here: “SCP-XXXX is to be contained within a specialised containment chamber... In the Restricted Containment- //pauses// ...Wing of Site-XX”? The rest’s too long to read right now.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Guess we have a name for this place then. Let’s get the others and go.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** But evidently no thesaurus.\n> \n> [Extraneous data removed]\n> \n> //Group walks through a desolate hallway. The sound of ticking can be heard, despite there being no clocks present.//\n> \n> [Extraneous data removed]\n> \n> //Agents enter the elevator. All floor buttons are blank, except for one at the very bottom labeled “00”. None of the other buttons function when pressed. “00” is chosen, and the elevator begins moving.//\n> \n> **Recorded Voice:** Floor Zero - Restricted Containment Wing.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Didn’t even need any clearance…\n> \n> //The elevator drones for two minutes before stopping. The doors open to reveal a long narrow hallway containing multiple cell doors.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Mic check. Command, do you read?\n> \n> **Command:** You’re clear. No disturbances.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Good, let’s keep going.\n> \n> //Team continues down the hallway. Various containment chambers are seen with SCP designations on the front, none of which match any currently existing SCPs (SCP-????, SCP-____, SCP-####, etc). Several are equipped with one-way windows for looking inside, although nothing can be seen within the featureless cells. Agent Brendon inspects one of the doors.//\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Won’t budge… Wait.\n> \n> //Agent Brendon closely inspects the bottom of the door. He then turns and pulls on its handle several times.//\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** It’s not a real door. It’s just attached to the wall.\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** I bet they all are. \n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** No, wait. Look over there.\n> \n> //Through one of the windows can be seen a table lit by a single fluorescent light. On the table sits a large firearm resembling a rifle and a clipboard. The rifle has been fitted with several unidentified augmentations. A document attached to the clipboard reads “SCP-++++ - Chekhov’s Gun”.//\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Fucking subtle.\n> \n> //Agent Brendon attempts to turn the handle, finding it to be locked.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** We’ll come back for that later. Let’s go.\n> \n> //Agents pass through several additional hallways, all of similar, unremarkable appearance. Eventually the team enter through a pair of double doors labeled “SCP-XXXX Containment Wing”. Inside is a transport trolley leading into a large, subterranean tunnel. On the trolley’s control panel is a large red button.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Permission to continue forward?\n> \n> **Command:** Go ahead.\n> \n> //Agent Paulson activates the trolley and it begins to move towards “SCP-XXXX”’s containment wing.//\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** What do the rest of you think of this so far?\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Alternate Foundation from another reality? Something went wrong? That’s usually the case. I’ve heard of a few.\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** I’m not sure, and why were only two personnel in that office named? My head’s still ringing.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** First guy seemed to have a life from the look of those photographs. Do you remember anyone mentioning a guy named “Ronald Christian” back at 17?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Maybe? Nothing concrete. Just ideas, if you’d call them that. I can imagine someone like that walking around Site-17… All serious and professional… hardly spending time with his family. That’s why he was alone in the other photos. Wife eventually left him and took the kid after he told her about his transfer here. Then the head of site made a major discovery and wanted him on a special project and became obsessed with something big that should have been kept buried but they did it for the sake of discovery as that’s what Director William Debris always told him but in the end their curiosity got thebetterofthebothofthemandthewholesiteexperiencedamasscontai-\n> \n> **Agent Paulson** Cameron… Cameron! Christ!\n> \n> //Agent Cameron jolts up.//\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Erm… God, what was that?\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** You went off on a monologue. Are you ok?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Yeah. Think I’m fine. What the hell?\n> \n> //The trolley comes to a stop and the team gets off. Agents stand in-front of a metal door. Beyond the other side, alarms can be heard blaring. Agents all nod to one another before opening the door. Alarms can immediately be heard from inside. The interior hallway is submerged in darkness, only lit by the occasional flash of red alarm lights. The team passes by several rooms containing large computing structures covered in various glowing lights; most are producing smoke along with sparks flying out. Rumbling throughout the hallway and explosions from passing rooms can be heard as the team make their way through. In one of the rooms is a large computer monitor that reads “CONTAINMENT BREACH IMMINENT”.//\n> \n> //Agents reach a door at the end of another hallway. They enter.//\n> \n> //Team arrives in a small room. The walls and ceiling are constructed out of metal and the floor is concrete. On the far side wall is a single metal door, to the left side is a placard reading “SCP-XXXX”. All noises from the other room have become inaudible.//\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** Thank god.\n> \n> //Agent Paulson approaches the containment chamber of “SCP-XXXX“ and looks inside through its window. The chamber appears empty.//\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** What do you see?\n> \n> **Agent Paulson** Come take a look.\n> \n> //Agents approach and take turns to look inside.//\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Is that a... No, wait… It’s going back into its main mass… Something else is coming out now, like a big cluster of a eyes…\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** No, there’s a tail. Horns too. Long spider legs, creepy.\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** The whole thing is translucent. Can just make out its shape around the edges.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Command, are you seeing anything?\n> \n> **Command:** No. Nothing on our end. What do you see?\n> \n> //Agent Paulson looks back at the others//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Some sort of mass. Translucent, and in a constant state of reshaping. It seems none of us are seeing the same thing though. It's trying to take on a certain form. More like it's resisting, trying to go back to its original form of a shapeless mass. Almost looks like something is pulling at it and trying to reshape it like clay. Cameron, anything?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** I think maybe something like... It definitely feels like a monster. Looks like so many other things that I've seen before. That one lighthouse creature with a giant eye. A skull lady submerged in red flame. That giant spider we dealt with last month... It became all of those things briefly for a just few seconds when I just looked at it. I think this is meant to be what that Christian guy was helping contain, and he had a whole bunch of reasons to let it out, and screw over Director Debris. You heard what I said before, guy seemed to have lost his way. But-\n> \n> //Agent Cameron reaches for the door handle. At this point, the visual phenomena similarly described by agents becomes visible on the camera feed. Agent Cameron then puts his hand down and SCP-XXXX is no longer visible on camera again.//\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** What?\n> \n> **Agent Cameron:** None of it feels real. This isn't //that// monster, at least yet. It feels incomplete, like it could be a monster whenever it shifts into something though. But then it's not anymore. I think it doesn't want to be. But if we open this door to find out and cause the containment breach, that's it. It won't be able to resist becoming whatever this place wants it to be anymore.\n> \n> //Cameras continue to show nothing inside the chamber//\n> \n> **Agent Richard:** We shouldn't do anything further until we know exactly what this is.\n> \n> **Agent Brendon:** Or maybe we should just leave it. Have someone run some tests before crossing the chamber's threshold.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Agreed. Command, we're ready to leave.\n> \n> **Command:** Very well. Return to base.\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** Let's go.\n> \n> //Agents exit the room, leaving the empty containment chamber.//\n> \n> [Extraneous data removed]\n> \n> **Agent Richards:** Wait. Should we go back for that gun?\n> \n> **Agent Paulson:** No. It’s not important.\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n> \n> **Note:** A follow-up investigation revealed multiple Foundation personnel stationed at or formerly located at Site-17 to have experienced a sudden recollection of SCP-7537 as an official Foundation containment site, recognising it primarily as the workplace of a \"Ronald Christian\". This phenomena ceased following Agent Cameron's refusal to release SCP-XXXX from its chamber. All affected personnel claimed to be under the impression that the location was about to experience a site-wide containment breach caused by a Keter or Apollyon level anomalous entity.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
