Researchers who are big babies[[footnote]]I'm looking at **you,** Kyle.[[/footnote]] are not allowed to conduct research with the item.\n\n**Description:** SCP-314-J is an anomalous mathematical textbook entitled //\"Numerical Proofs (That You Suck)\".// Individuals who open the textbook are greeted with a blank page that begins to populate itself with a series of mathematical proofs, diagrams, flow-charts, bar-charts, pie-charts, and cake-charts that culminate with a logically consistent rationale for why each individual is a terrible person. This invariably results in said individual not being able to be chill about this.[[footnote]] Seriously, Kyle, it's just a textbook. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Experiment Log SCP-314-J:** The following is a log of various tests involving different personnel and SCP-314-J.\n\n\n> **Individual:** Researcher Zhang Wen\n> **Result:** SCP-314-J flipped open to a page with a hypothetical proof with unknown variables. When Researcher Zhang finished working out the proof to confirm that the two compound matrices A and B were in fact identical, the book flipped open to the next page to reveal that A = \"Your Mom\" and B = \"Dumber Than a Sack of Bricks.\"\n> **Notes:** //\"My mom's dead, man. What the hell.\"// -Researcher Zhang Wen.\n\n\n> **Individual:** Agent Stephen Adams\n> **Result:** When Agent Adams opened the book, a single line proof by intimidation appeared: \"The proof of why Agent Adams sucks is trivial, and left as an exercise for beginning students.\"\n> **Notes:** //\"Where the FUCK do you get off you little shit? Square up, I'm about to-\"// -Agent Stephen Adams to SCP-314-J, prior to being physically restrained and dragged out of  the testing chamber.\n\n\n> **Individual:** Researcher James, Age 11\n> **Result:** SCP-314-J opens to a random page, showing the following equation: \"1 + 1 = ur a lil' bitch.\"\n> **Notes:** Researcher James was officially consoled with a juice box and a promise to take him to McDonalds after work.\n\n\n> **Individual:** Junior Researcher Riemann\n> **Result:** SCP-314-J opened to a complex mathematical proof about sets or something. Junior Researcher Riemann was heard to exclaim \"Finally! Something that appreciates my work!\" Following 3 weeks of work on the proof, Junior Researcher Riemann went into the testing chamber, only to run out 3 minutes later, in tears.\n> **Notes:** Junior Researcher Riemann officially reprimanded and told to grow up. Jesus, I thought you liked math shit?\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
