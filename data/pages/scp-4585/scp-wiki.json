Interaction with SCP-4585 requires Level 2 or higher security clearance. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4585, physically, is a standard hamburger made by the Steak 'n Shake Corporation. SCP-4585 is sapient, and can speak in German via a voice of unknown origin. This voice has reached a maximum of 142 dB. SCP-4585 is also capable of using the five senses[[footnote]] Hearing, sight, taste, smell, touch [[/footnote]] and will not decompose. SCP-4585 can voluntarily cause SCP-4585-1 manifestation events, but is unable to cause a manifestation event if less than one month has elapsed since the last one. SCP-4585-1 manifestation events can number a maximum of 25 manifestations.\n\nPhysically, SCP-4585-1 instances are smaller than SCP-4585, but otherwise identical. In addition to SCP-4585's anomalous properties, SCP-4585-1 instances also possess the ability to generate french fries. They utilize said french fries in a similar fashion to a throwing spear. SCP-4585-1 instances use telekinesis to throw these weapons, but have not shown this ability on other objects. The french fry will demanifest after it is thrown.\n\nIn the event that the meat of an SCP-4585-1 instance is completely separated from the rest of the rest of the hamburger, all anomalous effects of that individual instance will cease. It is presumed that a similar effect takes place on SCP-4585 itself. \n\nNeither SCP-4585 or SCP-4585-1 instances are capable of locomotion.\n\n**Addendum 4585-1:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 4585-1\" hide=\"- Interview Log 4585-1\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-4585\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Johnson\n> \n> **Foreword:** This interview was conducted 12 days following SCP-4585’s discovery and containment. The interview has been translated into English.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Hello SCP-4585, I would like to ask you some questions.\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Who are you? \n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Alex Johnson, can I ask some questions?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** //(pause)// If you insist, I will humor you, what would you like to know?\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Where did you come from? Were you created at the Steak 'n Shake where we found you?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Oh, heavens no. I was born in my great city of Hamburg. \n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, is that the Hamburg in Germany?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Of course! No other city can touch its beauty! I am fortunate enough to be the city's rightful duke. You must sense that you are in the presence of great royalty, my friend.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh-huh, of course you are. If you originated in Germany, how did you end up a continent away?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I swam.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** //(pause)// But, you can’t move.\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I am the Duke of Hamburg.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Can... how does that affect anything?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I don’t follow.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, whatever. We can return to that a little later. Are your //(pause)// subjects //(pause)// also like you? As in-\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Our appearance? Yes! That is part of what makes Hamburg so great! After all, it's a lot easier to catch this world’s criminals if they cannot move.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** that’s no- whatever. That's useful too, I guess. Is everyone in that place like you?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Yes.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Then how do you catch criminals? Actually, scratch that, how does the whole thing operate?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I can assure you, our justice system is very effective. I don't even get involved! Just in case I feel the urge to do injustice on my citizens! Isn't that great!\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Sure, but, how does the city operate? I mean, nobody can move, you wouldn't be able to do anything other than sit around.\n> \n> //[Approximately 4 seconds of silence]//\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Excuse me, but are you threatening to incapacitate Hamburg! The greatest city of them all!\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** No, how wo-\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I will not allow you to attack my subjects, Johnson!

That was loud, you know!\n> \n> **Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):** Hey, are you alright in there?\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Yeah, but it looks like we have the loudest thing in Site-50 over here!\n> \n> **Senior Researcher Serdra (over intercom):** What abo-\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** I don't really care, this interview's over. Turn off that camera please.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Following this interview, Junior Researcher Johnson advised against classifying SCP-4585's Hamburg as SCP-4585-2, citing SCP-4585's inability to explain how the city would function. Further investigation into SCP-4585’s origins is recommended.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 4585-2\" hide=\"- Interview Log 4585-2\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-4585\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Johnson\n> \n> **Foreword:** This interview was intended to further question SCP-4585 about its origins.

I need to check with my superiors.\n> \n> //[Junior Researcher Johnson leaves the room. 4 minutes and 16 seconds pass before Johnson reenters the room]//\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Okay, so can you tell me more about this Hamburg you mentioned last time?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I have told you all you need to know in our last encounter.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Well, but could you give us a general layout of the city?

Why would I trust you.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Well, what do you want? What could we do to regain your trust?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Hmm...\n> \n> //[Roughly 2 seconds of silence]//\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** I want, at the very least, all of Site-50 ceded to the Duchy of Hamburg. Meaning me of course.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Ha! Uh no. Wait, how did you know the site number?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Reconnaissance. Anyway, if you aren’t going to hand over Site-50, I will consider this trade a failure for the people of Hamburg.\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Uh, can you elaborate on this reconnaissance you just mentioned?\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** No, we are talking about a trade, are we not?\n> \n> **Junior Researcher Johnson:** Are you just g-\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** Okay, this is starting to feel more like an interview then a meeting.

Are you a coward?\n> \n> //[Roughly 3 seconds pass]//\n> \n> **SCP-4585:** [UNINTELLIGIBLE] \n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4585 has been uncooperative in all follow-up interviews. Testing on the SCP-4585-1 instance was approved. For details on these tests, see Document 4585-T1. Due to Junior Researcher Johnson's lack of professionalism and tendency to provoke SCP-4585, he has been reprimanded and transferred to another project.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 4585-2:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Security Log 836-8\"hide=\"-Security Log 836-8\"]]\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following recording was taken from Site-50 Security Camera #836, located in SCP-4585's old cell.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **<07:33:12>** SCP-4585-1 Manifestation Event occurs, 22 SCP-4585-1 instances manifest inside the cell.\n> \n> **<07:33:20>** SCP-4585 begins vocalization with the SCP-4585-1 instances.\n> \n> **<13:55:56>** Security guard John Trockies enters SCP-4585's cell on a routine sweep of Site-50's Safe Wing.
