I might try some modelling, ██████████ seems to enjoy it.  Need to study hard for my ███████ test first though, or my ███████ will get mad!\n> - ████\n\n> [ENTRY TWO]\n> Dear █████,\n> ██████ in just a few days, hope I do ok.  ███████ is going to fail cause he broke up with █████████ like a week ago and hasn’t studied at //all,// ███.  He totally begged me to study with him but I'm over it.  ███████  are so immature.\n> I’m a little bit bummed the █████████ lost the other day, but maybe with █████████████ on the ███ they'll make a comeback next ██████.  :)\n>  :|  Some █████████████ work going on in my neighbourhood.  It’s really noisy, makes it hard to focus on ███████.  I wish they would just ███████.\n> - ████\n\n> [ENTRY THREE] \n> Dear █████,\n> Today was //bizarre// :/  The whole ██████ collapsed and they had to evacuate the neighbourhood, and then this big ███████ fell through the ████ in the middle of the █████.  Some ███ in █████ coats came to get things under control, though.  They say they're with the ██████████, whatever that is?\n> On the bright side, ███████ test postponed! :)\n> - ████\n\n> [ENTRY FOUR]\n> Dear █████ or ██████ who finds this,\n> I’m scared.  Where am I?\n> The ██████████ people told me to stay away from ███████ but I thought it'd be okay to just grab my ███... but then the ███████ came back suddenly and I ████ through the ███████ and now I'm somewhere else. ._. I'm so stupid... I don’t like it here, makes me sick to my ███████.  Everything has too many █████ and I can see things ███████ around.  I want to go ████.\n> - ████\n\n> [ENTRY FIVE]\n> Dear █████,\n> Oh ███ I saw the most horrible ██████ here.  They had █████████ flesh inside their ████ and so many little ██████ with ████! And their ██ were full of this █████ liquid >_< One of them got me in the ████ with this █████!  And then they got all █████ when I tried to ███████ them... my ████ really hurts. :(\n> Bleh, I think I’m going to ████ up.  I hope ███ and ███ are ok, wherever they are.  Please ██████ find me soon or I might ████████.\n> - ████\n\n>  [ENTRY SIX]\n> Dear █████,\n> …oh ew I’m dripping ████ all over the pages aren’t I?  But I can’t seem to stop ███████.  These ██████ are //everywhere//.  At least ███ ones in big ██████████ my █████ with their ███████ and it hurts so badly I could ██████.   Why do these ██████ happen to me?  All I ever wanted was █████████████████ and now I'm covered in some kind of ████ and it //burns//. ;-;  I wonder if █████ will miss me?  I never had a chance to say ███████.\n> The ██████ things are coming, ew, I’m trying really hard not to ████ on this █████.  So many of them, all with their little ████ and ████ swinging.  This entire place is horrible, but these ██████, are just so…\n> I’ve never seen anything so //disg//\n\n----------\n\n[LOG ENDS]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
