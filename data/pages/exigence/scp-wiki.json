Here I name myself unlike the others,\ndue to absence of agency. I shall recover a mythos\nempty of thought and without will because this bit of folklore\ncannot be my own. I write with the quill of a thousand.\nI shall write on the paper of more. This is not a story.\nBut the story. The one that grants us all others.\nIt is a love letter scripted by pen to the parchment.\nThese are the syllables past that were drowned through corruption and failure.\nThis is the rhythm that quiets, but shall not and can not be silent.\nThis is the dawn of a Hero.\n\nAges and eons ago, there lived one ruler of all things.\nFor each vassal he took himself a new name, with it came strength.\nTo one servant appearing as master of forges and blacksmiths,\nto others, guises of love, beasts, travel, and light were what they knew.\nBut one name was above all others, king, and as all know,\na king who is without heir must rule shamefully. Therefore,\nthis man, who would halt in response to no force in this world\nexcept challenges that his own pride could not let him ignore,\nsaw this disgrace as no frivolous issue, flensed from his kingdom\nmighty pieces of land and beside them mightier titles,\nand forged this strength all in a powerful mass so it could be\nhis son. Then, the remainder of these lost letters of lifeblood\nfound themselves in a crude snare, gripped by an emperor forlorn,\nall for the purpose of further creation and passing of birthrights.\nThese strange faces enrapt by the one who lacks a description\nhad their shapes transfixed into something new, unexpected,\ncold. One circlet of pure gold, inlaid with gemstones of two types.\nThe first: black. True darkness embodied, with all of its comfort.\nGentle embraces of night shall always provide the requested\nchances to sleep, which any of those who work have in their prayers.\nThe other: Red. The color exactly of blood, with its vibrance.\nCoursing along in the veins of a soldier, fighting for glory\njust as he fights for his freedom and honor, valiant virtues.\nAfter assembling this trophy, the fool who surrendered his power\nhanded it down to his sole heir. Then, because all of his names fled\nthe man, once an immortal, degraded with time, as do all men.\nWhether the loss was in mind or in body is known to but one soul,\nwhichever took place, through some means or another, the grey one\nhad sod layered atop him. But some things always refuse death.\nFrom fresh grave dirt, the names grew. Rapidly, at the beginning,\nslowly, upon their correct form taking its roots in the soil.\nShapes of a city rose from the deep ground, then, all at once, stopped.\nThe city was complete and its gold throne seated the named heir.\nIn turn, this crown bearer had one offspring, such a daughter\nwhose fame outweighed all, even his, not due to her title,\nthe cause lied in her beauty, which surpassed even thoughts of perfection,\nsince mortal minds cannot understand what such a word means\nmost souls choose to envision their personal interests as ideal,\nwhat they miss is the force that unites them collectively,\nbeauty of this sort transcends past the subjective to reach truth.\nThis is the reason behind the amassed suitors in the courtyard\nFrom all stations and walks they come, like a roaring inferno,\ndrawn to an insect, which grows in cocoons, that has been dried,\nleft to the mercy of nature, the one who is fickle and heartless.\nFlames could always go up the defenseless tree and in one move\nswallow the bug with a passionate kiss until both of the hearts warm.\nThis was her fate, which she all but accepted as certain and noble.\nThis was her fame, which her parent embraced. Henceforth, he was known as\nFather and she, the Girl.\n\nThere are, however, towns not part of the city of named ones.\nThese towns fail to appear on the maps that travelers carry,\ndue to the strange fact that no wandering soul can arrive there\n(setting aside some entities who need no introduction).\nEntrance is not an option, only escape, which only a few found,\nmost through death, which, as all know, serves as the easy solution,\nsome through tricks so real that even the memories were fooled,\none through nobler means, unexpected by kinsmen around him,\nmainly because the one who left was a stranger to their minds.\nThey knew only of the boy, who would toil for hours,\ngrow, painstakingly, sown seeds, saplings, and sprouts in the soil\nand reap all that he could from the world around him without care\nbut, at the same time, there was no ill will in him, simply\nput, he was just young, selfish at times, as are mortals eternal,\nwhen they tell white lies to convince their friends and companions\nthat they are not that thing which they happen to seem like.\nThis boy, who lived lacking a father or parent of different\nsort, thrived using the farm that his departed adults left,\nbut, that does not grant him the life he is destined to handle.\nSensing his future ahead, this boy found passion in tall tales,\nseemings of things that were not real, and distortions of what were.\nThat is a beautiful thing, but not one that is approved of\nin one's own lifespan. So the boy lived sadly and lonely.\nThen, as he labored to plant all day while the sun, in its cruelty\nseared skin just as a flame that climbs up a tree to assault those\nwho most days would seek out fires in foolish amusement\nrapt in the dreams of a light that they can hold in a sixth leg,\nillness came and fatigue rose sharply until the essence\nleft his internal chamber and passed on. Thereby, losing his bright spark,\nthis boy fell to the ground, dead.\n\n**###DA9100|That is impossible. This tale hurts to inscribe. It is something\nwrong, or mistaken.##** This boy lived, most certainly, just not\nheld in the same form that he expects. This change is a comfort,\nbrought by his own deeds. While Death swept through unfinished fields of his labor\nwrapping around roots, stalks, and a few scorched flowers, sinking\nteeth in the sun-seared flesh of the life-starved boy in the dry fields,\nforces amassed to allow the betrayed boy life yet renewed. With\ncries to the dead and alive soul watchers, he rose up off black ground.\nThe boy died, but the Hero lived.\n\nHeroes awaking in fields lack memory, yet they replace it\nwith drive, destiny, dreams, and desire, the virtues expected\nfrom eyes that watch their lives. Who could not be incensed with\npurpose upon seeing their work half done? And the Hero,\nwho is as driven as any, attacked ruthlessly the labor.\nSpade serving as a weapon to crack stubborn and unyielding\ndirt. In his dextrous phalanges abundance of kernels cascaded,\nspilling onto the soil until ripe trunks and spelunking\nroots thrived. Like monsoons tear lifeless topsoil from stone beds,\nleaving pools in their wake, this brave Hero, who nurtured along life,\nleft bright vibrant trees in his domain, watered with cold sweat.\nHarvest approached him before dusk fell. In his heart, the conscripted\nHero observed an affection for home, although it had never\nshown him the same love. So, as a gift from his newly acquired\nfate, he assembled the town as one mass, calling together\nyouthful and ancient until they questioned his motives for meeting,\nas would any in their shoes.\n\nThus, in response, did the Hero assert with a cunning announcement:\n\"Friends, you will always astound me with your fear. Please, am I so cruel\nthat to be seen in the same building is a sin? Can I not hope\nthat a companion would be beside me in my weak attempts to grow?\nI only wish to unearth your kindness. Or, is the concern\nnot me? My produce is pristine I assure you of that much.\nThen is the flaw in my home? It is small, I confess, but if that is\nall, then I must recognize nothing binding our communion\nto the interior. Come, sit on grass, eat from trees, I am hosting\nyou, and the town as a whole, for a reason. After we live free,\njust as we all must someday, you will awake to an absence.\nI will have left for the city and never returned to this wasteland.\nI do not need to command you against crying, as I notice\nno tears. Sad, but expected. Fame is a wonderful concept,\nthus why stories are told of the famed, but it means less than nothing,\nto me, at least. No, this performance is not an attempt to\nmake myself loved. I do this for a simple and plain cause:\nI can, therefore I should. What else could be the central\ndrive of a Hero? So eat well\"\n\nThese words carefully chosen, the Hero concluded and then lied\ndown on the ground, but in doing this, faded to sleep in an instant.\nWhile he was splendid in spreading his spoils, he proved to be, sadly,\nquite inexperienced at the commanding of guests and so they took\nall of the treasures they could. While hardly amounting to greatness\ntheir hoard marked a betrayal the Hero enraged his own self by.\nThus, like a cyclone carving a course of attack he announced his\nexit and through the aggression he brought each traitor to their knees\n(such statements shall kindly be left unspoken by this tale).\nThen, with his boots laced fully, he strode until home was a distant\nmemory. During the journey he felt //##purple|watched.##// But he was not quite\ncunning enough to observe the observer and so he continued\nwalking along to the city\n\nValiant deeds made themselves known to the Hero whose name was\ncalled by the world itself. Here, soldiers recruiting for bloodshed,\nthere, lost victims in need of a leader. The Hero who sowed grain\nknew that his true goal rested away from the noise of the needy.\nSo, he discovered the true gemstone of the city, the Girl,\nstanding upon her balcony just as a stone on the mountain\npinnacle perches precarious, crowds from around the entire\nworld amass to observe how long it survives in its strange stance.\nThe brave Hero observed this cruelty and vowed to defend her,\nshoulder the weight of her hand, and to give her his hand in return. But,\nsuch threats stood in the way of his quest: the convening admirers,\nlaws of the city denouncing an outside marriage, and worst yet,\nthe Father, so strict he would stop his own daughter from wedding\nrich, poor, noble and cruel. All suitors regardless of merit\nare cast far from his door. The dauntless Hero, a brave youth,\nopenly wept at the challenge. These wise lacrimal drops pooled\ndown by his feet and created a gate for a //##purple|being##// to cross through.\nHearing his carefully-chosen emotions, it felt that it must take\npity and came to his aid.\n\n//##purple|This old entity##// hails from before the Hero, the Father,\neven the one whose names are innumerable. This visitor called\nherself //##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Magic##// when names were a treasure,\nstaking her claim as a figure of power she clutched her possession,\nhalting attempts to remove it until she was seen as an equal,\neven a threat, by the patron of titles, and barred from his kingdom.\n//##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Mischief##//, became forever unique. Thus\nunrecognizable to his domain. This failed to prevent her\nfinding a way inside. So, //##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Monsters,\nwhose jaw coils down to her legs##//, set out on a strange hunt.\nSeeking a crack left unchecked. She found one in the Hero,\nwhose sad thoughts are enough to control his surroundings until they\nbend to his will and attempt to repair what wrongs he has lived through.\nThe wise Hero knew half of the matter, his tears were a technique,\nsummoning such a monstrosity never was what he intended,\nbut he knew that his sadness caused a solution to answer.\nThus, to the stranger he spoke:\n\n\"Specter of one face, speak, and address what aid you may grant me.\nI know not what legends you hail from, but I beseech you, take\npity on this poor soul and his humble predicament. I am\nno king, prince, nor even a man. I am but a dismayed boy.\nseeking assistance to wed such a splendid Girl as this one,\nbut her Father refuses her hand. Sway, smite, or supplant him\nso that I may care for her often and sing to you praises\nfrom our happy abode so much that the city repeats it.\"\n\nThese words carefully chosen, the Hero concluded and then lied\nhis strong body against stones laid by his feet so his senses,\nvision and texture and body and mind, could leave his awareness.\nThose thoughts flew from the Hero and entered the mind of the stranger,\n//##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Malady##//, planting their roots in the closed ears\nthat so often are peeled to entrap sounds, words, and emotions,\nonly to seal tight so they can no longer escape. Then,\ncontemplating the meaning and repercussions of each one.\nShe stood, silent, gazing upon this form of the Hero.\n**##DA9100|Each word used to describe him attempted to strengthen his visage##**.\nThen, her appearance adjusted itself so a smile along the\nstretch of her mouth would form. She concluded the Hero was named right.\nThus, she bestowed him her favor.\n\n**##DA9100|With these forces of nature assembled together, the world\nsaw no choice but to yield and provide for the Hero a window,\nlike a paternal decision to give to their son the potential\nchance of a failure. This judgement was made unbeknownst to\nsouls of the world and kept that way to avoid a deception.\nAs fate's pen can be swayed by a crafty conspirator's cunning.\nDestiny hid its involvement by masking its actions as free will,\njust as it always attempts to.##**\n\nThe next fortunate day, an announcement came from the father.\nThat past night, in his dream he observed what he feared was the future,\nhis own self, but alone, no one to protect him and no one\nguarding his daughter. This dream felt so real that he lost his\nsenses and swiftly contracted a mania once he awakened.\nSuch an insanity sent this announcement to all of the city:\n\"Long have you lingered and waited for glimpses upon steps.\nI have forced you away in the past, but I find that I must now\nturn and embrace your attempts to embrace me and my daughter,\njoining the household that bears the crown. While my reception\nused to be cold, I now must thaw my icy demeanor.\nNo good thing will appear if I fail to allow it to hurt me,\nmedals are not won without risk, and rewards are not given\nout but to those who are willing to suffer. So, I proclaim this\nout to the world to send me the best that you have and to let them\ntry to impress me to win a betrothal to her, my beloved\ndaughter whose beauty can bend lands, oceans, and heavens alike, yes,\nshown by the crowds by my door, but among those suitors there must\nbe one worthier than the remainder who truly deserves my affection.\nCome all. Prove your merit until none raise an objection.\nCome if you think it is your fate.\"\n\nSuitors arrived by the score. Not unlike a migration flock\nflying to southern oases in winter to drink of the nectar\nand to consume the botanical wonders they are to but dream\ntheir mouths will touch during the summer and spring. Then, in colder\nmonths, when all life finds no food, their desperate attempts are\nin good company. They and the father are hungry for kin.\nThey, for a family they can protect, and the father for children\nthat can protect him. Now, as the hordes are approaching he feels pride.\nStanding above his paternal domain, eyes glancing between eyes\nwatching for signs of success or of failure before the beginning \neven arrives. That one stands poorly and pitifully, that one\nspeaks too loudly to neighbors and friends, that one and that one.\nMiserly, every contender appeared to him sad and pathetic.\nHe, as a beggar and chooser combined saw champions as fools.\nNone more so than the Hero, the worthiest challenger, whose worth\nseemed to the father the worst of the lot. None even compared in\nvalue to what was imagined inside of his mind, so he only\nsaw the reverse of the truth. Those close to his vision were horrid\nsince they reminded him what his desire was truly, and furthest\nones were the only he trusted. The Hero, by such an imperfect\nparadigm, was the worst.\n\nEven the father though could not send them away without reason.\n\"On to the first of the trials\" declared the paternal announcement.\nSwifter the start then the swifter the end, in his head, so the less time\nspent with explaining the task to the fools he already discounted\nbased on their merit, the better, he thought. Thus, this he declared once:\n\"Show me strength. Face one foe. Take from them a concession.\"\nSilence rang through crowded courtyards when the assembly\nknew what was meant. Each came here prepared for a battle\nbut most ones had expected a battle of words where displays of\nconfidence triumphed atop the displays of their worth and their lies reigned.\nBut, as the strict judge viewed their attempts with wisdom and cunning,\nknowing the cowards who filled these grounds he proclaimed this to scare them.\nHe wished not for a drop to appear as a stain on his soil.\nThough, when he carelessly spoke, his intentions failed to be made clear,\nso did it go, as the words left him, the malicious and desperate \nsought out who in the crowd was the easiest person to target.\nTheir eyes held no merciful shreds of humanity. They were\nmonsters shaped to their pinnacle.\n\nLike hunting hounds placed in a kennel upon their return home\nafter their chase of a frightened quarry who barely evaded\nthem and their fangs. The hunger they feel slaughters their patience\nso they snap and they bite at the dogs that stand in between their\njaws and the meat that the hunter propels to the crowd of the cruel curs.\nThis is the force that surrounded the Hero who seemed, in the cunning\nvision of these beasts, merely a farm boy, thus a delicious\nmorsel of prey. Waves folded in themselves vying to strike him.\nQuickly the Hero deduced who led the attack by the eyes of\n//##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Mystery, outcast who from above sees\nall##//. That person he saw was wielding a blade that he feared could,\njust as he feared that the bearer would choose to, kill, and their hand would\nnot back down. So, then did the Hero decide that he could not\nface this person in bloody assault. **##DA9100|As a seafarer scribes maps,\nnaming and claiming the lands that belong to the sun up above, and\nthen as the voyager takes those lands as they hammer a flag, and\njust as the long forgotten and buried lord had procured all,\nnot by his birth or his strength, but by his commanding demeanor,\nin this way by the Hero's imposing will he acquired\nthat blade##**, dreaded before, it became hallowed by his action.\nHe chose not to respond to his foe likewise, and instead bowed,\n//##purple|no true Hero attacks those not in control of their actions.##//\nThis old, unknown kindness showed that the Hero deserved this,\ncausing the cad to concede to him.\n\nThen, as the Father observed what only is said to be chaos,\n//##purple|his heart started to feel for the plight of the suitors and speak out##//\n**##DA9100|but some force chilled him and refused to allow him to show love,##**\nmaking him just the opponent the Hero desired to conquer.\nThe first task was complete, for the Hero at least, and he felt proud,\nbut as the rage of the Father accrued, he chose to proclaim forth\nnew rules. The bold strength, he presumed, could not be of purpose\nwhen this Hero was tested on wit. So he spoke to the suitors:\n\"Cease this nonsense. You are worthless brutes even when at your\nbest. I will weed out which of the crowd can face the conflictions\nthat will arise as you live in the world of class that the marriage\nsought will entail. I have faced the destruction of things that I held dear.\nHere I refuse to lose what above all else is important,\nmy young one, to fools that lack wisdom in its best form.\"\nSilence spread as the Hero and others awaited with ears peeled.\n\"My crown, passed from the one who rose the community lives safe\nin this home. Now, enter and grasp it to prove you have cunning,\nor turn back now in shame.\"\n\nFear spread through men, women, and others amassed to the contest.\nThey all knew what the house hid, ancient assortments of risen\nthreats, remnants of the lost and forgotten progenitor. All feared\nthis force. All with exception of one. A fool in a manner,\nbrave in another, the Hero, a foreign traveller, knew not\nwhat others feared, as he never was audience to what the folklore\nsaid. Oblivious, he ran with no pause at a bolt's pace\ninto the door and across the demesne as the innocent threshold\nmade him believe that no names lurked in the shadows around him.\nStrangely correct, as by rot and decay, they lost their descriptors,\nbut whatever remained did so a definitive disgrace\nboth to itself and the one it came from. Only defined by\nwhat, where, when. How, why, and especially who were disposed of\nages before the intrusion today. That Hero, who now saw\nwhat the competitors feared, stood firm as the something or other\ngathered around to consume all that they lacked. But the Hero,\nwith the grace of a butcher's knife that slices between bone,\ngristle, and viscera with ease, cut each threat with the chartered\nsword and acquired the crown. **##DA9100|This symbol of power perplexed\nhim. What use is a tool kept secret away from me? Thought the\nHero, expected to hand back what he had rightfully deserved.##**\n//##purple|simply complied, as is proper.##//\n\nHaving defeated the first two trials the Hero proclaimed his\ntriumph. The father, however, objected on steadily less ground.\nNo test could stand up to the Hero who vanquishes dissent\nas to his right to the hand of the Girl despite his ignoble\nbirth. //##purple|But something spoke to the Father in waking and slumber,\nsaying to doubt this man's motives, but he failed to discern why.##//\nHe took time, with the rest of the suitors disposed and bereft. Still\neven in speaking directly and testing the Hero again he\ncould not shake what he feared would occur if he granted his blessing.\nBut then, //##purple|Mildiga, Matron of Mystique, she who belongs not\nwhere she prospers##// arrived as discretely as possible to speak\nwords in the ear of the Father to guide his hand as he gives his\nverdict. Through him she says that the decision is best left\ngranted to who it affects most, thus an additional trial\nwas called, not for the Father to judge, but instead for the Girl.\nSo she requested an ordeal proving his honesty. He must\nsimply address her to firmly and truthfully give her the reason\nthat he thinks he is worthy.\n\n\"Dearest one, not only of me, but of cities and kingdoms,\"\nstarted the Hero's address, \"you are your Father's beloved\ndaughter, manifestation of that which existed before him,\nruler of what comes after, and greatest of all, the epitome,\nbeyond what most dream of and whisper about to the night sky\nwhen they rise from sleep to the cruel revelation that they dreamt.\nI am the one who has travelled for leagues for a chance to address you.\nI come not from a proud life, though it has given me much pride,\nnor was my life full of great strength, though I have ended it stronger.\nCurrently, there is a place in my heart where I live a deceased boy,\nthere is another where what I am seeking will never be my own.\nI am those fears. I am also the one who will break them.\nGive me your hand, let us unite. I, the protector,\nyou, the embodied compassion of ages eternally lacking\nteaching your knowledge and giving your treasures to all who surround you.\nI ask only to aid you in this perfected desire\nwith my perfect destiny. Speak to yourself and your Father,\nlook at my language and talk to my triumphs. They will convince you.\nIf this is done, I already have given my effort by taking\nthis long journey to your land, now I will give more.\nI give you my boots and the thousands of journeys to walk next,\nI give you my sword and the fights I will leave as a victor,\nI give you my words and the essence of my self,\nand ask only for your love.\"\n\nThese words carefully chosen, the Hero concluded and then lied\nprostrate, his plea made, and the Girl consulted her feelings.\n**##DA9100|By what means could she say no to the offer he gave her?##**\nThis boy, chosen by fate and the world itself had arrived here.\n**##DA9100|By what means could she say no to the offer he gave her?##**\nShe called out for a force to respond with an answer to her plea.\n**##DA9100|By what means could she say no to the offer he gave her?##**\n//##purple|No words came back. There was no way out of this ending.##//\nSo she accepted the offer.\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
