This report should explain your conjecture, as well as any initial research or reasoning that should support your theory.##\n\n##c55100 |Below is the abstract from Dr. Teller's first technical report on SCP-7100:##\n\n\n> __Reaching the End of a Rainbow: A Theory on Optical Convergence.__ \n> \n> //Abstract://\n> \n> According to the laws of physics[[footnote]]##c55100|While our work does deal with the anomalous, phenomena that are innately connected to long-observed human experience are likely to have some level of consistence with scientific understanding.##[[/footnote]], rainbows are created by an optical illusion. Sunlight that passes through raindrops will refract. Different wavelengths of light will refract at different angles, which separates it into bands of color, which then refletc off of the raindrop's surface. The result is that, depending of the angle of the light relative to a viewer, the viewer will see a different band of light.\n> \n> Therefore, if we are to locate the end of a rainbow, we cannot rely on a non-stochastic model, since they are products of each individual's perception. In fact, by virtue of rainbows being in some ways unique to a viewer, yet a shared experience across multiple viewers of a non-physical event, it can almost be thought of as a mass hallucination. This means that its existence is entirely dependent on its observers. \n> \\\n[[include component:image-block-quoted name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Rainbow1.svg|caption=Waterdrop reflection diagram]]\n> \n> SCP-7100 instances are always observed near a reported \"end of a rainbow\", however not every rainbow is connected with a corresponding SCP-7100 observation. This could either mean that SCP-7100 occurrences are not as directly tied to rainbows as previously imagined, or that not every rainbow sufficiently fits the observation requirements for SCP-7100 instantiation. Therefore, I propose the following:\n> \n> * Rainbows exhibit a similar wave-particular duality as light itself: it does not have a single location until properly observed.\n> * Rainbows will converge to a single discrete location if a sufficiently large number of observers see the rainbow at approximately the same location\n> * Rainbows that do not converge will not trigger an SCP-7100 instance.\n> \n> This paper further describes a model I have implemented to determine the probability of rainbow convergence given the population density naer a given rain shower, as well as a method to mathematically determine the location of a rainbow's end should it converge.\n\n------\n\n**Weekly Mentor Check-in #1:**\n\n> **Mackey:** So, I read your paper. And just... damn, you work fast.\n> \n> **Teller:** I know it's a bit rushed. I realized after I submitted it I had a few typos in there.\n> \n> **Mackey:** It's fine. No one gives a shit about spelling on internal documents.\n> \n> **Teller:** Oh. Okay then.\n> \n> **Mackey:** There's been a good amount of rain forecast for the next few days. Any storms look promising?\n> \n> **Teller:** Well, even with our satellites the forecasts can be... iffy.\n> \n> **Mackey:** You're telling me. Somedays I feel like the clouds are just trying to look anomalous. \n> \n> **Teller:** But I think there's a shower tomorrow that should converge about sixty miles east of here. \n> \n> **Mackey:** Sounds ripe for a field trip!\n> \n> **Teller:** Heh, yeah. Yeah, it does. But I realize it's kind of short notice and, um... I've never gone through the process for commissioning a field mission before. Could you give me a hand with that?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Helping you through the bureaucracy is why I'm here. Do you have a team in mind?\n> \n> **Teller:** I don't know any of the MTF guys all that well... so I haven't asked them yet.\n> \n> **Mackey:** You don't need a whole MTF for this. Hell, you should probably be going out there!\n> \n> **Teller:** I can go?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Yeah. You should get some field experience, and it's never too soon to start. \n> \n> **Teller:** I— I would love to go. I've never gotten to go out in the field before...\n> \n> **Mackey:** And then, you know Casey?\n> \n> **Teller:** I don't think so.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Okay, first note for you— You need to work on your networking. I know you can get a bit in your notes about things, but sometimes you don't have all the talent you need.\n> \n> **Teller:** Right. Right. Meet more people. Got it.[[footnote]]##c55100|The Foundation supports numerous mixers, seminars, and other such activities to encourage cross-department connections.##[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Mackey:** Anyways, Casey does field work largely for Xingyu. Mission operations specialist type, you know? So I'll ask if she can take lead. And then she largely rides with Norm and Pablo so that makes four of you. You want to choose a fifth?\n> \n> **Teller:** That sounds good. Want to cover all my bases after all.\n> \n> **Mackey:** I'll let you make the call on that. Don't want to do too much for you.\n> \n> **Teller:** Actually— uh, I don't know if you're busy but... would you like to be the fifth?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Ok, so I know I just said I don't want to do too much for you... but I would love a reason to bail on my meeting with the director tomorrow. I'm in.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7100/offset/3 Next document]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
