  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nList of works found within [[[SCP-1326]]], listed under their corresponding index numbers. Index numbers are inputted by rotating the dials on SCP-1326's cover to the desired values, pressing down on the dials until they click to register the change in position, then inserting SCP-1326-1 into its keyhole and unlocking SCP-1326. The circular and hemispherical dials are numbered 1-360 and A-G, respectively, with each combination of number and letter corresponding to different content. Inserting multiple consecutive combinations of values has been found to yield different results than those yielded by the individual combinations, and inputted values will continue to \"stack\" until SCP-1326 is opened. Due to the mass quantities of potential combinations, this document is considered incomplete and will be updated as new combinations are tested and their results recorded.\n\nPlease use the following format in this log.\n\n**Index #:** \n**Contents:** \n**Notes:** \n\n\n**Index #:** 36-A\n**Contents:** English translation of //Art of War//, by Sun Tzu.\n**Notes:** Translation was accurate and appeared to be formatted for casual reading.\n\n**Index #:** 12-D\n**Contents:** //Zoologist's Guide to the Care and Feeding of Sea Scorpions// (author unknown).\n**Notes:** Illustrated text explaining how to properly raise Eurypterids (an extinct arthropod) in captivity, written from the standpoint of one experienced with their care.
