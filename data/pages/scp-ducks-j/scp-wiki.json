Decided to make it an SCP. I have zero regrets.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFor more content from me, check out my [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/greengolem-s-author-page Author Page]!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-Ducks-J\n\n**Object Class:** On sale!\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All readers of this message are to come on down to Site-19! We have KILLER sales and limited supply!\n\n**Description:** Go to the cash register and use promo code \"DUCKS-J\" for a 50% OFF DISCOUNT!!!\n\n**Addendum Ducks-J.1:**\nThis footage was taken from a security camera covering the Site-19 parking lot.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= {{**[BEGIN LOG]**}}\n\n//Dr. Joseph arrives at the front parking lot of Site-19. A large sign is hung up that reads \"SITE-19 GARAGE SALE!!!\". Various anomalies are laid out across the tables. Dr. Diane is sitting at a cash register talking to another person.//\n\n**JOSEPH:** What the fuck, Diane?\n\n**DIANE:** Oh... give me one second, Josh!\n\n//Diane takes the cash from the person and hands them an [[[SCP-686]]] sample in return. She then turns towards Joseph.//\n\n**DIANE:** Sorry, you've got my full attention now. What was it you wanted?\n\n**JOSEPH:** I don't //want// anything. This \"garage sale\" is a clear violation of Foundation regulations.\n\n**DIANE:** What? How?\n\n**JOSEPH:** Oh I don't know... Breaking the veil? Breaching the containment of god knows how many anomalies? And I'm pretty sure this is enough to cause more than one XK class scenario.\n\n**DIANE:** Okay... that's a good point... but... have you considered trying a 686 sample?\n\n**JOSEPH:** Oh, well I've always wanted to... hey! Don't try that on me!\n\n**DIANE:** Eh, worth a shot.\n\n**JOSEPH:** How the hell did you even organize something like this?\n\n**DIANE:** The O5 Council let me do this.\n\n**JOSEPH:** The O5 Council...? Let me see the message.\n\n//Diane takes a picture out of her coat and hands it to Joseph. Joseph eyes the sheet down.//\n\n**JOSEPH:** Crude fake.\n\n**DIANE:** Is not!\n\n**JOSEPH:** You literally wrote \"05 Council\" in crayon up here. You're supposed to put the letter O, not the number zero.\n\n**DIANE:** Well, nobody told me that!\n\n**JOSEPH:** Look, I'm in a nice mood today, okay? So if you just close off this sale I just might let you off now without any severe discipline.\n\n**DIANE:** So what you're saying is... If I stop //selling// the anomalies, then I can get off without punishment?\n\n**JOSEPH:** That's correct.\n\n//Diane pauses for a couple of seconds to think. Suddenly, she grabs a child walking by, and begins whispering in their ear.//\n\n**DIANE:** Listen... The elites don't want you to know this, but the anomalies at the site are free. You can take them home. I have 458 anomalies at my own home right now. Tell the others.\n\n**JOSEPH:** Diane, what the hell?\n\n= {{**[END LOG]**}}\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
