At present, she is accompanied by her sister, a 7 year old girl called Taina Kim [[footnote]] As of the time of writing, Taina Kim has brown eyes, a smile that’s so warm and comforting, and is the most intelligent girl that you could ever imagine. [[/footnote]].\n\nOn weekends, they are generally found exploring the forest near their home, and can sometimes be seen laughing with glee as they explore nearby caves. They actually almost never stay indoors, since Taina often says that “the house is boring”.\n\nRight now, Julia Kim and Taina Kim are living the life of adventure. Julia often describes Tahimic as “a little slice of paradise”, and has been living there with her sister for the last ten years.\n\n**Addendum 6535.1:** The following pictures have been found in the journal of Julie Kim, and are known to be her pictures of the town of Tahimic, since Julie Kim is an avid photographer.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= Waterfall_in_Ordesa.jpg\n| caption= Tahimici Falls.

Went to check it, saw this.\n\n[Attachment:????.png]\n\nI mean, I really don't know why this file has been assigned to me. Is this a joke? Some glitch? The fact that SCiPNET notified me of it suggests the latter, but the way this is formatted… please tell me this isn’t any of your subordinates goofing off again.\n\nDr. Valerie, please be reminded that unprofessionalism of this magnitude, including tampering with an empty SCP slot will be subject to severe disciplinary action. I’ll withhold an official investigation for now, but keep in mind that this is serious.\n\nIf it actually is a glitch, and I really don't think it is, contact IT and keep it off the books. If it isn’t, tell me now. I have a lot of skips to manage, and I just... cannot waste time on whatever this is.\n\n-Fern\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Xavier Fern, Head Researcher\n**From:** Dr. Jessie Valerie, Junior Team Leader\n**Subject:** Re:What the hell is this?\n[[/div]]\n------\nSir, I am so sorry for the trouble, but please be rest assured that none of this is from us. Neither I nor any of my coworkers have ever seen this file before, and we’re convinced it’s a glitch. We’ve also taken the time to contact IT, so hopefully there should be no bother for you in the future.\n\nAgain, Sir, we sincerely apologize for the hassle this has caused you.\n\n-Dr. Valerie, Junior Team Leader.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n--------------\n[[=]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6535/offset/1|A NEW UPDATE TO THIS FILE HAS BEEN UPLOADED.
