You've spent the last several hours hiding in the broom closet with naught but the rank water of the mop-sink to sustain you. The chaos has long since died down. It's time to make a break for it. You slowly open the door.\n> \n> Lightning strikes, offering a brief reprieve from the sullen darkness of the Site's empty halls. Stepping cautiously over the body of Dr. Cawthrone, you do your best to remain silent. There's no way of knowing how it hunts. Best to take every precaution.\n> \n> \n> In the distance, a blood-curdling scream drowns out the rolling thunder. It is mercifully cut short; the steady thrum of raindrops once again takes prominence. At the very least, you're heading in the other direction, to the security office.\n> \n> Nichols is sprawled out backwards in his seat in front of the control center, gutted from throat to crotch, spilling viscera onto his lap that //drip, drip, drips// onto the linoleum.

Containment Liaisons are in the process of devising long-term containment solutions for SCP-3280.\n\nShould SCP-3280 reach the entrance to Sub-Level 2, the Site will enter a security lockdown, making entrance and egress impossible. Do note that this will also activate Blackout-Protocol: ensuring that no hazardous or sensitive information is broadcast from the Site. This will be necessary to prevent a full containment breach and failure of Third Mission (Protect) goals.\n\n**Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n> But of course. Despite the repeated assurances that your security upgrade was in the process of being implemented, you're still Level 0, and thus, effectively worthless as far as Overwatch is concerned.\n> \n> The file though. Was that image even right? You've glimpsed the file previously - surely it... no. No. That cannot be right. No time to be worried about something so inane, however. You need to get in. \n> \n> The faint //drip, drip, dripping// of Nichols reminds you of his presence. Gingerly, you finger about his body, feeling for his security lanyard in the dark. It's wedged beneath him, but you're able to slide it out and detach it from the loop. Thankfully, Nichols was the type of person to scrawl their password on the underside of their clearance card, as you discover upon turning it over in your hands. \n> \n> You approach the terminal with renewed vigor.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n{{WELCOME TO SCIPNET DATABASE}}\n\n{{Security Clearance Level 2 - Accepted}}\n\n{{Access Security Footage?}}\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n> This is definitely helpful.

Should twelv[[/span]]e hours pass without Overwatch receiving an \"All Clear\" from these teams, all Sites are to enact emergen[[span class=\"transparent\"]]cy measures in preparation for an imm[[/span]]inent XK-scenario.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3280 is a sapient entity composed of a fluid physically identical to water, capable of travelling ~2.5 km/h. Non-anomalous wa[[span class=\"translucent\"]]ter introduced to SCP-3280 will be incorporated into its mass, and remo[[/span]]ved samples prove to operate identically. At the time of its discovery, the entity was approx. 66.4 liters in volume; it is currently estimated to be ~2500 liters. \n\nThe entity is hostile to human life. SCP-3280 will seek out humans within its vicinity, forcing its mass into open orifices. SCP-3280 is also readily absorbed through the pores. The affected experience symptoms such as loss of motor control, weakening of the micturition reflex, visual hallucinations, and abdominal pain.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n> Almost as if on cue, you feel a churning in your own stomach.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #f8f8f8; padding: 4px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nSCP-[[span class=\"transparent\"]]3280 dis[[/span]]plays claustrophobic behavior, [[span class=\"translucent\"]]violently expelling itself from confined spaces or containers; such as vials or test subjects. SCP-3280 will constrict its mass, lashing out in pressurized bursts exceeding 255 MPa - rendering all attempts of physical containment or transportation impossible. Wh[[/span]]en not hunting living prey, SCP-3280 will attempt to exit the underground level it is currently contained within. [[span class=\"translucent\"]]Thus far, SCP-3280 has been kept away from the sub-level's entrance. It is believed[[/span]] that if SCP-3280 learns that it is sealed within the sub-level, it could instigate a violent response from the entity, irrevocably breaking containment. SCP-3280's escape from the site proper would constitute an XK-cla[[span class=\"transparent\"]]ss end of the world scen[[/span]]ario, once it becomes incorporated into the planet's water cycle.

You drunkenly stumble, struggling against the thing inside of you, out into the hallway. The storm outside rages. Torrents of raindrops spatter across the windows.
