Really this page only exists because I miscounted the number of pages I’d need and I didn’t feel like re-numbering them. The only way you could’ve found this page would be to have input the url for the 16th offset page manually into your browser, which means you either:\n\nA. Found every offset page and noticed number 16 was missing, or\nB. Went through all the offset pages in order to find all 7 endings like a dirty cheater.\n\nWell, either way, you showed some smarts, so I guess I’ll reward you. Here, have a flow chart of all the possible paths:\n\n[[image DEADEND%20%282%29.png]]\n\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[div style=\"color: transparent;\"]]\n\nActually, there's one ending that shown on here because I added it after making this flow chart. But that's for me to know and you to find out!\n\n[[/div]]\n _\n\n\n||~ This is a ||~ table ||\n||I did not know know || how to make these ||\n||||already ||",
