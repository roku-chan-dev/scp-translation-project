If a listing is found, efforts are to be made to remove it. Purchasing the copy is the preferred option, though taking down the listing is a valid alternative.\n\nIn the event that a copy of SCP-8686 is purchased, MTF Upsilon-33 (\"Rushing Critics\"), is to obtain the SCP-8686 instance, and administer B-Class amnestics to the exposed individuals. Agents are to maintain the belief that SCP-8686 is no more than a memory of an existing play, as established by the memetic properties of the anomaly. [[footnote]] Agare class anomalies are perceived as fictional works, where containment is focused on maintaining that belief. In this case, containment relies on the belief that this anomaly is a memory of a real, fictional play. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-8686 is an anomalous theatre experience known as \"The Best Days Of Our Lives\". SCP-8686 is attributed to \"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8478 Pseudogenesis Productions]\", alternatively known as GOI-478. The first page contains information on those involved in the production of SCP-8686. [[footnote]]Stephanie Pseudo (POI-478-1) is credited as Writer and Director. Solomon Baer (POI-478-2) is credited as Stage Manager and Light Technician. Duplo (POI-478-3) is credited as Set Designer. Vivienne Chen (POI-478-4) is credited as Memetic and Cognitohazard creator. [[/footnote]] Instances will appear on various auction websites, including eBay, Etsy, and Craigslist, priced five to ten dollars.\n\nThe cover contains a memetic effect, compelling someone to open the playbill, but opening it will invariably cause the subject to be affected by more of SCP-8686's memetics and cognitohazardous effects. The various memetics that make up SCP-8686 seem to be able to exert power on the environment around the subject for the duration of the performance, manifesting furniture and entities collectively known as SCP-8686-A.\n\nSCP-8686's story is in three acts, each corresponding to a unique heuristic[[footnote]] An effect of self-realization through a cognitohazard. [[/footnote]] effect in the subject. Amnestic testing has shown that the show cannot be removed from the memory of any subjects.\n\n* The first act elicits euphoric emotions towards the SCP-8686-A instance representing the viewer's romantic partner within SCP-8686.\n* The second act induces paranoia in the viewer, specifically regarding perceived potential flaws or character faults. The viewer is inevitably unable to determine the root cause of their conflict.\n* The third act forces the viewer to confront their flaws, resulting in a major conflict between the viewer and the SCP-8686-A instance representing their partner. This conflict inevitably leads to a moment of self-realization.\n\nAn SCP-8686 performance will always follow the same act structure, and is always set within the same location, a cottage home. While the narrative varies between instances, the subject is never able to leave the set.\n\nAn image of an SCP-8686 listing is included below for reference.\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]][[collapsible show=\"Cognitohazard Present\" hide=\"Hide\" style=\"font-size:2vw;\"]][[/size]]\n[[div class=\"pseudo-div\"]]\n[[=image Pseudogenesis_Logo_Flatter.png style=\"max-width:70%;\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-size:5.5vw; line-height: 1;\"]] Best Days Of Our Lives [[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[span style=\"font-size:1.8em;\"]] It's a story told time after time.

The show was recorded as to understand the true nature of SCP-8686 performances. Only portions of the recording were recoverable, separated by glitches. It is believed a portion of each act was captured.\n\n------\n\n(//The environment begins to shift into the cottage set of SCP-8686 as Act One opens. D-2231 is standing in the front door, holding a bag of groceries.//)\n\n**D-2231:** Woah-- Oh. Did I go to the store?\n\n(//D-2231 walks through the halls, before coming face to face with an instance of SCP-8686-A. D-2231 shifts awkwardly.//)\n\n**D-2231:** ... Carol? They took you in too?\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Dear, are you feeling alright? Oh, you got the groceries! Did you make sure to pick up some eggs? We're out.\n\n**D-2231:** I--\n\n(//D-2231 looks at the bag, nodding to SCP-8686-A.//)\n\n**D-2231:** Yeah. It looks like I did.\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Are you hungry, then? I could go for an omelet, and I know how much you like them.\n\n(//D-2231 pauses for a moment, staring at the instance of SCP-8686-A. There is a pause, before tears can be seen in the footage.//)\n\n**D-2231:** I missed you. So much.\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** It's okay now. It's okay.\n\n**D-2231:** You said you would never leave me, and here we are.\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** I remember when I said that. You came home and I was drunk on the couch.\n\n(//D-2231 chuckles and gets closer to SCP-8686-A, hugging it.//)\n\n**D-2231:** I missed you. So much, Carol.\n\n(//D-2231's chuckles turn slowly into sobs, hugging the instance closer.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** I missed you too, Ash.\n\n(//D-2231 looks down at SCP-8686-A while in an embrace, tears flowing. SCP-8686-A wipes away some of her tears, smiling warmly.//)\n\n**D-2231:** I couldn't ask for anyone better.\n\n(//They kiss.//)\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image Vhs_Glitch-cropped-flipped.gif style=\"width:50em; height: 4em; overflow: hidden; object-fit: cover; padding:0;\"]]\n[[div class=\"log_text\"]]\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** You said you wouldn't do that anymore.\n\n(//D-2231 takes a sip from a green glass bottle.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Seriously? I quit. I quit drinking for you.\n\n**D-2231:** Let's just enjoy the moment. Want a sip?\n\n(//SCP-8686-A makes a disgusted face at D-2231.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** You'd better be wasted.\n\n**D-2231:** I actually think I'm rather insightful. Are you sure?\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Ash. I've been sober for five months now. Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n(//SCP-8686-A clenches its jaw, brushing its hair to the side and glaring at D-2231.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** I'm going to get some fresh air. Feel free to join me when you're //thinking// again.\n\n**D-2231:** Carol, I don't see the problem. I'm not a drunkard like you were--\n\n(//SCP-8686-A glares at D-2231 as tears form.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Every day, you made me feel bad for drinking. It was a fucking problem, yes, I needed help, but you didn't have to say what you did. You told me I was going to die from it, that I was gonna end up in a fucking gutter.\n\n(//SCP-8686-A's lip quivers as they begin to cry.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** Why in Hell would you say that to me, and why in the love of Christ would you keep drinking-- No, why are you //still// drinking?\n\n**D-2231:** Carol, sweetheart, you just don't get--\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** No, don't try to talk your way out of this.\n\n(//D-2231 visibly sinks lower into her chair, taking a sip from her drink.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** And put down the bottle. I just want you to practice what you preach. Please.\n\n**D-2231:** Okay. Okay, I promise that I'll quit. I'm sorry. I love you, and I'm going to go sleep off my drinks.\n\n(//SCP-8686-A nods, as D-2231 stands up and the scene shifts into a bedroom.//)\n\n(//D-2231 takes a flask, frowning as she downs the contents. Her body trembles.//)\n\n**D-2231:** Last one... Last one. I promise.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image Vhs_Glitch-cropped-flipped.gif style=\"width:50em; height: 4em; overflow: hidden; object-fit: cover; padding:0;\"]]\n[[div class=\"log_text\"]]\n\n(//D-2231 looks to the front door, where SCP-8686-A stands. She has tear-stained eyes and is shaking.//)\n\n**D-2231:** I'm sorry, I don't want you to leave-- please darling, come back.\n\n(//SCP-8686-A looks back, sniffling as tears flow from its eyes.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** I feel like I don't even know you. You won't quit. You won't go to rehab. You won't go to therapy. It's like you don't even want to change.\n\n**D-2231:** I love you though, so much, more than anything else in this stupid small world. Please. Don't leave me alone. I don't want to be alone, you're the only thing that keeps going.\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** I can't do this anymore. You're hurting yourself with your addiction, and then you turn around and hurt me. You--\n\n(//SCP-8686-A's voice trembles, choking up.//)\n\n**SCP-8686-A:** You can say you love me all you want, but every time I see you drink it reminds me of a past I had to crawl out of alone. And you have the gall to throw that back at me, after //everything// you know I've been through? I'm done.\n\n**D-2231:** Carol, honey--\n\n(//SCP-8686-A walks out of the cottage, slamming the door shut.//)\n\n(//D-2231 sits in the house, making her way onto the couch.//)\n\n(//She curls up into a ball, covering herself in a blanket and mumbling nothings to herself to try and calm down. The only remaining noises in the recording are D-2231's sobs, and the dull buzz of the stage lights. After ten minutes of crying, she falls asleep.//)\n\n(//The show ends.//)\n \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter the experiment, D-2231 requested Foundation psychiatric services to aid her in mitigating her alcoholism. The request was granted, and D-2231 showed exceptional progress in her recovery.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to identify SCP-8686-A from D-2231's recorded performance. Despite D-2231's insistence, they have never been in a relationship or married to any individuals named 'Carol'. As such, SCP-8686-A's existence as a real individual is pending further investigation.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[SCP-8685]]] | SCP-8686 | [[[SCP-8687]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Agare-class.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Queerious]]\n> **License:** cc-by-sa 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** Pseudogenesis_Logo_Flatter.png\n> **Name:** Psuedogenesis Logo\n> **Author:** [[*user Queerious]]\n> **License:** cc-by-sa 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** Vhs_Glitch-cropped-flipped.gif\n> **Name:** Language of fourier strings.\n> **Author:** Roͬͬ͠͠͡͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠sͬͬ͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠aͬͬ͠͠͠͠͠͠͠ Menkman\n> **License:** cc-by 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/r00s/6974122193/\n> **Notes:** Image was cropped and edited by me, [[*user Queerious]]\n=====\n> **NOTE:** Pseudogenesis Productions from [[SCP-8478]] and [[SCP-8740]] by [[*user Queerious]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
