Where are Xettle and Stormbreath? This is their presentation, after all.\n\n**Dr. Clank:** Xettle? That gorgeous hunk of mutton should be here any moment.\n\n**P6-3:** You don't keep the Panopticator Directorate waiting! He should know that by now!\n\n**13:20:00:** //Djoric Stormbreath lands her Hypercat, sheathing her katanas as she does so. Dr. Xettle steps down from the Hypercat's talons, clutching tightly to lab equipment.//\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** Sorry we're late, fellow scientists; Jordan C. Gordon's friend Gordon C. Jordan- whose voice sounds surprisingly close to that of Dr. Xettle attempting a bad French accent- waylaid us, trying to steal our evidence.\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** ...Yes. How... unfortunate. I, Dr. Xettle, in a way completely in character, was appalled by Gordon's actions. And I thought that accent was pretty convincing... \n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** Ladies and gentlemen of Panopticon, our reality is nothing but a tabletop role-playing game in the mind of an idiot and a genius.\n\n**P6-2:** Can you show us evidence that we're in such a fantasy as you describe?\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** Of- of course.\n\n**13:25:** //Dr. Xettle wheels in a cart containing a live fulvous whistling-duck, a graduated cylinder of green oil, a pipette, and a clear rectangular container divided into twenty-nine vertical sections.//\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** Watch carefully.\n\n**13:25-13:27:** //Dr. Xettle drops one droplet of oil at a time onto the back of the duck; these droplets fall into each of the twenty-nine rectangular sections. Soon, a curve forms, as some sections fill up more quickly than others.//\n\n**P6-2:** What is the significance of this display?\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** This is the standard method of determining the accuracy of a ranged attack in the rules of TDQ-XXXY. As you see, repetition over time creates this probability curve. Now, if one or more of you would take this blindfold...\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** Although we completely understand if none of you want to submit to such an indignity...\n\n**P6-4:** No, I'll do it.\n\n**Dr. Xettle:**... Great. Just great. Exactly what I wanted to hear.\n\n**13:28:** //Dr. Djoric Stormbreath proceeds to blindfold P6-4, and has him throw a large quantity of darts at a target. There is a laser sensor array indicating how close each one comes to the center of the target, and plotting the frequency of each value on a histogram. Rather than a continuous spectrum, there are only twenty-nine discrete values.//\n\n**P6-13:** It's the exact same curve as the duck method made!\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** Precisely. \n\n**P6-12:** And this coincidence of probability is how you know we're in a sort of analog simulation?\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** Not only that.\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** One would imagine that every duck in existence has a slightly different body shape and mannerisms.\n\n**P6-13:** Naturally.\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** Then would it surprise you to learn that as of the end of today's testing of a sample of forty-three ducks, //each one produces the same curve?//\n\n**Millihammer:** Meaning what?\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** Ladies and gentlemen, all ducks seem like individual ducks, because the masters of reality can describe one as different compared to one another.\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** But whoever they are, they can't describe with their words what a random result looks like. They have to run the duck test each time we do. //And they only have one duck.//\n\n**Dr. Millihammer:** But if we're saying this is a tabletop role-playing game, they don't need to do the test every single time, do they? That would get really boring. They can just say, \"Oh, this one's curve is slightly higher than that one and has slightly more bumps on the left side than on the right\", and we, in-universe, won't know the difference.\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** Yes, that's how yesterday's tests went. All the curves were slightly different. I thought about calling the whole thing off...\n\n**Dr. Djoric Stormbreath:** But that urge was completely against his character. //Any strenuous decision will prove that, Dr. Xettle.// So we changed the approach of the experimental setup today.\n\n**Dr. Millihammer:** How?\n\n**Dr. Xettle:** I...

A little girl keeps getting killed at this site, and it's all my fault.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** So what do you want from me?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I don't know.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** She said once that it's better to have an enemy with you if you're trapped in an infinite void, because an enemy helps you define yourself. I don't even have //myself// in the void.

The characters of Dr. Xettle and Dr. Stormbreath try to make preparations to ascend; however, they are obstructed from doing so by having to react to the actions of the remaining thirty-seven player characters, each of which has a separate agenda and //modus operandi//.\n\n**10/20/2012:** Twelve test personnel unite in a common goal and have their player characters go on a mission to steal the rights of the names from popular franchise //The Mord of the Sings// from the current holders, Uolkein Fnterprises, so that they can finally use the words \"Iobbit\", \"Fnt\", and \"Calrog\".\n\n**11/30/2012:** Dr. Xettle's efforts, far too distracted to complete his own ascension, manifest in his own player character, Dr. Yilliam Y. Yettle, ascending to his plane. Dr. Yettle is immediately promoted to Panopticon Directorate status. Dr. Xettle plans to try again with Dr. Zettle, now ascended to Dr. Yettle's former narrative plane.\n\n**01/30/2013:** In spite of Dr. Wettle's prediction, Dr. Xettle and Dr. Djoric Stormbreath, having been repeatedly waylaid, arrested, lost, transmogrified, and mailed to the Zukon of Danada, have been far too busy to complete the ascension process.\n\n**01/30/2013:** SCP-7132 has been enjoying the story for months, and has undergone her PHOENIX events without incident regularly.\n\n= Researcher's note:\n= //Thanks, everyone! - Dr. Wettle//\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n@@  @@\n\n-------\n\n**Addendum 8132-16: Excerpt from SCP-8132, pg. 3.141592653589793**\n\n[[=]]\n> **On Transitioning From the Basic Ruleset To the Advanced Ruleset** \n> \n> Let's drop the pretense for a moment.\n> \n> Nobody //needs// this ruleset. If you want to tell stories with your friends, you can go and tell stories with your friends without paying us a penny. \n> \n> All we are is the cardboard that makes up your rocket ship. We provide the stiffness so you can cut us up with scissors to form cones, fins, and windows. You don't need us to have fun.\n> \n> But at the same time, you need us very much.\n> \n> You need an //excuse// to exercise your imagination with your friends. You need some way of making sure that you're all prim and respectable to the outside world. You aren't a child anymore; your playtime must have rigorous rules. You need to feel like you're taking a gamble when your characters' actions fail, rather than failing when you feel it makes sense in the story. If you choose when your character fails, after all, aren't you a born loser? And when your character succeeds all the time, aren't they a Mary Sue?\n> \n> So we will be your excuse and your crutch. We have rules for every situation, should you begin to worry that this is all so childish. If you desire it, we have rules so dense so that a character cannot sneeze without having to make some sort of gamble. And you will feel that that sneeze is inherently better than if you had done it independently; this sneeze was in accordance with the //rules.//\n> \n> But there is a price, as with all crutches.\n> \n> The price of basing your ideas off of our rules is that your ideas are based off of our rules.\n> \n> And therefore, we own them.\n> \n> Every gamble you make based on our ruleset is marked in a dusty ledger. Every roleplay, we log.\n> \n> And as you have made our rules come to life, we live a little through you every session.\n> \n> Don't look behind you, you won't see anyone.\n> \n> You are completely and utterly alone in this room.\n> \n> Isn't that right, Dr. Wettle?\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n-------\n**Addendum 8132-17:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n= **DATE:** 02/10/2013\n----\n\n= [BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Okay.

Even if nobody narrates us, we're all narrating ourselves. We have to have a coherent self-image, and we tell ourselves our own story every day.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm in a story with a brilliant cast, full of people who love and respect me.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Well...
