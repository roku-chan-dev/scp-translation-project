Each discovered version and copy should be immediately recovered, catalogued, and contained at the Secluded Site Ilahimm.\n\nIf it's impossible to recover the subject, the team members are obliged to destroy it or effectively damage its content. If they can't do so, because of unforeseen reasons, the object should be destroyed by a drone or by the Special Elimination Force \"Baal Hadad\".\n\nAfter each operation, members of the recovery teams should undergo targeted memory erasure to permanently remove any memories of the -gamma copy targeted by the operation.\n\nOnce any GoI or PoI comes into possession of a copy of SCP-7312-γ, an attempt is to be made immediately to seize it discreetly – and if the subjects make it difficult to do so, all means and methods are permitted.\n\nIf such GoI or PoI intends to perform a ritual, whether aware of its possibilities or not, upon discovery of this copy of SCP-7312-γ in its possession, most optimal steps should be taken without any delay, to recover or destroy the copies and to remove the witnesses' memories of the existence and content of the ritual, or terminate them if necessary.\n\nIf the ritual has not been prevented and SCP-7312 has occurred, the Foundation is urgently required to take appropriate steps to identify SCP-7312 features and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of humanity and as much of the Earth and its life as possible. At the same time, Secluded Site Ilahimm is actively observing the possible emergence of rapid narrative deviations, indicating the emergence of a local gamma narrative dimension that would indicate the possibility of SCP-7312 occurring without the Foundation noticing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7312 is an event that may occur as a result of performing one of the versions of SCP-7312-γ — the gamma ritual. According to information received from the Foundation from TL-7312-00 via RCT-Δt, the -gamma ritual was to be performed on May 18, 2020, in a prayer square in the suburbs of Częstochowa, Poland.\n\nAs a result of this event, a certain memeplex — referred to by TL-7312-00 as SCP-7312-α — was to be completely obliterated from the local Infosphere, and objects associated with the memeplex on a conceptual level were said to be completely distorted and acquire anomalous properties. Other noticeable effects of the incident were the damage of alpha-related historical knowledge, the disappearance of all traces of the version of the -gamma ritual used, and the death of all direct witnesses, as well as the destruction/malfunction or death of various anomalies and devices around the world — except for SCP-3812, which had signs of being used by SCP-7312-γ, but showed no other deviation from its form.\n\nAccording to TL-7312-00 data, the annihilation of SCP-7312-α from the local Infosphere also created a memetic vacuum — a puzzling thing that had not even been hypothesized before. This vacuum was to be noticeable throughout the local universe structure of their Timeline, drawing the unwanted attention of extrasolar entities to Earth.\n\nThe investigation was able to stop the occurrence of the event in the baseline reality and secure a copy of the -gamma ritual. It was established that the ritual was to be used by a group of Catholic believers as a prayer to stop insulting Pope John Paul II by various individuals and organizations, and for their conversion. This indicates that -alpha was the aggregate of the whole concept of Karol J. Wojtyła — the 264. The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, known as John Paul II.\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Ritratto_di_papa_Giovanni_Paolo_II_%281984_%E2%80%93_edited%29.jpg|caption=John Paul II (05/18/1920 – 04/02/2005), the Bishop of Rome in years 1978 — 2005. The picture taken in 1984.|width=300px]]\n\nAnalysis of SCP-7312-γ indicated that, despite its form of Christian prayer, it was a non-magical, non-religious, non-ontokinetic and non-narrative ritual capable of changing local reality. It is not known what aspect of reality it utilizes. Any research carried out with the available methods could not indicate the existence in the multiverse of any force with which the ritual was connected.\n\nHistorical data, however, showed that this ritual did not originally take this form. According to the notes of a certain Master Omnicarp, who is most likely the creator of the mentioned version, he only derived \"the meaning of power from the legacy of one of many.” Further investigation revealed that there are indeed multiple versions of SCP-7312-γ, always extremely different from each other but associated with the same undefined force.\n\nThe method used to copy the \"meaning\" and create a completely new version of the ritual is currently unknown.\n\nThe overall situation makes this ritual an object of extremely high risk, due to the possible threat of using its unknown-to-Foundation copy by some institution or person, the consequences of which are impossible to predict.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]Interrogation Log[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** May 18, 2020; 8:02 PM — 8:18 PM\n\n**Interrogator:** Dr Agata E. Lewald\n\n**Interrogated:** Dr Wojsław Goszkowski\n– historian that discovered first known to Foundation SCP-7312-γ copy.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**Location:**\nSecluded Site Ilahimm\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n\n//A faint click is heard and the noise of construction machinery begins to spread. A middle-aged person with short, neck-length blonde hair enters the room. Carries a binder and a stack of documents. Wears a grey t-shirt and loose-fitting jeans. After a while, the rumour disappears, accompanied by the slam of the door. The figure approaches the table where a handcuffed, grey-haired elderly man in a brown jacket is sitting.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** Good evening, Dr. Goszkowski, sorry for the noise, the Site is still under construction... Also, please forgive the handcuffs, for safety reasons.\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** Can you at least tell me why some commandos broke into my apartment and arrested me? It is outrageous and against the law to break into someone's apartment and treat innocent people so badly.\n\n//During Dr. Goszkowski's speech, Dr. Lewald almost imperceptibly shook their head.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** Please forgive me, but it is not for me to judge someone's guilt or lack of it. Both me and the commandos you mentioned deal with something other than the civil criminal system. It was unfortunate for you that you just came into possession of the object of our interest. An item that additionally posed some risk.\n\n//Goszkowski seems concerned and indignant.//\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** I don't understand, you're not from the police? Is this a kidnapping? Is it some… conspiracy of liberals and leftists against me?\n\n//Dr. Lewald replies with a slightly amused voice.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** I won't say, your imagination runs very far.\n\n//A moment of silence passes.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** No. We haven't kidnapped you. Although unofficially it may look like this. However, our organization operates internationally, beyond all politics and social affairs — unless the subject of our interest requires action in these areas.\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** You are that, well, NWO or something? Or…\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** It's hard to talk about introducing a new world order if you have to make sure in the meantime that this world does not fall into pieces for any, even the most stupid, reason. And I'm talking about a literal, non-metaphorical fall. Even though you will remember nothing after this hearing, I cannot tell you much more.\n\n//Two minutes of silence pass.//\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** So, em... Why was I brought here?\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** We have a few questions for you about a document that you discovered. Precisely prayers for conversion dated to the Renaissance period.\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** Ah. That's about it. I am happy to tell you about it...\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** Great, although the questions do not directly concern it... But more about the intention to pray it today at noon.\n\n//Dr. Goszkowski wriggles in the chair for a while.//\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** Well... I can't understand why this should be the reason for your interest...\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** In short, this prayer, despite its content, was not addressed to the Christian God, and thus could cause a lot of problems all over the world.\n\n//Goszkowski stares intensely at Lewald.//\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** On what basis you dare… No, you're ideologists of this, this, this leftist mob! This is a prayer to God our Father, not some of your false, pagan idols!\n\n//The man jumped up and began to gasp.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** May you calm down? As I said, we aren't interested in your beliefs directly, but in the possible effects...\n\n//Goszkowski tries to reach Lewald with his hands but is stopped by the shackles on his legs and the table. After that, he tries to go as far from Lewald as possible. Stumbles to the ground and clumsily makes the sign of the cross in the air.//\n\n**Wojsław Goszkowski:** Silence godless cunt. You were probably bred like a dog in a lab. You have no soul. You blaspheme. Away. Away! You're not taking me. The snares of your \"science\", your comic and unworthy name for the new occult do not reach me. You… you wanted to prevent us from praying. Satan persuaded you. Yes. Because he knew that our faith, regardless of prayer, would take our pleadings to the Father. And He would finally convert the world! As it should be! Starting with these communists, gender mockers, and demons daring to offend our Pope. Our Pope! The Polish Pope! Can you hear me!? You're not gonna make it. Our faith is stronger than your socialist–\n\n//At that moment, a medic runs into the room, accompanied by a bodyguard. Together, they carefully subdue Goszkowski and give him a sleeping drug.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** Well... At least we already know a bit about the matter.\n\n//Lewald closes the binder and stands up, meanwhile the unconscious historian is carried out of the room on a stretcher.//\n\n**Agata E. Lewald:** ...We had already guessed everything before though, but without a clear declaration on his part, the director would discredit us... And it was //a bit// unpleasant, to say—\n\n//Lewald leaves the room, making a quotation mark with their hand at the end of their speech. The door shuts, and the last words were not registered.//\n\n----\n**Summary:** After the interrogation, Dr. Wojsław Goszkowski was subjected to amnestization and taken to his apartment. Dr. Agata E. Lewald filed a request for not delegating them for interviewing people with a psychological profile similar to Dr. Goszkowski.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"margin: 40px 5px 40px 5px;border:solid 2px;\"]]\n------\n**##red|ERROR Dt-TEMP-KIME: SCP-7312 has been mentioned in a newly created file outside of standard spacetime##**\n\n**[[a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7312/offset/3\" style=\"color:red\"]]Click here to be redirected.[[/a]]**\n⠀\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
