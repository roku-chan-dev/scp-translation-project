All personnel must formally announce their intentions of entering the break room to SCP-6945. All site personnel must store their lunches and other snacks within the break room,\n\nPersonnel are allowed to converse with SCP-6945 and are allowed  haggle to get lower prices on the food stored in the break room’s fridge.\n\nUntil a method can be devised to put SCP-6945 in a proper containment cell, efforts must be made to convince SCP-6945 to remain within the break room and not attempt to “annex” other areas of Site-78 into its “domain”. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6945 is a 1.37 meters tall bipedal humanoid. The proportion of its body resembles a human child, except its head is proportionally larger, and the ears are pointed. SCP-6945 resembles and self-identifies as a “Goblin”, commonly seen in fantasy literature. The entity calls itself “Scratneck the Terrible” and claims to be from another world, one that the Foundation has not documented. The anomaly has currently claimed the break room within Site-78’s Parabiological Science department as the “Kingdom of Scratneck\" and acts as if it is its ruler.\n\nAs “Ruler” of the break room, SCP-6945 imposes taxes on food, beverages, and snack items kept within it, as well as determining who may come and go. This has proven to be a nuisance to Site-78’s staff who have suggested other methods of eating on their lunches. However, SCP-6945 has expressed that it will leave the break room to establish another kingdom with more compliant subjects if the room was to remain vacant.\n\nDespite other alternatives such as storing food in personal office spaces or going off site for lunch, Site-78’s personnel have acquiesced to the anomaly’s demands in order to keep it contained within the breakroom until SCP-6945 can be brought under proper containment. Because the full extent of SCP-6945's anomalous abilities is currently unknown, it may be possible for it to cause either a broken veil scenario or an SK-Class Dominance Shift scenario if allowed to expand its \"kingdom\" outside Site-78.\n\nSCP-6945’s uncontainable nature stems from a collection of thaumaturgical objects within its possession. It is unknown how many are currently in the possession of SCP-6945 but at least a dozen have been seen in possession of the anomaly via camera footage. The current objects known to the Foundation are as follows.\n\n||~ Foundation Designation ||~ SCP-6945's chosen name||~ Description||\n||~ SCP-6945-A ||~ The Staff of Dispel Person ||~ A gnarled wooden staff. Appears to have the ability to relocate multiple people to nearby rooms. The targets must be visible to the user for -A to take effect.||\n||~ SCP-6945-B ||~ Cloak of Invulnerability||~ Appears to make SCP-6945 impervious to physical harm.||\n\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** It had been discovered shortly after the construction of Site-78 in 2012 that a region with a hume level of ten points below baseline was located approximately inside the Parabiological Sciences department. This discrepancy in hume level did not appear to have any ill effects on people within it and was therefore disregarded as another minor anomaly within Chugwater, Wyoming.\n\nThis would lead it to be the location of a breach in reality, occurring on 25-5-2022 at 11:37 as SCP-6945 appeared within the break room of Site-78’s Parabiological Science department. Written below is a transcript of the break room’s single security camera during the appearance of SCP-6945.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[Cryptozoology Researcher Reginald Whitlock enters the break room at 1135.

The anomaly’s refusal to comply led security officers to engage it with their firearms, which had no effect as their bullets merely bounced off of its cloak. The Entity then utilized SCP-6945-A to send all of the officers into the Site’s Cafeteria.\n\nThe entity was classified as SCP-6945 and several further attempts by MTF forces to overwhelm the anomaly with sheer numbers ended in failure. It appeared that merely touching the anomaly caused SCP-6945-A to relocate the attacker, even if SCP-6945-A was no longer in the hands of its owner. \n\nAfter several days of Foundation Staff refusing to pay SCP-6945 to retrieve their lunches, SCP-6945 spoke of expanding its kingdom to find people who would pay its taxes. In response, Site-78 Director Leah Richter drafted the current containment procedures to avoid a potential containment breach.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Maria:** After this point, the anomaly took full control over the breakroom and turned our lives into a living hell.\n\n**Gregory:** My Moth-Man lunch box has been trapped in there for almost two weeks now.

There's more where that came from if you answer my Duchess's questions.\n\n**SCP-6945:** I SUPPOSE I CAN GIVE INTO THOSE DEMANDS.\n\n//SCP-6945 picks up the rat and consumes it before speaking.//\n\n**SCP-6945:** I KNOW NOT OF THE NAME OF THE LAND I COME FROM. I WAS A SIMPLE SCAVENGER FOR A CRUEL ORC WARLORD. HE HAD NO RESPECT FOR HIS SUBJECTS. THIS IS WHY I CAME HERE.\n\n**Maria:** But how did you get here? \n\n**SCP-6945:** I KEPT MANY TRINKETS FROM MY MASTER. I HOPED ONE DAY TO FIND SOMETHING I COULD USE TO OVERTHROW HIM. BUT INSTEAD I CAME ACROSS A SCROLL ONE DAY. IT CONTAINED A SPELL THAT GRANTED IT'S READER ONE WISH. I WISHED TO BE TRANSPORTED TO A REALM WHERE I COULD BE GRANTED MY OWN KINGDOM TO RULE.\n\n**Maria:** I see. But why not take pity on us as subjects? It seems to me that you were acting as cruel as your former master. Most of us can only afford to pay for that food once, y’know.\n\n**SCP-6945:** BUT WHAT ABOUT POOR SCRATNECK? HOW ELSE WAS I SUPPOSED TO ACQUIRE MONETARY CURRENCY? I DON'T WANT TO SCAVENGE FOR OTHERS AGAIN!\n\n**Maria:** Our world is a little bit different than yours. Workers have the right to 30-minute break for lunch. Something you decided to make harder for us.\n\n\n**SCP-6945:** I MADE SKIP WORKERS SUFFER LIKE SCRATNECK?\n\n//SCP-6945 is quiet for a moment.//\n\n**SCP-6945:** I MAY HAVE GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR. IT MATTERS NOT NOW. I HAVE LOST MY KINGDOM.\n\n**Maria:** I promise we won’t treat you as badly as your previous boss. You’ll have to be kept within this cell, we’ll make sure you have food and water. No greens right?\n\n**SCP-6945:** IS THIS “CELL” AN IMPORTANT AREA?\n\n//Johnston remains silent for a moment.//\n\n**Maria:** …Yes. It’s the cell for SCP-6945, the most dangerous anomaly in our little kingdom. In fact, the whole world could end if he ever got out.\n\n\n//SCP-6945 stares into his crystal orb, implanted within the table.//\n\n**SCP-6945:** WELL… PERHAPS DUTCHESS RICHTER AND MYSELF COULD DRAFT A TREATY TO… ALLOW THIS CHAMBER TO CONSTITUTE MY KINGDOM. NO MORE UNJUST TAXATION ON YOUR CONSUMABLES.\n\n**Maria:** Well what is a containment cell other than a room to take a break from a world that might reject you? In that way, it’s similar to your previous kingdom.\n\n**SCP-6945:** I SUPPOSE THAT IS TRUE. WHEN CAN NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN?\n\n**Maria:** Well, you’ve answered what questions I have. I’ll communicate to the Duchess about your treaty.\n\n\n**SCP-6945:** RETURN TO ME WITH THE TREATY. I SHALL SIGN IT SO LONG AS THE TERMS ARE FAIR. FOR BOTH PARTIES.\n\n**Maria:** Alright. Just no more gravy.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6944]]] | SCP-6945 | [[[SCP-6946]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
