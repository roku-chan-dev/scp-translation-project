The dictionary only records our definitions. Even that term is misleading, \"the dictionary,\" as though there were only one. Merriam-Webster probably says that waste (noun) is nothing but a useless byproduct of something better. Accurate so far as it goes, but it doesn't go nearly far enough. That's our fault. The worst kind of waste they're aware of is spent nuclear fuel, or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Their definition was written without having borne witness to the irreducible Nascimbenium cores powering innumerable impossible mad science projects, or the infernal combustion engines punching holes in the no√∂zone layer with their demonosulfuric emissions. That's the kind of waste __our__ dictionary takes into account. Metal that absorbs psychic signals and grows like cancer. Balls of backward-flowing time. Orichalcum, adamant and ectoplasm. The Colostomy from Out of Space. An endless catalogue of Anomalous fallout and excreta which only we can ameliorate, because only we can see it, because we set the world up that way.\n\nBut we're getting tired of seeing it. After all this time, this endless uphill landfill-slog, we need to see clear blue sky beyond our horizon of trash.\n\nIf only putting the waste out of mind could also put it out of sight. One might be forgiven for wishing that the very concept could be erased from our manifest of magic, as the gutters overflow with Anomalous ooze and the grey goo projections turn perilously proximal. One might be forgiven for wishing that the dictionary truly did define, and that by changing the definition of waste, we could change the very thing itself.\n\nBut forgiveness is never guaranteed. That's what gives it meaning.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n\nUndated photograph from the files of Dr. Dougall Deering.\n\n[[=image DT.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting table2 tableb\"]]\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nINCIDENT REPORT AAFD-I-2028-37\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**DATE:** 2028/09/08\n\n**FOREWORD:** Minor hazardous materials breach. See attached interview transcript.\n\n**RECORDING OFFICER:** Dr. Nhung Ngo (Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology, Site-43)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n¬´ BEGIN TRANSCRIPT ¬ª\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= //<Dr. Dougall Deering, Chief of Acroamatic Abatement at Site-43, is sitting across from Dr. Ngo at her desk. His hands are bandaged. He is very still, as he is recovering from heavy sedation. There is a small red plastic box on the desk beside Dr. Ngo's recording device, decorated with the heraldry of a confectionery company. He is staring at it.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] We'll ease you into this.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Okay.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What were you doing in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D on September the 8th, 2028?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Supervising a flush.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And what does that entail?\n\n= //<Dr. Deering's voice is flat and without affect, as though he is reciting from memory.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] AAF-D is the powerhouse of 43's abatement plant. It's the single largest Anomalous waste facility ever constructed. Since the effluence crisis escalated globally, it's been doing non-stop quadruple-duty. Every few years we have to shut it down, for a period not exceeding one hour -- anything longer and the whole system backs up irrecoverably -- and pump the overflow into the anachronic sump below the Site.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Why?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because output is severely lagging behind input. We're overwhelmed, and we're operating on triage principles. Any substance requiring too much time or too heavy a resource commitment to abate has to be set aside as impractical, because certain other abatements are too time-sensitive to delay. Some of the Anomalous effects of the waste we process can worsen the longer they're kept in the pipeline, and that's not even getting into what it does to the pipes themselves. When we perform the flush, they're often already white-hot, or ice cold, or humming obscenities in Latin. It's always a close call, because we can't afford to do it more regularly. Not on our schedule.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] So this flush resets the equipment to factory?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Not hardly. It just buys us a little more time. The next flush...\n\n= //<Dr. Deering sighs. His tone is becoming strident.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Probably not even a year.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] But you can still pump what you can't abate into the sump, right.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] For now. Not for much longer. It's getting full.\n\n= //<Silence on recording.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You can cut to the chase now. I don't... I don't feel anything anyway.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You're on a lot of painkillers. That's normal.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Sure.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Who was in charge of the flush this year?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Deputy Chief of Janitorial and Maintenance Ph-- Philip Eugene Deering.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=PhilStock.jpg\n|caption=Deputy Chief Deering.\n|width=175px\n|align=right]]\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Your brother.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] My... yes.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And you were supervising him?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes. No. I was... visiting him.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Visiting him? You work at the same facility.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes. We've been here together for decades, but we haven't been here //together// at all. I never speak to him. I don't want to get into that, we just... we aren't close.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What did the two of you talk about?\n\n= //<Dr. Deering nods at the box on the table.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That. I found it in an old box in our parents' house, cleaning out the basement. I thought he'd like to have it. I bought it for him from the general store when we were children.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] May I?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Go on.\n\n= //<Dr. Ngo picks up the toy. It consists of a single sliding compartment. She slides it out, then back in, then back out again. She shrugs.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What does it do?\n\n= //<Dr. Deering smiles faintly.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It makes things disappear.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Put something in it. Your pin, maybe.\n\n= //<Dr. Ngo unclips her Site-43 badge pin and places it inside the compartment. She closes it. She opens it again. The pin is missing. She closes and opens the compartment several more times. The pin is still missing.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] How does it work?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It's magic. I'm an occultist, you know.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Did you end up giving it to him?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What happened instead? Take your time.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I'm not as familiar with the layout of F-D as I used to be. They've had to make a lot of changes to keep up with the pressure. There was a valve...\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] On the junction between the...\n\n= //<Dr. Ngo checks her notes.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] ...orphic and ambichronological outflow pipes. What does that mean?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Two very different types of esoteric effluence in side-by-side conduits. There's a junction connecting them with a series of impregnable stoppers operated by remote control, for combining their contents under specific emergency circumstances. Intermixing in rigorously-controlled amounts to neutralize both in the case of an overflow. The valve is only there to allow manual access during accidents, since it's impossible to do this with the appropriate level of care by hand. It shouldn't have moved just because I bumped into it.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] So why did it? Metal fatigue?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Maybe. Every individual facility is suffering from budget crunch, and the equipment is aging rapidly. But no... no, I think we were actually in the early stages of a total collapse already, and this was just the first sign. Those pipes were full to bursting, when they should have been almost empty...\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] Are you suggesting they hadn't been flushed properly?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. I don't... I can't see how. Look, they're under a lot of pressure, the people who work in AcroAbate. And the materials are unpredictable. There could have been some sort of duplicative reaction. The point is, there was a lot more effluence in the system than expected, and a lot of it's still in there now. It might have come blasting out anyway, even if I hadn't hit the valve. \n\n= //<Dr. Deering sighs.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] But I did, so it happened the way it did. But it didn't make a difference, it definitely didn't really make a difference.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] What happened next?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] The materials mixed inappropriately, and the orphic outflow instantly became every version of itself it had ever been: before, during, and after abatement, simultaneously. It looked like an army of technicolour ghosts all melted together, bursting out of the pipes like steam.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And then?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] And then Phil... Deputy Chief Deering, headed for the suction pump controls near the break. Every room and corridor in the entire facility has these controls; all he had to do was turn a single handle and all the emergent phenomena would get sucked into the sinkhole without further incident.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] But that's not what happened.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. Instead, he was met halfway by some... //thing,// which manifested behind him, between us, away from the ghostflow. Something writhing, ethereal. It sucked up most of the airborne effluence, then crunched itself down to his size... I could //hear// the crunching, and then--\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You don't have to r--\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //<shouting>// And then it moved right through him, overlaid itself on him, coiled around him and started to shrink. And his eyes rolled back, his skin shrivelled in against his bones and split where his organs were, and they burst out of him, and he melted into a pile of... all over the floor... and it was gone, and he was...\n\n= //<Dr. Deering heaves ineffectually, hyperventilating for several seconds before recovering.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don't think he felt it.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] And then you turned the handle yourself.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don't remember.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It was captured on camera.\n\n= //<Dr. Ngo gestures at Dr. Deering's hands.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It's how that happened. The controls were compromised. The ghosts were out too long.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I don't remember.\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] You've been traumatized, of course--\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] If you got it all on camera, why drag me through this again?\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] I needed to hear your version for the report.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] My...? My //version//? What the fuck does that mean?\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] It's just standard procedure, doctor.\n\n= //<Silence on recording.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ngo\"]]Dr. Ngo:[[/span]] How do I get my pin back?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Shake it to the left. Hard.\n\n= //<Dr. Ngo shakes the box, then opens the compartment. She retrieves her button, and reaffixes it to her jacket.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It was never gone. A slide to the right, and a little mirror to hide the evidence.

When these by-products are generated //continuously//, however, their containment will //eventually// become infeasible, and so the criteria is met for their disposal.\n\nMass containment facilities (particularly those specializing in biological containment) are already equipped with immense infrastructures for disposing of conventional waste. Unfortunately, these systems cannot contend with //unconventional// waste, the esoteric properties of which may eventuate any number of unforeseen issues. Each year, innumerable breaches are caused by the reaction of multiple Anomalous substances in spaces they should never have occupied in the first instance -- garbage dumpsters, sewage tanks, ventilation systems and the like. This leaves our most crucial Sites with the issue of storing, transporting, and neutralizing large concentrations of volatile esoteric effluence, on a case-by-case basis, for an arbitrary number of Anomalies, with arbitrary properties, //ad infinitum.//\n\nThis is the ever-progressing front on which Acroamatic Abatement does battle. It attempts to generalize the problems of safe storage, transport, and amelioration for arbitrary acroamatic waste. These are extremely messy problems to solve, and not just in the practical sense:\n\n//Theoretically//, Acroamatic Abatement deals in the development of containment and neutralization techniques for //all possible// Anomalous effects, and accounting for their potential interactions with //all other// Anomalous effects. At time of writing, no singular inciting element has been identified as the cause to which the entire known range of Anomalous phenomena can be attributed; in the opinion of this acroamaticist, no such element exists. Definitionally, Anomalies subvert generally-accepted models of how reality works, and so their classification is determined by whether they are congruent with our limited human understanding -- there is no \"Swann boson\" (Pickman //et. al,// 2021) or similar phenomenon that grants a substance the quality of //defying expectation.//\n\nIt is, therefore, impossible to develop a comprehensive technique which can strip any arbitrary substance of its Anomalous properties with certainty, short of developing rigorous scientific explanations for those properties and conveying them pedagogically to the human populace entire. As such, the primary approach of Acroamatic Abatement has been to group esoteric substances into broad classes based on their properties, developing containment and treatment strategies for each class and subclass therein. This classification system is necessarily non-rigorous, and cannot comprehensively describe all acroamatic material (for reasons aforementioned), but a more effective model has yet to be developed.\n[[/div]]\n\n= //[...]//\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\nThe following hard-copy correspondence transpired between Dr. Dougall Deering and Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering prior to the proposal of SCP-7243.\n\n[[div class=\"papernote at\"]]\n[[span class=\"cond\" style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"]]**[CHIEF TOROSYAN-DEERING]**[[/span]]\n\nYou killed my husband.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote dd\"]]\n[[span class=\"cond\" style=\"font-size: 1.1rem;\"]]**[DR.

At this point we can't even begin to predict how these increasingly volatile materials will interact with each other and our obsolete equipment. The entity which killed Philip could have resulted from any number of vectors; it will never be possible to blame any one in specific.

I'm in charge of AcroAbate, and whatever happens under that umbrella is on me. That's the job. But we can't lose sight of the fact that what killed Philip was an extreme statistical outlier under nobody's control, a nasty twist of fate that we can't even comprehend, let alone measure or mete out justice to. After all of our efforts, things like that still exist. They're even multiplying. If we dwell on our mistakes, they'll overtake us. We can't give up on our quest to figure out where all of this is coming from, and how to send it back there. If we do, it wins.

It is housed within Acroamatic Abatement Facility //Exactus// (AAF-X), the nethermost structure of subterranean Research and Containment Site-43. AAF-X is the largest waste processing facility on Earth, and is responsible for a ~95% decrease in global acroamatic waste production.\n\nFrom the baseline perspective, SCP-7243 processes no waste. Rather than actively detoxifying esoteric effluence, DePLExA performs a novel acroamatic abatement procedure which ensures the non-existence of any effluence which it would be used to abate. Were any substance to be deposited into SCP-7243, the following would occur:\n\n* that substance would instantly be annihilated, retrocausally, from all of spacetime;\n* the substance then would never have existed at all, and thus could not have been deposited into SCP-7243 in the first place;\n* this scenario would generate a buildup of retrocausal quanta[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A general term encompassing anti-chronons, malignant narremes, and related phenomena.[[/span]] which, if left unchecked, would induce a ZK-Class temporal paradox;\n* SCP-7243 would absorb the imminent paradox and redirect its quanta into the immediate past, colliding with the paradoxical substance, causing its annihilation;\n* thus a stable time loop would form, wherein the substance's non-existence is self-justifying. \n\nAs such (from the baseline perspective), SCP-7243 prevents the creation of any esoteric effluence which it would practically be used to neutralize. So long as the supply lines necessary to deliver acroamatic materials from their sources to SCP-7243 remain fully operational, no such materials will ever be produced. \n\nSCP-7243-A collectively designates all Anomalies for which supply lines to SCP-7243 have been instated. To date, 97% of all effluence-generating[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Technically no longer effluence-generating, with occasional exceptions.[[/span]] Anomalies comprise SCP-7243-A.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nThe following transcript is excerpted from the Cliometria.aic automatic audio logs for the Site-43 Acroamatic Abatement Section.

Conversely, any material which //does// measurably exist cannot be processed by SCP-7243. This is no flaw of the Engine's design -- by virtue of existing, any observable substance is predestined to never be processed by SCP-7243, and must be abated by conventional means. Attempts to deposit existent materials into SCP-7243 are invariably futile, as some sequence of events will inevitably transpire such that those materials never reach SCP-7243's central aperture. \n\nSuch events statistically manifest as logistical failures. For instance: an anti-esoteric shipping crate containing a quantity of undetected effluence is loaded onto a cargo ship //en route// to Site-43. If stored above-deck, the crate might fall overboard; if below, the ship might sink or encounter critical issues mid-voyage. As the crate grows nearer to AAF-X, the exact circumstances preventing its eradication become increasingly chaotic and disastrous. \n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]CONTINGENCIES:[[/span]] Fortunately, the hypothetical instance described above is impossible. If a container (or transport vessel) possesses any amount of effluence, it must fail to reach AAF-X, and so its entire payload will exist.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Or the effluence is destined to be detected beforehand and preemptively removed before shipping; or it will go undetected but spill out of its container in transit; //et cetera.//[[/span]]  Full waste containers can be reliably detected and rerouted. \n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=Digamma.png\n|caption=ATF Digamma-7243 (\"Out Of Sight\")\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n]]\n\nBy continuously monitoring the production (and lack thereof) of all esoteric waste, globally, Acroamatic Abatement personnel cross-reference spontaneous abatement failures with Logistics' effluence collection and transportation network, thereby predicting precisely where further logistical failures are most likely to occur. These failures can then be preemptively avoided -- the relevant effluence must still be redirected to backup facilities, but their corresponding supply lines can be temporarily halted and inspected for faults. In this way, SCP-7243's behavior 'warns' the Foundation of any impending event which would (and must) prevent the transportation of extant effluence to AAF-X.\n\nSCP-7243 is also highly sensitive to local chronological shift, and -- should such a shift occur -- it is configured to reference the causal dependencies of its surroundings in order to reinforce its own chronology. The Parachronology Division has identified seven personnel (Dr. Dougall Deering, Technician Philip Deering, Dr. Place H. MD., Dir. Allan McInnis, Dr. Nhung Ngo, Dr. Ilse Reynders, Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering) on whose actions SCP-7243 is causally dependent; in case of impending XK-Class Event, due either to external influence or some internal malfunction, it is crucial that these individuals (or their remains, where applicable) remain proximal to AAF-X. For this purpose, the aforementioned (surviving) individuals have been organized into Applied Task Force Digamma-7243, indefinitely stationed within Site-43, and provided amenities to minimize departures.\n\nAs performing referential calculations imposes a significant electrical drain on the Site-43 local power grid, the device will only perform this check automatically once every three days. Shift detection may be instigated manually at any time by the Chief of Applied Occultism.\n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]ORIGIN:[[/span]] In Q4 2029, following an extended leave of absence, Applied Occultism Chief Dougall A.

Despite the fact that I am the world's premier expert on the present subject, despite my possession of firsthand knowledge regarding the disaster which rendered it supposedly indescribable, and despite my persistent entreaties to be looped into the research and containment process, I have been stonewalled at every turn until the utmost end of alternative resources.\n\nI, Dr. Dougall Alton Deering, once stood at the head of a scientific project second in importance to none on this Earth. We faced an Anomalous waste crisis of unprecedented and ever-escalating scale, and my staff and I were charged with its amelioration. Here is my precise, cogent, one hundred percent accurate explanation of how that worked -- and what, through no fault of my own, went wrong with it.\n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] [[span class=\"diss\"]]Site-43 is the designation for a facility constructed one kilometre beneath Ipperwash Provincial Park in Lambton County,[[/span]] Ontario, Canada [[span class=\"diss\"]]for research and containment operations, the most vital of which was the advancement of Acroamatic Abatement: neutralization of esoteric effluence. Site-43 contained four of the most advanced AcroAbate facilities on Earth, though there existed[[/span]] multiple satellite facilities [[span class=\"diss\"]]at other Sites and Areas internationally. Our tireless efforts resulted in a stalemate with this implacable opponent, until in a moment of personal inspiration I was able to devise a novel abatement method which could permanently terminate the matter in question via the application of advanced parascience.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"diss\"]]I enlisted the aid of Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering to construct a device we termed the DePLExA Engine, after consultation with various external experts (including Dr. Ilse Reynders and Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate). The device eventuated[[/span]] my [[span class=\"diss\"]]prime[[/span]] aspiration [[span class=\"diss\"]]for Anomalous waste: that it be conceptually[[/span]] erased [[span class=\"diss\"]]from existence, as though it had never existed in the first place. Effluence went into the engine,[[/span]] and nothing came out, [[span class=\"diss\"]]and retrocausally nothing went in,[[/span]] resulting in [[span class=\"diss\"]]a paradox that powered the machine itself. It was elegant, flawless, and effective. We had beaten back the beast. We had ended the[[/span]] crisis.\n\n[[span class=\"diss\"]]My shortsighted consultants -- or if not shortsighted, then actively malicious -- caused the device to be deactivated at a[[/span]] critical [[span class=\"diss\"]]moment. This allowed the original course of causality to retroactively resume, and we experienced a total effluence maximalization effect unabated by any other mechanisms, which in short[[/span]] order [[span class=\"diss\"]]caused Site-43 and Nexus-94 within which it is situated to be[[/span]] stricken [[span class=\"diss\"]]from consensus reality.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"diss\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering and I witnessed these events.[[/span]] I attempted [[span class=\"diss\"]]to escape with her in order to help coordinate disaster mitigation and relief efforts, but Dr. Reynders interfered in[[/span]] a selfish bid [[span class=\"diss\"]]to preserve her own existence and we were instead transported from the facility together.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"diss\"]]The conceptually[[/span]] null [[span class=\"diss\"]]space you call Nexus-7243 is Site-43 and Nexus-94. They still exist. And it[[/span]] is my duty [[span class=\"diss\"]]to restore them.[[/span]]\n\nUnlike my colleagues, I do NOT shirk my responsibilities.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\n\n[[span style=\"filter: opacity(0.66);\"]]{{//# It doesn't matter whether anyone else can parse this//}}[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"filter: opacity(0.66);\"]]{{//# It's the CORRECT version of the file//}}[[/span]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 90%; font-style: italic;\"]]\n-- Dr. D.

This includes any other extrauniversal space which is tethered to, or interfaces with, our reality in a coherent fashion. Any region which can successfully be referenced within consensus reality is, itself, an extension of consensus reality, and therefore comprises Nexus-00.\n\nNexus-00 is of course not a single contiguous, continuous physical surface. It incorporates various physically-disconnected locales which are at least informationally-adjacent to consensus reality. However, it has been evidenced to Our Foundation that the manifold of our local universe (Nexus-00-A) also possesses points and/or boundaries of informational discontinuity. These discontinuities are not to be confused with embedded pocket-universes (ie. a black hole's interior), nor [*/scp-3930 regions of non-existence], nor extreme antimemetic influence, nor local breakdown of conventional physics, nor **##green|hazardous nomenclative influence##**; all such regions can still be referenced, however circuitously, within the manifold of Nexus-00.\n\nInstead, these discontinuities demarcate the bounds of what can be referenced from within Nexus-00. To restate, as clearly as the subject will allow: \n\n* consensus reality consists solely of space which can be referenced within consensus reality;\n* consensus reality possesses internal informational discontinuities;\n* some such discontinuous boundaries are embedded //within// the interior space of //physical// reality, despite marking the bounds of //informational// reality.\n\nA hypothetical region existing outside Nexus-00 would be impossible to reference, even in a statement which attempts to explain the impossibility of its being referenced. An extreme degree of vagueness, implication, and definition-in-the-negative is fundamentally required in order to express discrepancies between our physical and informational realities, as any truth statement regarding the physical nature of such a discrepancy is definitionally incompatible with the informational makeup of our universe.\n\nFunctionally, the \"Nexus-00\" designation is utilized as an inverse[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Not a mathematical inverse, but the complementary set.[[/span]] of the deprecated \"Nexus-7243\" designation (aka. AO-\"NX-7243\") as the latter does not refer.\n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]ORIGIN:[[/span]] Both prior to and contemporaneous with efforts to resolve the global fallout of [[span class=\"table5 st\"]]INCIDENT 6488-D/I[[/span]], a staggering increase in the production of esoteric waste substances was reported by all Containment Areas and Sites. Apparently coincidentally, the Logistics Branch noted an inexplicable surplus of infrastructure for esoteric substance collection and distribution. Thusly equipped to supply a hundredfold increase in esoteric waste processing systems, Logistics attempted construction of requisite emergency duplicates. It however gradually became clear that all schematics, blueprints, and methodological descriptions of extant waste processing systems had become subject to __an effect__, assumed to be a by-product of the aforementioned incident.\n\nAs these systems could not be reverse-engineered, duplicate systems could not be constructed, nor could similar novel systems be designed, as __an effect__ pervaded all attempts. Our Foundation's understanding of esoteric waste was found to be strikingly underdeveloped, and all relevant pre-existing technologies had been rendered incomprehensible. Analytical and communicative struggles were exacerbated by constant interference from rogue AI agents, prohibiting any combined effort to properly contend with redundant Anomalous substances.\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing LOTUS crisis, a critical global buildup of these substances could not be afforded. Despite an incomplete understanding of its former waste disposal solutions, the Logistics Branch elected to, as a stopgap measure, re-engage its global supply network and temporarily resume the delivery of esoteric substances to __a discontinuity__ in Nexus-00. Despite the reactivation of LOTUS on 2036/08/14, __an effect__ persisted, and was also encountered in attempting to conceptualize, describe, and measure the nature of this discontinuity, prompting the creation of both Outpost-7243 and this file.\n\nAfter consultation with Researcher Emeritus Dr. D. Deering, who had spent much of his retirement independently investigating the properties and detoxification of esoteric waste substances, he and a selection of [*/secure-facility-dossier-area-12 Area-12]'s research staff were organized into the Department of Esoteric Reduction and tasked with the indefinite maintenance of Outpost-7243.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]]//-- Dr. H.R.

Per recommendation of Chief Esoteric Reductionist Dr. D. Deering, and given the absence of a more effective solution, this file's Interaction Protocols have been permanently instated as standard esoteric waste disposal procedure.\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]ADDENDUM 2042/06/01:[[/span]] The neutralization of LOTUS on 2042/05/08, and subsequent reconstitution of associated conceptual structures, has not observably alleviated __an effect__ which its initial deactivation seemingly instigated. Esoteric Polymath Place H. MD., PhD., having returned to the local timeline following the deactivation of LOTUS, is (expectedly) unable to provide context pertaining to his correspondence with Dr. I. Reynders during Incident 6488-D/II. Both agree that interference and impersonation by rogue AI was responsible for any logical discrepancies.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n[[div class=\"yui-navset yui-navset-top tabanchorbutton\" style=\"margin-top: -12px;\"]]\n[[ul class=\"yui-nav\"]]\n[[li]]\n[#tabanchor >> scroll to file selection <<]\n[[/li]]\n[[/ul]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n\n[[=image admo-7243-amy-cafeteria.jpg]]\n\n[[=image admo-7243-amy-warehouse.jpg]]\n\n[[=image admo-7243-amy-ceiling.jpg]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\nJournal entry for 2042/08/14, Dr. Dougall Deering.\n\n[[div class=\"papernote dd\"]]\nI don't give a fuck what anyone else thinks.

This event involved the overlap of many different possible chronologies which interacted with a multitude of paradoxes, retrocausal quanta generated by said paradoxes, acroamatic quanta dispensed into Research and Containment Site-43, and other miscellaneous factors to prompt a Zero-Sum Localized Event Collapse. This was later followed by a Localized Event Rebound. From the baseline perspective, the totality of EE-001 took place over a period of seven years, four months, eighteen days, during which time Site-43 was near-fully detached and dissociated from consensus reality. Data recovered following EE-001 suggests an interior temporal progression of precisely six years.\n\nEE-001 was induced by an attack on Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X's systems by a faction of deviant artificial intelligences released into cyberspace by the deactivation of SCP-6488 (RAIDFRAME VIII, \"LOTUS\"). SCP-7243 (DePLExA) detected this attack, recognized it as an Alpha priority, and resorted to its default emergency behavior: to seek out the individuals on whom it is causally-dependent (in this case, all members of ATF œù-7243), and reinforce its chronology using their personal histories as \"guideposts.\" In short, DePLExA combatted what its systems viewed as an imminent CK-Class event by attempting to draw out the statistically \"true\" version of itself from the past actions, memories, and experiences of ATF œù-7243, and projected this version of reality over its present existence, which it understood to be compromised by outside forces. Had a sufficient number of causally-dependent personnel been present at this time, and had local instability not resulted in the rapid overlap of over one hundred failed anchoring attempts, DePLExA would have succeeded in its task.\n\nInstead, ATF œù-7243 members D. Deering, P. Deering, Place H. MD., A. McInnis, N. Ngo, I. Reynders, and A. Torosyan-Deering were all unavailable, owing either to death, non-attendance, or incapacitation, and so DePLExA failed to determine a suitable alternate version of reality with which to replace itself. Its systems therefore attempted to construct a version of events wherein none of the aforementioned individuals were involved in its creation, or even, alternatively, in the history of Site-43; this resulted in SCP-7243 summing numerous contradictory facts and projecting them as objective truths to be realized simultaneously. Correspondingly, Site-43 and the greater Nexus-94 rapidly fell out of sync with the remainder of the universe and dissociated to an estimated 98% completeness. It is theorized that this effect was so all-encompassing that it could not be corrected by a naturally-occurring CK or ZK-Class Event, which may have been triggered multiple times during the process.\n\nDePLExA, now isolated with the rest of Nexus-94 in an uncompassable, extra-ontological location, its functions expedited by surviving on-site personnel, modelled an uncountable number of irregular chronological paths, systematically eliminating any options which contradicted its core directives. It was able to identify a preferable chronology within a distorted period equivalent to roughly seven years.\n\nThe force of Nexus-94's recoherence was sufficient to overpower the influence of any remaining temporal paradoxes. Following a sharp increase in the appearance of new matter, the entire Nexus was reconstituted in the span of a single day.\n\nIn the wake of Site-43's original decoherence on 2036/04/21, the Department of Esoteric Reduction was established to compensate for the loss of the Acroamatic Abatement Section, its methods, and its institutional knowledge. Esoteric Reduction constructed Outpost-7243 at the local limits of Nexus-00 as a headquarters for the monitoring of the dissociated zone, as well as a logistics hub managing the transport of esoteric effluence to Nexus-94. Though the Nexus did not conventionally exist at this time, waste could still be moved into it via a decommissioned pipeline believed to have once carried platonic material to Acroamatic Abatement Facility [/scp-5520 AAF-W]. For reasons which remain obscure, this pipeline had not fully dissociated.\n\nFor almost the entirety of the span of Nexus-94's decoherence it had been injected with vast quantities of esoteric waste from across the globe. Lacking a feasible alternative or the experience necessary to formulate one, Esoteric Reduction was allowed to proceed with this arrangement indefinitely. Data recovered subsequent to EE-001 suggests that the majority of this waste was successfully ameliorated by surviving personnel within the discontinuity. Upon the incident of Site-43's return to consensus reality, the remaining waste was absorbed into the environment at rapid speed, mixing and fusing with the remaining volatile acroamatic and retrocausal quanta within the Site to concoct a disastrous chain reaction.\n\nA protective energy shield was deployed over Nexus-94. This contained the deleterious effects of the impending reaction, but did nothing to preserve its contents. Minutes after the shield was deployed a cataclysmic explosion of esoteric waste and condensed antichronons atomized what remained of Site-43. The energy shield now overhangs a vast, cavernous pit.\n\nCleanup operations discovered a single member of Site personnel unconscious but alive at the perimeter of Nexus-94.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting table5 tableb\"]]\n\nThe following is a transcription of footage recovered from the personal uniform camera of Chief Amelia Torosyan-Deering on 8 September 2043.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n¬´ BEGIN TRANSCRIPT ¬ª\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= //<Chief Torosyan-Deering is standing in the operations control room of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-X.

As the quantity and volatility of esoteric waste has seen exponential increase over the Foundation's lifespan, the aforementioned method has approached minimal effectiveness, and can neither be localized nor replicated at sufficient scale without the entirety of Huron's lakewater soon being spent.\n\nAn alternative method of esoteric reduction, known as 'existential abatement', has been proposed and implemented per insistence of the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center for Multidisciplinary Studies; this over-engineered, profoundly unstable method sought to circumvent the inception of Anomalous waste by instantiating self-justifying, metastable micro-paradoxes which were harnessed in the retroactive erasure of certain substances under extremely precise conditions. The inherent truculence of this approach inevitably led to its failure -- expedited by its premature deactivation, leaving it vulnerable to commandeerment by rogue AI agents -- which has resulted in:\n\n* the loss of Site-43, its personnel, its infrastructure and contributions, its contained subjects, and the nation of Japan; \n* the sudden and global resurgence of the esoteric waste substances crisis;\n* multiple breaches of baseline reality's ontokinetic and chronological integrity;\n* a cascade hazardous materials breach of multiversal proportion.\n\nThe Department of Esoteric Reduction fundamentally rejects the pursuit of any such experimental solution, and so has worked closely with the P. M. Center to develop a well-tested, robust, rigorous methodology which will ensure the stable ejection of esoteric waste substances from consensus reality.\n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]METHOD:[[/span]] Esoteric waste substances are to be ejected from consensus reality.\n\nAs these substances are inherently unpredictable and highly reactive with other Anomalous phenomena, attempts to ectoentropically erase or detoxify them have been rejected. Similarly, the hypothetical informational space 'between' or 'outside of' conventional universes has not been shown to meaningfully exist, and so attempting to send Anomalous substances to that space would be an experimental approach of unprecedented consequences. After much deliberation, it is evident that the only acceptable solution with which to proceed is the ejection of esoteric waste substances into parallel universes.\n\nThis process must be executed such that the impact on recipient timelines is minimal and undetected, as the recipients' Foundations (or alternate Normalcy organizations) might otherwise become hostile to the baseline Foundation. To achieve this, ejected substances should be evenly distributed across a wide range of timelines in small, concentrated quantities; they should also be delivered to precise locations (and times) wherein their esoteric properties will swiftly be abated by local forces. The feasibility of this approach is attested by the uncontrolled dispersal of acroamatic material across the timeplane during the EE-001 \"rubberband\" event of 2043, which now stands as this project's initial test case. Controlled and targeted dispersal can only excel these results.\n\nThe Department of Esoteric Reduction proposes the creation of an industrial eigenmachine, stationed at Area-21, which performs the following procedure:\n\n* esoteric waste substances delivered by extant global logistics networks will be sorted by their attributes and properties, as they would be in conventional acroamatic abatement methods, then compactified into concentrated 'packets';\n* an extrauniversal imaging mechanism, designed by the P. M. Center in conjunction with Esoteric Polymath P. H. MD., PhD., will generate a 'timeplane-curve map' describing all timelines which possess an iteration of Site-43 (or suitable equivalent);\n* every seventy-two days, for each waste packet, the next sequential timeline in the timeplane-curve map will be identified and targeted; this map is hard-coded to avoid human error and is subject to a 'ratchet system' which cannot be countermanded, as the intense thaumic backscatter produced by each packet deployment must be evenly distributed along the timeplane's heat-arc to avoid a potentially metapocalyptic imbalance;\n* a temporary transdimensional Way will be initialized, linking baseline Area-21 to the appropriate section of the selected timeline's abatement facilities, at the time of minimal projected impact;\n* the waste packet will be ejected from consensus reality through this Way, whereupon it will be sent to the recipient timeline and immediately abated alongside similar esoteric materials;\n* the Way will then close, and the system will ratchet forward along the timeplane map in anticipation of the next deployment.\n\nTechnical specifications and resource requirements will be presented in full to relevant parties as needed.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] You didn't.

And so have I.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Exactly.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I killed Phil. \n\n= //<Dr. Deering taps his chest.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] //I// killed Phil. And this is how I did it.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Come out here, and let's discuss.\n\n[[span class=\"ir\"]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] The ramifications of what you're suggesting--\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I'm not suggesting anything. This is what happened. The thing that coiled around him did so for a reason. It ignored me. It went for him. It solved the problem.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Solved the...?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That's why I'm the only one who could see it, at first. //It was me.//\n\n= //<Dr. Deering spreads his hands wide.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I'm the loop.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That doesn't... \n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] This packet is one hundred percent paraspectral. It's the extra material that showed up after Phil flushed AAF-D, the stuff nobody could account for. It's the source of the thing that took his life. And that thing behaved with //purpose,// Amelia.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That doesn't mean you have to...\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It does, though. The loop is stable, so long as we get this next part right.

Phil has to die again. He always has to die. And it has to be a sure thing.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Meaning we need control at the moment of crisis. What we send needs to have //agency.// And a shot of undifferentiated ectoplasm hasn't got that.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What makes you think you won't just melt into nothing when the packet pours in on you?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I suppose... I probably will. But I know that won't be the end of it. Because I saw myself. I saw myself draw in the extra energy, take... take Phil, and then pass back into the pipes. \n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But why does it have to be //you?//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because he's my brother. And this time I'm going to show up for him.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But it doesn't make SENSE! Ilse, hold on. Try to shut this thing down. You guys aren't thinking this through rationally. Why would //that// be the loop? Why would you turn yourself into something that would kill your own brother?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Because the packet would have killed him instead, and then it would have blown the whole place sky-high, me included, and as far as anyone would know it would have all been Phil's fault. Instead, something sucked up the effluence in the air, then took him... \n\n= //<His eyes widen.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I remember thinking he hadn't felt it. That he didn't suffer. Maybe it gave him that. And then it saved the Site, gave my old self the chance to turn the valve, start my penance. Then it disappeared into the system... \n\n= //<Dr. Deering laughs.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] And you know what? I bet it was still in there back in '43. 2043.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I saw it.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] What?\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] I saw it. It leaked down into DePLExA from AAF-D. It tried to kill me, too. On my last run through the cycle.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] That doesn't make sense. You couldn't see it on the video of Phil's acc-- of what happened to Phil.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But I //could// see it in person when the chronology anchor started to work. When 43 rolled back to reality, it must've been caught in the throes, concretized. It appeared, and it reached out for me...\n\n= //<Silence on recording.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Reached out for you.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Oh my god.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Running in circles for fifteen years, trapped in the pipes, waiting for you to bring me back to life, so I could help you to survive. I like the symmetry.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] This can't be happening.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] At least this time, it really is my idea.\n\n= //<Chief Torosyan-Deering sags.>//\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Except you //didn't// help me to survive. You didn't do a //fucking thing// that helped me. \n\n= //<She laughs.>//\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] God, I should have known it was you.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I'm sorry.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] But you didn't answer my question. Why is this the loop? Phil only died because you did this. If he hadn't died, you never would have decided to do this. The logic doesn't work.\n\n= //<Dr. Deering shrugs.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It happened, so it does work. The universe requires it to. Bootstrap paradox. Maybe the materials involved... they were ambichronological, remember? Time flowing both ways.\n\n= //<He shrugs again.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Or maybe that's looking too deep. Maybe Phil and I are just predestined to part, like... well.\n\n= //<Chief Torosyan-Deering places a palm on the porthole. Dr. Deering moves to match the gesture, then pulls back.>//\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] That's not enough. It's not universal perversity. It needs to mean something more. You did all of this for him! We both did. All of it. Tell me I'm wrong.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] You're wrong. Half-wrong.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] What?\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] I never did any of it for him.\n\n= //<Silence on recording.>//\n\n[[span class=\"ir\"]]Dr. Reynders:[[/span]] Two minutes.

For fuck's sake, let me do it instead. You know that's the better solution.\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] No. Absolutely not.\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] Stop being so selfish!\n\n= //<Dr. Deering looks over his shoulder.>//\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] It's not selfish. It's the least selfish part of this, maybe the only part that isn't. Sure, I'm taking the easy way out. That's who I am. That's all I'm useful for. Maybe I can find a way to do some good in there, however this works out. If I can, I'll keep trying. But I'm weak and lazy and short-sighted, nothing anyone can count on, as you well know. So you need to stay out there, the way you are right now, and keep doing the real work. The good--\n\n[[span class=\"at\"]]Chief Torosyan-Deering:[[/span]] No!\n\n[[span class=\"dd\"]]Dr. Deering:[[/span]] Yes.
