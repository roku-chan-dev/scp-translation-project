Detroit’s little cousin. A vibrant place by day, and at night if one knew what they were doing. A hustling, bustling city with a reputation for being Ohio’s most overlooked locale.\n\nAmber knew it as much. Visitors from outside the city would only see the artificial, materialistic facade that made the city look as unattractive as it did. But Amber knew the hidden gems of the city by heart. Every neighborhood was unique and had distinctive personalities, and the restaurants always had the best food, no matter what the time of the day it was. It had everything, and she was proud to call it her home, regardless of the circumstances that befell upon it.\n\nAlthough fractured, although the dire conditions, the city still persisted nevertheless. And so did she. It was like her dad once said, “if nothing else, keep moving. You’ll only lose if you let them win.”\n\nShe took it by heart. If nothing else, she will plant her legs down like a tree and stand tall for the world to try and strike her down. She might be battered and broken, but she was alive.\n\nAmber knew what it was like to be overlooked. But that was fine by her. She could take care of herself.\n\nAmber walked through the automatic doors of Walmart as they slid open, and examined her surroundings. It was almost closing time, and there weren't that many people around. The perfect time to strike.\n\nAmber’s dad was a good man. He always made sure that Amber never strayed off to the wrong path, while also respecting her boundaries and checking on her almost daily to see if she was okay. He was protective, but not too strict. He taught her how to defend herself, what to do if she needed to walk alone at night, how to avoid the cops when applicable, and he even bought her a taser, just in case.\n\nHis strong sense of justice carried over to Amber as she grew up, but she took that characteristic and changed it to her own liking.\n\nShe had a habit of stealing. And she was good at it. She never got caught, and she always made sure to never leave any trace of her thievery. She had no other choice. She was practically living off scraps of food, and the job opportunities were scarce. There weren’t any other options for her to take.\n\nShe learned to swiftly swipe a candy bar into her pocket while no one was looking, and eat it in the bathroom with the stall doors locked. She scanned her items without paying, and found other ways to avoid triggering the sensors of the theft alarm. It took a lot of patience and effort, but it became her routine. And no one ever spotted these thefts.\n\nAs Amber examined an orange to steal for later, she pondered about that last point. Why //did// no one ever spot her? Statistically it would be very unlikely, especially considering that she’s been doing the same trick for years.\n\nA memory forced itself into the front of her mind. The alarm blaring. The sound of heavy footsteps. The confused looks of the passerby. She was standing right there, for everyone to see, and they just stared. It was like they stared right through her. Like she didn’t even exist. The security officer who ran in simply guessed that the sensor had a malfunction. But she was standing right there.\n\nPerhaps she got too good at her craft.\n\nBut that wasn’t too much of a worry right at this moment. Maybe it was just a coincidence. There was always a logical explanation for everything in Amber’s mind, even in the most outlandish scenarios. There had to be some sort of reason. Regardless, it was a good thing for her, as she never had to deal with the boys in blue or the consequences of her actions for what felt like forever. It was a valuable boon to have for her.\n\nAnd it wasn’t her number one priority anyway, so she did what she always did, and walked off into the night.\n\n----\n\nThe café was overflowing with people, chitter and chatter bouncing off the walls and around the space that Amber was sitting in. She picked up and drank her warm cup of mocha, the chocolatey taste reinvigorating her shivering self. She was reading one of her favorite novels, a love story about a forbidden romance between a human and a demonic beast. It was an emotional, thought-provoking tale about finding love even in the most unexpected places. Amber was always engrossed by how good it was.\n\nIf only she could ever have a story like that. Or any memorable story to tell with someone who loved her.\n\nShe sat there, and kept reading. At the same time, she perked her ears out to listen for anything interesting that could happen. Unfortunately, nothing. Just people having conversation. And her, all alone.\n\nAmber tried to chase for love, but it was always faster. She was sick of wasting away in her bed, with no one to cry with, no one to hold for as long as she could, no one who would listen to her and care for her. She was sick of it all.\n\nDating apps were unpredictable, those were a hard pass. But she couldn’t just walk down the street and randomly ask strangers out on a date. Her options were dwindling as each day passed.\n\nMaybe Amber would be alone forever. Maybe—\n\nShe heard a knock. A knock in front of her, which was most likely the downward motion of a fist on the wooden table. She looked up, to see //her//.\n\nShe was tall, very tall, probably the tallest person that Amber had ever seen. She was also deeply pale, with jet black hair and striking hazel eyes. And she certainly had Amber’s attention, whoever she was.\n\n//Did she come over just for me?// Amber’s brown skin slightly lightened at the thought.\n\nThe mysterious woman smiled with a cryptic allure to her. “Whatcha reading?”\n\nAmber looked around the room nervously. “Uh, a book?”\n\n“No kidding. Now if you’ll let me see what kind,” and she ripped the book out of Amber’s hands and began to examine the cover.\n\nBefore Amber could protest, she gave it back to her. “I think I know that one! Bit cheesy, but it’s got heart.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Of course! I do my fair share of C-tier romance works every now and then. May I have a seat?”\n\n“S-Sure,” Amber stuttered, completely baffled as to how this conversation even happened.\n\nThe mysterious woman immediately took a seat, and stretched out her hand. “Name’s Lucy. It’s nice to meet you.”\n\nAmber reached out her hand, hesitated, then shook it. “Nice to meet you too. I’m Amber.”\n\n“Amber. That’s a lovely name.”\n\nAmber was beet red by now. “Wow, I- Thank you.”\n\n“Can I show you my favorite book?” Lucy asked.\n\n“Sure? I guess that’s fine.”\n\nLucy reached under her chair, and inexplicably pulled out a large, dusty tome with intricate patterns and symbols on the cover. She swiped the dust off, before handing it to Amber.\n\nAmber raised an eyebrow. “The hell is this, the Necronomicon?”\n\n“Close, but not quite. It’s a very important piece of occult literature. Describes all the major facets of magic, and the various deities and demons that walk the earth.”\n\n//So an occultist. Ok, I can deal with that.//\n\nAmber was always a skeptic when it came to the supernatural. Of course, she let people have their fun, but she knew there was always a rational explanation for everything. If ghosts and devils existed like in the movies, surely people would be talking about them all the time like they would to a celebrity, right?\n\nIf these things were truly real, they would populate the earth with wonder and terror and fascination. As they didn’t, of course, exist, the world was molded as the much more boring place that it so obviously was.\n\nIn the deep recesses of her mind, she wanted to be wrong. The world could use more wonder.\n\nShe turned each page, skimming their contents and the secrets that they held. There were plenty of descriptions of demons similar to those depicted in the //Ars Goetia//, and some more that she couldn’t recognize. There were rituals and spells and incantations abound, each one more captivating than the last. There was a section which was a biography of all famous witches, wizards, sorcerers and warlocks ever recorded, known and unknown.\n\nIt was some stellar writing, for a book solely on worldbuilding.\n\nAmber turned to another page, and saw something that caught her eye. The title to this chapter read //Enthrallment//.\n\nLucy eyed her reading through the page, and went up to see what she was looking at. She immediately flipped the book to the next page. “Don’t even //think// about it.”\n\nAmber raised an eyebrow. “What about it?”\n\n“Enthralling people isn’t going to get you anywhere. It’s a waste of time. It brings psychological damage during and after you cast it. You won’t get what you want, and people are going to remember what you did.”\n\n“Whoa whoa, hang on, you actually believe in this stuff?”\n\nLucy feigned an expression of disappointment. “And I thought you were a true believer. Guess I was wrong.”\n\n“I’m not going to judge your beliefs, I just thought… Nevermind.” Amber closed the book.\n\n“You’re fine, I get it. You’re not going to believe me. But there is a hidden world out there, waiting in the shadows. And I’ve seen it all. If you want, I can show you it.” Lucy gave a wide, playful smile.\n\nAmber held up the tome to return it to its sender. “Thanks for the offer, but I’ll think about it.”\n\nLucy gracefully took the book and put it under her shoulder. “Of course. It was nice meeting you, Amber.”\n\nShe turned to leave the café, before suddenly stopping, and turning back around. “Almost forgot.”\n\nShe placed the book on the table, and moved her arms under the chair once more, somehow pulling out a piece of paper and a pen. Amber honestly had no idea how she was doing that. Was it a magic trick?\n\nLucy placed the paper down on the table and started writing something on it, before pulling it up and holding it for Amber to see. It was a phone number.\n\n“Just thought it would be nice for you to have it, if you really do want to talk.”\n\nAmber tried her best to stop herself from turning any redder. “Yeah, yeah, thanks. Thanks.” She quickly snatched the paper and hid it in her pocket.\n\nThey both waved goodbye to each other, going their respective ways. The fact that Amber pulled someone, let alone someone like //her//, it almost felt like a dream. A wonderful dream.\n\nA dream that she will never let go of.\n\n----\n\nAmber pulled the creaking, rickety door to her bedroom open, and immediately landed face first onto her bed, screaming like she just won the lottery. It probably was the equivalent to winning the lottery, for her.\n\nHer love for Lucy could not wait until she got home. She had already texted her a bunch of things, giddily discussing just about everything. Lucy would respond to each text amicably, but Amber could tell that she was happy to be around that ray of sunshine.\n\nShe felt like she could fly above the clouds. She was unstoppable, now. She had everything she wanted. She was on top of the world. Everything that led up to that moment, that electrifying moment in the café, all of it was worth it in the end.\n\nAmber whipped out her phone, and clicked on the group chat with her friends. She couldn’t wait to see their reactions.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **Bippity Boppity Bitches**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Guys\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Guys\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Guys\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Guess what\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** What is it this time?\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** you just lost The Game AHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## Girl you didn’t even try this time\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## Like not even a spoiler\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Still lost it\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** At least people put some modicum of effort with rickrolling\n\n//Ambrosia has just joined Bippity Boppity Bitches!//\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Don’t care, didn’t ask\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** You still lost!\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## Omfg how many times do I have to tell you\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## Put that early-2000s gotcha back where it came from\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Nah, I don’t think I will\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** You’re just mad that you lost\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** Sarah, I swear to Christ\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** everyone shut the fuck up.\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** amber is trying to say something.\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** My bad y’all\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** You are not going to believe what happened to me today :D\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## What, did you steal a Lamborghini or something?\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Nope!\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Got what I always wanted more than anything.\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** No fuckibn way\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Oyu are lying\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** You are lying\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** You are pulling shit straight out of your ass, there’s no way girl\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Yes way, actually!\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Here, I’ll show you proof\n\n//uploaded file meandmybae:3.jpg//\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** congratulations.\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Thank you! :)\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## Holy shit this bitch is tall\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## I bet she can drop kick me to the stratosphere\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** I want her to drop kick me\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** Simping already?

She smiled, grateful for all the support that they always gave to her. She could never ask for better friends.\n\nBut there was one thing left to do. Clicking on the messages app, and scrolling to the person she wanted was now already lighting her stomach on fire. The charges were set, and the detonation was waiting patiently to go off. Any minute now.\n\nShe hesitated, fingers trembling, as she slowly typed what she wanted to say. Her index finger was inches away from the send button. There was no going back now.\n\nShe asked the question only ever thought to reside in her fantasies.\n\n----\n\nIt was a yes.\n\nThe response came almost instantaneously, which surprised Amber, but it filled her heart with warmth, making it flutter faster than ever before.\n\nLucy had instructed her to meet her at an outdoor patio of some random restaurant, half past 9 at night. Normally, in this city meeting with someone  who one barely knew late at night was a huge red flag, but Amber walked late at night often. She knew every street corner and every alleyway by heart. She knew the risks, and this time she’ll gladly take them. This opportunity couldn’t be passed up.\n\nThe crisp, cool breeze flowed through her hair and chilled her skin as she wandered through the darkened streets, with only the silvery light of the moon to guide her way. She passed by dingy corner shops and shadows in alleyways that beckoned her to see what’s on the other side. Of course, what was on the other side would always lead to something lethal, and Amber would much rather keep the counter of her slip-ups on that matter to one.\n\nHer eyes watched every nook and cranny closely, looking out for any signs of danger hiding in the void beyond her. The hairs on the back of her neck stood up, and her gait slowed considerably. She felt like anyone could get her from behind at any time.\n\nShe walked, and walked, and the only thing that made sound around her was her own breathing. One step, another step, then another. And she stopped in her tracks. In front of her was a tall figure, barely visible in the light of the street lamp above it. There was no other path to her destination but forward.\n\nAmber clenched her fists, and prepared for the worst. As she stepped closer, she could see that familiar jet-black hair.\n\nLucy stepped into the light to greet her. “You took longer than I thought.”\n\n“I was being careful, okay? If you’ve ever been in this city as long as I have, you would know.”\n\nShe put a hand on her shoulder. “Of course I know. I’m glad you’re safe. Now let’s go.” She gestured to Amber to follow her, leading the charge while Amber slightly trailed from behind.\n\n“Why did you set this up so we would meet in some random place in the dead of night all alone?” Amber asked.\n\n“Because, we’d be alone together. No distractions, just us.”\n\n“You’re an enigma, you know that? No one else does this.”\n\n“I think it makes it more fun, eh?” Lucy grinned playfully.\n\nAmber laughed, and shook her head. “What did I get myself into.”\n\n“I’ll show you.” She kept walking, with Amber behind her, until they found their destination.\n\nWarm yellow LED lights were strung across the front of the patio cover, giving an inviting and welcoming atmosphere to the place. No one was around, except for Amber and the love of her life. It was the perfect scenario for her to be in, ignoring the fact that it’s near the shadiest parts of the city.\n\n“It’s beautiful.” Amber stared at her surroundings in awe.\n\n“Told you it was worth it.”\n\nThey sat down across from each other, the starry lights twinkling up above, illuminating the space around them and giving a comforting feeling. Amber could feel like herself, here. No more hiding. No more feeling like a statistic. No more worrying about her safety and the safety of her friends. It was just her here, and she was happy.\n\nShe started to stare deeply into Lucy’s hazel eyes. It felt like she could get lost in them. She just stared, and her breathing slowed, as she took in the sight before her, and—\n\nLucy snapped her out of it. “Fallen into a trance already?”\n\nAmber looked away, clearly embarrassed. “Sorry about that.”\n\n“You’re fine, you’re fine. A lot of people always stare. Maybe my eyes are that entrancing.”\n\n“I guess you really weren’t lying with the whole magic thing,” Amber teased.\n\n“Well, what can I say? I know all about it,” Lucy said, before performing a strange hand gesture that Amber hadn’t seen before.\n\nA large, scaled python shot out of Lucy’s left sleeve, and stopped inches away from Amber’s face. It hissed at her as she screamed and nearly fell over.\n\n“How the- what- how??” she exclaimed in shock.\n\n“Magic trick. This is my familiar by the way, his name’s Reggie. Don’t worry, he won’t bite.”\n\nThe snake looked at her with its beady eyes, curious of the strange human sitting before it.\n\n“You’ve got to show me how you do stuff like that.” Amber inhaled sharply.\n\n“I’ll show you more later.” Lucy patted the python on its head, causing it to pull back into the sleeve and the unknown void from whence it came.\n\nThe two sat in silence, the only sound coming from the cold air howling its way through the night. Amber could sense a subtle expression within Lucy, one of regret, a regret that Amber was deeply familiar with. Regret of being a forlorn soul, regret of not having someone to hold onto when you needed them the most.\n\n“Are you okay?” She finally asked.\n\nLucy looked at the street beyond the patio for a moment, with a solemn look in her eyes, before turning back to Amber. “Can I tell you something? It’s very personal to me.”\n\n“Of course! Of course you can. I’m here to talk.”\n\nLucy nodded, before looking directly at Amber. “They said I could never love. They said I could never //be loved//.”\n\nAmber’s heart ached. “What? //Why//? How can someone say that to you?”\n\n“I never felt like I fit in with anyone. Not with my family, they kicked me out the second I didn’t fit in with their values. Not with anyone else, they just see me as something to despise. Something to fear.”\n\n“I know what you’re feeling. I know //exactly// what you’re feeling. But you don’t have to feel alone anymore.” Amber put her hands on top of Lucy’s. They felt surprisingly warm, in spite of the cold weather.\n\n“I wanted it all to stop. So I started searching, until I found you. You were the only one who cared. You were the only one to see me as something more than who I was. Something to love.”\n\nAmber could see the tears forming in her eyes, and so she pulled her closer. “Hey, it’s okay, I’m right here. You’re okay.”\n\nShe was even warmer up close. They held each other for what felt like hours, before Lucy finally pulled away from her, wiping the tears from her eyes.\n\n“Thank you, Amber.” She smiled ruefully.\n\n“I’m always going to be here. I know what it’s like. It’s like no one cares that you’re there. You can stand there and wave in front of their eyes, but they still won’t see you anyway. But we have each other now.”\n\nLucy’s eyes narrowed. “Not caring how, exactly?”\n\n“I don’t know, it’s a little weird, but I don’t think it’s anything to worry about,” Amber dismissed.\n\n“No, no, if it’s something more esoteric, I can probably help you.”\n\n“With your magic tricks?” Amber said sardonically.\n\n“No tricks. Just advice. Whatever it is, I can help you,” Lucy assured her.\n\n“Okay. I think it’s like I’m a ghost. Like I’m invisible to everyone else, but not in the metaphorical sense. It feels more literal. I know that doesn’t make any sense, but I don’t think I can explain it any better.”\n\nLucy slowly nodded in understanding. “Like you’re being forgotten.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah! It is like that.”\n\nLucy seemed to consider something. “I think I can help with that.”\n\n“Wait, really?” Amber asked in disbelief.\n\n“Yes, really. It’s because of our memories.”\n\nLucy straightened her posture, to prepare for her explanation. “I know of a place where all ideas that could be known, //are// known. I also know of a place where ideas that can’t even exist, well, exist. And that is because of you. Because of the collective of humanity itself.”\n\nAmber was completely stupefied. This did not make any sense at all. “It’s a hivemind? Of all human consciousness?”\n\n“That’s only one part of it. It’s all the concepts that can be conceived of by the human mind.”\n\n“Okay, but what does that have to do with me?”\n\n“Memories can be messed around with,” Lucy explained further. “They can be twisted, contorted, and even consumed. I wouldn’t be surprised if the concept of you as a person is slowly being erased by something right now.”\n\nAmber’s eyes widened in abject horror. “Why are you so calm about this? If what you’re saying is true, I’m being //eaten//?”\n\nLucy grabbed her shoulders. “Hey, hey, you’re fine. It’s only happened a few times. And I can reverse it, if you trust me.”\n\nAmber tried to calm down. “I trust you. I do.”\n\n“Then we’ll figure it out together, okay? Whatever it is, we can stop it. I can stop it.”\n\n“I really hope you do. I don’t want my friends to forget me. Or my dad. What about my dad?”\n\n“I promise you, I’ll fix it. Your family isn’t going to forget you. It’s going to be okay,” Lucy said slowly, her hazel eyes keeping Amber grounded from the increasingly bizarre and impossible situation unfolding right in front of her.\n\nLogically, whatever Lucy was saying was complete bogus. But there was no logical explanation for what Amber was going through. And she trusted Lucy well enough now. Perhaps she was too trusting, especially for something that had developed this fast. But if she really was being conceptually eaten from people’s memories, that was an indescribable fate that Amber would not wish upon anyone else.\n\nIf Lucy was right, and she did have something to fix it, Amber would do whatever she says to remove whatever was consuming her. She will not be forgotten.\n\n----\n\nIt had been a few weeks. Lucy was updating her on the progress of her solution to Amber’s inconceivable situation, telling her about something that she had to ‘free completely’ before she could find whatever it was to fix this mess.\n\nAmber, in the meantime, lied down on her bed, scrolling through her phone and chatting with her friends as always. Every once in a while she would get up and go to grab some groceries, the people around her none the wiser as she took a week’s worth of food and walked right out of the store. She intentionally became more obvious, to see how people would react. No one ever did.\n\nOne day, she got too cocky and accidentally bumped into someone while making her exit. They turned to look at her, but their face was blank, stone as a statue. No reaction. Nothing. All Amber could see in those lifeless eyes was indifference.\n\nShe could feel it getting worse. But Lucy had it under control, right? She promised her that everything would work out. And that’s what she would hold onto, that spark of hope, of things turning around, and of Amber finally being able to bask in the light with the love of her life.\n\nAfter another long, excruciating day with nothing happening, Amber immediately flopped onto her bed, turned to face the ceiling, and went back to the group chat to check on her friends.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **Bippity Boppity Bitches**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n//Ambrosia has just joined Bippity Boppity Bitches!//\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** alright everyone.\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** it’s been five years since this chat was created.\n\n**##grey|casanova:##** i think it’s about time that we should celebrate everything that we’ve done together.\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## You’re so right, Cass\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** Wow holy fuck it’s been five years\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** Time flies by fast.\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** 5 years and I still have no bitches…\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** When will this misery end\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** I’m sure you’ll find someone, Sarah!\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** If I can get one, then you can too :)\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## I’m sure you’ll find someone someday\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** I literally just said that, what\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** Idk though, seems like every time I try I get nowhere\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Guys?\n\n**##blue|PaulWasNotTheWalrus:##** It might not feel like it now, but you will find someone who will appreciate you for who you are.\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Hello?\n\n**###096e1d|shaquille_oatmeal:##** I hope you’re right, but the prospects aren’t looking good rn lol\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Why is everyone ignoring me?\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Is this a prank?\n\n##red|CrashTestDummy005:## We’ll be here for you, okay?\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** GUYS\n\n**##yellow|Ambrosia:##** Is this the thing?

Right? She was his daughter. He had to remember.\n\nShe placed the phone up to her ears, heart pounding as the ringtone buzzed into her skull. This couldn’t be happening. It couldn’t, it couldn’t, it //couldn’t//.\n\nThe ringing stopped. “Hello?” The voice on the other side answered.\n\n“Hey, dad, it’s me, Amber. Something’s been happening to me, and I don’t, I don’t know what to do,” Amber whimpered.\n\n“Who the fuck is this?”\n\nHer stomach sank to the floor. “It’s me, dad. Your daughter. Please, you have to remember. It’s me.”\n\n“I don’t have a daughter.” His voice was cold, monotone.\n\nHer heart shattered into a million pieces. “No. No.”\n\n“I’m getting sick of you spam callers. Don’t you have anything better to do?”\n\n“Not you too. No. Please don’t go.”\n\n“Yeah, fuck this.” And the call ended, just like that.\n\nAmber slammed her phone onto the bed several times, but not enough to break it since that was all she had left. She covered her face with her hands and screamed as loud as she could, and began to sob. The worst thing that she feared had come true.\n\nShe cried for what felt like hours until her throat dried up, and her eyes stung from the tears. When she finally collected herself after an eternity of agony, she slowly picked up her phone, hands shaking, to click on Lucy’s contact and call her.\n\nThe phone rang, and rang, and rang. It rang for so long that Amber thought Lucy forgot her too. She was almost about to cry again, when she heard the dial tone, and a familiar voice spilled out from the other end.\n\n“Amber? You okay?” Lucy asked in concern.\n\nAmber tried to say something, but nothing came out. Her mouth quivered, before she finally managed to speak. “It happened. They don’t know me anymore.”\n\nThe silence in the room was deafening.\n\n“I’m sorry, Amber. I’m just about done. I can fix it. I’ll text you my address, and you can come over. We’ll fix this together.”\n\n“You better be right. I’m counting on you.” And she cut Lucy off, ending the call.\n\nAmber felt the rising fire in her stomach, the sickening pit deepening inside it, but she didn’t care. She had to get out of this. She was not going to give up, because she was the match to start the fire, she was the weed that grew in concrete, she was a survivor. She will not let herself be forgotten.\n\nShe ran down the stairs, and rushed to get all her belongings before heading out to face the unseen entity ruining her life. As she swiftly pulled her shoes on her feet and hurried to the door, she heard a noise. A crackle, like static. Amber turned, and went toward the strange sound.\n\nIt came from her kitchen. What looked like her dad’s old radio was somehow on the kitchen counter, static continuously emanating from the speaker grille. She didn’t remember picking it up from her dad. Why was it even there?\n\nAmber slowly inched her way to the radio in caution, incredulous at the sight before her. It didn’t make sense, but at this point nothing made sense to her, so she made logic sit aside for the moment. Her hands slowly reached for the dial, then hesitated. If this radio was another trick, another way for whatever this phenomenon was to taunt her, it wouldn’t be wise to mess with the radio.\n\nBut curiosity got the better of her, and so she turned a knob of the radio for a hair, just to see what would happen.\n\nNothing happened. The radio was still there, static spilling out of it like an ancient, broken radio would normally do. Amber shrugged, and turned to leave—\n\nBut there was something else. Something faint coming from the radio. It sounded like a song from the 30s or 40s, something that Vera Lynn would sing for the American soldiers in Bengal or some other place. It had an ethereal feel to it, the brass and the strings working in tandem to slowly lull Amber into the sound and fully envelop her.\n\nAnd then, she heard singing. She didn’t recognize the singer, nor their gender, it sounded like the voice could go either way. But it was very monotone, and drew Amber further into the  lumbering, pacifying music that sweetly reminded her not to run, not to be scared, but to just relax.\n\n//You’ve seemed to lost your way//\n\n//But you will be okay//\n\n//I’ll give you life//\n\n//Along with mine//\n\n//And we’ll all see the light//\n\n//Don’t you cry, my dear//\n\n//Your future may not be near//\n\n//But just take my hand//\n\n//And let me give//\n\n//A life you will be remembered by//\n\nShe heard the static grow louder. Something was wrong. Very wrong.\n\n//I will not be forgotten//\n\n//And neither will you//\n\n//Just give in//\n\n//And be mine//\n\nA purple vine shot out from behind the radio, seemingly from nowhere, and wrapped itself around it, pulsating a deep indigo and slowly crushing the radio to pieces.\n\nThe static grew louder and louder, and as it got to the point where the sound became ear-splitting the radio suddenly shattered into a million bits and bolts, and a voice from an indeterminable source began to cackle throughout the house.\n\nAmber booked out the door, not looking back.\n\n----\nShe ran through the busy streets, the dark alleyways and the snow-covered paths, and never stopped to look over her shoulder or take a break. This was life or death, now. There was only one thought circulating in her mind. To survive. She had to survive.\n\nLucy’s house was deep into the center of the city, and far from where Amber was, but she didn’t care if that meant her ankles would burn the whole way or her legs felt like they would melt off. She had to live, even if out of spite, even if the whole world was against her. She had to live.\n\nIt felt like her whole body was about to collapse, when she saw the little brick house up the road, with some spooky Halloween decorations all over the lawn even though it’s been months since then. The decorations were very well-put together and well-placed around the lawn to the point that nothing looked off-center, which surprised Amber.\n\nMaybe that’s why they weren’t taken down yet, so that the neighbors could marvel on the display for all to see.\n\nBut there was no time for gawking. She ran up to the door and pounded on it as hard as she could. Strangely, it sounded more muffled than she thought, so she looked down at her right hand.\n\nAmber could see the floor through her whole arm.\n\nShe pounded on the door even harder, screaming Lucy’s name as loud as she could in desperation. It couldn’t end here. Not like this. Not now. Not—\n\nThe door immediately slammed open, and an arm reached out to yank Amber by the collar. The door then somehow closed itself behind her, leaving her in complete darkness. Before she could protest, a lighter flicked on, revealing a familiar face in front of her.\n\n“Come on, we don’t have time,” Lucy said with a strangely stern and troubled tone of voice.\n\nAs they walked to wherever Lucy was going, Amber called out to her from behind. “Where are we going? What the hell is happening to me?”\n\nLucy turned to look at her, but only briefly. “I can see it now. It’s here, and it’s //choking you//.”\n\n“Wh— what the fuck? What does that even mean?”\n\n“If you want to live, then stop asking questions and follow me.”\n\nShe turned back to walk through the darkness, and Amber reluctantly followed behind. She had no idea what was going to happen, and that frightened her, but not as much as whatever was consuming her.\n\nShe had to believe that Lucy had finally figured out the cure to her affliction. That was their promise to each other.\n\nLucy eventually made it to a door, then opened it to reveal a staircase descending down into the depths.\n\nShe turned back to Amber one last time. “Do you trust me?”\n\nShe took her hand. “I do.”\n\nThey went down the steps together, hand in hand, with a bond that could never be broken.\n\nWhen they reached the last step and turned the final corner, Amber saw what looked to be a large ritual circle, with hundreds of candles arranged neatly and intricately to serve as the structure. There were several decorations like the ones outside, but their hollow eyes were alight with a fiery red color, and they looked worse for wear than their counterparts. It all felt very foreboding.\n\n“You sure this’ll work out?” Amber questioned.\n\n“Yes. I believe it will. And so will you.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“This ritual is powered by belief. It’s how you’ll be remembered, as long as you believe yourself to be real. And as long as I do as well. I still remember,” Lucy explained.\n\nAmber nodded. “Okay, okay. Just have to believe. Okay.”\n\nThey stepped into the circle at the same time, and as they stepped in it the candles all suddenly went out, leaving the room to only be lit up by the decorations around them. Lucy turned her lighter off as well, leaving them in almost pitch-black darkness.\n\n“Now, take my hands and close your eyes.”\n\nAmber complied, and Lucy began to whisper a chant in some language that she had never heard of, possibly Latin. She felt her hair begin to stand up, the air around her charged with an electric, mystical power that she could feel in her chest. She felt a change inside of her, her heart bursting with a newfound energy, making her feel full again. It was working.\n\nThen she fell.\n\nShe didn’t know why, but she opened her eyes to see the basement in complete chaos. Purple sparks flew all around the room, and Amber could see Lucy scream at something to go away. There was something else about her that completely baffled Amber. There were two horns of a ram that curved from behind her ears and curled in the shape of a hook.\n\nMagical energy buzzed around her, before everything stopped in place. Lucy turned to look at her, and her eyes were glowing a deep vermillion.\n\n“What are you?” Amber finally managed to speak out.\n\nLucy reached her arm down to her. “My name is Lucifer.”\n\nAmber’s eyes widened in complete shock. There was nothing else to say.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking. But this is not a trick. I love you, Amber. Genuinely. I can’t go back there. I can’t. So I needed someone to believe in me, but not through any kind of spell or incantation. I wanted real love. I wanted you.”\n\n“W-why?” Amber’s hands started to shake.\n\n“Because you’re the only person who’s looked at me and saw someone to love for. I can save you.”\n\n“That isn’t true. You just wanted to get to me. Do you really even care? No one knows me anymore. I’m going to be erased forever, and everyone else is going to move on without me.”\n\nLucy put a hand on her shoulder. “I know you. And I care. You will live, just as long as you believe in me.”\n\n“What about my family? What about my friends? Can you make them remember me? //Can you//?” Amber snapped.\n\n“I can hold the absence off permanently, but reversing it is another question entirely. But we can figure it out together.”\n\n“What the hell even is this absence?” Amber pressed her.\n\n“It’s something that wants to be remembered, so it feeds off vulnerable people, those that are more likely to be forgotten by most. Over the centuries it’s only erased a few individuals, and covered up the evidence. But for the past few months more and more people are succumbing to it.”\n\n“//What//? Are you saying that I’m not the only one affected by this thing?”\n\n“Yes. You are correct,” Lucy confirmed to her.\n\n“We’ve got to help them!” Amber exclaimed.\n\n“They’ll be fine, I’ll get to them when I get to them. But you’re the number one priority right now. Once we get it off you, we’ll fix the rest.”\n\n“How will I know that you’ll really do that?”\n\nShe took a deep breath. “Look, Amber. I can give you the stars. The sun, the moon, all are under my seal. I can do anything, as long as there’s someone with me to believe in my power. What we have that this absence doesn’t is belief. Belief for each other, belief that everything will work out in the end. We remember the people that we believe in, and forget those that we don’t. It’s either me, or complete annihilation. Your choice.”\n\nAll Amber could hear now was the crackle of the sparks still hanging in the air. “Just promise me that you’ll fix it. My family, my friends, other people who are suffocating because of this thing. All of it.”\n\nLucy stared at her, arm still stretched out. “I promise.”\n\nShe took her hand.\n\nThe room exploded in bright orange and yellow, candles erupting in flame, decorations melting into sludge. Lucy pulled Amber in close, and she could feel her heart pounding in excitement. She could feel her own heart beat in tandem with hers.\n\nLucy felt warm, like a soft blanket wrapped around to comfort her. Maybe everything will work out. Maybe it would all be okay, with her.\n\nAmber heard the cracking of bone, and looked to see two large wings extending out of Lucy’s back.\n\n“Are you ready?” Lucy asked her one last time.\n\n“Yeah, go ahead,” she said, her face completely flushed from endearment.\n\nLucy hoisted her up, and princess carried her as they both flew up to crash through the roof. They soared through the sky, completely unfazed by the metal roof that they just broke out of. Amber looked down at the city below her in awe, and noticed that her hand was as solid as it always was. She wiggled her fingers to make sure it was still there.\n\nShe might not ever be the same again, but she was alive. She still had hope in her heart, a hope that she will finally reunite with her friends and her dad, a hope that others like her will live to see the light and not have to worry about fighting for their continued existence, a hope that things will change for the better. But hope is not enough. Amber needed that hope, that drive, but she also needed to act. So that’s what she’s going to do, now. Take action for a brighter future, with someone who will do anything for her.\n\nShe looked up at her again, to stare fondly at those alluring hazel eyes. Behind her was the now blood-red moon, casting a dark shadow over them that definitely made this night one to remember.\n\n“Is anyone going to spot us?” Amber asked.\n\n“Most likely not. I’ve made it so that they’ll never see me unless I want them to. I doubt they’ll ever spot you, either. Unless those memetic freaks try to find us. But they don’t stand a chance against me.”\n\nAmber grinned. “Against us.”\n\n“Yes, my dear.” She smiled back. “Us.”\n\nThey flew all around the city, through the clouds, just being themselves and laughing all the way. Amber wished for better days, but here and now, she was free.\n\nMaybe together they will change everything, and finally vanquish the attention-starved boogeyman out to get her. Together, they will survive.\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
