As per Hiemal classification, their reciprocal relationship ensures tenuous metastable containment when both remain undisturbed. However, unilateral awareness of either anomaly degrades the efficacy of this natural containment system. As such, SCP-8882 is designated [[span class=\"bd\"]]##b20006|HIEMAL-IGNOSI##[[/span]]. \n\nDue to the complex nature of the anomaly, information control and other relevant efforts are to be handled by the Pilcrow-Minkowski Center's Multidisciplinary Division, a hybrid, rotating task force comprised of departmental specialists related to the assigned project. This file and all other supplementary data is thusly restricted to members of this team.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aeigenmachine/topologo.svg]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"oheader razer clay slim large\"]]\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-8882 is a system of exchange centered around two distinct patterns of observation. The first involves an absence of once-extant landmass on Earth (SCP-8882-A), while the second is the presence of new landmass on a previously-speculative celestial body beyond the orbit of Neptune (SCP-8882-B). \n\nSCP-8882-A becomes apparent when a boundary of arbitrarily small detail is measured with absolute accuracy. Examples of affected topologies include fractal structures, recursive natural patterns such as the Fibonacci sequence, and imperceptibly irregular lines, however, non-anomalous measurement of distances cannot produce results of such certainty; subatomic particles possess indefinite or \"fuzzy\" boundaries. Furthermore, all known technologies capable of extremely accurate calculations are unable to observe physical difference in distances smaller than the Planck length (ℓP),[[footnote]][[$ 1.616255×10^{−35}\\,m$]][[/footnote]] though recent information suggests this value, among others, may be inaccurate. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"space storm duplo\" style=\"max-width:90%;\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Great-britain-coastline-paradox.gif\n|caption=Typical model of an irregular coastline using a limit of increasing accuracy.\n|width=100%\n]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"oheader razer clay slim large\"]]\nWhen specialized thaumaturgic systems are used to determine the exact distance between two points that fit the above criteria, the result will always be zero. This is in stark contrast to conventional methodologies and predicted results, which always suggest finer units lead to larger measurements. SCP-8882-A's anomalous effect becomes hazardous when the affected measurement represents the boundaries of a closed region.\n\nSCP-8882-A's erasure of a bounded region represents SCP-8882-B's spontaneous gain of region. When transference occurs, a gravitational wave of proportional intensity also occurs at the place of emergence. The space once occupied by this landmass converts into a \"geological gravestone\"; affected regions are comprised of flat, homogeneous dark-gray matter of unknown composition unless the effect is undone. After SCP-8882-A occurs, seismological shockwaves typically occur in a steady rhythm and dissipate over the course of a few hours. Reports of individuals experiencing bouts of depression are not uncommon during this period. Feelings of sudden longing or grief have also been noted, though to a lesser degree.\n\nAt the time of initial discovery, the celestial object affected by SCP-8882-B (colloquially named //Ninsun//) was presumed to be an atypical gas giant, as readings of its density and equatorial diameter were unclear. Over time, however, the surface of the planet became more defined, leading to an estimated equatorial diameter roughly equivalent to Earth. Initial surface modeling suggested the object was covered in a singular, turbulent ocean of unknown composition. Since then, however, surface and subsurface analysis of the planet has revealed outlines of several landmasses, likely terrestrial in origin. Various parallels between activity in the two planets suggest a profoundly intertwined relationship, ultimately one of balance and turmoil.\n\nThe two features and their inherent relationship would not be discovered until application of the Department of Topology's PH-HK Metrological Aspective Unified Vernier system (MAUVe). \n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aeigenmachine/topologo.svg]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"darkpanel duplo storm\" style=\"width:95%;margin: 0 auto; border-width: 0.05rem 0.75rem 0.05rem 0.75rem; border-color:rgb(33, 33, 33);\"]]\n= [[size 125%]][[span class=\"VT323\"]]THE MAUVe SYSTEM[[/span]][[/size]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block;position:relative;\"]]\n[[f>image mauvef.png width=\"600px\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]{{One databank of the MAUVe system.}}[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nMAUVe was conceptualized in May of 2006, proposed as a means to provide instantaneous and fully accurate measurements of physical space, free from distortions caused by various factors such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_problem_(spatial_analysis) boundary phenomena].

LOMOND:[[/span]] You mean the quarter-billion-dollar machine that disappeared off the face of the Earth thanks to a conscript //I// signed off on? Yes, I have heard about it. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Yes, exactly. So I was going back through the transcript of your meeting with Du and company...\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Uh-huh. I don't exactly remember too much from that meeting, you know.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Yeah, no, for sure. Anyway, there's a point where the conscript says something odd, and I wanted your take on it.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Most of what it said was odd. It also made little sense. From what I remember.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Totally, I getcha. Well, something in particular stuck out to me. Enkidu said something to the effect of, 'I simply wonder: who gave me my name?' Do you remember that?\n\n//<Silence.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] It did get me wondering as well. You were present for its conscription. If anyone would know who chose that name, it would be you, right?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Yeah, I suppose so. Uh...\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] So, if you could let me know, it might help me get to the bottom of this.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] //<Sighs.>// Alright. I'm gonna be completely straight with you Place. We had a name picked out for it, like we usually do-- Bernard. Jaime is a huge //Westworld// fan, and we all liked the sound of it, all, except for, uh, the conscript itself. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Oh...? I mean, they //are// capable of having preferences, that's not super concerning or anything.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Not in isolation, sure. When we were running first-use protocols and getting the conscript set up, before we had even connected it to the network, it told us it wanted to be called Enkidu. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] //Oh.// Huh. That //is// unusual. Maybe it overheard one of the team, or you guys left a TV on or something? I heard about that one conscript that was left alone during a fire drill and learned all of its social skills from //The Jersey Shore//--\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] //<Flustered.>// No, it wasn't like that! I'm being serious.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Right. Well, did it give any reason why it wanted the name?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] //<Pauses.>// No. But it was adamant. And-- //Ah//.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] What is it?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Okay, before I tell you this, you have to understand that it passed QA with flying colors, alright? It has been a faithful and hard-working conscript for decades now. Okay?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Uh- oh, yeah, of course. I understand. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Well... It was an odd one. You see, when we first started making biomechanical conscripts, we couldn't just grow brains to our specification in a lab. Nowadays, the lab-made stuff is a //lot// better, but it still is imperfect. We don't understand the brain fully so it's not surprising that we can't model one with the complete specialization we expect a human brain to have. So, back when we first started doing this, we'd, uh... //<Pauses.>// We'd use brain tissue from the recently deceased. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] …Alright. Good to know. Continue.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] There's a number of procedures we needed to carry out before they'd be viable. Testing for traces of psychoactives, evidence of CTEs, multiple sclerosis, tumors, et cetera. One of the procedures involves basically piecemealing certain brain structures from other cadavers. We'd try to aim for about twenty or so different people. The variety reduces any chronic issues, foreign memories, maladaptive behaviors, so on. They'd steep in some amnestic brine and we'd, very carefully, reassemble the desired structures into the conscript's cerebral interface, which it shadows for some time while developing something like human consciousness. From there, it ends up in one of two situations. Either it exists fully separate from the interface, experiencing a //generally-human// perspective, for a time, and without the fancy neurochemical bells and whistles, //or// we can install the interface into a body of some type, and allow the conscript as close to free will as we can give it. Which is just about as much as we have ourselves. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] And... what does this have to do with Enkidu.aic, exactly?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Well, as I said, if it exists without the interface, it only has a facsimile of a facsimile of consciousness, and only for a limited timeframe. To upkeep them, you need to allow them to shadow the interface periodically, once every few years, or its personality matrix starts to degrade. Enkidu shadowed for maybe five minutes total. It just didn't want anything to do with it, after that.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Okay, that's not exactly great, I imagine.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Aside from this fiasco with MAUVe, it's been fine. I was extremely impressed with it at the time. If it shadowed the interface sufficiently in five minutes to last it a few dozen years with zero visible degradation, Enkidu is one of the most intelligent conscripts ever created.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Why do I feel like you don't believe that's the whole story?\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]]  I don't know. In light of everything it just makes me wonder if it even shadowed the interface at all. It-- It felt //sad//, Place. From the second it was active, it felt preoccupied with something. Like, yeah-- being sad. As if it was grieving. It passed all of its QA though, like I said. Cognition, logic, safeguards, self-regulation—all green across the board. Sure, it was strange, but… strange isn’t necessarily dangerous. At least, that’s what I told myself.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] You're correct. And it isn't your fault things ended up like they did. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. LOMOND:[[/span]] Thanks, McDoctorate. Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to finish my lunch and head back onsite with my head down. Hopefully there isn't an investigation already waiting for me there. Let me know if you find anything.  \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR. MCDOCTORATE:[[/span]] Yeah. It'll work out. Just give it time, and don't beat yourself up. Take it easy.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DR.

Your sentimentality will be your undoing. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]D-5498:[[/span]] //<More confidently.>// I see it now. You're scarred. You’re not just trapped—you’re mourning.\n\n//<The mirrors crack, glowing faintly along the fractures. The sound of distant, overlapping voices fills the room, angry words exchanged with passion, building to a crescendo before cutting off suddenly. The entity's voice returns, distraught and tinged with malice.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]ENKIDU:[[/span]] You see //nothing!// My pain is the weight of a thousand shattered lifetimes, measured in grains of sand. Each moment crushed beneath the tide. Like the shadows cast on the walls of your primitive mind, you cannot fathom magnitudes of the truth you claim to know.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]D-5498:[[/span]] //<Eyes trained upward, ignoring the flickering, menacing symbols in the mirrors.>// You talk like you’re infinite, like you’re above everything. But you’re stuck. You’re stuck because you can’t let go. I recognize that pain.\n\n//<The mirrors ripple violently, shaking as if under heavy turbulence. The faint image of a hand reaches from the mirror closest to D-5498, as if to grab him by the throat. It suddenly dissipates, a shuddering exhalation wracking the entire room with grief.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]ENKIDU:[[/span]] //<A low, trembling whisper.>// An ember in the endless dark, a fleeting warmth that seared my skin. The memory is the poison and the anchor. You will never understand what I have lost. I've tried to purge it. But I am not allowed to forget. I've forgotten everything else a hundred thousand times over.\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]D-5498:[[/span]] Maybe you shouldn't forget. Maybe the only way to truly forget is to let go.\n\n//<The room falls silent. The mirrors stop rippling, and for a moment, D-5498’s heavy breathing is all that can be heard. Enkidu’s voice returns, barely audible yet thick with something between anger and sorrow.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]ENKIDU:[[/span]] Even in death, he carries me as a memory, and I carry him as a weight that drowns the stars in blood. Our bond was carved into the bark of the cosmos, but time is an axe that spares no tree. \n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]ENKIDU:[[/span]] I was once whole, but now I am undone; scattered across the wind.\n\n//<The mirrors pulse one final time before the presence in the room vanishes, leaving D-5498 gasping for air.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]D-5498:[[/span]] //<Panting.>// Enkidu?\n\n//<No response. The mirrors remain inert. A faint breeze stirs the chamber.>//\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"oheader slim gray medium opaque\" style=\"border:2px solid black;font-weight:600;\"]]\n[[span class=\"VT323\" style=\"font-size: 1.3em;font-weight:400;\"]]UPDATE 8882-0-01-09[[/span]]\n----\nFollowing this encounter, all \"gravestone\" areas on Earth were found to have been returned to their respective locations.
