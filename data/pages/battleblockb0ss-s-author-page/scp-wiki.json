I'm BattleblockB0ss, but feel free to call me simply Battle, Block, or Battleblock. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzbnxH_GNmM Just don't call me late for dinner!][[footnote]]This is a joke. I am often late for dinner. Believe nothing I say, for I have sold my soul for comedy and I won't hesitate to sell yours too.[[/footnote]] I'm just a writer, videoer[[footnote]]NOTE TO SELF: Find the actual word for someone that makes creative videos before publishing this.[[/footnote]] graphic designer, procrastinator, and all around creator on this site. I love SCPs utilizing alternative forms of media and interactivity, as well as those that entail excessive mindfuckery[[footnote]]Bullshit brainshenannigans are also acceptable.[[/footnote]] (both anomalous in nature and not). I'm also a huge fan of disturbing and generally fucked up articles.\n\nOutside of the SCP Wiki, one of my chief interests is indie games, which I will happily discuss at length. If anyone ever wants to have a conversation about game design or just games in general, feel free to PM me, find me on IRC, or DM me on Discord.[[footnote]]BattleblockB0ss#7148[[/footnote]] Aside from indie games, my interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to):\n* Undertale\n* Deltarune\n* Homestuck[[footnote]]I'm sorry.[[/footnote]]\n* Piano composition/playing\n* Music[[footnote]]In one of my punk phases at the moment.[[/footnote]]\n* Voice acting\n* Video production\n* Reading[[footnote]]As you may have guessed.[[/footnote]]\n* Cosplay\n* Pokemon[[footnote]]Not the games, but the TCG. Or the anime. Both are near and dear to my heart.[[/footnote]]\n* Photography\n* Game development\n\nAs I've said, I would be more than happy to have a conversation about any one of these topics[[footnote]]Or anything else, really. Just give me attention. I feed off of it. I am an insatiable parasite, constantly latching onto the lifeforces of those who talk to me and slowly leeching away at their energy, claiming their lives for my own. And you could be next :)[[/footnote]], so don't hesitate to strike one up. I love making friends!\n----\n\n[[=]]\n+ Favorite Hubs\n[[/=]]\nHere are the hubs of some of my favorite series, canons, and groups of interest for your viewing pleasure.\n\n[[=]]\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub Antimemetics Division]\nOne of the first series I ever read on the site, and it had me HOOKED. Would definitely recommend for those who don't mind being very confused.\n\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-hub Gamers Against Weed]\nThis is the first GoI I got into, and it's one that I feel is pretty relatable to most people. Except for, you know, the anomalous parts.\n\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/are-we-cool-yet-hub Are We Cool Yet?]\nThe combination of simple brutality, deep emotional connection, and just plain creativity that some of these pieces possess just hit exactly the right note for me.\n\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/arcadia-hub Arcadia]\nAs previously mentioned, I'm a huge fan of games. While I'm not usually a fan of devilish deals and tormented souls, Arcadia presents the often-overdone trope in a way that has me devouring every article I can find.\n\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/apotheosis-hub Apotheosis]\nFor the longest time I'd heard \"apotheosis\" mentioned in the errant article on the wiki, but I had no clue what it was referring to. I finally got around to reading this canon and, WOW, it's excellent. While much smaller than some more popular canons, it has some magnificent articles.\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+ Favorite Articles\n[[/=]]\nHere are some of my all-time favorite individual articles. I'm sure I'll add to this as time goes on, but here are some to start with.\n[[=]]\n++ SCPs\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6041 SCP-6041 - Chicken Little's Requiem]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2293 SCP-2293 - An Inside Joke]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4205 SCP-4205 - In The Eyes Of The Beholder]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6108 SCP-6108 - Schlemo's Wholesale]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2639 SCP-2639 - Video Game Violence]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5732 SCP-2639 - And I'm Thinking of What Sarah Said]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3078 SCP-3078 - Cognitohazardous Shitpost]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6869 SCP-#### - The sad man]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5392 SCP-5392 - The Voyage of the Tachyon Express]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp-001 CODE NAME: D.

This by no means exhaustive, just some special people who stick out to me.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ [[*user Agente Shuffle]]\n+++ [[[Agente Shuffle's Art Page]]]\n[[/=]]\nAgente Shuffle (or IDMNS as he's sometimes known) is an incredibly talented artist and writer. Even with the struggles of being a non-native English speaker he consistently produces stunning and evocative articles, not even to speak of the countless pieces of art he's created [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:remember-to-stalk (including a spinoff of my own piece!)] I'd absolutely recommend checking out his artwork page and other articles. I feel deeply honored to have written with such a talented individual during the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-contest 2022 Department Contest] on the Telecommunications Monitoring Office! Speaking of the TMO, that brings us to\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ [[*user Meserach]]\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/meserach Meserach's Author Page]\n[[/=]]\nMeserach is frankly one of the best writers on the site (in my opinion). Every article she writes is a veritable work of art and despite the scarcity of articles, the votes speak for themselves. Meserach is the mind behind [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/introductionfilm Picture This] and the inspiration for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:say-it-with-me-everybody \"Say it with me everybody\"]. I hope they stick around on the wiki for a while, and I speak truly when I say they are one of my inspirations. I can't thank her (or Shuffle) enough for helping me plunge into the site when I joined her team during Department Con.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ [[*user GlassAutomaton]]\n+++ [[[GlassAutomaton's Author Page]]]\n[[/=]]\nWhile a new writer on the wiki, GlassAutomaton is a very skilled writer, effortlessly maintaining a clinical tone while at the same time striking emotional chords deep within readers. In [[[SCP-6703]]], he manages to do one of my favorite things to see on the wiki, and do it well: make an SCP relatable. To expound, GlassAutomaton excels in showing us how Foundation jobs can be synonymous with real-world, boring, office jobs while keeping the mystical, unusual, and just plain weird tone surrounding every aspect of the Foundation's work. I highly recommend checking out his articles, and I hope to see much much more from him in the future.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+ Achievements\n[[include component:sybadge code=tsf]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=scl]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=gsa]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=apf]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=lgbt]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=dado]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+ Leave a Message!\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nHere's an example quote/message, feel free to leave one of your own!\n[[>]]\n//- BattleblockB0ss, seeking attention from anyone who'll give it//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nCalled them for dinner, was late, highly disappointed.

In the case that he's also gone, I leave everything to [[*user Glassautomaton]]. If they're both gone, [[*user FishAteMe]] inherits it all.
