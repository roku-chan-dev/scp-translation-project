Upon discovery, all data containing SCP-2753 is to be destroyed. Anyone outside of Foundation personnel aware of SCP-2753 is to be apprehended, interrogated, and amnesticized.\n\nInstances of SCP-2753-A are to be kept disassembled in a secure locker on-site. Instances of SCP-2753-B and SCP-2753-C are to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Tests are prohibited at this time.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2753 is a 3 dimensional ratio that can be used to describe the relationship between the sides of a block.\n\nInstances of SCP-2753-A are blocks which match SCP-2753's projection within a certain threshold; they can otherwise be of any size and material. They exhibit their anomalous property only when 42 instances of similar size and material are assembled into a standard Jenga[[footnote]]Jenga is a game wherein blocks are assembled into a tower; players then take turns removing blocks and placing them on top while trying to avoid a collapse.[[/footnote]] tower: If this tower collapses, any structure containing it will immediately collapse with it. \n\nSince 2009, the growing popularity and accuracy of 3D printing combined with SCP-2753's presentation within OBJ files[[footnote]]OBJ is a geometry definition file format used as instructions for many commercially available 3D printers.[[/footnote]] as a printable Jenga set has led to 21 structural collapses, 35 injuries, and 14 deaths.\n\n**Addendum 2753.1:** Incidents\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/2753/incidents/007.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n> = **INCIDENT LOG**\n> ----\n> **DATE:** 1988/07/07\n> **SUBJECT:** SCP-2753-A\n> ----\n> The collapse of a warehouse used to host the Boston Anomalous Art Expo[[footnote]]The Boston Anomalous Art Expo (BAAE) is an underground art exposition dedicated to sharing works from various anartists.[[/footnote]] was linked to an instance of SCP-2753-A. 14 additional anomalous objects (including [[[SCP-1433]]], an instance of [[[SCP-1617]]], and [[[project-proposal-1994-103|SCP-████]]]) were also recovered amidst the wreckage. The collapse left over 49 participants injured and 21 dead. The following note was discovered nearby:\n> \n>> How High Can High Art Get?
