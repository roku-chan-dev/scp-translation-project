I have no idea who would buy a piece of shit like that, but apparently this guy has customers- that's how we reached him, after all. So, the item:  \n\nUI-56 is a novelty sword made of cheap, recycled metal (mostly aluminum). According to the box we found it in, it's an \"Uncle Merl's Durendal Mark III™\". There was a  pamphlet in the box with it, with some sort of bullshit about what this thing does. I copied it here: \n\n> Are you tired of living in a callous, uncaring modern world? Do you wish to return to the old days of chivalry and honor? Now, with the Durendal Mark III™ , Paladin's Delight (Ultra light! With patented Dragon Grip!)\", you can!

By opening this box, the user waives any right to sue Uncle Merl's Discount Emporium and releases said company of all liability to his/her's medical expenses.  \n> \n> **Replacement hilts are available in gold, silver, black, and hot pink. \n\nWe tried doing some tests on the thing before the spooks took it away. Didn't manage much, but that's hardly new. We wouln't have gotten anything at all if it wasn't for the volunteers.  I'm adding Dr. Charles' and Dr. Demagne's notes from the lab: \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Test UI-56-1\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n> \n> **Researchers:** Dr. Charles (reporting), Dr. Demagne\n> \n> **Test subject:** Agent Carlson \n> \n> **Test:** I placed Agent Carlson in a room with an out-of-order vending machine, gave him UI-56 and told him to buy a drink after speaking the \"magic words\" written on the back of the pamphlet (Latin, \"Qui utitur hoc pharse est stultus\"). The following result was recorded: \n> \n> **Agent Carlson:** [inserts coin into the machine] Ah, soon the cool taste of this godly nectar will fill my mouth with heavenly delight!  \n> \n> [The machine does not produce the requested drink]\n> \n> **Agent Carlson:** [visibly upset] What's this!? Ye knavish contraption! You shall dispense my drink forthright, and allow me to taste its frosty secrets, or you shall taste my cold steel! \n>  \n> [The threat appears ineffective] \n> \n> **Agent Carlson:** So, thou wishest to face my might?! So be it, fiend! This shall be our final confrontation, a battle to shake the very foundations of the Earth, that will bring fear to the gods themselves! I will rip the sky asunder, cleave the ancient mountains like cheese paper! You will taste my wrath! Have at ye! \n> \n> [Agent Carlson proceeds to attack the vending machine. UI-56 can't penetrate the vending machine, so he uses it as a blunt instrument. After attacking the machine for thirty minutes without results (other than mild denting), Agent Carlson collapses to the floor, exhausted.\n> \n> **Agent Carlson:** I... I have failed. My ancestors peer at me from their lordly seats in disapproval and shame. If I cannot have victory, I shall have honorable death! Farewell, my unclaimed drink! My only regret is that I failed to save you from the clutches of this rectangular devil. Loyal sword, serve your master one last time.  \n> \n> [Agnet Carlson removes his shirt and attempts to fall on UI-56. UI-56 fails to penetrate Agent Carlson's skin, leaving him unharmed save for minor bruising. Test concluded. Agent Carlson suffers no lasting effects, other than a self-proclaimed desire for \"silk pantaloons\". \n\nMy hypothesis is that UI-56 posses mild mind-affecting proportions, causing subjects using it to experience trivial disputes as confrontations of the highest importance.  UI-56 also seems to cause subjects to speak in what they perceive as medieval-like language, and makes them cocky too. It's a strange one, no doubt. \n\nDr. Charles \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Test Log UI-56-2\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n> **Research personnel:** Dr. Charles, Dr. Demagne (reporting)\n>  \n> **Test subjects:** Agent Ricks (male), Agent Chan (female)\n>  \n> **Test:** In an attempt to verify UI-56's influence over women, I instructed Agent Ricks (who has a notably poor vocabulary) to hold the sword and speak the words, then introduced him to Agent Chan. The following result was recorded: \n>  \n> **Agent Ricks:** Do my eyes misguide my, or do I see an extra fine maiden in this here chamber?\n> \n> **Agent Chan:** What is he talking about? \n> \n> **Agent Ricks:** Come now, don't be shy! Yon bitch knows this knight has all the right gear!\n>  \n> **Agent Chan:** Did you just call me a bitch!?\n>  \n> **Agent Ricks** No need to be upset, my petite kumquat. Come, there is a great water serpent in my breeches, and it requires your attention! \n> \n> [Agent Chan then grappled with Agent Ricks and removed UI-56 from his grasp. She attempted to use UI-56 to harm Agent Ricks in a highly inappropriate manner (in my humble opinion), before security personnel intervened. UI-56 was returned to storage, Agent Chan was reprimanded, and Agent Ricks was escorted to the infirmary]\n\nI really don't know what to tell you about this one, Laura. It's a sword that makes you act like a pseudo-medieval asshole, as far as I can tell. Where do you even get this stuff?  \n\nDr. Demagne. \n\n[[/collapsible]]  \n  \n\nWe also found a coupon with with the pamphlet and UI-56, saying it was for a free tutorial tape. We sent for one and it arrived a few days later, starring no other than two of the clowns we captured during the raid. The spooks came and took that too, but I did manage to write a transcription of it beforehand: \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Recorded Log\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n[Camera opens to what appears to be a mail room. A figure enters the frame, wearing long robes, a pointed hat, and a flower-patterned tie. That's Daniel Monroe, though he likes to be called Danerius. He claims to be a Luxomancer, though I have no idea what that's supposed to mean] \n\n**Dan:** Greetings, aspiring knights! Today, I, Danerius the Magnificent, will be your guide to the realm of the arcane! Let us begin. [to someone off-camera] minion, bring forth the Sword! \n\n[He's talking to Edmund Sami, a low level manager who works at tech support at Merl's. Strange guy, always wears that mask on his face] \n\n**Sami:** [off-camera] Who the hell are you calling a minion, Dan? I'm technically your superior!\n\n**Dan:** Excuse me for a moment, dear sirs. [walks off-camera] Sami, Mr. Jamu placed me in charge of making the video, obviously because he knows which one of us is the real wizard around here! \n\n**Sami:** Oh, don't you dare! You know the only reason Jamu did that was to spite me! Some cousin, he is. Now get back on camera and let's get this over with! \n\n**Dan:** Not until you admit I'm the the one in charge.\n\n**Sami:** If I do that, you'll never let me hear the end of it. No deal. \n\n**Dan:** Fine, I guess I'll just have to tell Mr. Jamu you're being uncooperative. And that you haven't finished your quarterly performance report, minion. \n\n**Sami:** That's it, you dimwit Luxomancer, your ass is mine! \n\n[you can hear a scuffle occurring off-camera] \n\n**Dan:** Not the beard! Not the beard! \n\n**Sami:** Yes the beard! \n\n[The camera is knocked over. Video feed stops, audio continues]\n\n**Dan:** Hmm. This didn't go well. \n\n**Sami:** You better not tell Jamu anything about this!\n\n**Dan:** No way! He'll blame me for ruining the tape!\n\n**Sami:** Who the hell cares, Dan? No one is ever going to actually order the bloody thing. Let's just say we're done and get lunch. I think it's pizza day. \n\n**Dan:** Pizza? Endorius take this accursed tape to the leaky Stygian Abyss then.\n\n**Sami:** What?\n\n**Dan:** Fuck it, lets eat. \n\n**<End Log>**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAnyway, that's all we have left from the raid. The spooks took everything else. I know I should be angry, but this is far more than we usually get. I wonder why they allowed me to get away with that, I'm sure they knew exactly what I was doing. They always do. \n\nSir, I'm... not sure we did the right thing here. This might sound hypocritical from the one who organized the raid, and I know we don't have the resources to handle this sort of things ourselves, but I still hate doing this. Those people we caught were weird, true, but giving them away to the spooks... You know no one ever comes back once the spooks gets their hands on them. They weren't bad people. They didn't deserve this. \n\nBut I guess that's just what we do, isn't it.   \n\nSigning out,\n\nSpecial Agent Stanton. \n\n-----\n\n**Subject:** Re: UI-56\n\n**From:** Director McNamara, FBI HQ, Washington D.C \n\n**To:** Special Agent Laura Stanton, Unusual Incident Unit, Los Angeles Office\n\nDon't rock the boat, kiddo. Just keep your head down and try not to think about it too much. Hang in there, eh? This assignment won't last forever. Soon the entire Huston incident will blow over and we can get you back to the big league. I promised your father I'll get you out of this, and I will. \n\nOh, and try not to swear so much, it looks unprofessional.\n\nDirector McNamara.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
