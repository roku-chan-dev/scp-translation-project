What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[Song of Sophia]]], [[[Vast Suspended Ruins]]], and Articles That Jump Around Time\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + picks of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[A Study in Cinnabar]]], [[[Guilt Trip]]], and Spurned Concepts\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's pieces.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Wikis is constantly evolving. This is by no means a new epiphany, but we often forget the years of history that we're building on as we produce new content. People have been having wild ideas and expanding on what SCP as a concept even entails ever since someone posted a creepypasta about a murder-statue to /x/. \n\nThis also means that what's popular and in vogue has radically changed over time. Once, superpowered author avatars who did whatever they wanted were what people loved. As a reaction, the wiki eventually shifted to hardline grimdark stories and characters. More recently, we've seen another resurgence in boldly silly and self-aware comedy articles from people tired of the same seriousness. \n\nAs those trends shift, the concepts that make up the trends get left behind in the dust. But not forever! The beauty of the wiki is that anyone can pick up an old idea from years ago, dust it off, and spin it out into something new and fresh. Concepts like MTFs made up of SCPs -- once derided, now given new life by the recent Renaissance Contest and sustained by an excellent tale series by HarryBlank and Grigori Karpin. \n\nConcepts like Tactical Response Teams, telekill alloy, beryllium bronze, a more involved Administrator, perhaps even D-class demotion or excessive redactions -- all are concepts that have been forgotten long enough that, with a little spit and polish, could shine on the wiki of today. Why not try your hand?\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write an article prominently featuring a concept that's no longer in vogue with the rest of the site - bring it back!\n* **For artists:** Draw art of a character or element once popular, since forgotten on the site.",
