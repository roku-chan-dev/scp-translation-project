Any reports concerning objects being enlarged or shrunk must be taken into account for evidence of the entity's presence.\n\nOnce contained, SCP-7102 is to be placed into a medically-induced coma until a more viable containment method is found. All SCP-7102-A instances must be contained or disposed of on discretion.\n\n##blue|Containment Protocols are being revised pending results of Addendum-04.##\n\n**Description:** SCP-7102 is a human female of British descent, aged 36. The entity has blonde hair, and possesses multiple gunshot wounds and surgical scars across its body, with the latter being heavily prevalent near the abdomen.\n\nBy focusing and directing a half-closed fist towards an object, SCP-7102 can enlarge or shrink an object by opening and closing their fist respectively. \n\nObjects, before being affected (SCP-7102-A) will briefly experience an intangible phenomena in the form of enlarged and/or shrunken opaque versions of itself protruding out of their bodies. This is also accompanied by the instance spatially distorting before its size is altered. \n\nSCP-7102-A instances' mass, density, and volume will also change correspondingly to the size adopted. Only SCP-7102 can return SCP-7102-A instances to their original size. The exact limitations of SCP-7102's anomaly remain unknown.\n\nSCP-7102 also has the following anomalous attributes:\n* Enhanced reflexes;\n* Ability to produce electricity around their body;\n* Inability to suffer muscle fatigue;\n* Decelerated aging.\n\n**Discovery:** The Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-7102, following the operation conducted against Albert Lopper, a biotechnology entrepreneur living in Alabama, United States. Evidence provided by third parties suggested Mr. Lopper had become involved with multiple para-natural organizations. As the Foundation didn't have concrete proof to warrant Mr. Lopper's arrest, his estate was put under surveillance.\n\nShortly after, SCP-7102 appeared.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ ACCESS SCiPNET:/7102/Alabama/Rodney ◀\" hide=\"▷ CLOSE FILE ◁\"]]\n[[<]]\n> = **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> //[Lopper enters his office, talking into his cellphone.]//\n> \n> **Lopper:** What?

SCP-7102 collects it and places another piece of tape over his mouth. After collecting, they kneel in front of Lopper.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Thanks for the assisted donation. Before I go, I have something to say.\n> \n> **Lopper:** Hmph?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I saw your file. I didn't expect much when I saw the embezzlements. Neither did the hookers, the drug use... but then I found out you were crucial in establishing some holdouts in South America and Europe.\n> \n> //[Lopper eyes widen.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** You know what I'm talking about. Those particular bases dealt with anomaly smuggling, and //normal// smuggling, but more than half of them contained normal men and women, chained to walls like dogs. A lot more had to go on for sure... in one of these safehouses, we found a bunch of stuffed animals and toys in cages. \n> \n> **Lopper:** [Hyperventilating.]\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** You demonic fuck.\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 extends a hand extremely close to Lopper's face.

I reckon I could turn your seat into an electric chair with just my pinkie. It would be easy.\n> \n> //[Lopper begins to whimper and cry. SCP-7102 pulls back their hand.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Unfortunately for you, too easy.\n> \n> **Lopper:** Hmph?!\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Death's too good for you. As we speak, the evidence is being delivered to the proper authorities. As in, they actually care about their integrity; no bribing. Soon enough, you'll be spending a lot of time in a room not much bigger than this one. Congratulations, all the hard work you've been espousing has led up to this point.

I've seen you in action -- you're scary.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** ...You're being honest.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I like to wear my heart on my sleeve if I can -- works wonders.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Well it certainly has a charm. So can you put that away?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I'm not comfortable with that, but does it matter? If you wanted to do something, you would've shrunk me or the gun. Is this 'talk' really that important? \n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Must be. Brown suggested you for a reason.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** ...Take a seat.\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 sits across from Agent Rodney and looks at the basket of fries, then to Agent Rodney. Agent Rodney nods. SCP-7102 quickly consumes it while Agent Rodney hides the firearm under the table.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Never seen a girl eat so fast... I've heard rumors GRU fed you dog food, that true?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** No, thank god; just potatoes, fish and the occasional vegetable. You know a lot about me?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I read the files: girl has powers, bad guys kidnap girl, girl is placed on a spec ops team with other powered people, girl escapes, girl works with the Front until a certain bear comes her way...\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 cringes and breaks eye contact with Agent Rodney. Agent Rodney sighs.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** How did this happen?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Would you believe me if I said it was because of a single potato chip?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Yes.\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 smirks and leans against their seat, looking at the ceiling.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Their version of amnestics did quite a number on me, I don't remember all the details. It honestly feels like a dream. Heh... a pretty damn good dream.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Let's see.. I lived in the UK, my accents' proof of that. I think I was eight, maybe twelve at the time? Not too sure about that one. But I had a mom and dad, that's for sure.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** You had parents?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** [Smirks] I was born wasn't I? We lived by the lake. Except for the money situation it was... pleasant.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Money situation?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** We were poor, no, flat-out broke. Dad had to constantly work his ass off to make ends meet. We could only afford the cheap stuff, and it was never satisfying either. It just... sucked over all. And then... it //happened.//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Let me guess, your ability?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Mm-hmm. I can't say if I was born with it or something occurred but... Pfftt! It just happened straight out of the blue! One minute, I'm having a snack by the park, the next the table flattens because the bag is too big! Just like that! Can you believe it?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Yes, I've seen you do it... multiple times, in fact.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** The point is I realized what I had, freaked the hell out, I realized I could use it on food, then I freaked out again, but in a good way. Never went to bed hungry ever again.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** And your parents didn't notice?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Oh they did, they absolutely did. Caught me in the act. They freaked out too, but they quickly changed their tune once it clicked how much money we'd save from groceries. I have to give them credit, taking all of that in at once? That takes guts. They weren't perfect, but I wouldn't have them any other way.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Such as shame that's the last time I saw them.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** ...\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I don't even know how they found out. I was walking home one day when I felt a pinch on my neck. When I woke, I was in some... room... a metal room with people in suits, cameras and other unfortunate souls in the same predicament as I was. My brothers and sisters... \n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** How is the Conglomerate still a thing? I thought GRU was finished after the Soviets collapsed.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Most were: the rest slipped by, hoping to regain their old glory like before. Rumors came that America was in the process of creating a super soldier program, so Russia tried beating them to it. They tried all sorts of things: mental conditioning, physical training... the //surgeries//. I tried to keep my head down, but it never worked.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** And I let it happen, they convinced me I didn't have a choice and I listened every time. Obeyed like the fucking dog... no, bitch I am. Survival. Loyalty. Hatred for the enemy. For years it was just that. Those three things, and those things alone. And at certain points in my life, I enjoyed it.\n> \n> //[Agent Rodney remains silent, lowering his gun slightly.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** The Front tried saying the conditioning was responsible, or was a... normal reaction mitigating stress? I hope they're right, it sure as hell didn't feel like it. Then they tried to heal the amnestic damage...\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 shudders and involuntarily clenches their right fist.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** They only healed a portion of it, because it wasn't worth it. They doped us all the time, and I was their star candidate. Sneaking intel, stuffing tiny people into jars, literally doubling supplies and nuclear stockpile for the mustached fuck. They would've worked me to the bone if they could.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** And I was the lucky one! If you know me, then you should know my squad. It's worse since I left. Now they're hooked up to some... //device//, their final safety net. I don't know if they're even still in there anymore. They don't even blink! And now they want to do the same thing to him. I--\n> \n> //[Agent Rodney holds onto SCP-7102's right hand. SCP-7102 looks at Agent Rodney in shock; their cheeks are wet.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I understand.. I've been in a couple of hostage situations myself, they're always the worst, aren't they?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Yeah...\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I know a little bit about Brody. He seemed like a good kid, and reminds me a lot of niece. But I have to ask... why did you choose to raise him?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Because I killed his parents.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** What?!\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I made some bad calls and it resulted in casualties. I made that kid an orphan, Mister Rodney. The least I can do is make it up to him. And... he helped me too in a sense. Give me back another opportunity I thought I lost.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** What opportunity?\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 stands up and pulls down the front of their pants, showing her lower abdomen scars. Agent Rodney's eyes widened.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Yep, he went //there//. The way I see it, Brody is the only child I'm ever going to have. And now he is in //his// care. Does it sink in yet?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //Jesus!// Fuck...\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 sits down and pulls a folder from their pocket, sliding it to Agent Rodney. He inspects the contents, then looks to SCP-7102.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** The point is I need someone to vouch for me. We know the base's location but we need help. The Front's trying to work out a deal, Numbers thinks we might actually pull it off. All we want is to free the prisoners and pull the plug on their aspirations.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Your Foundation values information second to none, that file contains a lot of goodies, both from them and us, consider it a down payment. L-Look, I'm so sorry for putting you on the spotlight, but I'm at my wit's end here. I don't know what else to do... I'm just so tired--\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** I'll do it... I don't know how, but I'll do it. I have a lot of street cred, I know who to talk to. I can't promise you anything... but believe me, I'll try.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Good... good...\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 slouches against the seat, closing their eyes.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** You do realize I still can't let you go... right?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I know... I'm just taking a rest.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Oh... okay.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Mister Rodney?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Yeah?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Thank you.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** [Smiling] You're welcome.\n> \n> = **[END LOG]**\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n**Addendum-04:** After much deliberation, and reviewing evidence that the Yaman Conglomerate presented a severe danger to the globe at large, the O5 Council, for this exception, agreed to the deal provided the Front also accepted to terms given by the Foundation.\n\nAfter the location of the enemy home base was located in Greenland, the joint operation immediately commenced: MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") was tasked with a front assault while Beta-8 and MLF operatives were tasked with underground infiltration of the facility.

I hope this doesn't mean we're becoming friends.\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** [Chuckle] You //wish//.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** //Beck.//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** I know, no friendly fire allowed... shame you couldn't just size us up. This would've been over in a second.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I have trouble enlarging big objects, Beck. That goes double for living things. This is going to suck.\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** ...You know we could still die, right?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Death's always a risk. Either way, this is going to be our last hurrah. So why not go out with a bang? [Smile] Or do you prefer whimpering and backing out like a bitch instead? \n> \n> //[SCP-6772 gives a small smile.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Goddamn, I love you\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I know.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //Guys? We're going to start in about a minute. Get ready!//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Noted. Numbers?\n> \n> //[Numbers removes the purple head and places it in SCP-6772's backpack and pulls out a golden fox head. SCP-6772 wears it and notices people staring.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** This one slows down people's perception of time. We'll have them flat on their ass before they even notice. Got it as a birthday present.\n> \n> **Sgt. Arglo:** You're going to tell us how you found that?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** No.\n> \n> //[The faint sound of alarms blaring are audible. SCP-7102 pulls out a Wooden \"F\" letter block.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Go time. Hope you guys are packing, you're gonna need it.\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 telekinetically cuts a rectangular opening in the ceiling with SCP-6772-A. SCP-7102 places and enlarges the block before the section of ceiling falls down, creating a makeshift ramp. The task force charges into the floor above.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-6772, Numbers, and SCP-7102 separate from the main group. SCP-6772 and Numbers decapitate and shoot enemy operatives respectively; SCP-7102 spots a group of anomalous operatives heading their way.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Uh, Darling!\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 stares at the operatives; the operatives slow down before colliding and tripping over each other. Numbers fires tranquiliser darts at the operatives. The operatives become unresponsive.]//\n> \n> **Numbers:** Nice save.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** You're telling me! We should've done this more often. It's so--\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Keep your head in the game, Gold! Just focus on Brody and the rest. [To radio] Okay we're in, what now?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //We're in their cameras now and it's not good! It seems like a lot of men, the brainwashed ones, are going towards the prison sector.//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** They--?! Then stop them!\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //We're trying to... wait, I see him!//\n> \n> **Numbers:** Who? The target?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //Yes! He's straight ahead of your position! He's surrounded by guards and packing up a bag. You better hurry!//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Shit! Brody's in there! If they get in...\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Focus, Gold, focus! I need you to enlarge my sword.\n> \n> **Numbers:** You're--? Why?!\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Evening the odds. Hit it!\n> \n> //[SCP-6772-A's size is tripled, and the group picks up their pace. They shrink, bisect and shoot conglomerate soldiers along the way. SCP-6772-A approaches a wall and slices it apart entirely; Golubev and his bodyguards are visible, and are stunned]//\n> \n> //[The bodyguards attempt to open fire but the majority of them are pulverized by SCP-6772-A, the rest are shot down by Numbers and SCP-7102.

Shrink it.\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 returns SCP-6772-A to its normal size. SCP-7102 marches to a shaken Golubev.]//\n> \n> **Golubev:** Y-You... B-Bit--\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Bitch? I get that a lot. Now c'mere!\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 stomps on Golubev's ankle, causing him to cry in pain before the entity presses its gun barrel against his forehead. Golubev whimpers as SCP-7102 handcuffs him to a pipe on the wall.//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** To think I was scared of you. Stay down or //else//. Beck, we need to shut down the pods, try reading him, maybe we... Numbers?\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 follows Numbers' gaze. A tank holding a massive larva-like entity is by the back wall. It appears to be breathing.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** What... what the hell is this--\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** The one putting their 'special soldiers' in check.\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 is adorning the purple head, pressing a finger against Golubev's temple.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** It's a bio-telepathic computer... birthed from the flesh extracted from sarkic prisoners... its babies are the ones in the earpods... This was his doing.\n> \n> **Golubev:** I-I had no choice! The kremlin, they--\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** --Accepted the plan once you suggested it. Pathetic, you can't even own up to your own bullshit.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Sarkics?... I remember that! This was the plan all along? You... you made me doom my brothers... Y-You... //Fucking//...\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Gold, remember the deal. We need to take that thing now. Let me--\n> \n> //[A pink laser decapitates SCP-6772 as it gasps and turns right; a rusted man, a large arachnoid and an albino woman rush into the room. Golubev shouts in Russian, they focus their attention towards SCP-7102.]//\n> \n> //[The arachnoid tackles Numbers to the ground, the two entities engage in a fist fight as they both tear each other's limbs off.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 fails to dodge to cover and gains the attention of the rusted man. SCP-6772 screams in pain as rust begins to envelope his body. SCP-6772 quickly replaces his head with the fox and stares at the rusted man. The rusted man stumbles forward in confusion before SCP-6772 delivers an upper cut to his jaw.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 attempts to tackle the albino but freezes when its eyes glow. SCP-7102 barely dodges the laser; Golubev's screams are abruptly cut. SCP-7102 extends a hand towards the albino but the operative stabs them in the arm. SCP-7102 screams before being kicked down by the albino.]//\n> \n> //[The albino notices SCP-6772; its eyes brighten again. SCP-7102 gasps and grabs a nearby pencil from the floor and throws it at the operative. The pencil enlarges, piercing the operative in the chest, killing it. SCP-7102 freezes, and frowns as blood seeps from the body.]//\n> \n> **Numbers:** Becker!\n> \n> //[Numbers is being overpowered by the arachnid, the latter of whom is attempting to tear the entity apart. SCP-6772 rushes to Numbers's aid, slicing the operative's limbs. However, the entity is regenerating far faster than SCP-6772 can cut. The sound of faint footsteps is audible.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-7102, despite being in immense pain, moves towards SCP-6772 before slipping and falling. SCP-6772 curses and notices the footsteps are becoming louder. SCP-6772 then looks to the arachnid and the larva. Its eyes widen.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Gold! Blow me up!\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I-I... how--\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Trust me, girl. Do it!\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 takes a deep breath and extends a fist towards SCP-6772, screaming in pain. SCP-6772's size is tripled. SCP-6772 stomps on the arachnid, pinning it to the floor. SCP-6772 then swings SCP-6772-A at the larva, bisecting it in two.]//\n> \n> //[More anomalous operatives enter the room, then collapse on the floor unconscious. Numbers pants heavily as they puke on the floor. SCP-6772 pauses, then nods at SCP-7102 -- SCP-6772 reverts to their original size. The radio crackles to life.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** //Gold? Guys? I don't know what you did back there but I'm getting reports that the podded guys have keeled over. They're still breathing. Just sit tight, we'll come to your position.//\n> \n> **Numbers:** Did.. did we just win?\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** I think... yeah, I think we did. [Chuckles] You hear that, Gold? It's smooth sailing from here. We need to get you patched up though, stay put, I think I got a...\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 is standing by the wall; the two entities join her. Golubev appears to be cut in half, a faint pink glow radiates from the body. SCP-6772 shakes their head.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** No... how did...\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I fought Mandy, and heard him scream... she got him.\n> \n> **Numbers:** No, no we we're so close!\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** The deal is ruined. Without him this all falls apart...\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** No... there's still Plan B.\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Plan B?! No, that's... no Gold, we can't--\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** We have to find him, he's still in danger. C'mon.\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** ...Gold...\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Beck please... c'mon!\n> \n> //[The entities exit the room.]//\n\n> //[The three entities enter the hallway: Numbers is looking through the portholes of the doors before stopping at the one at the far end of the hall. SCP-6772 breaks the lock and opens the door. Both Numbers and SCP-6772 freeze in place.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 notices their reaction and attempts to rush towards the doorway. SCP-6772 tries pulling her back but SCP-7102 peeks inside and gasps. They stumble back and fall to the floor; SCP-7102 is crying.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 kneels and wraps their arms around SCP-7102. SCP-7102 continues to cry, staring inside of the cell. Numbers reverts to their humanoid form and slide down to the floor. After a moment, they use the radio.]//\n\n> //[Agent Rodney and Agent Polk are on the outside of the base. Foundation and MLF forces are moving around.]//\n> \n> **Agent Polk:** That went... surprisingly well. We got a few casualties but they folded when their toys went out of commission. You think this is the end for them?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Doubt it. Groups like them... they're like cockroaches, so hard to get rid of and hide whenever they can. There's probably still more out there but this will definitely pull the hurt on them... hm?\n> \n> //[Agent Rodney spots SCP-7102, SCP-6772 and Numbers conversing with themselves in the distance.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Polk, talk to sergeant. I need to do something quick.\n> \n> **Agent Polk:** Sure, just hurry it up. I'm freezing my ass out here.\n> \n> //[Agent Rodney approaches the group.]//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** -ave to do this! They're distracted, we can--\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** There's nowhere we can go. It won't work.\n> \n> **Numbers:** Hate to say it, but she has a point. Pulling a stunt like that will ruin any future diplomacy we have.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** We all agreed to the terms, this is the only solution here. I caused this, it's only fair I deal with the consequences. \n> \n> **SCP-6772:** So this is it?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Probably, you know how they are with their //collection.//\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** Goddammit... [Sigh] it was an honor having you in my crew, it  won't be the same without you.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** The feeling is mutual. Just get them to that specialist.\n> \n> **SCP-6772:** I will. Numbers, get the gurneys.\n> \n> //[SCP-6772 spots Agent Rodney approaching. The entity scowls before walking away with Numbers. SCP-7102 notices Agent Rodney.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Thanks, I doubt this would've gone any other without your help. I don't know how I can repay you.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** It's fine. The paycheck I get is all I need. Well that and the dental insurance, heh... so the brainwashed people, did they make it out alright?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** A dozen died, the rest are relatively good. We're planning to take them to a special doctor, seeing if there's any way we can... remedy what's done to them... hopefully.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** That's good to hear. So what are you going to do now?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Waiting to be contained.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Wait... what?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** One of the main terms was to capture Golubev, but he's dead. The only way to make this work was to let them have me. I've been his main project -- worked under him for years... in other words, I'm the next best thing.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** But... if you're gone, who's going to take care of Brody?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** ...\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Did... what happened to Brody?\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 stares towards the MLF members carrying the unconscious operatives away. SCP-6772 is carrying Brody, two earpods are visible on his ears.]//\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** No...\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I had a hunch we were already screwed when Golubev used him as a bargaining chip. I knew I shouldn't work myself up over it, but I just couldn't help it. At least he's not dead, there's still hope. I never should've left.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Gold... why did you stay with the Front in the first place?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** Because I knew the rules.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Rules?\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** The world is for 'normal' things, and I'm anything but. That's just how it is, even if I managed to make myself 'normal'... my anomaly gone... that world ain't meant for me. Never was, never will be.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** At least with the Front I can be myself. It sucked, but it had its moments. The food wasn't shitty, I slept in an actual bed, and I made friends, real friends. It was... nice.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** But I got sick of the violence, the scurrying, the planning. I thought I could just settle down, start something of my own with Brody. And now he's gone. I can't bear to try for a third... You feel me?\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** ...I feel you.\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** I'm tired, Rodney. I can't go back home... so I have to make due with another one. Maybe it won't be so bad, I heard some nice things from those Sites of yours... Oh, there's my ticket.\n> \n> //[Multiple Foundation personnel approach SCP-7102. SCP-7102 allows the personnel to handcuff it. SCP-7102 looks to Agent Rodney.]//\n> \n> **SCP-7102:** [Whispering] Thank you, I mean it.\n> \n> //[SCP-7102 is escorted away.
