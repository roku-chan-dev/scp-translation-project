Any civilians who approach the entry point are to be amnesticized and turned away. _\n\nAnyone who enters SCP-7914 without authorization is to be considered lost. No rescue is to be attempted. _\n\n**Description:** SCP-7914 is an extradimensional space with inconsistent topography. Personnel who explore more than a short distance beyond the entry point are unable to find a way back out, and lose radio contact shortly thereafter. The topographical arrangement of the small area that has been explored has changed each time it is observed. _\n\nThe only entry point into SCP-7914 is a set of large double doors similar to those of a hotel in the American Art Deco style. These doors are set into a natural stone wall at the bottom of a 10m deep sinkhole in Olympic National Park in Washington State, USA. Excavating to enter from any other direction reveals only soil and stone typical of the region. _\n\n**Addendum 7914.1:** [[collapsible show=\"+ Exploration Log\"  hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nMTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" assigned a team to explore and determine the nature of SCP-7914. \n\nAssigned personnel: \nZ9-1 \"Lock\" - Team Leader\nZ9-2 \"Vector\" - Tactical Specialist \nZ9-3 \"Seeker\" - Navigation Specialist \nZ9-4 \"Digger\" - Demolition Specialist \nZ9-5 \"Five\" - Forensics Specialist \nZ9-6 \"Fade\" - Logistics Specialist \n\nExtraneous and redundant details will be omitted throughout these merged debriefing logs.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Addendum 7814.1.1]]\n**The Tangled Hotel**\n\nLock: //\"Entry into SCP-7914 went as expected. The team was prepared with over a week of rations and plenty of backup supplies for an extended exploration.\"//\n\nFive: //\"The entry point led to a tangle of hallways visually matching an old hotel. There were intersecting halls at seemingly random intervals and angles. The peeling wallpaper was dull yellow with a floral pattern. Cutting into the wallpaper revealed concrete walls. The loop carpeting was a faded red. Cutting into the carpet revealed concrete floors. There were doors leading to empty rooms placed seemingly at random along all walls. There were no light sources at any point throughout the maze.\"//\n\nLock: //\"As expected, we lost contact with the outside moments after we were out of sight of the entrance. Backtracking promptly confirmed that the way we came from no longer led to the entry point.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"We started with relay procedure Sowulo-7 to determine basic characteristics of the shifting maze. This includes dividing the team to visually cover as much of the maze as possible without leaving anyone out of sight of at least one other. This gave us confirmation that the maze remained consistent while observed, but that any unobserved portion would be instantaneously and silently rearranged.\"//\n\nFive: //\"Note that throughout our exploration, our light sources were approximately 20% less bright than expected and faded in effectiveness over distance approximately 40% more quickly.\"//\n\nFade: //\"In addition to the mentioned light absorption we observed, electrical equipment was drained at an accelerated rate. Our lights and recording equipment should have lasted for weeks before needing replacement batteries. Instead, there was observable battery usage after just a few hours.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"We first employed standard shifting maze procedure Dagaz-2 in hopes of finding one of the more common rearrangement patterns. When that produced inconsistent results, we switched to Dagaz-4 to identify larger trends, at the cost of considerably more time investment.\"//\n\nLock: //\"Dagaz-4 took at least 5 hours to produce consistent results. Time passage is estimated due to increasing inconsistencies between time tracking devices.\"//\n\nDigger: //\"We determined that the twisting corridors were always leading back to a central point. We worked backwards from there to find a point as far from that 'center' as possible without being forced back towards it. Then we made a straight line directly away from it. Took most of my demolition charges to get through 7 consecutive concrete walls, but that's what it took to exit the 'hotel' portion of the maze.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 7914.1.2]]\n**The Marble Corridor**\n\nFive: //\"After demolishing a path out of the first tangle, we found a hallway that was straight in both directions as far as our lights could reach. No turns or openings. The walls and floor were smooth marble. White with black streaks. The ceiling was out of sight above us.\"//\n\nSeeker: //'We started marking the walls and proceeding with each of us walking at a slightly different pace as per potentially infinite slash looping corridor procedure Jera-1.\"//\n\nFade: //\"We needed to swap out batteries for the first time about an hour into the marble corridor. Small time measurement discrepancies prevented us from determining a precise ratio, but our equipment was draining power at least twenty times more quickly than the typical rate.\"//\n\nLock: //\"After Jera-1 and 2 both failed to provide conclusive results for about 6 hours, we started discussing non-standard methods.\"//\n\nDigger: //\"As per my favorite test, I used the last of our demolition charges to blow through both walls. They were a couple meters of solid stone thick, but we got it done.\"//\n\nFive: //\"Even after several hours of walking, the new hole in the wall we had come through led back into the hotel tangle. My current theory is that the marble hall is a loop that appears to be a straight line but actually forms a circle wrapped around the hotel region. The opposite wall led to a new corridor.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 7914.1.3]]\n**The Chain Chute**\n\nFive: //\"We exited the marble corridor into a much smaller space. The walls, floor, and ceiling of this hall were composed of rusty iron chains so tightly packed together that they were effectively solid surfaces. This hall was a square which I estimated to be 2 meters wide and tall. By this point, all attempts at precise measurement would produce slightly inconsistent results from one attempt to the next.\"//\n\nVector: //\"On a more concerning note, both walls were lined with hanging meat hooks halfway up and approximately a meter apart.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"The inconsistent measurements there didn't suggest an infinite slash looping path the way they had in the marble corridor. I theorized that there would be an end point eventually, but we had no way to determine which way or how far.\"//\n\nLock: //\"It's always fun to flip the arbitrary decision coin. We went left.\"//\n\nVector: //\"I observed the meat hooks slightly wobbling without any apparent cause.\"//\n\nFade: //\"We proceeded for about 12 hours without any indication that Seeker had been incorrect. We replaced batteries in our light sources again and started leaving recording equipment powered down when not actively in use. Most recordings came back badly distorted anyway.\"//\n\nLock: //\"There was no warning when the floor suddenly shifted out from under us. In under a second, the entire hall rotated 90 degrees to become a vertical shaft. The wall chains were too tightly packed to hang onto, so we were forced to catch ourselves on the hooks that had rotated to hang towards the new down. Digger and Five were injured in the process of catching themselves.\"//\n\nVector: //\"We quickly agreed that this had been some kind of intentional trap to stop forward progress. As such, we opted to climb up and continue in the same direction relative to the hall. We left our medical supplies with our injured team members and proceeded upward, hook by hook.\"//\n\nFade: \"//Time and distance tracking inconsistencies increased at an accelerating rate as we approached the top of the hall.\"//\n\nLock: //\"While it became increasingly difficult to track time accurately, I estimate that we spent 3 hours climbing before we saw an end to it. The moment we pulled ourselves up past a ledge made of the chains, everything rotated back to the previous state. We tumbled into a new region as the hall became horizontal again.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 7914.1.4]]\n**The Empty**\n\nSeeker: //\"When we exited the chain-lined shaft, we entered a space with the same hall width and red loop carpeting as the hotel. The difference here was that there were no walls or ceiling. Instead we were surrounded by a seemingly endless void that swallowed our light without revealing anything. There was still a tangle of intersecting floating catwalks, which only became visible at close range.\"//\n\nFade: //\"Despite our eagerness to continue exploring, I insisted on taking a longer rest after an exhausting vertical climb. Even though I was concerned with our rate of resource consumption, we desperately needed to recover.\"//\n\nLock: //\"Less than an hour into our overdue break, Digger and Five caught up to us. This despite our multiple hour head start and their much slower pace. Spreading out as per procedure Othila-2 confirmed that the spatial and temporal distortions were becoming severe enough to prohibit further tests that would divide the group beyond our limited sight range.\"//\n\nFive: //\"I can't say how long we rested, but it was desperately needed. Taking a nap on a hall suspended over a void on both sides was more than a little disconcerting.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"We started with procedure Dagaz-4 due to our success back in the hotel tangle. It didn't work at all. Our brightest lights revealed no more than a dozen meters ahead of us, and we couldn't find even a hint of a pattern from one intersection to the next.\"//\n\nFade: //\"We worked our way down the list of Dagaz procedures for what must have been at least 12 hours with no leads or theories. At that point I was forced to start rationing water and batteries. Neither of these should have been an issue for several more days.\"//\n\nFive: //\"During another brief break to brainstorm options, Digger suggested breaking through the floor just to see what would happen. Even without demolition charges, a sledgehammer would be sufficient eventually. That got me thinking. We could see beneath nearby intersecting halls, but never beneath the one we were currently on.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"Five's idea finally gave us a new angle to start testing while Digger was breaking things. Reaching under the current hall revealed nothing, even when observed from an intersecting hall. Same for a bunch of similar tests. Breaking through the floor didn't reveal anything but more void. We finally hit the breakthrough when I lowered a rope directly beneath an intersection and it vanished sooner than other things did in the diminished light.\"//\n\nLock: //\"Lacking better options, the team lowered me on a rope into the layer of darkness. After a meter or so I was able to see again. I gave the rope two tugs to indicate that the team should follow me.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 7914.1.5]]\n**The Sacrifice**\n\nFade: //\"It took some doing and leaving some rope behind, but we got everyone down without any new injuries.\"//\n\nFive: //\"We found ourselves in another shifting maze. This time the walls, floor, and ceiling were smooth, polished granite. There were occasionally squares of light absorbing shadow in the ceiling about the same size as the intersections of the catwalks we had been on.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"Despite superficial similarities with previous mazes, basic navigation of this one was more challenging. It no longer conformed to any architectural norms. The dimensions of the rooms, doors, and hallways were wildly inconsistent. There were exits from rooms several meters above the ground and drops to lower levels with no stairs or ladders. Hallways leading to dead ends or vertical shafts were common. At least a quarter of the doorways were too small for an adult to squeeze through, while you could easily drive a tank through others.\"//\n\nLock: //\"After a few hours of spreading out and reconvening as per procedure Sowulo-4 to establish some basic rules, we started finding detailed etchings into the walls. It looked vaguely similar to Greek, but none of us could identify it. I risked powering on the forensic camera long enough to get as much data as possible.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"Given the problematic new inconsistencies, we skipped straight to procedure Dagaz-8 to find a way we could define as 'forward'. This was the right call, and we reached an important chamber in less than 8 hours.\"//\n\nFive: //\"The ritual chamber was square with a circular basin set into the floor in the center. The basin was approximately 1 meter in diameter and 25 centimeters deep at the center. The basin contained traces of dried blood. A man next to the basin (Hereafter SCP-7914-A) had been dead for at least 2 days, but with such inconsistent time passage I have no way of knowing how long ago that was for the rest of the world. SCP-7914-A was a human male 35-45 years of age at time of death. Its features suggested a North African ethnic background. Its clothing was an expensive custom tailored business suit. No reliable measurements were possible. It was holding a multiple page document (The text of which is hereafter SCP-7914-B) in one hand and a ceremonial kris in the other. Cause of death was clearly self inflicted exsanguination.\"//\n\nLock: //\"The papers were written in the same unknown language we had previously encountered. We took plenty of pictures of the guy and packed up the papers and the knife for History or Thaumaturgy to figure out later.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"After leaving through an exit opposite the way we entered, we noted that the temporal and spatial distortions started rapidly decreasing. A simple exploration using distortion comparison procedure Birkana-2 quickly led us to a central point in which time and space were stable and consistently measurable.\"//\n\nDigger: //\"When we reached a center room, we ran a variety of tests to determine what made that room special. I closely examined the walls until I found a small section that would slightly ripple on contact as if the surface was a liquid. With no more blasting charges I had to fall back on a sledgehammer and some determination. Thankfully that wall was only a few centimeters of granite. We found a vertical wall of a black substance behind it with high but permeable surface tension. We didn't feel anything beyond it, but reaching through it didn't cause any harm.\"//\n\nVector: //\"Portal testing procedures Raido 1-3 showed us that it wasn't instant death and didn't eat our tools, but little else. Our portal check drone lost contact immediately after entry. Expected, but it would have been nice to get something.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 7914.1.26]]\n**The Beast**\n\nLock: //\"After exhausting every other option available, we made a rope harness and I stepped through. After a few very concerning seconds of complete sensory deprivation, I fell a couple meters onto a stone floor. After a quick check that nothing was immediately attempting to kill me, I tried to signal back. The rope fell loose, severed somewhere in transit. As expected, no signals reached the rest of the team. The portal check drone was there, but inoperable after the unexpected fall. I could only hope that the portal would consistently emerge at my location when the others came through.\"//\n\nVector: //\"Watching the rope snap and losing contact with Lock wasn't ideal for morale, but we followed nonetheless. It was too late to turn back and try something else.\"//\n\nLock: //\"I was starting to get nervous about how much time had passed when Vector appeared and fell. They were winded, so I pulled them aside in case someone else was about to fall. The rest came through shortly after. Five needed more medical attention after the impact tore their bandaging and reopened the pierce wound.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"We found ourselves on a rough, unworked stone floor similar to natural caves in the area. Our lights didn't reach anything, but for the first time we saw lights in the distance. A handful of dull blue spots we couldn't identify. We started by trying to find a nearby wall or other reference point without losing sight of the lights. We didn't find anything in almost an hour, so we changed the plan to move directly towards them until we could better assess the situation.\"//\n\nFive: //\"It took us another 6 hours to get close enough to distinguish the individual light sources and their arrangement.\"//\n\nFade: //\"On a hunch, I insisted on taking a water break before actually approaching the circle of lights. This turned out to be a very good idea. The rations were getting smaller than would be safe for much longer.\"//\n\nLock: //\"After another half hour, we could get a more detailed look ahead. There was a 30 meter diameter ring of 10 stone pillars arranged slightly out of symmetry. Each pillar was about a meter tall, with some small variance. The lights were emitted by complex crystalline structures, each resting on a pedestal. These were more varied in shape and size, but most were close to a half meter tall.\"//\n\nVector: //\"There was an additional pillar in the center of the ring with no light on it. Despite how visible the dull blue lights had been from a great distance, they didn't illuminate whatever was resting on it. The best we could make out was the silhouette of a small dome shape.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"Approaching the pillars did not trigger any reaction. Even at just a meter from the edge of the ring, our lights didn't illuminate the center. Our test drone powered down the instant it passed between the pillars. We had no better option but to get closer.\"//\n\nLock: //\"The moment I stepped between two of the pillars, we were all shocked and staggered by an unexpected voice in our minds. I've confirmed that we all received the same message. Exact quote: 'Free me and I will help you escape.'\"//\n\nVector: //\"I immediately gave the psychic danger hand signal and the rest of the team gave the acknowledgement signal back. We had all heard it, and none of us had lost control. I saw Digger begin to waver, but verbal trigger memetic countermeasures brought them around.\"//\n\nFade: //\"I charged forward with our brightest light at the brightest setting to give the team a chance to get a clear view of this thing. At two meters from it, I was hit with a much louder voice that rendered me unconscious. 'You will obey!'\"//\n\nVector: //\"As Fade fell, I gave the signals to spread out around it with weapons hot. It was only for a few moments, but Fade had gaven us a clear view of a dome made of an unknown transparent material over what appeared to be a small spherical blob of pinkish flesh.\"//\n\nFive: //\"All I remember next is a psychic scream that blocked all other thoughts and perceptions. Everything went black.\"//\n\nLock: //\"Even bracing ourselves after hearing that voice in our heads, the first scream was devastating. Five went down and my vision went black. That's when I knew we were in a kill or die situation. Obviously, containing that thing would have been preferred, but we were past the point where that was an option. I gave the signal and we unloaded on it.\"//\n\nVector: //\"I didn't have a clear view of what happened, but it was apparent that a hail of high caliber bullets had done nothing to the dome protecting that thing. That's when the second scream hit us. Stronger than the first. I staggered and almost went down. It was several seconds before I could see again.\"//\n\nSeeker: //\"I was the only one who noticed when the light from one of the crystals behind us started oscillating during the second scream. Before I could react, it shot out a flame similar to that of a plasma torch at Digger. They hit the ground immediately, already smoking. I shot the crystal, which promptly shattered. I'm fairly certain that the first shot destroyed it and that the next few shots were unnecessary.\"//\n\nLock: //\"With all the noise and focus on the target, I missed the first time Seeker tried to signal me. By the time they got my full attention, I saw the crystal behind them blast them with some kind of fire beam. They got the signal to me just before it dropped them. I signaled Vector and we destroyed the glowing crystals. It only took a few seconds to sweep them all given how fragile the stationary targets were. One of them was already starting to shift colors, causing it to burst in a small flame explosion as it broke. That's when the third psychic scream slammed us like a physical blow and I hit the ground. I managed to remain conscious, but only barely.\"//\n\nVector: //\"In the sudden silence, I heard a cracking noise from the central pillar. I'm assuming the protection there was somehow dependent on the crystals. I dropped my empty rifle and drew my sidearm. As Lock was struggling back to their feet, I took my shot. The dome exploded outward with the first bullet impact. With the second bullet, the fourth scream ended just as it was starting. Nothing stopped me from stepping into point blank range.\"//\n\nLock: //\"My vision was still blurred when Vector put a stop to that thing. Then they were next to the pillar and putting more rounds into it just to be sure. I assumed that they would resolve that issue, so I went into triage mode. I left the unconscious to hopefully recover on their own while I did my best to treat the burned people. Their injuries were severe, but they were still breathing.\"//\n\nFade: //\"I recovered my senses enough to assess my surroundings, with Vector standing over the pillar and shooting into it. I spotted someone smoldering on the ground and tried to reach them. I stumbled and lost my footing repeatedly, and I wasn't able to assist the others.\"//\n\nFive: //\"I got back to my feet just in time to be knocked down by an earthquake.\"//\n\nLock: //\"Our triage efforts were interrupted by an earthquake. When a stalactite crashed down next to the central pillar, we rushed to drag the team away from the epicenter. With everything going on, I didn't notice a new hole in the ceiling letting in dim starlight filtered through dense forest.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n**Addendum 7914.2:** \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Recovery and Debriefing\"  hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nThere was a magnitude 5.8 earthquake 212 hours after MTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" entered SCP-7914, centered 1.1 km from the entry point. The quake opened a new sink hole at the epicenter, creating a passage to a large natural cavern. Recovered Z9 records show that they were within the anomalous space for 328 hours.\n\nRescue personnel were able to recover the entire Z9 team from the anomaly and transport them to triage medical care. They all suffered from minor dehydration due to rationing during their extended exploration. Seeker and Digger suffered third degree burns over a small area of their torsos and extensive second degree burns. Digger and Five suffered serious puncture wounds. All team members survived. Appropriate awards for exceptional service are to be issued.\n\nDocuments recovered from inside SCP-7914 were transferred to the Department of Thaumaturgy for analysis. The initial assessment by Z9 accurately determined that SCP-7914-A performed the ritual described in SCP-7914-B and took its own life in the process. See Addendum 7914.3 for analysis of the ritual. \n\nThe corpse of the biological entity found in the cavern (Hereafter SCP-7914-C) was not a genetic or morphological match with any recorded species. It was a single ovoid of undifferentiated muscle tissue in an orange blood-like fluid, tightly wrapped in pink skin similar to that of a hairless mammal. It had no other sensory organs or any structures required for locomotion, respiration, nutrient processing, or reproduction. SCP-7914-C was sent to cryogenic storage until the assigned research departments sign off on disposal.\n\n//\"On a personal note, the Mole Rats really lived up to their reputation on this one. No one expected a random hotel door to lead to such an extended exploration with so many hazards. The entry to this kind of thing usually has the decency to at least look properly ominous. The fact that Digger survived after such serious injuries is a credit to the team. This is why we send the best. I will be pushing for additional commendations.\"// - Research Lead Dr. Hammond\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n**Addendum 7914.3:** \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Thaumaturgical Analysis\"  hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nThe exact nature of the ritual described in SCP-7914-B is unclear and we were unable to replicate the process. The text has been translated and we have determined what most of the required components are and what the general intent was.\n\nSCP-7914-B is written in a previously unrecorded variant of the classical Coptic language, most similar to those used in Egypt circa 500 CE. The title of SCP-7914-B translates most literally to \"Restraint of the Others\". \n\nThe SCP-7914-B ritual must be performed in a square room with a circular basin, matching the ritual chamber MTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" found. The documentation also calls for 9 participants. SCP-7914-A must have improvised its attempt to perform the ritual without assistants. \n\nThe key component is freshly drawn human blood from multiple willing sources. We have thus far been unable to fully translate the archaic terminology describing some minor components. Our current theory is that they refer to specific herbs that have been modified by an unspecified thaumaturgical process that the practitioner is assumed to already be familiar with.\n\nThe variant of the SCP-7914-B ritual that SCP-7914-A performed was intended to build a \"net\" surrounding a \"cage\" in which one of \"the others\" is to be \"restrained\". The \"net\" is described as an impossibly convoluted labyrinth to prevent entry or exit. The \"cage\" is described as an artificially constructed life form, which one \"other\" will be forced to inhabit. \n\nAccording to SCP-7914-B, as long as the \"net\" labyrinth is never breached and the \"cage\" life form is never killed, the \"other\" entity will be \"restrained\" forever within it. If it is not \"restrained\", it is capable of moving freely from one living being to another without being detected. SCP-7914-A gave its life in a desperate attempt to ensure that this containment procedure would be permanent. \n\nUnfortunately, the available documentation does not specify any further information about the \"other,\" (Hereafter SCP-7914-D) instead assuming that the reader is already familiar with the subject. Adding our own observations, we can infer the following about SCP-7914-D:\nIt is capable of telepathic communication, an ability that it can use to cause direct harm.\nIt is intangible and capable of inhabiting the physical body of a living being.\nIt is capable of leaving possession of one body and beginning possession of another nearby body in a way we don't yet know how to prevent or detect.\nWith the cage now dead, it is almost certainly no longer contained.\n\nAll we know with certainty is that thaumaturgists before us devoted enormous resources and personal sacrifice to prevent its escape. The Department of Thaumaturgy recommends further research prioritizing SCP-7914-D as a potential Keter class anomaly.\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n**Addendum 7914.4:** \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Final Notes\"  hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nBased on the findings of the Department of Thaumaturgy, MTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" assigned a new team to follow up immediately. \n\nThey first explored the cavern the previous team had been extracted from. They did not find anything anomalous there other than the expected blood from SCP-7914-C. The remains of the destroyed crystalline structures were found to be non-anomalous quartz fragments. No portals were found. The cavern itself was of a typical size and structure for caves in the region, rather than the impossible vastness observed by Z9.\n\nThey next attempted to explore through the known entry point. There was nothing but soil and stone typical of the region behind the door.\n\nAfter an extensive canvass of the area, there is no evidence that SCP-7914 still exists. Reclassification to Neutralized is pending. \n\nDuring this canvassing, Z9-2 \"Vector\" went missing from the medical triage facility, and all attempts to track them have failed. The Department of Thaumaturgy notes that they were the closest living being to the \"cage\" as it died, and speculates that they are now possessed by SCP-7914-D. The department is now recommending that SCP-7914-D should be assigned its own object number and investigated independently of SCP-7914.\n\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7913]]] | SCP-7914 | [[[SCP-7915]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]] _",
