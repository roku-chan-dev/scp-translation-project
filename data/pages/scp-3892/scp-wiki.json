Fiber analysis has revealed SCP-3892 to be made of a non-anomalous cotton-polyester blend.\n\nSCP-3892's anomalous properties manifest when it is worn by a sleeping child of age 10 or under. Once the subject has reached N1 (earliest) stage sleep, SCP-3892-01 will manifest within 10 meters of SCP-3892 (typically within a closet or hallway in domestic trials).\n\nSCP-3892-01 is a large (approx. 2.3 meters tall) skeletal humanoid figure, dressed in a spiked leather jacket, torn denim trousers, and black motorcycle boots. SCP-3892-01's eye sockets contain yellow lights, and luminous smoke can be seen issuing from its mouth and ribcage.\n\nUpon manifesting, SCP-3892-01 will silently approach the target. The air temperature within a 10-meter radius will warm to approximately 27° C. \n\nSCP-3892-01 will then tuck the subject into bed, whisper “Good night, (name)\"[[footnote]]The subject's first name.[[/footnote]], gently kiss the subject on the head, then demanifest.\n\nSCP-3892-01 has neither harmed nor awakened any children during testing trials, and instantly demanifests if approached or interrupted.\n\n**Addendum 3892-01**: On 10 May 2018, SCP-3892-01 looked directly into a testing chamber camera after kissing the subject, growled, and said, \"I know where you sleep.\" SCP-3892-01 then loudly cracked each of its knuckles and demanifested as normal.\n\nSCP-3892-01 has not responded to any attempt at communication by Foundation personnel before or since this event. The significance of this is unknown.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3891]]] | SCP-3892 | [[[SCP-3893]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
