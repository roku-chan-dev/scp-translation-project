The vast majority of the Site would be attending.\n\nThe Coalition successfully occupied the main urban center of Nexus-18, and attempted to capture all Foundation assets or Foundation-allied civilians for internment and/or interrogation, while planning to invade Site-87. However, Narrative forces within Nx-18 greatly hindered Coalition efforts in several ways:\n\n* An unexpected reunion between an agent of the Coalition and her former grieving fiancé, who believed her to be dead, causing an entire Strike Team to turn against Bowe's forces;\n* A group of teenagers incapacitating several agents and stealing weaponry and supplies, which were then used to fortify various schools within the city;\n* The sudden re-emergence of UAE-Chapman-971 (\"The Jamburglar\"), whose presence hindered broadcasts and transmissions sent by Coalition forces;\n* Several dozen survivalists distributing a vast array of weaponry to citizens trained to use it, while simultaneously providing shelter to civilians in bunkers of currently unknown size.\n\nThis culminated in Martin Bowe breaching the entrance to Site-87, whereupon he attempted to reach the Director's office in what is speculated to be an assassination attempt. The Director had been evacuated several hours previously; instead, he found Dr. Sinclair and Consultant Reynolds. While severely injured, with Sinclair nearly losing her unborn child, both had survived and were recovering.\n\nMartin Bowe attempted to use energy from the Oriykaklos Codex to subdue Sinclair and Reynolds. The pair of them had been exposed to the Codex for over a month prior to Bowe's acquisition of the object, which caused the object to become attuned with their being. This, in turn, allowed Sinclair to work a rite which removed it from Bowe's possession, and placed it into the Foundation's.\n\nBowe's body was then subjected to the 'weight' of Malignant Narrative he had carried since his entry into Sloth's Pit, causing cardiac arrest. He is currently in critical condition, but is expected to recover and stand trial.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal fancyborder\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+* {{INPUT OVERSEER CREDENTIALS:}}\n\n@@ @@\n\n//I am the author of rebirth//\n//In fire, water, air and earth//\n//Despised, I stand alone//\n//But when the truth be known//\n\n[[html]]\n<body>\n<center>\n<form onsubmit=\"checkPswd();\">\n    <label for=\"pswd\"></label>\n    <input type=\"password\" id=\"pswd\">\n    <input type=\"button\" value=\"SUBMIT\" onclick=\"checkPswd();\" />\n</form>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n   function checkPswd() {\n    var confirmPassword = \"IWILLNOTFADE\";\n    var spacedPassword = \"I WILL NOT FADE\";\n    var password = document.getElementById(\"pswd\").value;\n     if (password.toUpperCase() == confirmPassword || password.toUpperCase() == spacedPassword) {\n   window.open('/scp-6500/offset/10');\n}\n  else{\n     alert('INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE; REVENANT IMMERSION UNSUCCESSFUL.
