It has no rules that bind it, it has no demands - aside from taking that one deep dive during the process of creation.\n\nWhat's Flow? It's when you sit down and just create. When things just go along nicely in your head and when you simply do art. Don't you have a feeling sometimes that it's not you that drives the piece but the piece that drives you? You're in the zone, you are fully immersed, you enjoy what you do.\n\nIn the universe where there are things that exist outside our perception, Flow is a bit more than that. It's something you reach out to, unconsciously, during act of creation to infuse your work with it - to make it abnormal, anomalous, suddenly eager to disobey all known rules.\n\nAnyone can do it. Some find it easy, some can try and try again and never achieve it. Flow is capricious like that. Or maybe it has its own rules and patterns that artists can tap into? Nobody knows for sure. It just exists, and there are people out here that know how to use it for their own goals. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n------\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+++ Characters\n\n> **Martha Jenerous** - A former anartist.
