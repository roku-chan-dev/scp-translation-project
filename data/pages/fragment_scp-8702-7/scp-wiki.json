It has since been converted into Area-8702, with accommodations and living quarters for 50 researchers and 100 armed security personnel. Study of the interior of SCP-8702 is ongoing, conducted through exterior observation and radar analysis. Exploration of SCP-8702, whether manned or remotely operated, may not be attempted until the O5 Council has given permission.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8702 is a dimensional aperture located in the men's bathroom of a Chipotle franchise at the [REDACTED] Professional Complex in Evanston, Illinois. From what can be observed from the bathroom corridor, the interior of SCP-8702 is a lightless cave composed of a white, chalky substance that has yet to be identified. Natural rock formations in the cave take the shape of the contents of the bathroom that once occupied that restaurant.\n\nThe cave extends beyond the reaches of the building's layout, with a tunnel extending from a hole in the wall an additional 115 meters before curving eastward. The size of this cave is not currently known.\n\nDust particulates from within SCP-8702 stick to the open doorway like an invisible film. It is not believed that solid matter can exit SCP-8702. Whether SCP-8702 can be breached externally is not currently known.\n\nSCP-8702-A is an entity living within SCP-8702. It takes the appearance of a human girl between the ages of 10 and 13 dressed in blue pajamas. SCP-8702-A has been seen milling about the interior of SCP-8702, humming unidentifiable songs, and drawing abstract, shapeless pictures in the dust. --It has not yet acknowledged the presence of containment staff, nor does it appear to understand speech.-- **[PENDING REVISION]**\n\n**Discovery:** On 1/14/2023, the anomaly was discovered by Mr. Garrett Mathis, a cashier at the restaurant. He had opened the door after working hours, discovering the suite in its anomalous state.\n\nWhen the Foundation investigated and took control of the building, Mr. Mathis was detained, questioned, and released after being given Class-A amnestics.\n\n> **Incident Log - SCP-8702-A First Contact**\n> **Date:** 1/28/2023\n> **Time:** 04:13 AM CST\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //[Containment specialists Kayla Dobbs and Carl Waller sits at the observation post in the corridor outside SCP-8702.
