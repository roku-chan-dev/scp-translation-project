This trend is an uptick in //short articles//. Is this a sign of a Series I renaissance? Is it a rebellion from the status quo of longer articles that has developed over the years? Is this the future direction of the SCP Wiki?\n\nThe early days of the SCP project witnessed a vast majority of shorter articles over longer ones. Part of it was due to being modeled after the original [[[SCP-173]]], part of it was simply the culture of the time believing that an SCP had to be short, and part of it was simply a lack of connectivity and world-building that would not be established for years to come. As the SCP project found its footing, more and more themes and narratives found their place and began to flourish within an increasing number of articles. With the addition of these new stories and tools to work with, writers went on to incorporate this \"lore\" into their own articles and further fuel their own narratives. Does this mean that SCP was on a collision course for a unified canon? I wouldn't go that far. We have always established a clear sentiment that there is no canon, but that doesn't mean that stories and this universe we have created do not end up intersecting in interesting and unique ways. Regardless of the way you see it, this movement of bringing narratives together has in general increased the average length of works on the site. There have always been new short articles, however, but over the years we have seen a number of long articles with fascinating stories that would not typically be accepted if we were still in the days of Series I. It is certainly for the better that we now have this diversity in methods of story-telling and word count. The possibilities nowadays are //almost// endless.\n\nSo, is this some grand movement to return to the old days? Nah, that would be a travesty. But while we have this little reminiscent burst of this style of articles, treat yourself to a nice short read and cup of tea on me.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ SCP News\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"gallery-frame\"]]\n[[image https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524295654638354443/885227749650858074/unknown.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"placard\"]]Artwork by [http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/seraphannim Seraphannim][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Site News\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ Daveyoufool Opens Up\n[[/=]]\n\nIn the [[[interviewing-icons-daveyoufool|newest edition]]] of the [[[interviewing-icons-hub|Interviewing Icons]]] series, WhiteGuard and Elenee Fishtruck interview the man who could easily be called the SCP Wiki's Comedy King - daveyoufool.

What can we do to help show them short, sweet stuff?\" A new page was made, [[[shortest-pages-this-month|the shortest pages this month]]], and hopefully this will help show people that short stuff is constantly being made. Whether intentionally, by accident, or just as sheer coincidence, the amount of shorter articles in the past month has significantly grown. Having so much more short reads and having them all organized neatly on one page has certainly helped the \"pick up and read\" experience many people needed right now.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Offsite News\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ Wanderer's Library: Wandercon 2021\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Wanderer's Library is hosting [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wandercon-2021 it's first team contest]!

The skit was probably just meant to be a quick, funny reference, but ended up garnering over 25 million views in a few days and inadvertently launched an avalanche of online publicity for the article. Thousands of videos and dozens of news articles were made in response to the trend, most of which unfortunately failed to name anyone involved in the article's creative process. Fortunately, some publishings retroactively added names into their articles, and many authors started adding info modules to their articles to help combat this problem in the future.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ International News\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ Italian Branch's Summer 2021 Contest!\n[[/=]]\n\n//From Siddartha Alonne over at -IT//: \"Sun, mountains, beaches and containment cells\".

That it’s static, infinitely old, and that the night sky is full of so many stars that’s infinitely bright and it fucking burns my retinas. Stars everywhere. An incredibly dense wall of light with endless rays subtended by endless angles. You open your mouth to scream but it’s also full of stars. \n\n\nThis is known as Olber’s Paradox, and was one of the first hints that the universe was more complicated than we gave it credit for. With the dawn of the Copernican model[[footnote]] A helio-centric solar system [[/footnote]] and Newtonian gravity, we found ourselves dealing with two fundamental questions.\n\nThe first was that if the earth was not the center of the universe, what was? Was there even a center? And more pressingly, Newtonian mechanics required an infinite and homogenous universe so as not to collapse under its own weight. So how many stars were there? And how bright should the night sky be? Let’s consider a spherical shell of thickness //dr//, homogenous star number density //n//, and radius //r//. For simplicity, we’re going to assume all stars have the same radius as our sun - [[$r^{2}_{\\odot}~=~7~\\times~10^8~m~$]]. \n\nThis would give us [[$4 \\pi r^{2} dr n~$]] stars in this shell, where each would cover fraction [[$\\pi r^{2}_{\\odot} dr n~$]] of the night sky. So! For a section of the sky roughly the size of the sun (from our point of view!), we can look at [[$\\pi r^{2}_{\\odot} R n~$]] and find //R// such that this fraction is equal to 1. \n\nNow, you may notice that this fraction goes linearly with //R//. And that //R//, the radius that we’re integrating out to, is infinity. \n\nObviously that’s kind of a problem. Stars will definitely occlude other stars, so a cylindrical cross section would be a more accurate integral, but this is a writing website and not a maths class. So I think it’s suffice to say that any nonzero stellar density will result in this section of the sky being entirely full of stars from our eyes. The entirety of the night sky is about 180,000 times larger than that singular patch, so naturally the night sky is 180,000 times more intense than sunlight. \n\nWait. Shit. \n\nOk, ok. What if the stars are just arranged in a pattern where they’re all hiding behind the ones we can see? What, that’s weird and disquieting? Uh, ok, ok. What if there was some interstellar medium that was absorbing the light? Yeah! Yeah, ok. Ok. So there’s some interstellar medium, let’s say dust[[footnote]]Anything in space that is not measured in solar masses is dust[[/footnote]]. And it’s absorbing 180,000 times the energy of the sun at any given moment. Hold on, I’m getting a call from my thermodynamicist. \n\nOk - she’s telling me that there’s no material that can infinitely absorb energy and that it would start diffusing energy once it’s reached thermal equilibrium. \n\nSo… Where do we go from here? We all live in an era where things like the Big Bang (thanks Penzias and Wilson!) and the accelerating expansion of the universe (thanks Riess and Perlmutter!) are commonplace and widely accepted. But this wasn’t always the case, and I think the fact that it took us till the early 20th century to properly dissuade ourselves of the notion speaks to how deep the belief in a static and infinite universe ran. But thanks to the efforts of cosmologists and astronomers like  Einstein, Friedmann, Walker, Robertson, Lemaitre, Hubble, and others, we now know the resolution to Olber’s Paradox. The night sky is not infinitely bright because the universe is //young//. Modern stars and galaxies formed 1-10 Gigayears after the Big Bang[[footnote]]Our error bars are in gigayears, yes.[[/footnote]]. And the universe is not endlessly irradiated because of its expansion - leftover radiation from the Big Bang has been redshifted into the microwave band. \n\nUntil relatively recently, cosmology has relied on four key assumptions:\n\n1. The laws of physics apply at all points.\n2. The universe is homogenous.\n3. The universe is static.\n4. The universe is infinite.\n\nOlber's paradox is only resolved because we now know that the last two assumptions are not true. And that's what makes Olber's so interesting. The universe is so much smaller but so much more interesting than we had ever thought it would be, and if it wasn't, well, I wouldn't have banged my dang knee the other night cause it was so dark. Because, as we all know, the night sky is full of stars.\n\n> **Next month:** Riemann gives uncontroversial takes on Author Avatars\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Riemann//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Tidestrider.jpg|caption=by [https://www.instagram.com/tide_strider/?utm_medium=copy_link Tidestrider]|width=340px|align=left]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Captain's Log: Date 002\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//Comedy 101: A Probability and Statistics Course//[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\nIn theme with my fellow columnist completely disregarding our target demographic to write about cosmology, I decided I'd one up him: I'll write about something nobody cares about on a writing site (math) and also something I have no qualification for (being funny). I do feel like I have to take this approach though, since humor is generally considered such a flippant and nebulous genre to write. The rules of comedy has always been:\n\n> 1. If they laugh, you've done it right\n> 2. There is no second rule\n\nSo, instead of talking about what goes into making an individual joke land, I want to take a look at how jokes and comedy manifest in SCP articles specifically. Be it a -J or a funny mainlister, SCP humor has to find a way to make a reader laugh (or at least smirk) within the confines of the format.[[footnote]] Yes, I see you in the back with your hand up. Yes I have heard of format screws. We're going to pretend they don't exist today. You can put your hand down.[[/footnote]] Approaches to the \"funny SCP\" challenge are incredibly diverse, so it's difficult to make broad sweeping remarks, or try to categorize them all. So, instead of using hand-wavey, poorly defined terms like \"stinger\" and \"tone\", how about we talk about comedy in certain terms. Let's use some math.\n\nI want to start by defining some measurements you can make in a comedic article:\n\n# **Length (L):** It's literally just word count. It's always some non-negative integer.\n# **Joke Count (J,,c,,):** The number of moments in the article where the reader is supposed to laugh. Also always a non-negative integer.\n# **Joke Intensity (J,,i,,):** How funny any individual \"Joke Moment\" is supposed to be[[footnote]] Ok, so we're getting a //little// hand-wavey[[/footnote]]. If you're an economist you can quantify this as utility? I think?\n# **Joke Success Rate (P(J)):** How likely any single joke is to land. It's just a probability so it'll always be some number between zero and one. \n\nNow that we've defined these terms, we can use them to calculate things![[footnote]] Yaaay arithmetic![[/footnote]] We'll start with something that I think can be used to characterize comedic articles, and might even be a useful measure meant for your own joke articles! It's called **Joke Density (J,,d,,)**.\n\n[[math]]\nJ_d = \\frac{J_c}{L}\n[[/math]]\n\nIt's the frequency of jokes in an article. Knowing that an article has only 1 joke or 10 jokes means something, but that changes if there's 1 joke in a 100 word article or 10 jokes in a 5000 word article.\n\nWhich now brings me to a joke-to-joke value we can calculate: **Expected Joke Intensity (E[J,,i,,])**. On its face, any individual joke for any single reader has one of two values: its joke intensity, or zero. It either lands, or it doesn't[[footnote]] Oh, you want to mention that jokes aren't equally funny for everyone because they have different senses of humor? Well, we're operating with large sample sizes so we get to assume that everyone follows a similar humor model that has some sort of average. We'll chalk \"sense of humor\" up to variance.[[/footnote]]. However, we can use the expected value of a joke's intensity to estimate, on average, how funny it will be for any given reader. Luckily, expected value is pretty easy to calculate here:\n\n[[math]]\nE[J_i] = J_i\\times P(J)\n[[/math]]\n\nNow, preferably we want to maximize [[$ E[J_i] $]] for every joke in our article, but that's rarely the case. However, given that we can't necessarily always do this, we can see that different types of jokes can have similar [[$ E[J_i] $]]. For example, a joke that requires some obscure knowledge, but lands hard for its target audience could score the same as a more accessible joke that causes an exhale rather than a guffaw.\n\n[[$ E[J_i] $]] is a useful value for talking about individual jokes, but how do we turn this into a measurement of an entire article? We would want to combine all of these values together. Now, the solution here seems obvious... you just add them together. Usually in probability, you don't just get to add probabilities together, but expected values abide by Linearity of Expectation[[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#Basic_properties I told you, the math is the part of this I am qualified to talk about.][[/footnote]]. So, if we defined all of the jokes in an article [[$ A $]] as the set [[$ A_J $]], then we can define **Expected Article Humor (E[A])** as:\n\n[[math]]\nE[A] = \\sum_{J \\in A_J} E[J_i]\n[[/math]]\n\nThis tells us now how funny our article is in its entirety (in expectation)! Its a way to homogenize how articles with high quantities of jokes can sometimes equal a single high quality joke. But instead of looking at articles in some sort of monolithic categories, we now have a //continuous measurement// of how effective a comedy article is! We can compare rapid fire and shaggy dog, anecdote with knock knock. All humor bows before our numbers!\n\nExcept, we are still missing one last aspect, which we briefly mentioned before: time. See, people want to feel rewarded for their time investment in reading your article. So let's round this off with one final value: **Expected Laughter Frequency Per Article (E[L_t])**:\n\n[[math]]\nE[L_t] = E[A]/L\n[[/math]]\n\nAnd now, we have done it. A measurement to unify all humor articles. How much laughter you will get out of how much time investment. We can optimize all of our comedy, apply a minimum expected laughter frequency threshold, GATE KEEP HARDER.\n\nExcept well, there's the obvious issue that everyone probably pointed out at the very beginning: you can't really put numbers to like, most of this. \n\nYeah, humor is subjective. But making sure //you as a writer// know what makes this worth reading //to you// is important. Do I have a high joke density with medium payoffs? Or am I promising my reader the funniest punchline they've ever seen after 2000 words? Or maybe I just want to have the whole essence of the article be funny without any big set up, and let little consistent moments of humor bring the reader along? If you follow the steps above, and believe you're executing on these all correctly, they //should// come out to a similar [[$ E[L_t] $]]. \n\nWhich brings me back to the first rule of comedy. \"iI they laugh, you've done it right\". If you go through these steps, and end up with a high enough value that you're happy with, that means at least one person should probably be laughing at your article. It's not like there's a correct way to go about writing humor, in the first place. All the different methods you'll see on the site have a chance at scoring highly on our silly little scale. But when you're  writing, you only have your guts to go off. This brings me to my proposed amendment to the first rule of comedy. Captain Kirby's new decree from on high. All writers who break this rule shall be stripped of their comedy license:\n\n> 1. If //you// laugh, you've done it right\n> 2. There is no second rule\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By CaptainKirby//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Rounder Table\n[[/div]]\nPrompts from your favorite house, thoughts from your favorite authors - all about the genre of SCP writing!\n@@ @@\n+++ //**Prompt:** What makes an effective critique comment?//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDoing critique on the SCP wiki is unlike most other forms of feedback, and each form of critique on the wiki is unlike the others. When doing critique on ideas or drafts, you are helping the author form and build their concept into something that could be posted publicly and, as a result, you are sharing your own techniques or ideas for them to consider and build on their own. However, when doing critique in a comment on a posted work, the skillset is very different. Instead of giving advice on how to build the article from the ground up, you are looking at the work set in front of you and figuring out where it works for you and what the author could do to specifically earn your vote.\n\nTo do this, it is important to keep two things in mind: 1) is this a flaw or is it just not written by me and 2) what //would// I like to have seen in this article? The first one is an important thing to consider because many commenters can confuse articles that do something different than a typical article with being a bad article, and recognizing this can turn complaining about the article into constructive critique. For example, saying “This format is garbage” helps nobody while “the formatting of this article makes it annoying to read or difficult to understand” is a flaw that the author could choose to address. And the second is important for framing a critique as an actual critique. Instead of just listing things you don’t like, it is more helpful to list what you would have specifically liked to see. Listing only problems often leads to solutions you don’t want and don’t help anyone.\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Pedagon//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nCritique on posted works is fundamentally different from critique on drafts - in the drafting stage you're giving live input onto the draft as it forms and takes shape and grows. A draft is a sketch; a posted article is the painting hanging in the gallery. The way you approach critiquing a sketch and a portrait is the gulf of difference we're talking about here.\n\nIn the draft stage, radically reworking an entire premise is a practical, if oft-unwanted solution to outstanding issues. When dealing with an article completed and posted to the mainlist, suggesting that people write an entirely different article isn't practical at all. Critique on posted works needs to be practically actionable. You can suggest changes in structure and style but the key thing to keep in mind is that your suggestions - and you //should// make suggestions, because critique without suggestions to go on isn't very helpful at all - should be addressing and amending the issues with pacing/characterization/whatever, not attempting to fundamentally change the basis of the story.\n\nObviously there are exceptions to this, no one critique fits all, but it's a good thing to keep in mind. That you need to provide suggestions and a //direction// for the critique to be applied in. Pointing out flaws in articles is incredibly easy - presenting how to shift those issues and fix them is the mark of good critique.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Alan Smithee//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nWhen it comes to \"good critique\" there's no one size fits all answer, as it's so heavily dependent on what you're critiquing. That said, there are some things that I've seen in my experience that stand out as the most effective. One of the main things I try to do where possible is find something that I like about the author's idea/work or point out what they do right. Letting them know \"hey, this part is good and I want to see more of that\" is fundamental to letting them know what to build off of.\n\nThe second thing is to just explain yourself. If you don't like something, explain why that is. Was the story too slow? Were the characters not well constructed? Let the author know these things, because simply saying \"I didn't like this\" or \"This sucked\" doesn't actually tell the author where to improve. When in doubt, over explain yourself a bit.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By fabledtiefling//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Artist's Shoutout\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+* ~ Wendipeligo ~\n\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"margin: -0.75rem auto 0.5rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; justify-content: center; grid-gap: 0.15rem;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nav:side/social-twitter.png link=\"https://twitter.com/Wendipeligo\" alt=\"Twitter\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nav:side/social-instagram.png link=\"https://www.instagram.com/wendipeligo/\" alt=\"Instagram\"]]\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/site-news-workbench/amino.png link=\"http://aminoapps.com/p/znt29k\" alt=\"Amino\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]//SCP-173 - The Sculpture - The Original//[[/span]][[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/site-news-workbench/173_wendipeligo.jpg link=\"https://twitter.com/Wendipeligo\" style=\"width:50%;\"]][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span class=\"placard\"]]//Wendipeligo, also known as Clay, is an American artist who started on Amino. They take great joy in drawing the Foundation's creepy creatures (but mostly the cats). They also tend to take a lot of creative liberties with SCP designs, leading to some interesting products.//[[/span]]\n\nNow, you started drawing SCP work on Amino, and have since branched out to platforms like Twitter. How did you start drawing in general and for the SCP Wiki?\n\n> Art has been something I've had great interest in since before I can even remember. I grew up with a family that highly encouraged my art, and always supported it, no matter what I drew. I had a lot of great role models and friends within the artist community that inspired me greatly to draw and improve my artwork, and it lead to me exploring different aspects and styles of artwork; especially when it came to more taboo/horror themes. SCP came into my life at a super crucial turning point for my art, and has been such a big factor in a lot of what I create to this day. My SCP artworks are some of the most consistently up-kept themes, to the point that I now use certain pieces to gauge how far my skills as an artist have evolved by redrawing recurring pieces almost yearly :)\n\nThat's awesome you have such support, and your progress certainly shows. If I may cite a specific piece, your SCP-173 redesign artwork, what inspired you to work on this piece and what was your process making it/your artistic process in general?\n\n> My SCP-173 work is definitely one of my most out there designs, especially when it comes to SCPs that have an already generally agreed upon appearance. It's actually one I tend to avoid due to its popularity, as most designs follow the original article image pretty faithfully. However, I drew some inspiration from the sculptor Bruno Catalano, who's sculptures tend to be missing substantial parts, and yet can still stand freely. I wanted to implement a bit of their work, as well as that classic marble sculptor feel, just with a bit of modern day elements mixed in, thus the rebar that now runs its course through the entirety of SCP-173. The piece itself actually took several months to be finished, as while I enjoyed the original sketch and was happy with the design, I hit a bit of an art rut where I wasn't entirely happy with what I was producing. And so, SCP-173 became a highly experimental piece, simply finished in a way that brought me joy, leaving lots of room for error and improvement, and, of course, some fun colors.\n> \n> My general artistic process is total chaos, start to finish. The moment I have an idea in my head for a piece, I usually try to take my time to get down a sketch of it before I forget; however, when it comes to works that I'm genuinely excited to work on, I do tend to be a bit impatient and skip the planning process entirely, going straight in for lineart/colors. It definitely plays a big factor in how long it can take to finish, as some works can be anywhere between 2-3 hours all the way up to 10+ hours, excluding any breaks I may take in between. I've got a couple sitting around that higher marker that still aren't even a quarter of the way finished. Typically I can get a few pieces down in a day if I sit down with some music on, but my art styles are all so varied that each piece is a bit difficult to prepare for, but definitely keeps me entertained as I never know what might inspire my work that day.\n\nI can sympathize with that notion of chaos. With that in mind, how has your style (or styles) developed into its current form, and how do you think it'll develop moving forward?\n\n> My style used to be very... nit-picky, I suppose I would describe it? I would spend a LOT of time striving for perfection, searching for ways to make sure it looked as clean as humanely possible, and as pleasing to the eye as can be. However, over the years, I've learned to loosen up on my art a ton, and it has definitely changed my artwork for the better by making things far less stressful and focusing on what I love doing, versus striving for a perfection that will only turn art into a chore. I hope to continue to improve, while still teaching myself to let go of perfection, and implement more of what I personally enjoy as an artist :)\n\nWith the styles you've developed, which artists inspire you, both off and potentially on the wiki?\n\n> So many! I definitely find a lot of inspiration in the artwork of my acquaintances, both on and off the wiki. UncertaintyCrossing and Sebarus are always super inspiring, whether they realize it or not. I also find a lot of inspiration in artists like xianta, who I don't believe to be on the wiki, but they share a lot of wonderful art on their tiktok and their tutorials are honestly a godsend in learning grayscale painting. There are so many wonderful, talented artists out there that I honestly wish I could list them all, as even in passing glances, I learn new techniques and different little art quirks from artists that might never know the type of impact they have on the art of others.\n\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]//SCP-049 - Plague Doctor//[[/span]][[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/site-news-workbench/049_wendipeligo.jpg link=\"https://twitter.com/Wendipeligo\" style=\"width:47%;\"]][[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]//SCP-860 - Blue Key//[[/span]][[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/site-news-workbench/860_wendipeligo.jpg link=\"https://twitter.com/Wendipeligo\" style=\"width:53%;\"]][[/span]] _\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\n//SCP-939 - With Many Voices//[[/span]][[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/site-news-workbench/939_wendipeligo.jpg link=\"https://twitter.com/Wendipeligo\" style=\"width:100%;\"]][[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Onsite Art this Month\n[[/=]]\n\n* [[[jimmyboyhaha-art|jimmyboyhaha art (real) (not fake)]]] created by JimmyBoyHaha\n* [[[THE YEEN PAGE]]] created by totallynotenby\n* [[[eddybird-art-page-or-sth|👉👉👉eddybird art page or sth👉👉]]] created by eddybird\n* [[[insomnianemu-epitaph|Comicalize Epitaph]]] created by InsomniaNEMU\n* [[[jadeitor-s-art-gallery|Jadeitor's Art Gallery]]] created by Jadeitor\n* [[[insomnianemu-art|Artwork for a sleepless night]]] created by InsomniaNEMU\n* [[[scp-nondescript-department-icons|Nondescript Department Icons]]] created by Fish^12\n* [[[art:cole-s-movie-night|COLE'S MOVIE NIGHT]]] created by Cole 13\n* [[[art:cole-s-photo-gallery|Cole's Photo Gallery]]] created by Cole 13\n* [[[art:estrella-illustration-desk|EstrellaYoshte's Illustration Desk]]] created by EsrellaYoshte\n* [[[art:whitneys-unfinished-art|Whitneys unfinished art]]] created by Dr Whitney\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Interview of the Month\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ July spotlight: [[[SCP-6336]]] - Seeing Myself Blink\n+++++ Featuring: Lamentte\n+++++ Interviewer: Elenee FishTruck\n\n------\n\n+++ Interview\n[[/=]]\n\nHeya, Lamentte! I want to discuss your most recent article, SCP-6336, currently your highest rated article and one of the few SCPs on the entire wiki to reach +100 within 24 hours. A major achievement! But first, some background: You posted your [[[scp-4255|first article]]] nearly three years ago, but you've made no small impact since then, your [[[scp-5666|highest-rated skip]]] before SCP-6336 reaching +255. How have you developed as a writer on the SCP Wiki from your beginnings up to now?\n\n> I feel generally my experience on the SCP Wiki has really helped me grasp a lot of writing concepts over the years, even if that growth is somewhat subconscious. I feel looking back that I have most grown my ability to see each individual element of a story/writing and be able to figure out what's working and what's not working to forward the narrative, which is something that's even more important on a site that's whole deal most of the time is a concise tone.\n\nConcise is correct! Now, while you posted SCP-6336 recently, you've worked on this idea for a while, to my understanding. Where did the concept for SCP-6336 originate, and how did it develop from conception to completion?\n\n> I'm not entirely sure where the concept originated, actually, but I know that the base idea was in my head for a long while (that being like, \"reflection does a bad job and then gets arrested\") before I wrote the initial draft of it. The first draft was meant to be the shorted non-format screw scp, which I succeed in at the time, but I quickly realized that it may be too short in that state. So I did what any normal person would do: left in my sandbox untouched for 5 months! After that, I abandoned the restriction of \"THE shortest\" and beefed it up a little and polished it around the edges. I showed people it, people liked it, then I posted it and people REALLY liked it. I very much regret letting it sit in my sandbox for almost half a year now, haha.\n\nWell, at least people have taken to it now. When you posted it, an August wave of popular short SCPs (ex. [[[SCP-6101]]], [[[SCP-6799]]], and [[[SCP-6150]]]) had started to sweep the site, and would continue afterward largely due to your article! What, to you, is the general appeal of short articles compared to meatier narratives (ex. several of the [[[scp6000contesthub|6kcon]]] entries which dominated May and June)? How does this apply to SCP-6336?\n\n> I guess I didn't really realize there was a wave of short SCPs before I posted 6336. I can get why people are fond of short articles though. There's a pretty common criticism that I see a handful of people make when talking about SCP, essentially that it's \"too complicated\" or \"too long\", which in some cases can be true, and it can be kinda harrowing for a new user to read a really lore-dense SCP oftentimes. However, short-form articles avoid both of those critiques just by nature of their construction. While some can still have complexity, the length of them is more inviting for people who browse casually, while still being enjoyable by hardcore fans if the writing's good enough. This applies to 6336 specifically because it's particularly very far from both those aforementioned complaints, it's the shortest SCP in the last 30 days, and the concept and narrative aren't super complicated for most to understand. Instead, the minimalist implications leave people space to mentally write their own continuation of the broader idea of what's going on.\n\nCertainly all these attributes contributed to its success, especially after the many several-thousand-word epics released just a month or two prior. How do you imagine SCP-6336's reception given you posted it at another time?\n\n> I don't think it would really be all that different if I had posted it earlier in the year, I've seen a lot of short-form SCPs do well over the years, it's just now that they've built more momentum in their broader popularity. I do wonder how it would do if I were to have posted it later though, I'm not sure if people would dismiss it as riding The Shortwagon because of its simplicity, but at the same time, it would've still been the same words and everything, so it might have done just fine and I may just be paranoid.\n\nMakes enough sense. Given the existence of this \"Shortwagon\" as of late, how do you believe trends of this nature develop, and do you think they will emerge in the future?\n\n> I think they develop from writers seeing other writers do something that readers like and wanting to do something to capture a similar essence to that initial thing. This can be writing less, writing more, writing about a new GoI, writing about a gang of vampirous alpaca bikers (this is my idea now, nobody's allowed to steal it), or just whatever else seems to catch people's interest at the time. The site's not just collaborative in the realm of lore and setting, but also in the way each author builds off of each other, sometimes not even from criticism, but from seeing other authors do something and then being inspired to try something in the same vein.\n\nWell, thank you for serving as that inspiration with your wonderful article, and thank you for partaking in this interview!\n\n> No problem!

Along with this, if you so desire, direct links to the relevant threads will be included if you wish to read the details in full: http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14192777/august-2021-recap\n\nRight out of the gate -- on the first of the month, staff members OptimisticLucio and UncertaintyCrossing posted the [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14152698/discussion-art-restructuring-proposal Art Restructuring Proposal] discussion to O5 (main site mirror thread can be found [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14153639/art-restructuring-proposal here]). The aim of the proposal is to make artists and their work on the site more visible, in an effort to resolves concerns brought up by community members consulted by the relevant staffers. The bulk of the proposal denotes that -- to increase visibility and traffic to the work of on-site artists, they would be allowed to create separate pages under a new page category. This would consist of one or more stand-alone galleries outside of an artist's artwork page.  \n\nOn the 10th of August, staff member gee0765 forwarded an [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14167391/discussion-unarchival 'Unarchival' policy] to both O5 Command and the main site for discussion (main site mirror can be found [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14167393/discussion-unarchivals#post-5050925 here]). The new policy was drafted following talk in staff chat; noting that there is no formal process by which an -ARC article can be unarchived and/or deleted. To resolve this, the proposed solution would establish that any OS+ staff member would be allowed to put up a vote for the unarchival of a designated page. Said votes would have a duration of one week, and a simple majority vote is necessary. \n\nOS user OCuin, on the 20th,  -- posted the '[*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14172660/discussion-what-is-vice-captaincy What is vice-captaincy?]' discussion thread on O5. The goal of the thread was to determine key features regarding the roles of Vice-Captains among staff teams. Among the topics of the conversation: main points included determining powers and purposes of the the VC position. \n\nThe next day, Limeyy posted a [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14173430/team-restructuring-published-works-review-and-discussion-pwr follow-up discussion thread] regarding the previously proposed PWRD team -- to functionally replace the now-defunct Site Crit team. Essentially, as noted just before, with Site Crit being dead, a new team would be established to take on and reimagine the initial tasks delegated to the former group. Moreover, they would also serve to revive the rapidly deteriorating #thecritters channel on SkipIRC. The generality of the thread revolved around a [*http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/collab:pwrd3 sandbox draft] of the in-depth responsibilities that would be held by the hypothetical team. \n\nWoedenaz notes that the interwiki portion of the side bar is incompatible with a number of CSS themes. They post a [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14171991/discussion-interwiki-sidebar-replacement discussion thread] on O5 regarding a fix. Some modifications to Tech and CSS Policy would be needed for this change. \n\nOn the 31st, Rounderhouse opens up a thread about [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14184007/discussion-raising-tag-consideration-minimums changing the minimum requirements for some classes of tags]. It would change the number of articles/authors required to have a tag implemented for attribute/character/GoI/canon tags. \n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Staff Spotlight: [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/technical-staff-main | Technical Team]]]\n+++++ Featuring: stormbreath\n+++++ Interviewer: WhiteGuard\n\n------\n\n+++ Interview\n[[/=]]\n\nAlright, stormbreath. Why don't we start out by talking a little about what the Technical team actually does and what you personally do as a Captain of it?\n\n> So the Technical Team is responsible for managing Technical assets on the wiki — anything involving the infastructure of the site or needing some outside coding knowledge to handle. Our primary duties under that label are handling CSS and managing tags on the wiki. These aren't all we do, but they're the most common things that we handle. Another critical duty is handling javascript and html, as Wikidot allows users to add their own html to articles through [@@[html]]@@ blocks. Sometimes, this html has problems, and needs attention. A recent duty we've been dealing with is the switch from http to https, which we were recently able to get configured for the wiki. We also work with the Wikijump Team (although many of us are on it) to help Project Foundation along.\n> \n> Some common tasks that we handle on the Tech Team are looking over tag requests and determing if we should meet them, taking themes and approving them for posting, doing the same sort of thing for components or answering questions users have about formatting and Wikidot syntax in #site11. Alongside these, we tend to have a lot of unique, one-off projects to help try and improve site function. For instance, a few months ago we worked on html meta tags to better improve what the site looks to when you drop a link to it on Twitter, Discord or many other platforms.\n\nWould you care to share a little about your journey from regular Tech member to Captain? Did you have a lot of experience with Wikidot code and such before joining or was it a \"learn on the fly\" kind of thing?\n\n> I was recruited as a Tech Staff in May 2018. At that time, I already had a decent amount of experience with Wikidot code and CSS — in fact, the initial circumstances of my recruitment was fixing up a CSS theme really quick while hanging out in #site11 and getting asked to join Tech by Magnus as a result. Since then, I was on the team for about a year and half, doing work for the team on a regular and consistent basis. Although I went in to the team with a pretty good handle on Wikidot formatting and other Technical elements, my time on the team resulted in me sharpening those skills and getting a lot more experience, so it's a bit of a mixture of prior experience and learning as I went. Getting Captain happened earlier this year, when Magnus offered me the position. At that point, aismallard and I were doing a lot of the work for the team, so the Captaincy seemed to make sense on that basis.\n\nSpeaking of elevating position, you were part of the recent batch of candidates to be elevated to the position of administrator. How does it feel to be an admin for the SCP Wiki? Has anything changed for you yet?\n\n> It definitely feels weird being an admin, I have to say. For the most part, the day-to-day of staff operations haven't changed. It certainly makes a lot of Tech Captain duties easier - not needing to get ahold of an admin in order to check something out in the admin panel makes it a lot easier to do Tech work for the site. From a policy level, it's honestly less of a change than I had been expecting, although there is still something of a difference, with more work and needing to keep more of an eye on what's going on in general.\n\nSounds good. To wrap things up, I just wanted to ask a little about your somewhat recent 6000 contest entry that you worked on with your fellow Tech team Co-captain, aismallard. It ended up in third place overall, which is quite the accomplishment. What are your general sentiments about how SCP-6140 turned out and how was working with your Co-captain on something not staff-work-related?\n\n> I'm very happy with how 6140 turned out and how it ended up placing. It's definitely one of my favorite articles I've written, and it was really surprising to me that it managed to do quite as well as it did. I was certainly hoping that we would do well in the contest, but top three well out did my expectations. Working with ais was a lot of fun - we've been friends for a while even before we became Tech Captains, so working together on this was nice to finally write something together. It was somewhat funny, however, for the two Tech Captains to write an article that ultimately had nothing to do with anything related to Tech. I feel like that's kinda playing against expectations.\n\nWell, I believe that will do it. Once again, congratulations on that entry and thanks again for agreeing to this interview!\n\n> No problem!\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ New Content this Month\n[[/div]]\n\nThere is a multitude of wonderful works that are posted to the Wiki every month whether they be SCP articles, Tales, GoI Formats, Art pages, Author Pages, Essays, and more!
