Its peely yellow skin so unlike anything she could’ve ever imagined. It stretched and bent like regular skin would, though -- something that shouldn’t be. She could see the contours and crevices, as the creature’s chest moved up and down, air flowing through its nostrils in volume. Watkins felt her own breath falter within the suit.\n\nThe creature’s skin was covered with patches of brown, its limbs grossly out of place, being mere stumps to the rest of its body, twitching sporadically in all directions. She looked further along its body, seeing metal restraints tightly pressed up against it, like a dog pen for a whale, as the creature’s breathing made the restraints give off a whining sound, its body squeezing slightly beyond the cage’s limits. Watkins couldn’t see its face, but imagined it to bear a teeth-ridden, snarling expression.\n\nMarcus Nakamura was equally as frozen in place, as well as awe-struck, eyes wide. He moved toward the creature and pressed his suited hand against it, feeling the rough texture of the beast even against the layers of protective equipment. Security officer Morgan finally sprung into action, extending his hand at Nakamura’s -- he was surprised to see Watkins grabbing Nakamura’s arm before him.\n\n”Are you insane?!” she brought out with a forceful quietness, her hand digging deep into Nakamura’s wrist. Her voice sounded muffled, like speaking from the bottom of a lake. He winced a little. ”That //thing// is //NOT// a pet!”\n\nThat seemed to snap Marcus out of his thoughts, as he quickly retracted his hand from the creature, as the circumstances began to dawn on him again. ”Yes... of course,” he answered, rubbing his wrist with his hand. Sweat rolled down Watkins’ face, as she turned back to the creature, never leaving Marcus out of her sight.\n\nResearcher Matthew Liu, who was battling the urge to order the two to be brought into a room, amnesticized, and thrown back out, cleared his throat, causing all to turn toward him. He gestured to one of the guards in the chamber, also clad in centimeters of protective gear, as they nodded and gestured something else to the other guards.\n\nWatkins and Nakamura watched in horror, as Morgan moved toward the front of their bananafish, stopped half-way through, and turned toward them.\n\n”Didn’t you want to see your fish?” he asked in a manner that meant ’no’ wasn’t an answer. Without even waiting for a response, Morgan turned back around and continued walking.\n\nSeconds passed for Watkins, until something tapped her on the shoulder, causing her to flinch and scream all at the same time. Her gloved hands hit the visor of the suit, as she saw Liu looking at her with wide eyes, his hand just somewhat away from her shoulder. When she realized what had went down everyone had already turned their head toward her. She felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her, completely subsiding her fear.\n\n”Well,” Liu began, stumbling for words, ”I can assure you there is nothing to fear. It’s under heavy sedation right now, so anything it might try to do, it couldn’t do, even if it wanted to.”\n\nWatkins gulped, her mind speechless.\n\nAs the silence just permeated on, Liu averted his gaze again, giving Watkins a half-hearted pat on the shoulder, before walking to Morgan with a certain spring in his steps.\n\nLooking at the guard, who was looking back at her, before averting their gaze, and with no other option in sight, she waltzed on. Every step she took was quaking. Nakamura followed in her steps, just as squeezy as his colleague.\n\nWhen Liu caught up to Morgan, he leaned in to his ear, saying:  ”You should’ve left them at home.”\n\n”Yeah,” was all Liu could reply with.\n\nWhen they all arrived to the head of the creature, it was nothing short of breathtaking; its beady eyes were tightly shut, as its lower jaw laid on the floor, revealing row after row of razor sharp teeth, drooling. Its breath reeked of bananas, rotten, yet oddly fruity all at the same time.\n\nPearl gulped some more, her head dizzy, stemming her hands on her knees. Nakamura felt his senses go numb from the smell, as his mind couldn’t even tell what it was looking at.\n\nLiu glanced at the two; the one about to faint and the other one about to vomit, both of which would be a lot of paperwork to sort through. Before any of these scenarios could come to pass, Researcher Liu faced them, a stern expression on his face.\n\n”Would you be able to identify your fish?” he asked, just to get those two into the proper mindset -- work needed to be done.\n\nA spark flamed up in Watkins’ eyes, a brief retrieve from the new world she was in. ”We’d need s--some tests done on its genes... but with this... //thing//...” She looked at its stubby limbs, //human// limbs.\n\nLiu nodded. ”Understood. Mr. Nakamura?”\n\nNakamura snapped out of his headspace, sweat rolling down his face as he faced Liu. ”Y--yeah?”\n\n”Are you okay?”\n\nHe just nodded.\n\nLiu turned to the beast again, holding a swab between his glove-clad fingers, as he made sure to make as little noise as possible. Watkins tensed up, the swab seeping into the creature’s viscous spit, with a tint of yellow.\n\nHe heaved the sample into a plastic bag, catching himself glancing at the creature beside him, his breath heavy, as he slowly steadied himself straight again.\n\nIt felt like a weight was being lifted from his heart, only now taking in the beating in his ears. Turning to look at Morgan, rifle firmly gripped in his hands, he turned back to the two people quaking in their boots.\n\nA guard held their rifle trained between the beast’s eyes.\n\n”Easy there, Cray. Don’t wanna be too hasty,” Morgan said. The guard didn’t falter in his stance even for a bit.\n\n”We will go straight to analysis. You two can--”\n\nA low growl made Liu’s heart skip a beat. Everyone’s hearts. His hands became sweaty, his legs mere sticks that were about to break away under him, his muscles turning into jelly.\n\nAnother growl, this one even deeper and more prolonged than before, sent shivers down his spine. He felt a hand touching his shoulder, Morgan’s hand, his head spinning to him.\n\nLiu could see his colleague mouthing the words,//”Go,”// time trickling away, as he realized what he meant. Watkins and Nakamura didn’t look as shocked as he pictured them to be, but when [[[SCP-2761]]] gave off a howl of pure agony, they quickly realized the situation they found themselves in.\n\nDozens of tranquilizer darts were fired into the hide of the creature, with the guard from before unloading twice as many as the others. It growled and roared, Morgan and his squad backing away, never taking their aim off of it.\n\n”Move!” Liu yelled, taking both Watkins’ and Nakamura’s hands, whose yells and cries were at least dampened by their protective suits.\n\nNakamura breathed heavily under his suit. ”We’re all going to die!” he cried out, the tears coming out as fast as he could run.\n\n”Shut up, you’re not going to die--”\n\nIn an instant, the leg of 2761 that had been a little stump only moments prior erupted into a giant appendage, its yellow rubbery skin extending and contorting in all the wrong angles, as it grew into a full, three-clawed foot, like seeing a timelapse of a baby growing up.\n\nIts claws scratched the floor, as it suddenly heaved itself up to the ceiling, the dangling strobe lights shattering into thousands of fragments that rained onto those below. Everyone stemmed their heads into their hands, as the one guard’s suit got pierced by the fragments, being sent tumbling to the floor.\n\nThe creature stood taller than anything else in the room on its two new legs, as it roared wrinkles through the air -- Liu thought it to sound like a T-Rex, a //[[[https://youtu.be/2eqJYtFO3SI?si=QBC-QatULU6YfeJA|real]]]// T-Rex. The metal cage smashed violently against the ceiling, heaves of concrete, rebar and metal chains falling along the creature’s sides and back, dust leveling eyesight.\n\nWatkins pulled the too-stunned Nakamura, who was praying his final prayers already, out of the debris’ way, as they both fell to the floor and retreated into a foetal position.\n\nLiu, like others, was almost crushed under a piece of debris, but Morgan dived through the clouds of dust to save his colleague from a long busted metal chain, each piece as big as his head. 2761 roared some more.\n\nThe gates suddenly opened, as various more personnel, each equipped with a tranquilizer gun, rushed into the room, and quickly surrounded the entity. More guards rushed in, now equipped with something stronger than just tranquilizers.\n\nThe entity ripped apart the last chain, its metal prison in shambles before it, as it felt its eyelids slowly becoming heavier. The dark pupils told nothing to the many soldiers firing away at the creature. It could feel itself tumbling over its own feet, before it fell against the cold concrete floor, the smell of bananas even more pronounced than ever.\n\nEventually, its eyes shut tight again, and it felt the pain slowly dissipate, as it slipped back into the sweet oblivion.\n\nIt took some time for Liu to be finally on his legs again. Morgan dusted himself off, while the soldiers established a perimeter around 2761. The medics came soon after, hauling those injured out of the chamber, some unconscious and others with holes in their heads.\n\nWatkins and Nakamura were like statues, but the guards were able to haul their asses out of the chamber, too -- //like they even wanted to be in here anymore.//\n\nThe entire world around him was like a blur, until Morgan’s voice rang in his ears again, and his look wasn’t so distant anymore.\n\n”You okay, Matt?”\n\n”Y--yes... Yes, I am. You?”\n\n”Don’t worry about me,” he pointed at Watkins and Nakamura.\n\nAfter a few seconds: ”Yes... yes, of course.” He moved out of the chamber, after the two, unresponsive to the world around them as ever.\n\nAs he ran out, he could swear the creature’s beady black eyes were staring back at him.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n//The pain that reached deep down into her bones persisted, her lips still unmoving.

Although 2761 had been moved, he couldn’t stand the smell of bananas -- it made him dizzy.\n\nOn one of the larger concrete-rebar pieces sat Cray, a bandage around his left hand. The medics took a sample of his spit, the imposing stature of the man shifting awkwardly in the gear. Then the medic packed their things and waltzed passed Morgan, their eyes definitely watery.\n\n”Everything all right over there?” Morgan asked.\n\nCray rubbed his hand. \n\n”That... //thing//... what is it?” he asked.\n\n”The lab experiment of a few scientists flushed down the gutter.”\n\n”But that thing was massive!

Carlston Cray let the fire eat away at his cig, while thoughts rushed to the forefront of his mind ever-so slowly.\n\nIt had been difficult during his times. Always at the brink of starvation, balancing on the thin thread between existence and annihilation. His mother tried to do the best for him, but even he knew that it wasn’t enough, even so young. Crime was the daily, with a corrupted system tying everything together into a neat little bow.\n\nBut one day, there stepped in an organization, which offered his mother and him salvation, refuge from the shithole that had been their life -- no fear of starvation, of being robbed of the littlest of things they possessed, of not making it to tomorrow, of seperation.\n\nHis phone vibrated in his pocket.

Neither of them gave out so much as a squeak. Their stares were absent, trained to the linoleum floor, monitors and IV-drips going off in the background. Everything was seperated by pastel green curtains.\n\nAs the seconds turned into minutes on the wall-mounted clock, Marcus looked over at Pearl. Her eyes were trained on the floor, like a mannequin for display, //unmoving//, not even flinching. Marcus tapped her lightly on the shoulder, which appeared to shock her somewhat. He gave her a soft smile when she looked over at him -- the best smile he could give in such a situation. She tried to smile back.\n\n”Hey,” was the only thing Marcus could say.\n\n”Hey,” Pearl replied back. Her eyes averted back to the floor.\n\n”Everything all right?”\n\nIt took her some time to answer. ”Yes... yes.” She didn’t look him in the eyes.\n\nMarcus just nodded. ”That’s good... that’s good.”\n\nThe seconds trickled away on the clock. //Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock...//\n\nMarcus opened his mouth again, careful for his choice of words, and said: ”I want to see our bananafish again.”\n\nPearl instantly shot up from her stance of lethargy, and retreated her hand out of his. ”Are you //nuts//?!”\n\nHe tried to calm her down, but found himself lost for words; he hadn’t seen her so energetic before. ”Pearl, please... let me explain--”\n\nShe stomped her heel against the floor. ”That thing should be pumped up with toxins and be disposed of immediately!” she almost yelled. Her breathing was heavy, her hands clenched into fists.\n\nAt the mere mention of those words, Nakamura clenched his teeth; his own heart was beating rapidly now. Watkins saw this, and her anger and frustration grew into concern. ”Dispose of it? What, like what Higgins did?”\n\nPearl remained silent. //She// had never seen //him// so energetic before. ”Do you know why I joined //Aquagene//, Pearl?” He waited for her to answer, but nothing came. ”It was to //create// life, not to dispose of it the moment it displayed deviant behavior. That //’thing’// is a breathing, **//living//** creature, and you just want to //dispose// of it, like it were some broken toy or faulty product?”\n\nPearl, letting the initial wave of concern and fear wear off, spoke: ”But it //is// a faulty product. A product that could’ve killed us all, if we wouldn’t have been lucky!”\n\nThat shut both of them right up. Pearl stared into Marcus’ eyes for a little longer than was comfortable, which she took notice of, and sat down again. Marcus simply remained where he was, but he shifted a little less comfortably in his seat. Both remained silent for the remainder.\n\nMemories of his childhood crept into his mind, but he shook them off for just a moment longer.\n\nThe minutes ticked by on the clock.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n”Amnesticize them,” Site-Director Amariam Gurrira said, with no room for interpretation. Researcher Liu just looked perplexed.\n\nDirector Gurrira was in her mid-fifties, short, black hair with streakes of grey already creeping in, wrinkles adorning the edges of her face and her hands. She had been here longer than anyone else at Site-71 -- Liu still remembered their first meeting at the conference hall two decades ago.\n\n”Director, with all due respect, Drs.

You are dismissed, Researcher Liu.”\n\nBefore he could think any further thought, the lights went out.\n\nWhen they turned back on, the emergency lights plunged everything into a deep red, as the klaxons started to sound, reverberating within his ears, as the yells of guards and dozens of footsteps echoed through the narrow corridors outside. His heart was beating seventy miles per hour.\n\nDirector Gurrira tried to contact the appropriate channels, but they had all inexplicably been down, so she opted to retrieve her pistol from underneath her desk. Liu recoiled out of habit; he never was a guns person.\n\nAs she was checking how much ammunition was left in the cartridge, the door slid open, and a young guard, no older than twenty-one, stepped in.\n\n”Director,” the guard began, breathing and sweating heavily under his gear all the same, ”we’ve got a situation.”\n\n”No shit,” Gurrira replied, sliding the cartidge into her pistol. ”What kind of situation?”\n\nThe guard stammered something incomprehensible, as the world around Liu suddenly turned into a cacophony of sights, sounds, and, weirdly enough, //smells//.\n\nThe guard and director were looking at him, him struggling to stay on his two feet, holding onto his seat, as the smell invaded his nostrils, his brain.\n\nEventually, though, he regained his senses. His body adapted to that sickly smell.\n\n”Liu, what’s going on?” she asked.\n\nHe didn’t even answer. The aftertaste of the smell lingered in his brain.

There was a split second, in which Marcus could feel all of his body’s systems screeching to a halt, petrified to his soul. When the red emergency lights and the klaxons turned on in their place, he still felt as stiff as a statue, but at least he could feel the warmth in his fingertips again.\n\nA medical doctor, short, brown hair, brown eyes, face-mask obscuring their face, unknown name, rushed to the door, yelling something against the deafening klaxons. They tried their best to seem calming. They pulled out a handgun, holding their access card up against the scanner. Marcus wanted to chase after him, get a sense of what it was he had said, but the moment that door slid open, an ear-piercing rang reverberated throughout the hallway, as the sensation of wetness, warmth, and coldness hit his face and his clothes.\n\nIt took a moment for him to realize fully what was going on, as Pearl screamed and cowered between the chairs, as the rest of the infirmary erupted into a blind, loud panic.\n\nHe looked down at his clothes, felt his cheek with his hand, and saw red stains upon him, soaking into his clothes’ fabric. The squishy texture of brain matter squeezed and oozed underneath the tips of his fingers, as his arms fell limp, his legs turning into goo, and stumbled into a corner.\n\nThe corpse of the doctor laid there in the hallway, a hole where their left eye once was. Blood was seeping out of it, pooling around them in an iron-smelling, wet, warm puddle. Their hand was still clasping that handgun, their fingers tightly pressed around its hilt.\n\nFootsteps approached, but grew into a distant blur, almost dream-like, as Marcus breaths grew heavier and heavier. The moment he perceived the world around him normally again, was when the footsteps came to a halt, and another man’s hand wrapped around his. The man threw him up to his feet, and knocked him straight into the opposite wall. The blunt sensation rippled through his spine, he thought one of his ribs might’ve cracked. He hit the floor just as unmajestically.\n\nThe next thing he saw was the man, clad in heavy, face-obscuring gear and a rifle, pulling Pearl to her feet. She trembled in fear, while the other people in the room -- simple medics, injured soldiers and patients -- could only hold their hands up. Marcus looked up to see the nuzzle of the rifle being pointed straight at his forehead. The ringing dissipated, but he could still hardly understand the man at all.\n\nAs he rose to his feet, he got pushed into Pearl, the nuzzle buried in his back. The soldier shouted more indistinct phrases, and guided them into the hallway.\n\nBefore they knew it, a bullet flew through the air and pierced directly into the soldier’s neck, blood squirming everywhere. He tried to put pressure on it, but as his surroundings faded, so too did he, until the only thing left of him was a sack of meat, skin and bone.\n\nThe next few minutes passed in a hurry, Marcus and Pearl stuck in their little headspaces. Those headspaces were quickly burst, when Morgan turned both of them around, and that not lightly, to face him. For the first time in those last couple of moments, he understood what another person was saying.\n\n**//”Move!”//**\n\nTheir legs grew into a full sprint, as they realized more people were sprinting alongside them; the simple medics and doctors, injured soldiers and patients, some holding onto each other, all heading to the nearest shelter, as Morgan’s shouting became quieter by the seconds.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n//Sprint, duck, cover, peek, shoot, peek, sprint again.
