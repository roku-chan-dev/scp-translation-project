I'm excited to see how I transform their amazing characters into art :) Keep an eye out for more illustrations of characters from their articles/tales!\n\nPlease let me know either in the discussion or PM if you'd like to see more character designs or if you have an article that you may want me to design a human or humanoid for. I also make a variety of art, but once I get a good base of humanoid designs, I'll go ahead and begin to consider drawing further out of my comfort zone. Thanks for checking out my art!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false| last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:the-pale-lady | previous-title=art: The Pale Lady\n| next-url=/ | next-title=Coming soon!\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art:agent-ramirez | hub-title=art: Agent Ramírez\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Agent-Ramirez.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user MissBirdy]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:agent-ramirez SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
