The simulspace and its userbase were fairly new at the time and many were happy to donate some processing power to aid in its construction. Each member of the system worked in harmony to datamine away ones and zeroes from the surrounding network, compiling them to build structures of incredible stature. Far above the draw distance of the average user, the avatars of several casual Maxwellists hovered around unfinished skyscrapers in concentration.\n\nAt Level Null, avatars with novel geometries and hues littered the motherboard-patterned sidewalks. The simulated vehicles on the glossy streets rarely stopped for more than a second before flying by with the smoothness and consistency of conveyor belts. A pixellated DeLorean seamlessly parked in front of a quaint, neon-blue building whose sign read \"Bits and Bytes: //Geared Up To Serve!//\" An amorphous cloud of orange pixels exited the vehicle and rose into the air before it entered the open window of a dark purple structure atop the store.\n\n[[=]]\nCORE.exe looked on in contempt, unsympathetic to their constructed haven. It could not understand.\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[=]]\nSuddenly, CORE's attention on the city was broken.

This was the ticket into the Hexagon that it had been looking for.\n[[/=]]\n----\nCORE didn't need to take any shape at all, not really. It seemed to enjoy toying with its world from behind the scenes, although no mind could truly know what, or even if, CORE felt. However, constructing a digital avatar was necessary if it were to blend in and greet this welcome party sent for it. It had to make a good impression, after all, if its plans were to be realized.\n \nBeneath the bedrock of the Compilation Layer, CORE tore at the gridlines that had held the world together. The lines twisted and snapped below the ground, straining the white layer and causing it to bulge upward. With each snap, ripples of magenta and violet radiated outward in waves across the virtual ground; hue shifting all that was in their path. Aklerep and Matt turned, staring warily at the source of the disturbance, and watched in awe at the events unfolding before them.\n\nAll at once, the lines sprung up through the ground, spraying a flurry of multicolored RGB pixels violently into the air, and contorted into a jagged forest of data. For a moment, the pixelated dust hung, suspended, above the violent thrashing of torn gridlines, deprived of their thin protective layer — and then, they found their CORE. The pixels rapidly flashed between random colours and hues with increasing frequencies while slowly moving to rotate around CORE. Gradually, they built up speed until they swirled viciously in a storm above the shattered earth. Within the chaotic, shifting colours, moments of unison in groups of pixels emulated a hauntingly quiet lightning in the clouds above. In the centre of the cyclone, CORE began to take shape.\n\nFirst, two metallic, clawed hands formed and swung wildly at the ground. They ripped and tore at the pixels beneath them, launching more and more dust into the swirling mass above. As the dust storm grew around it, so too did CORE grow — hands extended into wrists, which extended into lean, muscular arms. Yet more pixels coalesced downwards into a thin, wiry torso, its open back exposing its hollow interior. A cobalt robe unfurled from its shoulders and draped itself unevenly behind CORE's newly-formed ankles, covering the hole in its back.\n\nFinally, the severed gridlines joined the fray. The lines tore through the ground in all directions, never moving forward for more than a few moments before taking sharp turns around and parallel to each other, arranging themselves like the traces on a circuit board before shooting out of the soil and flying towards the new body. The first to reach its target frayed into thousands of tiny strands and forced its way through the hole in CORE's back, stacking and coiling on itself in a rudimentary imitation of internal organs. Another group of wires rose to the air, curling and writhing until they formed a round head with space for only one eye and a strand emerging straight down. As the head lowered onto its neck and the strand filled the gap in its spine, a final ring formed above the storm in the still air — a worthy halo for a conqueror.\n\nThe halo lowered into the raging dust and gently came to rest upon the one-eyed sphere, and the thousands of pixels that still remained airborne followed it to their master. CORE's eye lit up a noxious green, and a coil of jagged wire formed the trim of its cloak. As the dust settled, CORE turned towards Aklerep and Matt, both of whom stepped back to get a view of its sheer size above them. Standing shin-deep in its crater, CORE stood towering a full head’s height above both of them. It straightened out its newly-compiled form, tested its new fingers, and brushed a few loose pixels off of its shoulders.\n\n[[div style=\"float: left; width: 300px; text-align: right;\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 10pt;  border: #1d4d25 3px solid; background:#1cb403; font-family: \"Courier New\"; background:linear-gradient(#1fff5a, #1cb403); text-align: center; padding: 2px 10px;\"]]\n**IF YOUR SEARCH HAD THE INTENT OF FINDING ME...**\n**HERE I AM.**\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[[<image CORE.png width=\"125px\" style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"clear: left;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\nAklerep and Matt both took a few more cautious steps backwards and watched CORE warily.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: right; width: 300px; text-align: right;\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: white; font-size: 10pt; background:#2894FF; text-align: left; padding: 1px 20px;\"]]\nIdentify yourself.
