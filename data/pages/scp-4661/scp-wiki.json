The unit was designed in order to prevent another Collapse Incident. This is achieved by siphoning Tartarean Resonance Energy[[footnote]] A form of radiation naturally produced by demonic entities. Abbreviated as TRE. [[/footnote]], and using it to anchor both itself and Site-666 to the current theological plane of reality.\n\nThe Theoplanar Vacuum Unit ejects waste every day at sundown. The Unit converts the excess TRE to Alpha radiation and releases it in a narrow, concentrated beam of light. The beam has been measured at 42.3 billion candelas, and necessitates the interior of the Planar Vacuum Unit be lined with heat-absorbent plating. \n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-4661 is a region of space wherein the city of Las Vegas and the Fourth Circle of Hell (as reported in Dante Alighieri's //Inferno//) overlap. This results in the weakening of, and in certain circumstances, complete separation from baseline reality. SCP-4661 contains an extremely high density of demonic entities, and is sustained by the Tartarean Resonance Energy they produce. SCP-4661 is in constant flux, and, if uncontained, will fully collapse into the Fourth Circle.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=mgm2.JPG|\n    caption=Foundation convoy entering Las Vegas during the SCP-4661 Initial Collapse.\n]]\n\nSCP-4661-B instances are Tartarean-class demonic entities superficially resembling humans, which exhibit significant internal and limited external anatomical differences. They possess small, curved horns on their craniums and a paler complexion than most humans. They also possess limited pyrokinetic capabilities, such as manifesting sparks from their hands or igniting small objects. These abilities increase in effectiveness when exposed to individuals engaging in hedonistic activities; for example, alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling. They naturally produce significant amounts of TRE.\n\nSCP-4661 came to the Foundation's attention between January 12 to January 16 of 1992. Significant Foundation intervention was required to reestablish normalcy.\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 4661.1\n+++ {{INITIAL REPORT — DAY 1}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ UNEXPLAINED EVENT REPORT\n[[/=]]\n[[include component:image-block name=red.png|\n    caption=Image captured by Agent Daniels mid-event.\n]]\n----\n**__LOCATION:__** Paradise/Las Vegas, Nevada\n\n**__STATUS:__** Ongoing\n\n**__TIME:__** 11:49 PM (local time) January 12 -- Present\n\n**__DISRUPTION CLASS:__** Keneq\n\n----\n**__EVENT SUMMARY:__** Spike in TRE levels of area accompanied by significant drop in Hume level.

You've been picked to make sure what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\n\nYou will be dealing with demons, both literal and metaphorical. You will be firing bullets blessed in factories, bathing in mass-produced holy water, and researching things that the Vatican would rather you not know.\n\nVegas is called Sin City for a reason. We are in their home, but that doesn't mean we have to bow to them.\n\nWith all that in mind, there's really only one rule in Undervegas: the House always wins.\n\n----\n\n//**Director House.**//\n//Secure, Contain, Protect//\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4660]]] | SCP-4661 | [[[SCP-4662]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** construction.jpg\n> **Name:** Lexor.jpg\n> **Author:** Tim Emerich\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=80346 Public Domain Puctures]\n\n> **Filename:** helicopter.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-4661 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** 180709-M-ZZ999-0002.JPG\n> **Author:** Sgt.
