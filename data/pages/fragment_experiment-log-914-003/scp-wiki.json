A book titled //They Led Us to Midnight: The Last Presidents of America//, authored by Doris Goodwin, dated 2015. This book mentions the last presidents of the United States as Richard Nixon (1969-1977, 37th), Jerry Brown (1977-1981, 38th), Ronald Reagan (1981-1985, 39th), Mary Talish (1985-1989, 40th), and Donald Rumsfeld (1989-1993, 41st). The 25 years were marred with controversy, and culminated with a nuclear war with the Soviet Union under Gennady Yanayev (General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1985-1993) after a nuclear false alarm on November 22, 1993. It was stated that a system malfunction in the [[[scp-1984 | Dead Hand / Perimeter nuclear weapons control system]]] misinterpreted a background signal as 6 Minuteman ICBMs heading for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, thus causing the nuclear war.\n2. An autobiography titled //Murder, They Wrote// by Mary Talish, dated 1992. It details her ritual murder and subsequent resurrection in 1952, her senatorial career from 1967 to 1977, her vice presidency from 1977 to 1981, and her presidency from 1985 to 1989. A foreword, written by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, suggested that American-Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly after Talish's presidency ended.\n3. A book titled //United Counties of Indiana: The Founding of a Nation// by Former Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, dated 2015. It detailed the first twenty years of Indiana and Illinois after the Nuclear War of 1993. Of note was the appearance of Site-81 Director Oliver J. Rights as President of Indiana from 2007 to 2011.\n4. An autobiography titled //Our Struggle: Memories of Athens// by Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Imperial Union of Greece, [[[scp-1173 | Samothrace]]], Cyprus and Turkey (Greek: Η Αυτοκρατορική Ένωση της Ελλάδας, η Σαμοθράκη, η Κύπρος και η Τουρκία), dated 2020. It detailed his life from after the nuclear war, being one of the few who witnessed a nuclear bomb hitting Athens without exploding. The current monarch is Paul II (Pavlos II), following Constantine II's abdication in 1996 in exchange for the restoration of the Greek Monarchy.\nIn books 1 and 4, a world map is seen. One could infer that continental Eurasia, the British Isles, the former Soviet Union, and North America is heavily devastated. All four placed into secure storage pending further review.\n//Note: So it turns out that Mary Talish could have done much more in her life.

The chambers are lined on all interior surfaces with biocompatibale plastic. Attached to the exterior of the box is a handle, which is attached to a crank. The crank moves fluid through the box for as long as manual force is applied to it.\n\n**Input:** 1 TAH\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two ventricular assist devices, one intended for placement in the right side of the heart; the other intended for placement in the left side of the heart.\n\n//Note: The output machines each take the function of the heart's pumping action. The one intended for the right side of the heart isn't used much in practice due to high risk of complications, which is why the TAH was created. Essentially, 1 artificial heart = two [[$ \\frac{1}{2} $]] artificial hearts.//\n\n**Input:** 1 TAH\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Nothing is initially observed in the output chamber. Closer inspection of the surfaces shows a thin accumulation of dust that was not present previously. The dust is later revealed to be millions of individual nanoparticulate mechanisms. Chemical analysis of the immediate environment as well as shavings of the output chamber's interior reveal a significant increase in oxygen and extrinsic nutrients.\n\n//Note: The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The nanoparticles apparently achieve this via controlled diffusion, without the need for an organ or delivery system.//\n\n**Input:** 1 TAH\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Native materials of the TAH have been rearranged to resemble several fruits and vegetables (inedible).
