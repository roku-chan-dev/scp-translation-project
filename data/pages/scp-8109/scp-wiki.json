Originally developed as an improved refrigerant for military equipment following the Montreal Protocols' ban on chlorofluorocarbons enacted in 1989, SCP-8109's unusual antientropic properties prompted further research into development as an area denial weapon <<footnote 3>>. Due to the anti-entropic catalyst only activating in the presence of saline water, and its tendency to form a self-sealing ice water shell, this usage case proved less than optimal.}}\n\n{{Research then focused on possible use as a delayed-action assassination/population reduction weapon. By encapsulating the anti-entropic catalyst in an artemicite nano-lattice, the catalyst could be introduced into an enemy's water or food supply, spreading throughout the population and being taken up into the subject's body, where it would linger until exposed to the activating thaumic energy. This would allow for the slow spreading of the weapon throughout an enemy populace followed by a sudden activation, resulting in the rapid termination of multiple enemies at once.}}\n\n{{Initial tests indicated that the SCP-8109 eigenweapon (Project Belphegor) could be an effective assassination weapon, but was hampered by its openly anomalous effects, which would have made its deployment incompatible with the Veil Protocol. Research into controlled dosage delivery mechanisms continued until the shuttering of Project Olympus following the Foundation's falling-out with the Bowe Commission in the winter of 2002.
