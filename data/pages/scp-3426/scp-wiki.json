As such, scientific progress into a unified physics hypothesis[[footnote]]Colloquially termed \"theories of everything,\" such as string theory or loop quantum gravity.[[/footnote]] and the creation of infinitely sustainable energy should be heavily impeded. Other areas of social and technological progress that could potentially result in an occurrence of SCP-3426 on Earth must be prevented by any reasonable means currently available. Additional measures may be taken in the event that the collective human race approaches attainment of Type I civilization status (as defined on the Kardeshev scale)[[footnote]]Defined as being able to store and use all energy that reaches the planet from the parent star.[[/footnote]].\n\nInvestigation of phenomena related to SCP-3426 will take place under Operation GREY VOICES. Mechanical probe surveys to a maximum range of 100 light years will attempt to ascertain the commonality and range of SCP-3426, and manned excursions to post-3426 planets are currently in the planning process. Operation GREY VOICES will centralize the relevant collected data, and collaborate with other Foundation internal research divisions, including the Memetics and Infohazards Division, Temporal Anomalies Department, Thaumatological Department, and Biological Containment and Research Division, for the purpose of attaining a greater understanding of SCP-3426.\n\nCivilian surveys of exoplanets and cosmological imaging projects will be strictly monitored for images or data that show evidence of SCP-3426. Upon discovery, data of SCP-3426 is to be erased or edited as necessary, and amnestics administered to persons involved.\n\n**Description:**  SCP-3426 is a phenomenon that is responsible for the total extinction of a technologically and socially advanced planetary civilization. SCP-3426 may be an event, entity, process, object, or concept; to date there exists no definitive hypothesis on the attributes of the anomaly. However, it is known that the conditions for the manifestation of SCP-3426 are self-consistent and follow an established pattern. It is believed that SCP-3426 manifestation is widespread and possibly universal.\n\nA planet that has been affected by SCP-3426 is termed \"post-3426.\" Post-3426 planets and civilizations share a number of common characteristics.\n* The civilization must have achieved a relative degree of global sociopolitical stability[[footnote]]By \"relative,\" it is meant that - as a whole - widespread changes in the world order, upheavals in social norms, and non-localized political unrest are essentially eradicated.[[/footnote]].\n* A limitless or indefinitely sustainable source of worldwide energy is in use (e.g. nuclear fusion, hydrogen mining, orbital solar collection, or enhanced geothermal systems).\n* This energy must be widespread and plentiful enough for the civilization to qualify as a Type I civilization or higher on the Kardeshev scale.\n* A unified scientific theory/model of the universe must have been developed.\n* Space travel is commonplace, and is advanced enough to allow for detailed exploration of the local solar system.\n* There exists an organization whose purpose is to catalogue and contain as many anomalous phenomena as possible.\n\nPost-3426 planets display widespread anomalous material corrosion, reality distortion, complete or near-complete corruption of information and information media, and the pervasive presence of visual cognitohazards and abnormalities. Sapient lifeforms on a post-3426 planet appear in two stages based on time since SCP-3426 took place. If it has been 1 year or less since the occurrence of SCP-3426, such organisms appear suspended or frozen in place, lack any consciousness, and display total cell death. In some cases, they may appear translucent or blurred to cameras and to the eye. Afterwards, intelligent life is apparently completely spatially erased; while possessions, information, and structures created as a result of the species remain present, if highly deviated, no physical remains of the species itself exist.\n\nData, items, and artifacts were collected primarily through the mass usage of drones, orbital probes, and imaging sensors deployed onto post-3426 planets. Further information on the exact properties or effects of SCP-3426 has been difficult to recover. Probes that enter the atmosphere of a post-3426 planet quickly deteriorate within 24 hours, becoming affected by the spacetime distortion and material corrosion permeating the planet's surface and surroundings. As a result, recovered data on post-3426 planets is extremely limited.\n\nBased on data and related analysis from Operation GREY VOICES, it is believed that SCP-3426 induces a slow collapse of the consistency of universal constants and stable states within the planet. This collapse weakens force interactions between elementary particles, creates extreme planetwide ontokinetic and material distortion effects, and gradually prevents any information or conscious thought from being distributed. This process culminates in all matter on the planet reaching a state of catastrophic incoherence, theoretically resulting in the slow erasure of objects, concepts, and lifeforms originating from it. This phenomenon has been provisionally classed as a ZK-λ-Class Cosmic Fragmentation Scenario.\n\nWhile research into SCP-3426 has yielded a vast variety of information regarding its nature and end results, the mechanism by which SCP-3426 acts remains unknown.\n\n\n**Addendum 3426.1:** Incomplete List of Post-3426 Planets\n\nAt present, Operation GREY VOICES has examined all exoplanets within a 75-light year radius of Earth. From this current exploration area, 16 planets have met the hypothesized conditions required for the occurrence of SCP-3426. All 16 were affected by SCP-3426 either upon discovery or within 5 years of detection.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access File\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\nA partial list of post-3426 exoplanets and their characteristics is shown below.\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 700px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nGliese 1214b (Post-3426-2)\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nTraits\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nOcean planet, hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Dominant lifeforms were aquatic non-humanoids with primary settlements underneath the ocean. Technologically advanced society organized into strict unified social hierarchies. Outposts existed both in the atmosphere and in space, used for the purpose of research into the local star system. The civilization had no clear leader of governmental system; rather, computers dispensed resources distributed according to caste.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nPost-3426 Characteristics\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nAfter SCP-3426, post-3426-2 had approximately half of its water transmuted to deuterium and tritium oxide. Consciousness in all sapient lifeforms spontaneously stopped. Computers and other data storage devices underwent apparent global information corruption, with only 15% of the civilization's information remaining readable. Water molecules no longer \"flow\"; the substance acts as a single, rigid, continuous solid.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nNone\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 700px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nKepler-443b (Post-3426-5)\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nTraits\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nThick atmosphere, strong gravitational field, and cold average temperatures. Dominant lifeforms had mammalian characteristics such as body hair and live birth, but possessed ectothermic circulation in the same fashion as reptiles. Dominant religion involved the worship of an entity ascribed to the planet's star, which was said to be responsible for continually rebuilding and moving the universe.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nPost-3426 Characteristics\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nPost-3426-5 experienced a form of catastrophic reality degradation in which the formation of chemical compounds became impossible due to weakening of the electrostatic force. An additional anomalous effect causes all native living organisms to be perceived as a two-dimensional shimmering, gray film. This effect is both present in photographs and video from the planet and physical artifacts collected from it.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nNone\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 700px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nLuyten b (Post-3426-10)\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nTraits\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nRocky planet with Earth-like composition, orbiting a red dwarf. Mild (292 K) temperatures and nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Dominant intelligent life was humanoid. The planet had recently survived the effects of a catastrophic nuclear war which subsequently led to a current period of utopian peace and social stability. Primary energy source was obtained through large-scale drilling into the planet's mantle.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nPost-3426 Characteristics\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nAll events taking place on post-3426-10 occur in apparent disjointed slow motion. Movement, interaction, and even thought are anomalously decelerated; this deceleration is inconsistent among the surface, with some regions being \"slower\" than others. This effect can also manifest as a complete and total stopping of time, with all particle movement in an affected region ceasing. Analysis of the mantle of the planet revealed that it had been transformed to a perfectly smooth, transparent layer of pink glass. Interaction with this glass results in malfunction of any nearby electrically-powered devices and an intense feeling of vertigo.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nThe dominant lifeforms inhabiting post-3426-10 appear to communicate in an undocumented Indo-European language with significant similarities to Hittite[[footnote]]An extinct language spoken by the Hittite empire of the 16th-13th centuries BCE.[[/footnote]].

Similarly to Earth, planetary society consisted of a multitude of separated geopolitical states coexisting in a roughly capitalist system. Analogue of the SCP Foundation, notably, was a peacekeeping organization that traded anomalies and used them strategically to prevent wars, research medical and scientific advances, or expose social and economic injustices.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nPost-3426 Characteristics\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nExtreme spatial distortion. Entire regions are \"displaced\" from the rest of the surface, while a low static blur is visible across most of the planet. It is unknown whether this is a visual or an ontokinetic effect. On occasion, a sudden tear in the spacetime continuum within the planet's atmosphere is detected, followed by the appearance of black mist. This mist will usually move towards an unconscious sentient lifeform or data storage device and enter it. Once this has been completed, it becomes impossible for any being to comprehend any concepts related to or contained in the affected object. This has made data gathering from post-3426-13 extremely difficult.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\" class=\"left-table\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\" class=\"right-table\"]]\nAll containment sites operated by post-3426-13's SCP Foundation analogue have been replaced by large spheres of total darkness.

This plant was common across post-3426-5’s ground and was pollinated by many native fauna on post-3426-5.\n> \n> Within the first fifteen minutes of viewing, the object is perceived by all intelligent life as a plant-shaped mass of static. This static appears two-dimensional from all sides despite existing in a three-dimensional space. Extended observation of the static tends to cause discomfort in all observers. After fifteen minutes have passed, the plant is no longer able to be perceived by the observer. The observer’s memories of the plant are immediately retained, but physical viewing of the plant’s location presents itself as if the object itself was not present. Testers could describe an unknown object perfectly even if it was presumably obscured by the plant.\n> \n> This effect changes after an additional two to three days have passed.
