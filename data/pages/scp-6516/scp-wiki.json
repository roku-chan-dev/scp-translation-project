The ruined building does not exist on any plan of the area and is assumed to be an apparition.\n]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6516\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6516 is closed to the public and no access is permitted except with the permission of the Director of Site-44. The Foundation has purchased the Harbrook Estate from the National Trust under the guise of a private heritage fund, and has announced through a front agency that SCP-6516 is to be treated as an experimental human-free nature reserve. Foundation liaison with the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is ongoing and cordial, allowing a number of useful exceptions to be written into existing environmental and heritage law.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=pyzdryforestbell.jpg\n| caption=SCP-6516-A, with the cord used to ring it from ground level visible in the foreground.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6516 is All Hallows Wood, a wooded area of approximately 425 ha (4.25 km^^2^^) in the estate of Harbrook House, an eighteenth-century stately home in north-western Lincolnshire, England. The site has been preserved from logging since before the Norman Conquest; after the Conquest, it passed between several families before finally being acquired and entailed by the Harbrook viscountcy in the late sixteenth century. The last Viscount Harbrook sold the property to the National Trust in 1965.\n\nSCP-6516 is, in most respects, typical of wooded areas in Northern England. Its anomalous properties become clear only when visitors arrive.\n\nVisitors to SCP-6516 typically lose their way for several hours, up to an entire day from sunrise to sunset, until they encounter SCP-6516-A (see below). On the way, visitors experience shifts in topography and geography that cause the layout of SCP-6516 to radically diverge from satellite imaging and mapping of the area.\n\nIn addition, visitors to SCP-6516 will repeatedly encounter apparitions of people known to them who have died, as well as buildings they recognise and other images from their past. Human apparitions are mute and non-hostile, and are typically perceived by those who encounter them as warm and friendly. They will typically not approach the visitor closely, but in most cases will watch from further into the wood, demanifesting upon a close approach.\n\nSCP-6516 is also known to increase the strength and tangibility of unrelated hauntings and spectral apparitions that happen to enter SCP-6516. Cross-testing with other SCP objects is currently not permitted by the Department of Spectral Phenomena, but cross-testing with mundane and unclassified spectral activity is an active avenue of research.\n\nThe visitor will continue to experience apparitions until they encounter an aged bell housed in a brick tower ten metres in height (collectively designated SCP-6516-A). Upon ringing SCP-6516-A, all spectral activity in the area will cease, and the visitor will immediately become aware of an easy way out to the edge of the wood, even if no such exit route was visible before. Although visitors to SCP-6516 cannot find their way out of SCP-6516 on their own, repeated testing has determined that they will inevitably encounter SCP-6516-A before any harm is likely to come to them from exposure.\n\nOnce a visitor has rung SCP-6516-A, they will never experience the anomalous effects of SCP-6516 again.\n\n**Exploration 6516-Foxtrot:** The most recent exploration of SCP-6516 was undertaken by Site-44 Senior Field Agent Penelope Ash at her request, on Friday 10 June 2022. An exploration log is attached below.\n\nA full log of all Foundation testing and exploration of SCP-6516 is available on request.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The following is an audio transcript of Senior Agent Ash's exploration of SCP-6516 on Friday 9 September 2022, gathered from a high-quality microphone in her lapel.//\n\n//Throughout her expedition into SCP-6516, Agent Ash was accompanied by Agent Stephen Browning, another agent at Site-44.

Yes.\n \n//They are quiet for some time while they reach the main road out of Southend.//\n\n**Agent Browning:** Are you OK, sweetheart? You're a bit quiet.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yeah, I'm fine.

I always got us there on time.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Mostly in one piece.\n \n//Agent Ash begins to laugh, but stops herself suddenly and clears her throat.//\n\n**Agent Ash:** Well.\n \n//The engine stops.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** All Hallows Wood.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Looks like it.\n \n**Agent Browning:** It doesn't look very haunted, does it?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Not really, no.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Reminds me of the New Forest. Remember?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Actually, yeah.\n \n//There is a pause.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** Shall we?\n \n**Agent Ash:** You go first, I want to check the mic. Wait for me over by the gate.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Alright.\n\n//There is a small sound on the recording; Agent Ash later clarified that Agent Browning had leaned over and kissed her on the cheek.//\n\n//The car door opens and Agent Browning can be heard stepping onto the gravel outside the car.

I know I said already, but it's perfect.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Isn't it?\n \n**Agent Browning:** The air is so fresh. I feel...energetic.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Good!\n \n**Agent Browning:** Anyway — remind me again what 44 wants out of our little walk.\n \n**Agent Ash:** It's just an exploration mission. Check for consistency with other results. I think they're just going down the list of field agents, because you can't do it twice. Take some photographs. Record sounds.\n \n//A gentle thumping sound is audible on the recording, presumably from Agent Ash tapping her mic.//\n \n \n**Agent Ash:** Then report back.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Righto. Sally went recently, didn't she?[[footnote]]Agent Sally Guest, a colleague and friend of Agents Ash and Browning, also attached to Site-44. Agent Guest conducted the 6516-Echo expedition in February 2022.[[/footnote]]\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yeah, earlier this year.\n \n**Agent Browning:** What did she see? I've read the report, but...\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yeah. She didn't really say. I thought it better not to pry and the report has the information we need. She seemed alright about it though. Calm. It made her smile to think about it, I think.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Mmm.\n \n//There is a brief pause on the recording.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** Well, ready when you are.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Alright.\n \n//The sound of a gate squeaking open is audible, as are two sets of footsteps on the pathway. Neither agent speaks for several minutes. Birdsong continues and becomes slightly louder.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** Twelve-oh-nine. You reread the file on the way up, didn't you? Remind me what it said about when it's supposed to...begin.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Varies, apparently. For some the anomaly kicks in almost immediately; other people have had to wander around for hours before they see anything. There are pre-containment reports of people going through All Hallows Wood and not seeing anything unusual, but either they're very unobservant or...\n \n**Agent Ash:** ...they haven't lost anyone, right.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Yeah.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Lucky them.\n \n//Both agents lapse into silence for around eight minutes.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** Wait.\n \n**Agent Browning:** What's up?\n \n**Agent Ash:** That stump over there, look.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Yeah?\n \n**Agent Ash:** We walked past it earlier.\n \n**Agent Browning:** But that's impossible. We've not left the path.\n \n**Agent Ash:** It must be kicking in about now. Hold on.\n \n//There is a rustling sound as Agent Ash retrieves her smartphone from her pocket.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** GPS is scrambled, it can't get a lock, look.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Just bouncing around. God, that's weird.\n \n**Agent Ash:** I didn't even notice.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Nor me. I wonder when it kicked in. The files say it tends to happen when you aren't paying attention.\n \n**Agent Ash:** No way to know.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I was just listening to the birds.\n \n//They laugh.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** //[forcefully]// God, I've missed this.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Field work?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Field work with you.\n \n**Agent Browning:** It's been a while. How long?\n \n**Agent Ash:** //[quietly]// A long time.\n\n//A quiet rustling sound can be heard.

Look!\n \n**Agent Browning:** What? There? I don't—\n \n**Agent Ash:** Ah, too late. I saw someone. They're gone now.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Who?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Not sure. An old lady. Too far away to be sure.\n \n**Agent Browning:** ...mine or yours, do you think?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Mine. I'm pretty sure.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Why?\n \n**Agent Ash:** I could be wrong, but I think it was...Mrs Dixon?[[footnote]]Identified as Mrs Kathleen Dixon of Weston-super-Mare; died of a stroke in 2003.[[/footnote]]\n \n**Agent Browning:** Who's Mrs Dixon?\n \n**Agent Ash:** My old Year Three teacher.[[footnote]]The equivalent of the US second grade.[[/footnote]] She died a year or two after I left primary school, I remember hearing about it over Christmas.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Your teacher? I wonder why her?\n \n**Agent Ash:** God knows.\n \n**Agent Browning:** People have reported rather unexpected apparitions. It's not always people you were close to.\n \n**Agent Ash:** I certainly wasn't expecting to see her again.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Did you like her?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Not...particularly, no. I mean, she was fine. I don't remember much about it. She was very pernickety about handwriting. I remember one day she told us off about our Zs. But she smiled a lot.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I see.\n \n//They walk on, in silence.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** What's that?\n \n**Agent Ash:** That building?\n \n**Agent Browning:** Yes.

Liz's mother?[[footnote]]\"Liz\" is Elizabeth Ash, Agent Ash's mother.[[/footnote]]\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yes.\n \n**Agent Browning:** The fire...[[footnote]]Following her death from cancer in 2011, Ginevra White's former house burned down in an unexpected and catastrophic fire the following year, thought to have been set by squatters or local adolescents.[[/footnote]]\n \n**Agent Ash:** God, that was ages ago. But it looks like new. Look, the roses over the door. She was so proud of those. I pricked myself on the thorns once when I visited her, and she was so gentle with me.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Pen, look. Upstairs.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Oh, Gran...\n \n**Agent Browning:** Is she...\n \n//Agent Ash later reported that the apparition of Mrs White waved at them from her upstairs window. Agent Ash can be heard clearing her throat on the recording.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** She looks just like she does in that photo on the mantelpiece, when you were a kid.

But it's something to think about. And this place doesn't seem to make sense. It's almost too kind.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Too kind?\n \n**Agent Browning:** It just lets people see the ones they've lost again. Everyone wants that. It's like wish-fulfilment.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Maybe sometimes you'll see people you don't want to see again.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Not according to the records.

It was near the Borders. You...they said it was a blind corner. There was a truck, a tanker. You never had a chance.\n \n**Agent Browning:** ...what?\n \n**Agent Ash:** You don't remember. Ever since it happened, you've appeared to me in the passenger seat of my car, every single day, and you don't remember. Time doesn't seem to work the same way for you any more.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Something... //[he pauses for a moment]// I remember noise, and headlights...\n \n**Agent Ash:** They said you didn't suffer, love.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I...Pen, I'm...\n \n**Agent Ash:** It's alright. I've had you for six months longer. I've taken drives with you, just to feel your hand on mine in the car. But you've never been able to get //out// of my car. You're stuck somehow.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Stuck...but here...\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yeah. You could walk with me again. One last time.\n \n**Agent Browning:** The bell. I understand.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yes. The bell should unstick you, they said. I...I can't do it any more. I can't live like this, every day, stuck. It's not right. You can't stay any longer. The bell can let you move on, they think.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Pen, I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me?\n \n**Agent Ash:** I didn't want to. And I didn't think you'd remember anyway. You don't remember things well now. Today you remember better.\n \n**Agent Browning:** It's the wood. It's making things clearer.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Yes.\n \n//A short pause.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** What's he pointing at?\n \n**Agent Ash:** Look. There.\n \n//Agent Ash reported that SCP-6516-A came into view at this point, within a clearing. At this point, the apparition of her father turned around, stepped close to them and shook Agent Browning's hand, before waving goodbye to her and demanifesting.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** Bye, Dad. See you.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I can touch him.\n \n**Agent Ash:** You're closer to him than I am now.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Closer. Yes.\n \n//Footsteps are audible on the recording as they approach the belltower.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** The sun's going down. It won't be light for much longer.\n \n**Agent Ash:** No.\n \n**Agent Browning:** It's...it's time to go, isn't it?\n \n**Agent Ash:** I don't want you to. I've missed you so much. In the car I've had your shadow, but today I've had you again.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I have to, though. Now we're here I can feel it. Like gravity. Oh, Pen. I'm sorry.\n \n**Agent Ash:** It's OK. Really. I've wept for you long enough now. We had everything in our eight years. But I wanted to grow old with you. I wanted...\n \n**Agent Browning:** I know, sweetheart. It just wasn't to be. These things happen.\n \n//There is a pause. Agent Ash reports that at this point she was gripping the cord of SCP-6516-A.//\n \n**Agent Ash:** I can't do it. I can't. I can't send you away. Can you do it?\n \n**Agent Browning:** I can't. I don't know why. It just...it has to be you. I know it somehow. I'm sorry.\n \n**Agent Ash:** I love you.\n \n**Agent Browning:** I love you too. So much. Please, never forget it.\n \n**Agent Ash:** I won't. I'm coming after you too, one day. There's somewhere to go, I know that now.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Yes. Somewhere deeper in the wood.\n \n//There is a pause.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** Pen. It's time, sweetheart.\n \n//She takes a deep, shuddering breath. Moments later, the bell rings, a bright, full, echoing peal. Agent Ash begins to cry softly. A rustling sound is heard on the recording as they embrace.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** It's starting. I feel...lighter.\n \n**Agent Ash:** And look, I can see the way out now. There's the gate.\n \n//There is a brief pause.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** I think I've worked out what it is.\n \n**Agent Ash:** The wood?\n \n**Agent Browning:** Yeah. It's something like a departure lounge. A concourse. A train platform. Somewhere to say your goodbyes.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Mmm. Maybe you're right.\n \n**Agent Browning:** C'mere. Give me your hand. I'll walk you to the edge.\n \n//Two sets of footsteps are audible on the path again.//\n \n**Agent Browning:** It's been a perfect day.\n \n**Agent Ash:** Thank you.\n \n**Agent Browning:** Travel safe, sweetheart.\n \n**Agent Ash:** You too.\n \n//Gradually, the two sets of footsteps fade to one as Agent Ash approaches the gate out of the wood.//\n\n**Agent Ash:** You too.\n @@ @@\n \n------\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Footnotes\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n\n-----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6515]]] | SCP-6516 | [[[SCP-6517]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]\n]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** firsttimebuyermed.jpg\n> **Name:** First Time Buyer\n> **Author:** Ian Livesey\n> **License:** Public domain\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/ianlivesey/42379839661/\n=====\n> **Filename:** pyzdryforestbell.jpg\n> **Name:** MOs810 WG 55 2016 Pyzdry Forest III (Saint Stanislaus Kostka church in Brudzew, bell tower) (2)\n> **Author:** MOs810 (Wikimedia Commons user)\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA-4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOs810_WG_55_2016_Pyzdry_Forest_III_(Saint_Stanislaus_Kostka_church_in_Brudzew,_bell_tower)_(2).jpg [link]]\n=====\n> Infobox quote from Taylor Swift, 'Ivy', from //Evermore// (2020, Republic Records).\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
