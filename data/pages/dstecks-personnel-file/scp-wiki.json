  "content": "**Name:** Dr. D█████ Stoeckle, codename \"DStecks\"\n//**Note from O5-█:** Are you serious? His codename is// DStecks//? Does he think he's a [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] rapper? Let me have a look at this file. Looks like it needs some corrections.//\n**Position:** Field research, Item acquisition.\n**Security Clearance:** Level 2\n**History:** A recent hire by the Foundation, Dr. Stoeckle graduated near the top of his class at MIT, but soon found himself confronted by his --antisocial tendencies-- enormous jackassery. While he worked for a time at the Smithsonian Institution, he was quickly fired. --The Smithsonian's personnel records-- Common sense shows that they ultimately decided that his talent was not worth his --inability to work as part of a team-- ego. As a result of his actions, the Smithsonian blacklisted him. He has had similar experiences with every other employer he has worked for, including DARPA, NASA, Microsoft, [DATA EXPUNGED], and Burger King. Thus, only the Foundation will employ him, and as such, he receives --10-- 50% less pay than a normal doctor of his rank.\n\n--Dr. Stoeckle must not, under any circumstances, be assigned to a Mobile Task Force for any reason.-- Rescinded as per approval of P3-EAVESDROP.  \n\n**Dr. Stoeckle was either responsible for the recovery or primary study of the following SCP items:**\n\n[[[SCP-503]]]: The Luckiest Man in the World\n[[[SCP-656]]]: Home Edition\n[[[SCP-659]]]: Communal Avian Intelligence\n[[[SCP-431]]]: Dr. Gideon\n[[[SCP-620]]]: Time Keeps on Slipping\n--SCP-086: Top Secret, Eyes Only--\n[[[SCP-816]]]: Darwin's Erector Set\n--SCP-601: Enlightenment--\n[[[SCP-782]]]: All-New You\n--SCP-1055: The Think Tank--\n--SCP-3161: P3-EAVESDROP--\n\n**Dr. Stoeckle has contributed to the study of the following SCP items:**\n--SCP-242: The False Peacemaker--\n\n**Dr. Stoeckle was responsible for documentation of the following events:**\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n\n[http://scpsandboxwiki.wikidot.com/dstecks Dr. Stoeckle's personal workspace]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
