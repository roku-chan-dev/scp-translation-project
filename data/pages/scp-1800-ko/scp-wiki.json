From what I've explored, the usual communication with the JP branch, with which we often interact, has been cut off, and the IT branch has gone completely silent. Whether they're dead or alive, we can't know unless we board a plane and go there.\n\nI've seen SCPs like this before.

It was during meetings with representatives from various regional commands that I used to feel that sense of unease. Every time I tried to feel that unease, something changed little by little. It was as if a disaster that had clearly occurred in one country would neatly disappear, or an entire regional command would vanish. People reacted to such events as if they were nothing. I, too, tried hard to ignore it; perhaps everyone present was making an effort to ignore it as well.\n\nI talked about this with the Spanish Regional Command Administrator in private. He tried to reassure me, saying it was probably just a matter of mood, but there was still a sense of discomfort in my heart. And then, he disappeared.

SCP-1800-KO is understood to be the gradual collapse and disappearance of the anomalous world they built. The confusion arising from the experience affects the subject negatively, leading to loss of self-identity and depression. Fortunately, amnesties are effective in treating such symptoms. Thus, administration can be done when needed.\n\nThe subjects have great knowledge of the SCP Foundation, its administration, anomalies, and various standard response protocols. The anomalies they claim to exist, which count up to around 800, have their respective appropriate standard containment procedures, which could be useful for the improvement of existing Foundation standard containment procedures.\n\nAs per the decision of the Foundation Overwatch, the subjects are designated as SCP instances. This is the second anomalous instance discovered in the Republic of Korea and is pending official SCiPNET listing. How they have manifested, or how to exploit them, is under research. Several more people with similar qualities have been confirmed to be in Korea. Methods to safely secure them are under development.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n> = [[size 110%]]**Interview Log**[[/size]]\n> \n> **Location:** Suncheon Temporary Base-173\n> **Interviewer:** Korean Anomalies Department Head  Seonwu Anan\n> **Interviewee:** Kang Yoonsang\n> ----\n> **<Start of Log-4>**\n> \n> //Kang Yoonsang stares at the interviewer, frowning.//\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I'm sorry I'm late.
