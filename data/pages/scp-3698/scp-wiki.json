Airlocks on windows, doors, and vent systems of Wing 6 are to be inspected twice daily to ensure structural integrity. No expeditions into Wing 6 for sampling are to be conducted without written approval from the O5 Council.\n\nAll identified instances of SCP-3698-1 have been quarantined into one of two zones near Mount ███████ and Mount █████, designated Zones 3698-A and 3698-C, respectively. These areas are off-limits to the public, park rangers, and all local law enforcement. The perimeters around these Zones consist of two barriers designed to prevent intrusion:\n\n* One inner barrier constructed of rebar-enforced 3m by 3m bulletproof glass panes. The top of the barrier is lined with electric wiring and cameras every two meters. Each camera has an infrared and low-light setting that can be manually activated from Site 101. The cameras rotate fully once every minute and the rotation is desynchronious to reduce blind spots both exterior to and inside the perimeter.\n\n* One external barrier constructed of chain-link fence with twice the perimeter of the inner barrier. This exterior barrier is designed to deter civilian entry. The fence itself has been treated with trace doses of anterograde episodic amnestics. In addition, the fence contains a Bachelly-Wurmann SAM[[footnote]]Subconscious Aversion Memetic: A nonviolent deterrence method approved for use on civilians. Often abbreviated \"SAM\". Come in three distinct forms: visual, auditory, and textile, the first being the most common.[[/footnote]] placed every four meters at human eye-level. All staff approaching the barrier for reconniasance or maintainence should be equipped with head-mounted displays designed to filter out cognitohazardous visual stimuli[[footnote]]For examples of use in the field, see document SCP-1730, Addendum 1730.3, Exploration Log 7.[[/footnote]].\n\nShould any instances of SCP-3698-1 be discovered outside 3698-A or 3698-C, they must be destroyed as soon as possible via controlled incineration to minimize damage to surrounding vegetation. Local conservation groups are to be informed that these incinerations are efforts to control the spread of invasive species. All staff assigned to duty within 1km of the Zones must be outfitted in pressure-sealed suits capable of withstanding off-road environments.\n\nZone 3698-B, located just outside of ███████, WA, is to be kept enclosed in barriers similar to those of 3698-A and 3698-C with one exception. The inner barrier is to be lined with small flamethrowers. If any life is detected within Zone 3698-B, nearby flamethrowers are to activate immediately and incinerate it.\n\n--All collected SCP-3698 samples are to be enclosed in triple-strength 100ml glass vials developed by Site 101 Researcher █████████ Dufour. The lids are vacuum-sealed, and can be opened either remotely or via two switches on the side of the lid, which must be activated simultaneously to release the lid. Vials are to be filled and sealed remotely via X5-Gatherer Drones at Zones 3698-A and 3698-C.-- As of 24 May ████, no more samples of SCP-3698 are to be collected under any circumstances.\n\nSCP-3698-2 is to be stored in a 4m by 3m by 4m pressurized humanoid containment cell in Site 101's Wing 3, furnished with a bed, desk, and desk chair. No personnel are allowed to converse or interact with SCP-3698-2 without written approval from the O5 Council. SCP-3698-2 is to be fed three meals a day through a 0.5m by 0.5m airlocked door on the cell's north wall. One coniferous tree sapling must be in SCP-3698-2's cell at all times. If the tree shows signs of aging or decay, it must be promptly removed and replaced with a healthy sapling by MTF Chi-5 \"Connoisseurs\" agents. This replacement must be conducted while SCP-3698-2 is asleep. Any personnel entering SCP-3698-2's cell must be outfitted in pressure-sealed uniforms.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3698 is an olfactory cognitohazard produced by a currently unidentified number of //Pseudotsuga menziesii// (Douglas fir trees) in the Cascade Mountain range, designated SCP-3698-1. While undetectable through all forms of chemical analysis, SCP-3698 and SCP-3698-1 are visible using Kant counters. Regular Douglas fir trees have an average hume reading of 106.0[[footnote]]It is currently unknown why Douglas firs have slightly above-average hume levels.[[/footnote]], whereas SCP-3698-1 exhibit readings of 107.4. Air contaminated with SCP-3698 shares this hume level.\n\nSCP-3698's effects depend on its concentration in the air, which increases with proximity to SCP-3698 specimens.\n\n* >40m (Imperceptible): Scent is imperceptible at this distance from SCP-3698-1 instances.\n\n* 10-40m (Perceptible): At this distance, SCP-3698 becomes perceptible to humans with normal olfactory abilities. Exposed individuals describe the scent as \"pleasant\", and \"crisp\". 89% of test subjects vocally liken it to \"fresh pine\".\n\n* 10-4.5m (Anomalous): At this distance, individuals begin to develop anomalous symptoms. These include:\n * Obsession with plants. Exposed individuals will request to have plants - usually, but not exclusively, coniferous saplings - placed in their quarters for up to a week after exposure.\n * Elevated body temperature until room temperature is dropped to 10.6^^o^^C.\n * Persistent feelings of nostalgia, particularly [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]\n\n* 4.5-2m (Potent):Anomalous symptoms will continue to worsen, becoming increasingly persistent and intrusive.\n * Obsession with coniferous plants. Exposed individuals will request to have coniferous saplings placed in their quarters for up to 13 days after exposure.\n * Elevated body temperature until room temperature is dropped to 8.6^^o^^C.\n * Persistent feelings of nostalgia, particularly [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]\n * Interrogative compulsions for up to 12 days after exposure. Subject will aggressively question staff and other D-Class, prying for personal [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG]. During this time, the individual will be incapable of normal social interaction.\n \n* <2m (Extremely potent): Anomalous symptoms are malignant, often irreversible, and induce violence in those exposed.\n * Obsession with coniferous plants. Exposed individuals will request to have coniferous saplings placed in their quarters for up to 13 days after exposure.\n * Elevated body temperature bordering on hyperthermia until room temperature is dropped to 3.2^^o^^C.\n * Extreme paranoia when outside of wooded environments.\n * Near-total mutism.\n * Interrogative compulsions when not mute. Subjects will aggressively question any nearby humans, prying for [REDACTED | SEE EXPERIMENT LOG] and repeatedly demand to be \"returned to the trees\".\n * Self-destructive behavior consistent with extreme body dysmorphia.\n * [REDACTED | SEE INTERVIEW WITH AGENT X5-9]\n\nSCP-3698 was first discovered on 7 January ████, when two ██████ County forest rangers reported finding a large number of bodies clustered around Douglas fir trees. After contact with the rangers was lost shortly thereafter, MTF Theta-4 \"Gardeners\" was called to the scene. After a series of remote operations, SCP-3698 and SCP-3698-1 were identified, and the area containing the SCP-3698-1 instances was designated Zone 3698-A. Samples of infected air were later collected and used for D-Class experimentation.\n\n||~ Image ||~ Transcribed Text ||\n|| [[image DriveA_3698_Note.jpg]] || Dufour, _\nDon't come back for us but don't let our work go to waste. I'm sorry I couldn't finish the referral, but I need you to do that now. At least I'll find some solace in knowing it won't end here. I can smell it now. Please tell the others I tried we can't let them down we can't let it out Dufour please don't let it [\"get out\"?] please remember us [unintelligible] trees I can see [unintelligible]. ||\n\nAs of 24 May ████, SCP-3698-2 is the designation given to Researcher ████ Rottbauer, who was exposed to extremely potent doses of SCP-3698 during the May 24 Incident. SCP-3698 tends to exhibit extreme distress around Director Paulsen, but is otherwise docile. As of the current revision of this document, SCP-3698-2 has only expressed one symptom characteristic of SCP-3698-exposed individuals: attachment to coniferous vegetation.\n\nSCP-3698-2 quickly forms symbiotic connections with coniferous plants, demonstrating a unique understanding of their biological needs despite having little prior botanical knowledge or experience. SCP-3698-2 often has long one-way conversations with coniferous plants placed in its room, though in an unidentified and currently undeciphered language. It is unknown why SCP-3698-2 did not succumb to other symptoms of SCP-3698 exposure. However, as of the current revision of this document, all experimentation on the nature of SCP-3698's traits or psychology is strictly forbidden by the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee.\n\n**Addendum 3698.1: Object Class Change** \nSCP-3698 class changed to Euclid in light of recent incident at Zone 3698-C and concerns brought before the O5 Council by Site Director Paulsen and Researcher Dufour. The concerns included the unpredictability of SCP-3698's appearance in nature and the inability to accurately predict SCP-3698's behavior due to technological limitations. Motion was approved on 20 March ████ by a 12-1 margin.\n\n**Addendum 3698.2: Rejected Object Class Change** \nDirector Paulsen has requested that SCP-3698's class be changed to Keter ██ times - █ times before the 24 May Incident and ██ after the incident. Each of these requests have been denied due to insufficient evidence of containment difficulty.\n\n**Addendum 3698.3: Archived Documents**\nThe following documents are considered relevant to SCP-3698's containment and have therefore been included in the page.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Announcement from Site 101 Director Paulsen]]\n\nThe following announcement was sent from Director Paulsen's Foundation email to all Site 101 Staff on 19 June ████ at 10:03. Email contained several flagged linguistic memes that triggered its immediate redirection to ██████████.███ for correction and redistribution. Director Paulsen was reprimanded for attempting to utilize the previous on-site incident for anti-Foundation rhetoric. His editing and viewing permissions for SCP-3698-related documents were also summarily revoked.\n\n> Good morning everyone,\n> \n> I want this stated for the record: the Euclid designation is insufficient, period. I don't care anymore if this results in my demotion; I owe my staff full honesty, just as I believe the Foundation owes every anomaly, however well-contained, due attention. After the May 24 Incident, I hoped they could finally come to see things our way. Alas, after reviewing the site's allotted budget for next year, I doubt they will.\n> \n> I'm going to be frank. There is absolutely no evidence that SCP-3698 is fully contained. In fact, based on Ji et al.'s report, SCP-3698's area of effect could be up to ████% larger than our current estimate. The figure, of course, is imprecise--something the higher-ups were keen to remind me of. I stress, however, that its inaccuracy is not the result of miscalculation but simply a side effect of our diminishing resources.\n> \n> In light of apparent budget cuts, I've submitted a site transfer request for ██% of researchers, █% of medical staff, ██% of armed personnel and █% of D-Class to surrounding facilities. Those of you who were selected for transfer will receive an email at around 6:30 specifying your new work detail. I want to assure everyone that this is not a demotion, and I wish you all the best of luck elsewhere. I want to offer the same sentiment to everyone remaining as well. You have all been invaluable assets to not only Site 101, but the Foundation as a whole.\n> \n> To those remaining, congratulations - and apologies - are in order. Things are not going to get easier around here, and I'm not going to be any more lax. The Rottbauer Lockdown is still in effect, and likely won't be lifted until Dufour's team can get their filtration system out of the prototyping phase. If it works, it'll be a monumental success, and maybe, just maybe, I won't be as stuck-up about the class designation.\n> \n> Until then, keep up the good work.\n> \n> As always: Secure, Contain, Protect.\n> \n> ████ Paulsen,\n> Site 101 Director\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Interview With Agent X5-9]]\n\n**Interview 3698-12:30-24-02-████**\n\n> **Interviewed:** MTF Chi-5 \"Connoisseurs\" Agent ███ Singh (X5-9)\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Site 101 Clinical Psychologist ████ Rottbauer\n> \n> **Foreword:** Rottbauer was to perform a routine psychological assessment with X5-9, who witnessed the only Foundation staff casualties caused by SCP-3698 until the ██ May Incident. X5-9 accompanied the team of technicians that regularly maintains the innermost barrier around Zone 3698-C. Due to repeated lapses into post-traumatic stress, the assessment was significantly delayed.\n> \n> <Begin Log, 12:30, 24 February  ████>\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** State your name and designation for the record, please. \n> \n> **X5-9:** ███ Singh, X5-9.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Okay, X5-9... could you walk me through what happened on February ██?\n> \n> **X5-9:** You mind if I get some water first?\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** No problem. Anything you need.\n> \n> //X5-9 gets a cup of water from a cooler. As he carries the cup back to his seat, his hand begins to shake. A small amount of water spills onto the floor.//\n> \n> **X5-9:** Shit - sorry. \n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Don't worry, Singh. Let's just get through this. If you need us to do any of those exercises, we can. Unfortunately, the Level-4s won't let me suspend this interview again.\n> \n> **X5-9:** I'm fine - just the nerves. We approached the second barrier at around 09:00, like always. The head tech, Li, let us in and almost immediately, Ingham started experiencing problems with his suit.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Could you be a little more specific?\n> \n> **X5-9:** He kept complaining about an indicator in his suit going off - the cooling system, I think. This was before the recall[[footnote]]All Foundation pressure-sealed suits manufactured prior to 2009 were recalled because of a fatal cooling/heating system error. The malfunction made minor leaks in the suits practically undetectable. As a result, a suit's integrity could be compromised without depressurization alarms sounding during even minor cooling/heating system errors. The recall was completed on 27 March ████. [[/footnote]], so we figured it was just a minor issue. We continued to the inner barrier and see that a camera on the east wall is damaged. Li opened up the gate and Yanez and Ingham stepped through while I wait outside.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Why did you wait outside?\n> \n> **X5-9:** Can't keep people out if you're on the other side of the bulletproof glass.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** I see. Please continue.\n> \n> **X5-9:** Everything ran smoothly for a while. Yanez set up a ladder and spotted Ingham while he went up to repair the camera. After a while Ingham started complaining that he's getting warm. He yells over to Yanez like \"The suit's cooling is broken - I'm gonna get winded if I don't lose some weight.\" So he unstrapped and dropped down his toolbelt. Just a few seconds after the tool belt hit the ground, Ingham stopped working - dropped his tools and jumped twelve feet down from the top of the ladder.\n> \n> //X5-9 takes a sip of water. His hand shakes as he tries to stabilize the cup at mouth-level.//\n> \n> **X5-9:** Ingham started rambling as he struggled to stand up. Kept muttering about the \"fresh pine\", \"Christmas morning\", all of that stuff - classic signs of exposure. Before I could get to him, Li tried to drag him outside the first barrier. Of course, Ingham didn't like that at all; he kicked Li square in the knee and knocked him over before darting back through the entrance. Yanez managed to chase him down, though, just as he was about to reach a tree, and got him restrained with some duct tape. He also found a small tear near a belt loop of Ingham's suit. Yanez opened the entrances while Li and I carried Ingham back to the Jeep.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Did you notice any unusual behavior from Li?\n> \n> **X5-9:** No - nothing. He seemed perfectly fine. I looked at his knee but the suit still seemed in tact. He responded to my orders without question and seemed pretty shaken by Ingham's behavior. Besides, I had Ingham to worry about first. Then we got back to the jeep and...\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Li incapacitated you, correct?\n> \n> **X5-9:** The last thing I heard before everything went black was Yanez yelling at him. I woke up about a half hour later and reached for the submachine gun on my side only to find a torn strap. Somehow, my suit wasn't compromised, so I pulled out my knife and assessed my surroundings. The jeep was still there, so clearly I hadn't been left for dead.\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Did you hear the other members of the team?\n> \n> **X5-9:** Not at first; snow's a pretty good sound absorber. I could only start to hear their commotion when I got right alongside the second barrier.\n> \n> //X5-9 remains silent for the next twenty seconds.//\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** ███, I'm sorry, but I need you to keep going. I'm going to need you to describe what happened after you re-entered Zone C.\n> \n> //X5-9 begins to heave.//\n> \n> **X5-9:** Li and Ingham were stripped - maybe they did it to themselves, maybe... I don't know. As I got closer... as...\n> \n> //X5-9 rubs the back of his head as his face reddens.//\n> \n> **X5-9:** They were drilling Yanez into a tree by his fucking hands and feet. Right through his fucking bones! And Yanez just kept screaming and his screams turned into pleas - begging for me to kill him. To just die. For God to let him go. What the fuck could I do? Li had my gun! They knew I was there! What the fuck could I have done?\n> \n> **Rottbauer:** Nobody's holding you responsible for this, ███ - \n> \n> **X5-9:** And then, just like that, the drill, the screaming, everything just stopped. No sound for a solid minute. I stood there as they fucking stared at me, trying to pull myself together - trying to think of a way out. Yanez... despite all the blood Yanez lost, he wasn't dead. His head, which had gone limp just a minute ago, looked up. His eyes met mine and... and he just says \"we're done decorating the tree\". Ingham and Li look at me and start repeating the same thing again and again until their vocal cords fucking froze and ripped apart.\n> \n> //X5-9 looks up at Rottbauer, tears visible on his face.//\n> \n> **X5-9:** And then they each took turns with the gun. They blew their brains out with my - \n> \n> //X5-9 rests his head back in his hands and begins to sob loudly. Rottbauer attempts to console him, and after 28 minutes is able to escort him out of the room.//\n> \n> <End Log, 13:15, 24 February  ████>\n\n**Post-Interview Statement | 24 February ████ | ████ Rottbauer:**\n\n> X5-9 is still in no shape to resume work. Every time he's around a firearm he lapses into post-traumatic psychosis. He should continue his regular medication as prescribed by Dr. Fahey and continue seeing me on a regular basis for CBT. Once again, I believe a small course of episode-specific amnestics could drastically improve his mental state.\n\n**Post-Interview Statement | 3 March ████ | █████████ Dufour:**\n\n> Since what happened at Zone C, one big question has kept me awake: What happened to Li? According to X5-9's observation, Li's suit had no tear in it upon leaving the inner barrier. I understand this is thrown into question given the fact that Ingham kicked Li's knee before leaving the barrier. However, considering that the suits are made of [REDACTED], I doubt that a single kick, much less one from a standard-issue boot, could do significant enough damage to cause a tear - at least immediately.\n> \n> Upon examining Li's suit, my team observed that the tear was not caused by impact alone. While the impact certainly did damage the material, it took continuous, localized stress for the suit to actually fail. From this, we've constructed a new timeline of Li's exposure:\n> \n> # Assault from Ingham. Li is kicked in the knee once with a standard-issue boot. He expresses no immediate symptoms and is able to understand and complete orders from X5-9. This would compress the [REDACTED] in the fabric at the point of impact, reducing their durability up to ██%.\n> # Fabric on the knee stretches and tears while Li and X5-9 transport Ingham to the jeep. As we discovered during the recent recall, the suits' fabric significantly limited motion in the field. MTFs routinely complained about their interference with aerobic activities. We've recorded ███ cases of these things coming apart due to intense stretching before. With the area on Li's suit already damaged, a tear would require far less extraneous activity than such cases.\n> # Li assaults X5-9. At this point, it is clear that Li's suit had torn and he has been exposed. He succumbs rapidly, as is standard, and exhibits characteristic symptoms accordingly.\n> \n> Of course, this raises another ugly question based on what we already know about SCP-3698. Li's symptoms are indicative of exposure to extremely potent SCP-3698, but according to X5-9's testimony and evidence at the scene, they manifested well outside the external barrier. My only explanation is that gas trapped in Ingham's suit escaped and entered Li's.\n> \n> But that would mean SCP-3698 does not behave like a normal gas - that it does not disperse so much as relocate from one individual to the next, like a school of fish or a pack of wolves. After all, both SCP-3698 samples and schools of fish tend to confine themselves to specific volumes. Both have directional behaviors as well, seeking out food or - in SCP-3698's case - Douglas fir trees and humans.\n> \n> The main issue with SCP-3698, plain and simple, is that we are too ignorant to determine if it is an object or an organism - whether it is indeed a gas or a cluster of intangible zooids. We do not have the equipment, the funding, or the personnel to determine any of this.\n> \n> SCP-3698 is a new breed of memetic anomaly - and I use the term \"breed\" intentionally here. By almost all measures, it doesn't exist - and according to the only machine that can measure it, it's non-anomalous - twenty points below even a minor reality bender. In other words, SCP-3698 is a pure meme - one that cannot be expressed or reliably detected. It can only be experienced and known by those it afflicts.\n> \n> The fact that we even found SCP-3698 is a miracle. The fact that we still consider it Safe is appalling.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Drive A Experiment Log]]\n\n**Note: The drive containing SCP-3698's experiment log was damaged during the events of 24-May ████ and several files contained within were corrupted.**\n\n\n**15:04 | 11 Jan ████**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[DATA CORRUPTED]\" hide=\" \"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**15:00 | 15 Jan ████**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[DATA CORRUPTED]\" hide=\" \"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**15:02 | 19 Jan ████**\n\n**Experimenter(s):** Researcher Donaldson, Researcher Parker\n**Subject(s):** D-9821\n**Conditions:** One vial of perceptible SCP-3698 will be introduced to subject in testing room.

It seems that, while the scent is still discernable, it doesn't trigger any visible psychological or physiological symptoms at this concentration. At least now we have a contained form of this thing that's somewhere between between \"deadly\" and \"unnoticeable\".\n\n**15:00 | 21 Jan ████**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[DATA CORRUPTED]\" hide=\" \"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n**Discussion:** 10m seems to be the magic distance. For the time being, D-3092 and D-2988 should be separated from their peers and placed under strict observation. We don't want another spree like D-4219's. Additionally, while the effects haven't been communicable thus far, we shouldn't take any liberties. The subjects that didn't display anomalous symptoms can be returned to their quarters.\n\n**15:00 | 26 Jan ████**\n\n**Experimenter(s):** Researcher Donaldson\n**Subject(s):** Group D-101-1\n**Conditions:** 50 D-Class living in Wing 1 will have vials introduced to their quarters, each of which will be set off remotely at exactly 15:00.

Statement below prepared by Dufour:**\n\n<Attached: █████████████████>\n\nIt has come to the attention of several Site 101 researchers that Director Paulsen has been complicit in Donaldson and Parker's unethical experiments on D-Class personnel. We believe that his personal fears regarding SCP-3698 have hindered his effectiveness as a leader and hope that he can be brought before the Ethics Committee and O5 Council for disciplinary action. We have attached the Experiment Log to this letter for your review. As you will see, several of these experiments utilized egregious numbers of D-Class, violating Foundation Ethics Code 4.A.098.\n\nWe have become increasingly concerned at the testing conditions of one D-Class in particular, D-8883. D-8883's tests repeatedly involved excessive psychological trauma both to him and to other subjects. Instead of being separated from his peers, D-8883 has been exposed to ██ other D-Class during tests and allowed to maul and torment them under the guise of routine experimentation. When questioned about their motives for doing this, Donaldson and Parker have been dismissive and obstructive. They were also dismissive when Rottbauer insisted on running psychological debriefs on exposed D-Class prior to decommissioning, insisting that such treatment  would \"interfere with long-term observational results\".\n\nWe request:\n\n* That Director Paulsen be held before the Ethics Committee on charges of attempting to conceal information from both the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee on numerous occasions. This renders him complicit in the series of unethical experiments that occurred under Researchers Donaldson and Parker.\n\n* That Researchers Donaldson and parker be assessed for antisocial personality disorder and denied access to all D-Class experimentation as soon as possible.\n\n* That Researchers Donaldson and Parker be reprimanded for their continued unethical experimentation on D-Class under Foundation Ethics Code 4.A.098, 4.A.201, and 4.A.202.\n\nWhile the Foundation routinely uses D-Class for experimentation that operates in the moral gray area - and yes, sometimes in the dark - it also demonstrates parsimony whenever possible. Through his \"by any means necessary\" philosophy, Paulsen has clearly demonstrated poor leadership and professionalism.
