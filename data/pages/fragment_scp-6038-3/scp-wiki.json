Each module of SCP-6038-1 should be kept separately in a standard Safe-Class container under the supervision of the Paratechnological division of Site-63. In order to prevent the emergence of SCP-6038-2 instances, under no circumstances should the components SCP-6038-1 be assembled and activated.\n\n+++ __**Description:**__\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=wheelbarrow2 | caption=SCP-6038-1 main body | width=100px]]\n\nSCP-6038-1 is a paratechnological construct capable of autonomous behavior. Its main body resembles a Wheelbarrow bomb disposal robot, including a mechanical claw and drilling tool that allows it to manipulate objects and drill small holes in the ground. Reverse engineering of SCP-6038-1 has identified 5 core functionality modules in its hardware:\n\n* **Module A** consists of an embedded processor running a non-sentient tactical AI. This module controls the behavior and decisions of SCP-6038-1. It has shown a highly adaptable response to encountering new threats.\n\n* **Module B** consists of an ultrasonic echolocation sensor. This sensor is powerful enough to give SCP-6038-1 an awareness of its surroundings in a radius of 3 kilometers with a granularity of 2 millimeters.\n\n* **Module C** consists of a 3D printing cloning device. This module is responsible for creating instances of SCP-6038-2. It also contains a morphogenetic field generator [[footnote]] See [[[SCP-4211]]] and [[[SCP-3241]]].[[/footnote]], which allows it to temporarily alter the thaumaturgical properties of SCP-6038-2 instances.\n\n* **Module D** is a hyper high-frequency voice synthesizer. SCP-6038-1 uses it to render ultrasonic voice incantations in Mycenaean Greek, inaudible to humans but tuned to the hearing range of SCP-6038-2. These incantations allow SCP-6038-1 to exert control over all instances of SCP-6038-2 in a radius of 2.5 kilometers.\n\n* **Module E** is a thaumaturgicaly enhanced solar power generator and battery. It integrates thaumaturgical sigils associated with the Turkic sun god, Koyash, into the photovoltaic system, augmenting its energy efficiency a 593% from the expected norm.\n\nSCP-6038-2 instances are cloned maxillary teeth belonging to a Dracus Colchis, a now-extinct species of Georgian dragon. SCP-6038-2 anomalous properties manifest when planted into firm ground. After implantation, SCP-6038-2 instances can grow into two meters tall, faceless humanoids made of an ivory-like substance and resembling Archaic Period Greek statues. In this form, an SCP-6038-2 instance can grow weapons made of the same material as its body. SCP-6038-1 creates new instances of SCP-6038-2 utilizing the cloning device on Module C.\n\nSCP-6038-1 can activate the growth of SCP-6038-2 into its humanoid form performing an incantation from Module D. SCP-6038-1 does not appear capable of maintaining control of more than 50 active instances of SCP-6038-2 at the same time. During combat, SCP-6038-1 will hide itself and control the operation of SCP-6038-2 from a safe distance. Initially, the weapons manifested by SCP-6038-2 are consistent with those of an ancient Greek phalanx. However, SCP-6038-1 is capable of temporarily altering the weaponry manifested by SCP-6038-2 employing morphogenetic thaumaturgy. SCP-6038-2 instances can remain active for an average time of 5 hours before dissolving into fine ivory-like dust.  \n\n+++++ **Recovery Log:**\n\nSCP-6038-2 was first discovered by Agent Ramírez, Foundation operative and liaison in [REDACTED], Central America. SCP-6038-2 attacks targeted rural towns associated with a local guerrilla group known as \"Las Víboras\". Agent Ramírez figured out this connection and the location of the town most likely to be targeted next. MTF Tau-52 was deployed to the zone, finding the town completely overrun by SCP-6038-2 instances with most of its inhabitants already killed.\n\n[[<]]\n[[include component:image-block | name=spartoi2| caption=MTF Tau-52's cam footage of SCP-6038-2 instance | width=100px]]\n[[/<]]\n\nMTF Tau-52 proceeded to engage with SCP-6038-2 instances, which showed resistance to small-arms fire. The team switched to antitank weaponry which proved effective. However, more instances kept emerging from the nearby jungle to engage the MTF. Furthermore, newer instances began manifesting modern weapons instead of ancient ones. MTF Tau-52 was taken by surprise by this development, which lead them to start suffering casualties. This prompted the MTF leader to request aerial support to carpet bomb the area in order to control the hostile forces. The aerial bombing was successful in stopping the ongoing assault of SCP-6038-2.\n\nFurther inspection of the zone recovered a disabled SCP-6038-1. SCP-6038-1 had been hiding in the nearby vegetation, producing more instances of SCP-6038-2. The airstrike damaged it to a point of partial neutralization but left its hardware intact enough for successful repair and research by the Paratech Division. It is believed that SCP-6038-1 managed to avoid total destruction from the aerial bombing by commanding various instances of SCP-6038-2 to shield it. SCP-6038-1 was secured and taken to Site-63. This incident demonstrates the remarkable ability of SCP-6038-1 to rapidly adapt to new threats. The Paratech Division believes that had it not been disabled by the first bombing, it would have adapted SCP-6038-2 to manifest anti-air weapons.\n\nSince most SCP-6038 incidents involved the termination of every witness, there was no necessity for mass amnestic application to the local population. A single survivor was found in the aftermath of the last incident (See **Addendum A**). The mass execution of the four towns was attributed to local guerrillas, and the SCP-6038 recovery mission was disguised as an anti-terrorist operation.\n\n+++++ **Update regarding GOI-1043:**\n\nCryptological analysis of SCP-6038-1 firmware has confirmed suspicions that  SCP-6038 was developed by the Valravn Corporation, furtherly identified as GOI-1043. This confirms the report by Agent Ramírez that governmental authorities of [REDACTED] hired the services of GOI-1043 as part of its counterinsurgency campaign against the anomalous armed group known as \"Las Víboras\".  --Foundation operatives have already begun procedures to pressure the government of [REDACTED] to stop employing anomalous weapons in its military campaign-- (See **Addendum B**).\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=valra| caption=Alleged GOI-1043 logo retrieved from SCP-6038-1 firmware | width=100px]]\n\nGOI-1043 is a Private Military Company specializing in anomalous warfare. They are mainly involved in asymmetric warfare conflicts in developing countries. GOI-1043 is suspected to be active in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and South Asia. The Foundation's official policy towards **Anomalous Private Military Companies** (APMCs) is currently being discussed by the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Foundation's **Global Geopolitics and Counterinsurgency Department**.\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++++ **Addendum A:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++++ Interview Video Log with Jacinta ██████.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n**NOTE:** After the events leading to the containment of SCP-6038, Jacinta ██████ (16) was recovered by members of MTF Tau-52. She avoided detection from SCP-6038 by hiding in the local barn. The following interview took place in the Site-63 infirmary.\n----\n\n++++++ [BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** Hi, I have come to check on you. How are you feeling?\n\n(//Jacinta ██████ does not respond.//)\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** I'm here to help (//sits down next to the interviewed's bed//). My name is Guadalupe. You are Jacinta, right?\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** My father never came back and somehow I knew what had happened. Then those things came... My mother hid me in the corn sacks and told me not to move or scream no matter what I saw or heard. I saw her get dismembered in front of my own eyes... and I could not scream.\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** I... I am...\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** You say you want to help. Can you bring back my mother? My father? Everyone? Otherwise, I don't see how you can be of help.\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** I... I am sorry... I wish I could do something. In truth, I'm the one that needs your help. I want to understand why this happens so I can make sure it never happens again. What do you know about \"Las Víboras\"? Were you helping them?\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** Las guerrillas? Not much really. They just eventually came by and we gave them food and shelter. Sometimes we delivered their flyers. They didn't want us to be that involved. \"It was risky,\" they said, \"if the //carceleros//[[footnote]]Jailers. Slang commonly used by the Serpent's Hand to refer to the Foundation. [[/footnote]] found out they would take away your memory\". It seems they underestimated you...\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** By //carceleros// do you mean us, the Foundation? We didn't do this. We were trying to save you. We went there to protect you...\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** You are always watching right? You see all the fucked up shit the government has done to us. Yet you only give a shit if magic happens... \"Las Víboras\" are trying to make things better for everyone, you just want to keep everything the same.\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** Did you know that Las Víboras...\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** Are //brujos//[[footnote]]Thaumaturges.[[/footnote]]? That is why they are so feared. We don't have big guns to oppose the government, but spells can get us by. We can be powerful enough to protect our lives... and our dignity. That is the reason you are so afraid of magic, right? That is why it is your job to ensure we forget about it...\n\n**Agent Ramírez:** I...\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** Are you going to do it, //carcelero//? Are you going to take away my memory? Go ahead. You can take away my memories. Everyone's memory if you want. That will not erase what happened here. That will not erase the truth. \n\n++++++ [END LOG]\n\n-----\n**END NOTE:** Jacinta ██████ has been scheduled for amnestic treatment and transfer to a civilian hospital.\n-----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++++ **Addendum B:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++++ **Video Log: Meeting between Dr. Guevara and Agent Millard.**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n**NOTE:** After the SCP-6038 incident, Agent Millard from the **Global Geopolitics and Counterinsurgency Department**[[footnote]]Department of SCPF in charge of handling anomalous matters that can affect international political stability.[[/footnote]] requested a meeting with the leader of Site-63.\n----\n\n++++++ [BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** Greeting Agent... Millard. I think we haven't met before.\n\n**Agent Millard:** Greetings Dr. Guevara. I'm a new transfer from the Agency. I came here to help the Foundation in matters of interagency and international collaboration. Let's have a chat about the incident with SCP-6038.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** I see. What is the matter?\n\n**Agent Millard:** Look, I'm going to get this straight. (//Leans into Dr. Guevara. Takes down his sunglasses keeping eyes contact.//) This was a matter of the GGCD and you should have not interfered.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** We were not notified of any friendly operation beforehand...\n\n**Agent Millard:** Didn't you get a general directive last month to stay away from politically unstable areas? That \"guerrilla territory\" was outside of your jurisdiction? You know how we work. You are only told what you need to know and you must comply nevertheless.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** People were getting killed. Civilians. And my operative correctly identified anomalous activity. Our duty is to contain, secure and protect.\n\n**Agent Millard:** Those places were terrorist hideouts. And not regular ones. We are calling them REGACS. **Radical Extremist Groups with Anomalous Capabilities**. You are right, we have a duty to protect civilians. But those who support terrorists had renounced both their right to call themselves civilians... and to be protected.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** Who are \"we\" in this case?\n\n**Agent Millard:** We are, of course, the SCP Foundation. And the GOC. And PENTAGRAM. The CPIA[[footnote]]Central Paranormal Intelligency Agency[[/footnote]]. A-DEA[[footnote]]Abnormal Drug Enforcement Administration[[/footnote]]. And all of the democratic nations. We are everyone who wants to keep civilization running.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** And since when are we \"outsourcing\" our job to mercenaries?\n\n**Agent Millard:** We didn't \"outsource\" anything. Valravn was under the payroll of the local government. We were just observers in this conflict. Keeping it from breaking normalcy. Making sure it didn't escalate outside acceptable parameters... Honestly, can you blame the local authorities? They are not capable of handling the military and political ramifications of an anomalous insurgency. Neither is your site, for that matter. No offense.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** None taken... Still, why allow the deployment of military-grade paratech against unresisting targets? Why permit this level of violence? If support and awareness for Las Víboras were the problems we could have carried out a mass amnestization campaign. My site could have handled the situation, we just need more funding and manpower.\n\n**Agent Millard:** And then what? Las Víboras would come back and radicalize them again. And we would have to keep doing this dance over and over again. Amnestics are not cheap, just saying. And as I said before, this is not a Foundation operation. This is a third-party anti-terrorist campaign under the **GGCD** supervision. Your site has all the funding it needs to carry out its current duties. Stick to that.\n\n (//Agent Millard gives a stern look to Dr.Guevara. Then his expression softens with a half-smile.//)\n\n**Agent Millard:** I understand how it may look. But keep an open mind. These private military contractors are just a tool. More like a dog, a mad one. Sometimes we, as institutions, can not act as freely as we should. That is when a mad dog comes in handy. We just loosen up its leash a little. It makes some tactical bites. Surgical strikes, you know? Then we tighten the leash again. And if something goes wrong, we blame it on the mad dog. As simple as that.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** I'm still not quite sold on the idea.\n\n**Agent Millard:** Well, in this case, it is fortunate that this decision is well beyond your paycheck. Look doctor, no harsh feelings. You did your best job to the best of your knowledge. And I respect that. Mistakes were made but I'm not here to cause unnecessary friction. I'm just here to tie a loose end.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** Loose end?\n\n**Agent Millard:** There was a survivor. A young girl, right?\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** Yes, we were about to give her amnestic treatment and release her.\n\n**Agent Millard:** Well, that will have to wait. I'm afraid I must borrow her. Just a quick chat. There are some questions... some information that may be of interest to us.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** You weren't taking prisoners in the first place. Why are you suddenly interested in this one?\n\n**Agent Millard:** Well, none of this was part of the original scenario. But since we are already here, I thought, \"why not make some lemonade\"?\n\n++++++ [END LOG]\n\n-----\n**END NOTE:**  Jacinta ██████ amnestic treatment was postponed until further notice and she was scheduled for transfer to GGCD custody.\n-----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++++ **Addendum C:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++++ **Video Log: Site-63 infirmary.**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n**NOTE:** Two days before Jacinta ██████ scheduled transfer from Site-63 to GGCD custody, Agent Ramirez visited her at the infirmary.\n----\n\n++++++ [BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Jacinta ██████:** Why am I still here?

The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. They have been doing that for years. They don't even have to be sure they are involved in something. Just a simple suspicion is enough to sentence a whole town. And we are not supposed to do anything about it. War is not an anomaly, after all. This time we intervened because they decided to get creative with the methods and hired those \"ravens\" and that fucking robot. But even then we were not supposed to.\n\n**Dr. Guevara:** ...  \n\n**Agent Ramírez:** In all my years as your \"eyes\" in the region I had seen so many massacres carried out with just guns and knives.
