Again.\n\nWe've been noticing a reduction in the shipments of [[[Asset 'Florida Orange' | Florida Orange]]]. At first I was concerned that we would see a return to previous levels of employee dissatisfaction. While we haven't seen a noticeable downturn, there have been numerous complaints regarding running out of Florida Orange, including multiple physical outbursts that have required temporary restraint of otherwise non-violent Foundation Researchers.\n\nI cannot afford to handle an insurrection simply because we do not have enough Florida Orange to go around.\n\nTell me that you can do something about this.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Tilda D.

SCP-999's public documentation is **not** to be modified without direct approval of the FSD. In addition, any requests or complaints regarding SCP-999 are to be forwarded directly to Department Head Iverson.\n\nUnder no circumstances should the rest of The Foundation learn of SCP-999's neutralization.\n\n**Description:** SCP-999 was a large gelatinous mass that caused near-instant euphoria when touched. SCP-999-1 referred to the harvested offal of SCP-999 that was used in the production of Asset 'Florida Orange'.\n\nFollowing the debut and initial distribution of Asset 'Florida Orange', Site-19 saw an 85% reduction in employee complaints, and an overall increase in employee satisfaction by 43%. Despite initial reports stating that euphoria remained in subjects long after consumption, due to the rush of endorphins caused by SCP-999-1, when the effect faded, subjects face greater mental distress. As a result, over 95% of Site-19 has become addicted to SCP-999-1, and demand increased to the point where production was unable to keep up.\n\nAs a result of overharvesting of SCP-999 to meet the new demand, the anomaly was neutralized following an emergency harvest; SCP-999 was found to be non-responsive, and has since failed to show any signs of regeneration or life.\n\n**Addendum 1:** Asset 'Florida Grey'\n\nDue to the neutralization of SCP-999, it is no longer possible to produce additional SCP-999-1. At the present time, the remaining inventory is as follows:\n[[=]]\n||~ Product ||~ Remaining Inventory ||\n|| Unprocessed SCP-999-1 || ~50kg ||\n|| Processed Asset 'Florida Orange' || ~300 Gallons ||\n[[/=]]\n\nIt is estimated that at the current rate of demand, the supply will be depleted within ~2 months time. As a result, the creation of an alternative product is required.\n\nProduction of 'Florida Grey' is to begin at Site-19 within 6 months, with multiple processing machines to be installed within the site's utility tunnels. It is expected that 'Florida Grey' will be able to meet the demand levels at Site-19, without the need to expend the remaining 'Florida Orange' stores.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=treatment.jpg|\n    caption=Asset 'Florida Grey' Processing Center A|\n    align=left|    \n    width=313px|\n]]\n\n**Asset 'Florida Grey':** Asset 'Florida Grey' refers to a product replacing Asset 'Florida Orange', and the processing facilities utilized in its creation. Tests determined that the chemical and anomalous compounds that cause the euphoric effects of Asset 'Florida Orange' persist within waste products at a concentration of 95%.\n\nProcessing facilities have been installed and integrated into Site-19's plumbing systems. These systems process all waste water from Site-19, and are able to extract this product from waste materials, which are recycled into Asset 'Florida Grey'. Due to the sustainable nature of 'Florida Grey', it is expected to permanently address the supply chain issues.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= abailey@scp.int\n|to= miverson@scp.int\n|cc= none\n|subject= I don't believe it\n]]\nHowdy again!\n\nI don't know how you did it again, but the new Florida package is an even bigger hit!
