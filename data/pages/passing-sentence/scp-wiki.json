His arms were folded again. \"Not like you'll have a locker at Area-06.\"\n\nVeiksaar winced, and they both knew why. Area-06 was where they sent misbehaving Foundation personnel who were too useful or too dangerous to amnesticize or execute. Among several dim luminaries of Site-43, one of her predecessors as I&T chief was there.\n\nShe obviously didn't want to talk, or probably even think, about that, so she changed the subject. \"Since I'm going to be in prison for the rest of my life, would you mind terribly...\"\n\n\"Only villains exposit,\" Sokolsky reminded her.\n\nShe blinked. \"Yes, go on.\"\n\nPensak smirked.\n\nSokolsky put his legs up on the desk. \"You want to know where I got all the password instances from.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Rather a lot, yes. You sent seven of them out into the field for starters, before you used the REISNO cannon -- which was bullshit, by the way.\"\n\nHe kept mum.\n\n\"You sent out five more from Site-120, plus the one I stole, so here's my question: where did you get thirteen copies of 5109?\"\n\n\"It'll make you a villain, if you answer her,\" Pensak reminded him.\n\nSokolsky grinned.\n\nThen he answered her.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 2008\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 8 September\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nKaren Elstrom couldn't see.\n\nThat part wasn't her fault. She'd been violently ill for almost two days, which //also// wasn't her fault; someone who worked in Administration and Oversight, someone who worked for //her,// had suffered a critical lapse of hand-washing at the outset of flu season, and a few bad doorknobs later here she was. Laid out by something completely non-anomalous, almost certainly the //fucking// flu, for which she had already been immunized. The odds of that were 7 to 3, and Elstrom wasn't so self-centred that she craved all distinction universally.\n\nShe walked straight into a janitor's cart, sending a mop clattering to the floor; this //was// her fault. It wasn't her fault that she couldn't see, but she was walking the halls of Site-43 whilst violently ill because of her own stupidity. She'd thought she was stocked up on anti-emetic meds, more than enough to see her through the yearly lockdown on September 8 -- //worst goddamn timing, Jesus Christ// -- only to find that she was, instead, stocked up on anti-//memetics.// She couldn't remember requisitioning those, which...\n\n//Yeah, don't think about that right now.//\n\nElstrom knew the way to Health and Pathology off by heart, so it didn't matter that she couldn't see. Down the hall, towards the Inter-Sectional Subway System, then left down another hall, and she'd be there. The last stretch was a long walk, but at least she wouldn't have to deal with foot traffic; everyone in the Site was bunkered down in their dorms, except for the poor sods in PTF Sampi-5243.\n\nAs if on cue, she heard a distant explosion. Not so distant as she'd expected, but then, her senses weren't exactly perfect right now. She was almost at her destination, if her internal gyroscope could be trusted, just a few more steps. The Section signage loomed above her, but it didn't look quite right...\n\nHer vision resolved just in time to make out the wording, clear as day: \"ACROAMATIC ABATEMENT FACILITY AAF-D.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"Oh, //fuck.//\"\n\nThere was a sudden rush of air through the open airlock, and she ran in literally blind terror. //Shit shit shit shit.// She suddenly remembered that she had a phone in her dorm room, that she very obviously should have simply called for help, and cursed her influenzic brain. //Stupid stupid stupid __fuck__!// She slipped on the clean hall tiles, staggered to one side, struck her head on the glass of an office window -- //Archives and Revision?// -- and fell through the swinging doors. They swung shut behind her as she hit the carpet, hard.\n\nHer head felt funny. It was, at least a little bit, her fault.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Karen?\"\n\nShe felt much better now.

They felt fuller than they were supposed--\n\n\"Karen, you still alive down there?\"\n\nShe opened her eyes. She was staring at the fabric of a desk chair, which she had obviously knocked over. She could see the coffee stains. There were rather a lot of them. Or were they...\n\n\"You threw up on Harry's floor, Karen.\"\n\n//Coke stains. Right.//\n\nShe turned over onto her back, avoiding the sight of what she could smell beside her. She gazed up blearily at the bald head which loomed above, arms outstretched. She gradually realized the arms were attached to a body, not just the head, and that was enough for her to trust them. She reached up.\n\nSokolsky pulled her to her feet. \"You weren't wearing your tracker. Everybody's looking for you.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" she muttered. \"Don't tell them.\" She closed her eyes.\n\n\"Don't tell them what?\" \n\nShe heard the door swing open, felt him help her walk through it. She wanted to fall asleep in his arms, //but not like that,// and she realized her stomach wasn't upset anymore. \"Where I was.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Wouldn't dream of it.\"\n\nThe slush was moving around in her head again, and she groaned. \"Ugh.\"\n\n\"Gonna make it?

Why does that matter?\"\n\nVeiksaar stood up. \"It's how she //got it// that's interesting. This story is true?\"\n\nSokolsky nodded. \"She told me everything. I promised to keep it secret if she did.\" He smiled. \"I told McInnis, of course. They monitored her in H&P, but she didn't show any sign of anything anomalous. Thought her sense of... mental congestion, was just the flu passing through her system. By the time they released her, she was visibly fine.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\" Veiksaar thumped the plaster wall. \"5109 came out of 5243.\"\n\n\"What?\" Pensak stared at her, then stared at Sokolsky.\n\n\"The Breach that Keeps On Making Anomalies.\" Sokolsky put his hands behind his head. \"Elstrom got too close to AAF-D, and she picked something up. Just like how Deering picked up his mirror monster.

He'd taken to holding her at arm's length, by the forehead.\n\nPensak had gone to check on the detainees: Zavia Morse from Site-91 and Sunita Misra from Site-36, each still holding on to the copy of the password they'd snagged before their plans were thwarted. The retrieval would take some doing.\n\nSokolsky slid a gum packet out of his labcoat pocket, popped one of the blisters, and pressed the pellet between his teeth.

Even Ibanez no longer seemed so jazzed; when she stopped poking Blank and started maliciously kicking Wettle's heels every time he nodded off, Sokolsky decided it was time to begin.\n\n\"Looks like the Director won't be joining us.\"\n\nPensak sighed. \"I called Site-64K, they're sending someone to check on 79. It's possible McInnis' mole was already active before he got there. He might already be dead.\"\n\nThat cast something of a pall over most of the faces in the room. Allan McInnis was nobody's best friend, but he was family to five of the people in this room.

There's just one more thing we need to do, to put a big red bow on the entire affair.\"\n\nPensak slugged Ibanez in the jaw. \n\nShe hit the floor softly; it wasn't a long fall for her. \"That wasn't it,\" Sokolsky shouted as the security chief then shoved Veiksaar into the remaining task force members, and they scattered around and over her desk. Wettle fell over in a hail of books, while Blank banged his knee on Sokolsky's chair and began to swear.\n\nPensak pointed his service weapon at Sokolsky, and began to speak in measured tones. \"Seven passwords, Daniil.

Now spit it out, and keep your blood to yourself.\"\n\nIt took more than two minutes to transfer the passwords, and Sokolsky felt his mental burden growing lighter with each sequence of characters. When the final one was out, he allowed the relief he felt to fill his eyes; Pensak peered at them cautiously, and Sokolsky could tell that the man knew he'd won. \n\nPensak tapped a new password -- almost certainly //the// password -- into his tablet, resetting the room's security features. He was locking them in. \"I'll be sure to tell someone you're in here,\" he explained, as he reached into the holster where his weapon had been and withdrew a small plastic breathing apparatus. \"Tomorrow at the latest.\"\n\nPensak fixed the apparatus over his mouth, and tapped his tablet one last time.
