Trains and airplanes leading to SCP-8530 are to be delayed or cancelled. References to SCP-8530 in media are to be kept to a minimum. Preparations are in place should the need arise to remove SCP-8530 from the public consciousness.\n\nThese measures will be replaced with complete Containment Procedures as soon as investigations are finished.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8530 is the city Maladh (ملاذ) located in Egypt from the moment of its creation until Incident-8530-G. It was built by SCP-8530-A on top of a small desert village over the course of 10 years. It has transformed into a tourism hotspot famous for skyscrapers like the Spiral and the Moon next to projects like Maladh Center Mall, the largest cinema complex in Egypt and the Greenhouse Towers. The original village and its small population have since been entirely displaced.\n\nSCP-8530-A is Mirza Qadir, the founder and governor of SCP-8530. 90% of all businesses operating in SCP-8530 are directly affiliated with SCP-8530-A.\n\nSCP-8530 first came to the attention of the Foundation during a joint mission with the Global Occult Coalition and the Horizon Initiative in an effort to contain [[[KTE-5503-Bice-Copernicus]]]. In preparation for this containment effort, it was noted that neither the Foundation nor the Global Occult Coalition had any presence in the city at the time.\n\nA city the size of SCP-8530 would at minimum demand increased data surveillance and the localization of either three Level-0 or one Level-1 Informant. As no such action has taken place, malicious interference is suspected, necessitating a full analysis of SCP-8530. \n\n@@ @@\n\n++++ **Meeting-8530-A**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"padding:14px; margin-bottom: 2px; border-radius: 8px; border: solid 2px #000;\"]]\n\n**Attendees:**\n* Agent [[[exit-interview|Ellen O'Connor]]], Department of Analytics\n* Agent Tess (Codename), Disinformation Bureau\n* Director [[[scp-7886|Heba Gomaa]]], Site-107\n* Captain Emmanuel Tirk, MTF-Eta-77 (\"Spheres Within Spheres\")\n\n**Location:** Site-107\n\n**Topic:** Assessment of SCP-8530\n\n**Language:** English\n\n-----\n\n**Tess:** Meeting begins. For the record, all information is given out in files as Site-107 currently lacks a functioning projector.\n\n**Gomaa:** Only because our budget is continuously–\n\n**Tess:** Don't interrupt me. Additionally, Captain Tirk has joined us to provide useful intel on KTE-5503.\n\n**O'Connor:** The Angel is in the city?\n\n**Tirk:** I would bet on it.\n\n**Tess:** We can move on to that later — first, the assessment of Analytics.\n\n**O'Connor:** Right. There's a high chance the whole city is anomalous.\n\n**Gomaa:** Hold on, all of it?\n\n**O'Connor:** That or something is messing with all the data we got. The logistics of Maladh don't make any sense. The roads can't transport all the water the city consumes, and its electrical bill is enough for a continent.\n\n**Tess:** Why has this not been noticed before?\n\n**O'Connor:** Because you can't notice it. The analyst looking at Maladh's power grid ended up with internally consistent numbers to anything she could find. Same for the water transportation.  Even if I put two of them together, everything would match up. But the numbers change.\n\n**[**O'Connor throws files of an analysis repeated three times on the table. The numbers are censored. All files look vastly different.**]**\n\n**O'Connor:** Comparing numbers leads to the same effect. But I know my team. The methods change because the data changes.\n\n**Tess:** Meaning what?\n\n**O'Connor:** It means the logistics don't add up. It's like a kaleidoscope that is always right no matter where you look at the anomaly.\n\n**Gomaa:** Wait, is that it? The city is already an anomaly now?\n\n**O'Connor:** Of course. The fact that it bends logistics alone makes this an Analytics threat.\n\n**Gomaa:** I don't think that's– it could be a single actor that's causing this.\n\n**O'Connor:** If it was only the logistics that was wrong, sure. But we're also dealing with the Chaos Insurgency.\n\n**Tess:** //(sighs)// Is that why you came personally?\n\n**Gomaa:** //(under her breath)// Of course Analytics only shows up when it's their own chaos to deal with.\n\n**O'Connor:** Fiveteen different cells of the Insurgency have been discovered to operate in Maladh. Do any of you know what that means?\n\n**[**She throws more files at the table listing a bunch of organizations and what might connect them to the Insurgency: \"your Car Insurance\", the restaurant \"Catering Isolated\", or the \"Causality Institute\".**]**\n\n**O'Connor:** It means this will blow up. The Insurgency's precognition thrives best in chaotic situations. This many cells here are our metaphorical vultures circling a soon-to-be-dead animal.\n\n**Gomaa:** Are these names originally in English?\n\n**O'Connor:** Only the restaurant name is translated. The acronym doesn't show up in Arabic.\n\n**Gomaa:** Okay, but that really sounds more like a coincidence. \n\n**O'Connor:** The Insurgency is not the only GoI active here, as Tirk here can tell you.\n\n**Tirk:** //(nods)// KTE-5503 went [[[sc-18-005-18-350|off the radar]]] for a while, but we managed to track it down to Maladh. It's here. We don't know why it's here, but we have a few guesses. It might be part of a fifthist migration, given that Hector Canvera, and countless sectless also made– \n\n**O'Connor:** //(stands up)// Did you say Canvera?\n\n**Tirk:** Yeah? Fifth-riches man, famous for–\n\n**O'Connor:** Hector Canvera [[[stairway-to-the-stars|left the planet in 2017]]].\n\n**Tirk:** What? No, we tracked him like all survivors of the fifthist deicide.\n\n**[**O'Connor shakes her head in thought.**]**\n\n**Gomaa:** Survivors?\n\n**Tirk:** Not in the literal sense. The death of the god, or whatever it was, that held Fifthism together caused a worldwide crisis of faith. Most sects didn't survive. Even the Fifth Church didn't. But you know how some are, just escaped faith, but they can't wait for the next hit of opium.\n\n**Gomaa:** //(narrows eyes)// Are you still talking about fifthism here?\n\n**Tirk:** Canvera and the angel are the opium. I think there was a smaller cult leader a bit ago who tried the same in Maladh.\n\n**Gomaa:** Did we have any measures in place to maybe help the people who just escaped from a cult?\n\n**Tess:** That was handled by the Bureau. And the majority of former Fifthists seem to have done fine on their own.\n\n**[**Gomaa sighs in exasperation.**]**\n\n**O'Connor:** Okay, we've got the Insurgency and a fifthist gathering with a soon-to-arrive impossible billionaire. There's a last faction missing from the picture.\n\n**Tirk:** Do you mean the Soiling Craft? Because of the water–\n\n**O'Connor:** No. They're not in Africa right now.\n\n**Gomaa:** The governor.\n\n**O'Connor:** //(nods quickly)// I have evidence that Mirza Qadir was connected to the Insurgency shortly before founding this city.\n\n**Tirk:** Great.\n\n**O'Connor:** //(shakes her head adamantly)// No, the Canvera thing still doesn't fit. Unless–\n\n**Tirk:** We got a bit offtrack, as far as the Fifthists are involved I need to add we're here for the Angel. I don't care about anything else, but that thing doesn't leave this city uncontained. \n\n**O'Connor:** Personal grudge?\n\n**Tirk:** That thing is a perversion of individuality. It turns you into a bizarro reflection of yourself. A reality bender wearing your face, everything made a mockery of your former self.\n\n**O'Connor:** //(snaps fingers)// Of course, give me the files, I think this could mean–\n\n**Tess:** You may speculate after this meeting. I believe we have gathered enough information. The activity of the city is far outside our tolerance level.\n\n**Gomaa:** That sounds like you want to go scorched earth on them.\n\n**Tess:** Of course. I would prefer to call Nu-7 in, but given the limited time, our currently deployed Task Forces should be sufficient.\n\n**Gomaa:** You can't. If you condemn the city, you condemn all the civilians with it. And if this is as much of a powder keg as you're making it out to be, then we absolutely cannot counter it with firepower.\n\n**Tess:** The procedure will be up to my MTF Captain Faez, as this operation falls under the Bureau. I believe that will be all. Meeting–\n\n**Gomaa:** //(hard)// And the bureau falls under me as long as we are in Egypt. Did you forget who of us is the Regional Director?\n\n**[**Tess's expression does not change as she turns to Gomaa.**]**\n\n**Tess:** Very well. Will precision strikes be agreeable?\n\n**[**Gomaa hesitates. She nods.**]**\n\n**Tess:** Meeting adjourned.\n-----\n= **Supplemental Material**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"KTE-5503\" hide=\"KTE-5503\"]]\n\nKTE-5503 is a deviant Empyrean entity that was summoned from the \"Fifth World\", the domain and part of the deceased Apex Pluripotent Entity Complex \"Starfish\". It appears as a mirror accompanied by five space-warping axes distributed around it. Its previous angelic duties consisted of the reflection of fifth light from the Starfish to believers of its various cults.\n\nIndestructible as is typical of Empyrean entities.\n\nCurrent motivations unknown. Deviance is confirmed as the death of its god made its duty impossible. Can be fed with reality anchors tuned to the Fifth World, though this is not recommended as it uses the eaten reality to turn people into reality benders.\n\nInformation is shared between the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, and to a limited degree the Horizon Initiative to stop the threat posed by KTE-5503. GOC codeword used in all documentation for ease of communication.\n\nOperation Come and See is currently being devised as a temporary containment measure.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Hector Canvera\" hide=\"Hector Canvera\"]]\nPoI-11238 (Hector Canvera) is the fifth-richest man in the world and a former member of the now-defunct GoI-005 (Fifth Church). Despite that, it is unknown how aware he is of the larger fifthist phenomenon. He seems only to have a loose awareness of the anomalous and the Veils at large.\n\nCanvera was one of the less affected by the fifthist crisis of faith, leading his techno-cult to survive the crisis. It was still affected by the missing presence of the Starfish. Next to KTE-5503 and PoI-55031 (Pink Lighter) Canvera has become a beacon of hope among ex-fifthists who are not yet ready to give up their faith.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n+++++ The Moon\n\nThe Moon is the flagship project of SCP-8530 and the only apartment complex in the world with no contact with the ground. The entirety of the building hovers more than 100 meters over a supermagnet that is constantly repulsing magnetic material in the building.\n\nSince its inauguration, none of the apartments in the Moon have been sold and it remained unoccupied until its fall.\n\nThe Moon served as further indication of anomalous phenomenon in SCP-8530 as no mechanism exists that would protect the Moon from wind. Despite this, the Moon has remained exactly over the centre of the supermagnet. The lack of strong winds near the Moon is assumed to have been prevented by the logistical anomaly in SCP-8530.\n\nThe Moon is surrounded by a roughly 300 meter dead zone in all directions. The city issues no warning when entering the zone, but it is indicated by the barren and broken concrete field as well as the increasingly dangerous attraction or repulsion of all magnetic material (including water and therefore humans).\n\nThe extreme environmental impact had been well-hidden until the cessation of the logistical anomaly. Including the noticeable effect on all magnetic material in the city, the supermagnet's field disrupted bird flight patterns across the region. Considering the earthquakes experienced by SCP-8530, though more evidence is required, it is possible the magnet might have effected tectonic plates as well.\n\nUnder non-anomalous circumstances keeping the Moon hovering would have required 30% of global electricity output. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n++++ **Audio-Log-8530-B**\n\nWhile SCP-8530-B attributes the success of his city to his talent for planning logistics, most of the city's projects would not have been possible without the cheap workforce hidden away in the city. New workers, mostly from outside Egypt, get lured to the city with the promise of high salaries and stable jobs to be trapped in worker camps off the grid with little food and space provided and a fraction of the promised salary. Their work hours exceed the 8 hours per day allowed per Egyptian labour law.\n\nThe difficulty in locating these camps as well as the opaqueness of their exact purpose has raised the possibility of anomalous activity instead of just illegal business practices. [[[task-forces|MTF Xi-13 \"Sequere Nos\" supported by Eta-77 \"Spheres within Spheres\"]]] have been sent to investigate a worker camp after suspicious activity had been identified by a local contact.\n\nAs the camp was covered in a minor sandstorm upon arrival, only the audio log has been included.

You can build up a resistance to anything. Task Forces especially. We would be maskless with the enemy and the enemy could do nothing against us.

Return to base and give a proper report.\n\n**Tirk:** I'd advise against that. I can give you a report while we're moving.\n\n**Command:** Start with the water breakout.\n\n**Tirk:** The water was the source of the Akiva after all. Or one of them. Had to deal with two false saints in total if you count Mister Idea-stealer. The other one was... she was too far gone. The water stuck to her. It was full of stars. All of it. As were her eyes. Sea and stars. The fifthist signs couldn't be more obvious. So I gave the okay. Septimal shot her.\n\n**Command:** I will mark it on your record.\n\n**Tirk:** //(snorts)// You know the whole \"only good mission without a shot\" thing isn't official policy, right?\n\n**Command:** It is still heavily discouraged.\n\n**Tirk:** Whatever. Didn't think it would kill her anyway, not that I would have complained. Septimal took five shots. Then a sixth. Then a seventh. She blocked the last two.\n\n**Command:** Why?\n\n**Tirk:** Theological disalignment. We haven't figured out why yet, but seven was always a disrupting number for the cult. It would have weakened her if she was a proper fifthist saint, like she seemed to believe.\n\n**Command:** But she still took five hits.\n\n**Tirk:** She staggered at least. The bullets sank in until they hit blood. Then they just vanished. She seemed to mull something over before she and I quote 'expelled your offering from heaven'. I was already under cover when five of my bullets shot out of the water.\n\n**Command:** You had full cover from all water?\n\n**Tirk:** //(laughs)// It wasn't an attack. She just shot them out at random of her uh, probably a random region of space. No, the actual attack came a moment later. A wall of water that sucked in everything it touched. So we ran.\n\n**Command:** You fled the scene?\n\n**Tirk:** Of course not, we wanted to draw her away from the civilians. Only half-worked. One of our cars hit the water. Gone. Probably out there drowning in a wet vacuum of space.\n\n**Command:** Be specific about the events you're describing.\n\n**Tirk:** Oh, I meant that literally. Anyway, we did somewhat draw her attention. She stepped into the water and appeared in front of Apian. From what she said she was really confused on why we would run away from her 'blessing.'\n\n**Command:** What did she say?\n\n**Tirk:** I think we actually have a recording of that, hold on.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Fifthist:** //(further away)// There's a new light. In the starry sea...\n\n**[**A splash.**]**\n\n**Fifthist:** //(directly next to the microphone)// ...It's everywhere.\n\n**Apian:** We've killed your god.\n\n**Fifthist:** Nono, it can't, there's light, why won't you see...\n\n**[**A crunch followed by a scream.**]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Tirk:** That last bit was me breaking her left arm.\n\n**Command:** That stuck?\n\n**Tirk:** Yeah. I figured it was only the blood that shared the water-vanishing act. I figured right. It had the intended effect. She got more erratic. Throwing water at us without much aim. She even took longer to chase us per teleport.\n\n**Command:** Did you try again?\n\n**Tirk:** Not fully. I got a few jabs in, but she had her guard up. Anything further and I would have been in space. With reality bender, and adjacent,  enemies you need to keep the element of surprise. Don't stick to what's working. The jabs only got through because she thought I would break her other arm.\n\n**Command:** What was your next vector of attack?\n\n**Tirk:** The one we had done the entire time. The chase only partly served to get her away from civilians. We just so happened to bring her through wherever Amnestic Gas had been dropped. Lots of it had faded by then, but those areas were far from safe. Eventually she got the memo that something was working on her. And she left.\n\n**Command:** Injuries in your team?\n\n**Tirk:** None. We're trained well. Xi-13 had it harder, going up against one of our own. They subdued Faez at some point. Being immune to Amnestic Gas doesn't make you untouchable. Apparently, Hafez asked for ideas how to get out and one of our agents told him to jump into the water. The false saint followed that instruction.\n\n**Command:** Clarify the term 'false saint' for me.\n\n**Tirk:** Fifthism is dead. And of the two I don't think Hafez even believed in any variation of it. Maybe Canvera's techno-cult, I guess. No, both of them have just been corrupted by the angel, turning their individuality inside-out as some grotesque version of self-validation. I don't think the water fifthist was fully there anymore. Just reduced to a desire for a false paradise. Reduced to her //faith//.\n\n**Command:** Carry on with your report.\n\n**Tirk:** Not that much else to say. Sure, the whole camp was aware of us now, but we'd dealt with anything anomalous. We made quick work of what defence remained. Anyone important has been captured, but I doubt you'll get anything out of them. This was just the quote-unquote living space for their workforce. They might have really just been normal builders for all those megaprojects like that stupid moon.\n\n**Command:** I'll take it the reason you do not want to return to base is the two escaped subjects?\n\n**Tirk:** Yeah. I managed to attach a tracker to the water teleporter with one of my jabs. She's not going anywhere.\n\n**Command:** Permission to pursue subject granted.\n\n= **<End Log>**\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThe tracker first sent a signal in a building belonging to \"Crypto Financing Solutions\" (حلول تمويل التشفير) before jumping to a hospital. As the tracker gave ample opportunity to easily contain PoI-97867 (Teleporting Fifthist) in her sleep, a higher priority was given to Crypto Financing Solutions. Preliminary investigation revealed a connection to Hector Canvera together with \"Architectural Innovation Technologies\" (AI Tech for short).\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n+++++ The Greenhouse Towers\n\n\"The Greenhouse Towers\" was an ecological project to offset the city's carbon footprint. It was planned for the towers to make use of vertical farming in the towers' artificial weather conditions thereby reducing economical and ecological transportation costs of crops into Maladh. It is to be noted that transportation costs were slightly exaggerated in the conception stage.\n\nThe Towers were additionally supposed to produce energy through biogas produced as a byproduct and solar panels using any excess light.\n\nWhile construction was finished, the towers never began to serve their farming purpose. The majority of the Towers stand empty, while a few were filled with exotic plantlife by SCP-8530-A.\n\nFollowing Incident-8530-G, the Greenhouse Towers are now used for their original purpose.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n++++ **After-Action-Report-8530-C**\n\nCaptain Faez was cleared of any remaining compulsions. He recalls neither the events under compulsion nor the idea he had shared with Hafez. All Amnestic Gas was taken away from the team as an additional precaution. The two MTFs were split to deal with both Crypto Financing Solutions and AI Tech simultaneously with 20 Xi-13 members each.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Command:** Agent Tess\n\n**Task Force:**\n\n* Captain Faez (Xi-13)\n * All 40 of the task force's members\n* Captain Tirk (Eta-77)\n * Apian\n * Septimal \n\n**Noteworthy Equipment:** Authority-Class Cognitohazard ID Badges, Foundation Standard Issue Stun Guns, Foundation Standard Issue Rifle\n\n**Language:** Arabic\n\nEvents summarized by Agent Tess\n\n----\n\nThe first anomaly became apparent directly after both teams discreetly entered their respective buildings. The location we picked up was the same for both teams. I ordered them to regroup before any further action was to be taken and they did. The building was swept without much interference.\n\nOnly non-combatants were present at this point. We can assume PoI-97867 (Teleporting Fifthist) warned any person of import of our presence before our arrival. An effort was made by a subgroup of the workface to resist containment. This effort consisted of an attempt to weaponize monitors to display fifthists cognitohazards as well as tactics expected of non-cooperative civilians. As expected these efforts proved to be no hindrance to total containment. I expect no negative consequences, but cognitohazardous screening and decontamination will be added to the post-mission operation as is protocol. \n\nThe encountered workforce can be divided into two groups. The first can be characterized as subjects under the \"idea-stealing\" effect of PoI-20417 (Basem Hafez), working to implement their stolen ideas for one of the two investigated businesses. Very few individuals in this group resisted containment efforts. Post-mission these will be reintegrated into society.\n\nThe second group consists of followers of PoI-11238 (Hector Canvera) and appears to have voluntarily participated in the business. Given the usage of cognitohazards this group will need to be screened for further anomalies and subjected to full deprogramming before reintegrating into society is possible. The Regional Director wanted me to note that unlike the first group this one consisted entirely of Americans. Recovered data suggests 80% of the fled persons of import were likewise American.\n\nThe recovered data was useful. Despite existing in the same space, the first group was oblivious to the spatial anomaly. Both companies were for the most part working contracts for the city, being responsible for some of the planning that went into the city's various megaprojects. I can therefore confirm none of the projects are in themselves anomalous. This becomes a harder distinction to make for future projects which seem to verge into the more esoteric. These plans verge into the nonsensical. Expert Interpreters are required to analyse this data. \n\nThe team additionally recovered data regarding a cryptocurrency-related scheme designed for Canvera to use. Unfortunately some data was damaged in the last third of the mission, but I am confident the Department of Analytics will find a usecase for the information.\n\nThis damage was incured by the only major complication of the mission. PoI-97867 entered the facility. The arm Captain Tirk broke was in a plaster cast, though Agent Septimal was the only one able to spot her. Instead of the direct confrontation of last time she kept her distance from the team and only engaged our MTF unit via her water-manipulating anomaly. The ensuing fight caused the damage of the recovered data. \n\nSimilar to her last appearance, PoI-97867 did not use her anomaly optimally for combat purposes. Captain Faez and Tirk formed a plan. Tirk would distract the PoI while Xi-13 would locate the Fifthist and contain her before she could teleport.\n\nTirk interrogated her on her beliefs and asked how she could align her work with the crisis of faith felt by all fifthists. PoI-97867 seems to escape this contradiction by believing all 'good fifthists' to have already reached heaven, her job simply being to get all the stragglers in. Tirk accused her of being fooled by KTE-5503 and demanded her to reveal its location. PoI-97867 was delighted by this response and began to enclose Captain Tirk in water.\n\nTo stop this effort, Xi-13 revealed itself too early and shot at the PoI. Unfortunately, the PoI was able to escape, together with Tirk.\n\nI will note that Tirk did not resist his enclosure in water. The tracker of the PoI is still active, but we have lost the signal of Captain Tirk. Barring any signs of life I will declare him MIA at the end of the day.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nConcurrently with the above mission the Foundation was contacted by the Global Occult Coalition under the mantle of the two organizations shared efforts against KTE-5503.

This figure, SCP-designation pending, is assumed to be the former Captain Tirk. The figure emerged from a burning row of buildings, flying towards its target. KTE-5503 was impacted three times, each resulting in burning mirror shards falling towards the city followed by the angel reforming, before it could flee the scene completely.\n\nThe riots were clustering into multiple emerging factions. With the Insurgent stopping his pursuit of Xi-13, all remaining MTF members were able to regroup together with the now reachable GOC agents. The employed demomancy and exit protocols made a full evacuation possible.\n\n\nMaladh has been reclassified as Nx-53. The city is considered lost to the Chaos Insurgency.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:advanced-navigation-toolbar-source dual= false\n|styleNum= one\n|prev= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sc-18-005-18-350 |prevtext= Without 5 to guide me\n|prevImage= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-moned-s-icons-and-art/HKIcon.png\n|hub= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tactical-theology-hub |hubtext= I after 5\n|next=  |nexttext= 5 is all around us\n|nextImage= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-moned-s-icons-and-art/HKIcon.png\n]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Maladh.png\n> **Author:** [[*user ethagon]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-8530 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Names:** Approaching Dubai in a (mild) sand storm\n> **Author:** Lars Plougmann\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/3472005154\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
