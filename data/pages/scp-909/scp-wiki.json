No writing materials are to be allowed inside the cell. A short summary of SCP-909's current situation is to be pasted on the wall beside the bed. Extras are to be provided if the previous summary is removed by SCP-909. SCP-909 is to be fed three times daily with any peanut-free meal. If SCP-909 is seen attempting to write or draw, he is to be incapacitated through non-lethal means.\n\nCurrently experimentation with SCP-909's effects has been discontinued, due to risk of containment breach. Research may be conducted if the current Site Director's approval is given.\n\nAs of current regulations on \"Misters\", SCP-909 is to be contained in Hall ██ of Site-██.\n\n**Description:** SCP-909 appears to be a young adult Caucasian male suffering from permanent anterograde amnesia. SCP-909 seems to be aware of his condition but cannot recall experiences past this, aside from memories gained due to SCP-909's effects.\n\nSCP-909's anomalous effects become apparent when it writes down any of the experiences still in its working memory. When described through writing, experiences immediately enter SCP-909's long term memory. However, the experience disappears from the memory of all other persons involved.\n\nSCP-909 is allergic to peanuts and will go into anaphylactic shock following the ingestion of any peanut products.\n\nSCP-909 was discovered at Entrance [EXPUNGED] of Site-██.\n\n**Addendum 909-1:** The words \"Mr. Forgetful, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment\" are tattooed upon SCP-909's right calf. Upon discovery SCP-909 had been wearing a 3-piece suit with the brand name \"Doctor's Orders\" sewn into the tag. Foundation personnel have yet to find a clothing company operating under this name.\n\n**Addendum 909-2:** Further examination of SCP-909's clothing revealed a list of other possible instances of anomalous humanoids similar to SCP-909 (See Document 909-a) inside the left pants pocket.\n\n**Addendum 909-3:** Interview Log\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-909\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. ███████████\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-909 was put into initial observation for seven hours, during which the subject's anterograde amnesia and relation to [[[SCP-905]]] were discovered. SCP-909 was then taken in for interview.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** Good morning, Nine-Oh-Nine.\n> \n> **SCP-909:** Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a doctor of the Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.\n> \n> **SCP-909:** The Foundation? What's that? Why d-\n> \n> NOTE: At this point Dr. ███████████ presses a small button, generating a loud noise lasting 5 seconds. SCP-909 is seen to lose focus.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** Hello, Nine-Oh-Nine.\n> \n> **SCP-909:** Nine-Oh-Nine? Why are you calling me that? And where am I, anyways?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** (Reading from sheet of paper) You are the SCP designated 909, and you are currently under my custody. I am a Doctor of The Foundation, and I am going to research your anomalous effects.\n> \n> **SCP-909:** The Foundation? Wha-\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** Okay, let's try something else. Write down what I just told you.\n> \n> **SCP-909:** Alright. (SCP-909 accepts the pen and stationery and proceeds to write.)\n> \n> NOTE: Later investigation of Dr. ███████████'s notes showed that he had planned to press the button previously mentioned at this point.\n>  \n> **Dr. ███████████:** (Brief pause) Hey, who are you?\n> \n> **SCP-909:** I'm the, uh, SCP under your custody. Don't you remember?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** Huh?\n> \n> **SCP-909:** Don't you remember?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████████:** No. Where am I? What is this place?\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Dr. ███████████ and SCP-909 were removed from the room amid confusion from all personnel involved in the incident. SCP-909 later explained the situation to uninvolved personnel and was placed in his holding cell. Dr. ███████████ was discharged from duty and given a Class-B amnestic.\n\n**Addendum 909-2:** [[collapsible show=\"Document 909-a\" hide=\"- Document 909-a\"]]\n\n> **Wow!** You've just found yourself your very own Little Mister, a limited edition collection from Dr. Wondertainment!\n> \n> Find them all and become Mr. Collector!!\n> \n> [[[SCP-905 | 01.

[[[SCP-905]]] states that it \"lost its copy in the breeze\", [[[SCP-913]]] apparently ingested its own copy. [[[SCP-917]]] had held a similar list which can be found in Document 917-a. [[[SCP-920]]] claims to have misplaced its copy.// - Dr. ███████████\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-908]]] | SCP-909 | [[[SCP-910]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
