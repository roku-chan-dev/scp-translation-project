Pin still attached. $35, obo.\n\nLook, I know it's a grenade, not an \"official\" firework. But anything that blows up can be a firework if you look at it right. Right? Plus, explosions are pretty. Bright fire. Lights, Action, BANG! You get me, right? It's exciting. \n\nBut anywho, here's this thing I got. It's got lots of uses. Decorating a new house? this looks great on a mantel. Or making the mantel go away. Wanna get a new boat? Oops, now you have no boat. TIME TO GET A NEW ONE!\n\nReally it's a great firework. But only once. Also, you can throw it! Maybe launch it? Also, there's probably shrapnel. Looks like it's got shrapnel. These things have shrapnel, right? So yeah, maybe don't throw it. \n\nOR, you can hang it from a tree and pull the pin. Maybe don't do that. Hang it from a tree and tie a string and stand really far away and pull the pin and watch it go boom really loud and half the tree falls over and splashes in the swamp or river with lots of water and fish get scared and fly away. i mean fish don't fly, but\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontainer\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontent\"]]\nHEY, it's GREAT for fishing. Pull the pin an drop it in the water. probably not from a dock, maybe not from the boat you already blew up. but if there's only one and you're fishing with it, the boat is still fine. \n\nSo maybe throw it far from the boat? but throwing isn't a good idea. maybe don't go fishing with it.\n\nAnyway, I have a firework! 35$, obo.\n\n[[>]]\n-Scratch\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"scribble\"]]\nI'm gonna be real mad if someone drops that in my swamp, boyo.
