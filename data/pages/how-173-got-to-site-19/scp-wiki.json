It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile.]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Universe 5643-Gamma-Orange-Delta]]\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-173]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-173 is to be kept in a modified containment chamber at Site-91. Said chamber is to be equipped with a sprinkler system. The sprinkler system is to be activated fortnightly to dispose of waste materials formed in the chamber. If personnel are required to enter SCP-173's chamber, at least 3 personnel are to be present. At least 1 of those individuals must maintain direct visual contact with SCP-173 at all times while inside the chamber. \n> \n> **Description:** SCP-173 is a statue constructed of concrete and reinforcing steel with traces of spray paint. It is animate, although it may only move when no individual observes it visually. When animate, SCP-173 tends to attack surrounding individuals in the vicinity. Common methods of attack include strangulation or snapping one's neck. \n> \n> About once per day, waste materials are spontaneously generated around SCP-173's vicinity. Chemical analysis of waste materials indicates that they are formed from a combination of faeces and blood. The mechanism in which SCP-173 generates waste materials is unknown. \n> \n> SCP-173 was brought into Site-91 on ██/██/2008 CE by Foundation agents. Information of SCP-173 prior to containment by the Foundation is unknown. \n> \n> [...]\n> \n> **Addendum 173-746:** On 04/10/2045 CE, SCP-173 and other SCP objects were transferred from Site-91 to [REDACTED]. See Document 91/04-10-2045 for more information. \n\n------\n\n**__Excerpts recovered from the email account of Dr. James Long__**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 07:30, 06/09/2045 CE\" hide=\"- Relocation of SCPs\"]]\n> FROM: Alexandra Nala, Administrative Assistant, Office of the Overseer Council \n> TO: Dr. James Long, Director, Site-91\n> RE: Relocation of SCPs\n> \n> Greetings, Dr. Long.
