Welcome to Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting!**\n@@ @@\n\nThe Circus is, first and foremost, a show, //THE// show. Those in its employment live to perform, to regale the audiences with their talents. When the circus comes to town, no one quite understands where they came from, or how they managed to put up that tent without anyone seeing it. Officials are baffled by the sudden existence of a bigtop and the associated caravans, trailers and wagons, but strangely enough the paperwork always seems to be in order.\n\nAnd of course, once they attend the show, they lose any misgivings they might have. Because, after all, it **is** the greatest show on earth.\n\nThe circus treats its performers, be they tightrope walkers consisting only of legs, tentacled things that gibber and squeal, or clowns with the tears of a thousand dead stars in their eyes, as valuable assets. The circus is a family, and family stays together.\n\nSo come watch the show, come feel the magic! After all, what do you have to lose? \n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Our line-up]]\n++ Come one, come all...\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"+_herman-fuller -scp -tale\" separate=\"no\" order=\"title asc perPage=\"250]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Little Acts Lost]]\n++ Fabulous Freaks and Human Wonders\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"+scp +herman-fuller +humanoid\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n+++ Now Touring Worldwide!\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-122-de| SCP-122-DE]\n\n++ Other Disquieting Diversions\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"+scp +herman-fuller -humanoid\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tales of the Circus]]\n\n++ 2014 Groups of Interest Contest\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"-173fest -archived -admin -af2016 -author -dread&circuses -sandbox -scp +goi2014 +herman-fuller +tale\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n++ Dread & Circuses Canon\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"-173fest -archived -admin -af2016 -author +dread&circuses -sandbox -scp -goi2014 +herman-fuller +tale\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n++ Other Tales\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"-173fest -archived -admin -af2016 -author -dread&circuses -sandbox -scp -goi2014 +herman-fuller +tale\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n+++ Now Touring Worldwide!\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/des-cercles-dans-le-sable Circles in the Sand]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Information]]\n\n++ On the format\n\nWe've chosen a format that feels natural to a Group of Interest like Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting: circus posters. In addition to those, we've provided you with a template to add pages torn from a fictional book, \"//To the Circus Born: Herman Fuller's Menagerie of Freaks//\" to your article. These pages were and are still being found in libraries all across the world, inserted into circus-themed books of all kinds. These templates will give you a chance to back the visual of the poster with more narrative, and provide substance to the article. You can use the poster with or without the page, and you can use the page on its own.\n\n++ How to create your own Herman Fuller posters\n\nWe've created a component for you that you can use to create a poster of your own with minimal coding. Simply create a page and copy-paste the following code:\n\n> @@[[include component:hf-poster title=[1]|textLeft=[2]|image=[3]|textRight=[4]|textBottom=[5]|textFooter=[6]]]@@\n\nAs you can see, the component takes 6 parameters:\n\n# The title for the poster. Usually the freak's stagename.\n# The text you want left of the image. Use this and the corresponding textRight parameter for short credos intended to attract the attention.\n# The image you want to use. You do **need** an image for this format to work. Old photographs might work, but original artwork would probably be better.\n# The text you want right of the image. \n# The text you want below the image. Use this to expand on the anomaly in narrative.\n# The footer for the poster. You could note things about where the circus is going to be, what the price of admission is, when the show's going to be performed etc.\n\nReplace the bracketed numbers with the values you want to give them. There's a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* You can and should use linebreaks (hit the enter key) in the text you want on the poster; it won't break the component.\n* Your picture needs to be 300 x 425 pixels to fit inside the frame without it being too big or too small.\n* When filling the image parameter, use **the full path to the image** (i.e. start with //@@http://@@//. You can find out the path to your image by clicking 'Files' and then 'Info'\n* You don't need a rating module, the component includes that for you.\n\nFor all your drafting needs this template has also been added to both sandboxes. Be sure to see how the text looks before you create the page on the main wiki.\n\n++ How to create the torn pages:\n\nYou can choose from a left and a right page, with the following codes:\n\n> @@[[include component:hf-book-left chapter=[1]|content=[2]|pagenumber=[3]]]@@\n\nor \n\n> @@[[include component:hf-book-right chapter=[1]|content=[2]|pagenumber=[3]]]@@\n\nThese two components take 3 parameters:\n\n# The chapter title. You'll want to use the freak you're providing more information on.\n# The text for the page. You have about 800 words to use. Preview your work to make sure the page looks good.\n# The number for the page. This is to make sure not every page is number 15 or something. Go wild. Who knows how many pages've been found by now, or how many the book originally had.\n\n++ Resources used\n\n[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/EastMarket EastMarket font, free from Font Squirrel], used for the text of the poster.\n[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya Alegreya font, free from Font Squirrel], used for the text of the book pages.\n[http://www.dafont.com/romantiques.font Romantiques font, free from Dafont.com], used in the header.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Herman-Fuller-background-new.png\n> **Author:** [[*user JackalRelated]], Pink Sherbet Photography, Ortega y Frías, Ramón\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** SCP Foundation Wiki\n> **Derivative of:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Free_antique_damaged_wrinkled_stained_book_inside_cover_texture_for_layers_(2986258435).jpg|Wikimedia]]] (Pink Sherbet Photography), [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Free_dark_vintage_paper_page_texture_for_layers_(2982207584).jpg|Wikimedia]]] (Pink Sherbert Photography), and [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/internetarchivebookimages/14590934239/|Flickr]]] (Ortega y Frías, Ramón)\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
