Your skepticism is warranted, but please hear me in earnest.\n\n= //<O5-8 nods.>//\n\n**Dir. Genevieve:** I direct the Essophysics Department, which you all well know is concerned with //embodiments// -- manifestations of concepts within reality. An //embodiment// of the concept \"[*/scp-6996 red]\" would carry all of the characteristics conceptually associated with that color, such as being angry, or desirable, or malevolent. This is a simplified method of conceptualizing what's actually going on here; a tangible object or entity //embodies// a memetic structure within the Nöosphere by conforming to its idealistic ideatic shape.\n\n= //<PHMD nods along. O5-8 and Dir. Gears share a glance of confusion.>//\n\n**Dir. Genevieve:** Simply put, an //embodiment// is a physical item that's shaped like an idea. And, given the progression of human intelligence and development, over time, that shape can change. This means that, if the essophysical nature of an entity is not readily apparent, it can be discerned by comparing that entity's change over time to changes in human conception and ideatic space; a correlation almost certainly indicates causation.\n\n**Dir. Gears:** So, I'm assuming your Department has observed such a correlation in [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]'s case.\n\n**Dir.

Strenuous research and cross-examination of [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]'s interactions and resultant [[span class=\"no\"]]███████████[[/span]] have motivated the Essophysics Department to attempt a new approach to the project:  the creation of an Anomalous weapon with the express purpose of tangibly and conceptually purging [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]] from reality.\n\n----\n\n**METHOD:** To ensure access to ample administrative and computational resources, as well as secrecy from relevant groups of interest, the weapon (provisionally designated AO-6820) is to be housed beneath Secure Administration Site-01. This entails the excavation of over fifty million cubic meters of earth (as expedited by Anomalous technologies), which is planned to take place over an eight-month period. Once excavated, this chamber (ANTIKILL Facility A) will house the various mechanisms required for AO-6820's operation, including:\n\n[[div class=\"accessibility-invert\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/this-page-intentionally-left-blank/AKF-A.svg\n|caption=Proposed layout for AKF-A.\n|width=320px\n|align=right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**SECTION A:** Central Computing Node\n\nThe central computing node will house a complex self-iterative neural network with two main functions: pattern-recognition and reality manipulation. This artificial intelligence is to be fed all records of [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]'s [[span class=\"no\"]]███████████ ████████[[/span]] and termination attempts as training data; the network will be conditioned to map a target quantum informational structure corresponding to the conceptual reduction of [[span class=\"no\"]]███ ███████[[/span]]. Upon AO-6820's activation, the node will act as an \"ontokinetic webcrawler\", interfacing with Section B to scrub all instances of [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]'s conceptual structure from consensus reality.\n\n**SECTION B:** Placeholder-Gears Ontokinetic Sink\n\nThe PH-GOS is designed as an enormous reality-anchoring mechanism and ontokinetic interface; it is to read the sum quantum informational content of the universe and encode it into a readable format, thereby allowing other systems to read and react to the entire state of reality. The PH-GOS can and will be piloted to enact localized reality-restructuring events, directly editing the narrative-space-time continuum based on its source data. As such, it will interface with the central node to ensure the indefinite non-existence of [[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]]-[[span class=\"no\"]]███[[/span]].\n\n**SECTION C:** [[span class=\"no\"]]███████████ ██████[[/span]]\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\n**SECTION D:** Secondary Computing\n\nAdditional server capacity for secondary functions.

This suggests that the item may have been a conceptual entity, which would contradict numerous (heavily corrupted) logs of termination attempts implying its existence as a physical entity (eg. frequent use of the term \"body mass\").\n\nFurthermore, internal inspection of SCP-6820's central computing node has allowed partial mapping of the data arrangement it has been trained to eliminate. Analysis by the Department of Xenobiology confirms that this pattern describes a unique genetic sequence presenting composite features of kingdoms //Animalia//, //Plantae// and //Fungi//, as well as several embedded non-organic structures, with its most prominent structures closely resembling the class //Reptilia//.\n\nImmediately following the publishing of this analysis, a localized reality-restructuring event occurred; AKF-A-C no longer exists, nor does any record of what it may have been. Given that there is currently no clear point of human entry to SCP-6820, and that personnel must have entered (and recall entering) its central node for internal analysis, it is hypothesized that Section C was some form of staff access to the chamber. The reasons for its erasure remain unclear.\n\n----\n\n* motives for neutralization and excessive resources spent\n\nThe Foundation operates on strict protocols, one of which is to contain, not eradicate, the Anomalous. Decommissioning is a practice reserved for those scenarios in which it is either absolutely necessary or presents no ethical quandaries. Our persistence in pursuit of Project ANTIKILL is not only uncharacteristic but indicates that SCP-6820-A was a prime threat to the directives of the Foundation as more resources had been dedicated to it than any other individual Anomaly (or other item); a vast and apparent majority of these funds were spent in termination attempts.\n\nAnd, yet, there is no evidence to suggest that the subject's threat was impending — in fact, the continuance of Project ANTIKILL over most of the past century suggests that, if it had posed existential and/or organizational threats, they could not have yet occurred before its erasure. Alternatively, it is possible that SCP-6820-A possessed a sort of memetic or otherwise compulsory effect that influenced Foundation personnel to neutralize the item, though that such a drastic effect was able to remain undetected for several decades is unlikely.\n\n----\n\n* motives for unconditional and universal hatred of SCP-6820-A\n\n= [[span class=\"bt\"]]INCONCLUSIVE[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n**NOTES:** As former Project ANTIKILL Director, I feel obligated to share my anecdotal experience regarding this deeply confusing situation.\n\nTo be clear: I retain all memories of //working on the project//, insofar as I can discern. I have grown rather accustomed to horrifying phenomena over my lengthy tenure with the Foundation, yet I distinctly recall an intense reaction to... //something//, on levels both administrative and personal. I recall my presence and involvement in drafting relevant documents, submitting and approving termination attempt requests, organizing increasingly involved projects, and yet, I know not the //content// of these events; hardly any information which would distinguish SCP-6820-A from any other item or entity has persisted, and none of it is in my head.\n\nStrikingly, all I can recall of the subject is my emotional relationship to it, which is apparently shared by all other ANTIKILL personnel: SCP-6820-A was universally perceived as loathsome, directly prejudicial to life, and \"disgusting\". Whatever it was, I detested it, as did my peers and, as it seems, all whom it came into contact with. Despite its erasure, these feelings have not dissipated, nor have I felt satisfaction in our \"defeat\" of SCP-6820-A.\n\nInstead, I am wary that we have been manipulated -- it is entirely possible that SCP-6820 brought itself into existence, along with all related memories, during its initial reality-restructuring event, and manufactured the supposed existence (and subsequent non-existence) of SCP-6820-A to distract us. It appears to have erased the access shaft to its chamber, limiting research and investigation of its components, immediately following the publishing of information vital to the nature of SCP-6820-A. This could be excused as it fulfilling its function, keeping SCP-6820-A excluded from the Nöosphere -- though, the fact that our research is still intact is contradictory to this. Given that our dedication to such a project as ANTIKILL does not \"add up\", as it were, I am inclined to believe that we cannot trust the intelligent, omniscient, omnipotent paraweapon beneath the Foundation's central administrative facilities.\n\nRecommending immediate decommissioning of SCP-6820, by any means necessary.\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]**END ADDENDUM**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"tableb table5\"]]\n[[div class=\"widetable\"]]\n||~ [[size 175%]]FILE 2/2[[/size]] ||\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|containment-class= thaumiel\n|containment-image= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5382/thaumiel-icon-2.svg\n|containment-color= 0, 135, 189\n|inc-esoteric-layout = --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"anom-bar-esoteric\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= SCP-6820\n|clearance= 6\n|container-class= thaumiel\n|secondary-class= apollyon\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-5618-offset-0/apollyon-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= amida\n|risk-class= critical\n]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|containment-class= thaumiel\n|containment-color= 0, 135, 189\n|secondary-class= apollyon\n|secondary-color= 196, 2, 51\n|inc-split-color= --]]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width: 440px; margin-top: 12px;\"]]\n[[html]]\n<video style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%;\" autoplay muted loop>\n<source src=\"https://i.imgur.com/smvXny9.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width: 440px;\"]]\nPH-GOS, Mk.

At this time, no means available to the Foundation are capable of deactivating or otherwise impeding SCP-6820, able only to cause temporary structural damage. The newly-founded [[span class=\"bt\"]]Project OVERKILL[[/span]], staffed with personnel from the deprecated Project ANTIKILL, is tasked with oversight and exploration of any and all attempts to neutralize the Anomaly; virtually unlimited resources have been made available by Administration to this end. Knowledge of [[span class=\"bt\"]]Project OVERKILL[[/span]] must be restricted to solely necessary personnel to inhibit its intersection with the Nöosphere.\n\nIn an attempt to limit the Anomaly's area of ontokinetic effect, an array of thirteen PH-GOS units have been situated outside Antikill Facility A. To properly counteract SCP-6820 Section B, this array is to be maintained with extreme vigilance; an assigned sub-team of OVERKILL personnel is to enact immediate hardware and/or software repairs and adjustments as necessary. All malfunctions or other manipulations to the Sinks must be thoroughly documented, and all relevant documents to SCP-6820 and/or Projects ANTIKILL and OVERKILL are to be uploaded to Extra-Universal Backup Mechanism Delta to avoid further risk of information loss. Any and all possible improvements to reality-anchoring technologies are to be secondarily explored as, without such, **SCP-6820's central systems are predicted to mutate to uncontainable status within __a maximum of eighteen weeks__.**\n\nShould a majority of the Sinks simultaneously reach critical and/or non-functional status, AKF-A and all in-progress termination efforts must be immediately abandoned to avoid provoking (or suffering the effects of) its [[span class=\"bt st\"]]RAGE-STATE[[/span]].[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]suffer[[/span]] Subsequently, all fluid transport valves are to be redirected to flood the central computing node with hydrochloric acid until its primary computing systems are submerged and incapacitated.

Its computing capacity exceeds that of the human brain, entailing that it is stored partially outside the Nöosphere;[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The set of ideas which humans are capable of having; human thought-space.[[/span]] this has resulted in its partial corruption by SCP-6820-A.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6820/682meme.jpg\n|caption=SCP-6820-A memeplex visualization, largest human-comprehensible cross-section.\n|width=400px\n|align=right]]\n\nSCP-6820-A is an extremely dense thought; more specifically, it is a hate-centric hyper-logical memeplex that can be roughly described as \"the difference between life and death.\" Even more specifically, SCP-6820-A is an extremely precise and accurate description of what it means for any arrangement of particles to be defined as \"alive\" and, complementarily, as \"dead\" or \"inanimate\". Its memeplex contains several smaller concepts within its description, including, but not limited to:\n\n* a theoretical process for large-scale localized entropy inversion;\n* the particular physical properties of hatred;\n* the molecular structure of hydrochloric acid;\n* the quality of \"adaptiveness\";\n* the state of being \"vaguely-reptilian.\"\n\nSCP-6820-A occupied an essophysical embodiment within physical reality for much of known history, remaining interminable (as it was neither alive nor dead) until its eradication from the Nöosphere upon activation of SCP-6820. Since this event, the weapon's central core has advanced such that its \"mental\" capacity far exceeds humans', thereby becoming subject to foreign ideatic predators such as SCP-6820-A.\n\nThe entity's conceptual fabric is highly adaptive and mutates rapidly, creating significant computational stresses on SCP-6820; left unchecked, it induces a vulnerable state during which it can corrupt the hyper-ideatic portions of its intelligence. During these occurances, the central node transmits a \"[[span class=\"bt st\"]]RAGE-STATE EVENT[[/span]]\"[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]despair[[/span]] error, and engages in localized reality-restructuring operations which are both highly adaptive and directly prejudicial to life.

Section A's surface panels begin to flutter as movement is detected within its central core; moments later, a lower panel opens outward, revealing an organized force of tall, malformed, pale-skinned humanoid creatures in orange jumpsuits. They march out of the central node, each carrying various tools and supplies, and begin to weld a massive insignia to its camera-facing side, displaying no intent of caution or self-preservation.\n\nUpon completion, extraneous humanoids return to the core's interior; the insignia is discovered to be another SCP-2140-1 instance, one which has never been seen by any member of the Foundation as all personnel who observe it are verifiably civilians. Analysis by cognito-resistant language processing systems reveals the insignia's inclusion of archaic Daevite script, translating roughly to \"one who sees\".[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]invariable[[/span]]\n\n**RESULT:** Previously-unavailable sections of SCP-6820's metadata files have now become visible, corroborating various other documents' assertion that it occupies, and has always occupied, the position of O5-8 within the Foundation. A civilian scientist was later discovered within Secure Administration Site-01 in possession of a blank E-Class (Clearance Level 0) ID card; the trespasser has been amnesticized and reintegrated into the public.\n\n----\n\n**INTENTION:** Upload a verbal description of [*/scp-2521 ●●|●●●●●|●●|●] to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby introducing an infohazardous trigger to disable its internal components.\n\n**INTERACTION:** Following over sixty hours of decryption efforts, sufficient access to central node is regained and infohazardous data is uploaded successfully. Thirty seconds later, a dark cloud begins emanating from the core's poles, slowly growing to envelop the spheroid; several vaguely-reptilian vocalizations are detected within, alongside audio disruptions consistent with ●●|●●●●●|●●|●'s effects. SCP-6820 returns a [[span class=\"bt st\"]]RAGE-STATE EVENT[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]vain[[/span]] error, remaining unresponsive for approximately four hours. During this period, four PH-GOS units become wrapped in black tentacle-like protrusions which pull them several meters into the ground, destroying nearby systems. These protrusions dissipate upon ejection of ●●|●●●●●|●●|● from the central node; several black ribbon-like fibers are observed hanging from its figure before it demanifests.\n\n**RESULT:** SCP-6820-A now exhibits increased ontokinetic and memetic influence over media in which it is described verbally, corrupting document metadata by addition of footnotes and highlighting of self-supplementary ideatic structures. Manifestation of ectoentropic appendages has not recurred.\n\n----\n\n**INTENTION:** Manipulate SCP-6820-A via semantic interaction with a variable abstract-metaphysical concept pointer ([*/scp-2719 SCP-2719]), thereby forcing it to exit SCP-6820. To this end, the Anti-Nöosphere has been defined as the set of all thoughts which humans are incapable of conceiving.\n\n**INTERACTION:**\n\n||~ POINTER ||~ OUTCOME ||\n|| SCP-6820 || Became inside. ||\n|| SCP-6820-A || Went inside. ||\n|| Anti-Nöosphere || Became inside. ||\n|| SCP-6820-A || Went further inside. ||\n|| SCP-6820-A || Went further inside. ||\n|| SCP-6820-A || Found \"Inside\". ||\n|| Inside || [[span class=\"bt st\"]]OUTSIDE[[/span]].[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]unwelcome[[/span]] ||\n\n**RESULT:** SCP-6820's central computing node has been turned inside-out, its internal components now external and exposed to AKF-A. The contents within the node elude human conception. Inside traumatized.\n\n----\n\n**INTENTION:** Consult a non-conscripted AI system ([*/scp-079 SCP-079]) for assistance in termination of SCP-6820. Data salvaged from corrupted documents conveys some form of relationship between SCP-079 and the pre-erasure form of SCP-6820-A.\n\n**INTERACTION:** SCP-079 is provided access to both current and outdated SCP-6820 documentation, alongside significant computational resources via external hard drive. The intelligence confirms its understanding of the circumstances' severity and promptly provides a complex counter-algorithm to SCP-6820, emphasizing its lethality to humans and advising it remain unobserved. The counter-algorithm is applied across the accessible Sections of AKF-A according to strictly timed specifications, resulting in the deactivation of all components excepting the reactor and central node.\n\nThe node remains dormant for sixteen minutes before inducing a spontaneous Site-wide electromagnetic outage, terminating three augmented administrative personnel. The event lasts one hour, after which all systems regain function.\n\n**RESULT:** AKF-A has been entirely restructured; while its arrangement and components remain intact, all external surfaces have been plated with a theoretically impossible tungsten-diamond alloy, while most internal conduits and superconductors have been exchanged with beryllium-bronze counterparts. Despite a lack of non-white light sources, the chamber's interior is universally perceived as the color [[span class=\"bt st\"]]HATEFUL[[/span]].[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]reunion[[/span]]\n\n----\n\n**INTENTION:** Introduce a viral para-organism ([*/scp-217 SCP-217]) to SCP-6820's central computing node, thereby incapacitating possible biological elements within.\n\n**INTERACTION:** In the midst of a spontaneous [[span class=\"bt st\"]]RAGE-STATE[[/span]], SCP-6820's hydrochloric acid solution is treated with SCP-217 before voiding into Section A. The virus reacts immediately with trace organic material embedded within the node's internal atmosphere, beginning to form macro-structures when internal surveillance is lost. External cameras remain active as, twenty-two minutes later, a cloud of reflective particles emerges from the node's west entry port. These particles, found later to be silicon-protein nanobots, arrange themselves into an enormous gear mechanism surrounding the sphere's equator.\n\n**RESULT:** The node's upper and lower hemispheres now rotate independently and periodically, producing sounds of clockwork machinery. **GoI-004** operatives (including followers of Orthodox Cogwork, the United Church, the Church of Maxwellism, the [*/scp-6217 Sanctuary of the Holistic], and [*/scp-4485 HANSARP]) have gained inexplicable knowledge of SCP-6820's location, and have waged holy war on the Foundation in the name of [[span class=\"bt\"]]{{WAN}}[[/span]].[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]unbroken[[/span]]\n\n----\n\n**INTENTION:** Utilize an insurmountable omnikinetic[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**omnikinetic:** A catch-all term used to describe anomalies which are able to enact a combination of semiontological, ontokinetic, and semiokinetic reality manipulation simultaneously.[[/span]] force ([*/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal SCP-001-KATE]) in order to summarily wipe SCP-6820 from existence.\n\n**INTERACTION:** The following text was inputted into the safeguarded SCP-001-KATE database file:\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n{{AKF-A, SCP-6820, and SCP-6820-A will immediately and entirely be removed from existence upon the saving of this document. The area physically occupied by AKF-A and SCP-6820 will be filled with the material that was excavated from it.}}\n[[/div]]\n\nThe file was then saved.\n\n**RESULT:** Following the file's saving, Sections C through H of AKF-A were violently and haphazardly replaced with soil. Embedded hyperdense support beams and metal frameworking used for prior efforts instantly bent and collapsed under the severe pressure, causing significant structural damage to subterranean portions of Administration Site-01. Absolutely no discernable change was observed within Sections A and B, as well as to SCP-6820 itself, after the former two structures were forcefully entered via excavation machinery.\n\nSubsequent molecular analysis revealed trace amounts of mineral deposits and organic compounds amid the chamber's constituent atoms. The SCP-001-KATE file was then found to be vacant from the Site-01 DEEPWELL archive, and associated backup archives; such a file has purportedly never been in circulation.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon lizard\"]]abhorrent[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"jotting tableb table5\"]]\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]ADDENDUM 6820.V:[[/span]] Emergency Conference\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nVIDEO TRANSCRIPT OVERKILL/13\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**DATE:** 2022/01/07\n\n**PARTIES PRESENT:**\n\n* Partial Overseer Council (O5-3, [[span class=\"no\"]]O5-7[[/span]], [[span class=\"no\"]]O5-10[[/span]], [[span class=\"no\"]]O5-12[[/span]])\n* Project Director C.
