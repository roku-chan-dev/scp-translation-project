What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[thaumiel|Project Thaumiel]]]\n* [[[Numerus]]]\n* [[[Flos]]]\n* [[[Illac]]]\n* [[[Umbra]]]\n* [[[Capitis]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[Fault Lines]]] and the Gulf canon\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Agent John Doe dabbed at his forehead with a napkin. The humidity of [[[the Gulf]]] was the worst part of his work, seeping into his pores and between his clothes and blanketing the surface in a hellish tactile haze. Well, that and the alligators, and the swampland anomalies, and the apparent holy war between every other church. Throw it on the pile of \"worst parts\".//\n\n//Really, he should have been putting on a stiff upper-lip, take the damp heat like a champ and rep his brand responsibly. Appearance was everything. Part of the code. 'Bless your heart's and 'southern hospitality's. SUSEOCT code.//\n\n//John dabbed at his forehead again.//\n\n//He'd be meeting with an MC&D rep. Needed to be better at this. When the CIA meets with an oil tycoon, they're dressed their best once it's behind closed doors, right? Not fidgeting like a monkey in a suit, like a cancer-struck dad at the doctors whose wife's delivery and CAT scans got scheduled for the same day. Diplomacy was a sport, one with a dress code and an expectation of politeness from gold medal to laughingstock. Like any sport, you trained and trained, for the sport and the motions and the proceedings of the before, game, and after.//\n\n//Metal on concrete. Someone had taken the opposite seat from him.//\n\n//John looked up, only to see Max Mustermann, representative of the Gulf branch of Marshall, Carter, & Dark LLC., fidgeting in his seat as he dabbed at his forehead with a napkin.//\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write an article set in the Gulf canon. **Contest entries will //not// be featured.**\n* **For artists:** Draw a scene from the Gulf. **Likewise.**",
