Following Incident-6324, the track is to be surrounded by a reinforced wall capable of withstanding an impact from SCP-6324. SCP-6324 has been equipped with a GPS tracker and internal cameras so that it may be located in the event that it is taken from Site-37.\n\nIndividuals affected by SCP-6324-1 are to be given standard evaluation for mind-affecting anomalies. However, since SCP-6324-1 is a particularly subtle anomaly, no amnesticization is required.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6324 is a 1987 █████ brand station wagon. It has continued functioning since its creation seemingly without repair, despite natural erosion. Any individual parts of SCP-6324 may break or wear down, but none of these ultimately impair its ability to function.\n\nWhenever two individuals are within SCP-6324 and it is driven for over thirty minutes, an instance of SCP-6324-1 begins. During an SCP-6324-1 instance, SCP-6324 displays driving capabilities far beyond the usual of any other similar model of vehicle. These abilities include: increased acceleration and braking power, the ability to make impossibly sharp turns, and increased durability to the point of near indestructibility.\n\nIndividuals inside of SCP-6324 during an SCP-6324-1 instance will tend to show certain changes to their personalities. Including, but not limited to: poor impulse control, a strong desire to seek out new experiences, and an increase to any existing behavioral differences between them. Most of these effects end once the SCP-6324-1 event completes. The one exception being an increased bond between the affected individuals. This connection occurs despite any existing animosity they may have had. The two will begin to address each other as if they are close friends. Even when informed of SCP-6324’s nature, they will be unable to identify the relationship as anomalous, instead attributing it to having a significant shared experience during SCP-6324-1.\n\n**Incident-6324:** On 25/06/2019, a test of SCP-6324 was conducted using D-927491 and D-391848. Due to a containment breach, the test was abandoned and most personnel were called away. However, after D-391848 was taken inside, D-927491 used this as an opportunity to escape, kidnapping Researcher Franklin White as a hostage and stealing the equipment from a nearby guard. The following are audio and video logs from the cameras inside SCP-6324.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Log-6324-1\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Researcher White:** I spy with my little eye, something that starts with the letter… R.\n\n**D-927491:** Road.\n\n**Researcher White:** Yep!

Why?\n\n**D-927491:** You think I like being called this? It’s a stupid letter and number. I didn’t get a choice in any of this.\n\n**Researcher White:** Did you have a choice in your other name?\n\n**D-927491:** Not the point and you know it.\n\n**Researcher White:** Fine, what should I call you?\n\n**D-927491:** My name’s Abigail\n\n**Researcher White:** Okay.

Do you seriously have no better plan? You realize that we’ll have to stop eventually, right?\n\n**D-927491:** I’ve got a plan. I know a guy. Good at smuggling and owes me a favor. If anyone can keep us away from the Foundation, it’s him.\n\n**Researcher White:** Clever. So what’s the guys name? Two-Toes Tommy? Jimmy the Weasel? Maybe it’s something short, like “Spike”. I like Spike.\n\n**D-927491:** His name’s Edward. You watch too many movies.\n\n**Researcher White:** Well excuse me for not knowing about the criminal underworld. I guess I’m not cultured enough for this.\n\n**D-927491:** Are you mocking me?\n\n**Researcher White:** Maybe.\n\n**D-927491:** Glass houses.\n\n**Researcher White:** What’s that supposed to mean?

We couldn’t take down that sign, so we had to get a little creative.\n\n**D-927491:** So is there a gas station ahead or not?\n\n**Researcher White:** Don’t remember. We have to go, please? Please?\n\n**D-927491:** Have you forgotten that we’re on the run?\n\n**Researcher White:** Oh, it won’t be long. And you haven’t lived until you’ve seen that twine. It’s both there and not there, sort of prismatic, and always twitching. Just an all around drug trip.\n\n**D-927491:** Like you know what a drug trip feels like.\n\n**Researcher White:** You don’t know everything about me. It’s that exit up there.\n\n**D-927491:** There’s no exit.\n\n**Researcher White:** Right. Antimemetics.

Just enjoy it! You’re one of the only people who’s going to experience the best roadside attraction on Earth!\n\n**D-927491:** You sound like a tour guide right now.\n\n**Researcher White:** Well, I did work at the research outpost here a while ago. So I know the ins and outs.\n\n//SCP-6324 stops.//\n\n**D-927491:** Research outpost?\n\n**Researcher White:** Yeah, we were researching wherever the ball came from. I think it’s a portal to another dimension.\n\n**D-927491:** I’m not walking into a Foundation lair!\n\n**Researcher White:** Relax, those guys are a bunch of lazy deadbeats. When I worked there, half the time was throwing things into the portal to see what would happen. The other half was making up lab reports.[[footnote]] Soon after Researcher White left the SCP-████ research outpost, a series of disciplinary investigations were carried out. Eventually resulting in the firing and replacement of many active researchers. [[/footnote]] Did you know that you can just redact half a paper?[[footnote]] This is not to be taken as actual advice. [[/footnote]] No one notices![[footnote]] They notice. [[/footnote]]\n\n**D-927491:** Interesting. And how do I know you aren’t leading me into a trap?\n\n**Researcher White:** You don’t. But do you really want to miss this once in a lifetime experience?\n\n//D-927491 sighs and SCP-6324 starts moving again.//\n\n**D-927491:** Now you really sound like a tour guide.\n\n**Researcher White:** Perfect! //(In a tour guide voice)// Coming up on the right, you should see the World’s Weirdest Ball of Twine!

Only the finest unpainted brick walls.\n\n**D-927491:** Doesn’t look much like an “attraction”.\n\n**Researcher White:** Yeah, the Foundation tends to do that to places. Trust me, it’s way cooler on the inside.\n\n**D-927491:** It better be, because I’m taking a pretty big risk here.\n\n**Researcher White:** It’ll be safe, I promise.\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Log-6324-3\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<Begin Log>** \n\n//D-927491 and Researcher White are running from the research outpost around SCP-████, “The World’s Weirdest Ball of Twine”, chased by armed Foundation agents.//\n\n**D-927491:** I thought it was going to be safe!\n\n**Researcher White:** I don’t know!

Why is it coming after us?\n\n**Researcher White:** I’m pretty sure it came from the twine. Maybe the ball wasn’t an attraction at all. Some kind of egg?\n\n**D-927491:** But why us?

Why didn’t you tell me we were being tracked!\n\n**Researcher White:** You never asked.\n\n**D-927491:** So that’s how they found us?\n\n**Researcher White:** That, and we were followed by Rainbow Mothra.\n\n**POI-740176:** Rainbow Mothra?\n\n**D-927491:** Don’t ask. So where is this “equipment”?\n\n**Researcher White:** Oh, it’s right over here. //(To POI-740176)// So, Rainbow Mothra is my name for this big monster that was following us—\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum:** SCP-6324 was recovered outside the house of POI-740176 (Edward “Spike” Summers). He, POI-740177 (Abigail Beckett), and POI-740178 (Franklin White) have yet to be found. A type two watch has been placed on them. They are not considered hazardous, but they pose a potential risk to the veil if left alone.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6323]]] | SCP-6324 | [[[SCP-6325]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
