At no time should two or more instances be kept in the same locker.\n\nSCP-6604-3 is to be kept in Site-19 Reserved Anomalous Items (RAI) locker No. 4344, along with instances SCP-6604-3-1 through -3-19. SCP-6604-5 instances must be kept in Site-17's Primary Replicas Locker.\n\nAll SCP-6604 instance usage and testing must be approved by Level-3 or Level-4 administrative command before proceeding. --SCP-6604-3 and three (or fewer) instances of SCP-6604-5 are to be provided to the subject upon request during interviewing processes and passive communication periods between SCP-6604 instances and Foundation staff.--\n\n**Description:** SCP-6604 is a blanket designation given to five conjoining items/item duplicates:\n* SCP-6604-1 -- A fedora made of porcelain-white wool felt with a black sleeve at the base. Aside from assisting the Ekurcho Rho process, this item has no known anomalous abilities.\n* SCP-6604-2 -- A Colt.45 Model 1911 semi-automatic pistol with unusual engravings and cache wood handle plates.\n* SCP-6604-3 -- An unusual cigar humidor engraved with unintelligible text thought to be written in Latin and containing 19 regular Havana-imported Hav-A-Tampa cigars labeled \"1\" through \"19.\" --None of the cigars, nor the humidor, have been tested.-- //There are no known anomalous abilities in the cigars or the container humidor.//\n* SCP-6604-4 -- An externally regular onyx-colored overcoat set with a diamond-platinum stickpin in the shape of an unidentified four-legged animal. This overcoat has no outright anomalous effects, but it is assumed to keep the wearer perfectly thermally insulated.\n* SCP-6604-5 -- 44 (recovered/known) gold-rimmed crystal drinking glasses, numbered \"1\" through \"44,\" with overlay white flora designs. Brief testing revealed that these drinking glasses cannot shatter.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=flickr:52070745087\n| caption=SCP-6604.\n| width=300px\n]]\n\nWhen instances SCP-6604-1, -4, and any other instances are placed within a 13-meter radius with no physical barricades on their horizontal plane, the objects --become post-positively buoyant-- //levitate//. Over the course of four seconds, the objects will align to create the appearance of a transparent, mildly overweight adult male standing 1.8 meters tall. The elapse of this process is known as Ekurcho Rho. SCP-6604 is the name given to the sentient coalition of SCP-6604 instances.\n\nThis group of instances is capable of human speech, which is delivered in a proper-English, Broolynese accent. Although preliminary testing indicates that the figure presented is not tangible, the tethered SCP-6604 instances appear to act in unison.\n\n**History:** From 1920 to 1933, Alphonse (Al) Capone's Chicago Outfit provided a predetermined, though unknown, amount of alcoholic substances such as beer and wine to staff and management at local SCP Foundation facilities in exchange for legal assurance and partial legal immunity. During this time, the Chicago Outfit aided the Foundation's growing efforts by reporting anomalies discovered by the criminal organization to Foundation staff. --Though unconfirmed, it is speculated that during this time, Capone would keep anomalous objects discovered for himself before turning them in to Foundation hands due to the effects instilled within the SCP-6604 instances.-- //As confirmed by recorded confession, Capone would acquire and preserve undesignated anomalies for himself during his partnership with the SCP Foundation.// The anomalies used to improve Capone's items, which are now SCP-6604 instances, are unknown.\n\nAllegations of anomaly smuggling were leveled against the Chicago Outfit in 1930-1931. During this time, relations between the parties deteriorated exponentially, with increased hostility occurring during alcohol transactions. During a transaction delivery (ID:445f) in December 1931, Capone ordered a metal bat from an accompanying accomplice and proceeded to strike Proceedings Manager Karl Philipson. The strike made direct contact with the temple, resulting in an immediate hemorrhage stroke. Capone allegedly continued to beat the individual until he died from cardiac arrest. As a result of this occurrence, the Foundation revoked its legal guarantee to the Chicago outfits.\n\nAlthough unconfirmed, it is suggested that agents working for the SCP Foundation notified the Internal Revenue Service of Capone's unknown tax evasion practices. Regardless, Capone was arrested in May 1932 for 22 counts of tax evasion.\n\nCapone died on Palm Island in early 1947, eight years after his 11-year incarceration, of unknown* causes. \"Fine Della Strada,\" a plan to assassinate Capone with ricin-implanted cigars, was launched as a result of Capone being suspected of leaking Foundation information to outsiders. Following Capone's assassination, the Foundation Concealment Department falsified medical records and testimonies to suggest a history of untreated syphilis.\n\n**Incident Preliminary:**  (08/19/85) Interview between Researcher Ricky Burkswood and SCP-6604.

Burkswood sits parallel to the subject.##\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Hey there.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Hey.\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood reaches out his hand.##\n\n**Burkswood:** \"How does this work? Can people not touch you and you can touch them or what?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Your tie is- well- tied wrong..\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Oh, oh my god, it is. That's embarrassing.\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood adjusts his tie, reaching his hand back out. SCP-6604's arm lifts and appears to shake Burkswood's hand.##\n\n**Burkswood:** \"That feels so odd. It's like- like when you touch a part of your body that's numb and your numb part can't feel anything but your finger can feel it. You know that feeling?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Uhm. No. Is there a reason I was assembled?\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Of course. I have them right-\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood reaches into his pocket and pulls out a folded paper.##\n\n**Burkswood:** \"-here. Firstly, we- I- we are interested in understanding how y'know- you got your abilities.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Gonna have to be more specific than that, compagno. As far as I'm concerned, I should be dead.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"According to your records, your family reported your anomalous properties in the 60s. However, we're sure you attained these abilities prior to your death. Maybe you even- uh- smuggled anomalies and tested them out yourself.\"\n\n##grey|SCP-6604 laughs briefly.##\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"What? Like some mom-and-pop Foundation? Give me a break.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Well these accusations have stood against you since before your death.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"You accusing me of breaking my alliance with the Foundation, tough guy?\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"What! No, sir- I mean- SCP-6604- we just don't have an answer as to your anomalous properties and considering you had connections with the Foundation and y'know sketchy practices- it was just accused and nobody disproved it.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"What do you mean sketchy practices, ay? I done nothin'!\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"I'm just saying you had- uh- were pretty notorious for being kinda untrustworthy with the Valentine's Day Massacre and your battings and-\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Ay! Where's your evidence, Wayne Wheeler? I never did none of that stuff. My only crime was being too good at my job. And that's providing the US citizens a valuable commodity.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Sure, of course.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"This isn't going anywhere.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"I'm sorry, sir- I mean- uh- yeah-\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"You know what, I'll cut you off right there. This rooms taping system is down so you can stop playing dress-up.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Ah.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Now listen, if I could figure you're working for the Insurgency, chances are anyone could.\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood rises from his chair defensively.##\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"I haven't even let you in on it, yet. Sit down, speedy.\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood sits back down.##\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"I'll clue you in. But you can't tell a person. I don't care if you 'don't do spy shit anymore.'\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"And what will you do about it?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"You know what I'm capable of. Listen here: tomorrow during my commons period you're going to be there, m'kay?\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Why me?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Tomorrow, when you're there, and you will be, you will get me my pistol. It's stored at this site and only requires Level-3 clearance to access.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Of which I possess.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"You will be there with my pistol.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"I thought the plan was not to kill anyone.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"You're going to walk over to my table in the commons, place the pistol in my pocket, and leave. Then what you will do is head over to the Euclid containment zone and breach an entity in there.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Hey! I thought the plan was not to kill anyone.\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Don't interrupt me, I won't use the pistol if I don't need to. Anyways, you will have a 15 minute period. The cameras will be down. This will distract the site's security and I will escape. The Euclid containment zone is on the opposite size of the facility as the Entrance zone. It is an easy dodge.\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"You won't even be able to leave the site! You don't have a bloody keycard!\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Bold of you to assume. Don't let down.\"\n\n##grey|At this moment, Burkswood is reprehensible.##\n\n**Burkswood:** \"What is the motive here?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"A little birdy told me the real reason I died. I was murdered by the SCP Foundation. And get this: over an accusation that I was spilling information. Can you blame me for wanting out? They build me up like a toy and deconstruct me day to day whenever they deem it necessary and you're asking what my motive is?\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"Well now-\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Minimal casualties. Nobody will know. Now what you're going to do is walk over to the voice box, unmute it, and say this interview has concluded. Capeesh?\"\n\n**Burkswood:** \"And what will you do if I don't comply?\"\n\n**SCP-6604:** \"Well then you'll be killed. If I'm lucky, I'll even do it myself.\"\n\n##grey|Burkswood rises once more and walks over to the voice box, muttering into it.
