She would never travel 40 light years to suck your precious planet “Dirt” of its metals, water, fissile material, or other valuable commodities. Accusing HammerMaiden of any of these foul blasphemies against what she's sure are a very 'proud' people here on planet what-you-call will absolutely not be grounds for summary disintegration and a full history-wipe of your presence. It would be silly to tell you not to be alarmed while in the presence of HammerMaiden, as she is perfectly normal in every way. HammerMaiden would like to be your human friend instead. Please inform HammerMaiden if you would like to participate in friendly human activities, and what exactly those are.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"HammerMaiden\" separate=\"no\" limit=\"250\" perPage=\"250\" tags=\"scp, -joke\" order=\"title\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n**The Temporal Anomalies Department:**\n\nHub page: [[[Welcome to Delta T|Temporal Site-01 (RCT-Δt Hub)]]]\n\n* [[[Iteration 0]]] - And everything was going so well...\n* [[[The Deep End]]] - So which is it: Sink or Swim?\n* [[[Erstwhile and Again]]] - The last normal day...\n* [[[Exit History]]] - Stage Right.\n* [[[Document 1780-WL|Welcome to RCT-Δt]]] - Secure the Past.
