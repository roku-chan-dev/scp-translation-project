Containment efforts primarily focus on identifying and containing Access Points and minimizing unauthorized entry. As of writing, 119 points of access have been identified, with 45 being successfully contained. The remaining Access Points are under the jurisdiction of GoI-386 \"Dr. Wondertainment\" via \"Wonder Bros Inc.\", its parent company. As of 17/01/2018, GoI-386 is considered a hostile combatant of the Foundation; use of lethal force is authorized against company liaisons engaged in anti-containment activities. \n\nIndividuals assigned to MTF Lamba-484 [\"Somnologists\"] must be screened and assessed for a Sandburg Professionalism Score of no greater than 5. All activity conducted within SCP-8981 must abide by local laws, regulations, and decrees to ensure continued diplomatic relations with SCP-8981-A and its cooperation with containment.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:80%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/the-mad-three-parties/Curious_country.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:80%;margin:auto;\"]]\nSCP-8981 (artist's rendition)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[!-- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Curious_country.jpg --]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+ Description\nSCP-8981 is a variable intangible surreality.[[footnote]]SCP-8981 functionally serves as a fixed-boundary alternative dimension or plane of existence, yet lacks many of the structures of normalcy necessary to be considered a reality, and has been theorized to be a partially or wholly derivative sub-construct of the Noösphere, Oneirosphere, and/or Collective Unconscious.[[/footnote]] \n\nThe environment within SCP-8981 is highly anomalous, with ontokinesis, thaumaturgy, and paramemetics normalized in society and nature to some extent.[[footnote]] Local understanding of these phenomena may not align with Foundation descriptions or categorizations. [[/footnote]] SCP-8981 has an extensive record of political upheaval and tumultuous regime change, the most recent of which occurred upon SCP-8981-A's coronation. \n\nSCP-8981 is populated by various human, humanoid, and nonhuman organisms, with a rich and diverse history and conglomeration of cultures. Societies within SCP-8981 primarily orient around hereditary monarchies with sporadic dynastic continuity or localized oligarchic rule. The authority of these monarchies have typically been both highly centralized and localized, with polities outside the immediate vicinity of the ruling city or Burroughs generally existing as independent, quasi-anarchistic entities. \n\nThere do not seem to be any significant nationalistic tendencies among the inhabitants of SCP-8981, and polities are generally multicultural and multi-species in demographics. SCP-8981-A is believed to have taken power as regnant within the largest polity in SCP-8981, which was previously ruled by a highly authoritarian and punitive monarchy. Following the demise of the ruling dynasty, the region entered a period of decline before descending into an ungoverned state. It was at this point SCP-8981-A arrived in the region, and utilized diplomatic and thaumaturgic force to ascend to the throne.\n\nThe economy of SCP-8981's polities is generally reliant on agricultural & manufacturing industries, with the latter being of particular importance to SCP-8981-A's domain. In addition, a significantly developed resource extraction sector exists within SCP-8981-A's domain, oriented around the extraction of a liquid mineral oil found within SCP-8981's crust that appears to augment ontokinetic and thaumaturgic effects. This resource extraction sector forms the basis for economic and diplomatic relations between SCP-8981 and Wonder Bros Inc.\n\nSCP-8981 developed an extraveil cultural presence as the subject of Lewis Carroll's novels //Alice In Wonderland// and //Through The Looking Glass//, though it is popularly believed to be a fictional setting. Carroll's fictionalization is theorized to have stemmed from visitation, however this remains unconfirmed. Information recovered from within SCP-8981 has remained inconclusive.\n\nSCP-8981-A is the current reigning monarch of SCP-8981 and primary legislative, economic, and cultural authority. It is believed that SCP-8981-A previously resided in baseline reality under the identity \"Dr. Wondertainment\" (PoI-386). \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ Discovery\n\nThe Foundation was unaware of SCP-8981's existence until written invitations to \"The Sanest King's 3rd Annual Unbirthday Ball\" were received by all Foundation facilities, delivered by unknown means, and emblazoned with the Wondertainment executive seal. A priority investigation was immediately ordered, as the Wondertainment executive seal had been believed to be known only to researchers with privileged knowledge, as well as the fact that invitations were distributed to classified facilities with clearance restrictions up to and including Cosmic Top Secret.\n\n> To Whom it May and Mayn't Concern:\n> \n> Salutations!

Mobile Task Force Delta-51[[footnote]]Selected based on team experience, availability, and proximity.[[/footnote]] [\"Glowing Pains\"] was assigned to investigate the building, verify the existence of an extranormal event, and determine the motivations behind the invitation. \n\nUpon arriving at the supposed event venue, Delta-51 reported that the entirety of the facility's floor had been replaced by a sheer vertical drop with no visible end, the perimeter of which was shaped precisely to the building's floorplan. After multiple failed attempts to pilot reconnaissance drones into the pit, approval was given to allow two members of Delta-51 to investigate directly. Due to the mechanical and electronic issues experienced with the drone flights, video recording was substituted for remote perception relay via Argos Protocol.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► VIEW LOG\" hide=\"▼ HIDE LOG\" ]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n= [[size 200%]]**ARGOS LOG**[[/size]]\n= //Transcript generated through the use of cognitive relay.//\n= //Language and events described may be influenced by subjective cognition.//\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**[ BEGIN LOG ]**\n\n[ //Kafoa approaches the facility's main entry point. The door is already open. The pit is visible through the open doorway, beginning precisely along the threshold. Paint and wall decorations are still present along the walls, though heavily worn with age. At the point where the walls would be expected to terminate along the baseboards, they instead extend downward with uninterrupted brickwork. The facility's lights are on, illuminating roughly 20 meters of wall along the perimeter of the pit.// ]\n\n[ //Hodge follows behind Kafoa, peering over her shoulder.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] That definitely looks bottomless.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Nah. There's a bottom. And I bet you fifty there's a meat grinder waiting for us at the end of it.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] You know there's no version of that bet that ends with you getting money, right?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]COMMAND RADIO:[[/span]] We have reason to believe the invitation was a genuine missive from Wondertainment himself. Traps aren't his MO.  \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] I thought Wondertainment was more than one guy?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Come on, Hodge. They're not going to send a a Class-D to meet Wondertainment face-to-face, and they're not going to send a diplomat into an anomalous pit. This is what we signed up for.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Don't get me wrong, now. I'll jump in a death hole any day of the week. I just want to know who whose party we're attending. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]COMMAND RADIO:[[/span]] It's an old one. Can't say for sure if there's an original Wondertainment, but if there is, this could be him. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Lucky us. Let's go make history, then. \n\n[ //Kafoa and Hodge don their harnesses, which are then hooked up to a winch and pulley system that personnel have secured to underlying architecture above the lobby ceiling. Delta-51 agents perform final safety checks on harnesses, cables, and fasteners.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] We clear?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]COMMAND RADIO:[[/span]] You're clear. Enjoy the ball. \n\n[ //Kafoa and Hodge, harnesses fastened together, push off from the threshold. Once their momentum has settled, Kafoa gives a thumbs up and the ground team begins lowering the two into the pit.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]COMMAND RADIO:[[/span]] Thirty seconds until the radio stops working. Remember, you can still talk to us via Argos. Just say the word and we'll bring you up. Over.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Copy. \n\n[ //The two descend beyond the illuminated depth and activate their headlamps. The walls can be seen to be bare brickwork as far down as their light reaches.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] The bricks aren't laid perfectly straight. Globs of mortar here and there. Looks done by hand.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] You think someone actually built this?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Might be meant to look that way, at least. \n\n[ //Kafoa notices a glint of light reflected off the wall several meters beneath them. It's a golden frame.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] There's a painting down there. Hard to make out the detail from this angle. Landscape? Hold on. I think there's a house—\n\n[ //The painting rushes up out of view as Kafoa and Hodge enter free fall. They scream.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] The line! The line!\n\n[ **EDITOR'S NOTE:** Delta-51 winch operators detected no change in speed or tension during this time. ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] It can't be! There were redundancies! \n\n[ //More wall decorations blur past Kafoa and Hodge's field of vision, but their fall is too quick to focus on them.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Any idea what the terminal velocity for a human being is? \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Two humans. Well over a hundred kilometers an hour. Maybe two. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] We've been falling for about two minutes. One hour divided by—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] About three kilometers per minute, give or take. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] The line still feels taut. They said the winch could handle up to four thousand meters, so even if it failed, it would have maxed out by now. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Think it's possible we're not really falling? Perception anomaly?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] No way of knowing, but it feels real to me!\n\n[ **EDITOR'S NOTE:** Delta-51 winch operators continued to see no change in speed or tension for the following half hour. When the maximum length of 4km was fully extended, Kafoa and Hodge still perceived themselves in free fall, per Argos. ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Ten minutes by my watch.[[footnote]]Timepiece was later confirmed to be functioning correctly. Temporal distortion likely.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] I think we might be in this for the long haul. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Headlamps are still operational, so not all electronics are affected. Let's turn them off to conserve battery. No telling how long we'll be here.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Good idea. Now what?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Always enjoyed Twenty Questions.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Animal, vegetable, or mineral?\n\n[ //Extraneous conversation redacted.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] One hour.[[footnote]]One hour and twenty minutes had elapsed in baseline time. Temporal distortion deemed inconsistent.[[/footnote]] That would put us, what? Somewhere in the upper mantle?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Sounds right. Is the person you're thinking of an entertainer?\n\n[ //Extraneous conversation redacted.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Two hours.\n\n[ //Extraneous conversation redacted.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Four hours. I'm going to try to get a nap in. Getting used to the wind. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] You're a psychopath if you can fall asleep like this. It's like those falling dreams that wake you up right when you're almost asleep, except you never hit the bottom. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I don't have those. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Like I said. Psychopath. \n\n[ //Intermittent periods of silence and conversation follow as the two continue to fall.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I can't wrap my head around that kind of thing, you know? Like, you're her son. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Don't matter to her. Why should it matter to me? \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I'm not saying you have to //like// her. I mean, my— \n\n[ //They scream as they land. The surface is soft and rough.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Hell of a jump scare. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Hey, we're alive. \n\n[ //The two come to their feet, though with some difficulty due to the instability of the soft surface beneath them. They unfasten their harnesses and activate their headlamps. Kafoa and Hodge find themselves standing on a massive pile of pink fiberglass insulation, at least four stories tall. The skin on their faces is irritated from contact during landing, but they are otherwise unharmed. The ground beneath the pile is dark and inscrutable. It extends in all directions as far as their light travels. The walls are no longer visible.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Looks like a void.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] This your first void?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Yeah. Always wanted to see a void. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Hope it's everything you dreamed of. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] And more.\n\n[ //The two make their way down from the pile of insulation, falling occasionally, causing further irritation to their faces. As they approach the bottom, Kafoa abruptly holds up a hand.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I hear something coming.\n\n[ //An indistinct humanoid figure emerges from the darkness, seeming to shimmer in the light of the agents' headlamps. As the figure draws closer, it become possible to discern that its body is made of a mass of smaller objects that constantly shift and move, some traveling along the surface and some folding in or out of the central mass. The objects are mostly paper bills and coins in unrecognized demoninations, as well as precious stones and metals, and occasionally semi-physical manifestations of raw numerical data.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]UNKNOWN:[[/span]] Hurry! Hurry! You're going to be late!\n\n[ //The voice is deep, rich, and shiny. The figure runs to Kafoa.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]UNKNOWN:[[/span]] I've been looking everywhere for you!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Know the guy?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] No. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]UNKNOWN:[[/span]] You may not know me by name, but who do you think sent out those lovely and flamboyant stationary invitations? You are here for the ball, yes?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] You're //the// Dr. Wondertainment?\n\n[ //The figure lets out a contextually exaggerated laugh.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]UKNOWN:[[/span]] No, no. I am Mads' trustiest of friends. An advisor: Taxes. You may have heard of me—I am of the utmost importance, you know! And I put together this whole thing! Well, it's his party and planning, but I've always managed the little things that really make it gel! Yes, I'm really the glue that holds everything together.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] My first void //and// my first anthropomorhisation of a concept. This really is my lucky day.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Taxes, eh?

If you're not him, we'd appreciate it if you took us to him.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]TAXES:[[/span]] Well, you're just full of bother! Wrinkles spoil a youthful complexion, you know, and bother like that wrinkles your face! No, he's not fond of bothers and sternities. \n\n[ //Taxes produces a measuring tape and a pincushion from thin air. Hodges appears confused, but Kafoa remains stoic in her expression. The three are the only visible features within the void, save for the pile of insulation they had landed in.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]TAXES:[[/span]] Let me measure your waist, miss—er, what was it?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Is this really the best use of our—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Just call her Cage.

Kafoa is alone.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] //¡Que mierda!//\n\n[ //Kafoa begins wading through the slick not-a-floor of the void, navigating the total featurelessness as best as her body knows how. It evokes in her a sense of oscillating nausea, teetering through, or at least feeling as though she is teetering through, with the only frame of reference being the ever-so-faint glow far ahead.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I should've just gone with Hodge and worn a damn dress or something. I feel like I'm gonna be—\n\n[ //Kafoa wretches, throwing up watery bile from an empty stomach. She realizes she hasn't eaten since leaving base camp. She thinks of how she's been stuck on cinnamon oatmeal and hasn't had room for anything else, save for the odd NutriPill. The vomit splats down onto the dark void, appearing flatly lit and strangely static. In an odd way, it ameliorates her nausea perfectly, not just for satisfaction of satiating her body's instincts, but also for the frame of reference the messy spatter provides for her uneasy eye. She catches herself wishing she had eaten more before coming, if only to have more substance to paint the endless black with. A quaint, charming sentiment, no doubt.// ]\n\n[ //As the glow begins to grow larger, her proximity to the gate closer, she begins to hear noises, faintly at first and then louder— not as if closing a distance, but as if the sounds had been around her all this time and she was only now starting to hear them. Razor-sharp humming of harpsichords, clattering of plates and clinks of silverware, the low roar of an ocean of conversation—all the makings of a ball, and surely the one to which she had been invited. The bright light only grow and grow as she wobbles onward.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] I'm never going down a void again, Christ as my witness. \n\n[ //Kafoa reaches the gate, now clarified and crystalized as a solid glass door. It is frosted elegantly in floral patterns, but through the murky glasswork, Kafoa can make out flourishes of gold, green, red and blue; figures moving, dancing, figures seated, making all manners of sounds and gaieties. She places her palms against the door, pushing it open, and she stumbles in unceremoniously.// ]\n\n[ //Kafoa is greeted by a vivacious scene of diners and dukes and drunkards and debauchees, each and every one dressed in immaculate and incredulous getups of feathers, silks, jewels, and elaborate accoutrements. Guests of all shapes and sizes and species dance upon a central floor adorned with a patchwork moasaic of tiles and patternwork of all manners of traditions, from Arabesque to Cantonese, Pomeranian to Madagascan, Chennai Madras to Tricotage Peruvienne.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]CAT IN SPATS:[[/span]] And I said to her, I said, I tell you— I said to her, 'a bird can fly, but a fly—'\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HUMAN-SIZED FLY IN DUNGAREES:[[/span]] A fly can't bird. Yeah. You stay here, I'm gonna get another drink. \n\n[ //Polymorphous banquet tables cluster around the corners and walls, set with hundreds of plates and chalices and bowls and goblets and various other instruments of the well-fed bourgeoisie. Dispersed throughout the tables are large pipe machinations, each a bundle of pastel-colored translucent tubes. Partiers gather at these constructions, taking one of the many reed-tipped hoses that spilled from the central terminus of the main pipes and imbibing the intoxicating fumes of whatever variety of inebriate each pipe supplies: Hash, Nicotine, Nitrous, and Mescaline— countless poisons of distressed nerves in constant supply, and additionally, an unfamiliar substance to those denizens of the flip side: a glimmering, glittery smoke that seemed to make its consumers overflow with some manner of thaumaturgic energy. Strung up balloons and inflatable humanoid figures line the ceiling and walls in decorative intervals, each figure bearing warm, friendly, almost unnervingly human smiles, frozen laughs, and the occasional grimace.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Welcome back to the land of the living!

Did he say anything about Wondertainment?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] No, not that I— wait, he //did// say something about a Catterfly needing some rolling paper.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]KAFOA:[[/span]] Of course.

A wordless glance between the two: the ball was properly starting. The two watch the curtain begin to crumble and fall, elegantly unveiling what must be the aforementioned Calendar Hare. Kafoa and Hodge stare with horror and disgust.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HEAD LIVERY:[[/span]] Thank you everyone for attending his Royal Majesty's 3rd Annual Unbirthday Ball, and for those for whom this is their first in attending, our most beautiful Calendar Hare here shall serve as the officiator of our titular Unbirthing!\n\n[ //The Calendar Hare sits behind the curtain, room-sized and fleshy. It is a writhing, twitchy, convulsing mound of angry-red flesh and boils. Dozens of furless rabbit ears protruded from the fatty rolling hills that make up the creature. Puddles of what Kafoa hoped to be sweat gathered where the terrible, malodorous corpus met the pristine marble floor. Pointed at the ball's audience was a large, human-height slit, sealed shut with a large metal zipper. On either side of the zipper: two severely atrophied and withered hind legs, long since decayed from disuse.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] This is rapidly becoming a lot less fun.\n\n[ //Kafoa gags. A base, primal instinct tells her to avert her gaze from what she logically knows is the Hare's visage, pooled and congealed near the ceiling. Hodge too elects to obey this primordial wisdom. The two agents look around at the other attendees, struggling to understand their composure. In the front, Kafoa sees two women, each resembling nesting dolls, appear to swoon with romantic gestures. All of the partygoers, entirely intoxicated by the array of substances and Dilly-Dally Oil, appear to be in a state of total blissful transfixation. Kafoa shudders.// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]HODGE:[[/span]] Does— does that say what I think it does?\n\n[ //Hodge points to signage at the front of the hall, directly in front of the Calendar Hare.

The rest of the crowd looks on with expectant veneration. Billows of purple and blue glitter-smoke waft from the pipes towards the Calendar Hare.

Formal holding charges of \"sternness\" and \"indecision\" were levied by the \"Minister of Rubber Mallets\". Information yielded during this time seemed to indicate SCP-8981-A is capable of producing semi-identical clones of himself through asexual reproduction, with these clones primarily serving in various governmental positions in a senior advisory council dubbed the \"Yes Court\". Constituent ministers are variously referred to as either a \"Yes Man\", typically by SCP-8981-A colloquially, or their full title. There exist 5 constituent Yes Men on the court: \n* Minister of Bouncy Fortifications: Advises on military matters.\n* Minister of Pinky Promises: Advises on foreign affairs and interreality diplomacy.\n* Minister of Petty Complaints: Advises on citizenry appeasement and domestic leisure.\n* Minister of Sugar & Opium: Advises on agricultural and nourishment sectors.\n* Minister of Bureautainment: Advises on legal matters, large projects and policies.\n\nIn addition to the formal ministries associated with the Yes Court, there also appear to be numerous other SCP-8981-A clones that serve minor roles throughout the royal palace, particularly in roles that are dependent on the personal tastes or opinions of SCP-8981-A.\n\nShortly after detainment and imprisonment, Hodge was able to leverage the \"Gaiety of his dress\" to gain early release. Hodge was given a number of resources on behalf of SCP-8981-A to return to Foundation leadership with the presumed intention of leverage towards SCP-8981-A's stated goals of self-containment. Hodge's release was conditional, with Kafoa's continued custody being a contingency. \n\nHodge successfully and safely returned to baseline reality with assistance from a small battalion SCP-8981-A's elite militant units, dubbed \"Wombardiérs\".\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ Containment Initiative\n\nUtilizing information provided by SCP-8981-A, Foundation Intelligence was able to locate a number of SCP-8981 Access Points and identify ingress rituals. With this knowledge, the O5 Council approved an initiative to contain all means of ingress to SCP-8981. A summary of projects undertaken for this purpose is included below. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"► VIEW LOG\" hide=\"▼ HIDE LOG\" ]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n=  [[size 200%]]**PROJECT LOG**[[/size]]\n= //Truncated summary.//\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[!-- @@@@\n@@@@\n+++ Access Point #\n**Location:** \n**Description:** \n**Special Containment Project:** --]\n+++ Access Point #08\n**Location:** Lyelchytsy, Gomel Region (Belarus)\n**Description:** Antique steel bedframe.

A hollow knot along the western side expands in size when approached by a human subject, granting entry to SCP-8981 within. \n**Special Containment Project:** Transplanted to Site-24 greenhouse.\n**Note:** Upon discovery, several flexible tubes were seen extruding from the hollow knot into the ground below. When the tubes were confirmed to be neither part of the tree nor an apparatus of the spatial anomaly, an attempt was made to extricate them. During the attempt, the tubes rapidly retracted into the ground, causing minor injury to two personnel. No traces of the tubes could be found during subsequent investigation. \n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ Access Point #22\n**Location:** Puruk Cahu, Central Kalimantan (Indonesia)\n**Description:** Drainage ditch overtaken by flora.

Attempts to collect a sample of the material resulted in failure; tubes retracted rapidly as in previous encounter and could not be recovered.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ Access Point #031\n**Location:** Maruranau, Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo (Guyana)\n**Description:** Balatá tree (//Manilkara bidentata//) carved with climbing footholds commonly used in the region.

There is a spatial anomaly at the back of the oven portion which leads to a labyrinthine series of tunnels, the entirety of which remain confined to the dimensions of the original oven interior. SCP-8981 may be accessed through successful traversal of the tunnel system. \n**Special Containment Project:** Excavated and moved to Storage Site-49.\n**Notes:** Large black tubes once again seen upon discovery of the Access Point, extending from the oven tunnels into the surrounding woodland. Yet again, the tubes retracted too quickly to be intercepted by personnel.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSeveral hours after containment of Access Point #037 was secured, a decorative arrangement of baked goods was found to have appeared beside the excavation site. A handwritten card was attached to a stand at the center of the arrangement, reading \"CEASE AND DESIST — WONDER BROS LEGAL, XOXOXO\" on the front. The back of the card bore instructions for accessing a paratechnologically encrypted communications network. The incident was reported up the chain of command, and resulted in the O5 council issuing a temporary pause on SCP-8981 containment initiatives. \n\n[!-- **P1:** Initial incursion, meeting the people, building the tone and environment.

He is.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] So, you two represent the executive leadership of Wonder Bros Inc., then?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Correct.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] In its entirety? I see there are several additional users on the call.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Please do not question it. It'll—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] And there we have our lucky winner! O5-5! I know, I know, settle down everyone. Really, the rancorous applause is too much! Now, now. //Now// that we are ready and gathered, you all can hear me okay, yes?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Unison:[[/span]] Yes.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Excellent! Now, if we could just do some quick introductions for you all and for us as well, to better engage in this illustrious and immutable joint-effort. I'll start: Hello everyone! I am Chambertain Wondertainment, CEO and President of Wonder Bros Ink-ink-ink, happy to be here to set up this little powwow! Alrighty, next?\n\n[ //From this point onwards, Chambertin physically relocates himself to assume the respective seats and webcams of his other held positions within GOI-386// ]\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Hi everyone, I'm Chambertin Wondertainment, Vice President of Marketing. Eager to work with you all!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] Right, well—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Business as usual. Burgundy Wondertainment. COO here at Wonder Brothers Incorporated. Yes, it's my real name.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Snore, snore, snore, yawn, yawn— Chambertin Wondertainment, Director of Design! I'm the cool one!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Chambertin Wondertainment, Chair of our Board of Trustees. The other 13 members of our board, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, Chambertin Wondertainment, and George Aldwell, could not make it to the meeting. I will also spare the trouble and introduce our VP of Marketing, Chambertin Wondertainment, for him, so we don't eat up any more time.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] Christ. I guess I can go then. We typically don't deal in names, so I can be addressed as O5-5 or just 'Five' for the purposes of this call. I serve on the Interrelations Subcommittee for the Foundation, working with my other subcommittee members on matters to do with anomalous groups of interest such as your organization.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Anomaly? What did I do?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] Well, you see—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] Shh, just— Good afternoon Mr. and, uh, Mr. Wondertainment. Any relation to the Doctor?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] None.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] I serve as the Chair, as I mentioned earlier. O5-4 here serves on the subcommittee as well, with a particular focus on outreach and risk mitigation. I assume that is why we are gathered here today?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Right, right, yes! Of course! I will allow my wonderful brother-in-wonderkin to lead that—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] We are aware that you have a team of individuals under your employ currently within Wonderland.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] We are currently conducting an investigation into the anomaly, yes. Especially its association with your organization.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Right. Wonder Brothers Incorporated has an important financial relationship with Wonderland. Your incursion is potentially problematic for our current projections, especially with your organization's history of—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] Can we just get on with it? What do you want?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Ladies and gentlemen, and in betweens, if present, please, we are all consummate professionals here! Let's let everyone finish their thoughts, yes? I so terribly understand the impatience, with your very real and human employees still trapped so, //so// very far away!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] Is that a threat?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] What do you take me for?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Our relationship to Wonderland is best understood as akin to a client-client relationship. Or manufacturer-supplier relationship. It is in our best interests we progress logically and soundly, yes?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] To be clear, SCP-8981 is not under your company's jurisdiction?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Unfortunately not. Which takes me to my most pressing concern: your arrival. Despite your best intentions, our institutional machiantions have been largely insulated from your attempts at \"containment\". It was mentioned that your ilk was 'invited' to the gate. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] We received a direct invitation by mail, at all of our facilities, from or on behalf of 'Dr. Wondertainment' himself. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Sorry to barge in right at this moment, but could you clarify, when you say on behalf of 'Dr. Wondertainment', this implies a level of branded packaging or endorsement? Would you be able to send over a scan or show a copy of the invitation received?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Dr. Wondertainment has not been under our employ for quite some time now. Chambertin, I don't think we need to confirm the branding.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] If he is still using trademarked and licensed company material and impressions, we need to consider opening up a legal theater in addition to our current fronts! We can't have him tarnishing our image even more!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] Respectfully, your image is primarily that of a dubiously intentioned and often malicious plague on the toymaking industry. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] No, no, no! Our toys are imbued with wonder and joy! True satisfaction designed to dominate markets and senses! The failures stamped with the Wondertainment label, they are the work of the late, great Dr. Wondertainment, our founder.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] And persona non-grata, from the sounds of it.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] I assume 'late, great' is figurative? Our team has interacted with a man identifying as Wondertainment, who by our judgement, aligns fairly well with existing information about the character.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] May as well be dead, for all I care. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] We had the former CEO & Founder declared legally dead in absentia for purposes of streamlining organizational proceedings. Chambertin took over after the Doctor's mental collapse. Unfortunately, because he did not formally resign and no longer resides in this plane, manufacturing a dead man proved our best solution. But yes, Dr. Wondertainment is paradoxically no longer associated with or a representative of Wonder Brothers Incorporated, and //especially// not the Dr. Wondertainment subsidiary and brand, which currently exists in a largely discontinued state as we develop a cohesive rebranding campaign more suitable for the general masses.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] So to be clear, you are telling us that the anomalous objects primarily associated with your company are in fact neither produced nor endorsed by your company? But rather bootlegs? \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Look, if I can step in from a development perspective: Seven, it's really crucial for us to stress that the former Dr. Wondertainment, he is a rogue element. He left the company under extremely violent and unclear circumstances, and remains largely ungovernable and unbuyable. We no longer have control over the flow and output of WonderCules from his domain, and it seems like he is intent on waging war with his creations. That should be obvious to us all, yes?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] I'm sorry, I'm going to need some clarification, you didn't really answer my question: Is SCP-8981-A, formerly addressed Dr. Wondertainment- Is he the chief party responsible for the propagation of these harmful and paranormal entertainment products primarily associated with your organization?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Look, we can explain the concepts of harm, and, especially in pertinence to your organization's operating doctrine, abnormality, but again, we have to proceed in this with the understanding that The Hattertainment—as we call him—is an ungovernable threat to both of our operations. Our understanding is that at least two of your employees are imprisoned within the Chateau d'Ennui? Hodge and... Kafka, was it?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] Agent Hodge was able to negotiate his release. Agent Kafoa is still in the 'Chateau'. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Regardless, I think it's in our best interests to—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Collaborate!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Yes, collaborate on this matter, and bring Wonderland and all assets therein under some level of moderation. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] So. I have questions. Earlier, Burgundy, you mentioned that SCP-8981—or, er, Wonderland, as you may call it—was of key strategic importance to your organization's production scheme. This is not particularly in alignment with the idea that SCP-8981-A is the sole or even primary perpetuant agent of anomalous entertainment products under your company's moniker, so I have to ask: what is it exactly that you get out of this?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Well, you see, Wondercorp—er, //Wonder Bros//—our historical muse has always been the fauna and flora of Wonderland. The wondrous, fantasmulific creatures and images, these were what inspired Dr. Wondertainment to found our wonderful company, with the mission we share to this day: to bring wonder and joy to the world! Three E's: Entertain, Experiment, and Exalt.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Logistics prefers Exploit for the third. \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] We digress! Wondertainment sullied this concept, and though our company still upholds our traditional toymaking methods and customs, we have had to completely reorient our branding and operations to make up for his terrible, terrible deeds. His intentions to hoard all the wonder for himself, they are not what we stand for, and his insistence on—\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] Chambertin, I think we're straying too far away from the point: we have to stop his extremely destructive tantrums, and the release of dangerous and umarketable products into the consumer base. I think that is what the Foundation needs to hear.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] I'm unconvinced by this. From what we have learned so far from our team within, there seems to be a rather significant industrial sector in resource extraction— 'Dilly-Dally Oil' as the locals call it.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] Dilly-Fucking-Dally Oil? That's what he calls it?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] I was not aware you had constant contact with your team.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] Of course we do. You think we'd send them in blind? \n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] We have significant reason to believe, as indicated by your terming of the relationship as a client-client, among other infrastructure known and unknown, that a large portion of your business model involves the usage of resources from SCP-8981, particularly this 'Dilly-Dally Oil'.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] WonderCule.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] What?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] WonderCule. Patent pending. We try to have consistent marketing and branding. Please don't insult us with that stupid name. 'Dilly Dally Oil'… what a joke!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] Listen, Seven. I don't think GOI-386 is absolved here.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-4:[[/span]] I concur.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] It would be a mistake to reject this opportunity.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] I fail to see any reason to not consider your company equally anomalous to Dr. Wondertainment, despite your claims that he is a rogue agent. Unfortunately, we are going to be leveraging our assets to bring the SCP-8981 Access Points and surroundings under our direct authority, and seizing any assets of Wonder Bros Inc. found to have abetted anomalous activity. We will not be significantly altering our policy towards your company and its products unless sufficient evidence has been provided of intention to abandon the production of anomalous products. Is this understood?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] No, no, no, no, //no//! You do not have that power, mister!\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-7:[[/span]] We obviously do.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] No, you don't understand. When Joseph Stalin valiantly elected to reverse course and vanquish the horrible fascists jointly with the beautiful, wealthy Americans, it was of the mutualest understanding— the collaborative spirit that drives enterprise, that it was the matter of ensured survival and prosperity to instead annihilate the childish man in Berlin, the entry-level Caesar. No, no, you do not understand this. Instead we shall skip to the 90s and tear down this wall.\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]O5-5:[[/span]] Pardon?\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]BURGUNDY:[[/span]] For the purposes of brevity and clarity of communication, on behalf of Wonder Brothers Incorporated and all holdings and entities thereof, we authorize and declare the use of force against the Foundation. Succinctly put:\n\n[[span class=\"characterTag\"]]Chambertin:[[/span]] This is war.\n\n**[ END LOG ]** \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nCommunication ceased with GOI-386 following this exchange and developments at Provisional Containment Site-8981 involving mercenaries presumed to have been hired by Wonder Bros Inc.

Off in the distance she can see numerous small hamlets and villages, with the occasional cluster of arboreal mushrooms and pink, feathered trees dotting the landscape. There are fields of grain nested in many of the hills near to the villages, fields where peasantry undoubtedly toiled to fill the King's breadbasket, as all polities of yore had done. Kafoa finds herself wondering where exactly the wonder is supposed to be in all of this.

The last thing she hears is the Hatter screaming at the top of his lungs that he is readying \"The Devouring Fuzzy Worm to kill them all\" before the heavy wooden door slams shut behind her.// ]\n\n[ //She runs down the spiral staircase into the main hall, where a large group of [[[SCP-1048]]] instances are assembling explosive stuffed animals for use against the Wonder Bros' forces. The bears do not appear to pay attention to Kafoa, instead focusing on their task. As she exits the main hall, she passes by the banquet & ballroom where the festivities had taken place earlier: the previously tasteful interspersing of balloons had now turned into a sloppy overcrowding of inflated humans, at least fifty new ones clumped at the top and still wearing their Wonder Bros Inc corporate garb. Some of them wear frightened expressions, others notice Kafoa and look at her with silent, pleading eyes. She continues running.// ]\n\n[ //Kafoa manages a hectic sprint, weaving through the capital and through the carts and wagons loaded with oil or war supplies. She can see large, angry, and coal-black smoke clouds in the distance where the rigs—the main theater of the war—no doubt lay. It was also where her extraction point was. It takes some rummaging around the eerily quiet shopping square, where once vendors had sold their livelihoods, to find a much older Wondermobile designed to run entirely on Dilly-Dally Oil. There was still enough supply in the wagon to get her to the fields.// ]\n\n[ //She hops in, scanning the wagon quickly and more-or-less judging it to drive similar to an antique automobile, and quickly starts it. Kafoa is still dazed from what just transpired, driving through the thick billows of black and purple smoke that crept in from the fields, growing thicker and more pronounced the further from the town center she travels. The gregarious grasslands are choked in blankets of indigo so thick that it almost resembles a field of seaweed beneath the ocean waves. Nonetheless, she continues onwards, arriving at the foot of a collapsed rig that she identifies as the soft spot for extraction. Just before kicking into the loam, she's startled by a deafening explosion and otherworldly roar.// ]\n\n[ //Kafoa turns to look towards the source of the sound, seeing a rig approximately 50 meters from her collapse with a terrible scraping of steel. The perpetrator: a colossal leviathan draped from the sky, adorned with radiant sunburst and lavender fur, hundreds of miles long and with many limbs of toile, plaid, and felt, a thin tapered head with two spheres of obsidian and marble that glimmered like impossible moons—what a kinder world might know as enormous googly-eyes. With terrible flourishes of its tail and limbs, it crushes the rigs and tears apart the Wonder Brothers' corporate soldiers to pieces, spraying out great fumes of nitrous gas.// ]\n\n[ //Kafoa's mouth falls agape as she freezes, watching the creature that she now realizes must be the All-Consuming-Eternal-Devouring-0%-Polyester-Fuzzy-Worm the Hatter had mentioned earlier. This titanic creation, one fabricated by pieces of the Hatter's flesh, oil, and the weave of hundreds of builder-bears, the final weapon of mass destruction in Wondertainment's arsenal. It dutifully and violently strangles the trespassers where they stand, tenderly peeling and consuming them—cleaning up the mess after playtime. She simply watches as towers of steel crumple like foil under the worm, before harshly realizing her proximity to the slaughter. She kicks into the loam, striking until it crumbles, cracks, and gives way under weight, revealing the hole underneath that was to take her back.// ]\n\n[ //She falls.// ]\n\n**[ END LOG ]**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nContact with Kafoa was re-established following her emergence from Access Point #22. She was promptly triaged and prepared for extraction, and debriefed shortly thereafter within secure Foundation custody.\n\nFollowing the events surrounding Kafoa's escape and extraction, SCP-8981-A's leverage of a large, hostile entity against the mercenary forces of GoI-386 within SCP-8981 essentially rendered the conflict a strategic stalemate. GoI-386 still continues to engage in militant behavior towards the Foundation, although SCP-8981-A appears to periodically assist in containment & mitigation efforts via indiscriminate attacks on properties and employees of Wonder Bros Inc. from within SCP-8981. The Foundation has maintained an official stance of unofficial neutrality in the conflict, despite further and continued attempts at negotiation from SCP-8981-A[[footnote]] e.g. invitation to the subsequent \"Fourth Annual Unbirthday Ball feat. Disco, Death & Destruction!\" [[/footnote]]. \n\nSubsequent investigative efforts focusing on the legal and corporate history of GoI-386 have yielded little information on the origin and nature of Chambertin & Burgundy Wondertainment, the belligerent executive leadership of GoI-386. However, legal records originating from a small adoptions agency near Bristol, United Kingdom, indicated record of a Steven Rutherford being adopted by a \"Mads Wondertainment\" at some point during 1982, with a footnote indicating a name change on adoption to \"Chambertin.\"\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| previous-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/yourstrulyfirstunbirthdayball\n| previous-title = Yours Truly, The 1st Annual Unbirthday Ball\n| next-url = /\n| next-title = /\n| hub-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-sanest-king\n| hub-title = The Sanest King Hub\n]]\n\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n:root {\n     --header-title: \"The Sanest King\";\n     --header-subtitle: \"FUN - FEAR - FINANCE.\";\n}\n\n#page-content { padding-top:0; }\n\n#breadcrumbs { display: none !important; }\n\n#page-title { display: none !important; }\n\n/* Stylized addendum blocks: */\n.addendum {\n    margin: 0% 9% 0% 7%;\n    padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;\n    background-color: #f2f2f2;\n}\n\n.addendum2 {\n    margin: 0% 14% 0% 12%;\n    padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;\n    background-color: #f4efef;\n  border-width: 9px;\n  border-style: double;\n  border-color: #ce6666 #aa1212;\n}\n\n.text-part > .main-class {\nmargin-left: 0em;\n}\n\n/* Character tag styles */\n.characterTag {\n  letter-spacing:0.2rem;\n  font-weight:bold;\n  text-decoration:underline;\n  line-height:inherit;\n  text-transform:uppercase;\n  font-size: 90%;\n  padding-right: 0.5rem;\n}\n\n/* Custom collapsible style */\n#page-content a.collapsible-block-link {\n  padding-left: 1em;\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n/* Centers author credit line */\n.authorlink-wrapper {\n  margin: auto;\n  width: fit-content;\n}\n\n/* Fixes Addendum blocks margins for mobile viewing */\n@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n\n\n    .addendum {\n        margin: 0% 4% 0% 4%;\n    }\n    .addendum2 {\n        margin: 0% 4% 0% 4%;\n    }\n\n}\n[[/module]]",
