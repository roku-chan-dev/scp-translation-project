Changes to this particular documentation (if any) will be identified by revision code(s) and accurately transcribed later within this manual (see **Index 7.4: SCP-7346 Revision History**). With written consent from the acting HCML Supervising Lead, this documentation will also act as a substitute for traditional Secure, Contain, and Protect anomalous procedure document(s), due to its innate descriptions and established containment of paranormal technologies used throughout the entirety of SCP-7346.\n\n+ **2 | OPERATING PROCEDURES**\n+++ **2.1 | General Chronometric Analysis**\nAll chronometric procedures are centralized under the SynCheck Integrated Program within SCP-7346. 200 caesium-133 standard clocks installed throughout SCP-7346 and offsite locations provide a long-lived reference frame in the event of temporal distortion around SCP-7346. Offsite clocks include auxiliary nuclear batteries, permitting uninterrupted operation without maintenance for up to 28,000 years via carbon-14 graphite block sources. \n\nIn the event of catastrophic or advanced temporal distortion, or the failure of all offsite atomic clocks, further chronometric studies may be conducted via equipment, apparatuses, and drones within SCP-7346. See **Index 12.2: RetCon-Applicable TK-Class Events and Subevents** for more information. It is recommended that at least 3 chronometric studies be conducted for a comprehensive analysis of contemporary chronology. The recommended priority for these studies is:\n\n* General geochronometry, radiochronometry\n* Astronomical records\n* Dendrochronology\n* Ancillary operations and processes\n\n\nFor a detailed summary of radiochronometric procedures, refer to **Index 22.1: Overview of Rutherford Nuclear Forensics Procedures**.\n\nFor a detailed summary of ice core processing and analysis, refer to **Index 22.4: Ancillary Operations, Drygalski Processes**.\n\nFor a detailed summary of dendrochronological procedures, refer to **Index 26.2: Dendrochronological Procedures, Mendel to Theophrastus**.

The continued maintenance of anchor points at numerous heritage sites in the Free Port has been secured in exchange for several Byzantium-class bureaucratohazards, which include:\n\n* Battle of Portlands and 7th Occult War Memorial\n* Old Deer College\n* Shadow Lighthouse Octagram\n* {{15 others}}\n\nJurisdiction over the maintenance of several Sidhe monuments and memorials have been formally transferred to the genius loci of the Free Port due to the evaporation of the remaining Sidhe ghost at some point in the past millennium.\n\nNoting that the genius loci has requested more complex offerings in the next negotiation cycle.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"aic\"]]\nInteresting fellow, the Mayor. Quite the novel method of communication.\n\nMildly concerning that they're getting better at cracking bureaucratohazards.

All records are hereby consistent historical records.\n# **Climate Health (88.7%):** The global climate is in a state of gradual stabilization, with fewer extreme events and shorter disruptions.\n# **Air Quality (86.2%):** The atmosphere sees notable improvements in pollution levels, resulting in enhanced overall air quality and reduced environmental risks.\n# **Biodiversity and Ecosystems (91.4%):** Natural ecosystems experience reduced stressors, leading to a stable recovery in biodiversity\n# **Deforestation and Land Use (88.1%):** Deforestation rates have significantly slowed, benefiting ecosystems, organisms, and carbon sequestration efforts. \n# **Ocean Health (90.3%):** Environmental pressures have eased, resulting in a significant recovery in ocean health and marine life throughout the world.\n# **Sustainability Index:** The sustainability index holds at 27.7%. The sustainability index shows substantial improvement.
