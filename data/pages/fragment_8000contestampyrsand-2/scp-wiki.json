Bizarre mail like this had been bombarding Site-111 and all the nearby facilities for weeks now, claiming to be from a self-proclaimed \"para-tourism\" agency with access to Ways leading into the long-sanctioned and forbidden Greater Earth. Fritz had placed himself in charge of deciphering their messages, finding both the presumably massive-scale breach of Veil security implied by the self-proclaimed agency's ability to go back and forth from the Outer Realms and the Foundation's oddly lax response to it all deeply concerning. No Foundation facility in the modern world still received snail-mail anyhow; since they were the only ones who delivered to the Site's mailbox, he had fast gained the joking reputation as the only one who checked it.\n\nThe letters and postcards taunted them, the wardens who held the keys that locked the planet away from itself and its magic, by offering to show them everything they denied themselves and the world. They had chosen the name Sheba -- the Queen of Sheba being the biblical figure who came to Jerusalem bearing gifts for King Solomon -- he suspected, because they must have fancied themselves the enlightened nobles overseeing a sickly, Veiled world, and out of their endless generosity had chosen to offer gifts tempting knowledge of the World-Left-Behind to the ignorant footsoldiers in the ranks of that great totality whose control they so loathed in the hopes that they would change their ways.\n\nThey had come like Pandora, offering a bounty that when opened would unleash the vexing plagues that would be the Jailors' undoing. Rather, this was how he suspected they thought of themselves.\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"classification_memo\"]]\n\nThe Veil-threatening entity sending communications to Foundation Sites starting with the incident on 27 May 2022 has tentatively been classified GoI-8181-P.

Please consult the attached document for additional information.\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nGiven the recent emergence of GoI-8181-P and the threat that its outreach capabilities could become global, the Foundation has seen it fit to determine whether GoI-8181-P indeed possesses metaspatial transport abilities or methods capable of breaching from baseline reality into congruospatial anomalogeographic subdimensions in violation of the relevant 1881 charter on sanctioning of passage between the Veiled world and non-authorized accessory paranormal frontiers. \n\nTo this end, it has been deemed necessary for a field mission to attempt use of GoI-8181-P's services and determine if their purported methods of extradimensional transport are valid. Additionally, relevant authorities have authorized this mission, deemed the Lost Paths Initiative as an opportunity for the chosen agent(s) to explore and rediscover key-interest areas of the Outer Frontiers to acquire information in areas where that currently available to the Foundation may be outdated. \n\nThe advising Extradimensional Relations Division has worked in collaboration with Field Operations chiefs to arrive at the attached agent recommended for the Lost Paths Initiative. We believe the chosen operative's extensive field proficiency in unpredictable, poorly-mapped and/or hostile environments combined with his dual academic experience in pre-Veil anomalous matters will prove very complementary to the stipulations of the initiative; the agent in question should be made aware, however, that the task required of him will constitute outreach into anomalous frontier dimensions long uncontacted by the Foundation or any other known baseline actor, carrying extensive potential risks from lack of experience, available information regarding, and Foundation presence in these areas. If he wishes to reject the mission, my office must be informed as such by Saturday at 12:00 PM.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSincerely,\nCyrus\nSecure, Contain, Protect.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n**5/10/2022**\n\nApparently the Foundation has chosen me to take up whoever's sending those Sheba & Co. flyers on their offer. Command needs somebody to go where they say in their messages to see if they actually have a stable gate to the Outer World and then report accordingly so it can be disabled. Those guys have been harassing us with all sorts of weird, cryptic invitations for weeks; my bets are on some sort of meta-embodiment of our Veil haunting us, assuming they aren't a legit company. It isn't impossible they're just some thusfar-uncontacted extradimensional GoI with no idea who they're sending their mailers to, but then you'd probably expect they'd try to contact the public. Instead, whatever these guys are -- people? entities? UAEs? unknown Veiled actors? the correct term aside -- they //only// do their magic spam mail gimmick on our facilities, and so targetedly they just have to be playing with us somehow. Wouldn't be unexpected -- more and more small GoIs popping out of the woodworks and thinking they can mess with us as some sort of sick joke lately, especially since the Impasse for some reason.\n\nAnyhow, assuming I'm not killed outright, I actually expect to stay out in the great beyond for quite a while. If what 8181-P's messages say is true, with the places they advertise, I'd be the first human from the Prime Earth to go so far out into the Outer World since we closed them off -- at least so far as the Foundation knows, anyway. My duties are to record whatever I see out there and hope I get back alive to return it: telecomms aren't believed to work since we cut the Hyperways, so I've brought a big stack of leather notebooks instead. Once they leave me at my destination, I'll hit all the nearby areas to take notes and make observations; just base-level review for curiosity, since we haven't checked on what's going on out there presumably for over a century.\n\nI'll check in later if I need to get more thoughts down. No time to process now, though -- work to be done. I'm stepping into the untamed wilds the Foundation locked out and hasn't gone back in for well over a century; there must have been a reason why they did, and I'm taking every necessary precaution to be ready for whatever it is.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:id-card |css=--\n|photo=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/ASCAN_2021_Class_Wilderness_Survival_Training_-_Jack_Hathaway.jpg/640px-ASCAN_2021_Class_Wilderness_Survival_Training_-_Jack_Hathaway.jpg\n|level=3\n|name=Fritz Williams\n|dept=Field Expeditions\n|position=Agent\n|id-number= 6690-710350\n|expiry= 8/19/2029\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n\nAgent Fritz has served with the Foundation in various field ops capacities for over 20 years. He is permanently affiliated with no Task Force and his record indicates he is conventionally best as a solo non-combat asset, with prior deployments mostly involving locating or surveilling objects that will not require immediate combat engagement in anomalous environments, as well as surveying anomalous locations that are poorly-mapped and unpredictable. To this end he has repeatedly gained accreditation in previous deployments as adaptable and a highly-skilled survivalist; file indicates basic physical combat training (despite a mainly non-combat deployment record), proficiency in improvised anti-thaumatological techniques, and at least basic knowledge of 20 or more anomalous and non-anomalous languages.\n\nWe recommend him on the basis that the environs covered by the Lost Paths Initiative are not extensively recorded or understood and will likely be dangerous or otherwise unpredictable, and humbly request the directorship of Site-111 and associated central authorities at the Department of Field Expeditions to grant us Agent Fritz as the subject of the Initiative and extradite him to Dimensional Outpost-1981 as soon as is convenient.\n\nFritz and the other candidates before him have already been inoculated with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal Antimeme-001] counteractant and amnesticized; thus, he is already proofed against the possibility of discovering that \"Sheba & Co. Paranormalcy\", the agency invented to justify this breach in the Foundation's traditional policy of isolation against the Outer Realms for the sake of necessary exploration and inquiry, is indeed a Foundation front company.\n\nConcludingly, we ascertain that Agent Fritz will provide the crucial human element necessary to provide the Extradimensional Relations Division with a body of knowledge sufficient enough that, augmented with our current drone surveillance, Greater Earth can soon be comprehensively mapped and more fully understood by all for the good of the Foundation.\n\n[[=]]\n**//Secure, Contain, Protect.//**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 135%;\"]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8181/offset/2 |Act
