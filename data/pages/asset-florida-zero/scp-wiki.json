SCP-999 instances, when consumed orally, enter into a mutualistic relationship with their host. In exchange for the nutrients required for SCP-999 instances to mature, SCP-999 instances secrete endorphins that cause instantaneous, persistent and continual sensations of euphoria and overall 'happiness'.\n\nSCP-999 instances are found within a solution known as Asset 'Florida Zero', a necessary part of the SCP-999 reproductive process.\n\n**Addendum 1:** Asset 'Florida Zero'\n\n**Asset 'Florida Zero':** Asset 'Florida Zero' refers to both the product replacing Asset 'Florida Orange', Asset 'Florida Grey', and all other variants or derivatives, and the processing facilities utilized in its creation. Tests have determined that the efficacy, permanency, and potency of Asset 'Florida Zero' is multitudes greater than that of previous formulations, as well as the original effects of SCP-999-X.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=florida_zero.jpg|\n    caption=Asset 'Florida Zero' in a glass.|\n    align=left|    \n    width=300px|\n]]\n\nProcessing Facilities and Blood Donation Centers are to be installed in every Foundation site, within the next year. In 80% of Foundation sites, processing facilities have already been installed and integrated directly into all plumbing and water filtration systems within the site. Asset 'Florida Zero' is entirely self-sufficient after the initial installation, and has reduced Foundation Mental Health Services usage by over 99.8%. Due to the overwhelming benefits and the sustainable nature of 'Florida Zero', it is expected to permanently address all Foundation hydration needs.\n@@ @@\n\n**SCP-999 Lifecycle:** The SCP-999 reproductive lifecycle is what allows the anomalous properties of Asset 'Florida Zero'. This process is detailed below:\n\n# Initial Asset 'Florida Zero' solution is to be distributed into a given Foundation site's water supply and filtration systems, once Asset 'Florida Zero' processing facilities are functional.\n# SCP-999 instances are consumed through oral ingestion of Asset 'Florida Zero', a fluid that is nearly indistinguishable from water.\n# SCP-999 instances enter into a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts, exchanging nutrients for endorphins -- SCP-999 instances mature within a human host over a 14 day period.\n# During the monthly mandatory blood donation, between 1 pint and 1 gallon of blood[[footnote]] This amount of blood carries between 1 million to 1 billion SCP-999 instances. [[/footnote]] will be collected from each Foundation employee, and pumped to Asset 'Florida Zero' processing stations.\n# SCP-999-rich blood is converted into Asset 'Florida Zero' via the SCP-999 maturation process. The resulting product is produced at a 3:1 ratio, with three gallons of Asset 'Florida Zero' produced per gallon consumed. SCP-999 instances are now ready to begin the cycle again.\n\nIt is estimated that by the end of the year, all Foundation sites will feature fully integrated Asset 'Florida Zero' processing centers. Within the next 12 months, the Foundation will be able to provide potable water to all of humanity. Projections estimate that a total replacement of all water on earth by Asset 'Florida Zero' will take between three to five years, at the current rates.\n\nThis is a good thing.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= tdmoose@scp.int\n|to= miverson@scp.int\n|cc= none\n|subject= What did you do to me\n]]\nWhat the fuck did you do to me Michelle.
