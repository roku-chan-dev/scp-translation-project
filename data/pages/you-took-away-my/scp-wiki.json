Pixel sent us this comedy video he found that ve thought we would find funny. They sent us a version with sprites of characters from a game they like on the screen, in place of the comedian. I don’t mind. The content is the same either way. I’m very particular about what comedians I find funny. Some have the habit of having one good routine, but the rest are littered with homophobic and transphobic rhetoric. But this one is good. Gutz is laying with his head against my chest, his arms draped around my sides. It’s comfortable. We do this whenever I come over and have something to watch.//\n\n//We continue to watch the video, laughing and commenting on the content. The video comes to an end.//\n\n//“That was a good one.” I say. I expect Gutz to reply, but it doesn’t.//\n\n//“Gutz?” I look down. They’re gone. I sit up, looking around the room. I jump off the bed, running to the door, and throw it open. There’s nothing but darkness. The room behind me disappears.//\n\n//“GUTZ!” I call. I continue to call his name to no avail. For a split second, I can see a figure in the darkness. I run towards it, and reach out my hand.//\n\nMy eyes snap open. My hand is outstretched. I put my hand under my head. I lay there for a good few minutes, staring at the bedsheet. Just another one of those dreams. Those dreams where we were together, and everything was normal. But then he disappeared. I wish I could just have a happy dream. One without the disappearing parts. They were all too real.\n\n\nI push myself out of bed. I’m definitely coming back, like I do every morning. I just lay in bed for at least an hour, doing nothing. But I can try to get some food first today. I walk to the kitchen, barely coherent. Feels like I'm going through the motions. Every day is like that now. I open the cabinet and grab that box of oat cereal I bought to convince myself I’m eating healthier, trying to forget that it has the same amount of sugar as that chocolate cereal I like. I need to buy healthier breakfast foods. Or just healthy foods in general. I need to go back to a real grocery store for once, and not that Dollar General that’s five minutes away.\n\nI stare at the box for a second before walking over to the cabinet I keep the bowls in. I open it. //Oh yeah.// My eyes drift over to the dishwasher. I open it, eyeing the four cereal bowls I own entangled with some of my other dishes. I don’t remember how long it’s been since I’ve done the dishes. Probably since before Gutz disappeared. I need to run it, but then that means the sink will pile up again. I look back at the cereal box. I’ll just eat it straight out of the bag. There goes my attempt to do something normal, for once. I go back to my room again and lie down on my bed. I eat a few handfuls of cereal, but I just can't be bothered. I drop the box off the side of my bed, hearing some of the cereal spill out. //Oh well.// I put my hand under my head again, returning to just staring at the bed sheet. I don’t know how much time passes.\n\n[[=image Xander.png width=\"350px\"]]\n\nI groan, grabbing my phone. It’s about time I check it.

I’ve been putting off doing this. I’m afraid of what I’ll find. But, if there was something to find, wouldn’t the police report it to me or at least Aaron? Who knows, honestly. I wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t even trying to find them. I’ve heard countless true crime cases that Damien shared with me of the police calling disappearances as runaways and sitting on their asses the whole time.\n\nI sit up, staring at the wall in front of my bed, where the artwork Gutz did for me was displayed. The ones it did of us together are my favorites. I always told them I wish we could have a photograph of us together. But he always said the artwork was the best I’d get. Which wasn’t an issue for me. Their art is so stylized, I love how they draw us. But now these drawings are all I have. I shake my head, letting myself come back to the present.\n\n[[=image XG.png width=\"350px\"]]\n\n“C’mon Xander. Let’s go.” I say to myself.\n\n------\n\nI had to park a decent bit away to avoid suspicion. I’ve been walking for five minutes. I’ve not been getting out of my bed much, so my muscles have started to weaken. I sigh in relief as I approach the back gate. I opened the gate, actually being happy for once that Gutz refused to get a lock installed on the gate. I trudged through all the dead leaves that had been here for far past their prime, up to the back door. I slip the key out of my jacket pocket, fiddling with the keychain I had it attached to, sticking it inside the lock. I take a deep breath. You can do this, Xander. I turn the lock, gently opening the door. I slip the key back into my pocket, closing the door softly behind me.\n\nI’m suddenly hit with this putrid smell, causing me to slap my hand over my nose and mouth. I cautiously walk further into the kitchen. The sink was piled with dishes coated in food and mold. I could see dozens of gnats, flies, and roaches crawling amongst the dishes and counter covered in wrappers for frozen meals, chips, and soda cans. The garbage can was stuffed open with trash that clearly didn’t fit, extra wrappers and trash pulling up on the floor next to it. I feel a pain in my heart. This was just… depressing. //Is this why Gutz was so reluctant to have me over?// I… can’t spend too much time here. \n\nI make my way to the bedroom, opening the door. I am greeted with more garbage, the same sight of food wrappers, soda cans, and leftovers piling on the ground next to their bed. I felt tears brim my eyes. It really got this bad.\n\n//They felt like they couldn’t tell me.//\n\nI wipe my eyes, and breathe in through my nose. I can’t do this now. I decide to breathe in through my mouth, the smell of the garbage was overwhelming, giving me a headache. I walked over to the nightstand. No phone, no tablet, no computer. But his chargers were still here. That didn’t make sense. His car was totaled, so he couldn’t have driven it. He has a charger in his car. So this would make sense if they had their car, but they don’t. I turn to his bed, reaching my hand inside the pillow case, feeling a sinking feeling upon feeling the crease of the envelope. //Why was it still here? If they ran away, for sure they’d take it. There’s no reason he wouldn’t, right?// I hesitate for a moment before deciding to grab the envelope, slipping it into my pocket.\n\nI stand back for a second, eyeing the room as a whole. It didn’t look like anything except his electronics were missing. I walk over to the desk, looking in one of the compartments underneath. His sketchbooks are still here. I begin to look at each cover, taking the sketch books out from the compartment, laying them out on the desk. His two most recent ones were missing. I don’t understand. Why? The one he used right before recent was almost full. I looked around the rest of the area. It seems like all of his art supplies are still here, even his pocket kit. //Why take the sketchbooks and not any supplies?// This doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nI suddenly hear a noise. A car pulled up in front of the house. I peeked out the window, making sure to only ever so slightly move the curtain. I felt my blood go cold. A police car. Shit. They walked up to the door. //How did they know that I was here? What the fuck? Goddamnit, think, Xander!// I rush to put the sketchbooks back where I found them. I heard them fiddling with the doorknob. I gun it to the garage door, attempting to make my steps as light as possible. I stare at the front door as I nervously open the door as quietly as I can. Right as I shut the garage door behind me, I hear the front door open. I’d sigh in relief if it wouldn’t be so loud. I’m still holding my breath. This will only buy me so much time. I need to think of a way to get out. I look above me. The attic. But it would surely make a noise if I entered, right? Shiiit. What do I do?\n\nI hear them call to each other.\n\n“No one in here!” I hear through the door.\n\n“I heard something, there’s gotta be someone here.”\n\n//It doesn’t make sense to me how they even knew! God… what to do. Maybe…// I glance around. I notice the closet at the back of the garage. It’s packed full with boxes. So if the police have scouted out the house, they wouldn’t assume a person could fit. I don’t know how much of this house they’ve explored. But, it’s worth a shot. Before I start for the back, I have an idea. I can mislead them. I'm tall enough that when I'm standing on the bench, I can pull the string on the attic hatch, juuuuuust a tad. To lead them there.\n\nI hurry off the bench, then creep to the back of the garage, sweating as I fiddle with the crack in the door, which was luckily open just enough already for me to barely squeeze myself inside. I feel the boxes poking me everywhere, my ribs hurting as I pressed against the door. I was just able to fit inside. I’m definitely crushing what ever is in these. Sorry, Gutz.\n\nI hear the garage door open.\n\n“Is anyone here? This is an active crime scene!” One of the police officers call. “Look everywhere!” They call.\n\nI’m holding my breath, snapping my eyes shut in fear. Look, God, I know I’m not your biggest fan, but please do me a favor here.\n\nI hear one of the officers get closer. I can’t really tell what they’re doing. Please don’t find me please don’t find me please don’t find me—\n\nThey fiddle with the door. “Door’s pretty jammed, looks like it’s just boxes.” I can hear them leaving the area. “Hey, the attic hatch wasn’t like that last time! Pull the attic and look inside!”\n\nI bit my tongue to stop myself from making any sound. I can hear them pulling the stairs from the attic. I hear steps on the attic.\n\n“I’ll look in the attic. Tell me if you see any sign of We—“\n\n“Of an intruder. Yes.”\n\nI feel my entire body freeze. If I’m not mistaken, that officer was going to say “Wells”.\n\n//Do they know it’s me?//\n\nI sit listening to the sounds around me. I must start to dissociate, blankly listening to the sounds around me. Eventually, I hear the sound of someone coming down from the attic.\n\n“There’s no one up there. He must have exited the house before we entered.”\n\n“But we would’ve seen him exit out the back!” \n\n“True, Carter and Ellis checked the back, no sign of him. When we get back to control we can check the cameras to see if he was in the house.”\n\n//Cameras? They put fucking cameras in the house? Why? Jesus Christ, I can never come back. How am I ever gonna get out?//\n\n“Come on, let’s go regroup out front. We can decide what to do after we discuss.”\n\nThe two officers exited. It was a good minute until I exhaled. //Thank fucking god. I thought I was done for.// I wait another ten minutes until I decide it’s probably safe. I squeeze myself out of the closet the same way I entered, and fall to the ground, catching myself on my hands and knees.\n\n“Jesus Christ that hurts!” I exclaim, pushing myself to stand. I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ve got some bruises from those boxes poking me. I re-enter the house, incredibly nervous with my newfound knowledge of cameras. I sprint to the door I entered from, slipping out the back. I see no police cars. Still, I book it to my car, only exhaling again once I’m safely inside. I sit there for a few moments, allowing my breath to catch up.\n\n“God fucking damnit. What am I dealing with?”\n\n------\n\n“Okay okay, //now// you can ask questions,” I say. As soon as I explained that things were strange, Pixel, Lexi, Flower, Shrimp, and Ren all agreed to call.\n\n“So you hid in the closet the whole time? And they didn’t find you? Fucking damn! Stupid pigs!” Pixel exclaims.\n\n“And they appeared to have been aware that it was you. How did they assume this?” Ren asks.\n\n“That’s the thing, I don’t know,” I replied honestly. “It fucking freaks me out.”\n\n“This makes me think something else is going on.” Flower points out. “Like, I don’t know. But the fact that they knew it was you is weird.”\n\n“I’m just really glad you’re safe,” Lexi says in her usual soft tone. “Please double-check to make sure you didn't get hurt more than you thought.”\n\n“I checked. Just a bruise or so. I’m fine.” I ensured. Physically, mostly. I sighed. “I’m just left with so many questions.”\n\n“I think we all are.” Shrimp agrees.\n\nThe group of them all made sounds of agreement.\n\n“Well, I think if you go back, you destroy the cameras.” Pixel suggests.\n\n“Are you crazy? He almost got caught as is!” Lexi exclaims. “TV, I really think you should just take this as a sign to not go back. You could’ve gotten hurt, or in trouble.”\n\n“But he can’t just stop looking! Something is fishy about this!” Pixel argues back.\n\n“How about we let Xander decide,” Flower says. By the way her voice got lower, I could tell Keisuke said that.\n\n“Yeah…” I reply. I was going to say something else, but there was a knock at my door. “Ah shit. Let me go see what that is.” I slip off the bed, then walk to up the front door, looking through the peephole, audibly gasping. “It’s the cops!” I exclaim in a whisper.\n\n“Oh my god! I wonder if they have news!” Shrimp exclaims.\n\n“Or if they followed you home!” Lexi worries.\n\n“Everyone, mute. I’ll let you listen.” I instruct. After I saw the mute icon next to each of their names, I slip my phone into my jacket pocket. I open the door.\n\n“Afternoon, officer,” I say, trying not to let my nerves affect me.\n\n“Hello, Mr. Wells. We wanted to ask you a couple of questions regarding Jonathan Everett.” The police officer informs.\n\n“Sure, anything. Do you uh… have any updates regarding the case? Um… what may have happened to him?” I step aside, allowing the two officers to enter. I close the door behind them.\n\n“I am Officer Evans, this is Officer Lee.” One of the officers informs as we settle at the kitchen table.\n\nI nodded. “Nice to meet you. What was it that you wanted to ask me?” I ask. It could be a lot of things.\n\n“It has come to our attention that a spare key exists for Mr. Everett’s home. We would like to know if you are in possession of this spare. His house is an active crime scene, so entrance is prohibited.” Evans explains.\n\nI feel something shake within me. Did they know? I nodded slowly. “Yes. I have a key. Um, I can go get that.” I say shakily. //Crap. That is my last hope.//\n\n“That would be great.” Lee replies.\n\nI walked to my bedroom. I pulled out my phone.\n\n#VC-CHAT\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username=🦐🦐🦐🦐\n|msg-time=06/01/2022 12:20 pm\n]]\nCRAPPPPPP\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=seven\n|username=#1 shin simp🧣\n|msg-time=06/01/2022 12:20 pm\n]]\nOH MY HOOODID\nGODISS\nNOIOO\nUR KEY\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=eight\n|username=QUEEN OF CRINGE\n|msg-time=06/01/2022 12:20 pm\n]]\nDo they know? 😥\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=three\n|username= Flowerpx🌸[🌸🌸]\n|msg-time=06/01/2022 12:20 pm\n]]\nEveryone calm!

I take a picture, just in case I could get in replicated. I slipped my phone back into my pocket. My thoughts were rushing in so fast. //Did they know? Are they aware? What prompted them to ask now? Am I gonna get in trouble?// I shove my thoughts down as I walk back to the kitchen, sitting back at the table.\n\n“Here you are.” I slip the key over to Evans, feeling how badly I just wanted to not let go of that key as I remove my fingers from it.\n\n“Thank you. We will return it to you in the case that Mr. Everett is returned safely home.”\n\n//Returned safely home.// How badly I wish that would happen. I nod. “Is that all?”\n\nLee nods. “We unfortunately have no updates other than that. We thank you for your cooperation.”\n\nI nod absently, moving through the motions as I escorted them out, watching as my last hope left my vicinity.\n\n“They’re gone. You can all unmute.” I say.\n\nEveryone begins to talk over each other.\n\n[[=image Call.png width=\"350px\"]]\n\n“I can’t fucking believe those shitheads!” Pixel starts.\n\n“They took the key! What will you do?” Shrimp exclaims.\n\n“Everyone! Calm down!” Flower reminds.\n\n“What if they knew?” Lexi worries.\n\n“Then they would have told him.” Ren reasons. “It seems it was just a matter of security.”\n\n“But why within an hour of his arrival home?” Lexi replies.\n\n“Everyone!” Flower exclaims louder with more authority. “Calm down!”\n\n“It’s okay,” I say calmly. I can feel my brain began to wander, the dissociation kicking in. “I think I just need to be alone right now.”\n\n“We get it, TV. We’ll see you in a bit, okay?” Flower says kindly.\n\n“Yeah,” I reply. I let everyone say their goodbyes, then left the call. I wandered back to my room, laying on the bed.\n\nThis feels like hell. My last connection, my last way to get answers. It was gone. I pulled the envelope out of my pocket and removed the contents. I stared at it for who knows how long. It takes me a little bit to notice that I started to cry. I hug the envelope contents against my chest, allowing myself to just be in the moment, my tears getting heavier. I feel something click within me. Anger. Despite my shaky hands, I carefully put the contents of the envelope back, setting it on my nightstand. I take a deep breath, closing my eyes.\n\nI scream as loud as I can.\n\nI scream for as long as I can without taking another breath, angrily throwing pillows off of my bed onto the ground. When I finish, I can feel myself trembling. I feel sick. //This isn't fair. Why is this happening, anyway?//\n\n\"Fucking-- I don't know what the hell is going on! Whoever the fuck is in charge of things, fuck you! Fuck you for doing this to us! //Fuck you//!\" I scream vehemently. I lay down on my bed, feeling dehydrated and tired.\n\nIt's clear that things will never get any easier.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **SURVEILLANCE REPORT**\n----\n**DATE:** 06/01/2022\n\n**TIME:** 11:13 to 11:52; 00:39 Total\n\n**SUBJECT(S) MONITORED:** LOI-6822 (SCP-7262's Former Residence)\n----\n\nAt approximately 11:13, POI-8923 (Xander R.
