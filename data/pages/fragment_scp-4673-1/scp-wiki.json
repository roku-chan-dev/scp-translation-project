You may now optionally review this containment file.\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4673\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Secure Containment Procedures:** Every 60 days, every Foundation employee must affirm, in writing or verbally, that they are not Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick. This affirmation may be done via a predesignated email link, or to their immediate superior in person, writing, or over radio communication. Foundation supervisors are required to file the responses of their direct reports having completed this task before the 60th day of each 90-day period.\n\nAccess to this containment file must be held behind an affirmation that the user attempting to access this file is not Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick.\n\nExternal affairs is advised to be certain that any person being processed for intake as new Foundation personnel is not named Edward Carter Hardwick. \n\nAny Foundation personnel claiming to be Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick should be reported to site security for immediate termination. Claims that such an utterance were unintentional, humorous, or in jest are not defenses against this protocol.\n\nIn the unlikely event of the manifestation of SCP-4673-A, they are not to be engaged and their target should be terminated immediately. If this is not possible, SCP-4673-A should be allowed to proceed to their target without resistance. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4673 is the identity of Edward Carter Hardwick, born July 7, 1987. Members of the Foundation who are unaware of the nature of SCP-4673 may, without warning, manifest SCP-4673. At such a time, their own identity slowly becomes overwritten with SCP-4673. Initial effects include identifying with the name Edward Carter Hardwick, or exhibiting behaviors and mannerisms consistent with Edward Carter Hardwick. If there is no intervention at this point, they will begin to lose memories of their own identity as SCP-4673 parasitically consumes their psyche. Once this process is complete, SCP-4673 will cause a memetic response in others around the subject, who will begin to identify the subject as Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick. At this point, thirteen humanoid entities will manifest within a 1 mile radius of the subject, collectively designated SCP-4673-A.\n\nSCP-4673 only impacts Foundation personnel, and will not manifest on any Foundation agent who makes a conscious effort to declare they are not Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick on a regular basis, usually 90 days. SCP-4673 does not impact D-Class Personnel.\n\n**Addenda 4673.1: SCP-4673-A**\nSCP-4673-A is a paramilitary group consisting of what appear to be eleven males and two females in modern and advanced tactical gear. SCP-4673-A is armed with high explosives, heavy firearms, and numerous anomalous and non-anomalous equipment including:\n\n* (13) SIG Sauer M17 service pistols\n* (8) Colt M4A1 Carbine rifles with ACOG optic and vertical forward grip\n* (3) Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns\n* (1) U.S.-spec AT-4 Anti-tank weapon capable of firing repeatedly without reload\n* (1) Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle (EBR)\n* (7) MM-1 \"Minimore\" anti-personnel devices\n* an apparently unlimited number of M67 grenades\n\nOn more than one occasion, SCP-4673-A have manifested inside a Foundation Security site. Their only motivation is to kill Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick.\n\nMembers of SCP-4673-A appear to be as vulnerable to damage as a living human in similar gear would be, but upon death they vanish and instantaneously remanifest nearby fully restocked and with no prior injury. This effect will also occur if they are rendered unconscious, detained and unable to escape, or physically blocked from reaching Edward Carter Hardwick. Their tactical operation will continue until the target is reached, overwhelming their enemies through sheer attrition. Upon the death of Edward Carter Hardwick, SCP-4673-A will demanifest.\n\n**Addenda 4673.2: Edward Carter Hardwick**\n\nEdward Carter Hardwick was, as far as Foundation records indicate, employed by the Covert Operations Division from 2013 to 2019 as an embedded agent in occult paramilitary organization ████████████████ in an attempt to neutralize their operations. During the time of said operation, Hardwick was involved in numerous situations involving the organization's experimentation with infohazardous materials and rituals. (See Field Operations Log 554-FK-101.B)\n\nIn late 2019, Hardwick's cover was compromised by a Foundation double agent, Mr. Woolton (See below). Hardwick was confronted by leading members of ████████████████ and, as a last resort, performed an as-yet-unknown memetic modification ritual on himself and possibly his attackers.\n\n**Addenda 4673.3: Security Footage: Exit interview with Mr. Woolton**\n\n> Interviewer: Cpt. Greg Reynold, Site-91\n> Interviewee: Mr. Woolton, a Field Operations Handler for the Foundation\n> \n> **Reynold:** How long were you working for ████████████████?\n> \n> **Woolton:** You don't understand. I...I...\n> \n> **Reynold:** You burned Hardwick. And now he's...I don't even know. Do you?\n> \n> **██████:** I...I'm...\n> \n> **Reynold:** What did you get out of it? Did they pay you? Give you anomalous goodie bags?\n> \n> **Hardwick:** I'm...Edward Hardwick.\n> \n> **Reynold:** What?\n> \n> //SCP-4673-A breaches the other side of the room. Cpt. Reynold and Foundation Agent Edward Carter Hardwick are fatally struck by a number of bullets and SCP-4673-A demanifests.//\n[[/collapsible]]",
