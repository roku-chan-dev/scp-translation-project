They're probably gone. Lost to their own horrors. But because of a girl, we live on. She's down the hall now. She's crying out for a friend. She needs to know what's happening.\n\nI know what must be done, but what's the point? There's hardly anyone left alive here, and there's no one left alive outside. I want to let it end. I can't carry this burden any longer.\n\nCowardice creeps into my mind. If I shirk my responsibility, I'll die and so will everyone else. I won't accept the blame for the death of our species. \n\nI'll leave it to chance. Cold impartial chance. I'll flip a coin. This time I'll follow through.\n\nHeads, I go down the hall and do my job. Tails, and I let the world burn.\n\nThe toss is freeing. To have fate slip from my hands. To let the heavy burden fall, just for a moment.\n\nBut is it worth it? Tossing away my humanity? Counting on a tarnished coin to give me a glimmer of hope?\n\nIt's old. Older than I am. Yet it spins deftly in the air. Heads, tails, and heads again. It falls to the table. \n\nTails.\n\nTails and I let the world burn the rest of the way down. \n\nI worry. About my humanity. About the world. About the future. About hope itself. But none of it means a damn thing anymore. Nothing does except for this moment in time.\n\nThe coin must have landed on heads. After all, it always does.\n\nI press a button and an automated voice blares to almost empty halls.\n\n**Non-authorized personnel, please evacuate the containment area. Procedure 110-Montauk will now begin.**\n\nThe coin was a momentary reprieve. A forlorn hope that I could become something else... or anything other than what I am. \n\nBut I am bound to my duty, and I am bound by my purpose.\n\nThe moment has come, and I become that which I hate.\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fear-alone The storyteller.]\n\nAnd the world spins on.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
