Mitchell//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Department of Humanoid Anomaly Reversion\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n++++ Abstract\n\nSince its inception, the Foundation has observed an exponential increase in the number of humanoid anomalies, in line with population growth of baseline humanity. Financial and sociopolitical backing from public and private institutions is barely keeping pace with the growing demand of containment. It is clear that the current approach is not sustainable.\n\nEvery new anomaly adds to the complexity of the Foundation's containment ecosystem. Due to our limited scientific understanding, resources allocated to each anomaly are justified on an almost qualitative basis i.e. how well the research lead can argue their case, rather than the objective threat posed to humanity at large. Our dependence on the support from [[a style=\"color:var(--darkColor)\" href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8447\"]]external[[/a]] [[a style=\"color:var(--darkColor)\" href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4951\"]]parties[[/a]] further complicates our priorities, as they may lobby for the containment of certain anomalies to forward their interests. The result is the Foundation today, where each dollar spent is scrutinised by anyone who thinks it might hurt their own pockets. \n\nWe propose a radical solution to alleviate this problem - the formation of the Department of Humanoid Anomaly Reversion (DHAR). 63% of known humanoid anomalies were once everyday people that drew the short end of the stick. The Foundation spends in excess of $150 billion a year to maintain their containment. DHAR seeks to neuter their anomalous properties and rehabilitate them as employees of the Foundation, and potentially as productive members of the wider society. We already have the [[a style=\"color:var(--darkColor)\" href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/integration-program-hub\"]]Integration Program[[/a]]. Let's take it a step further.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n= Sympathise, Cure, Free\n\n[[>]]\n- //Kaitlyn Mitchell, Alexander Avenlee//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Location:** Conference Room, Office Sector 3, Site 19\n\n**Context:** Site-19 Directors Planning\n\n----\n\n**Mitchell:** ...so we project a successful implementation to cut down the site's operating costs by up to 24% per annum.

However, there are several phenomena unaccounted for by the Standard Model, such as:\n\n* The abundance of standard baryonic matter over antimatter.\n* Gravitational orbits of stellar objects in the observable universe deviate from predictions. Mainstream science currently attributes these deviations to \"dark matter.\"\n* The existence of anomalies.\n\nThe Foundation quantifies deviations in established physical laws using Humes. We posit that there exists a particle, which we name the //huon//, undetected by modern instruments, which would cover the deficiencies in the Standard Model. As a corollary of this paper, we provide evidence supporting that Hume fluctuations are a symptom or after-effect of the undiscovered //huon// particle.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Location:** Site Director Office, Office Sector 2, Site 19\n\n**Context:** One-on-one catchup\n\n----\n\n**Mitchell:** How much longer will it be?\n\n**Secretary:** Apologies, Director Moose is running overtime on a meeting.

However, Shorten's actions do have a grain of truth behind them.\n\n**Mitchell:** Yes, I know. We're heading towards a budget deficit this year.\n\n**Moose:** Overexpenditure, I can deal with. As the director for the entire site, I'm more worried about employee morale.\n\n**Mitchell:** Ahhh...right. A department's funding correlates with the number of anomalies they need to contain. Neutralising them isn't exactly in their best interests.\n\n**Moose:** Yes, and we risk increasing employee redundancy. No-one wants to be out of a job when their assigned skip disappears.\n\n**Mitchell:** And no-one wants a job here if it takes so long to get anything done.

At a macroscopic level, reality-benders are commonly known for exhibiting Hume fields far exceeding this baseline. At the microscopic level, however, we observe that all biological entities have variations in their Hume fields, regardless of their perceived anomalous status.\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that Humic fields behave similarly to the electromagnetic (EM) force from the Standard Model. Each electron orbit around an atom generates a miniature magnetic field. In ferromagnetic material, these orbits are aligned, cooperating to generate a noticeable magnetic field at the macroscopic scale. Non-magnetic substances have misaligned electron orbits, hence their magnetic fields \"cancel out\" at the macroscopic scale. In the same vein, we posit that //huons// in non-anomalous subjects operate at random, generating small counteractive Hume fields. In contrast, anomalous subjects, especially reality-benders, contain //huons// that cooperate at a large scale, and we can detect an increase in their surrounding Hume field.\n\nHolding a magnet in an inverse magnetic field leads to its eventual demagnetisation. Unlike magnetic fields, Humes have no concept of direction. However, Humes detected in the neighbourhood of the subject vary often, particularly when the subject is actively manifesting its anomalous properties. If each minute Humic upsurge is immediately countered with a localised sub-1.00 Hume field, theory predicts that the subject's average Hume field would asymptotically converge towards 1.00. While total reversion is not feasible with this approach, it is low-risk and would be suitable candidate for a proof of concept.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Location:** Bioinformatics Laboratory, Research Sector 14, Site 19\n\n**Context:** Mentoring session\n\n----\n\n//Avenlee and Riley are working in opposite corners of the lab.//\n\n**Avenlee:** Spectrum...hume...gradient.\n\n//Chck tchk kchk.//\n\n**Avenlee:** Overcompensation...contingency?\n\n//Riley removes her headphones and walks toward Avenlee.//\n\n**Riley:** Dr. Avenlee, it's three o'clock.\n\n//Chck tchk kchk.//\n\n**Avenlee:** Huons...balance...delicate.\n\n**Riley:** Sir!\n\n//Riley snaps her fingers in front of Avenlee, and he takes off his headphones.//\n\n**Avenlee:** Hello Jennifer.

His left hand has shifted higher to 1.25, while his head has shifted to 0.64.\n\n**Mitchell:** That doesn't sound good. Do we declare this experiment a failure?\n\n**Avenlee:** No. Yes.

Seven other directors are in attendance.//\n\n**Mitchell:** Welcome everyone. I'd like to preface by apologising for pushing back this meeting. However, I bring good news. My staff have made great strides in the first implementation of the DHARPE. I'm proud to present the initial findings of my team.\n\n//28 minutes of exposition omitted.//\n\n**Mitchell:** Hence, I am formally applying for a further $420,000 to refine our design.\n\n**Moose:** Thank you Mitchell, we'll be reviewing your application. Let's open the floor to questions.\n\n**Lorraine:** I apologise if I misunderstood, but I think you mentioned that the motivation behind DHAR was to integrate anomalies into society? Turning them into compliant zombies doesn't seem aligned with that goal.\n\n**Mitchell:** Yes, it's- we've hit a bit of a hurdle. We plan to iterate on this on our initial design and mitigate its side-effects.\n\n**Clarke:** How would the refinements work? It sounds like your design hinges on this theoretical //huon// particle. It's a shaky assumption to make.\n\n**Shorten:** Seconding Clarke, all the evidence pointing to its existence is circumstantial.\n\n**Mitchell:** All modern theorems were considered outlandish at one point. Matter was thought to be infinitely divisible until we discovered the atom. Hell, we used to believe the Sun orbited Earth.\n\n**Shorten:** And I suppose you believe your Hume theory to be just as revolutionary? That seems presumptuous.\n\n**Mitchell:** That's why we've only allocated resources sufficient for a proof of concept. We'll disband this department if the PoC does not bear fruit. 420,000 is a drop in the ocean compared to Site-19's net expenditure.\n\n= [ 27 minutes of discussion omitted. ]\n\n**Lorraine:** You do realise that by cutting down the number of anomalies, we'll only reduce the government's incentive to fund us.\n\n**Mitchell:** To be blunt, these arguments will lead to the same mistakes made by psychiatric hospitals in the civilian sphere. A lot of them only focus growing the number of patients and keeping them isolated from the wider community, rather than rehabilitation.\n\n**Singer:** Alright, let's say your proof of concept is successful. What do you suppose happens to displaced employees after their assigned skip is reverted? \n\n**Mitchell:** We should be able to reassign them elsewhere. There's always pockets of workforce shortage around here.\n\n**Singer:** Even if that were true-\n\n**Shorten:** Even if it were true, our staff might not agree with this approach. There are researchers who've been working on a skip for years. Seeing all their effort go down the drain won't do good for morale.\n\n**Mitchell:** At the same time, there are mundane anomalies or those with overly complex containment procedures. I'd think staff would be more than happy to be relieved of those responsibilities.\n\n= [ 13 minutes of discussion omitted. ]\n\n**Moose:** Let's get back on topic. How do we prioritise which anomalies to revert first? Those with the greatest financial or logistical burden?\n\n**Mitchell:** Yes, financial payoffs are one aspect. We should be thinking about our moral obligations as well. \n\n**Shorten:** Moral obligations being?\n\n**Mitchell:** Think about it. If you were confined to a cell with little in the way of mental stimulation, how would you feel year after year?\n\n**Lorraine:** I'm not sure if it's a good idea to be humanising these things. It'll get in the way of rational judgement.\n\n= [ 38 minutes of discussion omitted. ]\n\n**Mitchell:** Alright, so one strong example is Dr. Wettle. For those who don't know, Dr. Wettle is an ontokinetic probability sink, and he's given us consent for a reversion trial.\n\n**Moose:** I see where you're going with this. Dr. Wettle has a proven track record in his tenure, despite being anomalous.\n\n**Shorten:** I'm not sure Dr. Wettle is a good example of a candidate. There's been some talk around giving him a Thaumiel classification due to his positive effects on Site-43's productivity.\n\n**Lorraine:** Also, this is just one example. How can you be confident that all of them would function well as staff? How can you be sure an anomaly will remain compliant and obey orders?\n\n**Mitchell:** To gauge that, I'm proposing a gradual roll-out, starting with the more docile anomalies. Besides, this a bit of a moot point, because even regular staff are known for insubordination.\n\n**Clarke:** There's also the cost of upskilling the anomaly to work in whichever position we give to it.\n\n**Mitchell:** Yes, but if we give them the right environment to work in, this cost would pay for itself once they become a self-sufficient, productive employee.\n\n= [ 26 minutes of discussion omitted ]\n\n**Clarke:** For the record, I don't disagree with your idea in principle, but you haven't provided a way for us to navigate the complexity of logistical changes involved.\n\n**Shorten:** Yes, apologies Mitchell, we just need to see something more concrete. At the moment I'm not really convinced by your proposal for a gradual, iterative reversion of the anomalous.\n\n**Mitchell:** Your face is anomalous.\n\n**Shorten:** ...\n\n**Mitchell:** Ah fuck I wasn't muted.\n\n= [ 20 minutes of discussion omitted ]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** @@k.mitchell2@scp.int@@\n**From:** @@g.zehen@scp.int@@\n**cc:** @@t.moose@scp.int@@\n**Subject:** Re: Reversion of SCP-7198\n[[/div]]\n----\nDear Director Mitchell,\n\nApologies for not getting back to you sooner; I've just returned from sabbatical.
