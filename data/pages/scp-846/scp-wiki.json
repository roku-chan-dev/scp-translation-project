SCP-846's containment area is to be guarded by three (3) security personnel at all times. Any unauthorized personnel attempting to access SCP-846 are to be taken into custody and interrogated by on-site security.\n\nActivation of SCP-846 must be authorized by at least three (3) Level 4 personnel. Any testing of SCP-846 is to take place at an on-site firing range.\n\n**Description:** SCP-846 is a plastic toy robot measuring twenty (20) centimeters in height and five (5) centimeters in width. The bottom of SCP-846's right foot bears the text 'Robo-Dude® (Now with Voice Command Action), by Dr. Wondertainment!' Signs of paint chipping and minor damage to SCP-846 indicate that it is roughly ten (10) years old, although attempts to question SCP-846 on this have been ignored. (See Interview 846-1)\n\nSCP-846 is operated using a small 'controller' featuring an 'On/Off' button, a 'Speak' button and a small microphone. SCP-846 is activated using the 'On/Off' button, and verbal communication can be facilitated using the 'Speak' button. SCP-846 appears to be extremely well programmed, if not sentient, and will respond to most questions posed to it.\n\nSCP-846 identifies itself as 'Robo-Dude' and claims that it possesses three hundred and fifty (350) 'Robo-Accessories'. When asked to use one of these accessories, the torso of SCP-846 slides open, revealing the desired accessory, which it then proceeds to utilize. The interior of SCP-846 appears to change completely each time it is asked to utilize an accessory. SCP-846 seems to be unable to utilize these accessories without being instructed to do so.\n\nSCP-846 has claimed to possess, among other things:\n\n* A 'Fire Drill'. (Tested, functioned as a flamethrower.)\n* An 'Energy Laser' (Tested, functioned as a pistol.)\n* A 'Boom Ray' (Tested, functioned as a rocket launcher.)\n* A 'Melt-o-Tron 5000' (Tested, sprayed acid at target)\n* An 'Ultra Plasma Rifle' (Tested, functioned as an assault rifle)\n* A 'Hydrogen Cannon' (Tested, functioned as a children's water gun)\n* 'Bug Spray' (Tested, released unidentified organisms that consumed the wooden target.)\n* A 'Ray Gun' (Tested, released a stream of gamma radiation)\n* An 'Atomic Grenade' (Testing strictly forbidden.)\n\n**History:** SCP-846 was brought into containment after an unknown individual delivered it in a sealed package to [REDACTED], a front company for the SCP Foundation. The label of the package simply read 'MERRY CHRISTMAS'. Agents, upon learning of SCP-846's unusual properties, informed their superiors. SCP-846 was subsequently taken into Foundation custody.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview 846-1\" hide=\"Close Interview\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-846\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. ███████\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> (Dr. ███████ activates SCP-846.)\n> \n> **SCP-846:** THANK YOU FOR PURCHASING YOUR VERY OWN ROBO-DUDE, MADE BY DR.
