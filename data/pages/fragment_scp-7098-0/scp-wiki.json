IT IS RIGHT. THERE WILL BE NO QUESTIONS.@@   @@   DON’T CALL ME. \n\n-- MARY J – BOSS LADY, RECORD STORAGE OFFICE\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** scp-7098\n\n**Class:** Easy\n\n**How We Contain It:** You dont contain it. It doesnt need to be. It only does things here at Site 96. You really shouldt care.\n\n**What Is:** 7098 only happens here. 7098 makes you write real bad whenever you want to write about it. It makes words bad the prunctuatin bad, and the sentence bad to. We tried to tell the Boss here, but they don’t listen because the words are so bad. They laugh or don’t think its real. But enough of us asked so the boss finally got what we were talking about.\n\n**__Stuff__**\n\nOn Wenesday,  I  gave a copyof this to everyone that was gonna work on it. But it was real hard because we used email so much and couldn’t write good to each other. But when we got to leave work on Friday, we all got together and talked it out\n\nWe all agreed that MY firts paper was the best! We also decided that we gotta inclue this talk as other stuff in the file. The Record Office probably wont take us seriously so we called them on the phone to teel them how serious we were. And that this was gonna be a very STUPID SCP. Mrs. Jones didn’t lik it at first but then she was okay with it\n\nBye halloween of the year. SCP7098 hasn’t really done much and it only looks like our site is affected. But I heard stories of other bad writers elsewhere. Maybe they know about SCp-7098?\n\nred: [[CAREFUL: IT JUST COMES BACK]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7098/offset/1 Other people outside of 96(in a place far away) wrote a file that is better, but I like MINE…]",
