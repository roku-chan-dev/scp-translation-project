This is Director Weiss speaking. Code Sparagmos is in effect. The World is on Fire.>>\n\nThere's a pause, and a sigh.\n\n<< God, I always thought that sounded so dramatic. The world isn't on fire, but small, important parts of it are. Nexuses, like Sloth's Pit. Everywhere from Hy-Brasil to Rhodehampton is experiencing anomalous activity that is aberrant to them.>>\n\nAnother pause, a click of the tongue. Most of the site is empty, with everyone in the situation room at this point.\n\n<<The last [http://www.scp-wiki.net/black-autumn-hub two] [http://scp-wiki.net/rise-of-the-pit-sloth-hub Octobers] have not been good to us. It is our job to ensure that what happened in Sloth's Pit does not repeat itself elsewhere. We cannot predict how tonight will go, but I have faith that, if nothing else, we will be comprehensive in our documentation.>>\n\n<<At this point, we can only watch, and wait. And hope. Tomorrow, the sun will rise, and no matter what, we'll continue on.>>\n\nAnother pause.\n\n<<I'm... not great at speeches. I honestly thought I would have more to say, but I don't. So.>> Weiss sighed. <<Good luck to all.>>\n\n---------\n\n[[=]]\n++ Associated Articles\n+++ [[[SCP-4683|SCP-4683 - The Apples of Discord]]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Notes:** The secret's out.
