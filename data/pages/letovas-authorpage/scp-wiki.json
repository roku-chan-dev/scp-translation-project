I am Letova. I use It/Its and She/Her (in gendered languages only) pronouns. I am Polish-German and religiously, I am a Gnostic Christian (yes, we still exist!). @existisin on Discord\n\nI have been in the SCP community since around 2022, knew about SCP since 2013 and posted my first article in June of 2024. I write mostly stuff connected to GoIs because that is what I find the most interesting. Below, you can find the works I have written as well as authors commentary.\n\n+ SCP-8425-##d156a8|STARFALL ##\n\n+++ [[[SCP-8425]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/ktrrVfaDkPI?si=CA0JVLIm_eiBLVYh They were shaking hands, seeing friends]\n[https://youtu.be/ktrrVfaDkPI?si=CA0JVLIm_eiBLVYh Lying, shitting, giving birth or dying]\n[https://youtu.be/ktrrVfaDkPI?si=CA0JVLIm_eiBLVYh They were making signs to you and me that]\n[https://youtu.be/ktrrVfaDkPI?si=CA0JVLIm_eiBLVYh No eyes can see, no brain can understand]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nCo-authored with [[*user bitzthedoggy]], written together with a friend of mine and start of a series of the same name. The idea came to me randomly. I was just sitting around and thought to myself \"I should begin a series about fifthism\". So I did.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Salvation\n\n+++ [[[Salvation]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/QXVFr5AZf2A?si=UiviK9CTWc8sacaB And the crimson girl]\n[https://youtu.be/QXVFr5AZf2A?si=UiviK9CTWc8sacaB Has a look more firm than steel]\n[https://youtu.be/QXVFr5AZf2A?si=UiviK9CTWc8sacaB It's a continous suicide for me]\n[https://youtu.be/QXVFr5AZf2A?si=UiviK9CTWc8sacaB Continous suicide for me]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nSecond part in the Starfall series, this one was plagued by technical problems as I was making it. Originally, the photos were going to be scans. I was unable to do it, however, as the scanner in my printer broke. It also took a while to find a good newspaper template. Had a lot of fun with it, despite that.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Silesian Cult\n\n+++ [[[Silesian Cult]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/YrYtIH-gfmI?si=vyh-wYG0x6cQEiCc (...)]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nThird part of Starfall, co-authored with [[*user Saig]]. This one was based on a few things. Partially, it was based on weird new age cults in general, partially on the famous \"Heaven's Gate\" incident and partially on the less famous \"Antrovis\" cult from southern Poland. Many of the beliefs mentioned in the post were taken directly from a book published by Antrovis, in fact. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ SCP-6924-Heresy\n\n+++ [[[SCP-6924]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/NS8gMyZ1eMI?si=YCH0s1s4p_PoRRdj How they carried the log on seven horses]\n[https://youtu.be/NS8gMyZ1eMI?si=YCH0s1s4p_PoRRdj Through the eye of the needle, distant worm-infested lands]\n[https://youtu.be/NS8gMyZ1eMI?si=YCH0s1s4p_PoRRdj Through sophoric fogs, dry vagrant forests]\n[https://youtu.be/NS8gMyZ1eMI?si=YCH0s1s4p_PoRRdj In the beginning was the word...]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nI love the N√§lk√§, I love gnosticism, I love folk Christianity and I love articles where you slowly piece together what is going on. So I decided to combine those. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ URALIC BREATH\n\n+++ [[[URALIC BREATH]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/cILVF1XHJPw?si=qp0LcUoLhsN6J5o_ They fought for their homeland]\n[https://youtu.be/cILVF1XHJPw?si=qp0LcUoLhsN6J5o_ They kissed fiercly in front of the universe]\n[https://youtu.be/cILVF1XHJPw?si=qp0LcUoLhsN6J5o_ They walked, as if on dry land, through wild water]\n[https://youtu.be/cILVF1XHJPw?si=qp0LcUoLhsN6J5o_ They sowed warmth, reaped April]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nWritten over the course of three days, the poem like this that I have ever made. It was very fun to write, in all honestly. Based on the album \"Apotheosis\" by the band \"Goatchrist\"\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Sarkic Text Archive Project\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkic-text-archive Sarkic Text Archive Project]\n\n[https://youtu.be/usJJUU0AOYE?si=EMvu1G_Pffme1YYZ But the individual soldier refused to die]\n[https://youtu.be/usJJUU0AOYE?si=EMvu1G_Pffme1YYZ He only had a word, a word, but what kind!]\n[https://youtu.be/usJJUU0AOYE?si=EMvu1G_Pffme1YYZ He started to eat, drink, vomit-take himself apart]\n[https://youtu.be/usJJUU0AOYE?si=EMvu1G_Pffme1YYZ The brain flowed past the walls]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nWritten with [[*user ThatCharlotte]] and [[*user Saig]], this was extremely fun to make. My first attempt at starting a collab log\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ SCP-7253-So you suffer\n\n+++ [[[SCP-7253]]]\n\n[https://youtu.be/2uvte9j9mVc?si=nLvBS3gyrT8mxts0 As they killed-so will they kill]\n[https://youtu.be/2uvte9j9mVc?si=nLvBS3gyrT8mxts0 As they have prohibited, so they will prohibit]\n[https://youtu.be/2uvte9j9mVc?si=nLvBS3gyrT8mxts0 As they imprisoned and killed, so they will continue]\n[https://youtu.be/2uvte9j9mVc?si=nLvBS3gyrT8mxts0 As they trampled and slaughtered, so they will forever!]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\n...\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Collective Punishment\n\n+++ [[[Collective Punishment]]]\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1EOLmLWME The river is flowing]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1EOLmLWME The wax is floating]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1EOLmLWME A child is dying]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nFirst part of 4 episode series set in the Mundus, Liberari canon. This was written by me in a half-awake state.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ A Union of N√§lk√§ \n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nalka-union A Union of N√§lk√§]\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 The crazy sparks have fallen on the ground]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 My land has been covered by bitterness]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 But there will be a new day!]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 New, bright day!]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nSecond part of 4 episode series set in the Mundus, Liberari canon. Actually took a while to get this into a readable state, I struggled a lot with making the characters feel distinct enough.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ First Shots\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/first-shots First Shots]\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 The darker it is, the brighter is the battle]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 The darker the night, the closer is dawn!]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 There will be a new day!]\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klpVaRFgmn4 Clear, bright day!]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nThird part of 4 episode series set in the Mundus, Liberari canon.

Somewhat based on it, as the title suggest. Evil ass reality anchor destroys the whole world aside from a single site, situation in the site gets worse and worse as no one has any idea what might happen after it is deactivated.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ ABRAXAS GROUP INTERNAL DOCUMENT #34\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/internal-document-34 Abraxas Group Internal Document #34]\n\n[https://youtu.be/x98jKI-ONOA?si=HwxYuGVmoXGM-7pF A fool is walking across the forest]\n[https://youtu.be/x98jKI-ONOA?si=HwxYuGVmoXGM-7pF Looking for a fool dumber than him]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-Commentary\"]]\n\nHad this idea ever since reading the article that first introduced the Abraxas Group. Honestly, was a lot of fun to write, even if there isn't that much here. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n---------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"-My will\"]]\n\nIn case I die, suffer a terrible injury, quit the site or go fully silent for a period longer than 6 months, I ask for all my works to be given over to the community. \n\n[[/collapsible]]",
