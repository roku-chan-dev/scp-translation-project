Well, M████'s like, dude, we should do that again, and I'm like, yeah, man, we totally should, and so we did. \n\n----\n\n__Test One__\n\n//Hey man, you already used that one in the last thing!// --Dr. M████\n\n//Oh yeah.

What are you talking about?\n> **SCP-1193-01:** Dude, this ████ is excellent, man!\n> **Dr. Ernest:** What's, um, this ████ you're talking about?\n> **SCP-1193-01:** Oh, ████, sorry man, gotta go, Dave's here.\n> **CALL TERMINATED**\n> \n> <End Recording>\n\n----\n\n__Test B__\n\n> //I gave some of this ████ to those [[[SCP-2085 | hot catgirl chicks]]], man!// --Dr. C████\n> \n> //I told you, man, quit tryin' to get laid with that ████!

These chicks really know how to get [[[stealingsolidarityhub | spaced out]]]!// --Dr. C████\n\n----\n\n__Test C__\n\n> //What if we give some of this ████ to [[[SCP-1171 | that dude who doesn't like anybody]]]?

Instead of the typical clown outfit, Bobble is wearing a Bob Marley t-shirt, a gray hoodie, and pajama bottoms decorated with marijuana leaves. The rest of Bobble's costume-- hat, wig, makeup, nose, gloves, and shoes-- are as typical. The episode is divided into three segments: \"How To Roll the Perfect Doobie\", \"How To Make a Bong Out of Found Materials\", and \"How To Take Over the Regional Black Market Drug Trade With Ruthless Efficiency\". The last segment is by far the longest, and ends with a six-plus-minute montage of Bobble the Clown gunning down drug rivals using a wide variety of powerful firearms.\n\n> //I **told** you clowns are scary as ████!// --Dr. M████\n> \n> //Yeah, man, totally. But that clown knows his ████.// --Dr. C████\n\n----\n\n__Test F__\n\n> //Man, I tried to give some of this ████ to [[[SCP-1981 | that old dude who keeps gettin' cut up]]], but he just said No.// --Dr. M████\n\n----\n\n__Test G__\n\n> //Hey man, we should give some of this ████ to that guy... oh what's his name...? Oh yeah, [[[SCP-2337 | Spanky]]]!// --Dr. M████\n\n**Incident DK-2337-48L:** On 04/17/16, at 23:35, an excessive auditory event occurred in Interview Room 19 at Site-17. Sound pressure measurements estimate loudness in excess of 120 dB within ten meters of Interview Room 19, setting off seismic detectors around the site. Witnesses describe the sound as \"like a hacking cough, except cacking\".\n\n> //Dude. Cack, man. Just... cack.// --Dr. M████\n> \n> //Whoa. That's some deep ████, man.// --Dr. C████\n\n----\n\n__Test H__\n\n> //Yeah man, so I was looking for a place to light up, without any people around, so I went out on this [[[SCP-087 | staircase]]], and it looked all right, quiet, no one around... but then all this freaky ████ started happenin', and I got out of there, man, but I must have dropped my joint back there somewhere. I just lost my ████, man.// --Dr. C████\n\n\n**Image Captured 04/22/2016 @ 16:48:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Image\" hide=\"Hide Image\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=087x420j-v2-new.jpeg|link=\"*/local--files/extended-scp-420-j-experiment-log/087x420j-v2.png\"|align=left|caption=Yeah, we're done here.]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
