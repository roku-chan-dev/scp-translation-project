The Abrahamic religions have a rich history of religious texts, traditions, and cultural practices that have shaped the world for thousands of years.\n\nToday, books come in a variety of formats, including paperbacks, hardcovers, and e-books, and can be found in libraries, bookstores, and online. Most Abrahamic religions believe in the existence of one all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God. The symbol for infinity (∞) was first used by mathematician John Wallis in 1655. The Satanic Panic was a period of widespread fear and hysteria in the United States and other countries in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nI am god damn tired of you, Tony. Autotheism is often seen as an alternative to more traditional theistic beliefs, in which power and authority are placed in a deity or higher power outside of oneself. I baked you a pie. The idea of infinity has been around for thousands of years, but it was not fully understood or developed until the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIt’s made out of people. 9382.

Gingivitis is the leading cause of tooth decay. This belief is not limited to any particular religion or culture, but rather can be found across many different philosophical and spiritual traditions.\n\nMany books have been banned or censored throughout history due to their controversial content or ideas, but the freedom to read and access books remains a fundamental right in many countries. It never ends with you. In ancient Greece, throwing an apple to someone was a traditional marriage proposal.

Should SCP-6159-1 leave SCP-6159, the use of lethal force against the entity is strictly forbidden. When attempting to apprehend SCP-6159-1, all acting personnel must either remain undetected by the entity or ensure that they have maintained an adequate distance (~700-800 meters) from the anomaly prior to capturing it.\n\nPersonnel are forbidden from accepting any contracts SCP-6159-1 proposes without 05 Council approval.\n\nApprehending SCP-6159-2 is to be done as soon as possible for the purpose of interrogating it. Researching both SCP-6159-1 and SCP-6159-2 for means of making containment more practical is a high priority.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6159 is the collective designation for a seemingly indestructible, untitled book, and the extradimensional space that makes up its interior.\n\nThe object’s exterior has a blue leather cover with gold trimming. The text within SCP-6159’s pages is seemingly random, and changes constantly when unobserved. Once a subject opens the book, they become aware of its functionality, and can utilize SCP-6159 to open a stable, two-way portal to its interior extradimensional space.\n\nThe interior of SCP-6159 is a localized dimension consisting of a massive, multistoried library containing an unknown, theoretically infinite amount of books. These books consist of both published works commonly available to the public, and several texts unknown to any publisher database.\n\nThere does not appear to be any organizational structure to these books, their placement seeming entirely random. Likewise, the text within the books is random, with each sentence belonging to a different disparate work. This library is thought to be the source of the text appearing on the object's exterior. Additionally, when a subject is traversing SCP-6159’s interior, that subject has a chance of appearing on one of SCP-6159’s pages as an ink illustration, alongside the text.\n\nSCP-6159-1 refers to an Alpha Class Tartarean entity, or \"archdemon[[footnote]]\n\nLike all adult, non-Omega Class Tartarean and Akivian entities, SCP-6159-1 possess a halo above its head, referred to as a \"Crown\" for Tartarean entities. SCP-6159-1's Crown is composed of 3 flames, referred to as \"Gems\". These Gems consist of a large central flame flanked by two smaller flames by its side, designating its socioeconomic position in Tartarean society as an archdemon.\n\n[[/footnote]],\" that was discovered in SCP-6159's extra-dimensional space. The entity has called itself \"Primrose Fatish Von Trevil,\" and claims to originate from “the Seventh Circle\" otherwise known as the \"Circle of Violence.\" It appears as a feminine humanoid with features resembling a black-backed jackal (//Lupulella mesomelas//) and stands at approximately 2.13m (7ft) in height.\n\nAny aggressive physical action attempted towards SCP-6159-1 will result in any injury that would be sustained by the entity to be replicated in targets of its choosing. The upper limit to the amount of subjects SCP-6159-1 can designate is unknown. This effect does not occur if it is unable to designate a target prior to being harmed, or if a subject has distanced themselves at least 22 meters from SCP-6159-1. While the entity claims to be non-hostile, extreme caution is advised when interacting with it.\n\nSCP-6159-2 refers to an uncontained Omega Class Tartarean entity, or \"Imp[[footnote]]\n\nSCP-6159-2 has a single flame, or \"Gem\", at the end of its tail, denoting its position --at the bottom of Tartarean society-- as an imp of comparable socioeconomic position to its \"patron.\"\n\n[[/footnote]],\" who can materialize within SCP-6159's extra-dimensional space at will. SCP-6159-2 refers to itself as \"Adrian,\" and claims to be SCP-6159-1's familiar. The entity stands at 0.6m (2ft) in height, has vaguely canid features with two short horns on its head, and is of indeterminate sex. SCP-6159-2 claims its goals are to return SCP-6159-1 to its place of origin, and to reunite it with the rest of its \"family.\" Based on interactions with it, SCP-6159-2 is theorized to have been human prior to assuming its current form.\n\n\nWhile SCP-6159-2 appears to pose no direct harm to personnel, caution is to be maintained at all times when interacting with Tartarean entities.\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Update 12/27/2021 7:05 PM:** No successful method is currently in place for fully containing SCP-6159-1 or SCP-6159-2.

Iconography refers to the use of symbols and visual representations to convey mathematical concepts. You may normal summon any monster with four or less star symbols from your hand without tribute. Despite initial resistance, there is a growing trend towards anti-discrimination in the Yu-Gi-Oh! player community.\n\nPineapple on pizza pie may be taboo, but when it comes to desserts, they are often used in dishes like pineapple upside-down cake, fruit tarts, pineapple sorbet, and even fruit pies! Visual aids like pie graphs are often used in math to help people understand complex concepts.\n\nIn response to the reports of discrimination, many Yu-Gi-Oh! players and organizations have stepped up efforts to promote diversity, inclusiveness, and equality in the game and the community. Some men have said that women belong in the kitchen, not at the game table. Bananas are often mashed and used as a base for banana bread or banana muffins.

Primrose Fatish Von Trevil. Lawyer, diplomatic liaison, mercenary, surgeon, and pharmaceutical chemist. Whore of Blood, and true heiress to the Throne of Blood in the Seventh Circle.  It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Dr. Lynn.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That... is a rather impressive list of credentials. Is that... normal for archdemons?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Some of them, perhaps. The royal title of 'Whore' requires one to be a multi-disciplinary individual. At the service and betterment of whoever requires me.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I... see. Um, may I sit down, Primrose?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** You may.\n\n//[Dr. Lynn brings a chair to sit across from SCP-6159-1 who had now returned to its seat.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Thank you. I won't take too much of your time. Just need to ask a few more questions.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Be my guest.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Could you explain what you meant by ‘true heiress to the Throne of Blood?’ You're an archdemon. That would mean you're the //ruler// of the Seventh Circle, correct?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … That is… //complicated.//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Okay, try me.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 sighs and pinches its brow.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** No, I am not the ruler of the Seventh Circle. Technically speaking, //nobody is.// The Intercircular Diet of Violence is the closest thing to a ruling body. If that body were a //fetid corpse.//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I sense you're not their biggest fan.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I am not.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The Diet is made up of seven of my father’s old flunkies who style themselves as self-appointed ‘Grand Dukes.’ They think of themselves as royalty. I think of them as parasites.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** They are the ones actively preventing my ascension to the Throne of Blood. My only solace is that they are too busy fighting each other to focus on directly interfering with me.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Why wouldn’t they want you to take the throne?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Because I would remove them from power. Again, they are parasites.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That sounds like a mess.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Blame my father. All he was ever good for was making the entire circle miserable.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** So, what are you doing now if you aren't a ruler?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I operate… Sorry, I //used// to operate a law firm. Prim and Proper Legal Solutions. We focus primarily on class action lawsuits, but we also do a fair amount of pro bono work.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You used to?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. The firm is on hiatus. Temporarily.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I see, well-\n\n//[Dr. Lynn accidentally kicks one of the many unknown medical inhalers on the ground. She reaches down to pick one up and examines it.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** … I hope I’m not prying, but may I ask what these are? There’s quite a lot here.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Apologies; there are not any trash bins in this place. These are DreamSmoke™[[footnote]]Attempts at removing the trademark symbol have failed. This is consistent with the majority of Hell’s name-brand products.[[/footnote]] inhalers. They are a brand of light demonic sleep aids.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Oh, alright, I see. So, you mentioned an... 'Adrian' during our last meeting. May we ask who that is?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 thinks for a moment and taps its chin. T9-3 uses this as an opportunity to place a surveillance device on the shelf near SCP-6159-1.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Adrian is... they are my familiar, paralegal, and... best friend. We have known each other for a while. A century by this point, though it feels much, much longer. I thought you and your escorts were them when you approached me.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Huh, was there a reason why you thought we might have been them?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Oh, it was the swearing, mostly. That, and Oliver over there has a similar accent to them. St. Louis, Missouri… yes?\n\n**T9-2:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Adrian was usually the one to visit me here. To check in on me. They used to help me here with my work but...\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 becomes silent for 10 seconds.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** N-No, I… sorry, It has been awhile since I last spoke with anyone. I have been rather distracted with my work here.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Your work? May I ask what that might be? I understand if it's highly confidential considering your, uh, various professions but we still need to know your purpose for being here.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** It is confidential, sadly. And while I may have scrubbed this area of Akiva radiation, I would still be putting //you// in extreme danger should too much information be leaked. All you need to know is that I am attempting to find information on a very, very ancient crime and the ensuing conspiracy that covered it up, and I know somewhere this library has the evidence I need.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** How do you know?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Are you aware of the nature of this library? I see you are aware of its ties to the Serpent at least, otherwise your superiors would not have sent Tau-9 with you.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** We have... some knowledge, yes. The rest, however, is just conjecture on our part. Enlighten us?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The book we are currently residing in is one of the many early attempts made by the Serpent to create what's now known as the Wanderer's Library. A repository of all the knowledge in all of existence. Unsurprisingly, this place holds every single text ever written in //every// single world. Living. Dead. Infernal. Divine. And beyond. Infinitely updating itself. Sound familiar?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That sounds about right for what we know about the Wanderer's Library. But... you said this was an early 'attempt' at creating the library. As in this was a... failure?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... That was a bit harsh, Dr. Lynn. Without the lessons she learned here we would not even //have// the Wanderer's Library today. I would rather you not refer to her hard work here as a //failure.//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** O-Oh, um, apologies. I didn't mean to offend. I only wanted more context on this book's history.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... No, it is- I am sorry, I know you did not mean to insult her. The Serpent is a family friend, and I... just felt defensive, I suppose. I am normally more on top of my emotions but... well...\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You're under a lot of stress here. I understand. I'll try to be more respectful with my language going forward.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... Thank you. That is... very considerate of you.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** But yes, to answer your question earlier: This book was a prototype. A rough sketch or an early draft of the //idea// of the Wanderer's Library. As a result it has... several //major// issues. This library's collection is completely disorganized and uncatalogued. The books themselves are unlabeled and untitled. Not only that, the //text// within the book is an issue as well, I mean- here, look at this.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 shows Dr. Lynn the book it was holding.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** This is... Wait, what am I reading here?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** You are reading the combined text of a cookbook, a personal diary, and what I //think// is an instructional manual on how to construct a homemade thermonuclear weapon. Each sentence is from their respective text. The library compiles them all in a big messy heap like this.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** This place collects all written text in every world. But due to an oversight in design, this library does not distinguish between actual //useful// information and useless //noise.// Attempting to gain any useful knowledge here is...\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Impossible?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** //Difficult.// This library holds all the knowledge in existence, theoretically speaking. You just need to //find// it.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You've been at this for a lot longer than a year, have you?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. It has been a very long time. I think a full year was the longest I ever spent here though.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** By yourself? You mentioned that Adrian used to help you here with your research. Is there a reason why they aren't here with you? Are they waiting for you back, uh... home?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 stares off to the side. The entity remains silent for 15 seconds.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I'm sorry if that was too personal a question, Primrose. We can just-\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Do you want to know what the worst issue with this book is? The one I //loathe// the most, Dr. Lynn?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** ... What is it?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The Serpent made the book here. In this living world. As such, she used the magic sourced from this world and this world //only.// As a result, she discovered that the book only functions in //this// world and nowhere else. When brought to another plane, it turns back into a blank book, its contents inaccessible. Then she found another issue: it was not possible to check books //out// of this library as well. Defeating the entire purpose she had of sharing the collected knowledge here.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** If you wish to make use of this library's function, you //must// remain in this world, within the book itself. You cannot take it with you or bring anything out. It is why I am still here. Still searching. It is why I... cannot return home. Yet.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I’m… sorry to hear that, Primrose. But, what about Adrian?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Adrian and I worked together initially to pore through all these books. We did not stay here for long, maybe a few days at first. But that soon turned into a week and then a few weeks and then a month and... so on. They could not stay here for that long, so they returned home and would come back to help me whenever they could.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Alright, but where are they? You said it's been a year, right? That’s quite the gap without seeing each other.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Adrian and I had a… professional disagreement. That is all I feel comfortable sharing.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I understand. Did you expect them to return soon?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I mean… I expected them to return //eventually…// They should have been back with more DreamSmoke™. I did not think they would have been absent for this long. We may have said some things we did not mean but…\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 begins to rub its eyes.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** A whole //year?...// It could not have been //that// long, it just is not possible. I thought it was a month or two, at most... I- I mean… how could-\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, I think we can end the interview here. I don't want to…  distract you from your work.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Okay. That is- okay. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** We'll take our leave now. We may return at a later date for another interview. But until then, take care of yourself.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. You too, then.\n\n**T9-4:** ... Good luck, lady. Hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.\n\n//[Dr. Lynn and the rest of T9 turn to leave. The surveillance device records SCP-6159-1 sitting in its chair unmoving for the next 30 minutes.

Sorry about that, I wanted to talk with you one more time.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** It… is fine. Well, it is //not// fine, but it is fine. I am in the middle of trying to find something, as I believe you are aware.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Yeah. Your friend gave the intern in charge of surveillance a heart attack. He called the site director and started screaming that “Satan was about to kill us all.”\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Apologies. Adrian was just trying to look out for me.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** So… uh, were they joking about your family waging a war against us?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Oh, no, they actually would do so if they believed that you were holding me captive. Or if you were a variant of the //Sonderkommando für Paranormales,// which you are not.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Yes, and we have some questions about that particular incident. Specifically, why you attacked them. We obviously have a few reasons why you would want to, but we don’t have the full picture.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Well, for one, they are literal Nazis, so there is the principle of the matter. But, we believed they were holding the mother of my half-brother, Morningstar, hostage. They were not, but we had to kill everyone to find that out.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I-I see.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 stands up from the ground and proceeds to sit down on its chair. Dr. Lynn proceeds to sit across from it.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … You are not in danger, Dr. Lynn. We often approach things from a more diplomatic standpoint, but we did not deem them worthy of that for //very obvious// reasons.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Well, that’s a relief to hear. If they were a normal instance of the SCP Foundation, you'd have negotiated?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** That depends. //Your// version of the SCP Foundation, like I said prior, is relatively benign. //You// can be reasoned with. There are //others// who cannot. Other versions of your Foundation that are so drunk on their own power that they feel they can contain the //entire world.//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** There are Foundations out there that make yours look like a small town police department by comparison. For instance, you do not possess a [[[SCP-2000|Deus Ex Machina in Yellowstone]]].\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Pardon?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** For all intents and purposes, let us just call it a… “reset button.” It is not doing the concept justice, but you get the idea.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** //Mmm… maybe.// I can’t really… make a comment on all of that.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** A benign Foundation is not a bad thing, Dr. Lynn. The universes where the Foundation ends up ruling the world are not very good places to live, I assure you.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Well, let’s change the topic then. Could we talk about your family for a moment? You said that your brother is named, uh, //Morningstar?//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. He is not //the Adversary,// if that is what you were thinking. Information from other worlds tends to leak out in strange ways.[[footnote]]SCP-6159-1 is referring to the phenomenon of multi-universal memetic bleed (MMB), where information travels and often distorts between individual universes.[[/footnote]] You are not the only Earth that has conflated my brother’s name with the name of the ruler of Inferno[[footnote]]Inferno refers to the YHWHist Hell, which is the largest superpower amongst Tartarean afterlives.[[/footnote]]\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Let me give you another example, do you know how demons are usually depicted in popular culture? As little red men with goatees and a pitchfork?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Yeah? I always thought that was a little strange, honestly.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 gestures to itself.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I am the little red man with the fork.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** W-wait but… that’s…  you aren’t little, or a man, or have a fork.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** No, the fork part is actually accurate. //[SCP-6159-1 materializes an ornate, thorned pitchfork in its hand. Dr. Lynn and Tau-9 are visibly startled.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** O-Oh! You uh, had that the entire time, huh?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. //[SCP-6159-1 dematerialises its weapon.]// Honestly, it is a little dysphoric, I mean, I spent so much time and money on transitioning only for mortals to think of me as an ugly little red man! And with a //goatee!// Where did that even come from?! I never ONCE had a goatee!\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 sighs and rubs its temples.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** You can understand, right, Dr. Lynn?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I do. Even after years of HRT[[footnote]]Hormone Replacement Therapy[[/footnote]], It felt so frustrating to keep living that lie, so I can imagine what it might be like to have that lie constantly pressed on you like that.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I still have family who can’t accept who I am now. They kept bringing up my pre-transition self, how “handsome I used to be” and how “good I looked” with facial hair.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I can relate. In general, not specifically.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 gestures to itself, referencing its fur.]//\n\n//[Dr. Lynn laughs.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Well, the difference is that you //actually// look good with fur on your face. I can’t say the same for myself.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Hah. I certainly look better with my fur than without. I had to be degloved a few times for the sake of a permanent transition. Adrian used to refer to me as “Bratwurst.”\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Goodness, that sounds like an intense procedure.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Very, but the results are undeniable.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Back on topic though, I have been confused with the Adversary, my own brother, and the Greek god Pan for absolutely no reason. I do not even look remotely like //any// of them. The way information distorts through different universes is absolutely //migraine// inducing, honestly.\n\n**T9-4:** I didn't know that was, like, a thing that could happen.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** //Really?// This is fairly common knowledge for us in Inferno. I know you visit Undervegas often and have a number of social relationships there. I am surprised //none// of them ever told you about this.\n\n**T9-4:** Uh, well, I’m usually too busy doing other… //things…// to talk shop like that.\n\n//[T9-3 chuckles.]//\n\n**T9-3:** Yeah, like //doing// all your boy-toys from the Handsome Boy Modeling School.\n\n**T9-4:** It’s not my fault! I can’t say no to them whenever I’m in town!\n\n**T9-2:** Aren’t you the one who hits them up first?\n\n**T9-4:** … //Maybe.//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Still, I thought they would have told you //something.// They are a well versed mercenary company and that specific squad you are dating has hunted down targets on multiple worlds prior.\n\n//[T9-4 stares at SCP-6159-1 and blinks]//\n\n**T9-4:** Wait, mercenary company?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I- yes? You know, it is //the// Handsome Boy Modeling School? As in Lust’s premiere //royal mercenary company?//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The ones who answer to //Queen Asmodeus// directly? \n\n**SCP-6159-1:** They work with Site-666 to maintain security in Undervegas?\n\n**T9-4:** ... //Oh.//\n\n**T9-4:** Oh, yeah okay. That makes //a lot// more sense now. \n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I am sorry but- what did you //think// their job was?\n\n**T9-4:** I thought they were just like… you know... //prostitutes.//\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 remains silent for 5 seconds.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... No. They are not.\n\n**T9-4:** Well, I know that //now.//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** It seemed rather obvious.\n\n**T9-4:** Listen, I'm good at my job and what I do. I don't pretend that I'm all that smart outside of it.\n\n**T9-3:** You know, I was always wondering why they never charged you.\n\n**T9-2:** I was wondering why they were all carrying guns.\n\n//[T9-1 clears his throat loudly]//\n\n**T9-1:** Can we //please// get back on topic?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes. Apologies, what was the topic again?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Uh, right, your family. It’s good to know that they aren’t about to kill us all, but we still have questions. What was your relationship with your family? Was everything good back home?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I love them more than anything. Truthfully? I am here for them. The evidence I am looking for involves the… man who hurt them.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** What did he do? We know that you’re after something about a crime that was committed, but we might need to know the scale of the crime and how it relates to your family.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** It does not relate to my family. Not directly, at least.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** This crime is what began a multi-millennial reign of terror that indirectly, but //intentionally,// caused grief to the other members of my family. If I can prove what this person did… maybe we can finally try to arrange his removal. Or at least have him face some kind of consequence for his actions.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** And what crime did he commit?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I allege //mass-familicide.// As a young child, he killed his entire family, claimed the seat of power for himself, and covered the crime up by erasing them from history.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That’s a very serious allegation. How did you first find out about this?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** My mother took a keen interest in this case. She was tipped off by the Serpent, and… I suppose I am taking it up in her place.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I know you said the information is confidential and potentially dangerous but… it would help us to know what you are looking for //specifically.// Who exactly is the accused in this situation?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … I apologize but I cannot tell you.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Not even a hint?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:**... Dr. Lynn, I need you to understand. I am an archdemon. There are very few entities that I am //truly// wary of. I ask that you please use your imagination.\n\n//[Dr. Lynn puts a hand to her chin and furrows her brow. She is silent for 10 seconds.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I… I think I can understand.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** When this crime was committed, there was a text written about it. And this text was deemed damning enough for the accused to destroy both the text, its writer, and the //universe that he inhabited.// There was nothing left, not even dust.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I think it goes without saying that I am after this text.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** There was something I’ve been thinking about since we first met. Why are you here, exactly, and not in the Wanderer’s Library? If you and your mother knew the Serpent, and her library is more functional, why are you searching //here?//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The text itself was destroyed before it could be archived. And even if she could, the Serpent would not carry it in her library. It is simply too dangerous. And considering the sorts of books the Wanderer’s library has in its catalog, I think that says a lot. She only knew enough to give my mother the name of the text’s author: //Utharia.//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** The Serpent was the one who suggested my mother look here. Like I said before, this book automatically collects all written text in all of existence, from useless noise to precious knowledge. Due to the way information bleeds through worlds, the Serpent believed that //parts// of Utharia’s testament survived in other written work.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** So… wait. Even if you found what you’re looking for, then it wouldn’t be an accurate account, would it? Like you said, information tends to distort between worlds.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Perhaps, but… I can get close //enough.// If I can find enough texts to put together then I can possibly assemble something coherent. Here, let me show you an example…\n\n//[The entity presents a handwritten page to Dr. Lynn and points at the following text.]//\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background-image: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6159/Black_Paper.jpg\"); background-size: cover; background-color: black; color: white; border: 0px solid #820e06; border-style: ridge; padding: 20px;\"]]\n\n>PLEASE NOTE:\n>THIS POEM IS NOT FROM DEATHCONSIOUSNESS\n>THIS POEM IS WRITTEN BY US.

What does all of this //really// mean to you?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I… I am unsure what you are trying to say, Dr. Lynn.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I want to know what this represents to you. I believe you said earlier that you’re doing this for your family, right? But… Well, we know how much your family misses you. Don’t you think they'd want you home instead?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 shifts uncomfortably.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** They… would not want me to show up empty handed.\n\n **Dr. Lynn:** According to Adrian, they just want you to show up in general.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 is silent.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Did you find Morningstar’s feather?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … I know it is somewhere here. I was- I used it as a bookmark. I must have left it in one of the books that I threw in the pile. I am… unsure //when// I lost it.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** What about the plant over there? I think Adrian said it belonged to your wife, Astia. When did you stop taking care of it?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I do not… recall. I //swear// I was taking good care of it. Astia took up botany as a form of therapy and gave the plant to me to help keep me sane while I was conducting research here. The last time I looked at it, it was still… green.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Prim, I think you’re smart enough to know this isn’t healthy behavior. You’ve isolated yourself from your loved ones, you’ve stopped taking care of yourself and the things around you, you’ve completely lost track of time and when you aren’t overworking yourself, you spend it asleep. Why are you really doing this?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** What are you afraid of?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I- I-... I am not afraid of anything. What would you know about fear? You have been scared of me since we first met.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** What claim do //you// have to lecture me on fear? You who jump at shadows and try to label them in boxes. Holding back the inevitable, because you are //terrified// of the world around you. What right do you have to ask me what I am afraid of?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, you know this is an obvious deflection, right? Yes, you’re right, we’re all frightened of you. There’s nothing we can do if you decide to just kill us all. But despite all that fear… I’m still here. Trying to //help// you.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You’re never going to find what you’re looking.

It’s not deadly or addictive or anything. It’s mostly used to memorize shit, and to relax, but too much of the stuff fucks you up. You can end up sleeping for days. Weeks sometimes.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That sounds pretty serious.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Yeah, we call ‘em SleepyHeads. Fucked up.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** They tend to get VERY cranky if someone wakes them up... So I'll be the one to poke her.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Be my guest.\n\n//[SCP-6159-2 approaches SCP-6159-1, and gently shakes the entity.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Prim, c’mon. You gotta wake up. We need to talk.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** //[Groggily]// Nnnffive more… minutes.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** No, not five more minutes. Now. Come on.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** N…no…\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Okay, here’s what we’re going to do. I’m gonna make you sit up in that chair like a regular person…\n\n//[SCP-6159-2 makes an effort to lift the other entity into a sitting position.

The Entity begins to carefully bring the liquid into SCP-6159-1’s lips until it begins to slowly lap it up.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** There we go, ya big puppy. We even added marshmallows and cinnamon how you like it.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 stirs and starts to properly sit up in its chair.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … Mnnm, wha- Adrian?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … Dr. Lynn?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Good morning, Primrose. We’d like to talk.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** This's been a long time coming, fluffbutt.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** What are you two doing? What has been coming?\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** An intervention. Prim, please. Drop this shit. Come home.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** No.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Don’t get //monosyllabic// with me. You aren’t your brother.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You have a family, Primrose. How long do you plan on staying here away from them?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** You do not understand, I ca-\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** No, Prim. Answer the question. Let’s just… entertain a hypothetical here. Say you never found what you’re looking for. How long do you plan on keeping your fam’ waiting? Astia’s panic attacks have been getting worse, Star and I are worried about the both of you. And when //that// guy gets worried I know something’s really fuckin’ wrong.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Plus, like… there’s gotta be a better way to get this fucker. Don’t you think you could have done a lot more good out there if you weren’t doing this?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 remains silent. Dr. Lynn approaches the entities.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose. When is enough //enough?...//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** It will be enough when I have completed my work here.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Prim, your work will //never// be completed here. We’ve pored through like… a million books and only found shit that //was vaguely similar// to it. The Utharia Testament doesn’t exist anymore. And if it does, we can’t fuckin’ find it.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** But it does exist! It exists here! It literally //HAS// to exist here.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, this is //worse// than trying to find an individual grain of sand in a desert. I know demons are immortal, you literally have all the time in the world, but does your family have the time to wait for you?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I’m going to ask you again: What are you afraid of? Why do you think your family will be disappointed in you if you don’t find this testament?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I… do not.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Hold up … You aren’t worried that we’re disappointed in you? Then what the fuck is it?!\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Adrian, I-\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Nono, I need to ask this. Prim, did //WE// do something wrong? Did we do something to push you away from us? Did we hurt you?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Wha- No! You did not!\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Then why the fuck are you so fucking obsessed with this?! Why?! I-... //all of us// need to know why you haven’t lived in your own damn home in //years.// Just, what did we //do// to make you unhappy?!\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** //NO!// That is not… I- I… I… just…\n\n//[SCP-6159-1's voice catches in its throat.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** A- Adrian- I-I… I am so… so…\n\n//[SCP-6159-2 stares at SCP-6159-1 for 10 seconds before it sniffs and wipes its eyes.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** //[Sniff] For fucks sake, Prim.//\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 begins to whimper as SCP-6159-2 continues staring at the entity, tears begin to fall down both of their faces. Dr. Lynn gently grabs onto both entity's hands.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Okay… I think we all need to slow down and breathe. I know emotions are running hot right now, but we can’t use any accusatory language here. We're not trying to hurt each other. Let's all just take a minute and calm down, alright?\n\n//[Both entities mumble in agreement. SCP-6159-2 manifests another thermos in its hands and pours itself and SCP-6159-1 two cups of hot cocoa.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** //[Sniff]// You want a cup, Maple?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I appreciate it, but I’ll have to decline. Protocol.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Ugh, you guys ain’t fun.\n\n//[2 minutes pass as the entities drink.]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** It does smell really good though.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Heh, yeah. Astia made it. She’s got the palate of a 5 year old but she knows her sweets… obsessed with sprinkles, too.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That’s strange, I don’t see any sprinkles.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Yeah, cuz she made this just for Prim. She used to make this all the time for her.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … She made this for me? Recently?\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Yeah, fuckin’ //obviously,// dude. She knows I’m coming here to talk to you. When was the last time you had this?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … Over a year ago…\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** That’s a long time to go without seeing your family, Primrose. Do you think you’re ready to talk about it now?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I do not… think I will ever be ready. What more is there to say?\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** It just- It doesn’t make any sense to me. Prim, you know us, we aren’t gonna hate you for this. You //know// we’d forgive you for… anything. So, why’s this different? What’s goin’ on here?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** What about your other family, like your parents? You’ve mentioned your mother before.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** It seems like you have a good relationship with her.\n\n//[Both entities are silent.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Yeah… uh… about that.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** My mother is… gone... She was [[[SCP-7603|butchered]]][[footnote]]In the context of tartarean entities, “butchering” refers to the process of decapitating a demon, removing its flesh, and harvesting the organ responsible for regeneration. This is done with the goal of ensuring that they are incapable of forming a new body, and remain permanently incapacitated in a conscious, coma-like state as a skull.[[/footnote]], and I do not know where she is.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** //Oh.// Primrose, I am //so// sorry.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Thank you. It was a very long time ago by mortal standards. I have… //tried// my best to make her proud. To live up to her legacy. Both in terms of the social work she did and in the way she conducted herself personally.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I had to pull so many strings to continue where my mother left off, and after finally getting this library. I have- I //need// to succeed.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Don’t you think that’s putting //way// too much pressure on yourself?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I have been under far worse pressure. I have told you my many job titles, yes?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Well, yes.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Then you know what I can handle, what I am capable of. I will not simply just- just roll over and give up. Not for something //this// important.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, I don’t think your mother would-\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Wait… Holy shit. Wait. Hang the fuck on.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** This ain’t about //us,// is it? It’s //never// been about us.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** //We// can forgive you. //We// can assure you that you haven’t failed us. But there’s //one// person who can’t do that. This is who it’s about…\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** This is about your //mom.//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** What?! No, that is ridiculous, that is- just… just…\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 squints its eyes and furrows its brow.]//\n\n//[There is a 7 second silence before SCP-6159-1’s eyes widen.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** … Oh.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** //FUCK!// It's so fuckin' obvious now. I can't //believe// I missed that.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, do you think you’re ready to talk now?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I… yes, I suppose so.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Is there any reason why you feel your mother would be disappointed in you? Was she, maybe, very judgmental or perhaps unkind towa-\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 lets out a small but audible gasp and appears offended.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Absolutely //NOT.// My mother was one of the kindest, gentlest people I ever knew. No other person in power was as compassionate as she was. No one else in the Seventh Circle attempted to make things better //except for her.//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** And you’re afraid you can’t live up to her example?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I…\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 is silent for 5 seconds]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Before she was… butchered, my mother and I had one last conversation. She told me that for all her effort she was only one woman against an entire system of pure //cruelty,// upheld by corrupt dukes and their war economy.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** She actually attempted to set up an organization to help the underclass of the Seventh Circle. Several times. Each failure stung more than the last.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I tried for the last two thousand years to pick up where she left off. I had to, I //promised her// I would.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I would succeed where Mother failed, and be even //greater// than she was. That I would do everything I could to make her //proud of me.//\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 pauses]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:**... I am not sure she would be very proud of me now.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Prim, //come on,// you know that’s not fair at all.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:**  I agree with Adrian, but I would also like to add to that. Primrose, I don’t think this is just unfair towards yourself. I think this is frankly unfair towards your //mother// as well.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** E-Excuse me?\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** You keep telling me that your mother was the kindest, most compassionate person you knew. So… why do you keep imagining her judging you so //harshly?// Why do you keep thinking she’d be disappointed in you? Don’t you think that’s a really //mean// way to picture your mother?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 furrows its brow and begins to open its mouth to speak before it stops and stares at Dr. Lynn. SCP-6159-1 leans back in its chair, deep in thought.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Shit, dude. I haven’t seen her speechless for a while. Well done.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Thank you, Adrian.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... You... have a point, Dr. Lynn. I suppose I just never quite saw it like that.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** Primrose, you know your mother better than anyone else, you know she wouldn’t want you to be like //this.// Would she?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... No, she would not.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** What would she want from you, Primrose?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I… I am not sure. I cannot imagine what she would want.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Naw, you do. You’re just scared to say it.\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 groans.]//\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Come on, be a big girl and say it. You know what Babs would want. You can get sappy, no one’s judgin’.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** //[Sighs]// My mother would want me to be happy. To have people in my life who love and care about me. She would want me to be with them, as much as I can. She would not want me to be… //here.//\n\n//[Dr. Lynn pats SCP-6159-1’s hand]//\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I’m proud of you, I think that was hard to admit.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes, yes it was. Thank you, both of you. I think...\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 stands up]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** ... I think it is time I return home.\n\n**SCP-6159-2** Aren’t you forgettin’ something?\n\n[SCP-6159-1 pauses.]\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Oh //shit.// Morningstar’s feather. Augh, I cannot leave here without it.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** If you’d like I’m sure Tau-9 and I are willing to help you look.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Nah, no need. She can find it herself.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Adrian, I have checked through //thousands// of books trying to find Star’s feather. I do not know where it could possibly be.\n\n**SCP-6159-2:**  Maybe try someplace //other// than the books, Prim.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Other than the books? But I was using it as a bookmark, it has to b-...\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 freezes in place. The entity opens its jacket pocket, and looks inside.

After 7 seconds SCP-6159-1 puts the entity on the table they are both positioned next to.]\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** I’m glad you both worked things out. I assume you’re ready to leave?\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** Yes, we are. Adrian, could you carry Astia’s plant and my notes there?\n\n**SCP-6159-2:** Gotcha.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** But first, I need to say goodbye. Dr. Lynn. I appreciate what you have done here. I recognize how… difficult I was for all of you… So allow me to say thank you. Deeply. I am in your debt, and I shall make it up to you in some way. I will also attempt to make it up to your Foundation.\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** I must however apologize in advance, you are not going to like what I am going to say next.\n\n**Dr. Lynn:** ... What do you mean?\n\n//[SCP-6159-1 picks up the book it dropped near its chair]//\n\n**SCP-6159-1:** When assisting someone with an addiction, and you wish for them to quit //cold turkey,// what is the first thing that you do?...

Łucre is measured by the milliliter with one human soul equating to 616 ml of Łucre. It is denoted by “Ł,” not to be confused with the symbol for the cryptocurrency Litecoin. It is unknown if this is a coincidence.[[/footnote]], and I, Adrian, plus any family member bearing the name “Fatish,” will expect to be treated as if we were human, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for all intents and purposes. I will visit my loved ones often, and I will appear as a human whenever needed, as to not disrupt your veil.\n\nPlease note, this document is metaphysically binding. Upon being signed by an administrator, both the SCP Foundation and I will be responsible for the obligations presented until both parties mutually agree to terminate. Both parties must make this decision of both sound mind and body.\n\nSigning this document is the only means of having me return to SCP Foundation property of my own volition. If you choose not to employ me, I shall extend this offer to a different entity.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n__[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6159/Primrose_Fatish_Von_Trevil.png width=\"50%\"]]__\n\nAdministrator Signature:\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n__@@                                                                                   \t@@__\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"font-weight: bold; background:#fff url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat;\"]]\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n||~ YEA  ||~ ABSTAIN  ||~ NAY ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-1[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-2[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-3[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-4[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-5[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-6[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n||  ||  || [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-7[[/span]] ||\n||  ||  || [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-8[[/span]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-9[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-10[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-11[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-12[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-13[[/span]] ||  ||   ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[ + ] LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE\" hide=\"[ - ] LEVEL 5 CLEARANCE - O5 Council\"]]\n\n||~ O5-X ||~ Account Name ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-1[[/span]] ||  [[*user Siddartha Alonne]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-2[[/span]] ||  [[*user The Pighead]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-3[[/span]] ||  [[*user TheDarkArtist]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-4[[/span]] ||  [[*user Detective Marw]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-5[[/span]] ||  [[*user winkwonkboi]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-6[[/span]] ||  [[*user Starch Tuber]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-7[[/span]] ||  [[*user Dr Asteria]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-8[[/span]] ||  [[*user Prime Girl]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-9[[/span]] ||  [[*user Crow-Cat]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-10[[/span]] || [[*user Ethagon]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-11[[/span]] || [[*user coolguy00]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-12[[/span]] || [[*user MontagueETC]] ||\n|| [[span style=\"color: green;\"]]O5-13[[/span]] || [[*user Mrmetonica]] ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| [[span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-family: Stencil; font-size: 140%; color: green; padding: 3pt 3pt;\"]]APPROVED[[/span]] ||\n[[/div]]\n\n**Closing Statement:** The O5 Council has elected to accept SCP-6159-1’s proposal as an alternative means of containment.
