It is the cumulative consciousness of all living beings in the Catskill Mountains, be they insect, plant, or animal. Every organism in the mountains has its own city, however, the only stable one is located in the dreamspace of ##red|**Van Rip**##. One million thanks upon Van Rip for his creation lest we be tossed into the next world. The result of this is that Zamadenbora is incomprehensibly large with the end forever in mystery.\n\nMapping Zamendenbora is extremely challenging because the landscape is constantly shifting and changing due to the fragile nature of the physical world. The only stable land in Zamendenbora is the de facto capital of ##red|**Asisiteer Mij**##. Every moment an insect is born or a sapling emerges from the ground, another country is born. Their will manifested by \"Nature\" and sent two worlds beyond. Sent once to the Oneiroi, then again into the maw of Zamadenbora (blessed be thy name).\n\nAccording to records in the Wesleyan Library of the OW, our king, Van Rip, founded the waystation of Asisiteer Mij in 1819. There are no requirements for access to Asisiteer Mij, but it is recommended that this be your final destination.\n\nThe city’s total land area is 314.1592 km² in diameter and the terrain is that of a temperate rainforest. The only season in Asisiteer Mij is spring and the sun and moon cycle every 24 hours, however, the ##red|**climate and sky exist for only aesthetic purposes**##.\n\nAt the end of 365 cycles, the ruler of the area, Van Rip the Magnificent, cuts one blade of grass. When every blade of grass has been cut in all of Asisiteer Mij, one day has passed. That is how the residents of Zamadenbora track time.\n \nTo call Asisiteer Mij \"a city\" would be a farce. For it is simply a traveling point to the greater calling of Zamendenbora. When the life of an Oneiroi fantasist comes to its zenith, there is still one place left to go, one last beast to traverse, a final land for the dreamers to dream about. \n\nUnlike other dreamscapes, there is no time for those who come here. Time is not “coded” into the structure of Zamendenbora. It passes in what seems like infinitesimally small amounts. This is the ##red|**final resting stop**## for those who call themselves “travelers.” \n\nZamendenbora is a ##red|**land of freedom**## (in laymen's terms it is a strict extreme science fiction-verse). You can be who you want to be, but only once is a change allowed. This is the only law. Dreamers have tried to change their appearance more than once, but these attempts have granted them the final rest. \n\nNot even Van Rip knows who controls Zamendenbora. Many assume that it is the collective ##red|**bestowal of nature**##, transferring their undying will. The cities of the Catskill are irrational and nonsensical in both content and area.\n\nThere is, fortunately, no way to leave Zamendenbora. When you arrive in Zamendenbora you will find yourself in Asisiteer Mij and on all sides of Asisiteer Mij is the ##red|**infinite landscape of the beasts**##. Communication outside of Zamendenbora is erratic at best and errors are frequent. It is assumed that the lands are so vast that they distort messages sent to and fro. Yet such as all endeavors into the workings of the Great Unknown, Zamadenbora, we have yet to find an answer. \n\n\n##purple|**Bless those who come, for they can go nowhere else.**##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div float: right; border: none; width: 150px; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n\n[[span style=\"margin-top: 10px; color: #black; background-color: white; border: white; width: 2px; padding: 0px 5px;\" text-allign: center;]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:center; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\n\n[[image https://i.postimg.cc/Cx0jh9rz/Central-Catskills-from-Twin-south-summit-1.png width=\"32%\"]]\n[[/span]]\n\n[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n^^##006400 | Witness the Edge of Infinity, Asisiteer Mij##^^\n\n^^**De Facto Capital**^^\nAsisiteer Mij \n\n^^**Largest City**^^\n??? \n\n^^**Official Languages**^^\nEnglish\nAnt\nTree\nAir\nMountain \nAnimal\netc...\n\n^^**Ethnic Groups (2023):**^^\n86.1% Noncon\n12.7% Free Consciousness\n1.2% Corporeal\n\n^^**Demonym:**^^\nThose whose dreams are ending\n\n^^**Government:**^^\nAnarchy (Mag͠o͢c̶͠r̸͢͏á͢cy p͜e͏r̛hap҉s?̴̵͢)\n\n^^**Time Economy:**^^\n1 Zamendenboran Year ≈ 5.7978216e+45 Earth Years  (estimated)\n\n^^**Population:**^^\n≤∞\n\n^^**Human Population:**^^\n15,453,321\n\n^^**Reality:**^^\nAn Infinite Spiral Betwixt Two Infinite Curves\n\n^^**Psychology:**^^\nFree\n\n ^^**Privilege Status:**^^\nExtraordinary (a Yin-Yang of Extra and Ordinary)\n\n^^**Immigration Status:**^^\nT͜h̴i͜͝s̡̕ ̵̶͡Ì͟͝s̛ O͘͡͠n̶͜l̨y͏̴͢ ̨̛T͞hè ̨Fi̵̢rs̛̀͢ţ ̀͢͠\n\n^^**Emmigration Status:**^^\nNot Possible\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size 0.75em]]\n##orange| //They loved the land.//##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:left; weight: semibold; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; color: black; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\nLast Editied 5:34 AM ZBST by Friend and Disciple of RVJ\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; color: red; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\n[VIEW EDITS] [**LEAVE**] [**COMMENTS**] \n[[/span]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(/local--files/experimental-2-no-tocar/archivelogobackground.png) center top no-repeat ; float: left; width: 400px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n\n...There are very few reasons why dreamers come to Zamadenbora. I came because I was dying. There was a revolt in one of Xiupania’s derivative cities and I was assigned to go as a journalist. During one of the battles, a Nightmare jumped onto my vessel and slashed my throat (it most likely thought I was a defector). I tried to cry out but there was no voice. I was afraid of death... it's too similar to reality. And isn’t escaping reality why we let the Oneiroi embrace us?\n\nI fell to my knees and I opened my dreamscape map and looked at my meager accomplishments. And then I saw it. A small dot at the edge of the map, sturdy in its construction. \n\nI never realized it was there until now. Something came over me, and I decided: \"Why the hell not? I'm dead anyway.\" I jacked out of the battlefield and using a lightspeed beacon I jumped into the country, blood spilling out the whole way. I manifested at the top of Majinester Hill. \n\nThat was over 1,623 Earth years ago. And my neck still hangs a little outside my body. The blood is still flowing but so slow that it has never moved. \n\nIt is very hard to describe what Zamadenbora actually is. All we know comes from the first resident Van Rip and he dislikes talking. I hypothesize that he is the incarnation of the \"Earth\" or something of the sort. His actions are, remarkably, not like that of a \"normal human.\" But I digress. After exploring the small station at the front of this world, Asisiteer Mij, I was set aback at Zamadenbora's magnanimity. Later, I set up an information desk near the center to try to explain what little available we know of this place. Now I am the oldest person residing in the this land (besides Van Rip of course). \n\nMy predecessors and my mentor, Alparslan Nicolaou, all left to explore and find the limits of Zamadenbora, but from what we gathered from information left behind there most likely is no end. Even if there is one, how could we find it? The geography of this land changes every day. I actually think that something in the air of Zamadenbora stops us from going mad, how else can I be sane after staying in the same place for millennia!\n\nBut what’s most interesting is that no one is upset. Of course, many attempts to escape or jack out of the Oneiroi but to what end? Is this not the goal of all dreamers? They left reality behind; the next step is to leave Oneiroi behind.\n\nWe exist in the next dream “level” and it was written down 456,412 years ago that Van Rip was the creator of this place. I've been watching and analyzing him for the past 340 years but have found nothing yet. How far can we travel down this rabbit hole of dreams and what will we find at the end?[[size 0.75em]]\n##orange| //They tried to study the land.//##\n[[/size]] I am the last of my generation of dreamers who still hold onto the past with Asisiteer Mij. I believe that you were never meant to stay here long and I think my time is up. Soon I will become a traveler again and find the limit of Zamadenbora. Maybe then I can find out the true reason for this heaven.\n\nA whole universe, ripe for exploring, all waiting to be unlocked…\n\n,,Log Date: Earth Year 9,634,132 B.C.,,\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div float: right; border: none; width: 150px; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n\n[[span style=\"margin-top: 10px; color: #black; background-color: white; border: grey; width: 2px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;\" text-allign: center;]]\n\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n> **The Universe Is In Our Grasp, Yet We Stay Here**\n> ,,Free and Waiting to be Read,,\n> \n> “I read this book and it convinced me to leave Asisiteer Mij.

Nearly three million residents have left the traveling station of Mij due to the new information, intent on following the letter and leaving Zamadenbora. Escaping this level of reality is our dream and now it might be fulfilled.\n\nWicked residents of Zamadenbora have renounced the letter as fake calling forward the accounts of the most insane resident of Zamadenbora, Van Rip, who͘ h͠a͝s͟ no̸ted҉ in th̴e p͘àst ͟tha̶t ̛not a ̸s͟i̶ngl̨e̸ p̢e̡rs̶ón͠ ͏o̴r m̧e̸ssa̕ge͜ ̕has ̧e̶v̷e͢r̛ ̀re̡turn̷e͜d i҉n̛ ̧the near͜ly̶ t͏h͞irt͠y-͞s̵ix ͜t͝r̴ill҉i̧o͟n̶ ye͜ars̨ o͘f A҉s̴isi͜t͟eèr Mij's̨ e̴x̵istence.̀ But we know they lie.

He hypothesized that the destruction of the protoverse that exists within Zamadenbora will allow us to find an exit. \n\n928 excursions have occurred with them all ending in failure as it seems that the will of \"Nature\" becomes unhappy when we attempt to start a crusade against it. \n\nBut I have hope, as the writer of this newspaper, that the next excursion will lead us to an exit. \n\n[[size 1.2em]]\nWe plan on annihilating the cities highlighted in red.

There is an incalculable amount of cities in Zamadenbora due to the fact that all life in the Catskill Mountains acts a host for its own distinct country.\n\nTests have shown that when a dreamer is in a state of extreme despair or near death, they will become hyper-aware of the location.
