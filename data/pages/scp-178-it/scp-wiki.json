Said habitat must replicate [# the freshwater marsh where it was found], with a minimum temperature of 290 degrees Kelvin and a maximum of 295 degrees Kelvin.\n\nThe waters of the containment habitat must be populated by a varied fish fauna consisting mainly of salmonids (//Salmo trutta// and //Salmo trutta marmoratus//), percids (//Perca fluviatilis// and //Micropterus salmoides//) and cyprinids (//Tinca tinca// and //Cyprinus carpio//). The aforementioned marine fauna constitutes the source of nourishment for SCP-178-IT. The acidity of the water must be checked weekly.\n\nThe habitat must be equipped with six sleeping gas diffusers and must be monitored at all times by four officers armed with tranquilizer rifles.\n\nAccess to the area is only granted to Foundation employees with clearance level 2, equipped with chemical protective suits and who have completed the appropriate wildlife management course.\n\nSCP-178-IT's Special Containment Procedures are currently being reviewed for possible changes. See Addendum 178-004.\n\n**Description:** SCP-178-IT is the name assigned to three biological entities in a symbiotic association. The entities in question are the following:\n\n* SCP-178-IT-1 is a male specimen of theropod dinosaur belonging to the //Baryonix walkeri// species, 3.75 meters tall, with an overall length of 9.50 meters and an estimated weight of 1.8 tons. The apparent age of the specimen is difficult to interpret, but by comparing it with the only (almost complete) fossil specimen of its same species found so far, it is plausible to consider it a juvenile specimen. On its left thigh, it has an aberration of its scales in the shape of a letter \"F\", presumably caused by a burn. Attempts to discern information about its health and internal biology following blood draws were inconclusive (additional information in Addendum 178-003). The back of SCP-178-IT-1 is covered by sedimented layers of algae, moss, scales[[footnote]] Presumably following the phenomenon of ecdysis, commonly referred to as \"moulting\". [[/footnote]] and mud with an approximate thickness of three centimetres.\n* SCP-178-IT-2 is the collective name applied to the swarm of mosquitoes that accompanies SCP-178-IT-1, feeding on its blood. Phylogenetically, the instances of the swarm[[footnote]] Approximately five hundred. [[/footnote]] present similarities with the subfamily of the Anophelinae, suggesting that they may belong to a, as of yet, unidentified species, which lived during the Lower Cretaceous, presumably during the Barremian stage[[footnote]] Between 125 and 129.4 million years ago . [[/footnote]].\n* Both SCP-178-IT-1 and each instance of SCP-178-IT-2 are hosts of an anomalous parasite belonging to the //Plasmodium// genus. More information provided in addendum 178-003.\n\n**Addendum 178-001 – Retrieval and apprehension:** On 06/09/200█ at 8:05 am, SCP-178-IT is located within a dense marshy area near Canal ███████ (VA). Its position is obtained by [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SIR-I SIR-I \"Aureæ Notitiæ\"] following the interception and decoding of a transmission which took place in the area, during a broader investigation into suspicious activities of the GoI known as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#CFO Fascist Council of the Occult]. Below is the intercepted communication.\n[[div class=\"siddo-style\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**[[size 170%]] Interception of Encrypted Transmission SIR-I - 178 - 1[[/size]]**\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[f>image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/SCP_Foundation_(emblem).svg/1200px-SCP_Foundation_(emblem).svg.png width=\"100px\"]]\n\nOn 06/09/200█ at 5:01 am, a transmission is initiated between a team of four agents of the Fascist Council of the Occult and a sector chief on a two-way radio. They are located in the vicinity of ██████ ███████ (VA).\n\n------\n**[LOG START]**\n\n**Corporal Starace:** Transmission started. Sector chief, do you see us?\n\n**Sector chief:** Loud and clear, Starace. Are you in position?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Yes sir. Me, the Private First Class Bevilacqua and the soldiers Carnazzi, Rossi and Albini are preparing to enter the area.\n\n**Sector chief:** I would like to remind you that the use of lethal force should only be considered in cases of serious danger.\n\n//The field agents begin to slowly advance through the marsh. The sound of water and the buzzing of insects can be heard continuously for fourteen minutes.//\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Fuck, the humidity in this place...\n\n**Pvt. Rossi:** Were you expecting the beach? It's a swamp.\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Never been in a swamp before.\n\n**Pvt. Albini:** You know who to thank for that. I pray to the //Dictator// that this place will end up like the others...\n\n//The sound of a slap and impact is heard.//\n\n**Pvt. Albini:** ...so maybe these fucking mosquitoes will go extinct, Christ.\n\n//They advance for another three minutes. The hum becomes louder.//\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** How many a-\n\n**Pfc. Bevilacqua:** Sh. Corporal, four o'clock. The hum seems louder in that direction.\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Rossi, Carnazzi, tranquilizers. The rest of you, rifles. Get behind those bushes and don’t get heard.\n\n//They proceed in silence. The hum becomes even more intense.//\n\n**Sector chief:** Starace, are you in position? What can you see?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** In position. Sector chief, I can see the devolved by a body of  water… but it’s covered in mosquitoes and it’s not alone.\n\n**Sector chief:** Elaborate. Are there more devolved?\n\n**Pfc. Bevilacqua:** There’s an individual, has a white anti-contamination suit and is next to the devolved.\n\n**Sector chief:** Next to it? Do they look unharmed?\n\n**Feminine voice:** [Unintelligible] ...splendid. Never... [Unintelligible] ...like you.\n\n**Sector chief:** What are they doing?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Taking… samples. Blood of the devolved, some of the mosquitoes.\n\n**Sector chief:** You believe it could be the Foundation?\n\n**Pfc. Bevilacqua:** Doesn’t look like it. \n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Can confirm, Sector chief, the enemy doesn’t use that kind of suit and that’s not their logo. There are… two Fs on it, on the back of the suit. How do we proceed, Sector chief?\n\n**Sector chief:** Starace, stop them immediately. The devolved belongs to us, arrest the individual.\n\n//Sounds of bushes being trampled and safeties being taken off. The buzz is overwhelming. Some parts of the conversation are reconstructed based on audible fragments and context. Others are unintelligible.//\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** You, move away from the de-evolved!

Starace:** You keep her at gunpoint. Let's get the intruder out of here first, then we'll deal with the devolved.\n\n//Soldier Albini quickly moves away to reach her.//\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** [Unintelligible] still hasn’t moved?\n\n**Pvt. Rossi:** Maybe it’s sleeping?\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** With open eyes?\n\n**Feminine voice:** Ut dormiē[Unintelligible] amplexū di[Unintelligible] febrĭs.\n\n**Pvt. Albini:** What? Corporal, she said-\n\n//The sound of a jaw snapping and flesh tearing is heard.//\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** ALBINI!\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** SEDATE IT! ROSSI, CARNAZZI, NOW!\n\n//Following Starace's order, the transmission becomes incomprehensible due to the buzzing. Indistinct screams and sounds of movement can be discerned through the water. After three minutes, the audio becomes intelligible again.//\n\n**Sector chief**: Starace, are you safe?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Yes sir... but we lost Albini, the devolved moved suddenly and got him...\n\n//Starace is breathing heavily. He coughs a few times.//\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** ...don’t know where the others are.\n\n**Sector chief**: Regroup and retreat. At least confirming the presence of the devolved doesn't make your mission a total failure.\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Corporal... \n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Carnazzi! Where’s Rossi and Bevilacqua?!\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** I... lost sight of them during the escape, sir. We went in... different directions.\n\n//Carnazzi also coughs violently.//\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Which way did you see them go? We need to find them and retreat, quickly.\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Yes sir. They were... I think they went to nine o'clock.\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** You \"think\" it?\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** I apologize, sir. I think I hit my head walking away.\n\n//Starace sighs deeply and is seized by another coughing fit.//\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Corporal, are you feeling well?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** No, Carnazzi. Absolutely not. Walk, we will find Rossi and Bevilacqua. We'll come back for Albini if the bastard leaves him in one piece, and we'll discuss your unforgivable incompetence when we’re safe.\n\n//Starace and Carnazzi proceed through the marsh for the next twenty minutes. The coughing attacks of both become more and more frequent as well as more and more violent. Occasionally, Carnazzi makes sounds of pain. Starace sighs irritated.//\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** What is it, Carnazzi? Hit your head again?\n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** Sir, my head feels like it's exploding...\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** A jog and some cold water and you're already on death’s door?! Is this behaviour befitting a young fascist?! \n\n**Pvt. Carnazzi:** No sir, I apologize, sir...\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Keep up then, by God! March or rot, Carnazzi!\n\n//They proceed for thirty minutes. The cough doesn't stop and both of them are almost hyperventilating.//\n\n**Pfc. Bevilacqua:** Cor… poral…\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Bevilacqua! Are you hurt?! Carnazzi, to me, immediately! \n\n**Pfc. Bevilacqua:** Corporal... the dragon... did you see it? \n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Don't talk! Carnazzi, first aid! Carnazzi?! Where the hell are you?!\n\n//A loud splash is heard in the water.//\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Carnazzi!\n\n**Sector chief:** Starace, what's happening?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** Carnazzi fell into the water face down! He’s not moving!\n\n**Sector chief:** As for Bevilacqua?\n\n**Cpl. Starace:** He's sweating, coughing and babbling! He can't even get up! Ngh, fuck! Sector chief...\n\n**Sector chief:** Starace?\n\n//Another loud splash is heard.//\n\n**Sector chief:** Can you hear me? Bevilacqua? Carnazzi?\n\n**[END OF EXTRACT]**\n\n------\n\n**Note:** //The Sector chief attempts to communicate with Starace’s team without receiving a response. Occasionally coughing, groans of pain and retching are still audible. The communication is interrupted fifteen minutes later, when those sounds also stop.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the decryption, a joint force from [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SSM-VI SSM-VI \"Mater Morbi\"] and [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#SSM-IV SSM-IV \"Pugnus Ferri\"] is dispatched. SCP-178-IT is found safe in the central area of the marsh. It shows no injuries and is not in an altered state. The individual who was present at the scene is not found, nor the means of transport she had used. This suggests that she was able to leave the swamp before the field agents arrived.\n\nThe individual, now identified as PoI-367, is presumably female. Based on what was reconstructed from Starace team's transmission, it can control or manipulate SCP-178-IT through anomalous abilities not yet clarified. Based on what could be gleaned from the interception, it was concluded that PdI-367 is linked to the GoI known as [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#FF Febris Pharmaceuticals], or is employed by the latter. More information on this can be found in Addendum 178-002.\n\nThe bodies of Starace’s team agents are identified. Soldier Albini is the only one to have suffered lethal wounds caused by SCP-178-IT-1 while the rest of the team has an indefinite number of stings from SCP-178-IT-2, but no wounds. From this it is deduced that mosquitoes may be the vehicle of a third lethal anomalous element, identified as SCP-178-IT-3. The members of the Starace team are sent to Site Asclepius for analysis.\n\nA medium-sized armoured vehicle belonging to the Fascist Council of the Occult is found five minutes away from the perimeter of the swamp. No documentation regarding the operation is found inside. It is reasonable to think that the Starace team had a preparatory reconnaissance task. Since the area and the anomalous presence within it are known to two different GoI, the possibility of containing SCP-178-IT //in loco// is not feasible.\n\nThe Zoological-Botanical Division requests the possibility of analysing the behaviour of SCP-178-IT in the wild until an appropriate habitat for it is prepared in Site Ceres. The request is granted and an ethological analysis is carried out by Dr. Giuliana Salazar, palaeontologist, and by Dr. Agostino Fini, herpetologist. Lieutenants Caronia and Mattei, responsible for surveillance of the area and of the joint force, guarantee safety for two weeks.\n\nOn 06/23/200█, SCP-178-IT is sedated and transported to its habitat at Site Ceres, first via helicopter to take it out of the marsh and then via armoured vehicle. As a further precautionary measure, anti-mosquito nets are used. The aforementioned do not seem to intend to move away from SCP-178-IT-1 during capture and transport, but nevertheless demonstrate hostility towards agents who approach it.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 178-002 - Historical references and archival data \" hide=\"- Addendum 178-002 - Historical references and archival data\"]]\n\nFollowing the discovery and recovery of SCP-178-IT, further research is initiated on the Canal ███████ (VA) marshland in the RIDIA archives. The information found in the corresponding file, under the name Nero-107, is of limited usefulness and fragmentary, probably due to interference by the Fascist Council of the Occult.\n\nInside the file there is a summary of stories, legends and nursery rhymes regarding the swamp, areas similar to or geographically close to it. The elements that these stories have in common, traced by RIDIA national folklore scholars, are listed below:\n* Most of the events narrated have the structure of a moral story aimed at the youngest members of the community; the teaching is often to avoid approaching specific places;\n* In almost all texts, the locality is a swamp, a peat bog or a forest in which there is a body of fresh water; generally, it is inaccessible or complicated to navigate and untouched by human activity;\n* The presence of a monster that lives near the body of water is recurring, similar to the mythological figure of the sea serpent, the wyvern or the dragon;\n* It is worth noting that the most common cause of death of protagonists who venture in the forbidden places is not actually being devoured by the dragon as one would expect;\n* The negative consequences of the transgression manifest themselves with a form of poisoning caused by the \"pestilential breath\" of the creature; the latter is identified as the cause of a lethal disease.\nThe file also contains a letter from the construction site foreman Artemio Cattaneo, dated 04/12/1925, addressed to the Villoresi Canal Irrigation Consortium by which he had been employed.\n\n[[module CSS]]\n@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cinzel);\n@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=La+Belle+Aurore);\n@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Kristi);\n@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Special+Elite);\n\n.ridia-sfondo{\n    background-color: #f8ecc2;\n    color: #5a2d0c;\n    width: 90%;\n    padding-top: 5px;\n    padding-right: 30px;\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\n    padding-left: 30px;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n.ridia-titolo{\n    font-family: 'Cinzel';\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 26px;\n    line-height: 150%;\n}\n\n.ridia-documento{\n    font-family: 'Cinzel';\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 14px;\n}\n\n.ridia-testo{\n    font-family: 'La Belle Aurore';\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    line-height: 150%;\n}\n\n.ridia-typewriter{\n    font-family: 'Special Elite';\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-size: 13px;\n}\n\n.ridia-firma{\n    font-family: 'Kristi';\n    font-size: 42px\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"ridia-sfondo\"]]\n[[span class=\"ridia-typewriter\"]]\n\nTo Your Excellency.\n\nI regret to inform both the president and the board of the Villoresi Canal Irrigation Consortium of the unfortunate and inconvenient situation in which both I and my workers found ourselves the past few days.\n\nWhen I found the letter from the Consortium on my desk, which requested the contribution of the Cattaneo Construction Company, I cannot hide that I felt great pride and joy. Ours is, alas, still a small business and working for such a respected and renowned organization as yours would have been an honour.\n\nDespite the distance of the place where the operation would be carried out from the company headquarters, I was willing to make an extra effort, strong in the knowledge that the choice of the Consortium itself was emblematic of our competence and seriousness.\n\nA week ago, we therefore started the hydraulic reclamation of the marsh near Canal ███████, following the necessary preparation. However, we were unable to continue it due to what I struggle to define as mere accidents. On April 3rd, four of my workers fell gravely ill. They were sweating profusely and feverish. I immediately had them taken to the doctor in the nearest town and put a stop on all the works.\n\nThey tried to cure them with quinine, I myself thought it was malaria without being a doctor. Yet it didn't help. That evening all four were dying, babbling about a monster they said they had seen emerging from the murky waters. The next day, they were all dead. The doctor from Canal ███████ said he tried everything he could, but the disease progressed too quickly. He also told me something I should have known before. Something that the Consortium deemed legitimate to hide from me.\n\nI discovered the bitter truth, the real reason why the Cattaneo Construction Company was chosen by the Consortium. The doctor informed me that three construction companies in the area (D'Antonio Brothers, ███████ Constructions and Impresa Vivaldi) received your letter with the same request that I also received. They, however, refused, aware of the danger of the place where the construction site was supposed to be located.\n\nFor this reason, I find myself forced to request the termination of the contract between the Cattaneo Construction Company and the Villoresi Canal Irrigation Consortium. Far be it from me to discourage your organization from proceeding with its noble Work. However, I vehemently advise against including the ███████ Canal swamp in said Work, as this has already condemned four workers in their prime to unjust deaths that will weigh on my soul for the rest of my life. I hope that you, like me, want the aforementioned victims to be the last.\n\nBest regards,\nArtemio Cattaneo\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFurther research is carried out using the texts kept in the archives of [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/siti-italiani Site Deus] and it is focused on the link between Febris Pharmaceuticals and SCP-178-IT. A fragmentary study by the Christian quaestor Lucius Valerius Gallico (... - ca. mid-4th century AD) focusing on the topic of the pagan cults of northern Italy is found in a manuscript dating back to the 9th century. Below, the analysis of the relevant fragments by the Historical-Archaeological Section.\n\n> From the components handed down, it is clear that Gallico does not treat the cult of the goddess of fevers lightly. In other parts of the text, he accepts the possibility that some pagan cults could be absorbed into the Christian faith, [...] however, he vehemently advises against this happening for the cult of Febris.\n> \n> The part of the text that concerns its faithful resembles a real invective, an oratory aimed at accusing them of a series of despicable and anti-social behaviours that justify their complete eradication. It is safe to assume that the conduct of the cult has been thoroughly investigated and studied by the //quaestor//.\n> \n> In the moment that corresponds to the //narratio//, the author shows the followers of Febris in the marshy areas of northern Italy, intent on practicing magic. He describes a ritual (or part of it) in which followers invoke the goddess and her gifts through what the author calls \"monstrum sigillum ferens\". The translation in this case is uncertain due to possible errors in copying the text.\n> \n> He also accuses them of carrying out curses and hexes aimed at public figures in the cities of Brixia and Mediolanum (including himself among the aforementioned), invoking malarial fevers on them. He subsequently declaims an \"evil component\" (//pars maligna//) of the aforementioned hexes: \"Ut dormiētis omnes in amplexū divae Febrĭs\", an invocation which can be roughly translated to \"may you all [sleep/lie/die] in the embrace [of diva/of the goddess] Febris\".\n> \n> [...] He concludes by stating that the same treatment that Galba had reserved for Lucusta [[footnote]]The name of an extremist assassin and follower belonging to the cult of Febris.[[/footnote]] and her stock three centuries ago, is the same that Constantine should reserve for all those who venerated the goddess.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 178-003 - Parasitology\" hide=\"- Addendum 178-003 - Parasitology\"]]\n\nThrough the blood samples taken from SCP-178-IT-1, the studied instances of SCP-178-IT-2 and the analysis carried out on the bodies of Starace’s team members, the Microbiology Division confirms the suspicion of the presence of a third anomalous element. The aforementioned is a parasitic protist of prehistoric origin named by the research team //Plasmodium draconis//, belonging to the same genus as the sporozoans that are capable of causing malaria in humans and is, plausibly, their ancestor. Below are the most significant findings.\n\n> [[=]]\n> **Parasitological study of //Plasmodium draconis//**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> **Author:** Doctor Gregorio Corsetti\n> \n> **Life cycle:** In terms of life stages, use of reservoirs and hosts, //P. draconis// exhibits similarities with the protozoa belonging to its own genus: (1) it starts from the infection in the human body of sporozoites following the bite of a Diptera of the Culicidae family; (2) sporozoites subsequently colonize liver cells (3) to develop into merozoites, (4) which are specialized in infecting erythrocytes (5) with the aim of replicating asexually and producing gametocytes, capable of sexually reproducing; (6) following a mosquito bite, gametocytes will generate male and female gametes to produce zygotes; (7) the zygotes will mature into ookinetes, (8) which will then split into sporozoites, which will be transmitted with the insect's saliva into the new host.\n> \n> However, while the life cycle of parasites of the same genus lasts several days depending on the species, that of //P. draconis// is found to be much shorter, lasting an average of 3 hours if in-host and reservoir stages are included. This brevity is to be considered the evolutionary push at the root of the development of the protozoan’s anomalous properties, which allow the survival of hosts and reservoirs.\n> \n> **Phoinixin:** In non-anomalous species of the genus //Plasmodium//, cells are destroyed by the escape of parasites following infection of hepatocytes and erythrocytes. This, however, is not the case with //P. draconis//. This anomaly has been traced back to the action of a molecule whose structure and mechanisms of action have not yet been identified: the molecule produced by the parasites themselves, identified with the name Phoinixin, has the purpose of regenerating the membranes and restoring the base functions of the cell.\n> \n> [...] Given the extraordinary longevity of the subjects SCP-178-IT-1 and SCP-178-IT-2, it is hypothesized that this molecule, propagated in the blood circulation, is capable of keeping the cells of each functionally active tissue, as long as a nutritional intake compatible with the host's diet is guaranteed. In addition to the above properties, the substance causes a limited number of alterations in the host’s and reservoir’s behaviour.\n> \n> [...] Unfortunately, although the biological samples obtained from the subjects are optimal, isolating and tracing a structure of the biochemical agent has proven impossible. Although known metabolites were identified, it was not possible to trace the original molecule using the molecular biology techniques available to the Microbiology Division.\n> \n> **Neurobehavioral alterations:** Given that the sporozoan must rely on a host and a vector constantly present to guarantee the survival of the protozoa and given the species-specificity for animals belonging to the Spinosauroidea superfamily, it can be deduced that //P. draconis// has developed the production of Phoinixin in order to induce an obligate symbiotic condition. This forces instances of SCP-178-IT-2 not to voluntarily move away from the host beyond a radius of two meters.\n> \n> Mosquitoes that have SCP-178-IT-3 in their organism cease all biological or behavioural activity, except for nutrition via hematophagy (to the detriment of the host), self-defence or defence of SCP-178-IT- 1. During the transfer to Site Ceres, instances of SCP-178-IT-2 were observed attempting to inoculate agents with //P. draconis//, in an attempt to protect the host. In the case of the members of the unprepared Starace team, they were successful: the presence of //P. draconis// in a foreign organism caused rapid multiorgan failure due to the cytotoxic effect of sporozoites and merozoites.\n> \n> [...] Behaviours associated with reproduction were found to be very limited. Following observations, it has been noted that SCP-178-IT-2 reproduces only when the number of instances is lower than a certain threshold: in this case, SCP-178-IT-1 will remain in in its nest and will wait for the larvae to mature until they reach the adult stage. Following analysis of juvenile instances of SCP-178-IT-2, it emerged that they also have //P. draconis//’s gametocytes, but they are in a hibernation phase. This suggests that the protozoan is capable of metabolic activation only in the mature stages of the insect, thus activating its anomalous properties.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 178-004 - Ethology:** Below the ethogram, compiled by Dr. Salazar and Dr. Fini during the two-week observation period of SCP-178-IT, can be consulted.\n\n|| **Observed behaviour** || **Description** ||\n|| **Movement** || It moves on its hind legs. It walks little and very rarely runs. ||\n|| **Nutrition** || It crouches on the edge of a body of water and remains completely still. When a prey (fish fauna) gets close enough, it quickly lunges its head forward and grabs it with the end of its snout. After tearing it, it lifts its head and swallows it whole. If the fish is too large to swallow, it uses the claws to break it into smaller pieces. ||\n|| **Rest** || During daylight hours, it looks for a sunny area, preferably on soft ground. Once found, it lies down on its right side and rests is head against the ground, keeping its eyes closed. At night it does the same but inside the nest. ||\n|| **Supervision** || It immerses itself in the water, head raised. It looks around cautiously, remaining in position, camouflaged thanks to the muddy plate on its back. ||\n|| **Vocalization** || It has a low voice, comparable to that of the emu (//Dromaius novaehollandiae//) or the Australian cassowary (//Casuarius casuarius//). It generally emits rumbling or muttering noises, some of which approach infrasound. ||\n|| **Aggressive behaviours** || It stands on its hind legs and arches its back, as if preparing to leap. It emits a rumble so low that it is almost inaudible to humans to intimidate any adversaries. ||\n|| **Comfort behaviours** || It scratches against the bark of trees using its claws. ||\n|| **Abnormal behaviour** || It collects objects such as branches and aquatic plants and brings them to its nest. Reacts playfully to auditory stimuli. Read \"Anomalous Behaviour - 1 - 06/13/200█\"||\n**Anomalous Behaviour - 1 - 13/06/200█:**\n\n> At 17:05, after three hours spent hunting and four hours spent resting, SCP-178-IT-1 moved away from the observation area for approximately one hour. Upon its return it was holding, in its front claws, a walkie-talkie, presumably dropped by one of the CFO agents during the escape. The aforementioned device, damaged, only repeated the sounds it received. SCP-178-IT-1 deposited it in its nest and then began to interact with it. It initially poked at it with its front claws and then made a rumbling noise, which was repeated to him by the device.\n> \n> Following this, it began to exhibit previously unseen behaviours. It \"conversed\" with the device, making noises at a higher pitch than the growls it usually uses to vocalize. Then it started making sudden and abrupt movements: it shook its head from right to left, moved its whole body up and down and finally did some pirouettes.\n> \n> It then gave an excessively strong bite to the device, breaking it and stopping the repeating sounds.\n\nFollowing the transfer to Site Ceres, Dr. Salazar, with the support of Dr. Fini, proposes an official review of the special containment procedures for SCP-178-IT. A meeting is granted with director Passini and deputy director Foriani to explain the aforementioned review.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶▶▶ Meeting regarding the containment of SCP-178-IT\" hide=\"◀◀◀ Meeting regarding the containment of SCP-178-IT\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"siddo-style\"]]\n**[LOG START]**\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Shall we get started?\n\n**Dr. Passini:** Please do.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Excellent!\n\n**Dr. Fini:** Doctor Passini, as you are surely aware, Doctor Salazar and I were assigned two months ago to the study project regarding SCP-178-IT.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** The //Baryonyx// in the swamp.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** That's right, doctor!\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** Is something wrong with its containment?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** No, doctor. The habitat is what we requested with the specifications we requested and-\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** So what is the reason for this meeting? You will have an important reason, I hope.\n\n**Dr. Fini:** Of course, doctor. I ask you to view the third page of the form which...\n\n//Dr. Salazar hurries to provide the forms to the director and deputy director.//\n\n**Dr. Fini:** ...which we have provided to you.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** What you see on page three is SCP-178-IT-1 in the swamp where it was found. On June 10th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th and, finally, 22th.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** Is there anything we should take notice of in these images?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** The fact that there is nothing to take notice of is exactly what is noteworthy, doctor. You see, SCP-178-IT-1 remains immobile for most of its day. It spends two to three hours hunting and then spends the rest of the day motionless and at rest. Sometimes while awake and sometimes while asleep but it is incredibly rare that it does anything other than these two things.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** The number of comfort behaviours we have observed is minimal, almost non-existent.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** Ergo, SCP-178-IT-1 does not exhibit behaviours that go beyond those necessary for survival.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Exactly, doctor. However, if you want to scroll to page five…\n\n**Dr. Fini:** Six.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Yes! Page six, right. That's SCP-178-IT after a very particular event!\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** What is it doing...?\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Dancing! F... um, following an unexpected event, we took a photo of SCP-178-IT-1.\n\n**Dr. Purpose:** It wandered away from its usual fishing area for just under an hour and returned with a walkie-talkie in its claws. Was probably lost by one of the CFO agents, it was still on but malfunctioning, just repeating the sounds that it received.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** What's really interesting, though, is how it reacted! It laid it in its nest and began to interact with it, to communicate! The truly incredible part was its behaviour afterwards. It started to… well, dance, as you can see!\n\n**Dr. Fini:** We think that it assumed a \"playful\" behaviour as a reaction to the sounds echoed by the walkie-talkie, believing it was another one of its own species.\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** And how is this relevant to us? What do you propose?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** We would like to propose some changes to the containment procedures of SCP-178-IT-1. They are found on page eight.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** \"The addition of speakers that emit sounds similar to those of SCP-178-IT-1.\"\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Exactly! Also, the possibility to play music and occasionally introduce objects that it can add to its nest and interact with.\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** Are you suggesting that we introduce toys into the habitat?\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** The presence of objects to interact with is very important for mental health and…\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** Doctor Salazar, we are not talking about a parrot. SCP-178-IT-1 is not just any beast and Site Ceres is not a zoo.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Doctor Foriani, that's not what-\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** If there’s nothing else, director, I think we can conclude the meeting and move on to the-\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Fabrizio is a highly intelligent animal, doctor Foriani! It's not just any \"beast\", you are right about that. It may be the last of its kind, unless Febris Pharmaceuticals has others!\n\n//A few seconds of silence pass.//\n\n**Dr. Passini:** ...Fabrizio?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** She’s referring to SCP-178-IT-1.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** I had guessed it, Fini. But why Fabrizio?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** [Whispered] Jesus Christ...\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Because it has an F on its left thigh, it is a fisher and… its muzzle looks like it’s smiling.\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** And what does that have to do with-\n\n**Dr. Passini:** \"All’ombra dell’ultimo sole si era assopito un pescatore\" [[footnote]]“In the shadow of late sunset, fell asleep a fisherman.”[[/footnote]], Foriani. Fabrizio de Andrè’s song.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** Exactly! Um... and it's easier than calling it SCP-178-IT-1 every time.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** Doctor Salazar, as much as I understand what you feel when observing what is basically a revived fossil, given your specialization, I must remind you that SCP-178-IT-1... for convenience Fabrizio, is an anomaly and must be treated as such. Unless you have a more concrete motivation to alter its containment procedures, I'm afraid I should consider this meeting concluded.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** I...\n\n**Dr. Fini:** We have a decidedly concrete motivation, doctor. Page eleven.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** [Whispered] Do we have a page eleven?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** It was observed that Fabrizio did not react in a hostile manner to the CFO agents until the woman who was present on the scene uttered some kind of formula, or an order. Likewise, the \"Mater Morbi\" agents who approached him did not elicit any reaction from it.\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** Where are you getting at, Doctor Fini?\n\n**Dr. Fini:** During the observation, Fabrizio very rarely showed behaviours that went beyond eating and resting. The parasite that infected it took away everything except the foundations of survival... yet that woman was able to awaken a hostility and territoriality that it barely demonstrated to the otters in the area. She commanded it as if it were an automaton.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** The sounds of the walkie-talkie and the objects it occasionally picked up, however, stimulated its intellect, bringing it back to its natural behaviours. Fabrizio needs these stimuli.\n\n**Dr. Fini:** Thanks to these stimuli, there is a real possibility that its intellect will remain lively enough to thwart a new attempt by Febris Pharmaceuticals to... \"make it hostile\". We would avoid damage to the facility and save lives of staff members.\n\n**Dr. Salazar:** At the same time we would have the opportunity to observe the \"true\" behaviour of a therapod, albeit in captivity.\n\n//Silence follows for a couple of minutes.//\n\n**Dr. Passini:** What do you think, Foriani?\n\n**Dr. Foriani:** The outcome of the changes is not guaranteed... however, the cost of making them is relatively small. In the best-case scenario, a containment breach would be prevented. At worst we would have the opportunity to use current procedures as a contingency.\n\n**Dr. Passini:** Thank you. And I also thank you two for your arguments. Your proposed review will be duly considered.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-177-IT]]] | SCP-178-IT | [[[SCP-179-IT]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Doctor Fulgrim, Heck_Tech.
