  "content": "Received cross test request from Researcher ███ ██████ to cross test SCP-294 with SCP-913 this request was denied. Researcher ██████ requested to type \"Drink to satiate hunger\"  into SCP-294. We don't need to do this and I ask that all researchers stop requesting this I don't know if this is some kind of April fool's joke but I got 30 separate requests from 30 separate researchers for this test yesterday April 1st. We have a way to contain and feed SCP-913.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tilda David Moose, Site 19 Director",
