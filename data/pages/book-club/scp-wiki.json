Normally, he wasn't supposed to bring any of this stuff out of the Document Storage Wing, but Dr. Ozid had given him permission to get some work done in the break room today; as the newest member of Stationed Task Force Mu-12 (\"Book Club with the Gals\") and the --old book sorter-- //Junior Assistant Library Organizer//, he had an awful lot of awfully boring work to get through– the least his supervisors could do was give him a change of scenery (//literally// the least they could do- he was entitled to break room privileges, and by letting him take the documents they ensured he'd keep working.)\n\n     Sitting down and brushing away the neon orange cheese powder that rolled in clouds from the weirdo in the corner, Elijah got to work. Mu-12's primary purpose was to organize and catalog anomalous literature- or at least, the senior members were supposed to. Elijah, on the other hand, was given 5 filing cabinets worth of non-anomalous prose and a level 2 key card and told to get cracking. Credit where credit is due- it may be less exciting than the actual literary anomalies, but there's a far lower chance of melting your brain out your ears by mispronouncing a word or rewriting history by reading the wrong page.\n\nWith his thoughts settled, Elijah grabbed the first file and started annotating.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+ Document 3838-4.1\n++ //The Ballad of The Scarlet Khan//\n[[<]]\n\n**Background:** In 1999, a Foundation researcher on vacation near their hometown of Oglanly, Turkmenistan, found the following ballad written in a book of ancient folk rhymes among the native Oghuz Turks. Believed to originate from the Marketplace period of SCP-3838, the ballad was extracted by the researcher and relayed to Provisional Site-3838. A copy of the book with non-anomalous subject matter was put in place, and currently has neutralized all threat of an informational breach.\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/book-club/mtf.png) center no-repeat ; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 570px; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%; border: none;\"]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%; border: 1px dashed #000;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; width: 50%;\"]]\nWhen all is naught but Dust and Blood,\nAnd scarlet soldiers ride\nOur once great world reduced to mud,\n##850b03|He## comes to claim ##850b03|His## brides\n\nThe Erikesh have lost their spark,\nThe Khansmen soon as well,\nThe urns now fall to endless dark,\nThe great pearl houses hell.\n\nThe black moon howls and wails in fear,\nThe king of oysters screams,\nThe child of summer drawing near,\nA vanguard for ##850b03|His## queens.\n\nWith law of concrete, law of blood,\nAnd law of howling, third;\nThe men of earth shall fall in floods,\nAs ##850b03|His## great prison blurs\n\nThe world shall fall to ##850b03|Khnith-h'gor##,\n##850b03|The God of Dark Below##,\n##850b03|His## children’s children march to war,\nTheir eyes a crimson glow.\n\nAnd on that day, when battle comes\nAnd hellish armies walk,\nThe ##850b03|Scarlet Khan## and his wartime drums,\nWe’ll fall before ##850b03|Kharahk##\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right; width: 50%;\"]]\nВен алл ис наут бут Дуст анд Блоод,\nAнд скарлет солдиерс риде\nоур онсе греат ворлд редусед то муд\n##850b03|Xe## цомес то цлаим ##850b03|Xис## бридес\n\nЗе Ерикеш хаве лост тхеир спарк,\nЗе Кансмен соон ас bелл,\nЗе урнс ноь фалл то ендлесс дарк,\nЗе греат пеарл хоусес хелл\n\nЗе блак моон хоьлс анд bаилс ин феар,\nBиыл кинг оф оыстерс дреамс,\nЗе чилд оф суммер драьнc неар,\nА вангуард фор ##850b03|Хис## ьуеенс\n\nВит лаь оф цонцрет, лаь оф блоод,\nАнд лаь оф хоьлинг, cирд;\nЗе мен оф еарт шалл фалл ин флоvс,\nАс ##850b03|Хис## греат присон блурс\n\nЗе ворлд шалл фалл то ##850b03|Khnith-h'gor##,\n##850b03|Тхе Год оф Дарк Белоь##,\n##850b03|Хис## чилдрен оф хис чилдрен марч то щар,\nЗейр еыс а кримсон глоь.\n\nАнд он тхат даы, щхен баттле цомес,\nанд хеллиHERE армиес щалк,\nЗе ##850b03|Скарлет Кан## анд хис щартиме друмс\nЩе щилл фалл бефор ##850b03|Каьраьк##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ Document 5545.2\n++ //Munroe's Remorse//\n[[<]]\n\n**Background:** Found within an instance of [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5545 SCP-5545-1], the following document is believed to be written or otherwise created by SCP-5545-2.
