Call me Panik.\n\n= With an opinion the size of my walls of text and a fascination with dumb shit, I proudly present my author page. I'll keep things as neat as I can, but it's me. No guarantees. \n\n= Who knows where any of this goes, tbh? I came here with no expectations and I can comfortably say I've exceeded them. \n------\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab My Work]]\n= While I'm a fantasy writer to the bone, I've learned a lot about the nuances to my tastes as I've matured. I'll always have that magical core to my work, but here I hope to catalogue more than just some magic systems and thaumaturgy. \n\n= I have a keen interest in noir settings, investigations, apocalypses, disease, solarpunk. All-in-all, there's a lot of ground I have to cover, but I'm pretty sure I can curate a small collection of stories to really transport you.\n\n= I mean, I'm a perfectionist, so I'll do my best. \n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8717 SCP-8717 Libra, Equilibrium in Hand] ||~ Wherein a man goes to the hospital.||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/clean-up-for-customer-082 Clean-Up for Customer 082] ||~ Wherein Beau cleans a house. ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beau-goes-for-a-run Beau Goes For a Run] ||~ Wherein Beau sits down. ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/her-future-in-bloom Her Future in Bloom]  ||~ Wherein a life ends. ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-poorly-in-profile A Poorly in Profile] ||~ Wherein we meet a villain. ||\n|| Spear of the People (Working title.) ||~ Drafting ||\n|| Poorly at the Periphery (Working title.) ||~ Drafting ||\n|| Retrieval Log (Working title.) ||~ Draft Hell ||\n|| XXXX ||~ Coming Soon ||\n|| XXXX ||~ Coming Soon ||\n|| XXXX ||~ Coming Soon ||\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Teamcon 2025]]\n= I was never one for writing with other peoples' characters, but as this plan developed in our team server, I couldn't help but fall in love with the lush and dangerous Site 101 and Site Director Beatrice. Of course, there's fertile ground there at Site 101 and I'm definitely going to be writing about it more. \n\n\n||||~ Teamcon 2025 ||\n||~ Part One||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/her-future-in-bloom Her Future in Bloom] by Mr Panik||\n||~ Part Two||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7493## SCP-7493] by Socksesforfoxes||\n||~ Part Three||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-101 Secure Facility Dossier: Site-101] by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thechunk TheChunk]||\n||~ Part Four||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-small-doses In Small Doses] by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thechunk TheChunk]||\n||~ Part Five||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fruit-of-the-poison-tree Fruit of the Poison Tree] by Socksesforfoxes||\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Poorly Plans]]\n||~ These are Poorly Plans in progress.||\n\nBefore I joined the Wiki, I had to make sure I had an idea and so, House Poorly was born. Here I'll unpack the value of what we create to ourselves and others, the desire and the willingness to create, and the duty we feel to our purpose as creators.\n\nIf you like character driven narratives, maybe they're a GOI you can make good use of. The series below is going to be a closed series, but as this unravels, if anyone would like to contribute, please feel free to reach out here on Wikidot.
