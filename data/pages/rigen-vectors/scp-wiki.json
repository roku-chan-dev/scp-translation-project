Fuck it, I'm making an artist (gallery) page. You can't stop me FBI, I don't live in America, //muahahahaha//\n\nI hereby affirm that all arts featured in this page are my own creation, and have been released through the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n------\n= Stuff I made for the Instagram Art Contests\n= ^^//totally not salty that Instagram compression wrecked the quality// Edition^^\n------\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=3171|caption= [https://www.instagram.com/p/CCyTHpFlaFc/ Entry to First Instagram Art Contest] |width=300px|align=right]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[[SCP-3171]]] is my favorite explanation on how the Foundation got all of their amnestics. Instead of depleting a mobile seaweed forest or feeding an E E L god thing, just open up a ███ hotline!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=masq.png|caption= [https://www.instagram.com/p/CGz40qTF__F/ Entry to Second Instagram Art Contest] |width=300px|align=left]]\nBroken Masquerade be like.\nThis is a bit of more vague and broad conceptual piece, instead of specific article, with Juche tower because what else would be in North Korea amirite?\n\nI literally just googled \"North Korea Landmark\" tbh.\nKinda surprised they let it be an entry.\n\nRemember Korea.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=ityh.png|caption= [https://www.instagram.com/p/COBOi_yFOkP/ Entry to Third Instagram Art Contest] |width=300px|align=right]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n//Nurufufufu//\n\nNo, it's not Assassination Classroom fanart. ...well, not consciously.\n\nThis is [[[SCP-2399]]], the Malfunctioning Destroyer. The already comical rendition was made worse because there were a far better 2399 art a couple entries earlier. //sigh// cycle of life.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=6669C.png|caption= [https://www.instagram.com/p/CXf5oGsBTA4/ Entry to Fall 2021 Instagram Contest] |width=300px|align=left]]\nYes, I drew a \"fanart\" to [[[SCP-6669|my own SCP]]] lmao.\n\nHalf of the inspiration to the actual drawing (other than the SCP itself, ofc) is pretty clearly from Halo rings. The other half is because I thought a bolt-action megastructure is funny—though I initially drew the action backwards on the sketch.\n\nI sucks at drawing cylindrical objects on Inkscape. I should probably have drawn them boxier, but eh.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n------\n= Stuff I made for SCP community in general\n------\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=Spider_eldritch.png|caption= [[[SCP-6600]]] Spidercon's Logo with extra legs |width=300px|align=left]]\nKara didn't ask me to make this logo, the idea just sprung fully formed inside my head when se proposed the idea to make 6kon into spidercon.\n\nI sent ser the version without the hind legs, so it only has four frontal legs. The massive hind legs don't really fit as header logo. I also didn't make the rainbow/Pride version.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=dado|caption= [https://www.deviantart.com/riyangendut/art/u-trust-dado-832019371 u trust dado] |width=300px|align=right]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\nself-explanatory. u trust dado. was a meme.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=calca2.png|caption= [https://www.instagram.com/p/CYEv_E-B43Q/ 10th SCP Wiki Holiday Art Exchange gift] for [[*user winkwonkboi]] |width=300px|align=left]]\nChibi Calcaruler!\n\nI struggled a bit with the staff and the orb and just resigned to put random math symbol on top of them.\n\nKinda interesting how proportions change can alter an art so much. But that's besides the point.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n------\n= Stuff I made in [http://scp-idn.wikidot.com/ SCP Foundation Indonesia] community\n------\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=http://scp-id-sandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/sandbox:rigen/hpflfnl|caption= [http://scp-idn.wikidot.com/ajisaka-bhayangkara Special Detachment 00]|width=300px|align=right]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\nInspired by the Special Detachment 88 Anti Terror (Densus 88 Antiteror), Special Detachment 00 Anti Klenik \"Ajisaka\" was a GoI I was writing in SCP-IDN, a special detachment of police dedicated to anomalous warfare. Like UIU, I guess. \"Klenik\" was a general word referring to most things related to magick and superstitions. \"Aji Saka\"/\"Ajisaka\" was an ancient mystic who was said to have overthrown cannibal king Dewata Cengkar through cunning and magical aptitude, leading the Medang Kamulan kingdom into prosperity.\n\nBrown and orange are inspired by police uniform. Two //keris,// bound by blue ribbon—the color of the ribbon isn't really symbolic or anything. //Keris// is a traditional and often mystical weapon, by binding them symbolizes dedication in disarming criminals with anomalous capability.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"nart\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=balkares.png|caption= [http://scp-idn.wikidot.com/arsip-kontes-17-agustus-scpfi Entry to SCPFID Youtube Channel's 17 August 2021 Contest] |width=300px|align=left]]\n\nIt is an inter-city [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_race sack race,] with the SCP Foundation Indonesia Youtube's hosts as participant.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"spc\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/==]]",
