However, public knowledge of SCP-7527 has been growing exponentially by non-anomalous means since 2017, and continued exposure carries a risk of an LK-class \"Lifted Veil\" scenario, at minimum.\n\nAs such, Foundation webcrawlers are to suppress as much information online about SCP-7527-A as possible, particularly among conservative communities on social media. Journalism pertaining to SCP-7527-A is to be discreetly intercepted and removed. \n\nAll seven instances of SCP-7527-B are kept in a standard containment locker at Site-59. Viewing SCP-7527-B for research purposes may only be done by employees with a score of 50 or higher on the Naismith Memetic Resistance test. Upon discovery, additional instances of SCP-7527-B are to be reclaimed and contained in the same manner.\n\nDue to the circumstances of SCP-7527-B's recovery, research is ongoing into the level of threat posed by SCP-7527-A. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7527-A is Sylvester \"Slimmy\" Kincaid (Hereafter SCP-7527-A), an American film actor who allegedly starred in 489 motion pictures from 1935 until his death in 1978.\n\nNo birth certificate, death certificate, or other civilian documentation have been found for SCP-7527-A. All studios responsible for his films have been unable to locate evidence that SCP-7527-A was ever an employee, or that production was even attempted on any of his films. For all legal intents and purposes, SCP-7527-A never existed.\n\nThere are currently only two forms of evidence for SCP-7527-A's existence:\n* 18 people who claimed to have worked with SCP-7527-A. Only three of them are still alive at the time of writing: Clint Eastwood, Malcolm McDowell[[footnote]] \"Ugh, don't remind me. Whenever Slimmy made direct eye contact with me, I always got this feeling that I just shit my pants in Church.\" [[/footnote]], and Mel Brooks [[footnote]] \"I still don't understand how that bozo made it past my casting director. I gave him one line: \"Look, fella, Yugoslavia's //that// way!\" He tried it five times - and with every reading, it sounded more and more like he's the kinda guy who fucks rats for a living. I fired him on Day One.\" [[/footnote]]. Eastwood[[footnote]] \"Slimmy was the keystone for the movie industry's integrity. On his deathbed, he told me I was the only one capable of carrying on his legacy. I wept so hard that I vomited. I don't deserve that kind of praise - no one does. No one but Slimmy.\" [[/footnote]] is the only one among these three who expressed any positive opinion of Kincaid. However, all expressed ignorance of more specific details about SCP-7527-A.\n* 7 instances of SCP-7527-B, VHS videocassettes of the following films starring SCP-7527-A:\n * //Horse!//\n * //Everyone In Montana Is Now Mrs. Kincaid//\n * //Nope, That's Not How You Do It//\n * //I Ain't Your Tovarisch//\n * //What Does a Prairie Dog Deserve?//\n * //A Full Colorado Breakfast//\n * //What Happens To People Who Don't Like Beer//\n\nSCP-7527-A appears exclusively in Westerns and plays either the leading man or a mentor figure. During these films, SCP-7527-A's character is unquestionably beloved by all characters except antagonists, never receives lasting physical damage, and goes through no character development. \n\nHe also exhibits anomalous strength and reality-warping abilities, but these powers are portrayed as something mundane that his character has always been capable of doing. As such, level of special effects is often incongruent with those available during the year of production shown in the film credits.\n\nThese films usually contain heavy-handed moral messages conveyed through SCP-7527-A's character. These messages are often bizarre and transgressive compared to films from the time of produciton; for example, //Everyone In Montana Is Now Mrs. Kincaid// is about SCP-7527-A's character violently coercing every individual being in Montana to marry him, including corpses, livestock, wildlife, plants, buildings, land, artworks, fictional characters, furniture, clouds, and concepts. \n\nReactions to these messages from other characters are universally positive by the end of the film, either through character development, subjugation, or eradication.\n\nSCP-7527-A's anomalous effects manifest when the name \"Slimmy Kincaid\" is heard or viewed by a human subject, who will then be compelled to aggressively defend the career, lifestyle, works, and values of SCP-7527-A - regardless of whether or not the subject knows of SCP-7527-A's existence. \n\nThis does not always happen with a human subject, but the chances of a manifestation event can increase if the subject has heard the name before, expresses conservative political beliefs, or is a fan/participant of romance and action films set in the American West and/or South.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Example 1]]\n> **Testing Log:** SCP-7527-A/42\n> **Date:** 7/15/2023\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Maria Gant\n> **Interviewed:** D-57159\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Gant:** Good afternoon, D-57159.

I take it you're here to interrogate me?\n> \n> **Niederman:** Not at all. We'd just like to ask you a few questions.\n> \n> **Harris:** To be fair, this is the first interview I've had in a room flanked by armed guards. It ain't too strange that I'd be apprehensive.\n> \n> **Niederman:** I suppose not. Does this mean you won't cooperate?\n> \n> **Harris:** I never said that. Just don't expect any nuclear codes from me. //(Chuckles.)//\n> \n> **Niederman:** This concerns what you were filming in the spring of 1965. Do you remember?\n> \n> **Harris:** Sounds like this coulda gone through my agent, but... what in particular?\n> \n> **Niederman:** //What Does A Prairie Dog Deserve?//\n> \n> **Harris:** Oh, um, okay, this took a hard turn. Let's see... don't think I've ever met a prairie dog in person, but I'd assume they deserve the same respect as any other -\n> \n> **Niederman:** That was the title of the film we'd like to discuss.\n> \n> //(Harris leans back in his chair, thinking intensely.)//\n> \n> **Harris:** Sounds familiar, but the memories are cloudy. Who else was in it?\n> \n> **Niederman:** You were playing a villainous animal rights activist opposite to Slimmy Kincaid.\n> \n> //(Harris slowly leans forward. His face grows redder as he glares at Niederman.)//\n> \n> I take it you remember now?\n> \n> **Harris:** Just so ya know, whatever heat those guards are packin', you're about five syllables away from bein' internationally known as \"the man who got the shit kicked out of him by Baloo the Bear.\"\n> \n> **Niederman:** I was not making a judgment of Mr. Kincaid. \n> \n> //(Pacified, Harris slumps back in his chair again.)//\n> \n> **Harris:** ...guess you weren't. Sorry about that.\n> \n> **Niederman:** Quite all right. We've been learning that it's a touchy subject for many people, but we'd like to know more about the man himself.\n> \n> //(Harris is silent for approximately ten seconds, staring at the ceiling.)//\n> \n> **Harris:** What really stuck out for me wasn't the movie. It was him. The look in his eyes, both dead and alive at the same time. The screen couldn't capture it, but it was like coals. Figure if I ever touched his eyeball, it would've been rigid. You could've broken a bottle on it and he'd only be irritated. But you couldn't irritate someone like Slimmy, not without him takin' something in return.\n> \n> **Niederman:** I don't follow.\n> \n> **Harris:** Oh, you //will.// There ain't a choice but to follow him. You'd understand if he ever went into //your// trailer and told you the //real// bare necessities. Like with me. He looked me dead in the eyes, told me...\n> \n> \"Phil, your body is skin upon adipose upon sinew, coarsely wrapping a bouquet of carefully arranged treasures - but what is the force that makes it move? Speak? Eat? Drink? You move forward with your life because it's the only thing your unconquered meat understands. You are an empty vessel, begging to be stained crimson. Individualism is the leprosy of the spirit. When you stop pushing back against dominance, you will understand that to be hurt is to be crowned god-king of all that is below you.\"\n> \n> //(Harris stands up, raising both fists.)//\n> \n> \"Eat a snake,\" he said! \n> \n> \"Why?!\" said I! \n> \n> \"I care not,\" said he! \"There can be no justification for anything done by your kind, there can only be the binary of accomplishment and being accomplished //upon!// You will no longer be revolting for //anyone but I!\"//\n> \n> //But no, I did not have a snake! So I made one. I made one! I pulled several costumes from the back of my trailer, tore them to insignificant shreds, braided a grotesque serpentine produberance from them forthwith, and by the screaming and pleading Nazarene's impalement upon Golgotha to an audience of uncaring aeons, I drew cute little snakey eyeballs on the tip and made it a snakely effigy! I forced it thus down my throat! Gagging! Choking! Vomiting! Rotting at the bid of the eternal emperor of my orgasmic fuck-nightmares, never let it stop, never let it -//\n> \n> //(At this point, due to his advanced age and heart conditions, security sedated Harris via a tranquilizer pistol. He was issued amnestics and released later that day.)//\n> \n> <End Log>\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n**Addendum 1 - SCP-7527-B:** All contained instances of SCP-7527-B were recovered from the basement of Hallingdans Manor, a farm in Rockford, IL that had been converted into a compound for the Children of the Scarlet King. On September 17th, 1988, due to infighting plaguing the organization's Great Lakes region, rival factions within the compound entered a five-day shootout, reducing the onsite population by 87%. As such, the Foundation was able to raid the compound without incident.\n\nSCP-7527-B-1 through -7 were initially believed to be mundane entertainment for the residents, analysis of the credits for every film indicate that the Children of the Scarlet King were at least partially involved with production. There were at least 158 additional videocassettes onsite, but they had been destroyed by fire. A partially destroyed mail-order catalog onsite named at least 482 additional SCP-7527-B films, listing them as \"long-form values pieces to help spread the word.\" \n\n**Addendum 2 - Excerpts from SCP-7527-B:** \n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-7527-B-1]]\n> **Film Name:** //Horse!//\n> **Co-Stars:** Malcolm McDowell (Deputy Paul Hatcher), Cloris Leachman (Sister Mary Bloodcow)\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //(Sheriff Kincaid and Deputy Hatcher rush to the edge of a cliff on their horses.

And no, you may not.\n> \n> **Hatcher:** Then what's the question?\n> \n> **Kincaid:** Was it //you// movin' them legs?

He sticks his tongue in the horse's ear. The horse suddenly starts screaming and flailing. Additional tongues slither out from the nostrils and the other ear. He sucks his tongue back in, causing blood and unidentifiable bits of gore to spew from the ear. The horse falls down, dead.)//\n> \n> **Kincaid:** //I win.//\n> \n> //(Hatcher stares at Kincaid, open-mouthed.)//\n> \n> **Hatcher:** ...what was that?\n> \n> **Kincaid:** It's self-explanatory.

I don't care what country you're in, whether it's America or non-America. But in any society, a man has certain needs he has to fulfill in order to keep himself at peace. If you can't meet those needs, you can't claim to be truly free, even from that throne of yours.\n> \n> **Nicholas:** The need to squish?\n> \n> **Kincaid:** So, here's whatcha do.

If they can, they pass.\n> \n> **Nicholas:** And if they can't?\n> \n> **Kincaid:** Then brand 'em \"squishies\" and force 'em to live out the rest of their lives squished into a two-foot steel cube with one hole to force-feed 'em.\n> \n> **Nicholas:** That idea is certainly interesting.\n> \n> **Kincaid:** I get the feelin' from your tone that you're thinkin' you have a choice. You asked me to name my prize, and I named it: give your Empire the nasty medicine it needs -- then not only will all your revolution worries be over, you'll also be free to build as many people-igloos as you want.\n> \n> **Nicholas:** Very well.
