Targets of SCP-7994 have on average a PSRV of 2.25, within the 95^^th^^ percentile of normalcy. Individuals are predisposed to experience spurious environmental and medical hazards; a subset of these effects, henceforth SCP-7994-A, is a predisposition to fatal attacks, plots, mechanical failures, and human errors. These hazards are dangerous to the target, individuals immediately near the target, and individuals known to the targets. \n\nUpwards of 900 individuals have been documented as afflicted by this imprecation since 1920; SCP-7994 is most typically invoked against gamblers,  business rivals, criminal adversaries, and witnesses. Notably, SCP-7994 has been invoked by the Costello-Reinfeld smuggling syndicate[[footnote]] The largest bootlegging ring in operation during alcohol prohibition in the United States. [[/footnote]] against the prominent Kennedy political family and people connected to the Kennedy family. \n\nSCP-7994-B is a gold ring; engraved on the inside band is the phrase \"Let no callamitie seperat amitie.\" The object was created as a contact-based psionic inhibition broadcaster[[footnote]] **Psionic Inhibition Broadcaster:** A mechanism broadcasting psionic particles which reduce or alter the electrovital activity of a target; a 'mind-control' device.

Secondarily, the object is a psionic defense mechanism which confers a low Psionic-Stochastic Risk Value to the wearer.\n-----\n+++ Addendum 7994.A1: Background on the Kennedy Family\nThe Kennedy political family are the highest priority SCP-7994 affected individuals. Responses to SCP-7994-A events related to the Kennedy family are consistently complicated by public scrutiny and criminal-political connections.\n\nThe Kennedy family has faced retaliation for Joseph Kennedy Sr.'s involvement with **[[[chicago-spirit|GoI-001]]]**:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[div class=\"excerpt\"]]\n= Excerpt from //Untold Riches: The Secret History of Gang Warfare in Chicago//, published 1992\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=350px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanlucky/scp-merchandise-mart.jpg\n|add-caption=false\n]]\nThe Spirit entered the year 1930 unchallenged. With Capone in prison yet again and Joseph Reinfeld defaulting on his debts, the deluge of liquor began to dry up. This was exactly the playing field the Chappell gang wanted, and so they called in that favor from the Caribbean.\n\nThe rum operation opened for business in March of that year; this time, Chappell had circumvented the need for overseas rumrunners. A Way had been forged, linking the distilleries of the Dominican and Cuba to the heart of Chicago. The police would testify that this Way was underneath Merchandise Mart. Kennedy Sr. had already found himself in the Spirit's line of sight, and, so Costello claimed, Kennedy lent his legitimacy and connections for this new bootlegging pipeline. On a good day, the Spirit moved thirty barrels of the nectar as if they were any other wholesaler. In six months, Kennedy's misgivings had settled; he pinched over two million dollars for his cooperation. This was of course a fraction of what the Spirit earned, but more than what Kennedy ever allegedly made working with Costello and Reinfeld. By November, Kennedy had cut his ties to all bootleggers except the Chappell gang.\n\nAlready before 1929 Reinfeld lost his place as the biggest bootlegger in America, but being snubbed by the Kennedy patriarch truly left his business high and dry. He felt it necessary to retaliate against the Spirit. Reinfeld had only five enforcers left in Chicago after gambling with the money that was supposed to pay them; their fates were all sealed when he appealed to his friend Joseph one final time. \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=350px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanlucky/scp-jpk-1930.PNG\n|add-caption=true\n|caption= Joseph Kennedy and an anonymous member of the Spirit.\n]]\nIt can be assumed that Kennedy attempted to convince his former associate to cut his losses. Kennedy definitely knew what declaring war on the Chappell family meant. Reinfeld couldn't be moved. He sent his five good men straight to the source, where the Spirit was lying in wait having been tipped off by Kennedy. Before the end of the day, six men laid dead in the underbelly of the Mart; four of Reinfeld and Costello's men, and two of Chappell's.\n\nKennedy had not only betrayed Reinfeld's plan to the Spirit, but also the police. CCSO Deputy Richard Cain elucidated on the stand that the police had a bargain with the Spirit that year. \"Sheriff Traeger wanted some amity with Chappell. He knew he was retiring soon\" Cain claimed. Rather than fight the Spirit, he alleged, the police helped Chappell clean out their competition. The hope was that, if the Chappell gang was the last one standing, the cycle of gangland-cop killings would simmer for the time. Cain said that he was there to round up the stragglers, while the Spirit and his fellow deputies waited below. \n\n= . . .\n\nThough Costello-Reinfeld were beaten down for the next few years, their business not only outlived prohibition, it outlived the Spirit. Kennedy had burnt his bridges with La Cosa Nostra and his old business partners, and now the Chappell family had dropped out of the game. He would pay the price, and have to spend the rest of that decade looking over his shoulder for hired guns. The mob was not done with him.\n[[/div]]\n\nIn the years following the dissolution of GoI-001, Joseph Kennedy was an alleged target of the Costello crime family. He described a pattern of extortion and blackmail which only escalated as he rose in political prominence. Coinciding with these direct threats on their lives by organized crime, Kennedy also alleged accidents and acts of violence have claimed the lives of half of his children. The fatal calamities befalling the Kennedy family, which are anomalous and cannot be attributed to malice action, are an effect of SCP-7994. Over a twenty-five year period, these incidents may be attributable as SCP-7994-A events:\n\n||~ Date ||~ Incident ||\n|| 08/12/44 || Airman Joseph P Kennedy Jr. and his copilot are killed in action over East Suffolk, England.

Bush was instructed to provide this ring to a third party who could use psionic influence to oust president Franklin Delano Roosevelt; however, this attempt was thwarted when Smedley Butler, the prospective SCP-7994-B candidate, exposed the plot.\n\nInstead, Prescott Bush gave SCP-7994-B to his son and future president George HW Bush (PSRV .45). HW Bush's inherently tychomantic[[footnote]] **Tychomancy:** The practice of thaumaturgic probability manipulation. [[/footnote]] psionic trace is amplified by SCP-7994-B.  HW Bush was educated for military service and at age 20 became the Navy's youngest airman. Through WWII, HW Bush participated in 58 missions in the Pacific and performed with distinction. In one particular incident during WWII,  HW Bush was the sole survivor out of a crew of nine airmen in part due to the stochastic influence of SCP-7994-B.\n\nEnrolling in Yale business school, HW Bush would join the Skull and Bones Brotherhood like his father. Between 1948 and 1957, HW Bush tapped eleven newly discovered oil wells in Texas and California found through divination. These factors initiated his induction as a psionic correspondent for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn 1959, as part of a mutual-interest disclosure agreement, the CIA provided the following memo:\n\n[[div class=\"archive\"]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"background: url('https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanlucky/cia.png') bottom center no-repeat; text-align: left; width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 15px; padding: 0px;\"]]]]\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"jarhead\" style=\"color:firebrick;\"]]**TO BE DISTRIBUTED 10/10/59**[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanlucky/scp-psionic-inhibitor.png\n|add-caption=false\n|caption=\n]]\n\n[[span class=\"jarhead\"]] **INTERNAL MEMO**[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"jarhead\"]]To all agents concerned;[[/span]]\n\nA psionic broadcaster is a dangerous device which causes damage to your electrovital impulses.

It's my hope that, whoever becomes president, that these programs which put our children through school only grow and that we give our children more with which to work. \n\n**Smith:** Mr. Vanocur with a question for Senator Kennedy.\n\n**Vanocur:** Senator, the main theme of your campaign has been a decline in American power and prestige this past eight years.  What in your view has the executive office failed to do to secure America's position, and what can be done to reroute such a decline in the next four years?\n\n**Kennedy:** The question here, and it weighs on our minds,  is, \"What will this do to our future?\" I've been critical of the president. In fact, I would return to the previous point and say that the president has failed to equip our children for the future. The issue of our prestige isn't solved if we are held back...  \n\n<//From 35:39 onward, an oscillating buzzing sound is recorded on the studio cameras.//>\n\n**Smith:** Mr. Vice President.\n\n**Nixon:** First off, I believe the Senator should make up his mind as to my responsibility.

Where do you and the current administration's policies differ in response to Fidel Castro's movement in Cuba?\n\n**Kennedy:** I think, and I think most of America agrees, that Nixon and Eisenhower's soft opposition to Castro is not in the interest of the safety of our Latin American neighbors. The economic quarantine is not doing its job. This administration has been far too slow to act. Continuing to do so would amount to nothing more than appeasement. I—\n\n**Nixon:** //Appeasement//?

No, Mr. Warren, communism is not winning in the Western Hemisphere. We will— I will promise you that communism will not last on our doorstep. We will not condition our country to see the world through the eyes of defeat. The Castro regime is the result of long-term missteps.

And so, I say... I would say just that.\n\n**Smith:** Okay, question from Mr. Vanocur.\n\n**Vanocur:** Senator Kennedy, a lot of eyes are on the headlines that talk about scandal in Hollywood or New York.

As president, how would you direct these investigations at a federal level?\n\n**Kennedy:** Well, I would hope to enable the whole country against organized crime. The Justice Department must be the link between state law enforcement agencies, because men like Jimmy Hoffa skirt the law every state he goes, so yes—  \n\n**Nixon:** Why don't you talk about the Chicago mob?\n\n**Kennedy:** What did you ask? \n\n**Nixon:** Why not talk about the union votes they're grabbing for you, huh? \n\n**Smith:** Mr. Vice President, refr—\n\n**Kennedy:** Now that is the most ridiculous claim.

Lin resided in Milford, Connecticut, traveled to the scene of the attack solo, and had no known connections with violent political or criminal organizations. The psionic inhibition broadcaster was of the mass-produced Soviet variety. Kennedy's paradoxical psionic reaction was a psionomanic response attributable to SCP-7994. \n\nAnticipating further attacks, the US Secret Service and Central Intelligence Agency agreed on full cooperation between agencies and the Foundation regarding the candidates' security. \n[[/div]] \n\nSCP-7994-B inoculated Agent Bush against the psionic attack which he had witnessed on television. Bush had been the only dispatched agent capable of entering the debate hall while the broadcast device was active. Following this attack, Bush submitted to the SCP Foundation for transparent analysis of his psionic trace, the capabilities of SCP-7994-B, and all CIA casefiles related to the Kennedy family. After conclusion of research, Bush announced his intention to bestow SCP-7994-B to the winner of the presidential race.\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=350px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanlucky/scp-jfk-bush.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption= CTF I-49 \"Eagle\" and President Kennedy.\n]]\n+++ Addendum 7994.B1: The Kennedy Presidency\nAfter the events of the Fourth Kennedy-Nixon debate, a convention of the Overseer Council and Department of Defense evaluated infiltration of the United States Executive Office as an ongoing **##firebrick|Code-Red##** threat. A landslide victory for Kennedy was predicted with 90% certainty due to subconscious psionic fallout. Senator Kennedy was determined to be psionically unfit for office and preliminary plans to impeach Kennedy were created. \n\nWhen the election results arrived, Kennedy's popular vote exceeded Nixon's by less than 120,000 votes; a smaller margin of victory than was predicted before the debate. The FBI Unusual Incidents Unit determined that election integrity had not been compromised by the televised psionic event. Kennedy received SCP-7994-B from Agent Bush after his election certification. Plans to incite his impeachment were disposed; the threat level was reduced to **##gold|Code-Yellow##**. Combined Task Force I-49 was established as a multi-organizational response team against future attacks on the mental integrity of the federal government.\n\nAgent HW Bush (henceforth I-49 \"Eagle\") maintained the dual position of captain of the task force and director of psionics at the CIA for approximately one year. I-49 \"Eagle\" was removed or resigned from his CIA position in November of 1961 due to refusal to participate in **[[[https://www.encyclopedia.com/politics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/operation-mongoose|Operation Mongoose]]]**, but retained his position on the task force to protect the president's family. \n\nThrough all Foundation tests and one field incident, President Kennedy was consistently electrovitally inert when bearing SCP-7994-B. Cooperation in psionics research led to the creation of countermeasures operating on this same principle. Selective broadcast devices have been installed in vehicles and buildings in frequent use by government and Foundation personnel, which detect high-intensity psion fields and release nullifying opposite-charged psions in response. However, occurrence of uncontrolled psionic-stochastic incidents increased at a rate which CTF I-49 could not secure. Over a two-year period, at least eleven fatalities related to SCP-7994-A afflicted the Kennedy family, CTF I-49, and others:\n[[div class=\"transcript-short\"]]\n[[>]]\n04/20/61\n[[/>]]\n----\n**Incident:** A Douglas B-26 bomber carrying an I-49 agent and two others was returning to base following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

He was struck by a drunk driver moments after attempting to cross the street. This was the fourth off-duty vehicular accident to incapacitate an agent, and the first to be fatal.\n\n**Commentary:** Following this death, procedures regarding PSRV testing were implemented regularly. It was discovered that the PSRV of all I-49 agents as well as general associates of the Kennedy family escalates with exposure, with some agents have ratings as high as 2.45 after ten months of service.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"transcript-short\"]]\n[[>]]\n09/12/62\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Incident:** A CIA agent with psionic weapons made an attempt on the life of Fidel Castro (est. PSRV .75). Castro displayed a \"temporary personality disorientation\" during a speech as a result of a psionic broadcasting device. The device malfunctioned causing the agent to glow brightly and stand out from within the crowd. The attempt was thwarted with no ill effects to Castro and the agent was executed.\n\n**Commentary:** In another attempt, the Justice Department under Robert F Kennedy (PSRV 2.15) would propose criminal immunity to Chicago Outfit leader Salvatore Giancana if his organization imprecated SCP-7994 upon Fidel Castro. No information is available regarding the implementation of this arrangement; all other attempts on Castro's life end in failure.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOver the same period, at least four attempts were made on the lives of RFK and EMK. The assassins invariably were influenced by psionic manipulation when the attacks took place. On 10/10/62 attempted assassin Laura Ramos was apprehended:\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n= [[span class=\"excerpt\"]]Incident #7994-249[[/span]]\n**Prior:** Robert F Kennedy and Edward M Kennedy were residing in the Langham Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts.
