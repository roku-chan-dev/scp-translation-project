Any civilians who reach SCP-5801's designated red zone are to be amnesticized and relocated by posted guards. All testing and interviews involving SCP-5801-1 instances are to take place outside of the barrier surrounding SCP-5801.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5801 is an undisclosed location in Nome, Alaska. A barrier composed of an unknown transparent material surrounds SCP-5801. The barrier is 7 m in height, and encloses an area that is 22.4 m in diameter. Both instances of SCP-5801-1 and personnel are unable to pass through the barrier.\n\nSCP-5801 contains instances of SCP-5801-1, which are sapient beings composed out of three spherical masses of snow, and possess tree branches in the place of limbs. Materials making up the facial features of SCP-5801-1 vary, but recorded materials include sticks, leaves, berries, vegetables, and rocks. SCP-5801-1 instances possess the ability to speak and move, and have been observed to converse with each other on a regular basis.\n\nAccording to interviews with multiple SCP-5801-1 instances, SCP-5801 is an afterlife for deceased individuals whose effigies were shaped into SCP-5801-1 through a ritualistic process. Due to the absence of new SCP-5801-1 instances, it is assumed that this process no longer occurs.[[footnote]]Possibly due to the Foundation's awareness of SCP-5801.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum 5801-01: Interview Log:** The following is an interview with an instance of SCP-5801-1, referred to as SCP-5801-1-A. The interview was conducted by researcher Morrissey.\n> //SCP-5801-1-A waddles close to the barrier. SCP-5801-1-A bears facial features composed completely out of blueberries, and stands approximately 1.8 m tall. Researcher Morrissey stands on the other side of the barrier.//\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Hey, uh excuse me?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Pardon?\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Hi, my name is Morrissey. I’m a researcher working for the SCP Foundation. You probably see our team around here often. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions if you’re not busy.\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Well yeah of course. Ain’t a lot to keep me busy here anyways.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Alright then, can I get your first name please?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Yeah uh, it’s Pete.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Okay Pete, do you recall your life before you came here?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Thankfully yes.\n> \n> //SCP-5801-1-A lets out a chuckle.//\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** I was a farmer. I had my own little dairy company. Good lil’ farm I had there. It was a family business too.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Was the person who brought you here in your family?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Sadly, I don’t think I’m allowed to say.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** And why is that?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** They know y’all are monitoring this place, and they told me they’d send me to the “Frosted Abyss” if I told y’all who they were. What that means? Hell if I know.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Huh. Alright then. Perhaps you can tell me about the ritual that sent you here?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Well I didn’t hear about no punishment about telling y’all about the ritual, so I guess I can give you what I remember. On my deathbed they told me to “declare that I am truly afraid of death and wish to be frozen in this life” or something along those lines. Then they said some mystical mumbo-jumbo out of some spellbook, and then told me that my body would be buried in a mound of snow. It was to “preserve my essence in ice” or something like that.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Are you actually afraid of death?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Without question my friend, without question. I didn’t really believe in no god so I had no hope in an afterlife. I thought death would be the end of my consciousness and feeling. I was scared to death until they showed up. Of course I’m assuming I can’t tell y’all how I met them, so I’ll just leave it at that. And now, I’m here. Still conscious and all. Still don’t know what to feel about it.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Alright, thank you for your time. \n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-A:** Hey, anytime my friend. Again, there ain’t much to do around here so this was time well spent.\n> \n> **END LOG**\n\n**Addendum 5801-02: Interview Log 2:** The following is an interview with an instance of SCP-5801-1, referred to as SCP-5801-1-B. The interview was conducted by researcher Morrissey.\n> //SCP-5801-1-B is close to the barrier. SCP-5801-1-B bears two rocks for eyes, a carrot for a nose, and a mouth made from blueberries. SCP-5801-1-B stands approximately 1.2 m tall.//\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Hey, you there! The little guy!\n> \n> //SCP-5801-1-B turns around.//\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** Oh, hi! Are you one of those sciency people?\n> \n> **Morrissey:** (chuckles) Why yes I am. \n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** Cool! \n> \n> **Morrissey:** (chuckles) Yeah, I was wondering if I could ask you some questions.\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** Sure! Will it help with your science stuff?\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Why yes it will. \n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** Yay! I'm ready.\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Alrighty then. What is your name?\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** I'm Timothy, but you can call me Timmy!\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Awesome! Well Timmy, I was wondering how you got to this place.\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** Well, I had a thing called a brain tumor, and mommy and daddy didn't want me to die. So they took me to these people called the-\n> \n> //Before SCP-5801-1-B is able to finish its sentence, its facial features begin to slide down its face.// \n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** No, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to tell them, I didn’t!\n> \n> //SCP-5801-1-B's head inverts.//\n> \n> **SCP-5801-1-B:** No, please! Mommy, mommy...\n> \n> //SCP-5801-1-B's body begins to thaw, disintegrating into a mass of slush. The slush dissolves into water. A heart resembling that of a human’s remains in the middle of the puddle. Nearby SCP-5801-1 instances take notice of this event, reacting with a mixture of fear and sadness.//\n> \n> **Morrissey:** Oh god.\n> \n> **END LOG**\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5800]]] | SCP-5801 | [[[SCP-5802]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
