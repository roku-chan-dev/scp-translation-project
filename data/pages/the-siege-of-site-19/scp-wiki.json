You were always a bright researcher; it's not surprising to see you in such an esteemed position.\n\n**Bowe:** Formalities aside, I'd like to make something excruciatingly clear. You are defenseless. Your Field Disruptors may be a marvel of modern science, but our forces have rendered them useless. Our Foundation Elimination Coalition has more soldiers than can possibly be contained in Site-19, as large as it is. You have the advantage of being entrenched; however, with our teleportation equipment, I suspect this will not be a sizable factor.\n\n**Bowe:** We have cut off all modes of communication or travel to and from Site-19. We have one demand: the complete concession of Site-19 to the Foundation Elimination Coalition. All of its facilities and anomalies will belong to us. If this demand is not fulfilled in thirty minutes, we will attack Site-19.\n\n**Bowe:** While I'm here, I'd like to elucidate one of our objectives. We would like to avoid casualties. It takes brains to be employed by the Foundation, and it would be a shame if all those brains were spilled onto the ground. In the next thirty minutes, any personnel who surrender themselves to our coalition will not be harmed. In fact, you will not be taken prisoner. We'll simply erase your memory and ensure you are returned to your family unharmed.\n\n**Bowe:** Your thirty minute grace period starts now.

Moose.>//\n\n**Bowe:** Did you stop her brain?\n\n**SCP-140-A:** Yeah. Was I not supposed to do that? She would've turned us inside-out, you know.\n\n**Bowe:** Can you just keep her comatose?\n\n**SCP-140-A:** That's easy enough.\n\n//<SCP-140-A puts its hand on Dir. Moose's forehead. Red light emits from its eyes. Dir. Moose resumes breathing.>//\n\n**SCP-140-A:** Any particular reason why we need her?\n\n**Bowe:** There are two people in this building that have Foundation Level-5 Clearance. One is Dr. Kain Pathos Crow, who seems to have somehow escaped. The other is slumped in front of us.\n\n**SCP-140-A:** Ah. So you're trying to--\n\n**Bowe:** Yes, I'm trying the plan. The Coalition has captured the largest Foundation site in the world. However, the Foundation is currently mobilizing forces to take it back. Don't get me wrong, Tibon, our army is certainly powerful. However, we can't hope to hold this Site against the full might of the Foundation.\n\n//<Silence.>//\n\n**Bowe:** Control her thumb for me. I think it's time for us to go big or go home.\n\n//<End Log>//\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n//Sorry, Terry. This file is hard to find.

Maria Jones, General Bowe, Highest Priest Robert Bumaro, Master John Yttoric, SCP-140-A\n\n----\n\n//<Begin Log>//\n\n**O5-1:** You requested an audience with us, Bowe? You're not in any position to negotiate.\n\n**Bowe:** Oh, I am negotiating. In addition, our demands have changed.\n\n**O5-1:** Alright, then. What are your new demands?\n\n**Yttoric:** We demand to expel your foulness from this institution!\n\n**O5-6:** I'm sorry?\n\n**Bowe:** You'll have to excuse Yttoric. Our demands are as follows: the recognition that the Foundation Elimination Coalition owns Site-19, and the cessation of hostilities against Site-19\n\n**O5-13:** Hold on a minute. Are you out of your mind?\n\n**Dir. Smith:** You're not walking away from this with your head, let alone //the largest Foundation site in the Western hemisphere//.\n\n**Bowe:** Oh, but we will. Otherwise, we'll destroy it. I'm standing in Director Moose's office, which gives me full control over the site's containment systems. Any anomaly you have here, can be released into the world at large.\n\n**O5-2:** That's not the kind of leverage you think it is. Letting everything in Site-19 loose would be a pain in the ass, but we could manage it. It's not like all of our most dangerous anomalies are all in one site.\n\n**Bowe:** Let's see about that.\n\n//<Bowe presses a few keys on the keyboard.>//\n\n**Bowe:** That just disabled the containment measures for [[[SCP-953]]]. My men are escorting it outside. I recall having a hard time keeping that one in its box. \n\n//<Footage is broadcast from the front of Site-19. Two Chaos Insurgency infantrymen escort SCP-953 outside. It transforms into a winged fox and flies in the direction of the nearest civilian population center.>//\n\n**O5-3:** Director Jones, you're here, right? Could you revoke Moose's Level 5 clearance, please? That should take away his power.\n\n**Bowe:** Not a good choice, I'm afraid. You see, the Maxwellists have helped us set up a \"dead man's switch\" mechanism. If this computer is suddenly unable to access the containment systems, it instead triggers not only the on-site nuclear warhead, but the nuclear warheads of every site Moose's clearance works for. Her influence doesn't go as far as I'd hoped, but I can still take out Site-17 and Site-20 from here. You're still keeping [[[SCP-1790]]] there, right?\n\n**O5-7:** I'm calling your bluff, Bowe. You've worked hard enough to take Site-19; you're not crazy enough to blow it all up.\n\n**Bowe:** On the contrary, I'd just become a martyr. Every man here came here with the expectation to die. You think we'd bring our entire army in one incursion? My death will serve as an inspiration to the anomalous community. I'd start a revolution to bring about my goals; that's greater than any army.\n\n//<Silence.>//\n\n**O5-1:** Gentlemen, we have to discuss this. \n\n**Bowe:** You have five minutes before I release another anomaly.\n\n//<Bowe and his associates are removed from the meeting.>//\n\n**O5-7:** I still think he's bullshitting us. \"Martyr\" my ass. I knew him personally; he's as much of an egomaniac as he is a coward.\n\n**Dir. Gerald:** As the guy dealing with the 953 breach, I don't think he's bullshitting.\n\n**O5-2:** We need to give him //something.// He's genuinely insane; it's not like he won't do it.\n\n**O5-11:** We're not giving him Site-19. We might as well just hand over the keys to the entire Foundation.\n\n**O5-9:** I have an idea, if you want to hear it.\n\n**O5-12:** Go for it.\n\n**O5-9:** We give him Site-19. He's pretty entrenched there, anyways. It would take months to get him out of there. But then we build a big wall around Site-19. We prevent anyone from leaving, and cut off Bowe's access to the outside world. We can make sure his influence never goes beyond the site.\n\n**O5-12:** That's the worst idea I've ever heard.\n\n**O5-1:** I'm for it. We can figure out a more permanent solution later. \n\n**O5-4:** Let's vote.\n\n//<The Overseer Council vote commences. O5-9's proposal wins with an 7-4-2 majority.>//\n\n//<Bowe and associates are added back to the video conference.>//\n\n**Bowe:** Well?\n\n**O5-1:** We will acquiesce to your demands, Bowe. Congratulations on acquiring Site-19.\n\n//<End Log>//\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"announcement-box\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ FOUNDATION GLOBAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nDue to circumstances outside of our control, the leadership structure of Secure Site-19 has undergone change.
