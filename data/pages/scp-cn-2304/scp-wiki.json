The site is to maintain sufficient personnel on hand to perform SCP-CN-2304 between 00:00 and 04:00 local time every day. In order to mitigate the damage caused by repeated execution of SCP-CN-2304 by personnel, it is recommended that each site rotate personnel according to the situation. \n\nIf the normal rising of SCP-CN-2304-1 is not observed following the execution of SCP-CN-2304, the site must immediately inform the Overseer Council and all sites are to be on guard for a possible veil disruption scenario emergency.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-2304 is an anomalous ritual, developed and confirmed to be effective by the applied theology department of Site-CN-44 of the Foundation's Chinese branch. The complete steps required to perform SCP-CN-2304 are: \n\n# No less than 33 people are to gather around an empty area, with no more than 1.5m between each person and the nearest other person.\n# Each person is to hold 2 g of pure gold in their mouth and kneel down facing east.\n# Each person uses a sharp implement made of solid gold to make a wound and draw blood (it is recommended to cut a fingertip) and draw Symbol-2304 with the resulting blood at a suitable distance in front of them.\n# Each person holds their forehead to the drawn ritual pattern and holds the position for 30 minutes. The ceremony is then to be declared complete.\n\nSCP-CN-2304-1 is the sun following 23/04/2021. Without intervention, the natural rising of SCP-CN-2304-1 from the east cannot be detected from any location on Earth, and the presence of SCP-CN-2304-1 cannot be sensed from any location in the Earth's atmosphere. As of now, the daily use of SCP-CN-2304 is the only way to prevent the above-mentioned anomaly.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-CN-2303]]] | SCP-CN-2304 | [[[SCP-CN-2305]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
