All access applications from employees with any history of drug addiction are to be automatically denied.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7750 is a collection of 70 dried flowers originating from an unknown species from the genus //Myosotis//. Each flower had detached from the stem via bisection of the pedicel.\n\nEach instance of SCP-7750 induces a strong amnestic effect upon ingestion, replacing a chronological year of memory with the memory of walking through a seemingly endless field of //Myosotis// flowers. SCP-7750 is furthermore impervious to most forms of damage despite its extremely desiccated state.\n\n**Addendum 7750.1 Test Log:**\n\n[[table style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nDATE\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nDATA\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nEFFECTS\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nNOTES\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n09/11/2022\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[=]]\nOne (1) flower ingested by D-5798, age 35.\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nYear 1998 was forgotten by the subject.

We had suffered a minor security breach, and however minor it might be, it will forever tarnish our good name. We had today lost 10 instances of SCP-7750, due to the specialization of our site in biohazardous and amnestic substances, I'm certain many of you are realizing the potential gravity of our situation and the threat even a minor breach might pose.

Why did you cause this breach, hasn't your wife died in one? And after so many years after you've been cleared by psychological staff for lingering trauma...\"\n\n**Quincy:** \"I- I didn't get over anything! I started to take amnestics because I wanted to forget it.

Why any of this?\"\n\n**Quincy:** \"They, they didn't help, they-\" //Researcher Quincy stops for a moment.// \"They didn't take it away, and all I wanted was just for it to stop, just to stop thinking how she must have felt, how she died.\"\n\n**Allaine:** \"I can't say I understand, but I do empathize.

I stood by it-\" //Researcher Quincy suddenly grasps his head and cries out in pain, all previous SCP-7750 test subjects do the same.//\n \n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** SCP-7750 effect was found to start progressing on its own within the test subjects, which also resulted in highly-painful migraines. After a wide variety of anti-pain medication and treatment options were explored, the only thing that was found to ease the subject's condition was further ingestion of SCP-7750 instances.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 12/12/2022\n\n**NOTE:** Despite attempts to limit the use of SCP-7750 as pain relief for affected test subjects, amount of SCP-7750 instances dwindled steadily. The following footage was captured by security camera 24 hours after consumption of the last SCP-7750 instance.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**02:20 A.M:** \n//Despite the self-reported intense pain, most SCP-7750 test subjects are asleep. With the exception of D-5732 and Researcher Quincy. D-5732 is laying on his stomach and has his head covered by a pillow, a position which the subject claimed helped with the pain. Researcher Quincy is curled up and sobbing.// \n\n//Sudden rise in activity is registered, all subjects previously asleep wake-up. D-5798 attempts to stand up but collapses on the floor. After a few minutes of confusion, all subjects begin to convulse in pain. Unexplained bulges are visible under their skin.//\n\n**02:44 A.M:** \n//The easily heard commotion within the infirmary attracts the attention of night-shift staff located throughout Site-50. The first to make it onto the scene is Technician Graves.//\n\n//Technician Graves stares in disbelief as the subjects continue convulsing, which allows for several medics to pass by him and attempt to help the subjects. Researcher Quincy begins screaming.//\n\nResearcher Quincy: \"I was there! With it at the edge of the pit! It called me a seed and planted me there! It gave me a spade to bury myself!\"\n\n//Researcher Quincy is joined in screaming by most other subjects.//\n\n**03:12 A.M:**\n//A green stalk bursts through D-5732's back, and begins to rapidly expand towards the center of the room, said stalk is followed by several more which burst from various points of D-5732's body, from underneath D-5732 a similarly quickly expanding mass of roots can be seen.//\n\n//After a few seconds, similar stems and roots burst from the bodies of other subjects, and the mass of stems begins entangling on itself in the center of the room. At this point, medics stop any attempts at rendering help but continue monitoring the subject's vitals. Most subjects by this point stopped screaming, having torn their vocal cords to shreds.//\n\n**03:20 A.M:**\n//Technician Graves rushes towards Researcher Quincy, whose body is mostly covered up by plant matter by this point.//\n\nTechnician Graves: \"Oh God, oh God, what have I done.\"\n\n//Technician Graves attempts to unsuccessfully remove the plant matter from Researcher Quincy's body, Researcher Quincy does not appear to notice said action. At this point Senior Researcher Allaine enters the infirmary, having been recently woken up, and walks over to Technician Graves.//\n\nSenior Researcher Allaine: \"Don't, there's no saving anyone after something like this\"\n\n//Technician Graves turns towards Senior Researcher Allaine and collapses to his knees.//\n\nTechnician Graves: \"This, this was my fault, this has been all my fault.\"\n\n**03:25 A.M:**\n//The plant mass in the middle of the room stops growing and begins to sprout flowers characteristic of those from the Myosotis genus. Researcher Quincy turns his head, as much as the plant mass wrapping around it allows, towards Senior Researcher Allaine.//\n\nResearcher Quincy: \"I- I finally understand.\"\n\n//All subject's vital signs begin deteriorating, the plant mass begins to rapidly dry out.//\n\nResearcher Quincy: \"I didn't want to forget her. I just wanted to remember her without the pain.\"\n\n//All subjects expire, and approximately 70 SCP-7750 instances detach from the entangled stalks.//\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7749]]] | SCP-7750 | [[[SCP-7751]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=SecondTimeline]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
