Mobile Task Force Beta-7 (aka \"Maz Hatters\") are to be tasked with cleanup operations and onsite security.  --SCP-1393 is to be buried with an adequate amount of earth as to neutralize its active effect.--  Material produced by SCP-1393 is to be handled as detailed in the standard protocols for extrinsic hazardous materials.  \n\nThe material will need to be mixed with moist clay earth at a ratio of 3:1 before being hauled away to be properly disposed of on site.  Disposal will consist of hauling the material to the NW corner of Site-97 and spread across the ground.  Once cooled, a 30cm layer of clay earth will be spread on top.  Future reclamation plans will consist of converting Site-97 into a shipping container storage yard once cleanup operations have completed.\n\nSamples of the material produced by SCP-1393 will need to be collected and sent to Research Site-45 for scheduled bi-weekly testing.  \n\n**Description:** SCP-1393 is a spherical portal measuring 1.8m in diameter and positioned 10cm above the ground.  SCP-1393 has remained active since Feb. 17^^th^^, 2013 (2 days after its initial sighting).  While active, SCP-1393 continually exudes a partially vitreous slag-like substance from its surface at rate of 12m^^3^^/hr.  This material's temperature has been measured to range between 1,500°C and 1,800°C.  Roughly 85% of this material is primarily composed of a combination of silica, quicklime, alumina, sodium borate, and magnesite.  Traces of mercury, uranium, phosphorous, sulfur, radium, and other toxic elements in varying amounts have also been detected.   \n\nBefore SCP-1393 entered its current active state, a humanoid being designated SCP-1393-1 was observed performing reconnaissance and surveying of the immediate area.  SCP-1393-1 was reported wearing a Level A/Type 1 Hazmat suit equipped with a polarized face shield and a SCBA unit.  The Foundation was contacted about the event and SCP-1393-1 was interviewed about its actions and purpose.  To date, SCP-1393-1 has not been seen since SCP-1393 activated.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[LEVEL-1 ACCESS REQUIRED]\" hide=\"[ACCESS GRANTED]\"]]\n> +++ Field Interview Transcript,,1393-12,,\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-1393-1\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Herman  Muntz\n>  \n> **Foreword:** Dr. Muntz, accompanied by 8 field agents, approach SCP-1393-1.
