I’m Merehrab[[footnote]]Pronounced Meh-ray-hrab, not meer-hrab. If I hear someone actually say the latter out loud, I will cringe so hard that I’ll pop a blood vessel.[[/footnote]] (he/him), and I have been reading articles on this wiki since 2020, and have been trying to write articles here since February 2022 (well, my first account that is. My current account is actually my second account, which was made in August of that year). I like Lord of the Rings, I like to read contemporary fantasy and science fiction novels, and I’m also a huge fan of the SCP wiki and all of its lore, which is obvious considering I’ve written stuff for it.\n\nThe stuff I like to write is mostly character-driven, kind of long, sometimes slice-of-life, and sometimes I like to write some emotional articles as well. But what I really like to write are the hopeful stories. Hope to me is not some delicate, ephemeral thing made of whispers and spider’s webs. Hope has been knocked to the ground several times, with dirt on her face and blood on her knuckles, and she spats out a tooth and rises to another go anyway. It’s like David and Goliath, with Goliath being the unstoppable evil that will take down anything in its path, and hope being just a little thing, who looks out for others and rises to the challenge no matter how great. It only takes a single match to start a fire. Those are the kind of stories I really like to write for the wiki.\n\nOf course, I also want to expand on what I want to write and do many things. I want to write for some canons that I really like, I want to write tales, I want to write articles that’ll scare people, I want to do many things. And I hope that I’ll get to check off all the things I want to do. \n\nIt’s been a lot of fun reading and writing for this wiki, and I am very grateful for all the support that I have received while being here. I’ve read many great articles written by fantastic authors, big and small, and I can’t wait to see what everyone cooks up next.\n\nBut first, a few words from some other authors.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Quotes From Some Cool Folks**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n//“Merehrab is the only SCP author I’m not afraid of for some reason or another — which means he’s either really nice or a coward, and I’m not interested in researching further.”// —[[*user ThatGuyThatTime]], who made Skibidi Toilet before it was cool.\n\n//\"Mere- Mer- Merehr- Fuck.\"// —[[*user AwhRyan]], who is struggling to spell my name, but a lot of people have the same struggles as well, because I made a username that’s hard to spell //and// hard to pronounce.

Now this one’s a fun one.\n\nI formed the idea of this one while in high school, and I was a big fan of D&D at the time[[footnote]]Still am now, but not as much as I used to be. I haven’t watched any D&D web series in a long time, and I still have never played the actual game myself[[/footnote]], and I used to watch Critical Role religiously. I just watched a lot of 3 hour vods of that series on YouTube every day. And at the time in high school while I was reading SCPs, I didn’t even know that there were actual people writing these things. And once I figured it out that there were actual authors, I knew then that I had to write one, just so I could. Because I always loved the SCP wiki and the stories that it tells, and actually writing an SCP would’ve been an accomplishment that I would always be proud of myself for. \n\nSo I formed an idea. It was dumb. It was basically “what if the Matthew Mercer from Critical Role that we knew was actually a demon the entire time?” Well, part of it was that. And I have the original idea right here for all to see. Here it is:\n\n**Elevator Pitch:** An online D&D game gone horribly wrong. It has cognitohazardous influence in its advertising, a demonic DM, and players who are forced to play the game for eternity. If their characters die, the players die as well.\n\n**Central Narrative:** Foundation webcrawlers discover an anomalous advertisement on Roll20.net, where the ad forces players into joining an online D&D game. Once they join the game, instead of getting an invite to join a discord server or other online service, the players get sent into a hell dimension, where they meet the DM, who is a demonic entity who calls itself Xornos. Xornos hates the current climate of D&D, and wants to improve on its DM skills by kidnapping players from lots of different dimensions and forcing them to play his homebrew campaign.\n\nThe Foundation then send D-Class to this dimension with hidden audio recorders in order to find out how the campaign works. The campaign is just your average campaign, except for the fact that if your characters die during the game, the players will die the same way as their characters. For example, if a character dies by getting stabbed multiple times by different weapons, the same exact weapons described by Xornos materialize in front of the player and move by themselves to maim and kill the player. The player’s remains then disappear. The players cannot escape, and they are forced to play for eternity. Once Xornos says that the campaign is officially finished, the players get sent back to their home realities, and a new campaign gets made.\n\nThe Foundation then try to infiltrate the dimension using many resources. These methods do not work, because the dimension is impenetrable. Xornos finds out about these methods, and then kidnaps many Foundation researchers to cease the Foundation from working on how to stop it. One of the kidnapped researchers, Dr. Prescott, convinces Xornos to stop what it’s doing and join Critical Role, to improve his DM skills without causing harm to anymore people. Xornos disguises itself as Matthew Mercer, and hosts Critical Role to this day. The real Matthew Mercer is given amnestics and is sent home, and is watched by the Foundation to prevent him finding out about Critical Role.\n\n**Hook/Attention Grabber:** D&D is a really popular role-playing game that is loved by many. By adding lots of twists and turns, horrific events, and good writing, this SCP could work.\n\nGood god. Yeah, a lot of this idea had to be reworked, and thank god I got all those people from idea crit on the forums to help me rework this, but some other parts of this made it to the final cut. Ultimately, the idea turned into a story about a Demonic DM who tries hard to be a successful DM, but due to obvious differences between himself and the players, his rules are draconian and painful, and the campaign gets heated to the point of no return. But things will get better for Xornos, in time. He just has to learn from his mistakes, albeit very slowly.\n\nWhen I was writing this, it took me months to get my SCP greenlighted. It took me even longer to find someone to look at the draft. And I got only one person to look at it. I tried to get more people to critique my work, but it just wouldn’t happen. I got frustrated at myself, and I was extremely anxious about posting the SCP to the site regardless of how many people looked at it anyway, so I just quit. I deleted my account and left the site in June. Because my self-doubt got to the point where I didn’t think I would ever be able to post anything at all on the wiki. I didn’t think I was a good enough writer. \n\nBut then in August, I decided to come back. Because after my little break I still wanted to post an SCP, and after rethinking things a whole bunch, I still thought that my D&D SCP would still be able to survive. So I made another account, got my idea greenlighted again (even though I didn’t really have to), somehow got another person to look at the draft (thank you [[*user DrRevan]]), and then I just said “fuck it” and posted it on the 7550 slot, right in the middle of Anthology 2022. And it survived! I was so happy that it did. \n\nThe next few months it slowly started to gain upvotes, until the person who originally looked at the rough draft (thank you [[*user Fireknight]]) put it on the Reviewer’s Spotlight in December. I was literally on the front page! And then after several more months, I got to the milestone of 50 upvotes. I thought I would never actually get to that point until then. And it happened because of all the support I had from the community, and I could not thank you guys enough for this. I’m still super glad that I managed to make a mark on this wiki, and made so many people’s days just a little brighter than before. \n\nAs for the actual SCP, I still enjoy reading it from time to time, but there are some parts that are still a little unpolished to me (especially the beginning, I’m still eh about the beginning). Also, this SCP has been described as “cheesy” by someone once, which after some reflection I completely agree. If you don’t like excessive amounts of cheese in your story, this SCP might not be for you. But I don’t hate this SCP, and I still like it a lot when rereading it, regardless of all its flaws. \n\nAlso, another cool thing is that Darnell and Tanhony read this SCP for their extremely good podcast, which I still can’t believe even happened. You can click the link to that episode [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=35FDkjHI2Aw&t=233s here]. \n\nI’m still super proud of how much success this SCP has gotten. It means a lot to see this little SCP of mine keep on reaching new heights.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-7467]]] - The Green and The Mighty\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nThis one was made for GoblinCon, but I missed the deadline so it wasn’t an actual entry for the contest. And it was also a coldpost, because of procrastination issues that I had to deal with in 2023, which hopefully will become more manageable to deal with in the future. At least it survived.\n\nI expected this to slowly get downvoted for the next two weeks after posting, because that’s what happened to my unsuccessful SCPs that I had to quickly self-delete, because I had a problem of procrastinating on everything and doubting myself to the point of whether I was going to ever be as successful as other writers on the wiki, or if I was ever going to be a good writer at all. But this SCP somehow survived against all odds, which I was very thankful for at the time. The funny thing is that my first three SCPs were posted because I said “fuck it, we ball” and just decided to take a leap of faith, even though I was always uncertain if these SCPs would even survive. But they did.\n\nThe idea for this one came to me when I remembered the idea of a “goblin mode”, which is when someone would behave in a unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, or messy way, and typically in a way that rejects societal norms or expectations. So basically, like a goblin. I was thinking of a way that I could use this idea for an SCP, and then out of the blue I was just like “what if I put this in a gun?”\n\nThat’s what 7467 is. It’s a weapon with three separate cartridges that have three different sets of ammunition that have three different anomalous functions. The first one changes the personality of the target to personalities that are primarily associated with the concept of a “goblin”, the second one is basically reality bending that just atomically disintegrates you, and the third one is literally just applying the Butterfly Effect in the most fatal ways possible. If you get hit by 7467 when it’s in its third function, and you make any kind of decision, there will be catastrophic consequences that will come immediately after, often resulting in your death. \n\nAfter I got the weapon down, I asked myself what kind of story I wanted to make out of this. And so I thought “why not racism against goblins?”\n\nI don’t know how I came up with that either, but I did. And it turned out to be a decent SCP. I did enough research to make this work, and it turned out to not be a disaster, so I gave myself a pat on the back for that.\n\nWhen rereading this one, I still think it’s a decent read, and there’s certainly many less rough parts than 7550, but it’s not much of a favorite of mine like the rest. Maybe you’ll enjoy it more than I do. Still, while GoblinCon was a stressful experience, it was still a lot of fun to do. Maybe I can have better luck for future contests.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-7163]]] - I Will Be Here Whenever You Need Me The Most\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nI really like this one.\n\nThis one was my Art Exchange gift for [[*user HarryBlank]], and I absolutely had a blast writing this. Before AE, I was in a writing slump. I had a lot more negative thoughts about myself again, but I knew I always wanted to participate in an Art Exchange, and the fact that I was able to participate in one, my giftee absolutely adored my gift, and the gift then became my third successful SCP made those worries and doubts go away in an instant. I am so proud of this one, and let me tell you how I made it.\n\nSo this one started with me thinking of writing an SCP about Udo Okorie, one of my favorite characters from the On Guard 43 canon. Originally, the SCP was going to be an Alagaddan mask, and Udo was going to do research to learn more about the revelation that she had about herself while in Corbenic during the events of [[[SCP-6500]]]. The mask was going to know information about what Udo was looking for, but it’s also very mischievous and wouldn’t tell her anything while also throwing insults at her. \n\nI eventually realized that Harry probably already had plans about that revelation that Udo had, and I would most likely be stepping on his toes with that idea, so I scrapped it.\n\nI then began to start looking for some images about sand sculptures, because Udo is a thaumaturgist who specializes in sand, and I thought it would be good to find an SCP that would be aligned with her specialty in sand. I eventually found an image of the silliest looking frog sculpture, which I decided to keep and use for my SCP.\n\nI reworked my original idea to basically focus on all the important things that happened to Udo, and how she’s dealing with those behind the scenes. Basically an overview of all the tragedies and revelations about herself that she experienced, and how she’s dealing with all that. So I changed my SCP into becoming a pseudo-therapist that telepathically gives advice to personnel at Site-43 who are dealing with personal issues that are affecting them mentally. The catch is that it only does this once a year, and the Foundation never knows when it returns to give advice to the next person, since it’s all random.\n\nNow that I had the foundations of what I wanted to do, I needed the final cherry on top to make this work. And so I randomly googled what kind of symbolism a frog has one day, and I found out that in terms of symbolism, the frog stands for growth, transformation, fertility, potential, prosperity, and harmony.\n\nYou know another character who’s associated with harmony on the wiki? Pangloss.\n\nI had it. I had what I needed to make my SCP. And the best part is that I always wanted to write something about Pangloss for the wiki. Pangloss is a character that I’m extremely fascinated by, and when I found out a way to put him in for this SCP, I immediately took that chance.\n\nI am also planning to write more stuff about him, so expect more Pangloss articles in the future. Maybe.\n\nI also decided to add Dr. Ngo and Ibanez in the SCP as well, because my plot literally required them to be there, so I added them in there and called it a day.  I was also trying to figure out how to justify the interview logs, since the SCP spoke telepathically to personnel, which makes everyone else not able to hear it, then I remembered that [[[SCP-2922]]] exists, which led me to add a reference to that SCP that also made sense for the story and how the Foundation was able to transcribe the conversation between the SCP and Udo.\n\nWhile writing this, I had to reread thousands upon thousands of words just to get the characters and the timeline right. I’m a continuity nut, so if I see even the tiniest misstep in a story’s timeline, I will go absolutely ballistic. That’s why I forced myself to read all of Harry’s words just to make my SCP work with the timeline that’s been already set in OG43. And ultimately it worked out perfectly, so I’m glad it did.\n\nI think my dialogue for this one is significantly better than the previous two, which is great, because I always had a dialogue problem, and whenever I write dialogue that I thought was natural, I then would show it to other people and they say it’s not natural in the slightest. Luckily I am slowly beginning to improve on my dialogue. There’s a learning curve when it comes to writing dialogue, and I was on the slower side when I went up that curve, and still am now, but at least I’m improving! \n\nUltimately, I had a lot of fun writing for this, and I am so glad that it succeeded. I would like to thank Harry once again for writing an absolutely fantastic canon that I still read to this day, and for inspiring me to help make my SCP writing dream a reality.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-8035]]] - I Have Seen What The Darkness Does\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nI’ve got a lot to say about this one.\n\nThis article was a damn rollercoaster and a half when it came to writing for it, because during the 8000 contest I was scrambling for critters and praying to every god that existed that the article would do well. It’s so funny that I come up with these great ideas in my head, but when it’s time to actually write the finished product my articles always end up not exactly as I want them to be. \n\nI think what ultimately killed the article during the contest was the fact that my writing process was very unrefined, to say the least. I never do outlines for my articles (except for tales, which I’m doing for my first tale as I’m writing this), I never get enough crit before posting my articles, and I never had the chance to actually sit down and examine what I was writing, due to the fact that I only had the motivation to write during contests, where you don’t have a lot of time to get crit and edit your article. Needless to say I got absolutely whacked during the 8k contest. I know everyone else was also stressed about the contest, but I was especially stressed out because that was my first ever kcon, and I didn’t want to disappoint everyone.\n\nUltimately I wanted to get at least top 30, but ended up in 81st-82nd place. Oh well, what’s done is done.\n\nBut eventually I decided to rewrite my article, and I’m not disappointed like I was last time. I fixed a lot of pacing issues and got rid of //a lot// of awkward dialogue. It might get slept on, but hey I’ll call this a win anyway.\n\nNow let’s get to the part where I came up with this article.\n\nI came up with the idea of the forest many months before the 8k theme was announced. I was inspired by stuff like SCP-4000 and Sloth’s Pit, so I created a forest made up of nightmares and fear. The forest takes the fear of whoever enters it and manifests these fears in reality. This can include any type of fear, including childhood fears. For example, if you were scared of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park as a kid, those dinosaurs will show up in the forest to hunt you down (here’s a secret I’ll tell you: I’m making a sequel tale to this in the future, and the main threats will be dinosaurs that’ll show up just like I described, especially the Carnotaurus. I hope I can actually start to work on that tale in the future).\n\nI think I changed a lot of the mechanisms of the forest after the kcon theme got announced, because I didn’t just want my characters to fuck around in the forest for the entire article, I needed to incorporate important themes in it. I thought since this was a kcon, I needed to bring something extra special to the mix.\n\nThen I decided to bring in my personal fight against ableism. \n\nIf y’all didn’t know already, I have social communication disorder. I dealt with a lot of bullshit over the years. People treating me like a child, people calling me stupid, and in general people weren’t patient with me at all and just told me to “start thinking through things” instead of respecting my needs and trying to give a shit about me. I’ve also seen several stories that are similar to mine, a lot of them even worse than what happened to me. Sometimes I feel guilty because I got “lucky” and I only got berated infrequently. I had to write something to address all the horrible stuff that I’ve seen.\n\nBut then I discovered that since the forest I created was based off of perceptions and those perceptions becoming a reality, I then formed a connection between these experiences and that idea. I had my message that I could tell to others like me, that they aren’t alone, that they are not a burden, that they are just as human as the people around them.\n\nAnd so I went to work. \n\nI think one problem I had while writing the article was that I only cared about the overall message and story in the article, and not the characters who are equally as important. I got carried away and kept adding and adding more ideas to the pile. This eventually culminated in the article having 17,000 words and being a fucking slog.\n\nHaving such an unrefined article and not getting enough people to say “hey, maybe you should rework this” is a guaranteed way to kill that article. Thankfully, I posted my rewrite, and it’s not complete dogshit.\n\nThere were also a few ideas that did not make it to the final draft of the original article. There was one character who was cut out entirely, and that one was a cyclops who only spoke in rhyme, and who was the personal bodyguard of the Mother. I had too much stuff in the article to begin with, so I regrettably took him out. I don’t 100% regret that I took the character out, though, because he will show up in the tale. When I get to writing it.\n\nOverall, yeah this was a fucking //journey// lmao. I learned a lot from this, and going forward I’ll take things more slowly when writing and I’ll get at least 5-6 people for crit.\n\nI don’t want to jinx myself again, but let’s see if the next contest I join will turn out better for me.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-6461]]] - The Cave\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nWoot woot, I got a Series 7 slot!! Let’s go!\n\nThe initial idea behind this is I think one of the oldest ideas I’ve ever come up with. It’s been such a long time since I initially formed it, I don’t think I can even give y’all the exact date. I’m very grateful that this idea has finally got to be in the mainlist, it’s been so long and it absolutely deserves it.\n\nNow initially I came up with the character of Madeline to basically just be a “contained anomaly that eventually gets some freedom as a site director.” Now at first it was very hard to figure out //how exactly// Madeline could become a director, because normally the Foundation would not let that happen under any circumstances. But eventually I figured “if it can happen, it can happen.” So I just pulled shit out of my ass and threw it at the wall until something started to stick. And that’s why everything else about the story is the way it is.\n\nThe backstory for Madeline and the character of Vandendriessche were initially going to be part of a tale (which will still happen when I get to writing it, as that tale will elaborate on the relationship between the two characters and explore the incident at the cave in detail), but then I decided to use her backstory as an anchor for the rest of the story to happen. So it all worked out.\n\nVandendriessche’s backstory was taken from [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/01/484083305/for-centuries-a-small-town-has-embraced-strangers-with-mental-illness here]. According to the article, Geel taking boarders in to take care of them is in fact a real thing, which I think is really cool (shoutout to the town of Geel). I used this article to create the character of Vandendriessche and it was also partially behind the creation of the themes of this story.\n\nBut also, god I loved creating the character of Madeline and I hope to write her more often in the future. She’s empathetic toward her subordinates and the anomalies under her watch, she loves insects and how they interact with the world, she’s frighteningly competent and calculating, and she will do anything to make the world a better place for anomalies that are cast away from society and the world. I love her so much (platonically), she’s honestly one of the best characters that I’ve ever created. \n\nI hope she gets the love that she deserves.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-8926]]] - It All Started With A Rabbit\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nSo this was made during the Public Domain Contest, and I first came up with the initial concept along with my friends ThatGuyThatTime and winkwonkboi. While we were looking for what public domain character to use, I did a Google search of different public domain characters and one of the suggestions was Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. I then remembered Oswald’s story of his rights getting taken away to Universal and then never getting used again for decades, until Disney reacquired the rights in 2006. I remember his impact during the early days of animation along with the other greats that popped up during that era, and how he continues to be an absolute icon even today. He still isn’t used that often, but I wanted to tell his story and send a love letter to him and how much I appreciate him as a character.\n\nSo initially I went with something akin to Bendy and the Ink Machine, of a cartoon character coming to life and then being trapped in an abandoned studio for decades. I couldn’t figure out what his origin should be at first, but then I thought, why not make it so that he was made by a literal wish upon a star? In retrospect it was kind of a silly decision to make his origin go like that, but it all turned out alright in the end. \n\nOverall, the story’s themes then naturally became ones of being forgotten, of the fears that creators have of becoming irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, and being left behind by the world and how one could still live in spite of it all. In order to do this, I had to make Oswald have a bunch of self-image issues.\n\nOswald the character is supposed to have a bit of an ego, he’s described by a Disney historian as “Mickey if he were a little more egotistical or fallible, or imagine Bugs Bunny if he talked the talk but wasn't as good at walking the walk.” This also led me to separate Oswald the living entity and Oswald the cartoon character in the story, and have that be another insecurity for Oswald that he has to overcome. Now one could make the argument that this is a change too far for the character of Oswald, but I say it works for this story as he learns to become who he wants to be.\n\nNow the backstory that Oswald tells to Director Webb in the story is in fact the real events that led to the rights of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit being acquired by Universal. There really was an overbearing producer (his name was Charles Mintz) that hired away Walt’s own workers and tried to force him to take a smaller cut than a raise like he wanted, and Walt did refuse that order and lost most of his staff and the rights to Oswald as a result. I thought if I made things more historically accurate to Oswald’s story, then it would make his plight even more emotionally effective. And according to my reviewers, I was right and everything worked out.\n\nAs for Director Webb’s inclusion in the story, I wanted a character that could relate to Oswald’s plight, and someone who was also there to see the original cartoons so that they can prove Oswald’s perceived inferiority to be wrong. And fortunately for me, there was one character that I could use, and I think that Madeline’s inclusion was a great decision by me for the story, however I do agree with the criticism that I could’ve done her reveal near the end with the crosslink better.\n\nWe were going to continue Oswald’s story after this, however the irl obligations curse had taken hold of my teammates and we couldn’t get the full story done by the time that the posting period for the contest ended. To make sure that our ideas aren’t lost, I will recount what we originally planned for to the best of my ability.\n\nFirst, we had random throwaway thoughts and ideas that we pitched around until we had more concrete thoughts about our larger story. The only one I remember was that we pitched using Grendel from Beowulf as an antagonist, because he hates singing and Oswald likes to sing and play on his banjo. That idea did not fit our overall story in the end, but I think it can work if we went in a different direction for our storyline.\n\nNow let’s go on to the more concrete ideas. ThatGuy was going to focus on the Walt Disney Company itself and explain why Oswald was abandoned, and he also was going to work on an SCP that was about 5 different pens that had different abilities involving creativity and combined together would have the ability to create living ink people just like Oswald. I think his storyline was about the inevitability of greed and the stifling of creativity in companies like Disney, and what happens when the majority of creative works is owned by a monopoly. When creativity falls into the wrong hands, well things aren’t going to go very well.\n\nMeanwhile, Wink was going to explore Oswald’s time while living in the workshop all alone, and vivid dreams that he had about him and his place in the world. Knowing Wink, it would’ve been a very emotional roller coaster as we would see Oswald’s inner thoughts about himself and how he feels about being abandoned while wasting away in the workshop. I was very excited to see what he would come up with, but I know that shit happens and we’ll take what we can get.\n\nAs for me, besides 8926 I was going to explore how Oswald felt about the modern world that he found himself in after he escaped from the workshop, which I have already finished and posted to the wiki in the form of a tale. I also wanted to elaborate on the other ink people that Oswald met, but I didn’t have enough time to get started on that. It was going to be a nexus format about that community, and I was going to call it Toontown, which is named after the area in Disneyland. But I didn’t have enough time to work on it before the contest ended. But hey, who knows, I might actually come back to that idea in the future. We’ll see.\n\nIn the end, while we as a team didn’t get to qualify in the rankings and we didn’t get to finish our main storyline like we wanted to, I’m still proud of my teammates and myself for what we’ve accomplished. I hope I get to write more about Oswald in the future, and he gets the attention that he deserves.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\n\n[[[Turning Out]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nYep, this is my first tale. I’m quite proud of it.\n\nI haven’t done any of this kind of prose since middle school, where I wrote a short story about Luigi time traveling to save his brother Mario (yeah, it was a little silly). I did do some prose for school assignments, but the only one I can remember was me doing an autobiographical thing for a writing project. It was about my persistent procrastination. I remember writing about how I was going to prevent myself from procrastinating too much; that part didn’t particularly age too well. Hah.\n\nTangent aside, this was me writing my first piece of fiction in a long time, so I really wanted to get it right. All I had was what I learned from reading tales for the past 4 years, although what can really help your prose is to read actual novels, which I haven’t done yet. Once I get my hands on some books, hopefully my prose can improve.\n\nFor Pridefest, I wanted to write about my experience with being asexual and aromantic, and the struggles that come with being aroace. I actually had this idea for a long time, and I originally planned to release the tale during Valentine’s Day, as an ironic jab at the holiday. I don’t really like Valentine’s Day, for obvious reasons. At least I get discounted chocolate, that’s nice!\n\nBut yeah, being asexual, aromantic, or both can be a pain sometimes when you’re living in a sex and romance-obsessed society, which is what I wanted to capture in the tale. I think I’ve done that successfully, as it's gotten a decent reception and some extremely nice comments. At first it was stuck at +5 for almost a whole day, which kind of got to me a bit, before I realized that:\n\n* Tales don’t get much reads\n\n* I don’t get that many reads the first few days\n\nSo looking back, I kind of feel dumb for being disappointed. It’s at +15 at time of writing, so I’ll call that a success for my first tale.\n\nFor this tale, when I went into the crit process it was a little different than what I normally go through. Normally I get crit from one person, I edit the article to address that crit, then I move on to ask another person for crit. But this time I was approached by two different people, and both did their crit for my tale at around the same time, which kind of overwhelmed me. I was also on vacation at Cedar Point at the time, so I couldn’t address their crit for at least four days. And before I came back, another person asked if they could look at it, even though I wasn’t even done editing it. But ultimately I pushed through and ironed out my tale enough to post it on time, although I did miss most of the month. Typical Merehrab luck. \n\nI do want to thank my critters though, they were tremendously helpful with fixing the problems that this piece had, especially Lapis and how she pointed out all the “she did x” sentences and the weird punctuation with dialogue tags. The dialogue tags were the biggest pain in my ass while I was writing this tale, because I didn’t want “said” or asked” to be thrown around all the time, but I also didn’t know where I should add physical descriptions or if I needed some dialogue tags at all. Luckily Lapis showed me what to do with those, which I am incredibly grateful for. \n\nOverall, this was an interesting experience, and I’m glad that this tale is resonating with so many people. I am very proud of my aspec friends, and we belong in the LGBTQ community. \n\nAlso, definitely check out the fanart I got from this tale [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:a-shining-moon-s-observatory here, on the July 2024 tab]. It’s genuinely amazing, like my heart was in tatters after seeing it, I love it so much. Please check out ashiningmoon’s artworks, they are a wonderful artist, and they deserve all the attention that they receive.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[Blackbird]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nThis one’s got an interesting story behind it.\n\nIt started when I wrote 7550. I needed to create a somewhat generic researcher with an affinity for helping people, so I came up with the name ‘Michael Prescott’ and shoved him into the story, trying to solve how the Foundation could possibly contain 7550-C. I thought he was a one-off. I wanted him to be a one-off.\n\nBut fate had different plans for him.\n\nI started to reference him in my other works, and then to full on appearances. He transformed into a therapist for anomalies and personnel alike, always looking for ways to help others, even in a world that hated the anomalies for who they were. I started to develop him more and more, eventually reaching to a point where he was my most developed character out of all of the ones I came up with. And I also started to do something else.\n\nI started to put more and more of myself into him. It was just the little things at first, like his appearance, but soon it became clear that a lot of things about him were taken directly from me, the author. Things were starting to turn into self-insert territory. So I needed to think of something to address this development.\n\nI decided to embrace it.\n\nThis tale is so far the most personal thing I’ve ever written for the wiki. A lot of events from my life that I personally experienced were written in this tale. Sharing Pokémon cards when I was a kid, sleep problems I had in the past, some of the harassment depicted in the story, all were real things that happened to me. Of course, I couldn’t make everything real, as some things I made up for the story, for example the mother character having an acoustic guitar and singing her favorite song. My mom never had a guitar, and I don’t think her favorite Beatles song was Blackbird.\n\nNone of the characters beside Michael were based on real people. I think you can tell how dumb that would be. I remember reading about one author who based her antagonistic characters off of real people from her life, and then they found out and were rightfully pissed off about it. Especially the fact that she was doing it without their knowledge or consent, yeah it’s just not a great idea in general. \n\nThis tale isn’t self-insert wish-fulfillment. It’s not me venting out to the world to get sympathy from people. Because we SCP authors write about our problems instead of seeing a therapist like the losers we are, am I right? Yeah, no.\n\nI just wanted to write about myself, in a reflective sense. It’s a self-reflection. That’s it.\n\nBut this also wasn’t just written for me. It was written so that people who may have had similar experiences don’t have to feel alone.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated with how people continue to push boundaries on what type of articles can work for the wiki, especially regarding autobiographical and personal articles. And I think these kinds of articles have their place on the wiki, for a number of reasons, but especially for how meaningful they can be to others. It can make them feel seen and heard, validating their experiences and who they are. The fact that I can reach out to someone across the world who I don’t even know about and make them resonate with these feelings and make them feel like they matter with just words on a page, it makes me happy. It makes me very happy.\n\nSo that’s pretty much it. I wrote a 16k word story about myself. \n\nI knew the risks of writing this before I posted it, but it looks like it survived as I’m writing this. It’s above +10 currently, which isn’t completely terrible for a tale. I wanted this to be higher than my last one, but I’ll take what I can get, and I’m still grateful that this even survived in the first place. \n\nRemember: you are never alone. There will always be someone out there who will care for you and appreciate you for who you are, no matter what. I hope that you find peace and stability in your life in the near future. Stay strong. Stay alive. 💚\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[Infatuation in Black]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nThe idea behind this was conceived a few days before the signups for Art Exchange happened. That was when I first stumbled upon N.I.B. by Black Sabbath. I’ve liked a few of their songs before, but I never became a superfan of them until I first listened to this song. And god do I love that song. The bass solo at the beginning, the heavy guitar riffs, Ozzy’s voice, it’s all just so goddamn good and I still love listening to it to this day. But the reason that I was inspired to write this tale was because of the lyrics.\n\nSince I’m aroace, I don’t particularly care for love songs. There’s far too many of them, and to me most of them are vapid and shallow. The only way that you can make me like a love song is if it has great storytelling and/or lyricism to stand out from all the rest. And boy does that song stand out. It really wowed me with its lyrics, and the bait-and-switch of Satan being the actual subject of the song completely got me. It gave me a ton of inspiration for me to write something similar for the wiki, but I had no idea how to fit everything together. I needed an inescapable situation for the main character to have to choose between Satan or the placeholder bad fate set out for them, but I couldn’t think of anything that would work.\n\nThat was when I saw Queerious’s prompts on the signups page for AE, and remembered the existence of the absence entity, which is basically an entity that makes everyone forget about you and slowly erases you from existence. I know, it’s crazy.\n\nSo, out of the blue, this turned into a story about romance (can’t believe I even pulled that off), marginalization, trying to survive in a world that wants to forget about you, and still living in spite of that because of the people who care about you. I’m really glad that Queerious enjoyed it, and I’m frankly surprised that this even happened in the first place. It was like all the pieces were perfectly aligned together for this story to exist. It’s crazy how unplanned and spontaneous some of my articles are, but as long as they work, it all works out in my mind. I’m grateful to have written something for Forgotten Memories, as I really like that canon and all the wonderful stories that exist within it. \n\nI’m also excited to see Amber and Lucy’s future on the wiki, wherever that may lead!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[You Can’t Kill The Idea of Me]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author Commentary\" hide=\"Collapse\"]]\n\nThis was my second entry for the Public Domain Contest. For this one, I wanted to write poetry so that I could really get into the thoughts of Oswald and how he sees himself and the world around him, and so I could express those feelings in ways that really resonate with readers. That’s the power of poetry, it excels at expressing complex emotions and feelings in a concise and impactful way.\n\nMy biggest inspiration is from the work of Hanif Abdurraqib. That man is an amazing poet, I admire his vivid imagery, the intricate metaphors and the powerful themes that he does in each of his poems. I wish I can be nearly as good as he is with my style. The profound way that he uses his words is so inspiring to me as a writer and as a novice poet. Fun fact, Hanif is from the same state that I’m from, Ohio! I think that’s pretty cool.\n\nThrough Oswald, I wanted to channel some recent feelings that I’ve been having about the world around me. Particularly the feeling of hopelessness, and feeling powerless as nothing you do matters while the world crumbles. But, like what Oswald learns, we can make things matter. Whether in our communities as we aid each other or in our friend groups, our actions can impact lives in so many positive ways. Our voices still matter. We should use them as much as we can, to help whoever we can as much as possible.\n\nAnd even if AI muddles things or corporations try to push against art and make pacifying near-commercials instead, art will live. The act of artistic expression has always been here, and it is never going away. There will always be something to fight back. Art will live, no matter what.\n\nI’ve been seeing that my teammates have been frustrated and disappointed in themselves because we weren’t able to qualify and they didn’t have enough time to get their articles finished. It can be frustrating to see that you’ll never be able to accomplish what you set out to do. I understand that feeling completely, as someone who has done poorly in previous contests. But I could never be disappointed in my teammates, because they’ve always been my friends and I’ve always been appreciative of the support that they give me to this day. Our brainstorming sessions during the first few days were also some of the most fun I’ve had on the wiki in a long time, and I’m incredibly grateful of both of them for being the absolute best.\n\nWhat matters the most for these contests is not how your team places on the rankings, it’s the newly forged (or already-established and now strengthened) bonds that you have between your teammates that were made because of this contest. What matters the most is the collaboration and the kinship between you and your teammates. That’s what kept you going, that’s what sparked your motivation to write. It was your teammates. And I will always appreciate my teammates for their continued support of me and my works.\n\nWe might not have qualified as a team in the end, but I’m still proud of us as a team, and I always will be.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab GOI Formats]]\n\nAlright, to be honest, I only have a few ideas for some certain GOI formats, but this tab won’t have a lot of them, if at all. But I will write something in a GOI format. Eventually.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Collaborations]]\n\nDon’t have any of these yet either, but if anyone has an idea for a collab that I would like, feel free to hit me up! I always want to collaborate with another author on this wiki, so if you have any ideas, feel free to contact me via Wikidot PM or preferably by DMing me via Discord (my username there is Merehrab).\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Stuff About Me]]\n\nHere’s some miscellaneous stuff about me if you want to know more about me specifically, I guess.\n\n* I’m asexual and aromantic.\n\n* My favorite written works are the Lord of the Rings trilogy and literally anything written by Terry Pratchett.\n\n* I am a big pasta lover. My favorite type of food is literally Italian food. I crave pasta. I’m so crazy for pasta that I’m going to go over to Italy right now and steal all the pasta there just for myself.\n\n* I’m also a fan of the horror genre. I especially like the original Halloween movie, creepypastas in general, and the games Bendy and the Ink Machine and Alien: Isolation.\n\n* Some music artists who I like to listen to are AJR[[footnote]]Yes, I know, I’m cringe, but at least I’m free to be happy listening to what I love, and you should too.[[/footnote]], Green Day, Weezer, Megadeth, Elton John, The Beatles, The Killers, The Darkness, Radiohead, Mumford and Sons, No Doubt, Kendrick Lamar, and a whole lot more!\n\n* I’m a big D&D fan, and a fan of the D&D web series Critical Role. I still have not played an actual game of D&D once in my life.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Author Will]]\n\nIn the case that I am inactive from the wiki and uncontactable for longer than two years, here is what I want for my written works:\n\n* All my SCPs that are under 30 upvotes and all my tales and GOI formats that are under 15 upvotes are to be put up for rewrite. That means that they should have the rewritable tag and anyone is allowed to rewrite the SCP or tale.\n\n* All my co-authored works should go to their respective co-authors.\n\n* All of my Art Exchange gifts should be given to their giftees.\n\nEverything else should stay untouched besides SPaG fixes and licensing stuff and tags. Thank you.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n\nTo everyone who posted an article to the wiki, is a member of site staff, left a comment on an article, and upvoted or downvoted an article, especially the ones featured here, and to all those in the community who supported me every step of the way, thank you.
