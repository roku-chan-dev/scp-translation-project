It would have to be embedded in the Mesh itself, which is doable.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##fdf1f2|N/A:##[[/span]] Right, you keep mentioning an adaptive mesh. What is it?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##783a8d|POI-7912:##[[/span]] Well, it's a mesh that adapts to things. That doesn't make sense?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##fdf1f2|N/A:##[[/span]] No--It- I thought there would be more to it than that.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##783a8d|POI-7912:##[[/span]] None whatsoever.

One gestalt sure, but, you knew each other's names. And mine. You could form us separate and that separation was so profound. We were lost in this state. I mean, the things you could do with that dodecahedron inside you. You'd have not believed it. \n\nA conference room? A holding cell? //<Scoffs.>// Think of floating castles, arboretums in the clouds, skyscrapers above them. Orangeries on their rooftop gardens. Infinitely. Our power was infinite. Or so we thought.\n\nWe began to worry about that place, that hole in nothing that can be anything, so long as it wasn't the right thing. We started seeing it, in daydreams, when we closed our eyes. A vast and pulsating void, I would feel myself sink into an ocean of tar, where every direction of escape was wrong and led further downhill, further into darkness. The liquid would climb up my body and pour itself into my mouth and nose... I could feel every sensation. I'd never been so frightened. \n\nWe decided to start looking, not knowing what we'd do with it. Do we jump back in, fully changed to the state we are now, or does the nature and direction of time preclude that possibility? Were there states worse than this one we'd been given as mercy?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##fdf1f2|N/A:##[[/span]] So, you couldn't do it.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##783a8d|POI-7912:##[[/span]] //<Stands, enraged.>// No, //we// couldn't do it! You were there too, but only the physical images. You had figured out how to 'reformat' parts of your data so you could be unburdened by your ego, unburdened by your visions. Your memories. Abusing the same methods we used to improperly neutralize 184 in the first place. You'd leave instruction--\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##fdf1f2|N/A:##[[/span]] --Instructions for the next iteration, yes. It's a stopgap measure.
