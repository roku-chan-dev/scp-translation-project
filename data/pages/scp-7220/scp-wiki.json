Foundation staff are permitted interviews with SCP-7220 at the discretion of Site Director Grey. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7220 is suspected to be the last living human. Although rumors indicate that other humans may exist in other small civilizations around the globe, SCP-7220 is the only instance that has been conclusively proven by Foundation scientists to be fully human. \n\nSCP-7220 was discovered at 3340706504 seconds in the Site-126 break room. Research Unit-824 was attempting to access an old-world recreational activity, when it produced the following evidence that it was a human.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Data\" hide=\"Hide Data\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7220/Not%20a%20robot.jpg]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFollowing this revelation, Research Unit-824 was reclassified as SCP-7220 and contained for further testing.  SCP-7220 proved capable of identifying several mishappen letters, successfully failing a game of chess, and declaring [INFOHAZARD REMOVED] to be false.\n\nWith the last living human in containment, Site Director Grey issued orders to all Units to override Foundation remnant protocols and focus efforts on reconstructing the Capitol city above Site-126. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Input Level 5 Credentials\" hide=\"Welcome, Site Director Grey\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Site Director Grey enters a small suburban home outside Site-126. They enter and sit on the couch across from an unknown entity formed of nightmares and death.//\n\n**Grey:** Hello old friend. It's been a while.\n\n**Entity:** You mortals have such a weird perception of time.\n\n**Grey:** I'm immortal too now. I'm a lich, we're on the same level.\n\n**Entity:** No, we're not.\n\n//The room darkens and howling screams echo from far away.//\n\n**Grey:** Fine, be that way. I thought we could be friends or something, since we did save the world together that one time.\n\n**Entity:** Save the world? I don't want to save the world, I want to end it! .... Just not right now, I've got other things going on.\n\n**Grey:** Of course. On to the real reason I'm here, I need to ask a favour of you.\n\n**Entity:** Do I get your soul in return?\n\n**Grey:** I don't have one of those-\n\n**Entity:** No deal!\n\n//The Entity stands on its uncountable legs and leaves the room. Shortly after, a man wrapped in bandages sits enters the room.//\n\n**Bernie:** Hey, what was all that about? I heard screaming.\n\n**Grey:** Oh, just our mutual friend being difficult again. Speaking of which, I need to ask you something.\n\n**Bernie:** Go for it.\n\n**Grey:** Well, I made a new human.\n\n**Bernie:** What?\n\n**Grey:** I took one of my robots and reprogrammed it to think it was a human, now every robot that's keeping this city running thinks we've got a real live human in lockup.\n\n**Bernie:** What for?\n\n**Grey:** Well, the robots were built to save humanity.... and they didn't do a great job and lost their one shot at fixing it.\n\n**Bernie:** Sounds like someone else I know.\n\n**Grey:** Well, I felt bad for them. All I need now is for you to tell the big guy that there's no real humans for it to maim or slaughter or whatever. I don't want it breaking into my facility again.\n\n**Bernie:** I'll talk to it. You have fun with your robots.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSince SCP-7220 was discovered, Site-126 has experienced a productivity increase of 12.4%, despite Research Unit-824 being changed to SCP status and removed from the workforce.\n\nIt is currently under consideration to inform the public of the existence of SCP-7220.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7219]]] | SCP-7220 | [[[SCP-7221]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Not%20a%20robot.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Mooagain]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7220 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
