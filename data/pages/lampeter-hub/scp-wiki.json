It's cold outside tonight.\n> \n> What's that? Where are you? Well, you're on the Lampeter, my friend. Or what was once the Lampeter. It's seen better days. Used to be that you could travel from Orchard to Halocrest on these trails, but that was the old days, when the L-NESC was at its height, before the Foundation took it over. Now, it's just people like me; trapped in a tiny metal box at the side of a station, directing the trains going to and fro.\n> \n> Oh, you want to know how you got here? It's quite simple, really; you took a wrong turn in a train station, or a bus station, or you got on the wrong ski lift, or you stepped into an unfamiliar alley. There are so many different ways. Sooner or later, statistically, some version of yourself has to come here. You can go back, of course. Most do. But for some of us...\n> \n> Well, for some of us, the open sky is all there is left. So we man the stations of the multiverse, repairing these lines in scorching heat and bitter cold, maintaining what there is left to maintain. That's what the Lampeter is; the desperate, the lonely, the cold, standing vigil over a forgotten and unloved set of backroutes.\n> \n> Does that sound like your kind of life?\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Overview]]\n\nThe Lampeter is - or was - a vast interdimensional transport network. In the (supposedly) \"prime\" universe, it has an SCP designation - [[[SCP-7005|7005]]] - but there are so many universes, and so many Foundations trying to record the totality of what it is.\n\nIts basic form is made up of a diverse series of mundane transportation forms which, instead of taking the passenger to a location in their own universe, instead cross multiversal lines, taking the vehicle (or whatever else) and passenger to a different universe. The technology used to accomplish this is unknown, and the Foundation has been unable to replicate it. Complementing this are a number of pocket universes, used as transportation hubs, maintenance offices and other, diverse institutions necessary to the line's management. SCP-7005 gives the following examples of entry points onto the network from our world:\n\n> * A small wooden door in the back of the church of San Paolino, Lucca, which leads to an underground tram station that takes the traveller to a larger tram hub in Universe B723 \"Hospice\".\n> * An abandoned and cordoned-off jetty in northern Ishikari, Hokkaido; stepping onto it takes the traveller to a large seaport in Timeline Q944 \"Mintuci\".\n> * A lost-and-found office in a train station in Lima, Peru, which connects to a large train station in Universe H020 \"Great Inca State\".\n> * The back entrance of an Ilkhanid-era caravanserai in Kerman, Iran, which takes one to a nesting series of caravanserais, which are all located in ten separate timelines simultaneously.\n> * A patch of sky above northern Mongolia; aircraft passing through this area will be taken to an intra-universal airport (SCP-7005-77a), which services at least 350 universes in what the network's stationmasters commonly call the \"Far Southwestern Corridor\".\n\nThe Lampeter was created 700 years ago by members of the Lampeter family of Universe Z999 \"Halogen\", but it is now long past its prime. The Lampeter Non-Euclidean Shipping Company (L-NESC), a formal company created by the family in the 17th century to more efficiently manage its expanding network, began to decay and collapse in the late 19th century and eventually went bankrupt in 2021.\n\nBy that point, their control over the lines had diminished severely, with many outlying regions under the control of local companies, states and warlords. But the company's control over the central parts of its line remained necessary for any kind of large-scale multiversal travel. The last chairman of the board, John Lampeter, went insane, burning the company archives - and possibly himself - to death, believing the Lampeter to be responsible for the emergence of the phenomenon known as the Neon God - but that is a story that has been told elsewhere.\n\nIt was at this point that the Foundation stepped in. Recognising that its multiversal interests would collapse without some control over the network, the Foundation from our world rechristened its universe A001 \"Prime\" and bought out what remained of the L-NESC. But the sheer scale, the confusion, the tangled non-Euclidean webs of the Lampeter have prevented them from taking anything like full control of the network - or even the stations once under the L-NESC's control.\n\nSo, in the present day, it is manned largely by lonely, strange, desparate people. Some want to either hide away where they can never be found. Some romanticise the line, the long hours and grinding conditions to keep the world manned. Either way, rust, destitution, collapse and patchwork maintenance solutions are now the norm across the network. The Foundation's Department of Interdimensional Logistics has not been given the proper resources, its few central employees are overworked and burnt out.\n\n-----\n\nAs any decent seer or scryer could tell you, the Foundation's Department of Interdimensional Logistics will never establish complete control. Their intervention will keep the lines going, but more and more they'll just be the biggest fish in a diverse pond, never being given enough resources or manpower to match the L-NESC at its height. In a few centuries time, the technology known as arc blinking (a kind of multiversal teleportation) will render the lines obsolete. The Foundation will withdraw entirely, and the Lampeter will decay in total neglect.\n\nStill, even then, a few lines will keep going, patronised by poorer or more cautious worlds. The Multiversal Cargo Train will be the most prominent of the remaining lines, a rare example of a Lampeter line travelling directly through the gaps between worlds. But even the drivers will have forgotten the name Lampeter, and the multiverse will forget that name and its history.\n\nBut the essence of the Lampeter is only partially found in the place itself. It is also in the stories told about a congolmeration so vast, diverse and uncontrolled that the mind can only partially grasp it, projecting onto it ideologies, narratives, hopes and dreams it was never built for. It is, has been, and perhaps will be a place where the forgotten, desparate and forlorn seek to escape their reality and build a new life - be it in some far-off world or on the lines themselves.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Documentation]]\n\n(Please add any articles I may have missed!)\n\n**The Past (The L-NESC and the Lampeter family)**\n\n//The Lampeter thrives. Under the aegis of the Lampeter family and the L-NESC, travel is facilitated across the multiverse, on gleaming trains and golden stations. At least, that's how everyone remembers it.//\n\n[[[Three Steps from Heaven]]]\n\n**The Present (Department of Interdimensional Logistics)**\n\n//The Lampeter dies. The L-NESC is no more, the Lampeter family is all gone. The Foundation's Department of Interdimensional Logistics tries to hold the line, its employees manning lonely berths in the cold and the dark.//\n\n[[[SCP-7005]]] - The Neon God\n[[[Tears of a Neon God]]]\n[[[in-restless-dreams-i-walked-alone|In Restless Dreams, I Walked Alone.]]]\n[[[the-smog-wastes-of-neoamerica|Lampeter Registrar Entry: The Smog-Wastes of NeoAmerica]]]\n[[[The Lampeter Limited]]]\n[[[SCP-7764]]] - **Blackbox ##69856F|Ghosts##**\n[[[SCP-8817]]] - To You, The World\n[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-695-fr|SCP-695-FR]]] - Fog of Concrete\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lampeter-sociology Lampeter Sociology]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-limbo In Limbo] - Voids, Anthros, Flickers\n[[[Multi-Goddess Drifting]]]\n\n**The Future (After the Foundation)**\n\n//The Lampeter is no more. Arc blinking has rendered it obsolete, and its name lives on only in history books. But as a vast, multidimensional Foundation regulates time and existence, and the little town of Lamplight shines on the edge of reality, a few broken, scattered lines survive in distant worlds, their origins forgotten.//\n\n[[[SCP-5005]]] - Lamplight\n[[[For Merely Dreaming We Were Snow]]]\n[[[Ambrose Lamplight]]]\n[[[Foundation of Nomads]]] - A Tale Series\n[[[we-can-t-stay-here-anymore |We can't stay here anymore]]]\n[[[Ever Onwards To The Light]]]\n[[[An Only Child]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Writing Guide]]\n\nThere is no format or particular style that stories set on the Lampeter - or its past and future versions - need to be written in. It's designed to hold a diverse series of SCPs and tales, united only by the presence of the Lampeter network and a general vibe of individuals existing in physical, social and political structures, often ruined ones, that dwarf them. Any stories about the Neon God also belong here, since - as [[[scp-7005|the original SCP]]] details - it's an integral part of the Lampeter's world.\n\nStories set in the past might, for instance, provide a sense of prosperity tinged with the inevitable decline that is to follow. Stories set in the present might be surrounded by a sense of a forgotten past that is now dying, or be about people trying to survive and escape in incresaingly desperate conditions. Stories set in the future might have a strong sense of nostalgia for the Lampeter and the world that was once centred around it. And the people manning the network or who are using it to flee - either from the Neon God or something else - are a critical part of the canon.\n\nBut ultimately, though, just have fun with it - the above suggestions are just that, suggestions. I don't mind at all people adding to or slightly altering the canonical rules that have been laid down - there are as many Lampeters as can be conceived, after all.\n\nThe canon also now has a CSS theme that can be added to your articles, courtesy of [[*user HaydenSaintPascal]], that can be found [[[theme:lampeter-warm|here]]].\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** lampeter.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Olicus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
