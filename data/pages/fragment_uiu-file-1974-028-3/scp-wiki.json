This ability appears to be unconscious while it is triggered (usu. daily), but reports from before the suspect was affected seem to imply the recognition of the anomalous properties when the host is dying or dead.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Suspect currently believes he is a character in a \"pulp fiction\" story and thus will behave with the same motivations as his character. \n\n**Modus Operandi:** Suspect is armed with a standard FBI-Issue Model 19 revolver. Additionally, since the suspect's character is a private investigator, the suspect will pursue such an avenue of involvement with any violent crime committed in the vicinity of Rothsville.\n\n**Behavior:** Highly delusional under self-inflicted anomalous properties. Do not approach without taking preparations in advance. Suspect will not respond to birth name but will respond to the \"David Hoffmann\" alias.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Evidence]]\n\n**A │ Death of \"Silvia Kohl\":** After Agent Pryor's murder of the prior suspect \"Silvia Kohl\", she did not become a new town 'character', allowing Agent Pryor to effectively replace Kohl in the position she held socially in the town, albeit as a different 'character'.\n\n**B │ Agent Pryor's Report:** The report sent by Agent Pryor clearly shows a degradation in mental stability and a shift of responsibility and tone from that of a capable UIU agent into one of the protagonists of mystery stories found in the pulp fiction genre. \n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Records]]\n\n**Current Status:** Under Surveillance\n\n**Crimes:** 2 counts of First Degree murder, Treason\n\n**Sentencing:** 40 years in a state penitentiary/hospice\n\n**History of UIU Action:** \n3-01-74: Surveillance is kept on high after the failure of the first undercover team. No UIU agents are authorized to enter the town of Rothsville without prior background screening. The Foundation has taken over quarantine and containment of the town. The UIU is still allowed to monitor the town for asset retrieval (the suspect) only.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Records (uptd.)]]\n\n**Current Status:** Deceased (d. 1979)\n\n**Crimes:** N/A\n\n**Sentencing:** N/A\n\n**History of UIU Action:** \n04-21-79: The suspect was pronounced dead after an altercation with a recent immigrant to the town (under the character of \"Nicholas Argosy\") of Rothsville led into a lethal fight. Surveillance suggests that the immigrant and Pryor had antagonized each other for several weeks, before the immigrant confronted Pryor in the latter's apartment and shot him point-blank. It is surmised that the immigrant has again replaced Pryor's role in the town, although a lack of resources at this moment and blockading from the Foundation prevents us from confirming this fact.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; font-family: courier; font-size: 1em; color: #11ff21; border:solid 2px #0bbc17; background:#002d03;\"]]\n[[table style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; width: 45%;\"]]\n[[span class=\"colorlink\"]][http://scp-wiki.net/uiu-file-1974-028/offset/2 «« PETRA: 1979 - 028/1][[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; width: 40%; float: right\"]]\nEND 1974-028 FILE\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]",
