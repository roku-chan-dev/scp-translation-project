SCP-5021-1 instances are to be supervised for no less than four hours.  As a result of the events described in Incident Report 5021.2, SCP-5021-2 is considered to be neutralized. Containment is no longer necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5021 is a chewing gum product named \"Long Arm Stretch\". Each package bears no images or text save for the product name, and contains eight sticks of gum. The Foundation is currently in possession of 43 packs of SCP-5021.\n\nWhen SCP-5021 is chewed for approximately 30 seconds, the individual (designated SCP-5021-1) is capable of extending their arm at exponential speeds by vocalizing the product's name. This effect can be activated within four hours of first chewing the gum. The affected arm is capable of breaking through walls and other barriers if allowed to build enough speed, though this is difficult to achieve outside of a test environment.\n\nThe affected arm will travel in the direction the subject's wrist is pointing when the activating phrase is spoken, stopping when it reaches a surface that cannot be penetrated or otherwise destroyed. If the subject's arm is not held straight prior to vocalization (e.g. subject's wrist or elbow is bent.) it will forcibly straighten before extending. SCP-5021-1 instances cannot change the direction of their arm during this time. The subject will then 'reel in' to the point the affected limb has reached.\n\nSCP-5021-1 instances experience no discomfort during this period, and are incapable of perceiving pain, though describe an 'exhilarating, whooshing sensation'. \n\n\n**Recovery Log**:\nSCP-5021 was recovered on 06/11/2018 after the Foundation intercepted online livestream footage of SCP-5021-2. Footage showed SCP-5021-2 2:37 AM in Mid Glamorgan, Wales, under the effects of SCP-5021, with the affected limb extending an unknown distance upwards. SCP-5021-2 is visibly distressed during this process, vocalising frantically and unable to move. \n\nFoundation operatives positioned nearby attempted to take SCP-5021-2 into custody, but were obstructed by SCP-5021-2's arm. Field Agent Jones made a decision to amputate the affected limb using an angle grinder from a nearby construction site, allowing SCP-5021-2 to move freely. Notably, once the arm had been severed, it continued to accelerate, reaching Mach 1 and creating a sonic boom several minutes after, travelling beyond the view of Foundation satellites.\n\nSCP-5021-2 cooperated with their relocation, and was reportedly grateful to Field Agent Jones for severing their limb. The amputation of the subject's arm was observed to heal at a rapidly accelerated rate during recovery.\n\nEyewitnesses were taken in for routine interviews and amnestication, during which the vendor of SCP-5021 was discovered. All footage of the incident has been scrubbed from the internet, and a cover story about an ARG has been spread in relevant areas. The individual responsible for recording the livestream has yet to be located by Foundation personnel. \n\nThe vendor of SCP-5021 claimed it came with their ordinary shipment, and that they hadn't considered them particularly noteworthy. Further investigation is ongoing.\n\n\n**Interview Log 5021-2.1a**\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-5021-2\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Lennox\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-5021-2 has spent the night in Foundation custody and has responded positively to an interview request.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Good morning SCP-5021-2. How are you feeling?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** I've had better days, not going to lie. It's proper weird, this.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Yes, I can appreciate that. You've shown an admirable amount of patience, I'm sure you have a lot of questions.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** I do yeah, but after talking to the lads who took me in yesterday I don't imagine I'll be getting many answers.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** I'm afraid you're right. In fact, we have a few questions for you about SCP-5021.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Honestly, ask away. The sooner everything goes back to normal, the better.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** How did you first come across SCP-5021?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Me and the boys were out on the piss, so I don't remember all of it properly.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Even a rough idea would help, don't worry.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Gazza starts shouting about needing to pick up cigars, cos he's switching from cigarettes, see. So we head down to Dai's shop; only place in walking distance that sells cigars-\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** And this is where you discover SCP-5021?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** It is, yeah. I saw it on the shelf near the cash and it looked so sketchy I couldn't help myself. I says to Dai 'how much is this, boss?' he says 'two pounds' I says-\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** I get the picture, SCP-5021-2, thank you. Do you remember the events prior to...the incident?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** One of the boys dared me to try this backyard, homemade gum and I'm absolutely steaming so I do it right away. It tastes alright, nothing to write home about, but I remember at some point in the evening Gazza is trying to steal the gum off me, and I'm holding it above my head, because he's only little, and I say 'you can't have my...'\n> \n> //SCP-5021-2 trails off and sighs//\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Then I said the name on the packet, and here we are. I'd rather not say it again, just in case.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** That's understandable. I just have one more question, if that's alright.\n> \n> //SCP-5021-2 nods//\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Have you experienced  any other ill effects since the separation of your arm?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Oh you're on about the phantom limb feelings, are you?\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** You're experiencing phantom limb sensations? Go on.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Yeah, it feels like it's stuck in a fist, and it's bloody freezing. Constantly freezing.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** That will be all for today SCP-5021-2, you've been extremely helpful. We'll be in touch.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** So when do you reckon I'm getting out, then? I've got tickets to see Cardiff City next week.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** We'll keep you informed. Thank you, SCP-5021-2.\n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 5021.2.A\" hide=\"- collapse\"]]\n\n**Addendum 5021.2.A**\n> //I have compiled any notable observations from my sessions with SCP-5021-2 here.- Dr. Lennox.//\n\n\n**Date: 06/23/18**\n**Notes:** Subject has noted that they are unable to grow facial hair. Though basic observation proves this to be true, medical analysis of SCP-5021-2 reveals no alteration, anomalous or otherwise, to subject's hair follicles.\n\n----\n\n**Date: 11/12/18**\n**Notes:** After several weeks of requesting, I have informed SCP-5021-2, with Site Director approval, that the general population, their family included, believe SCP-5021-2 to be missing, presumed dead. \nSubject did not respond to any questions after hearing this. After 2 minutes subject indicates they anticipated this being the case, and that they'd like to be alone.\n\n//Subject was unwilling to communicate for 5 weeks following this session - Dr. Lennox//\n\n----\n\n**Date: ██/██/19**\n**Notes:** SCP-5021-2 was heard shouting and complaining of pain in their arm. After the apparent pain had subsided SCP-5021-2 described the sensation as \"an intense burning, like someone was holding his arm in a pizza oven.\"\n\n//Foundation deep space satellites observed an unpredicted supernova along the trajectory path of SCP-5021-2's anomalous limb on ██/██/██ in the [REDACTED] galaxy. Credible cover story has been planted in civilian scientific journals successfully.//\n\n//While there is no guarantee this cosmic event is the result of SCP-5021-2, it is considered likely. The distance of the event from Earth and the date the Foundation recovered SCP-5021-2 would suggest the subject's arm has been traveling faster than light for at least ███ months. - Dr. Rhys//\n\n----\n\n**Date: 11/05/28**\n**Notes:** SCP-5021-2 vocalizes a concern that many staff on site have: SCP-5021-2 has not visibly aged during its stay with the Foundation. SCP-5021-2's hair, toenails and fingernails do not grow or decay. It appears their body is a 'stasis' of sorts. It can be assumed that any individual that experiences an incident similar to SCP-5021-2's can expect to experience similar effects.\nSCP-5021-2 expresses concern that although it has spent several years with the Foundation, it feels as though it is no closer to release.\n\n----\n\n**Date: ██/██/██**\n**Notes:** Today was the last meeting I had with SCP-5021-2. I honestly thought he'd be here the day I retired. \nSee Interview Log 5021-2.42p.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 5021-2.42p\" hide=\"- hide this content\"]]\n**Interview Log 5021-2.42p**\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-5021-2\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Lennox\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-5021-2 has requested an interview earlier than the scheduled session.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** How are you feeling, SCP-5021-2?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Same as usual, I suppose. I'm miserable in here, I read the paper and everything is miserable. I sit here and watch everyone age around me. Days feel like they're going in fast motion, but at least I still have my good looks.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Your sense of humour, too.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** You've got to use what you can to cope with being doomed.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** How do you figure you're doomed? Is that what you wanted to talk to me about?\n> \n> //SCP-5021-2 sighs//\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Do you fancy listening to a story about my nan?\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Of course, I'm a big fan.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** See, I knew you'd think she was a legend. Now, as you know, she works with old people, or, worked with them before retiring, herself. There was this old boy, Arthur, and he'd seen it all, right? He was in both the wars, he's been knocking around forever, old Arthur, right?\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Right.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Now, one day Arthur decides he's had a gut's full of life; he can't walk to the bookies because his hips gave out, and he went and outlived both his kids, and his wife, so he doesn't even have anybody to complain to about it. So he gets the injection.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** He opted for euthanasia? \n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** He did, but here's the thing, see: I thought when you get the injection that that's it, job done, stick him with a needle and off to sleep, but no. It takes about ten days. Ten days of just wandering around waiting to die. My nan said it was like feeding a corpse. I'm not too different from Arthur, see, Just different medicine. I don't know what's going to happen to me, but it's not going to be nice, is it?\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** I understand your fear, SCP-5021-2. To be frank, your case is somewhat unique. You bringing up euthanasia worries me, though. Is it something you've considered?\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Not really, like. I've been thinking about the comparison a lot, is all.\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** Well that's hardly encouraging. We can schedule extra sessions and try a broader variety of recreational activities going forward, if you'd like?\n> \n> //SCP-5021-2 rubs his stump and sighs//\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** I don't think it's going to matter soon.\n>\n> //Dr. Lennox glances at a notification on her phone//\n> \n> **Dr. Lennox:** I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut today's meeting short, SCP-5021-2. We'll pick this up in a few hours.\n> \n> **SCP-5021-2:** Alright, I can't imagine I'd be doing anything else.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Report 5021.2\" hide=\"- hide this content\"]]\n\n**Incident Report 5021.2**\n> On ██/██/42  at 12:42 SCP-5021-2 breached containment while sitting in the site cafeteria. Subject accelerated at speeds far surpassing the speed of light at an angle of 9° from the ground. Subject reportedly did not move from seated position during this incident.\n> \n> The incident left several holes in SCP-5021-2's wake, caused a sonic boom in the site cafeteria, and, most grievously, the object's Faster Than Light properties created a ██m localized temporal distortion field within Site-288's cafeteria. Enough structural damage occured that a complete reconstruction of the site was necessary.\n\n//It's terrible what happened, yes, but I can't stop thinking about the scenario if it had happened a few hours later, or a few hours sooner, and the Earth wasn't in such a fortuitous position. -Dr. Rhys// \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5020]]] | SCP-5021 | [[[SCP-5022]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
