All attempts to rescue SCP-823-KO-1 have failed, including those made by the ROK Army Ground Operations Command.\n\n--Communication should always be on standby for messages sent by SCP-823-KO-1 to Checkpoint █.--\n\nTo block wired and wireless communications that SCP-823-KO-1 sends to Checkpoint █, all PRC-96K radios and integrated telephone equipment are replaced with new ones.\n\nThe area where the anomaly of the entity can be observed is an active operational region in South Korea, and considering its military sensitivity, excessive interference such as Foundation troop support will not occur. Military personnel and officers involved in related matters within divisions and lower units will be administered Class-C amnestics upon discharge.\n\nThe Ground Operations Command is to handle all other necessary security-related procedures.\n\n**Description:** SCP-823-KO refers to the incident in 20██ at the GOP Checkpoint █ within Unit ██, where Private First Class(PFC) Baek Dong-hyun[[footnote]]Designated as SCP-823-KO-1.[[/footnote]] went missing. At the time of the incident, SCP-823-KO-1 was reported to have \"disappeared without a trace as the guard post door closed due to the wind while inspecting the upper post while patrolling Checkpoint █'s patrol area.\"[[footnote]]Sergeant ███, who was patrolling together, was unaffected, possibly because he was outside the post and thus avoided the anomalous effects of SCP-823-KO.[[/footnote]] Notably, despite this, wired and wireless communications can still be received from SCP-823-KO-1. It appears that SCP-823-KO-1 is using the radio it was carrying at the time and 9 wired devices installed in posts within the sector. This allowed for an interview regarding the location of SCP-823-KO-1.\n\nSCP-823-KO-1 stated that he is isolated in a location almost identical to the baseline world but cannot leave the patrol area of Checkpoint █. According to further testimony, no one else is in the area,[[footnote]]Designated as SCP-823-KO-2.[[/footnote]] it is always night, and it is impossible to leave the patrol route or follow it to the patrol area of another checkpoint for unknown reasons. Additionally, there are many unanswered questions, such as how SCP-823-KO-1 can survive without food and water. Despite extensive research, very little has been discovered about these anomalies.\n\n\n**Addendum 823-KO-A: Recording of PFC Baek**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n> At 23:00 on the day of the incident, the personnel on duty received a message from PFC Baek Dong Hyeon via a call in the integrated situation room. The source of the transmission, as indicated on the circuit board, was Outpost █-9. The initial receiver and recorder of the message was PFC ███, and this was the first communication received from PFC Baek Dong-hyun.\n> \n> ----\n> \n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> **PFC ███:** This is Private First Class ███ of Checkpoint █, how may I help you?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Hello? ██? Is that you, ██?\n> \n> **PFC ███:** What? PFC Baek? (//Commotion within the room//) W-wait a second, sir. (//Shouting away from the telephone//) Lieutenant Jang! Sir!\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Wait! No! ██? ███?\n> \n> **2nd Lieutenant(2LT) Jang ██:** Hey, Donghyeon! This is your checkpoint supervisor. Where are you right now?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** S-sir? What is going on right now?\n> \n> **2LT Jang:** What? Are you for- Where the hell were you? Where is your location? \n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I- Now- Wait- I'm at Oupost █-9. What is going on? It suddenly became dark, nobody was outside, and I couldn't see Sergeant █ anywhere...\n> \n> **2LT Jang:** Son, I'm leaving now. Stay where you are! (Shouting away from the telephone) Hey! Prepare the signallers for dispatch right now! ...\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Sir? Hello?\n> \n> //Brief Silence//\n> \n> **PFC Seong Junggi:** Donghyeon! What is going on right now?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Hey, Junggi, I don't fucking know what the fuck is going on. What in the world... Where's Sergeant ███? Where are the others?\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** We were all outside searching for you! The whole unit's in chaos. Sergeant ███ was sent to the Battalion HQ for interrogation. I thought he shot you and buried your body somewhere.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Hey, he's going to get discharged soon; he's not even carrying his own bullets.[[footnote]]**Translator's Note:** South Korea has a conscription system. Healthy men aged 19 to 34 have to serve in the military for around 2 years. The final rank before discharge for most people is Sergeant.[[/footnote]] I'm carrying them for him.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** So, where have you and your precious rounds been for the last seven hours?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I- I really don't know... Fuck, I can smell all the paperwork that I'm gonna do for something I have no idea about.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** Anyways, thank goodness you're fine. The Lieutenant will be there soon.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Alright. Uh... I can't see him yet.\n> \n> **2LT Jang:** (On radio) //Blows into the mic twice// Mr Baek with two bars on his hat, show yourself. This is the checkpoint supervisor, over.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Ah, Private 1st Class Baek Donghyeon reporting, over.\n> \n> **2LT Jang:** (On radio) Current location is Outpost █-9, over\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Uh... Me too, over?\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** Hello, this is Private 1st Class Seong Junggi from Checkpoint █.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Wait, you're on day duty today?\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** I requested because of you. You bastard, look what you've done. Thanks to you, I saw a helicopter here for the first time. The search party is searching through the DMZ; no stone unturned.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I'm here. It shows which outpost I'm calling from right there on your radar.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** That's the mystery. Some Wizard of Wonderland shit. We keep getting calls from someone who's not there. Are you fucking dead? Is this your ghost speaking? Fuck, gives me the chills.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I don't have any grudges. I'd rather be in hell than here.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** Why don't you walk towards us? Have you been outside the outpost?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** The squad leader told me to wait, so I didn't. Let me try.\n> \n> //Brief Silence//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Uh... It's hard to explain. I did get outside the outpost and onto the patrol route. But I can't get to the supply road. I just can't. Or, more like it's impossible for me to. This thing... It doesn't look like a road. Oh, and one more thing: It's 7 AM, but it's pitch black here. This looks nothing like a morning. Security lights are off because it's daytime. I can't see anything.\n> \n> **PFC Seong:** Yeah, what the hell... Thanks for the extra paperwork, crew cut.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (//Laughter//) Yeah, go shit yourself.\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> //At this point, the Foundation obtained information about SCP-823-KO and dispatched the Head of Site research team, Yeon Soha and three intelligence agents as a containment team. They were disguised as members of the █ Corps direct intelligence preparation squad and were each given appropriate cover ranks. A field camp was established within the patrol area of Checkpoint █.//\n> \n> **Corporal(Cpl) Seong:** (On radio) //*Blow*// What are you doing Baek, over.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Just lying on the road, over.\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) Are you a hobo, over?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) The full moon is especially beautiful today, over.\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) ...Do you know what day it is?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Hmm... Someone's birthday?\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) Our promotion to corporal.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Hah, meaningless, over.\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) The higher-ups sent an analysis team. I didn't think much of it, but the corps sent it. \n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Did you see any four-starred generals, over?\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) Don't know, but I heard a Major General came over. Over.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Aight, meaning-fucking-less, over.\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) ...Please come back. I postponed my vacation because of you, over.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (On radio) Baek out.\n> \n> **Cpl Seong:** (On radio) Seong Out, end of communication.\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> **1st Lieutenant(1LT) Jang:** So, you can't get onto the main supply road for some reason, right?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Affirmative, sir.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Baek, pull out your grenade right there.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** A grenade? Are you sure?\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** I got it approved by the battalion. Trust me.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Um... OK, wait a miute. Done.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Can you throw it at the fence down there?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Yes, sir. I'll be there.\n> \n> //Shortly after, an explosion can be heard from the phone. The baseline is unaffected.//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** It exploded. The fence and stairs are now smithereens.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Here... Nothing happened. I can't even hear the explosion.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I wasn't expecting much. Anyways, what should I do with this hole here?\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Leave it. Wait, can you cross over the hole?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Uh... OK, wait a minute, sir.\n> \n> //Several minutes later//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Right, this feels different from the main supply road, sir. But it didn't feel right, so I stepped only one foot out.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Wait, this feels like I'm asking you to cross to North Korea. Scratch that. Well done.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Sir, before you leave.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Hmm?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Congratulations on your promotion, sir.\n> \n> **1LT Jang:** Thanks.\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> **Sergeant(SGT) Seong:** Yo.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** What.\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** I'm staying in the military.[[footnote]]**Translator's note:** One can decide to remain in the military after mandatory service to pursue it as their career and become promoted to staff sergeant.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** You moron.\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** No, this is for real.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** But why?\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** I mean, I have nothing to do. I just did it. (Brief pause) Why are you asking?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** If you're doing this because of me...\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** (Brief pause) It's not.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Fuck, fuck, fuck!! Junggi, I'm so overwhelmed. How long am I supposed to live like this? What the fuck did I do wrong? Huh?\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** Donghyeon.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** So, I have to live my fucking life, my entire life like this? I'm here stranded in god knows where, wasting time, and I...\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** Donghyeon.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** When I was gonna say don't do it if you're doing it because of me, it got blocked on the back of my throat. I thought you'd leave me here. Am I not a selfish prick? But, this is fucking scary. Fuck, what if everyone gives up on me? What if everyone just abandons me with no hope...\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** Donghyeon, that won't happen. We all know you're going through the roughest time. Nobody is abandoning you.\n> \n> //Long silence//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (//Long sigh//).... Fuuuuck, I need a cigarette.\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** Let's smoke together once you return.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** ...You don't even smoke.\n> \n> //Short silence//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** What, you started smoking? Fuck me, man.\n> \n> **SGT Seong:** Bye.\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> **Staff Sergeant(SSG) Seong:** How was your experiment with lieutenant Yeon?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Well, she was an odd lady. So was her experiment.\n> \n> **SSG Seong:** She's a good person and around the same age as us.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Huh, I didn't know you were so interested in her.\n> \n> **SSG Seong:** Piss off. I'm running today's experiments.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Yes! Sergeant! Your wish is my command!\n> \n> **SSG Seong:** You remember the Claymore detonator in outpost █-8?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Claymore? It's in █-13, too.\n> \n> **SSG Seong:** We place a detonator every night, so there should be one right now. Try to find it.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** (//Metal box opening//) Well, here it is. So, blast this thing now?\n> \n> **SSG Seong:** No, no, no, no. OK, now. Blast it now.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I'm nervous. Just a sec.\n> \n> //Giant explosion. The claymore in the baseline world was also detonated.//\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> //At this point, SCP-823-KO-1 was honorarily discharged after the board decision from higher command.//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** It's raining.\n> \n> //Silence//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I should have been discharged by now.\n> \n> //Silence, sounds of slight rainfall//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** I was going to go to Seoul once I finished my service. My town, ██, it's nowhere. There is nothing there but clean air.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Get a room, do part-time jobs, get an education, and... the audition.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Junggi, you, you went to college... Man, you're now sergeant first class. What are you going to do with college?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** ... I'm all sick of this. I'm through.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Junggi? Seungwoo? Who is this?\n> \n> **2LT ███:** ... This is the leader of the █ platoon. I was just commissioned here.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Oh, It's an honour, sir.\n> \n> **2LT ███:** Mr Donghyeon, you're not a soldier anymore. You're honorarily discharged following an accident on duty.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Oh? Oh, ah-. Then...\n> \n> //Silence, slightly heavier rainfall//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Isn't Junggi on duty today? It would be nice to speak to him.\n> \n> **2LT ███:** The vice supervisor is on holiday. Didn't he tell you?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Oh, no. Nope. I must have forgotten. Thank you.\n> \n> **2LT ███:** No problem, Donghyeon. Cheer up.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Of course. Wait, a moment, please.\n> \n> **2LT ███:** Yes?\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** So, I'm considered dead there, right?\n> \n> //Long silence, heavy rainfall//\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Does my family think I'm dead, too?\n> \n> **2LT ███:** (After long silence) Yes, this is heavily classified information.\n> \n> **PFC Baek:** Hmm... I see. Thank you.\n\n> ██/██/██.\n> \n> //Sergeant First Class(SFC) Seong Junggi attempted a radio call the morning after he returned from holiday.

Fuck it, Donghyeon, I'm here to say goodbye.\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio) ...I'm sorry I went on holiday without telling you. I kept thinking about you while I was away.\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio) I saw my parents after a long time. I thought they'd be mad, but they- they said nothing. I should have visited them more often. They can't visit the GOP either.\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio) ... I also saw your mother. I didn't have the courage... but my dad urged me to pay a visit... She was well, nowhere ill. I said hello and she just- just hugged me and started crying. I had much to say to her, but I... couldn't tell her much.\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio) Your mom gave me this while I was about to smoke. (Rustling) It looks like a watch. She must have prepared it for your discharge present.\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio) If you ever come back... Ask Captain Yeon to give it to you. I...\n> \n> //Short silence//\n> \n> **SFC Seong:** (On radio, choked up with emotion) I have to let you go.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 823-KO-B:** **Foundation experiment records**\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n> **Experiment Log 09.1**\n> \n> **Summary:** Check if SCP-823-KO-1 can return to reality under the conditions during the SCP-823-KO incident.\n> \n> **Result:** The door was left to close in the outpost, but nothing happened.\n\n> **Experiment Log 09.2**\n> \n> **Summary:** D-Class personnel are sent into SCP-823-KO-2 under the conditions during the SCP-823-KO incident.\n> \n> **Result:** D-6301 and 6302 were sent one by one into the outpost, and the door was left to close, but nothing happened. \n> \n> **Note:** Using two soldiers on active duty from Unit ██ was proposed to the ██ Republic of Korea Army Command but was sternly rejected.\n\n> **Experiment Log 09.3**\n> \n> **Summary:** The Containment team from Dimension Site-62 is dispatched to analyse SCP-823-KO-2 and rescue SCP-823-KO-1\n> \n> **Result:** No extradimensional or anomalous dimensional passages were found. The radio signals from SCP-823-KO-1 reflect his location within SCP-823-KO-2, but attempts to trace the source did not extend beyond the boundaries of reality. An investigation of six open pocket dimensions in the surrounding area found no passages related to SCP-823-KO.\n> \n> **Note:** We're upset knowing there's one more thing we cannot contain after this investigation. However, this could mean that SCP-823-KO-2 might not be related to spaces or dimensions. For example, it could be a hazard. I suggest that we take a more open approach.\n> [[>]]\n> **─ Dimensional Containment Expert W.**\n> [[/>]]\n\n> **Experiment Log 9.4**\n> \n> **Summary:** The previous experiment revealed that SCP-823-KO-1 can only interact with reality via electronics. It is to be checked if photographic equipment, such as cameras, can record SCP-823-KO-1. \n> \n> **Result:** No cameras cannot capture SCP-823-KO-1. It seems that he can interact with only the equipment present within the sector during SCP-823-KO.\n\n> **Experiment Log 9.5**\n> \n> **Summary:** Check if transmissions from SCP-823-KO-1 are not real but instead an illusion or an anomalous meme.\n> \n> **Result:** Meme response analysis revealed no possibility of any agents or the research team being exposed to hazardous memes or cognitohazards with 99.5% accuracy.\n\n> **Experiment Log 9.6**\n> \n> **Summary:** Based on **Experiment Log 9.4**, wired telephones in the outpost within the sector are replaced, checking if it disables communication with SCP-823-KO-1.\n> \n> **Result:** Replacing Outpost █-16's communications equipment rendered receiving signals from SCP-823-KO-1 impossible. Similarly, replacing the cables also disabled transmission.\n\n> **Experiment Log 10.1**\n> \n> **Summary:** To check if SCP-823-KO-2 is an illusion that SCP-823-KO-1 is experiencing, the radio PRC-96K is used as an ultrasonic transmitter to compare SCP-823-KO-2 with reality.\n> \n> **Result:** Using the collected data, a 3D modelling of SCP-823-KO-2 was constructed. No big differences with reality were found.\n\n> **Experiment Log 10.2**\n> \n> **Summary:** The research team hypothesised that an anomalous effect prevents SCP-823-KO-1 from escaping the sector. Using [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-061 SCP-061], SCP-823-KO-1 is guided out of the sector.\n> \n> **Results:**\n> \n> **[Start of Log]**\n> \n> SCP-823-KO-1 was affected by SCP-061 through wireless transmission, entering a \"Stable state\". Site Research Head Yeon Soha directs specific behaviour, and Researcher W. sends encrypted auditory commands.\n> \n> **Yeon:** Good, can you hear me? Press the alarm button once if nothing's happening. Press it twice if it is.\n> \n> //Beep//\n> \n> **Yeon:** Walk ten steps and report.\n> \n> //Beep//\n> \n> **Yeon:** Good. Now... turn yourself towards the main supply road, go three steps, and report.\n> \n> //Two beeps//\n> \n> **Yeon:** (Sigh) That's a fail. We have to check for other methods.\n> \n> **[End of Log]**\n\n> **Experiment Log 10.3**\n> \n> **Summary:** SCP-823-KO-1 cannot access food, water, or other daily items. However, the subject appears undisturbed by such restrictions, nor does he feel the need for them. Records might suggest that SCP-823-KO-1 is an electronic-based instance.\n> \n> **Result:** An in-depth analysis by the research team revealed no evidence that SCP-823-KO-1 is an electronic instance. Attempts to investigate SCP-823-KO-1's physical properties, identities, or other statuses resulted only in vague conclusions.\n\n> **Experiment Proposal 10.4**\n> \n> **Summary:** SCP-823-KO-1 crosses the border to the North through the hole in the fence. If he exits SCP-823-KO-2, he is to be returned to South Korea with Foundation agents in North Korea.\n> \n> **Note:** The proposal is currently on hold.\n\n\n> **Experiment Proposal 19.█**\n> \n> **Summary:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **Note:** The proposal is under discussion.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 823-KO-C: Interview log of SFC Seong Junggi**\n\nOn ██/██/██, Sergeant Seong contacted the Site Head of Research, Yeon Soha, who was on regular leave, and proposed to have a meal together. Yeon agreed to meet on the day of Sergeant Song's return from leave, combining it with a regular interview.\n\n> **[Start of Log]**\n>  \n> Yeon enters through the restaurant door. Seong is already there waiting, sitting in his seat.\n> \n> **Yeon:** Mr Seong! How was your vacation?\n> \n> //Sound of chair pulling//\n> \n> **Seong:** It's been a while since I've been on holiday for this long. It was good. Well, I met friends and family I've not seen for a while.\n> \n> **Yeon:** That's because you stay on duty despite your holidays. Take care of yourself! Overworking takes a toll on your health.\n> \n> **Seong:** ...How can I leave him, just stranded there...\n> \n> //Short silence//\n> \n> **Yeon:** ...Rest assured that'll be dealt with. That's why we come each week.\n> \n> Seong opens the cutlery box and places chopsticks before Yeon. Yeon pours water into the metal cup. A server walks towards their table with plates.\n> \n> **Yeon:** That aside, it's our first meal together, and you bring us to a Korean BBQ? Pork belly makes your clothes smell like meat. I'm a lady, too, you know.\n> \n> **Seong:** This place has good meat.\n> \n> //The server places the plates with meat on it.//\n> \n> **Yeon:** I also got the extra pay for the holiday. Help yourself.\n> \n> **Yeon:** Ribeye? No complaints anymore, then! Thank you, Mr Seong!\n> \n> //Yeon grabs a pair of tongs and puts the pieces of meat on the grill.//\n> \n> **Seong:** Oh, yeah, I asked you out to talk about that.\n> \n> //Short silence//\n> \n> **Seong:** It's been a while, hasn't it, since that incident with Donghyeon. It's been six years. That's about as much as I've known you. It hurt me so much; he was my friend, and I joined the military with him. I couldn't stand it. That's why when █ Battalion moved out from the GOP, I stayed there as a corporal on duty with a different battalion. I couldn't leave him as a sergeant, so I stayed. I declined better positions, insisting on being vice checkpoint supervisor or combat squad leader so I could visit that place on patrol as much as possible.\n> \n> ...If he just went missing, I would have given up much earlier. But how can I ignore him when he keeps calling me? I've been insane since then. I didn't care if I got a call from home, I- I...\n> \n> //Seong downs the cup of water. After a short silence, Seong presses the bell and orders soju. A server soon brings a bottle of soju.//\n> \n> **Yeon:** You're returning to duty today. Are you sure about drinking?\n> \n> **Seong:** Recently, before I went out on holiday on duty, a sergeant close to me came and said he would be promoted to Master Sergeant next month, so he asked for my congratulations. I didn't know then, but that made me reflect on myself. I'm a first-class sergeant now, then I will become a master sergeant, then a sergeant major, and keep doing this shit on and on for the rest of my life. No offence to you, Captain Yeon, but honestly, you know that shit hasn't been done for who the fuck knows. The higher-ups kept bugging us, saying there was no hope before they eventually cut funds. I don't know if you know, but it's been a while.\n>  \n> A major asked if this whole fiasco is a harassment tactic from the North. My blood boiled, but I couldn't say anything. Frankly, we're trying to solve something that doesn't make sense, and that harassment tactic stuff did. They said they would stop investing funds and personnel in something that isn't profiting anyone. Then they went on about replacing all telephones with new ones as if nothing happened.\n>  \n> Well, isn't that fucking logical and appropriate? My emotional claims, devoid of any logic, were heavily criticised. (//Sobbing//) And, yes, I am exhausted.\n> \n> //Seong downs a shot of soju.//\n> \n> **[End of Log]**\n\nSergeant Seong was voluntarily discharged a few weeks after the interview. As per protocol, Seong was treated with amnestics. From then on, Foundation personnel and monetary support was significantly cut. Special containment procedures were revised so Foundation information agents are dispatched to SCP-823-KO quarterly. However, Yeon visited the place more often than that.\n\n**Addendum 823-KO-D: Log of Anomalous Events**\n\nAfter Seong's discharge and the complete severance of SCP-823-KO-1's communications, the sector personnel observed multiple anomalous events. However, it is unclear whether all these anomalies are related to SCP-823-KO.\n\n||**Location**||**Contents**||**Reporter**||\n||In front of Outpost █-1 ||An unknown voice and background noise resembling radio signals were heard. ||On-duty personnel in the outpost||\n||Outpost █-16||During a patrol, the outpost's wired telephone bell rang.
