Well, now you can exacerbate it! Introducing: Pizzacon!\n\nYou see, the problem with an upvote based economy is that there's just too many votes on the wiki, and attempting to establish a flat rate doesn't work for the purposes of capitalism. I'm not an economics major, so instead, we'll be working off a fluctuating rate, accounting for inflation: we'll be using motos.\n\nWhat's a moto, you ask? Well, in honor of moto42, the esteemed creator of SCP-173, the price of one pizza is now equal to 1 moto. I will not elaborate further.\n\n+ But what does this have to do with Pizzacon?\n\nI'm glad you asked! Have you ever wanted to catch up to those bigly named authors with a bajillion upvotes? Well, for today and today only, we're offering a special deal: every pizza you make and submit to the wiki and gets accepted will count as 1 moto's worth of votes! I did not consult anyone when writing this, but I'm sure this is completely allowed!\n\n+ Contest Information\n\n* Legally speaking, I am required to tell you that in joining the contest, you agree to waive your right to complain on the wiki about any cooking-related injuries. However, I'm sure that the brilliant minds behind the wiki can cook a pizza without fail... right?\n* By agreeing to join the contest, you agree to submit only the tastiest pizzas. No war crime creations are allowed, unless they generate a substantial amount of traffic to the site for Michal's ad revenue.\n* You __must__ indicate how long the pizza took you to make. Anyone can microwave a premade pizza. The amount of sweat you used correlates to how deserved your motos will be.\n* Not every pizza will be accepted! If it's not tasty enough, I will throw it in the trash and move on.\n\n+ Important Dates:\n**Announcement:** Now\n**Posting Opens:** When I get hungry\n**Posting Closes:** Once I'm full\n**Results Decided:** When I wake up from the food coma\n\n+ Entries\n\nSorry, I ate them all.\n\n+ Rules\n\n* Be kind to one another. Pineapple on pizza does not make you superior to someone else. While the Chicago Deep Dish is more pie than pizza, it also counts for this contest.\n* More than one entry is allowed per user. Collect your motos and take over the number one spot on crom![[footnote]] This contest was not sponsored nor supported by smlt [[/footnote]]\n* Pre-existing pizzas are not allowed. I don't want your stinky leftovers.\n* Yes you can absolutely send in store-bought pizzas, but I //will// judge you for it.\n* You can submit your pizzas anonymously, but don't expect a thank you in return.\n* Winners will be determined by me. Only me. Fuck the other contest committee members.\n* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their tastiness, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified and I'll keep your pizzas for no motos in exchange. Examples of shenanigans include, but are not limited to:\n * rat poison\n * disrupting the supply chain\n * marijuana monopolization\n* Bribery isn't allowed - however, I think spicy sausages are a topping worth getting VoNCed over and will give bonus points based on that.\n* The contest marshals for this contest are me, [[*user Naepic]]. Only me. These are my pizzas now. You can't have them anymore.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** ant.jpg\n> **Name:** 1724Ants of the Philippines eating slices of pizza 53\n> **Author:** Judgefloro\n> **License:** CC 0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1724Ants_of_the_Philippines_eating_slices_of_pizza_53.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
