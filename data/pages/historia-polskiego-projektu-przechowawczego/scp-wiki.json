[[/footnote]] Its main purpose was to investigate the activity of Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) and to confirm the existence as well as subsequent preservation of the anomalous [[[nexus-series|Free Port]]] of Esterberg (later classified as [[[SCP-5373]]]) largely inhabited by the previously mentioned Fae, located near Częstochowa in the former Kingdom of Poland.\n\nOver time, however, the Project's goals evolved, and its primary mission became to establish a foothold for the Foundation in the newly formed post-World War I Republic of Poland. Initial plans to secure SCP-5373 with classic methods failed, due to the protection and establishment of laws guaranteeing the independence of the Free Ports by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations League of Nations] in 1923.[[footnote]] Later revised by the Global Occult Coalition in 1945.[[/footnote]] Despite this, however, the Foundation did happen to violate these laws several times and entered Esterberg unauthorized; however, aside from these few incidents, the Foundation abandoned its plans to secure SCP-5373 and focused on monitoring it and conducting unarmed research explorations in the city, which were allowed by a loophole in the law.\n\nThe Polish Containment Project was finally disbanded and incorporated into the Foundation in October 1945 after the end of World War II, also known in the anomalous world as the VII Occult War.[[footnote]] A global occult conflict largely running parallel to World War II focusing on battles between the Allied Occult Initiative (AOI) transformed into the GOC after the war and the [[[/system:page-tags/tag/obskura|Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps]]] which was the paranormal wing of the SS.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #999999;\nbackground:#F5F5F5; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px auto;\"]]\n[[f>image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Abraham_Sulzbach.jpg width=\"145 px\" style=\"border: solid 3px #999999;\"]]\n\n[[size 120%]]**O5-11 - The Visionary** [DECEASED][[/size]]\n\nMale.

Reporting directly to O5-11, the individuals holding this position were, respectively, Hannah Rivera from 1914 to 1916 and Raia Micheals from 1916 until the end of the Project.\n\n> **Tactical Operations Command:** The military unit of the Project, responsible for protecting Project facilities, securing anomalies, and even neutralizing them in extreme cases. All Operational Formations operating within the Polish Containment Project fall under the Command.\n\n> **Unit of External Affairs and Diplomacy:** Responsible for all Foundation contacts with the Polish government, as well as anomalous communities. Their tasks also included recruiting staff for the Foundation in Poland, intelligence, searching for new anomalies, and maintaining secrecy about Project activities as well as spreading disinformation.\n\n> **Unit of Applied and Theoretical Sciences:** The experimentation and research division of the Project. Its tasks included developing new technology and equipment for the Project, as well as studying the anomalies it secured. They were often far more inclined than the rest of the Foundation to resort to more esoteric methods, which was related to O5-11 overseeing the Project.\n\n> **Unit of Containment and Maintenance:** Responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the Project's equipment and taking care of the containment of anomalies secured by the Project.\n\n> **Unit of Administration and Records:** Responsible for all administration, accounting, logistics and management of Project activities. They were also in charge of maintaining the Project's archives, as well as researching various archival materials in order to gain information on new and already secured anomalies.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n++ History\n\nThe Polish Containment Project existed for about 31 years, which can be further divided into three general periods lasting respectively:\n\n+++ 1914-1918\n\nThe project was initiated by O5-11 in February 1914. At its top, Hannah Rivera, who had been the Director of Site-30, was placed in the role of administrator. The expedition under her leadership set out for the Kingdom of Poland in June 1914 a month before the start of World War I, which greatly hampered the original mission of the Project. Despite this, in early 1916 they were able to establish that Fae activity was concentrated around the Częstochowa region. During the search for the Free Port, [[[SCP-5292]]][[footnote]] A vast underground non-Euclidean library containing approximately 3,000,000 books (SCP-5292-1) written in many ancient languages and containing pictorial representations of various anomalous phenomena, objects, and entities; the library is guarded by SCP-5292-2, an ethereal humanoid entity that is its //genius loci//, claiming to be the brother of the biblical Noah. [[/footnote]] (then designated as PL-X0R38/0124) was accidentally discovered, around which the Provisional Site-120 has been established. That same year, a group of Fae terrorists known as GoI-120 (\"Triumviraté\") attacked it, causing some damage to SCP-5292 and killing Project Director Hannah Rivera.\n\nRaia Micheals, formerly head of the Department of Science and a specialist in Theology, was chosen to lead the Project after Hannah's death. Also in May of that year, at Raia's request, Site-120 became an official facility,[[footnote]] It is noteworthy that this was the first official permanent facility of the Foundation in Poland.[[/footnote]] where the Command of the Polish Containment Project was located. In the following years, the Foundation focused on monitoring Esterberg and made several unsuccessful attempts to seize and secure it.\n\n+++ 1919-1938\n\nAfter the end of World War I and the establishment of an independent Polish state, the goals of the Project significantly expanded. At that time, it began to function as an agency of the Foundation dealing with anomalies in the Republic of Poland. It was during this period that the Project grew to its largest size in terms of staff and anomalies under its jurisdiction. The Foundation also abandoned its attempts to secure/acquire Esterberg due to the laws protecting anomalous Free Ports established by the League of Nations in 1923, but despite this, there have been several incidents involving their violation by the Foundation.\n\nDuring those years, the Project also encountered many anomalous organizations whose activity was greatly increased by the zenith of the so-called Paranormal Renaissance already underway since the end of the Sixth Occult War, the more important of which are listed below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Major Groups of Interest Active in Poland at the Time\" hide=\"▼ Major Groups of Interest Active in Poland at the Time\"]]\n\n> **Chopinian Cult:** A religious and artistic cult praising Frederic Chopin founded by [[[http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/do-elwiry|Antoni Bukowski]]] (1897-1940) w 19██. The main goal of the cult is to \"Continue the work of the great composer\".\n> \n> **Relations:** ##grey|Neutral##\n\n> **The Polish Ministry of Occult Affairs:** An organ of the government of the Second Republic of Poland dealing with occult, esoteric and anomalous matters. The Foundation and the MOA often worked together, as the goals of both organizations were similar. There were, however, incidents associated mainly with the Foundation's violation of the Anomalous Freeport Protection Act of 1923.\n> \n> **Relations:** ##green|Friendly##\n\n> **Polish Anomalous Mushroompicking Association (PZGA):** A group of enthusiasts dedicated to collecting, researching, and trading anomalous fungi. The origins of the organization date back to the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n> \n> **Relations:** ##grey|Neutral##\n\n> **Triumviraté:** A group of Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) terrorists seeking to reclaim human territories for their species.

They likely possess a large arsenal of advanced paratechnological weapons.\n> \n> **Relations:** ##red|Hostile##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nBeginning in 1933, the Foundation initiated the evacuation of most of its European assets, including those of the Polish Containment Project, to America and other safer locations due to the possibility of another global conflict in Europe following Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany. On the eve of the outbreak of war, only administrative, security, and maintenance personnel from the Polish Containment Project remained in Poland.\n\n+++ 1939-1945\n\nThe Foundation officially remained neutral during the Second World War/VII Occult War until 1944, but in spite of this, the then overhead section of Site-120 and many other Project facilities were destroyed by bombing. In September 1944, the Foundation officially joined the War on the side of the Allies when Konrad Weiss, head of Obskurakorps research, was arrested and the AOI and the Foundation learned that Obskurakorps was planning to perform a powerful occult ritual known as the \"[[[scp-3457|Rite of Solomon]]]\". The Foundation, together with the AOI, succeeded in stopping its execution in Operation Aeon Dawn in January 1945. The remnants of the Project remaining in Poland during this period began to assist the Polish Underground State, which after the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-399|defeat of the Warsaw Uprising]]] moved its capital to Częstochowa and used Esterberg as its base.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that during these years, the previously mentioned Polish Ministry of Occult Affairs mostly emigrated to Three Portlands[[footnote]] An anomalous enclave located in a pocket dimension, connected to the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and the cities of Portland, Oregon and Portland, Maine located in the United States. [[/footnote]] where its members helped co-found the AOI. They also contributed significantly to the Allied victory in 1943 during the Battle of Three Portlands against Obskuracorps commando forces. The attack occurred in order to sabotage the supply route between the U.S. and Great Britain, in which the Portlands played a significant role.\n\nThe project was finally dissolved and absorbed into the structures of the Foundation in November 1945 several months after the end of World War II, also known as the VII Occult War. Negotiations with the emerging government of the Polish People's Republic also began at that time in order to arrange a comfortable position for the Foundation in postwar Poland.\n\n------\n\n++ Dissolution and further activities of the Foundation in Poland\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-120/120.png|align=right|caption=Current logo of Site-120|width=100px]]\n\nThe Polish Containment Project was officially dissolved and absorbed into the standard structures of the Foundation on October 21, 1945 by a unanimous decision of the Overwatch Command. The Foundation also began negotiations with the newly formed government of the People's Republic of Poland, which guaranteed the Foundation a well-placed position in future years. Despite this, the Foundation's activity was to some extent diminished by the activities of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest#gru-division-p GRU Division \"P\"] or Poland's ZM \"Witch Slayer\" Division, however, the situation was much better there than in other Warsaw Pact countries such as East Germany or Czechoslovakia.\n\nInitially, Esterberg was inclined to cooperate with the new communist government, which guaranteed the city a great deal of independence from the latter. The Polish People's Republic officially called Esterberg \"Tysiąclecie Górne\"; this name is still used to some extent today. These relations, however, deteriorated significantly in the 1950s.\n\nThe former Director of the Polish Containment Project (who was also the Director of Site-120), Raia Micheals, eventually died in 1959, being replaced by Site-120 Director MacCarthy,[[footnote]]who, upon his death in 1984, was replaced by the Board of Directors still in place today. [[/footnote]] who had previously been Assistant Director, as well as the head of the Tactical Operations Command during the last years of the Project's existence. Site-120 continues to serve as the main base of operations for the Foundation's activities in the Republic of Poland.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n| [[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives]]] |\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Image source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Henry_Solomon_Wellcome_and_others_at_the_award_of_the_Go_Wellcome_V0027783.jpg\n> **Author:** Wellcome Library, London\n> **Image name:** Sir Henry Solomon Wellcome and others at the award of the Go\n> **License:** CC-BY-4.0\n \n> **Image source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abraham_Sulzbach.jpg\n> **Author:** Otto van Bosch\n> **Image name:** Picture of Abraham Sulzbach\n> **License:** CC-BY-3.0\n\n> **Image source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120\n> **Author:** [[*user Azamo]] and [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **Image name:** 120.png\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA-3.0\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
