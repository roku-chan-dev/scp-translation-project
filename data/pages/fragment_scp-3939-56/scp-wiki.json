A researcher is to be assigned to classify it as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** None yet available.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\n> **To:** Site Director (Site-39)\n> \n> **From:** Researcher ████ ████████\n> \n> Amanda,\n> \n> I've just checked the original correspondence. It's absolutely SCP-3939 that I've been assigned to. Both O5-3 and O5-9 have confirmed this over the course of several emails in the past week. There's no doubt that there's an SCP-3939 in pre-containment at Site-39 — or at least, the O5s have good reason to think so.\n> \n> I'd much appreciate it if you could take another look to see if you can find anything. I can cc O5-3 and O5-9 if needed.\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> Researcher ████ ████████\n\nYou feel a bit shitty for name dropping the O5s — even though everything you've said is true. Maybe you should have just lied and said you made a mistake. Your risk pays off, though — it works. You get a response after no more than two minutes.\n\n> **To:** Researcher ████ ████████\n> \n> **From:** Site Director (Site-39)\n> \n> ████,\n> \n> No need to get the O5s involved — I'll look into this immediately.\n> \n> It's unreasonable to expect you to make any headway on this without information. I'd suggest you go home, get a good night's sleep, and make a strong start on this with information that I find today rather than a weak one now.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> \n> Site Director Amanda Salisbury\n\nOverall, this is a good result. The best solution now would be to wait for more information. Make a strong start, as she puts it.\n\nOn the other hand, there's nothing wrong with a weak start which becomes a strong not-start tomorrow. You still have time today — why waste it?\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/19 Strong start — time to go home.]\n\n[/scp-3939/offset/9 Weak start — start making headway on this without her help.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
