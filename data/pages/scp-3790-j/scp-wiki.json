Once a day, this guard is to enter SCP-3790-J and maintain all contained entities, with orders to terminate any entity approaching the door.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3790-J is the Colonial Shopping Plaza PetSmart in Miami, Florida, now abandoned. It is accessible through the large automatic doors at the front of the store[[footnote]] Research regarding how to disable these doors is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. A paper sign is taped to the inside of the door, reading \"SEALED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF --HEALTH-- ABNORMALITIES\".\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"The remainder of this file has been locked by O5 order.\" hide=\"Lock Overriden\"]]\n[[<]]\nThe interior of SCP-3790-J is structured similar to a standard PetSmart[[footnote]] A comparison to a truly baseline PetSmart is impossible due to the latent anomalous properties of all PetSmarts. [[/footnote]]. The store is divided into several aisles and walkways, with four checkouts at the front. Only one of these checkouts is open at a time; it is unclear whether this is also an anomalous effect.\n\nThe vast majority of SCP-3790-J is empty, excluding four aisles near the back of the store. Each of these aisles contains four animal habitats, excluding Aisle Four. Each habitat contains an entity, is marked with a phrase written in Sharpie permanent marker, and has all openings sealed shut.\n\n**Addendum 3790J.1:** Chamber Contents\n\n//**Aisle One: Common Pets**//\n> **Habitat One**\n> **Marking:** \"This feels like the obvious solution...\"\n> **Description:** A small glass tank containing a concrete figurine. The tank also contains a large amount of brown waste, which appears to be piling out of a makeshift litterbox. The figurine is unmoving.\n\n> **Habitat Two**\n> **Marking:** \"Will try to sell you 'cures', just say no\"\n> **Description:** A large glass tank containing a common mallard, wearing a porcelain mask fitted to its bill. The habitat also contains several surgical implements, which the duck uses to threaten personnel while quacking.\n\n> **Habitat Three**\n> **Marking:** \"He has self-esteem issues\"\n> **Description:** A small wooden crate, nailed shut on all sides. A soft sobbing can be heard from inside.\n\n> **Habitat Four**\n> **Marking:** \"Must be antimemetic or something\"\n> **Description:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-055 Reptile tank, contains a common chameleon.]\n\n//**Aisle Two: Aquatic**//\n> **Habitat One**\n> **Marking:** \"So that's why you can't touch it anymore\"\n> **Habitat:** A dry fishtank containing a small shark. The shark swims around in the empty air, and has several bruises on its snout.\n\n> **Habitat Two**\n> **Marking:** \"Don't forget to feed the eel this time!\"\n> **Description:** A large fishbowl. No personnel could recall the contents of this habitat.\n\n> **Habitat Three**\n> **Marking:** \"pretty big tank for a sea slug\"\n> **Description:** A massive glass fishtank containing the bloated corpse of an adult male, dressed in 18th century formalwear.\n\n> **Habitat Four**\n> **Marking:** \"Mrs. Fish\"\n> **Description:** A small fishbowl containing a VHS tape of Disney's //The Little Mermaid//.
