[[/footnote]] and stored in Locker-811, located in Sub-Level 73C in Site-198. \n\nD-Class personnel, janitors, and dehydrated individuals are not allowed to enter Locker-811 under any circumstances. All personnel are additionally advised that they are not to drink SCP-273-J under any circumstances, including the circumstances in which they are dehydrated, thirsty, or have spent more than 2-3 days in a desert environment without replenishing their personal drink supplies.\n\n**Description:** SCP-273-J refers to a series of canned fruit juices sold under the name 'Freezies'. A can of SCP-273-J is marked with the brand name 'Freezies', accompanied by the sentence, 'It's Freezingly Good!', on the side of the can. SCP-273-J is sold in several different flavours[[footnote]] Different flavours do not seem related to different effects on humans.[[/footnote]] : Apple, Orange, Pear, Peach, and Mango. No manufacturer's logo or name can be seen on the can itself.\n\nOnce a can of SCP-273-J is consumed by a human, SCP-273-J will drastically lower the temperature of the individual's body parts and organs to one below -1 degrees Celsius in a span of about an hour, slowing all body parts and organs to an almost-complete standstill and achieving an effect similar to the effects of cryogenic freezing. However, the human still exhibits signs of life, which include a slow, rhythmic beating of the heart, slight movements in the facial region, and attempts to communicate while speaking around a frozen tongue.\n\nOn May 15, 20██, at approximately 1545 hours, D-6745 (designated SCP-273-J-1) was in the process of transporting a carton of SCP-273-J to Locker-811 when he reportedly 'felt thirsty'. After he noted that there were no other available ways for him to quench his thirst, D-6745 consumed a can of peach-flavoured SCP-273-J. By 1615 hours, D-6745 had experienced the full effects of SCP-273-J, and had become frozen in place in Sub-Level 20B in Site-198.\n\nResearchers assigned to SCP-273-J attempted to interview D-6745 a few hours after he was frozen, only to obtain information described by the researchers as 'pure nonsense'. Following the conclusion of the interview, D-6745 proceeded to be subjected to experimentation attempting to reverse the effects of SCP-273-J. (See Addendum 273-A)\n\n-----\n> **Interview Log 1:**\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Doctor Reese Martens, head researcher of SCP-273-J\n> **Interviewed:** D-6745 (Charlie Blackwell), also known as SCP-273-J-1\n> **Date:** May 16, 20██, 1443 hours\n> **Venue:** Between the break room and the bathrooms, Sub-Level 20B, Site-198\n> \n> **Note:** //All dialogue from the interviewed subject has been roughly translated to English.//\n> \n> //RM:// Can you hear me, SCP-273-J-1?
