Every instance also wears identical collars bearing the word \"Billy's\" in a child's handwriting. All seven instances are perpetually wet, and staff interacting with them are encouraged to bring towels to dry themselves. All attempts to harm SCP-4928 have failed. \n\nSCP-4928-1 was a persistent auditory anomaly within SCP-4928's discovery site: A child's voice, crying out for his mother, repeated every thirty seconds prior to being sealed. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-4928-1 Transcript\" hide=\"- Hide Transcript\"]]\n\n> <**Begin Looped Message**>\n> \n> **Voice:** Johnny? Johnny! Let me out. I didn’t mean to take it. Please? Please, let me out. Please let them out. They never hurt nobody, promise. They've never done a bad thing before. Momma? Momma... //[splashing noises] [pause]// I wish they'd make it out... \n> \n> <**End Looped Message**>\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-4928 was discovered at the bottom of a well on the Hollingson Farm in rural Vermont inside of a burlap sack, as well as the skeleton of a 12-year-old boy, later identified as William Elliot. Elliot was reported missing on the night of October 31st, 1960, after his treehouse was found ransacked. A switchblade belonging to one Jonathan Regis, a local fourteen-year-old named as a suspect in the disappearance by local police, was discovered in a cookie tin within the treehouse’s wreckage. No other anomalous properties were observed within the well.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4927]]] | SCP-4928 | [[[SCP-4929]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
