I just //know// he’s gonna disband us. I’ll probably end up working a fucking //desk job//.”\n\nDr. Wynne, carrying a tray of food, came over and sat down at their cafeteria table.\n\n“This //fucking// place,” she spat. “They just told us they’re gonna be transferring half the staff in our department to other Sites. Said they’re trying to ‘trim the fat’. I swear, I'm in the wrong business. I bet GOC scientists don't have to put up with this kind of shit.\"\n\nDr. Bergstrom shook his head. “Yeah, working for the Foundation really isn’t what it used to be. Did I tell you they even took away our entire D-class allowance? We’re having to test anomalies on //animals// now!”\n\n“Same here,” Agent Rourke said. “We used to get ‘em for use in high-risk explorations, but then they just stopped sending them over.”\n\nDr. Wynne nodded. “Us too.

They're saying we’re gonna have to make do without D-class from now on.”\n\n“Huh,” Dr. Bergstrom said, frowning. “I wonder what //that’s// about.”\n\n“Who knows?” Agent Rourke said with a shrug.\n\nFor a while the three of them ate in silence.\n\n\"Well, at least meat's back on the menu,\" Dr. Bergstrom said at last.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
