You may believe this transfer is in error, but I can assure you it is not. Your case record is exemplary: you show out-of-the-box thinking, no strict overreliance on logic, and a desire to understand what is not easily understood; qualities that would make you feel right at home here in the UIU.\n\nThe agents of the Unusual Incidents Unit are dedicated to protecting the American people from any paranormal threats but solving the cases that nobody can solve. Our agents embody the 'unity in understanding' the unusual. We take pride in our reputation, efficiency, and methodology. Unfortunately this is a pride we cannot share with the greater public at this time.\n\nDuring your tenure here you may come across any manner of the extraordinary. Sometimes we keep tabs on extraordinary people, too. Your understanding of 'reality' as you know it, Agent, is about to change. Don't worry about it; we all went through it too. You'll make it out just fine.\n\nReport to my office as soon as possible so we can get you properly situated and get you read up on some casefiles.\n\nSIGNED/ Brad Atwater\nDeputy Director, FBI UIU\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab E-Mail Correspondence]]\n[[=]]\nA pair of emails sent between FBI UIU LAX SAC Jim Briggs and UIU Deputy Director Brad Atwater.\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"windows-bar\"]]\nDEPARTMENT E-MAIL\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"windows\"]]\n__F__ile@@    @@__I__nbox@@    @@__N__ew Mail\n-----\n**FROM:** [[span class=\"windows-slimbox\"]]Jim Briggs <j.briggs023@fbi.gov>[[/span]]\n**TO:** Brad Atwater <@@b.atwater@fbi.gov@@>\n[[span class=\"windows-slimbox\"]]RE - New Department Wing[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"windows-box\"]]\nBrad;\nI can't thank you enough for the extension to the field office.

We haven't had too much trouble; you read the reports, so you already know about our increase in satisfactorily investigated cases from 78% to 84%. Some of the new agents are promising. With their help and of course, the new wing, we should be on-track to finish above our projected quota of 82.5%. \n@@ @@\nAgain, major thanks, and let me know when you're in town.

Overall, a very clear reference to the eponymous X-Files of the show with the same name. However, the popular interpretations of the UIU have changed along with the site's own evolution as well, resulting in a very wide range for authors to experiment with.\n\nAlmost more than a decade ago, the premiere view of the UIU was an underfunded unit of wannabe Foundation cops -- where the moniker of \"UIUseless\" stems from. They were positioned narratively as the counterexample to the budget and competency of the Foundation in order to help justify the Foundation's existence in the name of safety through 'normalcy', both in-universe and to the prospective readers of these stories. In essence, a stereotypical punching bag in the same vein as early characterization of the CI as \"generic bad guys\". These stories often feel like wild flanderizations of the weaker X-Files episodes.\n\nVery soon in the site's history, other authors realized the otherwise untapped potential of a Group of Interest so uniquely positioned. This was still a time where the GOI and the wiki as a whole had a strong adherence to the background info and popular lore set out for it. Thus, a middle position was born; not fully shedding its \"UIUseless\" name (now relegated to an insult in these works, despite their accuracy or not) but also taking on the responsibility of the determined-but-underequipped underdog in this era. Some of these works focused on the personalities and the little men within these organizations, but also framed them from Foundation-centric views as oddballs. These tend to draw more accurately from the X-Files.\n\nAs the changing standards of the wiki continue on, the early series interpretations petered out in favor of more nuanced takes of the GOI -- some even almost entirely shedding any connection to the 'UIUseless' moniker. Modern interpretations of the UIU tend to highlight their general competency for their size and budget, even perhaps over highlighting these traits as a direct result of age-old stereotypes that still persist around the GOI. These stories may even slip into Men in Black's portrayal of a similar group, ditching the underdog feeling completely. Despite this, the wiki's rather recent acceptance of author freedoms in support of remixing concepts and lore also has given birth to a bevy of unique mixes of all eras of the UIU in new stories.\n\nPersonally, the UIU is best used narratively as a unique perspective on the anomalous world of the SCP Foundation wiki, and almost even a perfect stand-in for potential readers. Agents of the UIU by nature are aware of the anomalous, but may not be fully aware of all the nuances and knowledge of the world or of anomalies in general. They may not even be aware of Foundation internal procedures. As a newer reader, all of these traits may serve as similarities that helps them connect with a UIU Agent over a Foundation researcher -- the same feelings that make Agent Fox Mulder or Agent Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks) relatable as average Joe characters despite their completely unique circumstances and experiences.\n\nOf course, there is no canon, so you may do with the UIU as you wish! I just hope these words helped you potentially recontextualize your use of the UIU as an author, and maybe to avoid now-dirisive portrayals of the UIU as \"UIUseless\". Good luck!\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Standard Casefile Formatting]]\n\nThis is the basic template for the UIU GOI Format.
