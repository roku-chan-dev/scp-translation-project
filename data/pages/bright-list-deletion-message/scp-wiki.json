  "title": "Bright's List Deletion Message",
  "content": "> You have been redirected here from the page that used to be \"The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation\".\n\nThrough [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15744304/voting-what-to-do-with-bright-s-list a community and staff vote] followed by further discussion, it was decided to delete \"The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation\" and replace it with this message. If you wish for more information about the deletion and events surrounding it, please see the timeline below.\n\n+ An Apology\n\n> \"The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation\" is a totem for many failures and shortcomings by us as staff; many of these were systemic and certainly some were caused by an abuse of power, but the simple majority of these failures were caused by a lack of wanting to tackle a difficult issue and to tackle it correctly. We regret that this has happened, and we acknowledge that it is our responsibility to make this right. \n> \n> Volunteering as a staff member in any sizable organization can be overwhelming. There are many rules and enshrined ways of doing things, and they can seem set in stone. This causes many to be overwhelmed by the option of affecting change and often leads to inaction. We believe that this is what happened here. Most, if not all, members of staff wanted to act on the original Anti-Harassment Team (AHT) ban of [[*user AdminBright]] and many wanted to censor or remove the list; they simply felt that they didn't have an option to do so. This is not an excuse but an explanation. We shouldn't allow these issues to cause this sort of harm in the future.\n> \n> As staff, we must work to mend this situation. Hopefully, the open, democratic process of deleting The List and replacing it here with this message can be the first small step of many. Going forward, we must provide a clear path towards the removal of harmful works - not at staff discretion but at the community's discretion, we must provide staff with a culture where we are not paralyzed by this type of inaction, we must be more responsive to the community's needs, and we must remove abusive individuals from the community. As staff we will work towards these ideals and seek to improve upon ourselves as a body in order to prevent these kinds of mistakes and shortcomings from happening again.\n> \n> We don't ask here for any forgiveness; we've let you down, and it's up to us to earn back trust. A community needs not forgive its governing body, just to hold it accountable. We're all trying to do better - individually and as a whole. Please hold us to this.\n>\n> - SCP Site Staff\n\n+ Timeline and Context\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Show Timeline and Context\" hide=\"-Hide Timeline and Context\"]]\n\nThis Timeline is not, and does not seek to be, a complete timeline of all events associated with The List or [[*user AdminBright]]. It would not be possible to create a truly exhaustive accounting of events and doing so would invite inaccuracy and editorialization. This is instead intended to provide a broad understanding of events.\n\n**2008 to 2009** - [[*user AdminBright]] was a founding member of the SCP wiki and served as an Administrator of the site for the majority of their membership. \n\n**December 2008** - \"The Things Dr Bright Is Not Allowed To Do At The Foundation\" (hereafter referred to as The List) is posted. The List is a page that features the character Dr. Bright, who is the in-universe avatar of [[*user AdminBright]].

[[*user AdminBright]] served as one of the Administrator Contacts for the Anti-Harassment Team from its inception until their retirement. They also served on the Disciplinary team in various roles from its inception - once as an Interim Captain.

It was discussed at least twice in the staff Discord whether these should also be removed by AHT, but the entries were not. \n\nDiary-573 was brought up in conversation in the staff Discord. It was deleted [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15081594/deletions-78:undercurrents-pull-at-your-heart#post-5684566 \"due to themes of pedophilia and child sexual abuse by an AHT-banned user\"] under the previously enacted May 2022 Admin Fiat.\n\n**December 2022** - [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/adult-content-warning-guide MAST's Adult Content Curation Team] added an adult splash page to The List to provide a warning of this content.\n\n**February 2023** - No further actions were taken on the part of staff to attempt to remove or further censor The List until The List was [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-15668716/statement-regarding-the-deletion-of-the-list improperly deleted by a retiring Moderator.] Following this, The List was restored but put in a Protected status as an emergency measure due to the improper deletion. At the time of deletion, The List had a positive rating somewhere between +1800 and +2000 depending on the source.\n\nThere was, and had historically been, a strong push from the community to remove or further censor The List. This was a sentiment shared amongst many members of staff. These calls for either removal or censorship increased drastically after the improper deletion, because of this a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15678520/discussion-bright-s-list thread was posted to discuss potential solutions.] \n\n**March 2023** - Many possible solutions were put forward, but they were narrowed down and discussed in a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15708072/discussion-bright-s-list-part-ii second thread].\n\nAfter discussion, it was determined that three options led.
