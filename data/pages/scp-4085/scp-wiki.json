All civilian roads leading to or passing by Site-90 have been redirected.\n\nNo unauthorized personnel are allowed to go within a 100-meter radius of SCP-4085 without authorization from the Director of Site-90. Personnel who disobey this guideline are ineligible for benefits from the Foundation Injury and Death Relief Program. \n\n\n**Description:** SCP-4085 is a partially subterranean building branded as \"Shaggy's House\". It has the shape of a semi-circle with its outermost points from the center—the entrance— converging back into it to form two spheres beside it. Its surface level is 3,000 square meters but when utilizing thaumatic energized  GPR[[footnote]] Ground Penetrating Radar [[/footnote]] technology, its expansion was discovered and found to reach a length of 8,000 meters before GPR signals were blocked by an abundance of Abaddon Energy[[footnote]] Energy originating from an extra-dimensional space that is inhabited by creatures partially composed of it. The energy is volatile and could lead to space influxes between dimensions to the rapid change of organic matter.[[/footnote]]. \n\n\n\n\nThe interior of SCP-4085 has a layout of a grocery store that is furnished with lavish materials such as gold and rare mineral. Its inventory is stocked with SCP-4085-1 instances. SCP-4085-1 instances are advertised as edibles and come in the form of meats in the shape of human organs and limbs, packaged processed foods that resemble human extremities, produce with faces with wide mouths, as well as spices, oils, and beverages that when consumed by human subjects induce paranoia, agitation, sadness, and dread. SCP-4085-1 instances can only be purchased with conceptual goods[[footnote]] Tests have found that items that have significant emotional value to the subject qualified for this categorization.[[/footnote]] or pure gold.  \n\nSCP-4085-A is the designation for the entities that exist inside SCP-4085. They are 3-meter tall humanoids with orange-tinted skin and elongated fingers that average 30 cm in length. Instances of SCP-4085-A have eyes with black pupils, and mouths that have been observed to widen to 25 cm, showing elongated teeth similar to //Melanocetus johnsonii// [[footnote]]Humpback anglerfish[[/footnote]]. They are dressed in identical uniforms with the \"Shaggy's House\" logo on them and exhibit expected behaviors of a human grocery store employee, including staffing the checkout counters, organizing the shelves, and maintaining the store. They are unable or unwilling to speak and will typically ignore human subjects except when they are checking out items or attempting to steal them. \n\n\nAttempts to exit with these items without paying would result in SCP-4085-A instances physically assaulting and eviscerating the subject(s), mainly using their teeth. SCP-4085 instances will then take the subject(s) through a door in the back of SCP-4085 and begin cleaning the area where they were terminated.  All attempts to enter this door were halted by SCP-4085-A instances.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum.SCP-4085 Contact\" hide=\"— Addendum.SCP-4085 Contact\"]]\n\n\n\nOn October 25th, 1992, for the first recorded time since SCP-4085's discovery, an SCP-4085-A instance exited from SCP-4085 with a piece of paper in its hand. After it was placed on the ground, it returned to SCP-4085. The contents of it read:\n\n> \n> \n> Salutations, Foundation\n> \n> This message is on behalf of the owners and curators of this establishment you are currently infringing upon. Your presence here has been unexpected and worrying but it might prove to be a great opportunity for both of us. We have a vision of a deal occurring between us. \n> \n> We request an audience with you to discuss more of this. If you agree, then burn this message and wait for us at midnight tonight. We hope you accept.\n> \n> \n> \n> //~ Shaggy's House Incorporated.//\n> \n\n\n\nThe Foundation followed the instructions detailed in the paper and waited for the unknown entities to emerge. When midnight occurred, twenty SCP-4085-A instances circling eight Tartarean[[footnote]] An extra-dimensional organism that is mostly composed of Abaddon energy and originates from the space that generates it. Their phenotype varies between individuals and normally possess anomalous capabilities consisting of abnormal durability, size, strength, and low-level elemental thaumatics. These entities are also colloquially referred to as Demons.[[/footnote]] entities, designated from T-Entity 1-8[[footnote]] T-Entity 5 carried a suitcase composed of iron that contained documents and a mechanism pertaining to SCP-4085.[[/footnote]], which possessed amphibian and mammalian characteristics and were dressed in tattered clothes with several symbols sewn in them, exited out of SCP-4085.  They were then intercepted by Foundation forces where the SCP-4085-A instances but one were terminated and the T-Entities were captured and contained inside Standard Omega Tartarean seals. Shortly after, they were interrogated by Site-90 Director Kellogg. \n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Director Kellogg\n\n**Interviewed:** T-Entity 5\n\n**Foreword:**  The entity was bound in a seal and placed inside a reinforced glass encasing that inhibited excessive movement while and was surrounded by guards for Director Kellogg's safety. TE-5 were chosen to be questioned due to other entities claiming that they were the leader. \n\n---------------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Kellogg:** Good night or evening. It seems you're the lucky one I get to talk to. So, this deal, what does it entail?  \n\n**TE-5:** I was going to tell you all that before you attacked us from the sky! Don't you know how hard it was to convince the others to even come out and meet you? And where is my case? This could set us back to zero on negotiations.\n\n\n**Kellogg:** Negotiations? Right now, you should be focusing on why I shouldn't send you and your friends back to where you came from. Be quick though, it's late.\n\n**TE-5:** Alright, alright! We came to give you an opportunity of becoming an investor in our store. Things are a bit slow on our side but with you in the picture, our profits could increase tenfold. Of course, you will be getting cut of the profits. I'll say 3 to 5 percent seems more than—\n\n**Kellogg:** Stop. Did you really come to us to offer us royalties? That's—We don't need your money, and I'm sure if you have some you wouldn't need us. Now, I'm going to give you two options: pack up and go home willingly or we can do it the old and painful way. \n\n**TE-5:**  Wait a minute, there are other things we are offering! Greater things than you can't even imagine. Don't you think it a bit odd that are we even here, or wondering where our products even come from?\n\n**Kellogg:** You'll trade information? \n\n\n**TE-5:** If it means a deal, then yes. The others might protest about me telling you this—but it doesn't matter now.\n\n**Kellogg:** I'm listening.\n\n\n**TE-5:** Alright, alright. We have made great leaps in a new branch of science. \n\n**Kellogg:** Science?\n\n\n**TE-5:** Yes, just listen. Currently, as it is now, our kind is forced to make pacts and binds and contracts with this world to enter and interact with it. Our natural energy requires an anchor to be in this world without us being ripped in two. However, however, what if something, not of this world but still able to go in it is able to act as our anchor by utilizing our world and bodies energy without any of those things? \n\nMeaning we will be able to exist freely in our world without restriction. But that's not at all. The souls— the most delicious part of man's existence— also require preparation to obtain. But what about the ones forgotten and unable to pass on? We can skip the process with the device and pluck them right out of the air. And don't get me started on how it streamlines the infusion process. You can stretch a soul if you know what you're doing. Oh, sorry, no disrespect to the living of course.\n\n**Kellogg:** Infusion? What do you mean by this?\n\n**TE-5:** A little boiling there, whipping here, just the whole 24/7 torture thing, you know. Sorry, again, no hard feelings towards you guys, of course. But it just doesn't taste half as good without some misery. We all got needs, you know?\n\n**Kellogg:** Right. And you are the only ones doing this?\n\n\n**TE-5:** Oh hardly. But we are the ones who have gotten this far. The other sects think science is the way of humans and nothing else, not realizing we can combine our own knowledge with theirs to even achieve higher levels of power. Trust me, we might be the first, but we won't be the last. You are standing on top of a new revolution! Our science, Demon science, is the future of our kind.\n\n\n**Kellogg:** Fascinating, can you show us how to build this machine?\n\n\n**TE-5:** No, no, I can't divulge that. Our science is new and still comes with its own restrictions.\n\n**Kellogg:** You just said you broke free from those restrictions.\n\n**TE-5:** That only pertains when interacting with this world, and that's only to a certain extent. We still have to live under our own laws. But don't worry about that. I still haven't even started on the market for human edibles. Did you know six out of—\n\n**Kellogg:** I am afraid I don't care for all of that. For someone smart, you aren't keen on your surroundings. Your friends and allies are with us, so what is stopping me right from ordering a squad to get rid of that store and you while we are it?\n\n**TE-5:** You'll, you'll gain nothing! We might not be able to show you how to build it, but we can certainly do other things. Money! Information! And who is to say that we are the only ones operating this store? Who's to say they are not others waiting to unleash mayhem if things here go bad?\n\n**Kellogg:** But you're the leader and we have your documents.\n\n**TE-5:** …Okay?\n\n**Kellogg:** We can just take them out right now and clean this up before they even get the idea.\n\n**TE-5:** Wait a minute! I mean they won't attack immediately, especially if I'm here. He-he, I am an important figure with them, after all. Keeping me alive would be best for them and you.\n\n**Kellogg:** Oh, then that changes everything. You are valuable.\n\n**TE-5:** Now you're seeing the big—\n\n**Kellogg:** As leverage.\n\n**TE-5:** Fu—\n\n\n  \n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum.SCP-4085 Deliberations\" hide=\" — Addendum.SCP-4085 Deliberations\"]]\n\n\n\n\nShortly after contact was established, Director Kellogg requested aid from the Occult Legal Firm.[[footnote]] A group formed with the assistance of the Global Occult Coalition that deals with legal occult terrestrial and extra-dimensional legal matters. Mostly consisting of temps from other departments due to their lack of need in daily operations. [[/footnote]] Forest Ceaser was then deployed to assess the documents recovered from the Tartetean Entities. Below is his statement on the subject:\n> \n> Dealing with contracts is tricky. Dealing with Demon, Tartarean, or whatever you call them, contracts, are mostly the same. It just so happens that the differences are just so aggravating. Think of Demon contracts as living organisms that have almost omnipotent power over those that have signed them, where violating them in any way can turn you into a frog for the foreseeable future. You can say these \"contracts\" obtain substance by keeping themselves fair and are constantly changing to do just that.\n> \n> \n> This can happen if one party in the contract gains more capital, or power per se, and the contract might deem itself inadequate for the current circumstances and change to benefit the group with the greater assets.\n> \n> However, this change can be negated or halted with numerous methods. The safest and easiest way to do this is to bind it through sacrifice. It can be a life, an item of sentimental value, or even just singing in your blood might do the trick. The point is the bigger the sacrifice, the harder it is for the contract to change without any rule-breaking going on. And given the Foundation's current state, we have a lot to give without giving.\n> \n> \n> After reading this contract this Demon gave, it seems to be mostly fair and adequate for our needs;  but changes can and will be made to further our benefits. Although, after reading the original, I can see why they were so desperate to make a deal with us. They were basically doing all the work for pennies. They must have thought anything would have been better. There also seem to be phrases and sections with some things pertaining to a Perem. It seems to be worded in a way where they are not lying but hiding something. They are withholding, as expected. I'll attach an excerpt of all my findings once I get done via a pigeon.\n> \n> \n> Demon legal logic.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\n \n**___ETHICS COMMITTEE ENVOY:___**\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; background:#F5F5F5; margin: auto; padding: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 90%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++ **DELIVERED BY THE COMMAND OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE**\n\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/CQCcN7e.png width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n\n---------\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of SCP-4085 and its derivatives, additional resources from other departments were required to fully assess this decision (See Below), and after careful deliberations, it has come to our decision that forming a deal or operating SCP-4085 and the formation of SCP-4085-1 instances will not violate any of the Foundation Ethic codes. \n\nThe \"souls\" of humans or Type 2-B Incorporeal entities under current conditions cannot be permanently harmed. When ingested by a Tartarean entity, it is found that the incorporeal entity undergoes a consciousness cleanse and is excreted from their systems shortly after. Although this Incorporeal entity may or not be recycled back into the human sphere, this does not dictate the destruction of the said entity but simply a change in form and does not fall under the Foundation's jurisdiction. \n\nThe Foundation does have an obligation to keep the suffering of these said entities and other accompanying parties at a minimum. Failure to do so would be an insult to those who suffer to maintain our mission and to the lives who perished to form these codes. But, due to the importance of a contract and acquisition of SCP-4085, however, this may be ignored in certain circumstances. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; background:#F5F5F5; margin: auto; padding: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 90%;\"]]\n\n[[size 120%]] **DEPARTMENT OF ENIGMATIC TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND STUDY**[[/size]]\n\n-------\n\nAfter investigating the GPR scans of SCP-4085 and the mechanisms found in TE-5's case, it is believed they have not lied about the technology it spoke of. The abundance of Abbadon energy makes it difficult to fully confirm the space's nature, but it is believed to have a high degree of certainty of originating from and connecting to LoI-04 (\"Netherworld\", \"Limbo\", \"Hell\"). Connecting a structure containing multiple items from LoI-04 this large without major restrictions or backlash from our plane is not possible through normal, esoteric, or primeval means. \n  \n\nAnalysis of the mechanism and the documents pertaining to the technology cited by TE-5 found inside their briefcase reveal it to be a demonstration device capable of small-area Abbadon energy manipulation. When activated, it was able to materialize organisms and minerals only found LoI-04 . We have been unable to replicate it as it is composed of living tissue that emits low levels of thaumatic energy and an unknown metal.\n\n\nIf TE-5 is to be fully believed, which is our advice to do so, then the Tartarean culture is advancing to heights unseen before and if not halted or influenced, could lead to a massive emergence event of Tartarean of several classes within 120 years. It is of our, yours, and the Foundation's interest to obtain as much knowledge of this technology as soon as possible. \n\nIn our projections, the Foundation could gain a greater understanding of Abbadon energy and Tartenerean entities. The ability to harvest souls via Abbadon energy that has not moved from our dimension can also offer a great deposit of information not available to us through conventional means.\n \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n__**TE-5 INTERROGATION LOG-2:**__\n\nAfter more information was received on the legal documents of SCP-4085 from Forest Ceaser and technical aspects with the assistance of several other departments, it was determined that a deal with the creators of SCP-4085 would be a beneficial arrangement for the whole of the Foundation and its goals. Another briefing with TE-5 would be commenced before plans were set in motion to solidify it.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n\n**TE-5:** It's been days! I can't take it anymore. What else do you want from us? \n\n**Kellogg:** Some truthful answers. \n\n**TE-5:** Haven't I given you that?  \n\n\n**Kellogg:** No, in fact, you were lying to us. I have reason to believe that there is another party involved in all of this.\n\n**TE-5:** Wha—Hu—On what basis?\n\n\n**Kellogg:** One, someone with your position would not have enough capital or the intellect to set this up. Two, the documents you were going to give us are filled with contradictions and holes. And three, the others told me. \n\n**TE-5:** They wouldn't dare!\n\n**Kellogg:** Yes, they were quite adamant about being quiet until we gave them a  quick bath. So, tell me already, if you don't want to be baptized too, who is this third party—this Perem. How are we going to make a deal with you if you don't know all the risks involved? \n\n**TE-5:** Fine. Just to let you know I didn't tell you earlier because this guy is a pain, and I didn't want you to be scared off by him. He doesn't listen to reason; he treats us and everyone he meets like they are below him. He thinks just because he has 50% of the store,  funded us, named and designed the brand, and also made the workers, too...that he owns the place!  He doesn't even stay half the time. I bet he doesn't even know where the restroom is.\n\nBut guess what, that was his biggest mistake. Now, we got you guys. And if you just agree, we can cut him out of any real power he has over the store. \n\n**Kellogg:** So you were going to use us as your sword and hammer?\n\n**TE-5:** Yes! Wait, no. When you put it like that...\n\n**Kellogg:** You're really not that smart are you? What type of ido—I'm getting ahead of myself. So, who is this man, and will he be a threat?\n\n**TE-5:** Well, he's just one man. I'm sure with your firepower taking him out will be easy as, well, taking us out.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum.SCP-4085 Interference\" hide=\" — Addendum.SCP-4085 Interference\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2nd, 1992, a letter appeared on Director Kellogg's office desk after a power system failure. The contents of it are below:\n\n\n> Greetings, \n> \n>  I have recently found out while I was away that your organization has tried to disrupt the partnership of my store. I am sure that you did not start this, and that it was the work of some conniving ungrateful buffoons that are not even fit to be culled. I assumed they promised you glory and power if you help them.\n> \n> I have come to tell you that is a lie, and you are being swindled by half-rate demons. However, I can see you have taken a liking to the store and I am not unkind. So, I will be visiting you sometime tomorrow to discuss business.\n> \n> \n> \n> Best regards,\n> \n> //~ Hawkins Zion Perem.//\n> \n\n\nTwelve hours after this message was retrieved, a blue-skinned humanoid male wearing shorts and an unbuttoned palm tree pattern shirt, now designated as PoI-450, appeared on the boundary of Site-90. As PoI-450 attempted to walk inside site's boundaries, he was quickly intercepted and escorted to an interrogation chamber. The interrogation was conducted by Director Kellogg. The transcript is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Director Kellogg\n\n**Interviewee:** PoI-450\n\n-------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay, your men were a bit rough. I also expected a better arrangement for our meeting, but you and I were both on short notice, so I understand. Now, I believe introductions are in due. I am Hawkins Zion Perem, 250th son of the House of Perem, and co-owner of the Shaggy's House. \n \n\n**Kellogg:** Kellogg is fine. So, you are the other investor we were worried about. \n\n**PoI-450:**  An investor? I found them wallowing in their own poverty without anything to their flame. Oh, they're smart, but they're so limited.  They were going to sell off their work as another way to manage already obtain souls. What would be the point of that? \n\nNay. They had just found gold and were going to bury it back in the dirt! But with a push in the right direction, I got things back on track. I am more than just an investor. I am the visionary, the inventor of this whole project. There is nothing without me. \n\n//PoI-450 pulls a rod of metal resembling iron out of his pocket and begins to chew on it//.\n\n**Kellogg:** So you know how to build another one of these devices powering the store?\n\n**PoI-450:** That's for them to do and for me to make sure they don't mess it up. I don't need to know how to make it, I just need to know how to use it. I utilize my time efficiently and don't bother with the useless details someone else can do. You know how it is.\n\n\n**Kellogg:** Ah, I actually do.\n\n\n**PoI-450:** See, you get it. At first, I thought you guys were going to be weird. Nay, your reputation does exceed you. But you and I can come up with something.\n\n**Kellogg:** What do you have in mind?\n\n**PoI-450:** //[Leans forward.]// Those demons try to cut me out of my own contract and I can't let that slide, so here's what I'm thinking. We cut half of them in size, make the other slaves, and obtain all the profit for ourselves. I also know you want a piece of that technology and I can have that arranged to a certain degree. This machine can be used for more than just bargain-bin stores. This whole thing can open the way for new power. Untapped, untamed power. Weapons that can tear space apart is what I'm talking about. \n\n\n**Kellogg:** And what do you have to do with weapons?\n\n**PoI-450:** Don't worry about that, just know my family deal in those waters... Think about it, Kellogg, we can take the prize for ourselves and eat all the ripened fruit without anyone being the wiser.\n\n**Kellogg:** Sounds enticing, but we can't deal with half benefits. We want to know everything about the store in front of the table. Including the technology.\n\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay, don't be so greedy! You just found this place by pure chance. You didn't put any effort into it, you have no stake in this. You might have gotten away with the attitude with the other riffraff. But I am not them and I will not be stolen from. Nay,  I am the 250th son of the House of Perem! Know your place.\n\nI forgive you for what you did earlier as you were lied to. But don't push your luck. \n\n \n**Kellogg:** My apologies, Mr. Perem, I did not expect you to be so much more dignified than the others we captured.\n\n**PoI-450:**  Of course!  Since you know what you're dealing with, we can now discuss real business. \n\n**Kellogg:** Oh, yeah, we can discuss all the terms you want. We're going to have plenty of time.\n\n**PoI-450:** I don't know about that. I got places to go soon, I was on holiday as you can see. So, I would like to get this done quickly.\n\n**Kellogg:** I disagree, your quarters are already reinforced and furnished. Once you're there, I'm sure you won't be going anywhere soon.\n\n**PoI-450:** Ha-ha. Nay, you make it sound like you're going to put me in a cell. \n\n**Kellogg:** I mean I am, but okay.\n\n**PoI-450:** Oh, that's funny. You're a jokester. I have a couple of siblings just like that. \n\n//A group of guards enter the room and begin to surround PoI-450.//\n\n**PoI-450:** Oh.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n__**SCP-4085 Window-Shopper Event**__\n\nOnce PoI-450 was placed inside containment, awaiting further interrogation, they began to vocalize threats towards the Foundation and Director Kellogg. Simultaneously, the Tartarean entities in containment began to become agitated. \n\nTwo hours after containment, a massive group of SCP-4085-A instances rushed out of SCP-4085 and towards the cell of PoI-450, attacking and destroying anything that halted their advancement. Once they made it to PoI-450, they broke him out of his cell and escorted him inside SCP-4085. Shortly after PoI-450 entered it, SCP-4085 began to emit a higher level of Abbadon energy and heat. It then began to start to experience rapid decay with cracks being seen throughout its structure and the area surrounding it. During this event, severe damage was done to Site-90, destroying one-fourth of the facility. Alongside this,  five personnel were injured and two were killed. \n\nAfter the Foundation forces were regrouped and accounted for, TE-5 was questioned about what was occurring inside the store. They claimed that PoI-450 was using the mechanism inside the store to make it leave to another extra-dimensional space. To intercept this, a team was formed to explore SCP-4085.\n\n\n\n**Addendum.SCP-4085 Excursion:**\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n**Team:** MTF Psi-5 (P 1-7), Tartarean Entities 1-8, and Director Kellogg (Intercom communications only).\n\n**Foreword:** Due to the Tartarean entities' familiarity with SCP-4085's interior, it was deemed that they would lead the exploration team.  After failing to comply with these terms, they were threatened with expulsion and termination of any chance of a contract formation with the Foundation.   \n\n\n--------------\n\n//The team is in front of the SCP-4085's back door. The area around them is disarray, with shelves being overturned and the walls being scorched and slashed.//\n\n\n**TE-4:** We can't do this! This is suicide! \n\n**TE-2:**  I knew coming to them was a mistake. They're going to make us fight till we all die.\n\n**TE-5:** Calm down, guys.  We're just got to get through this and we'll be done with all this. We'll get our deal and make it big.\n\n \n**TE-1:** You believe those lies after what they did to us?\n\n**Kellogg:** You better believe those lies. We're doing this on your behalf, so stop complaining. If you had the power to control those workers you wouldn't be in half the trouble. There is a human saying of ours that when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. \n\n**TE-3:** But that is so stupid. If you get lemons, you can just transmute the— \n\n**Kellogg:** Just move. \n\n//As they enter the back door,  a room and hallway down its path are seen. The interior is a mixture of metal and rock. The light source is an orange hue coming through cracks in the wall. A constant, distant screaming can be heard. As they continue and enter the hallway, the interior changes to fully rock.//  \n\n//Ten minutes later, they encounter a dead amphibian Tarterean entity on the ground. \nHoles and bite marks are present throughout its body.//\n\n**TE-2:** That's... That's...\n\n**TE-5:** I know.\n\n**Kellogg:** Who is that?\n\n**TE-5:** A partner. \n\n\n\n**Kellogg:** Make that former. Men, be careful. Carry on.\n\n\n//As the team continues, the left wall begins to show more and more gaps until it is gone. When looking in the distance, an area of lava is seen. Beyond this, on a rock platform, dozens of rows can be seen with Type 2-B Incorporeal entities being tied down on metal platforms and being repeatedly whipped, stabbed, or burned by SCP-4085-A instances. Below them are bowls filled with clear, misty liquid.  The SCP-4085-A instances do not take notice or ignore the team.//\n\n//Several minutes later, they enter a space that has multiple elevators on its walls. There are ten SCP-4085-A instances present that then attacks the team. They lunge after TE-3 and TE-6, which are then terminated by the SCP-4085-A instances by biting a piece of their necks off. As the rest of the Tartarean entities are engaged with the SCP-4085-A instances, Psi-5 falls back and begins to shoot at them from a distance. Killing eight of the SCP-4085-A instances as the other two were terminated previously by the Tartareans.//\n\n**TE-5:** What are you doing?  Two of us are gone! Why didn't you do that sooner? \n\n**Kellogg:** Calm yourself, before you get shot. It was a miscalculation.\n\n**TE-2:** A miscalculation? We told you we couldn't fight! We could have to lead you from up there. Oh...we're all gonna be sent back to Mola-Juda aren't we? \n\n**Kellogg:**  Maybe you start fighting better.\n\n**TE-4:** We are scientists! We cannot fight!\n\n**TE-5:** Guys, guys, calm down.\n\n**TE-2:** Shut up! It's your fault we're in this mess in the first place. Look at you and where your big ideas lead us to. We should have just stayed back home.\n\n\n**TE-5:** Hey! You agreed, didn't you? Don't put all this on me, okay? I did my best!\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay, is this mic loud enough? Eh, it has to do. Hm-hm. See, how you people fight against each other? See how frantic you all are? This is what happens when you do something that your brain isn't meant to do. You had no right, none, to even to have the thought of double-crossing me. I'm going to make sure each and one of you is killed. And then I'm going to have your meat bodies baked and boiled in that order to be eaten.\n\nI am the 250th, the 250! \n\n**TE-2:** Screw you Perem!\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay, yell all you want. And Kellogg, you had an opportunity for greatness, and now you are going to watch it burn. \n\n**Kellogg:** Stop listening to him and tell us which elevator to go down to. He's obviously stalling. \n\n//The team advances to the front elevator while TE-5 presses a combination of buttons.//\n\n\n**TE-5:** This should lead us to where he and the device are at. But, please, try to protect us better. We can't stop what he is doing if we're dead.\n\n\n\n//As the team is brought down by the elevator, a static humming sound gets louder as they descend. When the elevator stops, the door opens revealing a 4-meter silver door with drapes bearing the Shaggy's House logo. Throughout the area are bodies of five Tarterean entities.//\n\n**TE-2:** He killed them all.\n\n**Kellogg:** Is this it?\n\n\n**TE-5:** Yes, it is. \n\n**Kellogg:** Then what's the holdup?\n\n\n**TE-2:** Somethings behind there. \n\n//A small group of SCP-4085-A instances exit from the door and begin to engage the team. They are quickly terminated by Psi-5 before they engage any of the Tartarean entities. However, a few seconds afterward, an explosion occurs near the team that is mostly concentrated in the area of the remaining Tartareans. When the team regroups, TE-7 and TE-4 are found to be terminated.//\n\n**TE-2:** Loo—Loo—Wha!\n\n**TE-5:** Just a little more, just one more push and no more of this.\n\n\n//The team then enters through the door and finds PoI-450 fiddling with an unknown mechanical board fitted with levers and pulleys that are connected to an apparatus composed of pipes and glass-filled tubes filled with bubbling blue liquid. This mechanism spreads throughout the entire room on the walls; steam can be observed coming off it.//\n\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay. So, you made it. You know, I was in a crunch, so didn't have any time to fortify this place. The rejects don't all listen to new commands quickly.  They're all got fish for brains. Literally. But that besides us. Kellogg, you are determined I give you that, so let's say we negotiate again. \n\nWhat about fifty-fifty share? That sounds fair. You have the power and I have everything else. Just calm down and tell your men don't shoot!\n \n\n**Kellogg:** Step away from the controls, Mr. Perem. Negotiations are over. \n\n**PoI-450:** Pity. What about you guys? I know I wasn't the nicest, and I did get rid of your friends back there, but still, that was just business. You know how it is. We can re-negotiate better terms, better salaries. Nay, I worked hard for this, too. And I can be sympathetic towards your causes and...needs. As I always say, it's better to make a deal with some before you destroy their city. Nay, that's from first-hand experience by the way. So you really don't want to burn all bridges down all right?\n\n**TE-2:** You can rot in oblivion! Bathe and rot in it!\n\n**PoI-450:** Come on, don't be childish! Do you think they are going to give you a better deal than me?  Look at them, don't they just make your skin crawl? They're not good for you or anyone!\n\n**Kellogg:** Step away from the controls, Mr. Perem. Last chance. \n\n**PoI-450:** Fine, fine, I concede. I have lost, you have the upper hand. Just one more thing though. I just would like to say a few words of—Ihopeallofyoudieahorribledeath!\n\n\n//PoI-450 begins to interact with the controls of the mechanism while Psi-5 takes aim and shoots him. PoI-450 dodges and tries to run away from the mechanism before Psi-1 takes multiple shots toward him, shooting him in the leg and damaging the mechanism in the process, causing an explosion. As the team is pushed back by this event, the smoke clears, and the machine begins to glow orange. PoI-450 is seen on the floor with half of his body missing and yellow liquid pouring out from his wounds.//\n\n**PoI-450:** Nay, this is bad... real bad. Oh, shit...she's going to kill me. \n\n\n//PoI-450 reaches inside his mouth and pulls out a circular disk. He then breaks it with his finger and is engulfed by a black mass before that too collapses on itself and dissipates. TE-5 then runs towards the machine and begins fiddling with it.//\n\n**TE-2:** Serves you right.\n\n**TE-5:** Forget him, we have the store now!\n\n\n**Kellogg:** Can you stop what's happening?\n\n**TE-5:** Of course, we built it! Guys, come on. \n\n//The Tartereans all begin to work on the machine and make it cease its current functions. Subsequently, the humming noise stops.//\n\n\n**TE-5:** Done.\n\n**Kellogg:** The store is secured?\n\n**TE-2:** Yes! \n\n\n**Kellogg:** Congratulations. I think we can make that deal now.\n\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum.SCP-4085 Acquisition\" hide=\" — Addendum.SCP-4085 Acquisition\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the exploration of SCP-4085, another excursion force was sent inside to begin the termination of the remaining SCP-4085-A instances and capture the unprocessed Type 2-B incorporeal entities. It was deemed that the Tartareans entities of SCP-4085 will overseer the acquisition of new employees and be in charge of the daily operations inside of it. \n\nInspection of the exterior and interior revealed massive damage, particularly to the mechanism, designated as SCP-4085-2. According to TE-5, it would take an extensive amount of resources and finances to repair SCP-4085-2 to operational levels. Due to this, significant changes to the contract were amended to ensure the Foundation's ability to utilize and protect SCP-4085. \n\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**TE-5:** What you're asking of us is to sign ourselves into slavery. We won't have any say at all, we'll be doing all the work!  We won't even be able to profit from our own business in three decades!\n\n\n\n**Kellogg:** You still don't get it, even after I allowed you to get through that store alive. You are no longer in control here. We, or I, as you say, own you. You don't have a say anymore. Well, you still do, you have the option to rebel,  but I don't think you like the consequences of that much. \n\n\n\n**TE-5:** You're asking for too much! I can't. We can't. And I still can't teach how to build the machine either. They are laws in place for a reason. If I break them it will cause our very being to warp and change.  We'll be at the top of the hierarchy. You'll turn us into imps!\n\n\n**Kellogg:** I don't see how that's our problem. We still repairing the store and continuing to fight off those workers that you somehow still cannot control.\n\n**TE-5:** It, it is not our fault! Perem—\n\n**Kellogg:** Everything is your fault. When you work here there is no room for excuses. You do it or you don't. I don't want to hear anything else but results.  \n\nYour job, for the foreseeable future, is to make sure that the store gets back in tip-top condition.  As long as you can do that,  you won't have any problems with me. This is your future.
