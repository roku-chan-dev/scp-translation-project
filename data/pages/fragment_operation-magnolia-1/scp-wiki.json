John’s driving. Paul, George and Ringo are in the back, holding on best they can as every bump and dip in the road threatens to shake their fillings out. If they live to see tomorrow, they’ll give themselves new names.\n\n//Holy Oak Baptist Church. Cooper, Georgia. Population 132.//\n\nGeorge grips his M16 tightly. The amphetamines coursing through his system have brought his thoughts into lockstep focus, dissected the world into constituent atoms, movements, relationships, categories. Time is slowed. His second thoughts are silent. The golden path has shed its seven veils, and all that remains is to follow it to the end. He is motive force embodied; He no longer needs to think.\n\n//DEFAULT ASTERISM congregation confirmed present and growing. High-transmission risk vector present. Containment unfeasible; liquidation required.//\n\nSense impressions weave together into the whole: Deep blue twilight. Singing crickets. Growling engine. Heat. Humidity. Robes flapping in the rush of air. Lightning in the east. Lingering scents of cigarettes, sweat, gasoline. Memories of salt and grease on his lips from the cold quarter-pounder he ate hours ago. Breath rasping against gas mask filters.\n\n//No witnesses.//\n\nJohn bangs his fist on the cabin window twice. Final approach. George peers ahead into the dark; dim orange light ahead, below the barely-visible silhouette of the steeple against the sky. John swerves off the road into the dirt lot.\n\n//No survivors.//\n\nThe truck squeals as John slams on the brakes and drifts into a 180 degree spin. It rocks once and they jump out of the back in their Sunday best, all nice and white. They rush the front as John tears off around the side of the building to cut off the back door.\n\nPaul raises her shotgun and blows the hinges off. Ringo kicks it down. Smoke billows out, shimmering with jale and ulfire. George is first in, brain overclocked with new sensory information. \n\nOrange light deep in the smoke, surrounded by the indistinct forms of worshippers in thrall. Music, somewhere further on, somewhere between a sitar and banjo. A man’s stentorian voice, interrupted. \n\nGeorge opens fire into the congregation, his staccato bursts in harmony with Ringo’s rifle and together joined with the bass boom of Paul’s shotgun.\n\nIt’s a massacre. It couldn’t be anything else. The congregation, so deep in their ecstatic mysteries, reacts as if waking from anesthesia. Most don’t even realize what’s going on before the bullets find them. A few of the more cogent parishioners try to open up the windows they themselves had sealed, or try stumbling towards the rear. They don’t make it.\n\nGeorge reloads.\n\nCasings plink to the floorboards. Smoke swallows the cacophony of barking gunshots and muffled screams and wounded moans.\n\nIn twenty seconds, no one in the congregation is left standing. Those who are not dead are wounded, and those who are not wounded are stunned into stillness. \n\nGeorge is the first to move. He winds through the splintered pews and scattered hymnals and the blood and the bodies, counting the fallen. All of them get a bullet in the head, even the ones that have stopped moving. He feels nothing. He does not hear their cries, their groans, their pleas. He squeezes the trigger – again, again, again – with the cold certainty of a man who decided long ago that this is necessary. Who they were, what their lives had been, what course brought them to this place at this time and this meeting with the unknown – all of that is irrelevant now. They aren’t people any more, just vectors for an infection. All of it ends with the brief punctuation of a 5.56 millimeter bullet.\n\nRingo freezes up, staring off into the middle distance, his breaths ragged and gasping. Paul snaps at him to go out back and help John. With his mind failing him, his body automatically obeys.\n\nPaul watches the front door, keeping eye and ear out for approaching vehicles. Cooper was bumfuck nowhere, but it wasn’t so bumfuck that twenty seconds of sustained small-arms fire from the church down the road wouldn’t have people calling the cops.\n\nGeorge finishes his rounds. Thirty-five dead. Nineteen male, sixteen female. Twenty-one black, fourteen white. Three college degrees. Average age: thirty-eight. Range maximum: eighty-one. Range minimum: five.\n\nRingo returns with John and the cans of gasoline. The four soak the place, drop a burning rag, and sprint out the back door to the waiting truck. John throws it into drive, hits the gas and they vanish into the backroads as angry red-orange fills the night behind them.\n\nSirens, in the distance. Too late.\n\nThey dump the guns in a river about an hour later, and ditch the truck and the costumes in a holler by the Tennessee border a bit before dawn. From there they disperse on foot, each going their own way. George walks twelve miles over to the highway and hitches a ride with a guy trucking cigarettes into Alabama. He checks in to a roadside roach motel under another fake name and makes a phone call from the office to a residential address in Virginia:\n\n“Got everything taken care of at Uncle Avery’s, but the car broke down on the way back. I’ll still be out a few days.”\n\nHe stumbles back to his room and collapses onto the thin, stained mattress.\n\nAs he sleeps through the night and next day, the media reports the facts as they have them: armed members of the Ku Klux Klan, potentially from out of state, attacked Holy Oak Baptist during Wednesday night Bible study, killing 35 and setting the church on fire. There’s no question of motive: Holy Oak was a proudly desegregated congregation, and the Civil Rights Act remains only the letter of the law.\n\nThe manhunt will turn up the truck and the robes Saturday afternoon, but nothing more. The public, distracted by the ever-deepening tangle of Watergate, quickly forgets it ever happened.\n\n> The Foundation had already been playing catch-up against DEFAULT ASTERISM for nearly a decade when the Panopticon Crisis struck. Forced decentralization crippled its wide-scale response capabilities and left the organization, and the world at large, vulnerable to a poorly-understood, highly adaptive, and virulently infectious memeohazard. Without any means of inoculation against the threat and possessing no resources to develop one, the Foundation’s command cells instituted BULLDOG Protocol: a standing policy mandating the total liquidation of any infected persons. \n> \n> Between fifty and eighty[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The exact number is not known due to records loss. If the higher estimates of Epsilon Command activity against Western Fifthist strains B3 and D2 are correct, this number could be as high as 120. This is, however both unlikely and impossible to verify.[[/span]] BULLDOG operations against DEFAULT ASTERISM were carried out between Operation FRATERNIZE in 1971 and Operation GAUGUIN in 1988, with the majority of these carried out by Gamma Command field agents against the Southern Fifthist strain-denomination.\n> \n> The destructive nature of these operations meant that only minimal strategic intelligence regarding DEFAULT ASTERISM was retained, which led to the Foundation’s critical unpreparedness when faced with the emergence of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1425 Western Fifthist strain G9] in 2005. \n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/0| Previous]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/2| Next ]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
