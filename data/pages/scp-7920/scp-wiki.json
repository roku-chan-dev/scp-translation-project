The interior of the chamber appears to be a beige-colored room decorated similarly to a classroom. Posters and drawings line the walls and the floor is littered with papers and pencils. Throughout the room, there are multiple desks, and at the front of the room is a large black chalkboard. Seated at the desks are young humanoid entities (designated STUDENT-1 through STUDENT-5) and standing at the front of the room is a larger humanoid entity (designated TEACHER).]//\n\n**TEACHER:** —can tell me?

We stand in nothing.\n\n**TEACHER:** Correct. \n\n//[A loud sound similar to flapping wings can be heard. The TEACHER-entity turns purple.]//\n\n**TEACHER:** Now, who enters our midst?\n\n//[All the STUDENT-entities turn to stare at the camera. The camera shakes slightly.]//\n\n**STUDENT-2:** Someone to fill our place. Water fills a hole in the ground and a king fills a throne.\n\n**TEACHER:** Good. Now, tell me the name of god.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**TEACHER:** Tell me the name of god.\n\n//[In the background, a sound similar to dripping water can be heard.]//\n\n**TEACHER:** Tell me the name of god.\n\n**STUDENT-5:** //[Unintelligible.

By a unanimous vote of the Ethics Committee, Dr. Gardner is currently being held in Site-39’s hospital wing in a medically-induced coma.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{**ADDENDUM 7920-2 — INVESTIGATION**}}\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nAround the location of SCP-7920’s discovery, the following objects were recovered:\n\n* Approximately one (1) liter of human blood, spread on the ground.[[footnote]]DNA testing inconclusive.[[/footnote]]\n* Fourteen (14) dead purple butterflies.\n* Two (2) still-burning bonfires (since extinguished).\n* One (1) Glock 17 (loaded).\n* One (1) human corpse.[[footnote]]Moved to storage at Site-39.[[/footnote]]\n* One (1) ornate golden crown embedded with purple jewels, stained with a large amount of butterfly blood.

The Ethics Committee raised dissent-- however, due to pressing circumstances, including the recent loss of [[[SCP-7540|Site-515]]] and Site-906, the completion of the project was necessitated and the Committee’s dissent was vetoed.\n\nThe following log was recorded.\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++++ {{**Recording Two (Transcript)**}}\n[[/=]]\n-----\n= //**{{[BEGIN LOG]}}**//\n\n//[The OVERSEERS enter the containment chamber. They are standing inside a large circular cavity. The walls are pink and slimy, organic in appearance, slightly squishy to the touch. Dotting the walls are small holes, about ten centimeters in diameter each, filled with a harsh golden light. Every couple of seconds, the entire cavity shakes, bouncing the camera up and down. At the end of the cavity, there is a light.]//\n\n//[The camera moves towards the light, and the OVERSEERS step into it.]//\n\n//[Inside it appears to be a small hospital room. In the center of the room is a bed, surrounded by IV pumps. Lying in the bed is a man in a hospital gown. His eyes are closed.]//\n\n**O5-12:** Who are you? \n\n**O5-5:** Is that… Adam?\n\n**MAN:** No. Not anymore, I don’t think.\n\n**O5-5:** Then who are you?\n\n**MAN:** Hard to say for certain. //[Pauses.]// Have you read the Theology report?\n\n**O5-7:** How do you know about that?\n\n**MAN:** Answer the question.\n\n**O5-5:** Yes, we have.\n\n**MAN:** Then you’d know who I am.\n\n//[An IV pump begins to beep.]//\n\n**O5-11:** What is this place?\n\n**MAN:** Here? It’s a hole. A very big one. Large enough to fit a man… large enough to fit a god. It’s… whatever you want it to be, I guess.\n\n**O5-11:** What does that mean?\n\n//[The beeping increases in volume. Suddenly, the scene shifts. The hospital room slowly transforms into a bedroom and the hospital bed becomes a large white king-sized bed. The IV pump’s beeping is replaced with that of an alarm clock’s.]//\n\n**O5-11:** What have you become?\n\n**MAN:** I’ve filled the place of what used to exist here. You tell me.\n\n**O5-6:** How?\n\n**MAN:** A star supernovas and a new star is formed in its dust. Have you forgotten the number of dead stars?\n\n//[A pause. The beeping grows louder. Holes appear in the ceiling, in which long pink fleshy tentacles begin to protrude out of. They writhe in the air. The OVERSEERS do not take notice.]//\n\n**O5-11:** //[Angrily.]// What is the name of god?\n\n**MAN:** No.\n\n**O5-6:** Answer him, coward. What is the name of god?\n\n//[The alarm clock continues to beep.]//\n\n**MAN:** Adam.\n\n//[O5-6 slaps the MAN in his face. He winces. Burned into his forehead are three inward-facing arrows.]//\n\n**O5-11:** Tell me the name of god.\n\n//[Silence. The beeping stops. O5-11 smiles.
