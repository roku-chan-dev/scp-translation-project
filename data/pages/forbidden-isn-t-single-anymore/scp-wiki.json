Come in, I'll warm you right up.\n I set up a little table for us near the fireplace.\n I'll go make some hot chocolate.\n How is it?\n I like mine with marshmallows.\n I didn't know what you like exactly, so I just put honey in yours, I hope you enjoy it.\n You can make yourself comfortable on the sofa.\n Wait here, I've got a little surprise for you, I swear it'll be quick.\n I'm back, I got the fluffy blanket!\n There's only one, but it's pretty big, I think we can both fit in it.\n Here, I had some cake left over from last week's party.\n It's mango-flavoured.\n It's delicious, right? I baked it!\n Well, since we're all tucked in, I can tell you a few stories, if you want.\n I wrote them myself! Wait, lemme switch on my laptop first.\n Notepad, notepad... there you are. Here.\n Which one do you want me to read first?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 1000px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black; background-color: white\"]]\n*Untitled - Notepad ##transparent|Just spacing stuff out...
