While these places would generally be given an SCP designation and evacuated, in some cases this is not possible, due to practical or political constraints. Although not all Locations of Interest are fully controlled by the Foundation,  containment measures are in place to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their existence or anomalous nature.\n\nAn inhabited anomalous location designated as a Nexus permits residents to remain within it, under the supervision of the Foundation or another Group of Interest, since the anomalous properties of a Nexus generally cannot extend beyond its borders. Additionally, the Foundation has permitted the existence of a number of Free Ports, paranormal enclaves and other locations accessible only through anomalous means, within which the concealment and containment of anomalies is unnecessary. These communities are usually self-managed, with observation from the Foundation and local governments to ensure that anomalous phenomena remain within the Free Port. A number of additional Locations of Interest are known to the Foundation at this time, ranging in scale from small towns to entire countries, as well as entire alternate realities accessible from our own.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[# toc]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Table of Contents\" hide=\"Hide Table of Contents\"]]\n@@ @@[#map Map of Locations of Interest]\n@@ @@[#classes

The Nexus and the books within are maintained and protected by various inhuman entities known as [[[wanderers-library-hub|Librarians]]]. Individuals that harm the Library, its books, or its patrons are punished by transformation into one of these Librarians, serving the Library until they work off their debt. This has been the fate of a number of Foundation personnel during incursions into the Library, and so the Foundation has adopted a more diplomatic approach to this specific location.

Nx-05 is unique compared to other Nexuses in that no other anomalous phenomena naturally forms in its confines, with all anomalies resulting from it being entirely manmade. Despite its fairly unimpressive features, Nx-05 remains the only location known to the Foundation which can be accurately studied to provide information on how the anomalous as a whole operates; equations derived from this study have provided the basis for the entirety of the Foundation’s understanding of anomalies since the organization's inception.\n\n**Associated Articles:**\n* [[[nx-05 |Nx-05]]]\n* [[[dr-manns-proposal| Dr. Mann's Proposal]]] - The Spiral Path\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# gwag-hen]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]][[[nx-07 | Nx-07]]]: Gwag Hen y Cwn[[/span]]\n\n**Area Class:** ##green|**Asphodel**##\n\n**Location:** Swansea, Wales, United Kingdom\n\n**Containment Facility:** Site-78\n\n**Description:** A small town located on an island off the southern coast of Wales.

In 2011, the construction of the Varenne Gate[[footnote]]A massive paratechnological space-stabilizing machine[[/footnote]] by the Global Occult Coalition and the District Zero government, with support from the government of Vietnam, created a stable entrance to District Zero, enabling the community to become more actively involved in the outside anomalous community.\n\n**Associated Articles:** \n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/nx-59-vn NX-59-VN - District Zero]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/don-vi-tam-linh-hub Spiritual Division Hub]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/diep-ton-hub GOI-VN File: Children of the Leaf]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-420-vn SCP-420-VN] -  Pothood Godhood\n* All articles tagged with [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/district-zero district-zero] on the International Translation Archive.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# irkalla]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]]Nx-61: [[[ptt-1666-gray-templum|Irkalla]]][[/span]]\n\n**Area Class:** ##666|**Crossroads**##\n\n**Accessible From:** Zagros mountains of Northern Iraq and Western Iran\n\n**Description:** One of the many afterlives available to humanity, Irkalla, also known as Ir-Kalla, Irkalia, Kukku, Arali, Kigal, Kur or Erṣetu, a vast, partially extraspatial underground cavern below the Middle East, with a single spiral staircase acting as its entrance. This cavern contains many spirits and demons from the collection of societies that once resided in pre-Islamic Mesopotamia, and is one of a number of locations that have been traditionally described as a hell. Is the ancient Babylonian and Sumerian underworld or Sumerian Netherworld. It was a dark, dreary cavern located deep below the ground, where inhabitants were believed to continue \"a shadowy version of life on earth\". \n\nIrkalla was host to a large-scale slave revolt and civil war in the latter half of the 20th century, spurred on by competing interests from both America and the Soviet Union. Relations between Irkalla and the United States have eased lately, allowing an embassy and a UIU International Office to be established in its capital, but tensions still remain high. As the Tartarean Realm slowly industrializes and reaches out to the broader occult community, The United States hopes to use it as a pawn in their cold war against the Prince of Darkness, though the current regime is loath to be manipulated.\n\n**Associated Articles:**\n* [[[third-law-hub|Third Law Hub]]]\n* [[[dead-king-s-march|Dead King's March]]]\n* [[[ptt-1666-gray-templum|PTT-1666-Gray-Templum — \"Irkalla, House of Dumuzi, the Netherworld\"]]]\n* [[[SCP-8660]]] - The Empty Birdcage \n* [[[welcome-to-spectral-affairs|Welcome To Spectral Affairs]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# mujin]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]]Nx-64: Mujin[[/span]]\n\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/locations-of-interest/Mujin-si.png width=\"200px\"]]\n\n**Area Class:** ##green|**Asphodel**##\n\n**Location:** South Jeolla, South Korea\n\n**Containment Facility:** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64k|Site-64K]]]\n\n**Description:** Mujin is located along the coast of the Yeosu Peninsula, and experiences a never-ending fog that blankets the city.

Not to be confused with adytum, meaning innermost sanctuary.[[/footnote]] was the capital of the ancient //Kalmaktama// Empire (Adi-um Empire), and is believed to have been located in Western Siberia, now part of Russia. The empire was established in 1,800 BCE by a successful rebellion against the [[[daevite-hub|Daevite civilisation]]], lead by a man known as Grand Karcist Ion. For the next 800 years the city flourished as the center of a new civilization, with grand structures built from organic material through the practice of carnomancy. However, after an ancient [[[scp-2406|Occult War]]] between the //Kalmaktama// Empire and various Mediterranean states, incuding the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Mekhanites]]], Adytum disappeared from the baseline reality along with Grand Karcist Ion, resulting in the collapse of the //Kalmaktama// civilization and the dispersal of a Sarkic diaspora throughout the world.\n\nThe current location and status of Adytum are unclear. Minimal archeological evidence for its existence has been found, although given the organic nature of Sarkic structures and tools, this is not unexpected. Various Sarkic sects believe that Adytum still exists somewhere in the void outside the universe, and some accounts suggest it may still be accessible. Multiple Proto-Sarkic sources claim that the city was deliberately removed from baseline reality, although it is unclear if this was intended to protect the city from invaders, or to prevent something within the city from entering into our reality. Several neo-Sarkic sects are actively working toward the rediscovery and [[[scp-2480|return of Adytum]]], an event that would represent a severe disruption to normalcy, and is to be prevented at all costs.\n\n**Associated Articles:**\n* [[[Sarkicism Hub]]]\n* [[[memoria-adytum|In Memoria, Adytum]]]\n* [[[Metaphysician/Karpin Proposal]]]\n* [[[Laid In Blood]]]\n* [[[A Real Humdinger]]]\n* All pages tagged [/system:page-tags/tag/adytum adytum].\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# alagadda]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]][[[scp-2264| The Kingdom of Alagadda]]][[/span]]\n\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Alocations-of-interest/COA-Alagadda.svg height=\"150px\"]]\n\n**Accessible From:** London, England, United Kingdom\n\n**Description:**  Although an entrance located in the Tower of London is contained as part of [[[SCP-2264]]],  the extradimensional city-state of Alagadda is not controlled by the Foundation, but is instead ruled by a powerful reality-bending entity known as the [[[divine-dossier#hanged-king| Hanged King]]].

While the Foundation's actions in 1992 were able to anchor Las Vegas to baseline reality, Las Vegas and Hell continue to influence each other. This has resulted in a region of the Fourth Circle resembling a distorted and exaggerated version of Las Vegas, and has also enabled a number of Tartarean-class demonic entities to cross over from this demonic metropolis into Las Vegas. These entities are drawn towards and draw power from alcohol use, sexual intercourse, and gambling, and so it has been deemed impossible to fully exclude them from Las Vegas. Instead, containment of Undervegas involves cooperation with and employment of these Tartarean Entities, to ensure that the general public remains unaware of their presence within the city.\n\nUndervegas is mostly populated by demons of all seven classical sins (i.e. Lust, Greed, Pride, etc.) and is controlled by seven Pit Bosses that each represent one of the seven sins and one of seven estates. The city of Undervegas is split into seven districts or known as estates, each representing a cardinal sin with each estate being controlled by the most powerful demon in that area or at that time, otherwise known as a 'Pit Boss'. The Fourth Estate, or the Moneypit, is the largest of all seven estates which is controlled by Ba'al, the pit boss of that estate.\n\n**Associated Articles:**\n* [[[Third Law Hub]]]\n* [[[undervegas-hub|Agent Calendar's Undervegas Hub]]]\n* [[[SCP-4661]]] - Sin City\n* [[[SCP-5690]]] - Professional Demonatrix\n* [[[SCP-7666]]] - UNDERVEGAS ORIENTATION: The House Loses\n* [[[The Signing Of The Las Vegas Accords]]]\n* All pages tagged [/system:page-tags/tag/undervegas undervegas].\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# unlondon]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]]UnLondon[[/span]]\n\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/locations-of-interest/COA-UnLondon.png width=\"200px\"]]\n\n**Location:** London, England, United Kingdom\n\n**Description:** [[[SCP-1678]]] is a reconstruction of the British city of London, located 1 kilometer underground and constructed entirely in a Victorian style.

Analysis of documents recovered from SCP-5345 corroborate the existence of a competent national normalcy organization, the West Korean Ministry of Abnormal Affairs, which was primarily responsible for the nation's disappearance.\n\nWhile it is possible to access the Republic of West Korea by traversing to its current plane of existence -- believed to be one of many potential afterlives -- or [[[SCP-7722|vice versa]]], the presence of unidentified hostile entities haunting the nation's extraplanar territory have prompted the Foundation's current policy of non-invasive monitoring.

Note that their coexistence on this page does not mean they necessarily coexist in-universe! Also note that different depictions of a location may differ, there's nothing incorrect about changing some of the details to better fit the story you intend to tell.\n\nNexuses were originally defined on the [[[nexus-series|Nexus Hub]]] as a specific type of article format, although over time various locations were added to the page that were described as Nexuses in SCPs and Tales. Free Ports were added later, as another type of anomalous location. When working on this rewrite, we decided to include a number of additional \"Locations of Interest\" that appeared in multiple articles, but weren't officially defined as a Nexus or Free Port, and while creating this page we've avoided referring to them as such in the absence of an official classification in a published article without first getting the author's permission to assign a Free Port number. Some anomalous locations will be been omitted from the list above - they either don't have at least 2 appearances in published articles, or they simply haven't been added to the page yet.\n\nThe map is the best representation we can manage of where the Locations shown on it are, or at least where they are accessible from, in the case of locations within pocket dimensions or alternate realities. Although it was created using the same map as the [[[secure-facilities-locations|Facilities page]]], created by [[*user L200]], it was inspired by earlier work by IAmPuzzlr, [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/pzugc5/another_guide_poster_for_your_rooms_this_time_for/ posted on reddit].\n\nThe images used here are a mixture of flags, coats of arms, signs and logos -- anything that can represent a place. Not all locations have one, and people are welcome to create more. Some existed already, while others were created specifically to be included on this page -- feel free to use them elsewhere!\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Adding to this Page]]\nThis collaborative page is open for any site member to edit and add to, but you're welcome to make suggestions or get feedback on proposed additions in the Discussion. In general, the idea was to be as inclusive as possible within the general scope of \"inhabited anomalous location\".\n\nAnyone is welcome to add to the list of articles in which a location appears or is described, although we're looking for more than just a brief mention. If there is a tag, please limit the appearances to no more than the 5, prioritising the most relevant or most informative articles.\n\nThis page is the responsibility of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/curation-main Curation Team]. If you have any questions or suggestions, you can contact us via the #help-desk channel on the [https://discord.com/invite/scp SCP Wiki Official Discord server], or via [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide IRC chat #site17], or by messaging a member of the Collaboration Pages subteam. \n\n++ Adding New Locations\n\nThe first section of this page is for all locations described in a [[[nexus-series|Nexus format]]]. Additional locations that are referred to as a Nexus within an SCP or Tale can be added, as long as they're given a number and described in sufficient detail to enable their inclusion here. Merely mentioning the name and Nexus number is insufficient, although there is a list of those on [[[locations-complete-list| this page]]]. International articles using a non-standard format will be added to the list at the appropriate place numerically if articles are translated, treating Nx-CN-08 as equivalent to Nx-08.\n\nFree Ports don't have a specified format in exactly the same way, but will generally be treated the same as just another type of Nexus -- if the Free Port number appears in a published article, it can be included in the list.\n\nFor Locations of Interest, we're looking for a minimum of 2 appearances -- otherwise we'd end up listing every SCP with the [/system:page-tags/tag/location location] and [/system:page-tags/tag/city city] tags, and we want to keep the length of this page manageable. To count as an appearance, we're looking for more than just the mention of the name -- part of the story should focus on or take place in the Location of Interest. Additionally, a Location of Interest must be a place that can actually be visited in-universe, not somewhere that used to exist but no longer does (unless, for example, the ruins of it remain interesting). For an alternate reality to count as a Location of Interest, there will need to be a reliable way for people to travel there, as well as some way of communicating information about it back. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Template for new additions\" hide=\"Omit any section that's not applicable!\"]]\n[[code]]\n[[# table-of-contents-anchor]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++ [[span style=\"font-family: Verdana; font-size: 125%;\"]]Nx-XX: Nexus Name[[/span]]\n\n[[f>image image-url height=\"150px\"]] [!--(or width=\"200px\")--]\n\n**Area Class:** ##blue|**Briar**##/##green|**Asphodel**##/##FFDD00|**Camelot**##/ ##orange|**Shangri-La**##/##red|**Dunwich**##/##purple|**Free Port**##\n\n**Location:**/**Accessible From:** City, State, Country [!--Can list more than one, but don't list more than 4--]\n\n**Containment Facility:**/**Surveillance Facility:** Site-YY\n\n**Description:** About the Location [!--Write from the perspective of the Foundation--]\n\n**Associated Articles:**\n* [[[link|Title]]] [!--If there's a tag, limit it to 5 articles, then link the tag as the last one. --]\n[[/div]]\n[[/code]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++ Adding to the Map\nIf a Location is added to this list, it can also be added to the map, to indicate the general area it's located in or accessible from. Instructions for doing this can be found on the [[[fragment:locations-map|page where the map is hosted]]].\n\n++ Adding New Images\nNew images to represent specific locations can be added to the page, but before uploading them it's best to get feedback from the creator of the location, or at least from someone who's written articles featuring the location. While there's flexibility on size since the proportions of these images vary, as a general rule the height should not be more than 150px, and the width should not be more than 200px. To keep things consistent, for flags and other wide images set width=\"200px\", while for coats of arms, seals and other round or square logos, set height=\"150px\".\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Nexus Format]]\nA Nexus is defined as an actively anomalous area that supports a permanent community. When creating a new Nexus, keep the following characteristics in mind.\n\n++ Low Population\nMost Nexuses have very low population numbers, generally with only a few thousand people. A large population would make it much harder for their existence to be concealed by the Foundation, as news of the Nexus's existence would spread much more easily.\n\n++ Nexus Confines\nA Nexus's anomalies only occur within the confines of the Nexus (or in certain cases, other Nexuses). For example, you couldn't force the Goatman from Sloth's Pit to exit the confines of the Nexus: the act would simply make him a normal goat after a while. What happens in the Nexus, stays in the Nexus.\n\n++ Thematic Influence\nEach Nexus has its central theme that encompasses the entire idea of the anomaly in the Nexus. They can exist anywhere in the world, so long as they have around ~25 people at least, and should not match any real-world location. Besides that, you're free to do whatever you want. If you want a Nexus that rains salmon, go ahead[[footnote]]Someone's already done that idea, unfortunately[[/footnote]].\n\n++ The Nexus Format\n\nTo create a new Nexus Article, copy the following template:\n\n[[code]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**Nexus #:** Nx-XX\n\n**Civilian Designation:** [Name of Nexus Town]\n\n**Population:** [Approximate number of people living in the
