Surveys by tracing of the disappeared matter have as of yet been unsuccessful. SCP-280-JP reduces its own diameter by mass of the erased objects. Additionally, SCP-280-JP shrinks in response to air and electromagnetic waves; therefore the containment facility must be an RF anechoic chamber without light and air to keep the current diameter.</p><p>SCP-280-JP allows cutting operations ignoring hardness of matter. By permission from the Site Director, experiments and cutting operations will be available.</p>\";\n\nstr04x=strsize + \"</p>\";\n\n\nif( scpsize < limen1 ){\n  // Least(Safe)\n  if( level == 0 ){\n    level = 1;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str021;\n  str01a=objName;\n  str03a=str031 + str033 + str032;\n  str04a=str041 + str043a + str042 + str043z;\n  strInput = strInput1 + strInput2a + strInput3;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc1.src;\n}else if( scpsize < limen2 ){\n  // Euclid\n  if( level == 1 ){\n    level = 2;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str022;\n  str01a=objName;\n  str03a=str031 + str033 + str032;\n  str04a=str041 + str043b + str042 + str043z;\n  strInput = strInput1 + strInput2a + strInput3;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc2.src;\n}else if( scpsize < limen3 ){\n  // Keter\n  if( level == 2 ){\n    level = 3;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str022;\n  str01a=objName;\n  str03a=str031 + str034 + str032;\n  str04a=str041 + str043c + str042 + str043z;\n  strInput = strInput1 + strInput2b + strInput3;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc3.src;\n}else if( scpsize < limen4 ){\n  // Keter(SCP-280-JP)\n  if( level == 3 ){\n    level = 4;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str023;\n  str01a=objName;\n  str03a=str031 + str035 + str032;\n  str04a=str041 + str043d + str042 + str043z;\n  strInput = strInput1 + strInput2b + strInput3;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc4.src;\n}else if( scpsize < limen5 ){\n  // Keter(SCP-280-JP(en))\n  if( level == 4 ){\n    level = 5;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str023;\n  str01a=objName;\n  str03a=str03e;\n  str04a=str04e;\n  strInput = strInput1 + strInput2c + strInput3;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc5.src;\n}else if( scpsize < limen6 ){\n  // (nul)\n  if( level == 5 ){\n    level = 6;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n  str02a=str02x;\n  str01a=\"\";\n  str03a=\"\";\n  str04a=str04x;\n  strInput = strInput2d;\n  imgsrc = imgsrc6.src;\n}else{\n  // Blank\n  if( level == 6 ){\n    level = 7;\n    uplevel=1;\n  }\n}\n\nif( viewbtn == 0 ){\n  strInput = strInput00;\n}\n\nif( scpsize < limen4 ){\n  str010=\"<p><b>Item #:</b> \";\n  str020=\"<p><b>Object Class:</b> \";\n  str030=\"</p><p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> \";\n  str040=\"</p><p><b>Description:</b> \";\n}else{\n  str010=\"<p><b>Item #:</b> \";\n  str020=\"<p><b>Object Class:</b> \";\n  str030=\"</p><p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> \";\n  str040=\"</p><p><b>Description:</b> \";\n}\n\nif( scpsize >= limen6 ){\n  // Delete all\n  document.getElementById(\"testjs2\").innerHTML=\"<font color='#ffffff'></font>\"\n}else{\n  // Display\n  document.getElementById(\"testjs2\").innerHTML= str010 + str01a + \"</p>\" + str020 + str02a + str030 + str03a + strInput + str040+ str04a;\n  if( adding == 1 ){\n    document.getElementById(\"updbtn\").disabled = true;\n    if( scpsize < limen5 ){\n      document.getElementById(\"updbtn\").value = \"Please Wait...\";\n    }else if( scpsize < limen6 ){\n      document.getElementById(\"updbtn\").value = \"・・・・・\";\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nif( uplevel == 1 ){\n  document.getElementById(\"scpimg\").src=imgsrc;\nif( level == 7 ){\n  document.getElementById(\"scpimgtbl\").style.display = 'none';\n}\n}\nuplevel=0;\n}\n//-->\n</script>\n</link>\n[[/html]]",
