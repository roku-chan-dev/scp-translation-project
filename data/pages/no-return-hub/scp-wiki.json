This canon is concerned with consequences first and foremost; when we were writing SCP-6500 it became clear that whichever timeline the reader chose, the concept of the Foundation was going to be irrevocably changed.  Which is fitting, as Inevitable is a pretty stark //climate change// allegory.  We wanted to create a setting which would foster further stories, leading off from either timeline.  \n\nSo, what is //No Return//?  It’s life after the tipping point, along two very different causal paths.  One where the Foundation maintains its iron grip on the anomalous world, but those in the know are aware SCP-6500 was the SCPF’s fault and another in which the Foundation dissolves, forming a new organization with various groups of interest (read Emissary!) to try to educate the public about the anomalous world.\n\n------\n\n**__Concerning Vanguard__**:\n\nAny substantive change to the Foundation appears like an attempt to make it all more progressive but in reality, Vanguard is only interested in preserving the anomalous in light of the Impasse. Which means doing what they can to normalize the anomalous and reverse direction on a lot of Foundation policies.\n\nVanguard is not trying to save the world. Much of the attitude towards it being a Utopia or \"//liberal wet dream//\" are knee jerk responses to changes in the setting like \"Vanguard can't have D-class\" and \"Vanguard needs to make people appreciate and like them, so they trust Vanguard enough to allow for normalization.\" These are __less progressive ideals and more practical solutions to try and rehabilitate the image of the Foundation__ now that Vanguard is in the public eye **and** because they want to work with GOIs where possible. GOIs who have been openly hostile to the Foundation, like the Serpent's Hand and the Nälkän peoples.\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Contributing]]\nThis is a canon, so obviously we are open to any and all writing stories in these settings (//Threshold// or //Vanguard//) but __we ask that you read at least the paths of Inevitable that lead to the timeline you want to write for__.  Please feel free to discuss your ideas with the creators, we want a collaborative canon based on our monstrously large collaborative SCP.\n\n**__Threshold__** is probably a little more cynical, and useful for stories about corruption within the Foundation.  \n* In the Threshold Timeline, Overwatch Command when presented with the realization that their organization’s work to contain anomalies caused the slow death of all magic decided to do the bare minimum to repair the damage and continue on as before. \n* It’s effectively an open secret within this Timeline that the Foundation is responsible for the Impasse and that they are covering it up.  \n* Multiple actors (including some within the Foundation) seek to out the Foundation for their part in causing SCP-6500 and bring about the downfall of the O5s, or at the very least curtail the continuing practice of containing anomalies.\n\n**__Vanguard__** is probably a little more optimistic, and useful for stories about a new beginning and making up for past misdeeds.  \n* In the Vanguard Timeline, Overwatch bowed their will to O5-Zero who proposed the Foundation dissolve and form a new organization, partnering with certain GOIs to build Vanguard.  Vanguard is an organization whose motto is //Shelter. Normalize. Inform//.  \n* The goal of Vanguard is to acclimate the public to the existence of the anomalous and stop hiding the truth of this weird world.  They still intend to keep on protecting the world from dangerous anomalies, but without the amnestics, disinformation campaigns, D-Class, and other ethically distasteful activities the SCPF has gotten up to in the last century.  \n* At the outset, Vanguard is made up of Ex-Foundation personnel, several Nälkä communities and Karcists, the large majority of the Serpent’s Hand and the Maxwellist Collective. //The Emissary Path is almost essential reading to grasp this new organization.//\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n//BUT KEEP IN MIND//: Any story is possible in either timeline.  Just have fun and don’t hesitate to ask for guidance.\n\nFor adding to this canon hub, please ask for assistance (as you can see the formatting is unique).\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Sister Canons]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Sister Canons\n[[/=]]\n\nIntimately tied into __**No Return**__ are the canons of the creators of SCP-6500:\n* **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub | On Guard 43]]]** – concerning the cast of characters that populate Site-43, specializing in acroamatic abatement, alternative containment procedures, memetics, and one weird anomalous media company.  Focusing on witty slice of life stories, grandiose plots consisting of myriad twists and turns, the future pursuit of knowing the secrets of pataphysics through the lens of the Archetypicals, and the weird social commentary of Vikander-Kneed Technical Media.\n* **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-s-c-plastics-hub | S&C Plastics]]]** – concerning the personnel who staff Site-87, in the Sloth’s Pit Nexus, a town intrinsically tied to the power of narratives in more ways than one.  “It is about the people at Site-87 who have, somehow, broken free of the Foundation's ability to grind individuality, decency, humanity, and common sense into nothingness.”\n* **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wonder-world | What a Wonderful World]]]** – This canon is mainly set in the anomalous city of Wonder World!^^TM^^, which does indeed exist on Earth as an extradimensional space somewhere in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. Wonder World!^^TM^^ is host, of course, to the company of Dr. Wondertainment, and to a large population (I mean, think medium sized city) of magical, Wondrous people. The culture is built on childlike innocence, willing naivety, whimsy, and a deep appreciation for the goodness that can be found in each and every person.  What a Wonderful World is not about ignoring the dark, disturbing, horribly effed up world that is the Foundationverse. It's about finding reasons to be happy and pushing through in spite of that.\n\nAdditionally, **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/from-120-s-archives-hub | From 120's Archives]]]** is also tied into the Vanguard timeline.  From 120’s Archive is a modern fantasy canon focusing on the anomalous world's efforts to better itself. Almost nothing is certain – despite the ever-present gods, zealots, and horrors of the reemerging Fae Empire – except that the Foundation must work together with the anomalous, whether it likes it or not.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/<]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n----\n\n[[module Rate]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: 4px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=S D locke, Aethris, DarkStuff, Grigori Karpin, HarryBlank, Ihp, Placeholder McD, Liryn]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename**: Warrior, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Pariah, Warlock, Reliquarians, Voyager, Emissary\n> **Author**: [[*user Aethris]]\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Additional Notes**: Used with her express permission.\n\n----\n\n> **Filename**: No Return Banner\n> **Author**: [[*user Grigori Karpin]] & [[*user Liryn]]\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Additional Notes**: Using the 5 below images:\n\n> **Filename:** Sauelsuesor.jpg\n> **Name:** Two Coronal Holes on the Sun Viewed by SDO\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]] / NASA Goddard Photo and Video\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/2de2ddb8-1114-4c04-92af-c1315d038a24 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** comm_ihp.png\n> **Author:** [[*user WarFang]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Notes:** Created specifically for ihp's tale.
