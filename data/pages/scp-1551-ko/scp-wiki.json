Therefore the Foundation is to focus on prolonging SCP-1551-KO as much as possible.\n\nConsidering the potential risks of information leak of SCP-1551-KO, access to information about the phenomena is limited to personnel with Security Clearance 4/1551.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1551-KO refers to the terminus of human development. This is not limited to the normal world utilising regular science and technology but includes the paranormal world, which adopted paratechnology. This occurs in other universes with different fundamental physics.\n\nSCP-1551-KO itself is non-anomalous but has been selected as a containment subject for the following reasons.\n* Every person on Earth loses motivation.\n* Mass unemployment in the R&D sector.\n\n**Discovery:** The Dimensional Analysis Department analysed around 1,000,000 civilisations about their development status and field and the remaining lifetime of the universe in which each civilisation is. Comparing the results with our universe suggested that our normal world will stop growing after 2,600 years, and the paranormal world will stop after 45. Dr Han Yunseo defined this as the Develine and requested Foundation superiors to designate it as a containment subject. This request has been granted, and the phenomena have been designated as SCP-1551-KO.\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Â°\" hide=\"Reading additional document\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[=]]\nSecurity Clearance 5/1551 required.\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\nChecking Security Clearance\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\nComplete\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n##green|Opened##\n[[/=]]\n\n**Addendum:** 1551-KO\n> **Speakers:** Dr Han Yunseo and Dr Lee Juhyeon\n>\n> **Objective:** Decide whether to spread the forged document SCP-1551-KO intentionally.\n> -----\n> <Start of log>\n>\n> //A table with two buttons on top is in the frame.//\n>\n> //Dr Han and Lee enter the room//\n>\n> //Dr Han sits on the seat//\n>\n> //Dr Lee sits across Dr Han//\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Well then, should we talk?\n>\n> //Dr Han presses the button//\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Okay, persuade me, then. Why are you trying to make such a decision?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Decision? What decision?\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Stop playing your word games. I'll be blunt. Why on Earth would you write a report about a fictitious phenomenon and act like it has been leaked? I can't understand.\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Because the Foundation needs to grow.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** What does spreading a tragic lie have to do with the growth of the Foundation?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Dr Lee, have you ever wanted superpowers when you were young?\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Why are you evading the topi-\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Answer me.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** ...Yes.\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Then, did you get it before coming to the Foundation?\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Of course not. But what does that have to do with-\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Then, can you now?\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** No.\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Are you sure?\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** ...I guess I can't.\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** You're not sure, right? That's why I decided to do this.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** ...What does that mean?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** Let me put this simply. We are in this anomalous paranormal world. And we don't know what will happen in this kind of world. This means anyone can be special. On the other hand, it also means we can't predict anything. The pavement we step on while coming to work can be a doomsday button, the air we just inhaled can be turned into a radioactive substance, and my body can suddenly break down in a second. But we don't consider such events. We don't think they'll ever happen because we're special.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Focusing on such trivialities wastes foundation resources. Also, let's say we do think the way you say. What about it? If you think that belief in being special is so important, are you going to make a religion out of it or what?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** I can't make a religion. However, I can seed the belief about themselves in people. That's why I am spreading the bleak future approved by the Foundation.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** So that people beg God so that development doesn't stop?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** No. It's giving people an opportunity to see themselves as special. Foundation personnel will think they are special and try to break what the Foundation says is impossible. On top of that, there will not be any stop in development right now, so nothing bad will happen.\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Do we need to go that extreme to develop? Are you insane?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** I'm serious. Why we need development so much is to improve our chances of survival. You'll get it now. Please choose wisely.\n>\n> //Dr Han stands up//\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Don't you think Foundation personnel will find oddities in the document?\n>\n> **Dr Han Yunseo:** No problem there. Foundation personnel will believe the leaked forged document as it is because it's not disclosed but leaked. Like we believe in anomalies, they'll believe in the leaked Foundation information.\n>\n> **//Dr Han Yunseo leaves the room//**\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Wha... What in the world...\n>\n> //Continued silence//\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Feeling special...\n>\n> //Continued silence//\n>\n> //Dr Lee stands up//\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Hah...\n>\n> //Dr Lee presses the button//\n>\n> **Dr Lee Juhyeon:** Does this count as feeling special?\n>\n> //Dr Lee leaves the room//\n>\n> <End of log>\n> -----\n> **Conclusion:** Forged document SCP-1551-KO is shown to all Foundation personnel.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=BsR408, translated by fluxman]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
