The room is to be continuously ventilated due to the emitted irritating odor.\n\n**Description:** SCP-PL-338 is a marble sculpture measuring 5.14 m, titled \"David\" and created by Micheangelo in 1504. It originally stood at Piazza della Signoria in Florence, but was moved to the Galleria dell’Accademia to protect it from urban birdlife.\n\nPutrid gases are constantly being emitted from SCP-PL-338, more specifically from its eyelids, ears, nose, urethra and anus. Although there are no visible holes in the aforementioned areas, the gases seems to be escaping from the inside.\n\nInhaling them causes subjects to experience memories of a conversation between two men, where one asks the other for medicine, to which the latter agrees, accepts his payment and performs an operation unseen by the subject.\n\nDuring the projection of this memory, there is a sensation of itching and movement beneath the skin, however this has no physiological basis. The memory and bodily sensations cease immediately after the exposure to gas is finished.\n\n**Addendum PL-338/01:** Structural Research\n\nTo better understand the mechanism or the reason of putrid gases escaping from SCP-PL-338, an analysis of the marble, from which the object is made, was conducted. It was revealed that part of its surface was only a 3 cm layer of stone, under which was biomass.\n\nWith this discovery, an X-Ray was performed, which proved that inside was a still living human being. Its organs -- except for the heart and the brain -- were liquified into a semi-solid mass. After the examination was completed, the sculpture started to tremble, causing it to collapse and shatter its front portion, exposing its insides, which killed the human within.\n\nDuring the intervention after the fall of SCP-PL-338, it was noted that a sizeable tapeworm had slipped out of the subject's body, which was later found to measure 4 meters in length. Once captured and euthanized in a 10% ethanol solution for vivisection, it was found not belonging to any known species, although it was morphologically close to a beef tapeworm (//Taenia saginata//). \n\nNotably, SCP-PL-338's biomass contained around ████ eggs that didn't surpass the particle size of sand. The eggs were found to be fertilized and, when given to a pig, entered the adulthood stage in a week, causing the animal to become covered in marble, they were subsequently designated as SCP-PL-338-A. The pig has been euthanized and incinerated, and the rest of the eggs were frozen.\n\n**Addendum PL-338/02:** Historical Discovery\n\nWith the occurrence of the 23.05.2024 earthquake across Italy, a system of previously undiscovered caves has been exposed in Florence. To date, it has not been managed to explore and map all the tunnels, however this task is assigned to Mobile Task Force Gamma-38 (\"Spelunky Boys\"). \n\nA caves section worth noting was a flooded grotto which was inhibited by SCP-PL-338-A instances. Analysis revealed that these organisms were artificially introduced to the reservoir, indicated by the marble organisms lying on its bottom and the absence of other unaffected animals.\n\nWhile mapping the grotto it was discovered that one of the walls was in fact covered with an illusion concealing a tunnel with stairs leading to the surface. Upon reaching the top, MTF members ended up in the garden of what is currently now Michelangelo's family home museum. Research on the rest of his sculptures is pending approval.\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-PL-337]]] | SCP-PL-338 | [[[SCP-PL-339]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
