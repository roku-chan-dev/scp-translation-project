On 10/24/2022, SCP-7407 was neutralized by SCP-7407-2-15A with no aid or authorization from the Decommissioning Department. Any attempts to recover SCP-7407 have been unsuccessful. No communication with previous SCP-7407-15-B subjects[[footnote]] The following note has been recovered from SCP-7407's Head Researcher, Dr. Jackal, personal records which were approved as an important reminder for personnel: Just leave them be... they don't need to be reminded of the past.[[/footnote]], specifically SCP-7407-15B, should be conducted.\n\nDue to SCP-7407's immobile nature, a small security (Σ-01) and research outpost (Σ-02) were constructed <1km from SCP-7407. Due to its effects, SCP-7407 was not to be contained and was able to be approached and interacted with by the public. Direct interaction with SCP-7407 was permitted only for the purpose approved by on-duty administration; personal use for gain was never authorized. The area was to be monitored by security staff, and any authorized individual who engaged in research and/or interaction with SCP-7407 was fitted with a remote-controlled transmitting device that could be activated from Outpost Σ-01.\n\nMTF Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") was provided Clearance Level 2/7407 for the purpose of successfully retrieving and terminating any SCP-7407-2 subjects.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7407 was a rusted metal fence located in the Battery Spencer overlook in Sausalito, California. It exhibited no visual anomalous properties and showed signs of oxidation and decay. Furthermore, previous attempts at damaging or cutting the links of SCP-7407 proved successful. Attempts to relocate or damage SCP-7407 caused extreme guilt and anxiety in affected subjects, followed by death, as shown by neurological activity in the prefrontal cortex with the addition of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (\"Broken Heart Syndrome\") found through autopsy. On it, several padlocks (designated as SCP-7407-1 instances) were attached to its metal links. \n\nOnce a padlock, then designated SCP-7407-1, would attach itself to one of the links, it would become insusceptible to damage. When an individual placed an ordinary padlock onto one of SCP-7407's links, with their and another individual's initials carved into the side, a series of events would transpire that depended on the relationship between the two people (designated as SCP-7407-2-XA and SCP-7407-2-XB). If the two individuals both expressed feelings of affection towards each other, there would be no rupture to the relationship. In the event a person (-B) did not possess genuine affection for the other individual (-A), the SCP-7407-2-B subject would've slowly begun to fall in love with the SCP-7407-2-A instance, eventually leading to psychopathic behavior. SCP-7407-2-B would also exhibit anomalous behaviors (in certain circumstances), such as inhuman speeds, reflexes, strength, and flight.\n\nRemoving the link(s) that SCP-7407-1 was attached to did not remove SCP-7407's abilities on the SCP-7407-2 subjects, thus, the only way to reverse its abilities would be to find the key and unlock SCP-7407-1. Attempts to pick the lock or use other conventional methods also proved unsuccessful.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCP-7407 Addendums\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 75%]]Listed below are logs, audio recording transcripts, and other information pertaining to SCP-7407 that do not fit above.[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Experiment Logs\" hide=\"Retract Experiment Logs\"]]\n@@ @@\n+ **Experiment Logs**\n\n**Purpose**: Determine the extent and purpose of SCP-7407.

They then attached the padlock to SCP-7407 and threw the key into the bay. It is worth noting that post to their placing of the lock, their relationship had been in a lively state.

She then attached the padlock to SCP-7407 and threw the key into the bay. She then drove home and received multiple calls and text messages from Caleb for opportunities to talk and possibly have a relationship. Undoubtedly accepting, Martina and Caleb began dating until the night of January 4th, when Caleb was arrested for sneaking into Martina's girls-only dorm room and sleeping next to her, causing a major disturbance through bashing and screaming.

Once calmed down, they were questioned and put into quarantine for further analysis. During further investigation, they admitted to using SCP-7407, but a few hours after placing the lock on SCP-7407 they received no phone calls or messages from their supposed subject (which he did not give any detail about). After the investigation was concluded after a period of three (3) days, it was theorized that if an SCP-7407-A subject does not have a true sense of affection towards a subject, the SCP-7407-B subject will not reciprocate the same emotions. Due to this, Elsidi could not deal with the fact he didn't truly love the individual, and emotionally broke down. \n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**##90162D|Experiment 15##** — [****##E1002A|**Incident 7407-A##**] \n\n**Subjects**: Researcher Alex Mavery (25) and Eleanor Cameron (22).

Several days after Incident 7407-B, multiple instances of SCP-7407-1 previously attached to SCP-7407 were discovered on shore. During examination, all initials were scrubbed out, and the padlocks were opened despite previously being attached to SCP-7407. Based on this information, SCP-7407 was determined to be neutralized, and its containment level was updated. The staff of Outpost Σ-01 has been transferred to other Foundation projects, but a small team of security personnel stationed at Σ-01 will continue to monitor the crash site and report any findings to Dr. Jackal. SCP-7407-2-15B is not to be interviewed.\n\n@@ @@\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Unnamed Addendum\" hide=\"Retract Addendum\"]]\n@@ @@\n+ **Unnamed Addendum**\n\n**Date:** December 1st, ████\n**Interviewee**: Dr. Jackal\n**Interviewer**: EC-██\n**Notes**: Prior to Incident 7407-B, EC-██ interviews Dr. Jackal for the official close on the SCP-7407 project.
