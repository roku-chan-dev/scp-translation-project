If the forgery is noticed, mass amnestic treatment must be administered.\n\nSCP-1017-KO's influence has severely damaged humanity. However, this influence is vital for the survival of the human race. Therefore, it is not directly controlled. Instead, it will be procedurally removed as per the Absolute Tooth Plan after SCP-1017-KO's neutralisation. \n\n**Description:** SCP-1017-KO is a massive tooth-shaped structure that resembles the second primary molar tooth.[[footnote]] The primary tooth on the outermost position. It is the 5th tooth of all the primary teeth. [[/footnote]] Its width is presumed to be 2.9x10^^23^^km, and its height to be 4.4x10^^23^^km, with the top 1.5x10^^23^^km, or the crown, protruding into space.\n\nSCP-548-KO and the Earth are located in the middle of the two roots of SCP-1017-KO. This is presumed not to be from chance.\n\nThe Baseline is under constant exposure to severe dental hazards caused by SCP-1017-KO. Its influence created [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5940|SCP-5940]]], [[[SCP-548-KO]]], and the tooth as a digestive organ. The role specifically, resulted in animals relying on mastication for mechanical digestion.\n\nPhysiodental calculations suggest that SCP-1017-KO was created by naturally occurring dental particulates compressed by their gravity. SCP-1017-KO took its form approximately 4 billion years after the birth of the universe. \n\nSCP-1017-KO was discovered in 1938. Personnel who noticed SCP-1017-KO's danger immediately established the Absolute Tooth Plan. However, the plan could not be realised due to the lack of paranormal technology and resources.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ **Addendum:** Absolute Tooth Plan\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThe Absolute Tooth Plan has been the ultimate goal of Site-871's Dentistry Department ever since it was established in 1946. The final goal of the Absolute Tooth Plan is to eliminate SCP-1017-KO to prevent additional dental hazards and completely expunge the remaining dental anomalies. The plan consists of two main steps.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n+++ **Step 1**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSCP-1017-KO's roots are decomposed into dental particulates, providing the materials for the massive dental structure that will be built later, and allowing SCP-1017-KO's easy escape out of the Baseline. This stem is managed by the Psychodentistry and Tempodental Anomalies Department. \n----\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n\n**Objective 1. Damaging SCP-1017-KO's roots**\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Application of Oral Observation**\n[[/=]]\n-----\nIf one orally observes a subject with teeth, psychodental mirroring induces a weak enamel collapse in the periodontium. This causes slight damage to the periodontium, which this step takes advantage of.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block-base name=http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/draft:sycop-23-5043/Psychodentistry.png|caption=Site-871 Psychodentistry Department|width=200px|link=#|align=right]]\n\n2100 D-Class personnel of Site-871 orally observe SCP-1017-KO. However, due to the slight but constant influence of SCP-548-KO on the D-Class individuals, they cannot retain sanity for more than 72 hours, even with a mental retention apparatus. Therefore, D-Class individuals must be rotated on a 72-hour basis. D-Class individuals discharged from rotation are administered A-Class amnestics and given 70 hours of recovery. After approximately 30 years, SCP-1017-KO's roots will be damaged to an acceptable degree.\n\nD-Class individuals that suffered irreversible physical or psychological damage during the process should have all their teeth extracted and then be terminated. Lost D-Class individuals are replaced using [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5865|SCP-5865]]]. \n\n> **This objective was successfully fulfilled in 1978.** SCP-5865 was neutralised in 1979. All Foundation personnel underwent amnestic procedures.\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n**Objective 2: Achieve psychodental proximity of Earth and SCP-1017-KO**\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Enamel Torsion Induction**\n[[/=]]\n-----\nThe Enamel Torsion Inducing Factor(ETIF) is a substance that induces Enamel Torsion of the teeth, distorting the dental moment. ETIF on Dentaimos distorts the temporal dental moment, 240 seconds for 1g of teeth.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:image-block-base name=http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/draft:sycop-23-5043/Dentistry_Temporal_Anomalies.png|caption=Site-871 Tempodental Anomalies \nDepartment|width=200px|link=#|align=right]]\nTo achieve this objective, the interstellar probe //Dentaimos// was launched toward SCP-548-KO in 1966. Dentaimos contains approximately 53,000,000 teeth gathered in the step before, all attached with ETIF. These factors will be sequentially activated during Dentaimos' journey. The activation will finish when Dentaimos reaches SCP-548-KO. If successfully activated, the physical distance to SCP-548-KO will decrease by 88%.\n\nMoreover, through retroactive dentaocasuality alteration, humanity will gain a set of four(4) 8th molars. This will increase the number of teeth in humans from 28 to 32 and decrease the psychodental distance to SCP-548-KO by 50%.\n\n> **This objective was successfully achieved in 1995.** Due to the imperfections in the dentocasual alteration, the four additional molars did not fit in normally within the oral cavity, inducing a dental repulsion in humanity's collective unconsciousness. This served a positive effect in later steps.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n+++ **Step 2:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nStep 2 is the generation of a massive dental structure under SCP-1017-KO, pushing it out of the Baseline. This step is led by the Thaumatodentistry and Culinary Departments.\n----\n**Objective 1: Creation of the Oversaturated Dental Field**\n\n[[include component:image-block-base name=http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/draft:sycop-23-5043/Tooththaumatology.png|caption=Site-871 Thaumatodentistry Department|width=200px|link=#|align=right]]\nTo achieve this objective, the space construction vehicle, //Dentase// carrying 392 subjects on board, was launched toward SCP-548-KO in 1996. Dentase repositions all planets of SCP-548-KO from an orbit 1AU away from the object. Following this, all of the subjects' teeth are extracted.[[footnote]] All teeth must be extracted from subjects alive during the process, as the process utilises the EVE within the teeth.[[/footnote]] Then, using 784 teeth per planet, various thaumatodental patterns are drawn. This process attracts dental particulates into SCP-548-KO's vicinity. Within a decade, repulsions between the particulates will expand the oversaturated dental field. This expansion must be controlled so as not to head to earth.\n\n> **This objective was successfully achieved in 2032.**\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n**Objective 2: Inducing psychodental stress on SCP-548-KO**\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\nThis method was used to spread dental meme factors on all Foundation personnel in 1946. The only dentistry-related department in the Foundation was the Culinary Department.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nA dental-anomalous recipe is spread on the internet, causing structurally consistent cavities on the molars of every human. This induces psychodental stress on SCP-548-KO.\n\n> **This objective was successfully achieved in 2035.** Dental practise sales temporarily rose by 430%, but subsequently dropped by 510%. This is presumed to be caused by the irreversible damage inflicted on the molars.\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n\n**Objective 3: Building a massive dental structure via induced dental precipitation**\n\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\nDental resonance communication means to induce repeated, regular, and consistent shocks on the dentin to release psionic waves from the teeth.\n\nDental resonance communication is used for internal communication of Site-871, as Level 5 personnel may access the Site intranet.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nUsing SCP-548-KO, a meme that makes humanity attempt identical dental resonance communication using their incisors. The shock inflicted on the incisors is also transferred to SCP-5940. Because of this, a powerful psionic wave is emitted from SCP-5940. This wave is transmitted to SCP-548-KO. Due to the compromised psychodental stability of SCP-548-KO, the oversaturated dental field is stimulated. As a result, the teeth precipitate as the oversaturated dental field transforms into a regular dental field.\n\nPrecipitation first happens near SCP-548-KO. Consequently, SCP-1017-KO is gradually pushed away by the precipitated teeth. Estimations predict that it will take approximately 35 years to push SCP-1017-KO out of the Baseline completely. Precipitation is meticulously controlled so that the teeth precipitated in the process take the shape of the second molar[[footnote]] The 2nd molar is in the permanent molars. 5th tooth of the permanent teeth.[[/footnote]], ultimately making an absolute tooth shaped like the 2nd molar, that will replace SCP-1017-KO.\n\n> **This objective was successfully achieved in 2095.**\n[[/div]] \n\nAfter accomplishing Stage 2, SCP-5940 and SCP-548-KO will be decommissioned in order. During this process, every tooth in existence will explode. However, as the incisors[[footnote]]Completely extracted during the decommission of SCP-5940.[[/footnote]] and molars have been removed, this explosion will not inflict significant physical damage to humanity. **This process was successfully completed in 2100.**\n\nSubservient damages inflicted upon humanity are recovered under the lead of the Dentospirituality Department and Dental Art Department. The Dentospirituality Department is to remove any remaining dental debris to ensure the continuation of humanity without teeth. The Dental Art Department is to soothe the psychodental damage of humanity. **This process is currently ongoing as of 2101.**\n\nAs SCP-1017-KO gets further away from the Baseline, the number of dental anomalies will decrease accordingly. Therefore, upon completion of the stages above, the Dentistry Department and its relative departments will be disbanded. Dental anti-meme factors are utilised in the disbandment to expunge memories of the Dentistry Department, relative departments, and Site-871 from all Foundation personnel.\n\n[[include component:image-block-base name=http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/draft:sycop-23-5043/_Tooth.jpg|caption=WE WILL GROW|width=250px|link=#|align=center]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[footnoteblock]]",
