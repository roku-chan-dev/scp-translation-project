All information that refers to SCP-5120 is to be kept under Level 5 Clearance. All personnel researching //Fidelis Roma// are prohibited from knowing SCP-5120 exists. At this time //Fidelis Roma// is not aware that The Foundation knows of SCP-5120's existence. Diplomatic relations with //Fidelis Roma// are to be maintained until a way of containing SCP-5120 is found.\n\n\n\n[[size larger]]**Description:**[[/size]] SCP-5120 is the entity that resides on top of SCP-5120-1. SCP-5120 can create perception fields, showing that SCP-5120 is a powerful reality-bender. The area surrounding SCP-5120 is in a constant state of fluctuation. This causes matter to rapidly heal and decay at the same time. Due to the perception filters that SCP-5120 creates, the reality-altering effects are only experienced by those who discover SCP-5120. In erratic increments, a shock wave will be emitted that enhances reality-altering effects. As of the writing of this article, there is no description of SCP-5120's appearance.\n-----\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶Dr. Hornes Final Recording◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#ECECEC ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n= [[size larger]]**__DO NOT READ__**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//[ Dr. Horne can be heard hyperventilating for 1 minute, then begins whispering. ]//\n\n**Dr. Horne:** I finally found what you assholes wanted.
