Something did not make its way through here; no—an ideal was stolen, a dream was broken, and hedge-fund heads rolled as silently as cash spent and money allowed.\n\nThe transaction of emptiness was that of pure necessity, a final product undecided on as humans decide them, but manifested anyway. Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. was a corporation after all, and corporations were designed with human templates, traded on stock measurements. They moved their joints like calculators, their language one of currency and all of the hard metal and paper edges which came with its abstractions and meanings, meanings which curled in on themselves to accentuate compounding interest.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"shadow-text\"]]\n[[=]]\nDo you like working like this?\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fancytext\"]]\nA five pointed query, yes: ask it, pay for it. It started off as a question, and soon, a five sided die was produced. Every employee looked at it namelessly while Robert Carter, thirdmost senior executive, wondered to himself in that moment what their stares really meant, what they were all really doing there.\n\nThe supposed existence in his hands felt off. There was nothing to it, no numbers except those on its faces. Each of its mouths pointed outward, unable to comprehend any digits higher than themselves, unable to add to any meaning unless there were more of them, more ones, twos, threes, and so on—and he didn’t have more. There were no more. They would never be more more more more\n\n[[=]]\nmore\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nmore\nmore\nmore\nmore\nmore\n**more**\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/a-billing-null-factor/Semiotics1.jpeg]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n [[span class =\"dizzy\"]] What’s it all worth now?\n\nMust the line keep going up forever?[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"shadow-text\"]]\n[[=]]\nThat’s the essence of you.\n\nThis is all there is. \n\nExtract, solitary, solution, pollution\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"fancytext\"]]\nPolicy, management, capital, doctrine.
