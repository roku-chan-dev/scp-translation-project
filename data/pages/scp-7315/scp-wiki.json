SCP-7315 will perform upkeep to the Veil without needing direct involvement from the Foundation. It is expected that the use of SCP-7315 will cut the cost of amnestic production by 20%.\n\nIf any of the following events occur, SCP-7315 must be contained using the Archived Containment Procedures:\n\n*  The damaging effects of SCP-7315 outweigh its use as an effective suppressor\n*  The current effects of SCP-7315 decrease or dissipate\n*  Foundation resources restabilize, making usage of SCP-7315 unnecessary\n\nAll Foundation personnel must be exposed to SCP-7315-C, via Mandatory Memetic Inoculation.\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7315/scp-c.mp3\n]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View Archived Containment Procedures\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Archived Containment Procedures:** SCP-7315 is contained through [].aic.[[footnote]]Assigned AI construct to be determined. [[/footnote]] [].aic will continuously generate random, dissonant melodies that are unlikely to be replicated. If any SCP-7315-A instances are found that aren't connected to [].aic, [].aic must be reformatted to allow for stronger connections to the noosphere, attracting the attention of SCP-7315.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7315 is an auditory parasite within the noosphere.[[footnote]]The noosphere is the sum of all human thought.[[/footnote]] SCP-7315 attaches itself to melodies, designated SCP-7315-A, and connects to human hosts via SCP-7315-A instances.\n\nSCP-7315 is highly adaptive, targeting popular melodies and adjusting itself to gain a higher infection rate. Due to the highly adaptive nature of SCP-7315, it has evolved to minimize any noticeable effects, in an effort to avoid containment. (See Incident-7315.A1)\n\nInfected individuals, designated as SCP-7315-B instances, experience severe auditory hallucinations of SCP-7315-A, a compulsion to recreate or mimic SCP-7315-A, and an unconscious adherence to rhythmic thought and movement.\n\nThese changes lead to a decrease in risk-taking, an increase in repetitive actions,[[footnote]]This includes increased use of catchphrases, a faster formation of habits, and little to no deviation from a daily routine[[/footnote]] and a decrease in critical thinking.\n\nSCP-7315-C is an mp3 file that grants the listener immunity to SCP-7315 and all related SCP-7315-A instances, discovered during an investigation into SCP-7315. (See Origins)\n\nAttempts to detach SCP-7315 from SCP-7315-A instances or reverse its effects on SCP-7315-B instances have been inconclusive and ineffective.\n\n\n\n**Discovery / Incident-7315.A1:** SCP-7315 was first discovered on June 12, 2022, following multiple cases of seizures and comas with affected individuals rapidly vibrating at a speed and rhythm capable of reproducing SCP-7315-A1.  \n\nDue to its rapid spread and crippling effects, SCP-7315 was designated as a Level-1 Priority[[footnote]]Level-1 Priorities require immediate attention and are usually coupled with a K-Class Scenario.[[/footnote]] and assigned to multiple high-priority researchers. SCP-7315 was classified as a highly viral memetic infohazard and Protocol-193[[footnote]]Protocol-193 demands the expungement of infohazardous digital media and the use of Artificial Intelligence Constructs to process and analyze the anomaly.[[/footnote]] was enacted on SCP-7315-A1.\n\nAll infected individuals ceased vibration after approximately 48 hours and expended all available energy.[[footnote]]Vibrations persisted for up to 32 hours after brain death, using more energy than the human body had available.[[/footnote]] SCP-7315-A1 and SCP-7315-B1 instances continued to spread a version of SCP-7315 that perpetuated its severe effects. All -B1 instances were incinerated and conceptual integration was used to pair SCP-7315-A1 with a memetic kill agent to prevent a similar incident. It's theorized that due to the sudden loss of SCP-7315-B instances, SCP-7315 quickly evolved causing a significant drop in the lethality and severity of its anomalous effects. Several SCP-7315-A instances have appeared since then with minimal damaging and noticeable effects.\n\nSince then, SCP-7315 was downgraded to a Level-6 (Passive Attention) Priority.\n\n**Origins:** SCP-7315 was traced to an unflagged AWCY music forum. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that a small group of AWCY members constructed SCP-7315 as an attack on mainstream media over the course of several months. The following conversation depicts the first usage of SCP-7315, a digital version of SCP-7315's inner workings, and SCP-7315-C:\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**chrushedspirit:** [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]]As per Protocol-193, all information regarding SCP-7315-A1 has been expunged.[[/footnote]]\nit's like listening to a woodchuck go through a woodchipper\n\n**dyserrack:** bet those woodchucks could only count to 4/4\n\n**B:** all these pop songs just sound the same. the ones that pander to depression are probably the worst tho\n\n**chrushedspirit:** it's depressing that a majority of people will never know actual good music\n\n**dyserrack:** yeah, there's no skill in any of this. just mumble into the mic and hire a producer to fix it\n\n**insert_selfinsert:** Hey @B, is it done yet?\n\n**B:** Yeah, I'm almost done with it.\nOperation: \"Damn the Mainstream\" is underway ;)\n\n**insert_selfinsert:** if they want to rot their brains, we might as well speed up the process\n\n**B:** listen to the audio\n//Attachments:// earworm.acb[[footnote]]Artifical Conceptual Builder File[[/footnote]], hearme.mp3[[footnote]]SCP-7315-C[[/footnote]]\n\n**B:** damn normies won't know what hit 'em\n\n**dyserrack:** bro wtf did you do\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ **Containment Log**\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** James Crowley ([# james.crowley@scip.net])\n**From:** Karolyn Vittnner ([# karolyn.vittnner@scip.net])\n**Subject:** Additional Projects\n[[/div]]\n------\nDear Containment Specialist James Crowley,\n\nIn addition to your other projects, you have also been assigned to SCP-████, SCP-7315, and SCP-████. Due to the increased number of high-priority situations the Foundation faces and the recent staff shortage, you will be working alone on SCP-7315 and SCP-████ and in a small team of two on SCP-████. Despite these shortcomings, containment plans must be in place by the end of the quarter. We may have a shortage, but that is no excuse to slack off.  \n\n\n-Site Director Vittnner\n//Secure.

There are visible bags under his eyes]//\n\n**Crowley:** Hello, this is Specialist Crowley regarding containment notes on SCP-7315.\n\n//[Crowley looks through an unorganized collection of papers on his desk. He picks one up.]//\n\n**Crowley:** I've spent hours looking through everything the Foundation has on the noosphere. I'm leaving a reading list for anyone else that wants it, but I'll paraphrase.\n\n//[Crowley takes a deep breath and sips from a cup of coffee.]//\n\n**Crowley:** SCP-7315 operates on a highly reactive form of intellectual Darwinism. It constantly adapts to make as many -A instances as possible. So it has to have a preference.\n\n//[He taps his finger on his desk]//\n\n**Crowley:** So I'm going to collect data on the -A instances. I set up an audio recorder to record whenever it registers a -A instance nearby. Since I'm protected against the anomaly, I'll just listen to music while I work on other projects and we'll see the running thread...\n\n//[Crowley trails off and appears to be lost in thought]//\n\n**Crowley:** //(mumbles)// I should probably look into music theory as well\n\n//[Crowley stares absentmindedly at his papers for two minutes. He then looks up and reads the time. He sighs and throws his head back in his chair]//\n\n**Crowley:** I'm so tired.\n\n------\n**Feedback:** This is a reminder to all Foundation personnel involved in containment to focus on effective containment that requires minimal human supervision. The usage of automation and self-containment are highly encouraged.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this log, an audio recorder was repurposed to log instances of SCP-7315-A. It was designed to identify audio with SCP-7315's infosignature and record related SCP-7315-A instances in an effort to gauge a pattern with -A instances and evaluate SCP-7315's tendencies. This audio recorder, dubbed the \"Singnature Recorder\", was kept on Crowley's person at all times.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 8/15/2022\n**Instance:** SCP-7315-A5\n**Song Name:** Loretta by Ginger Root\n**Context:** Driving home after a late night.\n------\n\n//[A5 is played on Specialist Crowley's car radio. Crowley is singing along. All sounds are muffled.]//\n\n\n**Crowley:** //(Singing)// How are supposed to carry on?\n\n//[A5 continues to play, Crowley notices the \"Singnature Recorder\"]//\n\n**Crowley:** Oh, it works!\n\n//[Sounds of rummaging, all sounds get louder.]//\n\n**Crowley:** Uh, this is Loretta by Ginger Root, some good stuff, you should listen to it.\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Crowley:** Wait no, DON'T listen to this unless you're inoculated. Not until it's contained. It-\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Crowley:** //[Sighs.]// Okay, I'll wake up early tomorrow to get the SCP-███4 project done. Then I'll meet with the SCP-███7 team. Then I can ask Keller about the music shit.\n\n//[Pause. A5 warps up.]//\n\n**Crowley:** I can do this. I can balance this.\n\n//[Crowley ends the recording.]//\n[[/div]]\n\n**Update 8/19/22:** A prototype local AI was implemented with the \"Singnature\" Recorder and the SCP-7315 containment log, allowing given SCP-7315-A instances to be recreated through generated audio files in order to isolate the infected musical phrase. This will be implemented into the following recorded -A instance logs.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 8/22/2022\n**Instance:** SCP-7315-A9\n**Song Name:** Wyvern by The HasBeens\n**Context:** Working with the SCP-███7 crew.

I don't think the liquid nitrogen is a long-lasting containment method.\n\n**McKenna:** Well, we've got to do something. O4 Council is still sitting on our proposal to use SCP-████ as a power source.\n\n//[Crowley notices the recording.]//\n\n**Crowley:** Oh, can you tell me what song you're listening to?\n\n**McKenna:** Hm? Why?\n\n**Crowley:** It's for another anomaly I'm doing.\n\n**McKenna:** Alright, it's Wyvern by The HasBeens. Is that all you need?\n\n**Crowley:** Yeah, sorry I just have so many other skips I gotta get done and-\n\n**McKenna:** Yeah, I know. We all do. I've got seven other meetings today, so if we're going to stay off-topic, I'll leave.\n\n**Crowley:** Oh, sorry.\n\n**McKenna:** It's fine.

Crowley's writing into a notebook.]//\n\n**Crowley:** //(muttering)// ...not enough data. Some kind of bias...\n\n//[Crowley notices the recorder.]//\n\n**Crowley:** Oh great, another one. Is it the lo-fi? (groans) I don't know much about music theory and I haven't looked into it too much, but here's what I got.\n\n//[Papers shuffled.]//\n\n**Crowley:** SCP-7315 relies on songs being catchy and memorable to spread, and all the -A instances logged so far share that style of repetition and lack of resolve. Resolve as in the song doesn't end in a satisfying way, so I've got two plans.\n\n**Crowley:** Plan one is non-intrusive, by taking something that sounds absolutely horrible and forcing that into the conceptual link between SCP-7315 and SCP-7315-A. That should get 7315 uninterested, severing the connection and returning the song to a non-anomalous state.\n\n**Crowley:** Second, the intrusive approach, is to make some kind of solution to all music. Some way to make sure all songs resolve so well that they can't be repeated in someone's head.\n\n**Crowley:** Now, I'm taking the first plan because I don't know enough about music to be confident in the second one, but if anyone listening has any type of musical background, I ask that you try this out because I'm not too sure in what I'm doing.\n\n//[Crowley pauses. A15 continues in the background.]//\n\n**Crowley:** Y'know, this is the only solo project I have, and it's in a subject I don't know jack about. I've asked for assistance multiple times, but you guys keep ignoring me. I'm not cut out for this.\n\n//[A15 continues.]//\n\n**Crowley:** I just want a break.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+ FOUNDATION ALERT:\n\nAll personnel must review mandatory memetic inoculations due to recent changes.
