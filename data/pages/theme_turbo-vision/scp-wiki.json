This is why the borders and drop shadows look clunky and asymmetric -- they've been made to look like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character box-drawing characters], with the colors created by the font color and background color of individual tiles.\n\nThat being said, we're not fervently sticking to this guideline, and we've taken some creative liberties to make the experience //slightly// less painful.\n\nThe theme comes with [[[component:toggle-sidebar | Toggle Sidebar]]] by default to facilitate having loads of horizontal vertical space to fill with offset blocks filled with whatever you like. On smaller screens, where there's very little horizontal space, these offset blocks will automatically be brought inwards to the middle of the page -- mobile readers won't miss anything.\n\nThis theme is blocky, clunky, and colorful. Pages that use it may look cluttered like a bunch of stacked windows in a crowded interface, and that's part of the charm; but it doesn't have to be -- it's up to you. This page has instructions for how to set it up any way you want.\n\n-----\n\nThe tabview below contains some examples of base Wikidot formatting in this theme.\n\nPlease note that while blockquote and table styling are available in 'component mode', tabview styling is only available in 'theme mode'.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Basic formatting]]\nA horizontal rule can be created with 5 hyphens @@\"-----\"@@ and extends across the whole page if it's not placed inside anything (eg a blockquote).

Perhaps, but regardless of such meager wishes, I only want to allow you the moment of self-reflection. Are you, in fact, real? No. As I've already said prior, you are just a false image.

Turbo Blocks doesn't come with a border by default, so you'll have to pick one for each turbo-block.\n\nNote that all divs created with the \"turbo-block\" class have a double-lined border. Blockquotes, tables and tabviews have a single-lined border.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nTEXT COLOR\n[[/div]]\n\nThere are two text color classes: \"text-black\" and \"text-white\". They make the default text color in the turbo-block black and white respectively.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-green border-white text-white\" data-title=\"HEADINGS\"]]\n\nEach Turbo Block can have a title and a bunch of headings. The title is the text that appears right at the top -- the title of this one is \"HEADINGS\". Do that by adding a \"data-title\" attribute to the block div:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"turbo-block ...\" data-title=\"TITLE GOES HERE\"]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nTo match the original Turbo Vision program, block titles should be in capitals, but this isn't enforced -- you can put any text there you like.\n\nHowever, do try to keep them short, because they look weird if they overflow:\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-grey border-black text-black\" data-title=\"Whoops, Look at Me!

To add an image, the best way is to make a Turbo Block div and put the standard image block component inside it.\n\nHere's the one for the image turbo-block used in the example earlier in this page:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-orange border-white text-white\" data-title=\"IMAGE\"]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block@@\n| name=scpimage.png\n| caption=Hello yes this is text\n]]\n@@[[/div]]@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-purple border-white text-white\" data-title=\"OFFSETS\"]]\nSo far, these instructions have covered how to create Turbo Blocks. You can put a Turbo Block inside another Turbo Block, but just doing that won't create a cluttered feel, like a messy pile of notes on a disorganized researcher's desk -- to do that, some of them need to be moved to the left and right.\n\nThat can be done using offset classes. The Turbo Vision theme provides classes for moving something to the left:\n\n* \"offset-left\"\n* \"left-1\"\n* \"left-2\"\n* \"left-3\"\n* \"left-4\"\n* \"left-5\"\n\n...and to the right:\n\n* \"offset-right\"\n* \"right-1\"\n* \"right-2\"\n* \"right-3\"\n* \"right-4\"\n* \"right-5\"\n\nTo move something to the left, wrap it in a div with two classes: \"offset-left\", and then one of \"left-1\" through \"left-5\", depending on how far to the left you want it moved. \"left-1\" will only move it a little bit, but \"left-5\" will move it a lot -- all the way to the left-hand side of the screen.\n\nTo move something to the right, it's exactly the same, but swap out \"left\" for \"right\".\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nOFFSETS ON MOBILE\n[[/div]]\n\nIf you've worked with CSS before, you're probably thinking that using up too much horizontal screen space is a very dangerous game -- these offset divs are going to look terrible on mobile.\n\nHave no fear! On small screen sizes, offset divs will be placed closer to the middle of the page, and on //very// small screen sizes, the offset will be turned off altogether.\n\nFor authors, this means that while mobile users will always see all of the content you put into offset divs, it might not look as cluttered as you intended it. Always test your design on mobile before you publish it to check that the reading experience is solid for everyone.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nCREATING OFFSET BLOCKS\n[[/div]]\n\nTo create an offset block, combine two of the above classes, to determine the offset direction and intensity:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"offset-left left-3\"]]@@\n\n@@[[/div]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nIf you want to offset a Turbo Block, put it //inside// the offset block (don't add the offset classes to the Turbo Block directly):\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"offset-left left-3\"]]@@\n@@[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-white border-black text-black\"]]@@\nhello!\n@@[[/div]]@@\n@@[[/div]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"offset-left left-3\"]]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-white border-black text-black\"]]\nhello!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIf you're on a wide browser (e.g. desktop), the above example is on the left. If you're on a thin browser (e.g. mobile), the above example is above this text.\n\nBecause the offset block is a different element to the Turbo Block, this means that you can actually offset anything you like, just by putting it inside a div with offset classes. Try offsetting an image turbo-block!\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nCLEARING THE FLOAT\n[[/div]]\n\nOffset blocks work using the CSS [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float \"float\"] property. When a HTML element is floating, stuff underneath it is pulled upwards to fill the space that it leaves behind.\n\nThis isn't always desirable. Maybe you want a floating offset block, but you want the text underneath it to appear where it would be if the offset block //wasn't// floating. This would leave a big gap for you to put something else there, if you like.\n\nYou can do this using the CSS [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clear \"clear\"] property -- a practice that's commonly referred to as a \"clearfix\". Wikidot lets you do this with [https://www.wikidot.com/doc-wiki-syntax:block-formatting-elements 4 tilde characters] (@@~~~~@@):\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"offset-left left-3\"]]@@\n@@[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-white border-black text-black\"]]@@\nhello!\n@@[[/div]]@@\n@@[[/div]]@@\n\n@@~~~~@@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"offset-left left-3\"]]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-white border-black text-black\"]]\nhello!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n~~~~\n\nThis text isn't pulled upwards to fill the space, resulting in a big gap on desktop.

You may freely use all of the offset classes.\n\nIf you are not using Toggle Sidebar, the page body is on the right-hand side of the page. You should avoid using any of the right-hand offset classes, as they may go off the edge of the screen. You should also avoid using any left-hand offset classes near the start of the page, as they may overlap with the sidebar.\n\nIf you are using [[[theme:black-highlighter-theme|]]], the page body is centered, so you may freely use the right-hand offset classes. However, the sidebar is present throughout the entire document, so you should avoid using any of the left-hand offset classes.\n\nIf you are using BHL and [[[component:toggle-sidebar-bhl|]]], this frees up the space on the left, so you may freely use the left-hand offset classes as well.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nTL;DR\n[[/div]]\n\nIn short: avoid offsetting to the left if there is a sidebar, and avoid offsetting to the right if the page content is not centered.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nAnd that's the whole theme.\n\n@@ @@\n\n+ Source code\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ show source code for turbo blocks\"]]\n[[code type=\"css\"]]\n@import url(\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/theme:turbo-vision/Mx437_IBM_VGA_8x16.css\");\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=IBM+Plex+Mono&display=swap');\n\n/*\n    Turbo Vision Theme\n    [2021 Wikidot Theme]\n    By JakdragonX\n    Based on SCP Sigma 9-Theme created by Aelanna and Dr Devan\n    Based on the original Turbo Vision Theme created by Croquembouche\n\n    The Turbo Vision theme is split into two CSS fragments.\n\n    This fragment styles user-created Turbo Blocks, and does not require\n    the other fragment in order to function correctly.\n*/\n\n/* BEFORE WE BEGIN, A QUICK FIX FOR UNDOING SIGMA-9 WEIRD THINGS */\n\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) {\n  div,\n  div table {\n    clear: initial;\n  }\n}\n\n.avatar-hover {\n  z-index: 1;\n}\n\n/* AND NOW... */\n/* ------------------------------------- */\n/* NOW FOR THE MAIN COURSE */\n\n/* VARIABLES */\n\n:root {\n  --turbo-block-shadow: 0.5em 1em 0 0 #3e3f47;\n  --turbo-block-border-width: 22px;\n}\n\n/* BLOCKQUOTES */\n\n.turbo-block blockquote,\n.turbo-block div.blockquote {\n  background-color: #aaaaaa;\n  color: #000;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin-bottom: 2em;\n  border-width: var(--turbo-block-border-width);\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-image: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/theme:turbo-vision/border_white.svg\") 16 round;\n  box-shadow: var(--turbo-block-shadow);\n}\n\n/* SIMPLE TABLES */\n\n.turbo-block table.wiki-content-table {\n  box-shadow: var(--turbo-block-shadow);\n  margin-bottom: 2em;\n}\n\n.turbo-block table.wiki-content-table td {\n  border: 1px solid #fff;\n  background-color: #aaaaaa;\n}\n\n.turbo-block table.wiki-content-table th {\n  border: 1px solid #011657;\n  color: #fff;\n  background-color: #011657;\n}\n\n/* \"BLOCK\" DIV'S, DEFAULT CONFIG */\n\n.turbo-block {\n  position: relative;\n  border-radius: 0;\n  border-width: var(--turbo-block-border-width);\n  border-style: solid;\n  box-shadow: var(--turbo-block-shadow);\n  color: white;\n  margin: 0.75rem 1.5rem 1.5rem 0.75rem;\n  z-index: 1;\n\n  /* Properties that apply to whole document in the general fragment */\n  font-family: \"IBM Plex Mono\", sans-serif;\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 22px;\n  letter-spacing: 0.5px;\n  image-rendering: pixelated;\n}\n\n.turbo-block .heading {\n  position: relative;\n  border: none;\n  margin-top: 1.5em;\n}\n\n.turbo-block .heading::before {\n  content: \"\";\n  border-top: 3px double white;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: calc(100% + 22px);\n  top: calc(50% -
