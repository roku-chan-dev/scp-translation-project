We need to protect our people.[[/footnote]]. The anomaly is currently at risk of unauthorized neutralization by Foundation staff members compromised by SCP-8992's anomalous properties. Unaffected staff located at Site-216 are tasked with the preservation of the anomaly, which is currently in hiding; staff are currently unauthorized to respond to anomalously compromised individuals with lethal force, but this is under constant review. All orders received from former Site Co-Director Cummings are to be disregarded.\n\nUntil the current situation is resolved, Site-216 is operating at drastically reduced capabilities. All research and tasks unrelated to SCP-8992, other than essential containment of other anomalies, have been suspended. Long term containment plans are currently undetermined.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8992 is Foundation Junior Researcher Ezra Johannsen, aged 27. SCP-8992’s idiopathic anomalous properties manifested on 23 June. Its anomalous property is that individuals will regard Junior Researcher Johannsen as a corpse. Any evidence to the contrary is either undetectable or will be dismissed by compromised individuals: \n* They appear unable to perceive any attempts at communication by SCP-8992, including speech and written text;\n* Locomotion by SCP-8992 is either not perceived, or perceived as resulting from assistance granted by non-affected individuals;\n* Evidence of SCP-8992’s liveness will be dismissed, often in an irate and aggressive manner; \n* Affected individuals have been shown to misremember relevant events, including the actions of non-affected individuals regarding SCP-8992.\n\nAll medical tests run on SCP-8992 support the argument that the anomaly is not a corpse.[[footnote]] As if the fact he’s walking and talking isn’t enough.[[/footnote]] Testing has been halted due to the endangerment of SCP-8992’s safety and health. See below timeline for further details.\n\nNot all individuals are susceptible to SCP-8992’s effects. It is estimated 52% of Site-216’s staff are affected and perceive Junior Researcher Johannsen as a corpse. This estimate cannot be trusted – it is currently believed certain individuals onsite perceive the anomaly as a corpse, but claim otherwise in an attempt to aid in the “corpse”’s destruction.[[footnote]] We’re on to you.

Director Cummings enters. Johannsen lies on a medical gurney, he appears anxious. Electrode pads linked to an EKG machine are attached to his chest. Director Cameron stands next to him.\n\nCameron presents Cummings with the results of medical tests -- including blood analysis, brain scans, and responsive tests -- which conclusively prove Johannsen's liveness.\n\nThese are all dismissed by Cummings. An argument ensues between the two staff. Johannsen remains on the gurney, unable to move and join the conversation due to the EKG pads.\n\nCameron directs Cummings to the EKG screen displaying Johannsen's heartrate. The argument escalates. Cummings arms himself with a scalpel and paces towards Johannsen. The latter recoils.\n\nCameron attempts to grab Cummings, but throws him off balance. He falls forward, and the scalpel severs Johannsen's right thumb.\n\nJohannsen screams. He disconnects himself from the EKG machine, and flees the room. Cameron follows. Immediately following this incident, both Cameron and Cummings issue sitewide communications disavowing one another and claiming sole leadership of the Site.[[footnote]] Given the obvious anomalous compromising of Cummings, Site leadership would have fallen to Cameron regardless.

Situation currently ongoing.**\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n\n= [[size 150%]] **Addendum 001: SCP-8992 Interview Log** [[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n**Foreword:** The following interview was arranged by Site Co-Director Eleanor Cameron to document Johannsen’s own recollection of events, and the psychological impact of SCP-8992 upon him.\n\n------\n//[Junior Researcher Johannsen is sat at the interview room table, opposite Director Cameron. His right hand is bandaged.]//\n\n**Cameron:** Given what’s just happened… are you sure you want to do this today, Ezra?\n\n**Johannsen:** I- I’m sure. My name is Junior Researcher Ezra Johannsen. I’ve been employed by the Foundation, at Site-216, for six years. On June 23, I, myself, became an anomaly. I felt no change. I was in the site cafeteria, sat at a table... and suddenly people started screaming.\n\n**Cameron:** What for?\n\n**Johannsen:** For medical aid. Medical aid, for me. Half the people I was sat with – friends, colleagues I’ve known since I joined – thought… they thought I was dead. \n\n//[Johannsen, agitated, hits the table with his fist.]//\n\n**Johannsen:** The other half, people like you, Director Cameron, could see that I, quite clearly, was not. Someone came over, pushed me to the floor, tried to do compressions on my chest. It hurt. It hurt a lot. Someone else pulled them off me and it just, it just escalated. People wouldn’t listen, they wouldn’t listen to me, nor you, nor anyone. You grabbed me by the arm, and pulled me out of there, along with some others who were – hopefully still are – unaffected.\n\n**Cameron:** It's just... escalated from there.\n\n//[Johannsen begins to pull back the bandages from his hand. He fights back tears.]//\n\n**Johannsen:** Look what they did to me. I'm maimed. I liked Director Cummings, I sat next to him at the Christmas party. But he... he hurt me. He hurt me so much.\n\n**Cameron:** And, I think we should talk about today. I think you should record what happened.\n\n**Johannsen:** I’ve been hiding since then. Or more accurately, you’ve all been hiding me. But today, I was on my way back from the commissary with two people I trusted. I know I shouldn’t have gone, but I was craving something sweet, I needed some kind of pick-me-up. But the other group saw me. Someone shouted: “I’ve found it!” It. //It// stung. The next thing I know I’m running, but I’m too slow – they’re on me, and I was screaming, but they were dragging me. And I kept screaming and screaming but there were too many of them. And then I realized where they were taking me. To the crematorium. They wanted to burn me, Ellie. They wanted to burn me alive.\n\n**Cameron:** Ezra…\n\n//[Cameron stands, and walks around to Johannsen. She bends down and hugs him.]//\n\n**Johannsen:** But you, and the others, found me. Thank god you found me, just in time. But I don’t know how much more of this I can take. \n\n//[Johannsen begins to cry. His tears dampen Cameron’s shoulder.]//\n\n**Cameron:** It’s okay. That’s enough for today, I think. Let’s get you out of here.\n\n//[Still embraced, Cameron helps Johannsen from his chair, and accompanies him from the room.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 45%; float:right;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .1em .1em; text-align: left; border: 3px solid white; background-color: #D70040; width: 45%;\"]]\n##ffffff|**{{USER.ID: N.Cummings}}**##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .1em .1em; text-align: left; background-color: #E5E4E2; width: 45%;\"]]\n{{EDIT LOCK OVERRIDDEN}}\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n= **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8992/offset/2|A new version of this document is available.
