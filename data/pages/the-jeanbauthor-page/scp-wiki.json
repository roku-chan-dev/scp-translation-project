fascinated with Dawiki\nWith the grand tapestry of the place at first\nBut above all with the people of Dawiki.\n\nXXVI.\n\nThey were many in number\nAnd countless in perspective\nAnd The Sun and the Coming of The Dawn came to love them from afar.\n\nXXVII.\n\nAt first The Sun and the Coming of The Dawn observed them\nContent simply to marvel at their many talents\nAnd to be engrossed in their tales.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nBut with time They felt a compulsion to understand Dawiki\nAnd to count Themself among its many peoples\nAnd so They approached the people and made Themself known.\n\nXXIX.\n\nOne day in the tenth month of the year they approached the people of Dawiki\nThey made Themself known in the largest commons of the kingdom\nAnd began to converse with the people.\n\nXXX.\n\nThey spoke at length with the people of Dawiki\nFrom the grandest viziers to the humblest townsfolk\nAnd came to love them ever more.\n\nXXXI.\n\nThe people of Dawiki were acommodating\nMany offered The Sun and the Coming of The Dawn their aid\nThe wise apostle [[*user diogene_s]] and the jovial journalist [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] and the esoteric cryptid [[*user IndustryStandard]] and many more besides.\n\n...\n\nXLIII.\n\nThe Sun and the Coming of The Dawn sought to contribute to the grand tapestry\nThe great work of shared artistic fabric that all in the kingdom held in common\nSo They set to work weaving Their yarn.\n\nXLIV.\n\nWith a great deal of aid from the many peoples of DawikiThey spun Their first tale\nA thing of wonder and intrigue in the mundane and ignored\nAnd it was met with love and appreciation.\n\nXLV.\n\nThe Sun and the Coming of The Dawn knew that it would not be Their last\nThey had much to share and much to share in\nAnd They would count Themselves as one of
