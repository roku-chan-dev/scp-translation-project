Due to Chappell's increasing age, both his mental and physical wellness rapidly deteriorated during his confinement. In his last few years, he was a shell of his former self, often ranting to himself about topics no one else quite understood, or lost in his own memories. What follows is a short collection of some of his more outrageous statements, collected by his personal nurses.\n\n> \"I don't trust no man who drinks water. Fish fuck in that stuff, see?\"\n\n> \"I don't think children should be heard //or// seen. Fuck 'em. No children.\"\n\n> \"You know, I saw some kid putting ketchup on his hot dog today. Really pissed me off.\"\n> \n>\n>\n> \"I killed him.\"\n\n> \"You know who I don't trust? Women. And men are on THIN FUCKING ICE!\"\n\n> \"Is it still okay to say Oriental? I can't remember.\"\n\n> \"You know what I hate? Clowns. Fuck them and fuck their milk.\"\n\n> \"I went to the soup kitchens the other day because I got a bit peckish and didn't want to buy anything. Saw a lot of Italians there. We sure do live in a society.\"\n\n> \"When I was younger, my mother used to put a thermometer in my ass. I rather enjoyed that.\"\n\n> \"Saw a man kiss another man the other day. Awful brave of him.\"\n\n> \"They say it's a bad idea, but has anyone really //tried// to put cocaine up their ass?\"\n\n> \"I used to kill rats with a baseball bat. Still do. Just use a cricket bat now. Wider range.\"\n\n> \"What the fuck is cricket? One of them Irish sports?\"\n\n> \"You know those holes in the bottoms of barrels? Got my schlong stuck in one of them once.\"\n\n> \"You know what? Fuck Faeries. I oughta give them a whack with an iron bat if they don't shut up about being oppressed.\"\n\n> \"I met a gay robot today. Cool.\"\n\n> \"Gave Chester Williams a skull for his birthday. Didn't seem to like it. Shame. I liked that skull.\"\n\n> \"I met this stupid doctor guy, somehow he only spoke in lowercase letters. I don't know how that works, but he does. Fuck him anyways.\"\n\n> \"Hookers don't bleed if you freeze them first.\"\n\n> \"I remember when I was one of the Sea People. Got the gills and everything.\"\n\n> \"If you soak the bullets in whiskey, they scream longer.\"\n\n> \"Some dumbass served me thin-crust the other day. Said real pizza shouldn't have so much marinara. Now he don't have so much marinara in him anymore.\"\n\n> \"I went to a threesome one time. The girl never showed up. But Mama didn't raise no quitter.\"\n\n> \"Everybody always comes to tell me, 'ey, you see the boners in the paper today? fine stuff' but buddy, I don't need no paper to check out some boners.\"\n\n> \"Why don't homeless people just buy a house?\"\n\n> \"Hey! I can wipe my own ass! Fuck off!\"\n\n> \"I had a goldfish. He's going to live forever. I know that because he never sinks to the bottom and drowns.\"\n\n> \"So, I was shooting up heroin behind the Spirit. That's it. That's the end of the story.\"\n\n> \"You know who I hate? People without eyelids. Granted, I'm usually the reason they don't have eyelids, but still.\"\n\n> \"Why don't orphans just buy a parent?\"\n\n> \"THERE WAS A PETTING ZOO YESTERDAY AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?!\"\n\n> \"Listen, son, when I was your age, we didn't call a man who wanted to dress up like a coyote and have sex with another man dressed up like a bear a 'furry'. We didn't call that man anything at all. That was just poker night.\"\n\n> \"Look, I'm not gay, but a full set of adult human teeth is a full set of adult human teeth.\"\n\n> \"You kicked the wrong dicksucker!\"\n\n> \"Fuck the disabled, they're goddamn beautiful and horny as hell!\"\n\n> \"Saw a black man with a white woman today. The world is truly cruel. Why do the gals get all the good ones?\"\n\n> \"Do they still do full body bone replacements? My spine itches.\"\n\n> \"They call me Dick Chappell 'cause the whole congregation comes in to worship.\"\n\n> \"I tried to pet a cat today. It bit me. Now it lives in the river.\"\n\n> \"I don't get why people say cognitohazards are so bad. Like, just look away from the paper.\"\n\n> \"Psst, hey, guard, want to snort some crack?\"\n\n> \"I think I might be gay.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** dickchap.png\n> **Name:** Mug shot of Walter Smith, 15 December 1924, location unknown.\n> **Author:** New South Wales.
