And by that I mean that I like to stretch the limits of what a coat of arms can represent. And this time I decided to turn the coat into a nice little 'guitar'. One of taylor_itkin's best known qualities, at least to me, is his musicality. And therefore the entire shield is now guitar-like. I chose to include unicorns because of his [[[dr-taylor-itkin-s-personnel-file| author page]]]. And yes, those grey things are the strings. \n\n**How the prompt fits in:** I have said and will say this some more, but this was a hard prompt. At first I tried to use Pick as a verb, but that gave me no inspiration at all. When I tried to approach the noun side of the prompt, I first ended up with the mining tool. Only when I interpreted the prompt as 'plectrum' did I get a good idea. The pick has ended up where every pick will end up some day, as you can see.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-9-pressure| Day 9: Pressure]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-11-sour| Day 11: Sour]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** taylor_itkin.png\n> **Name:** taylor_itkin\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\ntaylor_itkin.png is a composite.
