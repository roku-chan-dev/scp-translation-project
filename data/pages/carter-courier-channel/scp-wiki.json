Staffed utilizing revolutionary operational approaches, the product allows for the continued maintenance of ingress and egress of foreign material into the United States of America and of domestic goods onto the international market. This -- paired with the sanitizing properties of crude portal technology -- allows entrepreneurs globally to rent the product for their needs and remain active players on the US market in spite of [[[kte-9817-bluebuster-mendel-shelley-renegade-armbrusteri|GOC-mandated US quarantine]]], resulting in the prevention of the total economic collapse of the country and the world at large. ||\n||||~ Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd.||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||||||||~ Internal MC&D Report||\n||~ Author || Robert Carter (Project Lead) ||~ Date || March 1, 2049||\n||~ Interest||High||~ Identifier||Carter Courier Channel||\n||||||||Teleporting people is hard. You can't just dissolve someone and rebuild them from the ground up using their matter -- it'd be equivalent to half-justified murder. The only actual alternative -- quite literally bending the fabric of space-time to bring two places together -- isn't //just// difficult; it's expensive, both for the client and the provider. It's dangerous, time-consuming, and unprofitable. In the long term, teleportation is a venue used only for the most extreme of journeys -- those [[[david-hunt-on-galileo|quite literally out of this world]]]. _\n _\nBut teleporting mere product? That's a whole story entirely. It doesn't have a soul to kill, no spirit to squeeze out of it as you unmake and remake it through the crudest of ways -- all it takes to get one thing from one place to another is a well-realized setup and technology that has been known to man since the early 19th century. So, why hasn't anyone done it before, on a scale that could revolutionize world trade? The answer is nobody could afford it. Changing the entire infrastructure of an unwilling world has always been an unmanageable task, one that would be far from profitable. Until now. _\n _\nWith the advent of the US quarantine, one thing became apparent to the world: the old means of transport are gone. What remained was to either die or adapt -- and to adapt they all sought, all companies from around the world, hoping to find any way they could still participate in the market in spite of the Coalition-mandated Pizzicato. D24CF/S54CX/4MR8L is our solution to this issue. A single, unified way to save the world, under our taxable guidance. A single way to keep the money flowing to every corner of the world in spite of our circumstances, rentable to any and all companies willing to remain alive. _\n _\nUtilizing crude portal technology, D24CF/S54CX/4MR8L not only transports goods from one place to another -- it also makes them perfectly sterile. Brute-forcing your way through the fabric of spacetime kills everything that's meaningfully alive within the packet -- a property quite useful when it comes to ensuring that the Washington Virion, the sole perpetrator of this whole mess, never spreads with the spread of the goods to the global market. ||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| D24CF/S54CX/4MR8L ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd.||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nexus-hyperline/aviatica.png width=\"200px\"]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 450%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; color: #f26c0c;\"]]\n= **AVIATICA**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 120%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;\"]]\n= **With the Wings of Freedom Rings the Bell of Progress**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"color: #f08502; font-family: serif; font-size: 105%; font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-weight: 900;\"]]\n= **07/03/2049 | ISSUE 130, VOLUME 5**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-size: 92%; margin: 2px 0 5px; font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;\"]]\n[[size 400%]]**At What Cost?**[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[==]]\n[[size 120%]]**Though it is impossible to argue that the Carter Courier Channel hasn't played an absolutely crucial role in saving the US economy since the advent of the quarantine, several issues in regards to the whole project still remain unclear at best, and very suspicious at worst.

Because of the Channel -- and recent reforms in China, paired with the ongoing purge of \"technocratic-corporatist elements\" inside CCP structures -- the global economy has remained relatively undisturbed. But among all of those applauses and congratulations to both Mr. Marshall and Mr. Carter that we are seeing more and more of, many have failed to consider a second angle to the whole situation -- one far less optimistic.\n\nFor all of its many advantages, data yielded by the Carter Courier Channel seems to show a very worrying trend in its operations: that, in spite of its capabilities, the network isn't used only for essential goods, as it was advertised when it went live. In spite of Mr. Carter's claims that the Channel would be primarily a tool of bringing food and other goods needed for survival to the people of America, statistics compiled together by the Global Occult Coalition's Electorate of Demomancers show that more than  40% of its trade capacity is currently being used for unrelated business expenses of entrepreneurs worldwide -- expenses that are not required for the survival of America.\n\nDuring peacetime, this should of course be of no concern to anyone -- but to a nation living under a looming Procedure Pizzicato, wholly cut off from the rest of the world, it //does// seem quite weird that there remain several thousands Americans suffering from hunger and lacking basic necessities. It's hard not to notice the staggering shortages of coffee and fruits and vegetables all across the country --  especially when the network that was meant to provide America with said material mainly seems to concern itself with the interests of the wealthiest.\n\n[# Continue reading...]\n\n\n[[/==]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Recording of a 911 call made by one Irene Vesper on 12/03/2049**\n\n-----\n\n**Operator:** 911.

Who the real soldiers, fighting a war so that our great country may keep on standing, are!\n\n//He pauses, and points towards Robert Carter and Skitter Marshall, both standing behind him. A single member of PENTAGRAM personnel comes forward to join Bowe; he is holding a small open chest laid with the American flag, atop which two medals lay.//\n\n**Bowe:** In honor of their extraordinary actions in helping America remain on her feet, on behalf of President Crenshaw, I would like to officially thank misters Carter and Marshall in the name of all Americans, by awarding them with these two humble gifts.\n\n//Bowe nods to the PENTAGRAM member.//\n\n**Bowe:** Gentlemen, please, come forward.\n\n//The audience starts to cheer once more as Bowe personally takes the medals from the box and gives them to the two MC&D CEOs. The general shows Carter to come closer to the microphone, himself joining Marshall in the background.//\n\n//Carter waves to the audience as he approaches.//\n\n**Carter:** Thank you, all! Thank you. It is truly an honor to be standing here before you all -- to be standing before the true America. The one that remains unbent in spite of the attack on its borders. The one that survives, unchanged by the evil of its villains. The one that stays with god and nation, no matter how dark the day!\n\n//The cheers grow louder.//\n\n**Carter:** I could not possibly ask for a higher privilege than to be in my position, to help those who truly care and stay to defend their motherland, until the end of time! But--\n\n//He turns towards Marshall. The lanky man slowly comes forward. Carter puts his hand theatrically on Marshall's shoulder.//\n\n**Carter:** --I cannot possibly take all the credit here. Though it is my name that's attached to the Channel, Skitter is just as much of a hero as you and me. He too has worked days and nights to make sure that his great country gets what it deserves. He even agreed to axe his own name from the Channel's title as to make it fit with our standards -- could you ever imagine a sacrifice greater than his?\n\n//He pauses, and takes his hand away from Marshall.//\n\n**Carter:** So thank you all, for giving us and President Crenshaw your trust. I promise you -- you chose well. History will vindicate us!\n\n//The crowd starts to clap again.//\n\n**Carter:** God bless America!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom2\"]]\n**To:** ##f08502|robertcarterprivate@mcd_official.int##\n**From:** ##f08502|@@ltl35380@ilebi.com@@## \n**Subject:** Fuck you.\n[[/div]]\n------\nCarter,\n\nI think you actually might be the worst person I can think of. Go fuck yourself with a metal rod, you piece of shit. I struggle to imagine how you can live with yourself. How does it feel, to look in the mirror every single day, only to see your face? How does it feel, being aware of what you've done -- of what you're doing! -- every waking moment? I wonder if you'd be just as charismatic as you were last night on TV if you had to look in the eyes of your workers' families and tell them the same things you tried to push onto the whole nation.\n\nI'd tell you to go to hell, but knowing you, they'd welcome you with open arms. Go fuck yourself.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##8c14c8|@@ltl35380@ilebi.com@@## \n**From:** ##8c14c8|robertcarterprivate@mcd_official.int##,\n**Subject:** An invitation\n[[/div]]\n------\nMs. Vesper,\n\nThough I truly doubt you are still using that throwaway email -- come now, don't be surprised I know it's you --  I appreciate the compliment. I really do; I've reached top ten lists before, but to take the crowning spot? Now that's a first.\n\nAs for your actual message: I sleep quite well, really. I sleep just as well as the rest of the world, aware or not -- it's truly hard to care about anything, in a world in  which everybody knows everything about everything. The world's a bitch, and the sooner you'll accept that, the sooner you'll learn how to play at a game you can never lose. That's just how it goes, really, whether you like it or not -- and whiny rants won't change that, no matter how much you try to shout your truths.\n\nHaving said all of that: I am quite impressed by your dedication to the art, if I'm being honest. I've had many political opponents in my life, but very few of them went as far as you did to try and bring me down. They don't make journalists like that anymore. Which is a shame, really; in our job, dedication to giving the public what it wants to hear is paramount, is it not? It's a skillset I think my team could greatly benefit from -- and, having heard about your recent self-brewed troubles at Aviatica, I'm sure that you could use a new paycheck as well. \n\nSo, whenever you're free -- and willing to change your life -- I'd suggest you give me a call. I'm sure your recent shady friends are more than aware of how to reach me, if you just ask them for a number.\n\nCheers,\nCarter\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##8c14c8|robertcarterprivate@mcd_internal.int##, ##8c14c8|skittermarshallprivate@mcd_internal.int##\n**From:** ##8c14c8|irisdarkprivate@mcd_internal.int##\n**Subject:** Further plans\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nI truly cannot believe I am saying this, but excellent job, boys.
