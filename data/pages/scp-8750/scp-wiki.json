SCP-8750 is a Type 4-U Reality Bender.[[footnote]]Type-4 Reality benders have enough power to affect an entire city. The U in Type 4-U stands for unintentional. U Type reality benders can't cantrol their reality bending powers.[[/footnote]]  SCP-8750 is currently contained at Site-97 in Brandon, Florida, where they were working when they entered an anomalous coma.[[footnote]]The coma was deemed anomalous due to the fact that despite normal brain function, all Foundation standard coma resuscitation techniques have ended in failure.[[/footnote]] Relocation of SCP-8750 has been deemed unviable as the manifestation of anomalous properties happens regardless of SCP-8750's location. SCP-8750 has conjured up several spectral entities, designated SCP-8750-1 to SCP-8750-3. The entities manifested by SCP-8750 act out scenarios from SCP-8750's past.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8750’s anomalous nature was found on 2016/12/29 when reports of a child resembling the late Jacob Barker[[footnote]]The son of SCP-8750, whom passed away due to cancer related complications.[[/footnote]], now designated SCP-8750-1 was reported to have been wandering the town aimlessly.  \n\n**Addendum SCP-8750.1** SCP-8750 was found to affect the area around their house.\nReports of SCP-8750-1 led MTF Δ-29 (“Outside the Box”) to the apartment, where they established a temporary on-site location to collect data. Appearances of SCP-8750-1 also contained a second entity, identified to be a spectral version of SCP-8750, designated SCP-8750-2, as well as the occasional appearance of a third entity. This was identified as Dr. Robert Osprey,[[footnote]]SCP-8750-1’s father.[[/footnote]] and is designated SCP-8750-3.\n\n||~ Recorded Date ||~ Entities involved ||~ Recorded Data ||\n|| 2016/12/31 || SCP-8750-1 and SCP-8750-2 || SCP-8750-1 walked around and approached an ice cream truck that appeared during the event.
