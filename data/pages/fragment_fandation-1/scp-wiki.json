Though it seems like this wasn't always the case as acknowledged in Mission Pretty Oddities and Anomalies, where he states he used to carry a rifle rather than a staff.\n\nPersonality wise he is sweet, understanding, and easy to get along. Despite this, Glass is a rather secretive person, with many stating that the doctor struggles to open up to others. Ultimately, not much is currently known about Glass' deeper lore, besides what has been hinted at by other characters and in-game item descriptions. Many believe an update centered around Glass will be coming soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n++ Gameplay\n\nGlass focuses in healing other characters in your party through the use of medical anomalies rather than inflicting direct damage to the enemy.\n\n**Medical Checkup:**\n\nBasic healing ability. Restores a percentage of the target's life, this percentage depends on the current remaining HP of the target. Below 50% the target recovers 25% of its HP, below 75% it recovers 20% and below 100% it recovers 15%\n\n**Un-Authorized SCP-500 deployment:**\n\nGlass' ultimate, completely heals all party members and increases their attack by one stage.\n\n+ Trivia\n\n* Glass has no medical degree nor schooling, it seems unlikely he has a psychology degree.\n\n* Glass does have a degree in military science.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#3a3a3a;font-weight:bold;\"]]8 comments[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Fish^12]] possessedpizzzzah · 9h\n\nMY GLASS PLSUSH GOT TAKN BY A FUCKING HAWK PLEASE IF YOU SEE HM RETUSRN HIM TO ME\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:fandation-1/snatchednurse.png]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user sailorenoch]] flandrec0re · 5h\n\nDeserved for being a glass fan\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user kingofmice]] mousenaynay · 3/29/2025\n\nWhy was glass's age changed from 35 to 2-45?

You are incorrect in both these comments. We know Glass is older than one as he already had his 2nd birthday and dialogue implies they are younger than 45. So is it incorrect to have his age listed as 2-45? I also remember I pulled him in version 1.2\n\n----\n\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user kingofmice]] mousenaynay · 3/29/2025\n\nthis is like talking to a brick wall i guess ill just go back and revert it\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Rustyboltz]] jaundice93 · 3/3/2025\n\nHes actually a really good character for early teams, I know hes been outclassed by his keter counterparts but if you don't want to whale your paycheck on a catgirl hes perfectly fine choice.\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user DrBleep]] ꒰ა♡ yumeshipping_catgirl ♡໒꒱  · 3/3/2025\n\nIf you run him with Space Abigail, then hes not too bad actually, the two compliment each other.
