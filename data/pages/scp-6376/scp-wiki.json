SCP-6376 is contained in a locked garden within Outpost-6376. Approximately every 2 weeks, 10 liters of human blood is to be poured on the soil and roots surrounding SCP-6376.\n\nRitual-6376 is forbidden without express approval by the Ethics Committee.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6376 is a tree of an unknown species with bright red leaves. SCP-6376 requires regular feeding of human blood to survive but has no other environmental requirements. SCP-6376 does not lose its leaves through the changing of seasons, nor does it noticeably grow. Any individual that attempts to harm SCP-6376, through cutting it down or carving into the bark, will hear a voice warning them not to do so, and will receive a debilitating vision if they continue to pursue harming the object.\n\nSCP-6376's \"voice\" is an auditory hallucination resembling human speech that the object produces under certain circumstances, such as Ritual-6376 or if a person attempts to damage it. This hallucination occurs for every human or animal within a 30-meter radius and is not impacted by walls. Individuals who have heard this voice have described it as a deep androgynous voice with gravitas, and an amused tone.\n\nRitual-6376 is a ritual through which SCP-6376 may be communicated with. SCP-6376 appears to be prophetic and has provided useful information to the Foundation in the past. As such, it has received the Thaumiel classification.\n\n**Addendum 1: Ritual-6376**\n\nRitual-6376 is a method of gaining information from SCP-6376. To start, a sacrifice must be performed by the ritualist. The method of achieving this sacrifice may differ, but it should always involve the body part of a human (such as blood, bone, or hair). Depending on how valuable the sacrifice is to the ritualist, the more valuable the information one gains from SCP-6376 will be.\n\nAfter the sacrifice is performed, it should be lain on the roots of SCP-6376. SCP-6376's roots will then move, pulling the sacrifice under itself. Once the sacrifice has been accepted, the ritualist must ask a question. If the sacrifice is deemed satisfactory in comparison to the value of the question, SCP-6376 will respond. If the sacrifice is unworthy, SCP-6376 will request more.\n\n**Addendum 2: Notable Ritual-6376 performances**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Ritual-6376-1**\n-----\n**Date Performed:** 05/10/2013\n\n**Ritualist:** Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n**Sacrifice:** 1 liter of blood.\n\n**Question:** \"What are you?\"\n\n**Answer:** \"I am a tree.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Ritual-6376-2**\n-----\n**Date Performed:** 05/10/2013\n\n**Ritualist:** Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n**Sacrifice:** 1 liter of blood.\n\n**Question:** \"Why can you talk?\"\n\n**Answer:** \"I'll need more before I can tell you.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Ritual-6376-3**\n-----\n**Date Performed:** 05/11/2013\n\n**Ritualist:** Senior Researcher Miranda Sykes.\n\n**Sacrifice:** 1 arm from medical surplus.\n\n**Question:** \"Why can you talk?\"\n\n**Answer:** \"Because I was made to.\"\n-----\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n//SCP-6376 appears to resist providing information about itself to others.
