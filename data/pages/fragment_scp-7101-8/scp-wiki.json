The group was dispatched in various manners, including the induction of tripping, choking, and falling debris.\n\nThe result of this has been the collapse of several sects of the group and the development of divergence between surviving factions.\n\nCurrently, GOI-006 is to be considered neutralized for the time being. However, minor ongoing efforts are being made to quell remaining sects of the group.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #999999; background:#8a8454; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Incident Report:** [[[SCP-3001|SCP-3001]]]\n[[/=]]\nOn 13/5/2038, RAISA noticed a discrepancy between SCP-3001's current document, and a predecessor revision of that same file. While the current 1 - S document dictates that SCP-3001 was discovered, tested, and then abandoned, a previous iteration of the article displayed a series of logs recorded by Dr. Robert Scranton inside SCP-3001, as his physical and mental state slowly deteriorated from isolation and decay, before his death upon returning to our reality.\n\nThis was not the only discrepancy noticed by RAISA, as several other documents that referenced, included, or were regarding SCP-3001 or Dr. Scranton at the time also purported the document's factuality. All of which now either are now deleted or edited significantly.\n\nWhen questioned, Dr. Scranton reports having no memory or knowledge of the previous iteration's contents. Investigations have been dropped by order of the O5.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #999999; background:#8a8454; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Incident Report:** [[[SCP-231|SCP-231]]]\n[[/=]]\n\nIn ████, a group of 7 young women were rescued from a warehouse owned by a group identifying as \"The Children of the Scarlet King\". It was found afterward from interrogated members that they had been planning on ██████ and ████████ the women to their deity, in hopes of inviting it into our reality, but were interrupted before they could begin.\n\nCurrently, 6 of the individuals have recovered from this encounter, and the seventh, Dr. ████ ██████, is now working under the Foundation to investigate leads on the group, anomalies related to the group, and its deity. Investigations are ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #999999; background:#8a8454; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Incident Report:** GOI-013\n[[/=]]\n\nFrom 2023 - 2038, GOI-013 (\"United Nations Global Occult Coalition\"), a group controlled by 108 different organizations with the intent of destroying or strictly policing anomalous phenomenon, had been getting increasingly involved with Foundation operations and regulations, hindering and attempting to gain leverage on it, and acting in opposition in various situations.\n\nThis would change on 18/09/2038, after extensive warfare efforts against a hostile, ontological entity[[footnote]]See SCP-7███ (\"God's Perfect Reject\") for more information[[/footnote]] left 21% of GOI-013's military deceased or injured, as well as 31 individual sects of the whole group being terminated, bankrupt, or leaving in the process.\n\nAfter a negotiation period of 41 days, during which time GOI-013 continued combat efforts against the entity, the Foundation was given full authority over the situation, resulting in the entity's swift containment.\n\nA detail of the negotiation was that the Foundation would occupy the now 35 empty seats[[footnote]]Rather than resizing the number of seats in the group to fit the Foundation as a singular entity, the Foundation would instead occupy each of the individual vacant seats[[/footnote]] of the group, which was heavily debated during the period. GOI-013 was eventually forced to comply, due to the entity beginning to approach civilization.\n\nGOI-013 is now considered a division of the SCP Foundation, as the Department of Occult Liquidization[[footnote]]A department dedicated to combatting hostile anomalous threats[[/footnote]], not to be confused with the Decommissioning Department.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n##black|Ending 1/8: \"The Foundation's best ending!\"##\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
