Apaseans are distinguished from similar species of shapeshifters by their unique memetic ability to deceive and persuade others on a large scale and with significant efficacy.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]When an SCP-8350 instance is performing this ability, regardless of its current form, bright green rings appear around their irises, which can be captured by cameras but are not often cognized by persons at that moment.[[/span]] \n\nFurthermore, SCP-8350 instances do not have a known default form and instead often assume the shape of a //Homo sapiens// or another common animal, primarily as a survival instinct. Geographical and historical evidence suggests SCP-8350 was once an intraterrestrial species and integrated into human civilization in the late Neolithic Era around 6,000 B.C.E., characterizing the ascent of SCP-8350 instances to the Earth's surface. The cause of this migration is largely unknown but generally thought to be the result of mass predation by other intraterrestrial species.\n\nAs of January 2021, SCP-8350 comprises the Department of Public Affairs.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"raisablock\"]]\n**NOTICE FROM THE RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION**\nThe following documents attached to the SCP-8350 file, including addenda, incident reports, and transcripts, have since been archived at the request of the Internal Arbitration Bureau[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The Internal Arbitration Bureau (IAB) is an independent administrative authority within the Foundation that serves to resolve security breaches and prevent conflicts that may arise as a result of disputes between personnel or departments.[[/span]] for the protection of the Department of Public Affairs due to being outdated.

Your little stunts have used up a lot of our resources, I admit it, but they've also used up a lot of yours. The Apaseans can't keep playing this game of cat and mouse forever, and Mr. Humanman, you're running out of cards up your sleeve to play.

Any organization must maintain a positive public appearance—unless, of course, having a public appearance at all is the exact opposite of your organization's goal. The Foundation is one such exception. Within an organization that regularly confronts malevolent gods and world-eating horrors alike, the greatest threats are those threatening to lift the Veil. There is no greater danger to the Foundation than having its operations known to the world. It is paramount that the Foundation and all things anomalous are kept entirely hidden from the general public.//\n\n//Many people believe that public affairs offices are meant to inform the public and keep them in the loop, to be transparent and honest with the world, to maintain a facade of trustworthiness. In truth, this is a misconception. The goal of public affairs, even outside the Foundation, is to keep the boiling masses to a simmer through generality and deceit. Of course, that works for a typical corporation. However, more extreme measures are necessary for an atypical corporation such as the Foundation. The only way to protect normalcy as we know it is to manufacture what is true and manipulate what is not in the eyes of the public.

We're talking about the new, incoming hires, not you specifically.\n\n//Coix shifts his attention to Senatore.//\n\n**Coix:** In which case, please share your concerns, Martin.\n\n**Senatore:** There are just a lot of risks with this pet project of yours that I'm afraid haven't been thoroughly evaluated.\n\n**Coix:** You're afraid that I, of all people, have not been thorough enough? Go on.\n\n**Senatore:** That's not what I mean. I'm just saying, for one, Apaseans are pathological liars. Even you know that. That's what they're known for! We have been in conflict with them for years. Second, you're entrusting some asshole with my department, sir!\n\n**Lague:** //[smirks]// Technically, not your department anymore.\n\n**Coix:** So, Martin, you have an issue with the new department head?\n\n**Senatore:** Of course I do. His name is Bob fucking Humanman. What kind of a name is that?\n\n**Coix:** I have been tracking the Apaseans for years. I know what they value, I know what makes them tick, and what we found out in the Miracrum trials was the Hail Mary we needed. This deal is in their best interests, and they know that. For that, I trust them to do their jobs.\n\n//Lague shrugs his shoulders and turns to look at Senatore.//\n\n**Senatore:** //[sighs]// Alright, fine. I'm still mighty skeptical, but they're certainly an eccentric case, and eccentric cases call for eccentric solutions. If you believe the Apaseans are what the department needs, then I stand with you. \n\n**Coix:** Thank you, Martin.\n\n**Senatore:** But, if I may, why did you choose Bob Humanman as the director? He's not exactly up to the task.\n\n**Lague:** Actually, I second Marty on that. Bob's incompetent, if not a sociopath. With the history you two have, you still want him to head a department?\n\n**Senatore:** I mean, how can you even be sure Mr. Humanman can follow basic protocol? Are we just supposed to take your word for it? Remember what happened when the Polymorphs Department was handling him?\n\n**Coix:** Martin, if you're so worried about this, how about you supervise the new director for a few weeks and make sure he acclimates well to his new position?\n\n**Senatore:** Wait, no. I don't think that's necessary.\n\n**Coix:** No, no, you're right. Someone needs to make sure he is up to the task and stays in line, and you have the experience. So, you'll be supervising him for the foreseeable future until he has your full support.\n\n//Senatore buries his head in his hands.//\n\n**Coix:** This is a big leap, I admit, but it will pan out for us in the long haul—I know that much. Not only will this put the Foundation's conflict with the Apaseans to bed, but it will be our biggest step in communication technology and propaganda since the internet. It's genius, really.\n\n**Lague:** Ant, you know you have my support.\n\n**Coix:** By the way, I should be the first to tell both of you that this Public Affairs office makeover stays under wraps for the time being. Understood? You'll receive a memo from the Internal Arbitration Bureau, but I thought I'd make it clear so you don't spill the beans before then. Nobody else knows we've already swapped out all the staff.\n\n**Lague:** Wait, did we do that already?\n\n**Coix:** Two weeks ago, actually. You would know if you read the briefs I sent you.\n\n**Lague:** Ant, you send me way too many damn papers.\n\n**Coix:** The new hires have been working under the guise of the old staff to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible.\n\n**Senatore:** I wasn't informed about this. I even met with the a temporary appointee filling my position. Who was that guy? \n\n**Coix:** Bob.

Sure. But anyways, how are things?\n\n**Humanman:** You humans just continue to amaze me. Did you know that old people on Facebook will believe literally anything?\n\n**Lague:** Yeah, I buy that. \n\n**Humanman:** The department barely even has to touch that place. You should hear the stuff they believe about vaccines! They are so far gone from reality.\n\n**Lague:** It sounds like you've adjusted well in your first few months.\n\n**Humanman:** Sure, except for the fact that Matthew guy is still breathing on my neck all the time. Is this whole supervision thing necessary?\n\n**Lague:** Matthew? Do you mean Marty?\n\n**Humanman:** I mean, I get the apprehension and all, but I appointed my vice head, my advisors, a factotum, division leads, and all that nonsense within the first month. On top of that, everything has been running perfectly since. No major incidents to speak of yet. The transition has been smooth like butter.\n\n**Lague:** No incidents… yet?\n\n**Humanman:** I'm being what people call \"cautiously optimistic.\"\n\n**Lague:** //[exhales]// Of course. That aside, I honestly had my doubts when Anthony brought you in, but my mind has since been changed. \n\n**Humanman:** I appreciate that. Oh, and I've been giving the files and anomalies at this site a gander like you suggested, and apparently, there's this freaky vending machine you guys have lying around. Do you mind--\n\n**Lague:** //[interrupting]// Okay, no. Why don't we skip to why you're here?\n\n**Humanman:** Right, right. I want to talk about the department. For starters, I want to know how long I, and by extension my whole team, is going to be on that Marty guy's leash.\n\n**Lague:** He was assigned to oversee you until he was satisfied with your leadership. It's a lot of power... yadda, yadda, yadda. It was Ant's call, you get it. He's hardly impeded your operations to my knowledge.\n\n**Humanman:** So, you still don't trust me after all.\n\n**Lague:** I never said that! Speaking as your boss, the productivity boom in your department is nothing to scoff at. It's impressive, really, as if you all were born for this line of work.\n\n**Humanman:** Can we talk about my proposition then?\n\n**Lague:** You mean the one you sent Ant in the form of a Google Slides presentation? Sure. What about it?\n\n**Humanman:** I presume he forwarded it to you?\n\n**Lague:** He did, yes. But unfortunately, as a director with responsibilities and whatnot, there is a big likelihood it would get killed by my superiors if I signed off on it right now. It needs to be assessed first.\n\n**Humanman:** My department has been configuring it and vetting it for over a week. What's there to assess?\n\n**Lague:** I mean by a third party, by the relevant authorities that could implement this. Your proposal wants to open up a few hundred new locations, which is totally plausible, but it would also allow the department to get in bed with world leaders and governments.\n\n**Humanman:** Asia alone has almost 5 billion people. If we coordinate with the governments of China, Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and etcetera, the Foundation's influence over the international media would not just extend to the tens of millions and hundreds of millions as you said, but to the billions—and in only a matter of minutes rather than weeks or months.\n\n**Lague:** You don't have to pitch it to me, Bob. You have to pitch it to the people who would be making it happen. You'll need the vouches from the other departments and divisions that would see this through. \n\n**Humanman:** You sound like Dr. Coix.\n\n**Lague:** Quiet. Listen, all of this is to say that it's easier said than done, and you're going to have to get your hands dirty in the ring.\n\n**Humanman:** What is there you could do to help?\n\n**Lague:** Not much. After all, this is an inter-department and international matter. But what I can do is put through a recommendation to RAISA to have the proposal assessed. It's the quickest way to collect vouches.\n\n**Humanman:** You keep talking about vouches, but vouches for what?\n\n**Lague:** For when you take it to the O5, of course.\n\n= [[size 90%]]**<< END LOG >>**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##navy|@@bjhumanman@scip.net@@##\n**From:** ##navy|@@arcoix@scip.net@@##\n**Subject:** Proposal No. 9544 Assessment Scheduled\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello, Mr. Humanman.\n\nI am messaging you on behalf of Site Director Lague to inform you that his request for an assessment of Proposal Number 9544 to the Records and Information Security Administration has been approved.

Lots of anomalies.\n\n**Humanman:** What my proposal seeks to do is bring the total facility count for my department, Public Affairs, up to 700 in total. In my opinion, the needs of my department and what it is aiming to achieve are magnitudes more important than what is done by culinary anomalies. Comparing divisions alone, we have the News Broadcasting Division, the Public Office Division, the Motion Picture Division, and the Social Media Division to their Dry-Heat Cooking Division and Moist-Heat Cooking Division. It should be a no-brainer.\n\n**O5-1:**  You are correct, and if it was Senatore sitting in your chair, this would be a no-brainer. Boom! The department can have those locations.

Mr. Humanman, what I mean to say is that you and I have no history nor rapport, and I have no reason to see this through. In fact, I've heard you were quite the difficulty for one of our Department Heads in the past. I would be willing to approve the new locations if the Engineering Division vouched for it, which they have yet to, but even so, that is only a fraction of the expansion.\n\n**Humanman:** I know, I know. The proposal also seeks to expand our communications with world leaders, governments, and international organizations. If you turn to the third and fourth references…\n\n//The O5 briefly shuffle through the papers in their folders.//\n\n**Humanman:** You'll see the Assistant Director of the Foreign Affairs Office and the Chairwoman of the Oversight Committee have respectively vouched for this proposal. Additionally, I have the support of my superior, Site Director Lague.\n\n**O5-1:** Those are mighty credible, Mr. Humanman, but I have also been informed that the evermore International Relations Bureau refused to vouch for your proposal.\n\n**Humanman:** Are international relations and foreign affairs not literal synonyms?\n\n**O5-1:** There is a divide on where our various agencies stand on your proposal.\n\n**Humanman:** You ask ten doctors what's wrong with a patient, there is going to be at least one dissenter. The fact of the matter is that this organization maintains normalcy through control, and there is no stronger means than propaganda. Public Affairs has made great use of the resources provided to it, and the Foundation has the capability to expand those resources, all to its own benefit.\n\n//O5-7 nods his head.//\n\n**O5-7:** I agree with the proponent's notion.\n\n//O5-1 glances at O5-7 and then shifts his attention back to Humanman.//\n\n**O5-1:** I'll reiterate that we have no rapport, you and I. Why should I, and by extension, this council, trust you in this expansion?\n\n**Humanman:** In this book I read recently, the authoritarian state controls its people by forcing two contradicting narratives on them simultaneously, doublethink. The Foundation currently operates similarly when it needs to clean up its messes and lick its wounds. It's easier said than done to convince a person to trust you over their own senses, especially in a day and age where everyone and everything is on camera and under perpetual scrutiny.\n\n**O5-1:** And you aim to..?\n\n//O5-1 trails off inquisitively.//\n\n**Humanman:** Eradicate the need for a competing narrative altogether. \n\n//Several O5 lean forward in their chairs.// \n\n**Humanman:** If we bend world leaders to our side and make the world population doubt their own senses and reasoning, our sole, uncontested narrative will effectively become truth.\n\n**O5-1:** Is this a guarantee?\n\n**Humanman:** Only once we have a location in every country, state, and territory and a communications line with every minister, president, monarch, emperor, chancellor, and premier in the world. \n\n//The O5 nod along with Humanman. O5-2 leans into O5-1 and whispers in his ear. After a moment, he sits back upright.//\n\n**O5-1:** Mr. Humanman.\n\n**Humanman:** Yes?\n\n**O5-1:** Two has informed me of a development with your proposal. The Communications Director of the Engineering Division has offered his vouch. Congratulations.\n\n**Humanman:** Does that mean the department is getting its expansion?\n\n**O5-1:** The council and I wish to iron out any further details and concerns, but after that, if we are satisfied, I will move your proposal to a vote.\n\n//Remainder of transcript abridged.//\n\n= [[size 90%]]**<< END LOG >>**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n||||||||~ PROPOSAL N^^__o__^^ 9544 VOTE ||\n||~ ||~ YAY ||~ NAY ||~ ABSTAIN ||\n||~ O5-1 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-2 ||= ||= ||= ###2e5984|X## ||\n||~ O5-3 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-4 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-5 ||= ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||\n||~ O5-6 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-7 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-8 ||= ||= ||= ###2e5984|X## ||\n||~ O5-9 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-10 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-11 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n||~ O5-12 ||= ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||\n||~ O5-13 ||= ###2e5984|X## ||= ||= ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"storyblock\"]]\n//Lastname meets Humanman in Site-01's entrance block with Alpha-1 operatives on patrol.//\n\n**Humanman:** What time is it?\n\n**Lastname:** Almost eight. You were in there for a really long time. You're still breathing, so I assume it went as planned?\n\n**Humanman:** Like clockwork. The meeting got out after like 30 minutes, and the rest of the time I spent chatting up the people in the site. It's not every day you get to be inside the big oh-one.\n\n**Lastname:** Fun. It's a shame then that we'll both be amnesticized on the train..\n\n**Humanman:** Oh, I don't care what anyone in there said, as long as I made a good impression on them. It never hurts to have powerful people on your side.\n\n**Lastname:** And now you're starting to think like a true bureaucrat. \n\n**Humanman:** I don't want to hear it. Though, I just realized, what are we going to do about the doppelgängers? They're still in there.\n\n**Lastname:** They'll switch out in a day or two when the originals get in, just like the first time around. But, if I may, how did you know any of that would work, the whole switch-a-roo scheme?\n\n**Humanman:** Well, the O5 and everyone else we had to go through were so convinced that we were powerless against them that they let their guard down. When you want to see things in black and white, like whatever the hell memetics are, the gray will slip through.\n\n**Lastname:** The gray being?\n\n**Humanman:** //[chuckles]// Something like an all-expenses paid vacation. They didn't even expect us to have people in there already. By the time the meeting started, that mirror crumbs thing already locked our guys into their forms.\n\n**Lastname:** If it's all that easy, why be subservient to them? Why work for them?\n\n**Humanman:** Our goal is the same as theirs, is it not? The Foundation wants to maintain normalcy by staying in the shadows, and we've practically been doing just that for two hundred years. Together, we are strengthened.\n\n**Lastname:** I suppose when you frame it like that. But, all of that aside, there's one thing I'm still confused about, boss.\n\n**Humanman:** And what's that?\n\n**Lastname:** One of our guys on the inside said the Foreign Affairs Office backed our proposal, but they never even assessed it. How did you get the assistant director to vouch for it?\n\n**Humanman:** I called in a favor.\n\n**Lastname:** A favor? For what?\n\n**Humanman:** Well, it turns out everyone needs something. That's all I'll say.\n\n//Dr. Coix and Dr. Warden appear around the corner, and Humanman and Lastname halt.//\n\n**Humanman:** Hello, Dr. Coix, Dr. Warden.\n\n**Warden:** Oh, it's you again.\n\n**Coix:** Relax, Klein. Anyways, Mr. Humanman, I hear the proposal went through. Congratulations.\n\n**Warden:** I'll second that congratulations. You've come a long way, you bastard.\n\n**Humanman:** Why thank you. Did word travel that quickly? \n\n**Coix:** Site-322 command received a memo about it shortly after. Dr. Warden and I are here to see Recruitment about the new staffing.\n\n**Humanman:** Well, the department is about to get a lot bigger, huh? Do you think I'm up to the task?\n\n**Coix:** I was right about you taking over the department to begin with. Was I not?\n\n**Humanman:** I never thanked you for that, by the way.\n\n**Coix:** Please, you don't have to. It would be deeply unsettling coming from you, trust me.\n\n**Humanman:** You're right. So, what's next?\n\n**Coix:** What's next? You keep doing what you're doing.\n\n**Humanman:** Just with a lot more people in a lot more places. We Apaseans will have to teach the new hires how to take on our abilities.\n\n//Coix tilts his head in confusion.//\n\n**Coix:** It can be taught? I didn't even know that was possible.\n\n**Humanman:** Of course. It's like learning a language.\n\n**Coix:** //[clenching teeth]// Great.\n\n//Warden rubs his eyebrows.//\n\n**Warden:** That's just lovely.\n\n//Humanman does not reply. He instead extends his arm to Coix, and they shake hands.//\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8349]]] | SCP-8350 | [[[SCP-8351]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** warning.png\n> **Author:** //Original by// [[*user djkaktus]] //Edits by// [[*user DrApricus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5935 SCP-5935], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8350 SCP-8350]\n\n> **Filename:** Keystone_Symposia_2022_Neurocircuitry_of_Social_Behavior.jpg\n> **Author:** Rickinasia\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Keystone_Symposia_2022_Neurocircuitry_of_Social_Behavior.jpg Wikimedica Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** RAISA_LIGHTLOGO.png\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:basalt Basalt Theme Page]\n\n> **Filename** Train_Engine.jpg\n> **Author:** Pawel Biernacki\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/biernack/36978698861 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** dpa.png\n> **Author:** [[*user DrApricus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8350 SCP-8350]\n\n> **Filename** bob.jpg\n> **Author:** Mike Mozart/Jeepers Media\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/16079739745 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename** Woman_with_glasses_and_Women%27s_suit_2.jpg\n> **Author:** ukieiri-999636\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Woman_with_glasses_and_Women%27s_suit_2.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** palogo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user DrApricus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8350 SCP-8350]\n\n> **Filename** BlankMap-World-v2.svg\n> **Author:** Harbin\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World-v2.svg Wikipedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename** Churro_01.jpg\n> **Author:** Dennis Harper\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/dennisharper/4585223179 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Meeting_with_the_Board_of_Directors_of_NAITA.jpg\n> **Author:** repmobrooks, //Edits by// [[*user DrApricus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meeting_with_the_Board_of_Directors_of_NAITA.jpg Wikipedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
