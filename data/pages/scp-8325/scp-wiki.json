Personnel who uncover an instance of SCP-8325-# among their possessions are to remand the item to their superiors, per standard Anomalous Object retrieval protocols.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Conscripts (.aic) and SCiPnet Webcrawlers handling digitized media have the directive to identify and flag all files created between 22 November‚Äì7 January, depicting said time period, or words or phrases outlined in Glossary-8325-Prone. If an edit to an 8325-flagged file is detected, the unedited original or backup file is to be duplicated, maintaining a minimum of two (2) master copies.

The winter solstice as observed in the Advent and Yule are susceptible, but the effect has not been observed in any recordings of YaldƒÅ Night or Dongzhi. [[/footnote]] //OR// inclement weather as associated with winter in the Northern Hemisphere.[[footnote]] Depiction of summer in either hemisphere remains susceptible if the prior sub-criteria is prevalent. [[/footnote]]\n* The media is __not__ a product of SCP-8325, //UNLESS// the segments previously affected by SCP-8325 have been expunged.\n\nMedia produced at any time of year is susceptible to SCP-8325. While most narratives affected are set on or around Christmas, the time period is not always portrayed (i.e. \"Christmas in July\"). SCP-8325 area of activity appears to be global, as its effects have been identified internationally across fifty-seven (57) counties the SCP Foundation operates in, in addition to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|LMaImb-Area-32]]].\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:carousel\n| images=http://coffeepasta.wikidot.com/local--files/why-are-there-so-many-skips-about-santas/Records_for_Christmas_%281453679%29.jpg,http://coffeepasta.wikidot.com/local--files/why-are-there-so-many-skips-about-santas/Weihnacten%20mit%20die%20Burkes%20%2701.png,http://coffeepasta.wikidot.com/local--files/why-are-there-so-many-skips-about-santas/Andrea_Bocelli_Christmas_DVD.jpg,http://coffeepasta.wikidot.com/local--files/why-are-there-so-many-skips-about-santas/Live%20Kirby%20Reaction.png\n| caption=Image examples of SCP-8325-#.

To current knowledge from a limited data set, the SCP-8325 phenomenon occurs annually and only within the range of 22 November‚Äì7 January; affected computer files will document the time and date of their transfiguration into SCP-8325-#, attributed by metadata as a modification executed by the admin account of the host computer or server.\n\nDue to the nature of non-computer mediums and occurrence of SCP-8325 being largely unpredictable and unobservable with reliability, the time the majority of SCP-8325-# are created cannot be determined with certainty. Rate of SCP-8325 also can only be hypothesized from this limited data set, with further error as the discovery of an SCP-8325-# may occur up to years in advance of its creation.\n\nContents of SCP-8325-# vary individually upon the derived media, but are universally marked by the insertion of at least one (1) mythological or folkloristic character associated with Christmas or similar winter holidays.\n\nIn approximately 90% of instances, this character has been Santa Claus (or cognates/regional equivalents of), occasionally accompanied by associated characters such as Santa's reindeer, elves, or Mrs. Claus. Non-Christmas characters may also appear in conjunction, or in the 10% minority of cases where Santa Claus is absent. These characters have included but are not limited to: the Befana, Ded Moroz, [[[SCP-4033|the Easter bunny]]],[[footnote]] //SCP-8325-1682 and its focus upon a snow hare when the original documentary completely omitted all mentions of holidays makes the item a bizarre outlier.

[[/footnote]] and Zwarte Piet. If already present in the original media, the Santa Claus(es) or other holiday character(s) will fulfill the same altered role within the SCP-8325-# narrative.\n\nSCP-8325-# are marked by an added emphasis upon the aforementioned mythological/folkloristic character(s) and their associated holidays. These alterations may be negligible to the original narrative such as cameo appearances, but more extensive changes may result from SCP-8325, from creation of or restructuring into dedicated scenes to the complete rewriting of plot points or the entire narrative. Larger alterations are more common in SCP-8325-# originating from non-fiction media and shorter runtimes, but a fiction narrative may on occasion experience just as substantial changes.\n\nThe characters native to the original media rarely acknowledge the changes that make SCP-8325-#, but this almost always occurs if themes of metanarratives and medium awareness were present, and in the case of SCP Foundation records, feature faculty with awareness of SCP-8325.\n \nSCP-8325 has been unable to alter text outside of those displayed in video: Credit that attribute actors by role will credit the added characters as self portrayals or to ostensible pseudonyms (ex. \"Nicholas Q. Laplander LVIII\", \"Jedidiah Klausberg\", \"Abigail Claus\"). Captions will only be altered if they are hard-coded into the video (i.e. not a separate text file toggleable by setting). If a disc contains audio tracks for different language settings, only the most recently used audio will be altered with the video.\n\nMicroscopic analysis of SCP-8325-# confirms that the SCP-8325 process makes physical changes, and SCP-8325-# do contain magnetic, optical, or digital recordings of the anomalous contents. Macroscopic details, such as print, handwriting, and box art are unaffected. With exception to motion picture reels upon thorough inspection, it is impossible to discern if a piece of media or storage device is or contains an SCP-8325-# instance without the use of electronics necessary to read them.\n\nCognitohazards and infohazards present in the original media are not inherently neutralized by SCP-8325. While transfiguration into SCP-8325-# may overwrite the hazards, odds are they will remain in an active state. [[size 75%]](See __Incident Report 8325-324/1 (3/10/1987)__, __Experiment 8325#23__ for further detail.)[[/size]]\n----\n**HISTORY:** The first instance of SCP-8325 manifested and was discovered 10 December 1974, the day of purchase by Dr. Arthur Jules, then Assistant Director of Records at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-appliance-war-hub|CAONTR-Site-37]]]. SCP-8325-1 was initially catalogued as an Anomalous Object until a further five instances had been identified by December 1976. SCP-8325 was catalogued with designation as a Euclid-containment class anomaly on 30 December 1976.\n\nFrom 1976‚Äì1982, assets of Mobile Task Forces [[[SCP-855|Beta-23 \"Film Critics\"]]], [[[SCP-777|Zeta-17 \"Beach Bullies\"]]], and Eta-2 \"Bin Bargainers\" were given assignment to identify and seize any SCP-8325-# among the public. After consistent failure to procure any such instances, it was concluded that SCP-8325 was a phenomenon that exclusively impacted Foundation staff.\n\nReview of security tapes after a containment breach further determined that SCP-8325-# could manifest not only on the persons of and at the residences of Foundation personnel, but facilities operated by the Foundation. Due to potential to compromise site records, SCP-8325 was reclassified as Gevurah-containment class on 28 December 1982. Since the implementation the Anomaly Classification System, SCP-8325 has been designated Ekhi-disruption class and Notice-risk class.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Hazel Baker of BISRC-Site-12 appealed to the site and regional Ethics Committees for emotional and material damages on the seizure of SCP-8325-233 on the grounds that knowledge of SCP-8325 was withheld from unassigned researchers at the time.[[footnote]] The original recording documented Dr. Baker's last Christmas with her husband and both of their daughters. A vehicular incident would claim the lives of Mr. Baker and their eldest in August 1990. [[/footnote]] Following review and the ruling in Baker's favour, SCP-8325's special containment procedures were revised to include an awareness campaign of SCP-8325 and the preservation of susceptible materials, and to avoid setting precedent of future SCP-8325-# cases brought to the Ethics Committee.

Approximately one-third of those instances (784, 34.77%) have been audio and/or visual records of surveillance, interrogations, and field missions that were produced during or made significant mention of the holiday season or paraphernalia.\n\nSince 2019, at least 100 new SCP-8325-# have been collected annually. Extrapolation of edit records on SCP-8325-# metafiles from 1991‚Äì2024 indicates that SCP-8325 has increased at an overall rate of 15%, with an average rate increase of 0.5% annually. Success in identifying SCP-8325-# (some of which have been dormant for years) is unpredictable and varies; rate of cataloging cannot be used as an accurate measurement of increasing SCP-8325 activity, nor a method prediction for future SCP-8325-# recoveries.
