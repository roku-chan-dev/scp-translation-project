They usually flew in any weather, but to a wildfire, smoke and ash could blind the pilots. Any of these could leave them with no way of navigation other than instinct and a compass. His wingman Arc, who had yet to get a callsign, sat next to him.\n\n\"Relax Arc. You want your first actual flight blind?\"\n\n\"Second.\"\n\nOpal turned his head towards Arc, who had been anxious all day. \"Nobody calls moving a helicopter over here a 'flight'. Also, you forgot to turn off your light.\"\n\nArc immediately started messing with his helmet to turn off a light it didn't have. In the distance, a few of the senior airmen stood there and watched the newbie fancily search for a light on his helmet.\n\n\"Anyways, I'm gonna go talk to the Fire Eaters, and get that light off!\"\n\nOpal walked away from Arc, finally realizing there was no light. Up on the tarmac, a team of firefighters with fire axes and air tanks were standing around a CH-47 awaiting takeoff.\n\n\"You the pilot?\" The first firefighter asked, leaning his axe against the side of the chinkhook.\n\n\"I don't deal with local jobs. Also, aren't you guys based at the regional airbase instead of this one?\" Opal tried to question the firefighters, as this was a foundation airbase. The leader of the group, a tall Irish man, approached him.\n\n\"Relax man, we're on the same side\" He raised a flap on his suit, showing the Epilsion-9 insignia.\n\n\"Names Declan. Declan Kelly.\"\n\nOpal backed off, giving them space. \"I was told I was dropping off guys to deal with a cult, not fight a fire.\" He tied to remain calm, trying not to piss off the group.\n\n\"We are the team, mate. Turns out that cult is a bunch of arsonists. Started the whole damn fire. Now we gotta take them out.\" Declan signaled to the rest of the group, and they started grabbing equipment from a box nearby. \n\n\"So your plan, is to kill the cult with axes?\" Opal was already confused. First the weather not being good, then the briefing was wrong, and now he was delivering a team armed with axes to a burnt-down cult.\n\nJust as Opal had finished comprehending his situation, a green flag was raised on the ATC tower. The weather had finally been good. Two SCPF aircraft, disguised with DNR logos, went screaming down the runway. Crews scrambled to their planes. The base went from 0 to 100 in an instant.  \n\n\"Lets get this bird in the air!\" Declan would yell, giving hand signals to his team. They had to get up in the air ASAP. Opal scrambled to the cockpit, nearly tripping on a tank that had been scrapped onto the frame. \n\nIt only took a few seconds to get the engines up. Declan had his comset hooked up to the helicopter already. \"We only have a bit of time. Those planes are making sure we don't become baked potatoes. We need to get to the LZ, get the job done, and you will pull us out.\"\n\nThe Chinook got into the air, its dual propellers pulling it off the ground with much ease. Planes were taking off and leaving every minute. This wildfire was massive.\n\nIt didn't take long to lose sight of the ground. Not because they went high, but because they went inside the smoke. All Opal had to navigate was the instruments, which weren't always enough. \n\nOpal had signaled to the team to get clipped to the ropes. Declan relayed it back to them, and they got ready to jump out.\n\nEveryone was focused. They jump too early and they will hit the burning trees. Take too long they risk getting engulfed. The latter is survivable. The first isn't.\n\n\"Jump\"\n\nAll of the firefighters landed in the LZ, touching the landing, and unclip. Now they were all alone in hell.\n\n\"Declan, lets get this started.\" \n\nAspen, who was a rookie and therefore the last one out, had almost gotten thrown by the heli since her buckle got snagged. They got their gear settled, and now the fun could begin.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[size large]]Mission Log 12/24/2013 \"The Firestorm Incident\"[[/size]]\nDeclan: Everyone Here?\n\nAspen: Little messed up, but I'm fine\n\nRocky: Yeah yeah, we are fine\n\n//The team of E-9 walked 200 feet to the target building.//\n\nRocky: Isn't this the source of the fire?\n\nRoscoe: Well that confirms they ARE arsonists.\n\nDeclan: Let's deal with it.\n\n//Declan approached the door.//\n\nAspen: You know what to do.\n\n//Declan broke down the door, and everyone entered the room.//\n\nDeclan: Firebird, this is 1-1. We have entered the target building. Over.\n\nFirebird: 1-1, continue exploration of the area. If it's too large to explore, you may exit the building. Report any findings to us.\n\nDeclan: 10-4, 1-1 out.\n\nDeclan: Aspen and Roscoe, with me. Alex, Rocky, and Jackie take the left wing. \n\nAlex: Got it.\n\nDeclan: Actually, Steve and Aspen stay here. Keep in touch with us. Oscar, you're with me.\n\nAspen: And if the fire gets too close?\n\nDeclan: Call for a tanker\n\nJackie: And tell us\n\nSteven: No shit Jackie\n\n//Declan toke his team to the right wing, well Alex did the same with the left-wing.//\n\nRocky: You think this is just a freak accident?\n\n//Alex looked over at Rocky.//\n\nAlex: Why would they grab a book from the MC&D?\n\nRocky: I don't know, maybe it was a signed copy of the bible?\n\n//The team entered a side room and grabbed a backpack.//\n\nRocky: Do you think it works?\n\nAlex: Maybe. Firebird, this is 2-1. We have found a laptop. Transferring control now.\n\n//Jackie inserted a USB into the laptop from her backpack, and typed in a code to allow Firebird to control the laptop. She placed it in her bag, and continue on.//\n\nDeclan (over radio): Yall found anything?\n\nSteven (over radio): Nothing in the main area.\n\nAlex (over radio): We found a laptop. Firebird is looking through it.\n\nDeclan: How's life?\n\nOscar: Same old stuff. Watching football. Occasional fire here and there.\n\nRoscoe: working over at the shop, just as always.\n\n//They found a small room, and inside there was a body, impaled by a metal stake.//\n\nOscar: Well shit. For a second I thought we were risking our lives for a laptop.\n\nDeclan: Firebird, this is 1-1. We found a body. White male, about thirty, and black hair.\n\nFirebird: 1-1, bag him. Get one of the guards to go and retrieve him. We can run an autopsy later.\n\nAspen (over radio): En route.\n\n//Aspen ran down the hallway//\n\nAspen: Oh there actually WAS a body. I thought you lied to get me to grab your bag.\n\nDeclan: That was a house fire.\n\nAspen: Yeah yeah, just let me grab the body.\n\n//Aspen grabbed the body and carry it back to the front entrance.//\n\n//The group walked down a corner, and meet up with the others.//\n\nDeclan: Oh I know you guys.\n\nJackie: Find anything interesting? \n\nOscar: A body.\n\n//The six of them headed down the hallway, which led into an open yard with a singular burning stake with a book atop it.//\n\nDeclan: Firebird? Anything on that laptop?\n\nFirebird: Yeah, that book they got, it's, umm, something for a ritual called firestorm?\n\nDeclan: Whatever that is, they have done it. We gotta get out of here.\n\nFirebird: Agreed. Opal? \n\nOpal: Yes?\n\nFirebird: Drop the cargo on the stake. Then get to the LZ.\n\nOpal: Rodger that.\n\n//Opal looked at the yard, the entire team running through the compound away from the stake. He  unbuckle the cargo and pushed it out of the bay.//\n\nOpal: Cargo out\n\n//Opal returned to the cockpit. The box landed on the stake, suffocating the fire. Instead of putting it out, the fire intensified rapidly. The box had become a giant Roman candle.//\n\nOpal: SHIT! WE ARE GETTING OUT OF HERE\n\n//Opal quickly turned the helicopter around, nearly avoiding a pillar of flame.// \n\nOpal: EVERYONE IN NOW!\n\n//The entire team rushed into the Chinhook.//\n\nAspen: What about the body?\n\nOpal: WE AIN'T GRABBING IT.\n\n[[size large]]Log end[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOpal panicked. He knew he's in trouble. He can't land. He had one option.\n\n\"You guys are fastropping out.\" \n\nDeclan dropped down a rope, and the 8 members of his team rode down the rope. After they all got off at the base, a small van drove over to the team.\n\nA young man in a suit got out. He was a tall man, almost the size of Delcan. \"You boys ok?\" He said in a light British accent.\n\n\"Mostly\"\n\n\"Get in. Somethings happening.\"\n\n\"Figured\"\n\nOpal had to land. He chose a small airport a few miles out and was immediately intercepted by multiple foundation agents. He knew he was dead meat.\n\nIt was just a matter of time.\n\nBefore he was killed. Before the world would burn.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=MineFlyer]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
