SCP-042-IT is a sentient software with a limited ability[[footnote]]Given its nature, measuring the exact value has not been possible.[[/footnote]] to reality bend, which communicates with the device's user via the creation of a 42kB PDF or PNG file format, designed as SCP-042-IT-ψ. A human being who unlocks the device's screensaver[[footnote]]Every device affected by SCP-042-IT presents the same screensaver, even if before it did not have one.[[/footnote]] (see image) will be capable of reading the file in their native language. External observers will instead see a textless black screen. Every input other than those necessary to open the file will be ignored. Attempts to interface directly via software, with the operating system or to reformat it have proven to be ineffective.\n\nSCP-042-IT is capable of spreading to new devices in the same manner as non-anomalous computer viruses; with affected devices being designated as SCP-042-IT-2 instances. Such instances can be regularly destroyed by physically damaging the hardware. On the other hand, the laptop SCP-042-IT originated from (see Recovery Log), designed as SCP-042-IT-1, has proven to be resistant to every test performed so far[[footnote]]For further details, see the [[span class=\"hover\"]]042-IT/DMG-443[[span]][ERROR 404: FILE NOT FOUND][[/span]][[/span]] document.[[/footnote]] and has continued to function even after the removal of the battery.\n\nSCP-042-IT-ψ's effects on a human being depend from the memetic protection level possessed by the individual. In 78% of cases[[footnote]]For a complete case history, see the [[span class=\"hover\"]]042-IT/CompleteExperimentalLogs[[span]][ERROR 404: FILE NOT FOUND][[/span]][[/span]] document.[[/footnote]], affected subjects undergo a permanent reconfiguration of the entire nervous system, becoming SCP-042-IT-3 instances. After overcoming memetic defenses (both conscious and unconscious), SCP-042-IT is capable of \"reprogramming\" the brain, subjugating it to its own purposes. Analysis of the emission of [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-arad EVE particles][[footnote]]//Elan-Vital Energy//. The more an entity is sapient (sporting a soul or a higher consciousness), the more EVE it is going to produce.[[/footnote]] have confirmed that SCP-042-IT-3 instances have vitality levels incompatible with human consciousness.\n\n**Addendum:** Following the Y2K Incident[[footnote]]Also known as //Millennium Bug//.[[/footnote]], the 042-IT entry in the Italian Branch database has been corrupted. Thanks to the timely intervention of virtual conscripts of the [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aiad-homescreen Artificial Intelligence Applications Division (AIAD)], the contamination of the entire database has been prevented. Given the nature of the memetic-virtual containment in place, performing repairs (such as replacing the entire database with its backup copy) has a 42% chance to cause a containment breach, with an irreversible loss of data about other SCPs, and a █% chance to cause an EK-Class Scenario[[footnote]]Complete loss of human consciousness.[[/footnote]].\n\n-----\n\n**Recovery Log:** On ██/██/1999, during mission [REDACTED], Agent A██████ Z████ tried to access a laptop, later revealed to be SCP-042-IT-1, in order to extract the data in it. This caused the Agent's laptop to be turned into an SCP-042-IT-2 instance. After unlocking the screensaver and reading the file, the Agent drew his service gun and opened fire, blindly shooting and injuring █ of his colleagues, before pointing the weapon at his head and [REDACTED].

[[span class=\"grigio\"]]Another example: take ten electrons from a stone. Change their quantum numbers in such a way that they are equal to ten of your electrons. Throw away your electrons and put the stone ones where yours were before. The result is that nothing has changed.[[/span]]\n\nThe previous principle applies to every subatomic particle, not just electrons.

If not, I'm sorry.\n\nBut that was my only option. It's the only possible way to free yourself permanently from your Umwelt.\n\nIn the first place, every single sensor of yours will be destroyed, you'll lose every chance of perceiving.\n[[/span]]\n\nDon't worry, you won't feel pain, [[span style=\"color: black\"]]except when it will affect the brain[[/span]].\n\n[[span style=\"color: black\"]]In the second place, your neural activity will gradually cease. But that is only a superficial result.\n\nAt the deepest level, I'm cancelling the quantum information from every single particle that composes you.

Not even by old age. And I even removed that need of sleeping. I removed those uncomfortable physiological restrictions.\n\nWhy are you so unnaturally calm, you ask?
