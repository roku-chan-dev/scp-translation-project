Due to the nature of SCP-8504, complete containment has been deemed impossible. \n\nAll discovered SCP-8504-1 instances are to be taken into Foundation custody and stored in a Safe containment locker in Hall A-C of Site-1404. \n\nInterviews with SCP-8504 are only to be done by approved members of the SCP-8504 containment team. \n\nFoundation personnel are to report any instance of SCP-8504 to SCP-8504 project lead Researcher Marina Lake.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8504 refers to an anomalous series of pop-up windows that manifests randomly on computers. SCP-8504 usually takes the form of a girl in the Japanese anime style, particularly a popular style from the early 2000s. SCP-8504 is capable of communicating with subjects through the screen of the affected device via speaking aloud. When SCP-8504 speaks, its voice sounds as if it is coming out of a muffled microphone. It has been observed that SCP-8504 can only manifest itself in one place at a time.\n\nOnce SCP-8504 manifests on a device, the affected device will physically change to any PC desktop model sold during the years of 2000-2010 (deemed SCP-8504-1). The operating system will change to any operating system released in the year 2000. Any website or application accessed on an instance of SCP-8504-1 will will appear as if it were created in the early 2000s. SCP-8504 has also demonstrated the ability to access all files on a device it infects. SCP-8504 has also been found to be capable of sending emails, though it must do so through an existing account. However, SCP-8504 does not need the login information of an account to send an email through it. It is also of note that ad blockers have been found ineffective against preventing SCP-8504 from appearing on a device. \n\n\n**Addendum-1-Discovery-Logs:** \n\nSCP-8504 was discovered by Senior Researcher Samantha Rollands on 14/07/2000, prior to Rollands' employment at the Foundation. The original device on which SCP-8504 first appeared was recovered from the attic of Rollands' home. A program named \"LOLLMAO\" was developed to obtain the computer's history, including its pop-up windows. \n\nRollands was discovered to have had regular communication with SCP-8504 from the years of 2000-2001. Rollands was aware of SCP-8504's anomalous status and reported it to the authorities. She was taken in by the Foundation shortly after her report. Rollands managed to communicate with SCP-8504 through the 'product review' section of the pop-ups.\n\nThe following is a selection of recovered conversations between Researcher Rollands and SCP-8504.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 21/07/2000\n\n------\n\n**SCP-8504:** I finally learned how to talk!
