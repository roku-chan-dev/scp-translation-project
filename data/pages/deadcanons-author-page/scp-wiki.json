(Spoilers below!)\n\n[[=]]\n//Moses Feghoot is still alive. But as much as he might want a miracle, he knows that's not what he's dealing with. Feghoot is alive because of SCP-8961. Now the duty falls to him -- not just to determine **what** he has become, but to **destroy** it... if necessary.// \n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background-image: linear-gradient(#ff6090, black, black); color: white;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**THE MANY OBJECT CLASSES OF MOSES FEGHOOT**\n(tentative order (--second-- --third-- fourth draft))\n[[/=]]\n\n* Prologue: [[[scp-8961|SCP-8961 - A Heuristic Game of Dungeons and Dragons]]]\n\n* Safe | Safe? | --Safe--\n* Euclid | Burning Sensation | --Euclid--\n* SCP-???? - AI Blackbox Singularity\n* Interlude: --Safe-- --Euclid-- Safe\n* SCP-???? - Centaurs\n* Keter | A Cruel AI's Thesis | --Keter--\n* Neutralized | Exit, Pursued by A. Kraken | --Neutralized--\n\n* Epilogue: SCP-???? - The Service Animal of Dir. Feghoot\n[[/div]]\n\nMy intention with this series is to explore the tension between the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division and the Foundation's usual policies. The [[[anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub|AEED Hub]]] describes the department as \"an antithesis to the Foundation's traditional principles.\" And that was how [[*user winkwonkboi]] designed it: a Foundation department that is warm instead of cold, communal instead of contained, playing instead of working. To add to that, I designed a [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-169|Site]]] that was small instead of sprawling, and underfunded instead of limitless. \n\nThis space is where all of my original Foundation work has taken place for the last two years. I've been thinking about the Foundation in a \"softer\" way than we usually do. I think I'm finally ready to go back into the dark. \n\nSo, in one sense, that's what this story is: the bridge I'm trying to build from one extreme to the other. I'm not even sure if you //can// build a bridge between two things so diametrically opposed. But that's what I'm going to try. Wish me luck! \n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab About Me]]\n**Item #:** Olivia/Deadcanons\n\n**Object Class:** she/they\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Yes\n\n**Description:** Howdee. I go by many names, but the two most common are Olivia and Deadcanons. I write stories for the Engagement Division, and (at a much less frequent rate) stories about my author avatar, Annabelle Kraken.[[footnote]]You might wonder why I didn't name my author avatar something more traditional, like... \"Deirdre Canons\" or sommat. Well, for one thing, Kraken literally came to me in a dream. For another, the Story Voice has told me that there's actually an in-universe answer to this question, but I haven't written it yet. So we're both gonna have to just wait.[[/footnote]] I'm eventually gonna do a whole elaborate series about her. Eventually. Trust. \n\nThe Foundation and I have a \"tragic backstory\" (lol), which I wrote about in my first article, //[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/amor-pati-or-love-to-suffer|Amor Pati]]]//. My chaotic (frankly, random) activity level on the site can be attributed to a lot of the experiences I describe in that story. Rest assured, I'm no longer having any of those experiences. The Foundation doesn't scare me like it used to, and my relationship with it is increasingly complex and joyful. I just have no choice but to pace myself, so I'm not as consistently active as other writers. \n\nThat's honestly really all I have to say on the matter. I love the SCP Foundation, I love the incredible stuff people make on it, and I love that I can be a part of that, however small. Long live the Foundation, may the Foundation live forever! \n\nI love looking at drafts and talking about SCP, so don't hesitate to reach out. \n\n[[=]]\n[[[https://twitter.com/Deadcanons|Twitter]]] | [[[https://linktr.ee/deadcanons|Linktree]]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab First Will and Testament]]\n[[=]]\nTHE FIRST[[footnote]]As opposed to a \"Last Will,\" because this isn't going to be my Last Will. In fact, I suspect this is the First of many. No I will not elaborate[[/footnote]] WILL AND TESTAMENT OF DEADCANONS\n[[/=]]\n\nOn this day, the tenth of October 2024, I, Olivia, also known as Deadcanons, of sound (enough) mind and sound (lol) body, declare the following regarding my body of work on The SCP Foundation.  \n\nIf I have not been active on the Wiki for over two years, AND I cannot be contacted by other means, then the following policies apply: \n\n* Any work of mine tagged //engagement-division// is under the authority of [[*user winkwonkboi]].\n* Any work of mine tagged //scp// is expressly the property of The SCP Foundation and its users. I leave any future changes to the discretion of the site moderators. \n* I request that any work of mine which is NOT an SCP (such as Tales) be left as it is.[[footnote]]Excepting extraordinary circumstances, such as... idk, like, we discover a real-life cognitohazard, and I wrote it into one of my stories like 12 times. You guys can edit that for sure. I don't want to kill anybody.[[/footnote]]\n\nI regularly take long breaks from writing for the Wiki, but I //never// stop being a fan and participant in The SCP Foundation. I fully expect that this will continue to be the case for the rest of my life. As such, this Will is mostly intended to be used in the event of my actual death and/or disappearance. \n\nIf you ever need to contact me regarding the use of my articles/characters, my proverbial door is always open. You can message me on the Wiki, but if you need to reach me in a timely manner, just message me on Discord @Deadcanons instead. \n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Graffiti]]\nLeave messages for future generations. (anyone is welcome to edit this tab!) \n\n\"rip canons, you will be missed\" - [[*user winkwonkboi]]\n\n\"Multiple people have. Every day a happens. Just something to consider\" - [[*user Letova]]\n\n\"Bababooey\" - [[*user Merehrab]]\n\n\"I was told I could leave graffiti here. So now you have to deal with this being here. muahhhahahah\" [[*user diogene_s]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-list= --]\n|order=\n|perpage=\n|background-image=\n|shadow=\n]]",
