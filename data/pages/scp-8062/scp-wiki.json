Access of SCP-8062 is to be limited to Class-B personnel and above for strictly research purposes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8062 is a blank cotton painting canvas. Since acquisition of the anomalous object in December 2023, SCP-8062 has consistently manifested acrylic-based paints onto its surface (Hitherto referred to as Event 8062/1). These manifestations typically depict a singular individual performing an action. Event 8062/1 also manifests a message carved into the back of the canvas.\n\nEvent 8062/1 occurs at the start of every month at midnight. The manifestations remain attached to the canvas for exactly twenty-four (24) hours. All attempts to capture the moment of manifestation or disintegration of SCP-8062 have ended in failure, and the method or reason of Event 8062/1 occuring is currently unknown.\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Addendum 8062.1** \nRecords of Manifestations\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n**2024/1/1:**\nManifestation: Subject in his bedroom.\nMessage: Man, I need to get all of this work done fast.

This process continued for twenty-seven (27) more minutes, with the sounds growing in decibels. \n\nAt 11:39 PM, sparks of fire and smoke were released from SCP-8062. \n\nAt 11:59 PM, the front canvas of SCP-8062 began to char. Eyewitness reports that sounds of children laughing can be now audibly heard.\n\n10 seconds before 12:00 PM, 2024/12/31, SCP-8062 began to burn. Eyewitness reports that sounds to a countdown can be now audibly heard.\n\nAt exactly 12:00 PM, 2025/1/1, SCP-8062 combusted, releasing chemical reactions resembling the process in which most commercial fireworks are released. Charred cotton and other substances now revealed to be a mixture of Strontium Nitrate and Copper (I) Chloride drifted to the Anomalous Objects Storage Room's ground for the next three (3) minutes.\n\nFrom this event, thirteen (13) lockers in the Anomalous Objects Storage Room were either damaged or destroyed. Due to the anti-explosive materials that the lockers were constructed with, no anomalous objects were damaged from this event.\n\nSCP-8062's object class was altered from \"Safe\" to \"Neutralized\", and the remnants of the object was brought to the General Research Room in Site-161 for research purposes.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 8062\n|clearance= 1\n|container-class= neutralized\n|secondary-class= none\n|disruption-class= none\n|risk-class= none\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|containment-class= neutralized\n|containment-image= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Aanomaly-class-bar/neutralized-icon.svg\n|containment-color= 48, 48, 52\n|inc-neutralized-layout = --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|clearance-one= 48, 48, 52\n|inc-clearance= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|accent-one= 48, 48, 52\n|accent-two= 48, 48, 52\n|class-number-color= 48, 48, 52\n|inc-color-accent = --]]]\n------\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8061]]] | SCP-8062 | [[[SCP-8063]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
