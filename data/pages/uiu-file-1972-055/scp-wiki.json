Her father was a political science professor at the University of Tehran, and her mother worked as an agent for the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence. They emigrated to the United States before her birth due to an unspecified scandal that saw her mother retire in disgrace. Her parents raised her to believe that public education and selfless service are vital to the cause of international peace. Her mother disappeared in 2001 while attempting to turn whistleblower to the International Criminal Court; in hopes of discovering what had happened, Ghasemi attempted to join the Central Intelligence Agency but was denied for unspecified reasons. She instead joined the United States Armed Forces, hoping to achieve the same goal with a career in military intelligence, but was instead transferred into the American contingent of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces due to a general shuffling of ethno-regionals out of direct combat in the Middle Eastern theater. By now, convinced that her efforts to discover her mother's fate represented intentional stonewalling by the governments of both Iran and the US, Ghasemi substituted globalist idealism for her lost national patriotism.}}\n\n{{**Service Record:** As part of the 3rd Infantry Ghasemi was deployed with the American contingent to Namibia as part of UNAMSIL (the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone) in 2001. In February her peacekeeping unit picked up radio chatter from the Revolutionary United Front indicating an imminent raid on a clandestine government research facility. Moving to prevent the outbreak of open hostilities, they discovered an illegal prison conducting biological research on human subjects under the auspices of an unknown organization. The resulting conflict, subsequently known as Incident CARBON BANNER by the Global Occult Coalition, saw both Ghasemi's unit and the RUF sustain heavy casualties before the facility was secured by the UN. A joint taskforce of the Global Occult Coalition and SCP Foundation relieved both groups and administered amnestics after debriefing them, since the facility made extensive use of paratechnology in its research program.}}\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n**I'm not surprised they have a file on me, and I'm not surprised it's included in this packet.

Her combat efficiency and dedication to teamwork and unit coherence resulted in a steady series of promotions, culminating in her commanding her own team by 2004. What followed was nearly a decade of successful field operations; her policy of total disclosure to her agents, as opposed to keeping them on a need-to-know basis, made her unit internally famed for the talented personnel it regularly turned out. Every mission was an opportunity to turn someone expendable into someone experienced.}}\n\n{{In 2013 she accompanied a strike team into the field in order to investigate a human trafficking case. Due to severe misinformation promulgated by the SCP Foundation, and their direct intervention in the raid, Ghasemi’s unit was almost entirely wiped out by what turned out to be a small pack of SCP-939 instances. She alone survived, with the loss of her right arm and partial shoulder. This prompted her early retirement from the FBI.}}\n\n{{**Assessment:** Due to her outstanding case closure record, personal accomplishments, and first-hand exposure to Veiled phenomena, Agent Ghasemi is a prime candidate for transfer to the Unusual Incidents Unit. She should be briefed on the nature of the SCP Foundation and provided additional documentation regarding their involvement in her personal history to facilitate the transfer.}}\n[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/uiu-file-1972-055/monoUIU.png style=\"width: 100px;\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n**Called it.**\n@@ @@\n**In the event that someone’s removed this from the safe while I walk to Marek's office: hi!

Under the auspices of local lobster fishermen, the Brotherhood seeded the Maine coast with occult artifacts sunken into the seabed within shipwrecks, natural crevices and preserved fish carcasses with the intent of gradually awakening a deific entity they termed \"The Red Asteroid.\" According to their theology, this entity would aid in the ethnic cleansing of the United States before elevating the believers to a plane of existence they termed \"The Upper Depths\" wherein they would serve as \"Fleet-Lords\" over ships crewed by the enslaved slain. The Brotherhood was first founded by occultists worshipping a different deity, sharing only its sea star form with The Red Asteroid; the present theology was created after a number of deaths and disappearances within the group left an authority vacuum which was filled temporarily by horror writer Howard Phillips Lovecraft, who also introduced the racial elements of the Brotherhood's beliefs.\n\nThe Brotherhood was destroyed on 11 May 1978 when interference by parties unknown prevented Foundation agents from conducting their regular neutralization of the sunken artifacts, and a creature superficially resembling The Red Asteroid was summoned in Penobscot Bay. It immediately consumed the lobster fishing fleet with all hands, instantly killing (or precipitating the eventual digestive demise) of each Person of Interest in the cult, before turning its attentions to the port of Stonington. At this point the creature, dubbed LSA-Stonington-01 by the Global Occult Coalition, was promptly disposed of via the application of an industrial quantity of epsom salt deployed via cargo plane.\n\nThe Brotherhood was destroyed on 11 May 1978 via the execution of Neutralization Plan 346-Alpha: the activation of a cognitohazardous strobe concealed in the Deer Isle Thorofare Light during the group's weekly meeting in Penobscot Bay, interacting with memetics seeded into their religious literature by an embedded Foundation agent and precipitating their collective heart attacks.
