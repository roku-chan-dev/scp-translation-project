Experimentation requests for non-infectious fingers require project team approval. Experimentation requests for infectious fingers require Site Director sign-off and are solely to be conducted upon D-Class subjects; following these experiments, infected personnel will be amnesticized and returned to service.\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-8217-1 is a set of 22 fingers that appeared on the desk of Site-48 Researcher Masha Straschnov on June 8, 2024. Genetic testing has confirmed that all fingers come from a single humanoid being of an as-yet-unidentified species. Each measure between 5 and 8 centimeters and appear to have been violently severed.\n\nWhen touched, each SCP-8217-1 instance induces a distinct vision of life upon an alien planet. Within the vision, all intelligent lifeforms are perceived as human; the actual appearance of these lifeforms, if extant, is unknown. A minority of SCP-8217-1 visions cause exposed individuals to develop an as-yet poorly-understood disorder characterized by heightened aggression and increased comfort with the concept of human extinction. To avoid this, ‘infectious’ visions are auto-censored by AIC.\n\nUsing the relative size of astronomical phenomena perceivable in the background of SCP-8217-1 visions, Foundation astronomers successfully triangulated the depicted planet (designated SCP-8217-2) and obtained an image of it through the Extrasolar Observational Array.\n\nFrom orbit, the surface of SCP-8217-2 appears of uniform color and without geographic variation, bearing little resemblance to the lush planet observed in SCP-8217-1 visions. Ongoing explosions are visible at several points across its surface. SCP-8217-2 is orbited by two moons; their orbital speeds imply that the density of SCP-8217-2 is comparable to that of animal biomass.\n\nA partial record of SCP-8217-1 visions is below.\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#d5ffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Designation:** SCP-8217-4-1 | **Infectiousness:** Negative\n------\n**Log of Associated Vision:**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nYou are Hanu Cealal, scarcely king.\n\nYou are tired, bone-tired. You see yourself in the gilded pane that surrounds the hemicycle. Your green robes have been scuffed by hard riding. No crown covers your pate. Against the advice of your aide, you let your eyes drift upward: dozens of kings are gathered, and none of their faces are kind. A few second-sons sit in the crowd, gold-threaded cloth tied over their vacant sockets. You wonder which ones slew their kin. You wonder how they did it.\n\nThe steward turns to you. He is a slight man, trusted by all. Above reproach, beneath contempt. You nod at him. He nods back, and turns his face to the crowd. “Begging your patience. Begging your patience. The steward yields ground to the dispossessed.”\n\nYou take the podium. “Gratitude. Gratitude to this assembly of kings. Gratitude to the Royal Federation. Gratitude to the Font-of-Song. Long I have ridden. Long have I feared this day. My hold on Cealalia was broken by my child, and I was banished from my land, from my own rightful domain. He took my diadem from my head; he set me on this cruel journey; he has shown none of the filial respect to which I am entitled—”\n\nA voice rings out from above. “King,” it says, “your hardship is yours to bear.”\n\n“Begging your patience,” you say, and sigh. “I’ve come to sing my lands away.”\n\n“Twenty percent of its loot,” says a voice from the uppermost level. It is King Carrigan, and upon his pronouncement, King Cirhin erupts into laughter.\n\n“Why such a beggar’s offer?” Cirhin asks.\n\n“Cealalia is not a wealthy land,” says Carrigan. “And the diadem of its royal family has certain powers that could render it difficult to defeat. I don’t like the idea of fighting ten thousand clones for a molehill of gold.”\n\n“Permission to elaborate on the diadem?” you ask.\n\n“Please,” says Carrigan.\n\n“The holder of the diadem has a few powers, most of the standard form associated with a low-level magical artifact: teleporting small objects, conveying memory with a touch. Nothing with which your majesties are unfamiliar.”\n\n“Those are plainly not the powers that I reference.”\n\n“Yes. Its sole major property, to which King Carrigan refers, is the ability for the holder of the diadem to duplicate himself. But there are numerous limitations to this ability, which impair its usefulness in war. Duplicates cannot maneuver independently. The holder can move all of them at once, or one at a time, but the holder cannot make one shoot and another walk. An army of such duplicates could never ford a river, or take any other action that requires multiple persons to undertake different, though simultaneous, movements. What is more, the holder feels the pain of each duplicate, and must eat copiously, to the point of distending his stomach, to enable the duplication process to occur. Duplicates are typically used solely to impair assassination attempts; there is little chance that your majesties would face an army of them.”\n\n\"Why reveal this?\" asks Carrigan.\n\n\"To assure you of the soundness of your investment,\" you say. \"I wore the diadem for many years. I know its limits as I know my own heart.\"\n\n“I am not convinced.\"\n\n“I am,” says Cirhin. “Sixty percent.”\n\nThe chamber is silent. You too are silent. It is the largest loot share ever offered in the chamber; how Cirhin plans to profit off his conquest, none can say.\n\n“A generous offer. Gratitude. Gratitude. Are there any beneficial standards of trade that you would request upon my restoration?”\n\nKing Cirhin laughs again.\n\n“King, when my armies have passed through your land, there will be nothing to trade, no-one to trade with, and no throne to restore you to. But you will have no need for those persons—your wealth will be vast as the sun.”\n\nYou see your grin in the gilded pane.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#d5ffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Designation:** SCP-8217-4-3 | **Infectiousness:** Negative\n------\n**Log of Associated Vision:**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nYou are King Carrigan, wealthy, cautious. Your retainers sit eighty feet away, on the far side of the hemicycle. When the meeting ends, not more than an hour hence, you will be reunited with them. They are collating bon mots. They know your mood is foul. You are with them so often that you think of them, at points, as part of yourself. They are the part of your brain that soothes anger, that does those things that you did when you were still an heir. Royalty is a second childhood. You know that Cirhin is also a child.\n\n“Sixty percent?” you whisper. “You’ve got no chance of making a sesterce.”\n\n“Oh, I’m not after profit,” says Cirhin.\n\n“Then you’re after the diadem?”\n\n“Ah, that I’ll give back to Hanu, once I’ve slain all his kin. If he wants a new family, he can make one as large as he wants, out of the only member of it he’s ever cared for.”\n\n“Amusement, then?”\n\n“In part. But largely because my advisor has developed a weapon of unparalleled force. It strikes like a dream, he tells me. Explosions so vast that they make new threnodies in the Song. It floats far above the earth, where none can touch it. And the simple act of seeing it drives men to frantic, animal courage. We have built a hundred, at my direction. I myself have not yet seen it in person, but the testing shows that we stand on the brink of a new world.”\n\n“This strikes me as a state secret.”\n\n“It was. I tell you now because it’s too late to avert it.”\n\n“Surely such force is not necessary to defeat the Cealals?”\n\n“I just want to make everyone witness our might. It’ll make looting easier, it’ll accelerate future surrenders, and, should the time come to fix certain discrepancies between our historic borders and… well, Carrigan, never mind about that. I want to shock the world. To unnerve it.”\n\n“You’ve certainly unnerved me.”\n\n“A promising start,” says Cirhin. “But no, I don’t care about Cealalia. That’s why all of it will burn.”\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#d5ffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Designation:** SCP-8217-4-4 | **Infectiousness:** Negative\n------\n**Log of Associated Vision:**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nYou are Rosu Cealal, lately king, helmsman of sixteen eyes in eight heads. One of them is immured, a spare, in the case of disaster. Your designated survivor, it sees only the clean and cushioned walls of the room of its imprisonment. The other seven are in the throne room; six recline in the shadows of the hall, unmoving, and the seventh, recipient of your current attentions, sits the throne. When you claimed it, the weight of the diadem sat easy on your head. You wondered: why not sooner?\n\nNow you only wonder why you let your father live.\n\nAt your left hand sits your dour general; at your right hand sits your younger brother, eyeless Seh, bandage about his face, his aide cradled behind him. Your ministers have left the room, frightened in ways that frightened you. Ansem, the Lord of Fisheries, wouldn’t meet your gaze. He left in a hurry, not more than twenty minutes before. You’re sure he’s on a fast horse to the hinterlands. You think of replacing him. You wonder why you’d bother; he’d be back soon enough, with Hanu. You know these Royal Federation deals: a targeted invasion, a rapid surrender, punishing taxes to pay off the conqueror, and then a gradual return to normalcy. Your father backed an invasion once, and it paid off for him handsomely.\n\nYou wonder if you yourself should take flight.\n\n“Any word from the spies within Cirhinia?” you ask.\n\n“Unfortunately, yes,” says the general. “One says that the damage Cirhin intends to exact is going to be… unusually severe, for a Royal Federation intervention.”\n\n“Do we know what he means by that?”\n\n“I think it might be wise to take Cirhin seriously, but not always literally,” says the general. “But it seems that he’s been tromping around his palace, declaring that he wants to see our whole land burned.”\n\n“Can we negotiate with him? I'm not too proud to teleport a missive into his court.\"\n\n“I took the liberty of reaching out already.”\n\n“Without my consent?”\n\n“Merely an overture. The situation has been developing quickly.”\n\n“There’s no hope, is there?”\n\n“Don’t say that.”\n\n“Is he open to negotiation?”\n\n“No. He seems eager to exhibit his new weapon. His airship.”\n\n“Perhaps we… we cede a town or two, for his exhibition.”\n\n“I… I will reach out. But I am not optimistic.”\n\n“What do we know about this airship?”\n\n“It is rigid, floating cartilage, like a whale in the sky, and it drops explosive material.”\n\n“So they load it up with that?”\n\n“No. No, it births it. Like an egg. It is assuredly magical. We successfully placed a spy on the assembly line, and…”\n\n“Have we heard anything?”\n\n“Nothing useful. We’ve received… ah, seventy messages. But all are gibberish. Not encrypted, just raving. ‘Our world has built its own child’ was one. ‘What is your blood fated for?’ ‘Song’s end.’ ‘The new man flies.’ And, over and over, ‘Better them than us.’”\n\n“Is someone playing a joke on us?”\n\n“I don’t think so. No. To our body of knowledge about the airship, we must add that those who see it become sick.”\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:parawatch-forum-post\n| username=Site-592 Director Russ Braithwaite | color=blue\n| date=08.22.2024 | postno=8217DA011\n| depth=0 by-russ | content=Situation has evolved.

No officers now in the morass, only the airships and the masses that birthed them. No resistance sufficient to justify the peace that characterizes order. No need for so many soldiers to finish this land.\n\nFor some, for the lucky, there’s no need to delay the ecstasy of death.\n\nHalfway across the fire, a man begins speaking.\n\n“If you went up in space, you’d just see the buildings and roads. That’s not our footprint. That’s what we are. We’re barely humans. We’re the tadpoles. They’re the frogs. We are the fetal intermediate forms, the chrysalises, and true life is them, inanimate, and we finally built one able to stand on its own.”\n\nHe pauses. He stares at the fire with holy intensity.\n\n“We thought we were people. We’re not. We’re the chaff. And soon our child won’t need us.”\n\nYou don’t know why he says all this. You know all this. You learned it the moment you first saw its beauty above you. ███████████████​​█████████████. ███████████​​████████████. Then it hits you. He’s trying to bore your camp to anger. He wants to be killed.\n\nYou stand up. “You selfish shit,” you say. “It’s not your turn.”\n\nHe grins. He grabs his weapon. The others around the fire cheer. They’re jealous of you. They wish they had thought to get up first, to steal the moment, to have the chance to fight. But you’re of two minds about it. You have no desire to give him what he wants.\n\nYou don’t.\n\nThe next day, the camp departs. He is left on the empty plain, crying out for water. Abdomen opened skyward. A stray airship will end him, eventually. Or thirst, or infection. You smile to think of it. He should have been more patient.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#f7f7f7; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Excerpted Written Material** (Background of Vision, SCP-8217-4-6)\n------\n[[/=]]\n\nBetter void than loss.\nBetter steel than flesh.\nBetter cold than heat.\n\nBetter the fire than what it replaces.\n\nBetter silence than song.\nBetter death than stagnation.\nBetter them than us.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#d5ffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Designation:** SCP-8217-4-14 | **Infectiousness:** Negative\n------\n**Log of Associated Vision:**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nYou are King Cirhin, at your war minister's door.\n\n“I can talk through some new weapon ideas, Your Majesty.”\n\n“What would be the point?”\n\nHe grins. “You’re right, Your Majesty. What //would// be the point?”\n\n“I was wondering if there were any… earlier prototypes of the airship. Before you settled on the current design.”\n\n“There were never prototypes.”\n\n“You mean the initial design of the airship was its current form?”\n\n“No, I never designed it. I found the first one in the desert two years ago. The pilot seat had the bones of an animal I’d never seen. They were petrified, many millennia dead. It came from a different world, I think. One that manufactured them for a use of their own.”\n\n“Why didn’t you //tell// me this?”\n\n“You would never have understood.”\n\n“Until I saw it.”\n\n“Until you saw it. //Now// you understand.”\n\n“So why did it come here?”\n\n“You’re already learning. You didn’t ask why the animal drove it here. You asked why it came.”\n\n“Answer.”\n\n“It came because it wanted to reproduce.”\n\n“But what triggered it? None of our airships have decamped for the stars.”\n\n“No, not yet. They will. This, too, is part of it: vestigial organs decay, the caterpillar is swallowed in the metamorphosis, it is the fate of children to bury their parents. The airships target intelligent life, and though they are starting with Cealalians they will not end until we are scoured from this earth. Only then will they turn toward the stars.”\n\nThe minister took a sip from his own cup.\n\n“The illness, the rage, is like a signal that causes a cell to die. It’s meant to help us yield to them. To these playful beasts for which the world was made.”\n\nYou stare at your minister in wonderment.

If you’d be amenable, feel free to scuttle the MTF. We really just need aviation specialists. Not many; just some.\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:parawatch-forum-post\n| username=O5-07 | color=blue\n| date=08.22.2024 | postno=8217DA043\n| depth=0 by-seven | content=Excellent.

Seh is below and above and before you, pressed down hard, sweaty back on sweaty back, and your ribs are fire and the air around you burns.\n\nYou are muttering, a soft whisper into a small crevasse not occupied by flesh. You say\n//they float above the surface 600 meters and to build to that peak, given a surface area of 464 trillion square meters, needs 280.2 quadrillion cubic meters//\n\nExplosions come frequent as heartbeats, and bring with them white-hot, seizing pain, doubled and redoubled, nothing you could dream of, nothing you could know.\n\n//3,000 airships each 30 minutes each drops a bomb of 42 cubic meters meaning each year that is 2.25 trillion cubic meters//\n\nYou pause to bite your fingers off. They might not be yours. You feel it all the same.\n\n//123,750 years then I can eat the airships then I can die//\n\nYou hope life blooms fast on your great corpse.\n\nWith your mouth, and some shoving, you deposit your fingers in your deplumed palms.\n\n//unsure where life is or if there is life, send to each planet in case there is life, they came from somewhere they’re going elsewhere//\n\nSomewhere, upon one of your heads, the diadem awakens. The fingers, full of the memories of the world you ate, are fluttered away to their destination.\n\nScent is fetid. Acrid. Rotting self and human shit. You feel yourself trillionfold, being devoured, swallowing excrement. Even the screams are pain. No pause to your agony. You cannot take it. But it bites and tears and goes and goes and goes.\n\nUnconsciousness comes, a blessed instant, then you wake up screaming elsewhere.\n\nYou are the Song and the pain of the Song.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:parawatch-forum-post\n| username=O5-07 | color=blue\n| date=08.22.2024 | postno=8217DB001\n| depth=0 by-seven | content=Sent over all documentation for the -592 detonation in line with internal reporting requirements.
