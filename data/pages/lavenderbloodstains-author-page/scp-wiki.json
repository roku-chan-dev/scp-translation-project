Back at the beginning of 2018, I had read [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub The Cool War] and hoped to make a series of tales to rival it. Tension was supposed to be the first of this tale series, but unfortunately I lost traction shortly after publishing it. My comment on the article states \"more to come at a later date,\" and that may still be true, but I have no idea how much later.[[footnote]]At this rate, the time may never come.[[/footnote]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-4084\" hide=\"- SCP-4084\"]]\n> **SCP-4084, Then Who Was Phone?**\n> Based loosely off a true experience of mine, this article was meant to instill a general fear of the unknown and explore the fear of impersonation and replacement. Within minutes of posting, the article had already gained 2 upvotes, a very positive sign indeed. Though I feel the article may be lacking an actual \"narrative\" as most SCPs nowadays do, the reception assures that sometimes its okay to be ambiguous. The less you know, the more there is to be afraid of, after all.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The Gallows Tree\" hide=\"- The Gallows Tree\"]]\n> **The Gallows Tree:**\n> Probably my least favorite article that I've written thus far[[footnote]]Once upon a time, I had a dream of rewriting this article. I decided to leave it be and let this 5 year old article be itself.[[/footnote]], only because of how I limited myself. The concept of a vengeful dryad who was wrongfully convicted in life, and now goes around hanging people in a vain attempt to convict the \"true\" criminals, is a very interesting one that I should have done more with. Instead, I had the Serpent's Hand pretty effortlessly subdue her, mitigating the horror of her concept, and included a member who wanted to fuck her, reducing her even further. She started off as a horrific concept that I mitigated because I felt it was //too// horrifying. But, the SCP site is a horror website, and I've realized now that I probably shouldn't be limiting my horror on a site about horrifying people with your writing. In the future, I hope to imbue a little more raw fear, terror, and/or horror into my articles.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Translations]]\n**SCP-4084:**\n* Chinese Branch: [http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4084 SCP-4084: 所以谁曾是电话] by [[user reinkn]]\n* Japanese Branch: [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/scp-4084 SCP-4084: じゃああの電話は誰だったんだ？] by [[user walksoldi]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Favorites]]\n**SCPs:**\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii SCP-001: djkaktus's Proposal III]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3201 SCP-3201: well, it was low-entropy while it lasted.]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-261 SCP-261: Pan-Dimensional Vending]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-055 SCP-055: (unknown)]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3090 SCP-3090: This girl's gone bad on a game attack!]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3557 SCP-3557: CK or OK?]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-811 SCP-811: Swamp Woman]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5500 SCP-5500: Death of the Authors]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4040 SCP-4040: At The Bottom Of A Bottomless Pit]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3309 SCP-3309: Where We Go When We Fade, Fade Away]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal SCP-001: S Andrew Swann's Proposal]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5309 SCP-5309: not to exist.]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5667/comments/show SCP-5667: The Greenlights]\n\n**Tales:**\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-shape-of-a-gun The Shape of a Gun]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo Ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo ooo]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/punching-the-mirror-in-its-stupid-face Punching The Mirror In Its Stupid Face]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-library The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Library]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sometimes-it-s-not-funny Sometimes It's Not Funny]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/isabels-happy-meal Dr. Isabel Helga Anastasia Parvati Wondertainment, V is Displeased With Her Happy Meal]\n\n**GoI Formats:**\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corncrake-of-destiny The Corncrake of Destiny]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hypnotraline 'Hypnotraline' (TR7K2/2UD9X/53GN8)]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-dark-web-dke79-o2rg5-4jlw6 'The Dark Web' (DKE79/O2RG5/4JLW6)]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/my-head-is-on-fire-and-im-not-ok My Head Is On Fire And I'm (Not) Ok]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/grant-request-for-utilization-of-electro-thaumic-computers-t GRANT REQUEST FOR UTILIZATION OF ELECTRO-THAUMIC COMPUTERS TO PERFORM EXORCISMS OF DEMONIC ENTITIES]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hello-i-am-an-eldritch-horror Hello, I Am an Eldritch Horror]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/koi-format KoI Format]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-wanderer-s-library-is-not-enough The Wanderer's Library is Not Enough]\n\n**Groups of Interest:**\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/are-we-cool-yet-hub Are We Cool Yet?]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/black-queen-hub The Black Queen]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/serpent-s-hand-hub The Serpent's Hand]\n\n**Canons:**\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-cool-war-hub The Cool War]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub The Antimemetics Division]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/end-of-death-hub End of Death]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/apotheosis-hub Apotheosis]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/stealingsolidarityhub Stealing Solidarity]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Sandboxes]]\n* [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/lavenderbloodstains My Main Sandbox.]\n* [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/temmieflakes42old My First Junkyard.]\n* [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/lavenderbloodstains2 My Second Junkyard.][[footnote]]I have so many discarded drafts I actually managed to exceed the character limit on a single Wikidot page.

Her name is Lavender.\n|width=300px\n]]\nMy name is Julianna Basco. I am a 24 year old Polish-American transgender woman, born in New Jersey on October 31st, 2000. I have graduated from college with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with concentrations in Design Studies and English Literature, and I wrote a 43-page final thesis on the history of war correspondence in America. As I was born on Halloween, my zodiac sign is ##005682|Scorpio.## My favorite color is lavender, specifically the hex code [[span style=\"background-color:black;\"]]##C7BFE6|#C7BFE6.##[[/span]] What kind of person even has a specific hex code as their favorite color? Me, apparently. My favorite dish is basically any type of curry, my favorite candy is dark chocolate, and my favorite drink is root beer.\n\nEver since I learned how to talk, I've always been interested in telling stories to others. I dabble in various artistic mediums and have a lot of experience with writing, as well as moderate experience with drawing and composing music. Aside from my artistic endeavors, I enjoy playing video games and tabletop roleplaying games quite a lot. I have thousands of hours in various games on Steam.\n\nI've been playing Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition since January 2017. Check out some of the original campaigns I've run on my personal Wikidot:\n* [http://the-compendium.wikidot.com/series:disciples-of-atropus Disciples of Atropus (DnD 5e)]\n* [http://the-compendium.wikidot.com/series:sunstokers Sunstokers (Skyfarer)]\n\nWriting for the SCP Foundation has been difficult, but it's a struggle I've been working at since March 2016. Luckily, three of my attempts have been successes. In the future, I hope to continue to write for the SCP Foundation and create articles that are both intriguing to the reader and meet my own personal expectations of my work.\n\n//Last Updated: 01/18/2025//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Social Media]]\n* [https://bsky.app/profile/lavenderstains.bsky.social My Bluesky.]\n* [https://www.twitch.tv/lavenderbloodstains My Twitch.]\n* [http://stainedinlavenderblood.tumblr.com My Tumblr.]\n* [https://twitter.com/lavenderstains My Twitter.]\n* [https://soundcloud.com/stainedinlavenderblood My SoundCloud.]\n* [https://steamcommunity.com/id/stainedinlavenderblood/ My Steam.]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHsRXOM0cUc1JQdoJqz6Sg My YouTube.]\n* [https://www.fallenlondon.com/profile/Julianna%20Foxglove My Fallen London Character.]\n* juli9800 - My Discord.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Fandoms]]\nSome of my favorite fandoms, listed in order of most favorite, that have most heavily influenced my work:\n\n* Fallen London / Sunless Sea / Sunless Skies\n* Hello Charlotte\n* Disco Elysium\n* Doctor Who\n* Murder Drones\n* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n* Discworld\n* Land of the Lustrous\n* Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\n* Adventure Time\n* The Adventure Zone\n* Mob Psycho 100\n* Zombie Land Saga\n* Wolf 359\n* The Magnus Archives\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Achievements]]\n[[=]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=scl]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=srs]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=pvr]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=lgbt]]\n[[/=]]\n\n* I am the creator of the [https://bit.ly/3gDyXbU \"(Song) But It Keeps Getting Faster\"] meme.\n* I have a CTE certificate in Graphic Design.\n* I have 100% of the achievements in 22 games on Steam, including Elden Ring, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls 3.

If I fail to respond within one month, they may be granted permission to rewrite my work within my guidelines.\n\n- It is important that the core concept of my work, whether it be an anomaly, a tale, or a Group of Interest format page, is preserved. This includes the personality of any characters included therein. Characters may be entirely cut from the article if it is felt that they do not work and/or contribute nothing to the narrative, but their personalities may not be changed. Dialogue may be altered so long as it meets this guideline.\n\n- I understand that the personality of a fictional character is something that can only be truly known by their original creator, and thus any mention of keeping a character's personality intact is to be understood within the purview of the rewrite author and the community's subjective interpretations of the character's personality. If the community feels that changes to the character's dialogue and actions have caused their personality to deviate too far from their original incarnation, corrections should be made accordingly.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
