Testing through Procedure 10-Inti may be carried out through an application to the site director, Dr. Lisle Naismith. Blank applications may be found at the Site-59 safe wing receptionist's desk. Test subjects may only be pulled from available D-class personnel that have been scheduled for termination.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4337 is a fixed-blade combat knife, 38 cm in length. A sand-engraved decal of three crescent moons is present on either side of the blade.\n\nThrough Procedure 10-Inti, SCP-4337 can cause an e-mailed form letter to appear in the inbox of the surviving participant after two hours. Due to the triple-crescent motif being analogous to other objects in Foundation custody (including [[[SCP-3319]]] and [[[SCP-3922]]]), the message is believed to be extradimensional in origin.\n\n**Recovery Log:** On 12/21/2018, the location of the original instance of SCP-4337 was relayed to the Foundation in an e-mail from [[[SCP-2578]]]-D, on the grounds that the object's original owners were \"senile cultists\" that had been \"using the device to make libelous claims.\"\n\nSCP-4337 was recovered by Foundation Agents in a house in ██████████, Missouri. All three residents had been shot from orbit by SCP-2578-D ten hours prior to discovery; their bodies had not yet been found by local authorities. Seven adult corpses were discovered in the basement; cause of death had been sharp force trauma to the heart.\n\nDocuments recovered alongside SCP-4337 led to the formation of Procedure 10-Inti:\n\n# One D-class subject (\"Participant\") is to be given a question by a second party (\"Celebrant\")\n# Immediately after, the celebrant is to stab the participant in the heart.\n\nThe resulting message will attempt to answer the question.\n\n**Test Log (entry 1 of 1):**\n\n**Participant:** D-59932\n\n**Celebrant:** Researcher Paulsen\n\n**Question:** \"How do we neutralize SCP-████?\"\n\n**Response:**\n\n> +++ ☽☽☽\n> \n> Dear [**PAULSEN/CATHERINE_KENT**] of [**EARTH_2N**]\n> \n> Hello, my name is [%fieldvarC], and I'll be handling your support ticket today.
