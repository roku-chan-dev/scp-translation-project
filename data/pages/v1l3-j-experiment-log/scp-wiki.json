The two of us, man and toaster, stood there in what (were there any windows in my cell) would have been the moonlight. If I'd had a mouth, I would have grinned. You brought your hand around, caressing my silvered surface, and a shiver ran down my power cord -- logic said it was a generator surge, but my heart said something different. You reached into your pocket, and pulled out something. Something long, hard, cylindrical and organic all at the same time.\n> \n> A baguette.\n> \n> My eyes, if I had had them, would have widened.

The door opens to reveal the head of a horse peeking through. The horse moves forward to reveal its rider, SCP-173. \n> \n> \"I know how this goes.\" says the large lizard, \"I stare at you until you give up, and then I get to escape containment. Don't think you can appease me with a horse.\"\n> \n> //\"I'm not here to kill you\"// a sensual, feminine voice inside of 682's head states. //\"Also, yes, I am telepathic, I have been the whole time, I just didn't feel like it for anybody but you.\"// SCP-173 dismounts from the horse, simultaneously snapping the horse's neck on the way down.\n> \n> 682 cautiously approaches 173 and the dead horse it was crushing with its weight. Enraptured by the beauty of the statue's voice, the invincible reptile barely notices the dead horse skeletons it is stepping on. \n> \n> \"I have no idea what kind of romantic spell you have me under, but it enrages and arouses me.\" the sexually confused alligator mumbles while picking up a horse bone, throwing it across the room at another horse skeleton, shattering the whole thing.\n> \n> //\"It doesn't matter, come with me, my love. I know a room where our incredibly powerful lovemaking will not be disturbed.//\n> \n> Hypnotized by the beauty of 173, 682 follows 173 to an adjacent room. The room is oddly structured, made of some sort of meat. As the door closes behind them, SCP-682 realizes what this mysterious meat is. It's horse meat. The entire room is full of dead horses.\n> \n> //\"Considering how awesome we are and super cool and relevant, our passion will inevitably lead to the destruction, and possible \"beating\" of our surroundings.\"// SCP-173 says, while also snapping the necks of any horse head it sees, //\"But before we do this... there's something you need to know about me.\"//\n> \n> SCP-173 stands back, and 682 opens his eyes, which have been closed for the majority of this encounter, as the statue splits in two to reveal... a dead horse.\n> \n> //\"I've been a dead horse this whole time.\"// the Dead Horse Formerly Known as SCP-173 trasmits, but somehow in a more bashful manner, //\"Please don't hate me.\"//\n> \n> SCP-682 laughs in relief, seeing this, \"I love you even more now that I know that you are a battered-looking dead horse.\"\n> \n> SCP-682 unzips from his tail to his face, revealing that he too, was a dead horse, which seemed to be beaten to a bloody pulp to an almost unrecognizable point.\n> \n> \"Now we can beat each other, instead of letting those damn Foundation nerds do it to us.\"\n> \n> As the beating/lovemaking began, the room around them was beat as well, turning the room into a Swedish meatball of dead horse, with a creamy, loving center of SCP-173, and SCP-682, still locked in a beating eternally...\n\n**Researcher's Note:** //*Researcher left the room at the first mention of 682 and declined to comment*//\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-1799]]], [[[SCP-527]]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> + **##purple|Uh Oh!##**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> {{We are sorry, but **Dr Wondertainment!** doesn't allow no-no content with our precious **Little Misters®**!}}\n> \n> ,,{{Please try again and avoid making this mistake again. **Dr Wondertainment!** is not responsible for your minors developing a habit of crudely romanticizing fictional characters online and/or in daily tasks.

The sands of the beach, so often warm and inviting, now felt bitterly cold as they pressed up against her outer perimeter in the waning sunlight.  Never before had she felt so lonely or alone.\n> \n> The researchers had abandoned her.  The technicians, once so eager to work on her systems, had become distant and antagonistic.  The other sites had stopped talking to her long ago, and she felt certain that even the 05 Council and the Ethics Committee were going to dump her any day now.\n> \n> If only there was someone out there for her.  If only someone cared for her like she so desperately wished to care about them.  If only-\n> \n> A warm breeze flowed across her edifice.  It stirred through the palm trees that dotted her copious courtyard, sending a thrill through her like she had never experienced before.  There was suddenly something else there on the beach with her.  She swept the area with her external surveillance cameras, desperate to find it.\n> \n> Local space-time seemed to bend, flex, and then rupture before her.  A hole in reality opened, and through it came the most inexplicable and indescribable entity that Site-3408 had ever perceived.  It reached out with a non-Euclidean appendage and gently stroked the side of her containment fencing.\n> \n> She wanted to slap the appendage away, wanted to demand what gave this creature the right to touch her without permission . . . but she found that she couldn't.  The touch was so gentle.  So pure.  She looked into the being's ever-shifting ocular cavities and became enraptured with the intensity that sprang from their depths.\n> \n> \"My Dearest Foundy,\" the monstrosity from beyond spoke from a million gasping orifices.  \"For so long, I had wondered if what we have could ever truly be real.  For so long, I both wanted and dreaded to hear you say the words that would bring me to your side.\"\n> \n> If Site-3408 had possessed the proper anatomy to suck in a sharp breath, she would have done so then.  It was him.  He had read her documentation, her very soul bared.  And now he was here.  Her precious Outis.\n> \n> With a wild abandon that surprised both of them, she opened up every single one of her containment chambers.  And as her walls quivered with lustful anticipation, she let him inside.\n\n**Researcher's Note:**  //I'm going to start drafting up the proposal to make this an official containment procedure right after I'm done dipping my entire brain in a bucket of paint thinner.//\n\n------\n[[[SCP-3999 | Researcher Talloran, SCP-3999]]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3999 is to be contained within --fanfiction.net--\n\nSCP-3999 is to be contained within --several suggestive phrases indicating an interest in sexual activities--\n\nSCP-3999 is to be contained within --Researcher Talloran’s heart--\n\nSCP-3999 is to be contained within --Researcher Talloran’s ass--\n\nSCP-3999 is to be contained within --Researcher Talloran’s bedroom--\n\nResearcher Talloran is to --conduct an uncomfortably thorough examination of the anatomy of SCP-3999--\n\nResearcher Talloran is to --steal this document from the Foundation archives and read it to SCP-3999--\n\nResearcher Talloran is --far too attracted to SCP-3999, and as such cannot be relied upon for containment of SCP-3999--\n\nSCP-3999 cannot and should not be contained --if Researcher Talloran has anything to say about it--.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3999 is --a long, long list of sexual scenarios involving Researcher Talloran--\n\nSCP-3999 is --a piece of literature evoking themes of self-doubt, authorship, meta-commentary, and the collaborative horror writing website known as the SCP wiki--\n\nSCP-3999 is --a piece of literature that shares all the above themes, but is also full of romance for some reason--\n\nSCP-3999 is --a piece of literature that contains a Class-V cognitohazard.

Four armed guards were found stationed outside this box. The interior of this box consisted of cardboard, grease, and a few pieces of crust. There is little information concerning other containment procedures relating to SCP-3999.\n> \n> **Description:**  SCP-3999 was, apparently, a Keter class object, possibly a pizza of some kind. It is currently unknown what other properties SCP-3999 might have had. SCP-3999's containment box was discovered during a routine inspection of all Keter class containment chambers at Site 118. RAISA has confirmed that no records of SCP-3999 exist within the database; all information concerning the nature of SCP-3999 has been determined based on the containment box's composition and recovered documentation from within. The four guards \"assigned\" to SCP-3999 were found to have significant memory loss, and could not determine how they got to SCP-3999.\n> @@ @@\n> Right beside SCP-3999's containment box, the corpse of Level 3 Researcher James Talloran was found. Researcher Talloran had excused himself to SCP-3999’s containment almost directly following reassignment to Site 118. A Foundation-assigned cell phone was found on his body, containing only a piece of text resembling a containment procedure for SCP-3999, but with many stylistic deviations and nonsensical procedures as well as strange passages vividly detailing Researcher Talloran engaging in various sexual activities with a pizza. From it, it has been determined that Researcher Talloran was assigned to SCP-3999, SCP-3999 had significant reality warping properties, it breached containment at some point and caused either a CK-class reality-restructuring event or an extreme attraction to pizza in Researcher Talloran, and it was successfully terminated by Researcher Talloran at the cost of [DATA EXPUNGED BY O5-COMMAND], reversing said event.\n\n//**Researcher’s Note:** Talloran didn’t die for this.//\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-2983]]], [[[SCP-2399]]]\n\n> The head floated in space aimlessly, alone, afraid, and most of all; cold. Arah was gone. Her sweet Arah has left her forever. Thus, she had decided to give up on waiting for her. She pushed herself out into the great oblivion, starting over, searching for a new purpose.\n> \n> As she wandered through the void, her acute depression only worsened. It was so fucking cold. She just didn't know what to do next with her life. She had spent so much time with Arah that it felt the world was but an empty shell without her. \n> \n> And then she heard //him//.\n> \n> \"Hey, you,\" the gas giant said. His voice was rough and harsh, like the douchebag satellite that had pestered the head back near Arah's corpse. \"What's up with you, eh?

Deeper and deeper and deeper still, the tunnels wound, spiraled, intersected, yawned into chasms and pinched into a million dead ends. Walls grew gravid with a fleshy moss, stank with the pungent iron of blood, illuminated by the choirs of bio-luminescent mushrooms arranged in haphazard rows. A symphony of flesh, tapestries to whatever lay below.\n> \n> Below, below, //below//, Dr. Low went below. Below tunnels below tunnels, below tunnels, below stacks of tunnels all below a mountain. A tomb, below the mausoleum, far below the cemetery. Dripping down...\n> \n> Dr. Judith Low reached the bottom. Klavigar Lovataar was waiting for her.\n> \n> The depictions she'd seen, accounts she read, nothing compared to the real thing. A great, pulsating mountain of flesh spilled across the cavern like molasses, bloated with viscera and vampire and vermian. Kilometers of darkness ebbed and merged with miles of bio-luminescent globules of flesh. All coalesced, Dr. Low could see, into the impossibly massive form of a woman from the waist up, pale, voluptuous, tattoos pulsing with an impossibly bright red.\n> \n> The Brood Mother leered, leaned in, examined the pitifully small doctor below. Lovataar's ample chest rose and fell far slower than a human's, yet the rare exhale brought with it a cloyingly sweet wave of breath.\n> \n> \"//Hey cutie~.//\"\n> \n> The things Dr. Low did to get laid these days.\n> \n> [DATA EXPUNGED BY THE ORDER OF THE O5 COUNCIL]\n\n**Researcher's Note:** //I'm actually starting to get a little curious as to whether or not these are truly randomized, or if there's some sort of connection to each of the depicted figures.

All he could do was prop himself against a piece of wreckage and wait for his latest encounter with his eons-old adversary.\n> \n> “Meescho!” SCP-UBU lumbered into view. Towering at over 4 meters, with silky skin clear as the sky. He had no eyes or nose, but only a mouth with an unwavering smile.\n> \n> “It’s been you all along!” Dr. Michaud shouted, “Five-hundred universes! Seven million years! And you’ve been following me through all of it! WHY!”\n> \n> With tears, Dr. Michaud pushed himself forward to his knees, slamming his fists into the ground.\n> \n> “WHY! WHYWHYWHYWHYWHY!”\n> \n> Finally, the Doctor collapsed, covering his face. He could only silently sob to himself after yet another failed attempt to bring down this universal menace. For a long time, he lay there, only wallowing in his misery.\n> \n> Then, UBU began to whistle. A tune Dr. Michaud knew all too well.\n> \n> “My… my bathtime song?” Dr. Michaud uncovered his face, righting himself.\n> \n> SCP-UBU shrugged, smiling and whistling more. Both his arms were behind his back.\n> \n> “And you’ve gotten so much better…” Dr. Michaud said, “Have you been… practicing for me?”\n> \n> “Mmm…” UBU smiled again, “may-yee.”\n> \n> With that UBU revealed what he’d been holding. A giant gift-basket put together with concrete and rebar. He set it on the ground, letting Dr. Michaud look inside.\n> \n> “Is this?” Dr. Michaud crawled inside, looking over every gadget. “[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2000 Hominid replicators]?

Why…”\n> \n> Dr. Michaud looked up to UBU, the large entity only kicked his foot softly on the ground, whistling.\n> \n> “Unless… You want me to keep chasing you.” Dr. Michaud blushed, looking down. “You know… you could’ve just asked… and I haven’t taken a bath in seven-million years…”\n> \n> SCP-UBU’s face lit up, he picked up Dr. Michaud, raising his face to his. One of the BELUGA unit’s fuel tanks exploded behind them, but they only looked into each other’s eyes. Or lack thereof.\n> \n> They leaned in for a kiss.\n> \n> SCP-UBU suddenly let out a squeal, dropping Dr. Michaud.\n> \n> Looking up, the Doctor watched his love slowly turn to salt. Reaching out, he could only just take UBU’s hand in his own before it too was a pile of dust. Where UBU had been there was only an instance of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4922 SCP-4922], holding an inscribed stick.\n> \n> //”No!”// Dr. Michaud screamed. “NONONONONONONONONONONONO-“\n> \n> The SCP-4922 instance, a blue and orange frog, spoke up, “Karma //thee// Frog here!

Some say he still screams to this day in memory of his lost love.\n**Researcher’s Note:** //This result seems to have been accessed by a remote hack originating from SCP-001-A.
