Written by [[*user Faminepulse]].\n* [[[AIAD Homescreen]]] - \"Wait, isn't this old news?\" Well now it's much more than a tale series! It's a full-fledged canon!

Well...\n\n* Over in Japan, a company known as Roll&Role Books has made an RPG book based on our work! It's currently being sold, and the licensing checks out fine. You can check it out [http://www.shinkigensha.co.jp/book/978-4-7753-1410-4/ here].\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc9laXXW8wVp5nH5zo0DOvg TheHauntedReader] has done a pretty good job reading [[[Experiment Log 455]]], capturing both the creepiness and the occasional bits of humor relief that come through in the article. You can listen [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lpcq0l5HeTI here]! This guy, in general, has done a lot of good SCP readings, which I highly recommend.\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMybbiNZwNOhCXEzROahtw Tats TopVideos] has done a number of solid Top Lists videos, including a couple on the Foundation itself. And now they've done a new video on the Foundation! Check out their take on the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2cvmkyS2iI Top 18 Building SCPs]; there may even be a few ones you haven't discovered before.\n\n++++ Fanart\n\n* What better way to kick off this fanart section than with one of the most awe-inspiring works of SCP-682 that I've seen yet? [http://otkman1995.deviantart.com/ OTKMan1995] brings us [http://otkman1995.deviantart.com/art/They-were-disgusting-594797126 this art] of 682 in all of its disgusting, huge, monstrous glory. No wonder its so hard to contain!\n* Let's diverge into silliness, with [http://dewery2539.deviantart.com/ dewery2539]'s fanart of SCP-105 and [http://scp-th.wikidot.com/scp-777-th-j SCP-777-TH-J], a pretty good joke article on one of the other branches! The fanart is [http://dewery2539.deviantart.com/art/SCP-777-TH-J-SCP-105-599259606 here]. I just hope neither of them are getting DUIs.\n* Speaking of silly, [https://twitter.com/TORI_UMA505 TORIギョーザ] brings us this [https://twitter.com/TORI_UMA505/status/709357703676567552 nice drawing] of Dr. Roget, Dr. Django Bridge, and Research Assistant Corbette in their downtime on the job. All the goofballs together in one shot.\n* Quickly diverging over to PIXIV, [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=6463194 華氏４５１] has a [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=56031289 photo album][[footnote]]NSFW for blood/injuries and partial nudity.[[/footnote]] chock full of neat drawings! Some highlights include: a wounded Dr. Gerald with [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-040-jp SCP-040-JP], Clef and 173 [[[date-night|staring into each other's eyes]]], and a super-suave 049.\n* [http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=281414 雨見鶏] brings us an image absolutely filled of various SCPs [http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=56112209 hanging out] in a room together! Can you guess all the SCPs without clicking the read more?\n* To round out March's fanart section, let's look at [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/ AlishmcMalish]'s playing cards! Cards seem to be a popular fit with SCP, wouldn't you agree? The works highlighted in particular (since I couldn't just pick one) are of [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/art/SCP-1440-599870845 SCP-1440] as the king and [http://alishmcmalish.deviantart.com/art/SCP-085-600041111 SCP-085] as the queen. Pretty fitting if you ask me :)\n\n------\n\nThanks for tuning in again, folks! I tried something a bit different since this is the first edition with an ongoing tale series for that month (and March had two!). Let me know if this approach works, or if it should be formatted differently for ease of reading.\n\nAs a side-note, I won't be around to do April's edition, so if you wish to send blurbs for your articles that month, send a PM to [[*user rumetzen]]. Thank you all for continuing to be an excellent community <3\n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[news-02-2016|February 2016]]] | __[[[news-03-2016|March 2016]]]__ | [[[news-04-2016|April 2016]]] »**\n[[/=]]",
