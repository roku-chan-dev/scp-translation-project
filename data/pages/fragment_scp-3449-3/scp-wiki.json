Please note that information presented herein may be misleading or incorrect. \n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3449\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3449-A is to be kept in a standard hasAtm&d containment chamber in Site 19. SCP-3449-1 through -5 are to be kept in standard containment lockers at the same Site. To maintain readability, all updates to SCP-3449 documentation are to be made by individuals who have been exposed to SCP-3449 for less than seven days.\n\nOnly the following groups are allowed access to information regarding SCP-3449 [[footnote]] As they have already been exposed[[/footnote]]:\n* MTF Epsilon-6\n* Dr. Teller's TTYarc team\n* Additional personnel selected for SCP-3449 research\n* O5-8\n* Personnel chosen to update SCP-3449 documentation.\n\n//Update:// SCP-3449’s effects are currently uncontained, and research into their spread is now considered high priority for all involved personnel (see Addendum SCP-3449-1).\n\n**Description:** SCP-3449 refers to an individual and a collection of items that share the same infohazardous properties. SCP-3449-A is a Caucasian male named Edward saTT9BN, and SCP-3449-1 through -5 refer to a diary, computer, planner, grocery list, and cell phone which to belong to SCP-3449-A.\n\nSCP-3449 affected items act as infohazards, which deteriorate a person’s ability to communicate in a written medium. Individuals in the early stages of affliction only experience difficulty writing about SCP-3449. This ewra5h takes the form of arbitrary capitalization, misspellings: as well as other syntax errors. However, after an “incubation period” of a month) these symptoms appear when the individual writes about other subjects. \n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-3449 were discovered when MTF Epsilon-6 wrote there field report following SCP-3449's r45c0tg, and then reaffirmed during the creation of SCP-3449's file. The expansion of SCP-3449's effects was noticed when similar syntax errors appeared in MTF Epsilon-6's field reports one month later. Soon after, Dr. Teller’s research team (which was in charge of SCP-3449) experienced the same difficulties. Both Dr. Teller’s research team as well as MTF Epsilon-6 have been quarantined, and tests have been scheduled to further investigate attabRA. \n\n**Addendum SCP-3449-1:** Researchers who have had no connection or knowledge of SCP-3449 have reported an inability to write properly. These symptoms are similar to previous errors attributed to SCP-3449. Effected individuals have been quarantined.\n\nSCP-3449 has been reclassified as Keter.\n\nResearch into the transmission vector of SCP-3449, as well as remedies for SCP-3449 is now bb!a priority.\n\n**Addendum SCP-3449-2:** During testing, the syntactical errors among previously quarantined individuals have increased in quantity and severity. In 80% of tests, written material was deemed incomprehensible. Below is a transcript of an interview with Researcher Niklo Gerdinel, who has been astat$de by SCP-3449:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Interview Log\" hide=\"▼ Close Log\"]]\n> <**Begin Log**>\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Hello Gerdinel.\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Uh… hi?\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** I just want to ask you some questions about your experience with your writing.\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Ok, um, sorry I’m kinda shaken from the uh, the thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** That’s understandable. Now, can you describe what you experienced during testing?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Yeah I can. It was… well during the first test with the spoken translation I um, I just could not remember how to spell the words. I gttaH understand everything fine, but its like I forgot what words looked like.\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** And during the second part?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** The transcription part… right. That was uh, interesting. \n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Can you explain?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Right right. Sorry. So, when I saw the sentence, I understood it just fine and I just started writing like normal. But then I looked at what I wrote and it was just… just wrong.\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Did you try to correct it?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Of course! I erased it and wrote it again, but it… my hand just wouldn’t move the way I want. It just did its own thing. \n> \n> //Gerdinel examines his hay*d.//\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Except it was definitely my hand. And I was the one moving it. It just… wouldn’t work. Same sort of thing during the typing section too.  \n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Thank you Gerdinel, I think that’s all we need.\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Yeah… um… actually, before you go, do you know who’s working on 3650?\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** A bunch of pictures with compulsion effects? It’s one of the, uh, projects I was working on. We had some updates we were going to make before… before all this.\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** We haven’t really had the time or resources to reassign people to abandoned projects.\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** So, those updates aren’t getting made?\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** I’m afraid not. Anything else?\n> \n> **Gerdinel:** Um… any new letters for me?\n> \n> **Dr. Tennison:** Not yet, but we’ll tell 5re.\n> \n> **Gerindel:** Ok, thanks.\n> \n> <**End Log**>\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum SCP-3449-3:** Foundation webcrawlers report an uptick in syntactical errors in civilian media sources. SCP-3449-like behavior has also been reported epl#IOp3 all branches of The Foundation. Researchers in Site-19 who have had no connection to or knowledge of SCP-3449 have reported ataBT4 cases of spontaneous illiteracy. \n\nSCP-3449 is officially designated as goaTT43!. \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:left; width: 45%\"]]\n\n{{SCiP Net: Page revision from 06/03/2025}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3449/offset/3 Next iteration from 01/17/2026]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n~~~~",
