Team S-A486 were sent into the field in order to scout possible anomalous activity following [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Vera Typhoon Vera]. While surveying the nearby villages, Agent ██████ found the documents laying in an abandoned hotel suite. \n\nThe differing mediums and handwriting suggest multiple parties were involved. Documents were collected due to similarities with other documents pertaining to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/nobody-hub Nobody]. The other party is thought to be ██████  █████████, a reporter for Thrilling Adventures Magazine. Connections between Nobody and ██████  █████████ are currently under investigation. Due to the heavily water damaged state of some media, reconstructive computer imaging has been used to clarify language. Large parts of some texts are missing, likely due to poor weathering. Document set one is believed to be written earlier than document set two, judging from the times mentioned in texts.[[footnote]] Researchers are studying the possibility that Document Set 1 is linked with a time-based anomaly. Modern lined paper wasn't invented until 1974.[[/footnote]]\n\nBelow are copies of the original files, separated by style and time. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Document Set 1\" hide=\"- Collapse\"]]\n[[=image document7]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Document Set 2\" hide=\"- Collapse\"]]\n[[=image document1]]\n[[=image document2]]\n[[=image document3]]\n[[=image document4]]\n[[=image document5]]\n[[=image document6]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n**Image 1**\n> **Filename:** document1\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 2**\n> **Filename:** document2\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 3**\n> **Filename:** document3\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 4**\n> **Filename:** document4\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 5**\n> **Filename:** document5\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 6**\n> **Filename:** document6\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n\n**Image 7**\n> **Filename:** document7\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user PhantomClock]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3..0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/documents-recovered-in-honshu-japan-1949 The SCP Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
