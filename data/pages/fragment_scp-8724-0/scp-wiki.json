Following the initial exploration of SCP-8724, personnel are forbidden from entering the premises. RAISA is to regularly check Foundation employee records for any individual with the name ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓.\n \n-----\n \n[[=]]\n**Description**\n[[/=]]\n \n-----\n \n SCP-8724 is an abandoned building in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. The structure is composed of a single floor of residential space, with no evident anomalous characteristics from the exterior. SCP-8724's main anomalous effect is its ability to manifest a weak electrical field around the structure, which interferes with electronic devices and causes abnormalities in recording equipment.\n \nNo other anomalous phenomena are present within SCP-8724.\n \n \n-----\n \n[[=]]\n**Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n \n-----\nSCP-8724's existence was first made known to the Foundation after a routine check of SCP-▓▓▓▓ revealed a series of messages left by ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ **7** prior to the conclusion of their assignment. Despite the presence of multiple aberrations in tone and style when compared to official Foundation documentation for unclassified anomalies, the matter was deemed important enough to warrant an investigation into 12 of the ▓▓ anomalies described within the recovered information. To this end, Specialized Task Force Chicot-1 was established as a series of semi-independent agents operating simultaneously on identifying these anomalies.\n \nOn May 7th, 2024, Agent Sarah Howards, operating under said Specialized Task Force, would first report encountering SCP-8724. [[footnote]] Of note is that Agent Howards had checked in with the Foundation from Sweden hours prior to this. Tracking data is unavailable for Agent Howards on May 7th, 2024.[[/footnote]]\n \nA detachment of Foundation employees arrived within the hour and established a provisional perimeter around SCP-8724. Despite the fact that the anomaly had not been cleared yet, and the fact that human exploration is heavily discouraged as a point of first contact, Agent Howards would break through the perimeter and enter SCP-8724 with no equipment. The reasoning behind this is unknown.\n \nFollowing protocol, an unmanned drone was sent in after Agent Howards, with the goal of assessing the situation. However, Agent Howards was not located within the structure. Instead, the unmanned drone recorded a full exploration of SCP-8724. A transcript of the unmanned drone's footage is attached below.\n \n@@ @@\n-----\n \n[[=]]\n**Addendum-8724-A**\n//Exploration Records 02/06/2024.//\n[[/=]]\n \n-----\n@@ @@\n \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n \n= **Video Log - 07/05/2024**\n-----\n= **RECORDING START**\n-----\n \n@@ @@\n \n= //The drone comes online a few feet from the entrance to SCP-8724.
