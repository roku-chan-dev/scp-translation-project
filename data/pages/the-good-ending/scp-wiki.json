You seem like an alright person who was mistreated and led to believe something that isn't true. \n> \n> **SCP-5057:** But I am still toxic.\n> \n> **Cole:** You may be toxic to eat, but you are not a toxic person. If anything, I believe Researcher Rex is the real toxic person here.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I am... not toxic?\n> \n> **Cole:** No. You're you. And that's perfectly fine. You know, a real friend wouldn't make you feel toxic. A real friend cares about what you have to say and actually listens to you.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I am me... I am not knowing of what to say.\n> \n> **Cole:** You don't need to say anything. Why don't you go ahead and paint something new?
