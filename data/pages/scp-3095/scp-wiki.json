PoI-301-K, the current president of GoI-301, is to be located and assassinated.</p>\n<p><b>Containment Breach Protocols:</b> Individual SCP-3095-1 instances are rarely more of a threat than a non-anomalous bird. They can usually be dispatched with small arms fire or tear gas. Large crowds of SCP-3095-1 must be directed away from anomalies that affect birds.</p>\n<p>Civilizations made up of SCP-3095-1 are normally incapable of significant communication or collective action, and therefore their activity can be masked by standard disinformation campaigns.</p>\n<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-3095 is the designation given to a recurring phenomenon affecting members of the <i>Aves</i> class, also known as birds. Specimens affected by SCP-3095, designated SCP-3095-1, will acquire a certain degree of sapience. SCP-3095-1 have varying personalities and levels of intelligence, though many common characteristics are noted.</p>\n<p>SCP-3095 grants SCP-3095-1 instances proficiency in a certain area. These range from those as mundane as culinary, carpentry or construction skills, to talent in the areas of physics, biology, economics, linguistics, politics and other areas of academia. All SCP-3095-1 instances are fluent in a language consisting of chirps, screeches and appendage movements, though differences in dialects between species has been observed. A written form of this language exists, though not all instances of SCP-3095-1 are literate.</p>\n<p>Although lone SCP-3095-1 instances have been regularly encountered, SCP-3095-1 instances tend to form civilizations. These <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/scp-1845\">civilizations</a> are often grouped by <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/scp-2050\">species</a>. For example, an SCP-3095-1 civilization may consist of robins, with very few other specimens present. The populations of these civilizations vary wildly. It is known that a village consisting of 14 pelicans exists in a single village in Southern Africa, while the largest known civilization had a population estimated in the millions across multiple large cities.</p>\n<p>In the case of these large civilizations, they pose a threat to the Foundation (<i>see Addendum 3095-3</i>).</p>\n<p>SCP-3095 has been linked to anomalous rituals undergone by GoI-301 (\"Avianolyte\"). GoI-301 is dedicated to the worship of members of the <i>Aves</i> class. Traces of GoI-301 have been dated as far back as 1000 B.C.E. It is believed that GoI-301 and SCP-3095-1 worship a common deity (<i>see Addendum 3095-1</i>). <strike>GoI-301 currently poses a Class II threat.</strike> GoI-301 has been dissolved following the implementation of Proposal Insigna (<i>see Addendum 3095-4</i>).</p>\n<p>SCP-3095-1 were first discovered in New York City, after an organized group made up of pigeons attempted to claim the Statue of Liberty for themselves. They were quickly neutralized by <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/goc-hub-page\">Global Occult Coalition</a> forces. This phenomenon was originally classified as a subdesignation of <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/scp-659\">SCP-659</a>. It was determined that SCP-3095 existed following the development of three more civilizations in <tt>[DATA REDACTED]</tt>, as well as encounters with lone instances of SCP-3095-1. GoI-301 was originally associated with <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/scp-765\">SCP-765</a>, and it was not until 2001 that SCP-3095 was linked to GoI-301.</p>\n<p><b>Addendum 3095-1:</b> Interview Log</p>\n<div class=\"adden1\">\n<p><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"toggle('adden1');\">▼ ACCESS ADDENDUM ▼</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"adden1 collapsed\">\n<p><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"toggle('adden1');\">▲ CLOSE ADDENDUM ▲</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Interviewer:</b> Researcher C████ Calvin</p>\n<p><b>Interviewee:</b> Duffalan</p>\n<p><b>Foreword:</b> Duffalan was an SCP-3095-1 instance acting as the official ambassador of the Kingdom of the First Oak, located in ██████, Canada.

First of all, how have you gained your ability to think?</p>\n<p><b>Duffalan:</b> Its a bit hard to answer that. One day, I was runing about, mindless as a monkey. The next day, I was not mindless.

Major population center is located near a 120 year old Oak tree in northern Canada. Culture is built around a system similar to Confucian philosophies.

It is of note that, during Incident 3095-8, the Perritree displayed much higher-quality technology than what was previously observed, such as modern computers, tanks and salted bombs. A far greater population of SCP-3095-1 instances was also noted during the attack.</p>\n<p>MTF Tau-5 (\"Samsara\") was deployed to the sites of Incident 3095-8, where they joined the forces of on-site personnel in order to resist the attack. <tt>[DATA REDACTED]</tt> authorized the use of SCP-████ in order to destroy The Perritree's major population center in Colombia. A large cave system was uncovered following the blast, where The Perritree had been developing advanced technology for approximately █ years. With this technology, The Perritree had secretly become a Level VI civilization.</p>\n<p>The Perritree is known to have frequently interacted with other SCP-3095-1 civilizations.
