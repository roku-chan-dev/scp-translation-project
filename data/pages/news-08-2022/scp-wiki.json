With 7k's posting period wrapping up and some other Community Outreach initiatives taking priority, it was a bit of a challenge to get this out quickly. We hope to be more on track in the future though!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ August 18th\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ __Happy Birthday, Dr Gears!__\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/gears-day-collection-hub/wpmMbM4.jpg|caption=Dr. Gears by Shiro|width=340px|align=right]]\n\nOn April 30th, 2009, Dr Gears announced that his birthday was coming up,  all he wanted was a few spooky stories. The “contest” would begin on that day (April 30th) and end on August 10th. By the 10th there were at least 11 entries. Sorts won, but their entry has been deleted sometime in the following 13 years.\n\nThe next year… nothing happened. However, the year after that, Gears Day was officially codified as a day of celebration for the SCP Wiki. It’s celebrated on Dr. Gear’s birthday: August 18th.\n\nSo here’s how it goes for the uninitiated: every August 18th (except in 2016 and 2019, which we missed for some reason) several authors in the community get together to write small little horror vignettes. They’re all collected on a hub dedicated to the eponymous celebration. The topics of these vignettes vary greatly. I call them “horror vignettes” to sound sophisticated. But that’s really not what they are, they’re creepypasta. It’s fitting really, Gears has been around since the beginning. Back then, the SCP Universe wasn’t an Urban Fantasy combined with cosmic horror combined with science fiction combined with fantasy combined with conspiracy fiction combined with–\n\nYou get the point. It was a creepypasta. We’ll be celebrating it again for the 10th time this year!

Have fun!\n\nHappy Birthday, Dr Gears!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Zertas//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ August 9th\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ __The Winners of the 173 Art Contest have been Announced!__\n[[/=]]\n\nOn the 22nd of June, 2007, a user by the name of //S. S. Walrus// (later and more commonly known as //Moto42//) made the original SCP-173 post onto the /x/ board of 4chan. You can see an archived view of the post [https://archive.ph/QD9UF here]! This was the origin of SCP as we know it. 15 years and almost 7,000 SCP articles later with numerous tales, formats, and other kinds of pages, the SCP Foundation project is still going strong thanks to our vibrant community both on and off the site!\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWa-CRcVUAA8vjR?format=jpg&name=large|caption=173 contest winner by [https://twitter.com/Amamidori1522 Amamidori]!|width=340px|align=left]]\n\nThis year, we decided to celebrate with the [[[173-anniversary-hub | 173 Anniversary Hub]]] where a [[[173thankyouletter | staff letter]]] was written to the community, a short survey about the origin of our users was run, an [[[news-06-2022 | investigation]]] on \"Untitled 2004\" was conducted, and more relevantly an art contest was conducted with the prompt to create a rendition of SCP-173 celebrating its own birthday! Some of the entries were chosen to be part of [[[scp-173-redesign-collab-hub-subpage-8 | this gallery]]] on the [[[peanut-gallery | SCP-173 Redesign Hub]]]. The overall winner was [https://twitter.com/Amamidori1522 Amamidori] as shown here!

I believe they went better this year, and we have already begun working on some of the suggestions presented to us. The Community Outreach team intends to continue doing these each year (likely during the month of May). I hope everyone understands that we can't implement every suggestion or fully address every complaint. Some of them contradict each other and some happen to be impossible to do while on Wikidot. For the ones we could address and the ones we decided to not proceed with, we did try to explain why we did so. For those a little confused on where these suggestions and complaints took place, check out this thread [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14971911/suggestions-and-complaints-faq | here]]]. For the staff response to most of these, click on this link [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-15076841/suggestions-and-complaints-all-comments | here]]] to view that thread.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ August 1st\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ __7kcon's Posting Period has ended!__\n[[/=]]\n\nAs the title reads, the posting period for the [[[scp7000contesthub | SCP-7000 contest]]] has ended and we are well on our way to finishing out the voting period. As always the winner will receive the SCP-7000 slot and the runners-up will have their pick of the remaining slots available. As of the time of writing, we currently have 118 positively-rated articles with a turnout of over 160. We will let you know of future updates. As the first contest I personally have hosted, I hope everyone has enjoyed it! We have learned a lot and hopefully, the next one will go even smoother!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Features Last Month\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Front Page Features\n[[/=]]\n\nEvery month, an article is selected from each of the three common article types: SCP, Tale, and Group of Interest Format.
