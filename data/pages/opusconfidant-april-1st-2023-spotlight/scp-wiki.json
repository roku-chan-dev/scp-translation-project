Due to its high speed (especially when reinforced with Photo Finish) and a highly varied movepool Shutterbug has found a home in meta teams such as O7 and AAAAAAAAA. Shutterbug is also run in more experimental teams alongside SCPs like [[[scp-166| Teenature]]] or [[[scp-239|Slumberslack]]] in the Merry Picmas and Slumberslack's Nightmare teams, though those are currently considered non-viable.  From casual teams to championship rosters Shutterbug is run at all levels. No small wonder that many players claim to see this SCP everywhere.\n\n\n\n\n++ P.O.S.E.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Photo Finish]||\n||Move 2:||[# Optics]||\n||Move 3:||[# Shutter]||\n||Move 4:||[# Exposure]||\n\n||Item:||[[[scp-978|Votum Loci]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Still Frame]||\n||Persona:||Timid||\n||AVs:|| 12 HP / 244 SpA / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nP.O.S.E. is a classic move-set and game plan that has seen little change since its first use  in Series I to complete the O7 team (so named because, for a time, if you came up against this team, all you could really do was salute and surrender). The plan is simple: first you set up with the delayed [# Photo Finish], hopefully stun your opponent with [# Optics], stall them with [# Shutter] as needed, hit them with [# Exposure] to do some chip damage, at which point your [# Photo Finish] should proc. While on its own this is nothing extraordinary P.O.S.E. really shined in the O7 team setting, especially with the use of [[[scp-515-ARC|Fluttershy Lens]]]. This now banned item both upped the chance of getting a stun off on [# Optics] from 25% to 75% //and// increased move speed, making what would otherwise have been a decent moveset into an unstoppable juggernaut, especially when paired with [[[scp-076| Markable]]]'s Unchainable BERSERK moveset.\n\nWith the banning of Fluttershy Lens necessitating its replacement with the far inferior [[[scp-978|Votum Loci]]] (much worse stun chance, no damage increase) and the power creep of later series, many have dropped this style of Shutterbug in favor of more recent SCP such as [[[scp-5175|Ken-Shinigami]]] or  [[[scp-4051|Whirlpool]]].\n\nSome pros do still run Shutterbug, however, among those P.O.S.E. has somewhat fallen out of favor to be replaced by Caught in 105K. However, many low-level players tend to run cookie-cutter O7 rosters so it's good to know the strat so as to easily counter it. \n\n++ Caught in 105K\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Photo Finish]||\n||Move 2:||[# Shutter]||\n||Move 3:||[# Four Pixel Flurry]||\n||Move 4:||[# Remote Punching]||\n\n||Item:||[[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Focusing Lens]||\n||Persona:||Brave||\n||AVs:|| 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\n\nAs opposed to P.O.S.E., and most other prior Shutterbug builds, Caught in 105K focuses on attack and accuracy rather than speed and support. Pioneered by [[*user thedeadlymoose]] as part of the AAAAAAAAA line-up in Series II this saw little, but consistent, meta usage until its surprising resurgence in the 2020 Arizona Renaissance Faire Invitational. This invitational saw multiple high-level variations of the AAAAAAAAA roster including copies of [[[scp-4494|SHADOWMAN]]] and [[[scp-4051|Whirlpool]]]. It also saw some wild variation of the classic P.O.S.E. moveset such as teching in [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] signature move [# Four Pixel Flurry], something not seen on the competitive level since [[*user Dr Dan]] all the way back in 2010. \n\nWhile an attack focused Shutterbug may seem obvious now, at the time [# Four Pixel Flurry] wasn't even considered due to [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] glass canon nature (due to several much needed nerfs) causing this SCP to be dead competitively, and there just wasn't enough support for the build (niche Delta Shutterbug build aside) until the Series VII introduction of the [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]] item and [# Remote Punching] move pairing. [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]] causes Shutterbug to be much of a tanky SCP akin to [[[SCP-7053|Sheller]]] with much slower speed, which is somewhat counter-intuitive for a relatively speedy character, but shows its worth by heavily reinforcing slow to build powerhouse moves like [# Remote Punching] and [# Photo Finish] as well as potentially upping [# Four Pixel Flurry] to insta-kill range against mediocre defense stated SCPs.\n\n\n\n-----\n++ Discussion\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Voiiiii]]\n[[div]]\nAAAAAAAAA is my favorite team to run :))\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user RosySaturniidae]]\n[[div]]\nI think the pairing of [[[scp-105|Shutterbug]]] with [[[scp-166|Teenature]]] is severely underrated, especially against threats like [[[scp-173|Motonut]]] \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user nebulousstar]]\n[[div]]\nFor sure!

I'd expected to see that Photo Finish was added in a much later build, and was surprised to see it in the first version of the SCP to see competitive use. A cool  SCP with a clever ability, a reasonably interesting movepool and obviously very competitive, well-crafted.

Motonut has remained a consistent threat, with its excellent Attack and a comfortable 100 speed tier. Its primary downside comes from a limited movepool and meager 65/70/64 bulk, meaning it seldom gets a chance to switch in, and would take heavy damage even on resisted hits.\n\nAlthough Motonut can be one-dimensional in its game plan, unprepared teams can easily find themselves be torn apart, especially from repeated Masked Unseen Snap set. It also has a niche in the Apollyon tier for being one of the few SCPs capable of breaking past Resistile.\n\n+++ Nipplenut\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Unseen Snap]||\n||Move 2:||[# Full Tackle]||\n||Move 3:||[# Hammer Arm]||\n||Move 4:||[# Summon Licensing]||\n\n||Item:||[[[scp-6510|Sky Ring]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Mold Breaker]||\n||Persona:|| Jolly ||\n||AVs:||252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nMotonut outspeeds most of the metagame when equipped with a Sky Ring, allowing it to snatch KOs on key threats like [[[scp-5175|Ken-Shinigami]]]. Unseen Snap is Motonut's choice STAB move, hitting many targets for at least neutral damage. Full Tackle let it hit [[[scp-999|Jellisweet]]], while Hammer Arm gets the jump on opposing Auto-types.\n\nSummon Licensing gives Motonut the chance to deal massive damage to the opponent, potentially KOing both sides and let its teammate a free switch-in.\n\nThis set's usage scenario should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Against opponents with many defensive counterplays, Motonut should be used as an early-game wallbreaker, letting it punch holes or remove key targets from the game, or as a late-game cleaner, after opposing SCPs have been weakened enough to be unable to live a STAB Unseen Snap.\n\n\n+ Discussion\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user DrClef]]\n[[div]]\nnut\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Dr Gears]]\n[[div]]\nnut\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply2\"]]\n[[*user Moto42]]\n[[div]]\nnut\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply3\"]]\n[[*user Lt Masipag]]\n[[div]]\nnut\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n[[div]]\n[[[scp-371-j|no nut]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n+ \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[# 426]]\n[[collapsible show=\"#0426 Me\" hide=\"#0426 Me\"]]\n\n+ Me\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"mon-card\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"sprite\"]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/ethagon-toaster/Toaster1.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n\n||Index #||**426**||\n||Type:||[[span class=\"auto\"]]Auto[[/span]][[span class=\"dread\"]]Dread[[/span]]||\n||Ability:||[# ego]||\n||Tier:||[# Euclid]||\n\n[[div class=\"stat\"]]\n||HP||[[span style=\"--num: 190\"]]190[[/span]]||\n||Attack||[[span style=\"--num: 33\"]]30[[/span]]||\n||Defense||[[span style=\"--num: 58\"]]59[[/span]]||\n||Sp.

Its primary downside comes from a very limited movepool and horrendous stats outside of HP, making Me virtually unusable outside of very specific strategies.\n\nSetups with Me can range from tearing through [[[SCP-076|Markable]]] to being fodder for [[[scp-ttku-j|U-kill]]] who is completely immune to Ego.\n\n+++ One with All\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Camaraderie]||\n||Move 2:||[# Sense of Self]||\n||Move 3:||[# Toast Command]||\n||Move 4:||[# Same Joke]||\n\n||Item:||[[[scp-1979|Time-Up Treadmill]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Ego]||\n||Persona:|| Hungry ||\n||AVs:||252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nThe long wait time for Ego to come online is reduced by Time-Up Treadmill to be ready from the start, making anyone that hits Me receive their full damage from the first round instead of having to wait multiple rounds for the damage to add up. Using Camaraderie to prevent switching for the round and Sense of Self to let the enemy only receive the damage without Me having to tank it makes for a decent strategy. Putting foes under the influence of Same Joke is a good way to lock your opponent into defeat. With Me's Attack options not being the best, Toast Command remains the only viable option to make damage not coupled to being attacked.\n\nThe best use case of Me remains to beat a tough opponent with the hope of ending with a double KO. While its moveset makes it largely Type independent, it still fairs worse against other Dread types on average.\n\n\n+ Discussion\n\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Dr Gears]]\n[[div]]\nMe should really have been banned ages ago.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user DrClef]]\n[[div]]\nWell, DrClef thinks I should always be part of the Meta.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user OriTiefling]]\n[[div]]\nGetting this banned would be nice if only for the same joke accompanying it being stopped.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user LORDXVNV]]\n[[div]]\nYou mean the same joke accompanying Me\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user OriTiefling]]\n[[div]]\nSee, I can't even ban you for this, because that's literally its name.

Though it doesn't have the best defensive profile, (But then again, what Dread-type SCP does?) it has decent move coverage and good enough Sp. Attack and Speed to make it a commonly used SCP in the lower power level it finds itself in. Ideally, Asshaunter wants to get in before its opponent sets up entry hazards since it lacks the means by which to get rid of them and suffers greatly because of them. Of course, you can choose to equip yours with a healing item, but this goes against its glass cannon nature and causes you to lose significant firepower. \n\n-----\n++ Revenge Killer/Sweeper\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Spoopy]||\n||Move 2:||[# Neptune's Kiss]||\n||Move 3:||[# Haunt]||\n||Move 4:||[# Hidden Power (Cosmos)]||\n\n||Item:||[# Life Orb]||\n||Ability:||[# Stench]||\n||Persona:||Timid||\n||AVs:|| 252 SpA / 4 SpD / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\n[# Spoopy] and [# Haunt] are powerful STAB moves that are guaranteed to hit hard because of Asshaunter's strong SpA stat.

With this type combination, the SCP is hit for neutral damage on all Humor attacks, is straight-up immune to Dread, and takes half damage from Cosmos and Divine. The only real threat Asshaunter faces is that of Auto types, which are rare in Wondertainment Junior Cup, but even then, you have [# Hidden Power (Cosmos)] to defend yourself against them.\n\nAll in all, Asshaunter is a powerful SCP that fits into almost any team and is capable of sweeping or revenge killing assuming the opponent hasn't been given time to set up.\n\n-----\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user faminepulse]]\n[[div]]\nhee hee\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Salman Corbette]]\n[[div]]\nhee hee\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user a random day]]\n[[div]]\nWhy do people insist on using -J's?

Polyroid is also run in more experimental teams alongside SCPs like [[[scp-0166| Gothicemme]]] or [[[scp-6239| Mega Slumberslack]]] in the Gothic GF and Welcome to Slumberslackland teams, though those are currently considered non-viable.  From casual teams to championship rosters Polyroid is run at all levels.

The plan is simple: first you set up with the delayed [# Photo Finish], hopefully stun your opponent with [# Optics], stall them with [# Shutter] as needed, hit them with [# Exposure] to do some chip damage, at which point your [# Photo Finish] should proc. While on its own this is nothing extraordinary P.O.S.E. really shone in the O7 team setting, especially with the use of [[[scp-515-ARC|Fluttershy Lens]]]. This now banned item both upped the chance of getting a stun off on [# Optics] from 25% to 75% //and// increased move speed, making what would otherwise have been a decent moveset into an unstoppable juggernaut, especially when paired with [[[scp-073| Markaine]]]'s weedkiller moveset.\n\nWith the banning of Fluttershy Lens necessitating its replacement with the far inferior [[[scp-978|Votum Loci]]] (much worse stun chance, no damage increase) and the power creep of later series, many have dropped this style of Polyroid in favour of more recent SCP such as [[[scp-5595|Gumballbuster]]] or  [[[scp-4051|Whirlpool]]].\n\nSome pros do still run Polyroid, though  among those P.O.S.E. has somewhat fallen out of favor to be replaced by Caught in 1465K.

Pioneered by [[*user thedeadlymoose]] as part of the AAAAAAAAA line-up in Series II this saw little, but consistent, meta usage until its surprising resurgence in the 2020 Massachusetts Renaissance Faire Invitational. This invitational saw multiple high-level variations of the AAAAAAAAA roster including copies of [[[scp-5601|Caged Demonbird]]] and [[[scp-4051|Whirlpool]]]. It also saw some wild variation of the classic P.O.S.E. moveset such as teching in [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] signature move [# Five Pixel Flurry], something not seen on the competitive level since [[*user Dr Dan]] all the way back in 2010. \n\nWhile an attack focused Shutterbug may seem obvious now, at the time [# Five Pixel Flurry] wasn't even considered due to [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] glass canon nature (due to several much needed nerfs) causing this SCP to be dead competitively, and there just wasn't enough support for the build (niche Delta Polyroid build aside) until the Series VII introduction of the [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]] item and [# Remote Punching] move pairing. [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone]]] causes Polyroid to be much of a tanky SCP akin to [[[SCP-7053|Sheller]]] with much slower speed, which is somewhat counter-intuitive for a relatively speedy character, but shows its worth by heavily reinforcing slow to build powerhouse moves like [# Remote Punching] and [# Photo Finish] as well as potentially upping [# Five Pixel Flurry] to insta-kill range against mediocre defense stated SCPs.\n\n\n\n-----\n++ Discussion\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Voiiiii]]\n[[div]]\nAAAAAAAAA is my favorite team to run :))\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n[[div]]\nI think the pairing of [[[scp-1465|Polyroid]]] with [[[scp-0166|Gothicemme]]] is severely underrated, especially against threats like [[[scp-3043|Lawbringer]]] \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Fishish]]\n[[div]]\nDefinitely!

However, once its moveset and ability are taken into account, Spankoflex's true power shines through. Thanks to the power of [# Prankster], it has priority access to its vast gallery of support moves. Moreover, it also has access to Boomburst, one of the most powerful moves in the game, on which it also gets STAB. Ever since its premiere in Series III, Spankoflex has been terrorizing OpusConfidant matches with its antics and frustrating those who underestimate it. \n\nHowever, Spankoflex is not without its counters. Other Humor types nullify its [# Prankster] ability, rendering it unable to lay its tricky traps and forcing it to rely on its offensive prowess, which it is severely lacking in. \n\n-----\n\n++ Trickster Support\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Cack]||\n||Move 2:||[# Swap Blast]||\n||Move 3:||[# Swiftfoot Scramble]||\n||Move 4:||[# Boomburst]||\n\n||Item:||[[[scp-714|Jade Ring]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Prankster]||\n||Persona:||Curious||\n||AVs:|| 248 HP / 252 SpD / 8 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nThe [[[scp-714|Jade Ring]]] feels like it was absolutely made with SCPs like Spankoflex in mind, as it allows it to transfer the Sleep status effect effectively and without issue.

If your opponent swapped in an SCP that would be crippled by your newly held Item pilfered through [# Swap Blast], you can gift it to them. And if for some reason your opponent is a Sleeptalker (who does that in Keter nowadays anyway?), you can easily inflict chip damage and Confuse them with [# Cack]. If you are faced with a Humor-type opponent or are otherwise unable to cause chaos, you will be forced to use Boomburst.

Though [# Cack] and [# Cack Hard] are decent moves on their own, the star of the show here is [# Boomburst], which you should ideally be spamming if you intend on using Spankoflex as a wallbreaker. If you're ever in a situation where [# Boomburst] cannot help you (or you've run out of PP), the most you can do is fall back on [# Cack] and hope your opponent deals damage to themselves in confusion while you swap out to another SCP and wonder why didn't go with its Trickster Support build instead.\n\n-----\n++ Discussion\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user daveyoufool]]\n[[div]]\nI really never expected Spankoflex to come so far.

However, many low-level players tend to run cookie-cutter Lethe rosters so it's good to know the strat so as to easily counter it. \n\n++ Caught in 3002K\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Photo Finish]||\n||Move 2:||[# Shutter]||\n||Move 3:||[# Threeve Pixel Flurry]||\n||Move 4:||[# Remote Punching]||\n\n||Item:||[[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Bodies in the Water]||\n||Persona:||Brave||\n||AVs:|| 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\n\nAs opposed to P.O.S.E., and most other prior Rolypolaroid builds, Caught in 3002K focuses on attack and accuracy rather than speed and support. Pioneered by [[*user thedeadlymoose]] as part of the AAAAAAAAA line-up in Series II this saw little, but consistent, meta usage until its surprising resurgence in the 2020 Southern Indiana Renaissance Faire Invitational. This invitational saw multiple high-level variations of the AAAAAAAAA roster including copies of [[[scp-2408|Dark Hunter]]] and [[[scp-4051|Whirlpool]]]. It also saw some wild variation of the classic P.O.S.E. moveset such as teching in [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] signature move [# Threeve Pixel Flurry], something not seen on the competitive level since [[*user Dr Dan]] all the way back in 2010. \n\nWhile an attack focused Rolypolaroid may seem obvious now, at the time [# Threeve Pixel Flurry] wasn't even considered due to [[[scp-096|Shyssasin's]]] glass canon nature (due to several much needed nerfs) causing this SCP to be dead competitively, and there just wasn't enough support for the build (niche Delta Rolypolaroid build aside) until the Series VII introduction of the [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]] item and [# Remote Punching] move pairing. [[[SCP-6980 | Satellite CameraPhone ]]] causes Rolypolaroid to be much of a tanky SCP akin to [[[SCP-7053|Sheller]]] with much slower speed, which is somewhat counter-intuitive for a relatively speedy character, but shows its worth by heavily reinforcing slow to build powerhouse moves like [# Remote Punching] and [# Photo Finish] as well as potentially upping [# Threeve Pixel Flurry] to insta-kill range against mediocre defense stated SCPs.\n\n\n\n-----\n++ Discussion\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Voiiiii]]\n[[div]]\nAAAAAAAAA is my favorite team to run :))\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user DolphinSlugchugger]]\n[[div]]\nI think the pairing of [[[scp-3002|Rolypolaroid]]] with [[[scp-4166|Demager]]] is severely underrated, especially against threats like [[[scp-055|Orbhorse]]] \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Decibelles]]\n[[div]]\n100% Especially since its Divine typing gives Demager [[[scp-475|Soapopo]]] synergy.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user kothardarastrix]]\n[[div]]\nIn what world do you run Rolypolaroid?!

One of the few things that can actually prove a roadblock to Dragonslayer is a Defense-invested [[[scp-682|Resistile]]], but then again, what can't that fat lizard wall? One SCP to look out for is [[[scp-179|Estrellite]]], as its access to [# Solar Flare] can melt through Dragonslayer's pure Auto typing, and its Cosmos typing makes it difficult to take out.\n\n\n------\n\n++ Large-Scale Aggressor Overrun\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Beowulf-Sigurd Rail]||\n||Move 2:||[# Cold Iron Sword]||\n||Move 3:||[# Thousand Word Arrows]||\n||Move 4:||[# Dragon Dance]||\n\n||Item:||[[[scp-037|Dwarf Star]]]||\n||Ability:||[# Clear Body]||\n||Persona:||Naughty||\n||AVs:|| 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nNow, you might be wondering, \"Where is Dragonslayer's signature move?

Bolstering a massive special attack and not-shabby speed, Solamotha could wipe several premiere threats from the field in the blink of an eye. However it's limited movepool, lack of coverage options and frail defenses combined with a defensively weak typing relegates Solamotha to serving as a glass-cannon in most teams its included in.\n\n\n\n\n++ Hey, Hollow Knight Reference!\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Blinding Light]||\n||Move 2:||[# Leaf Munch]||\n||Move 3:||[# Quiver Dance]||\n||Move 4:||[# Fiery Air]||\n\n||Item:||[# Cocoon Casings]||\n||Ability:||[# Radiant Light]||\n||Persona:||Modest||\n||AVs:|| 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe||\n[[/div]]\n\nHHKR was one of the first sets conceived for Solamotha and, lucky for the big moth, it has stuck since! Focusing on doling out damage above all else, this set can OHKO anything that doesn't resist Solamotha's STABs. Setting up a [# Quiver Dance] on top of Solamotha's already ginormous stats makes it nearly unstoppable. But that's exactly the issue; getting up a Quiver Dance in the first place. The [# Solar] type means Solamotha takes super effective damage to entry hazards and it's weak defenses means it can't come in whenever it wants. You need to guarantee a safe switch for Solamotha for it to be able to do its work.\n\nThe [# Cocoon Casings] allows Solamotha to take one super effective hit without immediately fainting, letting it possibly knock out one more opponent. If survivability isn't your gig, a [# Fire Gem] allows you to pack in ginormous damage to the first [# Fiery Air] you launch. Nothing, not even resists, can survive that.\n\n\n++ Humid Weather\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote large\"]]\n||Move 1:||[# Caterpillar Dreams]||\n||Move 2:||[# Solar Beam]||\n||Move 3:||[# Cognition Shift]||\n||Move 4:||[# Blinding Light]||\n\n||Item:||[# Cocoon Casings]||\n||Ability:||[# Drought]||\n||Persona:||Bold||\n||AVs:|| 196 HP / 60 Def / 252 SpA ||\n[[/div]]\n\nHumid Weather is a far more defensive approach to running Solamotha. Though its frailness still necessitates the use of [# Cocoon Casings], this set allows Solamotha to take more hits on the field. [# Caterpillar Dreams] serves as invaluable recovery for the moth, restoring 25% of its max health and setting a [# Cognito Field] on the battleground, eliminating the threat of priority moves for its entire team.\n\n[# Cognito-Shift] is one of few coverage moves Solamotha has and it takes full advantage of it in this set. A Cognito Field boosted Cognition Shift does hefty damage to opponents that resist Solamotha's STABs.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** opconf-b.png\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/opusconfidant/opconf.png\n\n=====\n> **Filename:** profever.png\n> **Name:** profever.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/estrellayoshte/profever.png\n\n=====\n> **Filename:** type.png\n> **Name:** type.png\n> **Author:** Fantem\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/estrellayoshte/type.png\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** battle.png\n> **Name:** battle.png\n> **Author:** Syuzhet\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/estrellayoshte/battle.png\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** wretched-luncheon-small-v2.png\n> **Author:** [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 2014-07-18 22.41.47-new.jpg\n> **Name:** Polaroid OneStep Express.jpg\n> **Author:** Retro00064\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polaroid_OneStep_Express.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Toaster1.jpg ‎\n> **Name:** Toaster1.jpg\n> **Author:** Peng \n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Toaster1.jpg\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** thebuttghost-new.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Elenee FishTruck]], Paul Robinson, Jorge Royan\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-789-j SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative of:** \n> ----\n> **Name:** Toilet 370x580.jpg\n> **Author:** Paul Robinson\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Toilet_370x580.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> ----\n> **Name:** India - Delhi old man - 5089.jpg\n> **Author:** Jorge Royan / http://www.royan.com.ar\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:India_-_Delhi_old_man_-_5089.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 105cameraflipped.jpg\n> **Name:** 105cameraflipped\n> **Author:** Cassandra_Prime\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A\n> **Derivative of:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-105/2014-07-18%2022.41.47-new.jpg \n\n=====\n> **Filename:** corncrake2.jpg\n> **Name:** Corncrake by Loch Mòr Bharabhais, Isle of Lewis\n> **Author:** Claire Pegrum\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5525888|Link]]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** 105CameraRainbow.jpg\n> **Name:** 105CameraRainbow\n> **Author:** Cassandra_Prime\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A\n> **Derivative of:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-105/2014-07-18%2022.41.47-new.jpg \n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-bold-s-mega-cool-author-page/i%20hate%20fabsol.jpg\n> **Name:** i hate fabsol\n> **Author:** Calibold\n> **License:** CC-by-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-bold-s-mega-cool-author-page/i%20hate%20fabsol.jpg\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** dragonslayer2.png\n> **Author:** [[*user syuzhet]]\n> **License:**  CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-13816591/scp-5514#post-4795893 SCP Wiki]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
