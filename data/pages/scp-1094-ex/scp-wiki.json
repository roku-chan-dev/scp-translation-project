SCP-1094-EX has a radius of 8,642 km and a mass of  22.3 M,,⊕,,[[footnote]] 22.3 masses of Earth [[/footnote]].\n\nThe majority of SCP-1094-EX's surface is composed of white fine-grained granite and several mountainous regions, suggesting previous volcanic activity and erosion. SCP-1094-EX has an appearance similar to that of a human eyeball due to a large impact crater on its surface, presumably caused by collision with another exoplanet in its solar system. The dark central circle of the impact area is composed primarily of ash, graphite and other debris, while the surrounding yellow ring is composed of sulfur and iron oxide. The composition of SCP-1094-EX below its crust is currently unknown.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=EyePlanetLoL-2.png|caption=First photograph of SCP-1094-EX (circa 1999).

As there was no other information on it at the time of discovery, SCP-1094-EX was given a placeholder designation as an anomalous object[[footnote]] Due to it having a similar appearance to that of a human eyeball [[/footnote]] until further analysis of the object could be done.\n\n**Addendum 2:** On 01/04/2002, Foundation probe FT-2935 was launched from Area-███ on a set course for SCP-1094-EX. --FT-2935 is estimated to intersect with SCP-1094-EX in approximately ███ years-- See Addendum 3 for more details.\n\n**Addendum 3:** On 12/10/2███, FT-2935 landed on SCP-1094-EX, having split into two different compartments (FT-2935-A and FT-2935-B) before landing. FT-2935-A was set to land on a portion of SCP-1094-EX's bare surface, while FT-2935-B was set to land on SCP-1094-EX's yellow ring. After conducting several tests on its surface, F-2935 deemed SCP-1094-EX non-anomalous. \n\nDuring analysis of SCP-1094-EX's surface materials, FT-2935-B detected large amounts of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/last-moments deceased, extraterrestrial organic matter]. FT-2935-A did not detect anything of similar value.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** EyePlanetLoL.jpg\n> **Name:** EyePlanetLoL\n> **Author:** [[*user MrBazzle]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-1094-ex/EyePlanetLoL.jpg SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** EyePlanetLoL-2.png\n> **Name:** EyePlanetLoL-2\n> **Author:** [[*user MrBazzle]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-1094-ex/EyePlanetLoL-2.png SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
