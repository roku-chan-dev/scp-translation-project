SCP-5208-Ω was a member of a secret esoteric suborder of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, known as the Knights of the Seventh Day (GOI-5208SD), a group tasked with using anomalous means to covertly promote the church's beliefs. SCP-5208-Ω's efforts to eliminate humanity's \"sinful vices\" emphasized sexual behavior, specifically masturbation. These efforts lead to the creation of SCP-5208-1, SCP-5208-2, and SCP-5208-3.\n[[<]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=staff|\n    caption=SCP-5208-1.|\n    width=100px|\n    align=right\n]]\n[[/<]]\nSCP-5208-1 is a 1.5-meter wooden staff featuring a crucifix, used as a conduit for thaumaturgic rituals designed by SCP-5208-Ω. Testing revealed that SCP-5208-1, in combination with specific verbal incantations, amplifies its user's thaumaturgic abilities. Analysis revealed SCP-5208-1 to be composed of Mauritian ebony (//Diospyros tessellaria//) treated with a mixture of ammonia and human blood later confirmed to belong to SCP-5208-Ω. SCP-5208-1 was used by SCP-5208-Ω during the creation of the SCP-5208-2 instances.\n\nSCP-5208-2 are a species of non-corporeal humanoid Null-Class Demonic Entities[[footnote]] According to the Glymen Demonology Index, Null-Class Demonic entities are low-tier extra-spatial entities with various anomalous capabilities. Common abilities include telekinesis and cognitive influence. Most notably, these entities are usually given further abilities and augmentations through their commanding Marquis-Class or Princeps-Class Demonic Entities. Due to to the lack of ability to possesses hosts, Dux-Class Entities are typically non-corporeal.[[/footnote]] capable of parasitic propagation through human hosts. Instances of SCP-5208-2 display only rudimentary instinctual behavior, such as survival and procreation. Human individuals within a 3-meter radius of SCP-5208-2 will begin showing signs of increased libido; this effect increases as the distance decreases. Within 1 meter the effect of SCP-5208-2 begins showing one or more of the following symptoms:\n* Hyperarousal\n* Vascular engorgement of the genitals \n* Erection of the penis or mammary papilla\n* Spontaneous ejaculation \n* Uncontrollable masturbation [[footnote]] Including masturbation with external objects.[[/footnote]]\n* Heterosexual and homosexual intercourse[[footnote]]This can occur regardless of sexual orientation.[[/footnote]]\n* Voraphilic and necrophillic behavior\n\nOf these symptoms, uncontrollable masturbation is the most common, with more diverse symptoms manifesting with an increased presence of SCP-5208-2 instances. Prolonged exposure of a non-anomalous human to SCP-5208-2 instances causes a new SCP-5208-2 instance to manifest within the exposed person. After vomiting these new instances, the human hosts have an approximately 22% chance of developing long-term chronic exposure symptoms. SCP-5208-2 show an aversion to human subjects who have consumed a full serving of Kellogg's Corn Flakes with a 24-hour period before exposure. This aversion can be overcome when multiple SCP-5208-2 instances are present.\n\nSCP-5208-Ω used SCP-5208-1 and at least 50 SCP-5208-2 instances to enact a combinatorial process that manifested a new entity. This new entity, designated SCP-5208-3, is a Princeps-Class Demonic Entity[[footnote]] According to the Glymen Demonology Index, Princeps-Class Demonic entities are high-tier extra-spatial entities with various anomalous capabilities. Notably common abilities include telekinesis, divination, compulsion, perception manipulation, and realty bending. Princeps-Class entities are typically in control of large groups of Marquis-Class and Dux-Class Demonic Entities.[[/footnote]] claiming the name Asmodeus. Measuring approximately 4 meters tall, SCP-5208-3 has a vaguely humanoid body consisting of a black viscous liquid of unidentifiable composition. SCP-5208-3 has been observed to be capable of speech, teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and the creation of new SCP-5208-2 instances[[footnote]]SCP-5208-2 instances created in this way will spontaneously erupt from within a nearby human, killing them in the process.[[/footnote]].\n>\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=will|\n    caption=Will Keith Kellogg.|\n    width=100px\n    align=left\n]]\n++++ __**Discovery**__\n@@ @@\nSCP-5208 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on 1927/2/23, by SCP-5208-Ω's biological brother and business partner, Will Keith Kellogg (1860 – 1951).

Squad 1 is tasked with the containment/eradication of anomalies and apprehending SCP-5208-Ω; Squad 2 is to extract surviving members of ITF Bravo-3. The following is an audio transcription of the event.\n-----\n**__Squad 1__**\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Z1/1:** Entering the eastern wing now. \n\n**z1/2:** Copy that, entering Southwest wing– switching channels.\n\n//[A cacophony of screams and moans can be heard as Squad 1 enters the sanitarium]//\n\n**Z1/1:** Alright folks, we have an unknown amount of hostile entities and about 300 civilians. Call out your targets– we don't want any unnecessary casualties. \n\n//[Squad 1 can be heard giving various affirmations.]//\n\n**Z1/3:** //[Sound of a wooden door scraping open]// This way, Wing K should be at the end of this corridor. \n\n**Z1/1:** Three and Six, you take the lead. Four and Five, cover the rear.\n\n**Z1/3:** Look alive, we have company.\n\n**Z1/6:** This broad isn't wearing any clothes.\n\n**Z1/1:** Leave her, concealment will take care of the civilians once we've cleared the area.\n\n**Civilian:** You want a lick, daddy?\n\n**Z1/3:** Hey hands off lady, the fuck is wrong with you.\n\n**Z1/1:** Just keep it moving.\n\n//[Civilian can be heard screaming incoherently.]//\n\n**Z1/2:** Made contact with hostiles. Thaumic rounds work swell, just don't stand too close when you shoot them– might get a little heated.\n\n**Z1/1:** Copy that. Good to know, Two. \n\n**Z1/5:** Hostile incoming, six o'clock. \n\n//[Gunshots can be heard followed by the roar of a flame.]//\n\n**Z1/6:** Well ain't that the bee's knees. This is going to be a cakewalk. \n\n**Z1/1:** Let's not start counting our chickens just yet. How much further Three?\n\n**Z1/3:** That door right up there should be Wing K.\n\n------\n\n**__Squad 2__:**\n\n**Z1/2:** Keep an eye out, we should be getting close.\n\n**Z1/7:** One more broad asks to touch my johnson and I'll be half inclined to let 'em. \n\n**Z1/10:** About the only way you'll see any action at all. \n\n//[Laughter.]//\n\n**Z1/8:** Woah, hold it guys– we're here. See, \"Female Staff Dormitories.\" Fettle should be through here.\n\n**Z1/2:** Nine, Ten you stay here and guard the door. Everyone else on me. \n\n//[Moaning and the sound of bed frames squeezing can be heard.]//\n\n**Z1/8:** We got 3 civilia– Christ. We got 2 civilians 3 hostiles, and a– corpse.\n\n//[Sound of a door breaking down followed by 3 gunshots.]//\n\n**Z1/7:** We don't have time for gawking Eight. \n\n**Z1/2:** Let's keep moving, put 'em down as you see 'em.\n\n**Z1/8:** Look, there's a field code on this door.\n\n**Z1/2:** //[Sound of a door creaking open.]// Agent Fettle, are you in here?\n\n**Fettle:** What're the safe words?\n\n**Z1/2:** Orange, Centipede, West.\n\n //[Sound of a door unlocking and quickly swinging open.]//\n\n**Fettle:** Well it's about time. Wait– this isn't the whole response team, is it?\n\n**Z1/2:** No– we're Squad 2, Squad 1 is handling Wing K.\n\n**Fettle:** Wing K? Please tell me there's more than 3 of them.\n\n**Z1/7:** 5-man squad, just like us.\n\n**Fettle:** That's not enough– they've got to get out of there!\n\n**Z1/7:** Don't worry sweetheart, they're well trained. Besides, these shadow entities are a cakewalk.\n\n**Fettle:**  They're not the only thing here, you have to warn them!\n\n**Z1/2:** Squad 1, do you copy? Squad 1, come in. Captain? Shit. \n\n**Fettle:** It's already too late, isn't it?\n\n**Z1/2:** We need to stay on task, Squad 1 has their mission and we have ours. Do you have any idea where the rest of your team is, Agent Fettle?\n\n**Fettle:** Thompson's out. Dead. Vanholt and Easton's last known location was... Wing K.\n\n**Z1/2:** Eight, give Agent Fettle your sidearm and some ammunition. Let's pay Squad 1 a visit. \n------\n**__Squad 1__**\n\n**Z1/2:** Squad 1, //[Static]// copy? //[Static]//6, come in. Captain?\n\n**Z1/1:** There's interference, Two. Can you repeat?\n\n**Z1/3:** Cap, come look.\n\n**Z1/4:** Looks like some sort of containment room, it's got to be.\n\n//[An airlock release can be heard as Squad 1 enters the room.]//\n\n**Z1/6:** Hands up! Turn around slowly.\n\n**Vanholt:** Gosh am I glad to see you, boys.\n\n**Z1/1:** Guns down– he's one of ours. Captain, it's swell to see you've made it.\n\n**Vanholt:** As I'm sure you've seen, this place has gone to hell in a handbag.\n\n**Z1/1:** Where is the rest of your team?\n\n**Vanholt:** A few of the orderlies... Th–they ate Easton. I... I don't know what happened to Fettle or Thompson.\n\n**Z1/1:** Okay. We should keep moving.\n\n**Vanholt:** Wait Captain, how much of the situation are you aware of?\n\n**Z1/1:** We've seen hostile entities, taken them out. Thaumic rounds work wonders. \n\n**Vanholt:** Have you seen it? The big one?\n\n**Z1/1:** We have not. We are to capture the main anomaly and Dr. Kellogg.\n\n**Vanholt:** So before Kellogg created those things, he had a plan. As far as I can tell from his notes, this room was meant to contain the entity.\n\n**Z1/1:** If you're saying Kellogg meant to capture the entity, why hasn't he?\n\n**Vanholt:** He doesn't have the presence of mind left to tie his shoelaces, let alone fight that thing. It's been parading him around on a leash.\n\n**Z1/1:** Last known location? \n\n**Vanholt:** The chapel, it's just down the hall.\n\n**Z1/1:** Okay– tell us everything you know about this room and the entity. \n-----\n**__Squad 2__**\n\n**Fettle:** Okay, this is it– Wing K.\n\n**Z1/2:** Right, look alive. \n\n//[Shouting can be heard from down the corridor, followed by gunshots.]//\n\n**Z1/7:** Looks like Squad 1 has already engaged the entity.\n\n**Z1/2:** Nine and Ten, scrawl out an 8 Trigram Seal on this door. I don't want anything in or out.\n\n**Z1/9:** You got it, boss.\n\n**Z1/2:** Seven and Eight, rendezvous with Squad 1. Agent Fettle, you're with me, let's see if we can find your team.\n\n**SCP-5208-3:** You dare disturb Asmodeus! \n\n//[A loud crashing noise followed by shouting can be heard.]//\n\n**Z1/8:** Holy fuck, what is that?\n-----\n**__Squad 1 & Squad 2__**\n\n//[The sound of running can be heard.]//\n\n**Z1/3:** Captain look, it's Squad 2.\n\n**Z1/1:** Well aren't you a sight for sore eyes. \n\n**Z1/2:** The doors sealed behind us. What's the plan?\n\n**Z1/1:** We need to get it inside this room.\n\n**Z1/2:** How do you– //[Z1/2 is interrupted by a loud crunching noise, followed by a thud as his body hits the ground.]//\n\n**SCP-5208-3:** I found you. //[Inhuman laughter]//\n\n**Z1/4:** //[Screaming]// It’s in my head– I can't– I– //[Unknown]//.\n\n//[Indistinguishable shouting can be heard. The laughter continues followed by several wet popping sounds.]//\n\n**Z1/1:** Everyone in this room, now!\n\n**SCP-5208-3:** You can't hide from me! I am inside your heads, inside your hearts, inside your coc–\n\n**Z1/1:** Flip the fucking switch Vanholt!

Of the 286 civilians within the sanitarium, 192 survived with 161 listed as injured casualties. Amongst the survivors both SCP-5208-Ω and Mr. Kellogg survived, with SCP-5208-Ω sustaining irreparable brain damage during the event. MSF Zulu-1 was able to recover Captain Vanholt, Agent Fettle, SCP-5208-1, and several documents relating to GOI-5208SD[[footnote]]These documents are available to personnel with Level/5 Clearance at Site-51's Archive. [[/footnote]]. All survivors and civilian witnesses were amnestisized and Cover Story-BK79 (Faulty Gas Valve) was enacted.\n\nDue to SCP-5208-Ω's brain damage and in accordance with the Foundation agreement with Mr. Kellogg, SCP-5208-Ω was administered YM-Grade amnestics and released into the custody of Mr. Kellogg. All public information pertaining to SCP-5208-Ω's involvement with GOI-5208SD was destroyed or confiscated. In return, Mr. Kellogg transferred a 10% holding of The Kellogg Company to the Foundation.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5207]]] | SCP-5208 | [[[SCP-5209]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
