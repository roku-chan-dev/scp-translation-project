Fuck this thing.\n\nBrandi, just shake the fucking snowglobe.\n\nLook, if anybody's watching, please call this number. SAVE US!\n\n-----\n\n59.\n\nThe clattering never stops. Oh look, the hand just flipped me the bird.\n\nThis fucking shelf piece of shit! Look how flimsy it is! See how easily my foot goes through it! Put an old lady on there and she'd die.\n\nShut up Brandi. Look, either you shake that snowglobe or we're just gonna be fucking standing in this empty room forever. I don't care. Shut up.

You may be wondering what I'm doing with this woman tied up. Well, you see, I'm trapped in some kind of infomercial purgatory and I've decided that perhaps ritual sacrifice is the way to g- Stay on the ground. As you can see, I've disassembled the Shelf-and-a-half into its components and will now push this rather large nail right in between Brandi's eyes. Hold still, Brandi!\n\nMmmmm, don't you just love that sound folks! Sadly, it doesn't seem to have worked. I'm going to kill myself now!\n\n-----\n\n111.\n\nYour turn.\n\n-----\n\n112.\n\nMy turn.\n\n-----\n\n113.\n\nYour turn.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
