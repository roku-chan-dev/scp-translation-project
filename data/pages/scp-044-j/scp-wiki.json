[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44|Site-44]]] has been assigned with primary research into the phenomenon.\n\n**Description:** SCP-044-J is a reoccurring phenomenon wherein anomalous entities become spontaneously compelled to speak using an upper-class English accent and unnecessarily sophisticated vocabulary. Occurrences take place at seemingly random intervals, typically lasting around 10-20 seconds before demanifesting. SCP-044-J’s effect often creates mild confusion to those affected due to the unprompted nature of its appearance and sudden subsequent disappearance.\n\n**Addendum 044-J-1:** Notable Occurrences (Order of manifestation)\n\n> **[[[SCP-049]]]:** “Fear not, my chum.
