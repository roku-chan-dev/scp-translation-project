Following the events of Addendum 5622-5, the computer storing SCP-5622 is to be contained within an inanimate object containment unit. If any non-human entity is observed within 5583 Custobidus Street //or// SCP-5622-A’s previous prison cell, SCP-5622's containment procedures, and description are to be revised to note the aforementioned entity. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5622 is a digital folder labeled \"Your Indoor Neighbor\", stored within a Dell XPS 13 laptop. SCP-5622 contains a series of Word documents referred to as SCP-5622-1, which are written in a standard letter format. The apparent narrator of SCP-5622-1 resides within 5583 Custobidus Street, Syracuse, NY. Although no physical proof of the aforementioned narrator exists, research staff are reminded that the events within Addendum 5622-1, 3, 4, and 5 would imply otherwise.\n\nSCP-5622-A is a non-anomalous human female by the name “Analiese Gilowski” and is the previous owner of 5583 Custobidus Street, and the computer in which SCP-5622 exists.\n\n**Recovery Log:** SCP-5622-A contacted their local police station, complaining of a stalker within their place of residence. The call was deemed a false police report and SCP-5622-A was charged with a misdemeanor. Two weeks proceeding this event, SCP-5622-A contacted the police again. A human femur was found within 5583 Custobidus Street and SCP-5622-A was arrested and interrogated. Being found guilty of first-degree murder, they were sent to Groveland Correctional Facility and remained incarcerated until the events of Addendum 5622-5. The nature of the breach drew the Foundation's attention, and SCP-5622 was discovered after a thorough investigation.\n\n**Addendum 5622-1:** \nThe following entries are the remaining SCP-5622-1 files. The context within the files indicates that there were additional manifestations, although they were likely deleted by either SCP-5622-A or SCP-5622 itself. Succeeding SCP-5622-A‘s initial contact to their police station, they downloaded a webcam software that takes photographs while the laptop is unlocked.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Entry 5622-1\" hide=\"Hide Entry 5622-1\"]]\n\n> Dear Anny,\n> I was scared you had patched up the hole behind the fridge. Sometimes I just lay there until my teeth start chattering. I try not to let you hear, but I think you do anyway. You left some old fruit out in a bin yesterday. I didn't think you'd miss it, so I spread my fingers in it. It was fun, just mashing my fingers in the old fruit, but then it started smelling really bad and I stopped.\n> \n> Oh! I almost forgot! Today I found a mouse in one of your traps. He was still alive, so I got a chance to play with him before he started stinking. I left it on your cupboard so you could play with it too when you have the time. I wish you had the time to play as you used to when you were scared. Remember those times where you would spend hours looking for me around the house? Why don't we do that anymore?\n> \n> Wishing we could play,\n> Your Indoor Neighbor\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Entry 5622-2\" hide=\"Hide Entry 5622-2\"]]\n\n> Dear Anny,\n> You do odd things sometimes. Like how you sleep under your covers now. Like how you have stopped reading my little letters. It's actually kind of rude, but I don't mind. It's like our little secret, except it's just mine I suppose. That's kind of the same with a lot of things. That dead mouse was meant for you, but eventually, it got dirty and I couldn't resist. That one //will// be our little secret.\n> \n> Speaking of little secrets, I just can't keep this from you any longer. Oooh! This is so fun! Do you remember when you had that one guy over? Terrible manners, but you do have an odd choice in guests. When I saw him come in I was scared. What was I going to do? What if he found me? I was scared. I was going to hurt him, but any friend of yours is a friend of mine. I watched him talk to you. It got really quiet, and then you shook your head, and he was screaming, and you were crying. And then he left, and you threw a little box he gave you on the ground. Then, I knew he wasn't your friend. \n> \n> The weirdest thing was, he didn't really even struggle once he was under the porch! He squirmed, of course, but he was crying more than anything. Well, once you went up to the bed, I snuck him inside, and then I squeezed him into the vent. Do you know how you save things for eating sometimes, and you put them in the fridge? Well, I had no fridge, so I made do with what I had. The smell did get bad, but I think it added a nice aura to the place that you were somewhat missing before.\n> \n> I hope you like the smell too,\n> Your Indoor Neighbor\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Entry 5622-3\" hide=\"Hide Entry 5622-3\"]]\n\n> Dear Anny,\n> I was trying to balance a tooth on my finger, but then I heard a strange noise. I took the long way down to the main floor. Good thing too, because I could see you tearing apart the vent with an ax. I thought you needed it. You do strange things sometimes. You seemed upset when you finally got through, which seems a bit weird, as you seemed so intent on getting into it anyway. Some strange men came inside and took you away. I was scared you were never coming back. I was scared I would go back to how I was without you. I was almost about to finish the last of the bones when I remembered that you will be back. You'll come back.\n> \n> I just noticed this flashing light on the laptop. I'm going to try covering it up with my hand. I can still see the red through my fingers. Is the red light why you've been so upset?\n> \n> I'm here whenever you need me,\n> Your Indoor Neighbor\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 5622-2:** SCP-5622-A has been incarcerated for being guilty of first-degree murder. Their testimony to convince the jury otherwise was deemed false; the information is insufficient to either prove or disprove the existence of the \"Indoor Neighbor\".\n\n**Addendum 5622-3:** The following document was found stored on the prison's Head Officer's work computer. They dismissed it as a prank.\n\n> Dear guardian,\n> I remember those grocery bags Anny used to bring in. When it rained, sometimes the bags would break and everything would spill out and make a mess. I am that bag. You don't understand, I //need// her. I'll go back to how I was before her, a monster, no, a murderer. If you don't give her back, I will make your home mine. I will find her. You can't hide her. She's scared of you. I can smell it from here.\n> \n> From,\n> Your Indoor Neighbor\n\n**Addendum 5622-4:** SCP-5622-A made several complaints of a putrid smell emanating from their cell’s ventilation system.  Subsequent investigation revealed a human femur with some residual soft tissue at the base of the shaft feeding SCP-5622-A’s cell. Genetic testing of the femur is ongoing.\n\n**Addendum 5622-5:** SCP-5622-A breached security and has not been located. Security cameras within SCP-5622-A's hallway were cut two days prior to the event and were being replaced the next day. No traces of SCP-5622-A's escape exist, save for two screws missing from their ventilation grate, and the following audio file, captured from a neighboring cell.\n\n> \n> **Begin Log:**\n> \n> **Unidentified Voice:** Hello Anny.\n> \n> [A metalic impact is heard]\n> \n> **SCP-5622-A:** Who- what the hell?\n> \n> **Unidentified Voice:** I have waited so long to finally meet you in person.\n> \n> **SCP-5622-A:** What the hell? Help please!\n> \n> **Unidentified Voice:** I hope that we can still stay friends after I let you be kidnapped and all, but you did keep me waiting for a long time. Now we have all the time we need!\n> \n> **SCP-5622-A:** No, no, please. Leave me alone.\n> \n> **Unidentified Voice:** You have no idea how much I've wanted a friend like you.\n> \n> **SCP-5622-A:** Help me!\n> \n> [A similar metallic impact is heard, proceeding several receding thuds]\n> \n> **End Log**\n> \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Recovered webcam image has been appended to this file.
