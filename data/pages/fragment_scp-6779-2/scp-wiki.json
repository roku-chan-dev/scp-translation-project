Please see \"cctv-s950-3617378824.mpeg\" for more information.\n[[/=]]\n**Item #:** SCP-6779\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6779's current location is unknown. \n\nOnce SCP-6779 has been tracked and detained, it is to be contained in a Small Memetic-Humanoid Class Containment Chamber. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6779 is a small multicolored sock monkey, approximately 0.3 meters in height. SCP-6779 is fully animate and appears to display a moderate form of sentience. Additionally, SCP-6779 possesses a Midlevel Cognition Alteration Effect, compelling all that perceive it to treat it as if it were a very small and cute animal. Affected subjects will pay very close attention to SCP-6779 and every action it performs, fawning over anything the subject considers \"cute.\" The judgemental abilities of said subjects are drastically lower in the context of SCP-6779, making them perform actions they would not normally do in an attempt to please SCP-6779.\n\n**Incident Nocturnal:** On September 20th, 2011, SCP-6779 was discovered near the entrance to Site-950. It is to be noted that since Site-950 specializes in physical and \"straightforward\" anomalies and threats, almost none of the staff present had sufficient cognitohazardous inoculation to resist SCP-6779's effect. As such, multiple staff members had noticed SCP-6779 outside the door to the Site and subsequently succumbed to said effect. Witnesses claim that SCP-6779 was \"just a sad little thing that looked so terribly cold.\" [[footnote]]It should be noted that it was 31Â°C outside at the time. [[/footnote]] SCP-6779 was brought into the site and given a small quilted blanket and a cup of hot chocolate, which the entity proceeded to pour on its head.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6779/monkeydoafunny.JPG|caption=A picture of SCP-6779. The photographer noted the following: \"Look at how //sly// he is. Dastardly little devil, he is.\"|]]\n\nSeveral minutes after this took place, multiple witnesses who were not currently affected by SCP-6779 heard a loud crash within the Microbial Research and Related Developments Lab on the second floor. Upon entering, it was discovered that the window had been broken, the cause being a brick that was on the floor near the window. Nothing else of importance could be discovered before the investigating researchers got affected by SCP-6779, who was being carried by a large crowd of people that had traveled to the second floor in order to \"show everybody how gosh darn adorable this little dude is.\"\n\nSite-950's fascination with SCP-6779 lasted for several hours before Co-Director Helen Gilroy, one of few people stationed at the site with sufficient cognitohazardous inoculation, returned to the site from a small trip. Upon noticing the situation, she notified Mobile Task Force 761-L.A.D.F (\"Sheep Wranglers\") to capture SCP-6779 and subdue the affected site personnel. However, when the task force arrived at the site, SCP-6779 had disappeared from the site. Witnesses at the time claimed that \"the tiny little guy wanted to play Peek-A-Boo with us and he just vanished when we put our hands down, like the little rascal he is.\"\n\nAfter the incident, it was discovered that multiple small, low value items stored within the site were missing. \n\nAll site personnel have been accounted for after the incident, and a comprehensive memetic and cognitohazardous inoculation project is planned to take place at the site soon.\n@@ @@\n> [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6779/offset/0 Click here to return to your inbox.]\n\n[[div style=\"display: none;\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]",
