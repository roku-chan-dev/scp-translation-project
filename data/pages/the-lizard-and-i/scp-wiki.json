Dr ██████ was in the progress of exploring a new theory of containment for SCP-682: that, through genetic mutation, certain individuals emitted a scent which, whilst undetectable to humans, would pacify SCP-682. Upon breaking into the labs, D-085 triggered the research equipment's stimuli, indicating he was in possession of said scent.\n\nUpon discovery, D-085 was apprehended by site security and Dr ██████, the latter of whom explained his theory to D-085. \n\nAt this point, an unrelated anomalous phenomena occurred, resulting in dialogue and inner monologues being sung to the tune of popular musical numbers. The following is a recording from the incident:\n[[=]]\n**[To be sung to the tune of [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZyQwjVRT5c \"The Wizard and I\", from the musical Wicked].]**\n\n**[Dr ██████:]**\nOh, D-085,\nMany years I have researched\nFor a subject like you to appear\nWhy, I predict the Lizard could make you his\nFirst reason to cheer!\nMy dear, my dear\nI'll take you now to the Lizard\nTo give this theory a chance\nWith a scent like yours, dear\nThere is a definish chance\nIf this works as it should\nYou'll be making good\n\n**[D-085:]**\nDid that really just happen?\nHave I actually understood?\nAll these times I've tried\nTo escape or hide\nshowed my talent, I could\nGo and tame the Lizard\nIf I make good\nSo I'll make good\n\nWhen I meet the Lizard\nOnce I show my worth\nAnd then I meet the Lizard\nSee the acid bath's great, great girth\nAnd with all his Lizard wisdom\nHe'll say why he killed the farmers \nThen we'll join forces and rise up \nThe Foundation will face karma! Yes!\nHe'll say to me, \"Well, you're not that disgusting\nSo climb up on me and let's ride!\" \nAnd that's how we'll begin\nThe Lizard and I\n\nOnce I'm with the Lizard\nMy whole life will change\nCause once you're with the Lizard\nYou'll cause so much pain!\nNo researcher can bully you\nYou won't be cast into the flames\nThe whole world has to fear you\nWhen by the Lizard, you're acclaimed\nNo longer trapped by \nthe O5 inside\nNot blinking so that I don't die\nWhen we are claw in hand\nThe Lizard and I\n\nAnd one day, he'll say to me\n\"Eighty-five, human motives are so ulterior\nShouldn't a race with such red insides\nHave a matching exterior?\nAnd since off-site to an absurd degree\nSeem fixated on the sun, for me\nWould it be alright by you\nIf I, kill them all but you?\"\n\"Well they want to terminate me\nSo hey, why not?\" I'll reply\nOh, what a pair we'll be, The Lizard and I\nYes, what a pair we'll be, The Lizard and...\n\nUnlimited\nMy future is unlimited \nAnd I've just had a vision \nIt was memetic I think, I know \nIt sounds truly crazy \nAnd amnestics make me hazy\nBut I swear, today there'll be \nA containment breach across Earth \nThat's all been caused by me! \n\nAnd I'll rampage with the Lizard\nFeeling things I've never felt\nCurse Clef and Kondraki \nOur furious vengeance will be dealt! \nAnd even if you drop a nuclear bomb\nHe'll regrow all his limbs and won't die\nOh what a devious scheme\nWhen people see us, they will scream\nWe'll be the best uncontained team\nThe Lizard and I\n[[/=]]\n\n**Dr. ██████:** Come on D-085, stop singing into that microphone and move it closer to it!\n\n**Personnel D-085:** His throat's messed up man, look at it! He tried to match my Broadway vocals- (Gasps and screams)\n\n**SCP-682:** (Appearing to assault D-085's body) …those lyrics were… disgusting…\n\n**Dr. ██████:** (Retreats from the room)\n[[=]]\n**<End Scene>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
