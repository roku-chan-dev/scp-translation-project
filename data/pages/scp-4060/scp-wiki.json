The keys to SCP-4060's safe are to be assigned to two non-associated personnel with at least Level 3 Clearance. Personnel assigned to the SCP-4060 must undergo psychological evaluations and debriefings every month and after each onsite containment breach. \n\nAny onsite personnel shown to have sympathies towards any groups of interest on the Notable Groups of Interest List should be reported to Site Director Dr. Matthews. \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Request Notable Groups of Interest List\" hide=\"Replace Document\"]]\n> **Notable Groups of Interest List**\n> ----\n> This list is not comprehensive, if you are worried about the possible affiliations of a coworker please bring it up to Site Director Dr. Matthews.\n> \n> # The Church of the Broken God\n> # The Fifth Church\n> # The Global Occult Coalition (GOC)\n> # The Horizon Initiative\n> # Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n> # \"Nobody\"\n> # Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA)\n> # Sarkic Cults\n> # The Serpent's Hand\n> # Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU), Federal Bureau of Investigation\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-4060 is a small black two-pan beam balance scale. SCP-4060 is able to exchange memories between an individual and itself. Furthermore, SCP-4060 is known to obtain and store any memory that has been lost due to an amnestic, as well as any the object acquires through an exchange.\n\nSCP-4060's exchange manifests after a subject knowingly places at least one object on both sides of the scale and once both sides of the scale are left undisturbed for approximately 30 seconds.\n\nDuring the exchange, the objects on the right side of the scale are the influencing parameters for the memories the subject will lose. The same factors on the left side of the scale similarly influence the memories the subject will acquire.\n\nIt is currently unknown how SCP-4060 chooses what memories are exchanged within a given set of influencing parameters. The following are the current hypothetical effects of the influencing parameters for the exchanges caused by SCP-4060:\n\n* The total mass on a side of the scale correlates to the length of the memory exchanged.\n\n* The total quantity of objects on a side of the scale correlates to the age of the memories SCP-4060 can exchange.\n\n* When a subject places an object on the scale, that subjects sentimental or perceived value of the object correlates to the subjective importance/weight of memories exchanged. \n\n* Should an object that a subject places onto the scale have any strong personally held connotations for that subject, it will cause some of the exchanged memories content to correlate to that connotation.\n\n**Recovery:** SCP-4060 was recovered on 07/15/2005 by Mobile Task Force Delta-5 from Area ██, Sector ██, after ██ simultaneous containment breaches had compromised the functionality of the facility. Only a single handwritten letter regarding SCP-4060 was found in the remains of Sector ██.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Request Letter Recovered from Area ██, Sector ██, 07/15/2005\" hide=\"Return Letter\"]]\n\n**Letter Recovered from Area ██, Sector ██, 07/15/2005**\n\n> \n> My name is Dr. ███████.\n> \n> I am recording this as my last act on this earth.\n> \n> Agents of ███ ██████ ██ ███ ██████ ███ have infiltrated us and caused the simultaneous containment breaches that I am sure are causing a horrible diversion right now. \n> \n> Dr. ██████, who had been showing more and more overt sympathy towards ███ ██████, had been found to have leaked that SCP-4060 had granted memories related to SCP-████ in a previous test.\n> \n> --I am afraid-- I am sure that he was radicalized by agents of ███ ██████. They are most likely on their way here. After all, I have the only key to SCP-4060's storage container.\n> \n> That is why I am going to destroy our records of SCP-4060 and march into the other room. Then I will activate the Pyrogallol fire suppression system, take a Class D Amnestic to pass out, and ruin any hope those ██████ ███ zealots have of getting to the key alive. \n> \n> By the time anyone will manage to break into SCP-4060's container, it will be well after Recovery Agents arrive.\n> \n> --//I know they won't let you see this, but I need to say it. Even if I can't force myself to say it out loud.

Thus, a subject that uses SCP-4060 can acquire any such memory. As acquired memories are unaffected by amnestics, in order to prevent memory of catastrophic sensitivity being acquired by unauthorized personnel, only Class D personnel are permitted to interact with SCP-4060 and thereafter must have all of their communication closely monitored for one month by a team with at least Level 3 clearance.\n\n**Initial Testing:** Test Log only accessible to personnel with clearance Level 4 or higher.

Visitor logs state refute the subject's statement.\n> Afterwards subject begins to cry, claiming to have remembered giving birth and crying tears of joy to see his firstborn seven years ago. \n> **Analysis:** Subject seems to have had one last recollection of the memory as it is lost as well as the new memory as it is gained.\n\n__**Test 11/22/2005**__\n> **Test Overseen by Researcher Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subjects:** D-2120, female, age twenty-seven.\n> **Procedure:** Subject D-2120 places three 1 gram weights on the left side of the scale and then one 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject D-2120 remains inactive for several seconds before exclaiming the name of her girlfriend, who she claims had visited her while she was incarcerated at ████████ three years ago. Subject D-2120 has never been to ████████.\n> **Analysis:** Not every memory gained or lost through SCP-4060 seems to cause an externally visible response. In addition, the object seems to retain any memory that it has acquired through an exchange.\n\n\n__**Test 12/15/2005**__\n> **Test Overseen by Researcher Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subjects:** D-2310, female, age forty-one.\n> **Procedure:** Subject D-2310 places seven 1 Kg weights on the left side of the scale and then places a 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject D-2310 begins screaming and convulsing violently. \n> **Analysis:** After reviewing by several psychologists and hypnosis specialists, examination records are found to match those from the failed trials of 102-04-0576 [[footnote]] Failed iteration of Class F amnestic. [[/footnote]]. Concluded that any attempts to create an exchange with more memory gained than lost may lead to irreparable damage to those involved in the exchange. \n\n__**Test 07/15/2006**__\n> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subject:** D-1766, male, age twenty-seven, who had a week previously been asked to solve a Rubik's cube in return for a 6 pack of [REDACTED].\n> **Procedure:** Subject places one unsolved Rubik's cube on the left side of the scale and then one dog collar on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject forgets having terminated a dog during a breaking and entering he committed 01/13/2005. \n> The subject afterward has the experience to be able to solve the Rubik's cube puzzle that they had previously been unable to solve.\n> **Analysis:** Memories selected seem to have a correlation to the personal connotations the subject may have to items they have placed on either side of the scale. \n\n__**Test 8/15/2006**__\n> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subjects:** Subject D-4389, male, age eighty-four, diagnosed with dementia.\n> **Procedure:** Subject D-4389 places a photo of four security team personnel on the left side of the scale and then a 1 gram weight on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject D-4389 is able to name three of the four security officers by name as well as retain this information after 10 months.\n> **Analysis:** The memories granted by SCP-4060 seem to be immune to the effects of memory degradation.\n\n__**Test 06/15/2007**__\n> **Test Overseen by Senior Researcher Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subject:** D-1766, male, age twenty-seven.\n> **Procedure:** Subject places a 1 gram weight on the left side of the scale and then a 22 karat ingot of gold on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject began inquiring about information related to SCP-1883. Subject D-1766 had been used to test SCP-1883 before being given amnestics. Amnestics were once again given to Subject D-1766, who later awoke and continued complaining in regards to SCP-1883. Subject later found to have lost all memory how to solve a Rubik's cube.\n> **Analysis:** Memories which are gained are unaffected by amnestics. It is still unknown if the use of amnestics is another method by which SCP-4060 gathers memories or if it is simply undoing their effects. \n\n__**Test 07/15/2007**__\n> **Test Overseen by Assistant Site Director Dr. Matthews.**\n> **Subject:** D-4765, male, age forty-seven.\n> **Procedure:** Subject places a bowling ball, with the name Henry ███████ printed on it, and a 1 gram weight on the left side of the scale and then four 1 Kg weights on the right side of the scale.\n> **Results:** Subject recalls and recounts the events from the incident at Area ██, Sector ██, on 07/15/2005.\n> **Analysis:** It is confirmed that the use of amnestics is another method by which SCP-4060 gathers memories.\n[[/collapsible]] @@ @@\n**Classified Testing:** Test Log only accessible to personnel with clearance Level 5.
