When SCP-371-J is perceived by a human subject, they will begin laughing with varying intensity. The intensity at which laughter is induced is dependent on the amount of time a subject has spent working at a Foundation site, regardless of position or security clearance. Observed effects range from the spontaneous onset of pneumothorax[[footnote]] Collapsed lung [[/footnote]] on civilians to a moderate smile among various site directors. Subjects exposed to SCP-371-J will continue to laugh until they expire or SCP-371-J is removed from their vicinity. \n\nIt is currently unknown why SCP-371-J's properties are related to the Foundation. Research into its creation, motives, and possible suspects responsible are currently under investigation.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-371-J was discovered following the death of 43 civilians in a Tokyo art exhibit, with all causes of death being attributed to a lack of oxygen. Foundation agents successfully located and contained SCP-371-J. Two personnel suffered injuries from falling after losing consciousness due to excessive laughter.\n\n**Testing Log:** The following logs demonstrate the effects of SCP-371-J on various Foundation personnel.\n\n> **Personnel:** D-1221\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 1 day\n> **Results:** Pneumothorax affecting the left lung. Subject expired before treatment could be administered.\n\n> **Personnel:** D-11424\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 5 months\n> **Results:** Subject laughed uncontrollably until losing consciousness.\n\n> **Personnel:** Researcher Rex\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 1 year\n> **Results:** Laughed uncontrollably until SCP-371-J was removed from his presence. Subject suffered a minor headache and abdominal pain caused by lack of oxygen and laughter respectively. \n\n> **Personnel:** Dr. Everwood\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 6 years\n> **Results:**  Subject laughed moderately. No negative side effects were found.\n\n> **Personnel:** Dr. Walters\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 16 years\n> **Results:** Subject laughed briefly upon initial exposure before becoming silent again.\n\n> **Personnel:** Dr. Gears\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 28 years\n> **Results:** Subject verbally expressed mild annoyance at the presence of SCP-371-J at the start of the test and did not exhibit a noticeable change in attitude or expression throughout the duration.\n\n> **Personnel:** Janitor Worth\n> **Time Employed by the Foundation:** 59 years\n> **Results:** Subject destroyed SCP-371-J's shell and consumed its contents. Upon being questioned, subject replied [[[licensing-guide|\"Trust me, I am doing you a favor.\"]]] Following this event, SCP-371-J's anomalous properties did not manifest, and the anomaly was reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** 371-j.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-371-j SCP Foundation Wiki]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
