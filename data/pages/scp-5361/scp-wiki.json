The activity of SCP-5361-1 was to be monitored at all times. If SCP-5361-1 began to dematerialise, an inbuilt SRA would be activated.\n\nAs of 20/6/2021, SCP-5361 and -1 are considered neutralised.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5361 were a series of weather phenomena that occurred based on the emotional state of SCP-5361-1, a humanoid entity, superficially resembling the late Doctor Fordham who died on 27/5/2021. \n\nSCP-5361-1 produced an intermittent antimemetic effect on subjects viewing it and would manifest at a variable time at a variable location within the UK before beginning to wander without direction. After travelling for roughly 2 hours, SCP-5361-1 would dematerialise. SCP-5361-1 was not affected by outside stimuli, capable of walking through solid surfaces and would ignore any attempts at communication. \n\nAs of 20/6/2021 SCP-5361-1 has yet to manifest again.\n\n**Addendum.1:** Below are a series of text messages between Doctor Roberts and the late Doctor Fordham.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 25/05/2021\" hide=\"- 25/05/2021\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n**25/05/2021 at 11:43**\n[[/=]]\n\n**##blue|Dr. Roberts##:** Not long till you're back now\n\n**##blue|Dr. Roberts##:** I can't wait for us to finally spend some time together\n\n**##green|Dr. Fordham##:** I can't wait either\n\n**##green|Dr. Fordham##:** Only a few days left on this project\n\n**##blue|Dr. Roberts##:** And it's just in time for your birthday as well\n\n**##green|Dr. Fordham##:** We have to make this one extra special then\n\n**##blue|Dr. Roberts##:** You know what else is coming up?\n\n**##green|Dr. Fordham##:** Hmmm I wonder what?

Doctor Fordham was situated in the front passenger seat.\n\nUpon hearing what had occured, Doctor Roberts was allowed a week off work for grieving purposes.\n\n**Addendum.2:** Roughly 2 weeks after its discovery, Doctor Roberts was informed about the manifestation of SCP-5361-1. Doctor Roberts applied for a test to be conducted on SCP-5361-1. This application was approved.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Date:** 20/6/2021\n\n**Procedure:** Dr. Roberts would make contact with SCP-5361-1 and attempt to communicate with the entity.\n\n**Purpose:** To test whether SCP-5361-1 will react when presented with a person of interest from Dr. Fordham's life.\n\n**Results:** While SCP-5361-1 had begun to walk down an alley, Dr. Roberts rounded the corner and stood in front of SCP-5361-1. SCP-5361-1 proceeded to tilt its head downwards to observe Dr. Roberts, before they both embraced each other in a hug. SCP-5361-1 then proceeded to dematerialise.\n\n**Note:** After a prolonged absence of SCP-5361-1 once the test had concluded, the item was reclassified as neutralised.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5360]]] | SCP-5361 | [[[SCP-5362]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
