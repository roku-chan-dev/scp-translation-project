Any changes in the depicted subjects are to be recorded.\n\nZulu-9 is built around the North Hillcrest High School, and is hereafter referred to as the Exclusion Zone. Unauthorized entry into the Exclusion Zone is forbidden and must be prevented at all costs. The following measures have been taken to prevent entry:\n\n* All entrances into the Exclusion Zone, save for the front entrance, have been sealed with concrete. The front entrance is fitted with an airlock that may only be opened through majority approval of High Command.\n* Twelve Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs) have been placed around the Exclusion Zone, excluding the area of the auditorium.\n* The Exclusion Zone is secured with three tiers of ground-level, subsurface, and aerial automatic security.\n* Load-bearing points around the auditorium have been fitted with nitroglycerin-based molecular explosives. If the above measures fail, they are to be detonated. Evacuation of on-site personnel is a secondary priority.\n\nUpon entering the Exclusion Zone, SCP-7676-G are to be apprehended. They must then be sedated and prepared for surgical debridement. Medical staff are to carefully excise the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of their face. These are to be labelled with the student's name and placed on full display in Sector-2 for monitoring, and the site will be put on high-alert should any of these faces begin to show signs of rot.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nOnce the operation is complete, the instance must then be administered a paralytic agent and prepared for delivery to Site-19.

Its overall nature is highly dynamic, and it is capable of adapting to countermeasures and neutralization attempts.\n\nSCP-7676's primary characteristic is a virulent infohazard, termed SCP-7676-RECALL (SCP-7676-R), which attacks by way of weaponizing nostalgia.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nPersons who regularly interact with information pertaining to North Hillcrest High School or its Senior Class of 1976 are susceptible to SCP-7676-R. There is a greater risk for those who directly handle artifacts originating from the school or\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=personal effects of the aforementioned students. | content=the lasting marks of the aforementioned students.]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nIt should be noted that SCP-7676-R is primarily empathetic, being dependent on the experiences of the individual exposed. Null-Engram disqualifications were put in place to limit the vulnerability of personnel involved in the project.\n\nIn SCP-7676-R's early stages, the infected will regularly idealize or fret over their past; specifically, their childhood. It is through this obsessive recollection that the infected may undergo a CADENCE event wherein they experience:\n\n# An enlargement of the temporal lobe, and the development of a targeted form of hyperthymesia relating to memories of one's adolescence.\n# A burning sensation behind the ears.\n# Memories that begin to feature places and persons unknown, but purportedly intimate, to the subject.\n# Depersonalization and body-image issues, along with an irrational fear of having their faces touched.\n# Intrusive childhood memories from the perspective of another person.\n# Feelings of numbness, temporary bouts of partial paralysis.\n# Ego death, followed by a single-minded fixation on intrusive memories.\n# A separate personality forming on the basis of intrusive memories.\n# Violent and immediate full-body transfiguration.\n\nThe end result of the transfiguration is an instance of 7676-GESTALT (SCP-7676-G) - a subject who is the perfect mental and physical duplicate of one of North Hillcrest's Senior Class of 1976, specifically, a deceased student. Instances of 7676-G created through CADENCE events exhibit no anomalous traits besides a cellular stasis upon death - the students' bodies will not decay until that student's identity subsumes new infectee, at which point it will rapidly rot.\n\nInstances of 7676-G will proceed towards North Hillcrest High School and attempt to enter the school's auditorium. If they are successful, all photographic or recorded depictions of the subject will alter in some way which severely disfigures the face, leaving them unrecognizable. Heavy scarring, penetrative injuries, the removal of facial orifices, and deep lacerations have all been observed, with depictions varying across multiple images of the same subject. Furthermore, their entry inevitably triggers unpredictable reality-altering and chronological phenomena at random. While this has previously included events nation-wide, it is no longer restricted by distance.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nBased on the escalation of phenomena as more student identities are subsumed by SCP-7676, as well as the body of evidence collected over the years (see addenda), it is believed that a full assembly of the student body\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=would trigger an XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario. | content={{will allow the ceremony to begin.}}]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe auditorium currently houses over 99% of the North Hillcrest Senior Class of 1976, with the majority being comprised of personnel and civilians that have undergone CADENCE events. The congregation continually plays a simple ten note tune -- SCP-7676-MELODY -- vocally and on all manner of orchestral instruments, with only minor aberrations such as students singing out of key, or playing the wrong note occasionally.\n\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nSeveral anomalies relating to SCP-7676 are contained and cataloged by the Foundation under a variety of Item Number designations. While previously studied alongside SCP-7676, its developing virulence has lead to the loss of numerous Foundation personnel on these projects. These objects' files have since been edited by Null-Engram personnel in order to\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=eliminate connections to SCP-7676. | content=eliminate the lives of involved students.]]\nPhysical copies of these documents can be found in the site archives.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ **Discovery:**\n[[/=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"⮚ Access Addendum\" hide=\" ⮙ Hide Addendum\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block name=burial.jpg|width=300px|caption=Day two of original assessment.]]\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nSCP-7676 was originally categorized in May of 1976, when the entire senior class and its faculty did not return home from school for several days. Dispatched agents observed the affected for a period of forty-eight hours, during which time they performed various mundane activities; such as attending classes and after-school events. The town's residents were similarly affected: the situation with North Hillcrest and its students was not  \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=perceived as abnormal | content=a threat to you or your loved ones ]]\nby any means.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhen not otherwise engaged in scholastic activities, students would line up in front of their lockers until the first bell of the next day. They would then sing, whistle or hum SCP-7676-M in concert with one another. The students would remain in this state ignoring outside stimuli regardless of their physical condition; some were found to have soiled themselves overnight only to continue the melody unabated. Faculty members would lie prone and remain silent during this time.\n\nFurther irregularities include:\n\n* Thirteen students, while recorded as attending class, were unable to be located.\n* A student council survey to determine the year-long school \"theme\" was returned with nonstandard answers filled in, such as \"Remembrance\" and \"Symphonic\". All members of the band wrote in \"Penance\".\n* Students exhibited a complete lack of hostility, anxiety and any form of anti-social behavior, focusing on their studies and extra-curricular activities with zealous enthusiasm.\n* Flyers were distributed regarding an upcoming \"Reunion\" concert and encouraging audience participation -- benefactors \"Syncope Symphony\" were explicitly thanked for donating several instruments.\n* An increase in faith-based club participation was noted in all students and teachers, including known atheists.\n* The corpse of Freshman Nathanial Lyons was found in the library. Cause of death determined to be from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the left temple.\n* The auditorium was found to be impregnable.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nWhile canvassing school grounds, a class photo was discovered in the\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=main hall. | content=main hall.

The faculty were able to be evacuated thereafter. None were cognizant enough to provide concrete information on the missing students, or the auditorium's inaccessibility.\n\nThe building was closed and cordoned off under pretense of a gas leak. The students were to be redistributed throughout nearby school districts for a period of two weeks while investigators thoroughly canvassed school property and prepared for a breach of the auditorium.

All students recite SCP-7676-M as Foundation staff cease defensive maneuvers and lay down in the grass. The school bell chimes. The exterior door connecting to the auditorium opens of its own accord, and a second student departs from the crowd, following the first towards the open doorway.\n\nThe sound of instruments can be heard emanating from within the auditorium. They are playing a discordant cacophony, with each instrument being out of harmony with one another.\n\n**[22:55-23:03]**  Task Forces arrive on-scene and move in to intercept, and easily detain the second student. The school bell chimes, and a third approaches.\n\nAgents Reeds and McDowell are tasked with rescue of the first student as he steadily approaches the stage, whose curtains are drawn. Krogulski and Shields are instructed to man the doors to ensure they do not close. The rest of the unit works to disperse the crowd via deployment of tear gas.\n\nThe auditorium is infiltrated as tear gas is fired into the crowd. Reeds and McDowell advance on the stage cautiously, calling out to the student through the din of music. He ignores them, and clambers up onto the stage, disappearing behind the curtain.\n \nOut in the field, the squadron has broken the lines of student belligerents, many of whom fled the gas. The few remaining are swiftly detained. One young woman is nonresponsive.\n\nMcDowell is the first to reach the stage, heading up the stairs from the right wing. He shouts over the noise, receiving no response. The pair reach center-stage in front of the curtain. Reeds takes point, readying his weapon. McDowell stands to the side, grasping the curtain. With a free hand, he counts down silently from three, and then pulls back the curtain.\n\n**[23:04]** The remains of thirteen adolescents are seen scattered across the stage, held aloft by an unseen force. Though their bodies are limp, their hands can be seen to move, unsteadily playing their respective instruments. Due to the grievous damage to their faces, they are unable to be recognized.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nThe male student retrieves a trombone, and there is a deafening crack as his neck is instantly bent backwards from a heavy concussive force.

Both her and Shields strain to keep it from closing, and relay this development to Reeds and McDowell. All agents are able to successfully exfiltrate, and the door slams shut.\n\nFoundation staff rendered immobile by SCP-7676-M recover with no issue, and the remaining students experience confusion, having no recollection of their behavior. The unresponsive student is found not to be breathing, eliciting cries of concern from her peers as they beg for medical assistance.\n\nMedic Johansson kneels next to her, and attempts mouth to mouth resuscitation. The first attempt fails, with Johansson reporting the lack of a pulse. He leans back in to try again, and the school bell chimes. The unresponsive student's face rapidly putrefies as Johansson places his lips on its mouth.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nJohansson recoils and retches as the cadaver is sharply lifted into the air and towards the auditorium doors.

Over fifteen comatose individuals, ages ranging from 4-19, were found to have suddenly expired overnight. Further, a six-year old patient in Tennessee who was recovering from routine surgery suffered a grand mal seizure and died within minutes. In cases where a time could be identified, these were found to correlate to the male student's interaction upon the stage.\n\nStaff at Site-106 would also report an incident involving a car crash on Interstate 40. First-responders inspecting the remains of a young adult ejected through the windshield found them to be responding to stimuli, despite their skull having been fatally crushed upon impact. Based on calls to emergency services, the accident had occurred concurrently to the dead student's absorption by the auditorium.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nOver the course of the next several months, childhood mortality would increase worldwide by 23% through a combination of a marked upsurge in birth defects and delivery complications, and\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=expiration from terminal illness. | content={{All lies.

Quarantine measures were enacted, limiting the number of afflicted personnel to 27.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nOn August 21st, the Analytics Department submitted their findings to Site-41's leadership. Of over 300 hours of recorded audio, no correlation could be found when comparing sections of the composition to either classical or contemporary orchestral arrangements.

The families were handled thereafter.\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n@@ @@\nThere was nothing that could be done.

Some had assumed the name related to the mental affects of anomalies stemming from their influence, as in pathology, \"syncope\" refers to consciousness loss.

Rsr. Reese had come to North Hillcrest to study the potential memetic effects of SCP-7676-M. As such, he volunteered to isolate himself from the Foundation at large in order to document the effects of the SCP-7676-M. Dr. Weirn volunteered to study Rsr. Reese during the process.\n\nAttached is a journal Dr. Weirn kept during this time, with sensitive information redacted.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI went to see James Reese for the first time today.\n\nI found the containment for James to be unnecessarily strict. Two guards gave me a mental evaluation test, and I had to pass through an airlock to enter the concrete-lined containment cell. I've seen these measures used to contain some of the worst monsters in the world. Seeing James in the cell, comfortable with his furnishings he'd brought from home, was a nice juxtaposition.\n\nWe sat down on the couch together and watched some TV. I've always found it surprising that we're able to get //The Six Million Dollar Man// down here. I was glad to see James was able to relax. To the untrained eye, he still seemed to be just his normal self. He made jokes about his \"all-expenses paid vacation\" and drank quite a bit of beer. To me, however, he seemed a bit more quiet than usual. It was like he was stuck in thought.\n\nHere's a specific conversation I remember:\n\n\"Hey, do you know about the Panoptic project they're working on at Site-19?\" he said. He spoke in a monotone, to avoid transferring the meme.\n\n\"I know //of// it,\" I replied, in monotone as well. He was stationed to the project before he was transferred to 7676. \"What do you need?\"\n\n\"They were running an experiment for it. New visualization tech, something to that effect. Could you fetch the results for me? I wanted to see if I could give my thoughts on them.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Even if I could, I doubt they'd let me take anything written by you out of here.\"\n\nHe laid back. \"It's not like I'm going to be useful to the Foundation much longer.\"\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\nWe were quiet for a few minutes after that.

Professionally, it's difficult to tell between symptoms of SCP-7676-M and the effects of a sustained sedentary lifestyle. Personally, he's been getting fat.\n\nI told James about it, and while he complained that \"he came here to get //away// from his wife\", he understands.\n\nSpeaking of which, no real symptoms yet.

The summer camps he went to, playing ball in the yard. He'd talked about it before, and I figured he was just letting his life flash before his eyes. Now, he seems genuinely distressed over it.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I'm not able to talk to you anymore.\"\n\nResearcher Hopkins noted something similar, in one of the MTF agents that was exposed. I've requested the file from him.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIn other news, James has almost completely become another person.

In the end, it simply wasn't enough -- she was simply too underdeveloped to breathe on her own.\n\nWhat little time her father and I had with her -- brief moments of respite for skin-to-skin contact -- I hold those blessed few hours with me in my heart.
