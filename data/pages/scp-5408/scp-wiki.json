The exact structures that allowed SCP-5408 to sustain life are unknown; sample analysis indicates it was composed of silicon, iron, organic tissue[[footnote]]DNA/RNA analysis revealed the presence of 19 previously undiscovered nucleotide groups.[[/footnote]], nickel, and strontium-90. Though composed of large quantities of strontium-90, SCP-5408 showed no signs of radioactivity on external sensors prior to the Mageírema Event. Four rectangular orifices were located along its vertical shaft that expelled an ammonium-nitrate compound every 14 hours. This process was theorized to be a byproduct of a respiratory system. SCP-5408 was capable of broadcasting a long-range radio transmission that originated from a large crystal housed at the summit(designated SCP-5408-A).\n@@ @@\nSCP-5408-A was composed of a previously unknown organic crystalloid compound, capable of long-range communication. The transmissions broadcast from SCP-5408-A were a quadratic code system intermittent with theta waves; when decrypted the language used was a modern dialect of Kiswahili[[footnote]]Also known as Swahili.[[/footnote]]. The housing surrounding SCP-5408-A was impenetrable, making pre-neutralization testing impossible. \n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=vela4.jpg|\n    caption=Location of SCP-5408.|\n    width=100px\n]]\nOn 1978/12/21, Foundation satellite OU/556 detected a large spike in theta particles located on an island near Prince Edward Islands in the Indian Ocean. A Foundation exploratory team discovered SCP-5408 where no previous lighthouse was observed. Upon further investigation, the anomalous nature of SCP-5408 was discovered and Provisional Site-Q33 was constructed near the anomaly. Two weeks after the discovery of SCP-5408, the first SCP-5408-A broadcast was intercepted. A Foundation decryption team spent four weeks deciphering the transmission into Kiswahili and then English. The translation was as follows:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFF8E7; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\nEpoch special one time only.\n\nBiological inhabitants, 9.1 million variants. \n\nMany ingredients, very moist.\n\nMicrowave delight prepared by none other than [//Untranslatable//].\n\nOxygen allergy beware.\n\nOnly 13.6E18 [//Untranslatable//], buy now.\n\nLocation upon reservation. Meal upon arrival.\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-5408-A broadcasted this transmission every two weeks until 1979/09/12 at which time the Mageírema Event initiated. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Mageírema Event__**\nOn 1979/09/12, the SCP-5408-A broadcast changed composition, the updated translation was as follows:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFF8E7; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\nMany thanks, purchase confirmed.\n\nReservation accepted for [//Untranslatable//].\n\nPreparations begin on [//Untranslatable//].\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 1979/09/22 SCP-5408 began emitting large amounts of non-ionizing radiation through an unknown process. This radiation was similar to that used in microwave ovens, but at an exponentially greater concentration, increasing by a factor of 50% every 30 minutes. An emergency meeting of the O5 Council was formed and in a unanimous decision, brute-force neutralization was authorized. \n[[include component:image-block\n    name=vela2.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-5408's neutralization.|\n    width=100px\n]]\nFive hours after the approval was finalized, a dual-yield thaumic bomb known as the R5 \"Twin Canary\" was detonated at the summit of SCP-5408. Neutralization of SCP-5408 was successful though several inert fragments of SCP-5408-A remained. \n\nThe neutralization of SCP-5408 was detected by multiple civilian satellites, most notably the Vela Hotel satellite. Foundation assets within the United States and Soviet governments began a disinformation campaign aligning the event with South African/Israeli nuclear testing. \n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=vela3.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-5408 W Event.|\n    width=100px\n]]\nAt 09:23 GMT on 1979/09/23, an unknown energy phenomenon was detected by Foundation satellite GV-4433 located 25,000 km from Earth. The anomaly remained stationary for 36 minutes before dissipating. The exact nature of the anomaly is undetermined and was designated the SCP-5408 W Event.\n\nOn 1979/12/16, the Foundation intercepted a quadratic code system transmission identical to the one used by SCP-5408-A, originating from outside of the Sol System. The translation is as follows:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFF8E7; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\nRate one sun.\n\nLarge disappointment, want refund.\n\nArrived to raw meal, no service, no [//Untranslatable//].\n\nLeft without eating.\n\nDo not recommend.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this transmission, no further SCP-5408 related activity has occurred. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5407]]] | SCP-5408 | [[[SCP-5409]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
