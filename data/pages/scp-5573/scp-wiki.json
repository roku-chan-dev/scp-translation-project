Cover story Finlay-Bravo (\"Viral outbreak\") has been put into place with the authorities of Pope County in order to establish \"Federal\" jurisdiction over the local area. \n\nAll entities attempting to enter the exclusion zone from Farwell must submit to identification. Any refusal to such identification must be met with immediate and lethal force. All Foundation personnel exiting Farwell must submit to thaumaturgical scan to ensure that they are not host to any foreign entities. Refusal will result in immediate termination. \n\nCommercial and private air traffic flight patterns have been altered to further ensure no registered flights pass over the affected area, and station-keeping interdiction drones have been deployed in the area to enforce the no-fly zone against un-registered flights.\n\nFour mid-range Class 2 Scranton Reality Anchors have been installed around the perimeter of St. John's Church of the Messenger in an effort to prevent the spread of SCP-5573-B and to stabilize the extra-dimensional rift within. Under no circumstances are any personnel to enter the church without prior written approval from the HMCL supervisor or the current head of Site-06. \n\nAnyone entering the field without permission will be immediately declared deceased and will be summarily terminated upon egress. \n\n-----\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Description**__\n[[/div]]\nSCP-5573 is the designation given to the events and anomalies surrounding the manifestation of a Class 3 extra-dimensional portal within the St. John's Church in the town of Farwell, Minnesota.\n\nThe specific nature and physical description of the portal are unavailable due to the highly unstable fluctuations of Hume levels within the church. While the deployed SRAs are able to prevent the phenomenon from spreading, they have so far been unable to successfully stabilize the area to allow for additional exploration.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n+++ **Attached Addenda**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Discovery**\n[[/div]]\n\nAt 1013 on July 22, 2018, the Aureole Orbital Recon Array[[footnote]]See //Project AurORA - Akiva, EVE, and Hume Spectra Analysis From Low-Earth Orbit// 2nd ed., 2001 by Dr. Emmanuel Salazar for more details on the array.[[/footnote]] detected a massive spike in localized Akiva radiation in north central United States and subsequent investigation by the Foundation led to the discovery of the ongoing phenomena within Farwell. \n\nThis massive fluctuation was intense enough to register on Bonfield-Carizza Hume detectors throughout the central portion of North America, and the full scope of the resulting chaos has yet to be fully surveyed.\n\nAt 10:38, wide-area SRAs were able to be deployed from orbit in an attempt to stabilize the ongoing rupture in the local reality substrata. Due to the high energy requirements of these types of SRAs, the window for localized stabilization was extremely narrow.\n\nThis allowed for the insertion of a single Tau-6 strike team via drop-pod. This team was sent in to conduct search-and-report reconnaissance and has since been declared MIA. \n\nThere are currently no plans for a retrieval operation. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Additional Records**\n[[/div]]\nThe expedition into SCP-5573 was conducted by MTF Tau-6, details of which were captured by intermittent burst uploads from various cameras carried about their persons. The heavy interference created by the local Hume field displacement ripples made a continuous uplink impossible. \n\nThe wide-area SRAs were programmed to cycle through infrequent field harmonics to allow for occasional and randomly-spread moments of very localized stability in order to sync up with data uplink burst transmissions from the MTF.  \n\nThe first transmission contained the first on-ground video, a transcription of which follows.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 5573.doc.01 - Exploration Log Transcript ■\" hide=\"□ 5573.doc.01 - Exploration Log Transcript □\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n**Date:** 2018/07/22 @ 10:50\n**Monitoring Team:** MTF Tau-6 (\"The Forgotten\")\n**Operational directive:** Observe & report\n**Team Lead:** [EXPUNGED],[[footnote]]The identity of all Tau-6 operatives have been expunged from all records as per Oversight Command directive 12.82.Tau.

Camera shows Three being launched five feet into the air before landing.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Sound off.\n\n//[Tau-6 sounds off, all members unharmed and accounted for. The task force begins to move towards the edge of the town. The trees in the area are covered with large claw marks and a viscous reddish-black fluid. The task force climbs over several downed trees before approaching a house on the outskirts of Farwell. The door is ajar.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Three, Five. Move to breach.\n\n//[Camera follows Three as she enters the house. The walls of the foyer are decorated with symbols of unknown origin and a trail of blood leads further down the hallway. The team moves down the hallway and enters the kitchen where a table piled high in books sits in the middle of the room. Candles cover every other surface.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Two, check the table.\n\n//[Two approaches the table. As he reaches out to towards the books, the books ignite and rapidly burn. After two seconds, a small book is left on the table, surrounded by arcane symbols and a red liquid.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Four:** //[Over Radio]// Heads up team.

The hand closes around One and Two and they disappear. Three and Five begin to sprint down the alley. Three loses her footing and falls, turning over to see the hand dissolve into a golden light.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Five:** Uh... What the fuck just happened?\n\n**Tau-6 Three:** I have... no idea.\n\n//[Three climbs to her feet and walks over to one of the alley fences. A hand-shaped hole is burned through the wood.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Three:** Hey Fives, come look at this. That hand zigzagged through the alley, right? \n\n**Tau-6 Five:** I was busy running, sorry.\n\n**Tau-6 Three:** Yeah yeah, running. But look at this hole, this wood looks like it was just removed, like with a laser.\n\n**Tau-6 Four:** And? \n\n**Tau-6 Three:** Well, why aren't there clean-cut pieces of One and Two back there?\n\n//[Camera feed flickers for the next thirty seconds. Feed now shows Three and Five standing in front of a concrete wall, where a crude picture of a sun and a star have been carved into the wall.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Three:** What do you think it me-\n\n//[Three and Five are now standing in the kitchen of the house they had come from.]// \n\n**Tau-6 Five:** Wait we were just-\n\n//[A tear runs across the wall to their left and splits open, revealing a massive eye. It stares at the pair for a second before turning black and dragging the contents of the room into it. Five and Three run out the back door and enter the backyard. Both appear to be sprinting, but the fence remains approx. ten meters away. This behavior continues for five minutes.]// \n\n**Tau-6 Three:** Fives! Break Sideways!\n\n**Tau-6 Five:** Heard!\n\n//[Three abruptly moves to her left and immediately collides with the fence. The camera feed is disrupted by debris for several seconds but resumes to see a ~50-meter cone of wreckage in front of Three. The corner of a nearby house is destroyed and several small entities can be seen crawling out.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Five:** Christ, I hate rubberbanding.\n\n**Tau-6 Three:** We've got hostiles. Move to the alley.\n\n//[Three draws her service rifle and starts firing on the entities. She is soon joined by Five's chaingun as they push back towards the alley.]//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe team separation placed additional strain on the interlink connections between the various members, which denied the metaconcentrated bursts from conjoined uplink attempts. While the majority of the video transmissions are believed to have been captured, the data packets retrieved had to be stitched together by Foundation .aic. \n\nThe transcript of the second data transmission follows.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 5573.doc.02 - Exploration Log Transcript ■\" hide=\"□ 5573.doc.02 - Exploration Log Transcript □\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n**Date:** 2018/07/22 @ 11:07\n**Monitoring Team:** MTF Tau-6 (\"The Forgotten\")\n**Operational directive:** Observe & report\n**Team Lead:** [EXPUNGED],\"One\"\n-----\n\n//[All Audio Lost.]//\n\n//[All Video Lost.]//\n\n//[Five minutes omitted for brevity.]// \n\n//[The sound of wood clattering can be heard, as well as the sound of human groans. One climbs to their feet.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Two?\n\n//[Two pushes off fence slats covering him and sits up. One turns and the camera shows a room decorated in human remains. Intestines are strung from the rafters, elongating and contracting randomly. The wall opposite of door is covered in embedded human arms that twitch and grasp at nothing. As the pair move closer, the hands briefly stop moving and the palms open up, revealing a milky blue eye. Two steps forward and the arms begin moving in unison, all making the same series of gestures.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Two, get back.\n\n**Tau-6 Two:** It's not thaumaturgy, it's ASL.\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Well, what's it saying?\n\n**Tau-6 Two:** Happy Salvation Day. Over and Over.\n\n//[Screams can be heard from the floor above the two and the heads begin bursting through the ceiling. The hands reach towards them and clench into fists, collapsing the floor everywhere but above One and Two. The room fills with small entities, their rotting flesh and skeletal systems can be seen as they turn towards the MTF.]//\n\n**Tau-6 One:** We're cornered. Fire at will.\n\n//[One and Two open fire into the swarm of entities.]//\n\n//[Connection Lost.]// \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nIt is unclear if the instability in the video feed is caused by the intermittent quality of the transmission, a failure in the stitching algorithms utilized by the .aic, or represented actual events experienced by the MTF. Retrieved dialogue seems to support the last hypothesis,  which would represent much stronger Hume/Akiva fluctuations in the local reality structure than previously indicated.\n\nThe third transmission appears to be slightly out of sync with the previous two, but it is difficult to properly ascertain whether this represents temporal fluctuations along with the reality destabilizing effects or is simply a property of the intermittent transmission lag.\n\nTranscript of the third transmission follows.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 5573.doc.03 - Exploration Log Transcript ■\" hide=\"□ 5573.doc.03 - Exploration Log Transcript □\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n**Date:** 2018/07/22 @ 11:00\n**Monitoring Team:** MTF Tau-6 (\"The Forgotten\")\n**Operational directive:** Observe & report\n**Team Lead:** [EXPUNGED], \"One\"\n-----\n\n{{Camera Powering ON.....}}\n\n**Tau-6 Four:** Aaah.

Movement is seen on the west side of the town.]// \n\n**Tau-6 Four:** Something big over there.\n\n//[Four flicks the camera into the rifle's scope. The camera now shows a ~ten-meter tall quadrupedal reptilian entity chasing a smaller entity through a clearing]//\n\n**Tau-6 Four:** Shit. That's a kid.

Its head is covered in a bony carapace and ram-like horns spiral out from the sides of its head.]// \n\n**Tau-6 Four:** No eyes...\n\n//[The smaller entity lands on the ground and severs a tree with an upward motion while spinning, using the butt of the spear to launch the tree at the taller entity like an arrow. The projectile pierces the entity's shoulder and it turns, letting out a roar that carries to Four's position.]//\n\n//[The reptilian entity lunges to towards the small child, as the smaller entity moves to intercept. The child can be seen climbing a tree in an attempt to escape. The smaller entity pierces the reptile's flank with the spear. The reptile flails, tearing the weapon from its owner's hands. Using its forepaw, it strikes the smaller entity, knocking it across the clearing. As the reptilian entity moves to attack the prone entity, Four begins firing his rifle, striking the reptile six times across the face and jaw. Moving faster than anticipated, the smaller entity grabs the spear and pushes it deeper into the reptile, the point protruding from its mouth. It then threads its fingers between the teeth of the upper and lower jaws before jerking its arms wide, tearing the creature's head in half. The body begins to smoke and light can be seen glowing inside it.]//\n\n**Tau-6 Four:** Perhaps I'm the //Divine Intervention// here.\n\n//[The winged entity reaches out and lifts the child from the branches of the tree and places them on its shoulder. It then turns and appears to nod in Four's direction before walking away from the town of Farwell.]// \n\n**Tau-6 Four:** Now.

It is believed that this is a result of the team converging upon the central locus of the powerful ripples in the local Hume field. Lambent spikes of Akiva radiation show as vermilion waves of static across the visual field. \n\nAgain, this is unclear if it is simply a manifestation of the disruption to local reality experienced by the team, a byproduct to the disruption caused to the equipment, or the interference in the transmission burst.\n\nThe transcription of the final log follows.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 5573.doc.04 - Exploration Log Transcript ■\" hide=\"□ 5573.doc.04 - Exploration Log Transcript □\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n**Date:** 2018/07/22 @ 10:50\n**Monitoring Team:** MTF Tau-6 (\"The Forgotten\")\n**Operational directive:** Observe & report\n**Team Lead:** [EXPUNGED], \"One\"\n-----\n\n//[One and Two are seen firing into the horde of entities.

A shout can be heard from a one-room schoolhouse down the street. A nearby devil beckons to the MTF while running in that direction.]//\n\n**Devil-2:** [[span style=\"font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;\"]]If you can help, get over here![[/span]]\n\n//[As the MTF follows the devil, the camera shows the heavily damaged schoolhouse. The outside is completely covered in symbols depicting the sun and stars and it appears to have suffered immense structural damage at some point. Two devils are struggling to keep the doorway from collapsing in on itself and taking the rest of the building with it.]// \n\n**Devil-3:** //[Holding door frame.]// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Macondo Swash Caps', cursive; font-weight:500;\"]]There... are... still people in there!

The blade flexes and begins to lift the frame as five children run out and grab the legs of a woman standing nearby.  A tall figure walks through the door carrying a child. Dressed in a simple black uniform with maroon highlights, he nods for the devils at the door to let go and hands the child to the woman.//\n\n//Waves of Akiva radiation seem to pulse from him, greatly distorting his image in the visual pickups. It randomly flickers and his form is replaced by a brilliant winged figure, surrounded by a corona of coruscating washes of incandescent fire.]//\n\n**Unknown entity:** Ah! A Mobile Task Force. I'm glad you could join us.\n\n**Tau-6 One:** Yes, well, it wasn't exactly planned. Excuse me if I don't shake your hand, but do you mind telling us what the hell is actually going on around here?\n\n//[The entity laughs, and the sound can be seen in the rippling waves of Akivars flooding off of him.]//\n\n**Unknown entity:** Aren't you just the cutest? I am pretty certain that Azazel already told you that. Now, as much as I'd like to just stand around and shoot the shit with you lovely people, we're on a bit of a time table.\n\n//[His words are punctuated by the sound of a violent concussion somewhere off the the distance. 3 seconds later another lambent spike of Akiva radiation distorts the visual field.]//\n\n**Unknown entity:** And that is our cue to leave. Spending too much time here causes... problems. I am frankly too much of a target up here, so it's time to go! Come come.

A single spike of Akiva radiation was recorded before receding to a level .08 Akivars above normal. \n\n37 minutes later, a Foundation fast action team arrived on scene to find the town of Farwell mostly destroyed, with the civilian survivors gathered in front of St. John's Church of the Messenger.[[footnote]]The only remaining undamaged structure in the town.[[/footnote]]\n\nSubsequent interviews revealed that the civilians had already been amnesticised and had no recollection of the events leading up to the destruction of their town. Blood tests confirmed that there was no trace of amnestic chemicals in their system, which indicates that they were not under the effect of Foundation-issued amnestics.\n\nAn additional investigation into whatever could have caused such untraceable amnesticisation is ongoing. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5572]]] | SCP-5573 | [[[SCP-5574]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
