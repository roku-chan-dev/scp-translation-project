Though it can be both perceived and physically interacted with, thorough testing[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Including but not limited to: sonar, infrared, thermal, electromagnetic, thaumaturgic, and hume scanning.[[/span]] has determined that it is not within actuality. Public records report that SCP-6751 was built in 2007 by \"Lacuna Construction and Repair\", of which no other information has yet been uncovered.\n\nSCP-6751 is currently inhabited by SCP-6751-A, a 38-year-old man named John Dome. Dome was interviewed in 2012 by Agent N. Nescio, who was disguised as a journalist that was writing profile pieces on average Victorian citizens. Most of the interview's footage and all relevant metadata is inaccessible due to severe data corruption, thanks to a flaw in the construction of Nescio's concealed body camera. The following log is of what little video and audio has been restored.\n\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n\n+++* SCP-6751-A Interview Log\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6751/404.png\n| caption=SCP-6751-A\n| width=300px\n| align=right]]\n\n//[SCP-6751-A and Nescio are sitting across from one another at a small table in SCP-6751's kitchen.

It appears to be midday.]//\n\n**SCP-6751-A:** --iving here for about... 7 years? I inherited it from my father when he passed.\n\n**Nescio:** I'm sorry.\n\n**SCP-6751-A:** //[Laughing.]// Don't be.

I've always been a bit of an astronomy nut. I was one of those kids who was convinced he'd grow up to be an astronaut, y'know? Bought my own telescope and everything.\n\n**SCP-6751-A:** 'Course, light pollution here is only getting worse by the year. So I figured I'd make my own stars.\n\n**Nescio:** It's beautiful.\n\n**SCP-6751-A:** Thanks-- but it doesn't even scratch the surface.

See?\n\n//[SCP-6751-A takes several steps forward, pointing at the ceiling. Audio of his footsteps is delayed by 4.5 seconds. As Nescio appears to startle slightly when the footsteps become audible, it is possible that this delay is unrelated to the footage's corruption.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n\n//[SCP-6751-A and Nescio stand in the second-floor hallway. The ceiling is not in frame. There is an open door to SCP-6751-A's left, through which a darkened bedroom is partially visible, and a closed door behind it, at the end of the hall. The natural light levels suggest that this takes place at least an hour after the first video's events.]//\n\n//[For the duration of the video, nothing happens in the bedroom.
