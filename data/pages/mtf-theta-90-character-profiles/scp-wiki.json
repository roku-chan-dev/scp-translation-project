Well, Tac Team 10. Which is almost the same thing, narratively. Check out the [[[MTF Theta-90 Hub Page]]] for more.

Enclosed below is a link to the first of these, profiling Tac Team 10. For each member, you will find a statement of their current role and a short background summary. Additionally, Commander Dimaccio felt it would be enlightening to include a quote for each member pulled from Team radio communication archives. In the interest of fairness, I took the liberty of doing the same for him.\n\nOnce again, congratulations. And good luck. Paul Dimaccio will be a hard act to follow.\n\nI remain, etc etc etc.\n\nDR. A. CLEF\nDIRECTOR, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT\nSCP FOUNDATION MOBILE TASK FORCE DIRECTORATE\n\n[[/div]]\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Weiss, Jane]]\n[[=]]\n[[image weiss-smol.png]]\n\n**JANE WEISS, LIEUTENANT**\n**TEAM COMMANDER, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10**\n\n//(FORMER APPOINTMENT: SENIOR SPECIALIST, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10)//\n[[/=]]\n----\nJane Weiss (PhD., Topology) was recruited into a junior research position via a front organization in her father's home country of Ghana. Her initial few years as a researcher resulted in stellar performance reviews and a recommendation to apply to the MTF Directorate, which at the time was badly in need of more technical experts. Citing her mother -- a career Marine -- as inspiration, Weiss made it through MTF Basic School and joined the Angle Grinders as a probationary technical specialist. Rising through job classes (Probationary, Specialist, and Senior Specialist) in rapid succession, Weiss was appointed Lieutenant and Team Commander of Tactical Team 10 following the untimely forced retirement of Captain J. Smithson.\n----\n,,//\"I'm just... very lightskin, not white! Besides, I only did ballet for a couple years. It'll *really* mess up your feet.\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Feng, Zimo]]\n[[=]]\n[[image feng-smol.png]]\n\n**ZIMO FENG, AGENT**\n**TECHNICAL GENERALIST, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10**\n[[/=]]\n----\nCurrently, Agent Feng is Tac Team 10's sole generalist Agent. A Hong Konger by birth, Zimo Feng attended Tsinghua University in Beijing, at which they[[footnote]]I don't usually find it necessary to comment on my people's pronouns, but  Agent Feng asked me to add this note. In Chinese, Feng uses //ta// (他), with intentional ambiguity between the male-coded and gender-neutral interpretations. They use he/they in English as a rough equivalent. -Dimaccio[[/footnote]] caught the attention of covert Foundation assets during an academic debate series. Returning to Hong Kong after a year of post-graduate education, Feng was recruited after Foundation assets noted their doubt around becoming a police detective like their father. Feng then served in several different Containment Teams, in which they dealt with challenges ranging from low-level inert objects up to Keter-class sapient entities. Feng applied to MTF Basic School following a particularly challenging deployment in which they were their Containment Team's sole survivor. Joining MTF Theta-90 immediately following graduation, they have served to provide both generalist competence and a measure of wry levity to Tactical Team 10 ever since.\n----\n,,//\"You know, Specialist, I'm pretty sure you're allowed to let your mouth do the smiley shape every now and again. Go on -- give it a try. Or, just keep giving me The Zheng Glare. Doesn't bother me either way, big sister.\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Aluko, Treasure]]\n[[=]]\n[[image aluko-smol.png]]\n\n**TREASURE ALUKO, AGENT**\n**MEDIC, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10**\n[[/=]]\n----\nA born-and-raised Lagosian, Dr. Treasure Aluko (M.D.) left Nigeria to pursue a medical degree in the United States but returned immediately upon graduation to set up a community practice. Noticed by the Foundation during this process, Aluko was persuaded she could better serve the greater good by providing medical care to anomalies and Foundation personnel. Expressing a dissatisfaction with how much of her time was devoted to scheduling investigative surgeries, Aluko applied to and was accepted by the MTF Directorate during a time when a fully-fledged medical degree was required to serve in any MTF medical role. She served with distinction during this time, most notably saving the lives of both Task Force Commander Paul Dimaccio and Tactical Team Commander Jason Smithson in two separate incidents.\n----\n,,//\"Hey, you know what I like? A nice pad thai. When those noodles are just steaming and covered in the juices... absolutely delicious. Anyway, let's move his small intestine over here, and [...] What?\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Hernandez, Roberto]]\n[[=]]\n[[image hernandez-smol.png]]\n\n**ROBERTO HERNANDEZ, TROOPER**\n**TACTICAL SPECIALIST, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10**\n[[/=]]\n----\nA veteran of the Argentine Navy's APBT (Agrupación de Buzos Tácticos / Tactical Divers Group), \"Bobby\" Hernandez found his way into Foundation service via an affiliated PMC after becoming disgruntled with his military career. Initially serving in MTF Gamma-6 (\"Deep Feeders\"), Hernandez' dissatisfaction with the unit's mission led to repeated requests for transfers. Informed that no relevant MTFs had openings, Hernandez' continued insistence on transfer led to his reassignment to MTF Theta-90 to fill a need for a Tactical Specialist in Tac Team 10. Despite his professed dissatisfaction with his position, Trooper Hernandez' performance across all metrics has significantly improved since joining the Angle Grinders.\n----\n,,//\"Bro, just because I'm gay it don't mean I'm a pussy. I'm just fuckin' sick of this shit bro. I swear. Fuck this. I'm gettin' a transfer. Swear to god.\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Zheng, Alexandrinia]]\n[[=]]\n[[image zheng-smol.png]]\n\n**ALEXANDRINIA ZHENG, SPECIALIST (EMERITA)**\n**SENIOR SPECIALIST, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10**\n[[/=]]\n----\nSenior Specialist Zheng (PhD., Physics) was approached during her time in graduate school after a Foundation plant heard her present at a conference. Like Weiss, Zheng spent just a few highly-regarded years as a researcher before initial MTF service. However, Zheng had aimed to serve in an MTF from the moment she first learned of the Directorate's existence. Following Basic School, Zheng served for a time with MTF Zeta-9 before her particular aptitude set led to a transfer to MTF Theta-90.[[footnote]]In other words, she was better than average at the weird spacetime shit the Mole Rats hardly ever use, but worse than average at meeting their stringent marksmanship standards. -Dimaccio[[/footnote]]. After several years of meritorious service, Specialist Zheng transferred from MTF Theta-90 to lead her own research group. She is currently back in the MTF on secondment, in advance of Commander Dimaccio's retirement as Team Commander and his own upcoming transfer to Zheng's research group.\n----\n,,//\"I will determine the correct course of action, Probationary. We will then apply this approach until the anomaly is secured. Are there any questions?\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Smithson, Jason]]\n[[=]]\n[[image smithson-smol.png]]\n\n**JASON SMITHSON, CAPTAIN**\n**INSTRUCTOR, ANOMALOUS GEOMETRY TRAINING CENTER**\n\n//(FORMER APPOINTMENT: TEAM COMMANDER, MTF THETA-90 TAC TEAM 10)//\n[[/=]]\n----\nJason Smithson was recruited directly into the MTF Directorate as a Tactical operative following a decorated stint in the British Army's Special Air Service. Turning down several opportunities for promotion, he remained at the rank of Trooper for several years until the opportunity arose to lead Tac Team 10. Wounded in a green-on-blue incident involving a careless GOC team, then-Captain Smithson was reassigned to a permanent instructional and training position. Despite this, he seems to find excuses to perform \"field observations\" of Tac Team 10 rather more often than the expected instructor quota.\n----\n,,//\"Listen: it doesn't matter how strange it looks. Just shoot the fucker until it stops moving! It's not the fuckin' Theory of General Relativity. [...] What if it **is?** Well, that's what we've got Weiss and Zhengie for, mate.\"//,,\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Dimaccio, Paul]]\n[[=]]\n[[image dimaccio-smol.png]]\n\n**PAUL DIMACCIO, COMMANDER**\n**TASK FORCE COMMANDER, MTF THETA-90** //(TRANSFER PENDING)//\n[[/=]]\n----\nCommander Dimaccio (BS, Math) was recruited shortly after graduating from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Initially assigned to Foundation security, he distinguished himself in several incidents; as a result, he was recommended for MTF Basic School. Despite being accepted only on his second application, Dimaccio easily graduated top of his Basic School class. Subsequently assigned to MTF Theta-90, Dimaccio excelled not only in his own Tactical role but in learning about the other roles in the Task Force. As such, he rose to command a Tactical Team, and eventually accepted command of the Task Force proper. Dimaccio currently has a transfer pending to go to Specialist Zheng's research group; during the command transition period, he will remain in place to work with the new Task Force commander to ensure a stable handover.\n----\n,,//\"Yeah. I just wrote my fourth or fifth one of those last week. Total pain in the ass, like every year. Fuckin' RAISA, I swear to-- is this mic hot?
