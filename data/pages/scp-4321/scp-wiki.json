Coming to the city. Coming to the just kingdom.\n\n[[include info:end]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=cloud.jpg | caption=SCP-4321]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4321\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-4321's self-concealing nature and physical properties, physical containment of SCP-4321 has been deemed impractical. GPS locating devices have been placed on SCP-4321 for monitoring purposes. Foundation personnel are to intercept any aircraft approaching SCP-4321. Satellite imaging of the earth is to be intercepted and edited to remove appearances of SCP-4321.\n\nSamples recovered from SCP-4321 are to be stored in standard organic anomaly containers, and are only to be consumed under testing conditions. Operations to retrieve additional samples must be approved by the O5 council.\n\nA disinformation campaign is underway to convince the general population that dreams of flight are common occurrences. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4321 is an immense landmass that maintains an altitude of approximately 7km above sea level. It is shrouded in a thick fog, thus appearing similar to a large cloud to outside observers. SCP-4321 has been known to move in a similar manner to non-anomalous clouds, but over time has been observed to make slight deviations from predicted trajectories. \n\nAll unconscious humans within 30km of SCP-4321 have an estimated 2.5% chance of undergoing an AVIATION event. Subjects experience a dream wherein they fly to SCP-4321. Details of what occurs after the individual enters the cloud cover surrounding SCP-4321 are forgotten upon waking.\n\nInvestigation is underway to determine if other species experience these same effects. While no conclusive evidence has been found, research suggests that animals of kingdom Animalia do experience AVIATION events, but less frequently than humans.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-4321 was discovered after numerous employees underwent AVIATION events at Site-19. Investigation into the dreams led to the discovery of a disproportionate percentage of civilians from nearby towns having similar experiences. All affected areas lay along the direction of the air currents, which allowed Foundation personnel to restrict the search to weather based phenomena, eventually singling out one cloud that never appeared to dissipate. Sonar later confirmed said cloud contained SCP-4321's landmass.\n\nFurther details regarding the nature of AVIATION events were not corroborated until exploration operations were initiated.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Exploration Logs\" hide=\"- Exploration Logs\"]]\n\n**Subconscious Exploration:** To further investigate the forgotten content from the AVIATION events experienced during SCP-4321's discovery, 50 Foundation personnel trained in lucid dreaming gathered in an uninhabited area intercepting SCP-4321's projected flight path. A separate team of researchers operated Neuron Imaging Engines (NIEs) designed to detect sensory information during REM sleep and convert it into a video format through the use of MRI technology and thaumaturgy. However, due to the abstract nature of dreams, participants were directed to narrate their experience to compare with the detected visuals.\n\nThe only subject to undergo an AVIATION event during testing was Researcher Pine. Below is the transcript of the video generated by the NIE:\n\n> <**Begin Log**>\n> \n> //Dream begins. Pines lies awake in his bed. He begins to float through the facility walls.//\n> \n> **Pine:** I, um, I see I'm the lucky one, I guess. I'll try to keep my commentary professional, but I'm sorry if I, uh, I get caught up in the moment. \n> \n> //Pine exits the facility entirely. The night sky is clear except for a single cloud; presumably SCP-4321.//\n> \n> **Pine:** It's, uh, it's really pretty out— sorry. Professional. The weather is definitely different. I remember it being overcast. Also I'm, uh, fairly certain it's day time. I'm being pulled toward SCP-4321. Even though I'm lucid, I can't control my ascent much.\n> \n> //Pine continues toward SCP-4321 for thirty five minutes.//\n> \n> **Pine:** I'm getting closer to the cloud. Just also want to say that, uh, this feels surreal even for a dream. I haven't been able to get flying right in other dreams, um, always feels unnatural. But this feels incredibly natural. The only reason I know I'm being pulled toward the anomaly is that I can't explore the air too much. It feels like it's just inviting me in.\n> \n> //Pine enters the fog surrounding SCP-4321. After three minutes the outline of SCP-4321's main mass can be distinguished.//\n> \n> **Pine:** I can see it! There's a lot of trees and plants. I think those are, uh, pine trees? \n> \n> //Pine lands softly.//\n> \n> **Pine:** Never mind. These are palm trees, not pine trees. Dream must've made up its mind. Definitely more humid here than outside, but that's probably because I'm in a big cloud. I'm not feeling pulled toward anything anymore, but I can smell something... almost sweet.\n> \n> //Pine begins moving through the trees. Faint music can be heard.//\n> \n> **Pine:** This sounds like some sort of electronic music? I think?\n> \n> //As Pine draws closer to the music, the sounds of a crowd also become audible. Pine eventually enters a clearing to see a group of people in varying tropical attire surrounding a pool.//\n> \n> **Unidentified Woman:** Hey, new guy! Over here!\n> \n> //Pine approaches the young woman (henceforth designated SCP-4321-UW), who offers Pine a brightly colored beverage from the poolside.//\n> \n> **Pine:** Umm, sorry, I can't. No drinking on the job.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** You're working? That's no fun. C'mon, you're here for us right?\n> \n> **Pine:** You're not wrong.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** Then //at least// take a dip in the pool.\n> \n> **Pine:** Um... Oh fine. \n> \n> //Pine removes his shirt and joins SCP-4321-UW by dangling his feet in the water.//\n> \n> **Pine:** Quite warm.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** It's harder to enjoy a cold pool.\n> \n> **Pine:** So, you already seem to know quite a bit about me.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** It's your dream. I'd hope you'd know yourself.\n> \n> **Pine:** Very true. So uh, you're a figment of my imagination or part of this island?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** Kinda both? We're like a step removed from an incarnation of your own desires. I believe we've checked off \"flight\" and \"tropical vacation\" so far? \n> \n> **Pine:** I could always just experience this in my own dreams.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** Oh, don't lie to me. Or yourself. Well, same thing. But you know, it feels different when you're not in control. Feels more real.\n> \n> //SCP-4321-UW slips into the pool.//\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** C'mon, it's more comfy in here.\n> \n> //Pine follows.//\n> \n> **Pine:** Um, I guess I now get to ask - do you know why you do this?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** I mean, I guess we just like other people's fantasies? Always kind of fun to put on the skit and all. Been doing it for like, at least a millennium. \n> \n> **Pine:** You, uh, you look pretty good for a thousand years old. What moisturizer do you use?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** //[laughs]// You know, you're not the first to say that line, but it's still funny.\n> \n> **Pine:** You just float around and give off nice dreams?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** I mean, we also have a storage.\n> \n> **Pine:** A storage? Of dreams?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** A collection is a better word for it really. \n> \n> **Pine:** Can you, uh, show me?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-UW:** Of course! You're about to be a part of it anyways.\n> \n> **Pine:** Excuse me?\n> \n> //SCP-4321-UW looks at the water around Pine. It is now filled with pieces of Pine's lower body.//\n> \n> **Pine:** Wait wha—\n> \n> //Pine's head is shoved into the water. Transmission ends. Pine awakes.//  \n> \n> <**End Log**>\nDuring subsequent questioning about the dream, Pine could only recall the sensation of flight, although he described this sensation as \"mild\" and \"dulled\". \n\n**Physical Exploration:** To record the physical features of SCP-4321 and compare them to the results of the previous experiment, MTF Lambda-5 (\"White Rabbits\") accompanied by Researcher Pine were deployed to investigate and explore the physical landmass of SCP-4321. A member of MTF Omicron Rho (\"The Dream Team\") joined the expedition as well to give insight into any subconscious or dream-related anomalies encountered during the expedition.\n\n> **Operation Outline:** The team will be delivered to SCP-4321 via a helicopter.[[footnote]] SCP-4321 is at an altitude such that this is feasible without special modifications. [[/footnote]] The exploration team will operate for at most one hour before exiting SCP-4321.\n> \n> **Exploration Team Members:** Tanya Hart (Lambda-5), Tyler Dubois (Lambda-5), Juan Tierez (Lambda-5), Holly Trivera (Omicon Rho), Edgar Pine\n> \n> -----\n> \n> <**Begin Log**>\n>  \n> //The helicopter approaches SCP-4321. The exploration team activates their recording equipment.//\n> \n> **Hart:** Can we get a last minute comms check? We're about to touch down. \n> \n> **Dubois:** Check?\n> \n> **Tierez:** Check.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Checkerino.\n> \n> //A brief pause.//\n> \n> **Hart:** Edgar!\n> \n> **Pine:** Right, right. Uh, Sorry.\n> \n> **Dubois:** Are you ok? You've been quiet all flight.\n> \n> **Pine:** Yeah, I'm fine. Just feeling a little weird is all.\n> \n> **Dubois:** I thought you liked flying?\n> \n> **Pine:** No, it's not that. It's just, uh -- I'm fine. \n> \n> **Dubois:** Alright then.\n> \n> //The helicopter lands on SCP-4321. The team disembarks. The majority of SCP-4321 is covered with miscolored flora. Purple roots are found sporadically protruding from the ground.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** This doesn't look like a tropical paradise.\n> \n> **Hart:** Dubois, can you take some samples of the black grass?\n> \n> **Tierez:** And the trees. Pine trees aren't supposed to be this color either. \n> \n> **Hart:** //[to Pine]// Can you show us where you went? Or is the landscape too unfamiliar? Edgar?\n> \n> **Pine:** What? Oh yeah sure.\n> \n> **Hart:** Are you certain you're fine? \n> \n> **Trivera:** Give the guy some time. I'd be shook too if my palm tree paradise turned out to be some sort of forest of forbidden darkness. \n> \n> //Hart glares at Trivera.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** C'mon, I can crack a joke. Edgar and I go way back, he can take it. We'd spend all lunch break going back and forth over quips like that.\n> \n> **Pine:** That's one way to put it. I think I remember which way I went though.\n> \n> //Hart, Tierez and Trivera follow Pine deeper into SCP-4321 while Dubois collects samples. Tierez moves a tree branch out of his way, which snaps it. Purple sap leaks from the point of breakage.// \n> \n> **Hart:** Tierez!\n> \n> **Tierez:** I didn't mean to break it!\n> \n> //Trivera inspects the sap, rubbing some between her fingers.//\n> \n> **Hart:** What is it?\n> \n> **Trivera:** It just, it's hard to convey, but this sap feels potent?\n> \n> **Tierez:** I'll grab some samples.\n> \n> **Dubois:** //[through each member's ear piece]// Hey, you guys out there?\n> \n> **Hart:** //[to Dubois]// We are.\n> \n> **Dubois:** Good, good. Just wanted to report that after digging around, I found a skeleton. Probably the size of a small animal? Going to see if I can find any more.\n> \n> **Hart:** Alright, thanks for the update. //[to Pine]// You remember how far it is until the pool place?\n> \n> **Pine:** Shouldn't be too much further.\n> \n> **Hart:** Tierez, can you just get Dubois over here and help you gather as much sap as you can? I have a feeling that command are going to want to get their hands on as much as possible.\n> \n> **Tierez:** Yes Ma'am.\n> \n> //Hart, Trivera and Pine proceed further into SCP-4321. The purple roots sticking out of the ground become more prevalent over time. After twenty minutes the three arrive at a clearing with a pond of purple liquid in the center of it. Purple roots extend in all directions from the pool. The pool occasionally bubbles.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** Finally. Thought you said it shouldn't be too much further?\n> \n> **Pine:** I mean, I thought it wouldn't...\n> \n> **Hart:** Is it just me, or does this pool look like a heart? Complete with veins and everything.\n> \n> **Pine:** You think it's alive?\n> \n> **Hart:** It spoke to you in your dream.\n> \n> **Pine:** But maybe I projected that?\n> \n> //Trivera approaches and kneels next to the pool.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** This liquid, it feels almost conscious. Like, little glints of thought are entering my mind. Nothing big, but something else is definitely there. \n> \n> **Hart:** So, it is alive?\n> \n> **Trivera:** Not quite, but it can dream. And its dreams probably aren't the size of ours. They'd be bigger. Hell, it feels overwhelming even here in the land of the waking.\n> \n> **Hart:** Any idea of what it's dreaming about?\n> \n> **Trivera:** Not really. Although, to guess off Pine's video, probably us.\n> \n> **Pine:** Can we, uh, can we head back soon? I don't feel comfortable here. It feels pressuring. \n> \n> **Hart:** That's fine, I think we've seen enough.\n> \n> //The team returns to the helicopter with samples of both the sap and various flora from SCP-4321. The flight to command is largely uneventful.// \n> \n> <**End Log**>\n\n**Biological Analysis:** Eight sets of bones were recovered from the physical exploration of SCP-4321. Analysis confirmed that each set belonged to a species of bird. Below is a summary of the results:\n\n||~ Species ||~ Common Name ||~ Notes ||\n||Anomalopteryx didiformis || Bush Moa || Matched two of the bone sets. ||\n||Apteryx owenii || Little Spotted Kiwi || Matched three of the bone sets. ||\n||Kumimanu biceae || Giant Penguin[[footnote]] Extinct, prehistoric penguins originating from New Zealand[[/footnote]]|| Matched two of the bone sets. ||\n||Harpagornis moorei || Haast's Eagle || Matched one bone set.

Plays guitar for a small indie band. ||\n\n**Experiment Logs:** Below are the logs of experiments to determine the anomalous properties surrounding organic samples taken from SCP-4321. Preliminary testing showed that these samples only displayed anomalous properties when consumed, and have been removed from the log for brevity.\n\n> **Test #:** 8\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-3214 entered a standard testing chamber, and consumed 10ml of sap.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject reported hearing voices in his head. Analysis confirmed that this was due to telepathic abilities the subject had gained. Measurements of Aspect Radiation[[footnote]] Commonly used to determine the potency of thaumaturgic reality warping effects [[/footnote]] levels were consistent with those of rituals performed by a trained thaumaturge. \n> \n> **Notes:** //First time that we got a reaction out of a subject. Our cursory analysis says he turned into a type-blue with a really limited range of \"powers\". We'll keep an eye on this one to see if these evolve over the coming days. - E. Pine//\n> \n> **Update:** //Apparently our subject had a fairly vivid dream last night. There was a man in what looked like an old dusty basement. He messed with some wires and then pressed a button, eliciting a beep. Soon, a group of men in red military uniforms walked in and praised the beeping machine. Also, everyone sounded British.//\n> \n> //The subject then talked about a soldier in a field using the beeping machine. A group of men sat behind him, chained together with weapons trained at their heads. The soldier occasionally made remarks about \"the yanks\".//\n> \n> //My superiors advised that I should add a \"Dream\" section to the logs, due to how much detail our test subject was able to recall. It'll be more data to compile, but I can't disagree with its necessity. - E. Pine//\n\n> **Test #:** 9\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-4934 entered a standard testing chamber, and consumed 20ml of sap.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject demonstrated the ability to run at superhuman speeds. Aspect Radiation readings were similar to those measured during the previous test.\n> \n> **Dream:** A woman wearing a semi-transparent linen and a headdress leading a fair-skinned man away from a large battle between Egyptians and Romans. The man and woman are believed to be Mark Antony and Cleopatra.\n> \n> **Notes:** //I think I can safely say that, based off the Aspect Radiation readings, that the \"powers\" follow thaumaturgic properties. Due to the extreme difference in effects, I can't really make any other claims. My superiors are also interested in a reason why the subjects have these vivid dreams and powers in general, but I personally chalk it up to the nature of the sap. Some things just are the way they are. - E. Pine//\n\n> **Test #:** 10\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-3679 entered a standard testing chamber, and consumed 30ml of sap.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject claimed to feel \"freed\" before walking through the chamber walls. Subject proceeded to use this newfound ability to free the two previous test subjects, as well as a number of other D-Class personnel. Foundation resources have not yet found the escapees.\n> \n> **Dream:** N/A\n> \n> **Notes:** //Due to his display of negligence during testing that led to the security breach, as well as performing only cursory analysis of collected data, Edgar Pine has been removed from this project.//\n> \n> //The link between the physical effects and the dreams appears to be simple cause and effect (the direction of which has been deemed inconsequential for now). I will direct my efforts toward pinpointing any possible significance to these dreams.//\n> \n> //I will also abandon the investigation of what effect quantity of sap has on its anomalous properties, as it has thus far been unfruitful.  - M. DuVone//\n\n> **Test #:** 11\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-6032 was strapped to an operating table in a fortified testing chamber. A Copperfield Cage[[footnote]] Faraday-based technology to nullify common parafrequencies used for transmaterial phase-shifting. [[/footnote]] was placed around the subject to ensure containment. The subject was injected with 10ml of recovered sap.\n> \n> **Effects:** The subject became significantly more persuasive, almost coaxing the researcher injecting the sap to release him from the restraints. Subject was sedated by staff wearing ear protection before he was freed. Testing showed that the subject's writing also held the same suggestive powers. All communications from the subject must be relayed by a computer to avoid possible breaches.\n> \n> **Dream:** A man of Indian descent speaking to a large crowd of other Indians, making references to the \"Great War\". After about twenty minutes, the Indian Imperial Police arrive, and a riot breaks out. The speaker's name was believed to be Arjun Bahl, although the subject admitted it may belong to another member of the protest. Notable landmarks imply that the riot occurred in the city of Amritsar.\n> \n> Midway through the riot, the subject's view changed to see all of Amritsar. A majority of the buildings were on fire, the others hung some form of the modern flag of India on their walls.\n> \n> **Notes:** //Due to the ways in which the dreams we've seen so far tend to depict deviations from our understanding of history, I've done some research to see if I can pin down any similarities between the dreams and reality, or if they are entirely fabricated.//\n> \n> //I am currently trying to track down any information I can about an \"Arjun Bahl\", if he even exists. His name comes up in an archived census for Amritsar from around 1914. Unfortunately, that's all the information I've been able to find. I'm going to try to find any family he has in case I can ask them questions. - M. DuVone// \n\n> **Test #:** 12\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-7802 was strapped to an operating table in a fortified testing chamber. A Copperfield Cage was placed around the subject to ensure containment. The subject was injected with 10ml of recovered sap via a remote controlled syringe.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject gained the ability to transmute their limbs into various different tools, ranging from screw drivers to knives. Subject maintains complete control of this ability.\n> \n> **Dream:** A number of individuals with peculiarly large jaws, noses and skulls appeared to converse with one another while cutting an animal's meat using sharpened rocks.\n> \n> **Notes:** //This is definitely a dream about the Neanderthals. Without a doubt. Except they didn't have tools that advanced, or this level of sociability. They're acting like Homosapiens.  - M. DuVone//\n\n> **Test #:** 13\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-0041 was strapped to an operating table in a fortified testing chamber. A Copperfield Cage was placed around the subject to ensure containment. The subject was injected with 10ml of recovered sap via a remote controlled syringe.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject displayed a markedly increased proficiency in vocal musical performance. All said noises have been described as \"melodic\" and \"harmonious\".\n> \n> **Dream:** The Beatles performed a live concert. Each member appeared to be between fifty and sixty years old, however the music did not sound any different from their original live performances.\n> \n> **Notes:** //This one is slightly more modern, but there are currently concerns about reaching out for interviews because we are unsure which member of the band this originates from. We are also making head way on finding more about Arjun Bahl, so we will continue to follow that thread. - M. DuVone//\n\n> **Test #:** 14\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-6032 was strapped to an operating table in a fortified testing chamber. A perimeter of Copperfield Coils were placed around the subject to ensure containment. The subject was injected with 10ml of recovered sap via a remote controlled syringe.\n> \n> **Effects:** Subject's skin toughened, and sharp razor blades grew from the bottom of his feet.\n> \n> **Dream:** The Boston Bruins played against the Vancouver Canucks for the Stanley Cup. The game remained at zero to zero until a player named Harrison Guvaul scored, which resulted in victory for the Canucks.\n> \n> **Notes:** //Thank god. Something modern. I was able to easily confirm that Harrison Guvaul does indeed exist. He's a 32 year-old man living just outside of Vancouver, works a desk job at an insurance firm. He used to play hockey almost religiously until he was 16. I managed to call him up and weasel my way into a conversation about it. When I asked why he quit he didn't seem to have much of a reason though. Just didn't feel like it.//\n> \n> //In other news, one of my assistants found Arjun Bahl's grandchildren. They don't remember much about Arjun, but their parents told some stories about his authority issues. Was quite rambunctious, but grew out of it before he met his wife and settled down.//\n> \n> //I might only have two data points at the moment, but I'm starting to form a thesis. I need to take a few more readings, but I feel like I need to consult an actual thaumaturgist about this. - M. DuVone// \n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@ \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Level 4/4321 Classified\" hide=\"- Level 4/4321 Classified\"]]\n\n\n**Interview with SCP-4321:** By her own request, Holly Trivera attempted to undergo an AVIATION event to converse with SCP-4321. Her dream was monitored and recorded by the NIE. Below is a transcript of the resulting video:\n\n> <**Begin Log**>\n> \n> //Dream begins. Trivera awakes from her bed and flies toward SCP-4321. After 32 minutes SCP-4321's main landmass comes into view, covered with oak trees. Trivera lands.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** Don't make me walk all the way in there. I already flew up here.\n> \n> //An entity resembling Researcher Pine (from here on referred to as SCP-4321-P) appears from behind one of the trees.//\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** I see you are another lucid dreamer. That's probably not the right term, but you have more control than most I encounter.\n> \n> **Trivera:** I assume you know why I'm here.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** I //am// the embodiment of your desires. Like how you want your friend to go back to normal.\n> \n> **Trivera:** He's been acting weird ever since he met you. So, I just mostly wanted to know, why? It's not like he did anything to you. Or anyone else whose motivation you've sapped.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** I think the best way to address this would be with a little tour. Show you around the collection.\n> \n> //SCP-4321-P turns around and motions for Trivera to follow. They walk toward the center of SCP-4321, until they arrive at a large hole, lined with stairs descending in a spiral. The two descend the stairs, eventually stopping at a corridor extending into the side of the hole.//\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** And here we have my favorite pieces. I keep them close to the top for easy access. The rest I order chronologically.\n> \n> //SCP-4321-P and Trivera enter the corridor. Frames hang from the walls, each one playing a video that appears to be on loop.//\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** //[motioning to one of the frames]// This one I call \"Math Whiz\". See how she thinks she's close? It's like when you have a word on the tip of your tongue. And then that look of joy when she's found the answer, priceless. I mean, it's not //actually// the answer. Pi is closer to three than seven, but she's so happy about it.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Sure, but I don't see how—\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Or this work! The symbolism here is superb, ascending the stairs like how he was supposed to ascend to the throne. \n> \n> **Trivera:** Yes, I get it. They all look quite happy achieving their goals.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Except that's not the point. It's about the feelings that come before the success. There's that frustration and anger. Imagine how crushed they would be if they failed. You won't see that here, of course. This is the dream, not reality.\n> \n> **Trivera:** You think this is a charity?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Essentially. \n> \n> **Trivera:** You realize how \"high and mighty\" that makes you sound, right?  \n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Oh, don't patronize me. I've felt that pain too. Back before I started my curating, I was on the ground. I didn't belong there. It felt awkward, tawdry. I was embarrassed I couldn't take to the skies.\n> \n> **Trivera:** But now you're a flying island. So, everything worked out for you.\n> \n>  **SCP-4321-P:** Most people aren't as... strong as I am. You can read a textbook and count how many people had the strength to change their world. It's much smaller than the number of people who've lived and died. Their names are missing because they lacked strength like mine. And I grow stronger by the day.\n> \n> **Trivera:** By eating people's dreams?\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Oh, don't use that term. You make me sound like a savage.\n> \n> **Trivera:** You take dreams from people, and turn them into a distilled liquid. That sounds like a digestive tract to me.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** Fine, call it what you will. You'll be joining my collection soon, whether you've been curated or eaten doesn't really matter.\n> \n> **Trivera:** I'm sorry, I don't want to end up like the real Pine.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** I mean, you don't exactly have a choice. You're already here.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Of course I have a choice. It's still my dream. You obviously haven't figured out how to extract what you want quite yet, or else I would've noticed. Or my body would be falling apart. One of the two.\n> \n> **SCP-4321-P:** So?\n> \n> **Trivera:** I'll just wake myself up now.\n> \n> //Trivera turns around, and runs out of the corridor. She jumps off the stairs into the hole, and begins to accelerate, moving faster than terminal velocity. She awakes just before she hits the ground.//\n> \n> <**End Log**>\n\n**Interview With Dr. Tilda Moose:** To better understand the thaumaturgic effects created by the organic samples recovered from SCP-4321, Dr. Maxwell DuVone consulted with retired thaumaturge and site director Dr. Tilda Moose. Below is the transcript of the resulting interview:\n\n> <**Begin Log**>\n> \n> **DuVone:** Evening, director.\n> \n> **Moose:** Evening, and you know I'm retired right? You can dispense with the title. Even though technically I shouldn't even be having this conversation.\n> \n> **DuVone:** Well, if you want to go there, you were supposed to be wiped when you left.\n> \n> **Moose:** Eh, being director of nineteen has its perks. Nineteen should also have everything you're looking for. \n> \n> **DuVone:** I tried asking around 19, and some of our main archives on type-blues. Couldn't find anything.\n> \n> **Moose:** Talk to any thaumaturgists?\n> \n> **DuVone:** Most of their identities are classified, or were too busy to talk to me. You seemed like the next best option. But I think you already knew that.\n> \n> **Moose:** You're not wrong. Although you know I'm not a magician. Not anymore. You have those experiment results on you? \n> \n> **DuVone:** Right here.\n> \n> //DuVone hands Moose a hard copy of the SCP-4321 testing log. When Moose finishes reading, she sets the papers down.//\n> \n> **DuVone:** Anything come to mind?\n> \n> **Moose:** You sure there was nothing about sources or magic?\n> \n> **DuVone:** None that I had access to.\n> \n> **Moose:** They must not have declassified it yet. I'm a little surprised they didn't make an exception for you.\n> \n> **DuVone:** I don't follow.\n> \n> **Moose:** Well, this sap. It's distilled dreams from across history, correct?\n> \n> **DuVone:** That's our working assumption, yes.\n> \n> **Moose:** But they aren't just any dreams. They're the dreams you wish you could achieve in real life. It's raw desire. So let's take a step back. A little bit of sorcery one-o-one. Magic is a way to bend the world to your will, right? \n> \n> **DuVone:** In very loose terms, I guess.\n> \n> **Moose:** Well, the layman believes that the \"will\" and the \"bending\" are two separate parts of the equation. And that's how the Foundation would like to keep it. Probably why my paper is still classified.\n> \n> **DuVone:** Are you saying that magic—\n> \n> **Moose:** Is just an incarnation of willpower. If your will is strong enough, the bending will happen all on its own. \n> \n> **DuVone:** So, the sap was giving our subjects just the will to do something? \n> \n> **Moose:** Which manifested as both the dreams and the powers. It's incredibly potent willpower. See, I used to tell potential Sigma-3 members that anyone is capable of performing magic. But very few of them actually pull it off. That's because you can't fake it. You truly need to want it from the bottom of your heart, stronger than anything else. You can't train that. It's the kind of raw desire that can come from anyone, but not //everyone//. \n> \n> **DuVone:** I— I think I understand why it's classified now. I need to delete the recording and get myself amnestized. So sorry for the disturbance.\n> \n> **Moose:** Oh, don't worry about that. I'll call— who took over for me?\n> \n> **DuVone:** Gears.\n> \n> **Moose:** I'll give him a call. Get your team authorization.\n> \n> **DuVone:** Wouldn't that have been easier to begin with?\n> \n> **Moose:** //[laughs]// If people at nineteen actually understood what you were messing with someone would've given you the keys. You just got unlucky.\n> \n> **DuVone:** Well, thanks for your time. You know, you're much more— relaxed than how my colleagues described you.\n> \n> **Moose:** That's because they remember me from when I was their boss. Retiring does nice things for you. Also, that encounter with SCP-4321 gave a hand, probably. Didn't realize it at the time, but after that dream everything felt less consequential I guess.\n> \n> **DuVone:** It did eat your dreams after all.\n> \n> **Moose:** Quite true! It's funny how much hinges on those night visions of ours. \n> \n> **DuVone:** I guess so. I have to get going. Thanks for your time.\n> \n> **Moose:** No problem. Good luck with your island.\n> \n> <**End Log**>\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@ \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Edgar Pine Interview Transcript\" hide=\"- Edgar Pines Interview Transcript\"]]\n\n**Exit Interview:** Three months after undergoing the AVIATION event, Edgar Pine retired from the Foundation. Holly Trivera requested to perform the exit interview, which has been logged with SCP-4321 due to possible connections to the anomaly.\n\n> <**Begin Log**>\n> \n> **Pine:** Huh, didn't expect to see you here.\n> \n> **Trivera:** I could say the same to you.\n> \n> //Silence for 36 seconds.//\n> \n> **Trivera:** Why are you leaving? I thought you loved it here.\n> \n> **Pine:** I mean, I used to. People change, they move on. That's that.\n> \n> **Trivera:** But, it just feels so sudden.\n> \n> **Pine:** It's not like I'm the first person in history to lose interest in something.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Except we're both fairly sure this is due to that floating island you interviewed.\n> \n> **Pine:** That doesn't change the core of the matter. \n> \n> **Trivera:** Which is?\n> \n> **Pine:** I just don't care anymore. \n> \n> **Trivera:** What does that even mean?\n> \n> **Pine:** It means I woke up that morning and felt drained. I regretted the coming day. You can't change that. I can't just //make myself care//. How does that not make sense to you? \n> \n> **Trivera:** It— it does make sense. Sorry, it's just weird for me. That dream changed you.\n> \n> **Pine:** People change all the time, Holly. It's not like we can't go back out for beers ever again. I just won't be wearing a lab coat.\n> \n> **Trivera:** That's not even true! You know you're getting wiped, right?\n> \n> **Pine:** Oh, yeah I guess I knew that. Well, you'll find others to pick up your tab.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Doesn't mean you won't be gone. I don't want you to lose to that thing.\n> \n> **Pine:** That's not the right way to look at it. I'm not losing to it. It's not like I gave up all on my own. I was just unlucky.\n> \n> **Trivera:** I guess so.\n> \n> **Pine:** Like, if that first event targeted you instead of me, this conversation would be flipped. But you're luckier than me, and sometimes, all the will power in the world can't beat out luck. For every Caesar or Tesla there are millions of Pines. And that's... that's ok. Not everyone needs to be in a history textbook.\n> \n> **Trivera:** So, you're just moving on?\n> \n> **Pine:** I'm moving on. New chapter. And who knows? Maybe this'll be the one I'm remembered for.\n> \n> **Trivera:** Well, it was nice working with you.\n> \n> **Pine:** You too Holly. You too.\n> \n> <**End Log**>\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4320]]] | SCP-4321 | [[[SCP-4322]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
