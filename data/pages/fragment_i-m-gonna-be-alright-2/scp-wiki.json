She let ten minutes pass, five for the alarm to stop and five for the buzz of the lights to simmer into the background.\n\nIt was the same colorless room. Well technically beige is a color. There was only one window in the room to gaze out of, but at least it was big. Nothing more to see but another smaller room and a door she hadn’t seen open in months. There used to be doctors in and out, in and out all the time. \n\nShe slipped out of the sheets, her feet just barely hovering over the ground before she landed. She unrumpled the blue gown given to her and got to work.  \n,,//##E8E9E8|Straighten out your bed.##//,,\n\n“This one is good. This one…just tear stains. This one smells…iffy. How long has it been?” She tossed one of the folded sheets into a receptacle not too far away from the bathroom she entered.\n\nShe approached the sink guided by the light slipping through from the bedroom. She splashed some cold water on her face, letting it drip off into the drain. Her reflection was opaque in the dim light, yet still too visible. Her hand trembled toward the switch.\n,,//##E8E9E8|Fix yourself up. We can't be late!##//,,\n\nHer skin was clammy, with the hue of a yam. Her eyes, sad and crusty, at least the parts she could glean away from her hair that had grown wild with its coarseness and curls.\n\nNo scissors, no combs. That made sense, safety was important. Without a comb. It was impossible to bring back within reason. The doctors would probably help her if she asked, but when would she see them? They would just shave it all off anyway. Can't have that. Can't have anything.\n \n“…Come on, keep fighting.\"\n\nNo, not that.\n\n\"할수 있어요…”\n\nNot strong enough.\n\n“I’m…”\n\n…\n\n“결심면 성공해! 결심면 성공해!”\n\nThat was it.  She learned from dad’s doctor how repetition can help with learning, even after being sick or getting hurt. If he was able to walk again, it could work for her too.\n\nIt wasn’t all that helpful really, but she had nothing else to lose. \nEven if it hadn’t worked yet. Not like anything ever did.\n\n…\n\nFor those who quit! Not her! She searched for courage anywhere but in her reflection.\n,,//##E8E9E8|I’m sorry…my beloved.##//,,\n\nThe plastic case surrounding the mirror made it difficult to see herself, but she was grateful she came out in lower definition. She took a strand from the matted mess her hair had become, feeling like hay between her fingers. No bottles or containers either. It snaked back into its coil on release, joining the gnarled mess across her potato head. She did her best to comb through diligently with her fingers, wincing as parts broke off into the sink. It felt like some hair had been torn out. When was that again? Embarrassing.\n\nShe continued, trying not to get distracted by the constellations forming across her face. Her sad eyes and the bags under them didn’t do her any favors. Did she put on weight? Of course, being stuck in this room all day.\n\nAfter taking an unpleasant whiff of herself she prepared for the shower with more pressure than warmth.\n\nShe attempted to hide her imbalanced mane in a ponytail. Even if she wasn't still shivering from the air dryers it would have been difficult.\n\nStill off, even after the 3rd time she re-tied it. She made do with the strings from the last pillow case she had. They kept the pillow wrapped under a cloth bolted to the bed now,  so once those were lost, she lost.\n\nThe familiar whine of the alarm blared. This one was for breakfast. It was her 5th failure, but it would have to do. She rushed to finish cleaning her face and teeth as best as she could and ran out. Her plate had already arrived.\n\nThe food here took no time at all to become cold, soggy and bland and sure enough, the tray seemed to have slid through the compartment by the door ages ago.\n\nIt tasted a little better when the doctors brought it to her themselves. She remembered in the early days they even made a nice breakfast with the fat French toast sticks she liked.\n\nThey don't even talk to her now, even when they do come by. She thought she would have gotten used to it, but the quiet just reminded her of being in trouble and the shame of it.\n\nShe tossed the sausage aside and did her best to soak up the meat juices with the few napkins provided.\n\n…six months.\n\nShe tossed aside the napkin, more grease than tissue. \n ,,//##E8E9E8|Make this paper blue.##//,,\n\nShe mulled over the desk that sat in the center of the room as she endured the bland paste this hospital called eggs on her tongue. It was covered in colorful pages, most of which had smeared words on them. Each started life as a letter for the Cho’s. They were corpses now, desecrated with scratches, red ink, and tears merged into each page. Gross. \n\nTwo small sketch books laid atop each other next to her meal.\n,,//##E8E9E8|Play this symphony without misplaying a single note.##//,,\n\nShe remembered one of them was filled with attempts to rewrite a song they showed her. She could never get it back all the way, and they didn’t come around anymore to bring markers or instruments. She had a bottle she was using for sound but of course. The others were probably pictures she’d rather not see. They wouldn’t be finished anyway.\n\n,,//##E8E9E8|Solve this puzzle and don’t stop until it’s complete##//,,\n\nShe couldn’t bring herself to open the puzzle box under the desk anymore. She lost the pieces to it and couldn’t find them in the room. Somehow. She didn’t know how she did it, but she knew she did it. Sheets weren’t folded right either. Even missed the bin like a fathead.\n\nSix months here, and she was getting worse every day. She stirred around the eggs hoping when they met the char of the “toast” they’d make a compromise for the sake of her tongue. No wonder she’d gotten fat, the only thing she can stomach is the milk and juice that tasted like pure sugar from a fruit that couldn’t exist. \n\n…No.\n\nShe was just making excuses. She had just gotten careless cause she’s sick. If someone else were here, she’d be embarrassed by how silly she was being.\n\n…\n\nWas she going to be ok?\n\nWhat she had wasn’t normal and this was clearly an expensive hospital with experimental methods. She should be grateful there was hope for her at all, but six months... \n\nDr. Wensley barely did tests anymore. The last time she saw him he said the same things he usually did, but he kept looking at her like mom would look at her brother when he’d come home late. Had she done so poorly?\n\n어마님…Papa…\n\nShe slid back out a tray with a puddle of paste that was once cereal and milk and two cartons, emptied of every drop.\n\nThese were the kind of places that people were always trying to sneak into in movies and games. They protected things here, right? Maybe they had cures for rare diseases stored somewhere here. They probably had cures for all kinds of things.\n\nBut none for what was wrong with her.\n\nMaybe she was just stupid.\n\nThat's why she's still here. That's why she hasn't gotten better. She wasn’t trying hard enough.\n\nShe noticed some muffled voices from beyond the room. Beyond the window.\n\nIt sounded like Dr. Wensley was talking with someone. They both sounded tired. What were they saying? The murmuring passed as suddenly as it came. It was probably nothing good anyway. Good things never happened here. At least not for her.\n\n\"Stop it!\"\n\nIt was frustrating, but she had to try harder. The doctors were trying their hardest to help her and it couldn't have been cheap or easy for her family to bring her here. She just had to bear it for a little longer, then she could see her family again.\n \n어마?\n\nMom is Mom of course.\n\nPapa was…\n\nJun? No, 어빠 is Jun.\n\nAnd she was\n\n“[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2599 2599], on your feet!”\n\n“Ok.”\n\nShe fell out of the chair with a jolt, landing on her knees. She erected herself on them all in one motion.\n\n\"Oh, come on!”\n\nShe saw them now. Two women, one with short hair and all the armor, a security guard. The other, in a white coat and a ponytail, a doctor. Must be new to talk to her like that.\n\n“It’s the only rule we have for it. One simple rule.” The doctor gestured to the grumbling guard.\n\n\"Come on stand up!\" She screamed to herself in whispers as the guard approached. The cold glove came under her arm to lift her up.\n\n\"NO I-\"\n\nAs she tensed, the guards pull lost any attempt at gentleness and jerked her to her feet, succeeding at lifting only one. The woman's face went pale when 2599 pulled back against her. Just as quickly it shrank back into a scowl. \n \n\"Easy, she’s still just a kid.\" The doctor walked in and gestured toward the door.\n\n“Just a kid my ass.”\n\nThey were finally going to work on her again. Finally, and she couldn’t even get to her feet. The next tug lost any gentleness. She pulled as an old man would an errant dog. The guard got her on her feet and pushed her to the doctor who promptly took her hand.\n\nShe really wasn’t supposed to talk to her anymore. She understood why, she accepted it by now. But still…\n\n\"…I can walk on my own.\" she whimpered as the doctor walked her through the halls.\n\n^^##fffafa|yaaaay they remembered you!##^^\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-m-gonna-be-alright/offset/2|Guess I should feel lucky]]]\n[[/>]]",
