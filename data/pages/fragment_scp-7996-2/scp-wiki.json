Due to the rapid deterioration of the universe and the imminent annihilation of humanity, no further efforts of stopping or slowing SCP-7996 are being considered.\n \n**Description:** SCP-7996 is the designation given to the ongoing deterioration of the universe, resulting from decreasing Hume levels. SCP-7996 is expected to cause a ZK-Class Reality failure within the next week. While the presence of SCP-7996 was discovered in 2059, the catalyst for accelerated deterioration is the result of Foundation-initiated Project SETFREE. This project was initiated with the intent to eliminate all pataphysical connections to alternate universe U7k.
