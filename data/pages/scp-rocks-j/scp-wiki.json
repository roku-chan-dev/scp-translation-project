As instances of SCP-ROCKS-J have reacted negatively to being separated from one another, instances have been allowed to be contained in the same container as long as they keep disputes and arguments to a minimum.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ROCKS-J refers to a total of twenty-six varying types of large river rocks. All instances are fully sentient and capable of vocal communication despite lacking mouths. All instances speak in an identical, loud, high-pitched voice. Each instance bares a pair of large googly eyes, which despite appearing non-anomalous, allow instances to visually perceive their surroundings. All instances of SCP-ROCKS-J are capable of minor telekinesis which they use to move. Instances are unable to use their abilities on any life forms or objects other than themselves.\n\nInstances of SCP-ROCKS-J have been designated SCP-ROCKS-J-A to Z.\n\nSCP-ROCKS-J are considered non-threatening to Foundation staff. Instances show a low level of intelligence and lack the ability to pay attention to one specific subject for even short amounts of time and on occasion experience severe memory loss. With instances often forgetting personnel and previously learned information.\n\nSCP-ROCKS-J was discovered in ██████ river located in █████, England. Instances at the time of discovery were attempting to communicate with a nearby pigeon. This ended with an instance of SCP-ROCKS-J having apparently become ‘inspired’, and proceed to perform a rap about pigeons [[footnote]]Lyrics consisted of: \"Pigeons, pigeons, vermin of the street, pigeons, pigeons, they're really neat.\"[[/footnote]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview ROCKS-J-1\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n> **Interview ROCKS-J-1**\n> **Subjects:** SCP-ROCKS-J\n> \n> **Begin Log**\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** Hi!\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** Good evening, I’m doctor Agnew.\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** We’re rocks!\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** Indeed you are!

I was hoping a few of you could share some useful information regarding your origins or biology? \n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** It shall be me! I speak for the rocks.\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-B:** No you don’t! Speak for yourself, Arnold!\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** Shut it Bob. You lost the right to speak up in the last rock committee meeting!\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-B:** See! This is exactly what i was talking about! I was sick of you incessantly putting the word ‘rock’ in front of everything we do!\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** It’s an important wording choice! The world needs to know that we are rocks and proud!\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-B:** They do not! They can plainly see that we are rocks just by looking at us! And also ones with big glorious eyes on them!\n> \n> (//SCP-ROCKS-J-B turns to Dr. Agnew and begins shaking intensely for several seconds, causing its googly eyes to shake rapidly.//)\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-B:** You see!?\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** Um… I certainly do.\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-B:** See!? he gets it!

That joke works neither as a humorous line or as one that makes sense!\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-A:** That is the last outburst you’ll make!\n> \n> (//SCP-ROCKS-J-A and B levitate several centimeters off the ground and begin to repeatedly tap into each another using their telekinetic abilities. Dr. Agnew stares in disbelief for roughly thirty seconds before interfering.//)\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** Ok let’s just- Look just calm down alright? there’s no nee-\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-C:** He separated Arnold and Bob!

I’m done!\n> \n> (//Dr. Agnew retreats from the interview room.//)\n> \n> **<End Log>** \n> \n> **Post interview report:** Upon leaving the interview room, SCP-ROCKS-J continued to vocalise the word ‘hail’ for the following ten minutes. SCP-ROCKS-J eventually ceased this behaviour, apparently forgetting what they had been doing. Following this, instances appeared to have a discussion regarding the hierarchy of their group. This later ended with instances organising a hierarchy amongst themselves consisting of royal titles of various continents, all of which were altered to feature the word ‘rock’ or a type of rock.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview ROCKS-J-2\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n> **Interview ROCKS-J-2**\n> **Subjects:** SCP-ROCKS-J\n> \n> **Begin Log**\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** Hello again SCP-ROCKS-J.\n> \n> **SCP-ROCKS-J-C:** Have we met?\n> \n> **Dr. Agnew:** You don’t recall? we… never mind that.
