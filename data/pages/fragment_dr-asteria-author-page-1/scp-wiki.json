SCP-NOVA is to be continuously monitored by Foundation observatories and satellites. Any changes in behavior are to be reported to the O5 Council immediately.\n\n**Description:** SCP-NOVA is a number of man-made structures on a free-floating planetary-mass object, or rogue planet, currently 968 light-years from Earth in the Aphrodite nebula (07^^h^^ 38^^m^^ 11.24^^s^^ +45° 27' 30.2\"). The rogue planet has been designated by civilian astronomers as \"WISE 073810.77+452730.5\". SCP-NOVA, apparently, is Foundation Extraterrestrial Site-26, containing several anomalies and documents. No records of Ex. Site-26 have been found before 03/11/2019, and the circumstances of its creation are unknown. Additionally, Ex. Site-26 seems to create the anomalies it contains as there is a correlation between the creation of several objects' designations in SCiPNet and their immediate containment at Ex. Site-26.\n\nEx. Site-26 has only one staff member, Founder and Director Dr. Aphroditus Asteria. Dir. Asteria is theorized to be an immortal Level V Reality Bender, able to create objects and the facilities for their containment. Depictions of her have also been found from as far back as Ancient Greece. The nature of her continued survival, solo operation of Ex. Site-26, and employment with the Foundation is unknown.\n\n**Addendum NOVA.1:** Discovery\n\nOn 24/10/2021, several edits to [[[SCP-6113]]]'s slot from then unknown Ex. Site-26 were recorded by RAISA. RAISA immediately notified the O5 Council, and the page was locked and access permissions for Ex. Site-26 were revoked. The creation of the page coincided with the anomaly's discovery by the Foundation. An investigation into the facility's origin revealed two full dossiers on Ex. Site-26 and its director, written on 03/11/2019. Both were written by Site-06-3 Level 1 Assistant Researcher Dr. Aphroditus Asteria, who went missing the same date.\n\nAfter several days of deliberation, the Overseer Council unanimously voted to allow Ex. Site-26 to continue operating. The page was unlocked and permissions reinstated, and a communication attempt with Ex. Site-26 was made, with O5-1 speaking. Despite the communiqué's theoretical travel time of approximately 968 years, communication with the site was made near-instantaneously. All further messages have a delay of approximately 3 seconds. Below is a transcript of the ensuing exchange.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**O5-1:** This is the Overseer Council from Site-01, O5-1 speaking. We have noticed your containment of SCP-6113. To whom am I speaking to?\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** Greetings, this is Dir. Aphroditus Asteria of Extraterrestrial Site-26.\n\n**O5-1:** Hello, Dir. Asteria. Unfortunately, we have no record of an Ex. Site-26. When were you employed, and when was your site built?\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** Hm, well, I was employed with the Foundation on October 28, 2019. Then, I was transferred to Ex. Site-26 to aid in construction and later made its site director.\n\n(The Overseer Council deliberate amongst themselves for several moments.)\n\n**O5-1:** I'm sorry, did you say you //built// the site?\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** Wh— yes? I was ordered to go to WISE 0738+4527 and help build the site!\n\n**O5-1:** Dir. Asteria, if I may, we have no idea how you got to that exoplanet in six days or how you obtained the technology and manpower to build an extraterrestrial site in one day. Its the first of its kind! How many staff are there with you?\n\n**Dir. Astiera:** It's just me.\n\n**O5-1:** //Just// you?\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** Yes, it's just me up here. I don't see a problem with that.\n\n(The Overseer Council deliberate for several more moments.)\n\n**O5-1:** None of this seems... off to you?\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** Absolutely not! And, I take offense that you would even elude to such a thing. I am a loyal employee of the Foundation, and I am fulfilling my duties as such perfectly!\n\n**O5-1:** Regardless, we have chosen to allow you to continue operating. Any and all anomalies and documents under your jurisdiction will be //exclusively// your responsibility. You are very unlikely to receive aid from us on Earth if something were to go wrong.\n\n**Dir. Asteria:** That is fine by me!\n\n**O5-1:** We will stay in touch, then. Good luck out there, Dir. Asteria.\n[[/div]]\n\nCurrently, Dir. Asteria very rarely makes contact with Earthside Foundation personnel, if ever.",
