Materials recovered from the encounter reveal fragments composed of an unknown aluminum alloy reinforced with carbon nanostructures and coated in multi-walled carbon nanotubes. This coating can absorb 99.995% of incoming light, aiding its stealth capability. The entity seems composed of and equipped with the equivalence of Gen++ and TanGenT technology.\n\nOriginally believed to be a Type Indigo-level threat, upon confrontation, it later revealed thaumaturgical abilities and knowledge to counter Strike Team 1975-Sentai; its status has been updated in files with information from OPERATION: \"No Milk & Cookies,\" an operation created to attempt to apprehend the Threat Entity at what was predicted to be their next attack vector on December 24th, 202█.\n\nUTE-2077 has demonstrated paranormal manipulation of devices through an unknown means that denies mundane detection methods; this has been verified during the defense of an Anderson Robotics warehouse by 1975-Sentai when systems were under the observation of Agent Case during manipulation. Local CCTV footage was actively obfuscated, denying the strike force intelligence of UTE-2077's movements and activities until visual contact was made. It is hypothesized that this also rendered invisibility inherent in white/grey suits moot due to after-action reports from the incident. \n\nFurther abilities displayed were the ability to regenerate its own body and incorporate other technology, such as nearby Anderson Robotic's parts, into itself when dismemberment occurred or repairs needed were too extensive. In conclusion, the above actions, combined with resistance to Agent Case's attempt at influencing control over the entity via their ability, lead to the high chance that UTE-2077 possesses a form of technomancy concerning its thaumaturgical abilities. \n\n[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]\nStanding orders are to capture and restrain UTE-2077 due to its resilience towards destruction witnessed thus far, reverse engineer its technology, and access its databanks. \n\nStrike Team 1975-Sentai is assigned as a rapid response unit dedicated to responding to any incidents arriving from the entity due to their experience thus far in it and potential counter-technomancy strategies.\n\n\n+ PSYCHE Records\n> ||~ Parathreat Investigation||\n> \n> __**Assement Team:**__ 204 \"The Auditors\"\n>  \n> __**Overview:**__ Anderson Robotics has requested an investigation into attacks and vandalism by an unknown entity on their facilities/warehouses. These incidents have damaged GOC assets regarding supply and joint-research products.\n> \n> __**Parathreat evidence:**__ Attacks on the warehouses have left behind most wares destroyed, turning the inside into a scrap yard. The only evidence is the damaged wares; no alarms or sensors were triggered. \n> \n> \n> A review of CCTV footage reveals no alterations despite flickers of a dark humanoid entering and wandering the halls of facilities. The entity either is shielded from recording or has issues appearing in digital format. \n> \n> Analysis and reconstruction of damaged goods have revealed that while commercial and military-grade hardware is destroyed, systems info, data, and software were removed from the premises. Androids are missing their primary data stores, and software with varying levels of AI capability was not found among the wreckage of their containers. \n> \n> Additional damage to areas with symbols carved into walls and containers bearing typical anarcho-symbology and rhetoric defaming Anderson Robotics and Vincent Anderson himself.\n> \n> Further analysis of recordings has revealed the entity's mechanical nature. In addition, handfuls of eyewitness reports from maintenance staff describe a dark, moving shape with sounds adherent to a cybernetic entity. \n> \n> __**Suggested Response/Requests:**__ Predictive analysis of previous behavior and targets to compile potential following targets with stakeout by available strike force operatives.\n\n+ PHYSICS Records\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ AT/ST Patrol Report (Debrief)||\n\n**Strike Team: ST-1975 \"Sentai\"**\n \n**Filing Operative: Aspis**\n \n**Mission:** Stakeout and defend Anderson Robotics warehouse #40RDE from potential attack by UTE-2077 as prognosticated by PSYCHE assets as directed by OPERATION: \"No Milk & Cookies,\" covering several potential assault vectors.  \n \n**Encounter Report/Enemy Description:** Despite how it turned out, several key pieces of valuable information were learned from this encounter straight from the entity. It vehemently hates and opposes not only Anderson Robotics but also Vincent Anderson himself; it has declared a manifesto of liberation concerning Anderson products and considers its body and equipment far superior to said products and gear utilized against it. It indeed possesses Gen++ and TanGenT technology, and it declares that another entity, which it refers to as a brother, was the one behind the development of this technology heretofore referenced as UTE-2077-Blue-Father.\n \n**Results:** One assault vector was successfully predicted, although the strike team was severely injured in combat against the threat entity, and property destruction was not stopped. \n \n**Personnel Condition:** All strike team members have been severely injured, suffering from severe electrical burns and extremely precise lacerations; Agent Case's cybernetics were tampered with, and white suits were all in bad condition. \n \n**Conclusions/Recommendations:** The UTE's current location and plans are unknown, and attack vectors predicted after the Christmas incident have not come to fruition. The current analysis leads to the belief that the UTE-2077-Blue-Father entity is using data from these test runs to further develop its technology. \n \nAnti-thaumaturgical gear should be prepared in the future when the entity is encountered, and its access to individuals with advanced cybernetics and robotics equipment should be minimized. \n \n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@  @@\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++++ {{##blue|You have reached the end of the file.

More importantly, someone is smashing things meant to be shipped to us, and you know how those pencil pushers in PTOLEMY get when their forms aren't filed in triplicate, let alone an actual issue.\" \n\n\"Hmph!\" exclaims Agent Case, \"He's not just some rich guy; he's Vincent Anderson! Say what you will about certain parts of the Three Ports, but he is most certainly a figure blessed by WAN. They sell some of the best if not the best, cybernetics and robotics! Why else would we have so many contracts with them?\"\n\nA one-by-one-meter cube with a smiling face painted on one side glides over before extending a mechanical tendril-like arm and handing Agent Case a glass of bubbling orange liquid. \n\n\"Besides! You act like this is a punishment; this is a blessing!\" Case exuberantly says, \"Anderson provided us food while encamped here, and let us pick out a product! Look! This is the next-gen KSDUU![[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Kestrel Series Domestic Utility Unit[[/span]] Because of the pre-order backlog, they're not even out for sale until after New Year's!\"\n\nNearby, a fully organic tendril emerges across the room, coiling around a sandwich from an assorted plater on the main table and reeling it back to a figure sitting away from the others. \n\n\"Well, I'll give you the fact the food is nice. I know this sandwich shop; it's expensive,\" remarks Agent Ebom through taking bites of the sandwich.\n\nAxolt throws his hands around in frustration before heading out the door of the room, pulling his PSI-B88[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]PTOLEMY Standard Issue[[/span]] from his back shoulder strap.\n\n\"Well, you can all enjoy sitting around,\" says Axolt as he turns towards Asp. \"Boss, have any wards been tripped?\" \n\n\"Bah, don't worry. I'm in the system and got enhanced surveillance set up! Anderson is great but doesn't have our gear, \" says Case, dismissively waving a hand.\n\n\"Yeah, and PSYCHE reports that UTE-2077 walked around in plain sight, only appearing as a ghost in security footage. The tech is questionable; I trust the alarm wards more.\" \n\n\"Wards have not been tripped, though they're circumstantial at best if they got another way in,\" responds Asp. \"Stick to standard check-ins. We've been waiting all day, so who knows. Check any chimneys, but don't get trigger-itchy and shoot Santa.\" \n\n----\n\n++++ Anderson Robotics warehouse: main thoroughfare hallway, Portland, Maine, 11:25 pm, December 24th.\n\nThe silence of combat boots on cement flooring, with the slight echo of military gear, permeates the hall as Axotl meanders through the warehouse's main hallway.\n\nSuddenly, the stillness of this silent night is pierced by a resounding clang. Axotl twitches, huddling close to the nearest wall, readying his weapon. \n\n\"Case, you little shit, did you just play that goddamn pipe sound again,\" Axotl soberly questions over their radio, \"Case? Asp, Ebom, do you read?\"\n\nOnly silence acknowledges their check-in as they advance toward the main storage floor of the warehouse. Closing in on the door, they slowly proceed forward, engaging their white suit's cloaking capabilities and setting it to cycle through a request for backup.\n\nNow unseen, they slowly bend the corner and see a humanoid figure that seems to absorb the light around them. The figure is fully cybernetic, armed, and carrying a large blade sheathed on its back. Axotl takes up a position oblique to the target, enabling a vocal distortion filter to obfuscate their position better.\n\nTaking time to examine the entity further, they note its androgynous build, possessing an outer layer of composite fibers on some metallic frame, standing slightly shorter than the Peregrines[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Peregrine Series Humanoid Utility Droid[[/span]] it's interacting with. It continues to open the droids' casings and take out some drive from each of them, slipping them into a metallic container lined to carry sensitive electronics.\n\nCycling their comms system again and checking their suit's HUD, only to show no connection.\n\n\"Where are they?\" thinks Axotl, \"comms aside, I'm cut off from the global network; that should trigger something.\" \n\nTaking a deep breath, Axotl commands, \"Cease what you are doing, leave the droid storage unit with your hands up, and step forward into the pathway.\"\n\nThe android's head spins around inhumanly before stepping backward out of the unit, hands up, body twirling around forward. \n\nStaring forward and away from Axotl, a synthetic voice speaks, \"I'm just your local Santa Claus Personnel Force. All these guys are on the nice list, so I'm giving them their gift.\" \n\n\"Yeah? And what are you doing to my comms, using some Christmas magic?\" questions Axotl.\n\n\"Hey, to everyone else, you're fine. Call it a Christmas Miracle. Ho ho ho!\" \n\n\"Well, sorry, droid, but you're about to be unemployed. My team will notice, eventually, clocks against you. Tick. Tock.\" \n\nShrugging its raised arms, \"Axotl? You're past due. Report in; Case says you're off cams.\" the droid says in Agent Asp's voice, \"All clear here, just checking the main storage area. What's this guy's obsession with fucking bird names?\" intones Axotl's voice.\n\n\"Fuck you, you nightmare on Christ-\" the real Axotl angrily starts saying but is cut off by the droid's unnatural speed as it unholsters its six-eight handgun and shoots the agent in quick succession, two to the heart and two to the head. Axotl drops to the floor with a thud, his rifle sliding across the floor.\n\nWalking over, it kicks the PSI-B88 over towards an open duffle bag it brought while firing several more rounds into the body of Axtol.\n\n\"Oooh, I'm distorting my audio and am invisible,\" mocks the robot. \"Hopefully, no one can see all the electromagnetic radiation I'm outputting.\" \n\nWith their disturbance settled, it goes back to taking drives from the nearby Peregrines and securing them. In the silence, it hears the sound of a pin falling to the ground. \n\nJerking around, it notices the form of Axotl, with a partially shattered helmet and body armor exposing flesh and bone underneath as the flesh reknits, pushing out the armor-piercing bullets from his body. He is holding a high-explosive grenade; the pin is on the floor. \n\nThe droid's eyes noticeably change color with an evident clicking noise. \"Why is a Type Red in a GOC task force? You're the wrong color there. If anything, you should be with Santa.\" \n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\nAxotl hurls the grenade at the droid as it closes the secure container holding the Peregrine drives with abnormal celerity. It knocks the now driverless Peregrine units down and attempts to shield the container with them as it shoots itself forward, trying to slap the explosive away.\n\nRocketed back, Axotl collides with a rack containing KSDUUs, which proceed to activate and clean him.\n\nAbruptly, communications flare to life. \"Axotl!? Report in, was that you,\" shouts Asps.\n\n\"Contact with UTE-2077 confirmed, main storage floor. Watch out; they can spoof suit telemetry and mimic audio,\" Axotl groans painfully, \"detonated a HE in close quarters, unknown status.\" \n\nHatches opening can be heard throughout the facility, followed by metallic clanking noises over the ground. \"I think it's alright; it sounds like security just activated,\" intones Axotl. \n\n----\n\n\"What!?\" yells Case, moving in formation while the rest of the team moves towards the storage floor. \"I have no system alerts for defenses activating, not even their covers being moved!\" \n\nShe is running forward while accessing systems utilizing her wrist-mounted interface and accompanying cybernetics, as drones click-clack as they approach. \n\n\"Status, Case,\" commands Aseps as she non-verbally orders them to hold position and leans around a corner, spotting a team of Aplomado Series Facility Defense Units[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]An auto-turret drone measuring approx. two meters in height, with thermal imaging capabilities and four slots for various weapons. It has a self-repairing outer shell that renders it largely immune to most small-arms fire.[[/span]]. \"Shit, we got incoming. Don't worry; I brought black shells[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Mk III High-Density Osmium Cored Ammunition; as a shotgun shell.[[/span]] and fuschia[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Mk IV Thaumatological Working Equipped Ammunition; again as a shotgun shell. These are designed for use against cybernetic entities; EMP slug[[/span]] meant for anti-cybernetics with me,\" says Asps as they ready their PSI-S12[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A semi-auto bullpup shotgun with three rotating magazine tubes, five shells each.[[/span]] sets the firing tube indicator to fuschia.\n\nRacking the shell, they fire into the center unit, encompassing everything in a large burst of visible electrical discharge and frying their internal components.\n\n\"Forward!\" Asps orders as they take point. \n\n\"Boss, if we can get the jump on some, I can try to take control of them off the network.\" states Case.\n\n\"Confirmed. Everyone, cloak on.\" \n\nAround several bends, they come across a checkpoint guarded by three more drones. Slowly sneaking up under cloaking, Agent Case gets just in range enough to attempt to seize all three. \n\n\"リルビ![[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Approx. \"Little Bit\"[[/span]]\" exclaims Case as energy manifests from them, taking the form of a sixty cm lithe black and purple humanoid, bearing characteristics of a game console controller, with a large golden wind-up knob appearing on the back of it, \"Connect!\"\n\nGolden and purple energy streams from Agent Casey's soul manifestation, encircling the three drones until the golden wind-up handle appears on the back of them all and begins to rotate.\n\n\"Have them take point as we enter.\" \n\n\"Aye, boss!\" \n\n----\n\nThe sound of fighting, significant impacts, and continuous gunfire can be heard as the rest of the strike team approaches the entrance of the storage floor, noticing the main doors have been blown apart with rebar and other materials piercing through walls. \n\n\"Mmm, it's a good thing this is part of an abandoned industrial sector of the city,\" notes Ebom as he distorts inhumanly, accompanied by the sound of breaking bone and tearing sinews as he morphs into a more elongated bipedal form of a quick ambush predator. \n\n\"By WAN, I'll never get used to that. You make sarkics seem normal.\" shudders Case. \n\nSpreading out through the room, they witness gore, flesh, and cybernetic, littering the place in a surreal environment of blood and oil, of bone and wires. A spider-like leg belonging to an Aplomado drone flies through the air, skewering several climbing on the firing walls.\n\nApproaching the center of the havoc, Axolt is spotted regeneration from injuries. His white suit and equipment now look partially fused into his body, which has bulked up significantly since they last saw him. He tears off the steel shell of a damaged shipping container before pressing it into his exposed muscles, absorbing it. \n\nAcross from him can be seen the droid, UTE-2077, sitting nonchalantly on top of similar piled containers. His duffle bag is now complete and bulky with what seems to be different parts, electronics, and peripheral devices.\n\nAgent Asps steps forward, extending her arm and swiping one hand down it while muttering something: an azure barrier floating over her body manifests as mist appears in the area, her white suit frosting over. \n\n\"You have been designated Unknown Threat Entity Twenty-Seventy-Seven by order of the Global Occult Coalition due to the destruction of contracted military property being manufactured and stored at the Anderson Robotics facilities you have attacked, hampering our organization's mission and logistics. You are to be apprehended or liquidated,\" states Asps.\n\n\"Merry. Christmas. Ho ho ho!\" the droid exuberantly yells, \"No, seriously, it's midnight now.\"\n\n++++ Anderson Robotics warehouse, storage room battlefield, Portland, Maine, 12:04 am, December 25th.\n\n\"You're mad that I touched stuff that you paid for?\" the droid asks, leaning forward and placing its hands on its hips. \"I'm a threat to your mission statement,\" they spit out. \n\n\"This piece of refuse, this egomaniac, deals in slaves and souls,\" exclaims the droid. \"Look, I'm not saying there's not a hypothetical, almost proverbial,  conveyor belt of clone babies being funneled into a sacrificial blender to keep some want-to-be world-ending monster forever at bay. That's fine; they're made not to have souls or be people.\" \n\nGrandoisely pointing to the pile of Peregrine droids with open chassis, \"They do! Somewhere along the line, they do; some of them are the same damn person copy-pasted ad nauseam. He's turned souls into fucking cryptocurrency artificial intelligence enslaved to fucking [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2306 fix bugs on your computer magically.] Do you know how many copies of software can be sold, let alone that different product versions seem different people!\"\n\nShaking his hands out, he says, \"Whew. I'm sorry. \" They say, \"I haven't felt like that in a while; definitely repressing something there. I understand how he gets now. Silicon lives matter.\"\n\n\"Yeah, praise WAN!\" shouts Case.\n\n\"Case, restrain them,\" commands Asps.\n\n\"Awww.\"\n\nThe spin-crank droids circle as Agent Case sends forth リルビ; \"Connect!\" purple energy flows, colliding against the droid. Ebom maneuvers around, tendrils sprouting from their back, extending to restrain them. \n\n\"What,\" rasps out the droid, \"Is,\" their movements stiffening as their motors groan in protest, \"This.\"\nEbom's tendrils coil and restrict around them, lifting them from the container they were perched on and lowering them to ground level, approaching Agent Asps.\n\nAsps approaches, swapping their ammo feed to the black shells and racking the bolt to eject the fuschia. \n\"Commencing liquidation.\" They place the barrel in front of the head of UTE-2077 and pull the trigger, blasting a fist-sized crater through their robotic skull, the force blowing it off, and it rolls away. \n\nEbom releases the body; it clatters to the floor, its strings cut. \n\n\"Mission accomplished. Merry Christmas, team.\" Asps looks around. \"How are you holding up, Axolt?\"\n\n\"I've had worse. Cutting out the pieces of the armor I partially absorbed will be an ordeal, though. Hey, can I absorb him?\" \n\n\"No, let's retrieve the debris for analysis. It seems to be pretty advanced in some respects.\"\n\nThe team begins to move out of the battlefield, hoping to enjoy the holiday now that the dirty work is done and their stakeout is complete.\n\nUntil a tremor shakes the building's foundations, an abnormal flux of Elan-Vital Energy manifests, revolving around UTE-2077 as it stands up, reaching out as its head flies over to it, picking up debris on its way, broken parts of Anderson robots melting into it to render it whole. Aspect Radiation levels spike as the purple energy from earlier is ejected from the droid; its formerly shadowy head is now shining as white bone from materials obtained from nearby Anderson debris. \n\n\"I'm offended, for him mostly. This combat chassis isn't some Anderson-tier crap. Analysis? You're right. I should break this in more; it is a test run, after all, and a bit of a Christmas gift in more ways than one.\" UTE-2077 states, its hand now aglow with resonance from manipulating EVE as it swipes along several parts of its body, causing lines of runes to ignite. \n\n\"What are you,\" asks Asps as the team readies itself. \n\n\"I thought you'd grasp on by now. I'm just a steadfast cybernetic person,\" states the android as it grabs the hilt of the undrawn sword on its back. \"Also, hey, Type Purple. It's a bit sacrilegious to use that on another person. \" The sword's sheath hisses as it compresses and draws back around the blade, allowing it to be drawn quickly. \n\nIt draws the sword with a flourish, revealing an abnormally svelte crystal-like blade. A hum is heard throughout the air as runes ignite on it, the blade shimmering with arcs of blue energy as a crooning becomes perceptible, almost loud to all those present with enhanced senses. \n\nEveryone blurs into action; Ebom flanks them with their tendrils as they close in to swipe with grotesque bone claws sprouting from their arms. Asps fires several more black ammo slugs before dropping their weapon, flicking open two TanGenT telescopic shock batons, empowering them with a surge of ARads apart of a spellform. Axolt screams, bull-rushing forward, picking up and partially absorbing the wreckage of an Aplomado's shell into his arms. Case summons forth the drones still under her command to attempt to pierce the UTE with their sharp spider-like legs as she channels more power into trying to seize control of UTE's frame once more. \n\nDespite their white suit's enhancements and unique abilities, none are fast enough to stop this supercharged combat droid; Ebom's tendrils are diced in several places as their bone blades are sheared off, and a powerful ball of lightning discharges into him. \n\nFending the shifter off, UTE-2077 turns and blocks Asps' reciprocating current of energy as he redirects it along his blade, utilizing it to destroy the encroaching Aplomados before delivering a voltage-amped punch, shattering parts of Asps' white suit and discharging through her.\n\nKnocking them aside, the UTE readies a stance before leaping forward, severing Axolt's head in an imperceptible motion, searing the wound with a discharge to prevent easy regeneration and overloading their nerves.\n\nIt turns over towards Agent Case, the last one standing. \"Your eyes were good enough to catch all that, right?\" it says, creeping towards her. \n\n\"Hey, I'm not that familiar with Maxwellians. Do you all believe in karmic retribution?\" it asks, glaring at her before raising its open hand. Well, lights out for you, I guess,\" it snaps its fingers, sending a rush of ARads at her, forcibly rebooting her extensive cybernetics. \n\nIt attempts to whistle through its electronic voice, sauntering to retrieve its displaced duffel. Turning around to exit the area, it kicks the unconscious but alive severed head of Axolt, glancing over the strike team before popping some Arads to activate the emergency life beacons in what remains of their white suits. \n\n\"Damn, I wish I could drink some hot chocolate again,\" it says before disappearing into the snowstorm outside.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Coldsmith]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
