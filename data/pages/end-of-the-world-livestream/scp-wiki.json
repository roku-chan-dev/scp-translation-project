Doesn't matter if I doxx myself if we're all gonna die, heh. Noone in the chat yet?\n\n**prestooge:** hi. whatre you doing\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Ah, hey prestooge! Well, uh, I know I got a bit full of myself in my post. But I'm gonna try and-- uh, one second, still getting set up...\n\n//Camera feed turns on, showing a shelf full of different pesticides.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I have these. So... I'm gonna go out with a bang. I'm not the most committed to living anyways.\n\n**prestooge:** theyre immune\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Yeah. To most of these, actually. But they must have //some// effect. And I can't just do nothing. I've got to entertain you guys too. Least until... well.\n\n//The camera is bought towards a window, showing a swarm of locusts in the sky.//\n\n**prestooge:** oh. well\n\n**prestooge:** what if...\n\n**prestooge:** https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Flamethrower\n\n**prestooge:** :)\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Haha, that's a great idea! Wikihow, comin' in clutch! //(He pans the camera across his workshop.)// I don't think I have anything for those fancy ones in here though, my mom just liked gardening. But I do have a lighter, could do that thing you always see in TV where they hold it up to the spray...\n\n**prestooge:** thatd be easier yeah\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Jesus, its the end of the world and you choose //this// garbage platform for your final livestream?\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Hey soul! Damn, already getting more folks than I expected. Thought you'd all be dead. And, uh, I'm only using this 'garbage' because the other platforms are down. Bugs must've gotten to the servers or something.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Touch√©.\n\n**prestooge:** we are making flamethrower\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Heh, nice. I saw a bunch of military people mowing down the lo-shits with guns earlier. Pretty stupid.\n\n**prestooge:** bullet too small\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## That doesn't seem smart, yeah. Also, lo-shits? Heh, I'm stealing that one.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Yep. The, uh, Ravaging of the Lo-shits.\n\n**prestooge:** or god skipped to the eighth plague. and the world is egypt\n\n//Camera is bought towards a drawer, which Phillips begins to dig around in.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Y'know, you've gotten me thinking, what even //caused// this?\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Ever heard of the Gaia theory?\n\n**prestooge:** mother nature got mad?\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## In simple terms, yeah. It's basically that Earth itself is self-regulating, and I think, well, we got too shitty to fix.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## So we need a reset.\n\n**prestooge:** weird\n\n//Phillips removes a black zippo from the drawer and flicks it open, giving it a spark. The flame lights up.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Well, the hardest part is done!\n\n//Camera pans back to the shelf of pesticides.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## One of these must work.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## ...I think hair spray would be your best bet, friend.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Too late for that. I'm not going outside, not until I'm ready.\n\n**prestooge:** poisoning is better than getting eaten by locusts imo\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I guess.\n\n//Phillips grabs a yellow can of pesticide and sets the camera down. Holding the flame up to the spray, he presses down on the nozzle, and the spray catching fire. He quickly stops.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Woohoo! We got it!\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## You wanna use this against the locusts, right? Sure it's gonna work?\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Not sure at all. But I'm ready to die trying.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I'm afraid to die.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I... I kind of agree. But if everyone else is... what can I do? My life isn't that good anyways.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Hm. Hey, do you think there are rich people in fancy apocalypse bunkers? What if, in the future, some fuckin Fallout protagonist emerges after all the locusts die off? That'd be cool.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## Yeah, yeah. It's kind of unfair, though.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## How?\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## We're gonna die. For no reason. We didn't do anything. But nobody is gonna help us live. You know what I think? That LARPA is like, some secret organization. And they knew this was coming.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I think we talked about that on the Parawatch forums, yeah.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## And we're completely in the blank. Ugh... Hey, uh, prestooge? You still around?\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## He's not on the userlist.\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## ...screw this. //(He sighs.)// Goodbye, soul.\n\n##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Goodbye...\n\n//Phillips walks over to a door, which he pulls open. Stepping outside, he looks up to see a swarm of locusts covering the sky. A part of the swarm begins to fly towards him as he drops the camera.//\n\n##green|**Phillips (VO):**## I'm ready for ya!\n\n//Phillips starts up his makeshift flamethrower, shooting it towards the swarm. Locusts burn up in the air before they quickly surround Phillips, who screams in agony. A few minutes later, his body is completely gone.//\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I can't go out like this.\n\n//Minutes pass. The camera is eventually covered by dust.//\n\n**prestooge:** im back sorry i had to go and help my mom get my grandparents into our bunker and\n\n**prestooge:** oh\n\n**prestooge:** f\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Fuckin //really//, dude?\n\n**prestooge:** sorry if f was disrespectful\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## I... I don't even know what to do at this point.\n\n**prestooge:** :(\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Hey, prestooge?\n\n**prestooge:** yes?\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## If you ever come out of that bunker after all this and like, rebuild society, or whatever, please remember me.\n\n**prestooge:** i will\n\n ##E315C2|**soulcolor:**## Thank you. Goodbye.\n\n**prestooge:** bye soul\n\n[[=]]\n++ Network Error\n++ Lost server connection, please reconnect.\n+++++ (Error Code: 500)\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n**|[[[arbh-class-hub|Hub]]]|**\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** end-of-the-world.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Ellie3]], Hotel Kaesong\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/end-of-the-world-livestream SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> **Name:** Locust Swarm\n> **Author:** Hotel Kaesong\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/laika_ac/29211062025 Flickr]\n\n> **Name:** SVG > display music portable movies\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://svgsilh.com/image/468292.html SVGsilh]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
