A synchronised waltz of construction and destruction, of enlightenment and credo. Do you hear the harmony of rhetoric and reason? Does it near make you weep to witness the artisanal craft of persuasion? The [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/debate-club-contest Debate Club Contest] beckons, scholars.\n\nThe Contest is centred around the theme \"Common VS Rare\" in its many interpretations. Does the universe reach its zenith at the atypical, or the quotidian? Do you value that found once a lifetime, or that found by all? Registrations for the Contest are closed, but observers can still contend for the Critic's Choice Award by commenting substantially on more than half of all entries, equally distributed among both teams. Remember, it's not a debate without a response!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By StrangerSwing//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Features Last Month\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Top Articles of the Month\n[[/=]]\n\nRatings of course do not mean everything, but they are representative of what people happened to like seeing at the time.
