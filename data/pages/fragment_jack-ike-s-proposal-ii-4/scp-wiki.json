SCP-001-A was constructed by SCP-001-1.\n\nSCP-001-1 is immortal, and does not age. Although SCP-001-1 can be physically damaged and will heal at an appropriate rate for a mundane human, its longevity enables it to recover from more severe injuries if given sufficient time to do so.\n\nSCP-001-1 vocally supports the containment and analysis of anomalous phenomena, and is largely compliant in its own containment.\n\nSCP-001-A is capable of producing detailed predictions of all possible outcomes for an input event. As SCP-001-A also considers the impact its predictions will have on the outcome of the event, it is assured that at least one outcome produced by SCP-001-A will occur.\n\nWhenever SCP-001-1 and/or SCP-001-A are involved with an event beyond exclusively providing predictions on its outcomes, SCP-001-A will typically produce a significant number of blatantly incorrect predictions based upon one of the following false factors:\n# That SCP-001-1 was allegedly assassinated by a military group prior to containment, and as a result, SCP-001-A was never constructed;\n# That, along with its standard anomalous properties, SCP-001-1 also exhibits SCP-001-Aâ€™s anomalous properties, and that SCP-001-A was never constructed.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #808080; background:#000000; color:#00FF00; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" class=\"customlink\"]]\nError: Multiple files found!
