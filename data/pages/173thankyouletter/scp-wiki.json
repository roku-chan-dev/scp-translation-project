It is incredible that a little poorly spelled and inconsistent 4chan post led us down the route that ended up with almost 7,000 SCP articles and thousands of other pages like tales, formats, art, and so forth. We have a vibrant community of writers, readers, and artists on the site as well as an incredible group of artists, content creators, and fans outside of the Wiki. So many people have been able to obtain enjoyment and entertainment by viewing or contributing to content on and off the site and it is truly a blessing to see where such a wonderful and passionate community can take us! I know that I am incredibly thankful for the experience I have received from the Wiki and the people I have been able to interact with who love it as much as I do. We have a rich history and an untold future that is bound to be flooded with creativity the likes of which the world has never seen. Thank you, SCP, and happy birthday, 173!\n\n[[>]]\n~ [[*user WhiteGuard]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n\nBelow are the staff responses to the question, //\"What are you thankful for concerning SCP?\"// After reading them, we would like to hear what **YOU** are thankful for concerning SCP.

I'm thankful to INT in particular for giving me a place where I can practice my translating from multiple languages.\nAbove all else, however, I'm deeply thankful for the people I've met and friendships I've gotten to build during my time on INT. That community helped me get through some of the most difficult chapters of my life, and I will always fondly remember them and the times we had even long after I'm no longer active in the community.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Nederbird]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki Unofficial Nordic and Hungary Branches//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm incredibly thankful for the friends I've made and the experiences I've had here that I could not in any other community.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Yossipossi]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\"I am thankful for all the wonderful readers and reviewers I've worked with and seen helping authors in the community!

You are the next generation of SCP, and I am so happy that as staff I get to help shape your first introduction to SCP, and watch you grow and learn to love this fandom as much as us veteran members do. Without the fanbase, our community would be nothing, and I am thankful for the fact I get to be the bridge between the two. Keep on making those OCs, drawings, practice SCP drafts, whatever it is, I'm cheering for you!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am grateful for all the people I've impacted and impacted me in turn, and the opportunity to get invaluable feedback on my writing.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user LORDXVNV]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm super grateful for the community that has been built, for the friends I've made along the way, for the creativity on display, for the spirit of collaboration we have all had a part in sharing, and for the talent that has filled me with wonder time and again. Long live Peanut!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Lt Flops]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm thankful of the SCP Wiki for the community that it provides.

It's been an honor to contribute to the nuttiest of all writing sites, and may this continue for yet another 15 years!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user EstrellaYoshte]], //Moderator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'll never forget reading down old Series 1, that night at 2 am in the middle of 2010. The fiction that grew from a throwaway creepypasta in a shithole corner of the internet has become a thriving, evolving juggernaut of communities on a global level. I wouldn't be the same person without meeting my friends and colleagues here. The power in this site is undeniable, and for better or for worse, I wouldn't trade a moment of the last 12 years away for anything.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Dexanote]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am thankful for the opportunity to have contributed to something so massive and dynamic as the SCP Wiki, as well as having a chance to create my own little corner of the mythos.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Jacob Conwell]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm so grateful to have been exposed to such a wide variety of people from all over. I've made great friends and learned so much that I wouldn't have otherwise known. My life has truly been improved by my friends here.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user LadyKatie]], //Moderator and Administrator for the SCP Wiki English and International Branches//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nGod, I don't even know where to start. As someone who's always struggled socially, the SCP Wiki really allowed me to meet new people and socialize; this is where I found some of my closest friends, and it has allowed me to get through a pretty dark time in my life. Moreover, a lot of my growth as an individual (maturity, learning, growing, figuring shit out, etc.) has been largely due in part to me being introduced to SCP and becoming a member of the community.\n\nGetting to know and talking to some key members of the community has been largely what's allowed me to evolve from being my previous shitty and annoying stereotypical teenager-self, to a more tolerable, slightly different type of shitty and annoying stereotypical teenager.\n\nOn another note, my introduction to SCPs in written-form was what really got me into reading & writing in general. Prior to that, I had no interest in such activities, and after finally finding a topic of writing I enjoyed, it gave me motivation to teach myself how to write, and has gotten me into reading; which has allowed me to immerse myself in the broad universe that is literature, and find enjoyment from it. From when I first read SCP-184 at 10-years-old where I was too scared to take a shower for two weeks to now, SCP has been a huge part of my life, and I hope to make it an even bigger part of my life in the future. Truly, it's been a wild ride.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Hexick]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI’m thankful for all the stories, inspiration, and fascination this community has given me for so many years. I’ve been able to meet cool people and learn new things that I might never have been able to otherwise. I love SCP, and I hope to continue creating and assisting here for many years to come.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Crow-Cat]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nGlad that we've made so far despite nothing!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Osobist]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki Russian Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am grateful for the huge body of work that people have come up with around the concept of the SCP Foundation. I am even more thankful for the wonderful community that's grown up around these works, both on and off the wiki. And most of all, I'm grateful for the many wonderful friends and colleagues I've met through this website. Thank you all for making my life that much more special.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user DrEverettMann]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am eternally grateful for our community of people spanning across the globe; a community which has helped me through hard times, through school and work, but most importantly a community that continues to make me laugh and gives me great stories to read.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user SketchyTh0ughts]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am thankful for the readers and writers that have come together to form a welcoming and modern weird fiction community. We have all the best creativity of the pulp fiction days without the downsides.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user torcsandantlers]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm super grateful to be a part of this wonderful, supportive community.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user NebulousStar]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThanks everyone for still being active and creative after all this time! Be proud of this project and where we brought it together. Never stop bringing your ideas to life, and dream big.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Dr Lekter]], //Administrator of the SCP Wiki International and French Branches//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nForever proud of the OC makers and cosplayers, the writers and the artists, and anyone who has ever voiced their support for this community!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Luxaiko]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIf someone had told me a year ago that I'd be able to write fiction and that people would actually read it, I'd have called them insane. This community, however, showed me that you can accomplish anything if you really want to, and for that I'll always and forever be thankful.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user hungrypossum]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI genuinely don't think I'd be where I am today if it wasn't for this community and the friends I've made because of it. It's helped me out of some real tough situations and I genuinely couldn't thank all of it enough.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user DrGooday]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI found the SCP-Wiki in the backend of a tough part of my life. I struggled a lot and wasn't sure where to go. Finding the wiki gave me motivation to do something, and finding that ability to get up and do a bit of writing was so important for getting me to keep going. I've only written a bit but I've made lots of friends on this small slice of the internet and for that I am so thankful. I try and help out now and then where I can and even though I don't write as often I still really enjoy being a part of something a bit bigger than me. So for helping me move past my dark place and turn into a me that I am happy with, I am thankful.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user R4_EX]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nFor all its ups and downs, I've really valued the connections I've made here. It's been great to spend so much time with like-minded creatives and I really feel like I've made a lot of improvement to myself both as a writer and as a project head.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Raddagher]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am thankful to have stumbled upon the wiki and the community. It's been an honor to be part of something as great as this, to have read so many incredible creations and to have created content that has been enjoyed by so many.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Aftokrator]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nHappy birthday 173. Here's to another fifteen years of creepypasta and writing collaboration.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user stormbreath]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI’m thankful for all the upvotes. Also the amazing friends for life and the positive community and the incredible well of creativity. But mostly the upvotes.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Rounderhouse]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI'm so happy for all the great friends I've made in the SCP community, and the opportunity to improve my writing!\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Doctor Fullham]], //Junior Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\ni'm thankful for the great people in this community who make it a worthwhile way to spend my time\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user gee0765]], //Moderator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nParticipating in the SCP Foundation has changed my perspective on leadership and getting tasks done. Developing the mindset and resolve to complete Licensing work, Community Outreach projects, and moderate several aspects of the community required intense internal development and introspection, sometimes by force. This development, however, has improved me for the better, and I cannot thank the SCP Wiki enough, and our funny statue friend, for it.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Elenee FishTruck]], //Moderator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThe best aspect of SCP-173 is that very number, and the possibility space that it implied - a universe filled to the brim with impossible things, and the thin line keeping us from them. We've spent fifteen years teasing out the full implications of those seven characters, and I look forward to fifteen more.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Meserach]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAs the person who ended up removing 173's image, I've had a complex relationship with the article. On one hand, it's shown me just how much annoyance comes with being marketable, and lord knows I've had to toss my weight around as licensing staff to prevent copyright violations. On the other hand, this tiny article that barely takes up half of your desktop screen is responsible for me meeting some of my closest friends, and for convincing me to take the first step into a new career path. As much as I enjoy complaining about all the headaches this little peanut has given me, I do genuinely still love the article both for what it is and what it represents. 173 created an entire new subgenre among internet fiction, creating a community that spans over one hundred thousand members onsite, and many more offsite. It has inspired games both directly and indirectly, and has resulted in an entire site that hosts fiction from the scale of a brief sentence to an entire novella, all accessible for free to anyone who wishes to read them. 173 represents the culmination of a love of reading, and the desire to impart that love onto others. Above all, 173 represents the freedom to build upon each other's works, resulting in both extensive canons and fanworks that couldn't be possible without the generosity of moto42 putting the article under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\nThank you, 173. And thank you, the community, for upholding the spirit of 173 for as long as you have.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user Naepic]], //Moderator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nCore to the idea of SCP is the belief that within almost any scenario, no matter how implausible or ridiculous, the human imagination can evoke a full range of emotions. I love being surprised how each and every writer uses their tools and experience to put their impossible-to-recreate spin on what presents as often very simple themes. Wonder is often in short supply, and the Wiki helps me find it almost every day.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user ManyMeats]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am immensely grateful for the opportunity to be part of a such a community comprised of brilliant individuals; it is extraordinarily powerful how the unity behind this community-driven project managed to continuously improve it to be one of the greatest collections of bibliographic material that, in its collection, represent an exceptional hallmark of creativity, and fellowship.\n\nIt would be remiss not to cite the folks from our communities, regardless of branch, creed, or nationality; each, and every single one of you represent an incredibly courageous, and talented individual by taking your time to contribute to the development, and growth of this collection with everything you do; by creating content, by consuming the content, by engaging with the content, by engaging with each, and every single member of this community for reasons within, or without.\n\nI am thankful for having the cognisance to recognise this once-in-a-generation opportunity; I am specially grateful for being capable of engaging with the content the SCP community makes; I am specially grateful for engaging with those who I consider dear friends from the SCP community.\n\nThank y'all.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user slashannemoo]], //Administrator of the SCP Wiki Lusophone and International Branches.//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt's been incredible seeing this community grow over the years, and I hope we can continue to help it mature and become something even greater. I hope I can do my part in all that.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user aismallard]], //Administrator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI am grateful for all the twisted stories and worlds our talented authors and artists have constructed for us to experience.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user LemonBee12]], //Operational Staff for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThe SCP wiki and community have helped me discover who I truly am, and have given me a creative outlet and friends I wouldn't give up for the world. I hope it keeps doing so for whoever comes next, and I hope my contributions are, in some small way, a part of someone's journey.\n[[/div]]\n\n-- [[*user pr0m37h3um]], //Moderator for the SCP Wiki English Branch//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
