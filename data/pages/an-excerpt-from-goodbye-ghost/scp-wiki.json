I'm only a spirit that haunts the posteriors of mammals.\n\nJ: I can't let you go.\n\nBG: You already have. //(Gestures to the framed photo of James with his arm wrapped around a yield sign.)//\n\nJ: It's not what you think!\n\nBG: No, it's what I know.\n\nJ: But butt ghost...\n\nBG: Shh, don't speak. You've broken my heart enough already.\n\nJ: I can't let you go.\n\nBG: You had no trouble letting your //other women// go!\n\nJ: That was years ago, Butt Ghost!\n\nBG: A butt ghost never forgets.\n\nJ: You forgot me once.\n\nBG: I had to go soul-searching, James.\n\nJ: And what did you find?\n\nBG: I found my spirit place. The air was still and the water was cool. I felt a presence. I turned to look, but no one was there. I was alone. The moon overhead gazed down at my prone body. I felt nothing and everything at once. And that's when I realized, my people need me.\n\nJ: Ankle ghost will be fine.\n\nBG: It's not just Ankle Ghost anymore, James, it's the world.\n\nJ: What does that even mean?\n\nBG: They're revoking ghost licenses everywhere now.\n\nJ: No!\n\nBG: It's true.\n\nJ: But what about your estranged relationship with your brother?\n\nBG: Ghost Butt will either have to get out of my way, or join me.\n\nJ: How?\n\nBG: James, you know me too well to question my ability in dealing with these issues.\n\nJ: Very well. I can only hope you don't fail.\n\nBG: Failure is not an option.\n\nJ: Good luck.\n\nBG: Thank you.\n\nJ: Here take this. (Passes plunger)\n\nBG: I will not let you down.\n\nJ: Goodbye, Butt Ghost. //(Salutes)//\n\nBG: Goodbye, James. //(Flushes)//\n\n------\n\n//Something even the loneliest man can relate to, Goodbye Ghost brings us to realize our own mortality and the importance of our relationship with our friends, regardless of corporeality.// - Foundation Tribune\n\n//Play of the year. Period.// - CI Review\n\n//Guaranteed to make you both laugh and cry, the Butt Ghost's performance is the best of the the year, if not the century.// - Time-anomaly Magazine\n\n//What the FUCK is this shit?// - O5-7\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
