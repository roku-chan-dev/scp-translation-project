I mean it's not like the education system here is really good at teaching any of us stuff like that, but, uh, that's - look, that's another discussion. The most important one to learn for us is //shutting the fuck up//. You know, in a lot of cases, the Foundation doesn't even bother locking us up. If they think you're fine, they'll just leave you be for the most part. Though, er, I guess the fact that I'm even talking to you makes that a moot point, so, um... You know, just take that as advice. \n\nBut look, all things considered, there are worse places you could have ended up. Mainly dead, yeah, that's the big one, but at least you don't have to do too much if you don't stick your neck out - which I don't think you should have done, but hey, we're here now - or do anything stupid. Plus, we got that whole, uh... 'Site-17 Anomaly Social Flagship Project,' which, despite it seeming to be in a blind spot for the Department of Acronyms, seems like a... real //cool// way to talk with other humanoids until it inevitably crashes and burns, so, I guess get your shots in while you can.\n\nUh... //anywho//, as for the reason you're actually listening to this, or, ah, reading this — I'm not really sure if they're going to give you the recording or transcription — you've applied to joining Mobile Task Force Alpha-9. Stupid fucking idea, but I guess we're each other's problem now. There's been a fairly distressing rise in anomalous activity recently, and Foundation leadership has //once again// decided to fight fire with fire. I'll make sure you get as much information on the previous attempts as I can get my hands on in the interest of transparency, but it's getting bad enough that we've got to start the same shit up again. I'll do everything I can to make sure you can at least walk away from all this, but just keep in mind that the world out there's even weirder than what you think from staying with the Foundation. The only thing I can say for sure is that everything's way freakier than you'd think at first.\n\nNot me though. I'm normal. I am So Normal.\n\n//- Message to anomalous Alpha-9 applicants from Commander Iris Thompson//\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 150%]] Prologue [[/size]]\n\n[[size larger]][[[humanoid-risk-assessment|The Department of Humanoid Risk Assessment]]][[/size]]\n\nA seemingly routine investigation of a girl who can reach through photographs points to concerning findings. \n\n[[size larger]][[[Kill the Feeling]]][[/size]]\n\nA brief look at growing up with nobody to help.\n\n[[size 150%]]Part One[[/size]]\n\n[[size larger]][[[Penal Reform]]] | [[[Friendly Conversation]]] | [[[Onboarding]]][[/size]]\n\nSite-17 takes a crack at loosening the restrictions on humanoid anomalies, and everyone from the O5's representatives to the anomalies themselves have to deal with a jarring change in their situations.\n\n[[size larger]]Voices Carry[[/size]]\n[[size larger]][[[Voices Carry Part 1|Part 1]]] | [[[Voices Carry Part 2|Part 2]]] | [[[Voices Carry Part 3|Part 3]]] | [[[Voices Carry Part 4|Part 4]]] |  [[[Voices Carry Epilogue |Epilogue]]][[/size]]\n\nVarious anomalous groups competing for the same prize leads to a very bad day for Alpha-9, and Iris, much to her chagrin, has some very Not Normal things happen to her.\n\n[[size larger]]All Alone on a Friday[[/size]]\n[[size larger]][[[Friday Morning|Morning]]] | [[[Friday Afternoon|Afternoon]]] | [[[Friday Night|Night]]][[/size]]\n\nGod, you're pathetic.\n\n[[size larger]][[[Everybody Loves Aleksander]]][[/size]]\n\nA loser, a telepath, a blood witch, and Cactusman must band together to protect a Foundation site.\n\n[[size larger]][[[Redwood Labs]]] | [[[Closed Beta]]] | [[[All the Bells and Whistles]]] [[/size]]\n\nThe Olympia Project has been on ice for years, its technological advancements locked away but still functional.

A jaded veteran, an expert sniper, a competent commander, a potentially dangerous anomaly, and, above all else, an absolutely pathetic person. Iris suffered the worst of the Foundation's past missteps in handling anomalies, lost all of her friends and family at a young age, spend the most formative years of her life in containment, //and// was raised Catholic. You can't blame the poor woman that she ended up like this. Despite her caustic personality and inability to socialize, she still tries to do her best for all the other anomalies so they don't suffer like she did. Unfortunately, she has a tendency to let her past experiences cloud her judgement.\n\n* **Jaqueline Johnson/SCP-1985:** A scientist by trade, Jaqueline has spent the past several years of her life exploring various kinds of apocalypses to help the Foundation, even though they tried picking her apart at one time. Despite this, Jaqueline does her best to remain optimistic, both in her assignment as Alpha-9's medic and field specialist and in her interpersonal relationships. She's like this, to an extent, because she //has// to be - after seeing so much desolation, she'd got to stay focused on the here and now. As one of the few anomalies with a normal life up through adulthood, she's one of the only ones with solid social skills. \n\n* **Andrea Adams:** Dr. Clef's old protégé, a member of Foundation staff that works closely with Alpha-9. While she officially acts in a support role, in reality, she's kept close to Alpha-9 to act as a \"safety valve\" in case things get out of hand. Charismatic and composed, she's generally well-liked, though she's keeping her actual purpose a secret from the rest of the team. On top of this, she lacks any memories from before about a decade ago. Not unheard of for Foundation employees, but the gaps in memory are becoming more and more glaring.\n\n* **Alexander Foxx:** A former MC&D Huntsman, Foxx serves alongside Adams as a safety valve for Alpha-9 while assisting them in their operations. He sees himself as cool, suave, and debonair. Other people, unfortunately, see him as a massive dork who very clearly wants people to think he's some kind of superspy. Foxx is certainly a competent combatant and nonchalant killer - something that puts him at odds with Iris at times - but ultimately the \"single father\" side of his personality shines through most of the time.\n\n**__Foundation Leadership__**\n\n\n* **Factotum September:** Elegant and poised, September is the very picture of what a Factotum should be. While she's a relatively low-ranked Factotum, generally tossed by the O5 council whenever they want eyes or an extra body on an important project, she enjoys the respect she commands - and dislikes when it isn't afforded to her. Despite the great lengths she goes to in order to maintain her image, she's actually a huge nerd[[footnote]](Derogatory)[[/footnote]], a secret she's prepared to take to her grave. \n\n**__Contained Humanoids__**\n\n* **Anne Byrne/CPOI-GRN3-8674:** A former Insurgency operator captured in an [[[voices-carry-part-1|Alpha-9 operation]]], Byrne is a weak infovore, not capable of much more than sensing someone's emotions, and was therefore passed up for SCP designation. She's generally cooperative with the Foundation but enjoys heckling authority figures and messing with people in general, though she happily applied for a spot on Alpha-9, perhaps only to continue pestering Iris. \n\n* **Stacey Lee/SCP-3009-C:** A completely normal teenage girl, with no anomalies to speak of. The only reason she's contained is because of an unfortunate association with a very minor anomaly, something she's become very aware of in her relatively short but predictably brutal time at the Foundation. When given the opportunity, though, she still forces herself to interact with others - it's good for her, no matter how awkward it can be. As she's still introverted, she prefers to spend her time in Leora's company.\n\n* **Leora Lightfoot/SCP-4818:** Another contained teenager, though markedly more anomalous. Leora is capable of manipulating hardlight projections, and sees this as something akin to a superpower, much to Iris' dismay. Extroverted and assertive, she often does the talking for Stacey, or simply drags her around.\n\n* **Marya Sirin/CPOI-RED4-0610:** Belonging to a long and feared line of Sarkic 'Blood Striga,' Marya is physically far from human, though Striga tend to prefer human appearances over anything else. Having recently been transferred to Site-17 from a higher-security location, she's eager to land on her feet and start socializing. After all, the fact that she's underselling her abilities won't be an issue so long as nothing crazy happens. \n\n**__Hostile GoI Persons of Interest__**\n\n* **Ines Aubert:** A brilliant bioengineer, Aubert's company, Redwood Labs, is widely known on both sides of the Veil for their superlative medical implants. Though she's not a weapons manufacturer, when faced with the opportunity to make use of sequestered Olympia technology, stolen from the Foundation, to push the boundaries of science, Aubert turned a blind eye to the obviously shady dealings. \n\n* **Charlemagne Gamma:** The first unit produced from a marriage of Olympia and Redwood technology, Gamma leads the other units from the front as a walking tank. While Olympia Zero was held back by wasting precious weight and resources on useless features, Gamma has no such weaknesses - she's the strongest and toughest thing you can put on two legs, made by Ines to represent the transhumanist future humanity should strive for, and the uncompromising guardian every family should have.\n\n* **Charlemagne Delta:** Unlike Gamma, the second Charlemagne unit focuses far more on making a human machine, one more capable of emotional thinking. Though her lack of empathy manifests in sadistically 'testing' humans to learn more about their emotions, her social intelligence and care for her siblings means Gamma often treats her as an equal, or at least a lieutenant.\n\n* **Charlemagne Epsilon:** Produced some time after the first two units, Epsilon's design was unconcerned with combat or socialization, instead focusing on supportive capabilities. Though programmed to be concerned with his siblings, he lacks Delta's tact or the others' patience. Despite this, he finds himself in the frequent company of Zeta, though not by choice.\n\n* **Charlemagne Zeta:** The final Charlemagne unit, Zeta forgoes Gamma's durability in favor of offensive potential - in fact, they were intentionally made less durable as a safety measure. As parts of their brain come from a psion, they primarily fight with a spear coupled with psionic energy projection. In order to ensure such a unique and dangerous weapon was unlikely to get any smart ideas and fly the coup, Zeta was produced with less information already stored on their systems than the other units, as well as a less complex personality module. They haven't let this stop them from causing Epsilon no shortage of headaches. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Want to contribute?\" hide=\"Hide Contribution Guide\"]]\n\nInterested in contributing to the series, but not sure where to start? Well, the series itself isn't particularly stringent in most cases, so you're welcome to try to add something that adds to an overarching storyline or not. Keep in mind that there are three main things that the canon focuses on:\n\n* Alpha-9 and a long-term storyline with them, as this was made in part as a Resurrection splinter canon. While this is probably the part of the series with the most long-term planning, you're still welcome to contribute or pitch tale ideas.\n* Contained humanoids, typically (though not exclusively) in Site-17. Specifically, this series should examine them as characters and allow them to interact. There isn't much in the way of hard guidelines here, so as long as you don't totally break the setting with an article, most things in this vein should be good to go.\n* The lives of humanoid or otherwise intelligent anomalies elsewhere in the world, and how they've been impacted by the status quo. This series isn't just for exploring contained anomalies, it's more generally a place to focus on them as a whole. Ideally, articles focusing on this would tie into the rest of the canon or general setting somehow. If you have any questions about this or have an idea and not sure if it fits here, feel free to reach out and ask.\n\n**What's the setting?** While there is a focus on Site-17 and places where contained anomalies would interact, there isn't a hard mandate that things have to be in any specific place. If it works for an article, it'll work for the series.\n\n**What should the tone be?** The tone can be pretty much anything you want. Comedy, drama, action, tragic, as long as it works in the canon, you're good to go. Though keep in mind that, overall, the canon shouldn't seem totally hopeless. Things might be in a bad spot for many anomalies, but the world isn't totally cruel or hopeless. That said, it can certainly //seem// that way sometimes.\n\n**What kind of themes should I consider when writing?** This isn't an exhaustive list of possible topics, nor do you need to focus on all of these things when writing an article, but some themes to keep in mind for the canon are:\n\n* The status quo is cruel for anomalies. Some people may have it better than others, but the world is unwelcoming to anomalies down to its core systems.\n* Nobody is unscathed by this. Even if someone wasn't locked in solitary for years - and especially if they //were// - they don't come out of that totally normal. Everyone has been impacted by the way of the world in one way or another, not just the anomalies. \n* Anomalies aren't afforded the same choices as the rest of society. Even if they aren't contained, they simply aren't given a choice in many things.\n* Even in dire straits, people find things to latch onto. Be it a hobby or the company of someone else, people can make their own lights in dark tunnels.\n* If the world doesn't accept you, the world should change before you do.\n\n**Is there anything that would stop me from adding an article to this?** In general, no. However, things should stay consistent in terms of timeline and characterization, especially so as characters are the focus of the canon. Even then, if you wanted to write a slightly spin-off-ish series and have it included on the hub page, let me know. \n\n**What if there's something I want to bring over into this canon, new or established?** You're more than welcome to bring in parts of other canons or new ideas or characters. The only thing would be consistency, as stated above, but almost anything could fit with the proper justification.\n\nIf you have any further questions, just message [[*user GlassAutomaton]], leave a post in the discussion thread for this page, or get in contact with me over Discord, as I'm relatively active under the same username on the official SCP Discord.\n\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
