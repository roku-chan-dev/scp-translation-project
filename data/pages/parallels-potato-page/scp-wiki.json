It was originally intended to be a love story, but after I finished the first two paragraphs I decided that this was a terrible fish that didn't deserve love.\n[[image 8093.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-8093]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones bones \n[[image 8111-J%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-8111-J]]]\n**Type:** SCP-J\n**My Thoughts:** Oh my goodness there's a second foundation. Holy moly. What are we gonna do with two foundations?!?!?!\n[[image 7693%20Potato size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-7693]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** Cows can't go moo. Here's what happens instead.\n[[image 7621%20Potato size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-7621]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** I'm a huge fan of board games and tabletop RPGs, so it was inevitable that I would write something about dice. I think that dice that roll low are worse than murderers. Remember to reward dice that roll well with treats!\n[[image 7782%20Potato size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-7782]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** Yes, I would kiss this apple. Next question.\n[[image 7271%20Potato size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-7271]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** Silly little microbes on a silly little strike! This was part of a challenge to write a successful article in 500 words or less. I also am a fan of lactofermenting my own pickles, which was the inspiration for this article. I channeled almost all my silly energy into this one, and I hope you like it!\n[[image DoA%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/acquisitions-training Department of Acquisitions Training Seminar]\n**Type:** Tale\n**My thoughts:** My first successful piece on the wiki, and it's about tomatoes being shot at field agent trainees. In my headcanon, I imagine there's a generalist department in charge of locating and bringing in most anomalies. This orientation was my attempt to bring that department to life in a fun way, while also showcasing how unknown anomalies would be contained in the field.\n[[image Wayward%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wayward-prayers A Selection of Wayward Prayers]\n**Type:** WL Story\n**My thoughts:** A story about silly gods and silly prayers! While this isn't technically an SCP story, I felt it was worthy of being included here. As of the time of this blurb being written, I have written the first 7 entries here. This is one of the silliest things I have written by far. I think this is where I first discovered my \"writing voice\", which I have carried into a few other things I have worked on. Hope you enjoy!\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab My Serious Stuff]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 7940%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7940 SCP-7940]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My thoughts:** A researcher who is trying to improve himself but is stifled by self doubt and a ceiling that represents that self-doubt. I think this SCP is just as much about me as it is about a fictional character. It's a reflection of how I always struggled with self-doubt going through college and my internship, and how I was able to do well in them despite that doubt. When it comes down to it, I'm proud of both my little researcher dude and myself. I’m learning to not focus as much on my self-doubt, and I like to imagine 7940 does too eventually.\n[[image 7127%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7127 SCP-7127]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My thoughts:** A story about a person in an emotionally abusive relationship trying to go shopping. This was a hard SCP to write. I wanted to show how even seemingly innocuous things can be used as a weapon by an abuser, and that emotional abuse can be just as damaging as physical abuse. If you think are in an abusive relationship, you can find a link to National Domestic Violence Hotline here: https://www.thehotline.org/\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab My Collabs]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 4123.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-4123]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** This was a collab with [[*user Diogene_s]]! We decided to do a rewrite of a frankly disturbing SCP and turn it into something silly. I hope you enjoyed!\n[[image 8012%20Potato size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-8012]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** This was a collab with [[*user IndustryStandard]]! Hehe frog :).\n[[image 7682%20Potato.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n**Name:** [[[SCP-7682]]]\n**Type:** SCP\n**My Thoughts:** This was a collab with [[*user SYTYCFanon]]! Its about a hard to catch reptile and a stressed researcher chasing after it. I helped write some of the capture logs, which were just as silly as I like to have them. I admittedly was in a bit of a slump as we were working on this, but I'm happy with the product that we were able to get out.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n------\nAuthor Will: In the event that I am not seen in any SCP space for a period of 6 months or greater, I would like all my articles to be considered rewriteable by the rewrite team (or equivalent team of the future time period).\n------\n\n[[size 150%]]**Quotes!**[[/size]]\n\"I'll think of something clever\" - [[*user FlyPurgatorio]]\n\"Very cool.
