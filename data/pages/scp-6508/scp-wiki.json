The building is to be put on lockdown and permanently closed to the public.\n\nSCP-6508 is to undergo daily maintenance performed by a rotating roster composed of a janitor and a field agent. Assigned janitorial personnel must wear a protective suit to avoid direct contact with the anomaly.\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[include component:image-block \n|name=octopus.jpg\n|caption= A common octopus inside of SCP-6508.\n|align=right\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6508 is a collection of 32 Mediterranean marine aquariums in //El Arrecife//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Spanish for \"The Reef\".[[/span]], a specialized store in Huesca, Spain. All of the aquariums are populated by several species of marine animals. Any mass of water within SCP-6508 will exhibit its anomalous effects. When a living human being comes into contact with its water mass, it will become an SCP-6508-1 instance.\n\nSCP-6508-1 instances manifest physical traits analogous to one of the animals present in SCP-6508. The number of physical alternations is fluctuating and will only affect the body parts that have come in contact with SCP-6508's water mass. It is to note that some SCP-6508-1 instances have reported the loss of certain senses like smell, vision, or hearing due to no longer having the required facial structures.\n\n[[size

Samper:** Well, she was the one who made me join the Foundation in the first place. She had been working for a decade before I got in. Although I'm not surprised she got that high up though, she's always been good at everything she does.

Even though she always got perfect grades and the approval of our parents, she'd always make sure I'm okay.\n\n**Martel:** That must've been nice.\n\n**Agt.

I do not expect you to understand why I'm making this decision but I'll try either way.\n\nImagine that you have a job, a modest one, but it pays enough for you to live. You know that your employers are up to some sketchy stuff that you don't know about. For the greater good, probably. But still, it's stuff that you shouldn't know about. You wonder what is going on but never ask, you'd be taking a risk if you did.\n\nOne day, while at work, you run into some trouble. You didn't mean to interfere but your job got too close to the danger and now, you're involved with the scary stuff you didn't want to deal with. Now everyone looks at you differently. They look at you with hatred in their eyes. You're different now, you're a weirdo.\n\nHowever, there's also something that you don't know. The weirdos look out for each other because they know what it means to be marginalized and isolated.\n\nI'm a weirdo now. Maybe you don't want me or don't know what to do with me. But they do.\n\n[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/manhunt Goodbye, Jailors.]\n\n[[>]]\n-- Sancho\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6507]]] | SCP-6508 | [[[SCP-6509]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** octopus.png\n> **Name:** Aquarium de Paris 12-26 (32135515416).jpg\n> **Author:** KimonBerlin\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aquarium_de_Paris_12-26_(32135515416).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
