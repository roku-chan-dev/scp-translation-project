Atop them, written in red lettering, their titles: \"safe,\" \"euclid,\" and \"keter.\"[[footnote]] **Content warning:** This memory prominently features animal death. [[/footnote]] You can hear the gentle hum of a forgotten experience inside each one; the flow of nighttime traffic, the chirping of morning birds, the patter of footsteps on grass. You fish around in your pocket until you find what you need: three golden keys.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n+ safe\n\nThe assortment obscures your vision\nA cool breeze whips over the top most pillow\nYou are nesting, curled into a defensive ball\nWrapped under a cotton cocoon on a black summer night.\n\nA fortress: a stack of decorative pillows\nAnd weighted blankets\nWith an opening above you, like a hole in the sky\nThe light of passing trucks shines through your window, illuminating your face as it turns upwards at the world.\n\nThere’s a loneliness to the changing of the seasons\nA promise that the world and all the people in it will keep spinning and spinning and spinning\n\nA promise that all things will change, and sometimes things will stay the same.\n\nYou\nhave\nnever\nfelt\nmore\nsafe.\n\n+ euclid\n\nIn the cotton candy morning, you stand in the glimmer of the backyard\n(if it can be called a backyard, it's all asphalt)\nand watch\nthrough the wires and the hills that are houses\nthe yellowing, widening mouth in the clouds\ninto a blue, crystal throat.\n\nYou carefully slip off your shoes.\n\nYou walk down to where the asphalt ends, just beneath the high white wooden fence,\nAnd you stand there, in the corner of the yard, in the one teeny tiny box that has grass.\n\nBefore you is a rusted iron gate, and beneath you are ladybugs and worms—and gnats that bite at you, but to swat them away would be purposeless.\n\nYou place your hand on the gate and think about the geography of the suburbs. Boxes within boxes within boxes,\n\nYou are in a box behind a box, boxed in from other boxes with greener boxes around them\n\nIt’s absurd, really...\n\nYou look back to the rolling hills that are houses and wish, for once\nThis world was non-Euclidean\nAnd it would bend backwards in a way\nSo you could just\n\nPerfectly\n\nSee the clouds part\nAnd show you the sun.\n\n+ keter\n\nIn the waning afternoon,\nYou are walking beside an intersection\nThe busiest road in the whole village, right in front of your partner’s house\n\nAnd as you turn one last time,\nThere\nIn the green grass\nA brown bird.\n\nHis feathers are sleek and shimmering\nAnd his beady black eyes, like glasses, sit above his beak\n\nHe is on his side, and legs are broken\nAnd so is his wing.\n\nYou scramble: //Please don't be dead//\nLifting your flannel from your shoulders, you produce\nA fortress, with an opening above the avian like a hole in the sky.\n\nLifting him quickly, his shallow breaths match your own as you take off;\n//Good, good, he's breathing//\nAnd as quickly as his chest moves up and down, you realize\n//I should not be able to see him breathe//\nAnd a helplessness envelopes you as he speaks:\n\n{{Chirrup,\nchirrup,\nchirrup}}\n\nThen\nsilence.\n\nYou bury him there; a shrine of dirt and flowers, and your thoughts wander\n\nThere was nothing you could do for him\nBut it dawns on you at least you were there\nAnd even in his final words to you, in some language\nIn some way\nYou knew what he said:\n\n//Thank you; I love you//\n\nAnd you know one day you will watch him float in an open sky\nAnd for you, he will unfurl a banner of parchment, before facing away\nAnd swimming through the air, with his powerful wings, into that final wherever.\n\nAs the darkness of another summer night closes around you\nYou proclaim this sparrow's name:\nKeter, the crown\nThe golden brown beauty you held in your hands\nThat now you will always carry on your back\n\nAlways.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"indented\"]]\n\nYou gently set the lid back down. With a sharp twist, the third box is locked again. Satisfied, you turn to the door behind you, and press it open with your left hand. Light fills the nearly forgotten storage unit as you step off into somewhere else.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author's Note\" hide=\"Hide Author's Note\"]]\n\nThis trilogy of poems was a simple exercise, but one I feel very brave for partaking.\n\nI have done two things here which I have never done before. For one, I posted on the SCP Foundation website for the first time, after years and years of lurking. For two, I wrote free verse poetry for the first time since middle school.\n\nFree verse is a difficult tightrope to walk upon. There is a certain point where you must ask yourself, //can this not be portrayed with prose?//, where you must question the delivery and the medium itself. To offset this, I took it upon myself to maintain some lyrical integrity. A vast majority of my work is inspired by the lyricism of Will Toledo, the lead singer of Car Seat Headrest and 1 Trait Danger; in particular, I have attempted to mimic the shifting schemes of //Boxing Day,// a beautiful emo song which brings back early memories of basement jamming and pretending to like pretentious prog rock (I still love prog rock, but you know what I'm talking about).\n\nIn that vein, I wished to draw upon only my memories. I would bare myself and my feelings to the website, allow them to look into my skull for a little while, and then depart safely. This has been immensely satisfying for me; not only has it allowed me to share the small pleasures of my life, but it has allowed others to partake in them.\n\nI don't care about the \"upvotes,\" but I enjoy the knowledge that my writing has touched someone, anyone, somewhere, anywhere. If this has connected with you on any level, I highly encourage you to share your experiences with someone else as well.\n\nBe it through poetry, prose, or a drawing, unlock the boxes in your heart and mind and allow a little bit of your innermost self to shine through. You might be surprised at who your light shines on! ~[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beneath-the-floorboards Shuck & Roxy]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
