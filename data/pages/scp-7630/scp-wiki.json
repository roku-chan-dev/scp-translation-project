Personnel interacting with instances of SCP-7630 or infected patients must follow Class-B (BSL-3) HAZMAT/biosafety procedures. \n\nCurrently, no known instances of SCP-7630 exist outside of Foundation containment. However, in the event of a widespread breach, Emergency Response Command Team Theta-5 is to immediately attempt to contain the breach and decontaminate all affected areas.\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{**DESCRIPTION** }}\n[[/=]]\n-----\nSCP-7630 is a small parasitic organism, resembling a box jellyfish. The organism primarily targets human hosts, entering the body through the nose or mouth. SCP-7630 resides within the brain of its host, placing its \"arms\" around the temporal and parietal lobes. The parasite consumes the host's cerebrospinal fluid and gray matter, causing amnesia and confusion, and eventually brain death. Once infected, SCP-7630 cannot be removed by surgical means, as doing so would fatally damage the host's brain. After approximately 1-2 days post-infection, SCP-7630 will lay its eggs within the spinal cord and neck. SCP-7630 eggs can be spread via bodily fluids and airborne particles. The host will enter a comatose state after 2-4 days, and typically dies after 3-5 days.\n\nSCP-7630 is able to generate electrical charges in the brain using its \"arms\", allowing it to communicate with its human host. Subjects infected by SCP-7630 describe a voice speaking to them inside their own heads. See **ADDENDA** for more information.\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{**ADDENDUM 7630-1 -- INITIAL INFECTION** }}\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nOn 2026/02/04, Dr. Emily Rossella was infected with an instance of SCP-7630 during a laboratory accident.
