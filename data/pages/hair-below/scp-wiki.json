There were pieces of… what i think was shit clinging to it too, just these small coats of brown all over it. it was fucking gross. i packed it up with rubber gloves as soon as i could and threw it out into the forest. no way was that shit staying near me.\n\ndoes anyone know if there are any animals that do this? i live in Oregon, so maybe there were mountain lions or cougars that coughed the hair up as hairballs? i’m stumped for answers here.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##pink|**anarneler**## 10/19/2014 (Friday) 12:23:12 #1582243\n--------\n\nSpooky\n\nThough I’m not an expert on animals, but I have a cat at home and those don’t look like hairballs to me???\n\nMaybe the animals know in their bones that it’s October or something and wanna spook you\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##cyan|**kalelisnthisrealname**## 10/19/2014 (Friday) 13:33:22 #7643021\n--------\n\nman you cant possibly believe that shit lmao, animals dont know whether its october or not\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply3\"]]\n##pink|**anarneler**## 10/19/2014 (Friday) 13:37:52 #1582243\n--------\n\nI don’t know what you believe but if you can gather some things on this site, October being an extra-scary time is one of them\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply4\"]]\n##cyan|**kalelisnthisrealname**## 10/19/2014 (Friday) 13:39:52 #7643021\n--------\n\nlol next youre gonna say halloween is magic xD miss me with that shit\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply5\"]]\n##pink|**anarneler**## 10/19/2014 (Friday) 13:45:52 #1582243\n--------\n\nIt’s true.
