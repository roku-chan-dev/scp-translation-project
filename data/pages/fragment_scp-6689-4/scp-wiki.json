The //TEST-L(R)// proposes utilizing a rhizomatic labyrinthine framework for the containment of SCP-6689.\n\n{{**Rhizomatic Labyrinth:**}} The rhizomatic labyrinth, envisioned as an interconnected web, is a construct wherein every distinct point can be and/or is tethered together through navigable lines of relation. Due to this, the disorientation experienced by the labyrinth wanderer emerges as a result of the overwhelming nature of the construct. Where the pathway is unicursal and the maze multicursal, the rhizomatic labyrinth can be envisioned as omnicursal: possessing infinite pathways, none of which are prioritized as \"correct.\" As such, the labyrinthine wanderer cannot hope to escape the rhizomatic labyrinth, merely travel within it indefinitely. Unlike the uni and multicursal labyrinths, there is no distinct perspective of the labyrinth viewer. A rhizomatic labyrinth cannot be fully experienced from without and attempts to do so produce mere tracings -- partial representations of its encompassing complexity.\n@@ @@\n\n+++ __**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/5|GOTTFRIED]]]**__ SUB-PROTOCOLS:\n++++++ RHIZOMATIC LABYRINTH DEVELOPMENT REPORT\n-----\n* {{P1,2 -- Conn-Het Implementation: //##green|Successful##//}}\n* {{P3 -- Multiplicity Implementation: //##green|Successful##//}}\n* {{P4 -- Asig-Rapture Implementation: //##green|Successful##, redundancies of containment assured.//}}\n* {{P5,6: Carto-Decal Implementation: //##red|Unresolved##, relation to SCP-6689 perpetuates central unity in construct.//}}\n-----\n@@ @@\n{{**Note:**}} While a rhizomatic containment construct ought to successfully contain __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/0|SCP-6689]]]__ indefinitely, we -- thus far -- have been unable to formulate a stable labyrinth. Our best indication as to why is due to the relation between SCP-6689 and said rhizome: the entity understands and experiences it in relation to itself, and thus occupies the role of a central unity -- which is antithetical to the nature of the construct. The application of further noospheric antimemes within the construct is being explored.\n[[/div]]",
