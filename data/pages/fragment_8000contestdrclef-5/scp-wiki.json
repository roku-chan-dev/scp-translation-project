The anomaly appears to be corrected: however, please contact us if it recurs (indicated by visual, text, and auditory corruption). \n\nWe thank you for your patience.\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n\n    |item-number= 8009\n\n    |clearance= 4\n\n    |container-class= euclid\n\n    |secondary-class= alterius\n\n    |secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/chaos-arts/icon-CSC-Alterius.svg\n\n    |disruption-class= keneq\n\n    |risk-class= notice\n\n    ]]\n[[size large]] **Special Containment Procedures:**  [[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nSCP-8009 manifestations are always preceded by a sudden spike in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/and-this-one-explains-humes|ambient Hume levels in the high 100s to 400s]]], followed by a burst of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-arad|Aspect Radiation in the ten-thousand kiloCasper (Blue, Sharp, Tight) range]]]. Detection of these phenomena is grounds for deployment of Mobile Task Force Delta-20 (“Murderhobos”)[[footnote]]A Mobile Task Force specializing in the particular skills required to deal with SCP-8009[[/footnote]] unless hostile action from outside agencies is anticipated. [[footnote]](Consult Document D-20-8009-1-1-9 (GUIDELINES FOR PROCEDURE 220-KIRKE-REUEL) for operational procedures).[[/footnote]]\n\nPrevention of SCP-8009 activation is the preferred containment method. This is most easily accomplished by physically destroying the SCP-8009 instance after manifestation but before activation. Should the SCP-8009 instance activate, physical destruction is not recommended unless overseen by an approved thaumatologist.[[footnote]]The HMCL supervisor assigned to this project will maintain and update a list of thaumatologists trained in deactivating SCP-8009[[/footnote]]\n\nThe primary danger from SCP-8009 occurrences comes from the entities that emerge upon activation (collectively categorized under SCP-8009-A). SCP-8009-A instances should be terminated without prejudice, and the corpses disposed of by a Hazardous Materials Disposal team equipped for dealing with high-energy ionizing radiation sources. Should an SCP-8009-A instance escape termination, dispatch of other Mobile Task Force units may be authorized upon approval by Level 4 or higher authority.\n\nUnder no circumstances are Foundation personnel to enter SCP-8009 for any reason. Any persons or equipment that pass through SCP-8009 are to be considered lost, and no rescues are to be attempted. Violation of this protocol is grounds for disciplinary action.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size large]] **Description**  [[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nSCP-8009 is a free-standing pointed-trefoil archway made of a combination of oak wood and wrought iron. At the apex of the archway is carved a celtic-knot pattern consisting of two concentric trefoils, the outer trefoil being inverted. Geometric patterns corresponding to thaumaturgical runes have been carved into the structure and filled with a mixture of silver powder, grave dirt, and collagen-based adhesive. [[footnote]] Although these runes are not used by any currently existing thaumatological system, Foundation thaumatologists confirm that the underlying structure is similar to the True Futhark system used by pre-Christian Germanic shamans.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-8009 instances manifest approximately once per year, on average. Manifestation is accompanied by the aforementioned increase in local ambient Hume levels and Aspect Radiation spike, a side effect of SCP-8009’s physical manifestation in our universe. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the geometric runes carved into the SCP-8009 instance will begin to emit high-energy ionizing radiation, further manifesting as a bright blue glow similar to Cherenkov radiation.[[footnote]] Unlike Cherenkov radiation, which is the result of electrically charged particles exceeding the phase velocity of light in a dielectric medium, this blue glow is the result of phlogiston transfer across the multiversal membrane.[[/footnote]] Upon reaching full charge, SCP-8009 will activate, forming a linkage between our universe and an alternate universe (designated SCP-8009-B).\n\nSCP-8009-A is the collective term for living things native to SCP-8009-B that enter our world through an activated SCP-8009 instance. The primary concern is SCP-8009-A̴lfa, which is the Foundation’s designation for SCP-8009-B’s dominant sapient humanoid species. SCP-8009-Alfa instances should be considered hazardous materials due to their nature as high-energy ionizing radiation sources.[[footnote]]Consult CORE-PROC-2007-1-1: Nuclear/Biological/Chemical/Memetic Hazard Protocols for further guidance.[[/footnote]] Terminate with prejudice.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size large]] **Addendum 8009-1: History**  [[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nAccording to sources within the Global Occult Coalition and Serpent’s Hand, SCP-8009 instances have been reported as far back as the 1200s BCE. SCP-8009 occurrences were historically followed by raids by SCP-8009-Alfa, which appear to be primarily focused on abducting human beings (especially young children). Early accounts detail encounters between SCP-8009-Alfa and pre-medieval humanity, often leading to violence. In later years, SCP-8009-Alfa have been witnessed attacking nuclear power plants and attempting to capture various radiation sources, including spent fuel rods and unrefined uranium ore, with at least one of these raids resulting in the loss of a Russian prototype nuclear submarine. [[footnote]] CORE-HIST–TCLAN-1990-03-02 (Extrauniversal attack on prototype Russian nuclear submarine.)[[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size large]] **Addendum 8009-2: Possibility of Diplomatic Relations with SCP-8009-Alfa**  [[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nSeveral attempts have been made to open diplomatic relations with SCP-8009-Alfa. As of 2-16-2024, all attempts have been unsuccessful. The most recent attempt, dated 02-2-2024, was prompted by the emergence of a small parchment scroll, apparently thrown through SCP-8009 from the other side. After decontamination, the scroll was read and transcribed, and contained the following message, written in modern English:\n\n= **THE SINS OF OUR FATHERS ARE UNFORGIVEABLE.**\n= **WE DO NOT SEEK YOUR FORGIVENESS.**\n= **ONLY YOUR UNDERSTANDING**\n\n\nThe meaning of this text is currently unknown.\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8009/offset/0|Return to the Beginning.]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"-\" hide=\"An Epilogue.\"]]\n[[table style=\"border: 0px solid silver; background-color: black; align:center\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8009/DARD.png width=\"500px\"]]\n[[size large]]\n= ##red|What if the breath that kindled those grim fires##\n= ##red|Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage##\n= ##red|And plunge us in the flames, or from above.##\n= ##red|Should intermitted vengeance arm again##\n= ##red|[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chaos-insurgency-hub|Her Red Right Hand to plague us?]]]##\n[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
