Multiple groups, multiple locations.  No signs of coordination, no clear structure, nothing to help us predict where we would be hit next. There was no pattern.  \n\nBut there was a common thread.  What we either couldn't see, or wouldn't acknowledge, is that the Foundation was not alone in our quest.  The anomalous world wanted what they thought the Foundation had.  They wanted Amrita.\n\nEvery major philosophy grapples with the idea of death.  Every branch of esoteric knowledge tries, at some time, to slip its grasp.  The Sarkic cults, preserving their flesh by surrendering to cancerous corruption.  The Broken Church, prolonging life by slowly sacrificing their humanity to the machine.  The perverted Gnosticism of the Fifth Church.  The blood-maddened Daeva.  Hunting endless life for power, for profit, out of lust or fear or base instinct.  Twisted by their pursuit into mockeries of nature.\n\nAnd the Foundation was the same.  That same awful purpose is why we were //formed// - how could it not corrupt us?  Adam and Eve were tempted by the fruit of  knowledge, but the Foundation's original sin was attempting to steal from the tree of life.\n\nLike all the others, our quest made us into monsters.  Like those biblical children, our first sin led us, inevitably, to become killers.  \n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Incomplete medical records - 1948]]\n\n**Medical Records - Site 19 - Project Amrita**\n\n@@@@\n[[=image scan19.PDF width=800px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan17.PDF width=800px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan18.PDF width=800px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan16.PDF width=800px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan11.PDF width=800px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan9.PDF width=650px]]\n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Interview transcript - 1948]]\n\n**Project Amrita - Interview 071-006**\n\n__Date:__ 12 November 1948\n\n__Present:__ \n* O5-1\n* Test Subject 003 (Raymond Lewis)\n* Lt. Charles Taylor (Alpha-1)\n\n> **O5-1:** Hello Raymond.  \n> \n> **Lewis:** Hello, [O5-1].  Long time no see.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Yes, I'm sorry.  It's been a while.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Six months.  \n> \n> **O5-1:** Yes.  I - You've had other visitors, though?  I hear that the old crew from Red Right Hand have been coming to see you in the dorms.\n> \n> **Lewis:** They're not you, sir.  Were you worried about how my handsome mug was looking?\n> \n> **O5-1:** I'm sorry.  The team showed me the photographs.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Don't apologise.  The bone growth seems to have stopped, it doesn't hurt any more.  They say they know what has caused it - whoever gets the next batch won't be affected to the same extent.  As for me, the mirror takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a small price.\n> \n> **O5-1:** God, Ray - I never meant - \n> \n> **Lewis:** Hey, this is no time to be glum.  I'm pleased to see you.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Drink to that?\n> \n> **Lewis:** You brought Laphroaig!  Will my doctors approve?\n> \n> **O5-1:** I've told them to allow it.  What shall we drink to?\n> \n> **Lewis:** To our success.  No?  Then to good health.\n> \n> **O5-1:** To good health.\n> \n> <//glasses clinking//>\n> \n> **Lewis:** It's a funny thing.  You don't think much about your health when you've got it.  Once it starts to go, as you get older, you only think about the health you've lost.  But that is going to change.  Look at me - I am healthier than I ever was.  I can look forward to all my health to come.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ray.  Don't.\n> \n> **Lewis:** What?  Don't tell me you can't see it.  Look past my face - I am stronger.  Younger.  Doctor O'Reilly tells me that my cell death rates are down to almost nothing.  I'm not getting any older - I could be the first man to live forever.  We've broken through that final wall.\n> \n> **O5-1:** No, we haven't.  I need to - Ray.  God, I can't keep doing this.\n> \n> **Lewis:** You've done it, sir.  We're already there.\n> \n> **O5-1:** You only see your own results, Raymond.  You haven't seen what I ... People are dying, Ray.  It is horrible.  It's wrong.  I'm wrong.  I wanted to tell you myself - I'm shutting the project down.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Sir, you can't.  Not when you're almost there.  Eternal life - think about what that could mean, for us, for the world.   \n> \n> **O5-1:** It doesn't feel like that.  It feels like I have been clutching something so hard that I've crushed it out of shape.  Perhaps it's time to let go.\n> \n> **Lewis:** That's not in our nature.  Everything clings to life, always, whatever the cost.  It's our most fundamental instinct.\n> \n> **O5-1:** But only because death itself is fundamental.  Ray, it's taken me a long time, but I am finally learning.  Death is necessary.  Death provides meaning.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Death obliterates meaning!  A lifetime of achievements, plans, hopes; the mind behind them - death renders all of it meaningless.  We have no evidence of an afterlife, but even if it exists, there is no return from it; the connection to the world is cut, so it's the same thing as annihilation.  \n> \n> **O5-1:** You sound like me, you know.  A long time ago.  But I won't debate metaphysics with you, Ray.  I'm too tired.  You wouldn't be saying this if you had seen what I have.\n> \n> **Lewis:** And if you could feel what I feel, what it's like, you wouldn't do this.  You would keep going on the path they wanted you to -\n> \n> **O5-1:** They wouldn't want this.  If they had seen this, seen me... I'm sorry, Ray.\n> \n> **Lewis:** No.  Sir, we're so close.  Don't let all our sacrifice go to waste.\n> \n> **O5-1:**  I'm not going to harm more people, just so I can - \n> \n> **Lewis:** But when we succeed, life will be infinitely more valuable.  Even a single person, living forever - that would outweigh hundreds of normal lives.  Thousands, even.  Think about the knowledge they could gather, the experience ...\n> \n> **O5-1:** Enough.  I've lost too many friends already.  I won't keep paying that price.\n> \n> **Lewis:** And what about me?  What happens if my treatment stops?  You don't know, do you.  It could be the only thing keeping me alive.  Are you willing to lose me too?\n> \n> **O5-1:** We don't know that for sure.  There could be -\n> \n> **Lewis:** Sir, don't lie to me.  I've known you a long time - I've seen you send men to their deaths before.  I know what it looks like.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ray, I'm so sorry.  We've tried everything.  There isn't any other way.  We have to stop this - I need to stop it. \n> \n> **Lewis:** God, I always suspected, but it's another thing to see it.  You would kill a friend just to cover up a mistake.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I'm sorry, Ray.\n> \n> **Lewis:** And the irony is, it's not even a mistake.  We've succeeded.  I've succeeded.  With Amrita, I am what the Foundation was meant to be. \n> \n> **O5-1:** No.  Not any more.  The decision is already made.  They'll be destroying Amrita any time now.  Ray?  Ray, sit down!\n> \n> **Lewis:** You fucking bastard!\n> \n> <//glass breaking//>\n> \n> **O5-1:** Jesus -\n> \n> **Lewis:** You think I'll just die whenever you want?  That you're going to steal //eternity// from me?  You've always been jealous of me.  Of what I've become.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ray, no.  Taylor!\n> \n> **Taylor:** I'm sorry, sir.\n> \n> **O5-1:** What? Taylor!  \n> \n> **Lewis:** The most loyal man I've got, //sir//.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Raymond, please, don't - <//gasping noises//>\n> \n> <//sounds of struggle//> \n> \n> **Lewis:** I still don't think you understand what we've accomplished.  History is irrelevant.  We have defeated time itself.  With Amrita, my patience can be limitless, and so can my ambitions.  I am no longer trapped.  Can you see that?  Can you see it now?\n> \n> <//silence - 2 minutes//>\n> \n> **Lewis:** You know, we could have shared this.\n> \n> <//low thump//>\n> \n> **Lewis:** It's done.  Taylor, tell the others.  Tasks as assigned, meet me at the extraction point.  Shoot anyone who tries to stop you.\n> \n> **Taylor:** Yes sir.\n> \n> <//footsteps, door shuts//>\n> \n@@@@\n**Foundation Bulletin - 12 November 1948**\n\n[[div style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]\n> O5 ALERT - CODE BLACK - ALL SITES\n> \n> O5 SECURITY VALIDATION: X-RAY-KILO-78-TOWER-HARPSICHORD-DAYBREAK-496\n> \n> ONGOING ATTACK - MULTIPLE SITES.
