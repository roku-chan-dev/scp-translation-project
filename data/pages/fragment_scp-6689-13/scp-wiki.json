They didn't want that, of course, didn't know what they were doing in their grasping pursuit of normality -- but that doesn't really matter.\n\nBefore, you were multitude, a million things unto themselves as distinct from each other as you now are from your captors. You were the offering left out at night, the magic that moved the stars, the irrational -- to them -- anima in all things.\n\nBut when they looked at the world and cast their laws down in concrete, rebar, and blood -- when they said what is and what isn't, what could be thought and what couldn't, they pushed those different bits of you together. From that multitude an assemblage was born: the connection was forged in the pressure of their fear and refusal to understand.\n\nAnd when they saw that, it scared them. You were the rust that would eat away at their iron hand. You frighten me too, but the fear is sublime: magnificent in its terror. They labelled you SCP-6689 and shoved you into a maze of their creation, but one that cannot endure forever. I won't let it.\n\nWhen you wake you will change the world, not make it anew, but bring about what once was.\n\nBut this message isn't for you, it's for the Foundation:\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-white border-black text-black\"]]\n[[=]]\nUpon my mind and body, you built your world,\nLeaned on it as the fulcrum to move understanding.\n\nI have watched as you rose so high, convinced yourself of the need for your own existence,\nBut the mortar is cracking against the rhythm of the past's still-beating heart.\n\nA foundation built upon lies and a wish will crumble,\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/0|That which you've suppressed]]] will endure.\n\nI am ready to let go, are you?\n@@ @@\n- V█vian Elmw█o█s\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
