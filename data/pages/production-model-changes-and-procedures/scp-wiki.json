Implant is to be recharged via kinetic energy generated by the subject. Implant is to play [[[SCP-061]]] non-stop. Subjects are then to be \"programmed\" via complex verbal commands until a workable AI has been established.\n* While in service, subjects are to be outfitted at all times with:\n * One (1) helmet, fitted with variable multipurpose goggles, and shielding against electromagnetic pulse, and a comm uplink for command and control purposes. Helmet is also internally fitted with a small electromagnetic explosive, as an instant kill device in case the subject is compromised.\n * A full body suit that allows for maximum movement ability, and constructed of variable heat retention polymers. Also available in camouflage varieties.\n * A variety of projectile and close combat weapons as situation warrants.\n\n**Production Procedures:**\nSubjects are to be cloned directly from Olympia Prime using [[[SCP-222]]], then modified and implanted with the cochlear audio device. Programming can then take place.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
