Hangar is monitored remotely by Foundation operated cameras to prevent possible contact.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1759 is a 1942 Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber aircraft. The craft meets standard specifications. 4 guns are mounted in the nose, 2 in the rear section, and one mounted ventrally. The interior was restored at some point before its classification as an SCP. The restoration of the \"Lovely Lucy\" artwork first brought the abnormal influence to Foundation attention.\n\nPainted on the left side of the plane is a blonde figure with the text \"Lovely Lucy\" written below her. The aircraft flew 8 bombing missions over its three years of combat service. Across these missions, a total of 9 soldiers were killed by enemy aircraft fire. It was retired at the conclusion of the second World War with several other bombers of its class.\n\nSCP-1759 displays its unusual effect when an individual makes contact with the \"Lovely Lucy\" artwork. The individual will become unresponsive for several seconds, then appear to begin weeping. After this emotional response, they will demand they be allowed to pilot the plane.\n\nUpon entering the plane and taking the pilots seat, the affected individual displays sudden knowledge of basic takeoff and flight procedures despite lacking any previous training. The aircraft will take off from the landing strip, typically flying a total of 16 to 32 kilometers.\n\nVideo and audio monitoring have recorded the pilot entering an almost ecstatic state when in flight. After kilometer 8, their mood will become solemn and serious. Kilometer 16 tends to produce anger. 24 results in a repeat of the weeping state experienced during initial contact. Upon drawing close to kilometer 32, the subject will remove audio monitoring equipment and obscure the camera in the cockpit, stating \"Lucy doesn't want this to be recorded\". \n\nThroughout all of these states, the pilot appears to be talking to themselves. They are possibly communicating with SCP-1759.\n\nAfter flying the standard 32 km, the plane will engage its auto-pilot system and return to the hangar. The affected pilot has yet to return alive. Upon return, they are discovered with seemingly spontaneous wounds matching the impact of bullets. \n\nExamination of the deceased identified them as caused by a 7.9mm caliber bullet. Typical caliber type of the Messerschmitt Me 210's MG 17 machine gun. The cause of these wounds is currently unknown.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test records for SCP-1759\" hide=\"- Close Test Log\"]]\n\n**Test 1759-1** \n\n> **Test Subject:** D-9002.

Johnny...Pete...Bob...Sean...no, I understand. Must be a bad memory.\n> \n> **[Entering kilometer 16]**\n> \n> **D-9002:** Those bastards...just patched you up and sent you back out after all that. And then they just locked you up after the war! What kind of assholes were they? You deserve to be free to fly.\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** Unknown if SCP-1759 is displaying anger at its history, or D-9002 is simply reacting with anger over it. \n> \n> **[Entering kilometer 24]**\n> \n> **D-9002:** It's okay...I know, I hate that we have to say goodbye...don't talk like that. I'm sure they'll stop this from happening one day. Then you can fly all you want.\n> \n> **[Entering kilometer 30]**\n> \n> **D-9002:** Sorry, Doc. Lucy doesn't want this recorded. Goodbye.\n> \n> **[Subject removes audio equipment and obscures camera. Plane enters kilometer 32]**\n> \n> **Afterward:** Dr. Silver, final entry for test 1759-1.

Subject appeared to be smiling at time of death.\n>\n> <**End of test**>\n\n**Addendum:** Observation of SCP-1759 after flight has brought a series of tally marks on the right side to our attention. SCP-1759 appears to be keeping count of its occupants.\n\n**Addendum 2:** Routine remote monitoring has detected unidentified sound the night after D-9002's flight. Appears to be the sound of a woman weeping. Noise ceased the next day.\n\n**Test 1759-2**\n> \n> **Test Subject:** D-2395. Female. 33 years of age. Subject noted to be unusually empathetic for D-Class personnel. D-0215. Male. 37 years old.\n> \n> **Observing researcher:** Dr. █████ Silver\n> \n> **Foreword:** Dr. Silver, recording. Test 1759-2 will be much like the first, but D-2395 will have company. Fellow D-Class subject D-0215. D-0215 will not make contact with \"Lovely Lucy\", so we can determine if fatal effects are dependent on contact. To ensure video confirmation, we have hidden several camera outside and inside of SCP-1759.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 1:23 PM.>**\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** Good afternoon. D-2395 and D-0215. You have been informed of your purposes here today?\n> \n> **D-2395:** Yeah. Touch the plane.\n> \n> **D-0215:** And I'm supposed to not touch the thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** Very good.

She's talking to some voice in her head.\n> \n> **D-2395:** What's that? Oh, sure. Lucy thinks our friend here is cute. She says she wishes he'd talk to her too.[Laughter]\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** SCP-1759 appears to acknowledge passengers who don't touch the plane artwork. This implies some limited form of sentience. I wonder if that means it's aware of-\n> \n> **D-2395:** Yeah, she knows about the cameras. She says it's very rude to do that...she doesn't like you, Dr. Silver.\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** Noted.\n> \n> **[Entering kilometer 8]**\n> \n> **D-2395:** It's alright...well, I'll ask him. D-0215?

We need you to be observant when you reach the fatal length.\n> \n> **[Entering kilometer 24]**\n> \n> **D-2395:** Don't cry, sweetie...you're gonna make me cry too if you keep talking like that...no, I won't leave. I'll be here at the end. You shouldn't be alone.\n> \n> **[Sniffling sounds from rear cabin]**\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** ...D-0215, is that you?\n> \n> **D-0215:** Uh...no. That was the wind.\n> \n> **[Entering Kilometer 30]**\n> \n> **D-0215:** Dr. Silver, she's removed the recording equipment and covered the cabin camera.

I can't see what's doing it!\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** D-0215, Confirm your status.\n> \n> **D-0215:** I'm fine, Doctor. Whatever was attacking us is gone now.\n> \n> **Dr. Silver:** And the status of D-2395?\n> \n> **D-0215:** Sorry Doctor. She's dead. Right side of her head got blown completely off. The figure is gone too. We're returning to the hangar.\n> \n> **Afterword:** Dr. Silver, final entry for test 1759-2. D-0215's accompaniment confirms possible attached figures to SCP-1759. The figure in the cabin will be classified SCP-1759-1. The possible hostile entity classified as SCP-1759-2. Comments made by D-2395 implies SCP-1759 bears an animosity towards me.\n> \n> <**End of test**>  \n\n**Test 1759-3**\n> \n> **Test Subject:** D-0542. Male. 29 years of age.
