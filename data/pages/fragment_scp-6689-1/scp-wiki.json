As such, the complete isolation of SCP-6689 and SCP-6689-affiliated constructs within the noosphere is inadvisable. To ensure containment of SCP-6689 while retaining conceptualization of the aforementioned constructs, the entity has been sequestered in a __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/1|multicursal,]]]__ metaphysical, labyrinth within the noosphere. This containment construct is established through the use of an adapted //Trismegistus-Engine Totemic Signifier// -- designated //TETS-L// -- and utilizes SCP-6689's relation(s) to the Foundation and __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/11|self-referential]]]__ conceptualizations of containment to perpetuate the labyrinth, in accordance with principles founded upon the work of __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/6|Dr. Vivian Elmwoods.]]]__\n\nThus far, this construct has successfully prevented SCP-6689's expansion throughout the noosphere and halted its assimilation of distinct concepts into its meta-construct, while enabling the continued conceptualization of SCP-6689-affiliated data points. To ensure SCP-6689 cannot breach containment, targeted __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/4|antimemes]]]__ have been conceptually applied to the labyrinth's 'exit:' disallowing conceptual egression by entities within the construct, while still enabling the continued existence of extant lines of relational connection between the entity and the broader noosphere.\n\nThe potential application of a rhizomatic labyrinthine containment construct to replace the currently employed multicursal labyrinth is under investigation.\n\n**Description:**\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Adodo-maze/Maze.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n= __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/0|REMOVED FOR EFFICACY OF CONTAINMENT]]]__\n[[/div]]",
