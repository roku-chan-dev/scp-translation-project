Half the records read like stage directions. //(Dir. Sullivan hangs up, and then sits in front of POI-507-S19S)// Good morning, POI-507-S19S.\n\n**POI-507-S19S:** //(Yawns)// //That's// the designation you all gave me? Seems rather unoriginal...\n\n**Sullivan:** //(Glaring at POI-507-S19S)// Listen here, POI-507-S19S. Just because the rest of my Site has been chummy with you, doesn't mean I'm going to do the same. I take my work //very//  seriously, and rest assured that my questioning of you will be //very// thorough.\n\n**POI-507-S19S:** That's...not reassuring--\n\n**Sullivan:** Last night, our automated security systems recorded that SCP-698 was removed from its containment cell, Grim left his quarters, and the security cameras in the hallway and this room experienced audio-visual malfunctions. //(Looks directly at POI-507-S19S)// Did you have anything to do with these?\n\n**POI-507-S19S:** //(Grimaces, before shaking his head)// I was in this room the entire time.\n\n**Sullivan:** Uh-huh. And what is it that you put away into your robe's pocket, when the cameras came back on?\n\n**POI-507-S19S:** //(Laughs)// I wish I could tell you, but you see, I can't, because--\n\n//(POI-507-S19S vanishes; Dir. Sullivan sighs deeply, and puts her hands on the side of her head)//\n\n**Sullivan:** ...Shit.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ MESSAGE FROM THE FOUNDATION OVERWATCH COUNCIL\n[[/=]]\nUpon review of all of the known facts given in Disciplinary Report S19S-28052023-507, and after deliberation between its members and those of the Ethics Committee, the O5 Council has deemed to **not pursue major disciplinary actions** for the staff of Site-19-S.\n\nOur reasons are twofold:\n\n# Site-19-S' staff was not properly equipped or trained to handle an SCP-507 variant manifestation.\n# Despite their unorthodox approach towards POI-507-S19S, all staff involved were able to glean a wealth of useful information from the subject that could potentially aid us, should they ever return to this universe.\n\nHowever, we have also deemed it appropriate to mandate the following changes to Site-19-S' structure and staff:\n\n* Bi-monthly mandatory \"sapient anomaly approach\" training\n* Bi-monthly mandatory \"Task Force priority list\" training\n* Bi-monthly mandatory \"Keep Your Site Clean\" training\n\nFailure to abide by these mandates may result in reconsideration of disciplinary action.\n\nSecure. Contain. Protect.\n\n- The O5 Council\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author = newnykacolaquantum, aaleaf]]\n=====\nThe Offshoot and associated characters, settings, and elements are creations of the SCPeeps team, and licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
