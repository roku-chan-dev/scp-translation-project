I'm a bit of a picky creature, so I need a family with plenty of affection and expertise. I'm not great with other animal friends or children, so I need ample space, snacks, a playground, and some good reading material like //The Communist Manifesto//. While I might be a little high-maintenance, once we bond, I can be the most lovable companion you'll ever have!\n\nI enjoy foods other foxes like, such as meat, fruits, or fox feed. I might try to steal your cigarettes or alcohol, but those things aren't good for me, so please store them out of my reach! I need several walks and exercise sessions each day. I prefer libraries over forests or parks, so I suggest looking into pet-friendly libraries or book cafes where we can spend time together!\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;\"]]\nWhen I get upset or flustered, I sometimes cause hallucinations for people or animals around me. For instance, I might appear as a mysterious Korean woman or create ghostly phenomena. My caregivers explain that this is my way of protecting myself since I'm naturally timid. So, **please** don't scare or anger me—something truly frightening might happen!\n\nAs I said, I need plenty of attention, affection, and a long time to build trust. Please think carefully before deciding to adopt me! I've already experienced the pain of being returned multiple times, and I sincerely hope to find a family where I can finally feel safe and loved. I'm looking for someone without other animals or young children who isn't heavily involved in running a business and has a spacious yard, a well-stocked library, and the resources and patience to provide me with a stable, caring home.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nImportant Things About Me!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\n* Genetically, I am closer to foxes from Northeast Asia, particularly Korean foxes, rather than North American red foxes. In fact, it's said that Korean foxes were nearly extinct at one point.  \n\n* As mentioned, I can cause hallucinations. Still, it's not medical—it's more like the feeling of being haunted by a ghost. That said, it's not overly threatening! People compare it to experiencing a mild nightmare.  \n\n* I love books! I especially enjoy ideological academic works or papers like //The Communist Manifesto//. Whether or not I truly understand the content is my little secret.  \n* [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;\"]]\n* I also have a taste for cigarettes and alcohol, so be careful not to let me snag them! However, I absolutely love pig or cow liver, whether raw or boiled, and I can eat as much as I like! Just make sure I get proper exercise to balance it out.  \n\n* I'm introverted and don't like other animals. I'm especially terrified of foxhounds or Jindo dogs that are known for hunting foxes, and I don't get along with other foxes either. However, I can tolerate cats or crows and coexist with them in a distant, indifferent way.  \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes From My Foster Parents!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n> //Hoya was a good girl. She was more behaved and friendlier than my fifteen-year-old son. But when she discovered that my father runs a large trading company, Hoya began growling at him and refused to let him get close. This made my father mad, and we couldn't raise her anymore. Pity.//\n> \n> ~Jeremy Thompson\n\n> //I'm sorry, but a fox that steals <The Communist Manifesto> is just too conspicuous for within the Boring Township.//\n> \n> ~A.A\n\n> //I swear, Hoya was my best friend. We were ideologically aligned, and she even patiently sat through all my AWCY activities. But, uh... after the whole mess between the Three-Portlands cops and my crew, I couldn't see Hoya as just an animal anymore. She suddenly transformed into a woman and jumped the cops. They wet themselves, foaming at the mouth, all freaking out. My boyfriend has been terrified of Hoya ever since, so I had no choice. I'm sorry, Hoya!//\n> \n> ~Max Eckhart\n\n\n> Wait right there.\n> \n> ~???\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSender: Lilac Kim\nRecipient(s): Faeowynn Wilson\nDate: 2024/4/1\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHi, Fae!\n\nI have something to say about Hoya. Of course, she's still a gentle and adorable darling, but troubling rumors about her are growing. People are saying she's a possessed fox or a devil fox highly trained by an extremist terrorist group. Naturally, we don't know where Hoya came from either—she just appeared out of nowhere in Boring Township. Strangely, however, such bad rumors are spreading about an animal that can't speak and is simply looking for a good home. Could you look into this for me?\n\nFrom the bottom of all our hearts, Lilac.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSender: Faeowynn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Lilac Kim\nDate: 2024/4/1\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHello!  \n\nI've done some digging, but no one seems to know anything about Hoya. Even the higher-ups couldn't give a definitive answer. However, I did stumble upon something peculiar.  \n\nAround 4 A.M. last night, some suspicious individuals were lingering near Hoya's enclosure. They seemed Korean, but I didn't recognize their faces. When security approached, they suddenly emitted a red light and disappeared. None of us recognized them either. Do you know which group they belong to?  \n\n**P.S.:** Lilac. There was some Korean writing on the response facility's main gate. What does it mean?\n\n[[=]]\n> [[size 130%]]우리 하나의 상처는 우리 모두의 상처다[[/size]][[footnote]] Translator's note: An injury to one is an injury to all[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||~ Wildlife Solutions CCTV Footage||\n\n@@ @@\n\n//April 2, 12:09 A.M. A brief red light flashes toward the terrestrial animal enclosures. Awakened animals begin to howl. Four shadows appear: a tall man, a skinny man, a short woman, and a tall woman. When the tall woman waves, the electric lights go out, and green flames flicker. They stand in front of Hoya's enclosure and begin to talk.//\n\n**Seoyul:** That Bookburner's weapon turned our leader into... this...\n\n//The short woman begins to sob. The tall man pats her back and lowers his head. Hoya wakes up, wagging her tail and letting out sharp barks. The short woman cries even louder.//\n\n**Baek Byeonggil:** She's still alive.\n\n**Seoyul:** That's no different!\n\n**Moon Kinam:** I'm sorry..\n\n//Hoya barks even louder, darting around inside the enclosure. The tall man waves and the lock on the enclosure clicks open. Hoya bolts out, wagging her tail, rubbing against the short woman's legs, rolling on the grass, and running around energetically. The woman, teary-eyed, starts to smile..//\n\n**Seoyul:** Can't we just take her back? Please?\n\n**Moon Kinam:** Yool, we can't keep an animal - the fur, the noise...\n\n//Brief silence.//\n\n**Moon Kinam:** No! I didn't mean the leader is an animal...\n\n**Seoyul:** //Sobs//\n\n//Hoya looks up at the crying woman, whimpering, and licks her with her tongue. The sobbing grows more intense. The men, with conflicted expressions, shed tears as well. However, the tall woman remains relatively unaffected, showing little emotional response.//\n\n**Seoyul:** Morrígan! Do something!\n\n**Morrígan:** Sorry, but I'm not interested ever since things turned out this way.\n\n**Seoyul:** What...?\n\n**Moon Kinam:** Nonsense! Morrígan! We are brethren of blood!\n\n//As an argument breaks out, Hoya lets out a low whimper, visibly frightened. The fox tucks her tail between her legs and howls. The short woman picks Hoya up, cradling her like a baby, gently patting and soothing her with a lullaby-like rhythm.//\n\n**Morrígan:** I wasn't interested in your anarcho-syndicalism b.s. in your first place. I was merely indulging in your unfaltering will.\n\n**Moon Kinam:** You bitch...\n\n**Morrígan:** Well, good luck! Ta-ta!\n\n//The tall woman transforms into green flames, her figure distorting before she morphs into a raven and flies away. The remaining three stand there, staring blankly after her. Hoya, cradled in the short woman's arms, barks at the departing raven.//\n\n**Seoyul:** This can't be... The leader, vice leader Kang-naru, and then now Morrígan...\n\n**Moon Kinam:** What? Where's Kang?\n\n**Seoyul:** [[[amaterasu-to-tsukiakari|Hwiyeong]]] escaped, so Kang followed too; now he's missing as well.\n\n**Moon Kinam:** Damn. Sorry...\n\n**Seoyul:** What's gonna happen to the Hand....?\n\n**Baek Byeonggil:** Don't worry, Yul. We can do it.\n\n//At that moment, Hoya notices a stray cat passing by and starts howling. The sound alerts the Wildlife Solution security guards, who are eating donuts and listening to music. They blow their whistles and begin chasing after the group.//\n\n**Guard 1:** Stop right there, criminal scum!\n\n**Guard 2:** Stop! You violated animal rights!!\n\n**Seoyul:** ...Oblivion.\n\n//The woman releases Hoya from her arms. Hoya lands on the ground, wagging her tail and letting out sharp barks. The woman wipes her tears and waves her hand. Hoya circles around her, rubbing against her legs. The man forms a magical symbol with his hands, and the space distorts, creating a \"path.\"//\n\n**Moon Kinam:** Yul! Hop on!\n\n**Seoyul:** Sorry, leader...\n\n//All three step onto the path. In an instant, a flash of light erupts, and the space writhes as the transition begins. When the movement ends, only a faint, lingering cry remains..//\n\n**Seoyul:** Leader! Be happy there!\n\n**Guard 1:** Damn...! Lost them!\n\n**Guard 2:** Those animal rights abusers! It must be those who kidnap animals and put them on auction.\n\n//Seeing the guards, Hoya immediately flops onto her back and wags her tail. One of the guards, smiling warmly, begins to rub Hoya's belly. Hoya enthusiastically licks the guard's face, and both guards laugh heartily.//\n\n**Guard 2:** Oh! Who's a good girl? You are!\n\n@@ @@\n= **<End of log>**\n@@ @@\n\n> **Note:** Later, a large raven that had flown into a glass window near the main gate was rescued.

The fox was the de facto head of the \"Dinodon's Hand,\" the Far East branch of the Serpent's Hand. Yes - for some, the freedom fighters; for some, a terrorist - the Serpent's Hand.\n\nWe've chased the Hand for a long time. But repeatedly, the person called Hoya failed us every time. Hoya... she's one of the few demon foxes left on this earth, a powerful psychic, a shapeshifter, and a strong physique. You might have heard of this species.\n\nHowever, in a fight with the GOC, the Hand was hit with a psychic attack. Hoya was hit, and she regressed; you'll probably know that much. It didn't work on everyone else, but Hoya is primarily a beast. That blow was sufficient to make her mentally retarded to the intelligence level of a red fox. Her shapeshifting abilities also disappeared.\n\nWhen you acquired the fox, we initially considered killing or containing her, at the very least. But we changed our minds, as there was a possibility her abilities could suddenly re-emerge. Our finest [[[scp-756-ko|psychologist]]] warned of the dangers posed by uncontrolled mental anomalies.\n\nWe decided to leave Hoya in your care. Records revealed that this beast called Hoya was abandoned by her mother, which explained her severe childhood deprivation, hatred for her parent, and aggressive behavior. But at the core of it all was a lack that no one could ever truly fulfill.\n\n\nNow that Hoya has regressed back to being a mere animal, entrusting her to you will ensure that such deprivation no longer exists. You cherish all animals dearly, and with your dedication, you could fill that void in Hoya's heart and even train her.\n\nAnd that assumption? It proved to be correct.\n\nWild red foxes are notoriously difficult to domesticate—certainly more so than dogs. Foxes lack a concept of pack structure, are highly feral, and possess a strong hunting instinct. You know these traits better than I do, so I'll leave that point aside. Yet, Hoya shows a level of sociability far above the average fox. She wags her tail for anyone. She even does \"paw,\" \"sit,\" hell, and even \"bang.\"\n\nThus, Hoya's hostility has been eliminated. And something else has been eliminated, too: the Dinodon's Hand. They are in rapid decline, especially after the disappearance of Hoya and the powerful Type Green Morrígan ingen Ernmas. Frustrated? But you've done your part. You protected and brought happiness to a single beast.\n\nWhen it is confirmed that you have fully tamed Hoya, I intend to adopt her under my name.\n\nThank you, as always.\n\n[[>]]\n,,This message has been sent directly.,,\n[[/>]]\n----",
