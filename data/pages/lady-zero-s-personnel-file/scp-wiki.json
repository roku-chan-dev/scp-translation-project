I am currently a college student with a great interest in bettering my writing skill, which is why I'm getting a minor in creative writing. I've written a few SCPs so far, and I'm so happy to be among the great writers of this site. I am always looking to improve my skill, so please give feedback on any and all of my works here! I am always open to being messaged any questions, comments, or just casual conversation topics, so please, feel free to smash that \"Write Private Message\" button.\n> \n> I'm happy to be here on this website. Thank you all for giving me a proper creative outlet where I can actually feel like people are enjoying my works.\n> \n> Much love,\n> //Lady Zero//\n-----\n**__Known Works:__**\n\nThe following are categorized by order of discovery.\n\n* [[[SCP-3778|SCP-3778 \"We Are Possum. We Are Legion.\"]]]\n> **Authorial Commentary:** Anomalous grapes that make opossums gain sapience. My favorite animals are opossums so I figured that'd be a lovely thing to write about. This was my first article that actually managed to //stay// on the mainsite (and my third ever written) so I feel rather proud of this one.\n\n* [[[SCP-4994|SCP-4994 \"An Ideal Foundation\"]]]\n> **Authorial Commentary:** Quite possibly the best article I have written or will write for the Foundation. A parallel, more successful version of the Foundation that is used by the OTL Foundation for advice. Has the highest rating of all my articles.\n\n* [[[SCP-4899|SCP-4899 \"Blackbody\"]]]\n> **Authorial Commentary:** An anomalous radio source from 144 light years away seems to be transmitting photos of places about to experience disaster. I got the name and idea from a Death Grips song.\n\n* [[[SCP-4250|SCP-4250 \"Colorful Pens With Thematic Ends\"]]]\n> **Authorial Commentary:** Pens designed by an AWCY member that have compulsory writing effects, with different colors corresponding to different themes. The first one I've written since I moved to college. Was inspired by a book I read when I was a kid.\n\nMore works are expected to follow. Foundation assets are recommended to continue watching for increases in POI-78559's writing proficiency, and to view any new works written. Upvotes encouraged, //only if// such works merit them.\n\n**Secure, Contain, Protect.**\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
