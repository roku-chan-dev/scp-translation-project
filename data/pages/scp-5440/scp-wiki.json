Two security personnel are to remain present in the pavilion at all times to prevent civilian exposure. \n\nAll public and personal records containing evidence regarding SCP-5440 are to be confiscated, destroyed, and/or discredited; all witnesses will be amnesticisized and released.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\nSCP-5440 was a phenomenon affecting a Scarlet Bush (//Hamelia patens//) located in the University of Florida's botanical garden. SCP-5440 caused the bush to spontaneously combust and remain burning for approximately two and a half hours. This process did no damage to the affected bush, nor the surrounding vegetation. During the duration of SCP-5440, a disembodied voice (designated SCP-5440-1) could be heard near the bush. SCP-5440-1 spoke in fluent English and was able to engage in conversation. The process that created the SCP-5440 phenomenon is currently unknown.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nOn 2020/04/21 at 9:45 AM GMT, SCP-5440 began and all attempts by campus staff to extinguish the fire were met with failure. At 10:00 AM, SCP-5440-1 began vocalizing the \"Lord's prayer\" and continued to do so repeatedly for one and a half hours. The Foundation became aware of SCP-5440 through rumors of a \"talking bush\", spread through UoF student's social media accounts. It was at this time that a Foundation containment team was dispatched to conceal and recover SCP-5440.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Incident Report__**\nInitial containment procedures were established by Preliminary Containment Team Charlie-24 at 11:30 AM. At this time, personnel attempted to communicate with SCP-5440-1; the following is a transcript of the encounter.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"❏ Interview Audio Log ❏\" hide=\"❐ Interview Audio Log ❐ \"]]\n\n**2020/04/21 11:45 AM GMT**\n\n**Interviewer:** Junior Containment Specialist Victor Redfield\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5440-1\n-----\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Redfield:** H-hello, I'd like to speak with you, if you're done with the praying.\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** God?

I don't understand, Lord. Have you not heard my prayers?\n\n**Redfield:** What are you talking about?\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Gran, she done tole us... She done said t'would work! I prayed at the firebush, just like she say, and you done answered... y-you must be the Lord.\n\n**Redfield:** Kid listen, I'm not God. I don't know what's happening here, but I know that for certain.\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Please, I need help! My sister done gotten hurt, an' she ain't right. My pa, he ain't here, an' I don't rightly ken what needs doin'. Please... Victor.\n\n**Redfield:** I can't help if I don't know where you are.\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** I'm right here! Right in front of your bush, uh, you.\n\n**Redfield:** Kid, I'm in fron–, where is the bush?\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Out back behind the house, of course.\n\n**Redfield:** And //where// is your home?\n\n**SCP-5440-1** We're stayin' in Hogtown, north side of the old Arredondo Grant. Least that's what pa's always sayin'. Please I ain't got ti–\n\n**Redfield:** Arredondo? Is that Florida? What date is it, kid?\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Why does that– Uh, fourth ah August, the year of our... uh, 1832.\n\n**Redfield:** Jesus. \n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Is he with you? He can surely save Annabelle!\n\n**Redfield:** No, I.. Um, listen, kid, I don't know if I can help you. You're... Uh, really far away.\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Please, she's bleedin' real bad! I done tore one of ma's old sheets like I done see Doc Willems do, but I– I can't get it to stop!\n\n**Redfield:** What happened?\n\n**SCP-5440:** She fell– she fell on the garden stake. I done pull out of her leg but... the bleedin' won't stop, and pa done gone 'round to– he aint fixin' to be back for at least two nights!\n\n**Redfield:** Shit... Um, I can– //might//, be able to help you. But you have to listen to me carefully.\n\n//[**Redacted for Brevity:** Junior Specialist Redfield explains to SCP-5440, in detail, rudimentary wound care utilizing objects found within SCP-5440-1's residence. After 35 minutes, SCP-5440-1 successfully stitches and dresses the wound.]//\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** I can't thank you enough, Victor, you done saved Annabelle!\n\n**Redfield:** I don't know about that, kid, you did all the work; I just helped you along.\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** Never you mind that, mister.

I said the prayer, 'course. Jus' like Gran always said to.\n\n\n**Redfield:** Could you tell me this prayer?\n\n**SCP-5440-1:** I ain't seein' a reason not to, you done saved my sister. Gran done told it to me like this–\n\n//[SCP-5440-1 begins speaking an unknown language[[footnote]]Foundation etymologists established the language has its roots in Spanish, Arabic, and Latin.[[/footnote]] for approximately two minutes, at which time SCP-5440 extinguishes and the anomalous phenomenon terminates.]//\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFollowing this event, the bush affected by SCP-5440 was kept under surveillance for additional anomalous phenomena. After one week SCP-5440 was re-designated neutralized. Victor Redfield was reprimanded for improper interview protocol and placed on a one-week paid leave. Due to the nature of the incident, this disciplinary action will not be included on Victor Redfield's permanent record.\n\nAttempts to recreate SCP-5440 using the incantation provided by SCP-5440-1 have met with failure. The Thaumaturgy Division's analysis revealed no adherent thaumaturgical value to the incantation, indicating an unknown factor or prerequisite must be required. Testing has been abandoned indefinitely.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5439]]] | SCP-5440 | [[[SCP-5441]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
