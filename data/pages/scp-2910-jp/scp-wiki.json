The containment unit is equipped with three Scranton Reality Anchors and six Lang Siphons, which are to be replaced at regular intervals. Instances are to be fed 1/4 portion of a standard adult humanoid diet three times per day. Instances are prohibited from leaving their containment unit.\n\nShould an uncontained instance of SCP-2910-JP be found in a location accessible from baseline reality, the anti-reality alteration instance unit assigned to the Site is to be immediately utilized for capture. Attempts should be made to secure it alive if possible, otherwise the instance is to be terminated remotely.\n\nBased on guidelines established in Article 125 of the Hudson River Accord, which denotes the rights and duties that mild Type Blues and pseudo-Type Blues, who do not possess the ability to express EVE in the form of physical entities, wormholes, or other specified forms, have in mass society. As a result, the former SCP-2910-JP-A group was excluded from special containment procedures as of October 31, 2001. The wording in this report has been revised to no longer include the name \"SCP-2910-JP-A.\"\n\n+++ Description\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=wonder.jpg|caption=SCP-2910-JP-1, the only instance of SCP-2910-JP within Foundation containment. |width=210px\n]]\n\nSCP-2910-JP are anomalous entities with an appearance similar to various small mammals of the order //Carnivora//, possessing strong individual differences across each instance. Additionally, the tissue structure does not match that of any living organism existing in nature, and tissue fragments taken from instances quickly disintegrate into ash.\n\nAt present, there is only one instance of SCP-2910-JP in Foundation custody. The instance is 32cm long and 1.7kg in weight, with silvery-white fur and blue eyes. To date, the Foundation has recorded the existence of at least 28 different instances of SCP-2910-JP, some of which appear to be alive and uncontained, but are inaccessible from baseline reality. Their current locations are unknown.\n\nSCP-2910-JP possess intelligence equivalent to that of an adult human, with each individual possessing a distinct personality. Instances are capable of speaking through unknown bodily processes, and always utilize language that is understandable to the intelligent listener. It also appears that instances are able to communicate remotely through currently unknown means.\n\nThe main manifestation of SCP-2910-JP's anomalous properties occurs in human females. If communication is attempted between an instance of SCP-2910-JP and a female subject, and an agreement is reached between them to comply with certain unknown criteria, the subject [[footnote]]Prior to the revision of Containment Procedures, these individuals were referred to as SCP-2910 -JP-A.[[/footnote]] gains limited [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology|thaumatological]]] properties, resulting in a condition known as Pseudo-Type Blue. This subject is capable of manifesting EVE through thaumatically appropriate methods utilizing ontoglyphs/kinetoglyphs, or other informal ritual tools.[[footnote]]SCP-2910-JP instances appear to transmit partial knowledge of these techniques. [[/footnote]] However, there have been no confirmed cases in which a subject manifested such a high-concentration of EVE that requires some kind of substance as a catalyst, and the thaumaturgy that can be used is at a level that can be achieved only by psychological modulation, such as intangible rays, heat, etc. It is assumed that this is limited to things that take the form of propulsion, etc. The backlash upon manifestation is assumed to be taken care of by the accompanying SCP-2910-JP instance, and it appears to be offset to a scale that is unrecognizable from the outside through the reality modification exercised by the instance. No means have been discovered for the subject to escape from its influence, other than through their own death. Furthermore, if the female targeted by the instance is a natural Type Blue, the results of the modifications the instance makes to the target will manifest as an increase in the EVE capacity that can be exercised.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=object.jpg|caption=A broom produced by SCP-2910-JP. |width=170px|align=left\n]]\n\nSCP-2910-JP instances possess reality-altering abilities similar to humanoid entities classified as Type Greens. As observed to date, instances have spontaneously produced brooms, black robes, and wands that can be used as ritual tools. In addition, SCP-2910-JP instances apply visual and auditory concealment effects to both themselves and the corresponding Pseudo-Type Blue, as well as a protective film that blocks thermal energy and mechanical energy below a certain level. It appears possible to perform the deployment of these abilities separately. The potential limits of SCP-2910-JP's reality-altering abilities are unknown, and no additional experiments are permitted at this time. Instances of SCP-2910-JP are generally devoted to the Pseudo-Type Blue instances they have signed agreements with, and will save or attempt to save them from critical situations, even if they themselves suffer fatal damage. Multiple examples have been identified.\n\n----\n\n+++ Addendum.2910-JP.1 > 9/11 incident Video Recording Log\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=town.png|caption=Manhattan, 2001/09/14. |width=210px\n]]\n\nOn September 11, 2001, [[[chaos-insurgency-hub|GoI-003(“Chaos Insurgency”)]]] led an attack [[[scp-2911-jp|during the Manhattan Dimensional Collapse Terrorist Incident]]], which resulted in the island being temporarily transported to another dimension. This led to the discovery of SCP-2910-JP within the island of Manhattan. The following is a video record of the operation to retake Manhattan conducted by joint forces of the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition and supporting organizations including the Horizon Initiative on September 14-15, 2001[[footnote]]2001/ Database code for the period 09/11 to 09/15: The outline of the Manhattan Crisis timeline is recorded in the [[[SCP-2911-JP]]] document.[[/footnote]] where the clear involvement of various SCP-2910-JP instances has been confirmed. It should be noted that there is a high possibility that there were instances of SCP-2910-JP at the scene of the incident that were not recorded in these videos.\n\nFor convenience, the three instances that consistently interacted with Foundation personnel in the video recordings are designated as SCP-2910-JP-1 to SCP-2910-JP-3, respectively.

The wear and tear on equipment from trans-dimensional travel remains within the expected range.\n\n**Pauseman:** Okay. The 1st Corps, including N-7, which is the core of the Manhattan rescue team, is advancing toward the World Trade Center (WTC) in the southwest. Our 2nd unit, Zeta-23, is in charge of suppressing the terrorists in the center of the island.\n\n**Ο16-Beta:** The smell of sulfur is the same as when we inspected the area on the first day of the attack... It's suffocating. There must still be a lot of demons here.\n\n**House:** Yes. As we have confirmed, your primary job as Ο-16 is to protect the unevacuated population from the demonic entities summoned by the Insurgency.\n\n**Ζ23-Beta:** I hope that's all you need.

I had heard about it, but seeing it like this gives it a different meaning.\n\n**Pauseman:** Don't be so cavalier, House. Those terrorists are bringing all kinds of abnormal beings into Manhattan. The advance units have already taken down hostile forces around the dimensional contact point with heavy casualties, but from there onwards there are still incomprehensible beings roaming about.\n\n**Ζ23-Alpha:** We must protect our people from all of that. I always tell all my team members, always check the surrounding situation and do not hesitate to strike first against entities that may take hostile action.\n\n**Ο16-Beta:** Oh, what is that? There's something behind the giant entity.\n\n//[Ο16-Beta points to the rear of UE-1109-B. Three Pseudo-Type Blue wearing black clothes are flying behind UE-1109-B.

They're riding brooms in the 21st century.\n\n**Pauseman:** Can you estimate the risk?\n\n**Ο16-Beta:** Currently, they appear to be watching the movement of energy entities. Depending on our relationship with them, there is a good chance that they will become hostile to us.\n\n**Pauseman:** Well then, its settled. As part of our mission, we will track two types of anomalies. Considering the target's size and maneuverability in the air, if we leave them alone, there is a high possibility that they will eventually attack the WTC. We don't want to put any unnecessary stress on N-7.\n\n**House:** Okay, Pauseman. For the time being, the witches' destination seems to overlap with our own. Let's follow their movements while continuing to exterminate demons.\n\n**Ζ23-Alpha:** Understood. Z-23 and Ο-16, let's continue through Greenwich Village.\n\n**Ο16-Zeta:** Don't overtake me!

All I see is a ball of light. I can also definitely hear a voice.\n\n//[The sphere of light rises about 5 meters above the alley and dims its brightness. When the light disappears, Huxley, who has become Pseudo-Type Blue, is present. She wears a black robe over frayed clothing, holds a wand with a simple design, and appears to be levitating by generating propulsive force from the broom which she is straddling.

It's fine if it's revenge against terrorists, but what do you plan to do if the target is an ordinary citizen?\n\n**Pauseman:** Oh! Have there been more potential adversaries? It would be inconvenient if that thing merged with a giant energy entity.\n\n**Ο16-Beta:** What do we do? Do you want to continue north? Or grab that witch?\n\n**House:** Hmm, the demon is relatively calm, so I think we can split up here. O-16 and I will head towards the child. Pauseman, go with Z-23 and the others  towards the monster. How's that sound?\n\n**Ζ23-Epsilon:** Wait, isn't it dangerous to just randomly divide your forces in the same place where a bloody battle took place a few hours ago?\n\n**Ο16-Gamma:** We should prioritize protecting the refugees. Even with the new anomaly, she was clearly quite hurt. We shouldn't lose her.\n\n**Pauseman:** It seems impossible for both units to chase both rabbits.

Whether they die at the hands of a witch or were already dead for some time, it doesn't matter.\n\n**Ο16-Alpha:** That's possible. The Insurgency would not devote its live personnel resources to such chores as live-fire sniping.\n\n**House:** You're still a young kid, a real murderer is too-- oops! That's another witch!\n\n//[A Pseudo-Type Blue appears briefly on camera flying away from left to right 30 meters in front of Ο-16. Immediately after, a [[[goc-supplemental-equipment|Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis]]] chases the subject across the camera's field of view.]// \n\n**Ο16-Beta:** They're coming all the way to Manhattan and they're still hunting mooks here?\n\n**Ο16-Zeta:** Is that one of the remnants of the Strike Team who were killed by the big guys around noon?

Although she wasn't as young as that girl, she still looked young.\n\n**Ο16-Alpha:** I've heard the Coalition sent a small number of orange suits into this operation, but I don't want them to deal with the targets first. Let's strengthen our tracking of instances moving forward.\n\n**Ο16-Beta:** We shouldn't waste time. There are less than 12 hours left until the GOC cease rescuing the survivors of the attack and carry out Pizzicato to prevent further expansion of the dimensional anomaly.\n\n**House:** Does that mean that if one of our units fails, us, that girl, and the island itself will all be blown away? That's terrifying. By the way, there's something I'm curious about in regard to these witches.\n\n**Ο16-Gamma:** What is it?\n\n**House:** So, I get the impression, from the few witches I've seen so far, that all of them are pretty unaccustomed to flying. Providing propulsive energy with EVE may be a little too difficult for people who don't have Type Blue qualities.\n\n**Ο16-Alpha:** So, are these examples just improvised Pseudo-Type Blues?\n\n**House:** Probably. And if that's the case, I think we have to protect them first. It's too dangerous to let them fly around like that.\n\n**Ο16-Zeta:** In the end, it's just an extension of securing the object, right? It's business as usual for us. ...If only this was a place where we didn't have to bring out the Coalition's big robots.\n\n//[Milk-white smoke descends in front of Huxley.

I think it would be better for everyone to stay safe if we all grouped up.\n\n//[The individual known as Alison (PoI-4056) appears to raise a wand and transfer thaumaturgic energy to all of the assembled Pseudo-Type Blues. When the video is enlarged, it can be confirmed that the transferor's energy is generated from SCP-2910-JP-3, which is sitting on the shoulder of the subject. The instance has a mixed white and purple coat and is generally similar in appearance to a ferret, but with large earflaps and red eyes.]// \n\n**PoI-4056:** Thanks, guys. We're in this together from here on out. Right, Hexa?\n\n//[SCP-2910-JP-3 shows no significant reaction.

The Empire State Building can be seen in the foreground, and the Twin Towers can be seen in the background. An unidentified organic structure (designated as UE-1111) with a thread-like appearance can be observed entwined at the top of 1 WTC.\n\n**[04:01]** UE-1109-C turns into smoke and charges towards the Empire State Building from the right side of the screen (western part of the island). Other UE-1109 instances [[footnote]] A total of 6 different UE-1109 instances, designated UE-1109-A through F, respectively, were confirmed to have been present at various locations on Manhattan Island throughout the incident on 09/13/01 through 09/15/01.[[/footnote]] are circling around the building in an amorphous state. 23 Pseudo-Type Blues are confirmed to be tracking UE-1109-C. When the video is enlarged, it can be confirmed that all are accompanied by their respective SCP-2910-JP instance.\n\n**[04:07]** Smoke from UE-1109 instances gathers above the building and they begin to merge with each other. Red clouds in the sky provide red energy similar to lightning strikes, and additional opalescent smoke from the upper floors of the building feeds into the instances.\n\n**[04:12]** The smoke instantly dissipates, and a gigantic energy entity (designated UE-1109-Σ) appears, estimated to be over 350m long. The instance combines the physical characteristics of all previously confirmed UE-1109 instances.\n\n**[04:14]** UE-1109-Σ begins to take action. It focuses black colored energy between the two horns of its head, attracting the Pseudo-Type Blue swarm flying around the instance. The subjects move away from the instance in a controlled, curved trajectory.\n\n**[04:16]** UE-1109-Σ's third and fourth right arms extend towards the Pseudo-Type Blue swarm, who disperse. The arm makes contact with three of the subjects, immediately disintegrating them.\n\n**[04:19]** The Pseudo-Type Blues remain spread out and fly around UE-1109-Σ. It targets one of the subjects and fires red light projectiles from its tentacles. The projectiles miss their original target and shoots down Foundation Recording Helicopter Unit 6, which becomes a large amount of Cack Ash.\n\n**[04:21]** Most of the Pseudo-Type Blues lower their altitude and enter the gap between the buildings, making them invisible to the first helicopter. The lower part of the UE-1109-Σ's torso turns into a thin line of smoke, which spreads to fill the gaps between the buildings.[[footnote]]It maintained an altitude of approximately 150m, and did not appear to have caused any obvious damage to the ground or structures.[[/footnote]]\n\n**[04:24]** The Pseudo-Type Blue swarm continues to disperse while maintaining a low altitude. One of the subjects is briefly seen surfacing approximately 170 meters from the Empire State Building. The subject in question is then engulfed by the rising smoke of UE-1109-Σ and disappears.\n\n**[04:28]** The Pseudo-Type Blue swarms that have surfaced individually from various parts of the skyscraper maintain high altitude and begin gathering once more. The number of subjects visible in the footage has been reduced to 11. UE-1109-Σ rolls up its smoky body.\n\n**[04:30]** The image around the WTC becomes distorted. It appears that a new dimensional anomaly has started occurring at the southern tip of Manhattan Island.[[footnote]]After the on-site inspection following the conclusion of the incident, it appears that this dimensional anomaly was generated by GoI-003 forces within the WTC. It is presumed that the aim was to cut off enemy reinforcements from outside the tower.[[/footnote]] The battle between UE-1109-Σ and the Pseudo-Type Blue swarm continues.\n\n**[04:33]** The Pseudo-Type Blue swarm regroups at a distance from UE-1109-Σ and approaches the first helicopter. The thaumaturgical energy emitted by a group of Pseudo-Type Blues led by PoI-4056 converges in the air.\n\n**[04:34]** A blue ray is emitted from the converged EVE mass and hits UE-1109-Σ directly. Instance becomes frightened and begins to retreat toward Union Square to flee the beam. The Pseudo-Type Blues maintain the EVE mass and move forward.\n\n**[04:36]** PoI-4056, who was at the front of the group, suddenly begins moving at a speed exceeding its previous maximum speed and charges into the abdomen of the UE-1109-Σ instance. When the video is enlarged, the subject appears to have fallen from the broom and is propelled by some other unknown power source. Two other Pseudo-Type Blues follow. The EVE mass disappears and the light beam stops.\n\n**[04:37]** UE-1109-Σ begins repositioning itself. PoI-4056 penetrates its abdomen, and two other Pseudo-Type Blue pursue it, bypassing the instance to the left and right. WTC is no longer observable except for part of the 1st Tower (including UE-1111) visible near the center of the screen.\n\n**[04:40]** UE-1109-Σ, which changed direction to face of the three Pseudo-Type Blues that had moved away to an unseeable distance, recognizes the presence of the dimensional anomaly, transforms into a smoky form, and rushes toward 1 WTC.\n\n**[04:41]** The completed dimensional anomaly prevents UE-1109-Σ from entering 1 WTC, and the repelled instance rematerializes over Tribeca. It becomes visibly upset. The whereabouts of the three Pseudo-Type Blues are unknown.\n\n**[04:42]** The UE-1109-Σ instance becomes incorporeal again and returns to the Empire State Building. The eight surviving members of the Pseudo-Type Blue swarm are gathering in a formation with Leyland in the lead, but Huxley, who is at the tail end, is gradually moving away from the group. \n\n**[04:46]** A light projectile fired by UE-1109-Σ impacts against the first helicopter. A cloud of ashes is visible for a split second, and the image is immediately cut off.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶︎Access: Record 2001/09/15 - 160267\" hide=\"- Access Granted \"]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **Record 2001/09/15 - 160267**\n\n++++ Record by Mobile Task Force O-16 (“Walpurgis”)\n[[/=]]\n\n__**Members:**__\n* Randall House, Head Researcher, Occult Division\n* Member of Mobile Task Force Ο-16 (“Walpurgis”)\n\n------\n\n[Playback starts from 2001/09/15 05:01]\n\n//[Ο-16 has begun contacting the evacuees around Union Square.]//\n\n**Ο16-Epsilon:** Reality collapses have calmed down, so that's good.

It is noteworthy that no accumulation of Cack Ash was observed in the surrounding area.\n\n**[00m23s-]** A troll among the people at the shelter is seen being attacked by the people around him. The troll becomes flustered as they try to stop their opponents. Audio shows humans complaining about the amount of real estate trolls take up in the shelter.\n\n**[00m38s-]** Some of the evacuees look frightened and point into the distance. The video camera points ahead, which shows UE-1109-B heading towards the evacuation center. However, the instances are clearly showing signs of damage and are moving slowly.\n\n**[00m52s-]** Several other evacuees look up at the sky and point. When the video camera points towards the sky, two Pseudo-Type Blues are seen flying towards the evacuation center from a distance. Both appear to be injured, and are accompanied by SCP-2910-JP instances.\n\n**[00m57s-]** The two Pseudo-Type Blues glance at UE-1109-B, but ignore it and descend to the evacuation center. A roar of laughter arises from the evacuees.\n\n**[01m08s-]** The girls appear to have intervened with the human who is assaulting the troll. The human initially complains at them, but gradually accepts their persuasion and stops attacking. The trolls thank them. At this point, UE-1109-B stops.\n\n**[01m41s-]** The two Pseudo-Type Blues once again step forward in front of the evacuees. The video camera continues to focus on the two.\n\n**[02m00s-]** The two call themselves \"Angelina Pickering'' and \"Marietta Mayweather,'' respectively, and make the following appeal to the evacuees: \n\n> **Pickering:** We are both refugees. Like you, we have worked with many beings.\n> \n> **Mayweather:** Despite the terrifying circumstances, everyone on Manhattan Island; people, witches, and fairies alike, transcended their differences and came together as one.\n> \n> **Pickering:** Earlier, I received cheers saying, \"The hero who defeated the monster in the sky has arrived.'' Thank you. However, it wasn't just the power of one or two people, but the support of all the witches, and even more people who tried to protect the island.\n> \n> **Mayweather:** Differences in appearance and power don't matter. We realized that if we stick together, we can survive anything. Unity is what will protect us.\n> \n> **Pickering:** We are going to share this message with other shelters. Please stay safe and survive for just a little while longer.\n\n**[02m57s-]** Cheers rise from the evacuees. Many people shout the word \"unity\", including trolls.\n\n**[03m03s-]** The video camera records someone saying \"[[[twistedgears-kaktus-proposal|If we unite, we can be gods!]]] Reverend Father[[footnote]]This is assumed to refer to PoI-2912-JP-A (\"Nathan Fillmore\"), a key witness associated with \"Manhattan's Mekhanite\".

Both Pickering and Mayweather were taken to an evacuation center in the East Village after the return of Manhattan Island, but at that point they had already separated from their respective SCP-2910-JP instances.

The U.S. government complied, urging the Foundation and Coalition to develop partial rights and obligations for parahumans and Type Blues in the Gulf Agreement. Meanwhile, a number of demonic entities that had escaped the influence of UE-1111 surrendered to the Foundation and approached the Foundation's Legal Department with an agreement to provide various labor services for the reconstruction of Manhattan Island. As a result of the combination of the above factors, the Foundation-Coalition policy for the incarceration/purge of Type Blue parahumans under the Hudson River Accords, implemented on 09/20/2001, underwent a major shift in direction.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n+++ Addendum.2910-JP.3 > Interview record\n\nThe following is an instance of SCP-2910-JP in Foundation containment displaying its anomalous properties.

Please answer slowly so that you don't strain your throat. Where were you when the 9/11 incident occurred?\n\n**Huxley:** I was visiting a friend in Chelsea from Brooklyn. It was terrible-- everything was shaking, including the house and the street, and the sky turned red-black. But that was just the beginning. We stayed at her house for a while, but on the second day a demon came to the house and kicked us out.\n\n**Nagase:** Please continue. What do you remember about the four days before you were rescued?\n\n**Huxley:** I just ran away. From demons, from zombies, from big birds. I spent some time in Washington Square Park, thinking it would be easier to see dangerous things in bigger spaces. But then I saw a rain of exploding cupcakes fall from the sky. After that, I just ran through the ashes from alley to alley and hid. I still wonder how I was able to move for such a long time without collapsing.\n\n**Nagase:** I see. So, you were all alone until you met SCP-2910-JP-1, the being named Query.\n\n**Huxley:** Yes. If I hadn't met Query at that time, I would have been killed.\n\n**Nagase:** I understand this is very traumatizing for you, my condolences. Next, please tell us more about Query. What power did he give you?\n\n**Huxley:** I asked Query to help me get out of Manhattan alive. I asked him to protect me. Before I knew it, I had become a witch. It was like //Harry Potter//.[[footnote]]A children's novel set in the \"Wizarding World\" published in 1997 by British author J.K. Rowling. Due to the collapse of the Veil caused by the Persephone Event, the series was discontinued after two installments.[[/footnote]] I really liked that story.\n\n**Nagase:** Hmm. Did you know how to use \"magic\" right away?\n\n**Huxley:** Query picked an easy explanation and told me how to do it. Fear, sadness, anger, and other emotions are the magic we use. I'm sure Harry and his friends used magic like this too. \n\n**Nagase:** So you used that magic to go around attacking terrorists hiding in windows?\n\n**Huxley:** Yes. Query had good eyes and ears, so he could see anything that was hiding behind the windows.\n\n**Nagase:** Thank you. If so, your aim was always accurate. We checked the scene of the incident, and I would like to tell you that his judgment was certainly correct. So, please tell us about what happened after you met the big white monster.\n\n**Huxley:** It was so big and scary. In fact, many of my friends were killed by it. They were all around my age, and I think they were just new witches like me.\n\n**Nagase:** ...If you're having a hard time, it's okay to take a break for a while.\n\n**Huxley:** No, let me tell you a little bit more...strong people like Ms. Leyland and Ms. Chao took the lead and worked together with other friends to fight monsters...but I... I did my best to protect myself. I think Query saved me from danger over and over again. From the time I was flying between buildings to run away from the smoke tentacles of the monster, I was already at my limit and I may not remember it.\n\n**Nagase:** It was a difficult experience, to be sure. However, I'm really relieved that you arrived safely with us.\n\n**Huxley:** What about the others? What happened after that?\n\n**Nagase:** Well, let me tell you that you are a very lucky little girl. However, we can confirm that at least three people, including Leyland, are safe[[footnote]]After the operation was completed on September 16, 2001, Ms. Sybil Leyland was returned to the \"Army of Divine Revelation\" stationed on Staten Island. It is unclear what consequences she was met with from the Horizon Initiative, as she manifested thaumaturgy not derived from Abrahamic religions. [[/footnote]] and I believe that perhaps a few more of them could have left Manhattan.... For now, let's rejoice that you have come back safely. We will also do our best to support you.\n\n**Huxley:** What will happen to me after this?\n\n**Nagase:** ...SCP-2910-JP-1-A, please listen carefully to what I am about to say. People who are able to use magic are separated from the world in which ordinary people live. They are incorporated into a society of people like us who live in the dark, and will be forever separated from their families...\n\n**Huxley:** Oh no...\n\n**Nagase:** ...That was the common sense response among us up until now... Probably not for you.\n\n**Huxley:** Huh?\n\n**Nagase:** The world has begun to change dramatically since the incident that occurred in Poland [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/1998-hub 3 years ago], and this terrorist incident is about to bring about an even greater turning point. The magnitude of the achievements that witches like you have made in suppressing terrorism is highly valued not only by those of us who belong to the paranormal world, but also by the world at large who saw it in person or in the news.\n\n**Huxley:** Really? \n\n**Nagase:** That's right. Those who stand above me and act as a bridge between the ordinary and the paranormal, together with people from various races slightly different from humans, redefine magicians like you as \"slightly paranormal'' and make them look like ordinary people in general society. We are considering adding it to the framework. One day soon, you will be able to return to your family as a mildly paranormal person. We have mixed feelings, though.\n\n**Huxley:** Well, I'm very relieved to hear that. Until that day, thank you for your continued support.\n\n**Nagase:** Of course, Ms. Huxley.

Thanks to you, Rita is doing well under our care.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** You don't need to thank us. We were called to protect them. We were just doing our job.\n\n**House:** You were called? By who?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** Hexa (SCP-2910-JP-3). He's really rough with people. If I had known, I would not have cooperated with him.\n\n**House:** I see. Could you tell us a little bit about Hexa?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** I understand. He came to our hometown probably four years ago in your means of time-telling. He wasn't like us at first, he looked like you.\n\n**House:** He was originally human?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** I don't know how it happened, but before we knew it, that human was gone, and in his place, someone who looked like us but spoke just like that human that appeared. So I think he probably used some unknown method to us to disguise himself as us.\n\n**House:** Hmm, that's an interesting story. So even though you knew he wasn't one of you, you still cooperated with him?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** Well, what can I say, he was very popular. He always only said things that made sense, and he gave us accurate advice as if he could see the future. For better or worse, I think he had charisma.\n\n**House:** So he was called on this case.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** That's right. Originally, the world we live in is far away from here, but Hexa perfectly figured out the route from our home to this place and told us about it. The road was so long that I forgot, but the last step is \"[http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/derived-function 7 sections of the red, white, and blue-colored shaft backwards],\" [[footnote]] Exists in East Village.

Hexa said he wanted to save as many people as possible, so we went around Manhattan negotiating with people who were in danger or who looked like they were used to fighting. Anyway, we needed people.\n\n**House:** So you met Rita.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** I was quite anxious because I couldn't find the right person. But it's true that I wanted to help Rita.\n\n**House:** You taught her magic to protect her.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** Well, I guess you could say I \"taught\" her, but it didn't go according to plan. People in this world are really bad at using magic. I thought you could use almost any kind of magic as long as you had an emotion that caused a slight movement in your heart.\n\n**House:** There is a limit to the strength of thaumaturgy that can be used only by emotion. Most of the great magic that we know of requires an energy source, such as blood.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** What, you need materials to use magic? If you do something like that in our world, you'll be seen by a lot of people as being in a [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/eden-leap-117 low position]. Literally.\n\n**House:** (//Sighs.//)\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** In any case, I tried my best to help Rita learn the magic that she could do on the spot. I heard from Hexa about the stereotypical image of magic that people here have, so I decided to give her toy robes, a wand, and a broom. The others did the same. We actually don't need all of that. Well, the trick to magic is to be in the right mood, and I realized once again that mood is important.\n\n**House:** Did you do a lot of things to match Rita's image to that of a witch? You are a very considerate fairy.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** We all believe in protecting those who allow us to act as their masters, even at the cost of our own lives. Well, I don't know what the person who invited us thought about that.\n\n**House:** So Hexa was different?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** That's right. Did you see that suicide dive into the monster's belly? Such a dangerous act would never come out of the idea of ​​protecting. I think he was the only one who didn't like Alison somewhere in his heart. When I saw that, I realized once again that he was different from us.\n\n**House:** Yeah, I looked at the footage earlier, and that was a pretty wild tackle. Or rather, the witch had completely abandoned her broom. ...In any case, were you able to keep in touch with the people who jumped into further dimensional abnormalities after that?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** That's completely impossible.\n\n**House:** Hmm... Do you think Hexa is still alive?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** Let me put it to you this way, had I done the same thing, I would have definitely died. But since it's him, I feel like he survived somehow. Perhaps he is traveling far away to an unknown world, using a path that none of us even know about.\n\n**House:** You said Hexa taught you the way you came, right? Did he have other paths?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** I don't know if Hexa was able to create a new path, but maybe his master, Allison, could. Judging by her demeanor, it seems like she's been a real witch for a long time.\n\n**House:** I see...it's possible that the witch and fairy pair were fundamentally different from the other pairs in terms of their potential.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** You can certainly say that.\n\n**House:** Thank you. Lastly, do you have any idea what Hexa really wanted to do?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** I've heard a lot of things about him, and I feel like he's not a master or a refugee or something like that, but maybe he's a part of this world itself where Manhattan Island is located. I wonder if he was interested in that? I had a strong feeling that he was thinking about something incomprehensible.\n\n**House:** I see. In fact, earlier, I found out that Hexa had played an important role in the final stages of our operation to retake Manhattan. In a way, it certainly makes sense that he was acting [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goi2015-saiga to save the world].\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** But, why did he show interest in saving your world, even though he was originally from a faraway place? I can't understand this at all.\n\n**House:** Maybe cause she was like a human from our world?\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** But even so, he treated her with the utmost carelessness. Judging from his behavior, I don't think he's acting for her sake.\n\n**House:** Hmm, the mystery seems to be getting deeper and deeper.\n\n**SCP-2910-JP-1:** Well, it's good that you're worried about Hexa, but I'm more worried about Allison, assuming she's still alive. If she stays with him, I think she's going to be in a lot of trouble, if not dead, in the future. Poor girl.\n\n[Omitted]\n\n------\n\n> As far as we can deduce from the information obtained from the interviews conducted by House, it seems that in the original timeline where SCP-2910-JP resided, \"magic\" was very different in principle from that of our world. In addition, SCP-2910-JP-3 and its counterpart, PoI-4056, seem to have caused various anomalous phenomena based on independent rules that were different from those of the other SCP-2910-JP instances. It is extremely difficult to determine the exact extent to which the magic that occurred in Manhattan originated from SCP-2910-JP. However, based on the law of similarity in thaumaturgy, \"like begets like,\" the powers exercised by the girls, including Huxley, who were influenced by SCP-2910-JP, can be considered as not deviating from the type of miraculous arts.
