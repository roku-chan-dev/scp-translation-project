Due to significant threats to the Veil posed by SCP-8166’s activation, Foundation personnel are to work in tandem with GOC security elements to research effective long term containment procedures.\n\nPersonnel tasked with exploring SCP-8166-1 are to be supplied with standard biohazard suits and cognitohazard suppressants. All personnel assigned to SCP-8166 are to be monitored for hermeneutic affliction. To limit the spread of outside contaminants to both SCP-8166-1 and SCP-8166-2, exploring personnel are to be quarantined within SCP-8166-1 until containment objectives are fulfilled.\n\nContainment of SCP-8166-3 is no longer necessary following its termination.\n\n**Description:**\n\nAt the time of this article's creation, SCP-8166 has been activated by GOC thaumaturges during a routine inspection of low-threat anomalous items.\n\nSCP-8166 is a music box formerly possessed by PoI-1875, Hans Christian Andersen, a Danish author known for writing fairy tales and suspected thaumaturge. It is decorated with a medallion of a crane bird and the inscription \"Eden\".\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=\n   http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8166/Eden2.jpg\n| caption=A photo of SCP-8166-1 taken by a drone.\n|width = 400px\n|align = left\n]]\nWhen opened, SCP-8166 releases a small crane bird automaton which beats its wings and plays a musical tune that has been classified as a spiral-class hermeneutic.[[footnote]]A cognitohazard resulting from or created by the reinterpretation of an anomalous concept.[[/footnote]] Direct reproductions of the tune possess no anomalous effects.\n\nIf activated, SCP-8166 creates a hermeneutic bridge between baseline reality and SCP-8166-1, an idyllic natural reality covered in vast fields, rivers, and forests. \n\nSCP-8166-2 is the collective designation for all living beings found within the confines of SCP-8166-1. A full index of confirmed sentient creatures is available upon request, although no definitive signs of sapience has yet been discovered.\n\nSCP-8166-3 was an entity connected to the gate structure manifested during the activation, and has been neutralised upon contact with the GOC.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Prologue**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//A Melody Unwinding//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\nNot many things happen only //once// upon a time, no matter how big and bold they are. But this story certainly began a long time ago.\n\nTime has passed slowly for the ##CC5500|ancient guardian## since he started his Watch. He no longer stood tall, bright and brazen against the darkening skies as he had once on that fateful day. The heaviness of the armour forged onto him had grown a crook in his back, a scowl on his brow, and a rasp in his throat, as years had turned to decades, and decades to a century and more.\n\nOne does what one must to push the gears of time forward on those long and lonely nights. The ##CC5500|knight of fallen glory## walks the winding paths through the Assistens Kirkegård, tracing the steps he had taken so many times before between the growths of living landscape and the stones of the dead. This is where the ##CC5500|old guard## would visit his ##5d0f87|old friend##.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/AsoTXeG.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n##5d0f87|//Vort Jordliv her er Evighedens Frø//##\n[[/=]]\n\nThe ##CC5500|man who held Watch## buries his face behind his scarf, pushing his hands deeper in his pockets as the cold winds brush by. His fingers find the object he’d carried with him ever since that fateful day, in a land far, far away from here. A burden he had chosen to take up, before he'd known the price.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook-small\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/mZeSvdP.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIt was by no means an elegant instrument, worn from the years of work and carry. But what use is elegance in the hands of one that knows only war? Truly, the ##CC5500|Guardian## could feel remnants of its blazing might. It was still engraved with the initials of a man he had met in a lifetime that no longer felt like his own, the ##5d0f87|Storyteller## who had left his mark, and not just on him.\n\nInstinctively, he reaches for the inscription on its side, feeling the letters through the grime. //H.C.A.//\n\nHe closes his eyes, frozen in time like a statue among the stone. A part of him had died that day, carried away and forgotten by the wind and empty promises.\n\nHis wistful thoughts are interrupted as he hears it call to him in the night; a melody that had long been forgotten to him:\n\n[[=]]\n//From four corners carried on the wind;//\n//He who bears the sword: atone for your sins;//\n//Return, return the peace to Eden.//\n[[/=]]\n\nHis eyes grow wide. His fingers clasp the pen as he turns on the gravel, footprints widening with every step until they disappear. His heart soars with a vigilance he thought he had forgotten as his wings feel the breeze. The winds had finally returned to him.\n\nThe Gates were opening.\n\n[[=]]\n**➹@<   >@ ➸@<   >@ ➹**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8166 was part of a collection of items seized by the GOC from an underground auction, and subjected to protocol FORFATTER due to Andersen's status as a suspected thaumaturgic practitioner. During evaluation, SCP-8166 was opened but did not activate, and no anomalous attributes were registered.\n\nFoundation review of the footage preceding the confrontation with SCP-8166-3 shows a GOC thaumaturge humming SCP-8166's melody in a slightly different key.\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\nSprays of salt pepper the angel as he soars over torrid sea, passing shipyards and oil rigs as he crosses landmarks and shorelines. The wild waters give way for city life and countryside, for creatures and critters roaming paths and meadows, and the old warrior can't help but remember a place, a time, where he was one of them.\n\nThese thoughts disappear as quickly as they came. The song calls to him, calls him back to a land beyond reach, to a time beyond our own. With each rooftop and tree he passes, he can feel its pull on him grow stronger, bringing him to where he needs to be. Where he belongs.\n\nThe ##CC5500|Guardian##’s gaze shifts to a compound in the distance. His wings, once grand and bright, glow dimly as he cuts through the air. He watches as figures, barely taller than toy soldiers cast from tin and misguided ideals, look up to him.\n\nTheir commands are wasted on him. There is only one he answers to.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/TTwpc91.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//\"My soul is weary, but my heart is eager. Kindred soul, replenish my strengths, so I may ignite.\"//\n\nHe watches as their shouts are replaced by //cracks// and flashes of light at the ends of muzzles. Their projectiles whizz hopelessly past him.\n\nHe uncaps his pen, unleashing the curved blade burning with an eternal blaze. The darkened night sky ignites once more.\n\nHe descends upon them.\n\n[[=]]\n**➹@<   >@ ➸@<   >@ ➹**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOn October 19th, 1999, GOC Strike Team \"Lancelot\" was dispatched in response to an attack on the EDEN Complex by a thaumaturgical entity, suspected to be related to the unplanned SCP-8166 activation. GOC field reports describe SCP-8166-3 as a humanoid with four radiant wings, wielding a sword of fire.\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\nThe ##CC5500|once bright and blazen warrior## wills himself upright as he towers over his fallen foes. His mind is sharper than it had been in decades, movements lighter than a breeze, but his body aches; it was still that same frame that had carried him through the Garden, once upon a lifetime ago. There is only so much a man can hold.\n\nAs he cleaves his way through the compound, reaching for that moment his life had been stretched out to reach, he hears the melody. A little music box playing a song that could bridge worlds and carry him to the only home he wished for. It conjures visions of days past and future, all in that endless plane of wonder. Just for a moment he could believe he sees a woman, clothed with the sun, with stars in her eyes and a crown of mighty antlers, reaching out to him from beyond her grave.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/B5HwKqZ.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= ##5d0f87|//Our life here on earth is the seed of eternity.//##\n\nOh, what he would’ve given for one more breath in that Garden, one more moment in her presence. His eyes tear up. That was not his role to play.\n\nBehind him, he hears the heavy footfalls of boots in mud. He turns as he takes his place beside the Gate, his flaming sword readied.\n\n//\"This is not your call to answer. Leave, or face your fate.\"//\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/tAF5ij6.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThey pause, guns trained on the ##CC5500|Mighty Force of Fire##. He smiles, but not at them; the warmth at his back rekindles his resolve. They call out for peace, but he does not answer. Perhaps there would’ve been days he’d accept their olive branch and promise for rest, once upon the long ages that passed.\n\nHe lunges forward, flaming steel cutting ribbons through armour and flesh, and they fall like he wished he had.\n\nBut as his sword rips towards the last man, the one who was yet to fall, he hears the melody trill in his mind. A ##green|Sour Note## distorts his vision. The world shrinks around him as his thrust is answered with buckshot. The sting of hundreds of pellets pierce his side first, his chest second. He makes one final motion to strike, one final look at the Gate he promised to guard oh so long ago, before his Watch comes to an end.\n\nAnd so, the ##CC5500|Guardian## falls at the Gates of Paradise.\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter neutralisation, SCP-8166-3's remains were examined by GOC specialists and Foundation researchers, determining that it was of Southwest Asian descent and approximately 200 years old. Aside from age and abilities displayed during the confrontation, no additional anomalous characteristics were identified.\n\nThe gateway created by SCP-8166 remained open following the death of SCP-8166-3. Initial unmanned explorations into SCP-8166-1 found that it was safe for human exploration, and an expedition was approved.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Act 1**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//Mud and Bone//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook-big\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/krgVNR3.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Log - 01>>**[[/size]]\n\n**Personnel Present:** Senior Researcher Luca Armaros, RTF Eta-7; Agent Ukulele, Strike Team \"Lancelot\".\n-----\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n//<A video camera clicks on, revealing a small boat with a figure clad in a yellow biohazard suit. The figure leans against the side, intermittently taking samples of the water and collecting clumps of algae from the lake's surface. A grunt can be heard behind the camera.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** You gonna paddle or are you just gonna be dead weight?\n\n**Armaros:** Relax, Agent. Take it all in. There is no need to rush our observation.\n\n**Ukulele:** Dead weight it is. Splendid.\n\n**Armaros:** Are you not even a little intrigued? The promise of the Garden, of a long-lost Paradise on Earth right within reach, and all you can do is grumble?\n\n**Ukulele:** I've seen enough self-proclaimed gods, angels, and devils in my time. Big and bloated tales, always ends the same. I'll stick to the job.\n\n//<Armaros crosses his arms, a frown on his face. He eyes Ukulele's holster.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** There’s no way you’re actually buying this whole Paradise spiel?\n\n**Armaros:** In a world as wondrous as ours, there might just be a chance of Heaven. It’s not that hard to believe in that possibility, is it?\n\n**Ukulele:** You religious, I take it?\n\n**Armaros:** On occasion. I dated an eschatologist some time back.\n\n**Ukulele:** A what-now?\n\n**Armaros:** He studied the end times as dictated by Scripture. He’d read Enoch to me while I was writing my thesis. //<He smiles.>// Even called me his \"Angel in Heaven\".\n\n**Ukulele:** Charmer.\n\n//<The expression on Armaros’ face falls.>//\n\n**Armaros:** Now that I think of it -- given the context he might've meant we were doomed to fall.\n\n**Ukulele:** He dumped you using Scripture? That’s rough, mate.\n\n//<Armaros stares into the distance for a moment.>//\n\n**Armaros:** Men... //<He shakes his head.>// Either way, it’s just a hobby for me now. A bit of comfort on long, lonely nights. //<He pauses.>// What about you? I take it that the //renowned// Agent Ukulele isn’t a believer?\n\n**Ukulele:** Was raised to be one. Mum was – I don’t even know what it was. She started off as Catholic, but collected all kinds of spiritual beliefs along the way. Little bits and bobs she added on top. I decided to go the opposite direction.\n\n**Armaros:** God-killer rather than god-worshipper?\n\n**Ukulele:** Are you trying to be cute?\n\n**Armaros:** You have a reputation, Agent. One for action rather than dialogue. A reminder: we have a duty here to explore and, if needed, contain the anomaly. We’re observers, first and foremost.\n\n**Ukulele:** Yeah, yeah. I read the same mission brief. If you’re gonna be like this the whole time, I might just end myself right here and now.\n\n**Armaros:** You brought the equipment for it.\n\n//<Armaros gestures to the firearm on Ukulele’s belt.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** That’s what you’re on about? It’s bog-standard expedition gear.\n\n**Armaros:** This is not one of your usual blood hunts. I know what you and your ilk have been doing to Reality Benders lately, Agent. I hope for both of our sakes you keep that thing in its holster.\n\n**Ukulele:** Sod off, it's just a precaution. You can thank me later when I save your sorry arse. Keep your delicate hands clean for your little bird doodles.\n\n//<Armaros scoffs, but doesn't respond. The two men sit in silence as the boat reaches the shore.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I'll round the island and approach from the east. Meet you back here at 1900 hours. You think you can manage that?\n\n**Armaros:** Certainly, Agent. But I'll be sure to radio you when my \"sorry arse\" needs saving.\n\n//<Ukulele pushes the boat back towards the water, preparing to take off.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** //(Under his breath)// Wanker.\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**- 𝄡 -**[[/size]] \n\nAnd so, the ##green|Dissonant Chord## stands alone on the shore of a vast, new land. A verdant expanse stretches itself out before him, filled with fruit and flower never seen or even imagined by a human mind. Songbirds chime and dart throughout the air, small rodents run their races, and even the indigo rivers were alive with piscine creatures caught in watery dances. But none of this could touch the ##green|Hunter##'s hardened heart, for he still believes there was a fantasy to pierce through; a façade held up by tricksters and gods.\n\n//Truly,// the ##green|Hunter## thought, //truly this is nothing more than a gilded prison.//\n\nHe would not walk alone for much longer, for in the quiet of the underbush hides a creature of the forest, and her curiosity had been caught. A ##a16e08|Nymph##, more deer than human, raised as the former but longing for the sense of the latter, watches as the ##green|Hunter## begins to traverse her domain.  \n\nThe winds spoke of change, of storms and whirlwinds and an End, and ##a16e08|Reverie## was intrigued. She'd never experienced an End before, and couldn't fathom the weight that word would carry. But as the clouds grew overcast in the sky, so grew her desire to learn more.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Log - 01>>**[[/size]]\n\n**Personnel Present:** Agent Ukulele.\n-----\n= **<<Continued>>**\n\n//<The camera jolts and sways as Ukulele makes his way through a patch of vines. The greens and brown of the forest are intermittently interrupted by streaks of yellow rubber.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** This is utter bollocks. Why the hell do we need to wear these bloody suits?\n\n**Armaros:** //(Through radio)// This is our kind of precaution, Ukulele. Preventing the possibility of death and contamination, rather than causing it – must be hard to get your GOC head around.\n\n//<Ukulele walks a little further, his hazmat suit getting stuck on a branch. He pulls it loose and curses.>//\n\n**Armaros:** //(Through radio)// It should just be for today, finalising our environmental data collection. //<He pauses>// I am going radio silent for a moment.\n\n**Ukulele:** //(Muttering)// Don’t threaten me with a good time.\n\n//<He continues down the clearing. The loud screeches of a bird makes him look upwards, frantically searching for the source of the sound. He tries to pull back the hood of his hazmat suit to extend his vision.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Fucking Foundation protocols -- bloody ridiculous is what it is. Labcoat with a damned saviour complex. If this is Paradise, I don’t want to know what Hell is like.\n\n//<As he’s still looking up, he missteps and stumbles over the exposed root of a tree and loses his balance. From the bushes nearby, a human-like squeak is heard>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Who is there?! //<He places his hand on his holster>// Show yourself!\n\n//<A tall figure steps out from behind a tree and smiles. The camera feed momentarily defocusses, until the Reality Stabilisation Filter kicks in. Antlers grow from a feminine face, flanked by large ears that occasionally flick in response to a far off noise. Her otherwise humanoid body ends in long, furry legs and hooved feet. She moves forward quickly but carefully, avoiding insects and plants with each step.>//\n\n**???:** Oh dear, are you alright?\n\n**Ukulele:** What? I’m fine, just–\n\n//<The deer-woman pushes him gently to the side and bends down to the forest floor. With great care she picks up a butterfly with a bent wing, lying directly next to Ukulele’s boot. She brushes over the wing, flattening it out, before placing the butterfly on a branch.>//\n\n**???:** I think you didn’t do lasting hurt this time.\n\n**Ukulele:** This time? You know who I am?\n\n**???:** Of course! //The ##green|knight in shining armour##, bright and brazen.// Although I imagined it being more–\n\n//<She pushes against the surface of the hazmat suit.>//\n\n**???:** Sturdy. Like bark, maybe?\n\n**Ukulele:** Can you stop that?\n\n//<She doesn’t. Instead, she starts prodding at Ukulele’s torso.>//\n\n**???:** Your wind called you Ukulele.\n\n**Ukulele:** My wind -- you mean my radio?\n\n//<She doesn’t answer the question, but pokes against his visor.>//\n\n**???:** All my winds call me something different, too. Words from where they travelled, sounds they found that suited me. //<She hums a short melody.>// //Winding worlds, our little ##a16e08|Reverie##. Hold, hold dearly the gift of Eden.//\n\n**Ukulele:** That's quite enough. Step back, or I will have to take action.\n\n//<She tilts her head at Ukulele’s remark, then takes a step back.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Reverie, that’s your name?\n\n**Reverie:** You’re not what I imagined humans were like. But then again, that’s half the fun. You can wind and unwind the world, too, can you not?\n\n//<She looks down to Ukulele’s hand, still resting on the holster. For a moment, the camera defocusses the same way as before. Ukulele looks back up before the Filter stabilises the feed.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** H-how --\n\n**Reverie:** This is a place of creation.\n\n**Ukulele:** Oh, I've heard this shite before. And what are you, the creator?\n\n**Reverie:** Why would you think that?\n\n**Ukulele:** That's usually how the story goes. Some Type Green getting high off their own supply, huffing their own -- what are you doing?\n\n//<Reverie has taken Ukulele's hand, her fingers tracing the rubber of his glove.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Trying to find out how the story goes.\n\n//<The white patches on her fur, as well as her eyes and antlers all begin to emit a pearlescent radiance. Ukulele tries to pull his hand back, but it seems locked in a streak of light, drawn around his wrist.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Once upon a time --\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n--there was a ##green|Hunter##, a ruffian who roamed the fringes of a world he'd never reside in himself. When the townsfolk saw him, they saw his weapon first, and his mask second. He wore it for their ease, for his face had been torn and carved up by the monsters he had fought. At least, that's what he'd tell them under amber lamplight.\n\nHe had heeded a call not truly given to him: slay the monsters that haunt the earth. The green dragons, most of all, for they were tricksters and traitors to the only world he called real.\n\nHis blade would await them, a tool stained as ##red|crimson## as the very blood that flowed through his veins. The dragon's mark was an infection, and there was no cure. So he would travel the lands, coating his sword in suffering.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/71CoLSB.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe townsfolk would celebrate his return, marvel at the grime on his mask and the gauntlets painted in gore, a gruesome price he'd willingly let others pay for a world that stayed within the lines of reason. Then he'd slip away, fading from town like a whisper before his triumph could be celebrated with him.\n\nOnly in his solitary wanderings, in the lonely fields and wastelands did he dare to remove his mask. Only then would the reflections in puddles and lakes catch the image of the greatest trickster amongst them -- not a ##green|Hunter##'s face mangled by horrors and dangers, but the scales of a ##green|green dragon## itself.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **<<Continued>>**\n\n**Reverie:** So much hurt and loneliness.\n\n//<Ukulele pulls his hand back and grabs his gun, releasing the safety.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I will fucking shoot!\n\n//<He looks down at his weapon, noticing his hand is shaking. He steadies it with his other hand.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** What on earth did you do to me?!\n\n**Reverie:** I did nothing but tell your story. Why does it shock you so much?\n\n//<She steps a little closer, her head tilted. Her fur has returned to its neutral colour, and her ears are once again flicking in the wind.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I am not -- //that//. I am-\n\n//<The radio on Ukulele’s waist buzzes.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Your wind is calling you home again.\n\n**Armaros:** //(Through radio)// I ended my observation early, Ukulele. I’ll be waiting by the shore for you.\n\n//<Ukulele steps backwards, carefully looking down as to not stumble. He keeps the gun pointed at Reverie and takes several deep breaths before answering the radio.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Understood, I’m on my way.\n\n//<He backs away further, keeping vision on Reverie for as long as possible. She doesn't move or follow him. Once she's out of view, he turns around and runs, holding his gun close to his chest. By the time the shore comes back into view, he slows down, panting heavily. He once more looks at his glove and the weapon he's holding, rubbing over the fabric frantically as a ##red|dark, viscous fluid## is visible on it.>//\n\n//<The Stabilisation Filter kicks in once more, and it only shows a rubber glove. Ukulele takes a deep breath, puts the safety back on his weapon and holsters it.>//\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**- 🜂 -**[[/size]]\n\nElsewhere, the Archivist calmly makes his way through the verdant expanse. In his hands he holds a small, bound notebook that contains drawings of magnificent birds and small creatures, sketches of waterways and measurements of the rings of a downed tree. The Archivist was even able to capture a koi fish — or so it seemed — that was as large as a log. Its blank eyes were full of peace as it drifted in the clear water.\n\n//Truly,// the Archivist thought, //truly I stand in a place no artist can do justice.//\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook-small\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/q4b7h6S.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe walks carefully through the brush, making sure to not disturb the ecosystem more than the pair already have. But even in his caution, the Archivist's presence was known in the land. An ##blue|old woman##, who bore more rings than even the trunks of the most grand trees in this garden, heard him enter her domain.\n\nThe winds spoke of the pair, and ##blue|Kindred## was aware of what this meant. So she waited, patiently like a spider on a dew-covered web, for the Archivist to pass by her. The clouds grew overcast in the sky, and the truth could be denied no longer. It was time for the man of records to discover the threads of his fate.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Log - 01>>**[[/size]]\n\n**Personnel Present:** Senior Researcher Luca Armaros.\n-----\n= **<<Continued>>**\n\n//<The camera moves slowly through the greenery, a rubber glove only incidentally coming in frame as it gently pushes branches out of the way. The feed shows an expanding landscape of forestry and undergrowth, framed by the hills and caves on the horizon and a shallow brook nearby. Armaros moves towards the latter.>//\n\n//<He stands up and turns towards the spot indicated by the scanner: the opening of a cave. For a moment, the feed catches a glimpse of a ##blue|blue glow##.>//\n\n**Armaros:** Well hello, there. I’m not sure whether the camera was able to record that, but there appears to be another lifeform here. I’m going to cautiously approach.\n\n//<Armaros moves closer to the entrance of the cave, looking up and back down from his scanner intermittently. As he approaches, the flickering light of a campfire can be made out.>//\n\n//<The feed shows the insides of a cave, lit by a campfire with a cooking pot on top of it. The ladle is still in the pot, but otherwise the cave is empty. Armaros once again turns to his scanner.>//\n\n**???:** Are you going to stand there all day, or are you coming in?\n\n//<The camera shows only a shade, coloured in transparent blue, moving towards the fire with a plate filled with cut vegetables. The vegetables are put into the pot, and the ladle is moved to a stir.>//\n\n**Armaros:** My apologies, I didn’t mean to pry. I --\n\n**???:** Yes, yes. You’re at least polite, for your kind. Come in, sit by the fire. I’ll get you a bowl.\n\n//<Armaros steps inside, sitting down on a log next to the fire. He appears to observe the shade. After a moment, he takes out his notebook and starts to sketch an elderly woman-figure.>//\n\n**???:** Interesting outfit, human. Are you expecting a battle?\n\n**Armaros:** N-no, it’s just procedure. I’m with the Founda-\n\n//<The ladle whacks him, slapping the notebook out of his hands. It falls on the cave floor.>//\n\n**???:** Don’t draw people you just met. Did your Guardian not teach you manners?\n\n**Armaros:** My guardian?\n\n//<The shade doesn't answer, humming a melody instead. Armaros reaches down to pick up his notebook, but is only able to find an old-fashioned ink pen. It has the initials “H.C.A.” inscribed into the wood.[[footnote]]Researcher Armaros did only bring a standard issue pen for fieldwork into SCP-8166-1, and does not recall ever encountering this pen before this moment.[[/footnote]]>//\n\n**???:** You seem ill-equipped for the confrontation, I must say.\n\n**Armaros:** Confrontation?\n\n**???:** Yes, yes. Keep up. //<She fills a bowl with soup.>// Eat. Strengthens your soul, hardens your heart.\n\n//<Armaros takes the bowl, which appears to be hovering on the camera feed. He quickly takes out his scanner and investigates the soup. The scan clears it as non-anomalous and non-toxic.>//\n\n**???:** Potato leek soup. If you want my recipe, you can just ask. //<She laughs.>// My name is Kindred.\n\n**Armaros:** Armaros. Luca Armaros.\n\n//<He hesitates for a moment, then removes his plastic visor. He carefully smells the soup, stirring it. The steam fogs up the camera feed momentarily, and as it does, the face of an elderly woman is visible where the shade is otherwise.>//\n\n**Kindred:** You strike me as a listener, Luca Armaros. And no meal is complete without a tale. \n\n**Armaros:** //(Smiling)// I'd say that's on point. You could tell me how you began yours.\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\nWhen the ##blue|Old Spirit## was not yet old, and the winds hadn't yet stretched their young arms across the world, she would sit within a cavern in the Garden they called Paradise. The lands beyond her doorstep were under her care, and she only took what she needed to feed her and those seeking respite around her fire. For the longest time, that was just her, and the occasional visits of the winds from all four directions, coming home to rest and share their stories from afar. Until one day, she was surprised to see a fifth, a creature whose antlers were the only thing to poke above the rim of her cauldron. The child wobbled awkwardly on its hooved feet, and the ##blue|Woman## took pity on her.\n\nShe took the child under her wing, teaching her how to survive in and care for the lush Garden: where to sleep, what to eat, and most importantly, what parts of the Garden were not to be treaded. \n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/98WeD6j.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOne day when the ##blue|Guiding Woman## was cooking in her cavern, she heard a new whisper on the wind. A dark and inevitable whisper that she knew would call for the child, much like it had called for ##blue|Her## in the past.\n\nSo she did the best she could; protect the child from its longing words, of its temptations dressed in ##red|crimson##. She told the child that it could not leave the green pastures under //any// circumstance, lest ##red|**it**## were to mark her. \n\nAs it grew, so grew its curiosity of the world -- ##blue|Kindred## heard the whispers grow louder, the clouds grow darker. In her dreams, no, nightmares, she would see the creature endure the first ##red|drawing of blood##. Even the winds, who thought themselves above the storm in pride, shuddered at the darkness hanging just over the horizon.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<Continued>>**\n\n//<Armaros' spoon hangs in the air, halfway between the bowl and his mouth.>//\n\n**Kindred:** Don’t give me that look, child. It’s not like it’s the end of the world! At least, not yet.\n\n**Armaros:** The world is ending?\n\n**Kindred:** The world is always ending. A story starts and it ends. Then it starts, and it ends. \n\n//<The shade stands. She puts her empty bowl down on a nearby log.>//\n\n**Kindred:** I've lived in this place for as long as time remembers -- and believe me, Time's memory is far from perfect. It is a shelter from the cold and rugged weather. //<She sighs>// And it will not be enough to weather the oncoming storm.\n\n//<The figure stands behind the flame of the campfire. Within the smoke, a woman with a kind, patient smile is visible.>//\n\n**Kindred:** Come to me at the break of dawn. I will show you the story before yours.\n\n//<She walks forward, taking the bowl from him. Armaros stands close to the flames for a moment, holding the pen in front of the camera feed. He then pockets it with his scanner.>//\n\n**Kindred:** Shoo. Rest. You and your companion have a long path to walk.\n\n//<Armaros says a quiet goodbye before turning and leaving the cave. As he walks back into the Garden, he puts his visor back on and reaches for his radio.>//\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter regrouping at the designated contact point, Agent Ukulele and Researcher Armaros proceded to set up base camp, designation Camp Milton. Alongside the SCP-8166-1 samples collected by Researcher Armaros and the exploration feed, the following report was included:[[footnote]]This report only arrived 37 minutes after the expedition party entered SCP-8166-1.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Report / DAY 01>>**[[/size]]\n= Summary of Findings and Planned Follow-up\n\n-----\nDuring the first day of in-person exploration of SCP-8166-1, both personnel encountered suspected sapient lifeforms, being:\n\n* SCP-8166-4, a humanoid of above-average height that possesses characteristics similar to a common reindeer, including: hooved feet, large ears, antlers, a deer nose, and short tail. It seems to be capable of advanced ontokinetic abilities. Refers to itself as \"Reverie.\"\n* SCP-8166-5, a non-corporeal entity that makes itself appear as an elderly humanoid woman capable of speech and interaction with the corporeal world. Ontokinetic abilities are assumed but not established. Refers to itself as \"Kindred.\"\n\nAs per previous review of samples collected from drone exploration, flora and fauna present in SCP-8166-1 appears to be non-toxic to humans. Use of Foundation-approved rations is still preferred, however, as to limit dependence on SCP-8166-1.\n\nReview of exploration footage shows that neither lifeform appears hostile. Due to SCP-8166-5's references to an approaching event, further investigation is required to determine its possible effects on baseline normalcy. Interrogation of the lifeforms and further examination of the island is planned.\n\nAgent Ukulele requested that his opposition to \"playing nice and having tea parties\" with the anomaly be noted in this report, for future reference.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\nDeep within a quiet cavern, where cold stone was brought warmth by the ##blue|Elderly Woman## and her cauldron, a quiet ##a16e08|Nymph## absently stirs her bowl of stew. Her eyes diligently follow each chunk of vegetable, while her ears shift and turn at the sound of the soft rain outside.\n\n//\"What is on your mind, dear child?\"// The ##blue|Old Woman##'s glance turns to the ##a16e08|Nymph##, studying her innocuous face. No promises, false or otherwise, had reached the child of Eden yet. She turns to add another sprig of thyme to the cauldron. \n\n//\"Today I healed a butterfly's wing.\"// She answers, placing a half-full bowl on the log nearby. //\"It was bent and broken, but not beyond saving.\"//\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/u2RS0dO.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//\"I see.\"// ##blue|Kindred## pauses and smiles at the ##a16e08|Nymph##. //\"That was a kindness. Not every creature is lost, but not every creature wishes to be saved.\"//\n\n//\"What of a wound that is visible to you, and not to them?\"// The ##a16e08|Nymph## sets her bowl down on the cave floor and picks up a nearby pebble. As she rolls it in her hand it becomes covered in a thin layer of leafy moss.\n\n//\"You cannot save who does not wish to be saved, but you can protect those who do not know.\"//\n\n//\"How do you tell the difference?\"//\n\n//\"Time.\"//\n\nAnd so they sit quietly by the fire, certain they shared as much as they should have with one another, knowing that there was more left unspoken. The ##blue|Kindred Spirit## knew what the strangers would bring, as she had seen it before. But there was still a chance, she could still keep the ##a16e08|Nymph## close to the heart of Eden.\n\n##a16e08|Reverie##'s mind stirs with thoughts of the stranger and his path. He had travelled the world she knew only by tales on the wind, and as she rolled the now moss covered pebble in her hand, she wondered. What kind of armour would she have carried in his world?\n\nBut as ambition clouds the mind from reality, so too was the Garden's sky darkening. She would be safe from the storm in this cave, as ##blue|Kindred## had promised she would be. But how long would safety be enough for her? Her story was //finally// unwinding, and she went to sleep with dreams of how it could unfold.\n\n[[=]]\n##a16e08|//A world that's beginning to unwind;//##\n##a16e08|//An ambitious dream sprouting in one's mind;//##\n##a16e08|//Merry, merry peace of Eden.//##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Act 2**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//The Union of Heaven and Hell//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Log - 02>>**[[/size]]\n\n**Personnel Present:** Senior Researcher Luca Armaros; Agent “Ukulele”.\n-----\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n//<The camera feed switches on, displaying the base setup of Camp Milton: a Foundation issued tent with sleeping bags inside, a campfire, and several boxes for drone delivery. Over one of these boxes, two bright yellow hazmat suits are draped. In front of the camera, Agent Ukulele is packing his backpack with gear and double rations. He appears out of focus. It is just before dawn, and the environment of the shore is still mostly an outline.>//\n\n**Armaros:** You can just eat the food here, you know. Samples were triple checked and clean.\n\n//<He turns to his own gear satchel, placing his sketchbook next to his scanner. When he looks back up again, Agent Ukulele is still out of focus, a shadow obscuring his face. His silhouette appears a little taller and broader in the shoulders.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I still think this idea is utter lunacy.\n\n**Armaros:** As was noted in the report.\n\n**Ukulele:** You did what?\n\n**Armaros:** You said I could quote you on that, so I did. Either way, we still got the go-ahead.\n\n//<Ukulele takes out his weapon, carefully checking the cylinder and putting on the safety. He mutters something under his breath.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I'll try it your way, but if it all goes down the shitter, I've got my orders.\n\n//<Armaros' Stabilisation Filter corrects for Ukulele's exaggerated silhouette, but his image remains blurry.>//\n\n**Armaros:** I am glad you're willing to restrain yourself to our inferior protocols of not-murder. //<He straps on an oversized camping backpack>// Back here at 1900 hours. If anything comes up, use the radio. Code 231 if you can’t talk.\n\n**Ukulele:** What if the Green keeps away?\n\n**Armaros:** That shouldn’t be a problem for you, should it? Going by your reputation.\n\n//<A rumble of thunder is heard. Both men turn towards the sky above the centre of the island. Several dark clouds have gathered around the peak of the mountain range.>//\n\n**Armaros:** Although we might need to cut it short if the weather worsens.\n\n//<A rough wind moves through the nearby treeline. Ukulele holsters his weapon and pops his collar before taking eastward. Armaros takes the road to the west, retracing his steps from the day before.>//\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**- 𝄡 -**[[/size]] \n\nMoving eastward, the ##green|Hunter## follows the path he did before, swatting at the same or similar branches. More than once he imagined a ##red|snake-like creature## slithering towards him, only to find a vine instead. Of course, a snake is only a deceiver because the story made it one. It was only a symbol, was it not?\n\nWhat would the story make him?\n\nThe one told by the ##a16e08|Nymph## the day before had not left his mind. It had spoken of a similar path as the one he’d chosen to walk — had it truly been choice, or an obligation? Had there ever been a difference? Without realising, he had placed his hand on the back of his neck, reaching for an answer he didn’t want to hear.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/CI9h3Bg.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe worst had been the look she’d given him. //Pity//. Something worth even less than forgiveness, and he neither asked nor deserved either.\n\nHe still grumbles on his own as the ##red|storm## picks up, soaking the greenery he traverses.  Slipping and slithering through the mud, he makes his way to a winding tree, hiding under its leaves the size of lily pads. As always, he’d wait out the water.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**<<SCP-8166-1 Exploration Log - 02>>**[[/size]]\n\n**Personnel Present:** Agent Ukulele.\n-----\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n//<Ukulele wipes water off the front of his camera. Above, the deluge of rain can be heard falling down and gathering on the large leaves of the tree.>//\n\n//<To his left, bushes begin to crumple, before the familiar figure of Reverie materializes from the forest. Ukulele jumps at her appearance, slipping in the mud but keeping upright by grabbing a nearby tree branch. The attached leaf twitches and drops a large splash of water over Ukulele's right side.>//\n\n**Reverie:** You’re not wearing your armour today.\n\n//<She shakes the water off her fur. Ukulele turns away from her, trying to clear water from his radio.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Wish I had. I’m bloody soaked. Of course, Paradise opens a doorway to England and turns into a rainy hellhole.\n\n//<Reverie sits on a large, exposed root.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Did I scare you again?\n\n**Ukulele:** Again?! 'Course not, just didn't see you coming. Don't have eyes in the back of my head, now have I?\n\n//<Reverie looks at the back of his head and neck, then frowns.>//\n\n**Reverie:** I could dry your clothes for you.\n\n//<Her fur lights up slightly, and the filter picks up ontokinetic interference.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** No! No, it's fine. //<He coughs to steady his voice.>// I have a backup coat.\n\n//<He removes his backpack and places it on a low-hanging branch leaf, pulling out its contents quickly. Aside from a pile of rations and some of Armaros’ measuring equipment, he takes out a tightly wrapped windbreaker.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Just no rubbernecking, alright?\n\n//<He turns away from her, but keeps her in sight as he removes the jacket and shirt he’d been wearing, dumping them on a large leaf before grabbing the coat.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Humans have interesting patterns on their fur.\n\n**Ukulele:** I told you not to watch!\n\n**Reverie:** You said not to rubberneck! And my neck isn't made out of rubber, so I’m sure I’m not doing that. Do all humans have those patterns?\n\n**Ukulele:** You talking about scars? No, not always. They're from old wounds.\n\n**Reverie:** When you fought monsters?\n\n//<He grins and points to a deep scar on his left shoulder.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** This one is from a Green up in Finland, wanting to build a Winter Wonderland, and that -- //<he points to acid-like splotches on his side>// -- is from a Blue who tried to drain a whole lake in the Netherlands. Couldn’t reverse that tragedy completely.\n\n**Reverie:** And those?\n\n//<She points to two symmetrical scars just under Ukulele’s pecs. He looks down at them, then quickly zips up the coat.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** A choice that felt right for me.\n\n**Reverie:** And the others weren't?\n\n**Ukulele:** Weren't what? //<He sighs and shakes his head.>// This is different, it's -- it’s complicated. I don’t make the world less safe when I am who I am today.\n\n**Reverie:** Am I?\n\n**Ukulele:** I -- I don’t know that yet.\n\n//<He instinctively touches the back of his neck, covering up a circular birthmark, then shakes his head and starts repacking his gear.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** It’s about choices. Some people are just too dangerous to make them.\n\n**Reverie:** So you help them make the right one?\n\n**Ukulele:** I make sure they can't make the wrong one.\n\n//<He takes a deep breath, his fingers following the contour of the Foundation logo on his coat.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Got to be honest here, this is not really my routine. Don't really do the whole tea-table talk if I can help it.\n\n**Reverie:** What's a routine?\n\n**Ukulele:** Something you do so much you don't really think about it anymore. Something that becomes a second nature.\n\n**Reverie:** Like me and caring for the Garden? //<Smiling>// Kindred says we are all made with the potential for creation. Shape the world around us, make it grow.\n\n**Ukulele:** I must've missed that memo.\n\n**Reverie:** You create death.\n\n//<He stares at her, though Reverie appears oblivious as to why.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Life and death, the union of nature. Death is needed for growth, for a cycle to continue. There always needs to be a balance.\n\n//<She turns to a branch Ukulele snapped off with his boot, regrowing it with a familiar hum and glow.>//\n\n**Reverie:** I like the mark on your neck the most.\n\n**Ukulele:** //(Softly)// I was born with that one.\n\n//<He quietly reattaches his camera to his coat. Before strapping his backpack, he takes out two of the ration bars and unwraps one.>//\n\n**Reverie:** I’ve never seen it rain like this before. Have you?\n\n//<He chokes on his protein bar.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Way too much. That’s England for you.\n\n**Reverie:** What’s an 'England'?\n\n**Ukulele:** You might be better off not knowing.\n\n**Reverie:** The winds talked of a faraway land of knights, castles and wild magic.\n\n**Ukulele:** Maybe once upon a time it was. //<He pauses.>// It's a tough subject. Humans prefer stability, a world they can understand and predict, even if it's limiting. Most of them don't really jibe with the whole changing reality thing.\n\n**Reverie:** And you help them keep this stability? \n\n//<Ukulele is silent as he is checking his weapon and reholstering it.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** I suppose I do. //(Sighing)// It's not that simple.\n\n**Reverie:** Why?\n\n//<He doesn't answer, chewing his protein bar longer than it needs to. After a moment, he takes the second one and holds it out to Reverie.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Want some?\n\n//<She carefully takes it, messing with the wrapper until it rips open. She sniffs the bar and makes a face.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** It’s not too bad, once you get used to it.\n\n**Reverie:** It smells like droppings.\n\n//<She carefully bites off a tiny bit, then heaves.>//\n\n**Reverie:** Why would you eat that when you can eat whatever you want!?\n\n//<Her fur flares up. The feed shifts out of focus. When the Stabilisation Filter kicks back in, Reverie is holding a pomegranate, which she starts to happily devour. Its red juices stain the fur on her arms and around her mouth a dark red.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** Rude. You're not supposed to exchange a gift in front of the giver.\n\n**Reverie:** You should've given a better gift then.\n\n**Ukulele:** //(Jokingly)// I'll relay your complaint to the Mess Hall.\n\n**Reverie:** So you think it’s sometimes better to hide?\n\n**Ukulele:** I think it's worth it to survive. Not everything in my world goes together, so you have to figure out how to fit into it all. Truth be told, you're the first person who didn't run in the other direction when they found out what I am and what I do.\n\n**Reverie:** Instead, you did the running!\n\n**Ukulele:** We can forget about that part, can't we?\n\n//<Reverie giggles and nods.>//\n\n**Reverie:** I haven't met a lot of people before.\n\n**Ukulele:** I know another guy you could meet, but he's a bit of a knob.\n\n**Reverie:** Is that a good thing?\n\n**Ukulele:** //(Laughing)// Not generally, but he's harmless.\n\n**Reverie:** It's odd. I know every part of this Garden, every creek and creature. There is plenty to care for and observe. It's just --\n\n**Ukulele:** Lonely.\n\n**Reverie:** Yeah.\n\n//<They sit and eat in silence for a while, as the storm rages on. Loud cracks of thunder and flashes of lightning sound through the skies. After a particularly loud crack, Ukulele looks up to the sky.>//\n\n**Ukulele:** It’s getting worse.\n\n**Reverie:** We should seek shelter. //<She jumps to her hooves and smiles brightly.>// Come, I want to show you something!\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**- 🜂 -**[[/size]]\n\nThe Archivist makes his way through the forest, noticing the imprints of his boot in mud and grass. He is still mindful in how he steps, careful not to crush any insects underfoot. As he walks, he notices a collection of cranes triumphantly standing in the shallow bank of the river. Deciding he has some time to kill, he places down his large backpack and observes them for what seems like hours. He notes down everything he can about them: their wingspan, the colour of their plumage, the manner in which they pick around the dead cattails to find small amphibians and fish.\n\n[[div class=\"Picturebook\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/B9YQmBV.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhen it's finally time for him to leave, he watches as one opens its mighty wings to take flight into the still dawn sky. He goes to check his watch, but decides to just leave it be. The lack of sunrise would allow him to discover more, to dig deep into what this place truly has hidden. He wanted to know more about this world, every little change in hue. Especially if these changes would reveal him to be more than just an observer, but an active participant in shaping its future. \n\nIt was a thought that causes him to shudder.

A crack of thunder can be heard in the distance. Her expression then abruptly falls.>//\n\n**Kindred:** Come inside, child. There is a storm brewing.\n\n//<Armaros turns, following her gaze. The first spats of rain become visible.>//\n\n**Armaros:** Somehow I didn't expect to have to bring an umbrella to Paradise.

Armaros walks over and takes up the knife while Kindred is preparing scraps of meat and bones from what appears to be skinned rodents. She’s humming a melody.>//\n\n**Kindred:** A good soup needs a strong broth. Good bones are powerful, a sturdy ingredient to build from. Your companion knows this, of course.\n\n**Armaros:** I'm not sure I follow?\n\n**Kindred:** The one without glory, who betrayed his own kind to preserve stability.[[footnote]]It is suspected the entity is referring to the GOC's Ichabod Campaign and the effort to mass produce SRA's.

No, you don't need to know to recognise a false note.\n\n//<Armaros turns and walks over to the cauldron, sliding a heap of cut vegetables into it. He pauses for a moment as they fall into the bubbling cauldron, watching them float before sinking beneath the liquid's surface. Kindred adds a healthy amount of crushed sage and thyme, and wipes her hands on her side.>//\n\n**Kindred:** Ask your question, Luca Armaros. Don’t spare the silence.\n\n**Armaros:** Am I that much of an open book? //<He puts down the knife.>// Suppose I am.

The once beating heart of the land had fallen still, in mud and receding waters. The winds were gone, as were their promises. The Kindred spirit had departed with a cold sigh, as Paradise froze over.\n\nIn the middle of a silent, frozen wasteland sat two men: a rogue with the heart of a hunter, and a watcher who intervened.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<Armaros' blade retracts, and he looks down at the antique pen in his hand.

The man of files and logic had a long path to walk, and he would walk it alone.\n\nThere might not be forgiveness, but there is pity for the Archivist.\n\nThe Garden's scars were still fresh. The signs of battle had been covered in the white shawl of winter, but it could not fill the large gaping wound that ran its length across the ground. As the men exchanged their anger and grievances, the body of the Nymph lay to rest at the place where heaven and hell had met. Her stained fur grew paler, and her antlers buried deep in the mud. The stardust in her eyes faded as she returned to the ground.\n\nAnd to dust she would return.\n\nTime spent in cold despair is seldom swift. Grief knows no timeline and no depth.
