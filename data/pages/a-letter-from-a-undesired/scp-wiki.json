In the Letter is found the message “strad will rise for humanity”. The Foundation is unaware of any group, god or individual that goes under this title. Further investigation into “STRAD” will be required. The messenger “KRB” is believed to be Dr. Judy Baker’s, former husband, Kenneth Ray Berryhill, who had not been seen in 45 years since his departure from the Foundation along with five other researchers. This came the next day after the Foundation had responded to an explosion outside the city of Austin, Texas. Reports of strange activity in the area along with various power outages had been reported days prior to the explosion. Emergency personnel excavating the area found signs of a facility in the rubble.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**MAIL - MESSAGE ONE**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n**FROM:** Dr. Judy Baker \n**TO:** Site Director, Dr. Richardson [[footnote]] Site-16 [[/footnote]]\n**TOPIC:** Security request and Update\n       \nGood morning, \n\nThis message is concerining the letter recieved at my residence earlier this week and going forward from there. Since his departure nearly 45 years ago, the Foundation has assured me that my family would be kept far away from him. This letter we received is more than what it  appears; it is a threat, a warning. Whatever he intends to do, does not stand to benefit us or the Foundation in any given way and I highly advise that a larger effort to track down and find him be put underway immediately. I would also like to request a small security for my family at this time. \n\nUrgently, Judy Baker\n                                                                                                                           \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**MAIL - MESSAGE TWO**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n**FROM:** Site Director, Dr. Richardson \n**TO:** Dr. Judy Baker\n**TOPIC:** Re: Security request and Update\n       \nGood Afternoon, Dr. Baker \n\nTo address your concerns, the Foundation is taking this situation following the incident in Austin and the letter you received very seriously. As far as we are aware Dr. Kenneth Ray Berryhill has not resurfaced since his departure from the Foundation. The Foundation has come together with the GOC to clean up the incident outside Austin, while the ongoing investigation into the cause of the explosion is unknown, current investigators at the scene believe the explosion wasn't intentional, but until a full report is sent we won't know much. Currently, Foundation personnel have located human remains in an underground facility along with undetermined charred remains. The Foundation is currently spread thin dealing with multiple operations globally, and at this time the Foundation will grant your request for one armed security to accompany you until confirmation of Dr. Berryhill's detainment by the Foundation. I will follow up with you as more information is uncovered. \n\nSincerly, Richardson\n                                                                                                                                                      \n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]] \n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
