[[/footnote]] large enough to accommodate SCP-4944. Caffeinated fluid is to be brought to SCP-4944 every two days unless a test is being conducted, which must be approved by personnel with clearance level 4 or higher. Drains are to be installed in the ground of Site-876-C in case of a failure to bring caffeine. Drains are only to be blocked if a test if being conducted.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4944 is the designation given to two perspectives of the same object, SCP-4944-A, the appearance of a coffee machine, and SCP-4944-B, the actual physical body of SCP-4944. SCP-4944-B resembles a 100 meter long cargo vessel. Although the name cannot be deciphered, the architecture of the hull and stern of the ship can imply that the intended use of SCP-4944-B was to import exotic goods[[footnote]] This includes coffee beans.[[/footnote]] from Brazil to North America. When viewed directly[[footnote]]Photographs and videos included.[[/footnote]], SCP-4944-A has the appearance of a standard Keurig brand coffee machine, circa 2012-2016. Although bearing the appearance of a Keurig brand coffee machine, 3-dimensional digital mapping reveals the actual shape of SCP-4944 as SCP-4944-B. Although seemingly transparent, SCP-4944-B still exists physically, creating the illusion that an invisible border exists around SCP-4944-A.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=400px\n|url=3d.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A 3-dimensional digital map of SCP-4944's physical body outlined in red. Note that SCP-4944-A is not visible in the image.\n]]\n\nIf any form of caffeine enters within 10 meters of SCP-4944-B, the fog horns installed in SCP-4944-B will activate, and will only cease if the caffeine is laid in front of SCP-4944-B. Although the noise exceeds 100-135 decibels,[[footnote]] This includes audio and video files.[[/footnote]] personnel who are exposed to the sound report not hearing anything out of the ordinary while listening. Unedited audio of the noise produced by SCP-4944-B follows.\n\n,,Note: 97.7% of subjects report hearing an absence of noise during the following file.,,\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/researcherpie/10.wav\n]]\n\nWhen presented with any form of caffeine in a liquid state, the liquid will begin to evaporate at an accelerated speed, especially if the substance contains traces of coffee beans. If not given caffeine within ~2 days, SCP-4944-A will begin to excrete a brown, viscous fluid similar to that of syrup from its base. This process will proceed until presented with caffeine. At this time SCP-4944 will begin to absorb the fluid back into SCP-4944-A's water chamber,[[footnote]] On most modern coffee machine designs, the water chamber is a container that is to be filled with water, as to mix the water with the powder given to produce a hot drink.[[/footnote]] even if the amount of fluid exuded from SCP-4944 is beyond the holding capacity of the chamber. The substance produced by SCP-4944 does not have any hazardous effects, but is extremely viscid. The fluid has high levels of glucose and gelatin, causing the fluid to be highly sweet when tasted.\n\nOnce SCP-4944 has ingested caffeinated fluid, SCP-4944 will again blow its built in fog horn,[[footnote]]The pitch of this noise varies, reaching up to around 9,000 Hz, although these noises are audible to the human ear.[[/footnote]] which when viewed in a virtual oscilloscope[[footnote]]An instrument commonly used to display and analyze the waveform of electronic signals.[[/footnote]], variations of \"I'm done,\" \"coffe [sic],\" or \"More pls [sic]\" are seen. SCP-4944 also uses an abundance of emoticons[[footnote]]a representation of a facial expression formed by various combinations of keyboard characters and used to convey the writer's feelings or intended tone.[[/footnote]] using the standard \"qwerty\" keyboard. If asked a question, SCP-4944 will comply and exude a noise that when processed, will show words that vaguely answer the questions asked. This implies that SCP-4944 has some level of sapience.\n\nAn interview was scheduled with SCP-4944.\n\n||~ Question ||~ Answer seen through oscilloscope||\n|| \"What are you?\" || \"Don't care, need bean.\" || \n|| \"Why do you enjoy caffeine?\" || \"I have the addiction to coffe :(\" [sic] || \n|| \"What is the fluid you excrete when not supplied with caffeine?\"  || \"Coffe. drinky drinky.\" [sic] || \n|| \"What were you used for?\" || \"COFFE\" [sic] || \n|| \"Why do you bear the appearance of a coffee machine?\" || \"Practicing impression.\" ||\n\nAfter several more questions, it has been determined that SCP-4944 was once a cargo ship used for importing coffee beans from Brazil to North America. SCP-4944 claims to have an addiction to caffeine and coffee, likely from the abundance of coffee bean and other exotic goods shipments made with SCP-4944-B. For more information on SCP-4944's sapience, see Document-944G.\n\nSeveral tests have been conducted on SCP-4944 for further research into what SCP-4944 consumes and the limits of such.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Experiments 491-8\" hide=\"Credentials Accepted.\"]]\n= **Base**\n> [Experiment-#]\n> **Request:** [Request]\n> \n> **Status:** [Approved/denied]\n> \n> **Results:** [Results]\n----\n> Experiment-491\n> **Request:** Black coffee.\n> \n> **Status:** Approved.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4944 \"drinks\" the coffee within 5 hours.\n\n> Experiment-493\n> **Request:** Espresso with two shots of caffeine.\n> \n> **Status:** Approved.\n> \n> **Results:** Drink is absorbed within 2 hours.
