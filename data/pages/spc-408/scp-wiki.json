Information is organized in the order it was first documented. Benjamin Kondraki is considered a Centre traitor and a high level threat. \n\nAll Centre agents must report any sightings of Benjamin Kondraki or SPC-408 immediately. Following a report, Centre agents have permission to engage Benjamin Kondraki in pugilism.\n\nSearch, Punch, Conquer.\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name= https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/363656579/large.png|caption=SPC-408, as captured by Agent Kondraki |width=1000px|align= center]]\n\n**Project #:** SPC-408\n\n**Selachian Pugnātorial Capabilities:** Due to SPC-408's highly adaptable illusion abilities and sizable mass, SPC-408 can appear functionally invisible, allowing for use in up close monitoring and punching without risk towards Centre affiliates. SPC-408 possesses the ability to communicate and reason, however, it has refused to do so with anyone except discoverer and current owner Agent Kondraki. Usage of SPC-408 by Agent Kondraki for up close encounters and photography of particularly difficult or troublesome selachian entities has been approved by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-105 Dr. Iris Thompson] as part of WORLD IRIS's global pugnatorial coverage.  \n\n[[include component:image-block name= https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/51319051/large.jpg|caption=Juvenile SPC-408 instance taking the appearance of a //Myliobatis californica//, as captured by Agent Kondraki|width=300px|align= right]]\n\n**Project Components:** SPC-408 is made up of 30-50 Batomorphi who behave as a single entity through what is presumed to be a form of hive mind communication. SPC-408 instances secrete a deviant substance, which, when entering contact with water, will alter its light-refracting properties, allowing SPC-408 to create complex illusions.[[footnote]] SPC-408 struggles to create illusions when deprived of a body of water. [[/footnote]] When threatened, SPC-408 has been observed to take on the form and appearance of threatening creatures, such as a pod of dolphins and other large selachian entities. \n\nDue to SPC-408's illusionary ablities, it is impossible to determine the exact number of entities that make up SPC-408 at any given time. The appearance and species of SPC-408 also varies, but each fully grown member is consistently between 40cm (15.7 in) and 60cm (23.6 in) in width, even if this is an unusual size for a member of its species. SPC-408 reproduces asexually, and when one member of SPC-408 dies in any manner, it is immediately consumed by the rest of the mass and a new member will take its place.\n\nSPC-408 is entirely loyal to Agent Kondraki.\n\n**Addendum 408-1: Acquisition**\n\nSPC-408 was originally mistaken for one incredibly large selachian entity and The SPCS Christine was assigned to follow SPC-408's trail for monitoring and pugnātorial purposes. Agent Kondraki was stationed aboard the SPCS Christine during this voyage as a marine photographer. On ██/██/████, Agent Kondraki took a fall off of the SPCS Christine and did not surface for several hours. The SPCS Christine reported him as dead and continued on its course, however the SPCS Christine could not locate SPC-408 following this incident.\n\nThree hours after the initial report of his death, Agent Kondraki appeared at Site-19 surrounded by a large mass of Batomorphi, later identified as SPC-408. Upon interrogation, he described being rescued by SPC-408 and requesting that they bring him to shore. Agent Kondraki failed to provide an adequate explanation for why the initial accident occurred, nor why he didn't reboard the SPCS Christine. Seeing as he wasn't injured, Agent Kondraki was permitted to return to the field. \n\n**Addendum 408-2: Overheard Conversation**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++ Overheard Outside Site-19\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n**Foreword**: On ██/██/████, at 2113, Dr. A.

Neither man can be seen, but camera 24-B captured the following audio.\n-----\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Alto! I want to talk to you. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** Well, you've got my attention. \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** I would rather say this somewhere else. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** You’ll say it right here, or you won’t say it at all.\n\n//<Silence for thirty seconds.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** You heard about SPC-408?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Yes, I heard about your new //thing// Imago Green has let you play with.\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** And you know how I discovered it?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Do you have a point to make, or is this small talk?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** I didn't fall, Alto. \n\n//<Silence for thrity seconds.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** There were thirty people on that ship. At least ten people on the deck with me, and one of them pushed me. And there's no way no one else saw what happened, but not one person reported it. \n\n//<Silence for thrity seconds.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** That's why I had 408 bring me to the site.

Given recent events and the Centre's growing distrust of Agent Kondraki, this interaction was deemed inappropriate and documented here.\n-----\n\n//<Kondraki enters IMAGO GREEN headquarters. Every wall is covered floor to ceiling in TV screens, displaying WORLD IRIS's Global monitoring system. Thompson's chair is on a crane, which allows her to maneuver around the room and reach each screen as desired. She reaches into a screen and punches a shark. When she spots Kondraki, the crane lowers her to the floor and she steps off to approach him, shaking her arm dry in the process.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Evening, Iris!\n\n//<Kondraki holds up a stack of photographs. Thompson reaches out to take them from him, Kondraki holds them above his head and out of Thompson's reach.>// \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Have you eaten lunch today?\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** Excuse you?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** I know you get really wrapped up in your work. Did you eat today?\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** I don't need you to play games with me, agent. \n\n//<Thompson takes a picture of Kondraki with her personal camera. Thompson reaches through her picture to take the photographs from him.

Kondraki turns in a circle to look at every screen.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** It can't be great for your eyes for you to be staring at these screens all day. We need to get you a window for some natural light.\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** I get plenty of natural light through my cameras. \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** //<Stutters.>// Well- uh, yeah, I'm sure.

But I've just been thinking. Every time you send me out I have to go farther and farther to find sharks that haven't already been documented. And if they're so hard to find, they really can't be bothering anyone, can they?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** //<Whispered.>// And there are so many beautiful things in the ocean to photograph.\n\n//<Thompson tsks and shakes her head.>//\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** Sharks are an abomination! As long as they exist, they must be punched! \n\n//<She turns her back to him.>//\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** Clearly you've been underwater for too long, the sea has gotten into your brain. Take a few days off to clear your head. \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** ... Okay. \n\n//<Kondraki lingers by the door, mouth open as if to say something else. After a few seconds, he closes it and exits IMAGO GREEN headquarters.>//\n\n-----\n**Notes:** Following Oceans-7's collapse, Agent Kondraki played an important role in Dr. Thompson's care, and was involved in Thompson's transition into Project IMAGO GREEN. There are concerns that, given Agent Kondraki's personal relationship with Thompson, his selachian sympathies may hinder Project IMAGO GREEN. Agent Kondraki is no longer authorized to interact directly with Thompson, and any photographs taken by Agent Kondraki will be delivered to Thompson by a third party. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 408-4: Suspicious Interactions**\n\nConcerns about Agent Kondraki's loyalties have been debated among Centre officials.

He disappointed me. \n\n**Interviewer:** Have you been able to make visual contact with him since the incident?\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** No. It stands to reason that, having worked on the project just as long as I have, he would know its blind spots. \n\n**Interviewer:** And on a more personal level, how do you feel about Kondraki's betrayal? He had quite a bit of presence in your life, it would make sense if you felt more than a little upset over this. \n\n**Dr. Thompson:** I am angry about the destruction of my site, and I am disappointed about the loss of a promising and useful agent. Otherwise, I have no personal feelings on the matter. \n\n//<Thompson lets out a heavy, shaky breath through her nose.>//\n\n**Dr. Thompson:** I have no personal feelings on the matter.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n1512: Pugilist in training Draven Kondraki witnesses a disturbance in the waters surrounding Site-19 and runs to make the following phone call on a Centre landline:\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** This is Kondraki- uh the uh, younger one- reporting a potential shar- selachian-\n\n1518: SPC-408 and SPC-682 launch out of the water. Agent Kondraki can be seen clinging onto SPC-682's dorsal fin. An SPC-408 strikes Draven Kondraki in the back, sending him to the ground. \n\n1520: SPC-682 trashes about, propelling itself forward via galumphing. Agent Kondraki falls off of SPC-682. SPC-408 scatters. Despite moving incredibly slow, SPC-682 rampages across the Site. All trained pugilists converge to gain control of SPC-682, allowing Agent Kondraki to  maneuver unhindered. \n\n1534: The following conversation is captured of camera 230-R:\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Kid? What are you doing here!\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Dad! What the hell is wrong with you!?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Come on. It's not safe here. \n\n//<Kondraki attempts to approach Draven. Draven backs up against a wall.>//\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Get away from me! You- you shark sympathizer! \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Look, kid! Everything this place has ever told you is a lie. For once, listen to your father and come with me!\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Why should I?! You let a shark loose on my home!\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Why do you have to be so difficult?! Don't you trust your own father?!\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** No! I don't!\n\n1600: Dr. Thompson punches Agent Kondraki using camera 230-R. He screams and covers his bloody nose. Draven Kondraki runs away. SPC-408 breaks camera 230-R.\n\n1632: SPC-682's trashing prevents immediate capture. Several MTFs are knocked down. 30% of Site-19 is turned to rubble. SPC-408 begins breaking every camera. \n\n1642: SPC-682 is restrained by Centre agents via repeated group punching, but continues to thrash and destroy  the surrounding area. Agent Kondraki makes a run towards the docking bay.\n\n1700: Draven Kondraki intersects Agent Kondraki's path. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Post Incident Interview - Draven Kondraki\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n**Interviewer:** Could you tell us a little more about your relationship with Agent Kondraki?\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** I mean, he was my dad.\n\n**Interviewer:** Were you particularly close?\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** When I was younger, sure. We both liked photography and I thought what he did for work was really cool. After IMAGO GREEN I didn't seem him much at all. \n\n**Interviewer:** You stated in your report that you confronted your father right before his escape, can you tell me about how that interaction went down?\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Well, I got in his way and I told him to stop. He asked me why I was doing this, and I told him he was a Centre enemy. He just kept calling me kid. \n\n//<Draven sniffles and wipes his face on his sleeve. Interviewer offers him a box of tissues.>//\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** I told him to //just come quietly//. I thought maybe if he did, then I could prove that this was just one of his episodes and the Centre wouldn't hurt him-\n\n**Interviewer:** Episodes?\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Um, right, so, sometimes when he came home he could be really sick and irritable. And he'd have these episodes where he'd just be really out of control. It really scared my mother. And I'm sure that's what was happening earlier. \n\n**Interviewer:** I see. Continue. \n\n**Draven Kondraki:** He asked me why I didn't trust me, and apologized for... being absent. Said he never wanted it to be that way. \n\n//<Draven audibly swallows.>//\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** He asked me to come with him. Said I was free to come with him any time, that he would always welcome me in again. He tried to hug me, and that's when I got defensive and tried to subdue him. \n\n//<Draven laughs weakly.>//\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** Last thing I heard him say was that he was sorry. \n\n**Interviewer:** He had a very limited presence in your life, right? You don't hold any particular loyalty to him?\n\n//<Draven shakes his head.>//\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** He's //my// dad, but I know he always wanted to raise her more than me. \n\n**Interviewer:** What do you mean by that?\n\n**Draven Kondraki:** I- would rather not get into that here, with you. If that's alright. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n1716: SPC-408 pins Draven to the ground. Agent Kondraki manhandles Draven into a rowboat and has half of SPC-408 drag him away from the Centre. Draven attempts several times to dive into the water, but is prevented from doing so by SPC-408. \n\n1730: Agent Kondraki boards the SPCS Beatrice. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Post Incident Interview - Dr. Clef\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n**Interviewer:** Could you tell us a little more about your relationship with Agent Kondraki?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** You want to know if we fucked?\n\n**Interviewer:** W- well you weren't exactly private about your relationship. \n\n//<Clef laughs.>//\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Me and Konny worked together for a good while, then we got busy with other projects. I saw him less than his son did. \n\n**Interviewer:** Were you involved with the SPC-682 incident?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** No, I'm sure you'll find fifty pugilists in training who will confirm my exact location. \n\n**Interviewer:** We have footage of you allowing the traitor to escape. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** How was I supposed to know he was a traitor at the time? All I knew was that we had been attacked. He could've been up on that boat for any number of reasons!\n\n**Interviewer:** Our evidence implies the contrary. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** I've given my statement.\n\n**Interviewer:** You understand that we will be monitoring all personnel close to the traitor? If you attempt to make contact with Agent Kondraki, we will know.\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Believe me, I have no desire to go after him. And I think the Centre shouldn't waste their time going after him either. \n\n**Interviewer:** You believe we should just let an attack like this go unpunished!?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** No, I //know// you aren't going to find him, and that energy would be better spent elsewhere.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 408-6: Ongoing Investigation**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Incident Report\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n**Forward:** Last known footage captured of former Agent Kondraki.\n-----\n//<Kondraki is seen standing on board the SPCS Beatrice. SPC-408 is in the water, slowly pushing the Beatrice away from the docs. Clef approaches the docs and is spotted by Kondraki.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Alto! You came!\n\n**Dr. Clef:** What the hell do you think you're doing?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** We're leaving. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** You and... it? \n\n//<Clef leans over the docs to look at SPC-408. An SPC-408 instance jumps out of the water and splashes him.>//\n\n**Dr. Clef:** You're really just going to run away? After that fucking stunt you pulled?!\n\n//<Kondraki turns his back to Clef and works on unfurling the Beatrice's sails.>// \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** You know why I had to do it.\n\n**Dr. Clef:** No, actually! I don't know why you had to throw the world's biggest temper tantrum and flush your entire career down the toilet!\n\n//<Kondraki turns around to grip the side of the Beatrice.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Either they try to kill me on their terms or they try to kill me on my terms! What's left for me here, anyway!?\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Your son, Ben!\n\n//<Kondraki's shoulders slump and he grimaces.>//\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** The Centre has gotten into his head. That was my failure. \n\n**Dr. Clef:** Damn you. \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Come with me. \n\n//<Clef visibly startles.>//\n\n**Dr. Clef:** What?\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** Let's go, let's leave. No one can stop us!\n\n**Dr. Clef:** You absolute cunt.\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** We never needed the Centre. 408 will keep us safe. It can just be us.\n\n**Dr. Clef:** What the hell do you think is out there for me, huh?!\n\n**Agent Kondraki:** //<Whispered.>// I am. \n\n//<Silence for two minutes. During this time Kondraki paces around the Beatrice.>//\n\n**Dr. Clef:** You'll never find peace out there. \n\n**Agent Kondraki:** And are you ever going to find peace here?\n\n//<Neither says a word. Kondraki enters the helm of the Beatrice. After five minutes the SPCS Beatrice begins sailing away. Clef remains at the doc's edge until the Beatrice can no longer be seen.>//\n\n**Dr. Clef:** Bastard...\n\n[[include component:image-block name= https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/444724773/large.jpg|caption=Last known picture of SPC-408, as captured by Agent Kondraki.|width=500px|align= center]]\n-----\n**Notes:** As of ██/██/████, Benjamin Kondraki has not been recovered.
