It is currently being utilized as a containment site for anomalies that cannot be contained in intelligible reality.\n\nSCP-⌘ is contained. SCP-⌘ has breached containment. SCP-⌘ was created by the Surrealistics Department through unknown means.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Or vice versa.[[/span]] SCP-⌘ has devoured the world. \n\nSite-⌘ is a mayfly reality, a camera shutter flick-blinking in and out of actuality. Site-⌘ is a shout. Or a whisper. Site-⌘ is a page torn from the first and only book in the Wanderer's Library. Site-⌘ crowns the Shivering Kingdom. Site-⌘ was the last blue swallowtail butterfly.\n\nMemorize the last few paragraphs before continuing onward; there will be a written test immediately following the conclusion of this document.\n\nSCP-⌘ cannot be perceived without use of [[[scp-4923 | agnostics]]], existing in a state of pure unreason. The act of entering SCP-⌘ likewise requires agnostics, as doors/wounds/chimneys into SCP-⌘ cannot be found by those with constrained thoughts.\n\nDo not read the following addendum before ingesting your prescribed dosage of agnostics. If you are experiencing one or more extreme side effects, that means it’s working.\n\n**Addendum ⌘-1: Site Director Morrison's 4-Step Guide to Entering Site-⌘**\n\n# Rocking trickles amputation ministry. Pawns slip double.\n# Mice cogs leak averages. Spine! Spond! Shiver!\n# Teeth egress. House egress. Obligation egress. Consider mumbler chemistry slant.\n# Shark the soundtrack, please. Hours spindle north doors. Fie. Fever. Froth. Four.\n\n**Addendum ⌘-2: Excerpt from the Personal Journal of Assistant Janitor Ray Taeuber**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nI had a dream, one moonlit night.\n\nWell, that's not entirely true. The moon was inside-out and a false night was reflected in the pool of its smile and it was more the //idea// of a dream-- but for the sake of a coherent narrative, I will say that there was a moon, it was night, and I was dreaming.\n\nIn my dream, I was in the central chamber of Site-⌘, standing before the Fourfold Destroyer. He gave me his crown and I was demolished by the weight of it; I was made asunder. The chasm of me went on forever. For an eternity, I held tight to the battered cliff face of my splintered consciousness. I shook, naked and alone, against the icy gale, my eyes squeezed shut. Kilometers beneath my tangling feet, an ocean of frothing stomach acid churned with vacant hunger.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I realized that I had never left the containment chamber. There was no cliff face, no starveling sea, no glacial winds. The walls of the cell had been made translucent-- or rather, there had never been any walls from the very beginning.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw the world as it wasn't. The crown burned bright and cold against my brow. I fell from a cliff face that didn't exist and opened myself to the Shivering Kingdom.\n\nI might vacation there, someday.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum ⌘-3: Addendum ⌘-4**\n\nAs of 01/31/1960, the Fourfold Destroyer has been promoted to director of Site-⌘. Containment procedures are to remain unaltered.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n@@ @@",
