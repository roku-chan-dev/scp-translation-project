Designated long-range combatants will be armed with M16A1 rifles from MPD SWAT.\n\nLieutenant Hernandez and Captain Peters will be occupying an unmarked squad car from across the street for immediate support. Several other places (see Document OYJ.02 for specific placement) will also contain plainclothes or otherwise disguised officers.\n\nAt 11:00, Detectives Richard Garrett and Manuel Acosta (undercover as sellers \"Brad\" and \"De la Cruz\") will meet the buyers. They will be accompanied by Foundation liaison Haskell, who is masquerading as a middleman. Acosta will also be outfitted with a wire to listen in on the conversation.\n\nOnce the buyers trade off the money and receive the cardocran, they are to be immediately arrested. The MPD will be around on standby for the SCID's signal. \n\nShould any of the plan deviate or if it is apparent that the situation will escalate, the sting is to be immediately ended and the area secured by the SCID and MPD.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-green border-white text-white\" data-title=\"AUDIO TAPE.2\"]]\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n{{[TAPE START]}}\n[[/=]]\n[[table class=\"dialog\"]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n//Acosta can be heard practicing breathing techniques.//\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nGARRETT\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nNervous?\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nACOSTA\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nHell yea, I'm nervous, man.

The cause of the shootout was also investigated; it was found to be caused by the misjudgment of SCID Captain James Peters, who mistakenly thought UIU Agent Ivanovic was pulling out a pistol.\n\nCaptain Peters has been demoted and put on unpaid administrative leave for a month.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**ON UIU PRESCENCE**\n[[/div]]\n\nA unit of the FBIUIU was present at the time of the incident to carry out a sting operation against Foundation researchers possibly selling small amounts of SCP-5487 to the general public. Further investigation into this claim has uncovered a chain of misunderstandings stemming from a partnership with the UIU, curated by ████, over proceedings and undercover operations including the use of 5487. No other UIU presence was determined within the recent events.\n\n\nThe FBIUIU has admitted their mistake over their wrongly-implemented investigation and misunderstanding of ████'s good intentions.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**OVERALL**\n[[/div]]\n\nFurther investigation into illegal production and distribution of SCP-5487 will be henceforth operated by the main branch of the Foundation. The SCID will be limited to low-level operations (with prior Foundation approval) and executing specific stakeouts/raids as given by the Foundation. This agreement will continue indefinitely until the Foundation believes the SCID is capable enough to handle such large cases without prompting or promoting unacceptable incidents.\n\n\nThe failure of YELLOWJACKET rests squarely on each and every involved member of the SCID.\n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-red border-white text-white\" data-title=\"WARNING\"]]\n[[=]]\nYou are accessing LEVEL 5 CLASSIFIED material.

Foundation personnel eventually stabilized the most flagrant side-effects of the 5487 prototypes and codified them into the final SCP-5487 drug.\n\nFollowing the lead of PENTAGRAM in drug-related offerings, the Foundation dispersed the process of making 5487 to certain anomalous groups with the intention of receiving payments on its licensing. After enough money was circulated through this process to support the Foundation's own 5487 production cycle, the Special Crimes Investigative Division (SCID) in Miami was employed to unknowingly remove most major competitors.\n\nDespite a recent altercation over SCP-5487 involving the FBIUIU, SCID, and MPD-Vice, the major 5487 operation was not affected. Fault was placed on Foundation Liaison Mike Haskell and SCID Lieutenant Jaimie Hernandez, who were later terminated. Internal Agent Peters has been commended for his service in quickly bringing the affair to a close.\n\nThe 5487 operation will continue as long as it is profitable for the Foundation to do so.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5486]]] | SCP-5487 | [[[SCP-5488]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **FILENAME:** scid-logo.png\n> **TITLE:** SCID Logo\n> **AUTHOR:** EstrellaYoshte/JakdragonX/Croquembouche\n> **LICENSE:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **SOURCE:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:turbo-vision\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **FILENAME:** cardocran-scale-1.png\n> **TITLE:** Cardocran Scale 1\n> **AUTHOR:** DMTrott\n> **LICENSE:** CC-BY-SA 4.0 INT\n> **SOURCE:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peruvian_Flake_Cocaine.jpg\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **FILENAME:** cardocran-powder.png\n> **TITLE:** Cardocran Powder\n> **AUTHOR:** An employee of the DEA/uploaded by Anetode\n> **LICENSE:** Public Domain\n> **SOURCE:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CocaineHydrochloridePowder.jpg\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **FILENAME:** cardocran-early.png\n> **TITLE:** Prototype Cardocran Base\n> **AUTHOR:** Ed (Edgar181)\n> **LICENSE:** Public Domain\n> **SOURCE:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cocaine_analog_220f.svg\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@",
