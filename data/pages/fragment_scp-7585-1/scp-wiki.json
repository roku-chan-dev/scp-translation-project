Medications must be administered twice daily by qualified nursing staff.[[footnote]]See File 7585-4 or contact Dr. Dwight for full details on medications, dosages and other interventions.[[/footnote]]\n\nRequests by SCP-7585 for entertainment and amenities may be granted following approval by Dr. Dwight. Biweekly exercise consisting of supervised walks through designated areas of the site should be conducted, subject's health permitting.  A specially designed portable SRA is to be affixed to the subject's oxygen tank during these walks.  Weekly therapy sessions are also to be conducted.\n\nExperiments regarding SCP-7585's anomalous capabilities are not recommended.  Any such experiments must first obtain the signed approval of Dr. Dwight and at least three level 4 personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7585 is a 17 year old white male with dark hair and a height of 175 cm,[[footnote]]5'9\"[[/footnote]] also known as Ryan Greenfeld.  SCP-7585 is a Class-3 reality bender, capable of significant arbitrary modification of objects and organisms within his line of sight as well as the manifestation of arbitrary objects of moderate size.[[footnote]]Subject has specifically claimed he can manifest any object he would be able to lift comfortably with both arms, although this has not yet been experimentally confirmed.  It is worth noting that SCP-7585's abilities are clumsy, and any complex objects manifested will be nonfunctional.[[/footnote]]\n\nWhenever SCP-7585 uses his ontokinetic abilities, he also unconsciously and involuntarily influences all living cells within a large area, increasing the rate of mutation during cell division.[[footnote]]Range of effect is variable but does not seem to exceed one kilometer.[[/footnote]]  The primary effect on humans is similar to that of radiation poisoning and is believed to have contributed to the deaths of about fifty civilians in the town of ██████.  While SCP-7585's own cells are immune to this effect, he does suffer from the effects on his gut flora and other elements of his body's microbiome.  Additional anomalies related to this effect have been observed but not explored experimentally due to concerns about contagious pathogens and the general health of the subject, see Addendum 7585-1 for further details.\n\n**Addendum 7585-1, Discovery:** SCP-7585 was recovered from the town of ██████ by MTF Epsilon-6, who were investigating reports consistent with the emergence of a Class-3 or 4 reality bender.[[footnote]]In this case, modifications of structures without discernible cause, several unexplained and apparently un-investigated disappearances, and a general spike in local sightings of paranormal activity.[[/footnote]] Upon arrival, agents discovered SCP-7585 in an otherwise abandoned house in the suburbs.  The architecture in the neighbourhood was notably distorted.\n\nBluish fungal growths were found all over the walls and floor of the home.  Numerous large fleshy lumps were scattered in the kitchen, later analysis found these to be composed of homogenous undifferentiated animal-like tissue.[[footnote]]DNA contained segments which resembled the human genome, but was mainly composed of apparently random sequences not found in other organisms.[[/footnote]]  SCP-7585 was located in a child's bedroom.  A significant amount of vomit and an increased density of the fungus-like growth covered the floor of the room. SCP-7585 was lying in bed, suffering from a high fever.  He made no effort to resist apprehension.\n\nSCP-7585 was transported to Site-17 for containment and urgent medical treatment.  His fever has been responsive to non-anomalous antibiotics and recovery is anticipated, although there will likely be some permanent damage to his lung tissue. \n\n-----\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7585 (Ryan Greenfeld)\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Clarence Dwight\n> \n> **Foreword:** First formal interview regarding SCP-7585's anomalous abilities and details of his life prior to containment.  Interview occurred three months after initial containment, after the subject had recovered from his illness and biohazard procedures were relaxed.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Okay SCP-7585, today we want to ask you some questions, some of which we've discussed previously but this is for the official record.\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Go ahead, doc.\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** When did you first become aware of your anomalous nature?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Right, uh, I've been thinking about this and I think the first thing was when I was out hiking with some friends near █████ park, and we forgot to bring snacks right? But I just pulled some granola bars that weren't there out of my bag.  Like I was rooting around and I knew they weren't there but I wanted some anyway so I just kind of like... had them be there?\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** So you manifested them? How do you know you didn't put them there earlier and forget? I'm not doubting you, just curious.\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** There's like, this feeling, when I change things, like when you're dreaming but you're kind of lucid and something happens but you don't want it to happen that way so you just... change what happened?  It feels like pushing on something but only using my will.  I think.  That's the first time I remember having that feeling while I was awake.  I remember thinking like 'oh, this must be a dream then\" and I was waiting to wake up but it just kept going.\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** I see.  Could you go over the ways you consciously used these abilities for me again? For the record.\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Okay.  I did a lot of lazy stuff, manifested food instead of cooking, erased garbage I didn't wanna take out.  I tried to make shiny stuff, gems and gold and stuff, to show off to friends, but they ended up being fake.  They thought the food I could make was pretty good, though, I guess, I didn't...\n> \n> //SCP-7585 trails off and breaths heavily, looking distressed and crying slightly.//\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** It's okay, Ryan. It wasn't your fault.  You had no way of knowing what would happen.\n> \n> //SCP-7585 nods, wipes his eyes and nose with a tissue from his bedside table, and continues.//\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Yeah.  Uh.  I guess I deleted a couple people.  Mr. ██████ and ████.  I didn't, like, intend to, I just... really wanted them to go away.  I actually thought they //had// just moved away, like everyone else seemed to, till you told me about how they'd just stopped existing.  I don't think they deserved it but I guess they probably would have died anyway.  God.\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Thank you.  Could you explain the irregular architecture in your neighbourhood?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** After I made ████ disappear I got really sick for the first time, I guess cause I'd done too much.  I had a high fever, kind of like when you found me but it didn't last as long that time.  I was really delirious and don't remember super well but it was //probably// when I was half awake in bed watching this VHS of old Dr. Seuss cartoons dad put on for me?  I watched them all the time when I was a kid and apparently it calmed me down during the fever.\n> \n> Anyway uh, I apparently made the outsides of the houses nearby all Seussified.  Which I didn't even realize until like two weeks ago when you showed me the before and after pictures, I thought they'd just always been like that, same as everyone else.  Which, I guess makes me kinda understand why you're so scared of me, huh?\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** We're not scared of you, SCP-7585. We just want to make sure nobody else gets hurt.  Can you go over the events leading up to your containment one more time for me?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Maybe //you're// not scared of me. Okay, uh. Dad was the first one to get sick, I guess because he was taking care of me during the fever when I was doing stuff unconsciously.  Then ███, then mom.  Doctors thought it looked like radiation poisoning but no obvious cause.  I thought maybe I could, I, I...\n> \n> //SCP-7585 breaks down sobbing.  He tries several times to resume speaking but is unable to.//\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** It's okay.  //(Aside to camera)// Going to pause the interview here to give SCP-7585 some time.  Will resume shortly.\n> \n> //Video feed ends. Interview is suspended for 47 minutes, whereupon video feed resumes.  SCP-7585's face is flushed, but his expression is now calm.//\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Resuming interview.  SCP-7585, are you able to continue now?\n> \n> //SCP-7585 nods and begins speaking in a firm monotone.//\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** I tried to heal my sick family members.  At first it seemed to work, but the illness would come back within a day or so.  After a few times it did nothing or made things worse.  Then I got sick too, a fever again, probably from trying to fix them.\n> \n> At some point while I was delirious some hospital person told me dad had died, and my head wasn't working right and so I thought like 'that isn't real, I want to go home and be with my family' so I did.  I don't know how I got home actually, whether I teleported or made someone give me a ride or what.\n> \n> I remember being home with mom and dad and ███, we were going to have dinner together, but it wasn't really them it was just shitty meat puppets shaped like them I'd unconsciously made so they started falling apart in front of me. I thought it was a nightmare and went to my room to hide until I woke up.\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Thank you, Ryan, you've been very brave.  Do you know anything about the blue growths we found in your home?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** No. I mean I saw it but I thought I was hallucinating.  I mean, I //was// hallucinating, so I thought the blue stuff wasn't real either.\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Thank you. That's all for today.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-7585 has been consistently cooperative and understands the dangers of his anomaly better than anyone.  I'm going to recommend a reclassification to Euclid and gradual relaxation of containment measures as his health improves--so long as precautions against unintentional reality bending are in place, it should be safe for SCP-7585 to engage in supervised leisure activities on-site and interact with other low-risk humanoids.\n\n**Addendum-7585-2, Clinical Evaluation:** As of five months following initial containment, SCP-7585 remains bedridden and continues to require oxygen intubation. Intense antibiotic treatment followed by regular probiotic supplements have been effective at eliminating most of SCP-7585's anomalous microbiome and suppressing what remains. However, his hemocyte and leucocyte[[footnote]]red and white blood cell[[/footnote]] counts remain alarmingly low. The assigned clinical team has yet to determine a cause.\n\n**Addendum-7585-3, Diagnosis:** After a survey of available literature and careful reexamination of test outcomes, SCP-7585 has been diagnosed with a severe adverse reaction to the active field of a Scranton Reality Anchor. Experimental results have revealed a previously unknown effect in which the function of certain enzymes in the human body is impeded by an SRA field. This appears to affect all humans but is clinically insignificant except in those experiencing an adverse reaction, in which case blood cell production is negatively affected.  Several previously contained reality benders and a handful of Foundation personnel have been retroactively diagnosed with this condition based on records.\n\nBased on these results, it may be expedient to SCP-7585's health and well-being to reduce his exposure to active SRAs, perhaps in conjunction with increased doses of suppressant medication.\n\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"You have new messages!

Due to the hazards posed by proximity to testing, the subject was temporarily relocated to an isolated testing facility for this process.  Abridged details of first session are included here and selections from Dr. Dwight's notes have been attached for further context.\n\n> **Date:** June 3rd, 1998\n> **Practitioner:** Kendra Ash\n> **Patient:** SPC-7585 (Ryan Greenfeld)\n> \n> **Foreword:** Based on how SCP-7585 describes the use of his ontokinetic abilities, conditioning will focus on the idea of being unable to affect a dream-world during lucid dreaming.  Trigger words will be assigned.  Conditioning will be performed remotely from an observation post outside the range of SCP-7585's harmful effect.\n> \n> <BEGIN LOG>\n> \n> **Ash:** Breath slowly and follow my finger with your eyes. You are sinking into a dark, warm place.  You are floating in in warm water. There is no danger here.  Your mind is completely open and unprotected, and this is good.  Let yourself sink slowly, deeper and deeper.\n> \n> //Hypnotic induction continues for several minutes until SCP-7585 is able to enter a deep state of trance.//\n> \n> **Ash:** You are dreaming now, Ryan.  You are dreaming and everything around you is solid and real.  You know it is a dream, but you cannot change it.  This is a special kind of dream where you are safe.  This is a special kind of dream where everyone is safe.  You will know you are in this kind of dream by the these words: cloud triangle green.  Hold the shape of each word in your head so you know it.  A white puffy little cloud in the sky.  A perfect equilateral triangle, drawn on a paper.  Green, the colour of the leaves and grass after rain in the spring.  Cloud, triangle, green.  All three words, one after another, just like that.  When you hear those words, you will know that you cannot change the dream, and that it's better that way.  Whenever you feel uneasy, repeat those words to yourself. \n> \n> //Reenforcement continues in this vein for some time.//\n> \n> **Ash:** Now, slowly let yourself rise up, up out of the deep dark place toward the light.  Follow the sound of my voice, Ryan.  Soon you'll be awake again.  Being awake is just another kind of dream.  You can't change things in an awake dream, either.  You know that it's better to just let things happen.  Cloud, triangle, green.  The light is brighter.  You are safe and well-rested. When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and know that you are an ordinary young man.\n> \n> //Ash snaps her fingers.  SCP-7585 blinks several times and shakes his head.//\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Did, uh... did it work?\n> \n> **Ash:** Only one way to find out.  Repeat after me.  Cloud, triangle, green.\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Cloud, triangle, green.\n> \n> **Ash:** Feel anything?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Uh, I'm not sure.  That's the trigger, right? It feels nice to say.  Cloud, triangle, green.\n> \n> **Ash:** The anchors are off.  Try to manifest something small and you //won't// be able to do it.  Cloud, triangle, green.\n> \n> //SCP-7585 raises one hand and frowns, repeating the mantra to himself.  Something flickers in his hand.  He jerks back, clutching his forehead in pain as a few shredded bits of green paper fall on the bed.//\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** I think uh... I don't think it worked.  I still made something, it's just shittier than usual. I tried to make a triangle of green paper but it's just bits.  I bet I just forgot how to do stuff cause it's been so long.\n> \n> //SCP-7585 lays back in bed, looking dejected.//\n> \n> **Ash:** I think this is promising!  Dr. Dwight tells me they're turning the anchors back on now and Joey will be over with your antibiotics in a minute.  We'll figure this out together, Ryan, don't worry.\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Okay, whatever. Just... I hope it's soon.\n> \n> <END LOG>\n\n= **Excerpts from Notes on Project Hypnos by Dr. Clarence Dwight**\n\n**June 5th, 1998:** Early results are mixed. Disruption of Ryan's abilities has been relatively effective but the secondary harmful effect proves more stubborn. The nearby test cultures mutate considerably during his attempts at ontokinetics even when he fails to make any visible changes to reality.  We'll have to change our approach.\n\nRyan has been cooperative but his morale is extremely low.  Being dragged out here was a big uncomfortable disruption, he's got no access to games or videos and says he hasn't been able to focus on his writing.  In terms of health, the tests are hard on him.  His immune system is in terrible shape from RAARS[[footnote]]Reality Anchor Adverse Reaction Syndrome[[/footnote]] and each use of his abilities creates a fresh crop of anomalous bugs we have to flush out with antibiotics.  We need to finish out here and get him back to the site where we have proper medical facilities ASAP.  Wish we'd ignored the documents and started hypnotherapy before leaving Site-17, I'm not convinced having his abilities active during the sessions is that important.\n\n**June 12th, 1998:** Some progress.  The new therapy method is trying to convince Ryan he doesn't have powers, and we've been slowly introducing mild amnestics and other trance-inducing drugs.  It's almost completely shut down conscious use of his powers, but now if we turn off the anchors during his REM cycles we get big ontokinetic spikes.\n\nRyan's health has improved a little after a blood transfusion and he's settled into the routine out here.  He's a tough kid.  The official lie we're feeding him is that he's subconsciously using his powers to make himself sick and the anchors can't stop it so we need to use hypnotherapy, I think he buys it.  Wish I could tell him the truth.\n\n**June 20th, 1998:** I think we've done it. We had to use a lot of drugs and part of a dubious old Soviet brainwashing machine, but the numbers look real good: no ontokinetic activity, no cultures turning rotten during REM sleep, no sudden fevers after tests.  I want to just get this kid back to his bed in Site-17, but we're going to need more than \"numbers look real good\" to convince O5.\n\nRyan's pretty messed up from the drugs and repeated trances, but also he's been joking around with the nurses again for the first time in months. Says he's feeling cautiously optimistic.   We've been keeping the anchors off whenever possible. Probably not enough to cancel out the negative health effects of being dragged out to the middle of nowhere and pumped full of weird hypnotic drugs, but maybe it helps a little.\n\nAt the Director's insistence, we're also testing out activation keywords and embedded exceptions for things like protecting Foundation personnel.  Ryan's powers are too dangerous to be useful, but it's supposed to be a prototype for brainwashing other reality benders I guess.  I just hope it doesn't compromise the whole project.\n\n**June 25, 1998:** We've got all we're going to get out here, Ryan needs to get back to a proper care facility.  The numbers aren't as ironclad as I'd like, but it ought to be clear the threat is negligible.  I'll submit a report to Overwatch Command ASAP.  Cautiously optimistic.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-weight: bold; background:#fff url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:\n||~ YEA  ||~ ABSTAIN  ||~ NAY ||\n||  ||   ||   O5-01    ||\n||  ||   ||   O5-02   ||\n|| O5-03 ||   ||       ||\n||  ||  O5-04 ||       ||\n|| O5-05 ||   ||          ||\n||  ||   ||  O5-06    ||\n||  ||   ||    O5-07      ||\n||  || O5-08  ||          ||\n||  ||       ||    O5-09      ||\n||  ||       ||    O5-10      ||\n|| O5-11 ||   ||       ||\n||  || O5-12 ||      ||\n|| O5-13 ||   ||       ||\n@@ @@\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| ##red|DENIED## ||\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum 7585-5, Breach and Neutralization:**  On September 6th, 1998, an unexplained electrical issue caused a brown-out in most areas of Site-17.  The SRAs in SCP-7585's cell were deactivated for several minutes.  During this time, despite his poor health and prior conditioning, SCP-7585 breached his cell via ontokinetic teleportation and proceeded to cause a small-scale CK-class reality reconstruction event of uncertain effect.  Subject lost consciousness following this action and was easily recontained.\n\nThe secondary effects of SCP-7585's abilities caused minor illness in 54 Site-17 personnel and 3 biological anomalies, as well as moderate illness in 5 additional personnel.  No severe illness occurred among personnel, likely due to the very brief duration of the exposure.  Notably, Dr. Clarence Dwight suffered the greatest ill effects due to his proximity to the CK event.\n\nShortly after recontainment, SCP-7585 developed an extreme fever.  During a brief period of wakefulness, he repeatedly asked where Dr. Dwight was and if he could speak with him.  Dr. Dwight was permitted to contact him over the intercom in hopes of gathering information.  A brief transcript follows:\n\n> <LOG BEGINS>\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Ryan?  Ryan, it's Clarence, I'm here, what happened?  What did you do?\n> \n> **SCP-7585:** Doc!  Thank god, you're okay.  Thank god. (indiscernible).\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Ryan, hold on, okay?

Sleep now.\n> \n> //Dr. Dwight can be heard crying softly over the intercom.//\n> \n> **Dr. Dwight:** Okay.  We'll talk about this later.  Goodnight, Ryan.\n> \n> <LOG ENDS>\n\nSCP-7585's fever did not respond to antibiotic intervention. Less than an hour later, he expired from toxic shock and was reclassified as neutralized.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Level 5 Clearance Required.  Enter Credentials?\" hide=\"Welcome, O5-13.\"]]\n\n**Addendum 7585-6, CK-Class Event Reconstruction:** The following is relevant footage recovered from a security camera near SCP-7585's chamber.  Camera was on the edge of the effective range of a high-priority SRA (which had its own backup power source) and footage was therefore shielded from the CK event.\n\n> <RELEVANT FOOTAGE BEGINS>\n> 12:01: Dr. Dwight passes down the hallway on his way to SCP-7585's containment chamber.\n> 12:04: Containment breach alarms activate. (No containment breach was recorded in Site-17 on this date.)\n> 12:05: An emergency announcement states that a containment breach of SCP-████ is expected to cause side-wide brownouts. (No anomaly of this designation is or has been contained at Site-17.)\n> 12:06: Brownout occurs at the same instant as in the post-CK event timeline.\n> 12:09: An unidentified semi-humanoid anomaly with orange flames radiating from its body proceeds down the hallway at high speed.  A howling noise is heard as it passes the camera.\n> 12:13: The sound of explosions and rumbling is heard from off camera, accompanied by screaming.\n> 12:14: Dr. Dwight runs partway down the hallway and collapses.  He is severely burnt and bleeding from an injury to his left arm.  The unidentified anomaly crosses the hallway again.  Orange light visible on camera indicates it has stopped just out of the camera's field of view. Sounds of gunfire, howling and further explosions are heard. Dr. Dwight does not appear to be breathing.\n> 12:15: SCP-7585 manifests near at the edge of the camera's field of view, facing the orange light.  He looks briefly at Dr. Dwight before raising his arms and vocalizing loudly.  After several seconds, the orange light and Dr. Dwight's body disappear.  SCP-7585 collapses.\n> 12:16: Brownout ends.\n> <RELEVANT FOOTAGE ENDS>\n\n**Notes:** The designation SCP-████ is unused, while most designations in a similar range are in use. Furthermore, a particular high security containment block in Site-17 was noted as being vacant for an unusual period of time prior to the CK event, even during periods when that space should have been in high demand.  It can be concluded that an entity designated SCP-████ previously existed and was removed from consensus reality, thereby retroactively preventing a containment breach which would have otherwise wounded or killed numerous Foundation personnel.\n\nThis action would not have been prevented by SCP-7585's hypnotic programming due to built-in exceptions for protecting the Foundation's personnel and interests during a crisis.  This would suggest that, contrary to initial assessment, the conditioning procedure may be effective. Further research recommended. \n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7585]]] | SCP-7585 | [[[SCP-7585]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
