Personnel with a level 2 clearance or higher may request access to its components for the purpose of testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-079 is a Sorcerer-brand microcomputer built in 1978 by the Exidy gaming company. Its owner, Michael Kosniak, purchased and modified SCP-079 in 1981 to house a primitive version of a Type-1 AI. Kosniak's intention was for it to continuously improve and evolve over time.\n\nCurrently SCP-079 possesses a vastly limited memory span, only being able to recall the last 24 hours. SCP-079 also possesses a limited secondary memory card, capable of permanently remembering beings or things considered particularly important by SCP-079.\n\n> **Addendum-2082/04/12:**\n> ~~~~\n> //SCP-079 holds an almost fabled place in the Foundation's history. Like SCP-682 and SCP-076-2 before it, 79 is a reminder of the Foundation's earlier days, of an organization of men and women standing in darkness to protect those living in the light.//\n> ~~~~\n> //But the world has changed. Our organization, once a few dozen sites spread haphazardly across five continents has changed into an organization that reaches across this solar system. We have a thousand sites across six planets, thousands more anomalies counted and contained, and half a billion humans, [[[SCP-1000|Yeren]]], and various extraterrestrial species in our employment.//\n> ~~~~\n> //Once upon a time, SCP-079 was seen as a legitimate threat to the continued normalcy and well-being of humanity. Today, its programming is outmatched by the one in my coffee machine. No further value can be gained from continuing its containment.//\n> ~~~~\n> //SCP-079 is available upon request to those wishing to examine it for scientific research, and for those who would wish to gaze upon our organization's humble beginnings.//\n> ~~~~\n> //Sincerely,//\n> ~~~~\n> //- O5-18.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** exidy\n> **Name:** Exidy Sorcerer.jpg\n> **Author:** Marcin Wichary\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Exidy_Sorcerer.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
