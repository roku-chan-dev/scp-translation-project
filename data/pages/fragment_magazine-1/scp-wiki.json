It was a bit of a personal one for me, as it's actually based on a true story!\n\nAs a child, I used to go to the Perth Zoo every weekend with my parents. I would always have so much fun seeing the tigers, the monkeys, even the bears! But most of all, I felt a special connection with the elephants.\n\nMy great grandpa Walt was one of the best elephant hunters in the world, with a kill count of over one //thousand// elephants throughout his career. He always used to regale us with his tales of the hunt, stalking the noble elephant for hours on end until he could line them up for the perfect shot.\n\nLike any good hunter, my great grand-pappy had a huge amount of respect for his prey. He would always ensure he got the maximum amount of ivory possible from each elephant, never leaving a single tusk unturned. He always used to show us his ivory pipes and statuettes, and tell us about the elephants they came from, so my family and I would forever have love for elephants in our hearts, come what may.\n\nUnfortunately, in the 1980s the ivory trade was made illegal, and my poor great grand-pappy died soon after of a broken heart. \n\nHe always used to tell me \"Son, the only thing that an elephant can't beat in a fight, is a lawyer.\" and I took this to heart, vowing to respect the rule of law for the rest of my days, lest I disrespect poor great-grandpappy.\n\nIn 2022, Tricia, one of the oldest Asian elephants in the world, died at the age of 65, and the Perth Zoo will never again house another elephant.\n\nI swear that day I could feel her presence in my great-grand pappy's ivory pipe, telling me I must tell her story.\n\nUnfortunately, the previous occupant of this body had only darkness in her soul, and she tried to sell the ivory through the internet, which is illegal!\n\nImmediately, her heart stopped and her soul went to hell for one billion years, never to return... \n\nPlease take this lesson to heart, and never break a single law, or you might die!\n\nThank you, and God Bless America. ✌️\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
