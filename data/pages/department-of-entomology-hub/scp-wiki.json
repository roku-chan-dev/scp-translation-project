Despite being almost unheard of by the overseer council, the bottom of all the jokes by the other departments and being constantly underfunded, we are an important department here. You might be thinking: //Insects? How can they be important?// And you would be right, but this place is full of people working for a single unified goal: to make the world a better place. No matter how small someone is, they can make a difference, even by containing some small insects. That's one less anomaly that could have destroyed the veil.\n\nWe are just ordinary people, doing ordinary things in an extraordinary world.\n\nWelcome aboard, I hope you'll enjoy your stay.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n**RED = SCP \nBLUE = TALE/OTHER**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blueblock\"]]\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/entomology-intro-tale \"Sorry to bug you, Director...\"] By: [[*user Radiantgold]] //(Written for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-contest Department-Con 2022])//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"redblock\"]]\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6570 SCP-6570] - Service Bugs By:[[*user REDESERT]] //(Written for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/department-contest Department-Con 2022])//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"redblock\"]]\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6220 SCP-6220] - We most certainly had toâ€¦ //Bug// you.

It primarily deals with insectoid anomalies and how to contain, research and potentially use them to their benefit. Their articles tend to be smaller in scale and more slice of life, with a undertone of chaos, however you can take on darker concepts as seen in SCP-6220. Generally, the department does not contain larger threats, but if you do write about them facing these threats, make sure they are overwhelmed and only win by some sort of miracle.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Site-95]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Site-95.png|width=20%|align=right|caption= Site insignia.]]\n\n After being taken from a wealthy family on account of practicing demonic rituals, Site-95 was originally established as a small testing facility. After SCP-6220 arrived on site, the site became a containment and research site for biological entities. Along with this change, the Entomology, Mycology and Botany departments were formed.\n\nToday, Site-95 is known as the headquarters of the Entomology department as well as a major hub for the Mycology and Botany departments. Site-95 is usually known for its relaxed yet chaotic attitude and difficult exams for entrance. The site is one of the most densely populated facilities within the Foundation earning it a large reputation. Despite this, the site still has controversies due to it being one of the last sites to still contain D-class.\n\nArguably, the site's main attraction is the large site garden. It is commonly used to experiment and contain anomalies and when not in use, it is often used by members for relaxation purposes. The Botany Department solely manages and is responsible for the upkeep of the garden, gaining them a sense of admiration from their peers.\n\nSite-95 is often laughed at from the wider Foundation, despite this it is rapidly growing and boasts a large amount of intellectuals and academics.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Characters]]\n\n[[div class=\"table2\"]]\n[[div class=\"tableb\"]]\n||~  Director Anne Tina ||~  North American Regional Director  ||\n||||Smart and hardworking, sometimes esoteric acting. Fully determined to gain the position of Entomology director. She's often very busy managing the department but behind the scenes is very human and sweet. ||\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"table1\"]]\n[[div class=\"tableb\"]]\n||~  Director Keiten ||~  Oceanian Regional Director  ||\n||||Also known as SCP-6220-C, he is contractually obligated to manage 6220-A and -B. Essentially a Slave to them. Clumsy and not the sharpest tool in the box. Became not deemed eligible for the department head, due to a possible conflict of interest. ||\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table3\"]]\n[[div class=\"tableb\"]]\n||~  Director Oliver Clement ||~  Site-95 Director ||\n||||While technically not being part of the Department of Entomology, he still plays an important role in managing the department. Took up the role of director after Director Corey stepped down. Very odd, but casual after a breach caused the site to arm up. He is at the center of the site, making sure another incident like that does not happen. ||\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table4\"]]\n[[div class=\"tableb\"]]\n||~  Director Corey||~  Director of Containment ||\n||||Former Site-95 director, is believed to be 90 years old. Passed the role of director to Director Oliver Clement due to a combination of personnel factors and stress. Despite this, he is one of the most famous members of the site and has a large reputation.||\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[div class=\"tableb\"]]\n||~  Alan Phid||~  Junior Researcher||\n||||Newbie to the department of Entomology, still figuring things out. Curious but confused person, has a bright future. Generally nice and pleasing.||\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**African Regional Director: Dr. Arlo Pod:** N/A\n**European Regional Director: Dr. Elly Tiragh** N/A\n**Asian Regional Director: Dr. Thor Ax**  N/A\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Writing Guide]]\n\nYou want to write for the Department of Entomology? Congrats, great! There are a few things to be aware of though:\n\nThe Department of Entomology is a loose canon, there are no plans for a full canon. It can fit into most other canons and is flexible, you are however encouraged to use characters, anomalies and lore if you so desire.\n\nI know this is applicable for most other departments and canons, but before you write anything, //read, read, read// the already existing stories. These will help you get an idea on the themes and ideas here. I would recommend reading [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/entomology-intro-tale \"Sorry to bug you, Director...\"] first and then looking at the other articles.\n\nYou may additionally use the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:bedbugs-theme Bedbugs theme] on your article but it's by no means necessary.\n\nHere are some themes and tones to consider:\n\n**Slice of Life:** How is it like working at the Foundation? What are the relationships between all the staff? How do they interact with the anomalies? These are all good questions that you could answer.\n\n**Forgotten:** The Department of Entomology is usually forgotten due to its size. They are often underfunded due to this and their resources are limited. How does the department react to this? \n\n**Comedy:** Some articles such as SCP-7386 aim at comedy. Comedy is greatly welcomed here, due to the uniqueness of the department. Don't be afraid to try make a funny article.\n\n**Heartwarming:** Consider the anomalies, a lot of them are harmless and free. The workers are regularly encouraged to play with non-dangerous anomalies. Sometimes, your stories don't have to be big or grand.\n\n**Other departments:** The Mycology and Botany departments are also there at Site-95, they have a sort of friendly rivalry. Consider the other departments and how they would react to what the Entomology department does. You could even have a partnership between all 3 departments to contain one singular anomaly.\n\n**Odd:** Most of the people here are odd, maybe even more so the anomalies they are working with. Really lean into the whole odd aspect of it, there's a reason why their motto is \"Odd is to be expected.\"\n\nLastly, you're always free to contact [[*user Spacestealth]] if you have any questions or simply have a draft that you want me to see.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n=====\n> **Filename:** ento%20logo%20test.png\n> **Author:** [[*user REDESERT]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Adepartment-of-entomology/ento%20logo%20test.png\n=====\n\n=====\n> **Filename:** Site-95.png?\n> **Author:** [[*user Jerden]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916930272396738580/1173202212076400723/Site-95.png?ex=656318b4&is=6550a3b4&hm=f148cce2b6189361bd39061281e266ede3987c14532f33c3189f1aa247e18a4e&\n=====\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[/div]]",
