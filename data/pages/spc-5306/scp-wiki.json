SPC-5306 instances will also be able to recover vital information for the Centre, such as selachian movement patterns and hunting formations.\n\n**Project Component(s):** SPC-5306 instances are 7-Nu class selachian entities modified with standard human-to-selachian pugilism implements. The project uses previously punched selachian entities, with the punch receivers removed, and combines them with human pugilism and neural units. Once the SPC-5306 instances are prepared, they must undergo specialized pugnātorial training to blend in with the selachian forces.\n\n**Augmentation Summary:** The SPC-5306 project was proposed by Robert Gair, notable Centre inventor, who had made many previous SPC projects. Bellow are a series of cmail exchanges that lead up to the creation of SPC-5306.\n\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** shark_h8erBoss@spcmail.com\n**From:** 96punchman240@spcmail.com\n**Subject:** ProjectPHBISAGTBA\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nHello Director Pugna, this is Robert (again). I've prepared a new project proposal for the creation of selachian spies capable of covert punching operations. The current codename is Putting Human Brains In Sharks And Giving Them Buff Arms, or PHBISAGTBA. I believe that this SPC item will be able to turn the tides of the the fight against the selachian threat. All we need are a few human volunteers and 6.8 million dollars.\n\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-5306 Download File (29 MB)]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** 96punchman240@spcmail.com\n**From:** shark_h8erBoss@spcmail.com\n**Subject:** Re:ProjectPHBISAGTBA\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nRobert, I'm not sure about this one. I see your intention, but based on the description you gave, it seems like this might be setting up for a repeat of your Operation: WaterBear. I think you should take a step back, and plan this out more carefully.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** shark_h8erBoss@spcmail.com\n**From:** 96punchman240@spcmail.com\n**Subject:** Re:Re:ProjectPHBISAGTBA\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nI went over the plan again, and I think I've devised an effective way to achieve our goals.
