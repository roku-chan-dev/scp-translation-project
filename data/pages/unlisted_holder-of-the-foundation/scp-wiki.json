Should you mistype, or should he leave the channel upon your response, pray for your end to be quick, for there's nothing that will save you.\n\nYou will then be invited to another channel, whose name I know not, for its listed name is pure black. In there, a parade of trolls most vile shall fill your screen with revolting imagery and enraging ignorance. Do not reply, and do not become angry, for if you do, they will devour your soul.\n\nInstead, when one of them shall post a link to /x/, reply with \"That is where it all began, and where it shall end.\" The channel owner will step in with a masskick.\n\nRejoin the channel immediately. A single man, his whois address set to localhost, will await you there. He will react to the sole phrase, \"Choke on a goat dick.\" At that moment, the server will grant him a +o, and he'll begin telling tales of every bad SCP submitted, discussion clusterfuck, asinine wiki application. Should you retain your sanity, he will ask for your deepest desire. Reply with [DATA EXPUNGED]. You will disconnect from the server, and your chat history will be gone as if nothing happened, but on the surface nearest to your right hand shall lie a cartridge titled \"Sisters of Cheyenne Point.\"\n\n[[module CountPages tags=\"scp\"]]\nThe cartridge is object 069 of %%total%%, and it is worth the twenty hours of net playtime.\n[[/module]]\n--]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
