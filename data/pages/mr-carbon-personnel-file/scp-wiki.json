  "content": "[[div style=\"display: none;\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:flopstyle]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMr Carbon is someone who occasionally writes things on this collaborative fiction wiki.\n\nIn particular, I write a version of the Foundation which, on average, goes //right// up to the limit of \"cold, not cruel\" while leaving room for some error on either side of that line. I also like to write about what I call my pet Mobile Task Force, [[[MTF Theta-90 Hub Page|MTF Theta-90 (\"Angle Grinders\").]]]\n\n**I'm on hiatus (again...) effective May 2023. Probably not for four years this time, though!**\n\n----\n**Mr Carbon's SCP entries:**\n\n[[[SCP-814]]] - \"Pure Tones\" (repost-rewrite, see article comments for details)\n[[[SCP-1496]]] - \"A Place Setting\"\n[[[SCP-1707]]] - \"New Skin\"\n[[[SCP-7090]]] - \"The Girl With The Sun In Her Head\"\n----\n**Tales, essays and other writing:**\n\n**[[[MTF Theta-90 Hub Page]]]**, incorporating:\n[[[mtf-theta-90-character-profiles|Character Roster for our POV crew, Tactical Team 10]]]\n\n[[[Sunday, 0600, Mobile Task Force Central Training Facility | Mobile Task Force Basic School: Induction Remarks]]]\n\n(Chapter 1)\n[[[Wednesday, 3pm, The Office of Paul Dimaccio]]]\n[[[Monday, 6am, Escherville Facility Two]]]\n[[[Friday, 2200, Paul Dimaccios Personal Quarters | Friday, 2200, Paul Dimaccio's Personal Quarters]]]\n[[[Running Out]]]\n\n(Chapter 2)\n[[[Four Years Later]]]\n[[[mtf-theta-90-turning-points|Turning Points]]]\n\n(No chapter, but...)\n//[[[Tuesday, 11am, Conference Room Three]]] - a not-quite-fully-in-canon tale that introduced a couple of the characters from Mobile Task Force Theta-90.//\n\n//[[[the-character-assassination-of-site-666-by-theta-90-a-poem|The Character Assassination Of Site-666 By The Cowards MTF Theta-90]]] - a very absurd and definitely not in-canon poem that was my Halloweencon 2022 entry. (Update: Placed 11th out of 36, pretty good for the only poem!)//\n----\n\nAnd aside from Theta-90, we also have...\n\n[[[Ricky Vasquez]]] -- the first in a likely series of articles about MTF Rho-V (\"Ricky Vasquez\"), who deal with nomenclative anomalies.\n----\n**I wrote two pieces for Gift Exchange 2022, which can be found on the wiki here:**\n\n[[[The Ballad of Soup Dog]]] - a silly poem-song about a silly and fantastic [[[scp-6802|SCP entry, Soup Dog]]]\n\n[[[GOLIATH Activation 000078]]] - a tale in the form of a robot (suit?) operation log, based on the microfiction found in the tabs on [[[toadking07-author-page|Toadking07's author page]]]\n\n----\n\n**And now I finally have audio up on the Wiki! ... so it can live here til I get a proper music page set up...**\n\nThis is //Scintillating Hate//, some theme music I produced for the demon Ansiel from the excellent [[[Sol Invictus]]]. You can also find the track  embedded in the relevant pages of the tale.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:audio-player-woed-source\n|unique-name=ansielstheme\n|audio-file=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sol-invictus/Scintillating_Hate_-_Ansiels_Theme_by_Mr_Carbon.mp3\n|background-color=rgb(240, 240, 250)\n|border-color=rgb(12, 12, 12)\n|border-radius=0rem\n|dropshadow-color=rgba(12, 12, 12, 0)\n|text-color=rgb(12, 12, 12)\n|icons-color=rgb(132, 32, 132)\n|player-color=rgb(10, 0, 10)\n|progress-color=rgb(200, 0, 200)\n]]\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
