The effect is not total -- a comprehensive karmic failure would in quick succession terminate consensus normalcy, the SCP Foundation and the human race -- but instead piecemeal. Each factor is randomized to a different extent, for a different length of time, and often with a different geographical radius of effect, corresponding to no obvious logical pattern. Nevertheless, the cumulative impact of many nonsensical and high-profile outcomes to formerly predictable actions is degrading the Veil of Secrecy at an alarming rate and jeopardizing containment efforts worldwide.\n\nThe cause of this disruption is, at present, unknown.\n\nSCP-7000-1 is Dr. William Wallace Wettle, a white male 54 years of age presently serving as Deputy Chair of Replication Studies at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 | Site-43]]].

Computers can only generate pseudorandom values due to the inherent predictability of programming code; RANDOM.ORG circumvents this by converting natural atmospheric radio noise, achieving true randomness. I/O LORENZ issues daily requests for ten random numbers between one and ten, one and one hundred, and one and one thousand as an early warning signal for probability collapse. The results for 6 July 2022 had been as follows:\n\n> 9, 2, 6, 8, 10, 4, 7, 7, 5, 10\n> 83, 66, 32, 58, 34, 29, 91, 8, 56, 54\n> 37, 190, 581, 848, 63, 767, 166, 668, 564, 932\n\nThe results for the following day were as follows:\n\n> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n> 1, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100\n> 1, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000\n\nMeteorological investigation revealed that all atmospheric noise, regardless of weather conditions, now produces non-random numbers in discernable sequence. I/O LORENZ immediately activated a brute-force redirect from RANDOM.ORG's number generator to itself, and began generating pseudorandom numbers for public consumption until the anomaly could be identified and contained. The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority and the Analytics Department were informed, and the latter quickly generated the following list of statistically-unlikely events occurring on the same date testifying to a rapid and widespread ontokinetic event.\n\n[[div class=\"ad_memo\"]]\n**Item:** Infiltrator belonging to GoI-003 (the 'Chaos Insurgency') captured whilst engaged in a series of cryptic acts at Area-150. Infiltrator possessed a partial 'Step Compilation', an operational overview prepared by the Insurgency's chief operative (the 'Engineer') from data provided by an enigmatic stochastic prediction device (the 'Engine'). Step 22/617 suggested travel between two structures via a tarmac path; infiltrator interrupted by the sudden onset of a violent storm, and knocked unconscious by a large hailstone.\n\n**Reactive Action:** Subject detained, interrogation underway. As the Engine's master plan and ultimate goal are never made clear to any individual insurgent, it remains possible that this was the desired outcome.\n----\n**Item:** Sudden and wholesale collapse of all extant cryptocurrency markets.\n\n**Reactive Action:** None taken; event fully consistent with long-term probability models.\n----\n**Item:** [[[SCP-179]]] expressing obvious confusion, identifying threats in eight directions corresponding to the cardinal compass points -- though the relationship is purely visual, as SCP-179 is located not on Earth but in close proximity to the heliosphere.\n\n**Reactive Action:** Due to the prohibitive expense of replacing solar probes after mishap, no attempt made to communicate directly with SCP-179 until stable probability restored. Area-08-C monitoring remotely.\n----\n**Item:** Repeated eruption of the 'Old Faithful' cone geyser in Yellowstone National Park, every thirteen minutes -- deviating from a bimodal pattern of approximately 65 or 91 minutes followed since at least 1870. \n\n**Reactive Action:** Evacuation of the area and implementation of a scientific cordon to disguise parascientific investigation.\n\n----\n\n**Item:** Uncorrelated yield curve shifts of multiple low-yield investments by anomalous insurer [[[SCP-6987 | Goldbaker-Reinz Insurance Group Ltd.]]], adjusted book value now in the hundreds of millions of dollars USD.\n\n**Reactive Action:** Goldbaker-Reinz representatives respond to all inquiries with the following: \"We would be pleased to discuss these unforeseen (by you) developments in person, should you wish to trigger an early review of your policies at this time.\" No action taken; investments crash the following day, erasing all gains made.

The O5 Council granted ETTRA amnesty powers over staff with undeclared anomalous conditions, to encourage self-identification; unaccounted-for ontokinetic or thaumaturgical factors could theoretically complicate scenario mitigation efforts.\n\nMultiple staff members at Site-43 came forward for anomalous classification over the following week.

I'm a negative probability sink.\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** Does it affect other people?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I think it can. I make my staff run through a few periodic exercises to reset their luck, which seems to protect them from the backwash. I was going to write a paper about it. I thought I'd have to write from a containment cell.\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:**  Yeah, about that. Why are you sharing this now? You could've kept it secret indefinitely.

When I had to get a second job because he'd accidentally showed up to the wrong office for two weeks, said he'd never noticed, said nobody even //told him,// and he got fired? I let it slide. But the crash...\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** Crash?\n\n**Villar:** It's not his fault. The //crash// was not his fault. I was driving mad -- mad at him, of course, it was always mad at him, at his stupid puppydog-shat-on-the-rug face and oh-so-believable bullshit about how he didn't //mean// to cut the bottoms off my best jeans with our weed trimmer, it just //happened//, and then our //house//... what was I...\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** The crash.\n\n**Villar:** Yeah. The crash. I was furious with him over... some shit, can't even remember, and I saw red -- except not where there actually //was// red. T-boned a minivan, at speed. Lost my license, lost my car, nearly lost my job... and I lost my husband, too. The day after I got out of the hospital, he just fucking //left.//\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** Jeez.\n\n**Villar:** Can you imagine? Blaming somebody for getting hurt. Couldn't handle the least amount of responsibility. I was better off without him, still am, but it sure as hell didn't feel that way at the time. Healthcare might be free in Canada, but down here it can cost you your whole life.\n\n**Dr. Sokolsky:** I understand. Rest assured, we'll be taking all of this into careful consideration in our hiring decisions.\n\n**Villar:** Good.

The probabilistic breakdown continued to progress, with effects felt most keenly by the paranormal community.\n\n[[div class=\"ad_memo\"]]\n**Item:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-s-c-plastics-hub | Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin]]] in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nexus-series | Nx-18]]] ceases to operate according to the rules of narrative logic.

We've got butterflies causing super typhoons in the South China Sea -- and we've got the asshole who decided that would be a fun experiment in irons at Area-06. We've got black cats, mirrors and ladders changing the arcs of people's lives out there. We've had to task two .aics with sniping eBay auctions, because... I don't know if you know this, everybody always labels everything 'rare' on eBay but suddenly everything //is// rare, unless it //should// be. There were fifteen auctions for pieces of toast with Jesus' face burned into them when I got up this morning, and only three of them were faked. Procurement and Liquidation reports that EVERY agent who goes to a garage sale now comes home with a handful of anomalies. Half the kittens in the world are being born polydactyl -- six or more toes on each foot -- and we're going to have to brainwash the entire scientific establishment into believing some bogus argument about atmospheric factors to explain it away. That, or put a //lot// of cats back into the bag, and the bag into one hell of a deep dark river.\n\n**O5-7:** Quite the preamble. Was it worth wasting precious time you could've spent pressing us to a solution?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Yes. Absolutely. Because here's the thing about that preamble: not everything I've just told you about is strictly probabilistic. Polydactyly is a heritable mutation. Rare items for sale -- not talking about the Jesus bread here -- have nothing to do with random chance. Probability doesn't make valuable objects, man-made valuable objects, start existing where they didn't exist before. And hen's teeth? That just doesn't happen at all, outside of the lab.\n\n**O5-7:** You didn't even mention hen's teeth.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** I haven't mentioned about five hundred other things, either.\n\n**O5-1:** But what you're saying is, this isn't actually a probability crisis.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** No, it definitely is that. It just isn't //entirely// that. Everyone who ate that potentially deadly blowfish yesterday lived; everybody who ate it today, died. Dice come up snake eyes today, after twenty-four hours of natural sixes or twenties or whatever the max is. So many people are catching shiny Pokémon -- I could explain what that is, thanks to my staff, but you don't and shouldn't care -- that we've had to knock out Nintendo's online services, every fansite, and a few Reddit communities to avoid the word getting 'round. We've had to slot agents into every extant gaming commission to manipulate their numbers, or where possible just close the casinos entirely on the pretext that it's too dangerous to operate them during COVID.\n\n**O5-12:** Which it is.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Which it is, so that's lucky... meaning the disease will probably dry up tomorrow, and we'll need to find a new excuse! And it didn't even take in Vegas, so we had to go wackier still. [[[SCP-4661 |Site-666]]] brokered a deal with the Undervegas demons to run fixed games on the Strip, to hide the fact that honest gambling -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- straight up doesn't work anymore. They were, I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear, thrilled to help. But that's just a Band-Aid solution, and since you're going to absolutely //hate// my short-but-a-little-longer-term fix, I need to make it perfectly clear that we're dealing with an extremely complex constellation of strictly probabilistic //and// superstitious luck effects which we're calling one anomaly for lack of a better explanation.\n\n**O5-1:** Alright, well, rip the Band-Aid off then. What's your terrible solution?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Every probabilistic anomaly in the SCP database is either dead as a doornail, or operating wildly outside of established parameters, as of right now. Every single one. That won't be the case when, with your permission, I update the SCP-7000 file to include Dr. William Wettle.\n\n**O5-10:** Who's Dr. William... Wettle? Did you say //Wettle?// That's a real name?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** He's a low-life lifer at Site-43, you've got very little reason to know who he is. But at this time, he's potentially the most important employee we have. He just self-identified as a serial loser, and experimental data backs it up. This guy literally cannot ever catch a break, which is sad, but what //isn't// sad is this: he's the only probabilistic anomaly still ticking over.\n\n**O5-1:** You're certain?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Absolutely.\n\n**O5-1:** Do you know why?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Absolutely not. We haven't had the time to study him; all we have is his data to go on, and a hunch from my deputy, but! That data is extensive, Wet Willie lacks the imagination to lie, and my deputy knows his shit. As of this moment, Dr. William Wettle is the only reliable probability factor on the planet Earth.\n\n**O5-4:** Good lord. And what can that do for us?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** On the face of it, not much. If he had //good// luck, well, obviously we could use that. But bad luck? We could let him get corrupted by some GoI or other, have him fuck them up with his good intentions, but that's a very limited utility in a very wide problem field. \n\n**O5-5:** Yes, let's not do that.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** If the guy is just plain unlucky, him, personally, it's nothing better than a baseline for predictable probability.\n\n**O5-13:** Obviously you think it might be something more.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** I do indeed. There are two theories; Wettle's own, and Dr. Sokolsky's. Here's what Wettle thinks: bad luck clings to him like an ontokinetic cloud. The universe will take any opportunity to get a cheap shot in on him. And if he gets an overload, it can bleed into his surroundings and cause chaos. This mostly fits with the observed facts.\n\n**O5-9:** Dr. Sokolsky's hunch goes deeper, I presume.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** A lot deeper. Based on his initial interviews with Wettle's colleagues, he had the Analytics Department compare negative probability events from every facility since 7k started. Here's what they discovered: Site-43 is the luckiest place on Earth right now. They're still seeing random luck effects, but only good ones. So Sokolsky had them pull the older data, and while they're still going over everything, it looks like a general trend. Allowing for the occasional unavoidable cataclysm, Site-43 has //always// been one of the luckiest places on Earth. And I think that's because of Dr. Wettle.\n\n**O5-1:** You don't think his bad luck wears off. You think everyone else's wears off on //him.//\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Precisely. And unavoidable, unpredictable bad luck is presently our biggest issue in dealing with the effects of 7000. We rush in to fix one problem, and encounter three more on the way. I want to use Dr. Wettle as a stabilizing agent for our spot treatments. Put together a Mobile Task Force, append him to it, and let them swoop in to save the day wherever necessary. Call it MTF Something-7000, \"The Magnificent Seven\" or whatever. \n\n**O5-7:** Not that. \n\n**O5-4:** No, definitely not that. Half of the Magnificent Seven die.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** I'm just spitballing, Logistics can come up with something better. We'll use them for all high-value deployments where possible, to ensure success -- six expert super-soldiers and one walking time-bomb. Let him wander around soaking up the bad karma, while our folks in the forces get the job done regardless of probabilistic bullshit. I call it OPERATION: BLACK SWAN.\n\n**O5-7:** It's nice to know you had the time to name all these things, what with the world falling apart around us.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Not giving them names would be unlucky, sir, and I'm operating on the assumption that at some point fortune will smile on us again. I have a theory about that, too, but I'd rather it not go on the record at present -- don't wanna jinx myself, since, well, you know.\n\n**O5-1:** I'll allow it. What's your theory?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** [REDACTED]\n\n**O5-3:** You can't be serious.\n\n**O5-1:** [sighing] Of course he can't. Ask him what that slide he's been pointing at the entire time is.\n\n**O5-10:** I'd assumed it was some sort of chaos theory... heat map projection.\n\n**O5-4:** //I'd// assumed he was going to explain it eventually.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Did I not? Sorry, it's my breakfast.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Egg.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. Dan's breakfast for 16 July 2022.|\n    align=center|    \n    width=700px|\n]]\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Every egg in my house has two yolks now.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Dan:** The point is, this is going to affect every aspect of our lives before long.

I was... remembering something. Yes. Go on.\n\n**Simon Wettle:** Like Min said, he never spared a thought for himself. Spent all his time fussing over what could go wrong with other people, what he could do about it.\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** What he //had// to do about it. He couldn't live with himself if something happened, and he'd passed up the chance to help.\n\n**Simon Wettle:** I think it started in his twenties. My brother died in '75, and--\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** No, Simon, it wasn't that. It started much, much earlier. When I was sick.\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** Sick?\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** Lung cancer. They didn't expect me to make it. Willie was only twelve at the time.\n\n**Simon Wettle:** You're right. That's when it started.

If you're interested...\n\n**Simon Wettle:** You mean mnestics?\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** How did you...?\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** We've taken them before, back in... god, it was ages ago. They were checking up on William after some accident at work, asking if it could've been his fault, if he was //reliable.// They wanted to know everything about him.\n\n**Simon Wettle:** I think about those mnestics a lot -- when I can remember it. There's irony for you. Imagine how much good they could do in a place like this.\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** One of our friends doesn't remember her own children. She remembers me, because we go back farther than that. I tried to tell her about the mnestics once, but... I can't. The words won't come.\n\n**Simon Wettle:** Something to do with where you work? Where William works?\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** Yes. I'm sorry about that, and I'm sorry I can't tell you more, but... it's not my secret to reveal, and Dr. Wettle wouldn't want to put you in any danger. In fact... I think this is all about that need to protect people you were talking about. He's trying to protect //everyone,// and I don't think he even really knows what from.

The latter disregarded the former's entreaties, and at any event was rarely present due to repeated deployments with Theta-7000.\n\nOn 26 August, after his sixty-eighth operation with Theta-7000, Dr. Wettle abandoned his post. He was recovered almost immediately by MTF Pi-43 (\"Garbage In, Garbage Out\"), having failed to either disable the tracking devices installed on his personal telephone or turn the device off entirely. He had recorded the following video during his brief period AWOL.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<The camera view is zoomed in close to Dr. Wettle's face.

But I can't keep tripping on my dick so the universe can laugh; this can't be the rest of my life.\n\n//<Dr. Wettle drops the device. It takes two attempts for him to pick it back up.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** It's not like I liked the way my life was going before. This is just more of the same... a lot more of the same. The replication study straight out of hell. You know, when I joined up back in '98, the Director told me something like \"our world is filled with hidden terrors, strange...\" Okay, my memory is crap, and I wasn't really listening, but it was something like \"stranger stuff than you could possibly imagine.\" He wanted me to know what I was getting into. I told him it didn't matter, that the shit I'd seen was already strange in a real bad way, and I was looking forward to seeing the scary stuff. And you know what happened?\n\n//<Dr. Wettle shakes his head. His glasses fall off; he retrieves them.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I found out that scary stuff isn't always different from stupid stuff. And I guess that makes sense; the scary stuff comes out of our fears, our every-day bullshit, and a little bit of everything in the world is already stupid. Why would the scary stuff be any different? I just didn't expect that all the weirdness I'd be seeing would be so... \n\n//<Dr. Wettle sighs.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** So fucking //dumb.// Everybody thinks it's funny, what happens to me. It's not funny. And I guess I thought it would end, when I joined up. I thought I could replace my bullshit with yours. But it just... all ended up in the same pot. And now the pot's filling up, and it's coming over the edge, and I'm too old to learn how to mop. I don't know where this metaphor is going.\n\n//<Dr. Wettle purses his lips.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm too old for a lot of things. They never get tired of reminding me.\n\n//<Dr. Wettle drops the device. He is able to retrieve it with only one attempt, though he is forced to bend over again to retrieve his glasses for a second time.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Replication studies. The point, the entire //point// is that once you know something's true, you can damn well stop repeating it. But this fucking shit-show went on well past the point of scientific proof. I figured fate just wanted me to give up, you know? So I gave up. And it got fucking //worse!// So what am I supposed to do? Wave at everybody as they pass me by, wait up for them like I'm their goddamn //mom,// and die the death of a thousand stubbed toes for my trouble? Like fucking //fuck.//\n\n//<Dr. Wettle stares into the screen for several seconds.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I didn't even get to be the anomaly. I'm not the main character in my own story. I put in my dues, all this time, and what's my big break? How do I get to save the day? A goddamn treadmill of Buster Brown. Buster Brown? Is that the right...? Doesn't matter. Point is, this isn't how I wanted to be remembered. But you don't get to decide that, do you? Everybody else does. And everybody else is an //asshole.//\n\n//<Dr. Wettle shakes his head.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm fifty-four years old, and I've been a joke for... I don't know how long. Most of that time. And I'm done with it. I know it's selfish, but you're going to have to find some way to fix this shit that doesn't involve me. I'm going to do the only thing I can do; I'm going to end it all. \n\n//<Dr. Wettle taps the screen, and the view shifts rapidly. He has presumably placed the device in his pocket, after unsuccessfully attempting to cease filming.>//\n\n//<The view returns suddenly to Dr. Wettle's face.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Okay, that came out wrong.

They discover the remains of the Chaos Insurgency's Hardened Mobile Array burning in Carnley Harbour; documents recovered from the site attest to an apparently lost Step Compilation culminating with a nuclear strike on Site-01. Though the state of the wreckage and unfamiliarity with the platform make precise determinations impossible, Foundation engineers report the likeliest explanation for the apparent accident is a catastrophic launch bay door failure. Further forensic investigation reveals the presence of anomalous components suffused with chronons, antichronons and tachyons, suggesting the Engine itself may have been present on the array at the time of detonation. \n\n**Reactive Action:** In light of its recent loss of materiel and manpower, the Chaos Insurgency's Activity Class is re-assessed from Level 5 (VARMT) to Level 2 (KULDE), falling below the Serpent's Hand, each sect of the Church of the Broken God, and Are We Cool Yet? among others for the first time since their respective Group of Interest classifications.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:16px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Array.jpg|\n    caption=Crash site, Hardened Mobile Array.|\n    align=center|    \n    width=700px|\n]]\n\nFrustrated with being stonewalled by Dr. Wettle, Researcher LeBlanc confronted him in his quarters on the night of 28 August.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//<Excerpt begins.>//\n\n//<Researcher LeBlanc enters the dorm room.

But why my parents, specifically?\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** While I was with Theta-7000, I got to see a lot of the SCP file. \"This is my whole life, has been since I don't know when.\" If you didn't know, I figured...\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Sorry you wasted a trip. To fucking Florida, of all places. That's what they call a double-waste.\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** It wasn't a waste.

He returned to his quarters alone, pacing for several hours before pushing a variety of random items off his bed and lying down to sleep.\n\nJust after midnight, he began speaking to himself.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** It can't be that simple.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Beddle.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. Wettle in bed, security feed still.|\n    align=right|    \n    width=300px|\n]]\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** It really... it can't be that simple.

Thorough Analytics Department canvassing returned the following new probabilistic effects on 29 August.\n\n[[div class=\"ad_memo\"]]\n**Item:** None identified.\n\n**Reactive Action:** None required.\n[[/div]]\n\nProbabilistic anomalies resumed their prior functionality at staggered intervals over the course of the day. The Narrative returned to Nx-18, SCP-4040 regained its former depth, and SCP-179 demanifested five arms before resuming her usual routine of threat identification. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Spit.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-4040, bottomless once again.|\n    align=right|    \n    width=300px|\n]]\n\nThe SCP Foundation had suffered thirty-eight casualties over the course of the LK-class scenario; of those killed as a result of the scenario itself, rather than direct enemy action, thirty-six have been posthumously identified as double agents for the Chaos Insurgency. The remaining two are under continued investigation. Despite significant global economic reshuffling, structural and material destruction and immeasurable interpersonal catastrophe, all civilian deaths attributed to SCP-7000 appear to have involved individual moral failing or spectacularly poor decision-making processes. Cover-up operations, including\n* smear campaigns against the present generation of mathematicians;\n* fraudulent scientific discourse to account for unusual mutations and atmospheric effects;\n* the creation of the nonexistent Sagitteried meteor shower;\n* fabrication of explanations for the total collapse of all futures markets; and\n* the containment of inexplicably-resurrected deceased professional baseball player Lou Gehrig, with his sudden appearance at Yankee Stadium explained away as an impersonation in bad taste,\nwill require extensive ongoing maintenance for the forseeable future.\n\nNevertheless, with the immediate crisis apparently over, Theta-7000 was placed on indefinite hiatus and its members returned to their former stations. The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority internally declared SCP-7000 tentatively neutralized, and stood down from priority alert after the autopsy of SCP-3856-1, Researcher Samuel Lloyd, revealed deviant Hume levels -- indicating that he was not, in fact, the multiversal iteration belonging to baseline reality, which was therefore unlikely to collapse. The correct iteration was subsequently located alive and in good health in a Chaos Insurgency safehouse after a rash of surrenders and defections during said organization's general disarray in the wake of SCP-7000.\n\nOfficial pronouncement of the end of OPERATION: BLACK SWAN is scheduled for 30 August.\n\nDr. Dan encountered Dr. Wettle at the Foundation-run food and drinks establishment Sam's Canadian Pub in Grand Bend, Ontario near Site-43 on the evening of 29 August.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<Excerpt begins.>//\n\n//<Dr. Wettle is sitting at the bar, drinking from a bottle of beer.

He writes most of my lines.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Seriously though, how you holding up?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm upright enough for a guy with a knife in his back.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Look.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** No, I get it. I'm not mad. This is what you're known for, right? You're the guy who doesn't need to play a game of chess to see how it ends. You know how all the pieces move already.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Everyone knows how the pieces move in chess. That's pretty basic.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** See? Didn't even miss a beat. That's Dr. Dan.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** So I suppose you figured it out, then.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** No, I didn't. Of //course// I didn't. I never figured anything out in my life before the other day. Someone else figured it out for me, and then I figured out they were right. God-damn replication studies all over again.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Who's the someone?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** A friend.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** And what did your friend tell you?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** That this was all about me. From the start, it was //all// about me. I caused it. This was my crisis.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Did he figure out why?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** He did.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** You don't mind if I gloat, and exposit?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I've had three beers, I don't mind much.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** It started with Blank's wedding, and your assistants dating.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** It started a long damn time before that.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Sure, fine, but it was the romance that set you off. It's a pretty chummy crowd at 43, and it hasn't changed that much while you've been there, but now they're all pulling away from you and you lost your shit.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I wanted to make something of myself. I wanted to //be// someone. I wanted a wife...\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Until you thought you were putting her in danger...\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** And I wanted a family...\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Until you thought your bad luck was contagious...\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** And in the end I just wanted everything to stay the same, and I couldn't even have that. So yeah, I lost my shit. I really thought my life would turn around at some point; I thought it for twenty damn years. Everybody says I'm slow, but I guess twenty years is my minimum speed.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** You decided you were done. You gave up. You were never gonna be popular, you were never gonna be noticed. You let the universe win.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** But the universe wasn't done playing.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** You tried to be content with nothing, so your anomaly made you the single most important, invaluable, famous person in the Foundation, in precisely the worst possible way. Because it wasn't what you wanted.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Uh huh.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** SCP-7000 happened because of //you.//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I don't even want to know what the body count was.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Universally assholes or idiots, far as the AD can tell, and a whole lot of people got a violent wakeup call they won't soon forget. They got a second chance to chart their courses in life, because of you, indirectly. And that's the key word, //indirectly.// It's not your fault. It's not like you ever had control over what was happening. Like everything else in your life, it just sort of happened to you. And as soon as you decided you kinda liked it, after our little pep talk, the corner turned again. You're not allowed to enjoy anything that much, right? So it took back everything it gave. Turned you back into nothing. No offence.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** 'Nothing' is one of the nicest things anyone's ever called me. But yeah, sure, that's a sensible explanation.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** I'm pretty pleased with it.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You singlehandedly tricked me into ending a K-class scenario.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** It's what I do.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You didn't, though.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Because you're wrong.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Pardon?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** A long time ago, I made a pact with the universe. To live a sucky life, but not //too// sucky. And then I forgot, and then I broke it. This was the revenge.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** What are you talking about?\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//<Excerpt resumes fifteen minutes after Class-X mnestic application.>//\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** I remember it like it's happening right now in front of me. It was in our old house on Stockwell Row, back in Peoria. I was going to bed; I'd been smoking in the garage, Simon was already asleep. I thought William would be, too, but just as I was walking past his room I heard him whispering to himself.\n\n**Researcher LeBlanc:** Can you remember what he said?\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** I can //hear// it. He's saying: \"Take anything else you want. Take all my stuff. Take all my friends. Take all my //chances,// take everything good and keep it... just don't...\"\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** \"...don't take my mom. \"\n\n//<Simon Wettle places a hand on his wife's shoulder.>//\n\n**Mindy Wettle:** \"Don't hurt my parents.

He shouldn't have had to go through that. \n\n**Mindy Wettle:** I never smoked again.\n\n//<Excerpt ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Turns out I was talking to the universe a long time before I met you. I told it to use me as a punching bag, and then I went to sleep. You ever remember those late-night thoughts the next day? I don't.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** So what, you're a two-time reality bender? Or you prayed to the ceiling, and Fortuna heard you?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** //Something// heard me, and it took me up on the offer. It got good value for the next few decades, and then... well, you got one thing right. Everybody else was moving on and up, except me. Everybody else had //change// in their lives. I wanted that. I //needed// that. And on some new unmemorable night, half-drunk, lying on my couch in my dorm in my underwear, I asked for it out loud. I didn't even remember until my friend thought to check the security feed.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Let me get this straight. You think you caused your own luck anomaly, and you think you made it worse by breaking the terms, and then... and then //what?// Deciding you liked it wouldn't fix that problem.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** No. Sorry, buddy.\n\n//<Dr. Wettle pats Dr. Dan on the back.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You're talking to the guy who beat the no-luck scenario. Because I decided I //didn't// like it, didn't like being important at everyone else's expense -- you should try introspection sometimes, I'm new to it and it's a //rush// -- so I did something about it. Because it turns out I might be fat and dumb and slow, and a magnet for other people's bullshit, but I am //not// helpless.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Wait.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I thought this was all happening to me, right? I thought I was stuck, but it was me all along! My life might be fucked up, but it's //my life.// I'm in control. I set the terms. I just never knew it until now.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Wettle, are you saying you //intentionally// set things back to normal? Made your deal with the devil again? You spoke to the ceiling, and the ceiling answered?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Pretty much.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Your speech did help, though. Too flowery, but the sentiment was nice.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Have you grasped the full implications of this yet?\n\n//<Dr. Wettle shrugs.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** A lot of things, I guess. What's on your mind?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** You, Dr. William Wettle, destroyed the Chaos Insurgency.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n//<Dr. Wettle laughs.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Every clown has his day.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** You're back to mixing metaphors.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Yeah, well, that's one of the perils of writing your own script. Hey, wait. There's another implication too.\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Which is what?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I outsmarted you.\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Well?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Well //what.//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Well, what's behind the blackboxes?\n\n//<Ambience on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You prom--\n\n**Dr. Dan:** [inaudible]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Huh?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** [inaudible]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I can't hear y--\n\n**Dr. Dan:** DANIELS!\n\n//<The other patrons turn to look at Dr. Dan, who is now standing with his arms in the air.

We do that, and we reclassify the LK scenario as 7000-D, and the invisible powers that be should be happy.\n\n**O5-5:** You're absolutely certain these are the explanations you want on record?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** Definitely. It takes all the credit away from Wettle, which ought to satisfy the flagellistic urges of his anomaly, and it's not like the CI are in any position to argue. If I'm right -- and minus one very embarrassing incident recently, I always am -- we should never have to go through this ridiculous rigmarole again.\n\n**O5-1:** It all makes a certain hideous kind of sense. \n\n**O5-10:** I understand the -D proposal, but I'm interested to hear your rationale for the new 7000 file. You don't think this risks tipping the balance back in his favour, causing another crisis?\n\n**Dr. Dan:** No, I think the loss of prestige ought to counterbalance it. I've run the whole thing past the Analytics Department, and they concur.\n\n**O5-13:** Still, why do it at all? He was never that important, never will be again.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Dan:** I think we owe it to him. Don't you?

No further containment measures are necessary.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-7000-D was a progressive probability failure on the planet Earth during July and August of 2022, precipitated by an ontokinetic eigenweapon known as the KISMET Device (SCP-7000-D-1). The device was destroyed by the SCP Foundation via tactical nuclear deployment (see Operation NELSON'S REVENGE for further details). As the effects of the probability failure have subsequently receded, it is presumed that the device's ongoing intervention in baseline reality was required to sustain it.\n\nContact the Analytics Department for a full accounting of known and suspected SCP-7000-D effects and occurrences.\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"anom-bar-esoteric\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= SCP-7000\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= euclid\n|secondary-class= memet\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7000/memet-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= keneq\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Replication2.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-7000 (on left) and staff, 2022.

No experimentation involving this anomaly is authorized without the explicit consent of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority or SCP-7000 itself.\n\nThere is no relationship between SCP-7000
