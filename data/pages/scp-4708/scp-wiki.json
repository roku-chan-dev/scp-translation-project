The origin point will be traced and MTF Epsilon-32 (\"Lennox's Boys\") are to investigate and apprehend SCP-4708, if possible. Foundation contacts within the entertainment industry will propagate the idea that these videos are \"deepfakes\"[[footnote]] A video editing technology used to combine and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos using a machine learning technique.[[/footnote]] created to humiliate SCP-4708.  \n>\n**Description:** SCP-4708 is Michael Gerard Tyson, the former World Heavyweight Boxing Champion. SCP-4708 is theorized to have reality-bending capabilities, though the exact nature and full extent of its anomalous abilities are undetermined. \n\nSCP-4708 is capable of transfiguring matter into entities resembling pigeons, documented as SCP-4708-1. Instances of SCP-4708-1 vary in size, ranging from 1-15 meters tall, with some instances displaying additional anomalous properties.\n\n**Discovery:** On October 10, 2019, a series of 3025 unique one-minute videos titled \"Mike Tyson's Magic Minute\" were uploaded simultaneously to the video sharing platform YouTube. These videos all feature SCP-4708 performing anomalous feats stylized as magic tricks.
