SCP-6664 is not to be climbed, for fear of damaging its branches.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6664 is a tree of the species //##blue|Malus domestica##//, more commonly known as the ##blue|apple tree##, currently located at ##blue|Site-87##. SCP-6664 is identical to other trees of its species, save for its anomalous effects.\n\nSCP-6664's anomalous effects activate whenever it is ##blue|approached## by ##blue|Dr. King##. When ##blue|Dr. King is positioned under the canopy of## SCP-6664, instead of ##blue|no effects## as expected, ##blue|all fruit on SCP-6664 will simultaneously disappear. All seeds contained within the fruit will fall to the ground. These seeds have## been designated SCP-6664-1.\n\nSCP-6664-1 ##blue|are motile apple seeds produced by SCP-6664##. SCP-6664-1 ##blue|are capable of manipulating where they land, universally using this to make contact with Dr. King upon falling.##\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 6664.01: Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-6664 was discovered on January 28, 2014, after ##blue|Everett King##, a ##blue|Foundation senior researcher##, reported ##blue|walking under SCP-6664, and being pelted by several apple seeds. After walking under SCP-6664 again a few days later, he was once again hit by several instances of## SCP-6664-1 and reported it as a possible anomaly. SCP-6664 was subsequently moved to ##blue|Site-87##.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Who wrote this? This article is blatantly factually incorrect.
