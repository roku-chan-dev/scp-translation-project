The Site is a converted 18th Century manor in Yorkshire, England, commonly referred to as Eckhart House.  Any unauthorized individuals found at Provisional Site-91 are to be interrogated for any possible connection to [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | Group of Interest ALPHA-019]]] (\"Serpent's Hand\").  Members of the Serpent's Hand are to be processed by the Ethics Committee.\n\nSCP-4612-B is uncontained at this time, as its whereabouts are unknown.  Foundation webcrawler I/O METATRON is to scrub all social media and internet postings for mentions of a figure fitting description of SCP-4612-B.  Mobile Task Force Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) are to be notified of sightings of SCP-4612-B.\n\n**Description**:  SCP-4612 refers to two related anomalies. SCP-4612-A is the body of a large limaciform invertebrate, consisting of white translucent flesh with elastic texture.  The body shows no sign of decay despite centuries having passed since estimated time of death.  The cadaver is ten meters in length, one meter in width, and lying atop a stone altar.    The cadaver’s anatomy includes six human arm shaped structures measuring 3 meters in length.  Each arm terminates at a hand with ten digits and a crystal structure in the palm.  A flexible fin travels down the length of SCP-4612-A.  \n\nThere is a lengthwise, posthumously executed incision along the underside of the cadaver.  The cadaver’s blood is bright blue and uncoagulated.  SCP-4612-A emits considerable amounts of [[[spikebrennan-s-proposal | Akiva radiation]]].[[footnote]] Physically quantifiable measurement of the prime thaumaturgical force.  Controversially referred to as evidence of “Divine Grace.”[[/footnote]] The cadaver has emitted a steady increase in its radiation for unknown reasons since its discovery.\n\nSCP-4612-A is housed in an underground structure beneath Provisional Site-91.  The door to the vault is located on the exterior of Eckhart House and leads to an underground structure beneath the wine cellar.  The door is inscribed with thaumaturgical glyphs which, at one time, induced a mild cognitohazard causing the viewer to ignore the entryway.  \n\nThe underground structure is constructed of stone blocks, many of which are charred and warped from heat.  Cuneiform glyphs of unknown thaumaturgical purpose are etched onto the surface of many of the stone blocks.  \n\nSCP-4612-B is a humanoid entity 1.75 meters tall of average build, with eyes that glow a bright blue.  SCP-4612-B has demonstrated the ability to manipulate thermal energy and exhibited anomalous strength far beyond what is expected given its height and build.    SCP-4612-B has referred to SCP-4612-A as its father, despite being two distinct species.

Eckhart was an active member in several occult societies and held regular meetings of such societies at his home.\n\nEckhart made his fortune mining iron and copper.  Local historians have theorized that he was investing in the burgeoning movement towards industrial revolution.\n\nRecords from the Yorkshire Historical Society mention a “meteor strike” occurring on the evening of September 17, 1779, causing significant damage to the House.

Mr. Eckhart was last seen by his servants entering his library on the morning of the meteor strike and was considered dead after the incident.  No mention of the underground structure or SCP-4612-A are made in the historical record.

The altar where the body lies is assessed as anomalous given its ability to hold the body without losing structural integrity.  Dr. Varga has decided that attempting to move the corpse would not nearly be as cost effective as testing on site.

The anomaly's form of life seems to be based on a blending of carbon and silicon, as the molecules that form the basis of its cells contain both elements.  \n\n**__Exposure to various elements__**: The sample was exposed to electrical current of various charges, alpha, gamma and ultraviolet radiations.  The sample showed no change in its state, absorbing electrical current and radiations noted without sign of degradation or decay.  Visible wavelengths of light (in addition to infrared) are not absorbed, but produce rippling motion in the structure of the fin running along SCP-4612-A’s length.\n\nResidual energies exposed to the sample of SCP-4612-A's flesh have been observed emitting from the crystalline structures present in its hands.  Transmittal of energies from sample to cadaver occur instantaneously.  It is theorized the crystalline structures were used to conduct energies in an unknown process.  \n\nThe lengthwise incision along SCP-4612-A’s body emits significantly higher Akiva radiation than the rest of the body.  The ritual or surgical procedure was apparently interrupted, as indicated by the bloodied palm prints along the length of the body.  It's theorized that the corpse was to be used in a thaumaturgical ritual of unknown purpose.\n\nX-ray imaging of SCP-4612-A is impossible, as the remains absorb radiation.

He stumbles, catches himself staring at SCP-4612-B.//\n> \n> **Eckhart**: Good God, what are you?\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: Step away from the body of my father.\n> \n> //Eckhart moves further away from SCP-4612-A.//\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: Murder wasn’t enough for you?  Must you desecrate my father’s corpse?\n> \n> //Eckhart is sweating, he turns to look at some of the other figures.  None step forward to support him.//\n> \n> **Eckhart**: I had no idea… I didn’t even know it was a “He”.\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: Answer me, fool. Why do you dissect his body?  \n> \n> **Eckhart**: I… that is to say, we, wanted to use it for a ritual working. For the productions of miracles.\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: Child, is this your miracle? //[SCP-4612-B points to the cadaver]// You killed the only living thing that truly knew me.\n> \n> **Eckhart**: Please, it was not our intention to  \n> \n> //Eckhart is interrupted as SCP-4612-B lashes out, its hand passing through Eckhart’s torso and exploding out his back.  A shower of blood and viscera splash onto the floor.  SCP-4612-B grasps the body of Eckhart and tears it in two.  The two halves begin to smolder and then burn as they fall to the stone floor of the chamber.//\n> \n> //SCP-4612-B looks down at the burning corpse of Eckhart for approximately 30 seconds.  The other figures in the room start to scream and some flee towards the exit.  SCP-4612-B looks up, its eyes shining.  One of the other hooded figures steps forward, holding out his palms.//\n> \n> **Unidentified figure**: Sir, please.  William was the architect of this drama.  We had scarce knowledge of your father’s existence.  We only hoped to improve the lot of all mankind.  In our wildest dreams, this result would have still seemed outlandish.  I beg you, have mercy.\n> \n> //SCP-4612-B pauses and looks toward the unidentified speaker.  SCP-4612-B steps forward and places its hand on the speaker’s shoulder.//\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: You wanted to achieve a goal, and so you have.  But did you ever consider the consequences?\n> \n> //The unidentified man’s hair and skin ignite, his screams only cut off by a strike of SCP-4612-B’s hand.//\n> \n> **SCP-4612-B**: Come, you apes, show me your miracles.  \n> \n> //For the next 12 minutes SCP-4612-B kills each of the 21 other figures, using fire and blunt force trauma.  After it has finished with the gathered occultists, SCP-4612-B stands before the corpse of SCP-4612-A, then sinks to its knees, in the same space occupied by Agent Douglas.  The blue light from SCP-4612-A dims, image of SCP-4612-B fades, leaving the underground structure as it appeared at the beginning of recording.  Agent Douglas collapses.//\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\nAgent Douglas spent 5 weeks in recuperation.  In that time, she was rarely conscious.  A figure resembling SCP-4612-B was seen entering Douglas’ room on video surveillance 36 days after her collapse.  Security staff was mobilized and sent to Douglas’ recuperation quarters, but there was no sign of SCP-4612-B.  When security staff approached Agent Douglas, she was alert but had a thumbprint on her forehead just above the bridge of her nose.  Medical personnel were unable to clean the mark from her skin.  \n@@ @@\nDuring debriefing, Douglas was asked to recount any discussion with SCP-4612-B prior to arrival of security staff.  Douglas reported that SCP-4612-B claimed she was only alive because she was merely investigating.  Additionally, Agent Douglas claimed significant interference of her psychometry, as all she could sense were the following words being repeated: “Eckhart died for a reason.”  \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nThe [[[hecatoncheires-cycle-hub | search for SCP-4612-B is ongoing]]].\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**[[[hecatoncheires-cycle-hub | Hecatoncheires Cycle]]]**\n[[size 80%]]**SCP-4612: Not All Gods Decompose** | **[[[scp-4712 | SCP-4712: A Failure of Purpose >>]]]**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4611]]] | SCP-4612 | [[[SCP-4613]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** site\n> **Author:** David Dixon\n> **License:** (CC BY-SA 2.0)\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:East_Riddlesden_Hall,_North_Yorkshire-geograph.org.uk-3500268.jpg | Site]]]\n\n> **Filename:** door\n> **Author:** Dietmar Rabich\n> **License:** (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Santorin_(GR),_Akrotiri_--_2017_--_2983.jpg | Door]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Eckhart\n> **Author:**\n> **License:** Image is in public domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Portrait_of_a_Gentleman_England_18c.jpg | Eckhart]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Sumerian\n> **Author:** Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin\n> **License:** (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cuneiform_inscription_on_a_diorite_mortar_stating_that_this_was_an_offering_from_Gudea_to_Enlil._From_Nippur,_Iraq._2144-2124_BCE._Ancient_Orient_Museum,_Istanbul.jpg | Sumerian]]]\n\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
