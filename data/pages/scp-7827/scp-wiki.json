SCP-7827 is composed of circular sapphires, set inside of copper lining. \n\nWhen a human female applies SCP-7827 to their earlobes, SCP-7827 will forcefully adhere itself to them and is unable to be removed through traditional means. Shortly after, the individual will enter a delirium where they are effectively paralyzed.\n\n After 3 minutes of contact with the earlobe, copper wiring will begin stemming from the object’s base. It will then navigate towards the subjects brain via ear canal at a speed of 12cm/min. If successful, SCP-7827 will began lacerating the occipital lobe, which leads to the victim's death. Once expired, SCP-7827 will swiftly return its wiring before ejecting itself towards the ground, where it will remain inactive.\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** SCP-7827 was initially recovered inside a residential apartment belonging to Beverly Rodriguez in Phoenix, Arizona. Beverly’s remains were discovered contorted on her living room floor, where a field agent discovered SCP-7827 laying nearby.\n\nFollowing SCP-7827 containment, Beverly’s phone revealed a series of text messages exchanged with Mason Dewitt, Beverly’s ex boyfriend. The following are the excerpts most relevant.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ CHAT LOGS - 04/12 (1)\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ massey\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]] Hey mason[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]waddup bee[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Listen.
