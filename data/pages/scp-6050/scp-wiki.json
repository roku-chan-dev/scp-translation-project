Embedded Foundation personnel within the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency must broadcast the weather conditions in the SCP-6050 area, emphasizing heavy rain and lightning strikes in its reports.\n\nAny traditional ritual and ceremonies local to SCP-6050's area must not be conducted in the SCP-6050 area regardless of how significant the event is. Any unauthorized access into SCP-6050 must be stopped by any means, including termination by lethal force.\n\n**Description:**  SCP-6050 is Foundation designation for Telaga Warna, a freshwater lake located in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. The lake has a surface area of 2.68kmÂ² and a maximum depth of 13.5 meters. SCP-6050 is known for changing its coloration periodically by the public.\n\nThe changing of Lake Telaga Warna's color (hereby referred to as SCP-6050-B) is indicative of SCP-6050's active state. Tests have shown that SCP-6050-B is not caused by organic matters (such as phytoplankton, sediment, silt, algae, or corals that absorb light wavelengths), but rather an anomalous state that forms a cycle.\n\nSCP-6050-B follows a cycle noted in Table 1A.\n\n**Table 1A - The Cycle of SCP-6050-B**\n||~ Cycle ||~ Period ||~ Coloration ||~ Additional Notes ||\n|| 1st Cycle || 1st January - 5th March || Deep Sky Blue color || Water temperature 8-15 degrees Celsius, slight breeze around the vicinity. ||\n|| 2nd Cycle || 6th March - 25th November || Spring Green color || Water temperature 18.8-24.5 degrees Celsius. No wind. ||\n|| 3rd Cycle || 26th November - 30th December || Venetian Red color || Water temperature 33.5 - 45 degrees Celcius. Noticeable high rate of wind. ||\n|| 4th Cycle || 31st December || Black Russian color || Extreme rate of wind and waves on the lake. ||\n\nSCP-6050-A and SCP-6050-C are the manifestations of anomalous weather patterns in the SCP-6050's area. An active state of SCP-6050-A or SCP-6050-C will usually be indicated by an instantaneous change of cycle to the 4th Cycle of SCP-6050-B, the formation of large cumulonimbus clouds, followed by heavy rain and large quantities of lightning strikes, with an exception of the activation of both events and its cataclysm.\n\nSCP-6050-A is an anomalous event that occurs annually on 31st December. The exact nature and magnitude of these weather phenomena have varied throughout the years. Despite the unusually high rate of the storm, SCP-6050-A has yet to cause harm to human beings.\n\nSCP-6050-C is an event similar to SCP-6050-A that will occur should certain activities are conducted in the lake's area, with the most noticeable example being rituals conducted by civilians (See Discovery Log and Addendum-B for a theorized explanation). The annual SCP-6050-A event does not occur after an SCP-6050-C event. As carelessly triggering SCP-6050-C activation may result in a wide-scale catastrophe, rituals are prohibited from being performed on SCP-6050's grounds.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6050 was discovered in 1968 by the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency. The Agency noticed the anomalous annual weather pattern it had observed for 20 years and reported it to the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nIn 1972, the SCP-6050-C event was activated, triggered by a ritual performed by the locals in Lake Telaga Warna's area. A rapid change of weather patterns caused heavy rainstorms, hurricanes, and flooding in the city of Bogor. This results in 17 dead, 59 injured, and 3 destroyed buildings.\n\nIn response, the Ministry of Agriculture and Foundation representatives lobbied to establish Lake Telaga Warna and its surrounding area as a national park to ease SCP-6050's containment efforts. As a result, Telaga Warna National Park was formed.\n\nCurrently, the existence of SCP-6050 is known by the public. Due to the 1972 incident, locals linked the SCP-6050-C activation event with SCP-6050[[footnote]]These reports were never proven, and are believed to be factitious[[/footnote]]. This can be attributed to the locals being aware of the SCP-6050-C activation event, although the awareness of SCP-6050-C being anomalous has been suppressed by the Foundation. This has led the public to refer to the SCP-6050 as \"Telaga Warna\" (Lake of Colors in Indonesian). SCP-6050 has become a major tourist attraction in Indonesia, featured in news, entertainment, and travel media due to the \"Legends of Lake of Colors\" caused by SCP-6050-C and the coloration cycle caused by SCP-6050-B.\n\n**Addendum-A:** Documented Attempts of SCP-6050-C Activation\n\nAlthough highly debated, the purpose of testing SCP-6050-C activation events was to push the boundary of what is considered as a ritual that affected the event. Ethics Committee ruling found that these testing are necessary to be done, but the Foundation must make reparation to civilians affected by SCP-6050-C activation events testings.\n\n||||~ June 15th, 1976 Activation Event||\n||~ Ritual Used || Sesajen [[footnote]] A plate of offering that consists of vegetables, jasmines and rose flower petals, and incense. Commonly used by the Javanese to communicate and interact with a higher being for blessings upon their crops. [[/footnote]] was performed for this activation event. ||\n||~ C Event || Black thunderclouds immediately manifested as soon as the ritual started. Rain began to precipitate, followed by a hurricane. ||\n||~ Summary || The activation event lasted throughout a whole day and a small-scale flood began to inundate the city of Bogor. Several local infrastructures are damaged and destroyed due to high wind pressure. ||\n\n||||~ March 5th, 1979 Activation Event||\n||~ Ritual Used ||Mappadendang[[footnote]]A ritual consisting of several male dancers and group musicians playing a rhythmic noise made by mortar by banging bamboo into the mortar to synchronize the dancer's movements.[[/footnote]] was performed for this activation event. ||\n||~ C Event || Storm clouds began to form, emitting lightning strikes at an unusually high rate one minute since the ritual started. D-Classes were instructed to continue performing the ritual process.||\n||~ Summary || The group of D-Class performing the ritual died from a lightning strike in the middle of the ritual. It is estimated that the rate of lightning strikes in the SCP-6050 vicinity was 100 lightning strikes per minute. ||\n\n||||~ October 10th, 1984 Activation Event||\n||~ Ritual Used || Tabur Bunga [[footnote]]A tradition where bundles of flowers, selections of flower petals, and water mixed with rose extract were thrown to a certain place or person.[[/footnote]] was performed for this activation event. ||\n||~ C Event || No weather patterns an indication of SCP-6050-B 4th Cycle were noticed throughout the whole day. ||\n||~ Summary || The ritual may not have any significance or relevancy to the SCP-6050-C activation event. ||\n\n||||~ July 1st, 1986 Activation Event||\n||~ Ritual Used || Mapag Sri [[footnote]]a large-scale ritual that is known as an offering for the Gods for their blessing the day after harvest season.[[/footnote]] was performed for this activation event. A dozen of D-Classes were instructed to perform the ritual. ||\n||~ C Event || Wind speed around SCP-6050 began to increase exponentially. Hurricanes and vortex were formed at SCP-6050's vicinity. Storm clouds began to form throughout the city of Bogor. Meanwhile, a seismic pattern was detected at Mount Salak at the time of the activation event.||\n||~ Summary || The activation event lasted for two days. A large flood and hurricanes caused 13 vital infrastructures to be destroyed along the process. A total of 20 deaths and 94 injuries were caused by this activation event. ||\n\n**Addendum-B:** Office of Tactical Theology Report\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/scp-4531/Department%20of%20Tactical%20Theology%20White%20Background%20Shiny%20transparent.png) center no-repeat; border: 5px solid black; width: 90%; text-align: center; padding: 5px; text-shadow: 0px 1px 1px white; color: black; background-size: 75%;\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[span style=\"font-size: 225%;\"]]**PREPARED BY**\n\n**THE OFFICE OF TACTICAL THEOLOGY**[[/span]]\n[[<]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 100%;padding-left: 50px;\"]]\n**Subject:** Lake Telaga Warna\n**Date:** November 17th, 1990\n**Site:** Reliquary Area-105\n**Report:** Investigation by the Office of Tactical Theology has discovered that Sri Ahni is a goddess within the Sundanese and Javanese tradition, major tribes and ethnicities in West Java. In the Lake Telaga Warna mythology, Sri Ahni is a goddess of harvest and agriculture in the Kingdom of Kuta Tanggeuhan, once a prosperous Kingdom that resides in the vicinity of Telaga Warna Lake. Sri Ahni had been described as a deceased deity that inhabits Lake Telaga Warna as her final resting place.[[/span]]\n\nThe following poem is a myth of the mythology, transcribed to English:\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:none; margin: auto; width: 80%; float:none; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; text-indent: 0;\"]]\nHear me out, for what Iâll tell,\nLearn what you need from this tale.\nMay you listen very well,\nAs I will tell you how a village could fell.\n\nOnce a long time ago,\nA village tale was told.\nThe villagers drown in sorrow,\nBecause crops wonât grow.\n\nRain wonât come,\nLong time they have gone.\nFear approach some,\nCan they keep living on?\n\nGod may hear their prayer,\nAs the star foretold, rain began to form\nThe cause of that? May due a child was born.\nWhoâs none other than the kingâs daughter.\n\nAs the kingâs and queenâs daughter grow,\nProsperity hastily follows.\nCelebration began to be thrown,\nFor the new goddess, they have to bow.\n\nAs goddess as they claim,\nA mere human she the same.\nHow the fortune keeps came,\nIs something she never tame.\n\nI am a man close to her,\nOften there when she's in somber.\nThe responsibility, that never hers to begin with, kept pressing harder.\nNormal life is never.\n\nYears go on, in another circle of stars.\nAnother celebration wonât be afar.\nItâs the 17th birthday is indeed a charm,\nBut for her is none but the largest scars\n\nTo rule the village is her destiny,\nAfter her adolescence, such is the certainty.\nAnd the villager claims to foresee\nThe glory brought by the divinity.\n\nThis all too much for her,\nAll the crops and all the golds,\nShe canât take it no more.\nAnd she ran for sure.\n\nI followed her as the others,\nYet I was too late for her.\nLying lifeless, everything went blur,\nSuch death is what she prefers.\n\nSadness surrounds the villagers,\nThe prosperity may come no more.\nBy god, that all they care for.\nSuch is the hidden corrupt on power.\n\nThey knew ill fate will come,\nThey do anything so the rain wonât gone.\nO I wish they known,\nSuch things should never be done.\n\nLet her rest,\nLet her rest,\nPlease it for her best.\nIs simply burying her too much to request?\n\nI tried to find the king,\nYet he has no longer been.\nI canât believe what I have seen. \nTheir bloodline end here.\n\nRain began to form,\nHas the villager succeeded on?\nOnly when the storm came upon,\nI knew everything will be gone.\n\nFor long the rain pouring down,\nDeath comes all around.\nFrom the crop up to the crown,\nEverything already drowns.\n\nI knew this will come,\nAs the rain pouring on,\nI took the boat and sat upon.\nThere I was watching on.\n\nYour funeral may not what we hope to be,\nBut at least you are now free.\nGoodbye Ahni.\nOr as I and you would like it to be,\n\nGilang Rukmini.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 100%;padding-left: 50px;\"]]\nFurthermore, during SCP-6050-A and SCP-6050-C activation events, a huge spike of Akiva radiation was detected during the latest SCP-6050-C activation event in 1986 by the Office of Tactical Theology. This suggests that a divine entity was present at the event.[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 100%;padding-left: 50px;\"]]\nIt is a recommendation from the Office of Tactical Theology that further testing regarding SCP-6050-C is to be ceased and all efforts should be put to prevent future events due to its cataclysmic effects. Additionally, no type of traditional rituals or ceremonies is to be held in the vicinity of SCP-6050 as it may cause SCP-6050-C activation event.\n[[/span]]\n[[/<]]\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6049]]] | SCP-6050 | [[[SCP-6051]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=nahyesq and PhoenixOfHope]]\n=====\n> **Name:** Gunung di Telaga Warna\n> **Author:** Ez co\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gunung_di_Telaga_Warna.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
