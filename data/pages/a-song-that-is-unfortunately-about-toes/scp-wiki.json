While this is inspired by true things(ish) I've embellished the story. And in any case I'd appreciate you not reading too much into it and enjoying the song as is.\n\nI've had a hard time coming up with a name for this one, too. I originally thought \"More than meets the eye\" but then I hated that so... I still don't know. Maybe let me know if you have suggestions?\n\nAs always, lyrics in the read more. Thanks for listening!\n\n~ Quintus\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Read More\" hide=\"- Show Less\"]]\n++++ Verse 1\nJesters and Jailers\nAttend to and tailor\nThe tale of war underfoot\nThe cogheads and serpents\nTowards battle aren't certain\nThey know that it all ends in soot\n\nWhile seeking protection\nThey build their collection\nA weapon unmatched by machine\nThe first stone is cast\nBut the one who laughs last\nIs the distant pedestrian queen\n\n++++ Prechorus 1\nThere's more than meets the eye to what's begun\nAlthough she's standing last, she has not won\n\n++++ Chorus\nThey say that all's fair in-- \nThat anything goes\nAnd what are they fighting for?\nNobody knows\nSo we're doomed to watch\nOr to fight I suppose\nWhile hand, cog, and flesh come to blows\n\n++++ Verse 2\nThe jesters in court\nHave a secret of sorts\nThat was stolen while under her watch\nThey didn't begin it\nBut once caught up in it\nThey left to take things down a notch\n\nThey have no excuse\nBut they value its use\nSo they keep it from all those involved\nTheir weapon stays hidden\nThe war stays unbidden\nTheir guilt they've completely absolved\n\n++++ Prechorus 2\nThere's more than meets the eye to what goes down\nThe jesters are not fools; they wear the crown\n\n++++ Chorus\nThey say that all's fair in-- \nThat anything goes\nAnd what are they fighting for?\nNobody knows\nSo we're doomed to watch\nOr to fight I suppose\nWhile hand, cog, and flesh come to blows\n\n++++ Verse 3\nThe jailers, meanwhile\nIn truth or denial\nAcquired a threat of their own\nThough quite the detectives\nThey seem ineffective\nAt working out truths not yet shown\n\nThey don't understand\nBut reach out to the hand\nAnd demand their compliance for aid\nThe snakes don't comply\nSo the jailers sit by\nAnd they never realize they've been played\n\n++++ Prechorus 3\nThere's more than meets the eye to what goes on\nThe jailers are not rooks, they are the pawn\n\n++++ Chorus\nThey say that all's fair in-- \nThat anything goes\nAnd what are they fighting for?\nNobody knows\nSo we're doomed to watch\nOr to fight I suppose\nWhile hand, cog, and flesh come to blows\n\n++++ Bridge\nThe jailers out of the way\nThe war becomes too hard\nThe jesters fail to see\nThey are the wild card\nMachine and Serpent joined\nDecide to finally bombard\nThe battlefield's left empty\nThe earth, forever scarred\n\n++++ Verse 4\nJesters and Jailers\nAttend to and tailor\nThe tale of war that has passed\nThe latter derisive,\nThe fools indecisive\nYou both must take blame for the blast\n\nWhile you sit there writing\nThere's wars that need fighting\nThe heroes have ended their scene\nThough they paid the cost\nNot all hope is lost\nTo defeat the pedestrian queen\n\n++++ Prechorus 3\nThere's more than meets the eye to what lies ahead\nThough she's still standing tall her army is dead\nAnd one more final secret that I've found\nIf you combined your power you'd take her down\n\n++++ Chorus\nThey say that all's fair in-- \nThat anything goes\nAnd what is it all for?\nWell, nobody knows\nAre we doomed to watch\nAnd to stay writing prose?\nThere's a time we must all come to blows\n\nNo, nothing's quite fair here\nBut anything goes\nThere's dangerous people\nWe all must oppose\nWill they join the fight?\nWe'll see, I suppose\nIf jailers and jesters\nThe betters and lessers\nTogether, 'gainst flesh come to blows\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**LikeClocksWork commented:**\n\nHonestly, I think \"More than meets the eye\" is a fine name. You clearly haven't told us all that's going on, and that title encompasses that. Great song, dude!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**The-Wicked-Music-Man12 commented:**\n\nI love the imagery in here! The lyrics are so dark. Have you considered \"Coming To Blows\" as a title? Or maybe \"Jesters and Jailers\"? Either way, excellent job.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Thr33ThirtyThr33 commented:**\n\nGood song! Kinda sad though. I hope things get resolved with whatever it is you're going through.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Quintus55 replied:**\n\nMe too.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[module ListUsers users=\".\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**%%title%% commented:**\n\nI liked the song, but what the actual fuck is the file name implying?\n[[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=true | hub=no\n| previous-url=/scp-5591 | previous-title=Easy-Fake Oven\n| next-url=/ | next-title=/\n| hub-url=/ | hub-title=toejamcon2020\n]]",
