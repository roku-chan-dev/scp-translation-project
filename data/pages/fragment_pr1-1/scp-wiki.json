The fact that it's basically a urban legend made me helpless in giving him a really goofy looking \"scary\" face.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-1732-JP\" hide=\"teach those plushes a lesson they will never forget\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/exIIWMem.png width=\"300px\"]]\nyea, this scp was weird. not even going to sugarcoat how weird it was. it. was. weird!!!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Bobble's Basics In Education And Learning\" hide=\"that's me!\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/EDBa05Hm.png width=\"300px\"]]\nthis was a dumb crossover with SCP and an indie horror game i like that got fucking 300+ on reddit. i guess ill list down what all the characters are.\nplaytime is 053, baldi is 993, it's a bully is 303, the principle of the thing is 036-JP-1, arts and crafters is a sock with 1439 on it, and Gotta Sweep is 1837.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"682 bursting and transforming out of someone (idk)\" hide=\"ow oof owie my mental and physical health\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/wn376Nwm.png width=\"300px\"]]\ni had fun making this one and i even put it in SCP-682-J.\n\nyou know, the entire reason i want to add this is because it's a fuck you to /r/SCP! some random asshole told me it was shitty and i got really stressed out cuz im a pussy and took it off. well now its officially on the wiki so take that random asshole.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"dont click its classified!!!!\" hide=\"o fuck\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/DpO9DNnm.jpg width=\"300px\"]]\nit's 085 and 1005. i have no words\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-719-JP\" hide=\"i for one, welcome our rhino overlords\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/k1bSxx7m.png width=\"300px\"]]\nit was fun to read and it was fun to draw, this SCP has it all, a play, rhinos, body horror, did i mention rhinos.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-2747\" hide=\"[DATA LOST]\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/nWJ2xIfm.jpg width=\"300px\"]]\nI havenâ€™t seen a meta SCP done as well as 2747. minmin is prob one of my favorite SCP writers.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-374-JP\" hide=\"i am a hobby\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/cZAQMChm.png width=\"300px\"]]\nSCP-374-JP is probably one of the weirdest metaphors for reeling in a fish and throwing it out.

to draw the two new characters introduced.\n\n1st Prize is 2521 and Filename2 (the character in the hidden ending) is 2786.\n\n1st Prize is such a pain in the ass because he's just a more bothersome
