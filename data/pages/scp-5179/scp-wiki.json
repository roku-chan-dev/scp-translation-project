Save for testing, SCP-5179 is to be clamped shut and sealed in an airtight bag for preservation. Authorization from at least two Senior Researchers is required for testing, and only Class-D personnel are permitted to handle SCP-5179 without safety measures. When testing, SCP-5179, and any attached D-Class Personnel, are to be moved to a 15m by 15m by 10m chamber. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5179 is an AISC[[footnote]]Australian International Schools' Certificate[[/footnote]]-distributed textbook labeled \"Book 3 GLOBAL COMMERCE\". When an individual opens SCP-5179, they and anyone within a 10-meter radius will immediately be displaced into a pocket dimension.[[footnote]] Hereby referred to as SCP-5179-O.[[/footnote]] Reading SCP-5179 without activating these anomalous effects is impossible. When the use of a Remote Controlled mechanical arm was attempted, the operator -Technician J. Hawkins- was affected despite being 20 meters away. SCP-5179-O is a to-scale replica of the Australian desert region, commonly known as the \"Outback\". Instead of terminating where the region does, when crossing the edge of an \"Outback\" an individual will find themselves at the entry point of SCP-5179-O.[[footnote]]Equivalent of -24.563300192199172, 131.19130551866186 on Earth.[[/footnote]] SCP-5179-O is inhabited by wildlife identical to the Australian Desert Region. However, no human-built structures are present other than Foundation Research Site 5179-O.\n\n**Addendum-5179-1:** As of 4/14/2021, SCP-5179 is to be put under testing limitation, due to a lack of information gained by doing so. To request an expedition, contact Head Researcher D. Sanderson. Further information is restricted to Level-3 Personnel\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Level 3 Access Only\" hide=\"- Acces Granted\"]]\n-----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= outback1\n| caption= SCP-5179-O, taken by image capture drone on ██/██/2021\n]]\n**Mission Code Name:** Operation \"Green Martyr\"\n**Related SCP:** SCP-5179\n**Mobile Task Force Resources Involved:** Ten (10) Members of MTF-Lambda-5 \"White Rabbits\"\n**Date:** 4/12/2021\n**Mission Summary:** On 4/8/2021, D-3928 was ordered to open SCP-5179 while equipped with a trans-planal locator. Upon opening SCP-5179, D-3928 disappeared, as did the locator. Signal was lost for approximately 15 seconds, before reconnecting on plane 194382.-49210. After attending personnel confirmed D-3928's vitals, Internal Security assets amnesticized all personnel present. Research Administration approved an expedition to determine the nature of the plane, and attempt recovery of the 14 personnel lost to SCP-5179.\n-----\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nCommunications established!
