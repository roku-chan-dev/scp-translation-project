An oar\npaddling on the upside-down lake. I am\nsorry for my kin, they are but bones now in a church's \ngarden. They are watered with their own tears so\nthe single rose a bishop lays there grows. Life\nis strange now. I feel lost in the neon signs\nand the upwards mountains. I think I've\nmade my choice. There is no place for\nme here, Earth is not my home. Men\nare not my brothers. I am going to\nlive where the tune of his pipe\nbrought me, and I will kiss\nthe world that once had\nthe cottage I lived in\ngoodbye. I will live\nout my days\nclimbing.\n\n//-found on a piece of parchment at the bottom of a small hill in Lower Saxon, Germany by local Agents.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
