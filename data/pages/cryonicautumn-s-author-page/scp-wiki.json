Semi-active on IRC and the forums.\n\n**Hit:** Dumb humor, absurdism when done well, techno that isn't dubstep, [*http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/ Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff][[footnote]] and the parent comic, don't @ me [[/footnote]], existential horror, Advance Wars 2 (where I shamelessly stole this format from), chess (feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any questions on competitive or speed chess), parkour (even if I'm not terribly good at it).\n\n**Miss:** --I guess they never miss, huh?-- \n\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Collected Works]]\n\nIn chronological order, my contributions to the site are as follows:\n\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4903 SCP-4903: Eternity, Served Cold]. My first contribution, and the least deadly thing the Foundation has ever found.\n-----\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3034-J SCP-3034-J: Voresnake]. Yeah, uh, we don't talk about this one. Moving on.\n-----\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-939-j SCP-939-J: Crime Time Canine]. A talking dog that solves mysteries. \n-----\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4312 SCP-4312: Drift Into the Sky].

I had been a lurking reader for some time before this, and noticed that many new authors tried to make something dangerous with the \"hook\" being that it can kill you. I figured the other extreme was scarier: what if it //can't// kill you, and what if //nothing// can? How would somebody react to being trapped forever, unable to die? [[footnote]] [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3001 SCP-3001] was a tangential inspiration to this aspect of it. [[/footnote]] The time dilation was originally added to increase the isolated horror, but ended up as a vehicle to play Elmsway off of 4903-1 and to introduce some ideas through Project Timaeus. Elmsway was originally going to be just the inventor of the device used in the retrieval attempt, but I ended up giving him a larger role as a foil and tragic hero. Timaeus is a direct reference to the Allegory of the Cave, a semi-pretentious work where Plato characterizes everyone who disagrees with him as a blind cavedweller. However, it does fit well with the themes explored in Project Timaeus. \n\nThere is another implicit effect of 4903. Essentially, anything within is doomed to be forgotten over time, and is harder to refer to the longer they stay. It's touched on a bit, but that's the hidden horror of the piece. There are others within 4903, but they have been reduced to mere wisps in terms of presence, perpetually forgotten. 4903-1 suspects this, but is prevented from elaborating by the effects, and every time they get close to full realization the antimemetic effect kicks in and they forget again. This was originally spelled out obviously within the article, but I changed it to be a more subtle thing, where figuring it out isn't crucial to enjoyment of the work.\n\nAlso, the initial draft of this thing sucked bad. It was an anomalous painting posted during clichecon, where I had no idea that clichecon was going on. I self deleted it in under a day. To the new authors on the site, don't get discouraged by an early crash and burn! \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-3034-J\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3034-j SCP-3034-J: Voresnake]\n\nThis resulted from a throwaway joke on IRC about [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3000 SCP-3000] basically being vore with djkaktus in the room. I was initially worried that I would write something that would offend the authors of 3000, but they didn't have any problems with it in that area. This served as a sibling draft for Cathedral of the End (hopefully coming soon) to work off some of the stress and just have some comedic writing in tandem with a serious draft. \n\nNothing too deep here, just some off the walls humor that I had a blast writing. I've gotten responses everywhere from \"horribly unfunny\" to \"new favorite -J\" so be sure to check it out for yourself and see where your opinion falls.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-939-J\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-939-j SCP-939: Crime Time Canine]\n\nThis was inspired by a series of games of SCP Secret Laboratory where I managed to talk my way to victory by enlisting the help of the 939 player and the SCPs to investigate multiple gruesome murders. We may or may not have been responsible for said murders. I thought it was funny enough to inspire a -J, and so it did. Also, there's a small reference to //Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.// \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-4312\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4312 SCP-4312: Drift Into the Sky]\n\nA shorter article expressing how randomly and easily people can die within the SCP universe. First draft was written in a two hour blur at 1 in the morning, but there was plenty of refining afterwards.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-4272\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4272 SCP-4272: The Proper Way to Appreciate Art]\n\nThis was likely the work that evolved the most over the time I was writing it. Originally, it was an off-the wall silly idea that was funny enough to take to Ideas and Brainstorming and IRC. The first draft read like a cartoon. By the second draft, I was beginning to wonder about what type of person Big Johnny was, and what would drive him to such ridiculous actions. I ended up crafting him into a character that I can respect despite the absurdity: someone who didn't have the best childhood, got picked on, accidentally hurt the bullies with his anomalous abilities (in this case, trying to get away but accidentally transporting the leg of a bully that was kicking him was what I had in mind), and learning to embrace the weird and hit back at \"the man\" in a unique and pacifistic way. It was still a blast to write even though it was somewhat deeper this time. \n\nAlso props to SCP research for teaching me more about famous art than school ever did.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\nMore to come!\n\nCheck out a half dozen unfinished/unstarted works in my [*http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/cryonicautumn sandbox!]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
