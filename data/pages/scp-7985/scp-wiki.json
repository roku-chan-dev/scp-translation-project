In low dosages it provides effects similar to a mild stimulant, although most users also report impaired cognition and difficulty forming thoughts. SCP-7985-1 are circular white pills with the text “Mylex™” stamped into their side. SCP-7985-1 is so far the only known delivery vector for SCP-7985. Approximately 50mg of SCP-7985 is present in each dose of SCP-7985-1. \n\nThe anomalous effects of SCP-7985 are only apparent at high dosages or after prolonged, persistent exposure to low dosages of the chemical. Under these conditions, it begins to have extreme effects on cognition and individual agency significantly beyond those generated by conventional narcotics.\n\nAll further testing involving SCP-7985 has been permanently suspended following the review of materials taken in the raid leading to SCP-7985’s initial discovery and containment. \n\n**Addendum 1:** Recovered Materials\n\nAll known instances of SCP-7985-1 in Foundation custody were discovered in a raid on ███████ Co., a civilian pharmaceutical concern. It is unknown how ███████ Co. first came to possess SCP-7985-1 [[footnote]] No facilities for the production of SCP-7985-1 were found on-site or at any ███████ Co. property. [[/footnote]], and all involved civilians were amnesticized following SCP-7985-1’s capture and recovery. The following materials were recovered along with 86 instances of SCP-7985-1.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**TRIAL INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**PRODUCT:** MYLEX™ 50 MG\n\n**DATE:** 4-7-1983 - INDEFINITE\n\n**SUMMARY:** Subjects are to be administered Mylex™ once every 48 hours. After each administration, the status of each patient is to be assessed via the following questionnaire: \n\n1: Please rate your level of wakefulness over the past 48 hours. 5 is an average level of awareness, while 10 is extremely drowsy and 1 is extremely alert.\n\n2: Have you experienced any unexpected pains/cramps over the past 48 hours?\n\n3: Have you felt any nausea or other unexpected symptoms over the past 48 hours?\n\n4: You trip over a dead squirrel/bird/other nonspecific small animal on the sidewalk. Do you keep walking or check your shoe?\n\n5: Would you rather lose a leg or an arm?\n\n6: You have been found, bureaucratically, to not exist. Do you attempt to re-register yourself w/ the state, or use this opportunity to vanish?\n\n7: Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex™? \n\n8: What is fear?\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**INTERVIEW FORM**\n**Interview #:** 12-5\n**Patient Name**: Jorge Poitros\n**Doses**: 5\n----\n\n**[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]**\n----\n\n**I**: You trip over a dead squirrel/bird/other nonspecific small animal on the sidewalk. Do you keep walking or check your shoe?\n\n**Patient #12**: Could it be a chipmunk?\n\n**I**: If you wish.\n\n**Patient #12**: I don’t like chipmunks. I keep walking. If it’s under my foot I figure it darn well deserves to be there.\n\n**I**: Would you rather lose a leg or an arm?\n\n**Patient #12**: Leg. Arms are how we exist. Generally, when we do something considered to be part of “living”, we do it with our arms. The hands play a role, but it’s minimal.\n\n**I**: You have been found, bureaucratically, to not exist. Do you attempt to re-register yourself w/ the state, or use this opportunity to vanish?\n\n**Patient #12**: Vanish. Social Security can bite me.\n\n**I**: Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex™?\n\n**Patient #12**: I did, but I forget why. It’s a wonder drug. I wonder why I did.\n\n**I**: What is fear?\n\n**Patient #12**: Hey, you’re not going to take me off this stuff if I answer wrong, right? \n----\n**[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]**\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**INTERVIEW FORM**\n**Interview #:** 17-8\n**Patient Name:** Cynthia Barangsa\n**Doses:** 17\n----\n**[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]**\n----\n**I:** Do you hold any particular antipathy towards Mylex™?\n\n**Patient #17:** I couldn’t hate it. No, I couldn’t hate it. But I don’t like you. You’re what makes it real and painful. When it’s just me and my nervous system, I can pretend I don’t feel anything. It’s all just– you know, small parts of a crumbling whole. I’m 67. I can comfortably pretend random pains and sensory oddities are just transient things brought on by age. Decay claims everything. Even without any specific condition, I’m going to hurt and suffer and feel sick for reasons I can’t understand.\n\n**Patient #17:** But you make it real. You tie it all back to this drug. I don’t get to escape from it and shove it all into tomorrow. I’m suffering real and actual pain because of a choice I made. I don’t like that idea.\n\n**I:** What is fear?\n\n**Patient #17:** What I feel when I think of my heart quietly stopping when I’m four hours into the night. The idea of an empty supermarket. I feel a tightness in my throat when I think of a barren shelf. Disorder in places we most expect control. Just-in-time shipping is my idea of God.\n\n**Patient #17:** Not you. I don’t think of you. Should I be doing that?\n----\n**[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]**\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**INTERVIEW FORM**\n**Interview #:** 5-26\n**Patient Name:** Marty Przowski\n**Doses:** 57\n----\n**[IRRELEVANT CONTENT REDACTED]**\n----\n**I**: Have you felt any nausea or other unexpected symptoms over the past 48 hours?\n\n**Patient #5**: Breathe. Yes I have. Bright fluorescent light. My mind is like. Breathe. It’s frozen. No thoughts go in or out. I have an itch on my leg. If I don’t say something I forget it. I forget it if I say it, too, but if I say it at least it doesn't just vanish. There’s a spider on your hand. \n\n**Patient #5**: I want to go back to being nauseous. Then I knew I felt something.

It was determined to be relevant to SCP-7985, and was attached to the file for the object for preservation. The original document is presumed lost. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**MYLEX™**\n**MISSION STATEMENT**\n\nTraditional focus groups are presented with one central problem: the difficulty of accurately sampling a truly average American. People are too idiosyncratic on the level of handfuls and dozens that most groups typically operate. Too many individual quirks: not enough people with the same birthdays, incongruent political beliefs, membership in opposing bowling leagues, etc.\n\nMylex™ solves this issue. Say hello to the real, truly average American: a collage of dozens of demographically typical individuals. All opinions expressed are that of a representative sample. A focus group of merely 12 Mylex™-boosted Americans has been demonstrated in multiple commercial studies to be substantially more accurate than normal focus groups in determining consumer tastes and preferences.\n\nTry the marketing revolution. Try Mylex™.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7984]]] | SCP-7985 | [[[SCP-7986]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
