After an especially hard day of work and law school, the two of us would be wiped out, exhausted, and likely covered in blood. I remembered that Morningstar loves chocolate chip cookies, so I dug through my mother's cookbooks and found my mother's recipe for protein-packed chocolate chip cookies.\n\nWe tried it, and found it very delicious. While demons and angels do not need to eat, protein is still vital in muscle development and regeneration from lost tissue. These provide three sources of protein, and only have a total of seven ingredients. Morningstar and I can not get enough of them. We often pack these cookies on our more dangerous missions, and as a treat for our workouts.\n\nWe hope you enjoy them as much as we do.\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ Prep: ||~ Cook: ||~ Amount: ||\n|| 15 mins || < 30 mins || 24 cookies||\n\n\n+++ Ingredients: \n\n* 2 large eggs[[footnote]]  Eggs can be replaced with 6 tablespoons of ground chia seed or 2 liquified soul gems\n [[/footnote]]\n* 2 cups smooth peanut butter (no added sugar)[[footnote]] Peanut butter can be replaced with almond, cashew, ichorweed, or sunflower butter. [[/footnote]]\n* 1 + 1⁄3 cups monk fruit sweetener[[footnote]] Monk fruit sweetener can be replaced with brown sugar, a brown sugar substitute, coconut sugar, blood sugar, or erythritol.[[/footnote]]\n* 1 to 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips\n* 1 cup casein protein powder (preferably vanilla or flavorless)\n* 1 + ½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract (if flavorless protein, do not include otherwise)\n* ½ teaspoon sea salt\n\n\n\n+++ Tools needed:\n\n* Oven\n* Baking sheet\n* Contract paper (mundane parchment paper will also work)\n* Mixing bowl\n* Mixing implements\n* Star-shaped cookie cutter (optional)\n* Rolling pin (optional)\n\n\n+++ Instructions:\n\n# Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F/815°R/450K.\n# On baking paper, write well wishes and expressions of endearment towards the person or persons the cookies are intended for. Spells are optional, and should be written with the consent of all involved.\n# In a mixing bowl, combine all ingredients. Thoroughly stir, until evenly mixed.\n# Separate and place each cookie on a baking sheet lined with the parchment paper (ink side down).\n# Place in middle tray, and leave in the oven for 12-14 minutes, or until edges brown.\n# Remove from oven and let tray cool.\n# Enjoy it with those closest to you.\n\n++ Preference Notes:\n\n**Adrian** likes a bit extra salt. Extra ½ teaspoon.\n\n**Astia** likes hers coated in jimmies.\n\n**Morningstar** loves all variants, but adding additional chocolate chips is popular with him. He also enjoys them with ketchup for some reason, but that has no impact on how the cookies themselves are baked.\n\nI, **Primrose,** prefer a hint of cinnamon. 1 teaspoon.",
