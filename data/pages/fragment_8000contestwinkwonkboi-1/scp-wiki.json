Breathing life into a jumbled alphabet of words, I can almost taste it. Each step closer sends another shiver down my spine, down my legs. I get closer and closer and it grows ever more cold.\n\nFear, anxiousness, the likes. Too familiar yet too much to handle. Against me, it's like they're against me. With every opportunity I meet, a path of thorns follow. I still recall how they puncture into my skin as I try to pull through. It hurts, it hurts so much that I end up walking backwards. Salt water trickles from my cloudy eyes as I try to compose myself. Stumbling, falling, getting caught in a cage of daggers. It hurts, it still hurts despite it all. I always end up running away.\n\nSometimes, I wish I can just stand and watch. \"It's better secondhanded,\" I try to convince myself. \"It's better this way.\" At some points, it rings true.\n\nBut now, looking at you, I find my legs in motion. A pushing force leading me to you, leaving me to bleed once more. Frustrating, it's frustrating exposing myself like this. You're making a name for yourself in front of my very eyes, yet I stay grounded. I've moved on, yet I want to reach you, to reach my full potential. It's like I'm halfway there, like I can almost be…\n\nI can almost //be…//\n\n…\n\nA world of worlds within a comfortable mind, my pen grows ever more warm.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Burntwood:** //(Groans)// Huh, what the…\n\n**SCP-8245:** You alright there?\n\n//[SCP-8245 stands over Burntwood who is laying face-down. It helps her up, dusting her off. She proceeds to look around what seems to be a tunnel, the walls being covered in papers containing sketches of varying completion.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Quite the trip, huh? Probably should've given you a heads-up, sorry about that.\n\n**Burntwood:** No, it's fine, but… where are we?\n\n**SCP-8245:** Ah, of course. Right this way, ma'am.\n\n//[The entity leads Burntwood through the tunnel to a noticeable light in the distance. She inspects the numerous drawings surrounding them.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** You know how art is formed, when the gears are turning and the points are connecting. It's never as simple as a ride from one to another. There's always going to be drafts, plotting, some form of preparation.\n\n**Burntwood:** Right.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Right, and when it comes to art, I want it to be perfect. I want to pour every ounce of myself into the process, no matter how fine the details are. Especially now, considering my audience.\n\n//[The specimen turns to Burntwood.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Hm?\n\n**SCP-8245:** Anyways-\n\n//[Both continue to stroll as they approach the opening.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** -I've always been met with ideas, pieces of me that I want the world to see. So much so that I can't work on all of them as swiftly as I want. Though, it's only a matter of time till they see the light.\n\n**Burntwood:** So, is this… where you store your ideas then?\n\n//[SCP-8245's hat flickers green.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** That's it, that's where we are. Welcome to-\n\n//[They reach the end of the tunnel, stopping in place. Burntwood's mouth is agape.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** -my think tank.\n\n//[The environment consists of a dark, extradimensional space with a visible radiance in the far distance, light purple in color. A makeshift house hovers in the area's center, accessed via a staircase of platforms exclusively made from paper and canvases. Sheets of paper are also present floating about the space as well as various art supplies.]//\n\n//[A description of the house itself cannot be pinpointed due to it constantly shifting its size, dimension, color, and texture. The sound of an orchestra can be faintly discerned.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** O-Oh, god…\n\n**SCP-8245:** Lot to take in, huh? That's the beauty of an artist's mind.\n\n**Burntwood:** Yeah, um //(gulps)//, it's very mesmerizing.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Eh, it's a bit barren. Still, appreciate the comment.\n\n//[The anomaly grabs her hand.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Let's get right to it now!\n\n//[Burntwood takes a deep breath.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Alright, sure.\n\n//[SCP-8245 marches forward with Burntwood trailing behind, who is pressing her clipboard closer to her chest. They proceed to walk up the staircase, causing their surroundings to change abruptly with every step they climb. Examples include a classroom containing numerous bipedal creatures, a room lined with bookcases that are too tall to be captured on film, the inside of a bell tower with machinery made of Lego blocks, a massively-sized board of the game Monopoly occupied by sentient pieces, and a flying carpet overlooking a city surrounded by lava.]//\n\n//[Eventually, they are met with the residence's front door.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Here we are.\n\n//[The entity notices Burntwood breathing heavily.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Abby?\n\n**Burntwood:** Huh? Oh- uh, yeah?\n\n**SCP-8245:** What's with that look? No need to be nervous or anything.\n\n**Burntwood:** No, no, I'm not… nervous. I'm just excited, is all.\n\n**SCP-8245:** If you say so.\n\n//[SCP-8245 swings open the door and gestures inside.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Ladies first.\n\n**Burntwood:** Heh, right.\n\n//[Burntwood enters the building, arriving in a living room space. The walls frequently change color and pattern, with a lamp hanging from the ceiling. A couch resides in the middle, appearing to be stitched from multiple fabrics of varying amount. The television across displays a wide array of animated clips, unknown in origin. A door is open immediately next to the front entrance as well as a lever in the far corner of the room.]//\n\n//[A number of drawings are framed on the walls in addition to numerous canvases scattered about.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Oh, looks pretty cozy.\n\n**SCP-8245:** I like to keep myself comfy, though I should've tidied up a bit. Didn't plan to have a guest over, but here you are. Make yourself at home!\n\n//[Burntwood sets her clipboard face-down on a coffee table by the couch. The specimen walks to the lever and pulls, causing the wall beside it to lower and cycle through a series of rooms before settling on a kitchen. It proceeds to the counter.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** I'll go ahead and make some tea. Just sit there and relax, Abby.\n\n**Burntwood:** Uh huh.\n\n//[She observes the surroundings as SCP-8245 takes out a tea set from the cupboards. The anomaly opens the teapot's lid and shoots tea inside using its finger. The liquid produces a steam that form various shapes.]//\n\n//[Before long, the specimen comes back with said tea set, levitating and landing it on the table. SCP-8245 then rushes over to sit beside Burntwood, pouring her and itself a cup while putting cream and sugar in its own. They take a sip from their drink.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Mm, that's the good stuff right there. Nothing like a quick refresher in-between pieces, am I right?\n\n**Burntwood:** I hear that.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Reminds me of the times I went by your house. You know how your mom used to brew us tea whenever I dropped in. First time I ever had it, never thought I'd like it as much as I do now.\n\n**Burntwood:** Ah, right. I do remember that. We'd just brainstorm the entire time, talking over each other about ideas and whatnot.\n\n**SCP-8245:** //(Chuckles)// Great times, great times. Hey, how is your mom doing nowadays?\n\n**Burntwood:** How's my… How's my mom?\n\n**SCP-8245:** Yeah, how is she? She holding up well?\n\n**Burntwood:** Well, I don't usually… talk with her that often these days.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Really? How come?\n\n**Burntwood:** Nah, you know. Just really busy and all, you can't have all the time in the world for personal things. I mean, I know my mom. I'm sure she can take care of herself. There's no need for…\n\n//[Burntwood stares at her feet, scratching her cup.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** …no need for me to check in on her.\n\n**SCP-8245:** I'm sure you're not //that// busy. Any plans at least?\n\n**Burntwood:** Heh, not really.\n\n//[She chugs down the rest of her tea.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** That's fine, though. I just have to show her how far I've come ever since I left the bird's nest. I… //(sharp inhale)// I have to.\n\n**SCP-8245:** I'm sure you will, Abby. Want a refill?\n\n//[Burntwood looks to her side, setting her eyes on her cup.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Hold on, let me try something.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8245/coffee.jpg|caption=Relevant image|width=250px]]\n\n//[She sets down her cup before squinting and focusing on it for a brief moment. It is then suddenly filled with a black liquid. SCP-8245's eyes widen noticing this.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Oh ho ho! I see you, I see you. Aren't //you// a show-off?\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Scoffs)// Whatever, thanks.\n\n//[Burntwood takes a sip before jolting.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Hm, it's… it's coffee.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Coffee? You drink coffee now, Abby?\n\n**Burntwood:** Yeah, I've, uh… I've taken a liking to it.\n\n**SCP-8245:** It's so bitter, though. I thought you hated bitter things.\n\n//[She pauses, smiling awkwardly.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Right, sorry. Shifting tastes and all.\n\n//[A momentary silence follows between them as they continue to drink from their cups.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** //(Clears throat)// So, about your writer's block.\n\n**Burntwood:** Oh? Oh, right! How, uh- How should we do this? Is there some magical process that'll-\n\n**SCP-8245:** //(Smirks)// It's more of a brainstorming session really, just like before. Nothing like a discussion between artists, huh? That being said-\n\n//[The entity leans in closer.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** -what's it about?\n\n**Burntwood:** Hm?\n\n**SCP-8245:** Your story, your draft. What do you have so far?\n\n**Burntwood:** Ah, I mean-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Any sketches, any descriptions? Ooh, maybe you can reenact it through acting! That sounds like a fun idea.\n\n//[SCP-8245 reaches for Burntwood's clipboard and inspects it briefly.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Or maybe this notepad can help. You were holding onto it this entire time. Seems like a pretty weird place to store all your work, Abby-\n\n//[She immediately snatches back the clipboard.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** No, don't. You… You shouldn't look.\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Uh, sorry. I didn't- I just…\n\n//[Burntwood stares at SCP-8245, who is silent.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** …I need to use to bathroom.\n\n**SCP-8245:** //(Inhales)// It's down the hall… first door to your right.\n\n//[She stands up and hurries to the door by the entrance. Burntwood glances over at the specimen before leaving.]//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Burntwood:** //(Under breath)// God, you idiot. You're such a fucking idiot.\n\n//[Burntwood hits her head repeatedly as she scurries down the hall.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Why can't you just… //UGH-//\n\n//[She stops in place, facing the floor.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Just break it to him, Abby. Can't you do something as simple as that? You can't even keep your own promise, now what? Gonna keep up this whole charade until the end of time? What's wrong with- //(sniffs)// you-\n\n//[Wiping her eyes, Burntwood tries to compose herself. She breathes heavily and looks to the ceiling.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** She wouldn't want you doing this. //They// wouldn't want you doing this, but… //why?//\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** No, I know why. I'm not-\n\n//[She turns to her right.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** -stupid…\n\n//[Burntwood is met with a wooden door. It is white in color, possessing floral patterns painted throughout its entirety. She stalls before grabbing the knob and turning, pushing the door open.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Oh.\n\n//[The bathroom's walls and floor are a slight pink hue. Stars hang from the ceiling and numerous animal plushies (a fair majority of them being skunks) are huddled in the bath tub. Heaps of drafts stack on the mirror table, all containing paragraphs of text. More papers are taped to the walls.]//\n\n//[Burntwood walks in and takes one of the sheets, skimming through its contents. She is noticeably shaking.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** This… I wrote this.\n\n//[She shifts through the other papers.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** I wrote all, all of this. I thought I threw them away. How…\n\n//[Looking up, she is met with her reflection. She stares at it blankly.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** No, I didn't get rid of them. I never got rid of them at all.\n\n//[Burntwood grips her draft in hand, caressing it with her thumb.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Under breath)// Artists, we're supposed to be artists. //I// want to be an artist too, but…\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** …I should apologize.\n\n//[She dashes out the door and scurries back, making her way back to the living room. Taking a deep breath, she returns with her head hanging low.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Will, I just want to say-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Abby.\n\n//[Burntwood looks up to see SCP-8245, who is holding her clipboard. The entity turns to her with a confused expression.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Hey, wait. You weren't supposed to-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Abby… wha- what's this? Is this supposed to be your story?\n\n**Burntwood:** I told you not to read that! Why did you-\n\n**SCP-8245:** I know, I'm sorry. I was just curious, is all. But… what is this?\n\n**Burntwood:** Uh, um…\n\n//[She falls silent. The anomaly stands, scanning through the notepad's contents again.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** What's with this formatting? These weird terms? All of this, everything here sounds so… so dull. It reads off like it's dead, like there isn't any feeling put into it. Why- Why do you have this?\n\n**Burntwood:** I-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Did you write this?\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Pause)// Will, you have to understand-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Did. You. Write. This?\n\n//[Burntwood gulps, staring elsewhere.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Yes, yes I did. But-\n\n**SCP-8245:** You wrote this? //You// wrote this? No, no, nonono. That can't be. I mean, look at this. It sounds off, none of this screams Abby. It doesn't scream anything even close to you. It's like- It's like…\n\n//[SCP-8245 glares at her.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** …like you didn't care.\n\n**Burntwood:** No, I do. I //do// care.\n\n**SCP-8245:** It even says my name, under some confusing nickname. And this- and this logo… I've seen it before. Are you- are you with //them?// Those people trying to stop my performances, you were aware of them this entire time?\n\n**Burntwood:** Mm…\n\n**SCP-8245:** And you didn't say a single thing? At all?\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** I thought you said you became an author. You said you were writing your big debut. Was that a lie too?\n\n//[Another pause.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Nods)// I did, I did. But, I promise I-\n\n**SCP-8245:** You promised you'd leave your mark on the world, that //we'd// leave our mark on the world. Our creative- our passionate side. And now you're just- just doing this? How am I supposed to believe you?\n\n**Burntwood:** You… you can't.\n\n//[A longer period of silence passes.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Okay, I think you should leave.\n\n//[The specimen walks toward Burntwood and grabs her arm, pulling her out the building and down the stairs. The aforementioned description of locations reappear in reverse order.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Will, please! You have to listen.\n\n**SCP-8245:** Listen to what? Your lack of stories? Your lack of drafts? Your lack of anything close to what you've been telling me?\n\n**Burntwood:** I was going to tell you, I just- I just-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Just wanted to mock me for what I do.\n\n**Burntwood:** No, no. Please-\n\n//[They reach the bottom of the stairway, where an open passageway stands. Walking through, the pair return to Elfreth's Alley. It is dark outside.]//\n\n//[The anomaly lets go of Burntwood, shoving the clipboard into her arms and hiding its face with its hat.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Will, it's not what you think. I didn't want things to be this way-\n\n**SCP-8245:** Abigail.\n\n//[Burntwood freezes in place.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** Next time you folks try catching me, don't go pulling these tricks. I'll be there showing the audience everything the arts can be, what //they// can be, and I don't want you to stop that. You //can't// stop that.\n\n//[The entity crosses its arms.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** I thought you were better than this. I thought you wouldn't let them tell you how to hold a pen. //(Sharp inhale)// Guess I was wrong.\n\n//[SCP-8245 turns its back toward her.]//\n\n**SCP-8245:** It was nice catching up with you, Abigail. Goodbye.\n\n//[The anomaly goes back, closing the door before Burntwood rushes to it, trying to open it. She bangs it repeatedly, crying out to SCP-8245, as she falls to her knees and faces the ground. Burntwood sobs quietly.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Under breath)// Come on, Will. Please, I didn't mean- no, I'm sorry… I'm sorry, Will…\n\n//[She bangs on the door a few more times before ceasing.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Open the door! Please, just //(sniffs)//… listen to me!\n\n//[She buries her face into her palms.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** God, why can't you just… tell him, you fuck! You don't deserve-\n\n//[Burntwood chokes, weeping for the next few minutes.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Sniffs)// Ugh, what do I even… I don't- I don't want to go back. I can't just go back. They're going to know, they're…\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** No, I can't- I can't let it end like this. I have to go back, but how… I'm no writer, I'm not even- //shit!// \n\n//[She looks over the clipboard in her hands before snapping it in half using her knee, throwing it on the ground, and constantly stomping on it. In the end, Burntwood pants as she kicks it around some more.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** What am I thinking? That won't help either, //damn it!//\n\n//[Burntwood breathes heavily as she shrinks, swearing under her breath.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Out of all the things in the world, why this? Why now? Why can't it be different? I can do better, I know I can! It's just- Why can't I just go back… //(stares at ground)// Why can't we just start-\n\n//[A light radiates from behind Burntwood. She turns around.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** -over?\n\n//[She is met with a white, wooden door. It possesses a familiar floral design. Burntwood observes her surroundings as she slowly steps toward it. The sound of a child laughing can be discerned from the other side.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** You again?\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Why is this… why?\n\n//[Another pause. Burntwood steps in, gracing the door with her hand.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Always coming back to me, huh. I- I thought you hated me… I thought I'd hate you too, eventually. No, it's my fault. You shouldn't be here, no reason to be. You'd be better off leaving like they said. And yet, here…\n\n//[She grips the handle.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** No, I… I never left, did I?\n\n//[Opening the door, Burntwood sees nothing but pure light.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** //(Exhales)// Okay, let's do this.\n\n//[She steps inside, closing the door behind her and taking a few steps. There is nothing but brightness around her. Burntwood scratches her head as she looks around.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** How did Will even do all this? Where do I even start?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** I guess it's a matter of thought. Maybe, probably… hopefully. Well, no. Since I'm the one doing this, I should know how to pull this off.\n\n//[A ringing sound is heard.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Um… //(shouts)// once upon a ti-\n\n//[The entire area begins to rumble before returning to normal. Burntwood stops, quickly shifting around.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** …time?\n\n//[Another brief silence.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Uh, I guess nothing happened-\n\n//[Burntwood proceeds to plummet without warning, screaming in response.]//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"table3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//[Burntwood lands on a ramp and is shot forward due to the momentum.

Her surroundings feature many elaborate and impossible structures which are presumably other ramps.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Oh ho, okay. Uh, this is- this is new.\n\n//[She slowly stands as she continues to zoom through the area. Burntwood looks up to see a sketched version of a sun, wearing sunglasses and a helmet.

She appears confused.]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Actually, now that I think about it, haven't I seen you before-\n\n//[A grumbling sound is discerned, followed by the sudden appearance of a green eye through the window. Retracting itself, it's revealed to belong to a red dragon made of papier-mâché]//\n\n**Burntwood:** Oh… Betty.\n\n//[Burntwood smiles sheepishly as the dragon sticks its mouth in and begins to inhale.
