There was a tape, played over the loudspeakers, with \"Madam Wunder\" - the creepy bitch - greeting everyone and getting them excited for the coaster. Standard stuff, for the day.\n\nUntil //it// happened.\n\nSomething must have fucked up when the recording was done, because suddenly the only thing myself and the dozens of other kids in line could hear was something that sounded like it came straight out of Hell itself.\n\nThe hiss of the tape became like the crackling of fire.

The thing was, though, even as a kid, I had a gut feeling he wasn't sincere. Like he was more worried about his perfect opening day being ruined than how terrified the kids in line were.\n\nHowever, we all did calm down eventually, as the prospect of going on a brand new roller coaster for the first time made us forget - even for a bit - all about what was assumed to be a technical error.\n\nMy dad and I got lucky; we ended up in the very front of the first cart.\n\nIt wasn't that great, in hindsight. The seats were uncomfortable, and the bar restraint was too tight against my stomach. But I didn't care, back then, because I had the privilege of getting the best view of the coaster.\n\nToo bad the Wundercoaster stalled before we even went up the first incline.\n\n...\n\nOh, it only took them about twenty minutes for the operator to reset the ride. I could tell that Hoag was pissed beyond belief when we came back down. I could see him arguing heavily with another man wearing a hat, though I couldn't make out what they were saying.\n\nThankfully, the second attempt went off without a hitch, and we got free popcorn and cotton candy to make up for the mess.\n\nShame what happened to the coaster later.

They told me things like I was \"too inexperienced\", \"didn't have the cash\", \"a fool to take on the likes of Disney and Wynne...\"\n\nAnd it all got to me. Hard.\n\nI was driven to drink, in the dingiest bar I could find, when //he// approached me.\n\nHe was a tall fella, and I couldn't see the top half of his face because of the shadow his brimmed hat gave. I could see, though, that he had a crooked nose, and an even more crooked smile.\n\nHe had the gall to clap me on the shoulder, and drawl out, \"Why so glum, chum?\"\n\nNormally, I would've just slapped his hand away, but...\n\n//(Silence on the recording for 10 seconds)//\n\n**BH:** ...Grandpa?\n\n**RH:** ...I don't know why - maybe it was just the buzz the liquor was giving me - but I felt like I could trust this man. And so I broke down, dumping my woes onto this complete stranger, who just stood there silently the whole time.\n\nI looked up at him with bleary eyes, expecting him to dismiss it all.\n\nBut his grin only grew wider.\n\n\"Well, you're in luck, friend,\" he said. \"I happen to be a man with certain…connections, and I can do much more than make your dream a reality. I can make it surpass your wildest expectations.\" \n\nI couldn't believe my ears. It sounded almost too good to be true. But I felt sobriety creep back up onto me, and I asked, \"What's the catch?\"\n\nThe man just chuckled. \"Nothing you have to worry about for many, many years,\" he reassured me. \n\nI shoulda seen that for the warning sign that it was, but I was drunker than a skunk and bein' told my dream could come true.\n\nHe then pulled out a checkbook, and signed a check for a million dollars right there at the bar, slidin' it towards me.\n\nI only hesitated for a moment, to look at the signature - \"Mr. Nick\" - and then snatched it up.\n\nThat wasn't the only thing \"Nick\" gave me. Soon, I had some of the best contracters, construction workers, and advertisers from the whole state workin' around the clock to help make \"Wunderpark\" a reality!\n\nOf course, it wasn't all smooth sailing. There was the death of Samuel Otte, but I managed to bounce back from it pretty quickly...\n\nBefore I knew it, the park was open, and despite a few setbacks, things were goin' swimmingly. I had a successful local amusement park, a steady supply of income, and while I didn't have the nationwide fame I'd been wanting, I still made a name for himself in the local circles!\n\nBut then...\n\n**BH:** The incidents?\n\n**RH:** ...Yeah. \n\nThere was that kid that got concussed, then the college student, then all those people getting stuck. I would always find myself in a panic every time it happened, wonderin' if this was the \"catch\" that \"Nick\" had told me about! But I'd managed to pay my way out of the troubles that came to me.\n\nAnd for the one time I couldn't, even with some of the best lawyers I could afford during that damned class action suit, I still managed to make my way out unscathed!\n\n...I could never prove it, of course. But I had a feeling that sunuvabitch played a part in getting me off the hook!\n\n...Then I had that dream...\n\n...The night before //it// happened...\n\n\"Nick\" and I were sittin' across from each other in armchairs, only a small table with cigars between the two of us.\n\n\"The time to pay your debt is approaching, old chum,\" he told me, taking one of the cigars and lighting it with just a flick of his fingers, taking a few puffs from the damned thing so smoke would blow in my face. \"You best prepare yourself.\"\n\n//(Silence on the recording for 30 seconds)//\n\n**BH:** ...Grandpa? ...Grand--?\n\n**RH:** I shoulda never trusted that fuckin' bastard. I knew, right then and there, \"Nick\" had been responsible for everything that'd soiled my beautiful coaster! That he'd been Jewin' me--\n\n**BH:** //(Simultaneously)// Grandpa, you can't say that--\n\n**RH:** -- since day //goddamn// one! Every death, every injury, every hit to my bank account and reputation, it was all because of that bastard!\n\nI don't know who, or //what//, he really is, but he'll rue the day he fucked with--!\n\n//(RH gasps)//\n\n**RH:** He's here...\n\n**BH:** ...Grandpa... There's no one there...\n\n**RH:** No no no no no no, please! I didn't mean it, Nick! S-stay back... I'm beggin' you, stay away from me--!\n\n**BH:** Grandpa... There's--\n\n**RH:** Stop! D-don't come any closer--!\n\n//(The sounds of a body thumping against wood, the creaking of a mattress, a rattling gasp of air)//\n\n**<RECORDING ENDS>**\n[[/div]]\n\n...My Grandpa was dead.\n\nI put my hand on his arm, and jerked away immediately after.\n\nIt was cold as ice, like if the warmth had been completely sucked out from him.\n\n…\n\nNow, I don't believe in no devils, or whatever my Grandpa thinks he saw before he passed, Doctor.\n\nI think, personally, he was just trying to find a way to shift the blame on somebody else, even to the very end.\n\nBut //something// had terrified him in those final moments, and I don't want to ever find out what it was...\n------\n**Post Scriptum:** Bobbi Hoag was given a class-C amnestic and released back to the public.
