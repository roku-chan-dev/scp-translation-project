There's no good reason for it to be over there instead of just a tale about SCP-4820 on this wiki, but the Wanderer's Depths contest prompt broke me out of a writing funk and for that I'm grateful.\n* Social Butterfly - I don't do much critting these days, but I used to. One of my proudest contributions to the SCP wiki is greenlighting and critting [[[SCP-5392]]].\n* Senior Researcher - I joined back in 2018. I'm old!\n* Ten Steps Forward - My tenth (surviving) page was [[[The Drooling Path Part 4]]].\n* Pollice Verso - My 1,000th vote was on [[[SCP-3636]]].\n* Contender - The list of contests I've participated in has grown too long to practically list here, which I see as an accomplishment in itself.\n* Guest Star Appearance - 6314 has a cameo from the Russian translation of SCP-4225.\n* Team Building Exercise - Again in 6314, the Foundation actually has a peaceful interaction with the Circus of the Disquieting.\n* Are We the Baddies? - We are in [[[SCP-7314]]] and [[[Red Pool Superfund Site]]]. \n* Dr. Worldwide - [[[SCP-5356]]] has been translated to five languages. So has [[[I a polar bear covering my nose in a snowstorm]]], technically.\n* Periodic Publisher - Including the epilogue, the Drooling Path has six installments.\n* Tall Tales - My tenth tale is [[[A Nightmare on 17th Street]]].\n* Rise from the Ashes - [[[SCP-039]]] and [[[SCP-2068]]] are rewrites.\n\nIncomplete:\n* Canon Crossover Central (0/1) \n* The SEXTANK Initiative - SE_TANK\n* Thank You For Your Cooperation (6/7) - I have collaborated with [[*user TAWNYOWLJONES]], [[*user GLASSAUTOMATON]], [[*user DRDAPPER]], [[*user SOUND CHASER]], [[*user ETHAGON]], and [[*user MASTERTMAN2]]. I refuse to count [[[One More Tomorrow]]] for this because it's really more like a collaborative log where we each kind of did our own thing, rather than a proper co-authoring situation.\n* Double Double Agent (1/4) - UIU\n* The Challenger (1/3) - Impostor Syndrome: [[[SCP-7587]]] is my best [[*user DR LEONERD]] impression, though [[*user WERYLLIUM]] understandably thought I was copying him instead. \n* Making Strides (45/50)\n* Student Participation Award (0/2)\n* Anartist Portfolio (3/5) - I made the crude schematics for 7314 myself. The \"Oslo\" entrance to [[[SCP-8297]]] is a picture I took at a creepy rest stop in central Tennessee. The picture in [[[SCP-8775]]] was taken by me of my own guitar.\n* Knowledge is Power (0/1)\n* Engaged (0/1)\n* The Centurion (45/100)\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n-----\n\n[[size larger]]**__KOTH'S KREATIONS__**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=Krack Open Kollapsible |hide=Klose Kollapsible ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-list= --]\n|language=en\n|order=created_at\n|perpage=250\n|background-image=\n|shadow=\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size larger]]**__KOTH'S KO-AUTHORSHIPS__**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=Krack Open Kollapsible |hide=Klose Kollapsible ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthor-header= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=scp-6976\n|feat=tawnyowljones\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=friday-morning\n|feat=GlassAutomaton\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=friday-afternoon\n|feat=GlassAutomaton, DrDapper, and Sound Chaser\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=friday-night\n|feat=GlassAutomaton\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=moving-pieces\n|feat=Ethagon\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=scp-8851\n|feat=Ethagon and MasterTman2\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n[[size larger]]**__KOTH'S KOLLABORATIVE KONTRIBUTIONS__**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Krack Open Kollapsible\" hide=\"Klose Kollapsible\"]]\n\nIn addition to the entries specifically mentioned here, anything with Lee Roy Carlson's name attached to it is mine.\n\n* [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs |978]]] - Conrad Scott, Researcher Talloran, Draven Kondraki, SCP-076-2, SCP-466, SCP-134 (I think), SCP-082, SCP-527 and my own skips.
