A slot is located beneath this plaque.\n\nOpening the entrance will result in the entrance automatically closing after a period of 20 seconds. Following this, the entrance will be unable to be opened for 50 seconds. Should an object have been present within SCP-5562, an envelope will be deposited from the slot. This envelope will contain all secret information contained within the inputted object.\n\nNo inputted objects have been present upon reopening SCP-5562.\n\n**Testing Logs:**\n\n> **Test 001**[[footnote]]Accidental; Agent Tate became trapped within SCP-5562 during initial discovery.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Input:** Agent Sarah Tate\n> \n> **Output:** Agent Tate's bank details and passwords to her computer and email.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-5562 taken into Foundation custody for testing of any anomalous properties.\n\n> **Test 003**\n> \n> **Input:** The full text of //The Hobbit// by JRR Tolkien, encrypted using a Foundation one-time pad.\n> \n> **Output:** The decrypted text of //The Hobbit//.\n> \n> **Results:** The anomalous capabilities of SCP-5562 have been confirmed.\n\n> **Test 026**\n> \n> **Input:** An intercepted message from ORIA Outpost 12 to Tehran Headquarters.\n> \n> **Output:** A message confirming the presence of ORIA agents within Ghana to monitor potential anomalous activity.\n> \n> **Results:** As this was a breach of ORIA agreements with the GOC, this information was leaked to the GOC through embedded Foundation agents.\n\n> **Test 054**[[footnote]]Requested by the Foundation Internal Tribunal Department.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Input:** Senior Researcher Arthur Illingworth's encrypted hard drive.\n> \n> **Output:** Illegally procured photos of subordinates, emails blackmailing subordinates and threats of retaliation if reported to senior personnel.\n> \n> **Results:** Output was used as evidence in Illingworth's subsequent trial.\n\n> **Test 076**[[footnote]]Interrogation requested by the British Occult Service.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Input:** Sir Edward Filey, Head of the British Occult Service's Cybersecurity Division.\n> \n> **Output:** Information confirming the presence of illegal backdoors to the British Occult Service's internal database.
