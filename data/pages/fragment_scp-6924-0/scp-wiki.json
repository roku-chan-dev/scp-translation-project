A campaign of disinformation regarding previous reports of anomalous phenomena in SCP-6924-A and SCP-6924-B, claiming all anomalous activity related to them as urban legends, is currently underway. MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\") personnel are to remain stationed in the area surrounding the village in case any incidents arise. An investigation into the origins of SCP-6924 is to be carried out as soon as possible.\n\nDue to the isolated nature of SCP-6924-A/B, as well as the shortage in personnel [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8425 following multiple] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/salvation incidents], further action has been deemed unnecessary. The [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/horizon-initiative-hub Horizon Initiative] is not to be informed of the anomaly. \n\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Description**__\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=road_village.jpg|caption=The road exiting out of SCP-6924-B.]]\n\nSCP-6924 is the designation for a phenomenon of unclear origins affecting two villages in the Hajnówka County, Podlasie Voivodeship, Poland. Any person born in areas affected by SCP-6924 has significantly better health compared to the average population, with inhabitants of both communities having an average lifespan of 100.5 years.\n\nSCP-6924-A is the village of Mięsiny, located at the northern edge of Hajnowski County. The village is home to 193 people and contains a library, a Catholic church, two grocery stores, a butcher's shop, a public football field and a cemetery in addition to civilian houses. The village can be accessed through a single road going into the village.\n\nSCP-6924-B is the village of Sarnowo, 7 kilometers south of SCP-6924-A. The village houses a population of 76 and contains a Catholic church, a grocery store and a butcher's shop in addition to civilian houses. SCP-6924-B can be accessed by a single road passing through the village and towards SCP-6924-A.\n\nAll inhabitants of SCP-6924-A and SCP-6924-B have reported themselves as Catholic and regularly attend Sunday mass. The connection between this fact and SCP-6924 is currently under investigation.\n\n\n> = You are currently viewing a provisional file for an anomaly under active investigation\n> = [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6924/offset/1 View investigation report?]",
