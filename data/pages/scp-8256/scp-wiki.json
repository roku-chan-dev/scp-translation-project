Instead, Foundation efforts focus on disinformation campaigns in both the public and academic spheres, discrediting any reports of either 'disappearing' or 'reappearing' galaxies as either hoaxes or photography errors with parties involved being administered Class A amnestics. Foundation WebCrawler 8256, nicknamed the, \"//Galactic Hunter//\", is tasked with monitoring online astronomical and astrophotography groups and forums for references made to **SCP-8256**, with any media related to **SCP-8256** being deleted, with associated individuals administered an amnestic via an anti-memetic screen message. Foundation agents embedded in national space agencies and academic institutions are to discourage the study of sky where **SCP-8256** is located and are to manually edit **SCP-8256** out of any photographs or videos before publication of scientific material.\n\n**SCP-8256** is currently monitored weekly[[footnote]]Using 2 hour long exposure photographs[[/footnote]] by Sr Researcher Sarah Broder at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-12 Site-12]'s astrophysics department, with any major visual or structural changes to be immediately reported to Site 12's site director. Should an Almada event occur O5-█, Dr Williams, NASA and the ESA are to be immediately contacted, with a relevant cover story released to the public if required.\n\n\n**Description:**\n[[include component:image-block name=SCPSTARLOCATION|caption=Current location of **SCP-8256**, (indicated by the small red dot).]]\n**SCP-8256** is an intermediate spiral galaxy, measuring approximately 24,000ly across and 2000ly in thickness[[footnote]](± 2,100ly and ± 108ly)[[/footnote]], currently located approximately 116 (± 4.7mly) from Earth in the //Columba// constellation, (0.4° north-east of γ[[footnote]]Gamma[[/footnote]] Columbae). The object has an Apparent magnitude of 12.72 (± 1.1V) with no other apparent anomalous physical characteristics that would set it apart from other non-anomalous spiral galaxies typically found in nature. SCP-8256 consists of four massive spiral arms. predominantly blue, pink, and white, surrounding a bright galactic core with an estimate number of 100 billion stars (±5 billion) . At its centre lies a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 2.5 million solar masses.\n\n\n**SCP-8256's** primary anomalous property is that no biological organism is capable of viewing it through a telescope, binoculars or any other optical instrument, regardless of the optical size of the instrument, (see experiment logs). Instead observers will simply see a regular patch of sky, filled with an average amount of stars. However, this effect does not extend to photographs or videos of **SCP-8256** with viewers initially able to view the object for 5 - 10 seconds, until **SCP-8256's** second primary anomalous effect will manifest. This will cause the individual (hereby designated **SCP-8256-A**), to become unable to view any photos or videos of **SCP-8256**, for a certain period of time. Describing that these appear blurry, nonsensical or simply aren't visible and appear as either blank white or black. Notably, this perceptual anomaly is not universal. Unaffected observers can view images and footage of **SCP-8256** without issue, and written descriptions, data, and measurements related to **SCP-8256** remain legible to all individuals, including **SCP-8256-A**. \n\nThe third anomalous property of **SCP-8256**, is that individuals who has observed **SCP-8256** will slowly over a period of between 30 minutes and 2 hours forget the physical description of the object, nor will they be able to describe what **SCP-8256** looks like. However, this does not affect data or information of **SCP-8256**, as individuals will still be able to recall how large the galaxy is, amount of stars or other numerical values. \n\n**Almada Events:**\nDue to reasons currently unknown **SCP-8256** is capable of spontaneous dematerialization and rematerialization in space, often moving 10's of millions of light years instantly. These events, are proceeded by a sudden increase in X-ray radiation emissions from SCP-8256 for 49 - 120 seconds. Both these events and the new location of SCP-8256 appear to be random, (refer to File-8256 Revision: 26/12/90, File-8256 Revision: 28/08/99 and Incident-8256-4), with no apparent pattern or visible related variables between manifestations. Subsequent investigation of regions affected by Almada events utilizing **SCP-2154** has revealed a higher amount of X-ray, microwave and infrared radiation, as well as a noticeable decrease of stars and an increase of nebulous activity.\n\n----\n= **[[size 150%]]Experimentation and Discovery[[/size]]**\n\n**Experiment logs of SCP-8256**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Initial observation experiments with SCP-8256\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nInitial Observation Experiment 1\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD8256-A\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nEvents\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nDXXXX-A was ordered to attempt to view **SCP-8256** through three separate telescopes: \n* A 12' Dobsonian-Newtonian telescope\n* A 8' Refractor telescope\n* SCP ██████ Lunar Telescope\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nResults\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAs expected, D8256-A was unable to view SCP-8256 and described seeing a normal amount of stars in all telescopes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n _\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nInitial Observation Experiment 2\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubjects\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nChimpanzees: \"Bella\", \"Ham\" and \"Max\"\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nBackground\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nUnder Foundation biological researcher Dr Mitchell, three chimpanzee's were trained to be able to identify spiral galaxies through the process of a reward system upon pressing a button if one was identified.

This led to the official identification **SCP-8256**. All affected NASA and ESA personnel were administered Class-A amnestics, and a cover story was disseminated, attributing the leaked image to digital manipulation by an unidentified group.\n\nFollowing Incident-8256-1 and further study of **SCP-8256**, in 1991 study of **SCP-8256** was transferred over to the Foundation and an agreement between NASA, ESA and the Foundation allowed for embedded agents to prevent further study of **SCP-8256** by the agencies. \n\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"text-align:;\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident-8256-2\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:50%;\"]]\n[[image LunarWatchSpaceTelescope {$alt}=\"{$alt-text}\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\nSTS-38 in Low Earth Orbit after deployment of Foundation Orbital Telescope Lunar Watch.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n= **[[size 150%]]Incident-8256-2[[/size]]**\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Andromeda_constellation_map|caption=Location of **SCP-8256** from 02:32 to 03:32 following Incident-8256-2 on December 25th, 1990 (indicated by the small red dot).]]\nAt approximately 02:32 (GMT) on December 25th, 1990, the Foundation’s lunar orbital telescope, //Lunar Watch//, reported an anomaly regarding **SCP-8256**. For one hour, the object had seemingly teleported from its known position near β Crucis in the Crux constellation to 0.8° west of β Andromedae in the Andromeda constellation before returning to its original location sixty minutes later. Additionally, **SCP-8256** moved approximately 27 million light-years closer to Earth, with its apparent magnitude increasing from 12.72 to 11.64, making it significantly brighter and more visible to both space-based and terrestrial telescopes. However, due to the timing and duration of the event, no cover story was required, and since no personnel from established space agencies observed the anomaly, amnestics were deemed unnecessary.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION ANOMALOUS ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH DEPARTMENT \n\nFollowing yesterday's event (which we have cataloged as //Incident-8256-2// for simplicity’s sake), the apparent risk posed by **SCP-8256** has, at least in my view, increased drastically. Even if this thing miraculously never teleports, dematerializes, or whatever you want to call it again, the mere fact that it //can// do so should not be understated. We cannot contain an entire galaxy, for goodness' sake. And what if this thing were to manifest in a more dangerous location? We risk both the Foundation’s secrecy and public safety. If **SCP-8256** were to materialize near or even inside the Milky Way, the consequences would be catastrophic. For these reasons, I propose reclassifying the object to Keter and formally notifying both NASA and the ESA of the 8256 incident next month in █████.\n\n-- J Williams, head of Site 12's Astrophysics department, December 26th, 1990.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ File-8256 Revision: 14/01/91\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n----\n= **[[size 150%]]File-8256 Revision: 14/01/91[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 8256\n|clearance= 4\n|container-class= euclid\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= notice\n]]\n\n[[a href=\"*http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com/nivel-de-ameaca\" style=\"font-size: 18px; color: white; text-shadow: 1px 3px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); text-decoration: none;\"]]\n[[span_ style=\"display: inline-block; width: 100%; background-color: #ffe100; text-align: center; border: 1px none #000; margin: 1px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;\"]]\n**Threat Level:** Yellow\n[[/span]]\n[[/a]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**\n[[include component:image-block name=O5MEETING|caption=Meeting between O5-█, NASA  Administrator Richard H.

On August 27, 1999, at approximately 17:54, Foundation telescope //Lunar Watch// reported a sudden and significant increase in X-ray radiation from **SCP-8256**, with emissions reaching approximately 6–7 times its normal baseline rate for an estimated 49 seconds. Following this, **SCP-8256** permanently dematerialized from its known location near β Crucis in the **Crux** constellation, subsequently rematerializing at a new location, 0.2° east of τ[[footnote]]Tau[[/footnote]] Piscis Austrini in the **Piscis Austrinus** constellation. A follow-up investigation at Site-12 indicated that **SCP-8256**'s apparent magnitude had decreased from 11.64 to 12.66, and its distance from Earth had increased by approximately 40.1 million light-years. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ File-8256 Revision: 7/05/04\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n= **[[size 150%]]File-8256 Revision: 7/05/04[[/size]]**\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION ANOMALOUS ASTROPHYSICS RESEARCH DEPARTMENT \n\nAs you are aware we had another event concerning **SCP-8256** roughly 48 hours ago, I alongside the rest of the researchers here at Site-12 have been in panic mode, trying to figure out what is causing what we have deemed an Almada Event to occur. To my knowledge, O5-█ alongside ██████ are in an emergency meeting with both NASA and the ESA trying to figure out what has just happened. Due to the simple fact that we have no idea where the hell it is, and our telescopes have had no luck locating it, for now we are assuming **SCP-8256** has either completely vanished from reality, has dematerialised on the other side of the universe or is intentionally hiding from us and we have considered it lost.\n\n-- J Williams, head of Site 12's Astrophysics Department, May 7th, 2004.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n\n|item-number= 8256\n\n|clearance= 5\n\n|container-class= esoteric\n\n|secondary-class= uncontained\n\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/uncontained-icon.svg\n\n|disruption-class= amida\n\n|risk-class= notice\n\n]]\n\n[[a href=\"*http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com/nivel-de-ameaca\" style=\"font-size: 18px; color: white; text-shadow: 1px 3px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); text-decoration: none;\"]]\n[[span_ style=\"display: inline-block; width: 100%; background-color: #000000; text-align: center; border: 1px none #000; margin: 1px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px;\"]]\n**Threat Level:** Black\n[[/span]]\n[[/a]]\n\n**Revised Special Containment Procedures:**\nDue to the distance, size and nature of **SCP-8256** containment is currently considered impossible. Instead, Foundation efforts focus on disinformation campaigns in both the public and academic spheres, discrediting any reports of either 'disappearing' or 'reappearing' galaxies as either hoaxes or photography errors with parties involved being administered Class A amnestics. Foundation WebCrawler 8256, nicknamed the, \"//Galactic Hunter//\", is tasked with monitoring online astronomical and astrophotography groups and forums for references made to **SCP-8256**, with any media related to **SCP-8256** being deleted, with associated individuals administered an amnestic via an anti-memetic screen message. Foundation agents embedded in national space agencies and academic institutions are to discourage the study of sky where **SCP-8256** is located and are to manually edit **SCP-8256** out of any photographs or videos before publication of scientific material.\n\n**SCP-8256** is currently monitored weekly by Sr Researcher Sarah Broder at Site-12's astrophysics department, with any major visual or structural changes to be immediately reported to Site 12's site director. Should an Almada event occur O5-█, Dr Edwards, NASA, ESA and The China National Space Administration are to be immediately contacted, with a relevant cover story released to the public if required.\n\n**Revised Description:**\nSCP-8256 is an intermediate spiral galaxy, measuring approximately 24,000ly across and 2000ly in thickness, currently located an unknown distance from Earth. The object last had an Apparent magnitude of 12.66 with no other apparent anomalous physical characteristics that would set it apart from other non-anomalous spiral galaxies typically found in nature. SCP-8256 consists of four massive spiral arms. predominantly blue, pink, and white, surrounding a bright galactic core with an estimate number of 100 billion stars (±5 billion) . At its centre lies a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 2.5 million solar masses.\n\nSCP-8256's primary anomalous property is that no biological organism is capable of viewing it through a telescope, binoculars or any other optical instrument, regardless of the optical size of the instrument, (see experiment logs). Instead observers will simply see a regular patch of sky, filled with an average amount of stars. However, this effect does not extend to photographs or videos of SCP-8256 with viewers initially able to view the object for 5 - 10 seconds, until SCP-8256's second primary anomalous effect will manifest. This will cause the individual (hereby designated SCP-8256-A), to become unable to view any photos or videos of SCP-8256, for a certain period of time.4 Describing that these appear blurry, nonsensical or simply aren't visible and appear as either blank white or black. Notably, this perceptual anomaly is not universal. Unaffected observers can view images and footage of SCP-8256 without issue, and written descriptions, data, and measurements related to SCP-8256 remain legible to all individuals, including SCP-8256-A.\n\nThe third anomalous property of SCP-8256, is that individuals who has observed SCP-8256 will slowly over a period of between 30 minutes and 2 hours forget the physical description of the object, nor will they be able to describe what SCP-8256 looks like. However, this does not affect data or information of SCP-8256, as individuals will still be able to recall how large the galaxy is, amount of stars or other numerical values.\n\n**Almada Events:**\nDue to reasons currently unknown **SCP-8256** is capable of spontaneous dematerialization and rematerialization in space, often moving 10's of millions of light years instantly. These events, are proceeded by a sudden increase in X-ray radiation emissions from **SCP-8256** for 49 - 120 seconds. Both these events and the new location of **SCP-8256** appear to be random, (refer to both File-8256 Revision: 26/12/90 and File-8256 Revision: 28/08/99), with apparent pattern or visible related variables between manifestations. Subsequent investigation of regions affected by Almada events utilizing [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2154 SCP-2154] has revealed a higher amount of X-ray, microwave and infrared radiation, as well as a noticeable decrease of stars and an increase of nebulous activity.

At 23:27 on May 5, 2004, **SCP-8256** permanently dematerialized from its known location near τ Piscis Austrini in the **Piscis Austrinus** constellation, relocating to an as-yet unknown location. Similar to previous Almada events, a sudden, significant increase in X-ray radiation from the region of **SCP-8256** was detected for 120 seconds before the event. A subsequent investigation by the ESA and the Foundation into the τ Piscis Austrini region revealed elevated levels of X-ray, microwave, and infrared radiation.\n\nDue to a major astronomy event occurring at the time, an estimated 30,000 civilians witnessed and photographed both Incident-8256-4 and **SCP-8256**, with a further 750,000 people becoming aware of the event online in numerous astronomy and astrophotography groups. In response, a cover story involving a large-scale computer glitch and deliberate media manipulation by a troll group was disseminated. All direct witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics, and all online material was expunged from the internet, with the object being both reclassified from Keter to Uncontained and it's threat level being classified to Black. \n\nFollowing the aftermath of Incident-8256-4 and the threat **SCP-8256** posed to both normalcy and Foundation secrecy, Foundation WebCrawler-8256, nicknamed \"//Galactic Hunter//\", was developed and deployed. Its purpose is to monitor media for references to **SCP-8256** and to track reports of disappearing or reappearing galaxies, aiding both in suppressing public awareness of **SCP-8256** and in determining its new location upon its next manifestation.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident-8256-5\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n----\n= **[[size 150%]]Incident-8256-5[[/size]]**\n\nIncident-8256-5 refers to an event involving **SCP-8256** and subsequently the current location of **SCP-8256**. At 07:17 on March 22, 2012, Foundation telescope, //Lunar Watch//, detected that **SCP-8256** rematerialized approximately 0.4° north-east of γ Columbae in the Columba constellation, (116mly away from the Earth). Unlike previous manifestations a large amount of X-ray radiation was detected //before// manifestation, (approximately 4 times the baseline rate). However, unlike previous Almada events, both the region surrounding **SCP-8256** and the object it's self has had an ongoing above normal amount of X-ray radiation,(approximately 2 - 2.5 times the baseline rate). An investigation into this has been launched to determine both the effects on the surrounding space and the threat posed to Earth. \n\nIn response to Incident-8256-5, a secondary media cover story was issued, citing the phenomenon as the result of an unprecedented event involving an unknown X-ray emission source. Similar to previous incidents, all direct witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics, and all online material relating to the incident was scrubbed from public access. \n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 2004meeting.jpeg\n> **Name:** National Space Council's Users' Advisory Group Meeting (NHQ202302230023)\n> **Author:** NASA HQ PHOTO\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Space_Council%27s_Users%27_Advisory_Group_Meeting_(NHQ202302230023).jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** AlmadaEvent.jpeg\n> **Name:** Quasar host galaxy (opo9416b)\n> **Author:** Dr. John Hutchings\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Quasar_host_galaxy_(opo9416b).jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** Andromeda_constellation_map.jpeg\n> **Name:** Andromeda constellation map mk\n> **Author:** Kxx\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andromeda_constellation_map_mk.svg]\n\n> **Filename:** LunarWatchSpaceTelescope.jpeg\n> **Name:** Andromeda constellation map mk\n> **Author:** Kxx\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andromeda_constellation_map_mk.svg]\n\n> **Filename:** NGC_3982_galaxy_hubble.jpeg\n> **Name:** NGC 3982 galaxy hubble\n> **Author:** NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NGC_3982_galaxy_hubble.jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** O5MEETING.jpeg\n> **Name:** STS-2 Engle Truly press conference 2\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:STS-2_Engle_Truly_press_conference_2.jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** Piscis_Austrinus_constellation_map.png\n> **Name:** Piscis Austrinus constellation map\n> **Author:** Torsten Bronger, Kxx\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Piscis_Austrinus_constellation_map.svg]\n\n> **Filename:** SCPSTARLOCATION.png\n> **Name:** Columba constellation map\n> **Author:** Torsten Bronger, Kxx\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Columba_constellation_map.svg]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8255]]] | SCP-8256 | [[[SCP-8257]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
