The doors leading into the building itself have been padlocked. A single guard is to be stationed nearby at all times to ensure no individuals enter SCP-7472.\n\nBy order of the Overseer Council, entry into the structure is forbidden.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7472 is an eight-floor block of flats located in Poznań, Poland. Access into the building -- including air vents, water pipes, and other such structures -- has been entirely blocked off, save for a single narrow corridor that connects SCP-7472's interior with the outside world. Above the door leading into the building through the aforementioned corridor hangs a small metal placard that reads \"SCP Foundation Department of Hibernation.\" No such Department has ever been found to exist.\n\n[[/==]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"The remainder of this file has been locked by O5 order.\" hide=\"Lock Overridden\"]]\n\n[[==]]\n\nThe interior of SCP-7472 consists of eight ascending levels, structurally identical to neighboring (non-anomalous) apartment buildings. SCP-7472 differs from these buildings in its interior; all structural elements which would normally be present in a building of this type (doors, stairs, functioning windows, etc.) have been removed. Most floors are bare concrete with sheet metal covering the windows. In place of typical rooms, furnishings, and appliances, SCP-7472 contains the following:\n\n* Eight large and empty containers on every floor. Four are slightly damp, four are dry.\n * All containers are connected via pipes to a structure located deeper within SCP-7472. Its location and purpose are indeterminate.\n* Human bones (lightly gnawed).\n* An advanced air filtration system spanning all floors.\n* One elevator. Although the elevator has not been modified, the walls of the elevator shaft have been removed.\n * The lift has remained perpetually active for as long as the Foundation has been aware of it. Attempts to stop the elevator to further research SCP-7472's interior have been unsuccessful.\n* Approximately 2 million corpses belonging to red squirrels (//Sciurus vulgaris//). Corpses are spread randomly across all floors.\n * The source of these corpses and the reason none of them have decayed remain unknown.\n\n _\n _\n\n**Addendum 7472-1:** Following several months of testing, the Foundation has stopped SCP-7472's elevator. Entry into the lift revealed an incomplete human skeleton, a pen, a notebook, and an unidentified electronic device. The first page of the notebook was transcribed as well as possible: \n\n[[div class=\"paper\" style=\"text-align:left;\"]]\ncan i kill thern [[span class=\"note\"]][sic][[/span]]\n\ncan i throw them all in hole [[span class=\"note\"]][sic][[/span]]\n__excavate__ hole, fill with food/water\ndoes that count\n\nsquirrelmaxxing [[span class=\"note\"]][sic, possible [[[old-adytite-language|Ämärangnä language]]] connection?][[/span]]\n\naverage volume = 0.002 m^^3^^\n0.003 m^^3^^ just to be safe\n\nwholo bluck is like [[span class=\"note\"]][sic, Sarkic name?][[/span]]\n20ish by 30ish by 20ish\n12.000 meters cubed \n-20% for walls + elevator\nminus 25% for everyting mentioned befure [[span class=\"note\"]][sic][[/span]]\n7200\n\n2.400.000 squirrels\n120.000.000 dollars\nright so\n1000 dollars per citizen\nplus hotel costs = 119.846.000 dollars\nminus appliances\n@@=           @@ [[span class=\"note\"]][writing/number indiscernible, possible Orokian Sarkic battle runes?

With the exception of the padlocked door leading into SCP-7472, this tunnel is the building's only entrance / exit.\n\n _\n _\n\n**Addendum 7472-2:** Foundation technicians have successfully opened the electronic device. It contained most of a commercially-available //Raspberry Pi Zero W// starter kit, one leaf, four pine needles, and several segments of copper wiring. While Foundation technicians were unable to activate the device before or after opening it, they were able to access the device's micro-SD. It contains several files of non-functioning code and a single rich text file encoding using a hitherto unknown method.\n\n[/scp-7472/offset/2 Attempts to read this file are ongoing].\n\n[[/==]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@",
