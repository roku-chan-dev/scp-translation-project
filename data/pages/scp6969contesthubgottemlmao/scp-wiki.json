In that time, though, each of us have grown as a person and had new experiences, friends, enemies, and more. But occasionally, it's nice to look back at our roots and admire them. Thus, for this contest, we're going to be turning back the clock and becoming what we all once were: **absolute degenerates**.\n\n+++ Congratulations to [[*user djkaktus]] for winning the SCP-6000 slot with his piece [[span style=\"color: #b01;\"]]Trump v.
