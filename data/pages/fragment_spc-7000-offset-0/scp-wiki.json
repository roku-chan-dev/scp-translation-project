Though all failed, Operational Command grew increasingly concerned by the pattern of attempts.  Given the secretive nature of the Center’s forces at the MFT level, Command came to the understandable conclusion that selachian espionage was to blame.  Security was tightened up, and SPC-7000 was treated as a VIP asset when not on active duty with several layers of defenses arrayed around him at all times.  \n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"spc_memo\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **Mission Transcript Operation Θ-7000-10**\n//30 October, 2022// \n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n**Situation**: Attack on the North Pacific American Deepwell Defense Station[[footnote]]A former oil rig converted to permanent fortress and mobilization bases for MFT forces.[[/footnote]] by selachian forces seemingly mutated by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spc-2191 | SPC-2191]]], including a thick layer of chitin along the length of their bodies, making them extremely resistant to normal pugilism techniques.[[footnote]]Requiring advanced augmentation devices such as punction rifle gloves and piston driven knuckle enhancements.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Intervention**: SPC-7000 and the MFT forces repelled the main selachian force while the Station’s defense personnel were able to fight off the limited numbers of hostile entities not engaged in pugilistic confrontations in the water.\n\n**Outcome**: The Station defenses held and the entire force of selachians were prevented from causing lasting damage.

After the arrival of the reinforcements, Centre personnel were able to push back against the selachians. \n\nAfter nearly three hours of fighting, over six hundred selachians were KIA and the rest retreated.  Personnel casualties were significant, but the reinforcements and MFT Theta-7000 were key to preventing a bigger disaster.
