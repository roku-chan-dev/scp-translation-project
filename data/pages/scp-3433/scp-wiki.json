Each painting is to be encased in a glass container, approximately 127 cm x 127 cm x 8 cm. Currently, all paintings are on sale on an online site owned by the SCP Foundation at www.scp█████████.com, and are being constantly purchased and sold in rotation every 3 hours between 20 designated employees through an AI system programmed to purchase and sell items. Constant monitoring of this AI system is required at all times.\n\nIf this AI system fails, the 20 designated employees will be immediately alerted, with at least 7 employees required to report in (this number may change as new paintings related to SCP-3433 are discovered) to www.scp█████████.com, manually purchasing and selling the paintings until the AI system is recovered. All designated employees involved in this manual labor will be excused from their current jobs until further notice. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3433 is a social phenomenon related to a series of paintings by Andy Warhol from 1968-1987, created in \"The Factory\"[[footnote]]Andy Warhol's New York City studio.[[/footnote]] at 33 Union Square West, Manhattan, New York. It is currently unknown how many works related to SCP-3433 exist at this time. Currently, 3 paintings related to SCP-3433 have been claimed to exist, each designated as SCP-3433-n, but only 2 of these 3 have been confirmed as artwork related to SCP-3433.\n\nThe artwork related to SCP-3433 was distributed across the United States of America through several members of the \"Warhol Superstars\"[[footnote]]A clique of personalities designated in New York City and promoted by Andy Warhol.[[/footnote]], who were each reportedly gifted an artwork of SCP-3433 by Andy Warhol himself. Following this, the works of SCP-3433 were distributed to various customers and museums. At this time, only 1 of these \"Warhol Superstars\" has been identified and apprehended for further interrogation.\n\nEach artwork related to SCP-3433 allows the current owner (person or institution) of SCP-3433-n, now classified as SCP-3433-n-n, to experience an event or phenomenon within the next 24 hours that results in them receiving approximately 14-15 days of widespread media attention. During this time, all sources of media, including radio, television, internet, and paper, will turn their focus to the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n. Subjects labelled as SCP-3433-n-n are unaffected further by SCP-3433.\n\nFollowing the aforementioned 14-15 days, SCP-3433-n-n experiences a series of events that continue to occur as long as SCP-3433-n-n maintains ownership over SCP-3433-n.\n\n> **1.** //(1-2 days)// SCP-3433-n-n experiences an increasing attachment to SCP-3433-n. This attachment will increase over time, with SCP-3433-n-n becoming visibly distressed if others take interest in SCP-3433-n. This distress has been seen to evolve into violent outbursts against those who attempt to purchase or remove SCP-3433-n. \n> \n> **2.** //(3-5 days)// All public records (written and visual) of SCP-3433-n-n are removed or destroyed in both physical and digital forms through unknown means. Private possessions containing SCP-3433-n-n's information appear unaffected.\n> \n> **3.** //(6-10 days)// The memories of those who are aware of SCP-3433-n-n's existence and the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n appear to be affected, being unable to recall the events or even basic information on SCP-3433-n-n (including name, age, gender, etc.).\n> \n> **4.** //(10-20 days)// All memories (involving SCP-3433-n-n) of those aware of SCP-3433-n-n's existence and the events surrounding SCP-3433-n-n have all been either modified or erased. Even SCP-3433-n-n's closest relatives and significant other are unable to recognize SCP-3433-n-n. New memories of SCP-3433-n-n are unable to be created, but new records are able to be produced. [[footnote]]As a result, scientists investigating SCP-3433 are required to overview all data prior to starting investigations each day, as they are unable to recall previously collected data on SCP-3433-n-n.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **5:** //(20-25 days)// The ability to notice or visualize SCP-3433-n-n becomes increasingly difficult for others, taking approximately 7-10 minutes for an individual to even acknowledge SCP-3433-n-n. SCP-3433-n-n has visible difficulty in physically interacting with its surroundings and other objects [Data indicates that SCP-3433-n-n in this state appears to exhibit traits classified as \"intangibility\"].\n> \n> **6:** //(25+ days)// [UNCONFIRMED] At this time, SCP-3433-n-n is unable to be located through any means. \n\nThese effects appear to be permanent, but these effects cease to affect SCP-3433-n-n any further when SCP-3433-n-n sells or gives SCP-3433-n to another owner. If SCP-3433-n-n is an institution (e.g. Museum), then all employees and personnel related to the institution, as well as the structure itself are affected by the effects of SCP-3433.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS: SCP/3433/files-code-Warhol/1-3\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n__**SCP-3433-1**__\n> **Title:** \"The Star\" \n> **Discovered:** October 23, 1999 \n> **Location:** Tallahassee, Florida\n> **Incident 1:** ███████ ████ (SCP-3433-1a) was in possession of SCP-3433-1 [approx. 36 days] and has been apprehended for further questioning. SCP-3433-1a, an aspiring actor, claims to have gained nationwide fame after being involved in a sex tape scandal with fellow actor █████ ██████. Both reputations were allegedly ruined by the scandal and other surrounding controversies that arose due to the immediate and widespread media coverage of the events.\n> \n> At this time, no public/government record of SCP-3433-1a has been able to be found. No public records or witnesses of the events that SCP-3433-1a claims have been found. SCP-3433-1a has provided proof of the sex tape itself on SCP-3433-1a's video camera. Further attempts to share or copy this tape has proved unsuccessful due to unknown reasons.\n\n__**SCP-3433-2**__\n> **Title:** \"Skull 158\"\n> **Discovered:** February 15, 2004 \n> **Location:** New York City, New York\n> **Incident 2:** [MISSING] █████ ███████ (SCP-3433-2a) was in possession of SCP-3433-2 [approx. 40 days] and had been apprehended for further questioning. SCP-3433-2a claims to have gained nationwide fame after saving the lives of 5 women who had been kidnapped by ████ █████, having followed ████ █████ after witnessing him kidnap a woman from the streets.\n> \n> At this time, no public/government record of SCP-3433-2a has been able to be found. No public records or witnesses of the events that SCP-3433-2a claims have been found. The 5 women SCP-3433-2a cites in relation to the events of SCP-3433-2 all deny the events. Despite this, SCP-3433-2a has provided photographic evidence of the events, all of which the 5 women continue to deny. \n> \n> After apprehending SCP-3433-2a for 6 days, during which SCP-3433-2a continued to hold ownership over SCP-3433-2 for approximately 40 days, SCP-3433-2a was reported missing from containment. At this time, SCP-3433-2a has been unable to be located.\n> \n> **IF ANY PERSONNEL HAS ANY INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF SCP-3433-2a, REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO THE SCP FOUNDATION**\n\n__**SCP-3433-3** [UNCONFIRMED]__\n> **Title:** \"The Shadow\"\n> **Discovered:** July 6, 2010 \n> **Location:** Pasadena, California\n> **Incident 3:** [MISSING] The ███████ Museum of the Arts (SCP-3433-3a) was reportedly in possession of SCP-3433-3 [approx. UNKNOWN], as indicated by several photographs from ████ █████. At this time, the incident caused by SCP-3433 in relation to SCP-3433-3a has been unable to be identified, due to a lack of witnesses. The existence of SCP-3433-3a was discovered through the recovery of SCP-3433-3 and photographic evidence indicating SCP-3433-3a's prior existence.\n> \n> At this time, no public/government record of SCP-3433-3a nor any of its employees has been able to be found. SCP-3433-3-1 itself has been unable to be located, with its alleged location being an empty lot, approximately 400,000 square feet, in the city. All identified employees of SCP-3433-3a are currently missing. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS: SCP/3433/files-code-Warhol/interview-superstar-2\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** [Warhol Superstar-2]\n> \n> **Interviewer:** [Dr. ███████ █████]\n> \n> **Note:** [The individual interviewed here is designated as \"Warhol Superstar-2\" in order to correlate between the individual and SCP-3433-2. To further protect the identities of these individuals, they will be addressed as \"Mr. Superstar\" or \"Ms. Superstar\" as requested. A similar procedure will be followed for further apprehended \"Warhol Superstars\".]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** So, Mr. Superstar. You're the original owner of SCP-3433-3?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** You mean \"The Shadow\"?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** Yes, that's right. Might I ask, when did SCP-3433-3 come into your possession exactly?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Oh, I suppose Andy gave it to me uh... maybe 1972? '73?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** Andy Warhol, is it? That is, the artist, if I am correct?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** That's right.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** Are you aware of the alleged effects that this painting has on its owners?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** What? You mean the fifteen minutes of fame?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** I beg your pardon?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** You know, \"in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes\"[[footnote]]Andy Warhol was quoted to have said \"in the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes\".[[/footnote]]. That whole thing. After that issue with Valerie[[footnote]]Valerie Solanas, a American radical feminist and author known for writing the SCUM Manifesto. Solanas attempted to assassinate Andy Warhol on 4 June, 1968.[[/footnote]] around '68, he went on and on about it for awhile. Kept him up for ages. I don't remember much else, though. I left the \"Factory\" around '73, and Andy gave me \"The Shadow\" just around then. I'm pretty sure he gave \"Viva\" one too, not sure.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** \"Viva?\" Who else has access to these paintings?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Well, as far as I can tell, a couple other of us got one. Candy had one after '72. The last time I talked to Ultra Violet, maybe around '79? I think she mentioned about a painting. Who knows? There could be more out there. Last time I saw Andy, he just kept going.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** [//scribbling//] \"Ultra Violet,\" was it? I see... Would you mind explaining what you mean by, \"kept going?\"\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Well uh... he did it, didn't he, doctor? It worked.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** I'm sorry? What exactly worked?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Our fifteen minutes. We all get our fifteen minutes of fame. After that, we have to move on. You know, make room for everyone else. Andy wanted us to help it get started. I had my fifteen back around '74. God, I still remember those days... but in the end, I had to move on like the rest. Just like Andy wanted us to. [//laughs//]\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** The fifteen minutes of fame? No, no, I understand the concept, but if you could just explain how the paintings work, I'm sure this can be much more convenient for the both of us.\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Well, that's alright. I didn't expect you to understand. Andy understood this all better than any of us. The best way I can explain it, is that all of us have a reason to exist, and Andy gave us purpose. You get your fifteen minutes. Then you have to move on, one way or another. You can't hold onto that fame forever, no matter how precious it is to you. You have to let go, or the world moves on without you. It leaves you behind. \n> \n> //Warhol-Superstar-2 falls silent//\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** [//sighs//] The world forgets you.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** What does that even -- I'm sorry, I don't seem to understand what you mean.  Perhaps you could explain to me just exactly how the paintings work?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** [//laughs//] Oh please, doctor. Don't try to understand Andy. I don't think any of us really did. Just find your fifteen minutes with the rest of us, and you'll come to accept it as we all have... \n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** Is there any way you could be any clearer?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** How much clearer can I be, doctor? Our time is running short. I do hope you get your fifteen minutes soon enough doctor, but just remember... [//laughs//] all you get is fifteen minutes. Don't hang on for too long, doctor. \n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** And just what are you implying?\n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I'd hate to forget you. I'd hate for everyone to forget such an interesting face.  \n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** I have a family who loves me. I have colleagues who have stood beside my work for decades. I don't think I would be so easily forgotten. \n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Do you think you're any more special than the rest of them? Are you the only person to have a family? Are you the only person to have peers to work beside them? The all-so memorable Dr. ███████ █████[[footnote]]Upon further examination, it is unknown how Warhol-Superstar-2 was aware of Dr. ███████ █████'s identity.[[/footnote]]? It's people like you that clings onto their fifteen minutes. And for good measure.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** Alright, [//sighs//] thank you for your cooperation. This has been... enlightening, I suppose. This will be all for today. \n> \n> //Interviewer rises to leave//\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ █████:** One last thing. Andy Warhol might have called you a \"superstar\", but to me, you're nothing more than another face in the crowd. \n> \n> **Warhol-Superstar-2:** Of course I am, doctor. That's the point.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**ATTENTION!
