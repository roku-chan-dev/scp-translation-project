Patches of dark clouds were slowly breaking away, allowing him to see the baby blue sky that was underneath. He felt his shoulders slacken before looking down at the penny in his hand. He turned it through his fingers a couple of times and let loose a sigh. \n\n\"What's with the long face dude?\" John asked as he handed Allen a cone, \"I know the movie was shit, but that's no reason to be a sad sack. Just do what a normal person does and rant about it online for 12 hours while strangers read your mental break down about a shitty remake no one cares about.\"\n\nAllen chuckled and shook his head.\n\n\"No, it's not about that. It's just that, goddamnit, you were right.\"\n\n\"About what? Like me saying that Alligator 3: Revenge of the Caiman was gonna a terrible movie or...?\" \n\n\"The penny. You were right about it.\" Allen muttered, just barely loud enough for John to hear.\n\n\"Oh. Well, what's bothering you right now?\"\n\n\"Well, just my decision making, in general.\"\n\n\"What decision are you having troubling making now?\"\n\nA quiet murmur slipped past Allen's lips and John leaned in slightly.\n\n\"I can't hear you when you're that quiet.\"\n\n\"I mean just, god. It's kinda embarrassing now that I think about it.\"\n\n\"What, you want me to give you a kiss?\" John teased a small smile playing on his face. Allen's head tucked into his chest ever so slightly and John let loose a small chuckle.\n\n\"Hey getting cooties from your boyfriend is nothing to be embarrassed by.\"\n\nAllen only tucked his head deeper into his chest before muttering, a muffled 'shut up'.\n\n\"Nah, I'd rather have you do that.\"\n\nAllen whipped up his head and rolled his eyes at the cliche remark.\n\n\"Psh, really? You don't have anything else? I'm ashamed.\"\n\n\"Yeah so am I. But you know what they say, even masters fail at their craft.\"\n\n\"Like hell you're a master at anything.\"\n\n\"I have been told I am a master of kissing.\" John teased while leaning in, \"but alas, you'd have to kiss me and find out.\"\n\nAfter John's last statement, Allen felt his heart drop. His skin heated up and he just realized how close they actually were. His heart picked up its speed and his brain switched into hyperdrive. It was scattering inside of his skull thinking about his options that he couldn't make. His hands kept fiddling with the penny hoping that somehow it would show hi-\n\nJohn set his hand on Allen's, breaking his line of thought. \n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\nJohn watched him with concerned eyes.\n\n\"Allen?\"\n\nAllen watched his eyes as the childish twinkle slowly left replaced by a soft concern.\n\n\"Did I make you uncomfortable?\"\n\n\"No, I'm fine,\" Allen said, \"just was a bit nervous.\" \n\n\"Alright, you had me scared for a second.\"\n\n\"Aww, barely even a week of dating and you're already going soft?\" \n\n\"Ha, no, I've probably been going soft for longer.\"\n\nSilence fell over them as they watched the park. Pigeons would bother eating couples, the bees would buzz around bushes, and the butterflies danced around flower beds. Children squealed in joy as they played with one another and the parents laughed as they watched their funny movements. \n\nAfter a time of watching, Allen settled his hand on top of John's. A hum came from John as he intertwined their fingers. \n\nA soft blush came across Allen's face as he watched the ground\n\n\"John?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I think, I'm gonna make a decision.” Allen’s head slightly lifted and turned to John with a smile across his face.\n\n\"Without that penny?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" \n\n\"And what decision would that be?\"\n\n\"Well, I think I'm gonna kiss a cootie-infected, self-proclaimed kissing master.\" Allen said in his best sassy tone, although it ended in more of a squeak as he made eye contact with John.\n\n\"Really?\" John asked as he turned to Allen.\n\n\"Ye-yeah,\" Allen whispered as he tipped his head up towards John. Slowly he moved towards him closing the gap between them. For a second he stayed there, savoring his first kiss before pulling away. After a second John's face turned to mock horror.\n\n\"Oh no!” John said in a shrill tone as he brought his hand up to his forehead.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, you now have cooties!\" John exclaimed before they both burst out into laughter.\n\n\"God, we're children, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we are.\"\n\nAfter a few minutes their laughter turned to silence.\n\n\"So, now that you know you can make a decision on your own, what are you gonna do with that penny?\"\n\nAllen's eyes glanced at John before looking at the fountain behind them. \n\n\"I don't know, there's not a lot it can really do.\"\n\n\"Eh, there's somethings,\" John said glancing off in the distance.\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Well if you get enough you could make a paperweight, you could put it in one of those take-a-penny things, or my personal favorite, you could throw it in a fountain and get a wish.” \n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You believe in fountain wishes more than my lucky penny?\"\n\n\"I mean, my fountain wishes don't pick boring classes.\"\n\n\"... I guess that’s a fair point.\" Allen turned to face the fountain, and the water splashed at his face. He sighed before looking down at the glistening water, taking note of all of the drowned coins underneath its surface. He trembled as he placed the coin on his thumb, ready to flip it for the final time. He took in several more deep breaths before a soft jingle from behind his back tore his eyes away.\n\nA small smile passed over his face as John approached quarter in hand. \n\n\"I know it's no lucky penny, but it's the closest I got.\" \n\nAllen smiled as he positioned his coin on the top of his thumb.\n\n\"Are you ready to make a wish?\"\n\n[[collapsible show=\" \"Yeah.\" \" hide=\" plop. \"]]\n> **Item Description:** A penny which, when flipped, will always land \"heads up\".\n> **Date of Recovery:** ██-██-████\n> **Location of Recovery:** ████, ███████\n> **Current Status:** Shipped off to permanent storage.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
