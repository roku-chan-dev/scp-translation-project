But Lillian and Ilse were absolute terrors at this, as they were at any act susceptible to sudden acts of mental brilliance, and that presented an opening. -- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/testing-the-margins Testing The Margins ] by [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n[[=image 20220308.jpg]]\n\n[[=image reddit2.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image postit.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:we-will-meet-in-another-life-but-in-this-one-i-ll-resort/coghazcarol.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:we-will-meet-in-another-life-but-in-this-one-i-ll-resort/entj.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image bigger.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image doodles.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:we-will-meet-in-another-life-but-in-this-one-i-ll-resort/43girlsnight.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image mommymilkersin2postcodes.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image dolltemplate.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image putourheads.jpeg]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+ 2023\n[[/=]]\n\n> You're sitting on a park bench admiring the sights, sounds, and smells of Spring.\n\n> Then you feel something change in the air.

I picked your ethnicity, as a joke, for a friend.\" You poke her in the chest, and she burps lightly. \"I was like the second person ever to try drawing you, and half the people on Reddit who know you exist know because of me. I whined like a puppy who wants to go for a walk over and over again until the people who write the words agreed to write more words about you, and all those words are a little bit because of me, too, about what I wanted to know, about what I wanted to see. I've asked questions about you that didn't have answers until I asked the questions, so the questions caused the answers, and they made you more real, and half the time I think the answers were targeted to what I wanted them to be, so it was me making you more real. When people write about you, and they picture you, they're picturing my pictures. Even the ones who have pictures of their own. Even the one who made the first picture. I'm the reason people know your eyes are blue even though that confusing bit in 'Meanwhile, in Australia' makes it sound like they might be green. I'm the reason people know your hair is white even though your hair was red in like fifty tales. I'm the reason you know what Uno is. I like everything about you, even the things that suck. You barely existed when I found you, but I loved what was there, so I put other things that I love in there, and it made you exist more. If I didn't clap back about you, you wouldn't be the main character. You're the main character because my feedback says it's okay for you to be the main character.\" -- [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-woman-in-the-boxes The Woman In The Boxes ] by [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n[[=image lilly_Restored.jpeg]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:we-will-meet-in-another-life-but-in-this-one-i-ll-resort/deskbuddy.jpg]]\n\n[[=image pencil.png]]\n\n[[=image the.png]]\n\n------\n> You open the door. \n\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/twitb-fanart/Untitled191_20240727022755.jpeg]]",
