The corpse itself is effectively affixed to the couch supporting it. Of particular note is its position; its right hand holds a shot glass under SCP-2755's mouth. Discharging from the mouth at 0.5 mL/hour is isopropyl alcohol, which drips into the shot glass. When overfilled, and the alcohol reaches a suitable material, most additional alcohol evaporates. The remaining alcohol proceeds to cover the material's surface and etches a random pun from one of the writer's books, as well as a typically cynical addition. See Addendum for transcripts. \n\n__**Addendum A: Transcript of Etchings**__\n> Why did the cow not want to go to school? Because it had recently mooved! \n> \n> ...

I'm so, so sorry. Forgive me.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2754]]] | SCP-2755 | [[[SCP-2756]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
