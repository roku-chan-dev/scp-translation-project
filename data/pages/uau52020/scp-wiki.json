What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[new-buteo-series-mechanical-exoskeleton|Your New Buteo Series Mechanical Exoskeleton!]]] and the Anderson format\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[The Deniers]]] and the A Non-Prophet Organization series\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's topic.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSAPHIR/SAPPHIRE is one of the few foreign branch GoIs to make it on the wiki. But has it made it big?\n\n[[[non-prophet-organization-hub|A Non-Prophet Organization]]] is an -EN original series exploring a mass conflict between SAPHIR and the anomalous religious world. It was also second place in the International Groups of Interest Competition of 2019, but unlike fellow runner-ups Samsara and End of Death, ANPO never quite hit the mainstream. Maybe that's because it's not finished, but even what's there is of pretty high quality.\n\nPart of IntCon19 was the idea of cross-cultural reimagining. ANPO took a GoI best known for [[[SCP-281-FR|unflattening the world]]] and put them to work in an all-out war. The set-up, the structuring, all the history, that's all done. All you need to know is that there's trouble brewing on the horizon.\n\nGet ready for a fight.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** ANPO //invented// the SAPHIR format. Why not write another?\n* **For artists:** Draw a scene from [[[Chimes Broken]]].",
