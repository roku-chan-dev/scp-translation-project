While the initial incident was handled by local authorities, the following camera footage was provided to Foundation officials several months afterward.\n----\n\n{{**@@[21:29 - BEGIN LOG]@@**}}\n\n{{**[SOURCE: Briarwood Apartments official security system]**}}\n\n//Camera perspective overlooks Hallway 1B. Ray Anderson arrives upwards from the hallway's sole staircase. He is holding a bouquet of mixed flowers in both hands.//\n\n//After nearly a minute, Anderson turns left from Hallway 1B and into Hallway 1E. Camera perspective changes to view another corner of the complex. Anderson stops after turning the corner to recuperate and breathe. He is visibly distressed, wiping sweat from his brow before continuing through the hallway.//\n\n//Anderson stops midway through Hallway 3E as Door 113 opens. An older woman steps out carrying food items and additional assortments. They converse briefly before Anderson disengages conversation. He rubs his left shoulder as the two leave.//\n\n//Anderson takes another left turn and continues walking.//\n\n{{**[SOURCE: Private home security devices belonging to Amanda Anderson]**}}\n\n//Camera perspective changes once more to Door 119’s home security doorbell camera. Anderson stands directly in front of the doorbell. He stares at the camera momentarily before ringing.//\n\n//Nobody comes to greet Anderson. He presses the button again.//\n\n//Anderson paces at the door. He waits for several minutes before checking his nearby vicinity. After confirming that he is alone, Anderson turns the doorknob. The door is unlocked.//\n\n//Camera feed changes to view the dark interior of Apartment 119 via home security devices. Anderson quietly makes his way inside from the front door, touching along the left wall to presumably locate a nearby light switch. He is successful, activating a ceiling fan light hanging above the living room, which is noticeably clean.//\n\n//Anderson speaks to determine if anyone is inside the residence, but nobody comes. After searching the Living Room and nearby Dining Room, he crosses an opening to access the kitchen. Anderson notices a line of ants spanning the tile floor and some used medical equipment.//\n\n//Anderson then searches the kitchen and locates nothing of interest. He places the bouquet on a nearby countertop and exits to the hallway.//\n\n//Anderson walks towards a closed door along the hallway. He knocks, announcing himself, before entering the room. The camera perspective changes again to view the interior of a bedroom.//\n\n//Anderson enters the bedroom to see a corpse laying atop a black mound on the bed. Several opened pill bottles containing a mix of over-the-counter medications and prescribed heart medication are also present. Miscellaneous wiring and other equipment is connecting to the corpse, feeding into a monitor display reading “ERROR!” The black amalgamation underneath the corpse shifts. Anderson yells. It squirms. Black ants can be seen exiting the corpse from its mouth, tear ducts, ears, and crotch, crawling along medical equipment and the bed frame. Several ants are carrying eggs or larvae.//\n\n//Anderson runs out of the room. The corpse’s skin and muscles begins to deflate and deform. Ants continue escaping from open orifices, occasionally tunneling out open veins and rupturing the skin from the inside.//\n\n//The bugs disperse into open crevices along the floor and walls as authorities arrive on-scene.//\n\n**{{@@[22:04 - END LOG]@@}}**\n----\n**Afterword:** Local and Foundation authorities would later locate Amanda Anderson, age 45, deceased in her bedroom. Cause of death was determined to be sudden heart failure, which occurred before Ray Anderson’s arrival.\n\nFoundation personnel were not aware of SCP-7455’s existence prior to this recording.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**From:** Charles Wadeson (c.wadeson@psite-188.scp)\n**To:** Jason Ridely (j.ridely@05overwatch.scp)\n@<     >@**CC:** SCP-7455 Research Team (7455@psite-188.scp);\n**Subject:** RE:RE:RE:RE: Database Alarm/Documentation Update (##red|IMPORTANT!##)\n----\nHello.\n\nSorry for not replying.
