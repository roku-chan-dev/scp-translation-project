This aquarium is to be fitted with environmental monitoring equipment and an automatic feeding system to provide sustenance at regular intervals. \n\nDue to the inconsistency of observed capabilities, personnel are to exhibit caution when handling SCP-6549. Employees should wear protective eye shielding, padded gloves, and a Kevlar vest to mitigate any potential injury that may occur when in close proximity to the anomaly. At no time should SCP-6549 be left unattended and outside of its habitat with any less than two security personnel present.

Aside from the extreme anachronism, SCP-6549 is biologically non-anomalous, based on predictions made from fossil records; the entity possesses compound eyes capable of 360Â° vision, a soft, pre-chitinous exoskeleton, two barbed frontal appendages, and a series of synchronized, undulating flaps on both sides for locomotion.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=1000\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=60%\n|url=https://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/psychokriller/anom.gif\n|alt=alt|alt-text=Vibe check\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-6549's locomotive synchrony, which aligns with predictive models.

Thus, overall verisimilitude will remain unknown until proper dissection of SCP-6549 has taken place. At this time, the entity has showed no signs of aging, though the average lifespan of //Anomalocaris// is unknown and little frame of reference exists to draw conclusion from. \n\nAs expected, the entity is easily provoked and generally hostile when being handled.[[footnote]] SCP-6549's short but often unpredictable bursts of aggression have resulted in personnel referring to the entity as \"a real live wire\".[[/footnote]] While under observation, SCP-6549's primary vector for attack is through whipping its barbed frontal appendages and, with weaker prey, using the soft plates within its mouth for blunt force attacks. \n\nIn recent weeks, however, multitudes of circumstantial evidence have emerged, implicating SCP-6549 in over twenty-five unsolved homicides committed within the last four months, spread across thirteen countries. Each incident involved some implement or skill SCP-6549 could not possibly utilize without additional anomalous qualities, a lack of detail or proper observation of which currently prevents concrete inference from being made regarding its ability to actually carry out said attacks. Usage of telepathically-linked accomplices, ectoentropic nanotechnology, and/or an antimemetic extradimensional hammerspace have not been ruled out as possibility. \n\n----\nSCP-6549 purportedly worked on-set as an actor for \"Tides of Change\", a marine wildlife documentary and slice-of-life dramedy produced/aired by [[[vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub|Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]] and narrated by Sir David Attenborough, which was cancelled shortly into its first season due to \"creative differences\" between members of the production crew.

A large sign can be seen, reading \"YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME, BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.\" View cuts to directly in front of SCP-6549 where the entity's expressionless eyes gaze, askew, into the camera. The shot cuts again, this time to behind the entity, who is implied to be staring at the word \"HOME\" with bittersweet wistfulness.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ATTENBOROUGH:[[/span]] Oh, this isn't right. //Please// let me out of here. Lord almighty, we're //still// in episode one? TimeâTime is meaningless! I have to do //ten// of these?\n\n//<A sound like a whip cracks through the air. Attenborough is heard yelping.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ATTENBOROUGH:[[/span]] //Ow!// You don't need to be so antediluvian-- Hey! No! //Back off.// I'll do the damn thing, just- give me a moment.  //<Breathes.>// From the last lines.\n\n//<A pause. SCP-6549 floats motionless, aside from the ambient flapping keeping it in place.>// \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ATTENBOROUGH:[[/span]] Krillip is not so different from you or I, believe it or not. For example, he and I are both in a prison of sorts. Though, one of us is being released far sooner than the other, from the look of things. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ATTENBOROUGH:[[/span]] And just like //you//, he's currently being watched by hundreds of strangers via the product of cameras placed strategically throughout the location. \n\n//<SCP-6549 swims up to the front desk, where a sea cucumber wearing a guard's outfit lays atop its surface, trying desperately to leave the set. An object is briefly visible from frame left, prodding the \"guard\" back into position. Cut to a document being stamped by a human dressed like a sea cucumber, dressed like a prison guard. Camera cuts back. SCP-6549 wriggles out of its ball and chain, hat coming off in the process. The entity is given a small box of personal effects from off-camera via a rod and hook, which SCP-6549 allows to be lowered onto its back. It then glides out the doors and into a bright white light, likely representing unknown possibilities, almost dropping the box in the process.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ATTENBOROUGH:[[/span]] And as with all of us, the engine of fate remains uncertain in its design and destination. For wily Krillip here, however, the odds are certainly against him. Recidivism rates in this particular reef are higher than one might expect, so we can only hope it will be this future fossil's final foray into the corrections system. Does he have what it takes?

Leave it on the table.\n\n//<A member of security personnel is enters, grunting as a heavy object is placed on the hard surface.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] Back up. //<A pause, followed by the sound of scraping as BeauchÃªne is seen pushing her chair back with her legs.>// Good enough. First, I advise against opening the container yourself. Get like, three more people in here. Make sure you're all padded up, 'cause this thing nearly got us a few times on recovery. Second thing--\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Wait, 'got you', how, exactly?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]]  Look, just don't say I didn't warn you. This thing is not the hermit crab your mother buys you from the boardwalk. //<Pauses.>// With all due respect. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] You didn't answer my question.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] Well, we--\n\n//<The container is heard moving as a loud, muffled bang emanates from within.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] //<Clears throat.>// We don't really know. At least, we disagree on what we saw. //I'm// certain it was trying to impale us with one of those spindly legs it has, while Higgins swears he saw it pull a switchblade--\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] A //switchblade//? \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] I said the same thing, but it's way more plausible if you've read the reports. You did read the reports, right? That was the second thing. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] No, I only just learned we were getting an angry, five-hundred-million-year-old shrimp the size of a small dog, like, half an hour ago? I've been getting the containment area set up, not much time to brief myself on this, I'm afraid.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] Got it. Well, the international intelligence community has been tracking a string of murders, clear crimes of passion. The last few had the same MO; Bullet hole through the head, point blank, aiming downward, you know. Assassination-style, real clean. Now, unbeknownst to the authorities, all the victims were connected via association with VKTM. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] //<Indicating towards contrainer.>// This thing here had a strong argument against it for motive, as you'll read. Disgraced VKTM actor with unchecked anger issues who got the axe for being a diva and attacking staff in a fit of rage. Yet, every death involved was impossible for a creature of this nature. Not without some anomalous ability yet to be observed. Our measurements and diagnostics came back nominal.  \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Bizarre. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] Oh, it gets weirder. Earlier today, local police in Anaheim found this bad boy while responding to reports of gunshots. It was just sitting there next to the corpse of an, uh, executive producer of some documentary series. They also found a gun lying nearby, in a puddle of seawater. Forensics confirmed it was the murder weapon, despite the obvious lack of thumbs, so our little friend here seems to have gotten sloppy.\n\n//<Container shakes violently, followed by loud gurgling.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] //Qu'est-ce que c'est?!// Sounds like distilled anger being strained through cheese cloth. How often does it make those //godawful// noises?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] All the time. Constantly. Some are saying it should be able to speak English, but the thing hasn't said a word since police picked it up. Maybe it thinks keeping quiet will somehow be of help to it in the long run. Maybe it gets an interpreter, who knows. //<Raps knuckles on the solid steel of the box, contents responding with more aggression.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] //<Sighs.>// Well, I'm glad containment is up and running for this... //thing// already. I'll have an auto-feeder added in soon, so none of us have to go near it unless absolutely necessary. Maybe soundproof the chamber, too. Or is that too big a risk?\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] Do what you want, I'm heading back to the States. Just remember; I warned you. And read the dossier. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Mhm. Bye now. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]PERSONNEL:[[/span]] See you.\n\n//<Security personnel leaves the room. The box emits muffled snarls at the sound of the closing door swinging shut.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] So, what to do with you...\n\n//<Wet clicks and chitters. BeauchÃªne skims the briefing on her phone.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Hmph. I don't buy it. Not only do I think you can talk, I think it probably pains you not to. You're a celebrity, right? Don't celebrities let the fame get to their heads? They think everyone wants to hear them talk. That everything revolves around them. Then, they lose it all in a series of misguided, self-absorbed acts that benefit no one. \n\n//<Container rattles. A bang is heard, though the box is unaffected.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Am I close? Did I hit a nerve? You lost it all, including your relationships, I bet. \n\n//<A series of bangs are registered. CCTV shows the box is intact, albeit bent outwards in multiple spots.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Were you being a bit of a--\n\n//<BeauchÃªne quietly leans close to the container.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] //<Whispering.>// --//Selfish shellfish?//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] //<Screaming, box audibly moving from the raucous activity within.>// [[span class=\"bt\"]]//YOU BITCH! YOU FUCKING DID IT NOW!//[[/span]] I'll kill you! Reducing my existence to a bad pun? You are going to regret having legs! Lemme out!\n\n//<Entity continues to attack the inside of its container. It throws itself against the side with a large bang that knocks the box off the table and onto the concrete below. It hits the floor on one of the two hinges securing the release hatch, which dislodges one and bends the other.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] //<Standing, tripping backwards over her jacket, which had fallen off the back of her chair in the commotion.>// Ow. I--Damn. I hate it when I'm right.  \n\n//<SCP-6549 chuckles and pries the hatch open, floating out with ease, eyes glowing white.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] It's time for me to finally become the main character of this world. Then, they'll take me back. She'll have to take me back. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] //<Scrambling back further, away from SCP-6549, and the exit.>// You don't have to do this--\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] Step one, //eliminate all competition, [[span class=\"bt\"]]starting with you.[[/span]]//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]]  No-! //<She braces herself, covering her face from the approaching barbs.>//\n\n//<Silence. After a moment, BeauchÃªne lowers her hands to see SCP-6549 mesmerized by a flashing red light in the upper corner of the chamber.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] Wait, have we been recording this entire time?! I think I missed a cue. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]]  Y-yeah? Yes! This is a live broadcast. Why did you think we had our driver come pick you up specifically? You've been selected to be play the protagonist. This is your real rise to stardom.  \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] //<Overjoyed gurgling.>// Some part of me always knew. And no B plots? \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]]  Nope. This show doesn't need a B plot. Too much intrigue.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] //<Chitters>// Well, I'm in!\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]]  We've also anticipated your arrival and have set up personal quarters for your use. Since you will be working so closely with the project, you should stay on-site--er, on-set.\n\n//<SCP-6549 looks away from the camera.>//\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-6549:[[/span]] Huh? My own trailer... It's finally happening... Thank you.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]BEAUCHÃNE:[[/span]] Let's get you settled. \n\n\n//The remainder of conversation has been redacted from this document for brevity. SCP-6549 is generally more passive and cooperative when entertaining its delusions. Other applications for the use of this technique are being researched.//[[footnote]] Such as convincing it to partake in heists, spycraft, assassinations, exploratory efforts, and other tasks.[[/footnote]]\n  \n-----\n\n= {{[END LOG]}}\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6548]]] | SCP-6549 | [[[SCP-6560]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:ratio-bar base=--|ex=--]]\n[[=]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** \n> **Name:** \n> **Author:**\n> **License:**\n> **Source Link:**\n> **Derivative of:** \n> **Additional Notes:** \n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
