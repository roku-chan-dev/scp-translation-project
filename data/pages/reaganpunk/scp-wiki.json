Bullets exploded from guns teratomatic in their undefined growth of barrels, magazine belts and tactical gadgets. In turn, they exploded in beautiful clouds of phosphorous death, singed the scarred metal that pumped and grew, the diseased veins of a dying giant, endless hallways of hollow bones inside this WeLoveYou Clinic™.  Not just man had been deformed by the nuclear armageddon. Johnny-578™'s brain screamed in notes called adrenaline and cortisol but for a moment. The inescapable regulator implement silenced the weak meat's protests with surgical jolts of disciplining voltage until it complied with the necessary deeds. He was deep into infilitrating the security system. He was a pro, could fill out forms, do ID verification tests (he never used a fake because the hyper-efficient, hyper-fascist security easily dealt with laughable forgery attempts from worthless streetscum like him) and solve captchas like no one else in the 'plex, even if he had to replace most of his frontal lobe with a game console for that. But the new device that the DarkWalker™'s masters forced him to use gave him trouble. It had bugged out and would not accept cookies, which was essential for accessing WeLoveYou clinic™ services.\n\n\"I almost can log onto my email account!\" He yelled. \"Just hold this human garbage off until i can remember every american president while the webbrowser verifies i am not peeking on freedompedia!\"\n\nAngelica Lightning gave coverfire for the team, speeding across the sky, dual wielding grenade launchers with her four arms. Lesser goons would have filled their payload with trite things like nuclear waste or white phosphor, but the handlers of the criminally-indebted-slave-mercenaries where as devious and irreplaceable as they were powerful and rich. On jet boots, she flew over the heads of her foes and showered the replaceable hobowaves - debtslaves, drugged and chromed up street scum- in the pink goo of her grenades. They were impregnated on the spot.  Immediately, the local Jesusbots™, ever vigilant and undefeatable, under control of one of Reagan's wise and infallible presidential subminds, secured them to assure the unborn child™'s survival. On swift and loving wings, they were brought to the nearest Child Salvation Hospital™. The poor fools who resisted were lobotomized right there. Men or not, they would give birth to another wonderful present of MoloChrist, the bull of the world™, to be artificially aged and used in another hobowave somewhere else some time later.\n\nSome of the veteran hobos were vaccinated against pregnancy of course, marked with great badges of shame. But they still had uteruses implanted by the nanoslime. That was where the local witx™ , Bethanx, came in.\n\"Angels of Transphobia and Reaction! I call to you in humble christian prayer! St. Peterson and St. Rowling™! Smite the ones who oppress real whxte wxmxn with their existence!\"\n\nBefore the pregnant hobbos knew, the wrathful spirits had them magically deported. For their crimes, the mutants were deported into Russian freedom camps in the HolethatwasSiberia™ Megaplex where they would clear most of this radioactive wasteland down to the asthenosphere.\n\nBut time was running out.\n\n\"5:48 minutes until your termination for pathetic failure, debt-customers.\" Mission controll mumbled, munching fries and burgers.  \"Please hurry up with exterminatus-ing the union-curious jobtakers.\" \n\nThe distraction was just what Johnny hadn't needed. They forgot to press buttons on their Diepad™ for 45 seconds! It went inactive and the session reset, an automatic security measure in this cyberworld. He screamed in frustrated panic, which in turn made Lightning turn and look for a split second. And this lethal mistake allowed one of the hobos, his dirty, hairy belly suspiciously distending, to hit her with a bottle of PowerThroughRefreshment™ of synth vodka made with a real phoenix fetus inside. Immediatly, her IP protection service took notice. The combination of dangerous chemicals substances, foreign DNA and water made it clear that some sort of tampering went on and so it shut down, to protect the profits of its makers. With a trail of short-circuiting smoke, their pregnacy-support fell from the sky and perished in a glorious combustion of flaming viscera, cybersteel and unpaid eighty digits of debt that immediatly transfered to her children. A phoenix rose from the ashes and suffocated in the pollution.\n\nBethany cried in womanly femality but her anguish turned to unproductive torment as a transsexual lizard stripper whore preformed a merciless cancelation dual pincer attack from SIMULACRUM and the astral plane at once. The skimply dressed mage erupted into a fountain of blood and Genuine Tears.™ Johnny knew then he had no choice but to attempt a direct hack and thus he seized his 'firewall axe'™ and begann to hack the door's console apart. But that was of course what the mastermind behind this WeLoveYou™ clinic expected. The cybergoon cried in shock as he triggered the paralysis shock trap-\n@@...@@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nFrank tore the SIMULACRUM™ headset off and no longer was Johnny. The subscription charged you by the minute and by then, he usually knew the plot of these episodes. The manager came out, taunted and toyed with the helpless criminals, seemingly kills the female and pretends to use her body for nefarious purposes while actually giving her a really cool implant that soon would be going on sale in the Bodytrend™ markets at a 21% discount to the real price, or so, then she and the Johnny would fall in love and learn the valuable lesson that the best remedy to systemic injustice was individual action and became sorta successful middle managers who knew what it meant to put the lives of their workers on the line because once, so had they.\n\nHe of course agreed with all these sensible and valuable lessons, but he only worked three jobs and only the one at the alaskan oil rigs paid decently. Besides, anyone caught in such a crazy, doomed world was way more likely than him to rebel. He'd have done it in their place. He lived in a sane and reasonable country, after all. He turned the AC up and lowered the temperature down to thirty degree; the winter heat was backing him. As only bad news came on TV, he turned that one off too and sucked some more oxygen from his tank. It helped circulate the Coff-ampheta-in™ pills and he'd need them, especially if he started to work on the nuclear clearup site first, like his temp agency manager graciously hinted at. He waved at the CTV in his single apartment room as he jammed the nutrient injection needles in and prepared for a productive sleep.\n\n\"Good Night, Reagan. Love you.\"\n\n\"L-Love you t-d-destroy communism, Frank.\" The green-and-black-lines of the Eternal President's cyberface fluttered, the entropic imitation of a smile.\n\n------\n\nBethany unplugged and was stuck in his ugly man body again. Great MoloChrist! How he hated that. Hated existing in the balding, stubbly bearded, meatloaf-handed thing. SIMULACRUM™ was horrible, but this had felt like a great jog. Of course, he couldn't jog much anymore with the pollution and plague and all. So, SIMULACRUM™.\nHe knew being trans was wrong and punishable by sacrifices to MoloChrist, but this was ok, right? He was fighting against patriachy like this, right? Training his attidude and learning what oppressed and saddened woman, right? He was a good ally, not some bizarre sexpervert! He was using the time off work to become a better person, just like MoloChrist would want him to!\n\nEverything was right, right?\n\n------\n\nLightning did not wake. One memetic she saw had whispered in her ear; how cool it would be to set the SIMULACRUM™ so that you would die in real life if you died in the game. She was fully sucessful with this idea, as was the developer of the memetic, who rejoiced in their darkened room riddled with screens. One less dead eater, one more weakling purged. One less plague rat tarnishing the planet with a useless existence. They cried in joy as they thought at the billions of future humans they had allowed to live in prosperity on the Mars colonies. They would come to exist faster, happier, stronger. Unpolluted with inferior genes tainted by memetic weakness. They loved their fellow humans like a parent. A love purged of kindness. Agood parents hates weakness in their progeny. Mankind needed discipline and cultivation. And by MoloChrist, they would get it! Inside their mind, the memetics of Capital pulsed like a leucochloridium paradoxum worm that had eaten all that was once was inside.\n\n------\n\nAnd finally, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7629 Droganian] \"Lizard\" unplugged. She blew a Cocainola™-flavored bubblegum bubble and rolled away as an unwashed man shoved her aside to get back to the rig and watched it all. She stayed close. She liked his smell. Oil and blood.\n\"Fucking brainrotted idiot pigs.\" He snarled. \"FUCK! Why are they all so fucking stupid fucking fucks!\" With a black and dirty boot, he hammered against a metal wall, again and again and again. He screamed, a vein popping dangerously on his temples.\nThe creature sighed and passed an injector that the man shoved into a punctured, pale arm. He slumped backwards, defeated.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nShe eyed him still. He did not pull the needle out. He sobbed, now. She didn't mind. Just another weird monkey thing, she supposed. She pulled it out and licked some of the drug and the red away. He hugged her, muscles straining. She sighed. He got boring, more and more every day. He used to talk about making the world a better place. About something else but killing. About weed and fun.\n\n\"I know why i don't bother with humans anymore.\" He blubbered, in the midst of a rebound. He kissed her, her maw still wet with blood.\n\n\"Not like anyone's better.\" She responded \"My people showed that. Guards and police-mercenaries will be needed for a good while. We are still cheaper than some robots.\"\n\nShe thought of childhood day spent in a world without light and chaos. Of the sirens. Of the overcrowded bunkers. Of the bombs and the collapse. How their ancient caves burned, Her family caught in eternity. Twisted, gory skeletons caught in the midst of the shift between forms. How they smiled when the Reaganite corporations bought off the worthless waste that their home had become. How gladly they all signed up to squash these little stupid hairless monkeys for a chunk of synthetic protein and digital hoards that'd disappear the moment they said no to being slaves. How their two-leg forms shed all that made them human. How all their dead returned as digital ghosts and deplored the soviet regime, the enviromental destruction, the pretend-democracy, the ghoul-like oligarchs, the endless impoverishment, the ideological indoctrination, in cutesy SIMULACRUM™ cartoons where they espoused the merits of world under MoloChrist's loving, neoliberal wings. She swallowed her gum.\n\nHe pulled her close. She didn't mind that either.  \"Total memetic roasting. This has to stop. They aren't gonna stop with this earth. With this universe. Capital needs to grow, needs to expand. Unless we hack it to little pieces, it will consume all.\" \n\nHe gesticulated. \"People have to die. This world has to die. And we gotta do it. We need to kill. We need to kill everyone we know. This world need to be refuted into non-existence. It's the only way to save the rest.\"\n\nShe realized then that she loved him. He was boring. He was a mess. But he wanted to burn. She got that. She got that very well. Fangs piercing his skin, she kissed back and he found a prick better than that of any needle.",
