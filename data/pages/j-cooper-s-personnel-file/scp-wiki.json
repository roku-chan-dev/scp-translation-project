Choiwel was found with less than 5% oxygen in his suit when recovered from Sol-side of the wormhole. He was then offered a Foundation research position on a planet Gargantua-side of the wormhole, which he accepted. \n\nChoiwel conducts studies on known anomalies, and all of his research data is transmitted through the wormhole to him. He is given special access to the entire Foundation database[[footnote]] Except where strictly forbidden by O5 command [[/footnote]], and is actively analyzing data from a select few anomalies.\n\nThe following anomalies are those which Choiwel has documented himself and deemed significant enough to be inserted into the Foundation SCP database:\n\n* [[[SCP-1563]]]\n* [[[SCP-2412]]]\n * [[[Document-2412-Tl1563]]]\n* [[[SCP-2764]]]\n* [[[SCP-3419]]]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
