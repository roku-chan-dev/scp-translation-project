If you are looking for information about the on-site critters, check out the [[[Butterfly Squad Roster]]]!//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[toc]]\n\n-----\n\n++ __What is the 'Moth Squad'?__\n\nThe Moth Squad is a group of dedicated critters for the [https://discord.gg/scp SCP Foundation Official Discord].\n\nMembers of the 'Moth Squad' are not members of staff by virtue of being on the Moth Squad, but membership of the moth squad does not prevent you from being on staff, and vice versa. Members of the Moth Squad do not have any additional permissions or authority as compared to any other user of the SCP Foundation Official Discord. They are specifically highlighted as talented critters who can help coach and guide new authors through the writing process, and provide insights into ways to improve.\n\n-----\n\n++ __Joining, Application and Approval Process__\n\n+++ Joining Requirements\n\nIn terms of requirements for being a member of the Discord Critique 'Moth Squad'\n\n* You must have about a month of consistent activity within the Discord Writing Critique channels before joining;\n* You must be an active member of the SCP Foundation Official Discord;\n* You must not be critique banned from the Deer College Channels;\n* You must be a member of the SCP Wiki (as is required to join the Deer college channels);\n* If you are the recipient of AHT or Disciplinary actions outside of the SCP Foundation Official Discord purview, your eligibility will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and your eligibility will be determined by the Discord Critique Staff;\n* If you have had an application rejected from the Moth Squad, you must have: a) met any listed requirements for reapplication, and b) it must be at least one month since the date of your previous rejection.\n\nIn addition, if you have received Discord Critique actions against you due to behavior, we expect three (3) months of behavior that does not violate critique rules to qualify for membership on the Moth Squad. Please note that a repeat or consistent history of critique actions levied against you is sufficient grounds for denial from the Moth Squad Roster.\n\nIn addition to the above requirements, any applicants should meet the following criteria, and have demonstrated said skills within the SCP Foundation Discord Deer College Writing Channels:\n\n* Skilled with Writing Critique;\n * This can be Idea Critique, Draft Critique, or a mixture of both;\n* Skilled in communicating ideas, concepts and frameworks for Literary Analysis;\n * Discussions within #metacritique are a great way to demonstrate the skill and understanding of the critique process\n* Demonstrate patience and a willingness to teach, guide, and support new authors through the Writing Process;\n* Understand the culture of the Deer College channels, and contribute towards the collaborative, supportive environment with all members of the Writing Channels.\n\n-----\n\n+++ Moth Squad Application\n\nTo apply to be a member of the Moth Squad, you should contact any member of the Discord Critique team with the following:\n\n* At least Three Links to Critique given in the Deer College #idea-critique or #draft-critique channels, that demonstrate your critique abilities.\n * Optional: Include explanations of why you feel that they are good examples of your critique, and demonstrate what you can provide to members of Deer College.\n* Explain why you would like to be a member of the Moth Squad, and your reasoning for trying out for our team.\n\nWhen you send that to a member of Critique Staff, they will forward the application to the rest of the team and we will discuss it. We cannot guarantee a timeline on a response, nor constant updates; if you have not received a rejection message, then your application is still being discussed and/or processed. If it has been more than 2 weeks, you can follow up with the Discord Critique staff member, to ensure that the application was properly ported; however, we cannot answer any questions regarding the status of an application.\n\nThere are four potential responses to a Moth Squad Application:\n# **Acceptance** to the Moth Squad. You will receive a message from either the Captain, or a Vice Captain of Discord Critique stating that you have been accepted to the Moth Squad. We will coordinate your joining, and you will be a member of the Moth Squad unless you are removed, either willingly or by breaking the rules.\n# **Acceptance, Conditional** on the successful completion of a Discord Critique run Crit Flight. For the definition of a 'successful Critique Flight', more information can be found by asking a member of the Discord Critique team.\n# **Rejection**, without additional restrictions on when you can reapply, excluding the one month period between rejection and applications.\n# **Rejection, with Restrictions** laid out that need to be met before an individual is able to reapply for the moth squad. This can be a crit flight, a change in behaviors, or otherwise. If you are rejected, and there are additional restrictions, it will be directly stated in the rejection message, and can be clarified by either the Captains or Vice Captains of Discord Critique at any time.\n\nIf you have not received a response from a member of crit staff, then your application is still under review.\n\n-----\n\n++ __Expectations__\n\nA member of the Moth Squad is expected to maintain the activities, behaviors and standards befitting of a designated, dedicated critter. For all members of the Moth Squad roster, we expect that:\n\n* All members of the Moth Squad roster are expected to maintain a level of activity or presence within the Deer College channels, unless they have given prior notice.\n* We expect that a member of the Moth Squad will be a productive and constructive contributor to the conversations, culture and environment in Deer College.\n * Any member of the Moth Squad roster is able to change their activity status at will, from active to inactive.\n * If a Moth Squad member is aware that they will be going into an extended absence, it is important to notify a member of the Discord Critique team in advance of the hiatus.\n* All members of the Moth Squad roster will represent themselves in a manner befitting of a designated critter for the Discord Critique spaces. This includes:\n * All critique given must conform to Site-wide critique standards and guidelines;\n * All members must adhere to both server-wide and Deer College specific rules;\n* Moth Squad members are expected to try and respond either accepting or passing on a critique request within a timely fashion, **as long as** the request follows their template as listed in the Moth Squad roster.\n * If a user does not follow the template, a moth should use the 'Failure to Follow Contact Info tracking thread', and is under no obligation to respond.\n * A failure to respond to a message that follows your template in a timely manner is **not** grounds for dismissal, however, following a pattern of non-responsiveness, a moth's status will be reviewed by the team.\n* A Moth should not use their position on the Moth Squad roster to leverage anything from any users; Moths are not an authority within Deer College Spaces, and are simply designated critters.\n\n-----\n\n++ __Reasons for Removal__\n\nA moth may be removed from the Moth Squad roster, at any time without notice, for any of the following reasons.\n\n* A moth, may, at any time, request their removal from the Moth Squad roster. This will be done, and they will be removed **in good standing**.\n* If a moth violates either the server-wide rules, or the Deer College rules, and punitive action is levied, they will be removed from the moth squad roster. A determination between the removal being in good or poor standing is dependent on the incident, and will be determined by Discord Critique staff during a review, the results of which will be communicated directly to the moth at the time of removal.\n* Any moth found to have leveraged their position on the Moth Squad roster to take advantage of another user, or to have used said status to imply that they are an authority within Deer College will be reviewed by Discord Critique staff, and will lead to removal **in poor standing**.\n* Any moth who is the recipient of AHT or Disciplinary actions outside of the SCP Foundation Official discord purview are to undergo review by the Discord Critique Staff, and if removed, will be removed **in poor standing**.\n* Any moth who is inactive for a period of 3 months or more, and is unable to be contacted during this period by the Discord Critique team will be removed from the Moth Squad roster **in good standing**.\n* Any Moth who fails to respond to the Discord Critique Captain or Vice Captains regarding a roster check is subject to removal, **in good standing**.\n\nThe above are not the only reasons a moth may be removed from the Moth Squad Roster -- other reasons will be discussed internally by the Discord Critique team on a case by case basis. The above are examples of the most common potential reasons. **Discord Critique Staff have final say** regarding removals from the Moth Squad Roster.\n\n-----\n\n+++ Types of Removal\n\nWhen a member of the Moth Squad Roster is removed, they can either be removed in good or poor standing. The difference determines what is required for a member to rejoin the Moth Squad Roster.\n\n-----\n\n++++ In Good Standing\n\nIf a Moth is removed 'in good standing', this means that they can rejoin the Moth Squad Roster at any time, pursuant to the listed requirements under the 'Joining Requirements' section.\n\n-----\n\n++++ In Poor Standing\n\nIf a Moth is removed 'in poor standing', they will be unable to rejoin the Moth Squad Roster without demonstrating that they have grown since the incident that removed them from the roster. These expectations will be communicated on request, and may be revised at any time by Discord Critique Staff. Removal in poor standing does **not** mean that you have been permanently banned from Moth Squad Roster membership, however, we do expect significant growth and demonstrated changed behavior from the removing incident.\n\n-----\n\n++ __Questions?__\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to hop into the Discord and ask any member of critique staff! You can always find us in the Deer College channels, so don't be afraid to say hi!",
