SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 are to be kept under remote surveillance at separate, low-staff Foundation facilities away from major population centers. These facilities are as follows:\n\n**SCP-7983-1** | █-BLOCK in Res. Site-45, Indian Ocean\n**SCP-7983-2** | Site-120 Outpost-3, ███████, Poland\n**SCP-7983-3** | Observation Post Nemo at Point Nemo\n\nSCPs are to be contained under a two-factor biometric lock and rotating staff. All other non-essential roles in containment should be highly automated, as outlined under TAK[[footnote]]**T**hrow **A**way the **K**ey; see “Safety Without Numbers” by Dr. Noah Bodin.[[/footnote]] Procedures. If access to SCPs-7983-1, 2, and/or 3 is deemed necessary, the relevant Level 4 Personnel will arrange the delivery of a biological sample to arrive within 3-14 business days.[[footnote]]It should be noted that the goal of containment for SCPs-7983-1 through 3 is __not__ to keep them in, it is to keep compromised Foundation personnel __out__.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-7983 itself provides minor security risk. Radio Frequency (RF) Shielding should be used to prevent dissemination of SCP’s lure via fake radio advert while in containment. Should it manifest, SCP-7983 can be contained in any sealed room tall enough to house it. It is --either unable or-- unwilling to break through even weak barriers, such as annealed or tempered glass.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7983 is an entity resembling the cereal mascot “Clover” from popular kids cereal Magic Munchos. It stands 2.5 meters tall (8 foot 3 inches) when hunched, with misproportioned arms and legs and a tall, broad-brimmed top hat contributing to its height. Its leprechaun mimicry is not incidental, as an update to Clover’s design on Magic Munchos boxes in 2010 prompted a similar change in SCP-7983 in all subsequent manifestations[[footnote]]In March 2010 General Mills made minor cosmetic updates to Clover’s outfit as depicted on boxes of Magic Munchos. Included among these changes was the removal of the character’s green scarf. Subsequent manifestations of SCP-7983 following these changes confirmed the matching disappearance of the entity’s green scarf.[[/footnote]]. The entity’s dress is in faded imitation of Clover’s, that being: a dirty green swallow-tailed evening coat, red and white striped stockings, and green curled-point poulaine shoes. --Corroborating accounts from product developer John Holanah and character artist Maysa Jaziri at General Mills disprove the theory that Clover’s original design in 1964 was inspired by SCP-7983, and not vice versa.--\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=ToyTest.png | caption=SCP-7983-1 | width=160px ]]\n\nPrior to manifestation, cursory tests suggest SCP-7983 occupies base reality in the form of high-compression radio waves[[footnote]]The theory that SCP-7983’s origins can be traced to the storage of a VTG Fonovox radio within a compromised Scranton Box in Site-██, while not discredited, has fallen out of favor among Foundation researchers.[[/footnote]] (the complexity therein having given rise to some form of intelligence). Manifestation is triggered upon the collection of the 3 marking totems (the aforementioned SCPs-7983-1 through 3). SCPs-7983-1 through 3 are miniature plastic “leprechaun” figurines with no anomalous properties, save for their link to SCP-7983. Each figurine has distinctive headwear and facial hair, as well as a “Made in China” sticker on the base, despite no known manufacturer being found. Figurines first appeared in unlabeled Magic Muchos cereal boxes as part of SCP-7983’s “Wee Folk Challenge” radio lure in 2005 (see “Wee Folk Challenge” Radio Lure, 2005).\n\nUpon manifestation, SCP-7983 will exhibit a hostile ontokinetic response (See Interview Log | LEVEL 0 PERSONNEL). Care should be taken to ensure distance is maintained at all times between the entity and essential Foundation personnel.\n\n**“Wee Folk Challenge” Radio Lure, 2005**\n\nFoundation involvement with SCP-7983 began in March 2005 following reports of an anomalous radio advert for Magic Munchos cereal, airing between the hours of 2:00 and 5:00 AM for 3 consecutive days in select states along the American east coast. The contents of the ad, later denounced by General Mills, are as follows:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Cartoon sound FX. Minor audio distortions throughout.//\n\n**Nice try, leprechaun! No Magic Munchos for you! Magic Munchos! Part of a complete breakfast. And introducing the Wee Folk Challenge. Find all three of the leprechaun’s friends in boxes of Magic Munchos and win the biiiiiiig prize.**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nShortly after airing, reports of SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 appearing in Magic Munchos cereal boxes were investigated with unusual interest by Foundation personnel[[footnote]]“The tenacious and, frankly, unprofessional interest shown by ground personnel in the first 2005 radio lure, and in particular the discoveries of SCPs-7983-1 through 3, was the first sign to me and my colleagues that we were dealing with something that affected our own behavior.” ~ Dr. Noah Bodin.[[/footnote]], considering the perceived threat level and lack of information present. These investigations later led to the recovery of footage documenting SCP-7983’s first known appearance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **2005 ROAD FOOTAGE**\n----\n//The following footage was recovered outside a stalled vehicle on the side of the road in late March, two days after the 2005 lure was broadcast. Recorded on Sony Handycam, its final moments briefly depict SCP-7983 approaching the camera[[footnote]]The driver was reported missing the following morning and declared dead in absentia in 2012.[[/footnote]]. SCPs-7983-1, 2, and 3 were found in the vehicle’s glove compartment.//\n\n[[html]]\n<video style=\"width:100%; height:100%\" controls>\n<source src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7983/RoadFootageFull.mp4\" > type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**“Wee Folk Challenge” Radio Lure, 2020**\n\nIn 2020, 15 years after the initial lure, a second string of fake radio adverts for Magic Munchos aired over the course of one week in March. The contents of the ad remained unchanged from the 2005 broadcast, again announcing the unsanctioned “Wee Folk Challenge” and a prize reward. Immediately prior to the 2020 broadcast, SCPs-7983-1 through 3 were removed from containment at Site-██ without the Foundation’s knowledge, in culmination of a series of unexplained security breaches undertaken by Foundation personnel (see Interview Log | MTFC FINN ELSHER). SCPs were recovered after the one-week broadcast period from the remains of a Foundation technician, after which TAK Procedures were put in place.\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=Face2TestSmall.png | | width=300px | caption=SCP-7983 looking at the camera during interview ]]\n\nReports of SCP-7983 were made by several east coast residents throughout the broadcast week. Most encounters occurred in private residences and left no witnesses, however the actions of an employee at a 24-hour convenience store in ██████, New Jersey resulted in SCP-7983’s manifestation being caught on the in-store security cameras. Mobile Task Force Lambda-8 was deployed on a scrub mission, but faulty equipment left the security system’s backups intact, later causing footage of the incident to leak online. To contain the leak, the Foundation engaged in an extensive disinformation campaign. This in large part consisted of flooding the Internet with spurious firsthand accounts attesting to “evil leprechauns” and related folklore, as well as the dissemination of obviously doctored AIC-generated images. With such a vast quantity of related media, recognition of SCP-7983’s true appearance is unlikely[[footnote]]While the incident has largely passed into urban legend, personnel are obligated to monitor the work of any artists whose representations come [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr18boXXEk0 disturbingly close] to reality.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Interview Logs**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log | MTFC FINN ELSHER\" hide=\"- Interview Log | MTFC FINN ELSHER\"]]\n**Date:** March 20th, 2005\n\n**Interviewee:** MTFC Finn Elsher\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Noah Bodin\n\n**Notes:** Shortly after deployment of MTF Lambda-6 in the 2005 Road Footage incident, Mobile Task Force Commander (MTFC) Finn Elsher was caught attempting to break into a strongbox containing SCP-7983-2.

It is presumed SCP-7983 manifested in response to the 3 totems and had just dealt with the technician when the Level 0 Personnel arrived. The worker was alone with SCP-7983 for 3 minutes before help arrived, after which time she showed symptoms indicative of a severe ontokinetic attack.

Local reality is distorted until a certain threshold or “tipping point” is reached, after which the space becomes entirely governable by the entity. Prior to this tipping point, it is not uncommon for a victim to feel like they “don’t belong” in local space, as their existence in the entity’s forthcoming reality takes precedence in their mind.[[/footnote]].
