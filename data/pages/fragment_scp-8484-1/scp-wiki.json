Approximately 75% of the Coalition's population was rendered debilitated.\n\nThe PANGAEA Division Initiative immediately enacted the Cataclysmic Emergency Act (2003) under the direct oversight of the Undersecretariat. Despite being affiliated with the GOC, PANGAEA had no casualties, allowing it to launch MOBCOM (Mobile Command) to substitute absent HICOM personnel.\n\nThe eigenweapon impacted the following organizations:\n* Council of 108 members\n* HICOM (~50 personnel)\n* PHYSICS Division (~150,000 personnel)\n* PSYCHE Division (~50,000 personnel)\n* PTOLEMY Division (~20,000 personnel)\n* PNEUMA Division (~1000 personnel)\n\nPublicly, the Coalition denied such an incident from occurring in fear of hostile organizations exploiting an opportunistic gap in security.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ CAMERA FOOTAGE TRANSCRIPTION||\n\n**Date:** January 5th, 2016\n**Location:** St. Atropos Hospital, Unit 5C, Rm 433A\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Dr. Silver:** Are you out of your mind?\n\n**Dr. Xu:** As far as I'm aware, she suffered a severe hemorrhage.

Any available physician, please respond.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nUpon the incident being sufficiently allayed, medical reports indicated that patients affected by this eigenweapon displayed rapid cellular degradation. PTOLEMY R&D confirmed this suspicion after //in vitro// culture plates holding patient cell samples exhibited erratic apoptosis. There was no further evidence of a pathogenic or bioweapon agent inducing this reaction.\n\nApproximately 8% of the Coalition (~32,000 personnel) perished instantly or shortly after the eigenweapon's deployment. The remaining 72% (~288,000 personnel) were rushed to nearby ICUs and immediately hospitalized.\n\nThere is no treatment or cure. Every patient affected by this phenomenon died.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=before.jpg|align=center|width=80%|caption=Taken with an inverted microscope.

Due to Second Mission concerns, MOBCOM decided not to request additional assistance from mundane hospitals.\n\nIn an effort to minimize suffering, patients determined to be unrecoverable were administered midazolam as a sedative, analgesic lidocaine, and then a kill injection of potassium chloride, which are medications sequentially used for medical assistance in dying (MAiD). Following patient expiration, they were subsequently discharged, allowing the bed they occupied to become available for those with a higher chance of survival.\n\nMAiD was also administered to outpatients in waiting rooms, as the majority were not expected to survive.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; background:#b5aa8a; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n\n##000000|January 13th, 2022.##\n\n##000000|You are a constellation.

This method has mitigated the chances of operatives getting compromised.\n\n**Awakened State:** A period of time when agents have full control over their own physical body and consciousness.\n\n**Dream State:** Also known as **The Deep**, the Dream State is remotely activated by PNEUMA command, triggered by a cognitohazardous tone only audible for sleeper agents which activates a sequence of neurological implants and jumpstarts artificial action potentials. After thirty to fifty seconds, a separate persona conforming to a desired identity will control the agent. The agent’s original identity remains alert in their subconscious, enabling a subtle influence on their persona's actions.\n\nSimilar to dreaming, agents witness their bodies move without volition, acting out their identity for the agent's convenience. This enables an Awakened agent to retain their memory and effectively recall information gathered during the Dream State.\n\nUnfortunately, the downside every sleeper is required to accept is they are incapable of breaking out of the Deep unless prompted by PNEUMA command. Should an agent become compromised for whatever reason, they will likely remain in the Deep indefinitely until further notice or death.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ EARWIG BUG TRANSCRIPTION||\n\n**Date:** January 11th, 2016\n**Location:** [CENSORED]\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Assistant Director Nize:** Keep them asleep.

Continuing your act is your only guarantee.\n\n**Helena:** Sir, I think there's someone within our ranks with the know-how that could be responsible for our comrades' disappearances. There were many who weren't inflicted by the eigenweapon that were arrested. Someone must've found us out and told the organizations we are in. Please, you must've known about this.\n\n**Nize:** I've assured you countless times that there were no info leaks. You are all safe where you—\n\n**Psalm:** SIR!\n\n//Silence elapses. Nize's head tilts up slightly. Psalm sighs.//\n\n**Nize:** Am I reading the room correctly?\n\n**Helena:** Well—\n\n**Psalm:** Yes, you are, sir.\n\n**Nize:** Helena?\n\n//Helena does not respond.//\n\n**Nize:** I see.\n\n**Psalm:** You showed up out of the blue, taking the reins, and you think you can herd us right out of the gate. I've put two and two together, and there are no such things as coincidences. Certainly not in the field I operate in.\n\n**Nize:** You would be wise to think that.\n\n**Psalm:** Would I?\n\n**Helena:** Sir, we haven't developed much trust. We've worked with Assistant Director Eris for perhaps our entire lives. But, even with our time constraints, I think reestablishing that trust with you can... help us along.\n\n **Psalm:** Forget about it. He doesn't care about trust.\n\n**Nize:** Correct.\n\n//Silence elapses again. Nize stands up, hands in his pockets.//\n\n**Nize:** I don't care about trust because you've already reciprocated it.\n\n**Psalm:** What kind of bullshit—\n\n**Nize:** Enough of your groveling, Psalm. I think I've heard enough. Yes. It is true that Eris was an extraordinary director. Down to the letter, crossed his Ts, dotted his Is. However, what he lacked has acidified our waters.\n\n//Nize turns around and steps forward slowly.//\n\n**Nize:** What slid under his deaf ears permeated throughout this entire coalition, until it tore through our abdomens.\n\n//Nize takes another step.//\n\n**Nize:** And reared its atrocious face out of our chests.\n\n//And another step.//\n\n**Nize:** It was enough for one to cower into a corner, disabled, and traumatized. \n\n//And one last step, until he is directly underneath the overhead camera.//\n\n**Nize:** Enough to make you, Psalm...\n\n//Nize tilts his head up and stares directly into the camera.//\n\n**Nize:** ...and everyone else here quiver and fall. And now we're here, thousands of us dead. So, let me ask the audience, do you want me to be another Eris?\n\n**Psalm:** What are you talking about?\n\n**Nize:** More so, who am I talking to?\n\n//Nize tilts his head sideways, squinting into the camera.//\n\n**Nize:** Psalm, I did burn all of your men. Yours as well, Helena. And you, Trish—Rogers, Phalanx, and whoever else is watching now. After all, this entire get-together was your idea, wasn’t it, Psalm?\n\n**Psalm:** I’m going to hang you by your tongue.\n\n**Helena:** Psalm—\n\n**Nize:** He's right, Helena. I’m a piece of shit. The biggest kind you'll ever meet. That’s what separates me from Eris.\n\n//Nize lowers his head, looking ahead.//\n\n**Nize:** But tell me, since you are all such seasoned operatives, what would tip our culprit off? The anticipated uncovering of our own among their ranks? To confirm their suspicions? To satisfy their palette with more blood? More tragedy? Or is it subverting their expectations and proving our competence?\n\n//Nize turns his head around, keeping his back facing the chair.//\n\n**Nize:** Helena?\n\n**Helena:** Subversion? Show of force? Let them know we're unbreakable.\n\n//The corners of Nize's mouth pinches up until he bares his teeth. A low, guttural chuckle emanates which suddenly spikes into laughter.//\n\n**Psalm:** What are you laughing at, rat?\n\n**Nize:** Incorrect. If you do that, you’ll be showing your hand.\n\n//Nize turns around to face the chair.//\n\n**Nize:** We give them everything they want. We fill their stomachs with fat until they can no longer move. We make them think we’re smaller than them. And you are right in thinking that such a pitiful number of us can never make a difference. But numbers don't matter if the enemy is too self-indulgent to care anymore.\n\n //Nize balls his right hand into a fist.//\n\n**Nize:** The fatter the prey, the bigger the game.\n\n //He covers his right fist with his left hand.//\n\n**Nize:** You sway the elk somewhere it's content with...\n\n //He cracks his knuckles.//\n\n**Nize:** ...and it'll miss the forest for the trees.\n\n //He walks to the chair.//\n\n**Nize:** If I was a traitor, Psalm, I would've burned you all without temperance. But surely you've acknowledged the doubts in the back of your mind.\n\n**Psalm:** That you couldn't be a traitor? Laughable.\n\n**Nize:** That \"there are no such things as coincidences.\" Helena, her superior technological prowess; Steelgard, his expert data analysis; Rogers, his evasive mobility enough to dizzy me; Psalm, your keen memory for every detail. I don't think I need to remind your refined memory that every individual I let go of was a novice at best, and you surely knew there was a reason behind this.\n\n//Nize stands behind the chair and pulls it back.//\n\n**Nize:** So, with all that foresight and a strikingly close prediction, who am I talking to here, Psalm? The people you’ve gathered here to expose me? Or you? It is true you have put two and two together, but perhaps you've molded the conclusion into something more... digestible. Is that a byproduct of Eris' leadership?\n\n**Psalm:** Shut the fuck up.\n\n**Nize:** It's easier to point your fingers at someone. But you know the rough idea of my plan, don't you? To give them what they want? So I beg you the same question again: do you want me to be Eris instead? To cower asunder? To hesitate?\n\n //Nize steps around and sits on the chair, bringing himself forward to the roundtable. Every chair encircling the table and its contents thrashed about, leaving askew from its previous occupants' haste.//\n\n**Nize:** Do you understand me, Psalm?\n\n //Nize props his legs up and crosses them together on the table.//\n\n**Nize:** It's a yes or no question.\n\n**Psalm:** No. No, I don't understand. How can you throw away lives so easily? You are supposed to bolster our security, not weaken it into submission. We are here to fight for a noble cause, not one tainted by crimes. Yes, perhaps the people you burned saved us, but at what cost? All you've done is stripped everything from us.\n\n**Nize:** Me?\n\n //Nize lowers his legs and sits upright.//\n\n**Nize:** Me? This is incomparable to what happened before I came along.\n\n //Nize leans forward.//\n\n**Nize:** What I scrutinized Eris for was his inability to realize sacrifice, and the same now goes for all of you. You all fear for yourself, not for the people who are dying as we speak. You are scared that I will reveal you to the enemy, not tear down this excuse of \"security.\" You are afraid of dying.\n\n //Nize leans back, head tilted up.//\n\n**Nize:** Your lives have already been stripped away—comfort is impossible, and cruelty is a necessity. You are tools used by the upper echelon who know no better. I will imbue that heavy truth you should’ve already accepted. Because right now, you are gingerly admitting that you have never understood what sacrifice is—what it entails and what it reaps. And that isn't what'll get you killed; it's what will get //everybody// killed.\n\n//Nize pulls out a silenced pistol and shoots at the camera. The video feed is disabled, but the audio remains intact.//\n\n**Nize:** You're not fighting for whatever noble cause you delude yourselves with. Every single one of us are tools to further agendas. I am being used to help the people above find a scapegoat, and you are being used to help me find the truth.\n\n//There is a click. A sharp tone is overheard in Helena's and Psalm's audio feeds. Frantic shuffling is heard from the two.//\n\n**Nize:** To reveal injustice, you must permit it. Long enough for the stench to become memorable. All you need to do is continue acting in your spots and change absolutely nothing. Report to me on any findings, but keep comms limited. And if I don't answer, there's a reason. I've given you time. //They// have given you time. So when your prey has fattened enough, I hope you don't hesitate like you did today, because if you do, then those sacrifices will amount to nothing.\n\n//Helena's sobs are barely audible over the transmission. Psalm curses indiscernibly. Nize racks another round.//\n\n**Nize:** Follow me, and I will give those sacrifices the noble meaning you desire.\n\n//There is another silenced gunshot which terminates the audio feed's connection.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nDuring the Lapse, approximately 600 PNEUMA sleeper agents suffered the same symptoms of accelerated cellular degradation. This, in turn, alarmed foreign organizations, confirming prior suspicions that the GOC had waged a conglomerate espionage effort without diplomatic advice, ultimately compromising agents’ cover.\n\nSubsequently, an additional 400 sleeper agents were rooted out by individual organizations, primarily because of increased scrutiny from foreign organizations and info leaks from faulty handling of GOC intelligence. The number gradually increased, and once the trend plateaued, many believed the GOC's intelligence capabilities had entirely capitulated.\n\nRecordings of sleeper agents' subconsciousness containing their last thoughts prior to expiration or abandonment have been logged. Due to its disturbing nature, only MOBCOM personnel are allowed to access these files until further notice.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ CAMERA FOOTAGE TRANSCRIPTION||\n\n**Date:** January 12th, 2016\n**Location:** [CENSORED]\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** Are you sure this is how you’d like your first impression to be with them?\n\n**Nize:** To give their sacrifices meaning?\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** How do you promise that?\n\n//Nize clenches his jaw.//\n\n**Nize:** It’s not an objective I take lightly.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** Words are words.\n\n//Al Fine straightens a sheaf of papers.//\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** PNEUMA’s EXSEC prides itself on constancy.

It will work.\n\n//Al Fine steeples her hands.//\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** And how do you know?\n\n**Nize:** The Hand’s wardens have apprehended numerous agents, most of them killed, giving them space to sigh a sizable breath of relief, which enabled our remaining agents to go deeper in; UIU is still somewhat panicked, catching up to what’s happening, but they’re still relatively oblivious with little difference in their security’s shady integrity; the Chaos Insurgency doesn’t care; the Foundation is pleased with the results and is now focused on diplomacy instead of counterintelligence, looking to sponsor our “recovery” under their banner; and MC&D has already known we’ve been keeping an eye on them, but even with that precognition, faults are beginning to grow and we’ve snatched opportunities we couldn’t have before.\n\n//Silence elapses.

Something that will convince them that we’re too weak, so we resort to a questionable but effective expedient—one that will force their hand. They’ll reveal themselves in their haste.

Clearly, he displays a significant amount of knowledge for not being a Type Blue.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** Love makes you stupid.\n\n**Nize:** Where is he now?\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** Well, that’s the good news. Considering you’re already stalking his history, I did that favor for you.\n\n//Al Fine slides her laptop to her and turns the screen to Nize.//\n\n**Nize:** It worked.

The same goes for our authorization.\n\n//Nize turns to al Fine.//\n\n**Nize:** This is perfect. If we can get Acheron, who knows what more we can learn? From everyone who died. Their sacrifices will truly have meaning. This is our distraction. We’ll iron out the odds.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** We don’t even know how Acheron works yet.\n\n**Nize:** HARBOR said to us before, did it not?

The liquidation proposals were meant to encourage him, not spark the fire. Her death has convinced him now.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** So you’re certain it’s him?\n\n**Nize:** “Find the Lost One who will do anything to care for the dead. Find the Wandering One whose trajectory depends upon a soul. Find the Intuited One who understands the weight of living and death. Find the Determined One who will stop at nothing to secure justice for those not ready to die.

Now we pick up the pieces.\n\n**Bodie:** I second that. Supervisor Kinsey, there is no substantial cause for concern. Their financial accounts are in ruins, their logistics awry, and their military is a shadow of its former self. They even think one of their own did it. Your own sources confirmed that. What they need is some level of organization from the chaos ensuing.\n\n**Hildred:** Which is why we should push for a more diplomatic front. Encourage External Affairs to get onto it immediately. Offer our hand. If they don’t take it now, they will eventually. And once we’ve built sufficient trust, they will flock to us. Wait any longer, and the opportunity will grow farther away, and once we’ve realized that, they’ll have already recovered independently.\n\n**Kinsey:** ETHCOM will never permit it.\n\n**Hildred:** They permitted the detonation, did they not?\n\n**Kinsey:** That’s because we had no choice.\n\n//Kinsey glares at Hildred, who breaks his line of sight.//\n\n**Kinsey:** The GOC is under the UN banner.

The primary method of entry is by climbing 300 meters to the top of the temple via the front ramp. Currently, alternate routes are being devised, but construction of such routes has been delayed due to complications with the sanctity of the location enforced by on-site Oracles.\n\nThe front ramp is split down the middle with a flowing stream approximately 4 meters wide from within the temple. This stream would then connect to the Acheron River.\n\nThe symbolic significance behind PTE-0080 is its proximity to the Necromanteion of Acheron, a small structure that formerly hosted necromantic rituals used to commune with deceased ancestors. It is theorized that PTE-0080 is a refurbished project of the Necromanteion, hosted by the Oracles of the Dead, whose origins remain obscure. The means of construction of PTE-0080 remains unknown.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; background:#b5aa8a; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n\n##000000|It was a brisk afternoon.##\n\n##000000|Snow had already fallen, piling onto the ruins of a foregone civilization, blanketing the landscape with a white wonderland.

Its hands bared out of its heavy robes with a charcoal color and reached in through the opening where its head was supposed to be.

Parallel to the view, gray buildings with ancient Greek architectural influences cover the ground nearly endlessly within the grand cavern, blanketing a 10 km radius of visible underground land. Beyond such, it is covered in opaque smog, trickling in between buildings near the border. Large cave columns connect the ground with the stalactite-covered ceiling.

As seconds pass, his breathing becomes uneven, and he starts to shudder.//\n\n**Visage:** Enough!\n\n//Azrael gasps, exasperated and nearly tumbling back. Visage catches him by the shoulders.//\n\n**Azrael:** Wh-what was that?\n\n**Visage:** I said momentarily.\n\n**Azrael:** That could’ve meant anything.\n\n//Visage’s jaws tense as they frown slightly. The camera scans the area again.//\n\n**Azrael:** There’s... ghosts?\n\n**Visage:** They are called Nomads, spirits of the deceased who have elected not to reach the afterlife. They reside here eternally until time ceases, and they walk these same roads in tandem with us, invisible.\n\n//Silence elapses. After a brief period, Azrael sighs.//\n\n**Azrael:** I recognized one of the whispers.\n\n**Visage:** It is easy for a Nomad to find you.\n\n**Azrael:** May you ask for a William?\n\n//Visage lowers their head. Their mouth moves, but no sound emanates from them. After a moment, they face Azrael again.//\n\n**Visage:** He asks, did you send his son the letter?\n\n//The camera view remains frozen.//\n\n**Azrael:** Yes. Yes, William. He said he loved it.\n\n//Azrael chuckles.//\n\n**Azrael:** God, I—yes, William, your son is doing great. Charlie’s healthy, and he’s growing fast. Faster than you could ever imagine.\n\n//Azrael turns to Visage.//\n\n**Azrael:** Can he hear me?\n\n//Visage smiled.//\n\n**Visage:** He said thank you.\n\n**Azrael:** Is Alice here?\n\n//Visage shakes their head. The camera tilts down.//\n\n**Azrael:** You’re telling me, our fallen, those who decide to be Nomads, they’re stuck here for eternity?\n\n**Visage:** Per their choice.\n\n**Azrael:** Why?\n\n**Visage:** Each has their reasons, similar to why you’re here. Whether it’s to watch over, preserve identity, or rest eternally. I advise you not to listen for too long.\n\n**Azrael:** But you listen to them constantly? Is that why your eyes are covered?\n\n//Visage nods.//\n\n**Visage:** There are elevated forms of perception, but only for the trained mind.\n\n//Azrael turns to look down the road they walk on.//\n\n**Azrael:** You still haven’t really answered my question yet. Why me?\n\n//Visage kneels and sits on the road. The camera pans down, and they smile back. Azrael decides to do the same as the camera lowers.//\n\n**Visage:** As I say, you have your reason. Yours, in particular, is what dictated our decision. When Alexander the Great fell, Greece tasted vulnerability for the first time. The //Diadochi,// supposed heirs to the throne, tore Greece apart, leaving rubbles for Rome to conquer. I remember that very day; what a beautiful world tarnished by insurmountable rage. As I watched the Nekromanteion burn, it wasn’t just the Romans but all of humanity who forwent their integrity, succumbing to the wave of warriors infecting the lands with scorch and blood. They held an invigorated fire that was seemingly inextinguishable. A great fire fueled by vengeance. One that perpetuated conflict to no end. We, the Oracles, decided such a blind world was not worth keeping the dead in.\n\n//Visage brings their arms out.//\n\n**Visage:** And so they erected a utopia free from the noise above, eternally shrouded in serene darkness. A period of peace that would never witness the tearing and screaming of war again. It brought much-needed silence.\n\n**Azrael:** How did the temple topside come about?\n\n//Visage lowers their arms.//\n\n**Visage:** It only rose when we felt prudent enough to reveal ourselves once more—to give the humanity I saw that day a final chance to deny the fire that compels them.\n\n//The camera shakes as Azrael shifts.//\n\n**Azrael:** You know, my organization is tasked with destroying all paranormal phenomena. To take no unnecessary risks to allow potentially dangerous anomalies to roam the Earth. That’s what the Global Occult Coalition stands for. It was forged in fear of another world-scale disaster. It destroys what it’s afraid of, and you fall into that criteria.\n\n**Visage:** Yet, here you are.\n\n**Azrael:** Indeed. Here I am. So, why?\n\n//Visage shakes their head.//\n\n**Visage:** Of this innumerable loss your faction fell victim to, I have no doubt many rise in anger, wishing to exact revenge upon their fallen. But you differ. \n\n**Azrael:** How’s that?\n\n**Visage:** Have you considered joining your military?\n\n**Azrael:** No, why?\n\n//Visage smiles.//\n\n**Visage:** Lies are fruitless.\n\n**Azrael:** How would you know I’m lying?\n\n//Visage tilts their head and points to their ear. Azrael sighs.//\n\n**Visage:** I know too many hearts. I know the feeling of loss and the desire to lash out at the world—betray and abandon it, as it did to you. But you refused. You persisted.\n\n**Azrael:** Don’t get it twisted. I’m only here for selfish reasons.\n\n**Visage:** Who isn’t? Perhaps so. But here you are. You are evidence of my hopes that humanity can finally overlook the fire. You seek consultation over anger.\n\n**Azrael:** And what would anger have been for me?\n\n**Visage:** Inciting the impossible death of death. Force her to return into your embrace. And, after my disclosure, utter destruction in your wake.\n\n**Azrael:** Sounds a little hardcore.\n\n//Visage chuckles.//\n\n**Visage:** Azrael, you are the beacon. If the cycle of war, vengeance, and despair can be broken with a human’s will, no matter the trek ahead, my intuition in bringing about Acheron’s return is not in vain. In your world, Romans have burned your kingdom. But your humanity refused to follow suit. Your civilization mourns heavily, and that wave was felt stronger than the entrance of a thousand souls on that fateful day. And do not be mistaken; any human would be tempted by the fire. I have no doubt you will seek its strength. But your moderation has convinced me.\n\n//The camera follows as Visage stands up.//\n\n**Visage:** Where your people seek revenge, you wish to heal the impossible.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; background:#b5aa8a; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n\n##000000|If I could show him the invisible crowd he gathered at that moment, his patients watching him, I think it would’ve rekindled him within a second.##\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ EARWIG BUG TRANSCRIPTION||\n\n**Date:** January 13th, 2016\n**Device:** Azrael Silver’s Hazmat Bodycam\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Azrael approaches the river, its waves backtracking.//\n\n**Azrael:** Here?\n\n**Visage:** Yes.

Visage waves farewell. Azrael turns to the river and walks to it. The water retracts in anticipation before his boots hit it, and ripples converge on each step he takes. The camera submerges into the water, spume falling downward. Despite the environment, the audio feed picks up Azrael’s shallow breathing with clarity and minimal muffling.//\n\n//A faint rumbling emanates from afar. The view is tainted in a blue hue with warm, refracted candle lights peering through the water.

North America is far.\n\n**Azrael:** Shut up.\n\n**Vestige:** She disrespected you. She hates you. You should’ve let her pass peacefully and save the rest. You should’ve done your job. In my opinion, you are no healer. You are a harbinger of death.\n\n//Azrael turns to the dagger suspended in the air.//\n\n**Azrael:** What do you want me to do? What //did// you want me to do?\n\n//Azrael stepped forward to the dagger.//\n\n**Azrael:** I’ve thought about it: her words, her touch, her sad smile. I felt so angry at everything. The hospital, the coalition, everyone, but nothing came close to how much I hated myself. You’re right; I could’ve saved them. Even then...\n\n//Azrael’s voice breaks.//\n\n**Azrael:** I thought to myself, I would do it again. Even if I became the world’s enemy, I would’ve thrown it all away if it meant I could see her one last time. I would’ve forsaken everything. But what hurts the most is that I know she’ll hate me more than anything.\n\n//Azrael collapses to his knees and laughs.//\n\n**Azrael:** She was right. From all these sleepless nights, I couldn’t come to terms with it, but she was right. I realize that now. The fragility of life and how gifted we are to breathe, touch, and feel our hearts beat. I miss it so much already. I wish I could breathe. \n\n//Azrael wipes his eyes.//\n\n**Azrael:** I was afraid of taking things for granted, fearful that if I left for a second, I would find her dead in her bed. And even with that anxiety, she still died alone. I hate myself so much for that. I hate that I left her alone. I hate that my hands weren’t the last thing she felt. You know what she said? “I’m afraid. I don’t want to go.” Her awareness of life’s majesty and the terminality of death made her all the more scared. She always lived like it was her last day on Earth. Why did she have to die like this?

I wanted to save you so bad, bring you back from the dead, but you were right; nothing can be the same after someone crosses that threshold. And all those crimes finally weighed on my shoulders: neglecting my patients for you, disobeying my superiors, abandoning the hospital, everything. I understand if you’re mad, and I’m so sorry.\n\n**Azrael:** I didn’t stay because I was afraid of taking you for granted, I stayed because I was afraid of the moment you’ll die. I was frightened the entire way. I didn’t cherish anything. I didn’t even think of how you were still with me, feel my hands, or see my face. I was frightened. \n\n**Azrael:** I can’t imagine the weight I’ve put on your shoulders. And that truth tortured me the entire flight. I never thought once about you truly; only the fear of your death haunted me. I promise I won’t do that again. I will never do that again. I understand you now, and it’s always when it’s too late. But I understand now. I promise I’ll never be so mindlessly selfish again. \n\n//Azrael bows, sobbing.//\n\n**Azrael:** You were right. Living is a gift.

But that’ll do.\n\n//The caustic patterns on Azrael morph into striations, alternating between its original and distorted forms.

They said Alice’s death “shimmered in-between death and life” when she arrived in Acheron. Alice provided details regarding Azrael and his “hobby,” and Visage took interest immediately. That’s how they knew about that quillon dagger and everything else.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** How did she know about Acheron?\n\n**Nize:** Azrael. He talked about it more times than some of our guys. The setup however, was entirely her idea.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** Set up?\n\n**Nize:** Ah, right. This part isn’t recitation. The Vices and Charon initially intend to test Azrael's integrity. Charon hoped Azrael would accept Alice’s death, Visage tested if he could “overlook the fire,” and Vestige assessed how he would deal with a spirit. So, upon Visage’s acquired interest, given that the two knew Azrael would try to reach Acheron, Alice approached the situation with a bit more finesse and convinced the Vices to fake her unresponsiveness to see what Azrael might say. From there on, they would draw their own conclusions. Funnily enough, Vestige didn’t have to say much for all of their suspicions to be swept away.\n\n**D.C. al Fine:** An ambassador even in death.
