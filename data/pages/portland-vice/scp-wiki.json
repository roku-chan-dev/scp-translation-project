Every time a new bust is made, all the leads miraculously prove to be dead ends, with their target always one step ahead of them. With little help from the Unusual Incidents Unit, MTF Commander Damian Creed and Thaumatologist Beatrice Ross take matters into their own hands, only to find the trail leads close to home. Join us for a highly bingeable mystery, Those Twisted Pines style.\n\n-----\n\n**Tales:**\n\n* Part 1: [[[Closed Game]]]\n* Part 2: [[[Middlegame]]]\n* Part 3: [[[Breakthrough]]]\n* Part 4: [[[Bare King]]]\n\n-----\n\n**Supporting Documents:**\n* [[[All Hallows]]]\n* [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64 Dossier]]]\n* [[[Three Portlands Hub|Three Portlands Hub]]]\n* [[[Those Twisted Pines Hub]]]\n\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** portvice-spread-n.png\n> **Author:** [[*user JackalRelated]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/portland-vice SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
