It is 4:37 pm, and a young woman is still in bed. Yesterday, she had been berated by her landlord. The day before that, she had lost her job. Today, she is experiencing what is colloquially known as a \"depression spiral\". There isn't a single person who she feels she can ask for help, no family and no friends. While the lack of family was not her fault, the lack of substantial relationships was a direct symptom of her trauma. An absent father and a dead mother will do that to someone. As she allows herself to sink deeper and deeper into her own fears and sorrow, her thoughts begin to repeat themselves. The same words like a mantra echoing in her mind.\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n\"I should just give up.\"\n@@ @@\n\"I should just give up.\"\n@@ @@\n\"I should just give up.\"\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[>]]\n##blue|\"I don't think you should.\"##\n[[/>]]\n@@ @@\n= \"I don't believe that.\"\n@@ @@\n##purple|\"That's okay, but we don't see it that way.\"##\n@@ @@\n##ff851f|\"You really are far too hard on yourself.\"##\n@@ @@\n= \"I just keeping making mistake after mistake, over and over again.
