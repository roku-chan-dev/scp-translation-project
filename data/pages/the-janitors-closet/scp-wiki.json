You're also about to enter my personal living quarters. Yeah. I live in Site-30's broom closet. What of it? Anyway, if you go in there, you're gonna find a bunch of mops and some papers I found. Those papers are my own business, and I'd rather you not read them. Cool?\"\n\n\"-Janitor Worth\"\n\n//You enter the closet to find a bunch of mops, brooms, a bucket or two.
