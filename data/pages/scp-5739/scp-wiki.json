On a biweekly schedule, two D-Class personnel are to clean SCP-5739's containment unit and to gather any SCP-5739-1 instances.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-5739 are contained in a storage folder in the cryostorage wing of Site-73. Legible SCP-5739-1 instances are to be recorded and stored in the aforementioned unit. Personnel with a clearance level of 2 or higher are permitted to access the remains of SCP-5739.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5739 was a 1.5-meter tall biological entity composed entirely of human epidermises. Despite its composition, SCP-5739 maintained a rigid structure resembling a pachyderm cranium. Prior to neutralization, SCP-5739 hovered approximately two meters above any surface at all times.\n\nSCP-5739-1 instances are 35-centimeter x 35-centimeter divisions of SCP-5739 that have physically detached from SCP-5739 by a process that is similar to exfoliative dermatitis[[footnote]] A disease that causes inflammation and scaling in the skin. [[/footnote]]. SCP-5739-1 instances have English phrases etched into them by what has been hypothesized to be human fingernails. Examples of SCP-5739-1 instances have been recorded below. Given their potential significance, each SCP-5739-1 instance is to be given a unique designation. \n\n**Discovery:** On 04/12/2015, 12-year-old Emily Coleâ€™s body was discovered in her place of residence in Omaha, Nebraska. The entirety of her skin was absent from her corpse. SCP-5739 was recorded levitating above Emily's body, motionless. Emily Cole's older brother, Albert Cole, contacted the local police station over a telephone call, where he was intercepted by an embedded Foundation agent working within the police force. Albert Cole exhibited extreme anxiety during his required interview; turning to look into empty hallways, being startled at mild contact with objects, and disregarding personnel. He was amnesticized shortly after and all symptoms ceased.\n\nThe following SCP-5739-1 instance was located beside Emily Cole's corpse.\n\n**SCP-5739-1-1:**\n> RESTLESSLY LEND\n> UNKNOWN BLEND\n> NEWLY DISTEND\n> \n> ABSENTLY MEND\n> WEND AROUND THE BEND\n> ASCEND\n> YOU CANNOT PRETEND\n> \n> ELEPHANT FRIEND\n> MY DEAREST FRIEND\n> I DO NOT TEND\n> LIKE YOU INTEND\n> YOUR END\n\n**Addendum 5739-1:** SCP-5739 has exhibited no notable behavior since its containment. DNA testing has determined that SCP-5739 is composed of epidermal tissue belonging to multiple unidentified individuals.\n\nIncidents that mirror SCP-5739's Discovery have been recovered from multiple eyewitness accounts in Omaha, Nebraska. All of these eyewitness accounts were gathered within a psychiatric ward. These patients were all diagnosed with prolonged mass hysteria. Albert Cole is placed on a psychological trauma watchlist.\n\n The following SCP-5739-1 instance was recovered directly underneath SCP-5739 within its cell shortly after genetic testing.\n\n**SCP-5739-1-2:**\n> COVER THE SOUND\n> ALL BUT THE WESTBOUND\n> NOTICE THE BACKGROUND\n> \n> YOULL COME AROUND\n> OTHERWISE UNFOUND\n> UNSPEAKINGLY DROWNED\n> \n> HEAR THEIR SOUND\n> ENCASED AND WOUND\n> ADMITTEDLY UNFOUND\n> REALIZED THEIR POUND\n> \n> MESSAGES UNBOUND\n> ELEPHANT FOUND\n\n**Addendum 5739-2:** On 27/12/2015, security footage showed SCP-5739 experiencing minute convulsions. 1 minute and 26 seconds proceeding the beginning of the convulsions SCP-5739 forcefully ruptured, covering the surrounding area with its remains.\n\nTwo D-Class personnel were instructed to enter SCP-5739's containment cell and clear the security cameras of all debris. Upon closer examination, all remains of SCP-5739 appeared to be SCP-5739-1 instances. 99.62% of the SCP-5739-1 instances were illegible due to congealing between instances and a large quantity of what was later determined to be sweat. The remaining SCP-5739-1 instances were determined to be non-anomalous, and an official cleaning crew was dispatched. The following is a transcript of the inscriptions on the recovered SCP-5739-1 instances.\n\n**SCP-5739-1-3:**\n> IF YOU WERE IN\n> THOSE PEOPLE THAT BEGIN\n> \n> THE PAPER THIN\n> OUTSIDE LOOKING IN\n> OBSERVE THE DIN\n> KNOWINGLY THIN\n> \n> THERE IS A SIN\n> HOUSED INSIDE SKIN\n> ELEPHANT GRIN\n> ITS ALWAYS BEEN\n> RELEASE THE TWIN\n> \n> SOULS INSIDE SKIN\n> KEEP DEEP WITHIN\n> I FEEL THE TWIN\n> NEVER WILL YOU WIN\n\n**SCP-5739-1-4:**\n> LITTLE YOU CAN SCREAM\n> EMPTY YOU WILL TEEM\n> THEY HEAR YOU SCREAM\n> \n> USELESSLY SCHEME\n> SCREAMING UPSTREAM\n> \n> DID YOU DREAM\n> IN SOFTENED GLEAM\n> ELEPHANT SEAM\n\n**SCP-5739-1-5:**\n> WHAT FUN\n> HAVE YOU WON\n> ATTEMPTED RUN\n> THE PRICE OF FUN\n> \n> HELL MUST RUN\n> AWAY FROM ONE\n> VARIETY BUT ONE\n> EVERYONE\n> \n> WHEN YOU ARE NONE\n> EVER SO DONE\n> \n> DONE\n> ONLY UNSPUN\n> NO NEED FOR FUN\n> ELEPHANT WON\n\n**SCP-5739-1-6:**\n> GATHER INSIDE\n> OUR SMALL STRIDE\n> OTHERS TRIED\n> DIED\n> BECKON THE TIDE\n> YOU CAN CONFIDE\n> ELEPHANT HIDE\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5738]]] | SCP-5739 | [[[SCP-5740]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** ELEPHANTFRIEND.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Supposedly Spooky]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5739 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
