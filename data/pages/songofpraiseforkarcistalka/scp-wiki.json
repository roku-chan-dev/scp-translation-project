It was first recorded by foundation operatives in 1993, and has been documented several dozen times since. Each recording occurred during SCP-2133-1's working hours, with three or more singers participating in each recorded instance. It should be noted that lyrical accuracy has been prioritized over maintaining the rhythm of the original.\n\n> We toil yet-endless in fields that feed not\n> We breathe affliction[[footnote]] Translator's note: Originally \"Baihteuk\" a word meaning both illness and gift, depending on context  [[/footnote]], offer our bodies\n> We commune in the fissure temple, red\n> We work in rows for her harvest, red too\n> \n> We work yet-endless in fields that feed not\n> We cleanse from sin, repent with addled[[footnote]] Translator's note: Originally \"Maušae\" a word roughly meaning \" altered or reconstructed\", carries largely positive connotations [[/footnote]] hands\n> We work for her, long for her bosom, red\n> We work in rows for her harvest, red too\n> \n> We die yet-endless in fields that feed not\n> We do not reach paradise, forgotten\n> We are bred, carried, born in the earth, red\n> We work in rows for her harvest, red too\n> \n> We grow[[footnote]] Translator's note: Originally \"Vipevá\" a word meaning \"a cyclical or stable mutation\", not implying an increase in number, sometimes used to refer to the growth of a child, hence the use of \"grow\" in this translation opposed to alternatives such as \"Mutate\", \"propagate\" or \"continue\" [[/footnote]] yet-endless in fields that feed not\n> we work in rows for her harvest, red",
