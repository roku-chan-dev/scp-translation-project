Nevertheless, significant deviations from the typical course of events experienced over the previous nineteen iterations were observed.

Blank sits down at his designated workstation. He sighs.\n\n**18:21:25** | Dr. R. Wirth appears at his own workstation. Dr. Blank pointedly ignores him.\n\n**18:22:06** | Dr. Blank eyes Dr. Wirth solemnly, then checks his watch. He asks, \"How are you feeling?\"\n\n**18:22:13** | Dr. Wirth looks up from his lunchbox, which he has just found empty. \"Hungry, I guess,\" he responds.\n\n**18:22:21** | The scheduled rupture of 14 processing tanks is heard from outside the laboratory.\n\n**18:22:25** | As scheduled, Dr. Blank remarks, \"What was that?\"\n\n**18:22:32** | \"Goddamned Occultists,\" Wirth mutters as he leaves to inspect the source of the disruption.\n\n**18:22:38** | Dr. Blank sighs and rests his head against his desk.\n\n**18:22:41** | Camera feed flickers, depicting Dr. Blank in the same position he had been in nineteen seconds prior.\n\n**18:22:44** | To no one in particular, Dr. Blank remarks, \"What was that?\"\n\n**18:22:49** | Dr. Blank scans his surroundings in apparent confusion. \"Reuben?\"\n\n**18:22:55** | Dr. Blank leaves his seat, walking toward the exit and leaving camera view.\n\n**18:23:00** | Camera feed flickers, depicting Dr. Blank in the same position he had been in nineteen seconds prior.\n\n**18:23:03** | To no one in particular, Dr. Blank remarks, \"What was that?\"\n\n**18:23:05** | Dr. Blank jumps from his seat, gasping and wide-eyed. He turns around in a circle, then sprints out of the room.\n\n**18:23:19** | Camera feed flickers, depicting Dr. Blank in the same position he had been in nineteen seconds prior.\n\n//Dr. Blank is forced to repeat the nineteen-second loop a total of nineteen times, becoming visibly more anxious with each iteration.//\n\n**18:28:42** | Dr. Blank falls to the floor of the laboratory and curls into a fetal position, rocking back and forth.\n\n**18:29:30** | Security and Containment personnel arrive.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Aftermath:** Dr. Blank vaguely recalled the events of the former nineteen iterations of the loop, and was treated for anxiety attack symptoms. No apparent containment failure.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[table class=\"tableb\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nIncident Report AAFD-I-123\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 8 September 2021\n**Officer of Record:** D. Ibanez (Chief of Pursuit and Suppression)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n\n**Summary:** Chief D. Ibanez reported an unusual deviation from expected 5243 phenomenon during the execution of her containment duties.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Security Transcript**\n\n**Camera:** SCC-001\n\n----\n\n//Camera view shows the Security and Containment Section bullpen. Chief D. Ibanez is leaning on the wall, alone.//\n\n**18:23:20:** | Agents A. Mukami, J. Gwilherm, and S. Radcliffe appear in their 2002 locations, mid-conversation. Agent Mukami is in the midst of exclaiming: \"--inks D-class personnel are sold //en masse// to the Foundation by an anomalous smarmy salesman with a spray tan, who only shows up if you write up a really wasteful experiment schedule.\"\n\n**18:23:32** | The agents laugh. Chief Ibanez feigns laughter.\n\n**18:23:39** | Chief Ibanez shakes her head, and says \"Thank god he's never gonna be responsible for anything important.\"\n\n**18:23:45** | The agents resume their paperwork. Chief Ibanez watches each of them in turn, frowning.\n\n**18:24:20** | The S&C bullpen redline rings. Agent Gwilherm presses the intercom button, and acknowledges the call.\n\n**18:24:21** | A high-pitched gargling sound overlaid on a low-pitched wail fills the air for three seconds. Chief Ibanez stares at the telephone in shock.\n\n**18:24:24** | Agent Gwilherm says \"Go ahead, sir.\"\n\n**18:24:25** | The sound resumes for five seconds. A crackling sound, like dry twigs being snapped, is now underlaid beneath the gargling and wailing.\n\n**18:25:30** | Agent Gwilherm says \"Yes, sir,\" and deactivates the intercom.\n\n**18:25:31** | Chief Ibanez stares at her agents. They stare back at her, apparently confused by her lack of action.\n\n**18:24:32** | Chief Ibanez says \"Uh,\" appears to rally, then says \"You heard the man! You three, double time!\" She points at them in quick succession.\n\n**18:24:33** | All three agents leave the bullpen. Chief Ibanez approaches the intercom, gingerly deactivates it, then watches it warily for seventeen seconds before leaving the room.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Aftermath:** All three agents arrived at their appointed demises on-schedule. No apparent containment failure.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[table class=\"tableb\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nIncident Report AAFD-I-124\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 8 September 2021\n**Officer of Record:** H. Kuroki (Chief of Security and Containment)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n\n**Summary:** An anomalous incident occurred in High-Priority Cold Storage Facility 3, where the remains of Dr. A. Zlat치 from five prior occurrences of SCP-5243 (282 half-lemons) are kept frozen.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Security Transcript**\n\n**Camera:** CSF-003\n\n----\n\n//Static view of Cold Storage Unit 14.//\n\n**18:25:05** | Camera feed flickers.\n\n**18:25:09** | Cold Storage Unit 14 buckles outward. A single steel bolt strikes the camera at high velocity, shattering the lens. Feed continues.\n\n**18:25:18** | Muffled sounds from within Cold Storage Unit 14.\n\n**18:25:29** | Dramatic temperature increase detected within Cold Storage Unit 14. Automatic safeguards engaged. The unit unlocks, but its door does not open due to structural damage.\n\n**18:25:29** | The door to Cold Storage Unit 14 opens partially. A human hand can be seen grasping for purchase.\n\n**18:25:36** | Something heavy strikes the door to Cold Storage Unit 14 from the inside, pushing it farther ajar. Muffled shouts of pain.\n\n**18:25:49** | The door to Cold Storage Unit 14 bursts open. Five individuals in standard issue Foundation researcher apparel emerge, single file, falling into a heap on the floor.\n\n**18:26:09** | Security and Containment personnel arrive.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Aftermath:** All five individuals were subsequently identified as Dr. A. Zlat치, and treated for severe hypothermia. Psychological counselling is ongoing.\n\nAs typical for SCP-5243 occurrences, an instance of Dr. Zlat치 materialized in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D at 18:24 hours and was transmuted into forty-seven half-lemons. Three of the resurrected Zlat치s have expressed interest in handling these remains; these requests have been denied pending Psychology and Parapsychology reports on their mental and emotional stability.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[table class=\"tableb\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nIncident Report AAFD-I-125\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 8 September 2021\n**Officer of Record:** H.

Wettle encountered an unusual deviation from expected 5243 phenomenon during the execution of his containment duties.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Security Transcript**\n\n**Camera:** RES-017\n\n----\n\n//A regularly-panning camera view shows the primary adjoining hallway to the Research & Experimentation Section, south side.//\n\n**18:25:35** | The sound of a door opening, then shutting, is heard. The camera pans right.\n\n**18:25:43** | Dr. W. Wettle paces into camera view. He is equipped with elbow and knee pads, and a bicycle helmet.\n\n**18:25:49** | Dr. Wettle mutters \"Just get it over with,\" repeatedly. He takes a deep breath and proceeds northward down the hallway.\n\n**18:25:55** | Agents A. Mukami, J. Gwilherm and S. Radcliffe come around the corner and into view, not yet noticing Dr. Wettle. The camera pans left.\n\n**18:26:01** | Dr. Wettle undergoes his scheduled collision with the aforementioned agents. All four individuals fall to the floor.\n\n**18:26:10** | The agents recuperate and continue down the hallway, eventually leaving camera view. Dr. Wettle lies still.\n\n**18:26:23** | Dr. Wettle gradually sits up, removing his helmet. He glances down either side of the hallway, before pumping his fist into the air. He yells, \"NOT ONE SCRATCH, FUCKERS!\"\n\n**18:26:43** | The camera pans right, then left. Six bright blue disembodied legs have manifested around Dr. Wettle's person. He eyes them warily.\n\n**18:26:48** | Dr. Wettle attempts to stand before the legs begin kicking wildly, causing him to collapse on the floor.\n\n**18:29:00** | The camera pans right, then left. The legs have de-manifested. Dr. Wettle groans, re-equipping his helmet, and lies motionless.\n\n**18:40:00** | Security and Containment personnel arrive.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Aftermath:** Dr. Wettle was treated for major bruising. Treatment for minor emotional trauma was deferred.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n----\nThe cause of these deviations remains uncertain. Site-43 personnel are to report any further anomalous activity on-Site to the Security and Containment Section immediately.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nWe don't know what the hell this was about, and to be perfectly frank, the ideal outcome is this: we never find out, and it never becomes important. Nevertheless, until further notice, all personnel should consider the Site on permanent Gamma-One alert status.\n\nMaybe the Zlat치s will have some insight, once we convince them they're not a pile of lemons anymore.\n[[>]]\n//-- D.
