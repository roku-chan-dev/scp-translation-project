Area-81JH Intelligence Division is to monitor for intrusions into lower narrative levels and prevent them when detected.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2955-JP is a humanoid anomaly of variable appearance manifesting during tests with [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2650-jp|SCP-2650-JP]]]. The anomaly affects human subjects who have been transferred from the universe in which this report was created (hereafter referred to as the base universe) into a lower narrative level, primarily through the anomalous effects of SCP-2650-JP. These subjects are altered to have the appearance consistent with that of the characters within the lower narrative level. This transformation consists of not only appearance but the physical structure of the subject's body and clothes. Behavioral changes have also been observed. In addition, it has been reported that affected individuals gain the abilities ascribed to the character they resemble, such as immortality and abilities that contravene the laws of physics, which have been classified under subspecies thaumaturgy.\n\nSCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties occur when a subject has been transferred from the base universe into the lower narrative level, which is then altered in some way. Initially, the Foundation had only speculative information about SCP-2955-JP. However, this report has been prepared based on cases observed by the Foundation, as well as several cases that were subsequently confirmed. For further information, please refer to SCP-2650-JP Experiment Log 2650-66.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f0f8ff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n__**Experiment Log 2650-66 - ████/██/██**__\n\n**Procedure:** D-4505 was provided with photography equipment and 8 years' worth of life-sustaining supplements, and disappeared along with SCP-2650-JP, with the aim of procuring information when D-4505 returned in some form.\n\n**Result:** After approximately 1 year, SCP-2650-JP was recovered, containing an object thought to be the body of D-4505. SCP-2650-JP also contained the photography equipment supplied to D-4505, from which video material has been successfully retrieved.\n\nD-4505 had acquired immortality during its disappearance, and recovered from its dead state a few minutes after opening SCP-2650-JP. However, its external appearance differed significantly from its previous appearance, instead resembling \"Remilia Scarlet\", a character from the //Touhou Project// series[[footnote]]Translator's note: Touhou Project is a series of vertical bullet hell shoot-'em-up games developed by Team Shanghai Alice, a one-man team consisting of Jun'ya \"ZUN\" Ota. It is known for its large fanbase and wide array of characters. In particular, Remilia Scarlet is one of the more well-known characters from the franchise, having debuted in the first Windows era game, //Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil//.[[/footnote]]. \n\nThe recovered photography equipment shows D-4505 transforming into Remilia Scarlet while standing on what appears to be the roof of a building. In addition, a few days after the transformation, D-4505 appeared again on the rooftop, and was irradiated with visible heat rays by an unidentified object circling in the air. D-4505 appeared to be vaporized by the heat. It is assumed that D-4505 was temporarily killed by these visible heat rays and stored in SCP-2650-JP. The phenomenon that caused D-4505 to transform into Remilia Scarlet is currently unconfirmed.\n\n**Analysis:** D-4505's body reacts violently to ultraviolet light; subject claims to feel pain when exposed to sunlight. Wings similar to those of bats (//Chiroptera//) extend from D-4505's shoulder blades, giving D-4505 the ability to fly. D-4505's body is able to transform into mist or bats, and additionally is able to act while in this state. D-4505's physical abilities have been anomalously increased, acting as if it transcends established laws of physics in its movements. As previously stated, D-4505 has gained immortality and can regenerate itself even when physically destroyed. Although this has not been confirmed due to difficulty of observation, D-4505 has also acquired the ability to observe and/or determine the future.\n\nAlthough D-4505 was a 59-year-old male prior to the experiment, its physical characteristics had become those of a young female. There have also been significant changes in D-4505's psychological profile, notably that the abnormal obsession with money that D-4505 originally possessed has not been observed. In addition, D-4505's memories prior to the experiment have been replaced with memories as Remilia Scarlet.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 1:** Information\n\nSCP-2955-JP's anomalous properties had not been discussed for an extended period of time due to the difficulty in obtaining information about it. As SCP-2650-JP is an object that is based in universes outside the base universe. The most pertinent information on SCP-2955-JP was obtained when Area-81JH was resolving an incident caused by GoI-093 \"PAMWAC\", which had been classified as separate from the anomaly. The following documents are excerpts from the internal BBS used by GoI-093. The circumstances leading to their acquisition have been redacted by order of the Facility Management Committee of Area-81JH, with regard to the current countermeasures against the related GoI.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n+ All About Remilia-chan Thread part563\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n221: [[size larger]]##green|◆ge2212IK## [[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:???##\n----\nHas the Mistress[[footnote]]A slang term used by fans to refer to Remilia Scarlet.[[/footnote]] been ElMA'd?\nAm I wrong here?\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n222: [[size larger]]##green|Indomitable Anonymous## [[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:??？##\n----\n##blue|>>221##\nOf course she is?

The term \"ElMA'd\" has been determined to be used on GoI-093's internal BBS to refer to \"using ElMA to abduct a character from its native setting\". Members of GoI-093 have avoided using the techniques associated with ElMA, and appeared to express a sense of urgency regarding the matters suggested in this post. Area-81JH has identified a post that appears to be the source of this response. The following is the full text in question.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n+ 【Important】Announcement Thread\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n11: [[size larger]]##green|Hara Shisui◆SASAAAi## ##red|★##[[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:???##\n----\nSince there have been a lot of new people, and it seems that a lot of you are taking ElMA lightly, I'll take this time to remind you of why using ElMA is forbidden.\n\nThe anime characters we want to marry are 2D, and they live in a lower narrative level to the world we live in. We're 3D, and they're 2D, as you probably already understand.\n\nHere's where it gets complicated. These 2D worlds' rules are set by us 3D beings. \n\nLuffy's arm can extend, Golgo 13's a skilled sniper, Hazama Kuroo is an unlicensed doctor. All that is determined by the creators of the story, who exist in the 3D world, saying \"this is how that world works\". No matter how hard Luffy struggles, he can't save Ace, and the surgery to save Dr. Honma won't succeed. Why? Because the author said so.\n\nIt's called the \"absoluteness of the lower narrative levels\" because no matter how much the inhabitants of a 2D world try, they can't change the future (setting) that the author has determined. If the author doesn't change the setting, the world won't change on its own.\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n12: [[size larger]]##green|Hara Shisui◆SASAAAi## ##red|★##[[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:???##\n----\nAlright, so the real question. Why is using ElMA banned?\n\nUsing ElMA to call out 2D characters uses the ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy, which is an external method that ignores the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. The ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy itself says you can call out anything you want from other universes, and as long as you stick to that purpose, it's not that dangerous.\n\nHowever, calling out 2D characters is different. When you bring a character out of the 2D world, they're gone from that world. For good.\n\nBreaking the absoluteness of lower narrative levels has a lot of bad side effects. For instance, changing other existences into that character for consistency. The original being loses all its memories up to that point, and the change is permanent. \n\n... Just for that, some people think that it can be abused, but we have a problem with what happens next.\n\nAfter the alteration, there will be two characters - one in each world - but the one who isn't in the 2D world is weakened due to being freed from the absoluteness of lower narrative levels.\n\nAs a simple example, there are characters who outright break the laws of physics, right? These characters maintain their existence because of the absoluteness of lower narrative levels. If they are freed from this property, they cannot live the way they are. They die a tragic death.\n\nIf you really love that character, stay the hell away from this. When these consistency changes happen, that image of a lovely waifu will fall apart. And nobody wants that to happen.\n\nAlthough there are other reasons why ElMA is banned, this is the general gist of it. If you see anyone who might be using ElMA on the boards, make sure to tell us about it immediately. Thank you.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 2:** Situation Report\n\nArea-81JH Intelligence Division discovered a post announcing that the character Remilia Scarlet had been summoned from the lower narrative level \"//Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.//\" on GoI-093's internal BBS. The contents suggested that the poster was a follower of Eden leap Mutual Aid, and may have used the ElMA Holy Seal Thaumaturgy. This was also known to the administrators of GoI-093 at the time, who attempted to identify the person responsible for the post.\n\nUpon receiving this information, the Foundation conjectured that SCP-2955-JP's anomalies and D-4505's transformation occured due to an unknown individual abducting Remilia Scarlet from the setting of //Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.//, and that the resulting disappearance of Remilia Scarlet from the setting caused D-4505, who had been transferred to that narrative setting at the time, to transform into Remilia Scarlet.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n+ I'm counting down the days until my idol from my teenage years marries me lol\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n22: [[size larger]]##green|◆dnn87qI## [[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:???##\n----\nJust need to prepare the documents and that's it...\nRemilia herself has already come over to our world\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n23: [[size larger]]##green|Shackled Anonymous## [[/size]]##gray|████/██/██(█) ██:██:██:██ ID:???##\n----\nLooks like a troll...\nHow did you do it?

Area-81JH Intelligence Division has received information that the individual in question no longer resides in Koigarezaki, but further information on his whereabouts remain unknown,\n\nD-4505 is currently on life support provided by the Foundation; however, the subject's physical deterioration continues. An attempt to return D-4505 to the lower narrative level \"//Touhou Koumakyou ~ the Embodiment of Scarlet Devil.//\" in order to preserve its state has been attempted, but as the attempt was obstructed by an unknown individual, it has been considered a failure. D-4505 is projected to lose vital signs within the next few days.",
