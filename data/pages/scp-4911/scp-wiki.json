The structure of SCP-4911 follows drystack techniques, common for retaining walls during the Neolithic Age. SCP-4911 is made up of a variety of dark and light colored stones, totaling to 5,203. There are three distinctly patterned sections in SCP-4911, with some occasional protrusions. Removal or damage to the stones of SCP-4911 is not possible and not advised. \n\nSCP-4911 exhibits strong mnestic properties. Visitors to SCP-4911 and the mound will remember vivid details about the area, and also be aware of the precise number of the 5,203 stones of SCP-4911. The significance of the number is unclear. The memories produced by SCP-4911 have been resistant to all known forms of amnestic treatments. \n\nBehind SCP-4911, at the top of the mound, is a single stone plinth inscribed with deteriorated runes. Thaumaturgic analysis indicate that if the runes were properly maintained, they would have been used to keep a permanent flame at the top of the plinth. \n\nOther than the plinth, no other inscriptions are found around SCP-4911. All historical records of SCP-4911 describe the area in its current state; no historical records have indicated the function or reason of SCP-4911. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** wall.jpg\n> **Name:** Newgrange from right side\n> **Author:** Cary Bass-Deschenes\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/14429081@N00/3877944375/\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4910]]] | SCP-4911 | [[[SCP-4912]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
