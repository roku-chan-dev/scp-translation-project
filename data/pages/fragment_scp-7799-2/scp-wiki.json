Fuck yes!\" Amelia exclaimed, unable to contain the surge of emotions that washed over her. Her heart raced as she pumped her fist in the air, the rush of adrenaline accompanying the opening of the second file. Could this file hold the answers she so desperately sought? Could it offer a glimmer of assurance that there might indeed be life after death?\n\nAs the file loaded on her computer screen, she leaned in, trying to scroll through the loading file. The possibility of seeing her loved ones again, even after her own passing... she couldn't put her thoughts together.\n\nShe took a deep breath, trying to steady herself amidst the whirlwind of emotions.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**  Due to SCP-7799's specific location, direct containment is deemed unfeasible. It would necessitate the dissolution of numerous religions, the disbandment of the Tactical Theology Department, and significant resources, which is not viable. Instead, the SCP Foundation has implemented the Astronomical Isolation Protocol (AIP) to prevent the dissemination of information related to SCP-7799's existence and location. Astronomical surveillance measures are utilized to monitor SCP-7799 remotely, without physical interaction.[[footnote]] **Cernunnos:** Item can be functionally contained, but the Foundation cannot achieve this for logistical and/or ethical reasons. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7799 is a large colony of space-dwelling jellyfish located several light years away from the Milky Way galaxy. Upon the death of any sentient being, a new entity manifests within SCP-7799.\n\nEntities within SCP-7799 possess counter-memetic[[footnote]] A counter-meme is a memetic effect that obscures information relating to itself via the creation of different information.[[/footnote]] properties. Any individual who becomes aware of the existence of SCP-7799 or the afterlife-related phenomenon linked to it will invariably develop a strong inclination to believe in alternate afterlife concepts. These beliefs will be reinforced and spread to others through subtle memetic influences, hindering the spread of information regarding SCP-7799.\n\nAdditionally, individuals who learn about SCP-7799 are compelled to establish communities or groups to explore and discuss various afterlife theories. Upon the death of any individual involved in such a community, their consciousness is believed to merge with SCP-7799. This process leads to the reformation of these individuals' ideas and beliefs, which, in turn, perpetuates the cycle of community formation and dissolution.\n\nSCP-7799 is sentient and communicates as a collective entity, with its voice frequently shifting between manifestations.\n\n**Interview:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**[The following log is a transcription of communications between Foundation Probe Satellite P-27 and SCP-7799. The probe satellite is equipped with advanced memetic containment protocols to ensure no harmful effects are transmitted. Dr. Amelia Clark is communicating through it.]**\n\n**[BEGIN LOG.]**\n\n**Dr. Clark:** Testing, testing... Can you hear me?\n\n**SCP-7799:** We hear you nice and clear, dearie. It's a pleasure.\n\n**Dr. Clark:** Ah, it speaks english! (To Dr. Ginnsbury) Okay, uh, wasn't entirely sure, you said that it would be some anomalous language...\n\n**SCP-7799:** Parliamo molte lingue, tesoro.[[footnote]] \"We speak many languages, darling.\" [[/footnote]]\n\n**Dr. Clark:** Right, right. Uh, lets see here... why exactly do you spread this counter-meme?\n\n**SCP-7799:** Is that what you call it? Well, it's not complicated. We simply want to create a community between you folk.\n\n**Dr. Clark:** But they only see stars, right? People just stare off into space and get this idea, why, or actually...how, do you do that?\n\n**SCP-7799:** I can't exactly answer a question like that. Someone thousands of years ago, some cave folk had this idea. We saw people dying in the cold, afraid that this was all that there was, that there were no forms of safety, their last moments would be eternally cold.... it's comforting.\n\n**Dr. Clark:** What do you mean? You made fake afterlives to comfort people?\n\n**SCP-7799:** Correct. It makes people behave. The idea of Hell is something nobody enjoys, but the idea of eternal paradise in dozens of other groups is comforting, is it not? A loving embrace after you pass on, seeing those you love... if we had everyone believe and know about us, it would create some discord, sadly. We want to fill in different niches, have different people enjoy different things.\n\n**Dr. Clark:** Okay, but... that just doesn't work in the end. There are wars, crusades, murders, people trying to justify horrible crimes with what you have given them. Aren't you just creating more hatred?\n\n**SCP-7799:** We unfortunately cannot manipulate those actions, but with every person hurt there is another that is comforted. Every bit of hate there is love to counteract it, right?\n\n**Dr. Clark:** But what about all the people? We got recordings from the afterlife, right? Right?\n\n**SCP-7799:** They were fabricated to keep up the illusion, although typically it doesn't align too well, we didn't really expect anyone looking into what happens after one dies. Shame, some folks in our colony had great ideas for the Three Moons...\n\n**Dr. Clark:** You say that, and it makes people want to live, but-\n\n**SCP-7799:** We've already read your mind, Amelia. It's a dark place, you poor thing... We  understand that. We have felt that time and time again, the feeling of anger, your own mortality comes crashing down, especially after...that.\n\n**Dr. Clark:** How exactly does //that// help? Just... It just... there's more people out there, hurt, suffering, and I can't do anything! I can't do a fucking thing, with my fear adding on them, and... and...\n\n**//Dr. Clark begins to breath heavily.//**\n\n**Dr. Clark:** Keep it professional, Clark...I'm sorry, I just...there's so much going on.\n\n**SCP-7799:** Being alone is a scary thing, as you know. Even if people enjoy solitude, they need companionship eventually. Think of it like this: being on an island suffering is something no poor soul should go through. Would having someone besides you help?\n\n**Dr. Clark:** I guess so? I...\n\n**//Dr. Clark sniffles.//**\n\n**Dr. Clark:** I think I see. And when I...\n\n**SCP-7799:** Hush. Don't think about it. Do what you must, focus on them. Your daughter needs the attention more than we do. We love you.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\"Guess that's it, huh?\" Amelia murmured softly to herself.\n\nAs if in response to her thoughts, a loud cough erupted from her tired and weakened throat, followed by a weary sniffle.\n\nShe looked up at the night sky.
