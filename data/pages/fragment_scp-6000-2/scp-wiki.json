As the information arm of Project FUSILLADE, Foundation resources are to be primarily dedicated to disinformation and concealment while a permanent containment or destruction solution is devised. Any unauthorized individuals entering the SCP-6000 Exclusion Zone are to be aggressively disincentivized. Further containment details can be found in Addendum 6000.3.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-6000 is a massive dimensional extrusion centered at 2° 9' 47.1816'' S and 55° 7' 35.9328'' W, in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. SCP-6000 represents the largest Class-W transportation gateway, colloquially known as a Way, ever encountered by the Foundation. SCP-6000 currently measures 19km from its northeast to southwest point. The area directly affected by SCP-6000's presence is significantly larger, and a temporary security perimeter has been established around the area at a diameter of 8km, designated the Exclusion Zone.\n\nSCP-6000 is growing at an unstable rate. Its presence has an adverse effect on plant and animal life in the Exclusion Zone. The degree of this effect (along with the size of the Exclusion Zone itself) increases proportionally with SCP-6000.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=14\n|speed=100\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=300px\n|url=smallsnek.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-6000-A, closeup. Hover to enlarge.\n]]\n\nSCP-6000-A is a sapient semi-ophidian organism discovered within the Exclusion Zone during initial reconnaissance of SCP-6000 (see Addendum 6000.2). It was found in a comatose state surrounded by human corpses. SCP-6000-A's connection with SCP-6000 is under investigation (see Addenda).\n\nSCP-6000 connects baseline reality with the extradimensional location known as the Wanderer's Library. The Wanderer's Library was first encountered by the Foundation in 1955, but evidence suggests it has played a crucial part in the development of human civilization since at least the beginning of recorded history (See Addendum 6000.1).\n\nSCP-6000 first appeared on December 21st, 2030, the summer solstice. Realtime satellite images of the Amazon rainforest suddenly displayed a significant visual anomaly, and a reconnaissance team was deployed to inspect the area.\n\n\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 6000.1\n+++ {{WANDERER'S LIBRARY BRIEFING}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=library.png|\n    caption=Nx-001, circa 1955. Photo slightly damaged.\n]]\n\n**The Wanderer's Library**, designated Nx-001, is an extradimensional Y-space comprised of a massive library of unclear size & boundaries which contains a potentially infinite amount of books, treatises, essays, and other forms of media and knowledge. Its collection purportedly covers the sum of all knowledge, but with a specific focus on elements of thaumaturgy and magic. The Foundation has been aware of the Library since 1955 when the Group of Interest known as the Serpent's Hand inadvertently exposed the location to Agents.\n\nThe Library is maintained by Librarians, entities that range in size and shape but are typically heavily modified humanoids specialized to the service and protection of Nx-001. Those who break the rules of the Library are subject to being transformed into Librarians to work off their debt. This fate has befallen a number of Foundation personnel.\n\nNx-001 is closely connected to GoI-014, the Serpent's Hand. The Hand are known to use the Library as a meeting and staging point for operations due to the relative safety it offers. Numerous attempts have been made by Foundation and GOC forces to penetrate into the Library, but almost all have failed.\n\nThe Foundation, along with the GOC and Chaos Insurgency, were originally barred from the Library due to the Library's opinions on those who attempt to suppress the abnormal, but have in recent years relaxed their stance. Site-19 Director Tilda Moose has had extensive experience with the Wanderer's Library and the Serpent's Hand as a former Type-Blue entity, and has given several security briefings on the topic.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN FILE◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN EXCERPT>>**\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=tilly.png|\n    caption=Director Tilda Moose.|\n    align=left\n]]\n\n**MOOSE:** \"Extradimensional\" is the technical term, though not very descriptive. The Library isn't on our world, though it's connected to it. You reach it through Ways. Ways are a network of… basically magic portals that take you from one place to another. They're scattered around the world. A Way can be anything you can picture as a door. Or anything like a door. A cave, an archway, the back of a truck. Some of them are just art pieces — I once used a picture of a door to enter the Library, back when I still could.\n\nOh, yes. I used to be a Librarygoer. That was a long time ago, though. Back when I ran with other groups.\n\nYeah, it's... I suppose otherworldly, is the best word for it. Nothing quite compares. The architecture and decorations are... they're not alive, but they're mutable, always changing. When I frequented, the place was on an Art Deco kick. You could look up and see the constellations on the false ceiling.\n\nThat all ended when I joined the Foundation, though. The Library does not like us, to say the least. Especially not me. No, I would not like to talk about it. Moving on...\n\n----\n= **<<END EXCERPT>>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 6000.2\n+++ {{INITIAL ENCOUNTERS}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ UNEXPLAINED EVENT REPORT\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image bubble4.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nSCP-6000, aerial shot.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n**__LOCATION:__** Amazon Basin, Brazil (2° 9' 47.1816'' S and 55° 7' 35.9328'' W)\n\n**__STATUS:__** Ongoing\n\n**__TIME:__** 11:49 AM (local time) December 21 -- Present\n\n**__DISRUPTION CLASS:__** Keneq\n\n----\n**__EVENT SUMMARY:__** Large visual and spatial anomaly 0.5km in length, resembling an iridescent 'rip' in space.

A RES/CON team and a fireteam from MTF Sigma-3 (\"Bibliographers\") were immediately deployed to the location. They found the surveillance team's equipment and supplies, but none of the three members. Tracks leading away from the site indicated that they had gone into what is now the Exclusion Zone. \n[[include component:image-block name=forest2.png|\n    caption=CHICAGO team. | width=400px\n]]\nWhile searching for the missing reconnaissance team, personnel discovered the corpses of twelve unknown individuals dressed in robes, at the foot of a thaumaturgic ritual circle. In the center of the circle was SCP-6000-A, coiled and in a comatose state. The entity was quickly airlifted into containment at Facility-57.\n\nIn the interim, one of the fireteams was outfitted for an expedition into SCP-6000. Due to her extensive experience with Nx-001, Ways, and the Serpent's Hand, Director Moose was flown in from Facility-57, where she was on an administrative visit, to accompany the fireteam.\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN FILE◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n**MTF SIGMA-3 \"BIBLIOGRAPHERS\" -- FIRETEAM CHICAGO**\n* CHICAGO-ONE: //ADAM MACMILLAN//\n* CHICAGO-TWO: //TILDA MOOSE//\n* CHICAGO-THREE: //NAYRA FLORES//\n* CHICAGO-FOUR: //ESTEBAN BARDEM//\n----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n\n**CHICAGO-ONE:** Beginning approach to SCP-6000.

On December 23rd, SCPOVERCOM, then known as Overwatch Command, authorized the first series of containment and mitigation protocols for the //in situ// containment of SCP-6000. These were packaged together as Project FUSILLADE. \n\n* The designation of Facility-57 as official containment facility of SCP-6000.\n* The construction of a fence around the Exclusion Zone to deter wildlife and travelers.\n* The requisition of resources for the long-term study of SCP-6000.\n* The arrest of known cells of GoI-14, the Serpent's Hand.\n* The authorization of members of MTF Sigma-3 to aggressively seek out means of combating Nx-001.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN FILE◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"background: #fff url('https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Ai57/scp-logo-i57.png') center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= **COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:**\n||~ YEA  ||~ NAY  ||~ ABSTAIN ||\n|| O5-01 || O5-04  || O5-06 ||\n|| O5-02 ||   || O5-08||\n|| O5-03 ||   ||       ||\n|| O5-05 ||   ||          ||\n|| O5-07 ||   ||          ||\n|| O5-09 ||       ||          ||\n|| O5-10 ||       ||          ||\n|| O5-11 ||   ||       ||\n|| O5-12 ||   ||       ||\n|| O5-13 ||   ||       ||\n@@ @@\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| **##057800|APPROVED##** ||\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nShortly after this, SCP-6000-A awoke from its comatose state during preliminary examination by medical personnel at Facility-57.

Center of the universe.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Maybe it is. \n\n**MOOSE:** I wouldn't be surprised. Place is infinite.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** No. Not infinite. Merely impossibly large.\n\n**MOOSE:** What's the difference?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** It's eternally expanding as new stories are written and new knowledge is found. It expands and consumes dead stories, stories that have ended, into itself. To turn them into shelves for other stories so that something new might exist in their place.\n\n**MOOSE:** Huh.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** My story is about that, a bit. Once upon a time, there was a little girl who woke up and found she could spin fire. She lit toys, candles, papers on fire, until men with guns kicked down the door to her tenement and tried to take her away. That was when she learned she could also light people on fire, and found that it was much less fun. Then she ran and ran until she met people, street witches and miraclemakers, who were just like her. They opened a door to a world where she could be herself without fear of reprisal.\n\n**MOOSE:** The Library.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Yes. She walked among the shelves and saw the Docents and read every single story she wanted. But she came across a problem. Every story ended. Some were short, some were long, but they all came to an end sooner or later.\n\n**MOOSE:** How is that a problem?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** It wasn't, not really. But she couldn't stop thinking about the end of the stories and one question, always ringing out -- what happened after? Did the characters struggle against their end, or was it a calm affair?\n\n**MOOSE:** I can relate. But what does this have to do with us?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** I don't know. I'm still sorting through the stories - I simply pick that which seems relevant. But I'd look for the Serpent's Hand. They helped the girl. Maybe they can help you.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 6000.4\n+++ {{FUSILLADE RESPONSES}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nUpon SCP-6000-A's suggestion and in line with Project FUSILLADE, on December 27th, 2030, SCPOVERCOM approved Operation REDLOCK for MTFs worldwide to make simultaneous raids on the known headquarters of major Serpent's Hand cells.

Hell, we don't even know if there's a rhyme or reason to anything. \n\nMost Foundation personnel only know of the Library in the abstract, but I and a handful of others have actually stepped foot in the shelves. We can tell you that it is at once humanity's greatest boon and its greatest threat.

You're not Hand, you can't even remember the Library.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Oh, but I can. I can remember some things now. Not everything, but hopefully it will come.\n\n**MOOSE:** Really? What is it?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** I remember being a young woman in the Dinodon's Hand. Searching for the worship of knowledge in the Library and out.\n\n**MOOSE:** Worship? Awfully religious for the Hand, I'd damn well know. I ran with them for years.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Really? And now you're a Foundation director. What changed?\n\n**MOOSE:** I don't want to talk about it, but suffice to say that I realized maybe not all knowledge is meant to be shared. Anyway. You were saying?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Yes... the Hand started out as a cult, thousands of years ago. The Hand of the Serpent, a warrior cult dedicated to the worship of the Serpent that created the Library.\n\n**MOOSE:** The Serpent?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Knowledge incarnate. The spirit of learning. The Naga. Jormungandr. The Snake in the Tree. Every mythical snake iconography is said to stem from the primal Serpent. \n\n**MOOSE:** But no one knows if it's actually real. \n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Shh. Let me finish my story, Jailor. The Hand were powerful, long-lived monks, but eventually died out, leaving their teachings behind. Theses, passages, essays on why the spread of knowledge was the greatest honor possible and should be done at all possible cost. Many years later, people from this world discovered these writings and christened themselves the New Serpent's Hand, the one you and I know today. They shed the trappings of ritual, but the worship of knowledge as an ideal remains.\n\n**MOOSE:** Wow. I had no idea about the origins. They never told me.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Neither did I, when I joined. This is a new story, whispered to me by the Serpent in my dreams.\n\n**MOOSE:** Wait, what?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Draw the lines and connect the dots, Jailor. The Serpent is real, she is the spirit of the Library. And, in a ritual circle over an intersection of ley lines in the Amazon rainforest, I spoke to her.\n\n**MOOSE:** And you heard stories.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** And I heard stories. Of her singing the Library into reality at the beginning of creation, of her molding its halls and then retiring to slumber under its foundations in exhaustion. Of patrons wandering down and speaking to her, even now.\n\n**MOOSE:** Wow.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** And of stories utterly unrelated to her. \n\n**MOOSE:** Do any of these stories help me? Heroes of old figuring out to stop the Library when it goes insane and out of control, bent on destruction? The Library's not supposed to kill or invade, it's beyond all that. It's neutral to a fault. I just don't understand why this is happening.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** No. No stories like that, Jailor. I'm sorry, but that's not how this story ends.\n\n**MOOSE:** Endings are mutable.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:**  Oh, no. That's not true. Endings are set in stone. But endings don't matter anyway.\n\n**MOOSE:** How's that?\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** To any observer, your story ended when you betrayed the Library and came to the Foundation. But it didn't. You didn't stop existing. You just transitioned to a new narrative, one where you were the Director of Site-19.\n\n**MOOSE:** That's not a narrative, it's my goddamn life.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** I never finished my story, did I? The little girl read and read and read until one day she realized she had already solved her problem. Of course they all ended.... but she moved on to the next story. There were always //more stories.// No point in lamenting what was inevitable when she could move on.\n\n**MOOSE:** I only wish it ran like that in real life.\n\n**SCP-6000-A:** Yes. All the stories I see with the Foundation staring down the end of the world... they have the Bookburners by their side. I suppose there's something to say there.
