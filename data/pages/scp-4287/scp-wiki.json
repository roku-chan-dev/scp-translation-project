Each afternoon, SCP-4287 is to be provided with one ##a40|cosmopolitan##[[footnote]]##a40| All proper office workers in a high-end company firm should know their way around a proper mixed drink. You never know when an intern may become an agent who may need to make cocktails for their boss, date night guest, mother-in-law, girlfriend's sister, or undercover assassination target. Per my extensive research, the Cosmopolitan is a highly popular mixed drink... [full explanation in five pages of documentation available upon request.] ~ [[span class=\"pigeon\"]]P. Pigeon, Esq.[[/span]]##[[/footnote]] cocktail. \n\nDue to SCP-4287's limited voluntary mobility, it is permitted free access to any areas within Site-48, so long as it remains localized to one Foundation facility and wears a tracking device. Level-2 personnel are permitted and encouraged to pick up SCP-4287 and carry it around to assist it with desired location changes ##a40|for increased efficiency##[[footnote]]##a40| I assure you, it is the best and most logical solution given my stature and range of dexterity. ~ [[span class=\"pigeon\"]]P. Pigeon, Esq.[[/span]]##[[/footnote]].\n\nUntil SCP-4287 has provided a finalized plan for the placement of recycling bins within Site-48, it is to be allowed direct access to all recycling receptacles for proper fecal disposal. Instances of SCP-4287-1 are to be deposited in the same on-site recycling receptacles.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4287 is an adult male rock pigeon (//Columba livia//) of average size and weight with blue-gray feathers and black banding around its backside. It refuses to or is unable to take flight. SCP-4287 clearly displays signs of --sentience-- ##a40|sapience##[[footnote]]##a40| Sentience is not enough for my level of intelligence and communication. Does //nobody// know the difference between 'sentient' and 'sapient' anymore? ~ [[span class=\"pigeon\"]]P. Pigeon, Esq.[[/span]]##[[/footnote]] as it is able to communicate verbally with Foundation personnel in fluent English (albeit interspersed with typical non-anomalous pigeon behavior, including spontaneous defecation). It speaks in a Brooklyn accent unless it is being directly interviewed by Foundation personnel, at which time SCP-4287's accent will change to a vaguely British (Received Pronunciation) accent. \n\nSCP-4287 has also been observed \"editing\" paper documentation by pecking vigorously at the location of errors it has identified and wishes to comment on. Said commentary manifests at the end page of the corresponding content.\n\nBased on recorded interactions, SCP-4287 is highly skilled in industrial organization, office management, and clerical work consultation and will freely offer these services to Foundation personnel regardless of whether or not they request its services. It is also capable of spontaneously manifesting in any boardroom within Site-48 and frequently makes use of this ability to disrupt board meetings, insisting on acting as a moderator for the discussion, or identifying typos and grammatical errors on presentation materials. It is noted that SCP-4287 is not capable of teleporting out of the boardrooms, and must return to its previous location by walking or being carried. \n\nSCP-4287 is also able to anomalously consume large quantities of paper and cardstock material. Its waste, correspondingly, is composed of compressed, dry paper material in the shape of pellets (hereafter referred to as SCP-4287-1). Instances of SCP-4287-1 are propelled from SCP-4287's rear with sufficient force to cause immediate explosive decompression upon impact. \n\nSCP-4287 was purportedly first discovered in the Site-48 courtyard with a US postage stamp affixed to its head. The image on the stamp featured a minimalist design of a human hand performing an obscene gesture, with the caption text, \"To: You / From: You\". A small snake design is present on the raised third finger. \n\n**Addendum SCP-4287-1:** Interview excerpt following intake of SCP-4287.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#e5e5e5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**__Interviewer__:** Researcher C.
