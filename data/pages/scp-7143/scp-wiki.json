Cover story implicating local heroin trade as source of gunfire fed to police; no complications. Inspection of the team’s Kant counter indicates no hardware malfunction; subsequent sweep of the room indicates residual  traces of multiple Rosen-Fortune Bridges recently active in the room, though this is not sufficient to explain abnormal Hume readings. A7-1 placed on long-term medical leave. Whiteboard eraser demonstrates no further anomalous properties and is discarded.\n\n------------------------\n\n[[=]]\n++ **INCIDENT REPORT 7143-XKR**\n[[/=]]\n\n------------------------\n\nRecovered security footage confirms eyewitness reports placing SCP-7143 as participant in the attack on Area-08.
