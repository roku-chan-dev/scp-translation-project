Access to the room requires Level-2 or higher clearance. All staff members involved in the testing of SCP-3636 must be provided with an up-to-date song blacklist document. Under no circumstances are songs from the blacklist to be selected.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3636 is a 155cm by 85cm jukebox similar in design to a Wurlitzer 1015 with a decorative rainbow-colored light  across the top and a golden plate bearing the inscription, \"World's Greatest Jukebox\". The glass selection screen where one would typically find booklets detailing the songs available is instead replaced with a blue touchscreen displaying a search bar and the text, \"Search for song title, artist, or album\". SCP-3636 has no slot to insert coins and has no apparent power source. \n\nSelecting a song through the search function will cause a list to appear consisting of every version of the song known to exist, including unreleased early versions of the song as well as every live performance by the original artist. Analysis of live events after the Foundation's acquisition of SCP-3636 confirms that the live versions are accurate to the performance listed. SCP-3636 seems to have a wide temporal range, as original performances of operas that debuted in the Baroque period have been selected. \n\nWhen a song is selected, SCP-3636's screen changes to display a video with the text \"Live Music Video\" above it. The video is based on the lyrical content of the song, often directly depicting the events mentioned in the song. Other times the events seen in the video are the result of a play on words. The events in SCP-3636 actually occur at a real world location visible in SCP-3636's video. The phenomenon, referred to as SCP-3636-1, lasts for the length of the song. Effects of SCP-3636-1 may continue after the fact depending on the contents of the video. An instance of SCP-3636-1 is created regardless of whether the song selected has an official music video. All tests of instrumental songs so far have produced music videos without any perceived anomalous effects (e.g., \"YYZ\" by Rush shows live footage from Toronto Pearson International Airport).\n\nSCP-3636 was discovered by local firefighters during a fire at a bar in ████████, New York that killed 21 individuals. The jukebox was found undamaged with the screen showing a video of the fire from the bar's exterior while playing the song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" by Billy Joel. Class-B amnestics were administered to all survivors and first responders. \n \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test log\"  hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n> **Test 1**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Walk\" by Pantera\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Several people in a location confirmed to be Arlington, Texas are shown making signs for a protest. Most of the signs contain the word \"respect\". At the start of the first chorus, a group has gathered in the city's downtown and begins marching with these signs. They collectively chant along to the chorus of the song and local news stations are shown reporting on the impromptu \"Respect Walk\".\n> **Effects:** Participants in the protest expressed confusion over their involvement. Class-A amnestics administered to everyone affected. \n> **Notes:** Arlington, Texas is the city where Pantera was founded. SCP-3636 may be aware of this fact.\n\n> **Test 2**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Somebody's Watching Me\" by Rockwell\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A tall, elderly man with pale skin and gray hair is shown breaking into Site-17, searching for and eventually spying on Research Assistant ████ ███████, who selected the song. \n> **Effects:** Elderly man disappeared at the conclusion of song and was not found after a complete search of Site-17. Damage to the site was found at the location the break-in occurred in the video and was immediately repaired. ███████ immediately identified the man as an uncle who physically abused him as a child. ███████ experienced severe paranoia for a week and underwent psychological treatment.\n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist. All future tests must be carried out by D-class personnel under supervision of approved Foundation researchers.\n\n> **Test 3** \n> **Song Selected:** \"Jukebox Hero\" by Foreigner \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** SCP-3636 immediately disappeared from containment. \n> **Effects:** SCP-3636 found on top of an apartment building in New York City. Affixed to SCP-3636 was a cape with the words \"Jukebox Hero\" written on it. A severely malnourished man was found tied up with a rope on the same rooftop, with a written confession to several murders next to him. SCP-3636 was returned to Site-17 and the man was taken to local authorities.\n> **Notes:** Extreme deviation from the lyrical content of the song. Analysis of cape reveal no unusual properties. Further searches for \"Jukebox Hero\" displayed the song in a separate list called \"Favorites\".\n\n> **Test 4** \n> **Song Selected:** \"The Night Santa Went Crazy\" by Weird Al Yankovic\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A man with an appearance similar to modern depictions of Santa Claus carrying several weapons assaults a large building filled with humanoid beings that look similar to traditional depictions of \"Christmas elves\" After a large shootout and several explosions, the man executes five reindeer who display human-level intelligence. Several FBI agents later surround the man, arresting him. \n> **Effects:** Subject of video remains unidentified. The FBI's Unusual Incidents Unit sent Foundation contacts documents detailing the raid on the North Pole. Destroyed building consistent with the workshop depicted in the video is found 6 miles east of the magnetic north pole. \n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist.\n\n> **Test 5**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Straight Through the Heart\" by Dio\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A group of men similar in appearance to the band Dio appears next to SCP-3636, performing the song. A man who appears to be a young Ronnie James Dio is carrying several swords. Every time the title of the song is sung, Dio takes a sword and stabs D-75529 in the chest. D-75529 seems unharmed for the duration of the song.  \n> **Effects:** D-75529 died instantly from his wounds. Autopsy confirms that all nine swords went directly through the test subject's heart. \n> **Notes:** Test occurred after the death of Ronnie James Dio. When interviewed, none of the surviving members of Dio remember taking part in the events of the video. \n\n> **Test 6** \n> **Song Selected:** \"My Heart Will Go On\" by Celine Dion \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A large freight ship in the Atlantic ocean is seen hitting an iceberg. Two muscular Slavic men are seen trying to escape together, eventually they stop searching for a method of escape and stand embracing each other and kissing as the boat sinks.  \n> **Effects:** Boat found 7 miles south of Titanic wreckage. All 43 crew members were killed. Corpses of the two men depicted in the video are found still embracing. \n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist.  \n\n> **Test 7**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" by The Beatles\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-992103 is shown sleeping on a bench in a park located in Liverpool, England. D-992103's head has been replaced with a large jar of mustard. D-992103 is seen counting coins in a pile next to the bench. D-992103 eventually meets a woman with a name tag that says \"Pam\", and the two suddenly appear outside of Buckingham Palace. \n> **Effects:** D-992103 and the woman in the video are located near Buckingham Palace. The woman is identified as D-992103's actual sister. D-992103 seems to have suffered no ill effects and passed all vision, hearing, and cognition tests despite his head still appearing to be a jar of mustard. Researchers described D-992103 as \"irritable\". Class-B Amnestics administered to D-992103's sister. \n> **Notes:** D-992103 is currently being evaluated at a Foundation surgical center with updates pending. \n\n> **Test 8**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Screen remained blank for 5 seconds as a female voice said \"Sorry, I don't like that song.\" before returning to the search screen. \n> **Effects:** No anomalous effects observed. \n> **Notes:** First time SCP-3636 has refused to play a song. First instance of any direct communication with the user. \n\n> **Test 9**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Cult of Personality\" by Living Colour\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  Video depicts several world leaders dancing, playing air guitar, and lip-syncing the lyrics to the song while in the middle of their duties. The video ends with a montage of the same world leaders making a \"stage dive\" off of a nearby desk. \n> **Effects:** Embedded Foundation agents in several governments confirm the events depicted in the video actually occurred. Some world leaders suffered minor injuries from their attempted stage dive. \n> **Notes:** Researchers noted that the song could be selected again to create blackmail material to use against anti-Foundation politicians, with approval pending from the Ethics Committee. SCP-3636 added song to favorites. \n\n> **Test 10**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Blindfolds Aside\" by Protest the Hero \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Several executions of prisoners in different locations are depicted, with all participants wearing blindfolds. All events are interrupted by D-22091 wearing a cheap blonde wig, begging for mercy on the prisoner's behalf. All attempts fail and the prisoners are executed without complication.  \n> **Effects:** D-22091 returned to Site 17 at the end of the video. A blonde wig was discovered under his jumpsuit. All executions depicted in the video were confirmed to have taken place with no complications.\n> **Notes:** D-22091 was confirmed to be the only person depicted in the video with any memory of the event.  \n\n> **Test 11**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Danger! High Voltage\" by Electric Six\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** SCP-3636's containment room changes in appearance to recreate the room depicted in the original music video of the song. Two people who appear to be Electric Six singer Dick Valentine and actress Tina Kanarek in their original costumes follow the exact choreography of the video. D-91244 is shown standing in the background, holding a sign stating \"Why change what is already perfect?\".\n> **Effects:** No anomalous effects observed.\n> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites. \n\n> **Test 12** \n> **Song Selected:** \"Buddy Holly\" by Weezer\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  Several Foundation members stationed at Site-17 are shown changing into clothing popular in the 1950s, then attending what a banner proclaims is a \"Buddy Holly/Mary Tyler Moore Lookalike Contest\" held at the Site-17 dining hall. Several Foundation researchers participate in the contest. The O5 Council are shown sitting at a judges table. Dr. █████ and Research Assistant ████████ are selected as the winners.\n> **Effects:** Events in video occurred as depicted, including transportation of entire O5 Council to Site-17. \n> **Notes:** Video contained many in-jokes commonly shared by Site-17 personnel. SCP-3636 may have time-manipulating effects as the entire contest was held during the song's 2 minute and 40 second duration. --Further testing halted by order of Site Director.-- Testing reinstated, see Addendum.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Song blacklist\"  hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\nCover versions of any songs listed below are also blacklisted.\n\n> * \"We Didn't Start the Fire\" by Billy Joel\n> * \"World Wide Suicide\" by Pearl Jam\n> * \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" by R.E.M.\n> * \"I Don't Want to Set the World On Fire\" by The Ink Spots\n> * \"Nuclear War (On The Dance Floor)\" by Electric Six\n> * \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" by Pink Floyd\n> * \"Distant Early Warning\" by Rush\n> * \"Chemical Bomb\" by The Aquabats\n> * \"Call of Ktulu\" by Metallica\n> * \"Countdown to Extinction\" by Megadeth\n> * \"Zombie Jamboree\" by Rockapella\n> * \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes\n> * \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" by Tears for Fears\n> * \"Chocolate Rain\" by Tay Zonday\n> * \"It's Raining Men\" by The Weather Girls\n> * \"Somebody's Watching Me\" by Rockwell\n> * \"The Night Santa Went Crazy\" by Weird Al Yankovic \n> * \"My Heart Will Go On\" By Celine Dion\n> * \"Werewolves of London\" by Warren Zevon\n> * \"Godzilla\" by Blue Oyster Cult\n> * \"Black Hole Sun\" by Soundgarden\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum:** On ██/██/17, SCP-3636 began playing \"Why Can't We Be Friends\" by War without any input. No staff were on hand to observe the video event corresponding to the song. Security forces entered the room after noticing the song and discovered former Foundation employee ████ ███████ handcuffed inside the containment room. ███████ was wanted by the Foundation for the theft of six anomalous items. The stolen items were later found to have been returned to their proper locations. A note was found in ███████'s pocket. The note read \"Please keep the music playing, I'd rather be friends than enemies. - WGJB\" Testing resumed by order of O5. Further test results are to be documented in [[[experiment-log-3636|Experiment Log 3636]]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3635]]] | SCP-3636 | [[[SCP-3637]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
