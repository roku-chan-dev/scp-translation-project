Shortly after containment began, the Foundation determined that SCP-2791's system was unsustainable and attempted to de-escalate the number and scope of its component contracts. On 02/13/2022, shortly after SCP-2791 reached its 500 million oath milestone, it was determined that neutralization through de-escalation was not possible.\n\nProjections indicated that SCP-2791 would become uncontainable within 3 months, at which point it would rapidly destabilize and enter an Oath Cascade Event. Its component contracts would all simultaneously resolve, leading to the immediate seizure of 89% of all living souls on Earth, 24% of Earth's land mass, and three undetermined planets from our solar system.\n\nMembers of the Legal Department and Tactical Theology Department were mobilized to find an alternative method of containment or neutralization.

We have plenty of experience in nullifying anomalous contracts-- but voiding even one oath would disrupt the delicate balance of 2791's system.

I suggest we use it to divert the prices invoked by SCP-2791 to an alternate Earth.\n\n**Katz:** Not possible. It would be a direct violation the [[[scp-5618 | Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981]]].

I suggest we complete our preparations first-- lawyers may work quickly, but Marion works faster.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Site-666.png\n| caption=Site-666\n| width=100%\n| align=center]]\n\n**Addendum 6607-4: 2022 SCP-IRS Accords**\n\nA meeting with GoI-066's representative was hosted in [[[scp-4661 | Site-666]]], due to its superior anti-demon equipment and the fact that Las Vegas is considered neutral territory by demonic entities.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"OPEN LOG 6607-4\" hide=\"CLOSE LOG 6607-4\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 02/21/2022\n\n**Location:** Site-666\n\n**Personnel Present:** Sheldon Katz, Esq. //(Legal Department)//, Primrose Fatish Von Trevil, Esq. //(Independent Contractor)//, Adrian //(Familiar/Paralegal/Emotional Support Animal)//\n\n-----\n\n//[Katz and Fatish Von Trevil sit at one end of Conference Room B's table. Adrian floats near Fatish Von Trevil's head.]//\n\n**Katz:** When did you say she was coming again?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** 3:46 PM.\n\n**Katz:** That's oddly specific.\n\n**Adrian:** It's a demon thing.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** She should be arriving in five... four... three... two...\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Now.\n\n//[A Tartarean-class demonic entity manifests on the opposite side of the room, already sitting at the table. It is a feminine humanoid that resembles an extinct species of vampire bat (desmodus draculae) and wears a red suit.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Marion.\n\n//[Entity-6607 nods.]//\n\n**Entity-6607:** //Love//ly to see you again, Rosebud. You too, Adrian dear--\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Enough pleasantries. We have work to do.\n\n//[Entity-6607 flicks one of its ears in apparent irritation.]//\n\n**Entity-6607:** //[Sighing.]// If you insist. My name is Marion, I'm a representative of the Infernal Revenue Service, here to speak on behalf of all those contracted to ITCD Bank's Extraglobal Operations division. Which is to say, I speak for the Gehennan Parliament, the Garden of Unearthly Delights, Mammon Industries™, and a wide assortment of independent demons, devils, fiends, imps, succubi, incubi, profane spirits, walking blasphemies, and possessed dolls.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Now... what do you have in mind for us today, Rosebud? What do have to give us that's more valuable than all of Neptune?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** We possess no such thing.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Go on.\n\n**Katz:** We're not here for a trade of assets. We're here to provide you a business offer.\n\n//[Fatish Von Trevil hands a stack of documents describing each SCP-6607 instance (with the exception of SCP-6607-1) in detail to Adrian, who brings it to Entity-6607. Entity-6607 begins reading it.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** In exchange for the nullification of all of ITCD Bank's current contracts, we shall set these rituals into motion.\n\n//[Entity-6607 does not respond for 3.5 minutes as it continues to read at a rapid pace. Afterwards, it tosses the stack of documents onto the table.]//\n\n**Entity-6607:** You're //lo//sing your touch, Rosebud. These profits aren't bad, but they're peanuts in comparison to what is already owed.\n\n**Katz:** Try to keep in mind the length of Foundation's reach-- our influence exceeds nearly all other earthly authorities. We'll be able to push each ritual's influence to a global scale.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Look again to page 213. It has detailed estimations of how much energy each ritual can produce under such conditions. Within a single century, we will have generated an equivalent amount of power for your clients. \n\n**Adrian:** With 30% interest!\n\n**Entity-6607:** I sup//pose// that's not entirely terrible-- but I want an upfront payment in addition to what you're offering. Something significant. My people will need proof that you're serious about this.\n\n**Adrian:** You want even more?!\n\n**Entity-6607:** And I won't even consider accepting this agreement until I get it, dearest.\n\n**Katz:** You're bluffing. ITCD's contracts might be a large profit for Hell, but we both know you need us humans alive, long-term. Destroy the world and you'll have nothing left to feed upon. No acquisition is worth that much.\n\n//[Fatish Von Trevil places a hand on Katz's shoulder.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Mr. Katz--\n\n**Entity-6607:** Do you //rea//lly think that humans are our only clientele? That we would limit our efforts to your little ball of water and gas?\n\n**Entity-6607:** There are planets where the edicts of devils stand above all others. There are great starfaring ships that skip from galaxy to galaxy through blood and profane science. There are Dyson spheres of stygian iron that encircle hellfire stars.\n\n**Entity-6607:** The universe is wide and strange, little lawyer, and you cannot begin to comprehend Hell's place in it.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Is Earth valuable to us? Of course! But it's hardly //in//valuable.\n\n//[Katz glances at Fatish Von Trevil to confirm the veracity of Entity-6607's statement. Fatish Von Trevil nods.]//\n\n**Katz:** I'll need a moment to confer with my superiors.\n\n**Entity-6607:** //Cer//tainly-- we have all the time in the world, after all.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nKatz shortly gained signed permission for the surrender of several high-value demonic objects and entities to GoI-066's custody upon the signing of the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords. Negotiation of the Accords' exact terms began shortly afterward. As negotiations carried on for nearly 19 hours, the majority of proceedings has been redacted for the sake of brevity.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Katz:** The amendment you added to paragraph 3 of subsection 7A is unacceptable.\n\n**Entity-6607:** What//ever// do you mean? All that does is lower the owed quantity of \"FSE\" by a rather significant amount. I was doing Rosebud a favor, for old times' sake. That's all.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** A //favor//? You would lower our FSE debt in exchange for every soul in Florida.\n\n**Entity-6607:** It'd be doing the world a favor, if you ask me.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** I did not ask. Remove it.\n\n**Entity-6607:** As you say, darling.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Entity-6607:** I have some more revisions for you to look over.\n\n**Katz:** //[Pause.]// Do any of these revisions consign people to hell?\n\n**Entity-6607:** Define \"people.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Katz:** //[Examining revision 84-A of the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords.]// Look at this, Trevil. This isn't legal, right?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Pause.]// I am surprised, Marion. I never thought you would partake in such a glaring error.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Are you sure about that?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** I am certain. You know well that I have memorized all laws and regulations regarding infernal contracts. I have read them countless times.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Read them again.\n\n//[Entity-6607 snaps its fingers. A long parchment scroll materializes in its other hand in a burst of fire. It hands the scroll to Fatish Von Trevil, who reads its contents.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** An amendment was made.... less than a day ago? And it has already come into effect? Was this your doing?\n\n**Entity-6607:** //[Examining its nails.]// I might have called in a few favors.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** This amendment is small, but its consequences spread far-- we have many revisions to make, Mr. Katz.\n\n**Adrian:** I'll get more coffee.\n\n**Katz:** Please do.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** //[Whispering.]// Do you understand my trepidation regarding Marion, now?\n\n**Katz:** //[Whispering.]// Yes... To think I'd miss 738. God.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Did you two say something?\n\n**Katz:** No.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Of course not.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Agent Kirchner enters Conference Room B. She appears to be slightly out of breath.]//\n\n**Kirchner:** Site-666 is under attack-- we're seeing sudden bursts in demonic activity all over Undervegas. I'm here to bring both of you to the nearest safe room.\n\n**Katz:** I'll be staying here, Agent.\n\n**Kirchner:** I don't think you understand--\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Marion.\n\n**Entity-6607:** Yes, Rosebud?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Stop. This. Now.\n\n//[A distant explosion is audible and the room slightly shakes.]//\n\n**Entity-6607:** I don't //poss//ibly know what you mean! I have nothing to do with any of this. Not in any way that would be admissible as evidence.\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** //Marion.//\n\n**Entity-6607:** I'd be happy to lend my assistance, of course. Help you smooth this all over. Though, I won't be able to do a //thing// until we get these Accords signed...\n\n//[Fatish Von Trevil stands up abruptly, knocking over her chair. An ornate trident materializes in her hands.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Continue working, Mr. Katz. I will resolve the situation.\n\n**Katz:** Shouldn't we leave that to the soldiers?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** Have you read my file? I have experience as both a mercenary and diplomatic liaison.\n\n**Katz:** Do you intend to make peace with our attackers or...?\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** I suppose that is up to them, is it not?\n\n//[Fatish Von Trevil walks past Kirchner and exits the room. 25 seconds later, distant  inhuman screams become audible.]//\n\n**Katz:** So, I have some concerns about subsection 21A.\n\n//[Conference Room B shakes more forcefully.]//\n\n**Katz:** Let's talk about that.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Conference Room B's lights are dimmed, due to Site-666 having switched to auxiliary power. Significant structural damage is visible. Fatish Von Trevil is covered in blood, none of it her own. Katz's left eye is twitching uncontrollably.]//\n\n**Fatish Von Trevil:** We are done, yes?\n\n**Entity-6607:** It seems you haven't lost your touch after all, Rosebud.\n\n//[Entity-6607 signs the 2022 SCP-IRS Accords.]//\n\n**Entity-6607:** Let's do this again sometime. Ciao!\n\n//[Entity-6607 dematerializes in a burst of fire and smoke. The smoke floats towards the ceiling and activates the room's sprinklers. Fatish Von Trevil, Katz, and Adrian do not attempt to leave.]//\n\n**Katz:** I... //fucking// hate the IRS.\n\n**Adrian:** We all do, buddy. We all do.\n\n//[The ceiling collapses.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background-image: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/whore-of-blood-hub/Black_Paper.jpg\"); background-size: cover; background-color: black; color: white; border: 6px solid #820e06; border-style: ridge; width: 300px; margin:auto;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/whore-of-blood-hub/button.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whore-of-blood-hub\" width=\"100%\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6606]]] | SCP-6607 | [[[SCP-6608]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Name:** Department of Tactical Theology logo\n> **Author:** [[*user Aethris]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[aethris-art | Aethris' Artworks]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Godel.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user MontagueETC]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> ----\n> **Filename:** godel-icon-2.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[SCP-5616]]]\n> **Derivative of:**\n> ----\n> **Filename:** godel-icon.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user ItsDenali]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[itsdenalis-personnel-file | ItsDenali's Bison Box]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** IRS_Red.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Fantem]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** Primrose-Sigil-Circle-Red.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Fantem]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** SIGIL-AG02.png\n> **Author:** [[*user MontagueETC]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:** The seal of the demon Ageres, see List of demons in the Ars Goetia\n> **Author:** Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ageres.jpg | Wikipedia]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Agares.png\n> **Name:** Une illustration pour l’article Aguarès dans le Dictionnaire infernal par Collin de Plancy.\n> **Author:** Louis Le Breton\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Aguar%C3%A8s.png | Wikipedia]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Site-666.png\n> **Name:** LUXOR - LAS VEGAS\n> **Author:** Jared eberhardt\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/7842697@N03/5070651958 | Flickr]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
