Those outside the SCP-7538 management team may also participate with permission from the Research Head.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7538 designates a group of sentient stuffed selachians colloquially referred to as 'Blåhaj', manufactured by the Swedish company IKEA.\n\nSpecimens of SCP-7538 are capable of levitation, travelling through the air in a matter comparable to swimming in the ocean. Despite bearing a resemblance to typical blue sharks, SCP-7538's behavior are similar to that of domesticated canines, being fairly docile and able to understand simple instructions.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum:** Recording Log\n\nOn the 9^^th^^ of November, 2021, an unauthorized package was delivered to Site-757 before being taken in by Dr. Mako and brought to SCP-7538's  cell. Due to this, Senior Researcher Anthony Clips was sent in to investigate the matter.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//Clips enters the containment chamber while fixated on a clipboard he has in hand.//\n\n**Clips:** Good afternoon, Ms. Mako. Director Numen had sent me here to inspect a certain matter involving a recent package that arrived on-site. Apparently, I was told you would know about it so —\n\n//He looks up and sees Mako, who is staring back at him while taping a boxing glove to the tip of an SCP-7538 instance's nose with duct tape. Her mouth is agape and her eyes are widened as Clips accidentally drops his clipboard. There is a brief moment of silence.//\n\n//A number of other specimens are also equipped with boxing gloves. He kneels down and picks up his clipboard.//\n\n**Clips:** What are you doing?\n\n//Mako glances away from Clips before looking back.//\n\n**Mako:** What does it look like I'm doing?\n\n**Clips:** It looks like you're attaching boxing gloves to your pet sharks.\n\n**Mako:** Well, you'd be right, my good man. Thanks for the observation!\n\n//Clips clicks his pen repeatedly and sighs.//\n\n**Clips:** I'm reporting you to the higher ups.\n\n**Mako:** Wait, wait, wait —\n\n//Mako scrambles to Clips, almost tripping while doing so.//\n\n**Mako:** I can assure you that I have a very reasonable explanation behind… //(gestures)// all this. It makes a lot of sense once you hear me out.\n\n**Clips:** I'm sorry but I doubt there's anything reasonable about //that.//\n\n//Clips points to two SCP-7538 instances bumping into each other using the boxing gloves. She turns to them and lets out a chuckle.//\n\n**Mako:** It's cute, isn't it?\n\n**Clips:** That's… besides the point.\n\n**Mako:** Eh, you were considering it for a moment.\n\n**Clips:** No, I wasn't.\n\n**Mako:** Are you //shore?// Laying playful punches on your new fishy friends. You'd be down for that, right?\n\n**Clips:** No, I wouldn't. That's ridiculous.\n\n//Mako turns back.//\n\n**Mako:** Look, Clippy —\n\n**Clips:** Don't call me \"Clippy\".\n\n**Mako:** — //Clips,// right. This is all just a misunderstanding. I mean, I’m only trying to expand on our recreational activities. Creating more games we can play together, you know?\n\n**Clips:** And you jumped to… //boxing gloves?//\n\n**Mako:** This is just an experiment!\n\n**Clips:** This is a glorified show-and-tell at an elementary school.\n\n**Mako:** Good g//reef//, Clips. You're hurting the poor souls. Look at them.\n\n//Two SCP-7538 instances are chasing one another. Clips raises his eyebrow.//\n\n**Clips:** You're hurting the site's budget.\n\n**Mako:** No, I'm not. This is from my own paycheck, honest.\n\n**Clips:** Then you're hurting your own budget. I'm leaving.\n\n//Mako rushes to the entrance, blocking him.//\n\n**Mako:** I'm afraid I can't let you go, Clips.\n\n**Clips:** Step away, Ms. Mako. You're being highly unprofessional.\n\n**Mako:** No. I'm sorry, but you leave me no choice. //(Raises her voice)// Finions!\n\n//All SCP-7538 specimens faces Mako and Clips.//\n\n**Clips:** What the f —\n\n**Mako:** //ATTACK!//\n\n//Mako shoves Clips to the ground as the SCP-7538 instances approach him, proceeding to surround and punch him all over his body again and again.//\n\n**Mako:** That's right. Come on, boys. Punch him in the gut!\n\n**Clips:** Hey, stop! Get off of me!\n\n**Mako:** What's wrong, Clips? Don't you //sea// how much fun they're having?\n\n**Clips:** Mako, for the love of — //ow!//\n\n//Clips shields himself from the specimens with his clipboard.//\n\n**Mako:** I'm sure it can also improve staff morale. Very entertaining, very fun. It's a jawsome idea, don't you agree?\n\n**Clips:** //Ow!// — As if.\n\n**Mako:** Aw, you're such a gilljoy.\n\n**Clips:** Mako, can you please stop this whole fiasc — //ow!// — STOP THAT!\n\n//The SCP-7538 instances stop and hesitate for a moment before continuing.//\n\n**Mako:** No, I still need more data. Just keep 'em occupied for a little longer, okay?\n\n**Clips:** Ugh…\n\n//The next few minutes consist of Clips being constantly hit by the SCP-7538 instances, occasionally but unsuccessfully attempting to wave them off with his arm. Mako then calls them off, causing the specimens to fly elsewhere and interact with each other again.//\n\n//Clips remains in a fetal position as Mako kneels down, staring at his face. He ignores her and turns to the ground.//\n\n**Mako:** So, //water// your thoughts? What'd you think?\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**Clips:** …I think I hate you.\n\n//Another pause. Mako grins.//\n\n**Mako:** //(Inhales)// Worth it.\n\n**[FIN. LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\nDr. Mako was later reprimanded for this behavior.
