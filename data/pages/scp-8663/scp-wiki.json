She'd have the whole day tomorrow for herself and her daughter, time enough to make good on many promises long delayed. For now, though, all she wanted was peace, and the luxury of releasing her burdens. She set most of them down at the vestibule, turned the light on, and took her shoes off.  Her daughter was probably asleep by--\n\n\"Mom?! Is that you?!\"\n\nA voice called out to her, shrill with terror. Lucille's weariness was forgotten as panic and uncertainty took over.\n\n\"Amanda?!  Where are you?\"\n\n\"In the kitchen! Hurry!\"\n\nLucille nearly slipped as she raced through the living room; the house was in severe disarray, as if it had been broken into. A shelf had been knocked over, scattering its contents (including slivers of glass Lucille heedlessly darted over), pictures had been dislodged from the wall, a lamp laid sideways, and a mass of flowers and broken ceramic greeted her as she scurried down a hallway and around a corner, bursting into her kitchen. She called for her daughter again, flicking the lights on.\n\n\"Mom,\" she heard Amanda wail, hyperventilating frantically, \"help me!\" \n\nLucille feared the worst and looked around, seeing nothing.\n\n\"Where are you?!\" she cried. She looked left, right, in all the dark crannies... It took a moment before she found her answer.\n\nShe looked up.\n\nShe gasped.\n\nThere was her daughter, huddled helplessly in the corner, crying and shivering.\n\nStuck tight on the kitchen ceiling.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item Number:** SCP-8663\n\n**Containment Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment and care of SCP-8663-A is completely under the purview of Site-203 therapist Dr. Lucille Riverson. SCP-8663-A resides in Containment Chamber 411, and is to be given basic amenities and various minor privileges. Handrails are positioned along the ceiling, walls, and floor of the living quarters, bathroom, and bedroom. SCP-8663-A must be escorted by Dr. Riverson whenever she leaves her room. A disused hangar adjacent to Site-203 has been designated for SCP-8663-A's testing, exercise, and recreation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8663 is a phenomenon affecting a human adolescent female named Amanda Riverson (SCP-8663-A). The anomaly renders 8663-A in a perpetual levitated state, to the point of 8663-A being completely incapable of positioning her feet upon any upright surface. SCP-8663-A's mobility is otherwise unimpeded by gravitational force, enabling her to transition between points via flotation. SCP-8663-A cannot alter her position at will, nor is she capable of accelerating or decelerating at will; outside interference may alter or halt SCP-8663-A's trajectory.\n\n**Discovery:** The anomaly was first discovered two days prior to SCP-8663-A's arrival at Site-203. Dr. Riverson had returned home after work to find the subject on the ceiling, calling for help. After various unsuccessful attempts to bring the subject to the surface, Dr. Riverson contacted the Foundation, and had her transferred to Site-203, where she could monitor the subject more closely.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8663/girl-standing-upside-down-from-the-roof.jpg\n|caption=SCP-8663-A in her kitchen.

Together they watched as the girl floated back and forth on the ceiling of the Containment Chamber.\n\n\"Did I, though,\" Lucille muttered, hugging herself as she shuddered. Her daughter's placid fluidity was a deceptive veneer. If Amanda had been outdoors when it had happened, had started floating up and up with nothing to stop her... \"I hesitated,\" Lucille added. \"I waited so long. I tried to...talk myself out of it so many times. It was personal, though: you understand.\"\n\nTalbot nodded. \"It couldn't have been easy.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" she scoffed. \"Do you think I expected to see this when I came home? Do you think I approached it rationally and...clinically?\" She regurgitated the last word, nearly feeling the bile rise as she watched her daughter floating around, trying to make sense of her position. She halted as she came to a wall, grasping the handrail that had been installed two hours ago. She looked up, pulling on it slightly, ascending until her fingers touched the ceiling. The girl carefully laid her body against it, folded her hands, and stared in contemplative silence at the floor below her.\n\n\"I didn't even sleep,\" Lucille continued, her voice as weightless as the girl in the chamber. \"I couldn't. I spent most of my time trying to be the adult -- the mother -- in the situation. Rational, calm, decisive. Trying to figure out what happened, how I could help. Going through all sorts of stupid homebrew experiments, anything to get her down again. Trying not to lose my mind.\"\n\n\"I couldn't possibly imagine what you had went through,\" Talbot admitted. Lucille just nodded.\n\n\"I may have had a nervous breakdown or two. Not...in front of Amanda; I had to be tough for her, show her that I had everything under control. But that didn't last long. Eventually it all came crashing down on me and...well, you know the rest.\"\n\nTalbot nodded. The phone call. The unmarked van. Bialowieski and Shulen in the front seats, professional and courteous. Trying to put Amanda's mind at ease, tell her they could help, while Lucille held tight to her daughter's hand. How she had to duck inside the van. How she was unable to sit down, so she curled up on the top, her arm dangling down as her mother grasped it. The ride over, where Lucille tried to explain what she did for a living.\n\nWhy she had been absent for so many of her daughter's most important moments.\n\nWhy she could never make promises, because she didn't know if she'd be able to keep them.\n\nAlice entering Wonderland as the gate for Site-203 opened. The long walk down cold hallways, Lucille leading her daughter like a balloon. Talbot reaching up to shake her hand. Discussions. Conferences. Lucille refusing to leave her daughter's side.\n\nStudies. Experiments. A Containment Chamber. You did the right thing.\n\nLucille sighed. \"What happens now?\"\n\n\"More research.\" Talbot met her bleary gaze, shrugging helplessly. \"The way I see it, your daughter has two futures in store for her: either this anomaly is understood to the point where we can treat, remove, or neutralize it, or she learns to live with it.\"\n\n\"And the Foundation doesn't usually neutralize anomalies,\" Lucille recited emptily. Talbot took a deep breath.\n\n\"I'll make sure you're the head researcher on the matter,\" he said. \"You'll get to select your own team, make your own schedule, fine-tune your own reports... I know it isn't much, but it's the best I can offer.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that,\" she murmured. She put her hand against the bulletproof glass, staring intently at the ceiling, her daughter still in a meditative state of upside-down relaxation. Talbot silently dismissed himself, touching Lucille's shoulder in a temporary gesture of encouragement. She remained at the window until her daughter fell asleep.\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Addendum:** Tests have concluded that SCP-8663-A's hair, bodily fluids, and skin cells are unaffected by the anomaly.

Still no answer.\n\n\"If you have something on your mind, Amanda, just say it.\"\n\nAnother frustrating pause. Finally, Amanda muttered, \"So now you have time for me? Now that I'm a freak?\"\n\n\"All right, so you're angry at me,\" Lucille noted, crossing her arms. \"That's something, at least. Who's calling you a freak, Amanda? I didn't. Director Talbot certainly didn't. Did one of the researchers--\"\n\n\"But isn't that what I am now?\"  Amanda looked down as she sat cross-legged on the ceiling. She ran a hand through her hair, taking out a loose strand, which she let fall.\n\n\"No, Amanda,\" her mother insisted calmly. \"You're simply the focal point of an anomalous phenomenon.\"\n\n\"Try saying that five times fast,\" the girl grumbled. Her mother frowned.\n\n\"And we don't know anything about it, aside from what it does and who it's focused on. That's why we're having you take all these tests.\"\n\n\"So I'm a lab rat.\"\n\n\"No, you--\"\n\n\"Or I'm a case. A study. Part of your job. That's the only reason you're paying attention to me.\"\n\n\"That's not //true//. It--\"\n\n\"Am I wrong?!\" Amanda roared, glaring at her mother from her perch. Lucille stared hotly, trembling from frustration and helplessness and...\n\nAnd guilt.\n\n\"My work is important, sweetheart,\" she said solemnly. \"Just as important to me as you are. I'm trying to balance my time between the two, but...you're right, I'm not very good at it. But I want to be better, and...convenient or not, this is the best way to go about doing it. So I'm here, now, for you, exclusively.\"\n\nLucille waited for her daughter to say something. Or maybe Amanda just wanted to be silent. That was fine, too. She wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\"Do you think you can fix me?\" she eventually murmured.\n\n\"We have to understand this anomaly first, sweetheart,\" Lucille answered.\n\n\"How long does that take?\"\n\n\"I have no idea,\" her mother sighed. \"It could be in the next hour, or it could be never.\" She swallowed and quickly added, \"I know that sounds awful, but...you want me to be transparent with you, right? Tell you the truth, respect your time and intelligence.\"\n\nA moment, hanging in time, right there on the ceiling.\n\n\"Have you ever fixed any anomaly before?\"\n\n\"The Foundation has explained a few, yes. Some anomalies even neutralize on their own--like a peculiarity that comes and goes.\"\n\n\"Have //you//?\" she emphasized. Lucille shook her head.\n\n\"That's normally not my job. I council the staff at 203, try and help them through their issues. Sometimes I talk to people like you. I help out with personal problems, keep people from self-destruction. Or self-depreciation.\" Amanda slowly stood, righted herself, and drifted away from the ceiling, down to face her mother. Her feet hovered a few centimeters off the ground.\n\n\"What other people have you helped? I mean like me.\"\n\nLucille smirked. \"Well, I helped [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7632|a witch, for one]]].\"\n\nAmanda chuckled, the first time she had smiled since this debacle began. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes. We worked out some of her problems and now she's better-adjusted.\"\n\n\"But still...a witch.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Sometimes my patients have to learn to live with what they have.\"\n\nAmanda looked down, where her feet floated stubbornly in mid-air. \"Like me?\"\n\n\"Each case is different. I can't tell you what's going to happen: I can only //help// you, as best as I can. The Director and the other researchers are going to help you as well.\"\n\nThere was a long silence as Amanda contemplated this. She reached her hands out; as her mother reached for her, she pushed her fingers against the older woman's palms, floating backwards slowly.\n\n\"What happens if you can get rid of it?\"\n\n\"Lots of red tape to go through,\" Lucille sighed, already fearing the mountain of paperwork she'd have to shovel through in this potential best-case scenario. \"But eventually you'd go back home and... Well, I mean, we'd probably just blot out everything that hap--\"\n\n\"I mean with us. With //this//.\" Amanda's eyes glimmered with intent, her voice heavy and grim. Lucille felt herself sinking. If she no longer had to treat her daughter as an anomaly, then...\n\nThey'd go back to the way things were.\n\nDistant. Absent. Trains in the night.\n\n\"Let's focus on one thing at a time first,\" Lucille answered, noncommittal and toothless. \"I'd like to run a little experiment tomorrow. How would you like to go for a swim?\"\n\nHer daughter gave her a confused look. \"Like in a pool?\"\n\n\"Yes, a pool. We have one next to our arboretum.\"\n\nHer daughter still appeared bewildered. \"So you just want me to swim? I kind of do that already, only in the air.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see what happens when we put you in water.

Daring someone who was barely a teenager to presume anything.\n\n\"I won't float away,\" Amanda grumbled, as she did just that. \"I told you, I still follow all of Newton's laws. An object in motion and...so forth and so on.\"\n\n\"And what if an outside force causes you to float upwards without anything to stop you? Amanda...\"  Lucille tried calming down.

To put it plainly, I'm a people-person.\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** Oh. Is that why you're talking to me?\n\n**Bialowieski:** No, it's because I drew the short straw. //(silence. Bialowieski laughs.)// I'm kidding. Your mother asked me to. She's run into a few things--\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** She doesn't want to be around me.\n\n**Bialowieski:** Oh?

She was never there for me. //(silence)// She missed out on my birthday at least three times.\n\n**Bialowieski:** But she's been by your side ever since you were brought in. You've run tests together, you've eaten together; she's even put a sleeping bag in here so she can sleep in the same room as you. Even our most devoted staff members don't usually go to those lengths.\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** That's only because I'm part of her work now.\n\n**Bialowieski:** Well, yes, that is an inarguable side-effect. But your mother doesn't normally deal with anomalies. In fact, if you weren't her daughter, you'd probably have to deal with me instead, or maybe one of the other researchers.

I was excited at first -- I mean, who wouldn't be -- but then I realized I couldn't control my powers, so I just ended up bumping around a lot, like astronauts in space. I, uh...broke a lot of things. Eventually I wedged myself into the ceiling and waited for her to show up. I waited a long time. //(silence)// It's a miracle she showed up at all.\n\n**Bialowieski:** //(sighs)// Perhaps. She was busier than usual that day, if I recall.

My feet went from the floor to the air, just like that.\n\n**Bialowieski:** I see.

I've been reading a lot of physics books, too.\n\n**Bialowieski:** Was that a subject you had any interest in before?\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** No, I didn't really have a subject that I liked. Reading, maybe.\n\n**Bialowieski:** Well, we could probably help you along with your education if you want.\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** So you have schools and classrooms for people like me?\n\n**Bialowieski:** Not exactly.

If you get lonely, I could probably arrange for a few junior researchers to--\n\n**SCP-8663-A:** No. I don't want them to do any more tests on me.\n\n**Bialowieski:** I was just going to suggest that maybe they can keep you company if you like.

I don't encourage them to talk, just listen. Hear what the world has to say. Silence allows us to be at our most reflective, when there's nothing to distract us. I then tell them to dwell on the situations or issues or feelings that are giving them the most trouble, to really conceptualize what's pressing upon them the most. Bring it out to the forefront. When they've got a good grasp of it, I tell my patients to look around them, to see how the world is shaped and ordered. How are our surroundings relevant to their circumstance?\"\n\nShe smiled thinly and sat down. Amanda grabbed hold of one of the wooden poles holding up the roof.\n\n\"Right now, I'm feeling frustrated,\" her mother stated. \"I feel powerless, helpless, frightened. I feel...like I want to do right by you, but things aren't going the way I need them to. I feel like you want to help me, but something's holding you back, and I'm losing my patience with that. I feel immense love. I feel like if we could just get past one little obstacle, then everything will work out and we can move on. But I'm lost, Amanda, lost and exhausted trying to find my way back. And I'd wish you'd help me. I feel like you're acting out of spite, and...maybe I deserve that, but I'm trying to do better, really. It's like...I'm trying to save you from drowning, but you're still angry about the way I steered the boat. Bad analogy, but that's how I feel.\"\n\nShe took a meditative breath.\n\n\"Then, I tell my patients to write a haiku about their feelings, and how that relates to what they see and hear around them. It's remarkably effective therapy, strange as it may sound. They don't have to share the haiku with me, I just want them to express themselves through it. Like this.\"\n\nLucille closed her eyes, sat perfectly still for a moment, took a deep breath, and opened her eyes again. Then she began to write:\n\n//A dreary, grey sky.//\n//My sunshine, drifting away.//\n//I reach out to grasp.//\n\n\"Now you try.\" She held out a paper, a pen, a flat surface to write on. Amanda took them mutely and grumbled.\n\n\"Right now?\"\n\n\"When you're ready,\" her mother assured her. In the meantime, she opened her thermos and poured a cup. When she emptied it, her daughter began:\n\n//I wished you were here.//\n//But what do I wish for now?//\n//I'm as lost as you.//\n\n\"Do you want it?\" Amanda said, offering. Her mother poured another cup.\n\n\"Trade you. It's tea.\"\n\nThey drank, and read. The rain came back gently. Lucille smiled.\n\n\"Director Talbot made that tea. I hope it's not too bitter.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Amanda replied meekly. \"I kind of like it.\"\n\nThey drank another cup together in silence. Amanda sighed.\n\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"(In any case, I think you should have a heart-to-heart with your mother.)\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\"Can I share something with you in confidence?\"\n\nBialowieski smiled at the level of trust Amanda was placing in him -- or perhaps she felt she could only open herself up to a stranger, someone who didn't know her very well. Someone who would judge her impartially.\n\n\"Of course. This conversation's being recorded, but I can arrange so that parts are redacted. The perks of being a senior member of staff here.\"\n\nAmanda took a moment to gather her thoughts. \"Okay. The truth is...I don't know if I want to go back to being normal.\"\n\nSilence hung with her. Bialowieski waited patiently for her to continue.\n\n\"Like...my mother's been paying a lot more attention to me now. She's //there// for me, like you said. It may just be a part of her job, but...it makes me feel important to her.\"  Amanda squirmed, fidgeting, expressing volumes in her stilted discomfort. Bialowieski simply nodded.\n\n\"And I kind of don't want this to go away. I mean, I //do//, but at the same time, I don't. Because then she'll...\"\n\nAmanda frowned. Sighed. Looked away.\n\n\"She won't have to be there for me. I mean...she won't //have// to,\" she emphasized with great acuity. \"And if she doesn't have to, I...don't want things to go back to the way they were. Like does that even make sense? I want to be normal again but I don't want to, because...\"\n\nBialowieski nodded. \"I think I understand. A part of you wants to remain in this state, since Lucy's giving you the time and attention she once deprived you of, and yet you're deprived of the freedoms granted to people your age, and you want that back -- but if that happens, you're afraid she'll leave you alone again. Did I summarize it correctly?\"\n\nShe nodded. He sighed deeply. He, having never been particularly good with younger people, felt unqualified to dole out advice -- and anything he did share would likely sound contrived, pretentious, or useless. This was, unfortunately, something the Riverson ladies would have to figure out on their own.\n\n\"A very ambivalent state of affairs. In any case, I think you should have a heart-to-heart with your mother.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n\n\"Hey, mom? Remember when I asked you what would happen if this anomalous thing went away?\"  She then recalled the paper and wrote something new on it:  **ANSWER ME**.  Lucille sighed.\n\n\"Like I said, lots of red tape. You've seen the movie //Men in Black//, yes? Remember those devices they used to erase people's memory? We'd do something like that with you. Make you forget that you floated. Then you'd go back to your normal life, but you'd be monitored. By me,\" she assured her.\n\n\"So you'd be around more often to keep an eye on me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Is that what you want?\"\n\nThe rain pittered, silvery harps drumming rhythmically.\n\n\"What about your job?\"\n\n\"My work is certainly important to me,\" Lucille admitted. \"But at least now you know why.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Amanda grumbled. \"I understand.  But you'd still be...doing it, right?\"\n\n\"Ideally, yes.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't...be gone all the time, either?\"\n\n\"No, honey, I'd have to--\"  She caught herself. Looked up at her daughter's face. Reached out. Grabbed her sunshine.\n\n\"I'd have to have words with Talbot. I'd insist that it would be in his best interest for me to take better care of you, just in case. Or even if there was no 'just in case'. I'd really put my foot down. And if he didn't agree?\"\n\nLucille beamed with triumphant love.\n\n\"Then I'd give him a piece of my mind.\" They shared a laugh; Amanda let go of the post and hovered freely. \"But I doubt I'd need to do anything so dramatic. Talbot's a good man; he'll understand. He wouldn't dare lose his best-and-only therapist due to a...misunderstanding.\" Her eyes glinted, and Amanda grinned.\n\n\"But what if I'm stuck like this for the rest of my life?\" she said, her face going dim. Her mother shrugged wistfully.\n\n\"Then we'll just have to make the best of it.  I know it's tough, but...\"\n\n\"It's fine, mom,\" she assured her, hovering closer. \"I...I guess I'll get used to it.\"  She hesitated, looked down, then faced her mother, smiling shyly.  \"If I have to.\"  \n\nThey decided to call it a day before the rain got too heavy. Lucille hesitated slightly as she stood up.\n\n\"Amanda, I'd like to try one more thing. Humor me for a bit.\"\n\n\"Sure, what is it?\"  Lucille held her palms out flat and joined her hands together, making a platform. She nodded to her daughter, who -- still tethered -- floated upward until her feet were level with her mother's hands. Then, she gave her tether a slight tug, propelling herself forward. Amanda pressed the soles of her shoes to her mother's open palms and stationed herself.\n\nShe held still, gasping. Laughing. Crying.\n\n\"Oh my god, I'm standing!\"\n\n\"Yep!\" Lucille cried. \"A real handstand!\"\n\n\"Oh my god, mom!!\"  They laughed until they cried, mother shakily holding her daughter. Amanda bounded away gently and attempted to land on solid ground. Her shoes were stubbornly repulsed.\n\n\"Aww,\" she groaned, though her face was still lit beatifically in triumph. She let out a sigh. \"Oh, well. That's good enough for now.\"\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nOf course, the floor had to be mopped when they came back inside: one set of footprints, and a trail of droplets alongside it.\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Addendum:** Director Talbot has granted SCP-8663-A permission to assist Dr. Riverson with minor tasks.
