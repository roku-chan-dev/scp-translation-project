style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nSite-322.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001, as of documentation, is uncontainable. Containment efforts are focused on research and prevention over direct containment of the anomaly. Site-322's Director Paul Lague is currently heading this investigation.\n\nFoundation personnel are encouraged to participate in contributing to the SCP-001 research project. Director Lague is promoting the divulgence of anecdotes regarding containment failures to be sent to him via SCiPnet. Once enough data is collected, containment efforts will begin.\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 denotes a pervasive anomalous phenomenon affecting the entirety of the SCP Foundation, manifesting as the failure to contain and/or maintain the containment of anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.\n\nSCP-001 is most commonly observed during the investigatory period of anomalies. A plurality of Foundation investigations conclude with the anomaly in some form of containment. SCP-001 causes the leap from the researching/testing phase of an investigation to the containment phase to be entirely infeasible. This is typically caused by the manifestation of isolated, irregular, and seemingly aimless events that appear to exist solely to prevent the Foundation from achieving containment.\n\nThe existence of SCP-001 is based on the logic that the Foundation has access to theoretically infinite manpower, expertise in all subjects anomalous and mundane, powerful reality-warping capabilities, the ability to translocate through the space-time continuum, and access to all anomalous and mundane resources. Despite these fundamental elements of the Foundation’s operations, containment failures still occur at a notably high rate.\n\nWhile SCP-001 is a theoretical phenomenon, the Foundation experiences a containment failure rate of approximately 5.2%, frequently due to circumstances outside of the Foundation's control. When that collection of incidents is eliminated, containment failures occur at a rate of 4.3%, leaving only SCP-001 as the appropriate explanation for the discrepancy.\n\n**Addendum 001.1:** SCP-001 Affected Anomalies\n\nBased on Director Lague's research, he has found five incidents for which, based on the circumstances of the containment failures, he hypothesizes SCP-001 to be at fault.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"ooga\"]]\n[[span class=\"lexendtitle\"]]SCP-001-1[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"lexendsub\"]]Previous Designation: SCP-5770[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:30%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/plague-s-proposal/piazza.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThe Palazzo Vecchio, the centerpiece of the piazza.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Truncated Description:** SCP-5770 is an annual 10-day festival held in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, Italy. SCP-5770 contains a mind-altering phenomenon causing all persons within a 10-kilometer range to attend the event, despite the lack of advertisement for it.\n\nDuring SCP-5770, two anomalous entities, SCP-5770-1 and SCP-5770-2, host a stage show in which subjects they deem \"sinners\" are subject to makeshift punishments akin to what is depicted in Dante Alighieri's //Inferno//. Both entities resemble animated statues in the style of the Renaissance artist Michelangelo. At SCP-5770's conclusion, evidence of the festival vanishes and attendees lose all knowledge of its events, with the only lasting effect being a notable rise in the attendees' general piousness.\n\nDespite the original SCP-5770 investigation having taken place in 1985, successful containment is yet to be established and, as such, SCP-5770 has been archived and is awaiting official designation.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n= [[size 110%]]__**SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures**__[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.1-01__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** The head researcher on SCP-5770, Joseph Pasqua, the former Site-322 Director, deserted from the Foundation due to manipulation by SCP-5770-1.

It resembled an animated mascot costume of a dove. The entity was approximately 2 meters in height and its form was hollow.\n\nResponding agents of Mobile Task Force ζ-66 (\"Guardian Angels\") were the first Foundation personnel to interact with the entity.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n-----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n**SCP-5770-3:** TWEEDLEY-DEE TWEEDLEY-DA.

Upon the culmination of SCP-5594, baseline reality would be permanently altered based on the winning snail.\n\nBefore each SCP-5594 event took place, a random male of the Earth's population would be designated as the race's observer and forced to Egypt by a manipulative, incorporeal force.

When the phone number is contacted, the caller will be greeted by a robotic female voice, which will request payment for an unspecified item. After payment details are given, the phone call will immediately conclude and an anomalous item will instantaneously appear in the vicinity of the caller.\n\nThese items, designated SCP-5479-B, have a variety of violent effects on the user, commonly turning the user into a disproportionate human-ape amalgam before killing them.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n= [[size 110%]]__**SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures**__[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.3-01__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** Upon publishing the SCP-5479 file for peer review, researching doctors Randall House and Paul Lague were met with an extreme, emotional backlash from the entirety of those who read the file. This began a sweep of anomalously influenced mass hysteria across the ranks of the Foundation, leading to House and Lague going into hiding for a period of time. The mob lasted for three days, and caused 3.2 million dollars in damages. Below is a truncated list of incidents caused by SCP-5479's publishing:\n* House and Lague's offices were raided, the mob later flooding and then burning the spaces;\n* Parts of Site-666 and Site-322 were razed by various mobs;\n* One unknown person managed to find the hiding locations of Lague and House. They proceeded to stand outside of the room, monotonously repeating the phrase \"humans are apes\" before collapsing from exhaustion and being removed;\n* The mob managed to tame a troop of chimpanzees, which was used to damage more property;\n* The Overseer Council ordered House and Lague's death by drawing and quartering;\n* Two factions formed among the mob, one that wanted to use the chimps to \"sniff out the bastards\" and the other half who believed it was aligning with the enemy. This led to a minor civil war among their ranks with over 1,300 dead or wounded.\n\nO5-1, the only member of the Overseer Council not to have been affected by the hysteria, ordered the file to be deleted. This event occurred prior to any containment efforts on the anomaly, as the peer review process would have been used to judge the best method of containment.\n\nUpon deletion, all persons returned to a normal state. Amnestic stores were dispersed to all affected personnel save for Lague, House, and O5-1 in order to ensure the file would never be published again.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe file was placed on a quarantined server that only Lague, House, and O5-1 had access to.

You know, they may have some questions for someone who, I don't know, gets mind-tricked by a bundle of tentacles.\n\n//The crowd begins talking amongst themselves.//\n\n**Coix:** Hey, hey, hey, hold on.\n\n**Lague:** No! You hold on! I've been good to you. I've been good to all of you! This is how I get paid back? With nonstop fuckery with every other anomaly we get here! It's bad. This is bad. Help me out!\n\n**Coix:** You think I — we did this deliberately?\n\n**Lague:** No! But let's take a look at the last three years. The snails? House and I had to hide in a pocket dimension for a week over some bullshit monkey ad! That assfucking that was the crabs and the lobsters? Don't even get me started on the festival we've made no progress on in fifty years! And now... this! //This!?// The simplest thing and we lose it!\n\n **Coix:** There's no explanation here that can blame people. There's something we're missing.\n\n**Lague:** I know! I'm still getting the brunt of it all from everyone. I just got this job, man! I like it, and now this bullshit keeps popping up. It's like the universe has something against me. I'm a scientist, I should be able to fix this!\n\n**[[[SCP-5595]]]:** //(From the crowd.)// {{SO DO IT.}}\n\n**Lague:** What?\n\n**SCP-5595:** {{SOLVE IT. THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE. GO THROUGH ALL THE ANOMALIES YOU'VE HAD AN ISSUE WITH AND FIND SOMETHING CONNECTING THEM. HUMANS APPARENTLY EVOLVED A PATTERN-SEEKING BRAIN, AND I KNOW YOU BARELY USE YOURS. MIGHT AS WELL TRY NOW. GET SOME CLOSURE, YA DIG.}}\n\n **Coix:** That's not a half-bad idea.\n\n**Lague:** You know what? What else do I have to lose? You're right. Might as well give it the ol' college try. Someone get Site-7 on the line.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"evalooga\"]]\n[[span class=\"lexendtitle\"]]OVERSEER EVALUATION[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"lexendsub\"]]SCP-001-5[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n[[div class=\"o5view\"]]\n= **MEETING OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL**\n\n----\n\n**O5-2:** I'll be honest. You've officially lost me.\n\n**Lague:** How so?\n\n**O5-2:** Look, I already said it and so did a few of my fellow council members, but I'll reiterate. I don't think this is about containment failure. This is a pattern of //personal// failure due to something totally mundane: underestimation. You were new. It's a hard job, I know, and look at you now. A director, one of the top people in the Foundation hierarchy, and yet, you're writing about your mistakes.\n\n**Lague:** That's--\n\n**O5-2:** Have you ever heard the term \"growing pains?\"\n\n**Lague:** Yes, ma'am.\n\n**O5-2:** While I do think this is a well-formatted and researched file, I don't think this anomaly exists.\n\n**O5-1:** That doesn't ma-- Nevermind, sorry.\n\n**Lague:** What?\n\n**O5-2** A majority of these occurred in late 2015 into early 2016, just as you became director, right?\n\n**Lague:** Of the examples I've given, yes.\n\n**O5-2:** I could genuinely explain almost all of these as accidental negligence from a series of anomalies we didn't fully understand. Let's take the snails. You admitted they're intelligent but they're clearly even more intelligent than you or anyone had assumed, and they're definitely using their abilities to make sure they stay undiscovered and undocumented for as long as they can. I'm not seeing an anomaly, I'm seeing growing pains.\n\n**Lague:** Well—\n\n**O5-2:** Or the ape phone number — whatever it was called. Something //else// is seriously going on with these anomalies that you and whoever was researching with you didn’t expect, and you sadly had to pay the consequences for it. But, didn’t you learn something from every one of these?\n\n**Lague:** Maybe not consciously but, yes, I did.\n\n**O5-2:** Have you had an incident similar to the five you've presented since 2016?\n\n**Lague:** Not to my knowledge, no.\n\n**O5-2:** Couldn't this all be explained by you getting into a role you felt ill-equipped for and making a few mistakes? What was it? Three years from joining 322 to being a director. I’m pretty sure that’s a record. It's been six years and you've had nothing of the sort since. Growing pains.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"ooga\"]]\n[[span class=\"lexendtitle\"]]JUDGMENT OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL [[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"paper3\"]]\n[[div class=\"o5view\"]]\n= **MEETING OF THE OVERSEER COUNCIL**\n-----\n**Lague:** I failed, right?\n\n**O5-2:** Well--\n\n**Lague:** Look, everyone I talked to said this was more of a ritual than anything. I was told that you guys make this seem like a very critical, difficult process but it's only for show.\n\n**O5-13:** {{NAMES. ADDRESSES. I'LL HANDLE THE LOUD MOUTHS.}}\n\n**O5-2:** Technically, yes. It's difficult to fail these.\n\n**Lague:** Has that ever happened?\n\n**O5-2:** That's not information you're allowed to know.\n\n**Lague:** Alright. Remember how I said the details of my lateness — which I apologize for a million times over — were not pertinent?\n\n**O5-2:** Yes.\n\n**Lague:** Just, uh, take a look.\n\n//(Lague pulls out thirteen pieces of paper and distributes them to the Council.)//\n\n[[div class=\"paper2\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"ooga\"]]\n[[span class=\"lexendtitle\"]]SCP-001-6[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"lexendsub\"]]Designation: SCP-001-LAGUE[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n= [[size 110%]]__**SCP-001 Influenced Containment Failures**__[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-01__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** During preliminary research into SCP-001-LAGUE, Director Paul Lague became extremely ill. Medical examinations found that Lague had a number of parasites in his system including Hookworm, Tapeworm, Roundworm-induced toxocariasis, and Whipworm.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-02__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** The server hosting the draft SCP-001-LAGUE proposal was located in Site-7's pocket dimension. Despite being an exceptionally outage-proof server farm, the upload of SCP-001-LAGUE seemingly caused the first and only large-scale blackout in Site-7's history, culminating in the deletion of a single document: Lague's draft.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-03__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** Following the creation of a later draft, [[[SCP-7525-EX]]] manifested at Site-322. This was the anomaly's first appearance since 2020 and it immediately went dormant once again following the incident. Instead of following its normal pattern of corrupting unused SCP file slots, SCP-7525-EX solely targeted the research material of SCP-001-LAGUE.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-04__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** Lague pivoted to using physical drafting over digital due to the above issues. During the second drafting stage, [[[SCP-423]]] inserted itself into the documentation and refused to exit, stating that \"[it] really likes this one.\" SCP-423 is contained at Site-19 and has not been transferred to another Site since its initial containment.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-05__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** During draft attempt five, Lague hosted all documentation and research material in a hermetically sealed containment chamber. The entrance hall leading into this room contained an airborne antimeme preventing those that attempted to enter to forget the room existed, save for Lague.\n\nDuring a Chaos Insurgency raid of Site-322, this room was the sole target of a bombing, and all research materials were lost. No other structural damage was sustained.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-06__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** Lague lost the ability to speak or write in any language for one week.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-07__**\n\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** The draft was finally completed after Lague was given asylum in The Wanderer's Library. After alerting the Overseer Council to the file's completion, Lague was given transport to Site-01 to the presentation the next day, where the following occurred:\n* The jet transporting Lague was struck by lightning eight times and had to make an emergency landing after both engines exploded due to apparent mechanical issues unrelated to the lightning;\n* This landing was near Site-43, where Lague was given refuge until the Site's Acroamatic Abatement system, three containment halls, and a cafeteria collapsed after Lague's entrance to each Section;\n* Lague opted to drive himself to Site-01 in a disguised Foundation van so as to not put others in danger. A humanoid entity, who Lague claimed was SCP-5770-3, appeared in the middle of a long stretch of road. Attempting to swerve out of the way, Lague crashed into a boulder and totaled the vehicle. The humanoid was not found;\n* At this point it was 2:00 AM. Lague attempted to radio for support via the van's communication system. Upon pushing the call button, the system ejected what appeared to be a mix of blood, seawater, and fryer grease;\n* The van's autonomous driving system went online without Lague triggering it. The van backed away from the boulder, accelerated, then made a beeline for a larger, much sharper boulder, crashing and subsequently exploding;\n* Lague made the rest of the journey on foot, arriving ten minutes late to his SCP-001 proposal presentation at Site-01.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**O5-1:** Okay, Paul, why the hell wasn't this the first thing we saw?\n\n**Lague:** Dramatic flair. I wanted to prove it without a doubt.\n\n//(O5-9 gestures angrily. O5-7 types on their keyboard.)//\n\n**O5-7:** what a bastard.\n\n**O5-2:** It's certainly... something.\n\n**O5-5:** Mr. Lague-- Paul. Can I call you Paul? Okay, Mr. Lague. Even if this has been my first proposal presentation it's definitely my favorite!\n\n**O5-13:** {{I PRAY TO GOD HE STRIKES YOU WHERE YOU SIT.}}\n\n**O5-4:** It's hard to argue all of this. I actually heard about the jet's engines, but not the lightning. And 43? Why weren't we told about this?\n\n**O5-1:** Something's always happening at that clown show.\n\n**O5-4:** And the car?\n\n**Lague:** It's been six hours since that happened. My cell service wouldn't work during the trip. When I got here I tried to send an email but my inbox filled with spam overnight and I didn't have enough storage to send anything. That's probably another one. Call it seven point five.\n\n**O5-1:** Can you give us your explanation of what happened here?\n\n**Lague:** The 001 itself didn't want to be filed and potentially contained. It seems to be a self-preservation tactic at this point. If I can ask again, have you //ever// denied an 001 proposal after giving someone the opportunity to research and present one?\n\n**O5-6:** I don't need to read your mind to see that you already know the answer.\n\n**Lague:** Flip the papers over, please.\n\n[[div class=\"paper2\"]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n[[div class=\"testfile\"]]\n= **__INCIDENT ID: 001.6-08__**\n[[div class=\"testvideo\"]]\n**SCP-001 Effect:** In a historic decision, the Overseer Council votes to deny filing an SCP-001 proposal.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/plague-s-proposal/offset/2 The Overseer Council has approved this proposal.
