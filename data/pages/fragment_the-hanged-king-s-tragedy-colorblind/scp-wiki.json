The plot typically revolves around a king that has been hanged for some reason.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Consistently, the play prominently features references to the[[/span]] {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]ostensibly[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]fictitious city-state Alagadda. What's frustratingly inconsistent is whether the play manifests any anomalous properties, and whether or not these properties are a direct result of the Alagadda references.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]And should there be anomalous effect/Performances are fated to be wrecked.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Yeah, sure, what Caroline said. Performances of the text come with anomalous manifestations, sudden homi- and suicidal fits, and we can't figure out what the hell causes it.[[/span]] //The notable anomaly is the appearance of an anomalous humanoid creature, usually taking the role as the Ambassador to Alagadda, even if the character is only mentioned or doesn't exist within the text of the play.// {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]my research indicates the ambassador may indeed work for an entity bearing some resemblance to the hanged king archetype. unclear exactly who/what this person is or what goals they may have.[[/span]]}}\n\n++ Prerequisites\n//The development of the English language, the development of theater, and Italian city states rising to power seem to be a commonality among all timelines.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]And the rise of monarchies! And royals! <3 Though I doubt this hanged king is as cute as[[/span]] //For the love of god please limit this discussion to relevant commentary on the play.//\n\n++ Utility\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]A kickass production for the winter theatre season![[/span]] {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]is she fucking serious.[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]If Alagadda we could somehow find/We might expand the reaches of our mind.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Hey Caroline, do you ever write lyrics? I feel like we could write an awesome song if you wanted to collab! :D[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Fucking hell, can we put an edit lock on Lisa's account?[[/span]] //Unfortunately, no. Her additions to the discussion could be valuable.

I believe that's why Caroline requested this catalogue.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]The king and henchman pose potential threat/So we'll need all the intel we can get.[[/span]]\n-----\n[[size 85%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]How is this done?[[/span]] //Tell her what you told me.//  [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]Explain the plot, then the anomaly,/and should you feel there's more that you can say/include it and we'll all learn more this way.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Seriously, your rhymes are genius. Hmu after this, we need to write a song! >:D[[/span]][[/size]]\n++ Instance: Timeline E-473:\n//Jacobean era, early 1600s. The plot concerns the royal family of Trinculo, a fictitious Italian city state, specifically the death of the former king Sforza, who was hanged from a tree post-mortem. Said to have been the main influence of Shakespeare's tragedy \"King Giovanni,\" a work not present in most timelines. Anomalous effect is present in the original, but not the Shakespeare derivative.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Any hypotheses why?[[/span]] //A few. Shakespeare's work replaces all fictitious place names with real historical locations, and some of the plot points are slightly changed. Ironically, \"King Giovanni\" has a much bleaker ending than \"The Hanged King's Tragedy,\" as nearly all major characters die. Shakespeare's plagiarism kept the work in obscurity, and it's mostly a curiosity piece for scholars, not something that typically gets performed. Last performance estimated to be over 200 years ago.//\n\n++ Instance: Timeline W-116:\n//Georgian era, late 1680s. Plot is roughly the same as previous instance, with minor changes, such as the ways characters are said to die and having a much more ambiguous ending than most other versions.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Non-anomalous. The EBC made a modern miniseries adaptation starring Tom Holland! <3[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]You can't be serious.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Really! He was so hot as Antonio c;[[/span]] //Relevant additions, Lisa.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]OK, OK, I get it! The original story is something of a cult classic, or whatever the literature version of that is. People know it, but like they don't know they know it. Like, people will talk about how somebody's \"gone to Alaggada\" to refer to them seemingly disappearing, but they don't know what Alagadda is.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Any clues as to why there's no anomalous features?[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]I dunno, maybe it's the popularity? There is a rather small group of, like, Alagadda Truthers or whatever who think they're like Illuminati or some shit like that, but like nobody really believes that XD[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]Though part of some bizarre conspiracy/There seems to be a grain of truth to me.[[/span]]\n\n++ Instance: Timeline Y-2079\n{{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]recent work. posted 2016 to the website archive of our own. story is set in 2010s britain about a young king who has just recently taken the throne and the struggles he faces. the play deals with themes of the role of monarchies in the 21st century the concept of morality in an unethical society and worsening mental health. the play ends with the king hanging himself with a noose made of white silk and leaving behind instructions for abolishing the monarchy.[[/span]]}} //How do I not have this variation in my library?// {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]because thats the most important thing to focus on. whether its in your library. i can send you the pdf later.[[/span]]}} //I would very much appreciate that.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Me too! That sounds really interesting :o[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]But what of Alagadda does he say?[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Yeah could we maybe stay on track today?[[/span]] {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]the text makes frequent use of the phrase \"transcend to alagadda\" and variations thereof. according to the author it was a reference to a story his mother used to tell him as a child.[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]That's the real important thing about this one, we know the author. We have confirmation the author is not a reality bender or in any way anomalous, aside from his mother's knowledge of Alagadda.[[/span]] //Anomalous properties?// {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]present. only one performance ever ran.[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]Luckily at a small theater. 14 noted casualties. The Foundation contained it pretty quickly.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Maybe they could release the play with the Alagadda references removed? It sounds like a pretty topical play.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]You're welcome to try convincing the Foundation why that wouldn't be a massive containment breach.[[/span]]\n\n++ Instance: Timeline C-431:\n//1972. Postmodern play about a man who proclaims himself king of all the lands but realizes there's nothing to claim because the author couldn't think of anything. Play ends with the author hanging the king to feel he has some control over the narrative.// {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]how meta.[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]In this one, Alagadda seems to be a stand in for the audience beyond the fourth wall, with the unseen author acting as the ambassador. A non anomalous filmed version that gained a cult following led to difficulty in containment.[[/span]] //It's non anomalous in this timeline?// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]It's very anomalous in this timeline. It's a goddamn miracle the film version went off without a hitch.[[/span]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]Unfortunately for the world at large/It seems that the hanged king is still in charge.[[/span]]\n\n++ Instance: Timeline M-759:\n//Circa 1895. Plot centers on a former slave's experience in America's gilded age. The story makes note of the man's heritage, including the stories from his father that they're descended from an unspecified African monarch.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]I'm already not liking the sound of this :c[[/span]] //It ends with the main character getting lynched. It was meant to be a powerful statement on the prevalent racism in post-civil war America. Now it just feels in bad taste.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'IM Fell DW Pica SC' ;\"]]Though \"tragedy\" is accurate to take/This version just feels more like a mistake.[[/span]] //Faded into obscurity after several failed silent film adaptations.// {{[[span style=\"color:#f4f4f4; background-color: black\"]]i presume the failures were anomaly based.[[/span]]}} [[span style=\"font-family: 'Kanit' ;\"]]I guess? The financial failures were compounded by the anomalous failures, and the morons kept trying to revive the project.[[/span]]\n\n++ Instance: Timeline A-710:\n//Caroline era. Believed to have been written by Kit Marlowe. Plot is consistent with earlier instances about the Trinculo royal family.// [[span style=\"font-family: 'Crafty Girls' ;\"]]Ok, why are you the one who's starting off all these entries?
