In 1924, he was selected by the Soviet government to join the fledgling Committee For The Investigation of Anomalous Phenomenon as Assistant Custodian. Over the course of the next decade, he rose to the rank of Chief Director for Central Asian and Custodial Affairs. In 1934, Dr. Kamelov was recruited to the Foundation by Agent ██████.\n\nDue to the cumulative effects of over ██ years of constant chain smoking, Dr. Kamelov's office is to be considered a Class Two chemohazard.\n\n**Note:** Due to Dr. Kamelov's ongoing obsession with Lysenkoism and refusal to accept modern genetic theory, all reports with relevant information regarding genetics and/or evolution are to be edited by Junior Researcher Gaffney. Under no circumstances is Dr. Kamelov to be made aware of this arrangement.\n\n__SCP Reports Complied__\n* [[[SCP-1316]]]\n* [[[SCP-1474]]]\n* [[[SCP-1605]]]\n* [[[SCP-1832]]]\n* [[[SCP-2009]]]\n* [[[SCP-2214]]]\n* [[[SCP-2387]]]\n* [[[SCP-2443]]]\n* [[[SCP-3967]]]\n* [[[SCP-4083]]]\n* [[[SCP-4146]]]\n* [[[SCP-4884]]]\n* [[[SCP-6037]]]\n* [[[SCP-8302]]]\n\n\n__Additional Documentation__\n* [[[Notes Towards A Manifesto]]]\n* [[[Broadcast]]]\n* [[[Dragon's Teeth]]]\n* [[[Father Iron]]]\n* [[[There Was One There Was Not One]]] (Part of the //Only Game In Town// canon)\n* [[[The End]]] (Part of the //Only Game In Town// canon)\n* [[[Now This]]] (Part of the //Competitive Eschatology// canon)\n* [[[What Did I Come Down Here For?]]]\n* [[[A Kind Of Christmas]]]\n* [[[Going Out Of Book]]]\n* [[[A Burial In The Woods]]]\n* [[[Smothering Dreams]]]\n* [[[nope-not-typing-all-that| Site 11, Conference Room K, 8:58 AM, July 12, 1982]]]\n* [[[Cleon]]] (Part of the //Coldest War// canon)\n* [[[17 Luxemburg Prospekt]]]\n* [[[The King In Chains]]] (Part of the //Only Game In Town// canon)\n* [http://www.scpwiki.com/on-the-origins On The Origins of Pre-Modern Fleshspeaking Rituals] (Part of the //Only Game In Town// canon) (co-authored with [[*user Riemann]])\n* [[[Barker]]]\n* [[[The Games We Play]]]\n* **The Cathedral of Air**\n * [[[Keep Circulating The Tapes]]]\n * [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/because-you-re-on-television-dummy/comments/show Because You're On Television, Dummy]\n * [[[TV Brings Me Closer To The World]]]\n\n__Passive-Aggressive Notes Sent__\n* [[[SCP-885-J]]]\n[http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/gaffsey-scp Found in Dr. Kamelov's waste bin]",
