Each exterior surface of the structure's lower level is to be reinforced to restrict the spread of SCP-6855.\n\nThe soil around the structure is to be continually observed for any breaches of SCP-6855 into the local groundwater supply. If any breaches are detected, then the containment perimeter is to be expanded to incorporate the affected area.\n\nAll SCP-6855-A instances are to be sequestered to the Eastern Hardware Storage Facility using standard physical barriers.\n\n----\n\n++++ Description\n\nSCP-6855 refers to a body of fluid in the lower level of the Eastern Hardware Storage Facility in Detroit, MI. The pool is 10 cm deep on average and occupies the entirety of the floor. The fluid that comprises SCP-6855 has a dark red appearance and acts similarly to a non-anomalous fluid in nearly all aspects.\n\nThe pool's sole anomalous property is that it is capable of generating humanoid entities which are made of the same fluid as SCP-6855. These entities are referred to as SCP-6855-A and emerge at random intervals from SCP-6855. These entities possess little strength and have not demonstrated any hostile behavior. Each of these entities will attempt to leave the confines of the warehouse. They are restricted in that they are only able to maintain their form for 10-15 minutes on average before collapsing into a pool of fluid.\n\nOne SCP-6855-A has been able to exit the warehouse which was reported to local law enforcement. This was then brought to the attention of the Foundation and all of those who were aware of this incident received amnestic therapy.\n\nBased on analysis of SCP-6855-A remains, the fluid no longer has any anomalous or hazardous properties nor is it capable of generating any further instances of SCP-6855-A.\n\nEvidence suggests that this anomaly was generated following the rupture of 12 large cylinders in the structure's lower level. These cylinders appear to have contained the fluid that comprises SCP-6855, however it is not currently known as to how the fluid obtained its anomalous properties. These cylinders are notably newer than other equipment in the facility, which was condemned in 1978.\n\nFurther investigation into SCP-6855's origins is underway.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email\" hide=\"Account Accessed\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** catherine.taylor@scp.site93.org\n**From:** jacob.lester@scp.site93.org\n**Subject:** Preliminary SCP-6855 Report\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello Director Taylor,\n\nAttached are my preliminary findings, raw data analysis, and containment recommendations for SCP-6855.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding my findings or my report, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Jacob Lester\nSite-93 | Junior Research Staff\n[[<]]\n> Attachment: [[span style=\"color:red\"]]SCP-6855 Report_Lester.pdf[[/span]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:**  jacob.lester@scp.site93.org\n**From:** catherine.taylor@scp.site93.org\n**Subject:** Re: Preliminary SCP-6855 Report\n[[/div]]\n------\nDr. Lester,\n\nBased on the information presented, I agree with your findings and recommendations.\n\nI expect that you will also provide a video record of the anomaly and the full lifespan of an SCP-6855-A instance.\n\nGiven that you're no longer in your probationary period under Dr. Benton, I expect that your finalized submission will be up to her -- and my -- standards. \n\nThank you,\n\nCatherine Taylor\nSite-93 | Site Director\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** catherine.taylor@scp.site93.org\n**From:** jacob.lester@scp.site93.org\n**Subject:** Re: Re: Preliminary SCP-6855 Report\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello Director Taylor,\n\nI will ensure that my final submission will be in-line with the standards that you have set for the research staff under your supervision.\n\nAs for the video record, I am arranging for my video files to auto-transmit to the Site-93 servers.

Thirteen barrels are stored on shelves against the far wall. Four empty barrels are positioned in the middle of the room.]}}//\n\n**Madame**: Let's see now.\n\nYou'll be the first. Come here.\n\n//{{[One of the group members approaches the entity. The entity removes the person's clothing. It then grabs the person's shoulders and bites into their throat.

Now, let's gather your... siblings.\n\n//{{[The entity proceeds to remove the clothing from the rest of the members of the group and bites into their throats.
