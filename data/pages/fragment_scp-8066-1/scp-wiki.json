To prevent further psychological decline, it may only interact with Level 5/8066 personnel and is to be given access to entertainment media. Barring a recently-developed antipathy for the horror genre, SCP-2006 has not expressed any particular media preferences.\n\n**Description (ARCHIVED):** SCP-2006 is an anomalous spherical entity with the capability to alter its body's shape, size, and composition with no known limits. Its stated goal is to evoke fear and dread in as many humans as possible, though its conception of fear has been heavily influenced by classic horror and science fiction films, significantly limiting the scope of its desires. Maintaining this conception has been deemed crucial for its continued containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2006 is a humanoid entity with the appearance of a human woman in her mid-to-late 30s. Following Incident 8066.2, it does not appear to possess any anomalous attributes.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n\n++* INCIDENT 8066.2\n\n----\n\nOn September 3rd, 2024 at 2:01 AM, several discrete instances of anomalous phenomena simultaneously took place across [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-118 | Site-118]]]. Of such phenomena, the following occurred within SCP-2006's containment cell:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic curved\"]]\n\n**Location:** Gamma Wing - Containment Cell 506\n\n----\n\n**[02:00]** SCP-2006 sits in its chair, watching the 1959 horror film //The Tingler// for the sixth time in a row while assuming the form of \"the Gill-man\" from 1954's //Creature from the Black Lagoon//. It mumbles softly to itself.\n\n**[02:01]** SCP-2006's cell shakes slightly and its lights briefly dim. A distant rumbling sound is faintly audible. SCP-2006 looks up and the camera feed cuts out.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=reach.png\n| caption=[02:03], FRAME 2\n| width=200px\n| align=right]]\n\n**[02:03]** Site-118's security system receives two frames of video in immediate succession.\n\n__FRAME 1:__ SCP-2006's cell is dark, lit only by the television screen set to static. The chair has been shattered. A humanoid figure with indistinct features is huddled in the far corner of the room. A second figure is hanging upside down from the ceiling over the screen.\n\n__FRAME 2:__ SCP-2006's cell is even darker; the frame is solid black, save for the section featured in the attached image.\n\n**[02:05]** The cell's camera feed is reestablished. SCP-2006, now in human form and sitting in a still-intact chair, continues to watch the film as though nothing has happened.\n\n**[02:21]** //The Tingler// concludes. SCP-2006 becomes newly aware of its altered form. It appears confused and upset by this development, being seemingly unable to change its shape.\n\n**[02:29]** SCP-2006 starts to weep.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic curved\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-2006\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Randall Owings\n\n----\n\n//[SCP-2006 is slumped in its chair, staring at nothing. Its television is paused midway through the 1947 film// Scared to Death//. When Dr. Owings enters the cell, it jerks out of its stupor.]//\n\n**SCP-2006:** Miss Jo, you're finally b-- You're not Miss Jo.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** My name is Dr. Owings. I'll be performing your interviews for the time being while Researcher Lowe is indisposed.\n\n**SCP-2006:** Oh! You're Mister Randy! Miss Jo told me about you.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Please, call me Dr. Owings.\n\n**SCP-2006:** Okay. //[Pause.]// Is Miss Jo sick? I've never been left alone this long before.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Researcher Lowe is fine. She's... everyone's fine.\n\n//[SCP-2006 nods slowly.]//\n\n**SCP-2006:** I think //I// might be sick.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Can you tell me why?\n\n**SCP-2006:** I haven't been able to change the way I look for //days//. I've been stuck looking like some //lady// -- and not a monster lady, like a Dracula's daughter or a bride of Frankenstein or anything! It's awful.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Is that why you haven't done anything to frighten me? I'll admit I've been on tenterhooks ever since I walked in. I was sure you were about to do something truly blood-curdling, like, ah...\n\n**SCP-2006:** Like sneaking up behind you and shouting \"boo\"?\n\n//[Dr. Owings feigns a frightened shiver.]//\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Yes, like that. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it.\n\n//[SCP-2006 shrugs.]//\n\n**SCP-2006:** My heart's just not in it anymore, I guess.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Have you noticed anything else while you've been sick? Any strange sensations?\n\n**SCP-2006:** Um. When you feel shivery and hot and cold and like you want to hide under the bed, is that a sensation?\n\n**Dr. Owings:** That sounds like fear. Are you scared, SCP-2006?\n\n**SCP-2006:** I... Yes. I think so.\n\n**Dr. Owings:** Do you know why?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**SCP-2006:** I'm scared of whatever did this to me. And I'm scared it's just getting started.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[[/scp-8066/offset/1 | Refer to attached documentation for further information regarding associated anomalous phenomena.]]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@",
