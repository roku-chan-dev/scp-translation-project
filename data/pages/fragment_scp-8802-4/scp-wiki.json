In particular, in the past year, the HVAC system has curbed 17 potential K-class scenarios.\n> \n> These procedures are exactly what we need to contain SCP-8802-A's expanding zone of influence. \n> \n> //They need to be overhauled immediately.//\n> \n> As some of you may be aware: this morning, at 2:48 AM, a rental truck filled with high-yield explosives was parked outside a critical structural point of the concrete wall surrounding SCP-8802. The NYPD managed to apprehend the driver before he could detonate the bomb. \n> \n> The official cover story was that the driver was a domestic terrorist who idolized Timothy McVeigh. In reality, he was an Esto cultist who was attempting to provoke SCP-8802-A into spreading its area of influence across the whole Eastern seaboard. \n> \n> The bomber had accomplices, and they have yet to be found. Make no mistake, another attempt //will// be made. \n> \n> The gamble we've been taking in the middle of the United States' biggest city has become all too apparent. Only a total paradigm shift toward SCP-8802's containment can save us from the worst-case scenario.\n> \n> Therefore, we must find a way to neutralize SCP-8802 so that SCP-8802-A can be relocated somewhere less populous.\n> \n> * **All Recipients:** Gather information on the ritualistic aspects of SCP-8802. There must be a way to counteract SCP-8802-A's influence. One possibility is to enlist the aid of another deity from Corbenic. To that end, maintain contact with the Three Moons Initiative.\n> * **Containment Staff:** Testing is to be redoubled on methods to shrink the zone of influence. Access to anomalous methods will be granted on a case-by-case basis. I am also quadrupling the number of onsite security personnel.\n> * **NE Region:** The bomber was local. Prioritize the investigation of Esto activity in the area. Detain, question, and suppress as many adherents as possible. \n> * **Dr. Naismith:** To my understanding, SCP-7702-B is the \"VUUOU\" entity worshipped by SCP-8802-A. It's at your site, so have your team extract as much information from it as you can.\n> \n> Finally: if, after 30 days have passed and a new method of containment has not been achieved, we have authorized O5-4 to take command of SCP-8802's containment. She has personally overseen development of SANITAS, an experimental anomalous weapon designed to completely neutralize SCP-8802-A. SANITAS has a 20% chance of success, a 75% chance of failure, and a 5% chance of causing a thaumaturgical singularity that could liquefy all of Manhattan. \n> \n> No one but O5-4 has any interest in using it. But if I may be blunt, even less of us have interest in godlike control of the entire planet being given to Oscar the Grouch.\n> \n> You have until June 30th.\n> \n> [[>]]\n> //- O5-10//\n> [[/>]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #00cc99; background:#e6fff9; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n**Foundation.**\n\nThe dangers you have described are nothing new to the Initiative. In life, VUUOU the Defiler was anathema to the forces of peace and sanity in Corbenic. The fact that the Eighth Prince's dangerous teachings have gained traction in Earth-2N is certainly troubling.\n\nHowever, VUUOU is no longer alive in any meaningful sense of the word. Here's why.\n\nSeveral thousand years ago, Prince VUUOU was at the height of His power. (He also took a much different shape than what you have in containment: a gigantic feathered snail.) Without warning or provocation, He flooded the peaceful civilian prefecture of Nelaush-Gartakh with a tidal wave of Murk. The physical and psychological damage to the population won't be truly healed until at least 583 years from now. \n\nFor Lord JALAKÅRA, this tragedy was the final straw after aeons of forced annexations, celestial warfare, and abusive sibling dynamics. The Weaver commanded the Initiative to storm VUUOU's domain, Kegelapan.\n\nThe Battle of Kegelapan stands among the Initiative's proudest moments. Though VUUOU was the weakest of the Princes, He was a Prince nonetheless, with hordes of unwilling servants that had been mutated into wheezing, lurching weapons of mass destruction. 182 new chronic diseases were invented from this battle alone.\n\nPIPER, **an entity upon which NOTHING ELSE will be elaborated,** dealt the final blow against VUUOU, using **an experimental weapon that DOES NOT need to be explained.** \n\nThose born in Corbenic must never die, as the mortal world will be their afterlife. However, **this weapon that WILL remain vague** was able to diminish VUUOU's immortal soul into something unrecognizable and pathetic, so as to minimize collateral damage in His new environment. The result was SCP-7702-B. \n\nAnd now that you've contained VUUOU, there is no longer any reason to be concerned, nor is there any reason for us to involve ourselves. \n\nAs you have described the situation, SCP-8802-A is simply a dangerous reality bender who follows VUUOU's teachings. Its powers do not come from VUUOU, as He has nothing left to give. Even the signature Murk can be recreated using rudimentary thaumaturgy and household chemicals.\n\nAnd as much as we'd like to help you mitigate SCP-8802, the Threll Dominion just carpet-bombed Saklovai again, so we've got our hands full. There will be no further contact regarding SCP-8802-A or VUUOU.\n\nBut despite this, always remember...\n\n[[=]]\n+++ You are watched. You are protected.

Gotta pull it back on track.\n\n**O5-4:** Then let's change the subject. How's the reconstructive surgery going? Are you in any pain?\n\n**Naismith:** I mean, since I'm -- listen, Madam Overseer, you've got enough on your plate. You don't need to worry about me.\n\n**O5-4:** Answer the question.\n\n**Naismith:** Well, to put it mildly, this Vicodin hasn't done much to get the moss off my gumline.\n\n**O5-4:** Does it sting?\n\n**Naismith:** Yes. A lot. And it aches, swells, and creaks all at once.\n\n**O5-4:** Titillating. If I were you, I'd cut out the Vicodin altogether. \n\nYou could lose a lot of potential growth in the future unless you accept what's been given to you.\n\nTrace the outline of every microbe. Memorize the highways they cut through your membranes. Treat each one like a little treasure map. Germs are not pillaging invaders. They're gardeners, beautifying you in ways that are never truly apparent until the blooms unfurl in April.\n\n**Naismith:** Madam Overseer?\n\n**O5-4:** If you have something to say, speak plainly.\n\n**Naismith:** I should probably hang up now.\n\n**O5-4:** Whatever for?\n\n**Naismith:** I need to manage some of the stress we were talking about.\n\n**O5-4:** ...by telling someone what you've discovered about me, right?
