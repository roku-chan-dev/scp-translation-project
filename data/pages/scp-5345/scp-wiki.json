Shipping routes within the Yellow Sea have also been rerouted as to minimize any possible contact. The existence of SCP-5345 is obscured via operatives embedded in space administration institutions with satellite imaging capabilities, and the governments of the Republic and Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5345 is an uninhabited island located in the Yellow Sea at 35°██'██.█\"N, 125°██'██.█\"E. The island contains several heavily damaged structures, believed to have been office blocks and warehouses. Numerous abnormal rock salt formations have been observed to protrude from the floors and walls inside and around these structures. It is noted that a significant amount resemble human beings. \n\nThus far, 2 identical sets of thaumaturgic sigils of different sizes have been discovered, one of which had a diameter of 10 meters, and was bleached into the floor of a warehouse from regular usage. The other is approximated to have been several hundred kilometers in diameter, with only a fraction of the set being visible via aerial surveys. No activity was recorded during observation of these sets. \n\nIdentified sigils bear marked similarities to those used in known ontokinetic manifestations, thaumaturgical rituals, and temporal alteration incantations for or related to divinity, teleportation, and seances. It is believed they served as ascendance rituals to access afterlife locations, allowing for the transportation of matter and entities. Very few documents have been found that describe the exact methods and resources required to conduct such rituals, and thus they have not been attempted. \n\nGeographical surveys indicate the island did not form by natural means, which has been corroborated by evidence of several major thaumaturgic events detected during psychometric analysis. It is currently understood that SCP-5345 was an inland region within a larger landmass that was displaced from consensus reality via thaumaturgic means. It is expected that SCP-5345 will fully collapse into the Yellow Sea within the next 80 years due to a combination of wave erosion and tectonic shifts.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5345 was discovered on 21/08/1987, following the detection of a spike in several energy signatures, including electromagnetic, Humic waves, Akiva radiation, and Elan-Vital Energy, from its current location during routine surveillance from several Foundation satellites. Obfuscation protocols were successfully enacted to obscure SCP-5345's existence from surveillance satellite-capable states. Foundation naval and aerial assets were dispatched to investigate the island and evaluate any potential threats, but found nothing of immediate concern. Expeditions into SCP-5345 were approved shortly afterwards.\n\n**Addendum 5345.01:**\nTo date, numerous expeditions into SCP-5345 and its structures have been conducted. Identical insignia found on walls across several structures point towards SCP-5345 being the former site of a complex for an organization. Intact documents and audio recordings from interviews and surveillance recorders have been found in intact filing cabinets and safes. All recovered documents did not use the Hangul script, but instead used a modified version of the ʼPhags-pa script.[[footnote]] An alphabet developed by and for use within the Yuan Dynasty, falling out of use by the 14th century.

Once I had recovered from the flash and subsequent disorientation, I found myself floating-- no, more like standing on air, if that makes sense, over a lake valley populated by lotus flowers. It was oppressively calm. I could not find any strength in my legs to move about. I could only sit down and observe. I saw clouds nestled between green valleys and mountains, some of which were not connected to the ground at all.
