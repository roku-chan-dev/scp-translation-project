But every crisis brings opportunity with it. Six cases of the [[[project scarlet dawn|Washington Virion]]] have been confirmed. Only a fool would think it stops there. Already the Six Year Plan has been crushed; the seers left clueless, the factories helpless.\n \nHis Grace Met'heus had the right of it. Druv'tuul can only be saved by a central authority. My Insurgency is ready. We will not fail like those [[[armed-with-hell-flames-and-fury|idiots]]] in Silesia. I compel you to listen.

There is an empty subway station close by. These are not the only two entryways. Some passageways lead out, and others lead deeper still. The elevator is being manned by Yeren workers. The surface is not far away, yet they all carry the scent typical of Druv'tuul. Molten rock and earth.\n\n**Summary:**  The Sons of Phomet enter, led by Asbuk Inim. They smell of clear skies and bioweapons. \n\nThe workers notice the Sons. There are nods among themselves before the largest among them approaches the newcomers. The worker tells the Son the gate has stopped working. Inim does not believe the worker. They argue back and forth, but the workers stand firm.\n\nThe Sons are about to resort to violence. A young druid in the crowd beats them to it, starting to shout the words of an arcane chant. He is interrupted by a blow from Inim's battle staff. \n\nThe workers try to intervene. The Sons block them. Inim continues to beat the druid. He only stops when the youth says something between blows. It is too quiet for me to pick up.\n\nInim smiles. He orders the Sons back.  They leave the area with the druid in tow, held by two of their own.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\nAnd so the Sons of the lesser brother walk the road of kings.

And you're no elders of mine.\n\n//Multiple members let out a groll.//\n\n**Inim:** That a druid does not understand the pull shows how dire the situation is. Phomet teaches us that a place is its culture. When you had your little revolution you tore out that culture. Now Druv'tuul will be whole once again.\n\n**Yorung:** All you're feeling is the gravitational pull of Druv'tuul. You're just mystifying your heightened sense of it. I know about true mysteries and you have none of them.\n\n**Inim:** Stop talking and make yourself useful.

Our fight is for the soul of Druv'tuul.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Catalogue Number:** FR-49/101-001\n\n**Document Type:** Summary Report\n\n**Author:** Hundreds of eyes of the engine bearing witness at a third-ring living district\n\n**Location:** About three-quarters of the district is composed of standard Druv'tuul three-floor houses, a mix of metal and nature. Each one has a metallic cuboid framework surrounded by a single tree growing through and around it. Citizens have made minor changes to the template, growing a balcony or an outdoor staircase.\n\nThe last quarter of houses diverges entirely. Some overemphasize plants, growing their homes from various trees, while others discard them entirely in favour of metallic artwork. Those who can have turned any organic parts entirely inward. It is a preponed attempt at self-isolation. The streets are almost empty.\n\n**Summary:**  The Sons of Phomet pass through the district. They take Yorung with them. Most other Yeren on the streets largely avoid them where they can, except for a contingent of citizen soldiers. The soldiers have been following them since they first appeared in the city. For now, they keep their distance.\n\nThe Sons reach their target: The house of the confirmed infected and their family. The air here is thicker. A Yeren is seen briefly looking out the window, before quickly closing the curtains. The Sons do not approach the door. Instead one of them pulls out a titanian cage seed.\n\nHe throws it at the house. Within seconds, the whole house is enclosed by impenetrable wood. The soldiers act. Some rush towards the house, others towards the Sons. As the soldiers try and fail to pry the house open, the Sons only laugh. One of them playfully pulls out another seed, and the soldiers freeze.\n\nThe soldiers fall back into formation and begin to cast spells. Inim turns serious. He cites Druv'tuul's past agreement with the GOC, legitimizing their actions. The casting stops.\n\nWhen the Sons leave, the soldiers stay near the house, unsure and directionless. A furious Yorung is dragged along by the Sons as they search for their next target.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n\nDo the Sons take me for a fool? I grant you ignorance, yet you dare tempt what is mine. I may have had to sever arms to escape the virus's touch, but you will find me far from weak.\n\nTry all you might, Inim, but they are all still trapped in my [[[price-of-forty-days|Six Year Plan]]].\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Inim and Yorung enter the fifth ring, the innermost ring. A massive, inverted tree grows down into the chasm at the ring's centre, its branches growing sideways and downwards. Some branches serve as stairways between the pit's edge and the rest of the tree. Others are clearly only passageways for the alluru to reach the train station in the tree. The deepest branches reach the very bottom of the pit to mingle and entwine with the tendrils of a fungal network's hyphae.//\n\n//Inim and Yorung walk together towards the inverted tree. Inim shakes his head.//\n\n**Inim:** How you trample your legacy. The palace of Phomet's brother, where our freedom was bought. All of it gone.\n\n**Yorung:** //(scoffs)// Yeah, thankfully. Now this ring can actually serve its people.\n\n**Inim:** //(glances at Yorung)// Hmm. You said your teacher works here?\n\n**Yorung:** Yes.\n\n**Inim:** Then you have simply replaced one good king with thousands of bureaucrats.\n\n//Inim glances down at the fungal hyphae intermingling and merging with the tree's branches.//\n\n**Inim:** What is this?\n\n**Yorung:** //(eyes lighting up)// Something important to the Six Year Plan.\n\n**Inim:** Important how?\n\n**Yorung:** Well someone needs to connect all these visions of our future economy. If you want to conquer Druv'tuul, that's where you should start.\n\n**Inim:** //(furrows his brows)// Why the change in attitude?\n\n**Yorung:** //(coughs)// Maybe I've just decided overzealously following the quotes of a dead guy is the way to go after all.\n\n**Inim:** //(shakes his head)// Your blasphemy won't help you. That's enough stalling, we're going in.\n\n//The two of them enter the tree via a branch growing towards them, forming a staircase.//\n\n-----\n\n//The chamber's ceiling is lined with golden leaves until it shines like a starry sky. Many coloured vines hang freely from above, some glowing from within. The Archdruid-Seer sits at the far end of the chamber, her hands intertwined with the branches of the tree.

Just tell us about any virus carriers we haven't found yet.\n\n**Seer:** So you can sit on that information to prolong your stay? No.\n\n**Inim:** //(grips his battle staff)// Phomet teaches us that there are times when a chosen path is too costly to stay on. Can you afford yours?\n\n**Seer:** //(lip twitches)//  It's you who can't afford it. Your GOC contract may protect your 'quarantine' measures, but see what happens if you attack a seer.\n\n**Inim:** We'll find someone else.\n\n**Seer:**  In case you haven't noticed, Druv'tuul's six-year plan was derailed by the virus. You'll have a difficult time finding any seer who isn't busy constructing the new plan.\n\n**Inim:** ...I don't know what you see in it. How can you still have faith, even after the plan failed to uphold its promise of a future where production meets demand in precision? Faith must follow from fact. Yours is nothing but a misplaced belief. Delusion.\n\n**Seer:** Try finding your foothold with someone else. You won't have luck with the seers. And be quick about it. That contract of yours was with the old government. I can guarantee the Republic will have it annulled as soon as possible.\n\n**Inim:** Yeah. //(looks around the room and the expansive vines displayed for druid use)// So much for equality. //(leaves)//\n\n//Yorung hesitates, then moves to follow Inim. A moment before he can leave, the Archdruid opens all her eyes.//\n\n**Seer:** You better not go out again without the mask.\n\n//Yorung clicks his tongue, but obeys.
