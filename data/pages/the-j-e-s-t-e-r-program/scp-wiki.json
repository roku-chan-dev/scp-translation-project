The band promoted the item as a way to “Tear down the walls that separate us” and to “…destroy the prisons of our tyrants”.//\n\n------\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Anomalous Encounter Reports]]\n\n**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/april-9th-2690 | April 9th, 2690]]]**\n//As humanity grew closer to the stars, the Foundation began to manage threats across the entire Solar System. The Fifth Church started a pilgrimage directly into the Sun, and the Solar Occult Coalition is currently attempting to eliminate the Crab Pulsar. The primary cause behind this interstellar expansion was the destruction of Earth by SCP-094.//\n\n------\n\n**[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/please-say-my-name | Please, Say My Name]]]**\n//Fortunately for the Foundation and everyone it protects, by the late 2020's, all communicable infohazards were effectively neutralized, simplifying some of the organization's most complicated containment procedures. No one could spread their dangerous ideas to anyone else ever again. Unfortunately, this was a byproduct of the world's inability to communicate anything at all.//\n\n------\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Intercepted GoI Documentation]]\n%E4roR@!

I now have a place on the mainlist, and this brings me great joy. Should out to my main man the Father Almighty for letting me copy his [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho | original idea.]]]\n* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/april-9th-2690 | April 9th, 2690]]]: I was surprised to see that this relatively popular Series I had no tales written about it, so, following a challenge I found in the forums, I gave it one. I'm debating plans to expand on the universe I've set up here; I don't want to get ahead of myself, but //SCP Trek//[[footnote]]Please note that J E S T E R firmly belives that Star Wars is the superior franchise by merit of Prequel Memes alone.[[/footnote]] could be really cool.\n* [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/please-say-my-name | Please, Say My Name]]]: [[[SCP-3449]]], only two slots up and of far better quality than my first SCP, really got me wondering about the implications of its world, similarly to [[[SCP-094]]] and my first tale. Mixed it with probably the most iconic infohazard on the site and got this. Writing was done probably within an hour, but it took me several days to post it - failure scares me, and so does appearing like I'm leeching off two //much// better pieces. Thankfully, it survived.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n;; Close J E S T E R\n;; Are You Sure? [Y] or [N]\n;; \"Y\"\n;; Goodbye.
