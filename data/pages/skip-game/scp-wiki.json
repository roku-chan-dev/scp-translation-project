Are Halloween parties the perfect place for a containment breach? And are teens doing anomalous seasonal TikTok challenges? It's a complicated question. \n\nEvery year, police warn about drugs in Halloween candy. But this year, we have a new problem for parents to protect their children from. If you've been keeping up with the news you'll know that newly-publicized \"anomalies\" can hide anywhere. And that means children's candy as well. \n\nWe did our OWN research and found a since-retracted document from the Global Occult Coalition published in 2003 suggesting taste-based cognitohazards are a real threat? Clearly parents shouldn't take this risk. So how do you detect if little Timmy is about to swallow an eldritch monstrosity? Well that's where **Today's sponsor, SkipSensor** comes in!  SkipSensor comes with over 100 hume monitoring processors and 10 different scanning modes! Simply swipe it over your kids candy, and it will be easy to keep harmful effects away from your precious family. \n\nNext up, keeping safe at Halloween parties.

Keep your teen safe with the all new \"**SCPinger Instant Help Radio!** For just $42.99 your teen can walk home safely with the Foundation just a button click away! \n\nFinally, it's the Skip Game challenge. A recent trend on SnapChat has encouraged teens with mild anomalous effects to STEAL things from teachers with their so-called \"superpowers\". Your teen may be participating in this dangerous activity, so sign up for **Full-Time Phone Memetic Monitoring by ANOMATRUTHS**. At an affordable $30 a month you can make sure your child isn't participating in these dangerous behaviors! \n\nAll of us parents would appreciate if the next challenge is the \"Working Hard is An Anomalous Power\" challenge. \n\n\nCOMMENTS: \n\n#1: MOMOF2KIDS2022 Said: ISNT THAT THE TRUTH. DONT WANT MY KID EATING ANYTHING BUT NATURAL CANDY. \n\n    #3: MSCPGA2024 Said: And who put the Anomalies in candy? Probably the deep state, the Foundation isn't really running things we all know. #ClefAnon\n\n#2: MSCPGA2024 Said:\nMy daughter's boyfriend must be an anomaly because he disappeared. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n//Anne, this is madness. Between this and latest \"096ing\" challenge on TikTok, who knows where we're headed?//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
