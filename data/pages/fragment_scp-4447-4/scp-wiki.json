Testing must be approved by two Level-4 personnel. All subjects must wear GPS-tracking anklets.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4447 is a stainless steel Engineer's Ring. When exposed to a weak psychic emanation, it can instantly exchange the positions of any two humans within 15 km of the Earth's surface. This also swaps clothing, accessories, and carried luggage, though has a mass limit based on the strength of the possessor's psychic will. The typical human can transport 120-180 kg if physical contact is maintained with SCP-4447. It is unknown how the ring gained its anomalous properties.\n\n**Recovery:** Following an investigation by the Department of Analytics, former researcher Sasha Brown's location was tracked to a Marshall, Carter and Dark facility. Foundation agents initiated a raid, causing Brown to escape using SCP-4447. Communication with Brown was established under the guise of emergency evacuation procedures by the GoI, and she was deceived into exchanging positions with a D-class subject held in a containment chamber. Upon arrival, Brown was immediately sedated and given a GPS-tracking anklet. A standard humanoid search revealed SCP-4447 as the origin of associated anomalous properties.\n\nResearcher Sasha Brown is currently undergoing disciplinary hearings for their concealment of an anomalous artifact and using said artifact for monetary gain.",
