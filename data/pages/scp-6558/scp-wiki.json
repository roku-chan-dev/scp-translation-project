Incinerate the device you are using to read this file.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6558 is a phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages[[footnote]] It has mainly affected SCP documents, but some internal memos and other logs have been affected. [[/footnote]]. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations[[footnote]] See Addendum 6558.1 for examples of affected documents. [[/footnote]]. All references to SCP-6558 vary wildly. Using context from the infected files, SCP-6558 has been described as a toy plane, green moss, a sound frequency, a time-traveling jester, a dog, and the feeling of love.\n\nAlthough descriptions manifested by SCP-6558 have been overall incoherent, since its discovery, the descriptions have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant.\n\nIt is not fully known how SCP-6558 is able to spread. However, it has been determined that the higher the number of documents and devices containing info relating to SCP-6558, the quicker it spreads. Currently, all documents infected by SCP-6558 have been confined to the SCiPnet servers.\n\n**Addendum 6558.1 Instance Archive:**\nThe following are recorded instances of SCP-6558 before their removal[[footnote]] Please remember to add your instance to this list.
