Picture taken 15 hours after SCP-7171-α.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** As of 2029, SCP-7171 has reached its perihelion. However, due to the current state of technology and the massive distance there is between SCP-7171 and Earth, containment is currently deemed implausible. Otherwise, the anomaly is to be kept under constant surveillance by Jupiter-stationed Foundation probes to determine whether the most plausible contingency plan should be activated or not.\n\n**SPECIFIC CONTINGENCY PROTOCOLS:** The \"containment\" of SCP-7171 is to be centered around the dissemination of misinformation to the public, no matter the current status of modern society. The SCP Foundation is to be represented as a non-governmental organization dedicated to the protection of humanity and the survival of human civilization. A plausible excuse or cover story is to be developed and scattered across the remnants of society to hide the true nature of SCP-7171-α.\n\nShould any personnel enter a state of panic because of the impending XK-Class (\"End of the World\") Scenario, they are to be detained and sedated. Patience is to be kept until a solution to SCP-7171-α is found.\n\nFurther containment procedures are currently being drafted and decided by the O5 Council and the Foundation's higher administration. Dr. Maurice Arkand has been promoted as the Department of Para-Astronomy's head, and all suggestions and complaints regarding SCP-7171 are to be redirected to him for the time being.\n\n----\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7171 is the designation given to a Class-XI tychekinetic Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO), currently located 25 AU away from the Sun. Prior to SCP-7171-α, SCP-7171 took the form of a contact binary[[footnote]]Contact binaries are singular celestial bodies composed of the conjunction between 2 bodies.[[/footnote]]comprised of 2 diminutive asteroids, both estimating an approximate length of 5 km in diameter each.\n\nSCP-7171 was, until SCP-7171-α occurred, the originator of the Solar System's baseline, local probability. However, following SCP-7171-α, SCP-7171's primary properties were heavily affected, thus altering local probability on a gargantuan scale. In other words, things that were deemed very unlikely or almost impossible to happen were now given a higher chance of occurring depending on how damaged SCP-7171 was.\n\nSCP-7171-α refers to an event caused by the sudden impact of SCP-7171 with an indeterminate object, presumed to be an asteroid of similar diameter. The exact details of SCP-7171-α's origin are unknown, but it is known that:\n\n* SCP-7171-α's occurrence is extremely detrimental to SCP-7171 and its properties, as it is now vulnerable to other objects within the Kuiper Belt.\n* SCP-7171-α occurred spontaneously and by chance.\n* SCP-7171-α's occurrence resulted in SCP-7171 being heavily damaged, as one of its 2 sections is now cracked and a small crater has been formed in it. This was captured by one of Project FORTUNA-ASTREA's probes prior to deactivation.\n\nAs SCP-7171 resulted in baseline probability being heavily altered, the chances of natural catastrophes occurring are now higher. See Addendum 1 for more information.\n\n----\n\n**AUDIO LOG:** 11/06/2029\n\nOn the late morning of 07/06/2029, following the discovery of SCP-7171 on Neptune's orbit by a modified //Hestia// probe, all contact with it was lost and a global power outage occurred for 40 seconds.

Below is a concise list of SCP-7171's perceived effects as of 7 days after SCP-7171-α.\n\n* Objects in the Kuiper Belt and its proximities have suffered significant modifications in their orbits, causing many asteroids to gain acceleration and abandon the Kuiper Belt. Said asteroids are expected to traverse both in and outside the Sol System, judging by their current situation. SCP-7000's integrity is at high risk and other bodies in the Sol System could be affected by similar effects in the nearby future.\n\n* The number of solar flares observed on Sol's surface have increased by 200%. This poses a risk of a geomagnetic storm in the near future if this behaviour is to continue. This geomagnetic storm could potentially damage electrical equipment on Earth, putting several Foundation Sites at risk of containment breaches.\n\n* The height of tidal waves has increased by an average of 2 meters. While not confirmed, this may be due to SCP-7171 direct effects on Luna. A short study conducted by AIC Binary Star suggests that the orbit of the Earth's moon has reduced its radius and will most likely continue to do so in the future. A collision with Earth could happen in a time span of 15 years.\n\nBecause of this, the Department of Para-Astronomy has officially recognized the threat that SCP-7171 now poses to the Foundation and humanity as a whole. The results of SCP-7171's effects could lead to both a potential IK-Class (\"Collapse Of Global Civilization\") Scenario, and a devastating PK-Class (\"Probability Restructuring\") Scenario. Site-47's main focus is now set on the containment of SCP-7171 and damage control.\n\nThe following is a timeline of several events that have occurred globally because of SCP-7171.\n\n**UPDATE 1/08/2029:** Two months after SCP-7171-α, the previously detailed effects have continued to occur and increased significantly in intensity. Human society as a whole has observed and experienced the effects of SCP-7171. While the Veil has been maintained, humanity as a whole has already acknowledged the situation and several countries are in a permanent state of alarm. All Foundation Sites have ceased their primary research functions regarding low-priority anomalies.\n\n----\n\n**UPDATE 7/08/2029:** An unprecedented earthquake of magnitude 7.3 occurred in South Carolina, demolishing Site-19. Several containment breaches occurred, however, a new set of safety protocols prevented many personnel casualties.\n\n----\n\n**UPDATE 12/08/2029:** Abnormal weather conditions have been observed in Europe and Western Asia. This has resulted in a major decrease in food production. The use of self-replicating food anomalies has been considered to reduce the effects of famine caused by current events. Approval pending.\n\n----\n\n**UPDATE 17/08/2029:** On this day, a meteorite impacted Site-47's South Building[[footnote]]This building was the Department of Anomalous Manufacturing's base of operations.[[/footnote]]. Despite measuring approximately 300 meters prior to entering Earth's atmosphere, the meteorite lost only 16% of its original mass as opposed to the average 95% in all other cases. The meteorite that landed on Site-47 was noted to be 9 meters long. The other half of the meteorite, which landed in Kansas, United States, was reported to have a length of 16 meters upon impact.\n\nThe following transcript was attached to the log.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[div class=\"doc\"]]\nVIDEO LOG\n[[/div]]\n\n**DATE:** 17/08/2029\n\n----\n\n**Assisting Personnel:** Dr. Maya Dawson, Agt.

Are you alright?\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** Yeah. I wasn't in the building when it collapsed. It did catch five people inside though. They've already been transported to the sick bay for treatment.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Yeah, I've heard.\n\n**Agent Lindberg:** Alright, dear. I think we should get moving.\n\n(//Dr. Dawson gets in the back of the car.//)\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** How is the rest of the Site doing?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Not good, for sure. Everyone is losing their cool. This incident, summed up with the multiple containment breaches occurring at other sites is really putting everyone crazy. They can't go back home, they can't see their families... On top of that, a lot of people are being moved to a new position to help with densely populated cities, and SCP-7171.\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** Has the O5 Council said anything?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** No, the last time we heard anything of them was over a week ago. I've been trying to catch their attention with the whole building incident but they are so adamant about not reading my messages.\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** Maybe something happened to them, who knows?\n\n(//Agent Lindberg looks at Dr. Dawson from the vehicle's rear-view mirror.//)\n\n**Agt. Lindberg:** The Council? (//Chuckles.//) They have the best protection on the entire planet, they'll be the last ones to go down, if not you or me.\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** Fair enough.

How are we meant to fix this?\n\n(//Dr. Dawson pats Dr. Arkand's shoulder and smiles slightly.//)\n\n**Dr. Dawson:** We'll figure something out.

You and Lacroix are my closest friends. Probably the best. We've been there for each other in our highs and we will remain together for our lows, right?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** I- ...Nevermind.

Shortly thereafter, a larger snowstorm manifested throughout the entirety of Kamchatka and Alaska. Approximately 1.540 individuals died due to avalanches. Site-94 was successfully decommissioned and all of its personnel were evacuated to a secure bunker on Kodiak Island.\n\n----\n\n**UPDATE 22/08/2029:** Mercury is engulfed by a massive solar flare.

If we're lucky enough it might be able to fill 7171's cracks or clean it from any rubble. Maybe \"fix\" it?\n\n**O5-8:** A probe would prove worthless against SCP-7171's effects. The closer it gets to it, the more the likelihood of it being destroyed increases exponentially. The chance of Nyx piercing through the surface of Hydra was extremely unlikely, but look at what happened. Unlikely things are now likely to happen because of this... This turgid thing.\n\n**O5-7:** I agree with Eight. There is no guarantee that that will work, at all.\n\n**O5-11:** I mean. Maybe, just maybe, its effects could be overpowered by sending enough drones and probes so that the possibilities of all of them failing are minimum to practically none. If it's just about trying enough times, then... Why- Why don't we try every single time at once?\n\n**O5-4:** We're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis right now and the production cost of each of those probes is incredibly expensive. Considering our situation, this is way over our capabilities.\n\n**O5-11:** Then we will have to use everything we've got and redirect all of our funds to them.\n\n**O5-9:** To what purpose? Just, for what? To waste our money on something that might not even work? This will cost lives, lots of lives.\n\n**O5-6:** That is correct. It's obviously gonna cost us a ton of lives, of course.

They grabbed a revolver out of their pocket and put it to their head. They escaped the Foundation and ran into the afterlife, much like Maya.\n\n**O5-4:** Did they hold an important role within the project?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** They designed the probes.\n\n**O5-4:** Then they must've been a valued member, from what I see.
