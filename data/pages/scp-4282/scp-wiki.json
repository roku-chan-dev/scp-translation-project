The care and maintenance procedures for SCP-4282 are identical to any non-anomalous black powder cap-and-ball firearm. Testing of SCP-4282 must be authorized by a Level-3 researcher or higher.\n\nBe advised that SCP-4282's anomalous ability will target individuals that meet the either of the following criteria:\n# Guilty of theft of any nautical vessel, including non-motorized vessels such as sailing boats, canoes, and kayaks. Also includes sub-nautical vessels (submarines.) Vessels must be capable of containing human occupants.\n# Guilty of \"piracy\" as defined by Title 18 Chapter 81 of the United States Code. (SCP-4282's criteria are slightly broader, but this definition will suffice for testing and containment purposes.)\n\n//Note: Any Foundation personnel stationed at Site-68 that meet the above requirements in any way should contact their immediate supervisor for transfer. See Incident Report 4282-A.//\n\n**Description:** SCP-4282 is a .44 caliber single shot black powder handgun that utilizes a percussion cap as a primer. The operation of SCP-4282 is identical to any other muzzle loading black powder firearm, except that projectiles loaded into the muzzle do not directly exit the barrel.\n\nUpon firing SCP-4282, the nearest living human guilty of piracy or theft of a nautical vessel will suffer a fatal gunshot wound to the back of the head. Wounds caused by SCP-4282 are consistent between targets, featuring an entry wound through the parietal bone of the cranium and an exit wound through the right eye socket, although some cases present larger exit wounds than others.\n\nAnalysis of the entry wounds reveal burns consistent with black powder and a .44 caliber hole, suggesting a point-blank shot from a muzzle loading black powder firearm. In conjunction, high speed footage of SCP-4282 reveals that the projectile does not exit the barrel directly, but instead teleports to the nearest offender that meets the criteria, regardless of distance. Fired shots retain their velocity  and lethality, but are dependent on an adequate powder charge.\n\nEngraved on the right side of the barrel in cursive are the words, \"Mutiny's Bane.\"\n\n//Note: It was initially believed that SCP-4282 simply kills its user, but Foundation testing has clarified the function of the firearm, described above. For more insight into testing of SCP-4282, see the test results below.//\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-4282 came to the attention of the Foundation when security footage from the bridge of the M.V. //Almezaan,// a general cargo vessel operating off the Horn of Africa, was intercepted by a Foundation operative embedded in the British Navy. The security footage log is attached.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Security Footage Log\" hide=\"- Security Footage Log\"]]\n\n> **Timestamp: ██-██-2004 @1128 hours**\n> \n> Security cameras record the events of a hijacking by a group of Somali pirates. The incident provokes an immediate response by special forces operating from the British frigate H.M.S. //Monmouth,// but not before a hostage situation evolved on the bridge involving the \"lead\" pirate and the Second Officer of the //Almezaan.//\n> \n> The pirate, who has expended all of the ammunition in his AK-47 rifle, pulls SCP-4282 from his satchel and holds it against the officer's head, clearly unaware of its anomalous property.\n> \n> Special forces breach the control room, at which point the pirate panics, firing SCP-4282 at point blank range into the officer's right temple.\n> \n> Footage then shows the pirate's right eye explode, ejecting a sizable chunk of the cranium and some brain matter. Simultaneously, the special forces operative breaching the room is struck in the upper thigh with a .44 caliber lead ball.\n> \n> No further anomalous activity is recorded.\n> \n> //Note: The Second Officer suffered only a perforated eardrum and some minor burns. MV Almezaan was recaptured without further casualty or injury.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nReports turned over by the British reveal that the lead ball was in fact fired from SCP-4282, despite the firearm not being aimed at either the pirate or the special forces operative. An inspection of the bridge proved that the shot could not have come from outside the room.\n\nClass-A Amnestics were administered to individuals who were involved or had knowledge of the hostage situation on the bridge. All other aspects of the incident, including the hijacking itself, did not require action on the part of the Foundation, as all anomalous activity was contained on the bridge, and the wounds inflicted by SCP-4282 were explained by non-anomalous gunfire.\n\n**Testing:** The projectiles should be .440 round lead ball, and the powder charge should be measured at 20 grains of 3F powder or equivalent. Modern No. 11 percussion caps are adequate for use with the firearm.\n\nAs a fail-safe, two (2) D-Class personnel that meet the testing criteria (see containment procedures) must be present whenever SCP-4282 is to be loaded and fired. These D-Class personnel will take a primary (D-1) and secondary (D-2) position of three (3) meters and five (5) meters from the firearm respectively. As soon as SCP-4282 is loaded, all D-Class personnel must be treated as loaded firearms, and as such will be faced towards the firing range and away from all Foundation researchers at all times. All other personnel must remain outside the 5 meter radius during testing.\n\nAll D-Class subjects used in testing must be fitted with a protective Kevlar helmet capable of nullifying the lethal effect of SCP-4282's bullet.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test Results\" hide=\"- Test Results\"]]\n\nThe following is a summation of SCP-4282's anomalous abilities as discovered in testing. A comprehensive test log can be found here: [[[*scp-4282-comprehensive-test-log | SCP-4282 Test Log]]]\n\n# SCP-4282 has a range greater than ███ kilometers. An upper limit on this range has not yet been discovered.\n# The bullet fired by SCP-4282 can be stopped before striking the targeted individual by use of a helmet.\n# SCP-4282 does not target deceased humans.\n# SCP-4282 does not recognize the theft of a model or toy vessel.\n# SCP-4282 will recognize a stolen vessel as small as a kayak or canoe.\n# In most cases, replacing any part of SCP-4282 will cause it to become inert. For an exception to this, see Incident Report 4282-B.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Report 4282-A\" hide=\"- Incident Report 4282-A\"]]\n\n> On 02-10-2005 at approximately 1125 hours, [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/try-and-remember Junior Researcher Helm], who was on lunch in the cafeteria at the time, was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head consistent with SCP-4282's anomalous ability. The incident coincided with a test being conducted on the other side of Site-68.\n> \n> It was later discovered that the D-Class involved in the test as the \"target\" had been falsely accused of the theft and sinking of a yacht belonging to a wealthy oil tycoon in 1987.\n> \n> The crime that Junior Researcher Helm committed that caused SCP-4282 to target him is unknown.\n\n//\"Testing procedures have been updated to reflect this incident by including a fail-safe secondary subject, and it is recommended that future screening of D-Class subjects be conducted in a more thorough fashion. These safety oversights in testing will not be tolerated by The Foundation, and Dr. ████ has been reprimanded appropriately. I will oversee testing of SCP-4282 from this point forward.\" -Dr. Leyland//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Report 4282-B\" hide=\"- Incident Report 4282-B\"]]\n\n> On 02-16-2005 at approximately 1245 hours, a test of SCP-4282 was conducted in which the barrel was replaced with an identical replica in order to discern which component of the firearm produced the anomalous effect.\n> \n> Upon replacing the barrel, SCP-4282 \"malfunctioned.\" The projectile left the barrel directly, traveled approximately 1.5 meters, and stopped mid flight. Researchers reported a low hum, presumably caused by the bullet vibrating vigorously in mid air, as observed in high speed footage. The bullet remained in this state for approximately 6 seconds before disappearing.\n> \n> 14 seconds after this event, the bullet began to reappear and disappear at seemingly random points in space around the firing range. High speed footage reveals that the direction of the round each time it reappeared was erratic, but the velocity was consistent with a normal shot. SCP-4282 did not appear to be able to target any specific individual.\n> \n> The round continued in its erratic behavior long enough to destroy a Foundation surveillance camera and strike Dr. Leyland in his lower left calf muscle, where the bullet remained until it could be surgically removed. Dr. Leyland reported a significant amount of pain caused by the round vibrating inside his leg for several minutes after the wound was inflicted.\n> \n> As of 03-19-2005, Dr. Leyland has fully recovered from his injuries.\n\n//\"In light of recent events involving SCP-4282, I am indefinitely suspending any test that proposes alterations to the firearm itself. This includes attempting to duplicate or alter the anomalous ability for use by the Foundation.\" -Dr. Leyland//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 4282-12.06.2011:** On the noted date, Foundation algorithms picked up a mention of the words, \"Mutiny's Bane\" in an online blog-post from an amateur treasure hunter.\n\nThe individual discovered a small chest washed up on the beaches of the Akumal village in Quintana Roo, Mexico. The chest contained a wooden insert with two spaces carved out in the shape of two pistols. Underneath the insert was a scroll with a handwritten poem.\n\n> //Beware all ye dogs who pillage and plunder//\n> //Those who would take what they ought not own//\n> //Lest your head from your neck be rent asunder//\n> //Heed my fair warning and let it be known//\n> \n> //That the Bane of Mutiny and the Helmsman’s Wrath//\n> //Do guard the long decks of this galleon so fine//\n> //Know that death himself will follow your path//\n> //If you board this great vessel with greed in your mind//\n\nBoth the chest and the scroll have been transferred to Site-68 and should be kept in containment with SCP-4282.\n\nWhile there is clear evidence that a second pistol could have existed alongside SCP-4282, it is unclear if it has similar anomalous properties, or even if it still exists. Until there is tangible evidence for the object referred to as the \"Helmsman's Wrath,\" it will not receive an SCP designation.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4281]]] | SCP-4282 | [[[SCP-4283]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
