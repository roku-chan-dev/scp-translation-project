Crow]]], utilizing [[[SCP-914]]] in obtaining base materials for the \"[[[Olympia Project]]]\".\n\n**Date:** 05/12/2008\n\n**Pre-Experiment Note:**\n//This is to produce the base materials I need for the project. I had to reassemble the subject that I was originally going to use, because after having a talk with [[[dr gears s personnel file |Dr. Gears]]], I discovered that I would be unable to use the composite part as I had originally intended, and am instead forced to use the entire subject.// - Professor Crow\n\n+++ Test-1\n\n**Input:** \n* Caucasian female, thirty-six (36) years of age, five (5) foot, ten (10) inches in height, one hundred and forty-nine (149) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health, although there is some mild liver damage from excessive drinking.\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nAn organism that appeared to be a young tree sapling weighing one hundred and fifty-nine (159) pounds, the bark being a pale gray color, and the leaves dark brown. Organism maintained an average constant external temperature of thirty seven (37) degrees.\n\nOrganism has a limited motor nervous system, although there appears to be no true central nervous system. Tissue samples extracted from the main trunk, branches and leaves show that the internal tissue of the trunk is similar to brain tissue, only restructured to be much more durable, and with a higher level of conductivity, whereas branches had traces similar to muscle tissue. The leaves contained a high amount of trichome hairs, which were much longer and thicker than average, being near an inch in length, and a light brown in color. Further examination showed them to be composed primarily of keratin. \n\nOrganism responded much more slowly to external stimuli than most organisms, taking three hours to register the tissue harvesting done to its main trunk.\n\nSubject has also shown limited signs of sentience, although communication is difficult, due to the slow reaction and movement times of the subject.\n\n**Note:** //While the subject is indeed interesting, and does warrant further examination, it's not what I was looking for. Inter her outside, near the grove, and make sure she's well looked after.//\n\n+++ Test-2\n\n**Input:**\n* Asian female, twenty-nine (29) years in age, five (5) foot, three (3) inches in height, one hundred and twenty-seven (127) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-143]]].\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\n* A solid ten (10) pound block of various compounds that are mainly found within the human body.\n\n* Human female with vaguely Asian features, with the same proportions and weight as the input subject. Skin is light gray, and hair has changed to a slightly translucent pink, similar to the leaves of SCP-143.\n\nPhysiology remains mostly the same, although subjects skin has displayed distinct photosynthetic qualities, and tissue has the same basic material properties as SCP-143.\n\n**Note:** //This is more along the lines of what I was looking for. Hopefully, the rest of the tests will go similarly to this one.//\n\n+++ Test-3\n\n**Input:**\n* Black female, thirty-two (32) years of age, six (6) foot in height, one hundred and seventy-one (171) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nA solid statue of the subject composed of a combination of SCP-148 and a variety of compounds found in the human body, weighing one hundred and eighty-one (181) pounds and having the same dimensions as the subject before hand. No life signs.\n\n**Notes:** //Great,// another //lawn ornament. Complete, and total, failure.//\n\n+++ Test-4\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, thirty-three (33) years of age, five (5) foot, four (4) inches in height, one hundred and thirty-five (135) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Mild damage to lungs due to excessive smoking.\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]]\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\nA large spherical object weighing one hundred and forty-five (145) pounds in weight, and one (1) foot in diameter. Object is highly ornate, with raised patterns on the surface, which through further investigation appear to be made of bone. The rest of the exterior is a compound composed partially of SCP-148 and iron, with trace samples of other elements found within the human body.\n\nObject is slightly warm, being twenty-five (25) degrees Celsius on the surface. When a subject is in close physical proximity to the object, subject is capable of seeing \"beyond the normal human spectrum of reality\" as stated by one subject. This ability increases exponentially when in physical contact with the object. There were no extreme ill effects aside from increasingly severe headaches from prolonged exposure, although this is merited to the inability of the human mind to comprehend such things.\n\nWhen asked what exactly the subject meant by its previous statement, the subject went on to say that it was possible to \"see\" thoughts and the \"lifeforce\" of living organisms. The subject went on to say that he had seen other things which were impossible to explain with words, and that even thinking about them gave him a headache.\n\n**Note:** //Again, interesting, but again, utterly useless to what I'm trying to do.//\n\n+++ Test-5\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, twenty-five (25) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height and one hundred and thirty-seven (137) pounds in weight. Subject is in exceptionally good health. The subject had been a long distance runner before her incarceration.\n\n* Ten (10) pounds of [[[SCP-148]]].\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\nHuman female, one hundred and forty-seven (147) pounds in weight, with the same dimensions as the original subject. Skin has taken on a lightly greenish pallor and has hardened considerably, yet remains somewhat malleable. Tissue has become denser, leading to an increase in physical resilience. It is expected that subject will be resilient to mental attacks and probing as well.\n\n**Notes:** //That's better. That's more along the lines of what I'm looking for.//\n\n+++ Test-6\n\n**Input:**\n* Asian female, twenty (20) years of age, five (5) foot six (6) inches and one hundred and forty-two (142) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\nSixty-four (64) arthropods, one (1) foot in size, similar to beetles in appearance. Subjects all possessed a molded metal human face on their underside, which resembled the original subject. Subjects' shells appeared to be made of a substance similar to glass, allowing their internal workings to be viewed easily. Close examination of the subjects revealed that they were composed of a hybrid of powerful circuitry and high-density crystal.\n\n**Note:** //That... was just kinda weird.//\n\n+++ Test-7\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, thirty-five (35) years of age, five (5) foot nine (9) inches in height and one hundred and fifty-three (153) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Subject has had a hysterectomy, though that has no effect on her overall health.\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nEighty-one (81) various objects primarily composed of metal and glass, all capable of fitting together to form a large statue or mannequin of a human female of the same dimensions and features as the original subject.\n\nWhen the subject is completely and correctly put together, it will take on a limited semblance of life and begin to speak. It primarily speaks several cryptic phrases regarding the future of the one who put it together, or in the case of multiple persons, the one who did the majority of the work. The phrases are often so vague, that it is impossible to determine whether or not the suggested future will, or even has already taken place. However, occasionally, it will speak plainly with no doubt as to what it is referring to. In these cases, the action always comes to pass, sometimes as a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nOnce it is done speaking, it will fall apart into the original eighty-one (81) pieces that comprise it. This can be done a limitless amount of times, with no unforeseen side effects, nor does the device ever repeat itself.\n\n**Notes:** //A giant jigsaw puzzle that tells the future... Well that's a new one.//\n\n+++ Test-8\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, forty-eight (48) years of age, four (4) foot ten (10) and one hundred and thirteen (113) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nA large, electronic device in the shape of the original subject. It appears to be a multicore supercomputer, although this needs to be confirmed. There are several dozen entry points on the back, corresponding to most cables that could or would need to be attached to a computer of this magnitude, as well as several that do not correspond to anything on record. Further research on object is pending.\n\n**Note:** //Hmmm.... Close, but wrong side of the line.//\n\n**11/12/2008**\n\n+++ Test-9\n\n**Input:**\n* Black female, thirty-seven (37) years of age, five (5) foot seven (7) inches and one hundred and fifty-one (151) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* One (1) Cray CX1, sixty-four (64) core, entry-level massively parallel supercomputer.\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\n* A large block of \"waste\" material, weighing six thousand, four hundred and twenty-eight (6,428) pounds, and composed primarily of metal, glass, plastic, rubber and traces of human tissue.\n\n* Human female, with exact same dimensions as the original subject. However, x-rays and scans of subjects skull has revealed that the brain has now been hybridized with a large amount of electronics on a cellular level, leading to a startling jump in intelligence, multitasking, logic, and memorization capabilities, as well as leading to a higher level of coordination in regards to movement.\n\n**Notes:** //Ha ha! It worked this time!//\n\n+++ Test-10\n\n**Input:** \n* Caucasian female, twenty-five (25) years of age, five (5) foot, seven (7) inches in height, and one hundred and thirty-nine (139) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major medical issues.\n\n* One (1) pill of [[[SCP-500]]]\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nOne human female of the same dimensions as the original subject. Subject appeared to be normal until approached by staff. Subject then proceeded to open its thoracic cavity, wrap a large, sinuous tongue around the closest researcher and attempted to pull him inside the cavity, most likely to consume him. \n\nHowever, personnel on call in the room were prepared for such an event, and fired several high-dosage tranquilizer darts at the subject, effectively knocking it out. The researcher survived, with no wounds, although it is recommended he see an on site psychologist for counseling.\n\nCloser examination of the subject revealed that the entire thoracic cavity functioned as one large mouth, with no sign of the internal organs that would normally reside within, with the exception of the alimentary canal, which was capable of expanding several dozen times its original size. The stomach also produced an acid much stronger than anything found in nature.\n\nThe tongue secreted a type of neurotoxin that acted through skin contact, leading to a brief euphoric state, then unconsciousness in the infected.\n\nThe pelvic bones also appeared to be capable of unhinging, most likely to allow excretion to happen easier, due to the possible large size of the subject's intended prey, and to the fact that no facilities for mastication were found within the subject's biology.\n\n**Note:** //Kenneth got off lightly there, but he still freaks out mildly every time he sees a woman with her arms outstretched. We'll keep the specimen for research. Although... this is not what I was originally hoping for, I think I may use the canal...//\n\n+++ Test-11\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, thirty (30) years of age, five (5) foot eleven (11) inches in height, and one hundred and fifty (150) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. Mild damage to lungs through excessive smoking.\n\n* One (1) pill of [[[SCP-500]]]\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\nHuman female with the exact same dimensions as the original subject. Subject appeared to be exactly the same as before. However, preliminary tests revealed that the subject's lymphatic system had been altered greatly.\n\nThe lymph nodes produced a liquid with a much higher cell count than lymph found in normal humans, and contained numerous types of cells not normally seen in nature, let alone humans. These cells appear to be a hybrid of the various defense cells around the body as well as stem cells, with a startlingly high metabolism and motility.\n\nThese cells replace other damaged cells very quickly, leading to highly advanced regeneration, with serious wounds possibly taking days or even hours. This system could possibly slow or even stop the aging process.\n\nHowever, as was stated before, these cells have a very high metabolism, leading to a much higher appetite in the subject. After damage, this could increase exponentially.\n\n**Notes:** //Wow. Well that one went very good. Very good indeed. Makes me almost want one of those for myself...//\n\n**12/12/2008**\n\n+++ Test-12\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, twenty-eight (28) years of age, six (6) foot, one (1) inch in height, and one hundred and fifty-five (155) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major health issues.\n\n* One (1) BASLER L304KC 4080 pixel Trilinear line scan camera.\n\n**Setting:** Fine\n\n**Output:**\n* A large block of \"waste\" material, composed primarily of human tissue, with trace amounts of metal, plastic, rubber and glass, weighing two hundred and three (203) pounds.\n\n* A small, silver ring, highly ornate, with a large group of miniature human-like eyes clumped together in an ornate clasp on one side of the band. Eyes capable of rotating within clasp to \"look\" around.\n\nWearing the ring allows the wearer to view everything around themselves, including behind themselves, behind objects around them, and inside objects, including themselves, for the range of their line of sight. However, it has the notable side effect of giving the wearer a severe pain behind the eyes, similar to an extreme case of eyestrain.\n\n**Notes:** //If it weren't for the pain, this thing could be quite useful. Also, it was interesting to note that the ring didn't actually increase eyesight. When Jim had his glasses off while wearing the thing, everything was still all blurry. Good to know.//\n\n+++ Test-13\n\n**Input:**\n* Caucasian female, twenty-one (21) years of age, five (5) foot three (3) inches in height, and one hundred and forty-four (144) pounds in weight. Subject is in relatively good health. No major health issues.\n\n* One (1) BASLER L304KC 4080 pixel Trilinear line scan camera.\n\n**Setting:** 1:1\n\n**Output:**\nAn organism that resembles a large tripod-mounted video camera, with electronic output leads and monitor at the rear. Object is alive, and made primarily of organic compounds, even the monitor, which appears to be made of tissue similar to ocular tissue, only saturated with highly advanced chromatophore pigmentation cells. The picture it displays is very clear and smooth, on par with many high-definition screens available on market now. The \"lens\" of the \"camera\" is a human eye, although shows hybridization with various mechanical elements.  \n\nDespite the fact that it possesses the needed skeletal and muscular structure for locomotion, it does not appear to be sentient in any way. Scans of the torso/main body have shown that there is no brain, with the exception of a highly developed brain stem at the base of the neck/tripod.\n\n**Note:** //You know, I think that's enough of these for the moment. But I can use that eye.//\n------\n**Memo to Prof. K. P. Crow:**\n\nAfter review of the current testing situation, the following observations may be helpful to your endeavors.\n\nAfter extended time spent in research on and with SCP-914, the following proposal regarding its nature may be made with a significant degree of certainty:  SCP-914 was not designed as an industrial device.  Nor was it primarily a scientific device.  Its primary function appears to be as a form of entertainment.  After review of the recovery notes, and evaluation of the test logs, it appears that SCP-914 was designed to create the most “novel” items possible, with no regard for practicality or function.\n\nJudging by this, it appears the best way to achieve a desired result is to try and exclude as many possible outcomes as possible.  When entering a small pile of parts for a clock on a 1:1 setting, you will most likely get a clock.  If you enter blocks of wood, glass, and metal, it leaves a wide degree of room for “interpretation” by SCP-914, with a clock only one of many possible outcomes.  If you desire to create a human being with, say, metallic skin, then the best plan would be to create a “suit” of the metal in the exact dimensions of the intended subject, and the same thickness as the subject’s skin.  At that point, a setting of 1:1 or Fine may achieve the desired result.\n\nHowever, there is a high degree of randomness still associated with SCP-914.  Patience must be maintained, as it is not being used for its intended purpose, and thus may frustrate attempts to achieve a desired result.  A short review of settings, as well:\n\n**Rough:** Destruction of the item, often by pressure, heat, or cutting.\n**Coarse:**  Disassembly of the item into component parts.\n**1:1:**  Direct integration of multiple items, or “re-interpretation” of singular items.\n**Fine:**  Refinement of items, often with a blending or “re-interpretation” of base states.\n**Very Fine:**  Total “re-interpretation”, often times using only the base compounds of items.\n\nI hope these notes are useful in your continued research.\n\nDr. Gears\n\n------\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
