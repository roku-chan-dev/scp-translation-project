Instances are to have their flight feathers annually clipped to ensure inability to fly. Apart from this, SCP-2351 instances require no containment procedures. For instructions regarding routine care, see Document-2351-D.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2351 is the collective designation of three specimens of adult, female //Branta canadensis//, commonly referred to as Canada goose. SCP-2351 specimens (designated SCP-2351-1, -2, and -3 in order of capture) display no behavioral abnormalities, and appear physically indistinguishable from non-anomalous Canada geese save for their effect on human observers.\n\nAny human being who visually perceives an instance of SCP-2351 will experience a compulsion to imitate the vocalizations of a Canada goose, maintaining such behavior for as long as they maintain visual contact. Pictures and visual recordings of SCP-2351 do not carry this effect. The mechanism behind SCP-2351’s anomalous nature has yet to be determined. \n\nSubjects, including those made aware of SCP-2351’s anomalous properties, will perceive their behavior as voluntary, claiming their actions were performed out of personal amusement. Affected subjects demonstrate an increase in morale following exposure to SCP-2351.\n\nSCP-2351-1 and SCP-2351-2 were captured in New York, NY between the dates of July 3 and July 8, 2015. SCP-2351-3 was captured in Albany, NY on July 12, 2015. A detailed timeline may be found in Document-2351-H: Capture and Containment of SCP-2351.\n\n**Addendum:** \n\nDuring the capture of SCP-2351-3, a message was found attached by a rubber band to its right leg:\n\n> Hepatitis B: 780,000 \n> Hepatitis A: 350,000 \n> Typhoid Fever: 200,000 \n> Measles: 145,000\n> [Crude drawing of what appears to be a large lizard]: 129 \n> [Outline of a humanoid figure with disproportionately large head]: 14 \n> [Detailed pencil drawing of three Canada geese]: 0\n> \n> //Are We Cool Yet?//\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2350]]] | SCP-2351 | [[[SCP-2352]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
