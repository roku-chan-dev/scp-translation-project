It wasn't great initially, and I'm a little surprised that it survived, but I made some fixes and now I'm decently proud of it. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5219 | SCP-5219]]] - A Completely Random Corpse \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nProbably my best JamCon entry. There's not much behind this one's creation except that I thought it would be interesting to do, but I think it turned out really nice, and people seem to agree. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5196 | SCP-5196]]] - Fluorescent Adolescent\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThe thematic parts of this article came from listening to the Arctic Monkeys song on repeat, hence the title, and the idea itself came almost immediately from seeing the theme. I'm really happy with how this one turned out too.\n\nAlso, the exact mechanics behind why the ritual goes wrong don't matter, so don't get hung up on it.  \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-final-death-of-jack-bright | The Final Death of Jack Bright]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI regret nothing.   \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-gears-heated-gaming-moment | Dr. Gears' Heated Gaming Moment]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI still regret nothing.   \n[[/collapsible]]\n\nI leave my articles and drafts to [[*user stoner99]].\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
