(click to enlarge)]]\n----\n\n> I was super excited when I was given the task to create a gift for this years Art Exchange, especially when I was told I would be making it for [[*user Monkeysky]]. When I looked through their author page, I decided I would illustrate [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1163 SCP-1163] as it didn't have much fanart and it was an article I had a lot of memories seeing when I was younger on the site.\n\n> I am very happy with how the drawing turned out. I wanted to portray the character's confusion with the world around them, his ability causing havoc that he cannot fully understand because he's simply way too young, and the Foundation giving him chocolate bars (that's what the arrows signify, note that they're set similarly to how the Foundation logo sets their arrows) which was always a funny yet really sad detail to me.\n\n> My plan for the gift originally was that I was going to do two drawings, one of them of SCP-1163 and the other of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/artist-formerly-known-as-chuck The Artist Formerly Known as Chuck]. Sadly, my life was putting a lot of weight on my creativity and I ended up being too low on energy to do the second one. So instead, I decided that when Monkeysky found out it was me who made this, I would tell them that I would also like to illustrate the tale and ask if they'd want to see that. So if you're reading this Monkeysky, please let me know because I really loved that story and would love to illustrate it sometime.\n\n> With all that being said, I just want to say to Monkeysky that you are a super awesome person to talk to and your art and writing is incredible. I recommend anyone reading this to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/monkeysky-s-author-page check their work out]. If you like anything I've created I think you'd enjoy their work as well.
