Thaumiel/Apollyon.[[/footnote]]. SCP-8846 is one of few known exceptions to this.\n\nShould SCP-8846 become used, it will corrupt any files classified under it due to emergent behavior from the 'Pending/Concentra' classification. As 'Pending' refers to anomalies which have not yet been classified, and 'Concentra' refers to anomalies affecting recursive phenomenon, the ACS assumes that the item cannot be classified until recursive behavior occurs[[footnote]] Per the definition of 'Pending'. [[/footnote]], and that recursive behavior will not occur until the item is classified[[footnote]] Per the definition of 'Concentra' as a subclass. [[/footnote]]. This definition is in itself recursive, and the ACS cannot compensate for it, invariably resulting in file corruption.\n\n> = Addendum: NARCISSUS Protocol\n> -----\nThe NARCISSUS protocol is comprised of two steps: Identification, and Activation.\n\nIdentification involves finding a suitable center for the protocol. Suitable centers must possess the following characteristics:\n# Having been diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder by a medical professional. This diagnosis must have been sustained over no less than 30 months.\n# Having no more than 3 close friends.\n# Having no extant family.\n# Having no large public footprint, nor any successful internet endeavors[[footnote]] IE. An account on a social media platform with a large number of 'followers'. [[/footnote]].\nThis individual must then be designated 'POI-8846'.\n\nActivation involves the interaction of POI-8846 and an anomaly classified under SCP-8846.  Following or during Identification, POI-8846 will have become the essophysical[[footnote]] The study of tangible concepts. [[/footnote]] embodiment of being 'self-centered'. Both geometrically and ontologically, POI-8846's center will be themself. From this point on, any interaction with POI-8846's center will inherently be recursive[[footnote]] As is any interaction in which an element contains itself as a nested sub element. [[/footnote]].\n\nPOI-8846's center is to interact with the anomaly classified under SCP-8846. Due to the recursive nature of this interaction, the anomaly will technically become related to recursive phenomenon and be classified as 'Concentra'. SCP-8846 will no longer be used.\n\nShould POI-8846 survive the interaction, they are to be amnesticized and returned to their prior life. The POI-8846 designation is to be rendered null.\n-----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8845]]] | SCP-8846 | [[[SCP-8847]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
