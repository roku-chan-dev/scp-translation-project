Many do not.\n\nThis page organizes and celebrates the large amount of valuable work that survives this day.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ Adding to this page:\nAs this page was created a decade after the first recorded April Fools Day jokes on the wiki, some pages may be missing. This page was originally created by LORDXVNV for navigational purposes and historical preservation, who used a methodology of manually reading through pages created within 36 hours of a given April 1st, using context clues such as author post, content, or first-revision comment to determine if they were created for April Fools.\n\nIf you are the author of a missing page, you may add them, unless they were written for a contest that has its own hub, which as of April 2022 are the Crack Fiction and Creck Fiction 2 contests. This is to reduce clutter. Please wait until April 3 before linking your pranks to make sure they've survived.\n\nDo not add other peoples' pages unless they state it was written for April Fools. Conversely, if you were the author of a page on this list and it was not intended for April Fools, please feel free to remove it.\n[[/div]]\n\n+ 2025\n\n++ Tales and Other:\n[[[fandation|Fandation]]]\n[[[totally-legit-scp-anthology-2025|The Totally Legit SCP Anthology 2025!]]]\n\n+ 2024\n\n++ Staff-Run\nFor 2024, the wiki was taken over by Spicy Crust Pizza.\n[[[April Fools 2024]]]\n[[[Pizzacon]]]\n\n++ SCPs:\n[[[rounderhouse-golder-proposal|ROUNDERHOUSE's Golder Proposal: Director's Cut]]]\n[[[SCP-8988-J]]]  -- Twitch Writes an SCP\n\n++ Tales and Other:\n[[[khaziaprilfools|The slim and accursed Junior Researcher Nial makes sweet Passionate Love to the toilet king Khazi]]]\n[/scp-8000/offset/1 SE(AL)QUELS]\n[[[baroque-unreality|BAROQUE]]]\n[[[theme:wikifot|Wikifot Theme]]]\n[[[ponyposting|Pony Posting is Now Banned at Site-19]]]\n[[[art:fanart-of-that-time-you-went-to-spicy-crust-pizza|Fanart of that time you went to Spicy Crust Pizza]]]\n[[[Spicy Crust Platoon]]]\n\n\n------\n\n+ 2023:\n\n++ Staff-Run\nFor 2023, the wiki was taken over by [[[OpusConfidant]]], an affectionate parody of the competitive Pokemon battling community Smogon.\n[[[OpusConfidant April 1st 2023 Spotlight]]]\n[[[OpusConfidant Orientation]]]\n[[[resistile-decomm-attempt |Resistile Decommissioning Attempt - Thread]]]\n[[[threatini |OpusConfidant Wiki - SCP-4645 - Threatini]]]\n\n++ SCPs\n[[[bone-proposal |ROUNDERHOUSE's Bone Proposal]]]\n[[[SCP-7472]]] -- Panopticon V: This Time It's Personal\n[[[SCP-VS-J]]] -- Can SCP-Vs-J beatâ€¦\n\n++ Tales and Other\n[[[Rate My Director]]]\n[[[Crom for Pleasure Devices]]]\n[[[The Flesh That Raves]]]\n[[[Aprillipaiva]]]\n[[[37-clowns|Funny Clown Show, Episode 37]]]\n\n\n------\n\n+ 2022:\n\n++ Staff-Run\nFor 2022, the SCP Wiki was taken over by the Fishing Team.\n[[[Fishing Team Main]]]\n[[[How to fish|How To Fish: An Official Guide]]]\n[[[news-04-2022 |News for April, 2022]]]\n[[[theme:fish |Fish Theme]]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14588588/april-1-2022-recap Recap, April 1st, 2022]\n\n++ SCPs:\n[[[SCP-6247]]] -- I, Fish Council\n[[[SCP-6749]]] -- Historical Refishionism\n[[[SCP-MORE-GUN-J]]] -- Guns Pointed At The Balls Of God\n[[[SCP-6269-J]]] -- The Multiversal Fishing Machine\n[[[SCP-6969-J]]] -- The End of Sex 6.9: You Can (Not) Reproduce\n[[[plauge proposal |Plauge's Proposal]]] -- The Great Seal\n[[[scp-005-hub |SCP-005 Proposal Hub]]]\n[[[SCP-173, but every sentence is a crosslink]]]\n\n++ Tales and Other: \n[[[The Bathrooms Wiki]]]\n[[[A Wandsman in a Vegas Cathouse]]]\n[[[tfw scp|TFW SCP :(]]]\n[[[Balls to the Wall]]]\n[[[what |WHAT THE FU-]]]\n[[[The Final Deletion]]]\n[[[I Director Schwarz |I, Director Schwarz of the Shark Punching Center]]]\n[[[I, a polar bear covering my nose in a snowstorm]]]\n[[[I, Am Late]]]\n[[[I, Want You All To Stop]]]\n\n++ Artwork\n[[[Wilson's Wildlife Adoption Gallery]]]\n[[[art:el-sexooo |El SEXOOO]]]\n\n------\n\n+ 2021:\n++ Staff-Run\nFor [[[April Fools' 2021]]], Researcher James, age six, took over the Wiki. \n[[[theme:crayon |Crayon Theme]]]\n\nAlso there was a crack fiction contest.
