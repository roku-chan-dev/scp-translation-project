Bi-weekly filtration of the containment chamber’s water is to be accomplished with chlorine tablets[[footnote]]A condensed, solid form of chlorine, usually used to clean bodies of water that are not intended for consumption.[[/footnote]] being inserted into the chamber until SCP-5229 is visibly clean.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5229 is an anomalous human skeleton, with the notable structural difference of SCP-5229’s foot bones, hand bones, facial bones, and cranial bones being fused together into solid plates. Due to the particular structure created by the fusion, SCP-5229’s extremities resemble fins, and SCP-5229’s skull resembles an open-circuit diving helmet[[footnote]]A lightweight diving helmet, designed and used for all-purpose dives.[[/footnote]]. The faceplate of the skull is composed of keratin, giving SCP-5229’s “visor” the approximate appearance of a fingernail.\n\nDespite being heavily abnormal in structure and appearance, SCP-5229’s anomalous qualities will only manifest in the event that any portion of SCP-5229 is not in direct contact with liquid. When SCP-5229 becomes active, it will proceed to animate, move towards the nearest source of water, and submerge itself, becoming inactive.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5229 was recovered from Pyramid Lake, Nevada after witnesses described a “living skeleton” to local news outlets. The following log details the initial shipment of SCP-5229 to Area-14 for investigation:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-5229 Retrieval Log\" hide=\"- [CLOSE FILE]\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ FOUNDATION RELOCATION SECURITY REPORT\n\n**Time of Retrieval:** 1:00 PM, PST\n\n**Current Time:** 1:07 PM, PST\n\n**Travel Details:** //Provided by Security Officer J.

We got a flat, and that must have knocked off the cooler cap, and before we knew it, the thing launched out and went inside Sommer. It tunneled right into his stomach. Sommer’s dead for sure, there’s blood everywhere, and I can’t see 5229. It must still be in there, for all I know.

It must be going after the nearest water source, and leaving when it’s tired.

I wouldn’t call it stable, and I think it’s a stretch to call us safe, but Micah isn’t crying anymore, and that at least means something’s better. I think Micah was brave enough to cry before it could have happened. Sommer didn’t even flinch, Jean looked pissed, and I screamed because I couldn’t stand the thought of dying with tears.
