The primary vector of containment is a 1,398 meter borehole drilled directly into the Earth, at the bottom of which is a square 5m cell containing SCP-5549. Motion sensors are set to alert Site-05 if any abnormal activity is detected from the cell.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5549, formerly D-293 & Doctor Jacques Boucher, is a hostile sapient entity with Class V ontokinetic abilities. Additionally, SCP-5549 is highly resistant to all forms of damage tested against it. The extent of SCP-5549's abilities is currently unknown.\n\nSCP-5549 was created by the Foundation Department of Inter-Anomaly Experimentation as part of Project LONDON BRIDGE.\n----\n[[=]]\n++ ADDENDUM 5549.1\n+++ {{Project Proposal LONDON BRIDGE Committee Hearing, November 30th, 1975}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n----\n**SHARP:** Good evening, Liaison Je-\n\n**O5-11:** I'm not Doc Jefferson, son.\n\n**SHARP:** Pardon?
