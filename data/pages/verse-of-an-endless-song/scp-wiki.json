Sing, my friends! Burn brightly in the night,\n\nand sing ‘till the song’s ending and the dancing’s done.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab What is this?]]\n\nOver the last several years, I have slowly developed a patchwork canon within my body of work, offhandedly named the Djoricverse. This hub is an attempt to collect all of my related pieces into a single whole – revising out inconsistencies, expanding upon threads and characters, filling in blank spaces of the timeline, and overhauling plot arcs as needed. None \n\nThe hub is a bit bare-bones now, and far from its finished state (I cannot guarantee anything), but I wanted to get it up to at least show some sense of direction.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Character List]] \n\n(Under Construction)\n\n**The Eldest, the All-Death**\n\n**The Middle Brother, the Great Death**\n\n**The Youngest Brother, the Small Death**\n\n**The Scarlet King**\n\n**A’habbat**\n\n**Nahash, the Serpent**\n\n**Hakhama, the Broken Goddess**\n\n**Adam**\n\n**Hawwah**\n\n**Qayin**\n\n**Hevel**\n\n**Set**\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Glossary]] \n\n(Under Construction)\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Commentary]]\n\n(Under construction)\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Legendarium\n//The building blocks on which the world sits.//\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/chapter-1-verse-1 Chapter 1: Verse 1]\n[[[Dust and Blood]]]\n[[[Beneath Two Trees]]]\n\n+ Jeremiah and Deer’s Excellent Adventure\n//One’s a time-travelling wizard.
