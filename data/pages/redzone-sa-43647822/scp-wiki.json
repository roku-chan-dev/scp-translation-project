The presence of this exploit is a strong indicator that your system is compromised, and can be detected from these symptoms:\n\n* Appearance of unwanted banner ads attached to items retrieved from compromised equipment.\n* Appearance of animated advertisements on paper archive media.\n* Appearance of targeted advertisements referencing confidential personnel history.\n* Networked printers printing coupons containing anomalous memetic elements.\n\n++ Workarounds\nThe following measures may be taken to reduce the potential for adverse consequences resulting from this vulnerability:\n* Ensure the network is equipped with an up-to-date active infohazard detection system.\n* Install Adblock software on any computer used to interact with affected systems.\n* Install memetic filter firewalls on all networked printers.\n* Train users of affected systems to recognise and report computer security issues.\n\n++ Fixed Software\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Redzone Security Advisories and Responses archive and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \n\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Redzone Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\n++ Exploitation and Public Announcements\nThe Redzone Security Incident Team (RSIT) is aware that this vulnerability has been exploited in the Adament [sic] adware virus. RSIT is not aware of any prior public disclosure of this vulnerability.\n\n++ Source\n**2015-07-07:** Gloria McDuffie and Walter Sotomayor of SCP Foundation MTF Rho-9 reported this vulnerability to Redzone.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** redzone3.png\n> **Author:** [[*user AJMansfield]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
