It displays numerous psychological ailments, including aversion to men, fear of sleeping, PTSD, and suicidality.\n \nMedical analysis has discovered significant scarring on the palms, feet, and genital area. Additionally, SCP-4166-1 develops cachexia if not administered 1 cc of human semen weekly.\n\nEvery seven days, or in times of increased distress, SCP-4166-1 manifests an instance of SCP-4166-2 (if one does not currently exist).\n \nSCP-4166-2 is a mute shadow-like humanoid figure with no defining visual features which otherwise exhibits typical human characteristics. Upon manifestation, SCP-4166-2 enters the room containing SCP-4166-1 through the primary method of entry, regardless of barriers. It then attempts to approach SCP-4166-1.\n\nIf SCP-4166-1 retains the memory of containment of SCP-4166-2, SCP-4166-2 proceeds to take action to counteract previous methods of containment, up to and including manifesting with weaponry. \n\nUpon termination, SCP-4166-2 instances demanifest instantaneously.\n\nSCP-4166-3 is a three-phase mental illness affecting individuals who have observed an instance of SCP-4166-2, lasting for the duration of SCP-4166-2's manifestation.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Description of SCP-4166-3 stages\" hide=\"- Description of SCP-4166-3 stages\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=16633.jpg | caption=Depiction of symptoms of SCP-4166-3 stage three, recovered from SCP-4166-1's notebook.

Accompanying those present during prior stages, symptoms include:\n\n* Tactile hallucinations of hands grasping one's person, displaying no notable pattern.\n\n* Visual hallucinations of SCP-4166-2 in empty doorways.\n\n* Burning sensations throughout one's whole body.\n\n* Conviction and fear of eternal suffering after death.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 4166-A: Circumstances of Retrieval\" hide=\"- Addendum 4166-A: Circumstances of Retrieval\"]]\nSCP-4166-1 was raised in a Catholic orphanage twelve years prior to the hospitalization of Father █████ in an apparent case of spontaneous combustion. Six days afterwards, the first manifestation of SCP-4166-2 occurred on 07-24-2008. During this manifestation, a gunshot attracted the attention of the nuns. Upon entering the room, they found SCP-4166-1 alone, holding a pistol at the entrance to its room. Authorities were notified of the incident, leading to the retrieval of SCP-4166\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 4166-C: Log of Therapy Session 166-A\" hide=\"- Addendum 4166-C: Log of Therapy Session 166-A\"]]\n\n> **Interviewer:** Junior Psychologist ██████ ███\n> \n> **Foreword:** Intake session done shortly after acquisition, on 07-26-2008.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 13:21>**\n> \n> **███:** Good afternoon, SCP-4166-1.\n> \n> **SCP-4166-1:** Uh.

I hated being there. I hated being there and feeling like I was sin. Like I was sin incarnate. They treated me like that, you know? I was five. They didn't know how to deal with me when I started being \"symptomatic\". //[SCP-4166-1 grimaces.]// They called it weakness of the flesh. When I'd cry, or say things I wasn't supposed to, or do, uh, things inappropriate for my age. I was hit. I was shunned.

And every Sunday, they made me sit in the pews and listen about how the demonic, the satanic was to be rejected, to be shunned, to be hated. So I started talking to the only one I felt I could. I started talking to the devil.\n> \n> //[SCP-4166-1 begins to tear up.]//\n> \n> **SCP-4166-1:** And eventually, after years and fucking years of being hit and being dirtied, I made a deal, you know? I made a deal to make it fucking stop. I made a deal to make him pay. To make him burn like I did, to //feel// like how he made me. But that was for a price, of course. I made the deal in exchange for having to seduce and sleep with a dude once a week. But I was, pardon my French, a fucking slut back then. Fucking //horrible//. Christ. Christ. So, so I didn't care. It was a fucking //upside// to me. God. God. Christ.
