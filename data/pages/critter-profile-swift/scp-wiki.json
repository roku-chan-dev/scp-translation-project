She's cute, adorable and always a great friend to all of us! Even if you're meeting her for the first time, she's always happy and welcoming to people, even if she is a bit shy at times.\n\nYou see Swift's quirk is that she can turn invisible! When she's stressed, in pain or just nervous, she becomes see-through. She's still there in reality, but we just can't see her! It's just like that one superhero, the Marvel one.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nSwift's been here at Wilson's for a hot minute now. We got her from the Supervisors a while back, they said they found her during a raid on another organization. Poor Swift was being abused by her sick previous owners. From the file we got on the situation, which didn't contain that much info, apparently Swift was being used to steal stuff from the Supervisors and stores.\n\nWhen she first arrived, it took her a while before she started to warm back up to humans, which was totally understandable. How would you act around the same species that abused you? She wouldn't eat, drink or even come out of her burrow. After a few weeks, she started to interact with us. She'd let us pet her, and she started eating a lot more, although sometimes she would still turn invisible when we tried to talk to her.\n\nAfter a couple of months of this, we decided to allow her to play with other ferrets! She was a bit shy, but quickly began playing with them, chasing each other through tunnels and tackling each other.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nSwift is currently housed in Enclosure 72, with a group of other regular ferrets. You can tell which one is her from the red band on her front right arm. She also should be taken on short walks daily. (only if she wants to!)\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Swift!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nIf Swift is invisible for no apparent reason, she's most likely stressed. She could be sick, hurt or even just sad.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: JacoB Bandit\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey Fae, you asked for an update on Swift's health and behavior, so here it is.\n\nShe's been acting a bit more shy than usual, but she's still interacting and playing with the other ferrets, especially Noodle, one of the males.\n\nShe's been eating and drinking a ton though, almost abnormally.
