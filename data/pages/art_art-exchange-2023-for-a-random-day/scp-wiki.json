Enjoy this drawing of MTF Tau-5 \"Samsara\" and their adorable dog, Gnasher. The power of a cute pet can go so far, can it not? It can even melt the heart of Onru, who started out hating Gnasher but ended up warming up to him, even to the point where she was describing him as \"her dog\". So sweet!\n\nThis is the main piece. In the other tabs, you will find little bonus doodles. Small drawings illustrating select scenes from [[[the-powers-that-bark|]]]. I hope you will enjoy!\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Irantu]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIrantu sat on the floor of the sparring room, holding Gnasher by the midsection. The dog was remarkably unruffled by this. Their eyes were locked onto each other’s with equal intensity.\n\n“Greetings, Gnasher,” Irantu said. “My designation is Irantu. I am your squad leader.”\n\nGnasher barked.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image AE_Irantu_small.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Munru]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n“Very well,” Munru said. “I apologize. I should have let you finish the turkey. Please find my Capri Sun, and I will get you another turkey.”\n\nGnasher barked twice.\n\n“Irantu was right. You are an… excellent negotiator.”\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image AE_Munru_small.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Nanku]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n“You are a very smart dog. Would you mind taking a look at my current draft? It is the first chapter of my //Pacific Vortex!// rewrite from Summer’s… perspective.”\n\nShe proffered the notebook to Gnasher. He nosed the first page carefully, wetting it. Then he bit it out and shredded it.\n\n“That bad?”\n\nGnasher barked.\n\n“I think you’re right. I was planning to rewrite the chapter anyways. Here, let me help,” Nanku said. She ripped twenty more pages out and fed half of them to Gnasher. The other half went into her own mouth.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image AE_Nanku_small.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Onru]]\nThis doodle doesn't correspond to any of the story beats. It's just a nice doodle of Onru playing with Gnasher, sometimes after the conclusion of The Powers That Bark. Maybe even immediately afterwards! \n\n[[=image AE_Onru_small.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** All images\n> **Author:** [[*user Miss Lapis]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n> **Filename:** tau_5_gnasher.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Miss Lapis]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0.\n> \n> Image is a composite that incorporates the following image\n> \n> **Name:** MTF Tau-5 - Samsara\n> **Author:** [[*user SunnyClockwork]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sunny-art-tales wikidot]\n\n> **The page contains excerpts from:** \"The Powers That Bark\" by A Random Day and TyGently, from the SCP Wiki.
