The anomalous effect lies in the additional underground passage that does not exist in the as-built drawing of the facility. When a human subject enters the resting platform of the staircase on Basement 1, there will be hallucinations of --a parallel world-- a world located in the upper narrative. These hallucinations have intense cognitohazardous effects and will cause the subject to become an SCP-CN-001-Α instance.\n\nSCP-CN-001-Α will develop a strong urge to continue exploring SCP-CN-001 downward until the instance is no longer detectable by any means of communication. However, the image of SCP-CN-001 obtained by remote instruments such as drones is not anomalous and shows that Basement 1 has no stairs leading to greater depths.\n\nAccording to an interview with SCP-CN-001-Ω, the creator of SCP-CN-001, the destination of SCP-CN-001-A is the world of the upper narrative. Compared to the narrative in which the Foundation is located, the world of the upper narrative has zero probability of anomalies, and the cognitohazardous effects caused by SCP-CN-001 are explained by SCP-CN-001-Ω as \"they just keep going since a world without anomalies is attractive.\n\nThe anomalous effect of SCP-CN-001 was first discovered in July 2012. The Foundation discovered SCP-CN-001 when AanaMalsageco, an employee at Area-CN-07-Ω, was affected by the anomaly and disappeared from the facility. However, progress on containment was hampered by the obstruction of SCP-CN-001-Ω, during which time approximately 200 Foundation employees were affected by the anomaly. After the successful capture of SCP-CN-001-Ω, SCP-CN-001 was fully contained by the Foundation.\n\n**Updated 08/15/20██:** Currently, the anomalous effect of SCP-CN-001 has extended to stairwells leading to basements in all Foundation facilities and some non-Foundation buildings. As of the date of this update, the number of people missing as a result of SCP-CN-001 has reached ███,███, 36% of whom are Foundation members.\n\nNow that SCP-CN-001 has the ability to create an XK class scenario, the object class of SCP-CN-001 has been revised to Apollyon. The Foundation's focus will shift to containment and control of SCP-CN-001.\n\n**Updated 08/20/20██:** SCP-CN-001 is now the baseline reality.\n\nThe pataphysical [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lily-s-proposal|Day of Flowers]]] has arrived.\n\n**Addendum 001-N2:**\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"File: [SCP-CN-001 Exploration Log.mp4]\" hide=\"Opening…\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**SCP-CN-001 Exploration Video Log**\n\n**Date:** 08/07/20██\n\n**Summary:** To study the nature of SCP-CN-001, Dr. Desiree dispatched a D-class (D-576448) with video equipment to explore it.\n\n-----\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n**D-576448:** Log Begins. The staircase is dark. Aren't there any lights or something?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** If you can't feel it, then there isn't one.\n\n//D-576448 steps onto the resting platform in Basement 1.//\n\n**D-576448:** I see it ... What ... is that?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, please describe the sight you see.\n\n**D-576448:** I wouldn't have been demoted to D-class? No, this is a world without anomalies?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, I repeat, please describe the sight you see.\n\n**D-576448:** No.\n\n//D-576448 starts running. Tracking shows that the subject is already deep in Basement 9.//\n\n**D-576448:** You won't understand, even if I tell you. At the end of the stairs is freedom, the tomorrow our Foundation is looking forward to.\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448! I order you to stop exploring! If you continue to disobey, I'm going to remotely sedate you now.\n\n**D-576448:** What I see is a world where we will lose our value, a world where we will eventually arrive. Of course, who wouldn't run for it if they could be normal people instead of being D-class?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** D-576448, I'm going to sedate you. I hope you'll calm down.\n\n//D-576448 is remotely sedated. However, D-576448's vital signs do not stabilize.//\n\n**D-576448:** Drugs do nothing. The thirst for the end of the stairs transcends physiology and interests. This place, like Avalon to which Arthur returned after his death, is God's declared kingdom of heaven. Sensual existence is deconstructed by reason. You can't and won't command me anymore. I will return to freedom.\n\n//The camera shows a door, which D-576448 opens and then disappears through. The tracker is then left in Basement 1, and the camera shows that there are no doors or windows on the platform it is on.//\n\n[End Log]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/<]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"File: [SCP-CN-001-Ω Interview Log 01.avi]\" hide=\"It's an incredible thing that comes from smooth, ordinary days\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewee:** SCP-CN-001-Ω\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Desiree\n\n**Date:** 08/10/20██\n\n------\n\n**[Begin Log]**\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Any cigarettes?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** You think you can ask me for cigarettes after the damage you've done to the Foundation?\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Fine.\n\n//SCP-CN-001-Ω leans back.//\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Actually, I like the Foundation's food too.\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** Stop your bullshit. Tell me, did you create the anomaly?\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** I'm already here. Do I have room for denial?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** So you admit it. Next question, why do you want to sabotage the Foundation?\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Sabotage? Is there ever a need to sabotage it? The foundation itself isn't solid, not even in the sense of being jerry-built and fragile. It's the fact that they haven't even thought about it that much.\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** I know that you worked in the Pataphysics Department before your arrest. What you are referring to, or who you are trying to blame in a roundabout way, are those writers. But it has nothing to do with what you did, which was a violation of the Foundation's regulations...\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Okay, okay, I don't want to shift blame.\n\n//SCP-CN-001-Ω interrrupts Dr. Desiree//\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** But what I'm doing is not sinful at all. The Foundation exists as a program that has been running for ten years, with mountains of code piling up on top of a basic rudimentary architecture, and then a bug can scare the programmers to death. And you people will turn a blind eye and a deaf ear because the Foundation is idealistic anyway.\n\n**Dr.Desiree:** The Foundation cannot be idealistic.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Yes, it is. The Foundation contains anomalies, but you never think about what exactly makes an anomaly. You have a whole theory of containment, but even your definition of \"anomaly\" is based on a vague concept that is too simple for a pupil. Come on, tell me, if anomalies are abnormal, then what is normal?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** The life experienced by the masses is naturally normal.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** So I ask again, how many anomalous objects have we seen? How many anomalous events have we witnessed? Everything from molecules to galaxies are filled with anomalies, so where does normal life come from? What is its standard in this environment?\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** I mean, the Foundation's...\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The masses also experience anomalies, or there wouldn't be so many anomalous groups creating objects waiting to be contained. My experience in the Pataphysics Department has taught me that our anomalies are made to be contrasted with the ordinary experiences of the authors.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** It's a void, something so taken for granted that even you and I are fooled by its sense of universality. Going back to the earlier analogy...the Foundation is now filled with a bunch of nasty bugs, and on top of that, the mountain of code keeps getting higher and higher. All I'm doing is simply migrating important data away.\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** Simply?! Don't you realize the damage you've done to the Foundation? You do what you think is right, but how can anyone prove it's right? How can you prove that the people who disappeared went where you told them to go and weren't driven to suicide by you?\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The losses are just lines of characters compared to what's behind that door. I don't know what you think, but the Foundation is just a dream, a dream of Brahma. I'll let everyone continue to exist before Brahma wakes up. It's a gamble.\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** Stubbornness. The Foundation can't afford to gamble. In the early days, when it was newly founded, we could still gamble, but now the Foundation is a large international organization, with countries, government dignitaries, and researchers from all over the world waiting for us to protect the fate of mankind from the fangs of anomalies. We can't afford to gamble, you know.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** I know, Ms. Desiree. But if--\n\n**Dr. Desiree:** The interview is over.\n\n**[End Log]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/<]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"File: [Dr. Desiree's Notebook Scan.png]\" hide=\"Countless inspirations created the closed cage\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n08/10\nI recently read a novel called //The Redemption of the Woman Undertaker//, which was recommended to me by a colleague. It's very enjoyable as a suspense novel, but the ideas in it can't help but remind me of something that happened at work ...\nNo, it's nothing, it's probably just me making unfounded associations.\nI'd like to forget the offender's argument, but the questions she threw at me made me think about what the Foundation is really fighting for.\nHave I also become a corporate slave?

Since you are going off topic within multiple interviews, I will be the one to conduct the interview this time.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** No, you can't. Any ciga...  Forget it, you robot won't give it to me.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** The point is, if you want to understand my explanation, you have to talk about the Day of Flowers. I've worked in the Foundation, and I know your process inside and out. All you have to do is ask \"what, why, how\" and get words from the people you talk to the way you dig out boogers and earwax so you can better fucking guess how this anomaly might be contained. How can that possibly fool me?\n\n**Dr. Sophia:** ... The Day of Flowers refers to the Foundation's final containment protocol in the event of an unresolvable K-class scenario. I'm well aware of that, and I'm not a robot, thank you.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** No, the Day of Flowers is a metonymy that is itself abstract and could refer to any K-class scenario. But for the Pataphysics Department, the pataphysical Day of Flowers is an opportunity to leave this world. The rest of the department and some of the Foundation's top executives have already left, leaving you people who don't understand what we're researching.\n\n**SCP-CN-001-Ω:** Don't you want to know what SCP-CN-001 really is? SCP-CN-001 is just a code name, and there are countless possibilities lurking behind this code name. \"So much has been written to hide the real 001\" or similar reasons explaining the myriad possibilities of 001 - you can easily accept them no matter how outrageous they are. What is this? It is that which has no value or meaning to be explored in the world, and about which silence must be maintained.\n\n**Dr. Sophia:*",
