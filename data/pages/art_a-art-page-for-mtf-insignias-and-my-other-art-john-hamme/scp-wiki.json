You found my art page. All I'm doing here is Posting MTF insignias. I make Insignias for fun, not for a job or anything. Feel free to use them if you want. Just make sure you say I made it. \n\nIf you want to contact me, I'm usually open on discord, my username is thedoctor7902. If you have questions or want help with anything, just DM me.\n\n//**PLEASE NOTE, IM NEW TO THIS STUFF SO DONT SHOOT ME FOR SCREWING UP**//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Stuff that can be found\" hide=\"You Found Some Stuff\"]]\nThis serves for explaining each tab.\n\n**Mainline**: I put Insignias that either are used for a main/Additional MTF, //OR// Used to be.\n\n**New**: This is where I post Insignias for MTF that don't have one. also, here if I made it for an additional MTF that need an Insignia.\n\n**Redone**: If I rework someone's thing or if I make a new OG insignia for a MTF that has one, it goes here.\n\n**Non-MTF**: I put insignias here that don't have a MTF to them. They are Free use. just mention my name with it.\n\n**//CREDIT TO TEAM//**\n\n[[*user coyo_coya]], For letting me post Ouro-1 on here.\n[[*user Woedenaz]], For the Theme. \n[[*user Jerden]], For helping me understanding how the MTF insignia system works.\nPeople who suggested stuff, Thanks.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Mainline]]\n\n**Mainline**\n\n------\n\nKappa-14: \"AH!

It is still up there.\n[[=image https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/3f292286-35d5-4552-9c9a-969230f6b66a/dg27v5l-0f2e9ec2-d791-49e7-bd41-e5043cce4d2d.png/v1/fill/w_894,h_894/kappa_14_by_somescphosting_dg27v5l-pre.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTAwMCIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzNmMjkyMjg2LTM1ZDUtNDU1Mi05YzlhLTk2OTIzMGY2YjY2YVwvZGcyN3Y1bC0wZjJlOWVjMi1kNzkxLTQ5ZTctYmQ0MS1lNTA0M2NjZTRkMmQucG5nIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.gHDHUD6lnDyFcbxamUG3WHLXk30En6p8sYR8-4eEgIc]]\n\n------\n\nSigma-5: //; DROP TABLE taskforces â€”//\n\nThis was a old thing I made. Well not this. I had a older more doll one. I sharpened it and have been waiting to get it on the wiki main. And it happened.\n\n[[image Sigma-5.png]]\n\n------\n\nUpsilon-23: \"Art Critics\"\n\nCicada suggested it a while back, now back then I didn't have an idea or plan for Upsilon-23. After it came to the MTF list, I had an idea for it. Now I don't remember the SCP exactly, but I based the insignia off of it.\n[[=image https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/3f292286-35d5-4552-9c9a-969230f6b66a/dg27vc3-fad80090-365f-4d6b-8751-349778a78cc8.png/v1/fill/w_894,h_894/upsilon_23__by_somescphosting_dg27vc3-pre.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTAwMCIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzNmMjkyMjg2LTM1ZDUtNDU1Mi05YzlhLTk2OTIzMGY2YjY2YVwvZGcyN3ZjMy1mYWQ4MDA5MC0zNjVmLTRkNmItODc1MS0zNDk3NzhhNzhjYzgucG5nIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.Z4IUADPUCCoZ2gvL1GnsDMGf5CyFjbSmlCtf_CLQOmc]]\n\n------\n\n**Old Mainline**\n\n------\n\nDelta-4: \"Minutemen\n\nI was looking for Stuff to make and I came across Delta-4, I was trying out the text feature on IBISPAINT.EXE sadly it was replaced. :/\n\n[[image Delta-4.png]]\n\n------\n\nTheta-5: \"The Bigger Boat\"\n\nUsed to be Theta-5's insignia and the first one I made.\nIt was later removed from Theta-5, but it shall rest as my first Insignia.\n[[image Theta-5.png]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab New]]\n\nBeta-8: \"Beta Eight Than Never\"\n\nSo I was gonna start this a while ago but I didn't have the motivation. But I finished finally.\n\n[[image Beta8.png]]\n\n------\n\nGamma-1: \"Search and Destroy\"\n\nCan't say much... I just made it...\n[[image Gamma-1.png]]\n\n------\n\nDelta-45: \"Rolling Thunder\"\n\nHEY, I updated this one. See redone for why.\n[[image Delta-45_new.png]]\n\n------\n\nNu-9: \"Null Chasers\"\n\nI was scrolling through the hundreds to thousands of MTF. I found Nu-9. And so I made there insignia a pattern, almost...\n\n[[image Nu-9.png]]\n\n------\n\nTau-4: \"Water, Water, Everywhere\"\n\nWas scrolling again through the comprehensive list of MTF and found Tau-4. And so this was born.\n[[image Tau-4.png]]\n\n------\n\nPsi-6: \"Psly Dogs\"\n\nSo same as Delta-45, it has been updated. And I love the new look I gave it. Now it doesn't look like a fox some what\n[[image new_Psi-6.png]]\n\n------\n\nOmega-31: \"Sticky Fingers\"\n\nFirst, I tried a box that was held by tentacles but that didn't really work. so, I made this through suggestions.\n[[image Omega-31.png]]\n\n------\n\nTitan-1: \"Off The Books\"\n\nYou get the mojo. This was mostly suggested to change by [[*user Jerden]]. He has yet to say it will work \n[[image new_Titan-1.png]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Redone]]\n\nOuro-1: \"Eye-Gear\"\n\nMade by Coyo_coya, he posted in MAST his insignia for a W.I.P MTF he was making. I sharpened his insignia for him. Top is the original version; bottom is my version.\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:a-art-page-for-mtf-insignias-and-my-other-art-john-hamme/Old_Ouro-1.png]]\n\n------\n\n[[image Ouro-1.png]]\n\n------\n\nDelta-45: \"Rolling Thunder\"\n\nSo Jerden was looking over the insignias. He said Delta-45 was a bit rough so I smoothed some of it out and made it more on par with the rolling part. Top will be the old. Bottom will be new.\n\n[[image Delta-45.png]]\n\n------\n\n[[image Delta-45_new.png]]\n\n------\n\nPsi-6: \"Psly Dogs\n\nSo I was suggesting that it would look better with 3 eyes. Id did. Old top new bottom\n\n[[image Psi-6.png]]\n\n------\n\n[[image new_Psi-6.png]]\n\n------\n\nTitan-1: \"Off the Books\"\n\nAgain this was from suggested of Jerden. He has yet to see this.\n\n[[image Titan-1.png]]\n\n------\n\n[[image new_Titan-1.png]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Non-MTF]]\n\nNo Yet...\n\n\nAnyone Up for Poker?\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab ERROR]]\n//ERROR_CODE-423// **PLEASE REPORT THIS ERROR TO** //IT// **STAFF** \n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
