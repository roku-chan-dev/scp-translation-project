SCP-6420-1 is the former residence of Tal Kinigl and Isa Kinigl.

I touched the back of my neck and felt the scab the critter left. \n\nResearcher Davis came into the room and gave me this laptop. He requested that I keep a daily log of my activities and thoughts. Well my thought is that this sucks. I mean, there's a lot more to it than that. I might be in shock. The last thing I remember is climbing the stairs with Joseph.\n\nThe laptop isn't connected to the internet. I'm bored so I looked for games on the laptop.
