See [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4602 the original documentation] for more details. \n\nAny researchers who test SCP-4602 are encouraged to append their experiments to this document.\n\n**Standard Format:**\n> **Customer:** The personnel member making the 'purchase'.\n> **Test Conditions:** Any data relevant to the event. Typically includes any unusual conditions, and what either SCP-4602 stated or the Customer requested in regards to their fortunate event.\n> **Item(s) Given:** The item exchanged, an estimated value in USD if necessary, and any quirks with the exchange itself. \n> **Associated Event:** The fortunate (or unfortunate) event associated with the exchange.\n> **Notes:** The SCP-4602-1 instance/any other additional information.\n\n------\n\n> **Customer:** Junior Researcher David Patel\n> **Test Conditions:** Dr. Patel had requested 'extra luck with the lottery.\n> **Item(s) Given:** The $100 voucher from installing a computer.\n> **Associated Event:** Dr. Patel won a consolation prize of $50.\n> **Notes:** SCP-4602-1 was the originally given voucher, now stamped with the word \"REDEEMED\".\n\n> **Customer:** Junior Researcher Edward Ramirez.\n> **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 was singing to Ramirez about potential good assignments for career advancement.\n> **Item(s) Given:** 1 Credit card (maxed out). When SCP-4602 absorbed the credit card, it was silent for several seconds, before emitting a high-pitched screech and ejecting the card at ███ mph.\n> **Associated Event:** The ejected card embedded itself in the middle of Ramirez's forehead. Ramirez would start to experience numerous unfortunate events, mostly resulting in mild injuries. Analysis of the attached card found that all debts related to the card had been paid. SCP-4602 responded to attempted deals by ejecting coins in a similar manner, usually bouncing off of the target's forehead and returning to SCP-4602. This continued until Ramirez compensated SCP-4602 for the payment.\n> **Notes:** The message '**PAY ME BACK**' appeared in Dr. Ramirez' apartment. A depiction of SCP-4602, wearing an angry expression with its mouth open, was included. Each unfortunate event would cause the message to reappear, sometimes with exaggerated depictions of the event showing SCP-4602 as the direct instigator. \n\n> **Customer:** Security Agent James ██████, later revealed to be a double agent for █████████\n> **Test Conditions:** Agent ██████ approached SCP-4602, and requested that SCP-4602 assist him by allowing him to steal [REDACTED] and escape the facility undetected.\n> **Item(s) Given:** Numerous diamonds and assorted other gemstones, with an estimated value of $10,000\n> **Associated Event:** Agent ██████ successfully located and retrieved [REDACTED], and escaped to outside the walls of Site 57 without alerting security.\n> **Notes:** SCP-4602-1 instance manifested as a 1m x 1m sheet of cardboard, with an audio device shaped like SCP-4602 attached. The audio device began to play a recording of SCP-4602 loudly congratulating Agent ██████ for his successful theft. The SCP-4602-1 instance was also coated in an adhesive substance, which became glued to Agent ██████'s hand. SCP-4602-1 proceeded to play a 'congratulatory' rendition of //Yakety Sax// while Agent ██████ attempted to escape the pursuing Foundation security. Agent ██████ was promptly recaptured.\n> //SCP-4602 seems to possess some level of loyalty to the Foundation, or at least a certain level of cunning to interpret the request in a manner that both allowed it to take Agent ██████'s jewels and avoid significant Foundation backlash.// - Dr. Patel\n\n> **Customer:** Researcher James Kapoor\n> **Test Conditions:** SCP-4602 had requested the names of the O5 council. Dr. Kapoor denied, but questioned SCP-4602 further about its ability to trade in information. SCP-4602 offered to demonstrate.\n> **Item(s) Given:** The location of a Serpent's Hand gathering. Upon agreeing to this, a trail of green mist was sucked from Dr. Kapoor's mouth and into SCP-4602.

This was only £1.50 GBP, but SCP-4602 still complied with the donation.\n> **Associated Event:** SCP-4602 instead did not provide luck with the game Fortnite, but instead on his son's Roblox account, gaining £300 worth of the game's currency, Robux.\n> **Notes:** The receipt said, \"I'm not going to do much for so little.\"\n\n\n> **Customer:** Junior Researcher Dr. Felteich\n> **Test Conditions:** Dr. Felteich requested to visit the //Lemuria Restaurant and Wine Bar//, located in Bonifacio Global City, Philippines.

After thorough tests, the gum proved to be non-anomalous, and was consumed without incident.\n> **Notes:** The SCP-4602-1 instance was written on a chewing gum wrapper. Shortly after the manifestation of SCP-4602-1, security footage recorded a piece of gum appearing in SCP-4602's mouth. SCP-4602's mouth then proceeded to make \"chewing\" motions for ten minutes, followed by several unsuccessful attempts to blow a bubble. \n\n> **Customer:** Dr. King (unauthorized test)\n> **Test Conditions:** Burst into the room in a panicked state, and shouted \"JUST FUCKING TAKE IT!\"\n> **Item(s) Given:** 500 apple seeds, sourced from the \"Golden Delicious\" cultivar. \n> **Associated Event:** Despite not being a form of currency, SCP-4602 accepted the apple seeds as payment.

The coins given to SCP-4602 were explained as leftover change from a recent trip to Japan, and had not been exchanged to USD upon returning to the United States.\n> **Item(s) Given:** 327 JPY.\n> **Associated Event:** Jr Psychologist Yamagusuku discovered a copy of the CD-ROM game \"Oregon Trail II\" in a \"freebies\" box at a local community center. Although they own a digital copy of the game, they had recently felt a desire to purchase a physical copy.\n> **Notes:** The SCP-4602-1 instance was styled to mimic an event from the game, and depicted SCP-4602 in a cowboy hat with the title \"Happy Trails!\" The event options listed were \"Don't,\" \"Die,\" \"Of,\" and \"Dysentery.\"\n\n> **Customer:** Researcher Dr. Alfred N. Madden\n> **Test Conditions:** Dr. Madden claimed he wanted \"the ability to play any musical instrument at will,\" jokingly referencing a \"devil's bargain.\"\n> **Item(s) Given:** $50 USD. Dr. Madden expressed surprise at the low amount, to which SCP-4602 replied that he \"was already pretty alright at music.\"\n> **Associated Event:** Dr. Madden tested his new abilities on various musical instruments, and could use each one effectively on a basic level, including producing standard chords and simplistic melodies. Instruments Dr. Madden already had proficiency with showed no change.\n> **Notes:** SCP-4602-1 instance was dressed in a flannel shirt, had long hair, and held an electric guitar. Caption read \"keep rockin'[sic], man.\"\n\n> **Customer:** Dr. Kelp\n> **Test Conditions:** Dr. Kelp requested \"a three-day weekend.\"\n> **Item(s) Given:** An old Blackberry phone, not currently functioning to make or receive calls. The estimated value is 26 USD.\n> **Associated Event:** A containment failure during routine testing of SCP-████ caused flooding across all of Site-57 along with 7 personnel casualties. All personnel were sent home and no research was able to be conducted for a full three days while MTF Tau-4 (\"Water water everywhere\") drained Site-57.\n> **Notes:** During draining of Site-57, Tau-4 discovered a postcard in a Zip-Top bag found in Dr. Kelp's office.

However, Dr. Avenlee subsequently received an unexpected call from his former Site Director, who expressed a desire to gift him a Blue Lamborghini Aventador for his birthday. The resulting surge in dopamine levels appeared to stabilize the abnormal tumor growth but did not facilitate its removal.\n> **Notes:** The SCP-4602-1 instance was discovered on the backseat of the vehicle. It featured an image of SCP-4602 with a cheerful expression and the caption: \"Enjoy the time you have : )\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
