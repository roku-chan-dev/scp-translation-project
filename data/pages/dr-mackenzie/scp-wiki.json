  "content": "**Name:** Dr. Rachel Mackenzie\n\n**Serial Number:** 0171-UT-00890364\n\n**Security Clearance:** Level 3\n\n**Position:** Senior Observer / Senior Researcher\n\n**Site of Operations:** Variable, usually Site ██\n\n**Profile:** Dr. Mackenzie is a senior researcher whose high marks for observational and situational awareness combined with near-eidetic memory has made her unusually qualified for initial observation and documentation of new SCPs.\n\nDr. Mackenzie was recruited by [REDACTED] on █/██/200█, having come to his notice due to her doctoral thesis [REDACTED], which raised interest as it was related to the theoretical functional premise of SCP-███. Upon recruitment, Dr. Mackenzie served as a field researcher for █ years, until Incident [REDACTED] [REDACTED] request to transfer to Site ██ was approved, as O5 Command deemed her skills too valuable to risk in the field. Since this incident, she has professed a strong dislike for sapient SCPs, and has requested to be excluded from direct interviews with humanoid SCPs and SCP-affected individuals.\n\nDr. Mackenzie is trained in the use of firearms and is authorized to open carry in Foundation facilities except as required by specific containment procedures.\n\n**Addendum 01-003:** Due to the events of Incident [REDACTED], Dr. Rachel Mackenzie has been placed on administrative leave for a period of no less than six (6) months pending review and re-certification.\n\n**Addendum 01-006:** Personnel File Note\n> You can't expect her to have gone through that and not have been traumatized in some way. The problem with people like her is that they remember everything. She cannot and will not ever forget the sight of that, and she's going to carry that with her for the rest of her life. The only responsible thing to do is to remove her from active duty.\n> \n> Dr. ████ ████\n> Site Director, Site-██\n\n**Addendum 01-011:** Personnel File Note\n> We need her, damaged or not. She has saved God knows how many lives, and more importantly she wants to go back to work.\n> \n> She is being re-certified as we speak. Put her in a desk job if you want, but keep her working. We need more people like her.\n> \n> O5-██\n\n**Addendum 01-012:** Personnel File Note\n> Fine, but if she snaps and takes the whole team with her, I will **not** be left holding the bag.\n> \n> Dr. ████ ████\n> Site Director, Site-██\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 02-001:** SCP Files Authored\n* [[[SCP-020]]] - Unseen Mold\n* --SCP-065-- - Recurrent Migratory Crop Circles (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-065]]] - Organic Distortion Field\n* [[[SCP-069]]] - Second Chance\n* --SCP-160-- - Parasitic Worm (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-160]]] - Predator Drone\n* [[[SCP-176]]] - Observable Time Loop\n* [[[SCP-234]]] - Extradimensional Fish\n* --SCP-245-- - Anomalous LEO Object (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-269]]] - Dialysis Bracelet\n* [[[SCP-300]]] - \"A world in a bottle\"\n* [[[SCP-360]]] - Ascendance\n* [[[SCP-390]]] - Ancient Military Laser\n* --SCP-420-- - Pen of Forgery (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-452]]] - Dreamcatcher Spider\n* [[[SCP-488]]] - Meteor Attractor\n* [[[SCP-526]]] - Valhalla Gate\n* [[[SCP-556]]] - Painted Aircraft\n* [[[SCP-605]]] - Living Storm Cloud\n* [[[SCP-636]]] - Elevator to Nowhere\n* [[[SCP-648]]] - The Labyrinth\n* [[[SCP-707]]] - Nesting Dolls\n* [[[SCP-733]]] - A Pair of Scissors\n* --SCP-748-- - Temporarily Lethal Handgun (Deleted)\n* --SCP-748-- - Sand Sculptor (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-768]]] - Long Range Alarm Clock\n* --SCP-788-- - Repercussive Target (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-788]]] - Magma Carp\n* [[[SCP-794]]] - Desert Shipwreck\n* [[[SCP-822]]] - Landmine Cacti\n* [[[SCP-848]]] - Interdimensional Spider Web\n* [[[SCP-859]]] - Arachnophobic Orb\n* [[[SCP-867]]] - Blood Spruce\n* [[[SCP-895]]] - Camera Disruption\n* --SCP-907-- - Infinite Magazine (Deleted)\n* [[[SCP-934]]] - Inland Lighthouse\n* [[[SCP-975]]] - Subway Frogs\n* [[[SCP-976]]] - Anomalous Hard Drive\n* [[[SCP-998]]] - Missing Aircraft\n\n* [[[SCP-1008]]] - Exile Stone\n* [[[SCP-1069]]] - Ys\n* [[[SCP-1096]]] - Perfect Plastic\n* [[[SCP-1100]]] - Gaia's Blood\n* [[[SCP-1136]]] - Subjective Directional Gravity\n* [[[SCP-1192]]] - \"Timmy\"\n* [[[SCP-1210]]] - Anomalous Radar Station\n* [[[SCP-1266]]] - Permian Ark\n* [[[SCP-1276]]] - Venusian Launch Pad\n* [[[SCP-1290]]] - Imperfect Teleporter\n* [[[SCP-1331]]] - Mouth Soap\n* [[[SCP-1375]]] - Extradimensional Tube Station\n* [[[SCP-1376]]] - Documentary Camcorder\n* [[[SCP-1378]]] - A Trip to the Mall\n* [[[SCP-1396]]] - Jovian Kill-Sats\n* [[[SCP-1408]]] - Victorian-Era Memory Rewriter\n* [[[SCP-1460]]] - Dreamwalker\n* [[[SCP-1469]]] - Cookie Cutters\n* [[[SCP-1476]]] - Shattering Geese\n* [[[SCP-1556]]] - Misthorses\n* [[[SCP-1560]]] - Extradimensional Albatross\n* [[[SCP-1586]]] - Fetal Singularity\n* [[[SCP-1663]]] - Containment Site 1663-0\n* [[[SCP-1669]]] - Self-Terminating Loop\n* [[[SCP-1675]]] - Goose Terminator\n* [[[SCP-1676]]] - Customer Loyalty Program\n* [[[SCP-1702]]] - The French Hive\n* [[[SCP-1720]]] - Hijacked Space Probe\n* [[[SCP-1876]]] - Selfish Toothbrush\n* [[[SCP-1899]]] - Suspended Bullet\n* [[[SCP-1930]]] - The Surgeon in the Box\n* [[[SCP-1943]]] - No Anomalies Detected\n\n* [[[SCP-2069]]] - AEGIS\n* [[[SCP-2169]]] - Conversational Surgery\n* [[[SCP-2269]]] - Grandma Spider\n* [[[SCP-2369]]] - Suburban Dollhouse\n* [[[SCP-2469]]] - Sunny Valley\n* [[[SCP-2569]]] - Blood Lamp\n\n**Addendum 02-002:** Log File and External Addenda\n* --Experiment Log 907-2-- - Supplementary Experiment Log for --SCP-907--.
