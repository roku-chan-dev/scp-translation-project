As such, it does not require active containment but may pose danger to individuals using it.** \n[[/div]]\n\n**Item Number:** SCP-7481-1\n\n**Object Class:** Safe \n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 1: Handling and Storage\n[[/div]]\n\n**Storage:** Store in a tightly-sealed container in a cool, brightly-lit, well-ventilated environment. Do not store in the same cabinet as oxidizing materials or incompatible substances. Ensure all vessels are transparent to let light through. Rutile is preferable due to its refractive properties.   \n\n**Handling:** Avoid contact with skin, clothes, and eyes. Keep away from sparks, heat, and sources of sin [[footnote]]See Document 7481-Deontological for details on the objective nature of sin.[[/footnote]]. Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid breathing vapor or mist. \n\n**Intersite transport:** \n\n\n||Public shipping name: || Hexasulfide wurztinite ||\n|| Hazard class: ||  6.1 ||\n|| UN number: || 7481 ||\n|| Packing group: || III ||\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 2: Exposure Controls and Personal Protection \n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Exposure limits**: 50 parts per million (PPM) in air.\n\n Personal protective equipment:\n\n* Eyes: Splash goggles;\n\n* Skin: Nitrile gloves. Do not use latex or any other materials associated with the concept of lust;\n\n* Clothing: Standard hazardous substances lab coat;\n\n* Engineering controls: All facilities storing or utilizing SCP-7481-1 should have a holy water eyewash station, ventilation, and a safety shower.\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 3: Stability and Reactivity\n[[/div]]\n\n**Chemical stability**: Stable at room temperature. May form explosive mixtures in high-oxygen environments. Will degrade or self-replicate depending on local noöspheric environment. \n\n**Conditions to avoid**: Excess heat, all forms of sin, Class 4 plastics, confined spaces. \n\n**Incompatibilities**: Strong oxidizers, any substance associated with purification (such as bleach or soap), strong bases, any plants from the //Boswellia// and //Commiphora// families, and chemically inert metals like gold, silver, lead, and all platinum group metals.  \n\nUnder no circumstances is SCP-7481-1 to be brought into contact with any substance with a conceptual link to mirror polish. This includes all alcohol-based solvents. \n\nSCP-7481-1 may undergo a Kierkegaard reaction with any substance containing significant amounts of sapient soul, such as maple syrup. \n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\n[[[ paralaw|Section 4: Regulatory Information]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ International\n* Controlled substance under the Veil protocol;\n* Class 12 anomalous substance;\n* SCP-7481-1 is cleared for use in civilian applications, veiled and unveiled;\n* Maximum allowable limit for civilians: --0.4g--2g per year;\n* Maximum allowable limit for researchers 10g per year;\n\n+ European\n\n**European Labeling in Accordance with EC Directive 67/548/EEC.**\n\n**Hazard Symbols:**\n[[image image1.jpg size=\"thumbnail\"]] [[image image2.jpg size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n[[image image3.jpg size=\"thumbnail\"]] [[image image4.jpg  size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n\n**Risk Phrases:**\n* R 40 Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect;\n* SCP-7481-1 does not have any undue impact on protected sapients under the Garlic Control Act;\n* SCP-7481-1 does have mild amnestic effects as per the Right to Remember Act (Class 4: Corrupting).\n\n\n+ US Federal\n\n**Clean Air Act:**\n* SCP-7481-1 is classified as a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP);\n* This material does not contain any Class 1/2 Ozone depletors.\n\n**Clean Water Act**\n* SCP-7481-1 is a toxic water pollutant;\n* SCP-7481-1 is a controlled substance as a demonarcotic precursor; \n* SCP-7481-1 is known to the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) for its potential to induce various financial crimes.\n\n**California Prop 65**\n**All consumer products containing SCP-7481-1 are to contain the following warning:**\nWarning: SCP-7481-1 is known to the state of California to cause cancer. \nCalifornia No Significant Risk Level: CAS# 7481 200 æg/day NSRL (inhalation); 50 æg/day NSRL.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 5: Environmental and Veil Concerns\n[[/div]]\n\n**Ecotoxicity**: SCP-7481-1 has moderate aquatic ecotoxic effects and may disrupt ecosystems.\n\n**Noöspheric**: SCP-7481-1 has significant Nöospheric effects if released.\n\n**Veil**: SCP-7481-1 has minor veil-impacting effects.

Remove all contaminated clothing for disposal. Get medical aid and/or priestly intervention if the skin is swollen, irritated, or reddened. \n\n**Ingestion**: Do not induce vomiting unless directed by site medical personnel. If unconscious do not put anything into the subject's mouth.    \n\n**Inhalation**: If inhaled, provide fresh air in direct sunlight[[footnote]]Moonlight is not an an effective substitute despite being reflected sunlight.[[/footnote]]. If not breathing, administer CPR. If the subject has difficulty breathing, administer oxygen with holy water nebulizer treatment. \n\n**Eyes**: In case of contact wash out eyes with a holy water eye station for 5 minutes, then stare directly into the sun for 5 seconds, and proceed to wash eyes for another 10 minutes.   \n\n**Soul**: If soul contact occurs, administer a Class Four exorcism as soon as possible. Uncertified[[footnote]] Accepted standards include Foundation Certification TT5812, a certification of competence in the rite major exorcisms from the Regina Apostolorum Pontifical University or ICSUT NEC512 certification.[[/footnote]] personnel should not attempt an exorcism. The subject should be restrained.\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 9: Disposal\n[[/div]]\n\nChemical waste involving SCP-7481-1 must be disposed of as per document SCP-7481-D. Waste is not to be disposed of by burning, environmental disposal, or ritual cleansing without proper training. \n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #000000; background:#AAAAAA; padding: 1px; font-size: 150%; text-align: center;\"]]\nSection 10: Veil Measures \n[[/div]]\n In case of a major SCP-7481-1 spill into the environment, local social media is to be algorithmically manipulated to provide cover for a regional upswing in violence. If a city in Europe or Latin America is affected, an association football match is to be held as soon as possible. Genetically modified E. coli strain 888  shall be released in the area to decompose SCP-7481-1.  A wide area purification ritual is to be held before the next full moon. Check Document SCP-7481-LV for the appropriate instruments. \n\nAll third-party proposals to ban SCP-7481-1's usage in consumer products on grounds of its status as a carcinogenic material are to be rejected through established bureaucratic channels.\n\nDue to widespread SCP-7481-1 contamination in the area in the Gulf Coastal Lowlands of Florida, there is a significant personnel shortage for cleansing. Safety protocols for large-scale manufacturing and transport of SCP-7481-1 are under revision. Florida is now being used to study the effects of long-term exposure to SCP-7481-1. \n\n**UPDATE:** Due to changes in containment protocols for SCP-7481[[footnote]]See ruling EC2459 on responses to K class events.[[/footnote]], spills of SCP-7481-1 are not to be cleaned. Safety procedures are to be updated for significant scaling up and dispersal of SCP-7481-1. \n\n\n\n**Description:** [REDACTED: Please enter LV3/RAPTURE credentials to continue]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7480]]] | SCP-7481 | [[[SCP-7482]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** image1.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Hazard N.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hazard_N.svg\n\n> **Filename:** image2.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Hazard F.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hazard_F.svg\n\n> **Filename:** image3.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Hazard T.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hazard_T.svg\n\n> **Filename:** image4.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Hazard Xi.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hazard_Xi.svg\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
