Wait. No. That's too far back. Oh I bet you wanna know about the deep dark evil hiding in the woods down here. Too bad. It's still sleeping like a big ol' baby. I get to talkin' 'bout it, she might hear me and wake up. \n\nLemme tell you about how the Foundation got started meddling instead:\n\nIn the late 1800's the American Secure Containment Initiative[[footnote]]What a name.[[/footnote]] built the first containment facility in the state of Alabama in Bay Minette, Baldwin County. Several conflicts with other precursor Foundation organizations were resolved through the eventual consolidation of all anomalous objects and research at the Bay Minette facility for the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-gulf greater gulf region].\n\nFrom 1933 to 1946 the Gulf Region was a major flashpoint during the Second Global Occult War. Due to global memory alteration and reality restructuring resulting from the end of that conflict, the full extent of ASCI involvement has yet to be fully understood. The erasure of the New Paris peninsula from the timeline during this conflict led to the Bay Minette facility becoming the largest containment facility in the American Southeast. \n\nThe period following the conclusion of the Second GOW until the Foundation's formation in the early 1950's was limited to re-containing objects capable of causing similar widespread destruction. However, the increasing volume of anomalies contained at the Bay Minette facility began to strain both the storage capacity of the site and the secrecy of the project.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=fence.JPG|caption=Looks pretty welcoming.|link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-88/fence.JPG\"]]\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Foundation began to explore options to expand the Bay Minette facility. However, due to increased urbanization and telecom capacities, it was deemed an unacceptable security risk to expand the facility any further in a populated area.  The construction of the current facilities at Site-88 were begun in 1968 and completed in 1970.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2011, the site was run by Dr. Malcolm Maddox[[footnote]]This guy's an asshole. Pardon my french.[[/footnote]]. Following the end of Dr. Maddox's employment, the site was placed under the administration of Dr. Phillip Foster. Site containment breaches have gone down approximately 24%[[footnote]]Well this number's about to get blown all to hell.[[/footnote]] yearly under the new administration.\n\nSee. Now that wasn't so bad. I like a little history. Now, I'm gonna level with y'all: I've had a good time here so far. For a shadowy pseudo-governmental organization you ain't half bad. You live as long as I have, though, and you know things are only gonna get worse, not better. Tell Yolanda and Carl I'm sorry, but I need to get getting on.
