Research is being performed by the Department of Astronomy and the Department of Esoteric Physics to yield a plausible explanation for the phenomena, operating under direct O5 purview until further notice. Due to the technological requirements for detecting the phenomena, civilian discovery is considered a non-risk.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5080 is a set of far-past cosmic phenomena discovered by Foundation astronomy teams over the course of 2021. Each phenomenon results from events which occurred prior to 10^^-12^^ seconds of cosmic time, one picosecond after the Big Bang.\n\nInitial observations were conducted using separate experimental techniques and equipment. Until further testing can be performed, it is not yet verified whether the phenomena are truly present or are results owing to unidentified technological errors.\n\nPhenomena and associated discoveries are categorized below.\n\n++ __5080-ALEPH:__\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px\"]]\n\n5080-ℵ is the detected cosmic ontological background. Deriving from methods of enhancing human concept recognition, developed by the Metaphysics Department for the containment of [[[SCP-4813|conceptual]]] [[[SCP-2719|anomalies]]], and the Ontological Reference Index, a Foundation database storing information on all known and human-interpretable concepts, the Astronomy Department constructed the MONAD Receiver Array. When neurally linked to a human subject, the Array causes a dramatic increase in the brain's natural ability to recognize ideas associated with its surrounding environment, which can be focused by connecting to cosmological research satellites. Theoretically, this could permit the detection of concepts from the very early universe.\n\nThe Array was run uninterrupted from March to May of 2021. Results were wholly filtered of neurological noise by AIC units by June. Identified base concepts, along with their associated components, are as follows:\n\n||~ Base Concept||~ Associated Concepts||\n||Worms||Flesh, wriggle, grow||\n||Flesh||Not flesh||\n||Sensation (physical)||Mushy||\n||Laws of physics||Esophagus||\n||Gravity||Missing||\n||Sound||Moaning||\n||Light||Immense||\n||Crown||N/A||\n||Union||N/A||\n||Elation||Instantaneous||\n||Shock||Instantaneous||\n[[/div]]\n\n++ __5080-BET__\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px\"]]\n\n5080-ℶ is the cosmic psionic background, as unintentionally detected in a joint procedure by the Astronomy Department and the [[[SCP-2664|Psionics Division]]] to measure ambient interstellar Ψ-waves. While a background of faint psionic radiation was anticipated during research, all deployed satellites recorded abnormally intense Ψ-wave bursts with identical characteristics, dating to a cosmic time frame of 10^^-32^^--10^^-12^^ seconds.\n\nThe first conversion of the bursts into interpretable data is a transcription of all contained human-comprehensible thoughts (5080-ℶ/1). 5080-ℶ/1 text is below.\n\n> 13.\n> \n> 12.\n> \n> Un-warm.\n> \n> 11.\n> \n> 10.\n> \n> All skin?\n> \n> 9.\n> \n> Skin.\n> \n> 8.\n> \n> 7.\n> \n> Melting is encouraged.\n> \n> 6.\n> \n> This particle peels around your eye.

When observed, subjects claim to see \"a missile.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ __5080-GIMEL__\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 0px 20px 0px 20px\"]]\n\nIn response to the discovery 5080-ℵ and 5080-ℶ, preexisting data on the cosmic background radiation was ran through a series of memetic decoding processes. Presuming theories of mass–energy–information equivalence are correct, then any substantial informational abnormalities could be discerned in the same way the psionic and conceptual abnormalities were.\n\nDecoding completed in December of 2021.
