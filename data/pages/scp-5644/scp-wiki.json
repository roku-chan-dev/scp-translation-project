Any significant deviation from SCP-5644's normal pathing is to be reported to Site-95 director William Orville.  In the event that SCP-5644 becomes hostile, civilian evacuation of the region is to be carried out in coordination with the Egyptian, Sudanese[[footnote]]As a result of the Sudanese Revolution, this is currently being done with the Transitional Military Council.[[/footnote]], South Sudanese, Ethiopian, and Ugandan governments. News outlets will be led to believe that the evacuation was caused by significant flooding of the Nile River and its drainage basin. Any attempt to remove or neutralize SCP-5644, regardless of operational success, may result in catastrophic consequences for the region.[[footnote]]The most probable outcome will be that the Nile River, as well as its drainage basin, will undergo a desertification process.[[/footnote]]\n\nAny and all reports of SCP-5644 by civilian witnesses to news outlets are to be discredited. All civilians and reporters involved with said sightings are to be given Class-A amnestics.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5644 is a sapient male //Crocodylus niloticus//[[footnote]]Nile Crocodile.[[/footnote]]. It measures 9.15 meters and weighs approximately 4,250 kilograms. Despite its immense size, sightings of SCP-5644 by the public are minimal and are only reported from small villages. SCP-5644's age is unknown, but it is believed to be at least 200,000 years old. SCP-5644's primary anomaly is its control over the climate of the Nile River and its tributaries. Its control ranges from bringing in dry seasons and floods to changing the river's course and expanding its drainage basin. SCP-5644 refers to itself as the protector and guide of the Nile. SCP-5644 claims to have interacted with the inhabitants of the region from the early dynastic period of Egypt until the middle ages.\n\nThe Foundation became aware of SCP-5644's existence when the United Kingdom began to construct dams across the Nile in the early 1900s. SCP-5644 would actively hamper, damage, or destroy these dams. After years of ineffective attempts at capturing SCP-5644, the British government handed responsibility to The Foundation. All containment attempts were abandoned after ██-██-1956 when SCP-5644 was removed from the Nile River, which resulted in the flooding of the local area and all nearby plant life to decay. The area where this event happened has been sectioned off from the public and is now where Site-95 resides.\n\n**Addendum.1 - Interviews** After the events of ██-██-1956, SCP-5644 avoided all attempts at contact by Foundation personnel. In order to monitor the location of SCP-5644, several observation posts were constructed along the Nile River and its tributaries. Researcher Hanesworth, who headed the SCP-5644 project, then proposed leaving food for it in areas it frequented to gain its trust and cooperation. Site Director Orville approved the proposition, provided Hanesworth himself placed the food with two members of Mobile Task Force Lambda-9 \"Osiris's Hand\".\n\nHanesworth approached the riverbed with carcasses of animals from the region every day. Initially, all attempts failed as SCP-5644 would not approach the food until researcher Hanesworth left the area. Hanesworth insisted that the guards leave so that SCP-5644 would approach. After several attempts, SCP-5644 allowed Hanesworth to approach closer. Starting on 05-27-1997, SCP-5644 would allow Hanesworth to stay next to the food as it fed.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Interview #1\" hide=\"▽ Interview #1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5644\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Hanesworth\n\n**Foreword:** Researcher Hanesworth had left a deceased //Syncerus caffer//[[footnote]]African buffalo.[[/footnote]] on a riverbed SCP-5644 frequents. After 15 minutes, SCP-5644 appeared out of the river and began consuming the carcass. Hanesworth had a hidden recorder on his person, in the event that SCP-5644 could communicate.\n\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//(The sounds of cracking bones and flesh ripping are heard in the background)//\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Can... Can you understand me?\n\n**SCP-5644:** //(bellows and turns towards Hanesworth)//\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Oh, shit!\n\n**SCP-5644:** Calm down human, I won't feast upon you. I do not hunt your kind anyway.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** You.. you can talk. I-I mean um, why did you let me get closer to you?\n\n**SCP-5644:** Why indeed. //(turns back towards the carcass and continues to eat)//\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Do... do you mind explaining your control over the Nile?\n\n**SCP-5644:** //(stops eating and turns towards Hanesworth)// It is but an extension of myself. I control the river's flow and in return, it gives me life.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** So, would you say that your containment would detriment the region?\n\n**SCP-5644:** Is that what your leaders tried to do to me? To 'contain' me?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Well... yeah. It's sort of our deal. We contain anomalies and research them for the safety of mankind.\n\n**SCP-5644:** And by attempting to reach this goal, how many have died in the name of safety?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** We've crossed some lines, yes, but you must understand that we only have the best interests in mind.\n\n**SCP-5644:** Those interests only further the goals of your superiors. If you were to 'contain' me, this river and all that it flows into would dry up.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** But if people were to see you-\n\n**SCP-5644:** Have they thus far?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Well no, but that's because we've suppressed all reports.\n\n**SCP-5644:** Then there is nothing more to discuss nor worry about.\n\n//There was a minute of silence recorded as SCP-5644 continued to feed upon the carcass.//\n\n**L9 Beta-2:** //(in the background)// Hey doc, you doin' alright!?\n\n**SCP-5644:** That would be our time. Tell me, what is your name?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** My name? It's uh, Hanesworth.\n\n**SCP-5644:** I hope to speak to you again, Hanesworth.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Before Lambda-9 Beta could arrive, SCP-5644 dragged the carcass into the river and disappeared. For the next few days, no contact could be established with SCP-5644 and Researcher Hanesworth suggested that his guards not be within visual range of the river bank. A compromise was reached where every 30 minutes they would do a check-in before returning to the vehicle just outside of visual range.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Interview #2\" hide=\"▽ Interview #2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5644\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Hanesworth\n\n**Foreword:** Contact was successfully established after the second attempt of the new procedure. This interview occurred shortly after the third check-in by Research Hanesworth's armed guards. He activated a transmission shortly after contact with SCP-5644 to let his guards know he had done so. This time Hanesworth brought a hidden camera on his person to record this interview.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//(Sounds of the camera being activated can be heard before it is turned on)//\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** So... you finally showed up.\n\n**SCP-5644:** My apologies, but I would rather communicate in private.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Well we're not //entirely// alone. //(Hanesworth gestures behind them over the riverbank)//\n\n**SCP-5644:** I had a feeling that was the case. Your people appear to be... very untrustworthy.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** They are, but so are you. But that begs the question, why do you //trust// me?\n\n**SCP-5644:** You misunderstand, Hanesworth. I don't trust you. Not yet anyway. But I see myself as a decent judge of character, and you don't seem to be a bad person.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Then why did you come back?\n\n**SCP-5644:** You remind me of someone I used to know.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** What were they like? If you don't mind my asking.\n\n**SCP-5644:** It is a... long story.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** You can't just give me that. Just the details will suffice.\n\n**SCP-5644:** He was a Roman boy. Much like yourself he would come to the riverside and feed me, although it was with lesser portions than what you give me.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Whoa wait, Roman? How old are you exactly?\n\n**SCP-5644:** Old enough to have seen this region turn from green to sand numerous times, older than your entire species. Now, will you let me continue?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Yes, I'm sorry. Please continue with your tale.\n\n**SCP-5644:** This boy and his family were farmers, but were pressured by local soldiers to give a significant portion of their crops and meat to them. I asked if he would like my assistance, but he declined. He was a stubborn, yet compassionate, young boy.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** What happened to them?\n\n**SCP-5644:** I was waiting for the boy when I saw the smoke. By the time I arrived the farm had nearly burned down. I desperately looked for the boy and his family. It was too late... he was huddling the livestock and covered in gashes, bruises, and burns. He was barely conscious. I tried to save him but... he gently touched my jaw and smiled.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** I'm... I'm so sorry...\n\n**SCP-5644:** Don't be, this happened well over a thousand years ago. I'm sure that even with the miracles your people can perform, nothing could save him. But it still hurts, you know.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** I know how you feel. When you work a job like this you need to get used to not seeing your friends the next day. And it's always the people you care about too...\n\n**SCP-5644:** Grief is shared among all beings. I am sorry for your losses.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** You know SCP-5644, I think that-\n\n**SCP-5644:** SCP-5644? What is that?\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Oh, uh, that's what me and my superiors call you. Consider it a tag.\n\n**SCP-5644:** Well between us you can call me by the name given to me by your kind some few thousand years ago.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** And what would that name be?\n\n**SCP-5644:** Oh, my apologies! Long ago, they called me Sobek.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Woah! Like the deity?\n\n**SCP-5644:** I suppose, although I've never considered myself one.\n\n//(Hanesworth's guards can be heard calling for him in the background)//\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** Damn it, has it been an hour already?\n\n**SCP-5644:** It would appear we've been interrupted again. I did enjoy our chat.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** You don't need to leave, I can convince them to leave us alone.\n\n**SCP-5644:** I have matters to attend to anyhow.\n\n**Researcher Hanesworth:** But what about the food?\n\n**SCP-5644:** Leave it for the others. But you'll no longer need it to converse with me. Take care Hanesworth.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** After this interview, researcher Hanesworth requested that the armed guards do not come to him unless he calls for them. Given SCP-5644's behavior towards Hanesworth, this request was granted. Researcher Hanesworth and SCP-5644 would meet frequently for the remainder of 1997. The frequency of these meetings, as well as the growing relationship between Hanesworth and SCP-5644, prompted an internal investigation into Researcher Hanesworth's conduct. \n\nThe investigation concluded on 02-05-1998 and found that Hanesworth was fraternizing with an anomalous entity, and was subsequently reprimanded. Hanesworth was removed from his position but was allowed to continue to interview SCP-5644 once a month under close supervision. Subsequent interviews offered significantly more insight into SCP-5644.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.2 - Incident-5644:** On 07-13-20██ Lake Kyoga's waterline significantly diminished, extending the shoreline by nearly a kilometer. This caused significant flooding across much of the Nile River and its tributaries. Determining SCP-5644 to be the cause, MTF Lambda-9 \"Osiris's Hand\" and MTF Epsilon-6 \"Village Idiots\" were deployed to all affected areas. Disguised as UN Peacekeepers and members of the Red Cross, both task forces evacuated civilians in the area.\n\nMTF Lambda-9 scanned the area of Lake Kyoga in search of SCP-5644. On 07-15-20██ a small team accompanied by Senior Researcher Hanesworth located SCP-5644 on a shoreline near Bukungu. The following was recorded on L9 Alpha-1's helmet-mounted camera.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Encounter 5644-20██-3\" hide=\"▽ Encounter 5644-20██-3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//(Sounds of the audio capture being turned on can be heard. Image capture shows SCP-5644 laying on a riverbank, showing moderate injuries, resting. Senior researcher Hanesworth can be seen running towards SCP-5644.)//\n\n**L9 Alpha-1:** Hanesworth calm yourself! It could be hostile!\n\n**Hanesworth:** Can it! It could be worse than it looks!\n\n**Alpha-1:** Sir, even if that were the case, we need to report this to command.\n\n**Hanesworth:** Even so, he needs treatment now!\n\n//(L9 Alpha-1 looks around to his other squad members. After some hesitation, he points towards Alpha-3 and Alpha-5)//\n\n**L9 Alpha01:** Three, call in for medical! Five come with me to help this thing!\n\n//(Alpha-1 and Alpha-5 run towards Hanesworth and SCP-5644, and begin to apply medical aid. Hanesworth can be seen near SCP-5644's head comforting it.)//\n\n**Hanesworth:** It'll be alright, you'll be given good care.\n\n**SCP-5644:** Then what, will they 'contain' me like the rest?\n\n**Hanesworth:** They couldn't even if they wanted. It's way less of a risk for them to let you be.\n\n//(there is silence for next few seconds as Alpha-1 and 5 continue medical aid.)//\n\n**Hanesworth:** What happened here...?\n\n**SCP-5644:** She was attempting to abuse the river. I had to put an end to it.\n\n**Hanesworth:** Whoever it was, we could have helped you.\n\n**SCP-5644:** I appreciate your concern, but the responsibility is mine and mine alone.\n\n**Hanesworth:** This is exactly what I was worried about! What if you need to be in two places at once? You've already admitted that times are changing. Just say the word...\n\n//(SCP-5644 bellows, startling Alpha-1 and 5.)//\n\n**SCP-5644:** I will consider. Return to the normal shoreline, the lake will fill in soon.\n\n//(Alpha-1 then looks over SCP-5644's back, and notices the waterline beginning to slowly rise and turns towards Hanesworth.)//\n\n**Alpha-1:** Sir, we need to leave. By the time medical comes, we'll be underwater.\n\n**Hanesworth:** He needs treatment!\n\n**SCP-5644:** I'll be fine my friend. This isn't my first encounter with her, and it won't be the last. Now go.\n\n//(Alpha-1 and 5 finish their medical treatment and begin to pull away Hanesworth as the water approaches their feet. Hanesworth initially resists but is eventually coerced by Alpha-5. Alpha-1 orders the team to return to the vehicle. Alpha-1 turns back as they approach the vehicle and watch the water rise above SCP-5644 and quicken its rise. Alpha-1 enters the vehicle and it drives away from the waterline. The audio and visual feed is cut off moments later by Alpha-1.)//\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Report on Incident-5644:** \n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Report\" hide=\"▽ Report\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nFrom our intelligence, Incident-5644 began as an unknown entity, described as having the head of a crocodile and the body of a lion and hippopotamus[[footnote]]This description is similar to that of Ammit, an Ancient Egyptian demoness and goddess[[/footnote]], attempted to alter the entire Laky Kyoga area. SCP-5644 noticed this change due to its anomalous properties and headed towards the area. The subsequent drainage of Lake Kyoga was seemingly an attempt by SCP-5644 to stall and subvert the entity's progress. The flooding of other areas is seen as a side effect of this action. Eyewitness reports indicate that SCP-5644 and the unknown entity had been locked in combat for a few hours before Foundation personnel arrived. By the time Foundation forces arrived and secured the area, the unknown entity was not seen nor encountered.\n\nClass-A and Class-B amnestics were administered to the local population, and news outlets were led to believe the drainage and flooding were natural events. The actions of Senior Researcher Hanesworth and L9 Alpha were under review by the ethics committee. Yesterday they announced their actions of giving medical aid to an anomalous entity were justified, given the circumstances. Currently, SCP-5644 movements have returned to normal but a second Site may be needed in order to cover the vast range of SCP-5644's influence.\n\nIn conclusion, if it were not for SCP-5644's actions the Foundation would have been faced with a Broken Veil scenario. Given its apparent nature, as well as the interaction with one of our senior staff, SCP-5644 appears to be benevolent and nonhostile. So long as no harm is done to Senior Researcher Hanesworth and contact between the two stays steady, we should not have to fear SCP-5644 turning hostile to the Foundation.\n\n- Site-95 Director William Orville\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.3 - Hanesworth's Journal:** The following addendum contains an entry from Hanesworth's journal that document's a previously unknown encounter he had with SCP-5644. The entry is believed to be written prior to Incident-5644.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Journal Entry\" hide=\"▽ Journal Entry\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nJournal Entry #52\n\nToday I met with Sobek. It had been a while since I had seen him. We hadn't had a chance to see each other as often as we used to since the O5 stuck their noses in. It was the middle of the night when I found Sobek again. It's not that hard to spot him, but damn does he look intimidating. When I approached he turned his head toward me, and at first, he didn't recognize me. Once I made him aware of my identity he seemed to relax a little and gestured me to move closer. After I sat near him, it was silent for a while. I finally broke it when I asked him 'what was it like being treated like a god?' A silly question for sure, but my curiosity had piqued its interest.\n\nHe simply laughed and said that he never experienced it personally. His actions throughout the river were what caused him to be worshipped, not so much because he sought it. I then asked him 'then why do you call yourself Sobek?' He stated that it was the name they gave him, and he never had a name to address himself as before. Sobek said that since so many people were praying to him, the least he could do was accept the name. I wondered if the other Egyptian gods were real, to which he responded that he wasn't sure. He acknowledged the possibility of them existing, but he stated that he never met them.\n\nFor a while, we just stared at the moon. We talked about many things. We talked about politics, history, biology, and even sports. We enlightened each other on so many things. After witnessing Sobek's wiseness and intelligence, a part of me began to think he really was a god. Then he told me of his concerns. With the world evolving, the number of threats was increasing. If there were two crises at once, he would have to leave one to suffer for longer than the other. I told him that the Foundation could help. We have plenty of assets not being used right now. He thanked me for my generosity but said that the river was his responsibility alone. \n\nI said that if he kept thinking like that, he would get lonely. Sobek stated that he already felt alone. After he met humanity, after guiding us out of Africa, he felt like he could change. But after that boy died he realized that he would outlive everyone he made friends with. His own kind feared him, even those that prayed to him every day held a degree of fear. Instead, he said, he would protect the region and guarantee the lives of future generations. I then asked him if we were friends. He laid there silently before answering we could be, but only if I recognized that we couldn't be for long. I said that didn't matter, and that if anything I wanted to be friends. \n\nI've never seen an SCP, let alone a giant crocodile, cry before. I didn't know how to hug something that big, but I think I did a pretty good job. We sat there for a while longer before he suddenly turned his head downriver and began to hiss. I asked what was wrong, and he said something is troubling the source. Before he left he said his goodbyes and said we would meet soon. As he disappeared beneath the surface of the water I began to worry that we wouldn't reunite, and if we did, it wouldn't be a happy reunion.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5643]]] | SCP-5644 | [[[SCP-5645]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
