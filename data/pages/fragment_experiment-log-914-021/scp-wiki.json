The mug was previously broken, repaired with epoxy, and broke again into pieces.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The same mug, without any damage. Beside the mug was a small pile of epoxy, arranged into a üôÇ shape.\n\n//Note: I broke a mug when transferring here, let me try. -- Dr. Query//\n\n**Name:** Dr. Jeyne Query\n**Date:** 05/09/2024\n**Total Items:** One Mug (broken, repaired)\n\n**Input:** One mug, broken, and repaired with epoxy. The mug was water-tight at the time of the test.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A ceramic novelty salt shaker, resembling a pig waiter. On closer inspection, all holes are clogged with epoxy resin.\n\n//Note: I don't understand. Why isn't it the same? I guess it's water-tight, at least? -- Dr. Query//\n[[>]]\n//Yeah, that tends to happen. Whatever you expect of 914, it'll likely do something else. Personnel here hold the belief that the thing can develop affection towards people, Johnson gave it a much needed tune-up a few years ago, and this is how it generally responds.//\n\n//Try different settings, but don't test the same object or settings too many times. Observations led some to believe that it can get ''bored'' of doing the same thing over again. Don't try to figure out how it ''thinks'', trust me. I tried.//\n\n//To personnel that weren't there during the meeting: we're introducing Dr. Query as a new Director of Research over the next few weeks. I'll still be around as head of Human Resources, and if you're sent to me, you screwed up enough that Dr. Query doesn't want to deal with you anymore. You don't want that situation. - Veritas//\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Test 914-2002**\n**Name:** Dr. Heart\n**Date:** 24/06/2024\n**Total Items:** An A-4 sized paper displaying the question \"What are you?\"\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An identical A-4 sized blank paper that manifests the comprehensive biodata of an individual upon contact with the person's thumb as a projection on flat surfaces. This effect is transient, ceasing when the individual's thumb is no longer in contact with the paper. The displayed data vanishes upon removal of contact and reappears solely upon subsequent physical interaction.\n\n//Note: I'm not really sure what to do with this, should it be stored or incinerated? - Dr. Heart//\n\n//Note: Storing this could prove beneficial for obtaining accurate insights about any suspicious individual. I say, we keep it. - Dr. Avenlee//\n\n//Note: Storage. - Dr. Query//\n-----\n**Test 914-2003**\n**Name:** Dr. Technetium\n**Date:** 05/09/2024 \n**Total Items:** One Smart device with civilian-created malware\n\n**Input:** One Smart device with civilian-created malware\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Upon the Output booth opening, all electronic devices within the immediate area immediately downloaded and installed an unknown form of malware that was unable to be removed by designated anti-malware Site software. All devices affected in this way were scrapped and the remains incinerated. Upon inspection, the Output booth was revealed to contain a device that appears to be miniaturized with excess material found in the corner of the output booth. As a precaution, this was incinerated as well.\n\n//Note: And this is why we don't play around with viruses. - Dr. Query//\n-----\n**Test 914-2004**\n**Name:** Dr. Technetium\n**Date:** 06/09/2024\n**Total Items:** Blueprints for the Foundation-made EXO-1 prototype satellite\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One blueprint of an unknown device (said device bears slight similarities to the NASA Voyager-1 probe. These include: satellite dish, Ultraviolet Spectrometer, \"improved\" radio science system). 25% of the blueprint is written in a currently unidentified language. Translation is currently being attempted.\n-----\n**Test 914-2005**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Skiver\n**Date:** 09/09/2024\n**Total Items:** One //Zippo//-brand lighter\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Visually identical //Zippo//-brand lighter. However, the lighter's flame was completely resistant to conventional ways to put out fire. The only discovered way to extinguish the flame was to simply close the lighter.\n\n//Note: I am requesting permission to keep the lighter for personal use. - Junior Researcher Skiver//\n\n//Note: Denied. If the effect is the same when the the lighter actually ignites something, we're risking the entire place burning down. It's going to anomalous storage. - Dr. Query//\n-----\n**Test 914-2006**\n**Name:** Intern Lacte\n**Date:** 11/09/2024\n**Total Items:** Personnel file of Intern Lacte, five assorted Christmas greeting cards, one admission speech written by Intern Lacte\n\n**Input:** Personnel file of Intern Lacte\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** \"Personnel file\" regarding a squirrel with wings. File structure is consistent with that of standard Foundation personnel documentation.\n\n//Note: Should I be insulted? - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** Five Christmas greeting cards\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One paper model of a figure resembling Santa Claus bludgeoning a snowman with a large bag.\n\n**Input:** One admission speech\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One admission speech containing very small text. Speech consists of recountment of  various failures from Intern Lacte's life and Intern Lacte's happiness at being admitted into the \"Failure Show\". --Reading this file will cause the reader to remember every event featured on the speech.-- Intern Lacte reading this file will cause him to remember every event featured on the speech. \n\n//Requesting incineration of this. No one needs to know my high school years. Or really anything on this. - Intern Lacte//\n\n//Note: Approved. We all have something we'd like to forget. - Dr. Query//\n-----\n**Test 914-2007**\n**Name** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 22/09/2024\n**Total Items:** One handwritten note on a sticky note, one fountain pen with black ink, one copy of R. Ibarazaki's medical records, two commercially available prosthetic legs\n\n//Note: Hi! I just got transferred here from the Site-19 main campus, and I just wanna familiarise myself with 914. Also, not sure what the whole intro note thing is, but might as well! - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned note, containing the following message, ‚ÄúHi 914! Please don't make my job here too hard! I hope working with you will go well!‚Äù, aforementioned pen\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One note with seemingly incomprehensible scribbles, one fountain pen. When viewed by --R. Ibarazaki-- anyone in the medical field, the note is interpreted as saying ‚ÄúTake some penmanship lessons.‚Äù, in near perfect clarity.\n\n//Note: Oh, very funny. It's making fun of doctor's handwriting. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** R. Ibarazaki's medical records\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A cognitohazardous symbol that, when viewed, removes feelings of phantom limb pain in people suffering from it, but causes it in a non-existent limb in all viewers who do not suffer from it. Incinerated.\n\n**Input:** Two commercially available prosthetic legs\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A high tension spring made of carbon fibre, attached to a sharp steel disc. When the output booth opened, it immediately fired, launching the disc at the retrieving D-Class and causing the amputation of both legs below the knee.\n\n//Note: Well, looked like it hurt. What a hello. Is it strange that I still want to test with it? Also, can that D-Class see output #2 before it's incinerated? - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: To whoever I overheard in the break room saying it'd be funny to put this thing in a jack-in-a-box: please don't. - Researcher Boneka//\n-----\n**Test 914-2008**\n**Name:** Dr. Shep\n**Date:** 27/09/2024\n**Total Items:** Three rocks, three sheets of paper, three pairs of scissors, and one copy of //Pok√©mon HeartGold//\n\n**Input:** One rock, one sheet of paper, one pair of scissors\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Rock took the place of where the scissors were, scissors took the place of where paper was, and paper took the place of where rock was.\n\n**Input:** One rock, one sheet of paper (from previous output)\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Crushed rock fragments covered by a sheet of paper\n\n**Input:** Two scissors\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two scissors, positioned as if trying to cut each other, to no success.\n\n**Input:** One rock, one sheet of paper, one pair of scissors\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One small statuette of a fist, carved in stone, one small statuette of a peace hand gesture made of metal, and one impossibly complex, small origami sculpture of a flat hand.\n\n**Input:** One rock, one sheet of paper, one pair of scissors\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One sculpture of an ouroboros devouring itself, crafted in stone, metal, and paper.\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Pok√©mon HeartGold//\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One copy of //Pok√©mon HeartGold// with all Pok√©mon up to Generation IX available in the game, and mega evolution added. The in-game text is incomprehensible, but otherwise completely playable.\n\n//Note: It's the perfect Pok√©mon game. It brings tears to my eyes... I'll be spending the rest of my life playing this over and over after I get all the text back to English. - Dr. Shep//\n\n//Note: Ohh, Pok√©mon! Can I play it when you're done? - Resident Ibarazaki//\n\n**Addendum:** The game bricks the system it's playing on upon ejection. The game system emits strange audio when powered on and is otherwise nonfunctional.\n\n//Note: Output was confiscated after it was discovered that using it causes an addictive feeling of euphoria that made affected personnel experience withdrawal symptoms when not in use. Personnel that were affected have since made a full recovery. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n//Note: You wouldn't understand. It was perfect until it bricked my DS. Now my DS is making noises and I have to turn it in for testing and buy a new one. I knew I should have just put it on Fine. - Dr. Shep//\n\n//Note: Congrats Dr. Shep, you've made Lavender Town Syndrome real. - Dr. Query//\n-----\n**Test 914-2009**\n**Name:** Dr. Shep\n**Date:** 30/09/2024\n**Total Items:** One copy of //Pok√©mon Sapphire//, one copy of //Pok√©mon Ruby//, and one copy of //Pok√©mon Emerald//\n\n//Note: After the previous incident, I'm not going to put games on anything other than the 1:1 setting. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Input:** //Pok√©mon Ruby//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of //Pok√©mon Sapphire//\n\n**Input:** //Pok√©mon Sapphire//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of //Pok√©mon Ruby//\n\n**Input:** //Pok√©mon Emerald//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of //Pinobee//\n\n//Note: It made sense until that last part. My guess is that Emerald not having a counterpart causes 914 to pick a different game entirely on the system. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Input:** //Pinobee//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of //Pok√©mon Emerald//. The save file has the trainer name \"914\" on it. 3 badges are collected and the run seems to be a nuzlocke.\n\n//Note: I need someone with more info on 914 to explain what happened here. Did 914 play the game or just make a save file to mess with me? - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Addendum**: A nuzlocke is a run where the //Pok√©mon// fainting is considered a death and must be placed in a PC Box. The player can only catch one //Pok√©mon// per route, (the first encounter in a route) and they must be nicknamed. SCP-914 named them numerically. No other known special clauses are in effect for the run.\n-----\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 201X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 201X Test Logs\"]]\n-----\n**Test 914-2010**\n**Name:** Dr. Shep\n**Date:** 01/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Three single beds, all equal size, each with a white pillow and white blanket. \n\n//Note: The assigned D-Class personnel is diagnosed with sleep apnea and has been selected specifically for testing the outputs of this experiment. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Input:** One bed, unmade\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A fully made bed. The quality of bed-making is simple.\n\n//Notes: D-382 states it felt no different than before. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Input:** One bed, unmade\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A fully made bed. The pillow is set neatly at an angle against the frame. The blanket is stitched with heart patterns. The wooden legs are decoratively carved with fancy vine patterns.\n\n//Notes: D-382 was hesitant to lie in the bed, complaining about it being \"too girly,\" but complied with a encouragement. D-382 quickly acclimated and described it as \"Pretty damn comfortable.\" - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Input:** One bed, unmade\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A fully made, tucked bed with elaborate detail. The pillow is pre-fluffed. The blanket has visible fine fibers, and high quality stitching along the edges. The wooden legs have intricate carvings of sleeping angels and cherubs.\n\n//Note: D-382 became unconscious within twelve seconds of lying in the bed. Medical staff removed him from the bed and determined he has become comatose, stuck in REM sleep. D-382 has been put on medical support to keep him alive while we try to figure out how to wake him up. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Addendum**: The Very Fine output was confirmed to cure sleep apnea permanently at the cost of permanent REM sleep.\n\n//Note: I don't think the trade-off is worth it. I'll have to find another way to help my sleep apnea. The bed might make for a more humane bed for hospice of comatose terminal patients, though. - Dr. Shep//\n\n//Note: We generally avoid releasing anomalous objects into the public, Shep. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2011**\n**Name:** Prof. Fuselo, --Micropseudocologist-- Zoologist\n**Date:** 30/09/2024\n**Total Items:** [Redacted] PhD belonging to Prof. Fuselo\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** The PhD was changed from [Redacted] to \"Micropseudocology.\" The chairman is signed as \"Galskd,\" the President is signed as \"Pakdjel,\" the chancellor is signed as \"Rjskddk,\" and the executive vice president is signed \"Wksksks.\" It also changed the name to \"Fuselo.\"\n\n//Note: I did not write that as my name, but given that I can't remember my name anymore, and the PhD is being read as valid, and all copies of my name have been replaced, Fuselo it is. - Prof. Fuselo, Micropseudocologist (Whatever that is)//\n\n**Addendum**: When the name on the PhD was erased, all instances of the name disappeared. Testing researcher wrote \"Fuselo\" in its place, causing all records to change to Fuselo. Prof. Fuselo then changed the profession to Zoologist, since Micropseudocology does not exist, and suddenly gained knowledge of zoological topics. It didn't change any previous instances of profession.\n\n//Note: Before I forget, all previous instances of my name prior to the addendum was listed as \"Fhsleso.\" I can't seem to be able to change it back for record-keeping sake, but I can write it in current instances. - Prof. Fuselo, Zoologist//\n-----\n**Test 914-2012**\n**Name:** Intern Lacte\n**Date:** 01/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One mug bearing the logo of the Foundation Internship Program, one Foundation containment breach reaction pamphlet, five Foundation- issued pencil sharpeners, one Foundation-distributed pen, one deck of standard Foundation playing cards\n\n//Note: I got a bunch of swag from the internship program. They gave me like five of everything so I have plenty of extras. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One mug\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One mug with the text \"The Department of Abnormalities\" printed on it.\n\n//Note: Eh? A department of what? - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One pen\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Three Foundation-brand fountain pen ink capsules, a plastic fountain pen nib. While the SCP Foundation does have companies which create ink capsules, there are no Foundation-brand ink capsules. \n\n//Note: It ruined my fountain pen with this. The ink was gel and clogged the pen after the second capsule. The nib was pretty nice though. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One pamphlet\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A small paper diorama of SCP-682 eating researchers. Researchers report a sense of dread when viewing it. Sense of dread determined to be non-anomalous.\n\n**Input:** Five pencil sharpeners \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One stylized revolver pencil sharpener. Sharpens pencil when pencil is inserted into the barrel and the cylinder is spun. \n\n//Note: Neat. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** Deck of playing cards\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One paper stage with a figure resembling Intern Lacte standing on a podium. Failure Show is emblazoned on the back of the stage. Viewing the output results in the viewer to gain knowledge regarding a random failure related to Intern Lacte and compels them to insult Intern Lacte based on that knowledge. \n\n**Addendum:** Item incinerated. While amnesticzation proved effective at removing the compulsion to insult Intern Lacte, the knowledge remained.\n\n//Note: Sorry for my outburst, Lacte. We all make mistakes from time to time. Next time, you should probably ask before just taking multiple bags of supplies. - Dr. Shep//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-2013**\n**Name:** Prof. Fuselo\n**Date:** 01/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One faux taxidermy buck head, one faux taxidermy elk head, one faux taxidermy goat\n\n//Note: The taxidermy models used do not contain biological elements. - Prof. Fuselo//\n\n**Input:** One taxidermy buck head\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Full body taxidermy of a large frog, with faux deer fur and glass deer eyes. The legs and arms are made of keratin from the antlers.\n\n//Note: I'm incinerating this so that I don't have to look at it anymore. - Prof. Fuselo//\n\n**Input:** One taxidermy elk head\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One taxidermied, smiling human head with ivory teeth and glass elk eyes. The beard from the elk is retained, while extra cloth, stuffing, and faux fur are fashioned to resemble hair.\n\n**Input:** One taxidermy goat\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One bipedal taxidermy goat with an uncanny, human-like face. It stands still, but can be seen breathing and slightly swaying as if alive and idle, despite no lungs or vital signs.\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-2014**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 01/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One winter parka, one pair of snow pants, one pair of cotton winter earmuffs\n\n//Note: Decided to test these because this place seems a lot warmer than where I'm from, so it seems like they probably won't be needed. Also, I needed the space in my wardrobe. I'm putting them all on Fine, just to see what happens! - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One pair of snow pants\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of what appear to be rain pants, 2 sizes larger than before. The output is extremely hydrophobic, to the point of repelling water within 10 cm of the pants. Due to the fact that this includes water within the body, they cannot be worn.\n\n**Input:** One winter parka\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged winter parka. When worn, it anomalously raises the wearer's body temperature to an extreme fever of 41¬∞C. This fever does not go down for 105.8 minutes. \n\n//Note: Well, I guess I know what my job is gonna be after these tests. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One pair of cotton winter earmuffs\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of cotton industrial earmuffs. When worn, they render the wearer temporarily completely deaf. However, ear damage can still be accumulated while worn, and as the earpads are made primarily of cotton, they are effectively useless. \n\n//Note: Wow, these are literally all useless. I mean, I expected at least something that could be used, but I guess I have a lot to learn from this thing. Also, those pink industrial earmuffs looked kinda funny. I'd keep them if they weren't anomalous. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: They aren't useless if you're creative with how to utilize it. - Dr. Shep//\n\n//Note: And why would I want to instantly give someone a possibly lethal fever? I can't think of a reason for that. Actually, no, maybe those earmuffs could be useful for anyone dealing with Veritas? - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: Fever kills some viral infections. Prior to vaccines for syphilis, people would infect themselves with fever-inducing diseases to fight against syphilis. - Dr. Shep//\n\n//Note: Yes, I know. I'm becoming a doctor of medicine. However, 41¬∞C is just extremely dangerous. Also, we have medicine for that now. I seriously hope your doctorate isn't in a medical field. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: R. Ibarazaki, we will talk about how to pack when moving in the future. - Dr. Query//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2015**\n**Name:** Prof. Fuselo\n**Date:** 02/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One poster displaying silhouettes of various amphibians\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Six Rorschach inkblot test cards in a stack. Despite being inkblots, they clearly depict a recognizable animal on each card. In order: Tree frog, mountain lion, rhinoceros, gazelle, maned wolf, and flamingo.\n\n//Note: I'm going to show these to others and ask what they see on the cards. - Prof. Fuselo//\n\n**Addendum**: Each card depicts a different animal per person. Despite being very clear to each person, each person sees a very different animal.\n\n//Note: The tree frog I saw on the first card was seen as an African lion by D-927. Even when looking at the card simultaneously, I saw a tree frog and she saw an African lion. - Prof. Fuselo//\n\n**Addendum 2**: Further testing reveals that the cards depict cognitive assumptions of what an animal is to someone, such as whether it would be their favorite animal (Maned Wolf for Prof. Fuselo.). Each card seems to be a different aspect. The first card is the last animal the subject thought about before viewing the card. This is why the first card was a tree frog for Prof. Fuselo, as the item inserted was an amphibians chart. Card two always shows an animal the subject fears. Card three depicts an animal that the subject empathizes with. Subjects with psychopathy reported the image just being an inksplatter. Card four always shows a prey animal that the subject views as strong. Card five depicts the subject's favorite animal, even if the subject didn't know they had one. Card six always shows an animal that the subject has never seen in person, but has seen in videos, books, pictures, etc.\n\n//Note: The gazelle is able to outrun most predators with ease. You might ask \"What about zebras? They kill their predators,\" to which I say, zebras can't handle being overwhelmed, while a gazelle can flee for miles. - Prof. Fuselo//\n\n//Note: All of these are octopi to me. That's... fun. - Dr. Query//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-2016**\n**Name:** Dr. Shep\n**Date:** 02/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One horseshoe\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One four-leaf clover, made of iron. Each clove is a small horseshoe.\n\n//Note: Upon picking it up, a security personnel's firearm discharged and the bullet barely grazed D-3723. Damn lucky that didn't hit him. - Dr. Shep//\n\n**Addendum**: The output causes unfortunate and potentially dangerous events while protecting the holder from the events it causes, including spontaneous exploding of ceramic mugs, a higher case of minor accidents related to tripping hazards, and one case of negligent discharge of a weapon. The effect ceased after physical contact. \n\n//Note: Luck can't be made. Good to know. - Dr. Query//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-2017**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 02/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Six steel Foundation-issued 1L water bottles\n\n//Note: Time for my first Very Fine test! Wanted to start out with something relatively harmless, mainly to make my job easier and make sure nobody gets hurt. And while I'm writing, I'd like to remind everyone that these are free, and you should really pick one up. It's very important to stay hydrated! - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** Two water bottles\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One large 2 litre canteen. Resembles models issued by the GOC.\n\n**Input:** Two water bottles\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One waterskin made of steel, with the texture of leather. Holds 3 litres of water, due to having thinner walls than the water bottles, and has Foundation markings.\n\n//Note: Huh. Could I keep this? After screening, of course! - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One water bottle\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** One 1L water bottle. It has a temperature dial that makes any water held within the water bottle the temperature the dial was set at. However, the dial ranges from 0K-1000K, and due to the small size of the dial, practical use has been deemed impossible.\n\n**Input:** One water bottle\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A visually similar water bottle. However, it contains a small pocket dimension that has a currently unknown volume. Whenever any item is inserted into the bottle, it immediately takes a liquid form, regardless of the previous material's composition. Tests are being undertaken to ascertain whether any of these liquids can be analysed, but as any testing implements inserted become liquid, this seems unlikely. Turning the bottle upside-down also does not drain the bottle of liquids, and as such the only potential way to access the liquids within would be to fill the bottle to capacity. \n\n//Note: What? How does that work? I feel like that has to break the laws of science somehow. - R. Ibarazaki// \n\n//Note: So far, around 2000 liters of liquid have been added to the bottle and its capacity has yet to be found. Due to the volume of content inside, incineration is not recommended. - Researcher Boneka//\n\n//Note: Bottle has been transferred to the Anomalous Abatement department, to investigate further applications in recycling. Good job Ibarazaki. - Dr. Query//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-2018**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 03/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Small wax figurines of various Facility-23 personnel, as well as SCP-914\n\n//Note: I like to make these in my spare time, so if anyone wants a wax figure for a test, or just one for themselves, just ask nicely! - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One wax figurine of SCP-914\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One wax figurine of Senior Researcher Dr. Gears.\n\n**Input:** One wax figurine of R. Ibarazaki, running in exercise wear.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two wax models of Japanese kyogashi candy, and one small model of a blade prosthetic. The kyogashi do not, however, taste like candy. \n\n//Note: Now I'm hungry and homesick. I hope the rest of these are better. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One wax figurine of Intern Lacte that appears to be being disciplined by somebody else.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** one wax tablet written in Japanese detailing Intern Lacte's trial for five counts of petty theft, appearing to be related to the previous mistaken taking of the items of other interns from orientation, including four computers. Notably, the name of the prosecutor and defense attorney are Reiji Mitsurugi and Ry≈´ichi Naruhod≈ç respectively, both being characters from the //Ace Attorney// game series.\n\n**Input:** One wax figurine of Lucius Veritas, that looks to be disciplining someone.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One wax model of the UNGOC VERITAS system, an optical system used to see the life energy of an entity or person, even through solid objects or walls. Non-functional.\n\n//Note: I promise the pose has nothing to do with the previous input. I'm definitely not still mad about getting my stuff taken. - R.

Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: It evoked a feeling of sadness in me. I wondered if it was a memetic effect, but I think it's just the nature of this piece‚Äîto be modeled after a creature capable of flight, but being unable to because of one's construction; it is as if it was always meant to fly, and yet simultaneously could never.

The input was found to have been turned into hundreds of miniature automatons resembling Polish Winged Hussar Cavalry each measuring approximately 20cm tall. Each rides its own horse and they move in typical formations of a 17th century heavy cavalry group. Upon them exiting the booth, D-101383 immediately suffered multiple grievous wounds to his legs as the output attacked his ankles and brought him to his knees.\n\n**Addendum:** When Sgt. Szymons entered the room with on-site security forces, the output halted its attack and the team was able to extract D-101383. It is speculated that outputs responded to Szymons' Polish descent as a sign of seniority, as they followed him in a standard marching formation when he walked further into the testing chamber. Output successfully led to the incinerator and neutralized.\n\n//Note: D-101383 has been relieved of testing duties for two weeks to recover from his injuries. He will return after all stitches are removed. - Dr. K. Szymons//\n\n//Note: It is to note that D-101383 is of Anatolian descent, the outputs also seemed to respond \"positively\" to other central European descents. Leading them to the incinerator was like herding cats‚Ä¶ or horses. - JMTF Sergeant Szymons//\n-----\n**Test 914-2022**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Townsend\n**Date:** 02/10/2024 - 03/10/2024\n**Total Items:**  Two //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// system-enhancing adaptors in original sealed packaging, two complete sets of all seven produced games for the //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// in original sealed packaging\n\n//Note:// Camerica //and// Codemasters//, the same companies behind the production of the// Game Genie //, created the// Aladdin Deck Enhancer//. It functions by plugging into the cartridge port of an// NES //and acting as an adapter containing all of the hardware needed for// NES //compatible cartridges aside from the game ROM, allowing the user to play unlicensed games produced by// Camerica //and// Codemasters //on cheaper, compact cartridges. The companies had 24 games planned, but only seven were finished before// Camerica //became bankrupt. Neither the// Aladdin Deck Enhancer //nor its finished games were officially released, instead entering the market through inventory liquidation. - S.R. Townsend.//\n\n**Input:** One complete set of all seven produced games for the //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// in original sealed packaging\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Seven unproduced games for the //Aladdin Deck Enhancer//, in packaging matching the style of the seven released. Two of the included games, \"Mig 29 Soviet Fighter\" and //Big Nose the Caveman//, match games that were announced but remained unreleased. The other five games, //Molly's Miserable Monday//, //Treasure Quest//, //Zorkman//, //Rubble Racing Rumble//, and //The Great Pinch//, match nothing announced for the project.\n\n//They've all been tested. They match the quality level of the released games, by which I mean they are poorly made. - S.R. Townsend//\n\n**Input:** One //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// system-enhancing adaptor in original sealed packaging\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One //NES// version //Game Genie//, made from the materials of the //Aladdin Deck Enhancer//. The output is non-functional. The item has an anomalous effect allowing it to \"grant wishes\" to the person interacting with it through use of illusion. The D-Class being used to interact with the object mentioned that they \"wished they had a cold one\". The D-Class immediately perceived themselves as holding a chilled alcoholic beverage in their free hand and began to \"drink\" it. They then wished they \"could go home\", and had their perception massively altered, believing themselves transported to an old residence. When Senior Researcher Townsend removed the output from their grip, their perception returned to normal.\n\n//Note: D-8904 reacted violently to being \"brought back\" and due to an unplanned change in my own perception, I was momentarily disarmed and incapable of self-defense. The remainder of the test was derailed and had to be resumed the following day. The output has been moved to anomalous storage, pending further testing at a later date. - S.R. Townsend//\n\n**Input:** One complete set of all seven produced games for the //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// in original sealed packaging\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A single, thick cartridge in a large labeled package. The cartridge superficially matches that of a //Nintendo 64//. The packaging states that the game contained within is //Baby's Day Out//. Testing on the cartridge has proven it is compatible with the //Nintendo 64// and that the game is a functional 2D platformer wherein the player controls an angelic being.\n\n//Note: A videogame adaption of// Baby's Day Out //, a comedic movie, had been planned and completed for the// Sega Genesis //,// Super NES//, and// Gameboy //but was never released. No copies of the finished game have turned up, so I cannot conclusively say whether or not this output is a port of the same game. - S.R. Townsend//\n\n**Input:** One //Aladdin Deck Enhancer// system-enhancing adaptor in original sealed packaging\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A //Camerica// branded device that plugs into the cartridge port of an //NES// and acts as an adaptor for //Nintendo 64// cartridges, allowing them to be played through the //NES//. The graphical quality and processing speed of games played with this device are downgraded to be compatible with the //NES//. The games' structure is also significantly altered, often becoming 2D side scrollers or top-down games. When it was initially plugged into an //NES// for testing, a pair of concealed locking mechanisms extended, rendering it permanently attached to the cartridge port.\n\n//Note: This item and attached// NES //will be kept in anomalous storage. Access can be granted for research purposes if anyone on site acquires new// Nintendo 64 //cartridges, provided I can sit in for observation. - S.R. Townsend//\n\n//Note: I‚Äôm concerned for S.R. Townsend‚Äôs well-being after the events that took place at the end of that second test. He‚Äôs been acting exceptionally disoriented and has a noticeable delay when responding to inquiries. But he‚Äôs insisted that amnestics are not necessary. What did you see that unsettled you so, Townsend? - J.R. Falstaff//\n-----\n**Test 914-2023**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 03/10/2024\n**Total Items:**  Ten paper hats/boats folded from pink A4 paper\n\n//Note: These are some fairly easy origami pieces. For the sake of documentation, they will be recorded as hats when the point is pointing up, and boats when it is pointing down. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One origami hat\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Seven crumpled up balls of torn paper\n\n**Input:** One origami boat\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One pile of paper shreds, appearing to have been cut by scissors\n\n**Input:** One origami hat\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One cube of paper, one small puddle of pink ink\n\n**Input:** One origami boat\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One unfolded piece of paper\n\n**Input:** One origami hat\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One small pair of origami shoes. Due to the fact that each shoe is folded from a piece of paper half the size of A4, they are effectively unwearable.\n\n**Input:** One origami boat\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One paper plane\n\n**Input:** One origami hat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One origami top hat. Made with what appears to be a peacock feather on the brim.\n\n**Input:** One origami boat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One paper diorama of the //HMS Titanic// and a small iceberg\n\n**Input:** One origami hat\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One paper clothes mannequin wearing a paper hat. It is emblazoned with a cognitohazard that compels people to try to buy the hat off of the mannequin. However, as it is inanimate, this is not possible, and as such, the subject gives up after 5 minutes.\n\n//Note: That hat looked weirdly stylish at the time. I didn't even question that the hat was 1 inch tall. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One origami boat\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One origami model of the //HSwMS Gotland//, a Swedish attack submarine. Rolled out of the output booth and into the ground, as if it was liquid. Submarine dove below the ''surface'' before recovery was possible, and looked to be travelling at 20 knots on a intercept course with a Russian //Kilo-class// submarine currently gathering intelligence in Swedish waters. The location of the submarine was tracked via multiple sonar pings given off anomalously by the submarine. Upon reaching the Atlantic Ocean, these stopped, probably a result of the submarine dissolving due to its paper construction.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2024**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Falstaff\n**Date:** 04/10/2024 - 06/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One recreation Faberg√© egg  \n\n//Note: A link between SCP-914 and Russian goldsmith and jeweler [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/clockwork-time | Peter Carl Faberg√©]]] (1846-1920) was suggested in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-914/offset/19 | Incident report 914-2000-F2]]]. Charles Faberg√© was most famously known for his creation of the Faberg√© eggs, which have become symbols of opulence. This test attempts to garner further information towards this potential link by using a modern recreation of a Faberg√© egg, as an original Faberg√© egg would cost in the upwards of millions of USD. The expense for this test has been cleared with special permission from Director of Research Dr. Jeyne Query and Facility Director Dr. Arthur Hackett. Due to the cost of this recreation Faberg√© egg, tests will not be performed below the Very Fine setting. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** One recreation Faberg√© egg\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item was considerably longer than the usual 5-10 minutes SCP-914 normally takes to refine an input, at 43 minutes elapsed until output was received. The output was thoroughly inspected for visual differences and compared to images taken before processing (in both the recreation Faberg√© egg‚Äôs ‚Äòopen‚Äô and ‚Äòclosed‚Äô states) to discern any differences. No differences were found between the output and the input.\n\n//Note: This test will be performed once more, with the output from this test being used as the input of the next, due to the object being seemingly unchanged. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item for this test was 1 hour and 12 minutes. Output thoroughly inspected for visual differences to the original recreation Faberg√© egg. No differences found. Item also placed within on-site x-ray and ultrasound machines to get a non-destructive look at the internals of the output. All mechanisms inside the Faberg√© egg are in line with the expected internals of the original input.\n\n//Note: Test will be repeated once more. - J.R. Falstaff//  \n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item for this test was 1 hour and 43 minutes. Output was thoroughly inspected through visual means, via x-ray, and ultrasound.  \n\n//Note: A trend seems to be forming in which SCP-914 is taking longer to process. However, no changes have been spotted, so why is it taking so long to refine? Test will be repeated. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item for this test was 2 hours and 57 minutes. No changes aside from increased time for processing.\n\n//Note: The test will be repeated again to monitor the trend in increasing processing time described in the previous test. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item for this test was 3 hours and 34 minutes. No changes aside from increased time for processing.\n\n//Note: The rate of change in time elapsed processing does not appear to be constant. Further investigation is required. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n//Note: Are you sure this is a good idea? It seems to be building up to something rather ominous. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg. The time spent processing this item for this test was 5 hours and 21 minutes. No changes aside from increased time for processing.\n\n//Note: Test will be repeated. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Almost immediately upon turning the key on SCP-914 to process the item, the output door opened to show an unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg.\n\n//Note: Why the change in elapsed time for processing, even though the object is still unchanged? To further investigate, the test will be repeated. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Upon turning SCP-914's key to begin processing, the output door slammed open, revealing an unchanged recreation Faberg√© egg.\n\n//Note: Why this change in the status quo? No changes have been made to the output throughout this test. This is not in line with the behavior observed by SCP-914 in the past; almost always, the output has been noticeably different from the input, especially when SCP-914 is set to Very Fine (a notable exception being made for [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-914/offset/17 | Test 914-1893]]]). Just what is going on? Test will be repeated once more. - J.R. Falstaff//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** --Very Fine-- Unknown\n**Output:** One minute into processing, the gears on SCP-914 stopped moving abruptly. The dial on SCP-914 turned counterclockwise away from Very Fine over the other settings to Rough, and then past the Rough setting. SCP-914's gears then began turning once more. Time elapsed processing was exactly 5 minutes, during which loud rattling noises could be heard emanating from SCP-914. After the output door opened, the input was found to have become a pulverized pile of the same mass as the original input.\n\n//Note: SCP-914's settings knob cannot normally be turned past Rough. Input was dropped before being placed into SCP-914 by participating D-Class personnel. My only explanation for the behavior of SCP-914 is that the input was physically damaged by the impact. But why would SCP-914 react like this? This test will not be continued as I do not have another $60,000 in my testing budget for a second recreation Faberg√© egg, and I see no point in refining what has essentially become very expensive dust. - J.R. Falstaff//    \n\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2025**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 07/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Five last generation standard anomalous object storage lockers\n\n//Note: Apparently the maintenance guys were replacing all the outdated storage lockers for 914's outputs, so I asked if I could have five of them to test. Apparently the new ones are with card scanners that can be connected to the clearance level database automatically? Anyways, I don't actually know what to expect from this, so here goes. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One storage locker\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One pile of slag\n\n**Input:** One storage locker\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One storage locker that shows signs of being forced open. Booby trapped in a way that made spikes fall out when opened, but these caused no harm to any personnel, and no other difficulties were encountered.\n\n**Input:** One storage locker\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One gym locker.\n\n**Input:** One storage locker\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One storage locker that automatically assigns a clearance level required to open when an object is placed within, with important outputs being prioritised. It also automatically opens when a person of sufficient clearance attempts to open it. However, SCP-914's idea of sufficient clearance is different from the Foundation's, with certain people being favoured over others. For example, D-Class personnel are automatically given level-4 clearance, Site Director Hackett, Research Director Query and Human Resources Director Veritas have level-2 clearance, Intern Lacte and R. Ibarazaki have level-3 clearance, all standard researchers have level-1 clearance, and solely Maintenance Technician Johnson was found to possess level-5 clearance. It is assumed that O5 council members would have level-0 clearance.\n\n**Input:** One storage locker\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged storage locker. Whenever any items are placed within, they appear to fall into a pocket dimension. Laser rangefinding has found a depth of three kilometres, but visual estimates show around 300 metres, leading to the belief that the speed of light is ten times slower within. Any anomalous objects of a mass below ~3.3 kilograms placed within lose their anomalous properties, while any of above that switch it for a seemingly random anomalous property, and any non-anomalous objects placed within gain an anomalous ability.\n\n//Note: What is it with me and weird pocket dimensions? Anyway, testing was discontinued after 24 minutes after one of the testing implements became an extremely heavy emitter of beta radiation. So again, this thing is rather useless. Also, the emitter was apparently thrown into the box after that, so we should probably keep it closed. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2026**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 09/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Four commercially available paper shredders\n\n**Input:** One paper shredder\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** The remains of a paper shredder. Appears to have been shredded by a paper shredder.\n\n**Input:** One paper shredder\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One large blender\n\n**Input:** One paper shredder\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One ‚Äú914-Brand Paper Atomiser,‚Äù made with various clockwork elements. When used, it releases the atoms of the paper destroyed into the surrounding air. As such, use is not recommended, to prevent lung damage.\n\n**Input:** One paper shredder\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One paper shredder. Does not need an external power source. Shredder anomalously is able to destroy anything thin enough to be placed into the shredder slot, and then combusts all flammable items within. The energy gained from doing so appears to power the paper shredder, with excess energy being deposited into the surrounding area. All remains that cannot be burnt further are then teleported to --an unknown location-- Research Director Jeyne Query‚Äôs desk.\n\n//Note: Oh no. I'm getting my testing license revoked, aren't I? - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n//Note: No, but Dr. Veritas did let me know that it's standard procedure to deduct any damages from the salary of the causer.

License is made out of the plastic case of the USB, with lettering done in circuitry and decorative emblems in green circuit board.\n\n//Note: Can I use this as a real license? - JR Tempest//\n\n//Note: I need you to think about that question, maybe say it out loud to yourself. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** One USB drive\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One USB drive. Game files replaced with a text file titled \"914's Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets.\" When read by D-62137, subject requested access to a stock trading terminal. When refused, subject started screaming about how ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà was going to take a 40 point dive and wished to quickly short the stock. A simulated trading environment was set up and provided to the subject. Of note, ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà dropped 40 points 3 hours following the experiment.

The ticking of the watch is noticeably louder and has an added echo. The watch‚Äôs crown appears to have been separated into 3 smaller, identical versions of itself. D-43762 was observed to move at an abnormal speed after pulling out the top crown, and a far slower speed after pulling the middle crown. Subsequently, D-43762 reported that pulling the top crown caused them to perceive the world at a far faster pace, whilst pulling the middle crown caused them to perceive the world at a much slower pace. After D-43762 was instructed to pull out the lowest watch crown, all of D-43762‚Äôs movement ceased immediately. Attempts at gaining D-43762‚Äôs attention were completely unsuccessful. D-43762's entire body, including extremities such as his hair, was completely immovable, and a medical examination revealed that his vitals were frozen.\n\n**Addendum:** Attempts to push the crown back in were made, but proved to be futile. Whether or not this is due to the anomalous effect having an impact on the output itself, or D-43762's unmalleable grip on the crown is unknown. After a 24-hour examination period without any changes, D-43762 was deemed braindead. Output and D-43762 have been incinerated.\n\n//Note: Carpenter, you and I are going to have a talk about resource management. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2029**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 12/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Five mathematical equations on A4 paper, five pens\n\n**Input:** The equation [[$ 5x‚àí2(3‚àíx)=4 $]] on A4 paper, one pen\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** The equation [[$ 3+7=37 $]] on a piece of shredded A4 paper\n\n**Input:** The equation [[$ 4(2x‚àí3)=24 $]] on A4 paper, one pen\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** All the numbers and symbols arranged in order from greatest to least each on one paper scrap, one disassembled pen.\n\n**Input:** The equation [[$ 3x+7=22 $]] on A4 paper, one pen\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The answer, [[$ x=5 $]], on A5 paper.

Arranging the sigils vertically appears to produce effects relative to their order, including blinding light and a shockwave that lightly pushes everything away within 5m. \n\n//Note: Unless you all want to test the waters and end up potentially exploding, stop playing with the damn tiles. We don‚Äôt know how powerful they are, or if adding other sigils will change the effects. - R. Xasthur//\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned tablets\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Addendum:** The final tablet post-output displayed infohazardous material that immediately removes all footage from, and forces all witnesses to display hostile behaviour towards surveillance equipment of any kind. Cameras observing SCP-914 were inactive during the output‚Äôs effect, up until its incineration. All effects ceased and D-Class involved in testing displayed no knowledge of their actions or behavior.\n-----\n**Test 914-2031**\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 15/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One plastic broom, two sponges, one duster, one vacuum cleaner, one pack of disinfectant wipes, one empty trash bag.\n\n**Input:** One plastic broom\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One mop. Due to the materials used, it is unable to retain water.\n\n**Input:** One duster\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One un-duster. When used, applied thick layers of dust to the surface it was used on. Said dust was pulled from the material of the wall itself.\n\n**Input:** Two sponges \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One large sponge that shows a map of the location of all [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1459-j X-Sponge] colonies within around 150 kilometres of the island of Carloforte, Sardinia, Italy via deep depressions in the sponge. The map is static and does not react to any changes in real time.\n\n**Input:** One vacuum cleaner\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged vacuum cleaner. When used, it opens a gateway to the L3 Lagrange point, teleporting all dust to space. However, this also means all air within the room is rapidly removed.\n\n**Input:** One pack of disinfectant wipes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One cloud of dense gas, one pack of dried out wipes. Gas presumably killed any microbial life it came into contact with, and D-3238, who inhaled gas accidentally, complained experience pain and coughing fits. Dissipated within three minutes.\n\n**Input:** One empty trash bag\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged trash bag, tied closed. When anything is placed within it, and the bag closed, it decays at an extreme speed (Approximately two minutes for one kilogram of lead) into elemental hydrogen. The energy produced by this process remains in the bag, as does the heat, however this heat can escape while the bag is open. The bag is normally stable, but when opened, air can enter, mixing with the heated hydrogen and causing a small explosion if proper precautionary measures are not taken. Effect ceased after two hours of testing.\n\n//I‚Äôm pretty glad I was careful about not putting a kilogram of lead in first, that could have been pretty disastrous for the D-Class. He‚Äôs mostly fine, by the way, just gonna be a week in medical to deal with the burns. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2032**\n\n**Name:** Intern Lacte\n**Date:** 16/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One blank Gregorian calendar, one candle, one blank 200-paged book, one wine glass, one deck of playing cards, one lit oil lantern and one bottle of ink\n\n//Note: These are things no longer hip for the fall aesthetic. I have tripled-checked to make sure none of these things are stolen. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One calendar \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One paper clock. One full rotation of the clock's hour hand requires 30 hours. Object was entirely non-anomalous and functioned on an intricate system of paper gears and folds. Object was rendered non-functional upon disassembly.  \n\n**Input:** One candle\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One candle with several patterns engraved into it. After being lit, the melted wax formed a gear. \n\n**Input:** One blank 200-paged book, one bottle of ink\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A set of several origami figures, consisting of seventeen dragons, fourteen knights, three wizards and a single tower. Figures were detailed intricately with the provided ink. Figures animate slightly, often in dragon's wings beating and wizards waving their staff. \n\n**Input:** One deck of playing cards\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of glasses made from playing cards, twelve glasses lenses made from paper. Wearing the glasses with the lenses inserted allows the wearer to predict future card draws and causes a hallucinatory effect to occur, leading the wearer to believe they are in a location similar to Wonderland and causing the wearer to believe they are dreaming. \n\n//Note: You cannot cheat with these glasses. We tried and the D-Class upended the table, apparently in an effort to escape a giant fish with wings. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One lantern, lit\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** One //Coca-Cola// style glass bottle, sealed with a bottle cap made from metal and filled with CO2 and one bottle opener. Both objects are covered with oil contained in the lamp. Upon retrieval, both objects combusted resulting in the D-91488 dropping the bottle and causing the contained CO2 to leak from the bottle. No other noted anomalous effects.   \n \n//Note: Room is giving everyone a coughing fit. It's not anomalous or hazardous other than the inherent negatives of CO2 however. I'm not qualified but if I had to guess, 914 was attempting to make a molotov. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One wine glass\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** One wine glass of slightly finer make. Liquids poured into output results in the liquid --transmuting into-- switched with Intern Lacte's blood. Effect was noticed upon testing with sterilized water. Intern Lacte's blood was only replaced with 100 milliliters of water before effects were noticed.  Intern Lacte is currently recovering from an electrolyte imbalance in the medical bay. He is expected to make a full recovery. \n\n-----\n**Test 914-2033**\n**Name:** Dr. Oloko\n**Date:** 17/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Two original copies of //Super Mario// for the NES\n\n**Input:** One original copy of //Super Mario//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** An illegal copy of //Sonic the Hedgehog// for the NES. This has been confirmed to not have ever been officially developed.\n\n**Input:** One original copy of //Super Mario//\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small toy figure of the character Mario that is identical in mass to the cartridge. The outer layer is composed of the same plastic as the cartridge shell, and when opened it reveals a mess of wires, equal in composition and mass to the original cartridge board. The figure was painted with the same ink used on the label. A small button is located on the figure‚Äôs hat and when pressed, it jumps in place and a coin-collecting sound occurs from an unknown place.\n\n**Addendum:** Shortly after the figurine was activated, its ink changed to a mix of red of white and it began expelling fire at any personnel in the vicinity via unknown means. Security quickly destroyed the figurine and only minimal burns were inflicted on personnel.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2034**\n\n**Name:** Researcher Meyer\n**Date:** 18/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Three small-sized forklifts (Mariotti Mini Series, Model MINI 4)\n\n**Input:** One forklift\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:**  One forklift that had its prongs replaced with a shallow, elliptical bowl. Otherwise operates as a regular forklift would.\n\n**Input:** Output of the previous test\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One forklift that had its prongs replaced with a lifelike depiction of a swine made of steel. Significant mass has been removed from the rest of the forklift, and any attempt to raise the mast causes the forklift to tip over.\n\n**Input:** One forklift\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:**  One forklift that had its wheels replaced with prongs, and its prongs replaced by a pair of wheels. Attempts to drive result in the prongs extending downwards, raising the forklift upwards. Attempts to raise the mast causes the mounted wheels to turn, spinning the forklift in place (assuming it isn't currently suspended in the air). \n\n**Input:** One forklift\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:**  One rectangular plate composed mainly of steel, plastic and rubber, 180 centimeters wide and 100 centimeters long. The plate is etched with writing describing it as a ‚ÄúProof of Forklift Certification‚Äù, and as having been granted to Researcher Meyer. In the place designated for a signature, a series of cogs are etched onto the plate. Direct observation of the plate temporarily induces a feeling of admiration and respect towards Researcher Meyer, although the effect is inhibited when viewed through a transparent material. \n\n-----\n**Test 914-2035**\n**Name:** Researcher Olivia Xasthur\n**Date:** 25/10/2024\n**Total Items:** Six wooden effigies of the Celtic goddess ‚ÄúMorr√≠gan‚Äù\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A small pile of wooden splinters and wood dust\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A crude effigy of a wolf\n\n//Note: Morr√≠gan was known to take the form of a wolf or a crow, just so everyone is aware. If anyone wants a full lesson on it, just ask. I‚Äôll have something about the Celtic gods lying around. - Xasthur//\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** An effigy of Dian C√©cht, a Celtic god of healing\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An identical effigy. Its anomalous purposes were found accidentally, as the output disappeared from its position when the D-Class involved with testing turned away from it. The output would reappear where the room was darkest, even if the difference were only a few lumens. Once it had found a suitable position, the output could be heard growling in an aggressive manner, occasionally speaking in the Irish tongue. A full translation is pending, though initial analysis confirmed the output referring to the Battles of Clontarf and Sulcoit.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden doll and pin. Despite the constructive material, the output is remarkably soft and pliable, akin to fabric. Holding the pin results in the doll taking on the actions, and vice versa, of the subject. When a guard was handed the pin and ordered to do a full safety check of his firearm, the doll performed the same movements bar the actual firearm itself. When the doll‚Äôs arm was moved into an upright position, the guard‚Äôs arm was locked in place at the same angle until the pin was given to another person, on which the next subject‚Äôs arm was immediately also locked in place. This effect continued until the doll‚Äôs arm was returned to its resting position. Both the doll and the pin were incinerated at once to further prevent a potential voodoo doll scenario.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned effigies\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An identical effigy. Upon being handled, the effigy produces an intense shriek exceeding 120dB. The maximum measurement of the shriek‚Äôs volume is unknown at the time of writing. The D-Class that handled the output was treated for hearing damage following initial contact. 83 hours later, the same D-Class was found dead in their cell with no known cause, even following autopsy. Testing with another D-Class resulted in a similar conclusion following only 17 hours. Further testing was suspended and output incinerated.\n\n//Note: While I wait for my ears to stop ringing, the fact it took the effigy and turned it into a banshee is rather interesting. Both Morr√≠gan and the banshee are Irish in origin, and are related in their mythos. If anyone else is experiencing some hearing issues, sorry and go see the medbay. - Xasthur//\n\n//That includes you, Xasthur. I checked your records and you're long overdue for an appointment, anyways. The doctor should see you tomorrow. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2036**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Townsend \n**Date:** 27/10/2024 \n**Total Items:** Two pumpkin decorations composed of plastic, one \"life-sized\" skeleton decoration composed of plastic \n\n**Input:** Plastic pumpkin decoration \n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** A pumpkin-shaped bowl of plastic candy. \n\n//Note: 914 was putting the \"trick\" in \"trick-or-treat,\" I suppose. The plastic candy is visually indistinguishable from genuine chocolate candy corn; the farce was discovered only upon closer inspection. - Senior Researcher Daniel Townsend//\n\n**Input:** Plastic pumpkin decoration \n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** A plastic Jack-o-lantern. The output will animate randomly through anomalous means, altering its expression, telling a Halloween-themed joke, or emitting a high-pitched cackle. Five jokes and three expressions have occurred many times, with no other variations encountered thus far.\n\n**Input:** Plastic skeleton decoration \n**Setting:** Very Fine \n**Output:** The same plastic skeleton decoration. When viewed with the naked eye, anomalous phenomena cause the skeleton to take on the illusory appearance of a desiccated human corpse dressed in a Foundation security uniform. Research has shown that this effect does not activate when viewed upon digital or analog video recording. \n\n//Note: What a delightful scare to begin the week of Halloween with. No further research is required, so I am requesting that we expedite the incineration of this output to the next possible burn day of 3/11 to avoid any further incidents involving it. - Senior Researcher Townsend//\n\n//Note: The incineration of output 2036-3 was planned at 6:20 and is confirmed to have been carried out at 6:25 by Senior Containment Specialist MacLean and Dr. Marlon. I'd like to know why I witnessed somebody traipsing through the halls with a corpse at 7:15. - Aeronautical Researcher Allen//\n\n//Note: After mobilization of onsite security, several hours of sweeps of the site, and interviews of involved personnel, it has been determined that the discrepancy was caused by Aeronautical Researcher Allen neglecting to set their watch to account for daylight savings. I have reprimanded Aeronautical Researcher Allen appropriately. - Security Chief Sedna//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-2037**\n**Name:** Researcher Joseph Carpenter\n**Date:** 28/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One copy of Researcher Carpenter‚Äôs foundation ID card\n\n**Input**: Aforementioned ID card\n**Setting**: Fine\n**Output**: One minutely smaller visually unchanged ID card, with the addition of a small button in the bottom right corner. Pressing the button visually changes the ID card to match a total of 9 other different organizations and agencies, both real and fictional. The button will make these changes in no particular order. Researcher Carpenter‚Äôs ID information is retained throughout each iteration. The only changes to said information are his position/title as well as the details of his photo. These details consist of his overall appearance, clothes, and demeanor.
