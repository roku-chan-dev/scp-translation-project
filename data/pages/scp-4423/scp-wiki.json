Meanwhile, all such events are to be attributed to a unique form of sleep paralysis.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4423 is a Tartarean-Class demonic entity that manifests during sleep paralysis. Although its appearance varies across manifestations, its voice remains the same (with speech patterns matching that of a middle-aged male).\n\nDuring an SCP-4423 event, SCP-4423 will enter the victim's room and speak to them as if they were a young child. This conversation will inevitably turn to the topic of the victim's father. When the victim exits sleep paralysis, SCP-4423 will leave the room and demanifest. \n\nDue to the lack of reported incidents (with only fifteen confirmed cases since 1997), the frequency of SCP-4423 events is currently unknown. While the extent of SCP-4423's interactions with the victims varies greatly, many seek psychiatric help following an incident.\n\n\n**Interview Log:** In order to obtain an interview, Researcher Jack Patricks volunteered to be subjected to an experimental drug capable of inducing sleep paralysis. By using a prototype neural interface capable of translating thoughts into synthetic speech and a camera system mounted in his room, an interview was conducted after 77 consecutive days of testing.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Interview Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 14/10/2015 \n\n**Subject:** SCP-4423\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Camera set within Researcher Patrick's room shows the Researcher, a bed, as well as several posters on the wall.//\n\n**[6 hours removed for brevity.]**\n\n//The sound of a door opening is heard, followed by footsteps. SCP-4423 appears in the frame and sits at the end of Researcher Patricks' bed and crosses its hands in its lap. After observing Researcher Patricks for a period of 3 minutes, SCP-4423 touches his ankle and shakes it until Patricks opens his eyes.// \n\n**SCP-4423:** Hey kiddo. Sorry to wake you up, but I need to talk to you.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Hello.}}\n\n//SCP-4423 jumps slightly.//\n\n**SCP-4423:** Oh wow! You frightened me. Another one of your crazy toys, huh?\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{I. Am. ... Foundation.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Yes. Foundation. That's what I want to talk to you about. \n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{You. Know.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** I know a lot of things. There's a good deal of wisdom in this old horned head of mine. [ //Tugs on one of its horns// ] Relationships? They gotta have a strong foundation.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** And I wanna get to know you, buddy. A little us time, you know?\n\n**Researcher Patricks:** {{Why.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Well... uh... [ //Coughs// ]\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Questions.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Saved me there. Alright, I'll answer some of your questions while I try to think up how to say it.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{How. You. Move.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** You know that. My old jalopy. I musta driven you to school three dozen times by now.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Where. You. From.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Here. Went to the same high school as you, remember? Showed you my old yearbooks.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{No. Really.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Yeah really. Okay. I think I've got it now. Your dad and I? Well, we've been seeing each other for a little while. I know, I know, we've been friends for, well, ever.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{William.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Yes, Bill. And when I say \"seeing each other\", I mean dating. \n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** I, uh, figured you mighta caught on but I wanted to talk about this with you, sport.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Look, I love your father. He completes me in ways I didn't even know I needed. [ //Pause// ] After puberty is over, it'll make more sense.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Sexual. Relations.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Hey, who told you about that? Didn't think Bill gave you the talk yet. But, yes. Sexually too.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Oh. Kay.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** I don't want to just jump into your life like a stranger. I'm not a housewrecker. I wanna be part of your life, in a mutually positive relationship. So we need a good foundation.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{How.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** I know your parents went through a pretty nasty divorce a little while ago. And that you haven't seen your mom in a while. I don't want to replace her. I never could. \n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Explain.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** I want to ask your permission.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{For. What.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Jack... I want to marry your dad. If you're okay with it, I'd be honored to be your stepdad.\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Step. Dad.}}\n\n**SCP-4423:** Yes, your stepdad. Just say yes and I'll propose tomorrow. \n\n//SCP-4423 covers its mouth with its hands and giggles//\n\n**SCP-4423:** I can just see him, all dressed up in a tight little tux. You can be the ring bearer, little buddy. So, what do you say?\n\n**Researcher Patricks:**  {{Yes.}}\n\n//SCP-4423 grabs Researcher Patricks, pulls him into a hug, and kisses his forehead. SCP-4423 laughs, tucks Patricks back into bed, and then exits the room.//\n\n**SCP-4423:** Ah! You said yes!\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:**  Following extensive interviews, Foundation researchers concluded that while he had passed through Las Vegas on [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4661 15/1/1992], Researcher Patricks' father has not engaged in sexual intercourse with any Tartarean-Class demonic entities[[footnote]]As of December 4th, 2015[[/footnote]].\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum:** Ten months after the interview, a photograph depicting SCP-4423, William Patricks, and Researcher Jack Patricks in formal attire inside of a church was discovered underneath Researcher Patricks' bed. The picture showed Researcher Patricks as he appeared when he was twelve and Patricks recognized the church as the one he attended as a child in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. \n\nMobile Task Force Upsilon-11 was dispatched to the church and found a wedding announcement in the records for one William Patricks and an unnamed second person, dated 14/8/1999. No members of the clergy recall conducting or witnessing the wedding and Researcher Patricks has no memory of this event taking place. \n\n**Addendum:** On 30/8/2019, Researcher Patricks received a postcard (postmarked 14/8/2019 in Oranjestad, Aruba) from his father. \n\n> Hey Jack!\n> \n> Sorry that I didn't give you any notice, but your stepdad and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in the Islands. Can't believe it's been twenty years already. Maybe you can join us next year, if you can get away from that job.\n>\n> Love, Dad\n> \n> P.S. If you get a chance, can you check on Misty? That cat sure misses you and I don't want Mrs. Arnsdale overfeeding her again.\n\nCompiled surveillance logs from the city of Oranjestad show William Patricks and SCP-4423 checking into a hotel and participating in other activities standard for vacationing couples. The current whereabouts of William Patricks remains unknown.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4422]]] | SCP-4423 | [[[SCP-4424]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
