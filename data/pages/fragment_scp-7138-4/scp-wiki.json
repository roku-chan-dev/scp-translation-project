Instead, field agents will infiltrate institutions related to the visual arts, such as colleges of art, museums, and art cooperatives. These agents will then attempt to discourage the use of SCP-7138 in visual art.##\n\n##green|Additionally, MTF Theta-57 (\"The Critters\") are to integrate themselves into society under the cover of professional art critics. If an artist or group of artists begins to use too much SCP-7138 in their art, MTF Theta-57 will be deployed to utilize their status as respected members of the art community to pressure the artist or artists into stopping.##\n\n##green|If an artist continues to utilize SCP-7138 in their work after the deployment of MTF Theta-57, then the artist is to be taken into custody, amnestized, and relocated. ##\n\n##green|If a person experiences SCP-7138’s anomalous effects, they are to be taken into Foundation custody for further study.##\n\n##green|Due to the events caused by research into SCP-7138[[footnote]]See Incident 7138-1[[/footnote]], all investigations into its nature are suspended until further notice. The cause of SCP-7138's anomalous effects is to be removed from all relevant documentation. All personnel reading this file or assigned to SCP-7138 must also read Notice-7138-1, included below.##\n\n**Description:** ##green|SCP-7138 is a collection of electromagnetic wavelengths visible to the human eye. These wavelengths manifest to humans as the color magenta. Using hexadecimal color representation, SCP-7138 has a value at or near #FF00FF.##\n\n##green|The cause of SCP-7138's anomalous effects has been excluded from this document as per special containment procedures.##\n\n**Discovery:** ##green|SCP-7138 was discovered during research carried out by Subject 7138-E – formerly known as Dr. Montgomery – on a painting that had led several members of AWCY? to experience SCP-7138’s anomalous effects.##\n\n##green|The painting has been destroyed.##\n\n**Supplementary Documents:**\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Administrative Notices \" hide=\"- Close Notices\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Notice 7138-1:**\n\nHello,\n\nYes. SCP-7138 is a color. [[[SCP-6996|It’s not the only one]]], and no, we don’t know if there are more we haven’t discovered.\n\nYou might be wondering when you'll be told how SCP-7138's effects are triggered.\n\nYou won't be.\n\nIf you think you've figured it out, report to the dispensary for a dose of amnestics.\n\nAnyone who is found to be investigating SCP-7138's cause or who refuses amnestics after discovering the cause of SCP-7138 will be amnestized and reassigned immediately.\n\nDon't think too hard about it. Just keep going.\n\nSincerely,\nCarl Blanden,\nDirector of Site ██\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Notice 7138-2**\nCarl Blanden has been removed from duty due to complications arising from SCP-7138. As of today, Carl Blanden has been re-designated as Subject 7138-F.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\nNo further revisions are available at this time\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
