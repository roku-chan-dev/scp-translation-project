The peculiar cognitive //macroflaws// of //Homo sapiens sapiens//, neurological heuristics crafted through evolutionary development, have long been exploited, from confidence artists to performance entertainers to politicians [Laurens, 1993], including confirmation bias and the bandwagon effect, which the reader may already be aware of. Only until recently has modern science been capable of categorising and systematising the //microflaws// of human neurology, which exist on a more basal, implementational level [Laurens, 1994; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973]. So why exactly are //memetes// (exploitable cognito-efficacious environmental stimuli) most commonly found within the written and spoken word? Why not perhaps visual stimuli? Or olfactory stimuli? Or non-speech aural stimuli?\n\nDuring the course of our investigations, we have been able to propose only tentative possibilities as to the unusual statistical distribution of currently-known memetes. \n\nPerhaps it is a bias within the investigation of possible memetic agents - afterall, it is easier to find twelve sounds which produce a cognito-effect once concatenated, rather than to find fifty thousand sine waves or sixteen million colours or a precise arrangement of molecules which produce a similar effect [Reedy, 1989]. Typically, the discovery of a memetic agent is commonly made through generating random word-lists, exposing them to test subjects, observing cognitive effects, and optimising on the basis of morphemic characteristics [Włonsky, 1991] [Reedy 1992].\n\nHowever, a more intriguing possibility is that the effectiveness of a //logograph-type// memetic agent is due to the construction of the human mind itself. Consider the relative recentness of civilization as modern anthropologists have come to understand it - systems of writing were invented at least eight thousand years ago [Tyrelson, 1975], while the facility for speech and communication was likely developed hundreds of thousands of years ago [Tokigaishii, 1997]. It therefore seems that writing was grafted onto pre-existing cognitive facilities. The ability to convert printed symbols into units of meaning is not an innate ability, it is an ability specific to modern civilization, a unique ability which our minds have been honed towards [Gibson, 1975]. Therefore, it seems, as with any graft, it may not be a perfect fit, and there may be exploitable gaps. Interestingly, the frontal lobe facilitates speech, reading, and the fine motor control necessary for writing, suggesting that abstract, advanced communication as a cognitive skill seemingly unique to humans, is highly localized within a certain area, despite the immense superficial disparity [Patricks, 1993]. \n\nMany researchers [Yotta, 1997] have suggested that the nature of cognito-effective logographs may be due to specific design by the Father [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]] who engineered our minds to [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]]\n\nFrom experience, the reader will know that many words carry immediate emotional charges (connotations). For instance, \"politician\" suggests duplicity and untrustworthyness, whereas \"statesperson\" carries a functionally identical meaning while having almost exactly the opposite connotation. Likewise, \"slim\" suggests health, whereas \"thin\" suggests that the person in question is not in good health [Oppler, 1954]. We daily manipulate this tangle of meaning to suit our purposes, not only communicating as a means to transfer our states of mind, but communicating in order to influence the state of mind of another person in a way congruent to our social intentions. If we have a sufficiently advanced model of the mind of another, we can craft our language so as to trigger a particular state of mind within them [Patricks, 1983].\n\nThis immediately appears to extend the range and scope of the field of logopsychology. We are, it seems, investigating //all// environmental combinations which produce an effect in conscious minds. However, logopsychology is primarily concerned with the exploitation and analysis of written and verbal communication in order to induce a state of mind otherwise unachievable simply through manipulating traditional logographic stimuli. This is achieved through the usage of //non-word memetes//, which carry no meaning, yet seemingly inexplicably induce a powerful state of mind. For instance, subjects categorized as 1DD-G (we refer to the Appleby-Halfshott psychographic method) will generally follow most commands issued to them after hearing the command memete \"d͡ʒɛʒʲʀʔʃɛ̃æʲʒð\", while test subjects categorized as 1AC-K to 11HH-J often experience extreme drowsiness upon hearing the emotional primer \"ʐɐ̌ʰʁçʷəʏʑ\".\n\nThere are two varieties of memetes, //general memetes// and //specific memetes//. General memetes are extraordinarily rare, and are effective for (almost) all members of the human population, whereas specific memetes are plentiful and are only effective for a small psychographic subset of the human population. In all cases, general memetes are difficult to recognise, as in some sense, they exploit the parsing mechanism of the human brain and escape conscious perception. General memetes may even be morphologically obscured in written text, appearing between the boundraries of words, such as \"unpr**ohibited chur**ning\" (as a Foundation asset, the reader will likely be vaccinated against this particular g-class memete), the effects of which will often be inadvertently activated through subvocalization. This makes general memetic vaccination very helpful for researchers cataloguing memetes, as logographical cognitive agents tend to have a //carry-over effect// whereby successful conscious recognition of stimulus as a memete will result in easier recognition of similarly-constructed memetes. \n[[html]]\n<!--Memetes can furthermore be categorized as //primers// and -->\n[[/html]]\n[[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[SECTION CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY RAISA]}}[[/span]]\n\nChapter 0.1 discusses the theoretical basis of logopsychology, bringing to light recent advances in morphemic deconstruction, automatic metadeformation, and memetic derivation from Proto-Indo-European root-words.\n\nChapter 0.2 examines usage of logomemetic primers throughout history, providing context for the usage thereof. In Chapter 0.2, we critically analyse the usage of logographical cognitive agents during the Cold War, in several religious and political texts, and by [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]] to control His Grand Project [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]]. Furthermore, we show that the so-called \"universal command primer\" as conceived by Yotta, 1997 is not validated by current models. //[__Note from RAISA: this is inaccurate — current models suggest the existence of a universal command primer.__]//\n\nChapter 0.3 introduces the reader to the categorization of primers, including command primers, emotional primers, hazardous primers, and antiontological \"identity-rewrite\" primers. \n\nChapter 0.4 explains how Foundation field-operatives may construct individualized command memetes tailored to ethnographic and linguistic categories.\n\nChapter 0.5 discusses the implications of [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]] we, the chosen Children to carry out His [[span style=\"background-color:red;\"]]{{[REDACTED AS PER PROTOCOL AXNN-53]}}[[/span]] He shall return to wake us from our ten-thousand-year slumber.
