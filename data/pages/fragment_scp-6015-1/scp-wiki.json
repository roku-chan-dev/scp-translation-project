Dr. Cole Thereven sits on his chair staring at the monitor as he sips at his cup of coffee. He thinks about his time within the Foundation, how he and his wife have argued with each other due to issues, and is concerned about the future of his marriage. He then gazes to the large maple tree, guarded by soldiers, and wonders why it hasn't left the Foundation or began a spree of invading Foundation facilities. \n\nHe places his cup onto his desk and adjusts his uniform before exiting his office area and makes his way to the cafeteria to grab a snack. As he walks through the hallway, he stumbles upon his companion, Dr. Mackenzie Arlington.\n\n\"Oh hey, Cole. Where are you goin'?\" Mackenzie asked with a curious tone.\n\n\"Just stopping by to grab a snack. You?\"\n\n\"Im doing alright. Say, how are you and Sarah doing?\"\n\n\"... Eh, could be better.\"\n\n\"Not so well, is it?\"\n\n\"Yeah, no. She doesn't want to talk to me.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's okay. I promise you, it'll get better.\"\n\n\"And when will that happen?\"\n\n\"Well- I\" She pondered. \" I promise it will. Trust me.\"\n\n\"Thank- //cough-cough//\" Cole put a handkerchief to his face, and pulled it away, revealing blood.\n\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" Mackenzie looked at the handkerchief, her eyes showing disbelief.\n\n\"Yes- I'm fine. Just feeling under the weather today is all. Thank you. I'll get going now.\"\n\n\"Alright, hopefully, your relationship with Sarah gets better soon.\"\n------\nIt's 5:14 P.M., Dr. Thereven is in his car driving home from work. The clouds cover the skies with thick layers, the wind sweeps through the tips of the grass and the birds fly through the sky as arrows shot.\n\nHe arrives at his destination as he parks his car and turns it off. However, he notices something strange; the family car is gone. He fears nothing and assumes his wife took their child, Lisa out. He approaches the front door and opens it.\n\nHe is met with a dark, gloomy interior with no sign of life. He turns the lights on and unsurprisingly, nobody is there. As he tries to make sense of his observations, Cole notices a note on the counter. He picks it up and it reads—\n\n> Cole, \n>\n> I've taken Lisa to the hospital because she is sick. If I'm not here yet, you know why.\n\n—before he places it back. Just before he settles down, his phone rings. He grabs it and lifts it out of his pocket. It's his wife calling. He's curious as to why the sudden call. He answers. \n\n\"Cole?\" Sarah says in a frantic, disturbed tone.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Come by to the hospital immediately. It's urgent.\"\n\n\"On my way, I'll see you there.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, he rushes to his car and drives to the hospital.\n------\nCole has arrived in the parking lot of the hospital. He gets out of his car and phones his wife. He hears the gravel being displaced as he runs into the building.\n\n\"Sarah, where do I meet you?\"\n\n\"At the third floor, hallway 3B. You should see me there.\" \n\n\"What's with Lisa?\"\n\n\"Just... come here, okay?\"\n\nCole puts away his phone and rushes inside. From there, he makes his way up to the third floor from the elevator and towards hallway 3B. \n\nCole looks through the window and sees his daughter, lying down lifeless on the bed. The IV tubes can be seen around her, with the life support just barely clinging onto her life. He rushes into the room, where he sees his wife, sitting on a chair in the corner of the room. Cole kneels and holds his daughter's hand, which was limp, and was barely warm. \n\n\"//Wha//- what is happening?\" Cole said as he looked to his wife, across the room. \n\n\"I don't know. Earlier, she was coughing but as we went to the doctors, she ended coughing blood. Now, she's having trouble breathing and is just barely holding on.\"\n\n\"Will she make it?\"\n\n\"I... I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. Let's pray she does.\"\n\n\"Please-\" Cole begins to cry. \"Hold on darling, for me, for your mother. Hold on. You have such a big life ahead of you, please.\" Cole whispers. \n------\nThe next day, Cole arrives at work. He adjusts his glasses as he walks into Site-63 and thinks, \n\n//Everything will be fine.//\n\nHe travels across Site-63 and exits a door at the opposite end. There is a field, gated and with guards surrounding its perimeter. He walks up to a tree and speaks. \n\n\"Good afternoon, 6015. There's something I need to ask of you.\"\n\n\"**Hello, Thereven.**\" It's gravely voice came awake, welcoming Cole. \n\n\n\"Can I trade today? Can I do that a bit early?\"\n\n\"**I do not think I can-**\"\n\n\"Damnit.\" The guards around 6015 started to show visible concern, at hearing Cole speak up. \"You see, Jeremy, I need this.\"\n\n\"**Hm.. What would it be**?\"\n\n\"I need..a cure. My daughter is sick, Jeremy. The doctors don't know what the hell it is. I could not live in a world without her.\"\n\n\"**I- I cannot do that.**\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"**I cannot create something out of nothing, Thereven. This doesn't work like that. I'm- sorry.**\"\n\n\nThereven stood there, in silent contemplation. \n\n\"**I would If I had the ability, Thereven.**\"\n\n\"You better not be fucking with me, tree. I'll tear your twigs.\"\n\n\"Hey, Thereven!\" Commander Felix said in a firm tone. \"Calm down, get out.\"\n\nThereven stood there and looked up at the tree. It released spores, the wind carrying them. Thereven coughed into his elbow, and the turned around, and began to travel back. \n\n\"Lisa, Sarah. I'm sorry, girls. I failed you.\" Cole whispered to himself as sulks his way back into Site-63.\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"color: #000000; border:solid 1px #999999; background: #FFFFFF; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n//You have arrived at the final revision.

My children and I roam the earth, in search of a withered remain of humanity. \n[[=]]\n//When we look up at the stars,//\n//and we scream into the night.//\n\n//The sound echos,//\n//in the valley and on the hills.//\n\n//And there is no one there,//\n//without a doubt,//\n//and we were alone.//\n[[/=]]\n**Description:** The ones who once protected the world have perished. It is years after, and I still find myself, stranded and alone in the middle of nowhere. The earth is withered, past humanity's survival, and yet I stay. I have survived for centuries, and I am weary. I once more call upon my children in my time of need.\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6015/CH.png |caption= //My children//|width=200px|align=right]]\n@@ @@\nThe world has perished by an infection like a rose petal rotting. Would they have gone, if not for my arrival? All those years ago? Two dominant species cannot survive, without the other falling. I quite admired how the Foundation persisted, and how life festered and found its way on this rock. \n@@ @@\nSo, I survive and still exist. Even with the world being desolate and barren. Out of admiration, and guilt for those who once existed. I've found a recurring title while reading through the Foundation's records: the Administrator. There is a certain air of importance and mystery surrounding this title, so I will claim it. \n@@ @@\nWe have managed to contain and preserve many anomalies in their original cells. Many are dangerous, and a threat to the world, so I stretch my power thin, manifesting more of my children to keep the horrors at bay.\n\nMy children, who have assisted me in my journey to find life, have seemed to gain a semblance of sentience. They have seemed to grow opinions, developed personalities and they have begun to deliver messages to me. How peculiar. \n\n> \n> Hello and hi, my father, the Administrator. \n> \n> There is a giant beast in the holding cell and it keeps trying to break it. Many of us have been damaged by a giant beast. Do we have permission to kill it? It would be helpful and make our task easy. \n\nNow, I was taken aback by this. Our goal is to preserve and try to keep it how it was. My children have never been taught even remotely aggressive behaviour, no less to destroy a living thing. My newfound morals would never allow me to execute this action. I then responded. \n\n> \n> Greetings, my child. \n> \n> You have come a long way, such as to write to me, and request such a tremendous thing. On that topic, no. You cannot. My morals would never permit this to happen. If you forgot, you cannot play god, having the life of entire beings in our hands. This type of power is overwhelming, yes. But I cannot allow you to take this easy path. \n> \n\n[[=]]\n//Come my child,//\n//follow the light.//\n\n//Follow that trail,//\n//the rocky trail,//\n//And you will be fullfilled.//\n\n//Come my child,//\n//and follow me.//\n[[/=]]\n\nAfter it was delivered, I started to notice something. My children started to form two groups. I saw names, //The Good Ones//, and the //Elders//. The //Elders// has supposedly been alive longer than my other children, self-assigning titles to themself. The messages started to frequent. \n\n> \n> Hello and hi, our father, the Administrator. \n> \n>  Our sibling who has wanted the giant beast dead, has been dealt with. The request was unjust and had come out of nowhere. \n> \n> If you had chosen to kill, some amount of disaster may have been prevented, father. But that is not anything comparable to sacrificing the life of the giant beast. Life is precious like your teachings said. We respect your choice. It is great. Our siblings formed a group, to make these for you, and ease your weary soul. \n> \n> -//The Good Ones//\n\nThis, was delightful. Some were in support of my choice, and had chosen to uphold what meanings I abide by. Not In many years have I been surrounded with things I could converse with. Strange. \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nI can release my strain.
