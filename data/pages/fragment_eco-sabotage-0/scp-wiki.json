Previous conflicts have taken the form of personnel asset poaching, sabotage, and attempted hostile takeover. This conflict stems from what appears to be a difference of opinion on resource management.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"colspan=\"2\"]]\nDESCRIPTION:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nElder Foreman Robert Henegar detected a decreased productivity within Primary Production Level 1 caused by mechanical sabotage. The sabotage quickly escalated with various appropriate responses by The Factory. All conflict culminated with negotiations between The Investor and The Questioner.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"colspan=\"2\"]]\nTRIGGER:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nRoutine inspection by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar detected a decreased productivity of 13.827% within Primary Production Level 1. Further examination of the affected areas revealed that a saboteur replaced, through undetected and unknown means, various mechanical elements of essential Factory Equipment and personnel with incompatible organic matter. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nORDER OF EVENTS\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n**Actor Action**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n**Factory Response**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nThe affected areas of sabotage increases logarithmically over the course of 13 hours, 49 minutes, and 7 seconds until overall Factory productivity is reduced to 0.003%.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nElder Foreman Robert Henegar institutes an altered production schedule dependent upon handcrafting until such a time that machinery can be repaired. This production schedule returns productivity to 8.301% of previous productivity levels, an unacceptable but ameliorated level.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nIt is noted by Worker Reginald Huff that the floor of Primary Production Level 1 is no longer uniformly pitched and instead bulges hemispherically upwards towards the geographic center of the production floor. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n85.023% of personnel assets assigned to Primary Production Level 1 fail to complete assigned production tasks.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nExamination by Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley detects that multiple key components of personnel were replaced with incompatible organic matter. The continuously spreading nature of this sabotage is assessed by Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley as a Non-Acceptable Infectious Affliction.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> This isn't a typical infectious affliction that can be worked through like diphtheria or cholera; it is my opinion that it offers a non-acceptable risk to personnel assets in that it renders them inoperable and is seemingly communicable. My professional advice is to excise the infection while the body still lives.\n[[/footnote]] This assessment is approved by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAt the suggestion of Elder Foreman Robert Henegar, The Factory Board of Directors approves a controlled burn procedure by which all organic matter will be removed from Primary Production Level 1. An order for supplemental work forces is placed with Asset Procurement - Sub-level 9. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nThe presence of organic material is temporarily eradicated from Primary Production Level 1, but incompatible organic matter is subsequently detected on Distribution Sub-level 1 by Worker Elbert Rix. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nWorker Elbert Rix dutifully reports this discovery to Elder Foreman Robert Henegar despite attempts at information suppression by multiple instances of //Canis dirus guildayi//.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> They's wolves in the tunnels sir. Yessir. Wolves is in the tunnels, and Becca - Worker Becca Shortly tolds me she seen a bear in the tunnels. Yessir. A bear.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> Worker Elbert Rix was examined and treated by Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley, and was able to immediately return to assigned duties.\n[[/footnote]] It is noted that //Canis dirus guildayi// is not native to The Factory Sub-levels and is to be considered an additional instance of sabotage. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nStructural sabotage is discovered when tree roots break through the ceiling of Sub-level 1. Subsequent investigation discovers tree root presence in 78.241% of the floor of Primary Production Level 1.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nElder Foreman Robert Henegar orders the removal of all personnel assets from Primary Production Level 1 and Sub-level 1. Personnel assets are relocated to Sub-level 2 through Sub-level 4. This results in a 1.073% reduction in productivity.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nA routine patrol of Primary Production Level 1 by Security Officer Newton Thaw discovers the presence of a //Nyssa sylvatica// sapling. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nSecurity Officer Newton Thaw requests permission to remove the //Nyssa sylvatica// sapling. Permission is granted by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar. Security Officer Newton Thaw attempts removal of the sapling.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> Sir, this damned tree just ain't moving. I've tried my knife, fire, pulling it out. Nothing going.\n[[/footnote]] All communication with Security Officer Newton Thaw ceases.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> Security Officer Newton Thaw is to be considered Away Without Leave until proven otherwise. All pay allocated to Security Officer Newton Thaw is to be garnished by 100% until otherwise noted.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nDue to a lack of security personnel, Workers Elbert Rix and Reginald Huff are assigned to a search for Security Officer Newton Thaw. Worker Elbert Rix is involved in an encounter with an instance of //Mammuthus columbi//. Worker Reginald Huff returns from the search for Security Officer Newton Thaw unsuccessfully.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> In light of Worker Reginald Huff's decision to return the core components of Worker Elbert Rix to his superiors, Elder Foreman Robert Henegar has concluded that failure to find Security Officer Newton Thaw can be punished with as few as a dozen lashes.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley guarantees that Worker Elbert Rix can be expected to return to duty within the month. Worker Elbert Rix will be suitably punished for this shirking of his assigned duties.\n[[/footnote]] \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nUpon return of the search for Security Officer Newton Thaw Worker Reginald Huff reports that all rust surrounding the factory location had been replaced with fallen leaves of the //Cornus florida// and //Nyssa sylvatica// varieties.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nThe Factory Board of Directors authorizes Elder Foreman Robert Henegar to conduct another controlled burn operation to purge the area of any foreign organic matter. Worker Reginald Huff is provided appropriate equipment to carry out the approved controlled burn duties. All attempts at ignition of the leaf matter in the area resulted in immolation of Worker Reginald Huff's own organic components and replacement of any remaining components with incompatible organic matter.[[footnote]]\n@@@@\n> After Worker Repairman Purdy Baxley's examination, it was determined that Worker Reginald Huff was no longer capable of performing his duties, and despite the warranted nature of punishment, Worker Reginald Huff would be incapable of receiving such punishment.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nRemote viewing by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar establishes that the instance of //Nyssa sylvatica// has exceeded 30m in height and has nearly reached the Factory roof. The continued growth of the //Nyssa sylvatica// is accompanied by similar rates of root growth that compromise the the structural integrity of Primary Production Level 1 through Sub-level 5.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAll employees located below Sub-level 1 are ordered to relocate to Sub-level 6 through Sub-level 12. The Factory Board of Directors considers permission to allow employees to move to Sub-level 13 and below, but at the time, the personnel asset losses that would be suffered through such a move are not justified.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAttritive attacks against Factory personnel assets continue in the form of assault by //Mammuthus columbi// and //Canis dirus guildayi// instances.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nMultiple foremen assigned to the clean up and containment operations around the Factory fail to report for the end-of-day meeting. Upon search of their patrol areas, components of the missing personnel assets were found.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nRemote viewing by Elder Foreman Robert Henegar establishes that the instance of //Nyssa sylvatica// has exceeded 45m in height and has breached the roof of the Factory. Continued root growth has compromised the the structural integrity of Sub-Level 6 through Sub-Level 10.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAll employees located between Sub-level 6 and Sub-level 12 are ordered to relocate to Sub-level 13 through Sub-level 21. As a result of this relocation, 90.005% of remaining personnel are lost.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nThe entirety of The Factory surfaces from Sub-level 8 through the Roof-level are covered by //Parthenocissus quinquefolia// instances. The Questioner infiltrates the Factory, bypassing all security checkpoints and patrols without detection. Descriptions of the The Questioner physically vary between observers, but all observes refer to the entity as \"The Questioner\" despite the fact that no such information was disseminated to personnel assets. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAn emergency missive from the Board Of Directors commands the removal of all personnel from the affected area with all personnel unable to leave the Sub-levels to shelter in place, and a moratorium on contact or observance of The Questioner. The Investor is dispatched via transubstantiation to begin Negotiations. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nSee [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/eco-sabotage-s-67789/offset/1|Document N-58711]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"colspan=\"2\"]]\nRESULTS/FOLLOW UP\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nIn light of the failure to successfully negotiate with The Questioner.
