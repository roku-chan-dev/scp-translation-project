When found, it is to be sedated and kept comatose until permanent containment methods are devised.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8291 is a non-aging female human possessing seeming hyper-endurance and regenerative abilities. SCP-8291 has historically been referred to merely as \"Orlando\", with no known surname associated with it. Personnel are yet to communicate with SCP-8291 verbally.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8291 was discovered on 18/MAY/1876 when Foundation agents began analyzing British records for an unrelated investigation. The name \"Orlando\" was continually referenced throughout a nearly three-century period, leading to a Foundation agent concluding that the figure may be anomalous.\n\nFoundation agents attempted to apprehend SCP-8291 at a government building in London, although SCP-8291 noticed the efforts and was able to escape containment. Foundation personnel have since made 6 efforts to capture SCP-8291 , although all efforts have failed without engagement. Documents and images of SCP-8291 or relating to SCP-8291 have been retrieved and kept in the Site-44 physical storage locker.\n\n**Note:** On 05/JAN/1943, the SCP-8291 file was abandoned to conserve resources within Site-44. SCP-8291 would eventually be reintroduced to research efforts on 13/MAY/2003, under Researcher Amelia Warnecke.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Site-44\n+++ Audio Communications Transcript\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Piedmonte:** Hello?\n\n**Warnecke:** Hey, Director Piedmonte.\n\n**Piedmonte:** Who is this?\n\n**Warnecke:** Warnecke.\n\n**Piedmonte:** ...\n\n**Warnecke:** Oh, sorry.

Apparently Greene is also alive and kicking, although he isn't being constantly monitored anymore. Still, this whole thing with Greene being a PoI is starting to make me think that there really aren't many files of SCP-8291 in storage.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ The Suspected Movements of One Nick Greene\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n1540~ - 1600~, Early Years of life. Works as a poet and critic. Artistic depictions are made of Greene detailing his aging. Somewhere in the early 17th century, Greene is believed to have ceased aging. Maintains the appearance of an elderly man.\n\n1600~ - 1648, Intermediate years. Continues as a poet. In 1648, Greene was knighted by James I.\n\n1648 - 1795, Domestic Travels. Greene travelled around England, becoming a professor and taking up at least thirty-nine positions at universities (possibly more).\n\n1795 - 1845, European Travels. Greene left England for France through Spain in 1795 to write about the French Revolution. Would travel throughout Europe across the Napoleonic wars, writing frequently about battles. In 1817, Greene began a journey across Europe to visit major cities across the continent.\n\n1845 - 1850, First American Visit. Greene briefly sailed to America and travelled around the nation, writing a book on his journeys.\n\n1850 - 1924, Back to England. Greene returned to England in 1850. Became a professor at the University of London. Greene also began a newspaper publication which lasted from 1862 - 1914. On one instance, Greene was spotted briefly conversing with SCP-8291 in 1903. Any further relationship is unknown, and unprecedented.\n\n1924 - 1978, Second American Visit. Greene was observed travelling to the United States a second time in 1924. In America, he helped organize an illegal alcohol distillery operation. Greene additionally founded an at-first anti-prohibition newspaper in the states, quickly going on to become a literary critique newsletter.\n\nObservation of Greene was ended by Site-44 on 01/JAN/1978.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** Paul was able to find a different section with a copy of pretty much every single newspaper Greene ever wrote. I'm going to go through them all over the next few days, and hopefully see if he mentioned Orlando at one point. Even if the stuff about Greene is more organized, it still is just a mess to sort through. No sorting by dates, no nothing like that.\n\n**Note:** Holy shit.\n\n[[div  class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ //'A SIT DOWN INTERVIEW WITH THE POET ORLANDO'//\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[size 115%]] **ORLANDO** [[/size]] **is a poet from England whom I have been a good friend with for a long, long time. I was recently sent a letter by Orlando, informing me of her arrival in the States. So, I took the chance to visit her and sit down to ask her a few questions.**\n\n[[size 115%]] **NOT** [[/size]] **long ago**, I helped Orlando to publish her manuscript, \"The Oak Tree\". So it is wonderful to have the chance to converse...\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** I have removed the rest of the newspaper and interview. I don't think there is much to note in the rest of the interview (Greene and Orlando just talk about the manuscript and how it was published, rather than important details about Orlando's life). Still, this concretely places Orlando in the United States in the very least in the 1930's. Trying to look around for a copy of \"The Oak Tree\", should it exist.\n\n**Note:** It's been roughly another two weeks since the newspaper discovery. Finding it suggested that Orlando wasn't strictly bound to England. I think I have enough to revise the article.\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Orlando_on_her_return_to_England.png/390px-Orlando_on_her_return_to_England.png?20240926160804 | caption= SCP-8291, \"Orlando\". | width 100px]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-8291\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Efforts are underway to locate SCP-8291.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8291 is a non-aging human female. SCP-8291 additionally seems to possess abilities of hyper-endurance and gradual regeneration. SCP-8291 is currently uncontained, and Foundation personnel are yet to communicate with her. SCP-8291 is commonly referred to as \"Orlando\".\n\nSCP-8291's date of birth is unknown, although it is known that SCP-8291 served as an ambassador for England to the Ottoman Court, spending several years in Constantinople (Now Istanbul) during the early 17th century. SCP-8291 later returned to England, although the means of which are unknown. Marriage certificates suggest that SCP-8291 was, at one point, married to a man named Bonthrop Shelmerdine.\n\n----\n\n**Note:** So I figured out something about Orlando. I looked through letters, through old publications, through documents. Pretty much all depictions of Orlando as we currently know her start some time in the early 1600's, when she supposedly was an ambassador to the Ottoman court. Yet, no depictions of her exist prior. Then, I found an artistic rendition of an ambassador to the Ottomans from around the same time.\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Orlando_as_Ambassador.png/486px-Orlando_as_Ambassador.png?20240926013824 | caption= British Ambassador Orlando, dictated shortly prior to his departure from England. | align=center | width 100px]]\n\nAnd sure enough, there was a male British ambassador from around that time period named Orlando. An ambassador who had previously been a part of the Queen's court. Yet one who seemingly disappeared without a trace as soon as our Orlando showed up. \n\nI believe SCP-8291 was born as a man, then later became a woman.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Piedmonte:** Warnecke!\n\n**Warnecke:** Finally remembered my name?\n\n**Piedmonte:** Let's roll with something along those lines and not bring up your first name.\n\n**Warnecke:** Amelia.\n\n**Piedmonte:** There we go!\n\n**Warnecke:** Did you read the new file on 8291?\n\n**Piedmonte:** Not yet.

Such as something like the novel.\n\n**Warnecke:** So you want me to find proof, without looking for proof?\n\n**Piedmonte:** What I'm saying is to at least wait until you've followed up more promising options.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** I have an idea.\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Field Notes:** Historical Excursion One\n-----\nI thought I had a lead; I trusted my gut, went to Kent in search of proof. The two 'Orlando's //had// to have something in common; even if they aren't the same person, figuring that out would still be helpful. If I could just find Orlando's historical residences, based on archival logs, reports, and historical records whilst he was a man, then I could prove I was right to Piedmonte. If I could just bring a tangible piece of evidence, there is no way he could dismiss my argument.\n\nI found nothing.\n\nNothing. Can you believe that? Literally, //zero// evidence of a man named 'Orlando' ever living in this area; every person I interviewed glared at me and closed the door in my face. The one time somebody let me in, her father heard my questions and threw me out -- what the hell is wrong with people? Is it about asking for Orlando? I don't know.\n\nI'm writing this from a local pub, officially, I am not drinking, but unofficially, the stout they have is wonderful. It's weird, being in such a historic place, so casually. The floor is uneven, covered in spills, technology everywhere, and yet, the walls are covered in black and white photos from the past, random letters, bills, anything they could tack to the wall, they did. There are boar heads, historical weapons, and anything that you would need to cosplay a tavern at a Ren fair.\n\nNevermind. I found something, maybe.

It looked like it had been carried in a wallet or coat pocket for well over a decade, it must have been important to somebody, not sure who? Maybe the owner?

I will state that the discovery is impressive. However in some cases results still don't warrant the means. In this recording, you were drinking, failed to report the location of a Keter-class anomaly, and most of all revealed the existence of the Foundation in public. Frankly, there is a learning curb to be expected. However some actions taken are hardly excusable. The only reason you have not been demoted from the 8291 case is because of your discovery, and your means of contacting the anomaly.\n\nGoing forward, I will make a point to assign myself co-researcher to yourself on 8291 for the time being, in order to ensure protocol is met. Any additions or modifications to the file must be approved by me.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Director Edward Piedmonte\n|title= none\n|signoff= Site-44\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **SCP-8291 Report:** Major Identity Discovery\n= //Request for Funding//\n\nThis report has been created as part of an application to the Research and Publications Board, to create an official recorded record of the discoveries surrounding SCP-8291. All contents of this report are to be considered accurate; any variance between this and the main file is incorrect, and any questions should be addressed to Director Piedmonte at Site-44.\n\nFollowing an extensive research into SCP-8291, the research team has made a major discovery. To date, the Foundation had assumed that SCP-8291 was a biological human female with no overall significance outside of it's anomalous properties. Recently, it has been noted by my co-Researcher Amelia Warnecke that there is substantial evidence that SCP-8291 was originally a male human who acted as a British ambassador and, as a male, had heavy influence in the English royal court.\n \nDue to the significance of this finding, SCP-8291 is now considered at a higher priority. SCP-8291 is a male who, by seemingly anomalous means, managed to change its sex to that of a female. It is believed that the act of SCP-8291 being a 'transgender' anomaly can provide powerful insights to the Foundation, given the lack of PoI's or anomalous persons who have undergone sex changes.\n\nThis discovery by myself and co-Researcher Warnecke represents one of the first major discovery of a transgender anomalous individual, and therefore, further funding is requested. Given the Foundation's recent push towards diversity and inclusivity, the funding of useful research into queer issues is critical. As such, I am suggesting that wider funding be pushed toward Site-44 and more specifically to SCP-8291 to further any initiatives to assist in diversity.\n\nRegards,\nDirector Piedmonte\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** Since Piedmonte submitted the report, he has done zero work on SCP-8291, nor has he responded to any of my meeting requests, or given any direction on next steps.

My boss saw our last conversation and has begun to 'oversee' my research; including writing a report where he pretends he contributed //anything// to the discovery. I would like to ensure that what we say is accurate, rather than being informed by his findings.\n\n**SCP-8291:** What did he find?\n\n**Warnecke:** Nothing that I hadn't found already.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Ha. Four-hundred years, and yet, they are still the same. Very well, where shall we meet?\n\n**Warnecke:** Yo-- you're agreeing to meet with me?\n\n**SCP-8291:** You sound so surprised, my dear, but I understand your plight. As long as you can promise that I will be able to leave, unaccosted, I am even willing to meet at one of your 'facilities'. Can you guarantee that?\n\n**Warnecke:** Yes. Orlando, you can trust me. We want the same things.\n\n**SCP-8291:** For once, in all of my interactions with your sort, I believe you are correct.

How about what year you were born, if you can recall it.\n\n**SCP-8291:** The exact year?\n\n**Warnecke:** If you can remember it-\n\n**SCP-8291:** Oh, some time in the middle of the 16th century, I would say. I was but only about ten years of age when I first began winning influence in the court.\n\n**Warnecke:** What was it like back in the court of... Elizabeth, I would say?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Hm...\n\n//SCP-8291 rests her fingers against her forehead.//\n\n**SCP-8291:** Terribly sorry; although my body may remain in a perfect condition after all of these years, it does grow hard for me to remember specific details from centuries ago.\n\n**Warnecke:** What do you remember around that time?\n\n**SCP-8291:** I remember... I remember that, when I was still young, something to the sort of a Russian envoy came about. They visited the court, and I myself courted the Russian princess. Sasha.\n\n**Warnecke:** What was she like.\n\n**SCP-8291:** She was beautiful. She taught me the very basics of Russian, although I could hardly speak a work regardless of how she tried. We met in secret over a great many nights. Every day she spent in London was precious.\n\n**Warnecke:** What happened to Sasha?\n\n**SCP-8291:** ... She left. Without warning on a night we were supposed to meet. I looked into the sunset and saw her boat leaving, not being able to say a goodbye. \n\n**Warnecke:** Oh. I'm really, really sorry about that Orlando.\n\n**SCP-8291:** It's alright.\n\n**Warnecke:** Did you ever try to talk to her later?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Never really had the chance to.

I know him well - he is a great friend of mine!\n\n**Warnecke:** I was reading a newspaper interview he made of you a few decades ago.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Oh, that thing! Nick always set out to making newspapers wherever he travelled.\n\n**Warnecke:** I understand that he helped you write a book.\n\n**SCP-8291:** That he did.

I am sorry for not bringing a copy with me here, I promise I will remember it when next we meet!\n\n**Warnecke:** May I ask how you ended up in Constantinople?\n\n**SCP-8291:** My home here and England, for lack of a better description, was rendered entirely and absolutely uninhabitable - I had to flee the nation for a duration, so I requested of King Charles to send me as Ambassador Extraordinaire to Istanbul.\n\n**Warnecke:** Then is that where-\n\n**SCP-8291:** I became a woman? Yes!\n\n**Warnecke:** What was it like?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Quite a shocking change, to be frank. I remember not realizing the scope of my new body for years until I finally embarked back home to England. I believe a man, by some abject horror, witnessed my bare ankle!\n\n**Warnecke:** Oh my, so scandalous!\n\n//SCP-8291 laughs.//\n\n**SCP-8291:** That man in fact almost fell to his death overboard, leading me to realize what magnitude my metamorphosis held. It caused me to dress as a man and woman whenever I needed to alternate. Including to evade the proposals of marriage by members of the court.\n\n**Warnecke:** When did you start to lose influence in the court?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Mostly when I was bombarded with proposals from every bachelor who stepped foot near me, and left to evade their attention.\n\n**Warnecke:** Ah.\n\n**SCP-8291:** What would you like to inquire next?\n\n**Warnecke:** How about your life more recently?

So if we're all ready - let's start?\n\n**Piedmonte:** Fine by me.\n\n**SCP-8291:** I do remember for a good period of time in the middle of the century, I wasn't even in England - as I would frequently visit the Unites States to study and meet with acquaintances.\n\n**Warnecke:** That is actually partially how we found you; that newspaper, I believe? Was from when you were in America.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Is it, now?\n\n**Warnecke:** But can you go into a bit more detail about what went on there. Anything specific? Anybody you wanted to meet?\n\n**SCP-8291:** There was one lady, a remarkable woman named Edith-\n\n**Piedmonte:** Sorry, sorry.

You know that we've been trying to track you down for a while.\n\n**SCP-8291:** From my understanding, you gave up and only found me because of Amelia.\n\n**Piedmonte:** Ahem. Yes. But then some of my superiors are really curious about what you were doing, how you were evading us-\n\n**SCP-8291:** Are you not a director? Who may these superiors be?\n\n**Piedmonte:** I don't think I can disclose that.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Uh huh?\n\n**Piedmonte:** But - and let's stay on topic here - do you have any explanation for what specifically you did to get away from us?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Now now, why would I give up my secrets?\n\n**Piedmonte:** It's a matter of safety - //global// safety. If there are anomalous entities such as yourself-\n\n**SCP-8291:** Entities?\n\n**Piedmonte:** -who are roaming around in a place where we can't find them and they turn out to be dangerous, there is a clear risk to lives.

Perhaps, this might even refer to a certain individual whom I know we both have a //lengthy// opinion regarding?\n\n**Warnecke:** //Laughing.// Yes, I do believe we are talking about the same person.\n\n**SCP-8291:** In that case, yes. I have dealt with many a man who firmly believes that one's gender is the foremost defining trait a person can have. I have argued with bigots anon, and in all cases, have found one commonality: each was afraid.\n\n**Warnecke:** Scared? I doubt Piedmonte is scared of me.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Fear takes many forms, Amelia. Yes, fear is often shown through cowardice, avoidance or weakness; but a man is told that he cannot show weakness. He is raised to see fear as a falsehood, rather than something that you should listen to. They have, through this warped meaning of fear, changed how they show it. Or, put simply, the ways they negate your labour, the ways they undercut your abilities, the repeated attempts at control: that is just a man, attempting to show that he is afraid.\n\n**Warnecke:** All men?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Just those who could never survive being a woman.\n\n//The two share a knowing smile, as SCP-8291 leans back in its chair.//\n\n**Warnecke:** Thank you. I... I needed to know that it wasn't just me. I needed to hear it from somebody else, you know?\n\n**SCP-8291:** I do. I have been where you are before, and no matter what is said about you; continue to move forward. They will dwell on you, while you grow; let their spite feed you.\n\n**Warnecke:** Th-- Thanks. Again. I mean it.\n\n**SCP-8291:** Oh! That reminds me, on the topic of thanks--\n\n//SCP-8291 turns around, and removes a leather hardcover book from their bag.//\n\n**SCP-8291:** This is for you.\n\n//Warnecke takes the book, and begins to turn it over.//\n\n**Warnecke:** What? What is this?\n\n**SCP-8291:** If I recall, you had expressed a desire to--\n\n**Warnecke:** //The Oak Tree//? But, this looks nothing like the printings that I have ever--\n\n**SCP-8291:** That is because it is not a printing. This was a personal copy, made in a set, long ago; I gave them as gifts to those who mattered to me most, those who had helped me out, and those who I wanted to see flourish.\n\n**Warnecke:** I can't accept this, Orlando. I'm researching you, and as much as this would help, I can't take advantage--\n\n**SCP-8291:** Accepting a gift, freely offered, is not 'taking advantage', nor do you have any recourse to reject this gift.\n\n**Warnecke:** You just met me. I'm not somebody who deserves this from you, not after all the trouble I've caused. Not if they never leave you alone after this.\n\n**SCP-8291:** I have my ways of disappearing, that is not a concern. Just as the trouble is not bothersome; you, Amelia, have reminded me about that which matters. You are more than deserving.\n\n**Warnecke:** How can I thank you?\n\n**SCP-8291:** Remember this, and take the inscription to heart. That is all the thanks I need.\n\n-----\n//The inscription, located on the title page of the book reads: 'Do not let those who fail to understand who you are explain what you can or cannot do. Trust yourself.'//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Researcher Warnecke enters the Site-44 storage locker and walks to the front desk. On her side is a bag.//\n\n**Bernard:** Amy! Good to see you're around here again.\n\n**Warnecke:** Yeah - though this time's just going to be a quick visit.\n\n**Bernard:** All cool.\n\n//Warnecke produces a paper note from her bag, as well as the copy of The Oak Tree.//\n\n**Bernard:** Are things smoothing over with you and Piedmonte?\n\n**Warnecke:** Would I be here if they weren't?\n\n//Bernard laughs.//\n\n**Bernard:** So you're free to go back to Orlando's case?\n\n**Warnecke:** We'll see.\n\n//Warnecke reads the paper note, briefly, then sets it down on the table before she picks up the book and looks at the cover.//\n\n**Bernard:** Huh, what's that?\n\n**Warnecke:** Just a book one of my friends gave me.\n\n**Bernard:** What's it's title?\n\n**Warnecke:** //The Oak Tree.//\n\n**Bernard:** Hm. What's it about?\n\n**Warnecke:** Haven't really figured that out yet.\n\n**Bernard:** Well hope it's a fun read.\n\n**Warnecke:** Yeah.\n\n//Warnecke puts the book back in her bag and closes it.//\n\n**Bernard:** So what can I help you with?\n\n**Warnecke:** I was just interested in a section of notes related to Greene and wanted to look into them.\n\n**Bernard:** Yeah, sure. Just tell me the section.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= Director Edward Piedmonte\n|to= Researcher Amelia Warnecke\n|cc= none\n|subject= Reassignment\n]]\n@@ @@\n\nWith immediate effect and action, I am removing you from the 8291 case. You directly disobeyed my orders and went about contacting an anomaly without any team to back you up, or any team to contain said anomaly. You are incredibly lucky that I am rational, and am simply assuming that the anomaly has some sort of memetic effect on you - because if not, then you clearly show an error in judgement that borders on outright treason to the Foundation and a threat to your operations.\n\nIt is clear that you can not keep working with 8291, as your mental facilities do not seem capable enough to resist it. Furthermore, I am calling into question your ability to continue working in Site-44 as a matter of safety and simple security. You let SCP-8291 know the exact location of our sight, and should the anomaly attempt to break into the sight I worry that you may attempt to aid its assault.\n\nThere are even grounds to call for outright removal from the Foundation, or detainment. And yet, because I am reasonable, I have elected instead to merely remove you from the sight as a security hazard. After careful deliberation, I have elected you to be transferred to Site-43, as I believe their primary focus their is cognitive and mental studies. Hopefully, such a site can assist with whatever effect SCP-8291 has had on your emotions.\n\nI do sincerely hope you recover.\n \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Director Edward Piedmonte\n|title= none\n|signoff= Site-44\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Final Addendum:** Updated File\n= //**Note:** I am making major adjustments to the file as needed following the reassignment of a former SCP-8291 researcher.
