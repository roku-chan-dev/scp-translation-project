Thaumaturges from the Department of Tactical Theology will monitor Hume level and Akiva radiation fluctuations, and any newly discovered cognitohazardous inscriptions are to be immediately defaced by trained personnel. Additional monitoring by MTF Chi-09 (“Page Turners”) of academic publications, institutions, and curriculum as well as any non-academic publications or media that focus on any component of SCP-6830 (either individually or corporately) in order to prevent the dissemination of possibly accurate information. \n\nIn order to prevent a likely CK-Class Restructuring Scenario in which SCP-6830-Aten is able to either partially or fully enter our timeline (hereafter classified as a HEKA event), a concerted effort must be maintained by Foundation personnel to confuse the historical narrative surrounding SCP-6830-1. All factual information regarding SCP-6830 and its component parts is to be kept exclusively contained to the awareness and records of Site-91's approved research team and the O5 Council. \n\nIn the event that Site-91 detects **any** fluctuations in local reality, Akiva radiation, or other anomalous activity within the Amarna temple complex, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-reliquary-area-27 |Reliquary Area-27]]] is to be notified immediately to scramble MTF Kairos-01 to prepare for a possible HEKA event and probable Veil breach and/or CK-Class Restructuring Scenario.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=generic\n|unique-name=description\n|display-name=Description\n]]\nSCP-6830 is the designation for a thaumaturgical ritual[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]As the details of the ritual itself are unknown at the time, a connection to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3457 |SCP-3457]]] should not be presumed, although there seems to be a possibility of connection due to manner in which SCP-6830-2 was described by surviving documentation as discovering the ritual via discourse with 'religious personages outside of the Egyptian court of great knowledge'. Further research is advised.[[/span]] completed by the Pharaoh Akhenaten (hereafter designated as SCP-6830-1 prior to the performance of SCP-6830).[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The tenth ruler of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, who reigned c. 1351 through 1334 BCE. Prior to the fifth year of his reign, he was known by the name Amenhotep IV before his conversion to Atenism.[[/span]]\n\nWhile the details of the ritual itself are only partially understood, the resulting Akiva radiation feedback loop caused massive distortion to space-time which in turn created several linear temporality refractions. Only one of these refractions resulted in a timeline within which SCP-6830-1 successfully ascended to godhood (this iteration hereafter designated SCP-6830-Aten). It should be assumed that there were multiple temporal refractions created that likely remain unidentified by the Foundation or by SCP-6830-Aten. See Table II for known and theorized timelines.\n\nThe ruins of the temple complex at Amarna, which acted as the seat of worship for the cult SCP-6830-1 established, will additionally manifest anomalous inscriptions, indistinguishable from ancient carving in both physical nature and literary content, upon various surfaces. Typically these inscriptions will appear four times in a solar year, although the exact frequency cannot be predicted with certainty. The inscriptions also may contain cognitohazardous elements in roughly 80% of cases, although the effects fluctuate between causing the subject to either become more prone to fanatical belief and worship of SCP-6830-Aten or be struck by intense paranoia of imminent invasion by unknown and unseen threats. While the inscriptions can be easily excised by trained personnel, any failure to do so will increase the appearance of additional inscriptions within an expanding radius outward from Amarna. It must be noted that it is unknown why these carvings have not already expanded to their full potential, as they were left unchecked for several millennia before rediscovery.\n\nA combination of chronological distance, dearth of primary source material (either through accidental loss, natural processes, or intentional destruction), and an abundance of space-time contamination caused by the actions of SCP-6830-Aten through various timelines has made a complete description of the events of SCP-6830 difficult to construct. However, the following events can be known with a relative degree of certainty:\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal dark\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Table I - Known Events Preceding SCP-6830 +\" hide=\"worship he who waits in jubilee\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ Table I - Known Events Preceding SCP-6830\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal light\"]]\n//(NB: Be aware that while the dates for events are approximated, the order of events has been verified via multiple historical and anomalous sources held by the Foundation, and can be accepted as accurate.)//\n\n* **c. 1351 BCE -** SCP-6830-1 ascends to the Egyptian throne, very likely as a child.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]It is unknown how old SCP-6830-1 was at his ascension, one of the recovered instances of cognitohazardous inscriptions found at the Amarna Temple Complex refers to the 'scales upon his eyes which fell away in his eighteenth year', which refers to his conversion to Atenism in the fifth year of his reign.[[/span]]  Egyptian religious culture can be described at this point as polytheistic and supporting active worship for various divinities with little to no persecution on the basis of doctrine. \n\n* **c. 1342 BCE -** SCP-6830-1 begins to institute a change in state religion throughout the kingdom of Egypt which dismantles the cults of all gods except a manifestation of the sun god known as Aten.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]While a solar deity akin to Ra or Horus, Aten appears to be specifically the non-anthropomorphized representation of the sun disk (as viewed in the sky) as well as the light that is received from it. While the //Book of Coming Forth by Day//, most commonly known as the //Book of the Dead//, includes mention of Aten as a god in its own right to be respected, prior to the reign of SCP-6830-1's father it held little to no place within Ancient Egyptian polytheistic worship.[[/span]]  Previously in his reign SCP-6830-1 had expressed his religious proclivities in speeches and temple decoration, however this point marks the beginning of the shift towards moving the entirety of religious ritual and behavior to focus exclusively in Aten, with SCP-6830-1 acting as exclusive high priest of the cult.\n\n* **c. 1342-44 BCE -** SCP-6830-1 discovers the nature and details of SCP-6830 through his primary wife, Nefertiti (hereafter designated SCP-6830-2). SCP-6830-1's son and future successor Tutankhamen (hereafter designated SCP-6830-3) is believed to have spoken out against SCP-6830-1's plans to utilize the ritual, but nothing further about this conflict is known at this time.\n\n* **c. 1339 BCE -** SCP-6830-1 begins preparations for SCP-6830, including the construction of a temple complex to house the necessary components as well as various thaumaturgical artifacts, ritualists, and necessary sacrifices. All other worship in Egypt is suppressed to degrees of varying success, although the greatest impact is seen around Amarna, Karnak, and Thebes. The scale of the ritual requires over a decade of preparation and collection of needed resources. \n\n* **c. 1334 BCE -** SCP-6830-1 attempts to complete SCP-6830, which manifests several linear temporality refractions, only one of which results in success and the creation of SCP-6830-Aten. SCP-6830-2 is also empowered to a lesser degree in this timeline and is now designated as SCP-6830-Maat. SCP-6830-1 is killed during the process in all other timelines, including the Foundation's baseline reality. See Addendum 6830.1 for further details.\n\nAlthough the Foundation's current timeline (designated Timeline **Ⳮ**) does not contain the successful outcome of SCP-6830 as a historical reality, SCP-6830-Aten is aware of Timeline **Ⳮ** and has made several aborted attempts to encroach upon local chronology. The modus of these attempts is poorly understood, but it has been confirmed that a baseline amount of belief in SCP-6830-Aten's existence in the destination timeline is required in order for the transfer to be effective.\n\nIf SCP-6830-Aten is able to successfully transfer itself to a separate temporal refraction, the timeline within which it previously was located in will experience complete reality destabilization within a solar year of its departure. The mechanism behind this destruction is not understood at this time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal dark\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Table II - Known Resultant Timelines +\" hide=\"he rejoices, waiting within the horizon\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ Table II - Known Resultant Timelines\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n||~ Timeline Designation ||~ Status ||~ Notable Features ||\n|| Timeline **Ⳮ** || Stable || Foundation's current timeline.

It should be noted that this practice of defacing the name of the previous ruler was not uncommon by pharaohs upon their ascension, particularly after an unpopular reign by their predecessor. It also appears that SCP-6830-3 used physical practices of iconoclasm typical for the era rather than any specific ritual behavior to eliminate the remains of SCP-6830-1’s efforts.\n\nInitially, it was believed that SCP-6830-3's reign proceeded without further incident, but during Howard Carter's cataloguing of SCP-6830-3's grave goods, a papyrus fragment was found wrapped around the sheath of an iron dagger in the Pharaoh's sarcophagus.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Confirmed by academic researchers in 2016 to have been fashioned from meteoric iron, the dagger (along with several other iron implements) was found within the tomb and listened on papyri inventories among in the late pharaoh's effects as 'The Stars'.[[/span]] Although it was translated at the time, Carter and his contemporaries at the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4002 |Royal Department of Para-Archaeology]]] (one of many Foundation precursors) did not recognize it as referring to SCP-6830 and instead was thought to be a protection spell in line with more typical Egyptian grave goods.

However, the causal link was poorly understood until Carter's discovery of SCP-6830-3 and the translation of several inscriptions at both Amarna and Karnak regarding the reign of SCP-6830-1, which resulted in early containment procedures being established, consisting primarily of monitoring Amarna directly and nullifying any resultant inscriptions.\n\nIn September of 1942, during the aftermath of the Battle of Alam el Halfa and the end of Axis occupation in Africa, Generalleutnant Rommel directed a contingent of German troops to retreat through Amarna in order attempt to cut off British Lieutenant General Montgomery's Allied reinforcements en route from Malta. As a result, monitoring of the temple complex was compromised for roughly one week and an extensive proliferation of inscriptions occurred as well as an additional anomaly which had not been previously witnessed.

A rarity in thaumaturgical circles, to say the least, but however or wherever Nefertiti found the details has been thankfully lost to history. Of course, it's just as possible to think that others were more successful in containing the effects of the ritual and have managed to become better, more sinister divines.\n\nIf nothing else, Aten is easy to keep an eye on.\n\nThe inscriptions that appear have always been recorded and translated as best we are able, although over the years it has become increasingly clear that we are not receiving them from any specific place in space or time, nor are we certain as to who might be sending them our way. Initially it was assumed this might a way for Aten to try and spread his name, as we've noticed again and again how a rise in Egyptology's popularity seemed to make the inscriptions increase, but not attempted HEKA events. However, it's become clear that the inscriptions come from the timelines he has destroyed, and they represent something far more important, I think.\n\nA warning.\n\nThis by no means is a call to change or abandon our protocols or containment, as the continued uncertainty of what exactly happened in Amarna on that day three millennia ago may be the only thing that stands between us and annihilation. It is clear from the last recorded HEKA event in 1927 that Aten is aware of us, and does not understand why he has been unable to enter since we are also aware of him. The events of 1942 showed us what happens when he leaves a timeline, but not when he enters it. I do not wish to see it first hand.\n\nWhatever is standing in the way is beyond his power as much as it is beyond ours. The inscriptions aren't as clear as we would like, but they make it seem that the less truthful we are about him, the less he is able to influence things here. So if Phillip Glass wants to write an opera? Fine. If Netflix wants to make a movie about him meeting Moses or something? Great. The inscriptions point to how frustrated Aten seems to get that no one gets his story right here, so keep it up.\n\nIt might be ridiculous, but it works. And it is so much better than the alternative, until we have more answers. \n\nLead Researcher Ibrahim Salah\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"addenda\"]]\nAddendum 6830.3\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal dark\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Dream Log Report 6830.11 +\" hide=\"work ends when you rest within the west\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nOn 16 July 2019, all thirteen members of the Overseer Council reported having similar dreams featuring an entity who they named as representing SCP-6830-Duat, although in description their appearance differed from dreamer to dreamer. Overseer 11's report has been included in its entirety, as his eidetic memory allowed for a near transcription of this conversation, which has been correlated with other O5 accounts for accuracy.\n\nThe other 12 O5 members would like to note that they had significantly less irreverence in their dialogue with SCP-6830-Duat.\n\n----\n\n++++ Dream Log Report 6830.11\n\n----\n\n**Personnel:** Overseer 11 (██████████ ████)\n\n**Estimated Degree of Recall:** 99%\n\n**Anomalous Entity Present?:** Y\n\n**Likelihood of Actionable Intelligence:** HIGH\n\n--**Description:**-- {{Transcription:}} \n\nO5-11 comes to awareness sitting within the Ägyptisches Museum Berlin on a bench in front of the famed Bust of Nefertiti. (O5-11 notes that while the bust was housed within its usual glass casing, there is no bench present in front of the piece in the actual museum foyer.) To his right, also sitting upon the bench, is an entity who he said he could be 'certain was SCP-6830-Duat when looking at him, but took the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of Rami Malek portraying the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah in the 2006 film //Night at the Museum// (and subsequent sequels).' \n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I know, I know. It's really on the nose, but don't blame me. This is your mind, after all.\n\n**O5-11:** Well yes, but it's sort of embarrassing, isn't it? I mean, it feels vaguely racist.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I'm not something you can fully understand, so you filled in the blanks as best you could. At least you actually filled me in with an actual Egyptian man, although I will confess that I sort of enjoyed the one of your number who used Steve Martin.\n\n**O5-11:** That had to be O5-3, it just had to.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I'll never tell, and neither will they. Besides, it's hardly the reason I'm here.\n\n**O5-11:** Right, right. Of course. (Pause) Why //are// you here, though?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I am here because of you, all of you, really. Your researchers have put together a clearer picture than I would have thought possible from the scraps that managed to make it through time to you. Even though I had little to do with it, I can't help but be proud. But it's not enough, and you need to know why.\n\n**O5-11:** ... well, I'm all ears.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I know. You know so much already, to be fair. How my fath- how Akhenaten sought power of the highest order, made a god in his image to seek power on a cosmic scale. In your world he failed, failed so spectacularly that he fractured time itself while our people had only begun to understand its meaning in the first place. I won't pretend to know his motivations, or why he has turned into what he has in the future where he succeeded. All that I know is everything, and yet somehow even that is not enough.\n\n**O5-11:** Is it a rule you deities have to speak in riddles like that?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** Not a rule, so much as a condition. Don't you do the same with those who aid you in your goals at this Foundation of yours? We see more than you can, but that doesn't always mean that we understand it all. The important part is the trust that you've built with them, that they believe you're telling them the right thing, even if they can't see everything at stake.\n\n//A black cat ran past them at this point, but paid neither party attention.//\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:**  What I am telling you is how we see your world, your timeline is from above. The more that you know of us, the more it calls to us, grabs our attention. It's not just worship, it's awareness. And it helps us do what needs to be done -- up here, I suppose.\n\n**O5-11:** We had sort of assumed that. The power of belief called to him, but -- he seems more interested in quality of that attention than you are.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** Aten cannot see through the noise any longer, although it infuriates him. He has forgotten how vast the mortal experience //could// be and believes it should be nothing but what he dictates, and this anger has ended up blinding him. He doesn't even realize how fragile this power is, how easily he could be caught on the jagged edges of time that he broke in the first place. He believes himself untouchable, by everyone.\n\n//The black cat returns, jumping through the glass to sit upon Nefertiti's crown.//\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** There is a cost to traveling physically between these strands of time. We might be able to look out, but to move beyond where we are extracts a great cost. He has never cared who paid it.\n\n**O5-11:** What we saw at Amarna in 1942.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** Exactly. What I let you see, anyway. It is a terrible thing to see, watching time itself unravel upon itself while the mortals left cling to the idea of their careless god who abandoned them returning to put it all right again. You have to understand, I was a child when he did the ritual, his eyes blazing like a madman as we tried to end it. Even Nefertiti tried to stop him in the end, which is how she was caught in the same manner I was. Infinite outcomes, all at once. Most of which ended in destruction, but one for each of us where we could see it all in perfect, terrible detail.  Billions upon billions would die if I was to force the confrontation that would put an end to it, and that is not acceptable. \n\n**O5-11:** Are you just planning to wait for him to come to you, then?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** Of course not. But he grows reckless, angry that you know of him enough that he can see you, but not the correct things that makes his transit possible. To use the words of one of your researchers, it might be ridiculous, but it's working. The fact that you know him but refuse to worship him correctly keeps him out, even though he keeps trying. And that should be enough of an opening.\n\n**O5-11:** An opening for what?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** ... she wasn't my mother, but she was like a mother to me all the same. Nefertiti never expected this to happen, for all of this to happen -- least of all for Akhenaten to grow such a thirst for power, for worship, for //everything//. She called me to where time had spit her out eons before, and I destroyed so much in my wake by sheer mistake. It still haunts me, but it was an object lesson. She hated what she had become, what I had become and asked for my mercy because -- I understood. I knew that I did not know everything, that I was in no position to be a god. And that ultimately I could stop him because of that fact. \n\n**O5-11:** How? I mean, if you know how to do it, why haven't you done so?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** Patience is a virtue.\n\n**O5-11:** Not right now it isn't.\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I explained to you already, the cost is not one I am going to ask billions of innocents to pay. But there will come a moment where he will stand on the bank, between rivers where no man may go. Where the great nothing waits for us both.\n\n**O5-11:** ... you're asking me to just stand by and assume it will all go to plan?\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** No.\n\n//The black cat jumps back across in front of them stopping to look up at O5-11 directly.//\n\n**SCP-6830-Duat:** I am asking you to have faith.\n\n//At this moment, O5-11 woke from his dream and wrote everything down immediately. Although the discussion differed between all thirteen dreams, each Overseer reported that the final statement to them from SCP-6830-Duat remained identical to what was said to O5-11.//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal light council\"]]\n\nOn 17 July 2019, there was a meeting of the Overseer Council to determine their reaction to the information provided by SCP-6830-Duat.

Efforts included academic articles calling into question the identity of relics and artifacts discovered in the Valley of the Kings during the past two centuries, as well as understating the actual nature and impact of SCP-6830-1's religious reforms. Efforts include beginning historiographical arguments surrounding the discovery of SCP-6830-1's burial site in KV55, validity of Atenism as a monotheistic movement, and encouraging fringe authors to publish works suggesting extraterrestrial involvement with both SCP-6830-1 and SCP-6830-3's reigns, and funding popular media projects which portray these various events incorrectly.\n\nFoundation personnel also found niche communities throughout the internet for historical jokes and memes, intentionally embedding content dismissive of SCP-6830-1's historical importance.
