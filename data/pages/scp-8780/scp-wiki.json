Without the Foundation’s intervention, potentially hundreds of people could’ve died under these living weapons. That is what we do -- secure, contain, protect.\n> \n> But there are many people out there who think otherwise. People that see us as ’evil’ and ’unethical’. And although that might be true to an outside observer, they are unable to realize the gravity of the decisions we have to make on a daily basis. For colleagues, friends and family.\n> \n> Yet these people still prevail, trying to take down our precious fortress that has stood against incomprehensible foes for decades. And if these people are not dealt with, our walls **will** crumble.\n> \n> The solution: The re-founding of my GREY MATTER Division. To filter out any hateful remarks toward us, and drip-feed the public media that shines us in a positive light.\n> \n> I would also propose myself for the open spot of O5-13, after Sophia Light’s recent outing. I’d like to think that I could handle the stresses that come with the duty as an Overseer; I hope you think this, too.\n> \n> I hope you take these words to heart, Overseers.\n> \n> [[>]]\n> //- Dr. Hakari Mimko//\n> //**Secure.
