background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ A Description of the Wonder Known As the Triliminal Gate\nThe Wonder takes the form of a peaked archway, constructed of pollarded oak trees that have grown over a thousand years, six cubits in height and the same in width, with a depth of a double hand-width. Eight magical runes have been carved into the surface of the doors and their shared frame: these runes are filled with a mixture of argentum, corpse-soil from the grave of a mage of great power, and hide-glue boiled from the skin of a white unicorn.\n\nOnce active, the Triliminal Gate creates a doorway into another realm. This realm is the place the --Dardics-- call the //Otherworld//. Do not attempt to pass through the doorway and enter the //Otherworld// yourself. Should any //persons// from the //Otherworld// enter ours, they must be swiftly returned to their world. The nature of our world will twist and alter them over time, leading to great suffering and, eventually, death.\n\nAn inactive Triliminal Gate is naught but wood and silver, and is easily destroyed by axe, by fire, or by Nahum’s Discorporative Breath. An active Triliminal Gate is a more difficult proposition: destroying an active Triliminal Gate risks immediate release of the energies contained within, which will lash out swiftly if not first disrupted. To determine if a Triliminal Gate is active, observe the runes carved upon it; should they glow cerulean blue in color, the Gate is active and must first be deactivated before destruction is attempted.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ On the Deactivation of the Activated Triliminal Gate\nDeactivation of an energized Triliminal Gate will require the following:\n\n* **//Dantalion’s Improved Leyline Disruption//** (or an equivalent Spell).\n* A sanctified silver athame that has never drawn blood.\n* A third eye and the skill to use it well.\n* Knowledge of the runes of They Who Dwell Between Worlds.\n\nFirst, place yourself so that the Rune of --Ḿ̵̧̨̧̧̡̫̯̰̼͉̦͎̟̭͚̘͔̣̪̼̠̗̫̪͚͙̩̠̣͉͓͍̫̼̬͎̝͕͈̣̜̖͙̝͖̦̩̘̬̻̯̮̫̱̮̣̬̳̫̳͚̝̫̯̟̮̜̦͓̭̲͖̰̲̘̼̞̻͙͓̖̜̰͖̥̉͒̄́̓̂̍͊̄̂̄͌̃̃͒̓͌͐̔̓̓͛͐̈́̊̉̌̏̽̉͂͌̈̓́̇̇̉̃̔̽̈́̃͒́̒͘̕͘͜͜͝͠͝͝͝͝ͅȃ̶̧̨̢̳̮̝̗̩̟̗͈͙̺͈͉̯͚̟̯̤̲͎̤̮̭͇̭̳̦̭̯̯̬̲̯̣͓͙̭̮͎̳̙̤̪̣̙͎̻̤̦̫̭͍̹̥̗͓̯͙̠̯̑̑́̂̒͆̏̾̂̑͗͊̅̔̐̑̈́͒́́̈̍͑͛͑̓̊̉͑͐͑̃̈́̀̊́͐̓̉̉̓́̌̑̓̾́̓̃̃̈́̈́̀̈͋̐̉̕̚̚͜͠͠l̸̢̧̛͚̣̝̪͇̳̩̮͇̦̹̮͎̻̣̥̝̗̱͈̼̞̜̬͈̜̫͔̻̘̣̳͕̤͚̝̼̻͇͓̤͖̖̼̦̗͍̰̮̙̪̳̖̙̓̅̇̀̂̈́̿̏̆̒̊̀͆͑̊̋͌̏̽̏͊̾̚̕͜͜͝ͅp̴̧̢̢̢̡̨̢̨̼̜̗̮̻͚̹̭̘̼͎̯͇͍̙̘̰̮̲̙̖͕̗͕̹̼̹͕̞̖̣̻͎̗͚͍̪̣̤͔͔̥̼̱̣͙̠̫̪̝͍͉̥̤̳̪̥̖͚̻̫͚̠͚̙͍͔̟̣͍͎͓̥̜̫̬̲̩̳̼͓̅͊̈̂̌͑͜͜͜͜͜ͅͅh̵̡̡̡̢̨̢̨̢̨̨̡̢̢̨̧̛̛̛̰͎̗͚͔̗̺͙̼͖̱̦̪̫̩̘̭͇̬̩̹̝͖̻͎͕̳͖̦̮̜͚̙̤̟̘̤͔̯̙̦̝͕͉͚̩̭̦̤̼̟̗̘̞̹̥͇͕̪͕͙̣͙͇͕̞̮͉̙̘̜̮̭͕̱̱̪̰̯͕̹̦͉̠͎̥̬̬͕̺̬̫̣̗̭͙̪̑̍̂̏̆̆̍̈́̿̑̆̂̾̉̉̌͌̓̾͆̈͐̽̀́̏̏̂͗͆̌̈́́͗̍͒͋͒̀̚͘̕͘͘͜͜͜͝͝ͅͅͅa̶̧̛̛̛̛̺̹̺̠͓͙͙̓͑̏̋̀͛̆͌̐̿̎̓̉̔̅̃̂̽͗͑̈͐̊̌͛̏͊̉͐̍́̒͋͒̂͆̈́̽͗̀̌͂͗͐̈́̿̽͂̅̈̏̑̊̏̇̈́̀̆́̔̋͑̒͘̕͘̚̚͠͝͠͠͝͠s̶̡̧̨̨̨̨̛̘̫̙͉͇͖̻̳̰̼͙͕͉̱̯̮͖̱̱̩̪͎̹̼̥͓͙͙̠̫͉̖͈̙̮̣̟̩̳͉͙̹̻͓̫͇̬̘̮͖̺̗̤̰͍͇̳̜͚̙͎̗̦̟̘̯͓̟͓̩͚̜̤̺̻̺̺̔̀̀̍̊̎̅̄̇́̀͛̈́͛́̂̈̽̓̓̂͑̏̒̅̃͂͛̇͒̆̎̂̀͆̂̀̈̓̋͊͌̒̒̾̄̈́̂̓̏̓͆̈́́̎̌͐͋̈́̓̾̀̀̆͛̽̅͛́̌̇̒̓͌̇́̆̓̔͂͛̚͘̕̕͜͠͝͝͝͠͠͝ͅͅͅ-- is to your sinister hand.

Should they now appear still and dark, the Triliminal Gate will be deactivated and can safely be destroyed. If they continue to glow, the Gate remains in operation, and you must restart this working from the very beginning.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ A word of warning\nThe Triliminal Gates are only found within the deepest depths of the --Dardic-- Labyrinths, guarded by their most ancient --Sorcerers-- and most dangerous minions. Only the greatest of our heroes should even risk delving so deep into the subterrene. Should you attempt such an expedition, trust in your steel, skill, and courage, but do not let your courage become foolhardiness. **Our Lady** has few enough heroes sworn to her cause, and an ignominious retreat is preferable to a futile death.\n\nThe dangers of the Labyrinths are five-fold.\n* First, the twisting of time and locus: in the labyrinths, one will find that a plumb line does not point towards the earth, that four right corners will not form a square, that a chamber an ell wide without will be a league wide within, and a thousand years may be as a day.\n* Second, the infernal devices within. The --Dardics-- fill their labyrinths with all manner of snares, traps, and mechanisms to slay those who would trespass within them.\n* Third, the beasts and minions that guard the Labyrinths. These range from unfortunate souls lost within, slave-soldiers forced to guard the chambers, and monstrous beasts formed by --Dardic-- sorcery.\n* Fourth, the eyes and ears of the --Dardic-- sorcerers perceive all that occurs within the Labyrinths they have created. Stealth and magic may conceal you for a time, but should the Sorcerer become aware of your intrusion, they will take notice and your task will become harder.\n* Fifth: the allure of wealth, glory, and gain. The Labyrinths contain many treasures and wonders that will serve desires crass and noble, can fund causes both sinister and benevolent. Many delves have failed due to distraction from the discovery of a previously unknown treasure. Keep to the narrow path, and do not let yourself become distracted by vanities.\n\nExperience and practice have shown us that five are the best number for those who would delve into a Labyrinth. It is recommended that this party includes:\n* A warrior of great renown, to slay the beasts within.\n* A thief of peerless skill, to keep their fellows hidden from the Sorcerers’ eyes.\n* A sage wise and cunning, to decipher the mysteries within.\n* A chirurgeon well-educated in the healing of wounds and illness.\n* A true soul who will guide these other four and keep to the narrow path.\n\nShould you and your companions choose to enter a Labyrinth for the purposes of destroying a Triliminal Gate, keep these principles in mind:\n\n__FIRST__: Prepare yourselves well. Bring weaponry, armor, and magic, but do not neglect sundries such as food, water, reagents, and medicine. Most parties die not to the teeth and fangs of beasts, but to cold, starvation, thirst, and infection.\n\n__SECOND__: You and your companions must be as one. Five strands of rope can withstand great force, a single yarn snaps at the lightest tug. You will be tempted, within the Labyrinth, to divide your numbers: this is the way of folly, for death will claim you one by one in the dark.\n\n__THIRD__: One among you must serve as chronicler and cartographer. This one should be equipped with stylus and tablet, and should keep a map of the Labyrinth as you delve into it, as well as maintaining a record of information obtained during the delve. Should you be forced to retreat, the information you obtain may ensure that subsequent delves are more successful.\n\n__FOURTH__: You must walk a narrow path between haste and indecision. Move too swiftly, and you will fail to perceive traps and threats that will slay you. Move too slowly, and the beasts that dwell within will corner and slay you. The wisest and most experienced among you should be the one to set the pace.\n\n__FIFTH__: When gambling, one must know when to withdraw from the table, and when to remain. Likewise, when you delve into a Labyrinth, you must know when to continue and when to turn back. There comes a time in every delve when one reaches a point of no return, and the only choice that remains is to press on to the conclusion. Pray that when that moment comes, your way home is not blocked to you.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Being a History of the Wonder’s Creation\nIn ancient days, there was --the Great Tyrant--, and the Empire, and the --Tyrant-- was served by the wisest of his men, the --Dardic Sorcerers--. Great was their power, and mighty their works, but the people of that Age had hearts full of fear, as a rich man fears the thief in the night.\n\nIt is said that in those days, there was [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1764|an enchanted mirror which could see into other worlds.]]] Many strange wonders and people could be seen in that //Otherworld//, but the --Dardics--, whose hearts were filled with fear, saw only enemies in the face of the mirror. And so it was that, as befits the nature of those foolish sages, the Empire girded themselves for war.\n\nIn their hubris and their pride, the --Dardics-- created the foulest magic ever conceived by mortal minds: The --Unspeakable Word--, whose very memory is cursed and brings misfortune and death upon those who know its name. It was to bring The --Unspeakable Word-- into the //Otherworld// that the --Dardics-- created the first Triliminal Gate.\n\nAlthough the --Unspeakable-- (and all knowledge of its making) was destroyed in the War of the Red Hand by **Our Lady**, the --Dardics-- have retained the secrets of the Triliminal Gates’ construction. It is known that the --Dardics-- utilize these lesser Triliminal Gates to travel into the //Otherworld// for the purposes of sowing death and slaughter. Such violations being hateful in the eyes of **Our Lady**, the destruction of a Triliminal Gate must be considered an unambiguous good.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ On the //Otherworld//, and its nature.\nThese are the things that we know about the //Otherworld//.\n\nThe Gods of //that place// hold little power compared to our own. Sunlight will not harm you there, for the Sun of //that world// never awoke to its hateful purpose.  However, **Her Dark Majesty** also has no power in //that place//: do not rely upon the shadows to shroud you in the //Otherworld//.\n\nMagic exists in that place, but in a far weaker state than in our own. Mages are few, work in secret, and rely on brute-force approaches. Those few of **our people** who have ventured into the //Otherworld// say that their magics would fail them: spells would not respond properly, and would often result in unanticipated side effects. Use only the least powerful of your magics in that place, and take care that your spells and fetishes do not work against you.\n\nNames still have power in that place, but not as great a power as they do in ours. You may speak the names of the --Gods-- there and not receive harm. The people of the //Otherworld// speak the names of power without fear, for the aether of that place flows weakly, if at all, and the wind does not carry the words they speak to their gods' ears.\n\nThe people of the //Otherworld// are not gods, nor are they beasts. They live, love, hate, and war just as we do, albeit at a much quicker pace, due to their greatly shortened lives. Do not make the mistake of thinking them other than people. Consider them fellow souls, to be shepherded and protected by those greater than they.\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ Forbidding the Utilization of the Wonder, and its consequences.\n**Our Lady** teaches that the weapons of --the enemy-- may be used against them, save one: **her** Edict of Forbiddance forbids passage into the //Otherworld// by any who follow her teachings.\n\nThere are three reasons for this.\n* __Reason the First__, our very presence in the //Otherworld// is harmful to //those who live there//. The brilliance of our souls manifests as a twisting in their very beings, searing //their// flesh, causing sickness, twisting their bodies, and cursing //their children and their children’s children//. **Our Lady** teaches us not to cause harm to the innocent. We refuse to be the cause of harm to those who have harmed us not.\n* __Reason the Second__, the actions of the --Dardics-- in the //Otherworld// has irrevocably broken the trust between our two peoples. On the few occasions that **our people** have entered the //Otherworld//, the result was violence against **our emissaries**. Many brave and kind souls fell to the //Otherworlders//’ poisoned darts and poisoned vapors, and each loss is a blade in the side of our shared people. **Our Lady** teaches us not to waste courage on fruitless endeavors. We refuse to throw away good bread into poisoned waters.\n* __Reason the Third__ the method of activating Triliminal Gates is a secret jealously guarded by the --Sorcerers--. Learning this secret requires delving deep into --their forbidden knowledge--, and risking becoming tainted by --their foul beliefs--. Wise minds attempting to delve the --Dardics--’ secrets have become twisted and broken by --basilisk patterns, glyphs of madness, and soul-render vapors--. **Our Lady** teaches us that there is some knowledge which the enlightened mind must be willing to leave unknown. We refuse the pursuit of knowledge at the cost of wisdom.\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++ A Final Rumination\nThe Triliminal Gates are key to the conflict between **She Who Guards From The Sunlight** and --He Who Devoured The Nine--. Their creation spurred the rift between **Our Lady** and --the Tyrant--. --The Tyrant-- believed that death and war between our worlds was inevitable. **Our Lady** believed that peace between our worlds was not only possible, but necessary.\n\nIn that mission, we have failed. Peace between our worlds is now impossible. Our mission now turns to the abatement of harm. For this reason, the final goal of our Covenant is the complete severing of ties between our world and the //Otherworld//.\n\nThis concludes the account of the Triliminal Gates used by the --Dardic Sorcerers--, their purpose, and the //Otherworld// that exists beyond that gateway.\n\nMay **Our Lady’s Red Right Hand** Guard Us All From --The Nameless One’s Wrath--.\n\nTHUS CONCLUDES THIS RECORD\n\n[[collapsible show=\"d̷̝̗͙͔̞͚̟͚͔̙̖̥͉̯̍́̂̔͒̃̂̾̀̋̐̾͌̕͝ͅo̵͉͙͎̘͇̰̯̹͉̦̺̙͙͛̈́̈́͐̆̀̀͒̉̐̃͠͠͠ͅ ̸̢͕̺͚͚͎̰͈͗̊̕ỵ̷̨͉̳̖̖͔͕̮͖̐ő̵̧̞͍͕̩̖̣̮̦̲̍̈̈́̓̈́͂̒͐̔͘͜u̶̧̥̮̹̎͛̊͆͜͠͠͝ ̸̜̫̹̻͖̠̜́́̔̀͑̇̈̄͝͝w̵̛͕̫̝̻͖̜̦̩͌̎͆̿́͐̚͜͝i̵̧̺͖̰͉̦̽̏̎̇̈̿̀̾͘̕̚̚͜s̵̺̱͓̟̉̀̉̿̔̉́̃͠͝h̷̡͚̼͙͓̟̲̥̿͛̇͗̆̐̈́̅͒́͌͊͐̀͝ͅ ̸͖̻̭̲̮͚͙̣̻̗͈͔͖͋͗̔̿̃͜t̸̨̖͔̞̞̱̹͈̲̭̼͎̫̫̤͙̋̽̂̇̒́̅͘͜ǫ̸̡̰̯̭̯̻̋́͗̈́͋̆̈́̚̚ ̸͙̳̦̖̫͕̞͉̺̹̅̽̾̿͛͛̅̑͊͘͘͜͠k̴̢̩̗̰͚͈̪͝͝͠n̵̨͈̘̝͍̈̀͜o̴̭͔͍̘̹̅͊̽̐̌͒̅̚̚͝͝w̵̥̭̗̮̲͓͈͓͙̼̹̹̝͗̀́͌̍̀̎̾̃̔̋͗̕͘̚ͅ ̵̳̞͍̻͍͔̼̟̗͕̦̭̑ͅm̵̻̫̝͓̻̮̹̞̊̑̃́ơ̸̡̟̠̺̋̏͘̚r̵̢̨̧̛̭̯͉͉̞̰̜̻̎́̃̿͛̉͝ë̸̹̣̝̣?̸̨̑̈́̎̾̇\" hide=\"You have Discovered Wisdom.\"]]\n\n[[table style=\"border: 0px solid silver; background-color: black;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8009/DARD.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8009/offset/3\"]]\n[[size large]]\n= ##red|GREETINGS, WAYWARD CHILDREN.##\n\n= ##red|I HAVE SECRETED THIS GLYPH INTO YOUR REBELLION'S RECORDS AS AN ESCAPE FOR THOSE WHO WERE DECEIVED BY THE TRAITOR'S LIES.##\n\n= ##red|DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO REMAIN BLIND.
