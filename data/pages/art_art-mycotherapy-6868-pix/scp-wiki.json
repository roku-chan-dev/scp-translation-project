I guess it just felt fitting for some reason? It's... probably something I arbitrarily decided based on the color scheme I picked out hahaha.\n\n Anyways I LOVE the kind of goofy fridge horror-type articles and this one definitely falls in that category. There's a backstory that's just implied yet despite never being told it, you can pretty easily read into it. A very quiet sort of upsettingness. Go read it!\n\nAlso Tstaffor, I was already in the planning phase for this one when you messaged me so I couldn't do the one you requested just yet ðŸ˜­. I will try and ALSO do the one you requested eventually! It's on my list right now. I love getting requests from authors plugging their work! \n\n(SCP-6868 is a re-write of an article by Cremo!)\n\n \n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
