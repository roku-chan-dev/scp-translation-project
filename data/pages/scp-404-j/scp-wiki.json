As such, Foundation personnel, combat task forces, and civilians may only come within 100 km of  SCP-404-J after signing a mortality waiver.\n\n**Description:** SCP-404-J is a 20 m x 50 m x 5 m brick wall in southern Iran, estimated to have been erected in 15,000 BCE. SCP-404-J is composed entirely of an unknown mineral that has proven extremely resistant to destruction.\n\nDespite its age, the inscriptions on SCP-404-J are completely in American English. The text of the inscription changes on an irregular basis. \n\nFurther information about SCP-404-J is restricted to the O5 Council.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Inscription as of 2/28/16 - 5/404-J clearance required\" hide=\"- encryption key accepted\"]]\n\n+ PLANET ERF!\n+++ by !Jehovah\n++ [ Rating: -5922 | + | - ]\n\n**Planet:** Erf!\n\n**Composition:** Mostly water also some other stuff!\n\n**Dominant Species:** Humans!\n\n**Other Information:** Look at my super cool planet!
