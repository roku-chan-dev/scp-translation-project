SEE LOG BELOW]\n\n**Description:** ##grey|SCP-4338 is a sapient, levitating,## ##blue|4.6km^^3^^## ##grey|sphere of volcanic rock inhabiting the magma chamber beneath Moaha Island. Multiple artifacts and oral traditions reference this entity as \"Ōsobiue\", \"Irn'acha\", or \"God of the Burning Ocean\": a central figure in the creation myths -- and extinction events -- of some 19 early oceanic cultures.##\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview & Event Log 19/08/2018 | Rowell / 4338\" hide=\"Interview & Event Log 19/08/2018 | Rowell / 4338\"]]\n\n> **Foreword:** Over the last 8 months, SCP-4338's requests have become progressively more extravagant, and their behavior more erratic. While speaking, Rowell / 4338 spit molten elements in all directions, necessitating a high-tensile Plexiglas divider, routinely replaced. Rocky growths across the epidermis have increased by 230%.\n> \n> **Interviewed:** Rowell / 4338\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Director Amelia Thornborrow\n>\n> ------\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** You asked to see me, 4338?\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** INSECT! DO YOU STILL NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO YOUR OWN GOD!?\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ... //Greetings//, oh 4 3 3 8. Your servant is honored to be called.\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** THAT IS BETTER. I HAVE NEW DEMANDS.\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ,,shocker,, I mean, your servant is honored to listen.\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** YOU WILL DELIVER UNTO ME THE RIBS OF YOUR GREAT DAIRY BEAST, TWICE IN NUMBER THAN LAST YOU OFFERED.\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Your ser-\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** AND MORE OF THE SOUR BAUBLES, COVERED IN SWEET DUST.\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Your serva-\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** AND THE YELLOW SPONGES FILLED WITH CREAM! MORE OF THOSE!\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ...\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** ...\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Your servant. I will go-\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** AND FIVE-FOLD THE DELICATE CADBURY, SWIRLING AND STUFFED WITH AMBER-\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Wait no, no we discussed this; those were imported chocolates from very far away. Remember, we agreed a lower quantity of higher quality food could ease the strain of our current shipping --\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** ENOUGH! YOUR \"STRAIN\" DOES NOT CONCERN ME. YOU WILL DO AS I COMMAND, OR YOU AND YOUR S C P WILL BURN!\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Look just-- you can't spring this on us three days before--\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** CAN'T? **CAN'T!?** YOU WOULD DARE TELL ME WHAT I CAN OR CAN NOT DO!? YOUR DEFIANCE WEARIES ME, AM EEL YA; I WILL SUFFER IT NO LONGER!\n\n------\n\n**DN-4338-42:** A 4.0 earthquake was recorded on Moaha Island. All personnel were evacuated to surrounding ships, moving away at high speed. As per protocol, Director Thornborrow remained on-site.\n\nSCP-4338 did not emerge after 45 minutes. Quakes became periodic rather than steady, occurring in small, violent jolts. Drone craft were dispatched to take low-pass video, revealing SCP-4338 repeatedly failing to exit the crater lip; unlike six months prior, it now lacked the appropriate speed and dimensions.\n\nSecurity Cruiser //Kingfisher// returned to the island shortly after, allowing Director Thornborrow to continue the interview.\n\n------\n \n> **Thornborrow:** 4338, your servant would ask why you didn't- er, \"execute\" your threat.\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** ...YOU AMUSE ME.\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Pardon?\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** YOU AMUSE ME, AM EEL YA. BY MY MERCY, YOUR LIFE MAY DWINDLE ON; BUT NEVER QUESTION ME AGAIN, OR YOU SHALL KNOW ONLY TORMENT AND DEATH!\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ... Well then, your servant is honored. Shall we continue?\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** YES. I DEMAND THE CADBURY-\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Actually, I was thinking now would be a good time to discuss a full overhaul of our current arrangement.\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** WHAT!?\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** A good 30% total reduction, along with a substitution of--\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** FILTH! DO YOU YEARN FOR DEATH SO DESPERATELY!?\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** --duced personnel and security, given only one person really needs --\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** ENOUGH! ENOUGH! **ENOUGH**!\n\n------\n\n**DN-4338-43:** Another earthquake was detected, now only 2.8. Security personnel present during the interview moved to evacuate, but Director Thornborrow signaled them to stop. SCP-4338 again failed to exit the crater. Versus previous events, only 5% of the molten rock was expelled.\n\n------\n\n> //Predictably, during DN-4338-43, Rowell/4338 was observed shouting, spitting, and wrenching against their restraints. This behavior lasted for 8 minutes, until Rowell/4338 became fatigued, and slumped over onto the floor.//\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ... Is that all?\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** WRETCH. YOU WOULD EVOKE MY ANGER YET A-\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Your servant has no wish to anger you, 4338. If you are displeased, then I and my people shall leave--\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** NO!\n> \n> //Rowell / 4338 sits bolt upright, attempting to pull themselves up by the table's edge, but only managing to stumble forward.//\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** NO! YOU CANNOT! YOU-- I DEMAND YOU... I... I demand...\n> \n> //Rowell / 4338 slowly lowers itself back down to the floor//\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** ... Are you ready to continue, 4338?\n> \n> //Rowell / 4338 remain prone and silent for 8 seconds, then speak into their folded arms.//\n> \n> **Rowell / 4338:** Yes.\n> \n> **Thornborrow:** Good. Now, about this overhaul?\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n++++ NOTICE: THE FILE YOU ARE CURRENTLY VIEWING IS OUTDATED AS OF 19/08/2018.\n----\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4338/offset/2 > UPDATE 01/07/2019 <]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
