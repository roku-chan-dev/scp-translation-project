SCP-4281-1's location is marked with a white arrow.|\n    width=300px\n]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4281\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The room containing SCP-4281 should remain locked and marked with an \"out of service\" sign.  Unauthorized individuals found trespassing within this area are to be questioned, then given Class-A amnestics. Two security personnel will remain on site at all times, posing as casino staff. Communication with SCP-4281-1 is forbidden outside of approved testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4281 is a lavatory stall located inside the first floor men's washroom of the Holy Roller casino, Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nSCP-4281-1 is a sapient entity residing inside this stall. Visual confirmation of SCP-4281-1 is only possible via the 20cm gap under the stall's walls/door. Viewing the interior of SCP-4281 by any other means reveals only an empty stall. If SCP-4281 is forcefully entered, either by bypassing the interior rotatory lock or simply breaking down the stall door, SCP-4281-1 will be entirely absent. Closing the door, or leaving the washroom unoccupied and unobserved for any period of time will cause SCP-4281-1 to re-appear. Due to this effect, SCP-4281-1 has only ever been observed as the calves of a white male, wearing white-red striped socks and blue-white 1995 Adidas Orion running sneakers. \n\nWhen an individual enters the stall directly adjacent to SCP-4281, within 10-15 seconds SCP-4281-1 will begin conversing with the occupant. SCP-4281-1 is described as having an up-beat, mild south-west American accent, and being prone to lengthy personal anecdotes, unsolicited advice, and long-winded opinions on current affairs. SCP-4281-1 will continue speaking regardless of response, or a lack thereof, often bridging natural pauses in discussion with phrases such as “That’s right, huh? Of course it is.”, “Another thing about that…”, and \"Heck, you know what that reminds me of?”\n\nWhile most often discussing mundane topics, SCP-4281-1 has, on rare occasions, demonstrated an insight into various anomalous subjects, including [http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-supplemental-thaumatology thaumatology] and hemogenic evocation. Additionally, SCP-4281-1 appears to possess a great deal of personal and classified information on the Foundation and several GOIs. Attempts at guiding the conversation towards these subjects has proven highly ineffective, as SCP-4281-1 seems unwilling or incapable of deviating from its chosen “discussions”. As such, the full scope of SCP-4281-1's knowledge, or how it is acquired, is currently unknown.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Test Log - SCP-4281-1-01\" hide=\"Test Log - SCP-4281-1-01\"]]\n\n> **Test Log - 4281-1-01**\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-4281-1\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. M.

So you are aware you're being recorded?\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** 'Course! I don't mind. Honestly, it's kinda flatterin'! Y'know, I once met a fella' who claimed he invented the tape recorder. The portable one, I mean. 'Course, his wasn't like those fancy little doohickeys you're using, no no. His was this big ol' backpack with long spools of- whatsitcalled- record tape. Anyway! He tried to sue Phillips when they started makin'-\n> \n> **Dr. Clarke:** I'm sorry, if I could ask you some-\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** -ttle tapes, y'know. But he, Carter I think his name was, he didn't trust lawyers, or the courts! Since, a'course, they were recording all the testimony by then.

Honestly, I think the explosion knocked some sense into him, cuz the next dang day he cracked the [DATA EXPUNGED] principle, y'know, when you combine [DATA EXPUNGED] with the Closed Third Circle, just like the //hemet-netjer// did back in ol' Nubia. Ta-da! New dog! He was just like the old one, except the eyes were all-\n> \n> **Dr. Clarke:** ... Hold on, what? You- hold on. Coms, did you get that? Yes. Yes I'm going to continue the test. SCP-4281-1, can you repeat that? Are you saying you're familiar with both [DATA EXPUNGED] and //Heka// blood rituals?  \n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Oh I'm heck-a sure I am! Hah! Just a little river-valley joke for ya. 'Course, you probably know those rituals are a messy business! 'Aint worth botherin' with, if you ask me.

The test was officially terminated at 5:56AM, roughly an hour after SCP-4281-1 began discussing its favorite types of bean salad.//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Test Log - SCP-4281-1-05\" hide=\"Test Log - SCP-4281-1-05\"]]\n\n> **Test Log - 4281-1-05**\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-4281-1\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Researcher O.

Oh, sorry there bud, what was that? Oh! Yeah! Hah! You know, that crazy ol' snake lady had hair kinda' like Bill's sister! All long and dark.

Williams.\n> \n> **Foreword:** The Holy Roller Casino was allowed to continue running normally during this test. The entrance to SCP-4281 was unlocked, and given the appearance of resumed public access. During the test, Foundation Security discretely warded people away from SCP-4281. Researcher Williams then entered the stall adjacent to SCP-4281-1. Researcher Williams was instructed to pose as a typical casino patron, and attempt a \"personable\" approach to gain information from SCP-4281-1.\n> \n> **<12:31AM ██/██/████ Begin Log>**\n> \n> //Researcher Williams enters the stall, and sits down. After a pause, SCP-4281-1 engages conversation.//\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Hey hey, doin’ alright in there bud?\n> \n> **Williams:** Oh, yeah! Having a great time tonight! Name’s Cam.\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Good to know ya’ Cam! You know, I met a Cam once, out in West Bank, had to be fifteen years-\n> \n> **Williams:** Oh hey, say, what’s your name?\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Ah I’m just an old rambler, but Cam, my Cam y’know, he was the kind of fella who-\n> \n> **Williams:** Oh yeah, hah, we all know a guy like that. We had lots of them back East. So where are you from?\n> \n> //Given previous conversations, Researcher Williams had been instructed to aggressively head off SCP-4281-1 to prevent a \"rant\", while still appearing friendly.//\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Wherever the wind takes me, you know how it is! Well, no, you don’t. You never even left Warrenton before all this! I guess that’s East of somethin’, all things relative, so I won’t call you a liar.\n> \n> **Williams:** I-… hah, you got me buddy. Caught my accent huh? I traveled West to get here so-\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Oh-ho-ho! Not bad! \"Never lie. A half-truth is much easier to swallow.\" Agent Porter would be proud!\n> \n> //Researcher Williams goes silent, awaiting instruction. Director Imani, his handler, tells him via earpiece to continue the test.//\n> \n> **Williams:** Alright, since you know who I work for, I'll stop with the pretense. Honestly though, I'm just here to chat. I want to get to know you! My name actually is Cam-\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** You hate bein’ called Cam. Always have. ‘Creepy Cam’.\n> \n> **Williams:** That-… what?\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** That’s what they used to call ya, right? ‘Creepy Cam’. Hah! Not very creative. Then again Matt never was the thinkin’ type. Big though. Big, mean, held back two years, Daddy always givin' him the belt. He took that out on you, the little bastard. Him and his gang.\n> \n> **Williams:** Yes- well, I’m sure you’ve got plenty of stories abo-\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** ‘Creepy Cam’, always reading those big old books, dressing in black, drawing strange little doodles in his notebook. Smart as a whip, didn’t even need to try. Matt resented that, y’know. The guidance counselor was right, he was jealous! 'Course, knowing that didn't stop him from shovin' you in a trash can. That wasn't so bad though. Now mouthin’ off about your Ma, that was the worst. Even Matt regrets that. He didn't know, y'know? He didn't know she'd gotten sick. He feels bad about crossing that line, even today. He even apologizes to you in his sleep, then wakes up with wet eyes.\n> \n> **Williams:** L-… Listen, could we talk about something else? I don’t think-\n> \n> //SCP-4281-1 creates a thumping sound against the dividing wall, three open-palm slaps.//\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Ah cmon, buck up! It got better, right?

I thought we were getting to know each other!\n> \n> //Researcher Williams exits the stall. SCP-4281-1 is heard shouting.//\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Hey, cmon Cam- er, Cameron!

Director Imani reiterates that the test has ended.//\n> \n> **SCP-4281-1:** Not surprising, y'know. He never was quite as clever as you. Kind, though. Real kind. Sat with you on that first day, introduced you to everyone, even taught you how to kick the vending machine just right for a free soda! Good man, good man. Doesn't deserve what's happening to him, no sir.\n> \n> **Williams:** What do you mean \"happening\". Lawrence is... he's dead.\n> \n> //Director Imani tells Researcher Williams not to divulge any additional information.
