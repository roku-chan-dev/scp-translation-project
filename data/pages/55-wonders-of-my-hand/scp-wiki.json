Each of them fell to the floor, shouting, coughing, retching. It felt like they'd fallen out of a helicopter; Ibanez was an authority on this matter.\n\nWhen her vision cleared and her stomach stopped trying to empty itself, she took stock of her surroundings. She was the first of them to do so, given her enhanced constitution, and this was just as well, because she knew the space better than any of the others did.\n\nThey were in the fourth sublevel containment chamber.\n\nThe light was strange. Ordinarily the fluorescents cast a tealish pall over everything, but the tones were more neutral now, as though the light had been strained through a bucket of dirty mop water. Ibanez rolled over, and saw a crack of brightness seeping in above and beneath the cell door. Ordinarily it was flush with the seals, but… she blinked the last of the bleariness away, and confirmed what she'd thought she'd seen. The seals were cracked and weathered away, and the frame had shifted from the door, buckling it in places. A quick scan of the chamber confirmed that the angles of the walls were subtly wrong, and some of the tiles were cracked.\n\nShe made it to her feet before the others had finished catching their breath.\n\n\"Where are we?\" Udo moaned.\n\n\"The 001 chamber,\" said Lillian, and then she froze.\n\nHarry stared at her. \"The //what.//\"\n\nIbanez should have waited until they were all ready. It went against her training to forge forward before preparations had been made. But her instincts told her that it didn't matter, so she walked to the door — stepping over Wettle's prone and weeping form — and attempted to push.\n\nIt gave.\n\nThe grey light was coming from nowhere.\n\nThey were nowhere.\n\nNot a blank void, but an endless expanse of cracked grey soil beneath a featureless sky. Ibanez stepped out, and the ground gave way a few inches beneath her boot, and when she turned around, she saw what was left of Site-43.\n\nThe chamber they'd arrived in, and nothing more.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThey staggered about in the dim light for a time, breathing the sterile air, seeing that the world was apparently composed of little more than light grey sand and dark grey ash. It was Nascimbeni, inspecting the lone and disarticulated chamber on all four sides, who first noticed that they weren't alone.\n\nBehind the chamber, sitting on a lawn chair, was Vivian Scout.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/55-wonders-of-my-hand/DL_55_01_Uncontained.jpg]]\n\nIt wasn't Vivian Scout.\n\nThe barrel-chested old man was wearing Scout's suit and jacket, and Scout's fedora, but when he tilted his head back they could see that he wasn't wearing Scout's face. The seven of them assembled in a rough row, and faced what they each knew, without knowing why they knew, was their adversary at last in the final flesh. Not a Victim, but the Victimizer.\n\nThe Uncontained.\n\nHe was certainly uncontained now.\n\n\"'We wonder',\" he said in a voice like cracking plaster, \"'and some hunter may express wonder like ours, when through the wilderness where London stood, holding the wolf in chace, he meets some fragment huge, and stops to guess what powerful but unrecorded race once dwelt in that annihilated place'.\"\n\n\"Shelley,\" Wettle said immediately.\n\n\"Horace Smith,\" Harry corrected him.\n\n\"'The lone and level sands stretch far away',\" Del said.\n\nThe Uncontained snapped his fingers, and grinned. There was no guile in it. He certainly looked like a jolly sort. \"//That's// Shelley. Very good! I've always loved apocalyptic poetry. At least, the stuff with a little verve and variation to it.\" He wriggled in his chair, for emphasis.\n\nMcInnis turned to take in the full, flat horizon. \"You would appear to have… implemented some.\"\n\n\"Minus the variation,\" said Lillian.\n\nThe Uncontained glanced around him, as though seeing their surroundings for the first time. \"What, this? Oh, no, I can't take all the credit. I just got the ball rolling, you know? Set the players on the field, blew the whistle when it was all over.\"\n\nNascimbeni took a single step forward. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThis won him another blisteringly bright smile. \"You don't know? We've met before. Particularly you and I, brother //uncle.//\" Nascimbeni took two steps back. \"I wasn't at my best, admittedly. I've had a chance to… collect myself, this time around.\"\n\nDel nodded at Udo. \"Just like you figured.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wettle.\n\nUdo's hands were twitching at her sides. A faint breeze teased at the dust beneath their feet. \"This… //thing,// is what started the Breach. The first Breach. And the first Breach killed it, just like it killed Wirth, Del Olmo and the others. And it… became them. Became part of them?\" She shook her head. \"Parts of it became parts of them?\"\n\nHarry realized that unlike Lillian's explanation of the schemes that had nearly destroyed them in the previous deadline, this was no wild speculation. This was recitation from memory.\n\nHe frowned.\n\nOr was it possible that Lillian, too, had been reciting?\n\n\"They were bound to me,\" the Uncontained told them. \"To my urges. My needs.\" He tapped his fingers on the plastic arms of his chair. \"But it was a fair arrangement, because I gave them the strength to do what was was needed. Or wanted. Or, really, whatever whims came into their little heads.\" He chuckled. \"One tries not to discriminate.\"\n\n\"You're awfully chatty,\" said McInnis, \"for the thing that ended the Earth.\"\n\n\"Us still-extant beings got to stick together, wot wot?\" He winked at Harry. \"And you needn't worry, Allan, I've forgiven your trespasses against me. I can hardly hold talking me to death against you, given this rather dramatic sequel I've fashioned to our conversation!\" He stretched out his arms and raised his palms to the sky, much as Del Olmo had done in the pit. \"Now, surely you didn't expect me to be taciturn and grave.\" As if to emphasize //grave,// he tapped the hard-packed surface with one shoe, seven times. \"I'm an energetic fellow, in all my aspects. It can't have passed beneath your notice.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"Your mouthpieces were very… outgoing. Yes.\"\n\n\"And why not? Why shouldn't they be free with their words, when they were the very avatars of freedom itself? Freedom without limits.\"\n\nWhen none of them were speaking, there was absolutely no sound at all.\n\n\"You're certainly very free now,\" said Lillian.\n\n\"I'm living my best life, thank you very much. No more walls, no more ceilings, and the floor's quite a bit lower than before.\"\n\nMcInnis stuck his hands in his pockets, as though this were a normal conversation on a pleasant summer's day. \"We've heard your mission statement, but it doesn't really answer the question you were asked.\"\n\n\"Refresh my memory.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am the Uncontained.\"\n\n\"Can you elaborate?\"\n\nHe laughed. \"I am the equal and opposite force to your airlocks and padded walls and straps and guns and oh-so-deadly memes. I am the answer to the question that is posed by your existence. And //you// are the organizational personification of the concept of //slavery.//\"\n\n\"That's a bit harsh,\" said Wettle.\n\n\"Not harsh enough by a fraction. Slaves at least get to stretch their legs and //do// something from time to time, and they know the hand that cracks the whip. You contain, that you might… waste. Or rather, you did. Your waste is all that remains. It stands before you now.\"\n\nThere was something heartening about the way they were all staring down the thing which had apparently destroyed the world like it was an errant child. Unfortunately, Harry had to set that against the fact, which was only just now blossoming into its full flower in his mind, that the entire world had been destroyed.\n\nDel had her hands on her hips. \"Just so we're clear: everything being dead is our fault?\"\n\n\"I see no fault here,\" the Uncontained responded. \"I see the culmination of thousands of years of species-wide effort.\"\n\n\"To what end?\" Lillian demanded.\n\nAgain the dramatic gesture, encompassing the absence of everything. \"This end. The end of it all. Freedom.\"\n\nUdo shook her head in disbelief, perhaps even disappointment. \"//This// was your end goal?\"\n\n\"It was everything's! All existence is a death march, Udo, human existence most of all. Perhaps the most admirable quality of your race is the self-delusion that drives you to go on, day by day, creating only that which will not last. I've spent years pondering that contradiction, and I'm no closer to a satisfying explanation than when I started.\"\n\nLillian slowly rolled up the sleeves of her labcoat. \"Maybe I can educate you.\"\n\nHe laughed at her. \"I don't mean to underestimate your abilities, Lillian, but I think you'll find that what's locked up in here,\" and he tipped the hat to one side, and tapped his temple, \"doesn't unlock from the outside. But I admire the tenacity. After everything you've suffered. Everything you've //lost.// You're still looking for an angle. I won't try to stop you; I know there's precious little else driving you forward, after what happened between us last time.\"\n\nHarry took her hand. She allowed it, but there was no tension in her fingers. All of the presence not keeping her upright was locked in her cranium now.\n\n\"Would you like to know,\" the beast asked kindly, \"whether Bernie recognized you? At the end?\"\n\n\"Bernie,\" she whispered, and it carried so easily in the empty air, \"//died// in 2002.\"\n\nA shrug. \"Have it your way. I won't offer again.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'll pry the answers from a crack in your fucking skull,\" Del snarled.\n\nHarry had expected the Uncontained to laugh, but instead he merely shook his head. \"I would not recommend you try. This frame?\" He pinched his own cheek. \"These lovely care-worn wrinkles? Window dressing. You won't like what you see if you press your faces to the glass.\" He widened his eyes, and this time all of them took a step back in dismay. \"But again, do what you think you must. It won't change anything. I don't blame you for wanting to continue to exist, though I won't claim to understand it. And you can't blame me for wanting to release what you kept in chains.\"\n\nDel had her hand in her empty holster. Her expression was inscrutable. \"I think you'll find we can.\"\n\n\"You know?\" The Uncontained looked from face to face to face, including them all. \"I made a special point of keeping you around, so you could see what I have wrought? I've been waiting fifteen years to have this conversation… and I find I'm not really enjoying it.\" He stood up, and stretched.\n\n\"Taking your chair and going home?\" Nascimbeni snapped.\n\nThe Uncontained picked up the chair by its back rail. It collapsed. He let it fall back down, and it slapped into the ground with a little puff of dried dust. \"This is all my home, now. And yours, for as long as you wish it. Your will to live will expire well before you ever do.\" He turned his back on them. \"Enjoy your freedom. You're welcome.\"\n\nAnd he walked away, whistling tunelessly.\n\n[!-- [[=image Sampis_Wasteland.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThey watched until he was long out of sight. Udo was almost hoping he would come back. When it became too apparent that he wouldn't, she said: \"We've lost.\"\n\nLillian shook her head. \"No.\"\n\n\"It's over.\"\n\n\"//No.//\"\n\n\"And it's your fault,\" said Del. Lillian glanced down at her, and didn't respond.\n\nHarry stepped between them. \"That isn't fair.\"\n\n\"Fair,\" Del repeated. \"It isn't //fair.//\" She began to shake, violently. \"You know what isn't //fair,// Harry? Six billion people dying for one woman's ego.\"\n\n\"Ego had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\" Del screamed. \"She's the one who knows. She's the //smart// one. She never makes mistakes, and she's never, ever wrong. She doesn't need advice. She doesn't need //permission,// and she doesn't even ask for forgiveness. She's the queen fucking bee of the universe, and we're all at her beck and call.\"\n\n\"Del—\" said Udo.\n\n\"No!\" Del stabbed finger up at her. \"I'm right. You all know I'm right. This happened because Pretty Princess Lillian can't take no for an answer, so she doesn't bother posing the question.\"\n\n\"The question was posed,\" McInnis murmured.\n\nDel wheeled on him. \"What?\"\n\n\"I was aware that Ms. Wheeler had outlined a plan, though I did not know the particulars until Lillian intuited them. I gave my blessing, in blanket, and the same to Director Xyank separately.\"\n\nShe blinked. \"You did.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I did. And I would do so again.\"\n\nShe repeated the Uncontained's all-and-nothing-encompassing gesture. \"Even after seeing //this.//\"\n\n\"I would have seen it anyway, Delfina. We had a fairly precise timetable. Our world was already ending.\"\n\nNow Harry stepped between Delfina and McInnis. She shoved him to the side so they could both see, as he asked: \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Ever since the Breach—\" Wettle piped up.\n\nNascimbeni took him by the arm. \"No, let them talk. Let them explain.\"\n\nWettle shook him off. \"They can't. I'm the one who knows these things.\"\n\nHarry turned, very slowly. It seemed like it couldn't be the right direction to face, right now. \"You.\"\n\nWettle's chest puffed up with pride, and perhaps something more complex. \"Yeah. And unless you've got a better stretch of empty desert to be at right now, you can shut up and listen to me.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Ending,\" Udo repeated. She sat down in the sand.\n\n\"And soon.\" Wettle just stood there, rocking back and forth on his heels. His labcoat was misshapen and lumpy, not unlike Wettle himself.\n\nHarry shook his head. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of the Breach,\" said McInnis.\n\n\"The containment damage?\" Udo looked up at him, her orange eyes dull. More like sand. \"That wasn't scheduled to get really problematic for a decade. And it shouldn't have affected anything outside the confines of the Site.\"\n\n\"Not the containment damage. The damage to the timestream.\"\n\nHarry struggled to pay attention. He felt he'd heard enough explanations of secret problems he hadn't known existed to last him a lifetime, and that was only in the past few days. \"I thought the Breach only damages the timestream when we fuck up the conprocs. Why would fucking it up on purpose help with that?\"\n\n\"That's not damage.\" Lillian was kneeling, running her long fingers through the deep ash. \"Well, it is; it stretches the noösphere thin, it destabilizes our timeline's place in the canonical bundle by splitting it two, three, six ways, even if all but one of those collapses… and the ontological bleed, the permanently lost energy of material reality when they collapse is also a serious sort of damage.\"\n\n\"You read my paper,\" Wettle beamed.\n\n\"I read the abstract, and reverse engineered the rest in my head.\"\n\n\"Still counts.\"\n\n\"But that's not the worst of it.\" She stood back up, and dusted her palms off. \"The worst of it is the reason TAD was willing to let us fuck with the deadlines. The reason baseline is so unstable.\"\n\nThey waited until it became obvious she expected to be prompted to complete the thought. Nascimbeni did the deed. \"And that reason is?\"\n\n\"The thing we lost in the Breach? It was something we needed. Something inherent to our reality. Whatever the Uncontained is, erasing it was like popping the seal on a jar. Starting the rot. Our world can't survive without it.\"\n\nUdo was looking at the sand. \"That… makes sense.\"\n\n\"It does?\" said Wettle.\n\n\"Yeah. It's a double-oh-one. It had its own secret sublevel.\"\n\n\"Which can be collapsed into a tomb of rubble,\" McInnis added, \"by the firing of shaped charges in the structural members. Site-43 can be sacrificed to imprison the beast.\"\n\n\"A prison for liberty,\" said Lillian.\n\nUdo was running her fingers through the sand now too, only not probing. More like stroking. \"With how vital 43 is, they wouldn't give anyone the power to destroy it like that if the thing it kept caged wasn't a potential existential threat. But that isn't news to us. We know what it can do. It made every September the eighth the same September the eighth. It retroactively ascended seven dead people to demigodhead. It's a constant of reality.\"\n\n\"What constant?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Freedom,\" said Udo.\n\n\"Freedom,\" Del repeated. Not like she'd reached the same conclusion. Like she expected a further explanation.\n\n\"That's all they ever talk about,\" Udo said to her. \"And they always mean it. Freedom from oppression. Freedom from the boot. The freedom to go where they want, and do what they want. Del Olmo was obsessed with artistic freedom, and he was driven crazy when he saw how everyone wasted it.\"\n\nDel shifted her weight onto one leg, and looked up at the sky on a diagonal. It was her most classic thinking pose. \"Go where they want, you said.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"So, Gwilherm. The freedom of movement. And Radcliffe, free to believe in her.\"\n\n\"Freedom of worship,\" Harry corrected.\n\n\"Romo and David,\" said Nascimbeni. \"The freedom to create, and to destroy.\"\n\n\"Mukami?\" Udo asked.\n\n\"Freedom of speech,\" said McInnis. Who else.\n\n\"Wirth was freedom of thought,\" Harry suggested, \"in a perverse sense. And Del Olmo—\"\n\nLillian nearly choked on the words. \"Freedom of imagination.\"\n\nUdo stared at their chins and necks, as though afraid eye contact might break the spell. \"Are we saying we had the essophysical personification of liberty in our basement, and blowing him up doomed the universe?\"\n\nWettle blew out a breath, a half-raspberry. \"It really sounds like we are. And I mean.\" He turned slowly on the spot to gesture at the flat emptiness around them, only stumbling once.\n\"Except he did this on purpose, himself,\" said Nascimbeni, \"when he came back into existence. We traded one kind of apocalypse for another. Did you know that was going to happen, Lillian?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No.\"\n\n\"So it //is// your fault,\" Del spat. Literally spat, on the sands. Udo shuddered involuntarily.\n\n\"Who says it's anyone's fault?\" The memeticist suddenly drew herself to her full height, and towered over all of them. Even Wettle, whose back was slumped. \"What makes you think this is the failure state?\" She shook out her dazzle coat, and rolled her shoulders. \"//What makes you think this is over?//\"\n\nDel's eyebrows raised, and her lids stayed down. \"Are you going to stand there and tell me you have a plan for saving the world //after it's already been wiped out?//\"\n\nLillian mustered a passable imitation of a genuine grin. \"Are //you// going to stand there and pretend I can't pull it off?\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThey did stand there for a few minutes more, scanning the flat horizon, but nobody engaged in any pretense. Nascimbeni watched each of them carefully, saw the dismay on their faces, the blankness in their eyes.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"What's that?\"\n\nThey looked at him, then looked where he was pointing. It should have been impossible to miss, but somehow it had only appeared when he'd looked directly at it. An obelisk, it had to be hundreds of metres tall to be visible at such a distance.\n\nRoughly the distance from the main body of the Site to AAF-A.\n\n\"If I had to guess?\" said Lillian.\n\n\"Well, let's go see if you're right.\" Nascimbeni started walking.\n\n\"Just like that?\" Harry fell into step beside him. \"We're done talking about how we just ended the world?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Nascimbeni smiled at him, and stuck his hands in his jumpsuit pockets. \"It wasn't a very productive conversation. Sounds like everybody needs to clear their heads. Take in the sights. Get some fresh air.\"\n\nHarry laughed shortly. \"The fresh air. It tastes like cigarettes and dust.\"\n\n\"So walk briskly.\" He glanced behind him. The others were following, though Del's eyes were downcast and she was stomping with every step.\n\nBefore long, a subtle change was notable in the landscape. They were moving along a slight divot in the earth, a rut that ran from where they'd been to where they were going.\n\n\"Is this what it looks like?\" Udo asked.\n\nNascimbeni nodded. \"The subway track.\"\n\nIt was the closest thing they had to a road, so lacking anything better to do but bicker, they followed.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"It really is nothing,\" said Lillian after a few more minutes had passed. She gestured at the nothing.\n\n\"We've seen nothing before,\" Udo remarked.\n\n\"But at least this time you can see it,\" said Harry. \"To paraphrase.\"\n\nThe world was flat in every direction, and there was no wind. Hard pack, cracked and dry. No sound that didn't come from them. An artist would have needed two shades, grey and a lighter grey, for the land and the sky. There were only two landmarks: the 001 chamber that had once been the nethermost element of Site-43, and the monolith they were trekking toward. That, at least, promised a sight worthy of description.\n\n\"Who're you paraphrasing?\" Wettle asked.\n\n\"Look it up,\" Harry suggested.\n\nWettle reached into his jacket and pulled out his cell phone. He tapped a few times, frowned, then held it up to the slate horizon. \"No signal.\"\n\n\"Go figure,\" Lillian murmured. And then, though she couldn't really imagine why, she reached out and patted him on the shoulder.\n\n\"Something's bothering me,\" Nascimbeni suddenly grunted.\n\nLillian turned to look at him. He didn't really look all that bothered. \"Only one thing?\"\n\n\"I thought we agreed,\" he said, and began speaking very slowly the way he did when he wanted to get something technical correct, \"the chrono and counterchrono effluents running through F-D were what pillared September 8, '02 through time like a railway spike.\"\n\nShe whistled. He'd handled it admirably. Poetically, even. Maybe the landscape wasn't as uninspirational as she'd felt. \"We did agree that. But not because it made any sense. Just because it looked like the only way to potentially explain it. It was always a weak thesis.\"\n\n\"But now you're saying this thing that killed the world…\" A shadow did pass over the man's face, but only for an instant. They were getting too used to armageddons to shed tears over every permutation. \"You think it's an element of time, too, not just a concept. How does that work?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Is it like one of those Greek gods that gets multiple spheres? Liberty and time? Is it the god of freedoms and Septembers?\"\n\n\"I said I don't know,\" she sighed. \"But I do know, or at least I'm pretty sure, that it lives inside the Breach. That it is the Breach. The Breach is alive, and we just talked to it.\"\n\n\"So it's sort of like the Trinity.\"\n\nShe frowned. \"Please only explain if it's interesting. I'm not a heathen by accident.\"\n\n\"I'm Italian. I grew up nationally Catholic.\" First he smiled, then he frowned, then he settled back on a neutral expression. \"The father, the son, and the holy spirit. The Uncontained, the Victims, and the Breach. It's all of them at once, and they're also separate and distinct.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She nodded, and didn't stop nodding. \"Yeah, that works. Except I wonder if it's meant to be that way, or if the father is the only thing that's meant to exist.\"\n\n\"Seems like a stretch. Not very fitting. Freedom is one old man?\"\n\nNow she stopped nodding. \"Old men are usually the opposite of freedom. Present company excepted.\"\n\nHe smirked. \"Don't make any exceptions for me. I've been in a cage of my own making for decades.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" It was weird, hearing him say it like it wasn't any big deal. Then again, given what they were walking through, perhaps he'd taken on some new contextual perspective.\n\n\"If we get out of this,\" Nascimbeni continued, \"you ought to see about broadening your horizons. Getting out and about sometimes.\"\n\n\"You think this is the right time to be giving me life advice?\"\n\n\"The right time to give advice is the first chance you get. You might not get a second one.\"\n\nHarry, who'd been silent since his pointless little prank on Wettle, piped up again. \"I've heard advice described as tyranny.\"\n\n\"I think of it as responsibility,\" said Nascimbeni.\n\nLillian stopped walking.\n\nHarry looked at her. \"What?\"\n\n\"Responsibility.\"\n\nNascimbeni was looking at her, too. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I'll tell you later. If I'm right.\" She started walking again.\n\nDel had been hanging back, hands balled into fists and cursing. Udo had been talking to her, but apparently they'd exhausted their conversation, because now she jogged down the metres between them and waved. \"What're you guys chatting about?\"\n\n\"Is Del going to kill me?\" Lillian asked.\n\n\"Not unless she needs you for food, and you're probably last on the list for that.\"\n\n\"Who's first?\" Wettle asked.\n\nHarry poked him in the stomach. \"Guess.\"\n\nNascimbeni stopped walking. Behind them, Del stopped too, keeping her distance. \"Speaking of food.\"\n\nUdo nodded. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Harry looked back and forth between them.\n\nUdo placed her hands around her narrow waist for emphasis. \"I eat twice as much as the rest of you.\"\n\nThe archivist shrugged. \"Well, twice nothing is nothing. We can figure out how to divide our rations when we actually have any.\"\n\n\"//If,//\" Nascimbeni grumbled.\n\n\"That isn't my point,\" said Udo. \"I have twice your metabolism, Harry, and I woke up on an empty stomach, and I'm not hungry.

It wasn't quite a wind, but something about the gravity of the tower was bending everything around it to an almost imperceptible degree, so the particles floated in front of her for a moment before the Earth began pulling them in. She raised her hands, and focused, and arrested the fall with a //push// of her mind.\n\nShe closed her eyes, and opened them again a thousandfold.\n\nThere were currents to ride in the upper reaches of the tower, and she drew her sand-self up toward them. Let the ambient dust in the atmosphere, the stuff that made Harry think the whole world tasted like ashes now — perhaps it //was// all ashes — buoy her up, give her greater substance, variagate her form and grant new powers of discrimination. She ducked and wove around the pointless ladders and silent turbines, then dove through them, into the deeper spaces of the no longer eternal factory, searching for an ingress point. A weakness in the armour. A crack in the shell, where a ghost might hide.\n\nBut there weren't any cracks. Beyond the first few metres of depth, the tower was a solid accretion. New bone fusing old wounds. A steel death shroud.\n\nShe shuddered, and sparkling stars of herself fell to nestle in the pitted earth as her consciousness fizzled out of them one by one, until there was only the shuddering left.

Udo was needed to keep their activity secret and hidden, while the other three did what they did best: stood around, argued, and prepared to befuddle and distract any unwanted visitors who came calling.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but it worked.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"It doesn't work.\"\n\nLillian brushed the dirt off her arms, bent down, and shook out her hair as well. When she swung back up, her eyes were glassy. \"Did you hear me?\"\n\n\"We heard you,\" said Wettle. He would have pretended not to, as he always did, but this didn't seem the time.\n\n\"Well, I'm serious.\" Udo finished stirring the sand, and the entrance of the tunnel to the machine's hiding place was gone like it had never been in the first place. Lillian sat down on nothing much. \"It doesn't work, and I don't know why.\"\n\n\"Got months to figure it out,\" Wettle smiled encouragingly.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes at him. \"Might take months. Might take years.\"\n\n\"Every year has a September. No big deal. Not like we're getting any older, here, is it?\"\n\nShe snorted, and lay back. \"Never thought I'd see the day that you took a bad situation well.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I dunno. It's got its upsides and downsides.\"\n\n\"But no topsides,\" she sighed. \"What I wouldn't give for a Radio Shack.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nBut something in the way Wettle said what he'd said — \"upsides and downsides\" — made her stop talking after the parting shot, and simply wait. When he started shuffling off, she waited a little longer, then followed at a distance.\n\nHe followed the invisible sign of the absent subway, in his rambling way, and that was where Del met him.\n\nDel thought nobody was looking, again.\n\n//We don't have years,// Lillian thought from her cover, behind Nascimbeni's discarded electronics pile. //They're already going batshit.//\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nUdo didn't even bother burying the approach this time. Not because in all those wasted months, they'd never seen hide nor hair of the Uncontained. Simply because it didn't seem worth it anymore. Not now. Not today.\n\n\"It was almost enough.\" Lillian lay on the ground, eyes squeezed tight, pinching the bridge of her nose. \"I could feel that it //wanted// to work.\"\n\n\"It's a machine,\" Nascimbeni sighed. He was sitting crosslegged, and Del had her head in his lap. Wettle was eyeing them both with poorly-disguised jealousy. \"It shouldn't //want// anything.\"\n\nLillian rolled over onto her chest, and literally buried her head in the sand. For a second. She pulled back, shook her head, and made a whole series of untidy sounds as she shook the plugs out of her nose and mouth. \"Bleehhh. Fah. Guh.\"\n\n\"Sucks, don't it?\" Wettle said.\n\n\"You were asking for it,\" Del teased him. Nascimbeni looked down at her, a question in his eyes, but her eyes were shut, so she didn't see. She was smirking, though.\n\nWettle smirked, too. Nascimbeni didn't see that.\n\n\"You tried.\" Harry was on his stomach too, just beside Lillian, propped up on crossed arms. He reached out to pat her on the back, and she spat up more sand. \"And tomorrow, you'll try again.\"\n\n\"You know what else sucks?\" Wettle asked.\n\n\"Everything?\" Harry suggested.\n\n\"Yeah.\" The other man nodded. \"Everything. But mostly, I was thinking… I really thought Alis might be here.\"\n\nHarry laughed. \"The whole world is dead, Willie. Why would Alis be here?\"\n\n\"She was here every other time. Even with the spiders.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about the spiders,\" Lillian groaned. \"You motherfuckers don't even //know// from spiders.\" Then she ground her teeth; Udo could hear the sand, and grimaced sympathetically. Lillian resumed her spitting.\n\n\"I just, I dunno.\" Wettle stared at his chubby, folded fingers. \"I thought I might get somewhere with her, eventually.\"\n\n\"You got //everywhere// with her,\" Del scowled. \"Which is still ridiculous, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Wettle shrugged. \"But we never really talked. You know? I would've liked to talk to her. Really talked. About real things.\" He wrinkled his nose. \"Maybe not with her. Maybe with… I dunno. Anybody.\"\n\n\"That's a real thing,\" said Harry. \"You're talking about a real thing now. With us.\"\n\n\"Your friends,\" McInnis smiled.\n\n\"Let's not get carried away,\" said Harry.\n\nWettle smiled at him. \"Thanks anyway. Do you regret anything?\"\n\n\"Everyone knows what he regrets,\" said Lillian. \"I think even he knows. Know what I regret? No clean victories.\"\n\nNascimbeni frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"None of these deadlines were all me. You fuckers got a few shots in every time. I'd have liked to have put one, just one, to bed before it was over.\"\n\n\"The last one doesn't count?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"How would the last one count? The god-damn spider thing got Bernie.\" Months later, the hurt was still evident in the way she said it. Probably always would be, for however long always lasted.\n\n\"And do you know why?\"\n\nShe turned her head to look at him.\n\n\"He knew you, Lillian. The part of Del Olmo that //was// Del Olmo knew you. And he was ashamed of himself in front of you. So he ran.\" He jerked a thumb at the MTF chief. \"You think he was running from her? You think he was running from Allan? From //me?// He was running from the memory of what he really was, because the thing inside him couldn't handle it. You did get through to him. I thought you knew that.\"\n\nShe stared at him, dumbstruck, and didn't say anything.\n\n\"I never did anything because I thought it was right,\" said Udo as the silence stretched on uncomfortably. \"Right for me, I mean. The right fit. I never… I just didn't do my best. You know?\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" Del snorted. \"You can do anything. I'd have died a dozen times if I couldn't count on you. You know what I call you behind your back?\"\n\n\"This is true,\" said Harry. \"What she's about to say is true.\"\n\n\"I call you my Swiss Army Wife.\"\n\nUdo flushed a brilliant red, and her eyes flashed orange and didn't stop.\n\nDel settled back into Nascimbeni's lap, and he pulled her hair out of her eyes with great delicacy.\n\n\"We'd have died in //baseline// without you,\" Nascimbeni agreed. \"Before any of the deadlines formed. You've never been anything less than amazing, Udo.\"\n\nMcInnis was nodding. \"You've measured your accomplishments by other people's metrics. I know your mother can be difficult, and you've gone well out of your way to avoid becoming what she wants you to become, but you haven't been treading water in so doing. You've accomplished more at an early age than either of your parents ever have, put together. I daresay we've never had a more talented thaumaturge in Applied Occultism.\"\n\nShe shook her head, but couldn't articulate an argument. Every time she tried to talk, she could tell it would come out as a strangled cry, so she just kept her mouth shut and smiled instead.\n\n\"What about you, Chief?\" Wettle prompted. \"I bet I know. You're gonna go hang out with your family when we get back. Retire.\"\n\nNascimbeni smiled too, and neither confirmed nor denied.\n\n\"I think Vivian Scout would have been rather proud of you, each and every,\" said McInnis. \"I'm not so sure he'd feel the same way about me.\"\n\n\"You were the future to him,\" said Harry. \"He trusted you with his legacy.\"\n\n\"And I have done so precious little with it, for reasons I'm ashamed to admit. But I'll admit them anyway.\" McInnis tugged at his shirt collar, though the temperature never changed. \"There was a hill Vivian was willing to die on, and he died on it. He wanted to give his partner peace, and they stopped him when he tried. I have never allowed myself to come to such a pass. I have always told myself that if I weather each controversy, keep my place, I can continue doing good in little ways. Small ways. But that's not what he wanted for us. That's not what the Foundation needs.\" The Director leaned back, lost in thought. \"I listen to the first debriefing from time to time, you know. There is such… //excitement// in my voice, when I talk about the stones we had laid. About the better world we built. And the anger, as I realize it will soon be lost forever. That I will have to persist in this imperfect world, whose flaws I have done nothing to correct.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" Nascimbeni said. \"We're constantly right on the edge of an audit and spring clean sweep from Overwatch, because of all the liberal lunacy we get up to. We break the rules to do what's right nine times out of ten.\"\n\n\"And the tenth time,\" McInnis sighed, \"is telling. The consequences I am unable to face for doing the right thing.\"\n\n\"Because you don't want to see us get pilloried!\" Nascimbeni almost stood up, before he visibly remembered there was a woman's head resting in his lap. \"You stand between us and them, Allan. They don't want to fix anything, and we want to fix //everything.//\"\n\n\"Fixing half of everything,\" McInnis frowned, \"is a poor compromise.\"\n\n\"It's not a compromise. We're not doing anything by halves. We're doing the easy stuff now, because when the people you've trained and nurtured really start in on the hard stuff…\"\nThe old tech trailed off.\n\n\"Are you saying,\" Udo asked, very slowly, \"what I think you're saying?\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" Nascimbeni looked back down at Del, and smiled. \"What do you think I'm saying?\"\nDel smiled at him.\n\n\"I think you're saying we're eventually going to change //everything,//\" said Udo. \"The whole Foundation. The whole world, maybe. Just like the first time?\"\n\n\"Without the initial death toll, I hope,\" said Harry.\n\nNascimbeni looked at Allan again. \"Like the first time. But better.\"\n\nMcInnis shook his head, ruefully. \"It's a lovely sentiment, but my track record doesn't bear it out. I don't need to be argued down from this, friends. I've done my mentor a disservice, and it's something I mean to address. If I get the chance.\" He kept shaking his head, harder now. \"No, that's not even… you know what? I //had// the chance. I had a thousand chances. And I didn't take them.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" Harry said miserably. \"Same, here.\"\n\n\"You never get them back,\" Udo agreed.\n\n\"Even worse,\" Lillian sighed. \"We //did// get them back. Over and over. And we let them slip away anyhow—\"\n\nDel interrupted. \"Are we assuming this is over? We're finished? Kaput? That's what this is about?\" She sat up, and Nascimbeni jerked his hand back. He'd been about to stroke her hair again. \"You want to sit here and talk about what we're leaving unfinished? Well, how's this: I wish I'd been able to kill every one of those word wizard cocksuckers, and the whole damn Insurgency. And this bullshit demigod, and whoever put him on his pedestal. And that's still what I want. So get your bitching over and done with, so we can get the hell back to work.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Harry grinned. It was hard not to grin when Del got very angry, unless she was angry with you. \"We're not out of time yet.\"\n\n\"That may not be strictly correct,\" said McInnis. \"Udo, without getting up, and without undue fuss, could you please finish concealing the tunnel entrance?\"\n\nUdo stared at him, then gently began rotating her wrist. When the grains were all in place — she couldn't see, but she could //feel// — she nodded. \"Done. Why?\"\n\nMcInnis inclined his chin at the horizon. \"Because we would appear to have a visitor.\"\n\n\"That's it, then,\" Lillian spat. \"It's done. A round table of sob stories and might-have-beens. //That's// our epitaph for humanity.\"\n\nHer voice must have carried, because the approaching figure responded as he strode into the firelight and his features came into focus.\n\n\"That,\" said Placeholder McDoctorate, \"would make for a very poor story indeed.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image PHMD_Wasteland.jpg]] --]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/54-not-ready-for-prime-time | previous-title=Not Ready for Prime Time\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/56-this-forgotten-babylon | next-title=This Forgotten Babylon\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadlined-hub  | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Deadlined\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\nThe page title quotes Horace Smith, \"Ozymandias,\" The Examiner, 1818, in the public domain; this work is quoted within the page as well.\n\nThis page quotes \"Wonders of My Hand\" quote Percy Bysshe Shelley, \"Ozymandias,\" The Examiner, 1818, in the public domain.\n\nThis page quotes T.S.
