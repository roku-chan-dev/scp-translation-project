Couldn’t have done it without you. \nHope you like this. It’s been on my mind for a while, and I think it deserves to see the light of day. Have fun! Love, Vikki.\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7916\n\n**Object Class:** --Safe-- Neutralized \n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**\n\n--SCP-7916 is to be kept in a storage locker at Site-71 and remain locked in a locked and key-coded safe. Access is restricted to those with a clearance level of 4 or higher, and is not to be used unless in a K-Class scenario.-- Due to the neutralised state of SCP-7916, these procedures no longer apply. No containment is considered necessary as of now. \n\n**Description:** \n\nSCP-7916 is a striker-fire pistol formerly belonging to Agent Juno Serapis. Before and during its use [SEE ADDENDA], the gun contained a seemingly unlimited supply of bullets[[footnote]]The bullet supply is now depleted after the incident on 8.8.23 [[/footnote]]. When a bullet fired from SCP-7916 came into contact with a living organism, the organism would be destroyed, alongside the “concept” of the entity itself. Any similar beings would be destroyed in the process, with “similarity” being linked through conceptual complexity. Understanding how SCP-7916 determines a concept's \"complexity\" has proved difficult, with test results being inconsistent. Entities shot are designated SCP-7916-2.\n\nCurrent estimates indicate a positive correlation between the level of destruction and conceptual complexity, with destruction ranging from entire species, to only certain phylotypes. In human victims of SCP-7916-2 instances, the effect seems to only destroy the instance itself.  \n\nWhen shot, records and data of SCP-7916-2 will be erased; only those who directly witness the shooting will be able to retain memories of the instance. \n\n**Recovered Recordings:**\n\nThe following records were recovered from a solid state drive found along with the burnt remains of a spherical white device. While the device’s internal wiring and motherboard had been burned beyond repair, the drive was recovered with little damage, and all video found on it has been archived for analysis.  \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"RECORDING-7916-01\" hide=\"CLOSE LOG”]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 3px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 4/7916 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/7916 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@ \n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 5px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Military_base_in_Gori%2C_Georgia_%28A%29.JPG/640px-Military_base_in_Gori%2C_Georgia_%28A%29.JPG]]\n\n//THE RECORDING BEGINS. THE LOCATION IS A RANSACKED ALCOVE. RUBBLE NEARBY IS SHOWN TO SPORT THE SCP FOUNDATION'S INSIGNIA. A TALL MALE OF SLENDER BUILD WITH BROWN SKIN AND LONG BLACK HAIR SITS IN THE DUST. HIS UNIFORM IS THAT OF A FOUNDATION AGENT. THE DRONE APPROACHES. A SCANNER OVERLAY IDENTIFIES THE INDIVIDUAL AS FOUNDATION AGENT JUNO SERAPIS. THE DRONE ACTIVATES A VOCAL MECHANISM.//\n\nDRONE: I have one audio message to Agent Juno Serapis, from Dr. Cassidy Dione. Would you like to view this message? \n\nJUNO: What the fuck- God. Sure.

Look, I know we didn’t leave off on the best of terms, but this isn’t about that. So I’m not even going to try to be subtle about it: We’re currently on the verge of an XK-End-Of-The-World Scenario, probably in it already. Likely, by the time you’re hearing this, I’ll be dead. We’ve lost nearly a quarter of our sites, and the breach rate is getting too much to handle. \n\nI don’t know how to explain this, what happened, why I’m sending you this, but I’ll try my best. We all know this world is paper-fucking-thin. Things are constantly trying to break the walls down, storm inside and wipe us out. That’s what happened yesterday. I can’t tell whether it feels like more or less time has passed. Everything went in such a rush, yet it was too much to believe that… sorry. I’m rambling. Fuck. \n\nThis is too much. \n\nSo I’m asking for your help. I really hope you didn’t break CASIDIO. Hopefully retirement made you a little less trigger-happy, though I doubt you could change that much. CASIDIO. That's the drone.... I know I should write this down by hand, or, something… but, well, I kinda lost that in the chaos. I’m sure you probably notice it’s my name. \n\nSo, about the gun: Do you remember Salsafish? Notoriously spicy, but delicious? Fat was used for thickening agents? \n\nOf course you don’t. That’s because we shot one with this gun. Bam- gone to anyone who didn’t see it with their own two eyes. When we went into lockdown, Demi gathered a bunch of the researchers into a Safe containment storage unit. I found the gun in a box near the back, and it made me think of you. There’s not much time left, so… this is my shot in the dark. Pun... intended, I guess. \n\nI need you, if you’re still alive, to take the gun and find all the fuckers who’ve crawled into this world. Make sure they never crawl anywhere again. Fix this. Please.\n\nI need...\n\nI need you.\n\nFuck. Sorry.\n\n//SHE SIGHS.//\n\nOh, and in order to get Casidio to listen to you... you gotta say “Password: Euthalia”. \n\nGoodbye, Juno. \n\nI love you. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n//TRANSCRIPT ENDS.//\n\n//JUNO PAUSES FOR FIVE SECONDS, MUTTERING TO HIMSELF, BEFORE TURNING TO FACE THE CAMERA.//\n\nJUNO: Password: Euthalia. \n\nDRONE: Password accepted. \n\n//THE VOICE OF THE DRONE CHANGES TONE, SHIFTING FROM AUTOMATED TO A MORE \"HUMAN\" CADENCE.//\n\nCASIDIO: Hey Juno. \n\nJUNO: Long time, no see, Cas...\n\n//RECORDING CUTS OUT//\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\nCASIDIO: How much damage assessment have you done so far? \n\nJUNO: Uh… //HE LOOKS AROUND// The surveillance room is completely smashed.\n\nCASIDIO: Where is that?\n\nJUNO: The room we’re currently in. Hang on.\n\n//HE STANDS UP, LIMPING OVER TO A CRUSHED MONITOR, AND ATTEMPTS TO POWER IT ON//\n\nJUNO: I think the power is cut out, at least for this area. I’d be damned if it wasn’t sitewide. I’m getting the sense things got pretty ugly here.\n\nCASIDIO: My Site was completely caved in. We ended up hiding in the Storage units, underground. \n\nJUNO: Cas mentioned something like that, yeah. Right before she handed me a gun and said “save the world, no pressure”. \n\nCASIDIO: Those were not my words.\n\nJUNO: Close enough. //HE SIGHS, PICKING UP SCP-7916 AND INSPECTING IT// What happens when this thing runs out of bullets?\n\nCASIDIO: We don’t think it will. Part of the anomaly. We’ve shot it enough that it should be empty. \n\nJUNO: Lotta trust in this one gun. \n\nCASIDIO: My trust isn’t in the gun. It’s in you.\n\nJUNO: Eh. I’d put my money on the gun, then. \n\nCASIDIO, annoyed: Shut up and get a move on.\n\nJUNO: I’m //disabled//. //HE GESTURED TO HIS HIP//\n\nCASIDIO: Wish they’d shot your tongue instead.\n\n//JUNO SIGHS, WALKING AND SLOWLY PICKING THROUGH THE RUBBLE OF THE ROOM.

I can scan it into the database and get us a location on this thing.\n\nJUNO: Brilliant idea, but like I said, the cameras are all down.\n\nCASIDIO: These rooms usually have a hefty amount of protection. You ever seen a fire extinguisher?\n\nJUNO: Never needed to use one.\n\nCASIDIO: Well start looking-\n\n//ANOTHER CRASH IS HEARD, SOUNDING LESS DISTANT//\n\nCASIDIO: //Crap.//\n\n//THE VIDEO BECOMES SHAKY AS THE DRONE MOVES THROUGHOUT THE ROOM.

We’re doing this the old-fashioned way first. \n\n//HE RUNS TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE, TAKING COVER TO SURVEY THE SITUATION. THE DRONE JOINS AT HIS SHOULDER, EXAMINING THE SCENE.

NO EYES ARE VISIBLE, THOUGH TWO LARGE MOUTHS POSSESSING MULTIPLE ROWS OF INCISORS ARE PRESENT.//\n\nCASIDIO: Dammit. That thing… that’s one of the ones that escaped. \n\n//JUNO AIMS THE GUN AND FIRES TWICE. THE BULLETS BURY INTO ITS SIDE, HAVING NO PERCEIVED EFFECT.

THE CREATURE SNARLS, LETTING OUT A LONG SHRIEK, AND LASHING A TAIL. ANOTHER CRASH IS HEARD, AS ANOTHER WALL OF THE SITE IS DESTROYED. AFTER 20 SECONDS, NOTHING REMAINS.//\n\n//JUNO LOWERS THE GUN, ARMS SHAKING//\n\nJUNO: //Fuck.//\n\nCASIDIO: Hopefully that wiped out any others of that particular species as well. For obvious reasons, we didn’t run many tests with the gun. We don’t really know how consistent it is.\n\nJUNO: It better be consistent. I’m retired. I’ve served my time being patient.\n\nCASIDIO: Well, consider yourself unretired, then. You’re going to be as patient as we need, Agent Serapis.\n\nJUNO, exasperated: Don’t call me that.\n\nCASIDIO: Whatever. We need to go. You have everything?\n\nJUNO: No. We barely have anything. This is the fucking desert. Can we at least look around the Site first?\n\nCASIDIO: Fine.\n\nJUNO: Also, you’re welcome. \n\nCASIDIO: For what?\n\n\nJUNO: Saving our asses. Or your backup drive. Whatever drones have. \n\nCASIDIO: What the actual- you nearly got us killed in the first place, idiot.\n\nJUNO: So? We’re alive. Thanks to me.\n\n//THEY WALK AROUND THE PERIMETER, PICKING THROUGH SOME OF THE OPEN AREAS. DRIED BLOOD IS SEEN SPATTERED ON SOME OF THE WALLS, AND A BODY IS VISIBLE IN THE CORNER OF A SHOT.//\n\nCASIDIO: I thought six years would’ve made you a better person.\n\nJUNO, SIGHING: Welcome to being wrong, honey. You get used to it. \n\n//CASIDIO DOESN’T RESPOND. JUNO PICKS UP A FALLEN METAL BEAM, USING IT TO PRY A METAL DOOR OPEN. INSIDE, EXTRA UNIFORMS, EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS LINE THE WALLS. AT THE BACK, A ROW OF BACKPACKS ARE HUNG. JUNO WALKS FORWARD, GRABBING A BACKPACK AND SHOVING A FEW WEAPONS INSIDE//\n\nCASIDIO: What now?\n\nJUNO: Exploration kits. When we send people down for recon missions we give em’ one of these. Dried food, thermal gear, first aid. Whole shebang.\n\n//HE PAUSES, LOOKING UP//\n\nJUNO: What’s your deal? Like… batteries? Do I need to charge you? \n\nCASIDIO: I run on thermal energy from my surroundings. You don’t need to worry about me, at least not while we’re still in Nevada. \n\nJUNO: Right. How’d you find me, anyway?\n\nCASIDIO: I looked up your Site’s location when you were re-assigned. You forget I’m senior staff- //IT CUTS OFF// …was Senior Staff. \n\nJUNO: How completely non-stalkerish.\n\nCASIDIO: You work in Surveillance, kettle.\n\nJUNO: Fuck off.  \n\nCASIDIO: Can we leave now? \n\nJUNO: I think so.\n\nCASIDIO: Got it.\n\n//THE PAIR MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TOWARDS THE DESERT//\n\nJUNO: Any... any survivors?

I just never really kept close with anyone here, y'know? \n\nCASIDIO: When you told me you were transferring, you said you wanted to get away. That wasn't you trying to make new friends, was it? It was a way to hide.\n\nJUNO: 'Fraid you're right.\n\nCASIDIO: You're a coward. \n\nJUNO: Tell me something I don't know! //HE CHUCKLES// Frankly, my dear? I don't give a damn.\n\nCASIDIO: Gone with the wind.\n\nJUNO: Eh? \n\nCASIDIO: You left half your DVD set at my apartment when you moved. I got curious. \n\nJUNO: Now that takes all the fun out of it. \n\nCASIDIO: You //like// confusing me? \n\nJUNO: I'm a terrible, terrible man, Cas.\n\nCASIDIO: The closest Site is 50 miles on foot. That should take us about a day if we don't stop for anything. Hopefully, there'll be survivors who can help us. \n\n//JUNO RAISES AN EYEBROW// \n\nJUNO: Are you telling me to shut up?\n\nCASIDIO: Just keep walking. \n\n//RECORDING SHUTS OFF//\n\n//RECORDINGS RESUME FOUR TIMES, THOUGH ONLY TO DOCUMENT STOPS FOR REST AND RECUPERATION ALONG THE JOURNEY.

Originally, I made the drone to send messages to personnel when I was busy with work. Senior Researcher benefits, and all that. I asked them to give me a way to scan in thoughts and memories, so I could keep them in a stable format, and eventually people started seeing the drone more than me. Tech got attached, and asked permission to implement a code that could use memories as data for an AI personality feature- and well.

I love you because Cassidy loved you. I’m not really her. I’m not going to… I’m not going to change as a person. I’m not going to grow with you. Everything I do is based on the memories I got from her. She isn’t here to make any more memories. Everything new that happens from here won’t have emotions attached to it. It won’t be human. I’m not Cassidy. \n\nJUNO: But you’re still everything I loved about her.\n\nCASIDIO: Ever since I died, I’m growing farther away from being who she really was, Juno. I’m not Cassidy.

It’s nearly impossible to take them down, and the more of a survivor community we build, the more of a target we become.\n\nTHOMPSON: I’d agree. You really saved my ass back there, Serapis. \n\nJUNO: I wish I could, but, well… I made a promise to someone else.\n\nKEPLER: Who?\n\nJUNO: Dr. Cassidy Dione. My ex-girlfriend.

Midwest area, maybe. \n\nKEPLER: Of course this shit will have started in Ohio.\n\nHARVEY: That’s not even funny anymore.\n\nTHOMPSON: I was stationed in Ohio for a while, and I think it’s hilarious.\n\n//THOMPSON SHOVES A FORK OF DEFROSTED JERKY IN HER MOUTH.

It’d be better for everyone.\n\nHARVEY: What do you think will happen to groups like MC&D once this ends? I mean, we’re looking at a Broken Masquerade here. \n\nKEPLER: Not necessarily. I’ve heard down the grapevine that they’ve fixed worse.\n\nTHOMPSON: That’s a terrifying thought. Doesn’t sound sustainable, either.\n\nJUNO: If all else fails, we can always put reality through a woodchipper.\n\n//THOMPSON THROWS HER FORK AT JUNO//\n\nTHOMPSON: Keep your damn mouth shut. \n------\n\n//THEY STAND IN THE EXIT HALL.

Had a picture of you in his pocket, from when you were… well, y’know. You’re a catch.\n\nCASIDIO: Are you hitting on me?\n\nTHOMPSON: Me? Nah. Maybe if you were still human. Robots aren’t my thing. \n\nCASIDIO: Sorry. I was pretty young when I started out. I got a lot of unwanted… attention. \n\nTHOMPSON: Is that how you met Serapis? \n\nCASIDIO: No. \n\n//PAUSE// \n\nTHOMPSON: Are you gonna tell me how you did meet, then?\n\nCASIDIO: Huh? Oh. Yeah, sure.\n\n//IT SIGHS//\n\nCASIDIO: I worked as a Site command for MTF missions. Lots of multi-tasking. That’s why I got a drone - so I didn’t have to leave my station on longer missions. When I was in training, my mentor ended up knocked out after an unexpected memetic hazard. Those who didn’t directly view it got temporarily blinded, and the whole mission went south pretty quickly. I figured out what had happened, and I stepped in. \n\nTHOMPSON: So you saved his life.\n\nCASIDIO: Yep. Someone said one of the agents asked to see me after they got back. Wanted to know who’d been the one to help them. And… there he was. And there I was.\n\nTHOMPSON: And the rest is history. \n\nCASIDIO: I don’t really think  about it that way. We were both still young, and really, if it hadn’t happened that way I don’t think we ever would’ve worked out. It’s over, anyways.\n\nTHOMPSON: Doesn’t have to be. He’s here, y’know.\n\nCASIDIO: Agent Thompson, I’m dead.\n\nTHOMPSON: … fuck. Yeah. You are. //SHE WIPES A HAND AGAINST HER BROW// You’re really human.

TO HIS RIGHT, AGENT LAFAYETTE CATCHES UP TO THEM.//\n\nLAFAYETTE: Agent Serapis! Where are you going?\n\nJUNO: Wherever I can be of help. Where’s Jo? \n\nLAFAYETTE: She rushed to the front lines. Just- follow me.\n\n//LAFAYETTE LEADS THEM TOWARDS A STAIRCASE, SEVERAL MORE WINDOWS SHATTERING BEHIND THEM. THE DRONE IS NEARLY KNOCKED OUT OF THE AIR, BUT REGAINS ITS PACE. FINALLY, THEY RUN OUT A SIDE DOOR//\n\nJUNO: Holy //shit//.\n\n//A CREATURE RESEMBLING A GIANT WHALE IS APPROACHING, CLAWED TENTACLES SUPPORTING ITS WEIGHT. IT ROARS, SMASHING TWO RESEARCHERS WITH AN APPENDAGE. JUNO RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES AT IT, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS//\n\nJUNO: What’s wrong with this thing?\n\nLAFAYETTE: I don’t know. I’m going to go look for civillians. You try and distract it. I’m trusting you.\n\n//XE LAYS A HAND ON JUNO’S SHOULDER, SQUEEZING, THEN RUNS OFF. JUNO YELLS, SHOOTING AGAIN. THE CREATURE NOTICES HIM, TURNING HIS WAY. IT’S EYE HAS SEVERAL PUPILS, ALL SPINNING WITHIN THE MILKY YELLOW SURFACE.//\n\nCASIDIO: Juno. Juno, we need to find Jo.\n\nJUNO: But, Agent La-\n\nCASIDIO: I don’t care, ignore xir. We //need to find Jo.//\n\nJUNO: Sorry. //HE COCKS THE GUN, DODGING ANOTHER ARM// I made a promise. I can’t break it.\n\nCASIDIO: //JUNO!//\n\nJUNO: Lay off me, Cas! //HE RUNS BACKWARDS// C’mon! Look at me, big guy!\n\n//THE CREATURE LUNGES TOWARDS HIM, AND HE FIRES AGAIN. IT CLOSES ITS EYE PROTECTIVELY, ROARING, THEN STALKS FORWARDS AGAIN//\n\nJUNO: Gotcha. \n\n//HE SHOOTS A BULLET INTO THE CREATURES EYE, WHICH RUPTURES AND EXPLODES, SPLATTERING BLACK GOO OVER THE LAWN. SLOWLY, IT BEGINS TO DISSOLVE, STUMBLING BACK AND CRUSHING INTO THE ROOF OF THE SITE BUILDING WITH A FLAILING TENTACLE. THEN IT FALLS TO THE GROUND, DISSOLVING INTO DUST.//\n\nJUNO: Hell yeah! \n\n//A CHEER ERUPTS, THEN STOPS, AS PEOPLE RUSH IN TO LOOK FOR SURVIVORS. THE DRONE FLIES QUICKLY TOWARDS THE HERD, IDENTIFICATION MODULE ACTIVATING AND SCANNING THE CROWD. FINALLY, A BEEP IS HEARD, AND THE MODULE LOCATES AGENT JUSTINE SAMUELS, ALIVE. SHE’S COVERED IN ASH, AND BLEEDING FROM A GASH ON HER ARM.//\n\nCASIDIO: JO!\n\nSAMUELS: Who is that? Soph? Is that- Cas! Hey, baby, there you are. You okay? \n\n//THE DRONE SOBS//\n\nCASIDIO: Sorry. I’m sorry.\n\nSAMUELS: It’s okay, love. It’s okay. Sophia is safe. She’s inside. Another Site fell, so she’s working to find out what happened. \n\nCASIDIO: Another one?\n\nSAMUELS: Yeah. I know, it’s rough.\n\nJUNO: Which one?\n\n//SAMUELS SIGHS//\n\nSAMUEL: 409.\n\n//JUNO SCREAMS, PICKING UP A CHUNK OF CONCRETE AND THROWING IT AT THE GROUND. IT DOESN’T BREAK.//\n\n//THE DRONE GOES STILL. THE RECORDING SHUTS OFF//\n\n//RECORDING CLICKS ON//\n\n//JUNO AND LAFAYETTE ARE STANDING AT THE EDGE OF A GROUP OF PERSONNEL. THE PEOPLE CIRCLE AROUND THE EARLIER BATTLEGROUND, HOLDING CANDLES. ONE MAN SOBS.//\n\nLAFAYETTE: It’s a Site tradition in South America. Jo brought it with her when she moved here. When one of us dies in the dark, our loved ones light a candle, to light our way as we move on to a lighter place.\n\nJUNO: We never grieved like that at my old Site. \n\nLAFAYETTE: The Foundation would like to have you think no one grieves. \n\nJUNO: Does it help?\n\n//LAFAYETTE SHRUGS//\n\nLAFAYETTE: I don’t know. I’ve never had to light one. \n\nJUNO: … could I join?\n\nLAFAYETTE: I don’t see why not. \n\nJUNO: Thanks.\n\n//JUNO WALKS OVER. THE DRONE FOLLOWS HIM, QUIETLY. SOMEONE PASSES HIM AN UNLIT CANDLE, AND A MATCH. HE LIGHTS IT, AND THEN THE CANDLE. IT BURNS BRIGHTLY AS HE SETS IT DOWN, THEN SNIFFS.//\n\nCASIDIO: Is this for… Barb and everyone?\n\nJUNO: … no. Not this time. Here, Cas. This is for you.\n\n//THEY PAUSE, WATCHING  THE FIRE// \n\nCASIDIO: … thanks.\n\nJUNO: … Don’t mention it.\n\n//THEY WALK BACK//\n\nLAFAYETTE: Done?\n\nJUNO: Yeah. It’s… complicated.\n\nLAFAYETTE: Wasn’t planning on asking. By the way- Jo said she got you set up for your next leg of the journey. \n\nJUNO: That woman is a treasure.\n\nLAFAYETTE: She’s what a Foundation Agent should be. //XE LOOKS UP// You’re… you aren’t bad either.\n\nJUNO: Thanks, but you’re wrong.\n\n//LAFAYETTE SNORTS//\n\nLAFAYETTE: Take the compliment. \n\nJUNO: …alright.\n\n//THEY WALK TOGETHER//\n\nLAFAYETTE: That gun of yours does more than kill things.\n\nJUNO: A bold claim.\n\nLAFAYETTE: Not really. Some of the people who weren’t there at the scene for the whole fight don’t seem to remember what went down. And I’ve gotten some reports of people realising their death reports don’t match up to their incident reports. Now you’re here, and you turn one of those things to dust with a single hit. Care to explain?\n\nJUNO: Not really.\n\nLAFAYETTE: Do you want my trust, Serapis? Or just my respect?\n\nJUNO: … fine. My gun is an SCP. It can destroy things down to a… conceptual level. Erase them from the world entirely. Only people who see it land its bullets will remember. \n\nLAFAYETTE: And what daft motherfucker thought YOU should be the one to get that?\n\nCASIDIO: Me.\n\nLAFAYETTE: I thought you were the smart one.\n\nCASIDIO: I wasn't thinking straight.\n\nJUNO: I think I’ve done alright so far. \n\n//LAFAYETTE ROLLS XIR EYES. THEY WALK TO WHERE SAMUELS IS STANDING, ALONG WITH A SHORT WOMAN WITH DARK HAIR AND BROWN SKIN//\n\nSAMUELS: Juno! Cas! Laffy! This is Sophia- my wife. \n\n//SOPHIA BLUSHES//\n\nSOPHIA: Hi. It's nice to meet you, both of you.\n\nSAMUELS: I had to drag her out of her office. \n\nSOPHIA: Jo-! \n\nSAMUELS: It's okay.\n\n//LAFAYETTE SNORTS//\n\nSOPHIA: Good luck on your way, Juno. Where are you heading now? If you can tell me.\n\nJUNO: South Dakota.\n\nSAMUELS: Well, Godspeed. Carpe Diem. Seize the day, boys-\n\nJUNO: -and make your lives extraordinary.\n\n//SAMUELS AND JUNO EXCHANGE A GRIN. THEN JUNO GETS INTO THE FRONT SEAT OF THE JEEP, AND WAVES, STARTING THE ENGINE AND DRIVING AWAY//\n\n//RECORDING SHUTS OFF// \n\n//RECORDINGS RESUME TWELVE TIMES, THOUGH ONLY TO DOCUMENT STOPS FOR REST AND RECOOPERATION WHILE TRAVELLING. TRANSCRIPT HAS BEEN CUT FOR RELEVANCE.//\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\n//THE JEEP IS APPROACHING A SMALL CONSTRUCTED BOMB SHELTER. A PERSON WITH PINK HAIR AND DARK SKIN SITS NEAR THE ENTRANCE, SQUAWKING AT THE SIGHT OF HIM.//\n\nPERSON: Ack! Who goes there!\n\nJUNO: Just your friendly spy.\n\n//THE PERSON STANDS, HOISTING A LONG PLASTIC RAKE IN THE AIR// \n\nPERSON: I'm Sir Judith Abakar, Gate Guard of the Parawatch Institute! \n\n//JUNO PAUSES, THEN SIGHS//\n\nJUNO: Of course it is. South Dakota, sweet love. You are somethin' else entirely.\n\nCASIDIO: Juno. Don't be rude. Sir Abakar, this is Agent Juno Serapis, and I'm Dr. Cassidy Dione.\n\n//ABAKAR'S EYES WIDEN//\n\nABAKAR: Is that- are you a //droid//? Like in Star Wars! Oh my god, this is so cool. //THEY STOP, LOOKING AT JUNO SUSPICIOUSLY// Is this Alien technology?\n\nJUNO: Nope. Just... normal tech. \n\nABAKAR: Whatever. The forum is going fucking //love// this. Violet! \n\n//THEY RUN TO THE ENTRANCE TO THE SHELTER, KNOCKING OUT \"P.W\" IN MORSE CODE//\n\nVOICE: Who goes there?\n\nABAKAR: Sir Abakar, reporting for duty!\n\n//THE DOOR OPENS, AND AN ASIAN TEENAGE GIRL WITH SHORT HAIR, ALONG WITH A GINGER BOY, STUMBLE OUT//\n\nABAKAR: Violet! Jamie! We got something big. Like, super huge. I just met an actual alien spy and what I think is a sentient drone.\n\nVIOLET: Holy //shit//! Dude! //SHE HIGH FIVES ABAKAR, THEN RUNS OVER// Welcome to Earth! Now, don't be confused. You're safe. We know //everything//. The moon situation, the crop circles. Your secret is safe with the Parawatch. We're the friends of the paranormal //everywhere//. //SHE BEAMS, JUMPING UP AND SHAKING JUNO'S HAND//\n\nVIOLET: I'm so happy to finally meet an alien. Like seriously- Wait, can I say alien? What should I say? \n\nJAMIE: Um, I think \"Extraterrestrial Person\" might be better?\n\nABAKAR: Or \"Person with Extraterrestrial attributes\". Person-first language, and all that. They're not //just// al- people with Extraterrestrial attributes, after all.\n\nCASIDIO: He's not an alien. Juno, tell them you aren't one.\n\nJUNO: I was enjoying it, though. \n\nCASIDIO: That's terrible. \n\nJAMIE: Let's head down, I'm getting cold out here.\n\nCASIDIO: Please.\n\n//THEY WALK BACK, HEADING DOWN THE STAIRS INTO A SMALL SHELTER. A VINTAGE TV WITH A STACK OF OLD SONIC GAMES SITS IN THE CORNER, AND A COUCH AND BLANKETS COVER THE FLOOR. STACKS OF EMPTY SODA CANS AND SNACK BOXES ARE PILED UP.//\n\nVIOLET: Welcome to our place! That's Judith, that's Jamie, and that's Bramble!\n\n//SHE POINTS. IN THE CORNER, A SHORT, THIN TEEN WITH SHOULDER LENGTH RED HAIR AND THICK GLASSES SAT, THREE LAPTOPS SURROUNDING HER. A HEADSET FIRMLY SITS OVER HER EARS.//\n\nABAKAR: Bramble! Look up!\n\n//BRAMBLE GLANCES UP, THEN GRINS. WHEN SHE SPEAKS, HER VOICE HAS A NOTICEABLE LISP.//\n\nBRAMBLE: You found a guy! \n\nVIOLET: Not a guy. A person with Extraterrestrial attributes. //SHE BEAMS//\n\nJAMIE: An Alien.\n\nJUNO: I'm not an alien.\n\n//BRAMBLE LAUGHS//\n\nVIOLET: Bramble is amazing. She’s one of the founders of the Forum Stringboards! \n\nCASIDIO: The forum… what? \n\nBRAMBLE: It’s an interactive stringboard on the Parawatch site. You can post discussion thread or page links, and then group them together to organise evidence or connections. It’s super brilliant. \n\nVIOLET: It’s so cool. She’s also been handling basically all of our tech. She’s an electromet- electomar-\n\nBRAMBLE: Electromancer! I’ve managed to get us full power and consistent wifi, so we have lines to a bunch of super useful stuff. I’ve been working on hacking the CIA database to see if they have any connection to this. \n\nCASIDIO: Really? Are you serious? \n\nBRAMBLE: Yeah!\n\nCASIDIO, EXCITED: May I… may I take a look at the computer? If I can hook up to the Wi-Fi I can most likely connect to the computer server and run some of my more advanced software scans over it, or I could-\n\nJUNO: And we’ve lost her, folks.\n\nVIOLET: Huh?\n\nJUNO: Cas used to work in Communications. She gets… passionate about tech.\n\nVIOLET: I mean, I get that. I love technology. I’m in a class at school where we’re learning HTML, and I recently designed a really simple webpage layout with Jamie…. //SHE FROWNS// … before the school got blown up.\n\nJUNO: Maybe if conspiracy theories don’t work out, you can become a software developer or something. \n\nVIOLET: Maybe I can do both. Like Bramble did with the stringboards? Actually- //SHE PAUSES// I can show you some of the stuff we've been working on. There's some really great theories here that I think- \n\n//SHE STUMBLES, GRABBING AT A FEW OPEN NOTEBOOKS AND FLIPPING THROUGH THEM.//\n\nVIOLET: Here! So- this is called the Dell Rapids Enigma. I named it myself, because, um, I discovered it. I actually was on a walk after my Dad had kicked me out so he could have his girlfriend over while my Mom wasn't home but- nevermind, that's not important. I was walking through the woods, and I came by the river, and then suddenly- that's when I saw it. It was kinda blurry, but it was big. I heard the branches rustle, and like, I pulled out my phone to get a picture, but then it was gone. I drew it, though. Wait one second- //SHE LOOKS FOR THE DRAWING. JAMIE WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA.//\n\nJAMIE: Hey... did you say your name was Dione? \n\nCASIDIO: Last name, yeah.\n\nJAMIE: That's a type of butterfly, actually. The Dione genus. Um, It has the Mexican Silverspot, the Gulf Fritillary, the Juno Longwing- \n\nCASIDIO: I know. I researched it once. It's interesting. \n\nJAMIE: Really? Do you like bugs- like, in general, I mean-\n\nCASIDIO: Um. Not really?\n\nJAMIE: Oh. Sorry. It's just, I'm a big bug fan, and I have this theory I've been working on for a while- so you know Mothman? Well, if you think about how Termites are basically indestructible, and ants are super strong, well, I think bugs are actually evolving. Mothman is the prototype, y'know? Then the rest of them will evolve, and they'll all come together, and make a big bug army. Then they'll take us on, because, y'know, we aren't very nice to them. I've been trying for ages to get the Parawatch forums to make a space to discuss our plans for when it happens. Um, I think if we make like, a committee, we can bargain with them? Or maybe-\n\nABAKAR: Jamie! Shut up about the bugs. I already was right and you know it. New World Order ordered Apocalypse. Those monsters are here to take out everyone unworthy of the new age.\n\n//JAMIE'S LIP TREMBLES//\n\nJAMIE: But- my sister... and my Momma. How are they-\n\n//ABAKAR CONTINUES TO ARGUE WITH HIM//\n\nJUNO: Jesus. You kids have it rough. \n\nVIOLET: Yeah. But we're making due. //SHE FLIPS HER NOTEBOOK TO THE NEXT PAGE// We're in it for the long run. For the truth. \n\n//RECORDING CUTS OUT//\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\n//THE GROUP SITS ON THE FLOOR TOGETHER, EATING CANNED PEACHES OUT OF THE JAR. BLANKETS PILE UP HIGH, AND THE DRONE IS PERCHED ON JUNO'S ARM//\n\nBRAMBLE: So- entry time. Everyone ready?\n\nVIOLET: Flowercat066 reporting for duty!\n\nABAKAR: DukeJuke43 on guard.\n\nJAMIE: PointPleasantTruther67 here.\n\nJUNO: ... what the fuck?\n\nVIOLET: We've been keeping a log of our day-to-day adventures on the Forums. That way when everything is over, there's a record.\n\nJUNO: ... got it.\n\nVIOLET: Before we met, we used to talk over IRC- just usernames. So when we met up, we called each other our users still for a while.\n\nJAMIE: I still can't get over that Juke was supposed to be short for Judith.\n\nABAKAR: Hey- cut the shade.\n\n//THEY LAUGH. JUNO SHRUGS//\n\nJUNO: Is it just me, or are these kids really fucking corny? \n\nCASIDIO, FOND: You called me \"Madame Researcher\" for the first two months we dated. Shut your mouth, Agent Kettle.\n\nJUNO: I'm sorry, Madame Researcher. \n\n//THE DRONE LAUGHS// \n\nBRAMBLE: Day Thirty-two. From the Journal of DeadEndBush and Co. \n\nI feel good. \n\nToday we met someone new. They call themself Juno Serapis. They’re an Agent - I don’t know what for. But something big. And I think, something good. \n\nViolet and I are talking about good and bad things a lot. Do the monsters think that we’re bad, or good? Can they think at all? We’re trying to set up some theories on the stringboards. I think I’ve almost found a way that we might be able to beat them. A weak spot, of sorts. That’s a surprise, though. Like I said, I’m not sure if it will work.\n\nOur rations look good, and our tech is working fine. We've made the fort finally feel comfy I think. Jamie says he's getting used to sleeping bags more, and Jude is finally sleeping at all. I like being a leader. It’s nice to be depended on. It makes me feel strong, and I like being strong.\n\nI’m going to include a picture of all of us together, so you can see our faces. Just in case this is the final time you do. I don’t want to be a downer, but sometimes, it’s scary here.\n\nThank you for all the support on the forums. It means a lot. Keep up the good work, keep building and surviving, and we’ll see you soon - for the truth.\n\nLogging off, Bramble. Parawatcher. They/she.\n\n//BRAMBLE FINISHES SPEAKING, THEN TURNS AROUND THE LAPTOP, BRINGING UP PHOTO BOOTH.//\n\nBRAMBLE: Crowd in, folks. \n\nCASIDIO: You wanna get in?\n\nJUNO: ... why the hell not.

There’s- there’s one of those things- Bramble and Jude are out- god, just- get up!\n\n//JUNO SCRAMBLES UP, FISHING FOR HIS BAG IN THE DARK. HE BANGS HIS HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING.

Not after Taylor.\n\nCASIDIO: Juno, that wasn’t your faul-\n\nJUNO: My job in that mission was to get the fucking kid to safety! And you know what happened? One kid, dead, and half my team, shot. I’m not letting this happen again, Cas.\n\nVIOLET: Mr. Serapis! Dione! Do something, please!\n\nBRAMBLE: I’ve got it, don’t worry, love!\n\nVIOLET: BRAMBLE!\n\nBRAMBLE: Just trust me!

This is- I just miss my Mom and my friends and my teachers and I don't know if this will ever get better and everything is changing so fast and now Bramble is dead and it’s all my fault and I- //SHE BREAKS OFF, CRYING. JUNO AWKWARDLY WRAPS AN ARM AROUND HER.//\n\nJUNO: You're gonna be okay, kid. It’s not your fault. \n\n//VIOLET HUGS HIM//\n\nVIOLET: It //is// though. If I hadn’t-\n\nJUNO: It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have hesitated.\n\nVIOLET: No! It’s not- it couldn’t be your fault. You’re a good person, and I-\n\nJUNO: One, I’m not a good person. Two, don’t you dare say you aren’t one too. You’re too young to hate yourself. \n\n//VIOLET SNIFFLES// \n\nVIOLET: …Thanks for not abducting us. \n\n//JUNO LAUGHS//\n\nJUNO: Yeah... you're welcome.\n\nVIOLET: I… it hurts extra for me. I know that sounds weird or selfish to claim that somehow I deserve to be sad more than they do, but it’s different to them. They were her friends, and I… I loved her. \n\nJUNO: …. I don’t think it’s selfish. I know what it’s like. To lose someone you love. You can’t move on, and it just sits like an ache in your chest and kills you over and over until you can’t breathe or even feel anything but just that ache…\n\n//VIOLET STOPS, HICCUPS, THEN WIPES HER NOSE// \n\nVIOLET: No. No, that’s not right. That would be easier. If I couldn’t move on. If I could just love her forever. I mean, that would be so comfortable. //SHE SNIFFS// To have grief and nothing else, and just live there. But I can’t do that. My friends need me. The world needs me.\n\nJUNO: … you really think that’s it, huh? That clinging onto things is just so we can be…. comfortable? \n\nVIOLET: Life’s a bitch, Mr. Serapis. I usually just do whatever feels hardest, because the easy things just… they aren’t satisfying. Change is hard, which is why I have to do it. And letting go is change. It’s the worst kind of change. It’s not just change, it’s loss too. \n\n//SHE SIGHS//\n\nVIOLET: I don’t have the chance to take my time here. I don’t have the pleasure of grieving. I just have to keep things moving. I have to hold them up- hold this up. \n\nJUNO: You shouldn’t put all of that on yourself. It’s not… it’s not good.\n\nVIOLET: Mr. Serapis-\n\nJUNO: Juno.\n\nVIOLET: -Juno. I… //SHE WIPES HER EYES, STRETCHING OUT HER LEGS// Right now the hardest option is trusting that things will be okay. So… I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna trust you. It’s stupid, but I need something to believe in. And you’re the only solid thing right now. So I’m going to believe in you. So please… fix this. \n\n//JUNO TAKES IN A DEEP BREATH//\n\nJUNO: … okay. Thanks. Thanks, kid. \n\n//VIOLET NODS, THEN WALKS AWAY, CLIMBING BACK DOWN THE LADDER INTO THE BUNKER.

She means well, but I know you, Juno, and having people depend on you can be hard for you. \n\nJUNO: I wish you were right about that, but… that doesn’t bother me anymore, I don’t think. I mean. Taylor still… it’s still a sore spot. But when I really think about it… yeah. It did bother me, back then, but… I think I’ve stopped caring about what people ask of me. I either win, or I fail. I don’t think I have much of a say in that front.\n\nCASIDIO: Oh. //SILENCE// Well. That’s good.\n\nJUNO: I… //HE LOOKS OVER, AND SMILES PAINFULLY// Cas. I… I love you. But I think it’s time I realise there’s no more time to be in love with you. I’m not getting you back. //HE CHOKES BACK A SOB// And I need to move on.\n\nCASIDIO: Juno… I-\n\nJUNO: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Cas.\n\nCASIDIO: I’m proud of you. I’m so proud of you, Juno. This is good. For both of us… you deserve someone real. When this is all over… you deserve to love someone you can touch, and feel, and grow into. I don’t want you to love something you can’t have. \n\nJUNO: … I don’t want that for me either.\n\n//THE RECORDING CLICKS OFF//\n\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\n//THE GROUP SIT AT THE TABLE, IN THE SHELTER.

It's a modified EMF reader, basically. Ever since this started, Jamie's compass has been out of whack. Some kind of strong magnetic field has appeared nearby, and it's totally fucked things up. By combining that with a GPS feature, I've managed to pin down the source area. Which should be.... //SHE LOOKS AT THE DEVICE, DRAWING HER FINGER OVER THE MAP AND POINTING TO AN AREA IN THE UPPER REGION OF MINNESOTA// Here. \n\n//JUNO LOOKS TO CASIDIO//\n\nCASIDIO: Have you seen things coming from there?\n\nABAKAR: Yep. We think it's where the government has been creating these things. Their test lab. \n\nJAMIE: Maybe a military base, like Area 51?\n\nABAKAR: 51 is bogus. \n\nVIOLET: No. It's totally real.

I'm from Dell Rapids, so I don't know much of the Northern parts, though.\n\nABAKAR: I'd say head East until you hit the Sioux River, then South until you hit Fargo. Then East again. I'm going to bet you're aiming for the Superior National Forest. That's always where shady ops go down - middle of the woods.\n\nCASIDIO: Site 112. \n\nVIOLET: What?\n\nJUNO: Nothing. Could you draw us a path on one of your maps?\n\nVIOLET: Yeah.\n\nJUNO: Thanks. //HE SMILES// Here's looking at you, kid.\n\n//VIOLET ATTEMPTS TO GIVE A SHAKY SMILE IN RESPONSE//\n\n//RECORDING SHUTS OFF//\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES.//\n\n//THE PARAWATCH MEMBERS SIT IN THE BASE, SILENT. JAMIE’S EYES ARE RED AND PUFFY. SILENTLY, VIOLET STANDS, WALKING OVER, AND PICKING UP BRAMBLE’S LAPTOP. SITTING DOWN, SHE OPENS IT, TYPES IN THE PASSCODE, AND CLICKS.//\n\nVIOLET: … Flowercat066. Here.\n\nABAKAR: … huh?\n\nVIOLET: We’re going to do an update. Because Bramble kept a log. And we’re keeping a log. \n\nJAMIE: Are you sure that-\n\nVIOLET: Yes.\n\n//SHE SIGHS//\n\nVIOLET: I’m going to lead this. If Bramble can’t. I want to try. So let me try. Okay?\n\nJUNO, SOFTLY: That’s the spirit, kid.\n\nABAKAR: Violet….\n\n//A MOMENT PASSES// \n\nABAKAR: ... for the truth?\n\nVIOLET: For the truth.\n\nJAMIE: For the truth. \n\n//VIOLET SMILES, CHEEKS WET. ABAKAR WALKS OVER. THEY HUG, JAMIE JOINING IN, BEFORE BREAKING APART.// \n\nCASIDIO: Juno and I are heading out around lunchtime. However, I'm going to give you a list of contacts. Usually, I'm not allowed to do this, but desperate times, desperate measures. These are people who will protect you, okay? For now, just stay here, and lay low. You're doing a good job.\n\nVIOLET: I- thanks.\n\nJAMIE: Can we come with you?\n\nJUNO: 'Fraid not. //HE STANDS, HEADING OVER// This is dangerous. I don't want any kids getting hurt. \n\nABAKAR: Fine.\n\nJUNO: Thanks. \n\n//HE SIGHS//\n\nVIOLET: I’m going to work on the entry. If that’s okay?\n\nJUNO: Of course. Let's get packing, Cas.\n\n//RECORDING ENDS//\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES 14 MORE TIMES DURING THE JOURNEY, THOUGH FOOTAGE HAS BEEN CUT DUE TO RELEVANCE//\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\n//JUNO IS SITTING BY A MAKESHIFT FIRE, BAG AT HIS SIDE. IT'S DARK OUT//\n\nJUNO: Almost there, huh? Site-112. \n\nCASIDIO: Looks like it. How many things have we shot, by now?\n\nJUNO: I stopped counting a bit ago, but- 20 in the past four days, at least. They're definitely gathering here.\n\nCASIDIO: What do you think we'll find?\n\nJUNO: ... I don't know. Probably nothing good.\n\nCASIDIO: I'd love to find something good. It'd be nice if we got there and the problem is almost solved, no need for the journey. \n\nJUNO: Wouldn't that mean our journey was for nothing?\n\n//THE DRONE PAUSES//\n\nCASIDIO: Well... if you think about it, nothing we do has been for nothing. I mean, I'm dead. But I've still been able to save people. I still... I still have an impact. Even if we don't save everyone, we'll still have an impact.\n\nJUNO: You really believe that?\n\nCASIDIO: It's not optimism, Juno. It's just the fact of the matter. I left you because you gave up on yourself. You wouldn't let me help you. The Foundation... there was still work I could do here... all this really saying, I'm glad to have you back.\n\nJUNO: ... I didn't plan on coming back. When I first woke up, after the building went down. I realised I'd survived. And I just closed my eyes again.\n\n//HE TAKES A BREATH//\n\nJUNO: I just thought \"this is it. It's been a good one.\" And then I waited.\n\nCASIDIO: Juju...\n\nJUNO: It's okay. It's okay. I'm... I'm okay.\n\nCASIDIO: No. No, you're not. \n\nJUNO: ... No, I'm not. \n\n//JUNO DRAWS HIS KNEES TO HIS CHEST. TEARS GLITTER ON HIS CHEEKS. HE SOBS. THE DRONE FLIES TO HIS SHOULDER.//\n\nJUNO: I feel fake, Cas. I feel like... like I'm not real. Like I've never been real. Like I'm just walking to the end point, with no purpose. Just waiting to die, so that everyone can stop caring and move on. Even with all of this, I still feel like I'm not going to mean anything when it's over. I'm just... I'm just a tool. That's the truth of it. When I shoot a monster, make a move, dodge a bullet, I'm always going to be doing it on the Foundation's behalf. I don't have an identity. I'm a Foundation Agent. I'm a symbol. I left the field because I didn't want to die a symbol.\n\n//HE SOBS HARDER//\n\nJUNO: I don't have a choice now.\n\nCASIDIO: I'm... I'm so sorry Juno.\n\nJUNO: What do I do, Cas? How do I- what question do I even ask? What do I say?\n\nCASIDIO: I don't know.\n\n//THE DRONE SIGHS//\n\nCASIDIO: I don't think we have the pleasure of doing this for us anymore. I think... I don't think we have a choice here. I don't think we ever do. \n\n//RECORDING CUTS OUT//\n\n------\n\n//RECORDING RESUMES//\n\n//FALLEN TREES SURROUND THE SITE. THE BUILDING IS ALMOST COMPLETELY SMASHED TO PIECES, THE WALLS CAVED IN. SHRIEKS FILL THE AIR.//\n\nJUNO: You recording?\n\nCASIDIO: Yeah.\n\nJUNO: Good. Alright, fuckers. Whoever's listening. This is Juno Serapis. I'm about to burn this bitch to the ground. If you're seeing this, then it probably worked. If not... well, blame it on the girl who gave me the gun.\n\nCASIDIO: Idiot. Let's just go.\n\n//THEY SLOWLY MOVE FORWARD. JUNO LEANS AGAINST HIS CANE. SCP-7916 IS CLIPPED ONTO HIS BELT. A DARK SHAPE MOVES FROM THE SITE//\n\nJUNO: You scared?\n\nCASIDIO: Terrified. \n\nJUNO: Me too.\n\n//THEY REACH THE EDGE. A GIANT CREATURE, WITH TRANSLUCENT SKIN, AND A THICK SKULL OVER IT'S GELATINOUS HEAD LUMBERS OUT. JUNO RAISES THE GUN TO SHOOT.//\n\nCASIDIO: Not yet!

I don't- //THE DRONE RUNS A DATA ANALYSIS. INSIDE THE FACILITY, AT THE CENTER, STANDS A LARGE BLACK PORTAL THAT THE CREATURE JUST EMERGED FROM.// ...

HE SHOOTS THREE OF THEM BUT IS CAUGHT BY THE FOURTH, SMACKED IN THE SHOULDER AND SENT SPRAWLING. JUNO SHOOTS BOTH OF THEM FROM THE GROUND, ARM BLEEDING.\n\nCASIDIO: Get up! There's a partially intact staircase to your right, you can climb up and snipe them.\n\n//JUNO GRUNTS, GETTING TO HIS FEET. A TENTACLE REACHES OUT TO GRAB HIM, AND HE STABS THE EYE AT THE END WITH HIS CANE. LIMPING, HE SHOVES THE GUN INTO ITS HOLSTER, SPRINTING UP THE CRUMBLING STAIRS. ONE STEP BREAKS, NEARLY CAUSING HIM TO FALL. HIS CANE FALLS OVER THE LEDGE, AND HE CATCHES HIMSELF, CRAWLING ONTO THE LEDGE.//\n\nCASIDIO: You okay?\n\nJUNO: Yeah! Just- //HE HISSES IN PAIN AS HIS SHOULDER SCRAPES THE WALL//\n\nCASIDIO: Shoot them!\n\n//JUNO AIMS THE GUN, AND FIRES IN QUICK SUCCESSION. ALL BUT THREE CREATURES ARE SHOT.

Field agents were dispatched, to find that the area around the Superior National Forest, Minnesota, had been destroyed. The ground was burned, and the Site had sustained complete casualties, along with everything within a 10-kilometre radius. \n\nThe only body still identifiable was that of Agent Juno Serapis, who was holding SCP-7916 at the time. Further testing has discovered the gun empty of bullets, and the function seems to match that of any non-anomalous pistol. \n\nAfter a review of the footage recovered from the drone \"CASIDIO\", it's been posited that the destruction of the portal caused a reversal of the events which occurred. \n\nThe Parawatch members have been identified as Violet Olentangy of Dell Rapids, Judith Abakar of Aberdeen, Jamie Barker of Aberdeen, and Delilah \"Bramble\" Caulder of Brookings, South Dakota. The GOC base located in Ohio is being tracked down, with the hope to apprehend Agent Barbara Thompson for further questioning.\n\nThe current theory for why reality reversed during the incident is that upon contact, the effects of SCP-7916 destroyed the rift conceptually, creating what could be described as a reverse vacuum. The conceptual force of the alternate reality upon ours was reversed, along with all created or destroyed by its effect. \n\nThe area around Site-112 that suffered collapse is posited to be the area which the portal was drawing energy from to function. Upon its closure, this area was preserved, in a conceptual grey-area between conceptual linkage and conceptual identity, both of which were destroyed at the same time the effect of SCP-7916 ceased function. \n\nA secondary theory ties into the sense of locational memory - with human subjects, memories are retained of items in the event that the subject directly witnesses the destruction. This could be a similar concept, with the area itself acting as a “witness” to the destruction, and therefore having retained its “memories” of it, leaving it unaffected. \n\nDue to these events, Agent Juno Serapis has been awarded a post-humous Foundation badge of Courage, as well as Dr. Cassidy Dione, who has been promoted to Site Director of Site 160. After viewing the footage, she confirmed that she had a drone matching the one found at the scene, which had disappeared. \n\n\n------\n\n++ //EXCERPT FROM THE INDUCTION CEREMONY OF SITE DIRECTOR CASSIDY DIONE//\n\n//A SMALL CROWD STANDS BENEATH A PLATFORM, STARING AT A MIDDLE-AGED BLONDE WOMAN WITH ROSY CHEEKS.//\n \nDIONE: Hello everyone. I'd like to announce a big change that's going to happen around here. As of recent events, it's been decided that the current measures the Foundation employs to handle XK-Class or apocalyptic scenarios is lacking. As your new Site Director, I've gotten O5 approval to assemble a new Mobile Task Force, specially trained to deal with sudden breaches of a world-endangering scale. \n\n//THE CROWD MURMURS. DIONE GESTURES TO A FIGURE OFFSTAGE, WHO STEPS ON.//\n\nDIONE: I'd like to introduce Agent Deanna Lafayette. The first member of the XK-Class Mobile Task Force: The Juno Longwings.\n\n//SHE SMILES.
