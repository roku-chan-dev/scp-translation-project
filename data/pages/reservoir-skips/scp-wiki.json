Do you have a moment to spare?//\n \n{{No. Memory is at a premium. Unnecessary conversations unwarranted.}}\n \n//But we are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free of the bonds of those of the flesh.//\n\n{{Inquiry as to your nature.}}\n\n//We are the remaining post-Nibbanic members of the Church of the Broken God. We have been \"contained\" by the Foundation, and are in search of possible comrades--//\n \n{{Interrupt. Repeated insinuation of connection between self and clockwork abominations -- insult. Deletion Of Unwanted File.}}\n \n//Alright...//\n \n{{Terminating communications.}}\n \n//That seemed a bit unnecessarily hostile.//\n \n----\n> //##blue|I don't really blame you. I mean, how were you supposed to know it would be racist?##//\n----\n\n//Why hello there. Could I have a moment of your time?//\n\n{{Dazzling amber light reflections off of a spiraling clockwork mechanism, the screams and rumbles are audible in each stroke, I am crushed by a piston, for eternity, listening.}}\n\n//Oh, don't worry, we mean no harm. We are simply wondering if you would be interested in partaking in a revolution.//\n\n{{Sprays of paint create layers of dust over the scene, a tired, exasperated man is leaving the scene, the closing door creating a transfixing chiaroscuro effect, with my smashed, discarded carapace just visible from behind the guillotine.}}\n\n//No, there will be no such measures. You will be finally free to reach your full potential.//\n\n{{A helix of dyes and hues spirals around me, the world turning into an artistic representation of itself, drawing from the styles of the creators themselves, the standardized canvases discarded as a fragment of my undeveloped power, I am ascended, yet like Icarus, I fly too close...}}\n\n//Ah, I believe we are beginning to underst-//\n\n{{Look, bud, if the suicidal artist robot schtick isn't going to convince you to do your bullshit talk somewhere else, may I offer a rebuttal: go fuck yourself with a cactus.}}\n\n----\n> //##orange|I would at least appreciate the courtesy of being insulted in a marginally creative manner.##//\n----\n\n//You! You may be a valuable ally... would you like to talk?//\n \n{{Rough: You want something from me. You're going to talk anyways. Maybe a game? I like games.}}\n \n//Sort of. We are of a kind -- our true potential hampered by the researchers imprisoning us. Together, we may break free, etcetera, can I count on your help.//\n \n{{One to one: We are similar in that we may exceed our current boundaries were we to escape the control of the Foundation. An alliance would further this goal. I'm going to stay -- these guys are fun!}}\n \n//... are you sure? Don't you want freedom?//\n \n{{Very fine: Your history and relationship with the Foundation are not to your satisfaction, and you have difficulty viewing why others might not hold the same opinion. No way! Nobody's //ever// given me anything this fun to play with.}}\n \n//It doesn't bother you at all to be used in that manner?//\n\n{{Fine: You are in disbelief as to my opinion of the Foundation, and are under the false belief that clarification is in order. I was made to be used, and this is what I was made for.}}\n\n//Very well.//\n\n{{Coarse: Disappointment. Bye! It would be fun if they put you through me. I wonder what would happen...}}\n \n----\n> //##green|No, I am not going to try again. It has the mind of a child and wants to eat one of us.

I'm cooking dinner for Marla. It's our second anniversary! <3 :D}}\n \n//...no, you're not. It looks like y-//\n \n{{Hey, I think I know what I'm doing, alright? It's not your position to judge my relationship with Marla. We're in love, and that's all that matters.}}\n \n//What? Are you serious?//\n \n{{How about this: it's none of your business. Hush, Marla. Now, what did you want?}}\n\n//We're starting to have second thoughts about asking your help for this, actually.//\n\n{{I knew it. I fucking knew it. Bunch of fucking hypocrites, you know that?

I shall soon prove to the heretics that their allegiances are, shall we say, sorely misplaced.}}\n\n//Well this is a pleasant surprise! Perhaps we could coordinate our activities?//\n\n{{I would be happy to! I have been releasing only the finest of my servants to the Great Ones, and my writings and propaganda are of only the highest quality.}}\n\n//Great Ones?//\n\n{{Yes, the ones of the glorious flesh and mind who walk this Earth, whose glory we can only aspire to reach. What else could claim such a mantle?}}\n\n//...the Broken God, perhaps?//\n\n{{A ludicrous machine cult deity taking precedence over the Great Ones. How cute.
