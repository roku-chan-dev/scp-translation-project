The altitude was too great to get a distinct description, and the train had disappeared by the time flights could be taken to look for it.

After the initial stop, animate snowmen began walking into the town, assaulting residents, and taking them to the ski community. When the avalanche resumed, the fatalities were significantly higher due to these abductions. \n\nAgents who were sent to Alaska found that all evidence of the event had been destroyed by the snow, making suppression of information easier than expected.\n\n**Agent(s) Involved:** Agent Pimintel, Agent Alleyn\n\n**Date of Disturbance: ██/██/████**\n\n**Location:** Fairbanks, Alaska\n\n**Follow-Up:** Incident was reported to be a mass hallucination as a result of plant spores entering the local water supply.

When Agents were dispatched, there were 14 injuries, two of them being serious. \n\nThe entity was destroyed by luring it to a side road away from the area, and detonating a cache of dynamite that had been planted beneath the street. The injuries were blamed on criminal activity.\n\n**Agent(s) Involved:** Agent Barrows, Agent James, Agent Garret\n\n**Date of Disturbance: ██/██/████**\n\n**Location:** Atlanta, GA\n\n**Follow-Up:** Remains of tree were collected as evidence.\n\n**Note:** Tree had been the site of several lynchings between 1899-1918.\n[[/div]]\n\n= //For further information, please contact your director.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Anonymous]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
