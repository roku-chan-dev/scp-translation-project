They anoint him with blood mixed with oil and myrrh, singing praise to the Wounded Lord of Heaven as the blood drips down into the grooves of the cold mosaic tiles. Coils of smoke, sweet with incense and the smell of burnt meat, rise to the high ceiling.\n\n“...You who have slain the Bull of Heaven, you who have slain Aung-su-Dhazu, you who have set down the law of might; here is the one chosen by you, the one appointed by your hand; here is the one who walks as you walk, who acts as you act; Here is the one who works with your hands, who speaks with your voice; Here is the one whose thoughts are your thoughts, whose decrees are your decrees.”\n\nThe priests raise the relics of authority over their king: the war-mace, the eagle-fletched arrow, the horse-goad, the horn, the brand, the scourge, the red bough. With their left hands they make the sign of lordship. Seven voices cast themselves against the temple walls, as if they are each a legion speaking as one. \n\n“Here is the god-man, in this place where heaven and earth are joined. By these seven signs of authority, O king of heaven and earth, walk among us!”\n\nThe seven-legion chant echoes, and is swallowed up by silence. The drum sounds seven times, mallet blows like thunder.\n\nThe cantor at his scroll-stand, head bowed, adjusts his cloudy spectacles and raises his high, clear voice.\n\n“After the Most August Lord had slain Aung-su-Dhazu and built the heavens and the earth from the parts of its body, **##982F1F|He##** set down the law that governs all things. When **##982F1F|He##** had done so, **##982F1F|He##** called forth the Seven and said to them ‘Know that I am merciful, offspring of my enemy, for I grant you a place of honor in this world I have made. You shall bear me mighty sons, whom I shall place as kings over the whole of the world.’\n\n“Six obeyed, rejecting their base natures and submitting to His will as was ordained in the law. But the seventh resisted, for it was prideful above its station, and it had great chaos within it, and it was ignorant of the lawful ordering of the heavens and the earth. The demon spat filth at the great King, saying unto **##982F1F|Him##** [SADDAGH YA SHEN KHOE].\n\n“Thus the King decreed that the rebellious seventh should be corrected and instructed in the ways of order, so that it might shed its animal ignorance. **##982F1F|He##** meted out just punishment for its rebellion against **##982F1F|Him##**, and put it to the trials. But the rebellious one remained obstinate, saying unto **##982F1F|Him##** [SADDAGH YA SHEN KHOE]. \n\n“Seeing that it would not be corrected from its error, the King decreed that it would be cast into the pit, where it might be consigned to the pain of death-without-death. This **##982F1F|He##** decreed, and this He did with his own hand.”\n\nThe Scarlet King stands. His priests part like water before him, sinking to their arthritic knees and pressing their wrinkled foreheads to the marble. The conquering king strides forth between the kneeling ranks of priests and nobles; down the gallery, towards the Bedchamber.\n\nHidden mechanisms in the walls open the great doors to welcome him. A crimson veil hangs from the doorway, obscuring what lies beyond.\n\nAs the King reaches the veil, as he brushes asides the curtain and passes out of sight, the gathered masses cry out as one.\n\n//”Shomash udal vadukkat.”//\n\nO ruling Red Lord.\n\n//”Shomash shomash, shomash udal anam.”//\n\nO Lord, O, Lord; O Red Lord, show mercy.\n\nAnd the great doors swing shut.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/14| Previous Chapter]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
