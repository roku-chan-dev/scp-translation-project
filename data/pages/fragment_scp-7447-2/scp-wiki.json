Within any situation, the subject is able to manipulate probability and outcome of his surroundings. My assistant leads and I have made great strides into theorising how we would refine SCP-7447's anomalous property to create consistent and useful results. Imagine the improvement it could have on mechanical maintenance,  Mobile Task Force Operations, or just everyday mundane activities to make the Foundation run smoother. The potential of this project could not be understatedand I do hope you accept our proposal.\n\n##FFD126|__**Result:**__## With a vote of 9-2-2 in favour, the project was granted funding as per O5 council approval.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Luxmi_engine.jpg\n| caption=LaxEn-1 mid-construction\n| width=342px\n| align=center]]\n\n[[module css]]\n\n.scp-image-block .scp-image-caption {\n    background-color: #FFD126;\n    color: #000000;\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n##FFD126|**PURPOSE:**## Use SCP-7447's comatose body as a medium for his anomalous property to be controlled, thus allowing for highly controlled and beneficial probability manipulation via the ##FFD126|**Laxmi Engine**##.\n\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n##FFD126|**ABSTRACT:**## Consider a system within the larger macroscopic experience in any given system described by a set of configuration variables. Typically, the action of an individual within said system is an integral of a system Lagrangian. The presence of SCP-7447 alters the quantum state of multiple variables within its Probability Inversion and Fluctuation Field which results in two logically extreme outcomes.\n\nThe Laxmi Engine reduces the variables in a controlled system to near-zero. Placing SCP-7447 within such a system allows for controlled manipulation of the quantum state of any object or personnel completing an action within the specified chambers. While we may not be able to completely control cause and effect, it should result in some type of desirable outcome.\n\n##FFD126|**DESCRIPTION:**##  The Laxmi engine is a Foundation-designed Outcome Assurance Device designed to guarantee the best possible result of certain experiments, operations, or missions. The device consists of three interconnected main components which are:\n*  **LaxEn-1:** //Main holding chamber.// LaxEn-1 is a localised near-zero variance environment in which SCP-7447 is held. To support SCP-7447, advanced life support systems are present within LaxEn-1. The chamber is lined with modified hypersensitive Akivavolatilic panels to absorb all discharged anomalous radiation emanating from SCP-7447 once powered on. This radiation is filtered and fed into LaxEn-3.\n\n*  **LaxEn-2:** //Quantum Spectrograph.// LaxEn-2 is located between LaxEn-1 and -3. Consists of converging conduits from LaxEn-1 leading into the Quantum Spectrograph. By acting as a filter, only the radiation that results in a beneficial outcome is fed into LaxEn-3. The unwanted radiation is fed out of the site via ventilation.\n\n*  **LaxEn-3:** //Output Chamber.// After the desired radiation is fed from LaxEn-2, it is fed into LaxEn-3 where actions can be taken with an altered quantum state. The chamber is similarly a near-zero variance environment and is lined with Akivarelective panels, which serve multiple purposes. To retain all radiation within LaxEn-3, prevent leakage, and allow the radiation only to affect the action taking place within the chamber and not the chamber itself.\n\n----\n=  [[size small]] ##FFD126| __**END ADDENDUM**__## [[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n= [[size small]] ##FFD126| __**ADDENDUM.7447.5:**__## Activation Log[[/size]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"table3\"]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFD126; width: 5%;\"]]\n##000000| ATTEMPT 1 ##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid grey\"]]\n[[span class=\"st\"]]**RESULT:**[[/span]] Failure to activate\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid grey\"]]\n[[span class=\"st\"]]**REASON:**[[/span]] Power failure\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFD126; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid grey\"]]\n[[span class=\"st\"]]**NOTES:**[[/span]] 20 seconds before the activation, a site-wide electrical outage occurred due to a short circuit within the Site-44 west wing breaker.

The project was set to continue as it was theorised that the increased strength of the Probability Inversion and Fluctuation Field would increase the effectiveness of the Luxmi Engine.
