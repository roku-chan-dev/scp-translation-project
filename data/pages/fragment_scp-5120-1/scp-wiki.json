SCP-5120 was founded sometime between 337 and 361 AC, and has remained isolated until its discovery in 2004. It is distinctly Roman in origin but lacks influence from the Abrahamic faiths. SCP-5120 has a small population compared to its size, leading to the majority of houses being unoccupied. A notable land mark of SCP-5120 is the Grand Library, where documents previously thought lost to time can be found.\n\n40% of SCP-5120 is buried underneath the undecomposed corpse of an anomalous organism, 5 km in length, similar to //Canis lupus italicus// designated SCP-5120-1. SCP-5120-1 produces a perception filter, directing the attention of an observer away from the area, measuring approximately 7 kilometers in diameter from the center of the city. Once an individual is made aware of the perception filter, it loses efficacy and the individual can perceive SCP-5120 normally.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[size larger]]**Addendum.5120.1:**[[/size]] Discovery of SCP-5120 occurred due to a raid of a church of the Broken God.

Can you tell me what you know about them?\n\n//[ The Flame pauses and gives a perplexed expression. ]//\n\n**Flamen Volturnalis:** I... assume you are speaking of the god Mekhane. That's what we call him. He was once worshiped by a section of our people a long time ago before we found sanctuary here.

She is the one who guided our people to this city.\n\n//[ The Flame began to raise his arms to the air. ]//\n\n**Flamen Volturnalis:** This city was crafted by the gods. A place where our people could live and worship without judgment and persecution. The Mother of Rome was a beacon for us to follow. As you are aware, she can only be seen by those she allows to see her. Without her, we would have been discovered long ago. We are thankful to her.\n\n**Dr. Horne:** I have been to see her. She is quite a wonder. Can you tell me more about her history?\n\n//[ The Flamen Volturnalis pauses before answering. ]//\n\n**Flamen Volturnalis:** Long ago the city was attacked. She acted as a shield and allowed herself to be wounded to protect the people of //Fidelis Roma//. Many of our people perished, but we survived. Ever since she has given us the gift of isolation. We are safe because of her. She... is our savior.\n\n//[ An apostle of Voltunalis calls for the Flamen. ]//\n\n**Flamen Volturnalis:** If you would pardon me, It appears I am needed.

We made our decision, and promised to pay them for aid. Nothing more. They asked for too much, so we declined... I am not surprised though. We gave them an opportunity and they squandered it.

They are desperate to gather their \"God\" and are naive. We do not hold any of their artifacts within our city. Why would we bring any of their relics with us to this place? That would be blasphemy.\n\n**Dr. Horne:** Thank you for elaborating.\n\n//[ Dr. Horne glances at her notes again. ]//\n\n**Dr. Horne:** I understand the Mother died defending this city. Can I ask you who she was defending it from?\n\n**Flamen Dialis:** The culprit is unknown to us. The few survivors of the fall of The Mother of Rome hid underground. Anyone who witnessed what happened that day, died that day. It was a great tragedy that the people of //Fidelis Roma// mourn to this day.\n\n**Dr. Horne:** You're saying there is no information at all about that day?\n\n**Flamen Dialis:** There is nothing. Not even in our sacred records. What we have been lead to assume is that somehow, an enemy of Rome was able to enter our sanctuary. We believe the Christians are to blame.
