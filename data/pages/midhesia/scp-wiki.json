I do NOT own the rights to this video but I couldn't find it anywhere else, so I figured I'd upload it. I checked the Midhesian node but it's down. It's kind of creepy looking at these formerly funny god awful videos in retrospect, as no one has been to Midhesia in years.

Spreading this kind of information is dangerous. The implications here make Oneiroi harass corporeals. Take this video down. It gives the ARG community a bad name. Midhesia isn't a real place.\n\nAnd... don't read these comments.

Michaels** | {{2 months ago}}\nI went to Midhesia once. I think the dreamspace isn't there anymore because its dreamer died. I think his name was Bill. He liked to take sailing vacations to the Philippines while he was in real life. \n\nI have heard of another island paradise sort of dream space called \"Mayday\" and it's also open to everyone. Open yourself to the Mayday.OW node to begin the joining.\n{{👍 5 | 👎}}\n\n**⚰️Concrete Tomb** \n\n|| Midhesia is a honeypot. A Xiupanian space with a candy coating. Go there, and your subconscious is removed - if you're human. You're just completely killed if you're a Oneiroi. These types of realms are everywhere. Just stay in Oneiroi West.

The only difference is there's water instead of the floating void space. It's a bit sunnier as well. I created Midhesia and several other honeypots to lure human visitors of the dream world and create more Xiupanian copies. I'm a little confused why the Foundation is sending its agents to disrupt this process as they set it in motion to begin with. Do you remember me Dr. Glass? I'm doing as you asked... Maybe your agent has gone rogue? This is big brain stuff that is probably beyond me.\n\nI will still eat the dreams until they're gone.
