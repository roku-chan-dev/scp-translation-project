Don't let the beginning fool you, this isn't a failed self-deletion. There's a lot going here, much of it deeper than it may seem. 100% worth a second read through, 200% worth reading through the follow up.\n>\n> [[[SCP-4999|SCP-4999: Someone to Watch Over us]]] by CadaverCommander. All I need to say about this one is that it's been a long time since I've read something and gotten chills because of it.\n>\n> [[[SCP-4017|SCP-4017: An Epilogue, Too Late to Matter]]] by 9Volt. There's a LOT of stuff here and all of it is extremely interesting. Exploring some aspects of Volt's own Second Hytoth, this piece really takes the 'History' theme to the max, exploring a lot of the Foundationverse through out. Warning: reading it may cause you to spend hours reading the other Church of the Second Hytoth articles.\n\nUncle Nicolini\n> [[[scp-4007|SCP-4007: Kagemusha]]] by weizhong is by far my favorite article in the entire contest.
