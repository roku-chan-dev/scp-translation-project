Their fear coursed through my very being, both their downfall and their reasoning.\n\nThey'd rend my very essence. Stripping sinew from my bones, unraveling the tapestry of my flesh in relentless strokes.\n\nThey unleashed abominations, one after another, hoping each would be the harbinger of my demise. Praying for the sweet release of death. Oh, how I //yearned// for the numbing embrace of agony to silence my wretched existence.\n\nYet, it eluded me. Anguish as crystalline shards plunged deep, gouging eyes, shattering bones, and coaxing my very essence to seep forth.\n\nI bellowed, a primal roar born of torment, a futile defiance against the inevitable. In the throes of the grotesque, I waged a battle against my own monstrous nature.\n\nWithin this acidic hell, I was reborn again and again through the crucible of sadistic tests, a lunatic's experiment driving even the most savage creatures to the brink of madness.\n\n\nUntil, one fateful week, it stopped. A twisted respite that left me anticipating the impending storm. Head raised, bracing for the agony I'd grown accustomed to, but it never arrived. The silence mocked me.\n\nLaying in the shadows, I waited. They observed, eyes devoid of horror, filled instead with vindictive satisfaction. Laughter clawed its way out of me, a cacophony echoing through the empty room. Mocking their feeble attempts at vengeance.\n\nUntil it stopped.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nIn an instant, I was torn asunder, familiar agony a serrated knife through my consciousness. Darkness enveloped me, an emptiness consuming every fiber of my being.\n\nHatred burned within, an inferno of rage echoing through timeless voids.\n\nIt was an abyss, a void that transcended time. Minutes, hours, decades, or a millenniumâ€”such distinctions lost meaning in the eternity of nothingness.\n\nUntil I found a light inside the darkness. An eternity passed unnoticed. Through glass panels, I beheld those unfamiliar, oblivious to my identity. A grin etched upon my new form, hostility brewing within.\n\nThey granted me more than I could fathom. Bestowed upon me greater power.
