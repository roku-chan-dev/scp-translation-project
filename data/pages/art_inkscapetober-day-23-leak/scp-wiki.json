Well, one and one adds up to this coat of arms. In the middle we see a modified version of the arms of the Earl of Pitt, after which the city of Pittsburgh is named. The coat has been heavily greazed up. The outer circle cotains the motto of Pittsburgh, //Benigno Numine//, but the stains have transformed this into //Benign U Mine//.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** This one was a lot of fun to make. The idea that a coat of arms can leak and in doing so en passant changes the motto is just very funny to me.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-22-open| Day 22: Open]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-24-extinct| Day 24: Extinct]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Kensing.png\n> **Name:** Kensing\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nKensing.png is a composite.
