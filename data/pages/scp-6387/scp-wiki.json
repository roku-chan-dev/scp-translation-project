Subject was hairless, with tapered ears and cloven, hoof-like feet; no reproductive organs were present. SCP-6387's hands, disproportionately large, each possessed four digits with protruding claws measuring 6 cm in length. Whether or not SCP-6387 was sapient remains unknown.\n\nSCP-6387 was first sighted in Oakland Cemetery on October 15, 1923. Shortly after midnight, 50-year-old groundskeeper Joseph Rutledge awoke to the sound of an intruder. Initially suspecting grave robbers, Rutledge set out to investigate, whereupon he discovered SCP-6387 digging furiously at the site of a fresh burial plot. \n\nStartled, Rutledge shot SCP-6387 twice in the chest with a .38 Smith & Wesson revolver. Subject expired instantly, with Rutledge later informing the civilian authorities. Agents embedded in the local police force subsequently alerted the Foundation to suspected extranormal activity. SCP-6387's remains were transported to [[[SCP-6578|Site-44]]] for research, with amnestics administered to all witnesses. \n\nThe grave targeted by SCP-6387 was exhumed, and found to contain the remains of 24-year-old milkmaid Charlotte Abernathy, who was reported to have died following an epileptic seizure the previous morning. The casket's interior exhibited numerous prominent scratch marks; cause of death was deemed suffocation. Ms. Abernathy was reburied without further incident.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-leonerd-s-author-page More from this author...]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6386]]] | SCP-6387 | [[[SCP-6388]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Dr Leonerd]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP-6387.jpeg\n> **Name:** St Peter's Catholic cemetery, Suquamish (CURTIS 974).jpeg\n> **Author:** Asahel Curtis\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Peter%27s_Catholic_cemetery,_Suquamish_(CURTIS_974).jpeg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
