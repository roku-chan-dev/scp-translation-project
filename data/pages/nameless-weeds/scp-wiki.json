Roadside plants and flowers whose names are not known or deemed not worth knowing.\n\nIn the village where I was born, depopulation had been progressing since I was a child. Actually, the population was small to begin with, and due to the aging population, there were hardly any people who could have children. Even so, it was a very peaceful village, always filled with the sound of many children playing. It was a small settlement located in the mountainous area.\n\nSo, why is it a village with so many children, you ask? Well, it's not that people moved here or anything like that. All these kids were born in this village.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nThe elementary and junior high schools in the village I attended at the time had many children as old as the number of adults in the entire village.\nThere were not enough teachers, and the adults who were available sometimes taught in their place. It was kind of funny and hard to stop laughing when the man from the house next door, who usually played with us, was seriously acting as a teacher.\nI still can't forget the expression on his face, standing at the podium, smiling shyly.\n\nOne time I worked hard on my studies with my classmates, and another time we made funny faces at each other when the teacher wasn't looking, and were scolded in front of everyone when we were caught doing so. During recess, we would always go to the playground to play tag.\n\nWe were sent to and from school by our parents until early elementary school, but when we reached junior high school, we started going home with our friends. Kicking rocks, playing rock-paper-scissors with the rule that the loser gets to hold the baggage, I never thought going to and from school could be so much fun.\nWe would sometimes proudly show off the marks we were given instead of attendance numbers, like apples, cats, and various others. From kindergarten to middle school, it was the rule to identify individuals by those marks.\nWhen it comes to the reasons for fights, it was usually when someone would pick flowers recklessly or trample through a meadow. Other times, it was just fighting over the game controller.\nI really miss those days when I was happy or sad over such childish things.\n\nThere was even a rule that you were not allowed to leave the village until you graduated from junior high school, but I didn't really care about that.\nAlthough it was small, there was an athletic meet and a cultural festival, and anyway, everyone got along well.\nI was glad to have those children, I thought sincerely so. It was a fun school life.\n\nI was very sad on the day of //Graduation//, but it is such a small village. We smiled and said goodbye, knowing that we would see each other again soon.\nI left the village when I entered high school, so I have not seen those children since then, but I am sure they are doing well somewhere in the village.\n\nI had parents, a house, and a proper name. But for the children who were not, the whole village took good care of them.\nFor those who were not yet born, everyone loved them, saying things like, “I want you to sleep well and grow up well.”, “Are they going to be okay in such a shady place?” and so on and so on.\n\nAs I recall, the first time I saw it properly was when I was about the age of kindergarten.\nI had never seen a baby before. They were glossy, soft, and looked as if they would break just by touching. I was surprised when an adult took me to see it for the first time, but I immediately accepted it and begged my parents to go see those every day.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nIt's time to graduate from junior high school or, if you are an early child, around the fifth grade.\n\nSuddenly, it pops.\n\nThe black, grainy things and an incomprehensible, semi-transparent, gooey substance that emitted an overwhelmingly sweet smell, almost enough to make one lose consciousness, were scattered around as those children burst and shattered in all directions.\nWe called it //Graduation//.\nWe picking up all the things that had once been our classmates that had fallen all over the place,\n“Thank you for playing with me.”\n“If you see me again, please be good friends.”\nWe would whisper these things to those children as we cried.\n\nI still remember it clearly.\nWhen I gathered my friend, who had collapsed into a state somewhere between liquid and solid, with both hands, I thought, “This child will never smile at me like usual again.”, “I will never be able to touch that beloved green skin again.” and so on and so on.\nWhile feeling the faint warmth that still lingered, a mix of slight regret, loneliness, and, at the same time, a joyful emotion welled up inside me.\nBecause I had been taught back then, when I went to see it with an adult, that //Graduation// is a very joyous occasion.\n“Congratulations, //Graduation//. Congratulations,” I said, tightly gripping my friend, who was stuck to my palm, and I celebrated their new beginning.\n\nThe sound of it crushing and squishing seemed to echo as if it were the final response. Watching it being dragged across the floor by the rag, it felt like the memories of this child were slowly sinking into our hearts.\nThe memories of the time we spent together rushed through my mind like a carousel of fleeting images.\nNow that I think about it, that was the first time I experienced the death of someone close to me. Surrounded by the overwhelmingly sweet scent, with my friend stuck to my clothes, face, and both hands, I cried while laughing.\n\nThe things we gathered were all supposed to be handed over to the adults.\nBut, of course, the child at that age wouldn’t follow such rules, would you?\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nHere, look at this.\nThis was a friend of mine.\nWhat does it look like to you?\n @@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/nameless-weeds/medium.jpg width=\"400px\"]]\n @@ @@\nYes, seeds.\n\nYou know those weeds that just sort of slither up from the cracks in the asphalt on roads and parking lots? The ones you don’t know where they came from, don’t know their name, but are strangely tough? You know what I mean, right?\n\nThose children were all weeds.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nDon’t you think they were lovely too? Small, yet strong, and fragile.\nBefore you knew it, they were growing by the rice fields on the way to school. Beneath the utility pole in front of the school. In the corner of the playground. They even grew in the garden once.\nAnyway, those children were just like that.\nEven though they were born special, to us, they were friends we played with, cute, adorable children.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nPerhaps they grew naturally, or maybe the adults were scattering seeds like that around the village.\nI know because I've seen it before, but that has a growth stage to it.\nI wonder if the soil in the village was suitable for its growth?\nBefore I knew it, small stems and leaves that had sprouted here and there grew taller and stretched up into the sky in no time.\nWeeds, you know, have a surprisingly strong vitality. Those were no exception.\n\nAbout a month later, I’m not sure how to describe it, but a fruit shaped like a human and colored a pale green starts to appear.\nA fruit with a thin membrane at the tip of the stem forms, and you can see the inside through the membrane. Occasionally, something seems to wriggle inside it. Could it be the first movements, like fetal movement? It’s slightly larger than a human head, maybe.\nAs soon as the membrane breaks and it falls to the ground with a soft thud, it lets out its first cry. It was just like a real human baby.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nThere were times when it was a familiar face.\nIn those moments, we would feel even more affectionate towards it, gather around, gently stroke its cheek, and whisper, “Good to see you back.”\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\nThe fruits born in that way were collected by the people of higher status in the village, and the whole village took care of them.\nIt was a place with little stimulation to begin with. For the adults, I think that was probably a kind of entertainment to distract from the monotony of their unchanging days.\n\nYou all must have grown plants as a hobby, right?\nIt's the same thing.\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n\nName? There is no such thing, and we don't bother giving one.\nWeeds don't need names, do they?\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=kei_comet, and Verzweiflung]]\n\n> **Filename:** medium.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user kei_comet]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/file:8476395-2-9e92\n> **Additional Notes:** Images taken by [[*user kei_comet]] were processed and illustrations were added.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
