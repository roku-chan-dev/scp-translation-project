We understand that this oversight has posed a significant health hazard to Site-19 personnel and residents, and would like to remind anyone who believes they have been affected to schedule a physical wellness assessment at their earliest availability.  \n\nWe have since implemented new measures to prevent a repeat of this incident. Moving forward, research personnel involved in SCP-7052 experiments are to mark used spoons with provided \"RECTAL USE ONLY\" labels, which can be found in testing-approved containment chambers. Additionally, we have moved the SCP-7052 waste disposal location to a wing further away from Site-19's canteen. We hope these measures are sufficient in preventing future mix-ups between SCP-7052 spoons and regular dining utensils. \n\nThank you for your patience,\n\nSite-19 Cafeteria Services\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@         @@",
