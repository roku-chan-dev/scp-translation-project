Luckily, Heather Mason came to save the day.\n\n[[div class=\"indented\"]]\nIt took her one passing remark to win him over.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"heather\"]]\"Let's get that //godawful// cicada stench off you. Do you have a spare incinerator?\"[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"narration indented\"]]\nAt **The Void**'s local second-hand store, Heather picked out his outfit. She traded his soot-stained, gut-garnished overcoat with attire that no memeticist worth their salt could leave home without:\n\nA sweater vest and a pair of khakis.\n\nAdamo gaped at his own reflection in Heather's face-screen.\n[[/div]]\n\n\"I look like someone's deadbeat uncle.\"\n\n[[div class=\"narration indented\"]]\nThe pair crossed 'wardrobe malfunction' off the mental bucket list and slumped into a nearby alcove. They stared off into the distance. For the next half-hour, the pair was still. Faceless passersby flowed along in a stream of monotony.\n\nWhat felt like days before, the pair had bid their old reality //adieu// when it faded out from under them. They travelled on different journeys but found themselves at the same destination.\n\nWherever that was.\n\nHeather bobbed her face-screen to the side and noticed Adamo frowning. It was a brief flicker, but it sent her searching for a reason. Was he exhausted? For sure, but he showed that in his shoulders. Hungry? Maybe. There was a Taco Bell a half-block away, if they craved it, but no. There was something else. His gaze held secrets.\n\nShe had secrets, too.

That was her anchor. That was her normal. It had taken the better part of two years to get used to, and she spent hours upon angst-ridden hours fearing how the world would perceive her.\n\nThe time after she received it was the hardest in her life. The Foundation had her cooped up for three months. A brief time for an 'anomalous humanoid entity' — which is how Containment Security rats called it — but aeons for her. Eventually, through a chain of events she didn't dare question, she broke out. Her adoptive moms came to find her, and for the next year-and-a-half, they were on the lam.\n\nAnd now Adamo was treating her 'anomaly' as a toy, a set piece. He was probing her like the Jailors did. She remembered the anguish that kept her up for weeks. //He's just like them,// she thought. //Just like them!//\n\nBut surely, he had faced considerable distress, too, hadn't he? An anomaly ripped him from the world. He watched his family, his friends, his colleagues, and everything he knew, slip through his fingers like coarse sand.\n\nMaybe he empathised. Maybe he looked to her 'anomaly' the same way he looked at his. Maybe he just wanted to understand.\n\nShe forced herself to internalize all these feelings, for the briefest moment, and focused on her breathing.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Apataphysics/pata-logo.png class=\"scene-break\"]]\n\n\"Hey, Heather?\"\n\n[[span class=\"heather\"]]\".\"[[/span]]\n\n\"You still with me?\"\n\n[[span class=\"heather\"]]\"..\"[[/span]]\n\n\"Hey, if you can make jokes, then so can I.
