  "content": "Hi my name is Kestin Skip'ness Apollyon River Way and I have three articles above -10 (that's not how I got my name) so I figured I would hurry up and make an author page before they tank. Maybe I'll make this into something better eventually, but don't count on it.\n\nStuff I've written on the wiki:\n* [[[Dr. Bridge Over Troubled Water]]]: A tale for the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/an-incredibly-important-announcement Crack Fiction Contest], April 2016. The sequel to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/i-wanna-be-the-very-best SCPokemon] nobody ever asked for. It is both intentionally and unintentionally terrible.\n\n* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/its-not-pronounced-like-the-thesaurus-dammit It's Not Pronounced Like the Thesaurus, Dammit!]: Another tale for the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/an-incredibly-important-announcement Crack Fiction Contest], April 2016. Because of this tale, I am technically a contest winner. This makes me a Cool Kid.\n\n* [[[Untitled]]]: A tale for the [[[D-Class Contest]]], September 2016. Two people talk in a room. They don't have names. Not much happens. I'm better at concepts than execution; this is where it shows.\n * Also available in [http://ja.scp-wiki.net/untitled Japanese].\n\nOther stuff I've done:\n* [https://progeny-ex-machina.tumblr.com/post/130789598054/and-now-i-want-to-write-the-tale-of-cleferella Cleferella]: \"I want the next Disney princess to be an Alto,\" somebody said one day. They never should have capitalized that A. Notable for being [http://scp-l4-clef-alto-001.tumblr.com/post/130796541105/progeny-ex-machina-and-now-i-want-to-write-the canon], and for being [http://scpfoundation.ru/forum/t-1396085/klefuska translated] by a foreign branch without actually being on the wiki. That's right, I had a story translated //before ever posting anything to the site//. I should get some kind of award for that.\n\n* [http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-1775381/lazily-parodic-comic-adaptations-of-tales Bad SCP Comics]: Parodies of various tales. Now with its own [http://badscpcomics.tumblr.com/ tumblr] and [https://badscpcomics.imgur.com/ imgur]. So far I've done [[[Duke 'till Dawn]]], and...well, that's it. //So far.//\n\n* [REDACTED]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
