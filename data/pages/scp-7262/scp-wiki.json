SCP-7262 is not to be permitted access to any items it could use to potentially harm itself.\n\nSCP-7262 is to be administered Quetiapine, Fluvaxomine, and Bupropion on a regular basis by its medical team. Requested augments to this regimen are to be reviewed by Site-264's medical staff.\n\nSCP-7262 is to have weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Kenneth Hart. As SCP-7262's mental state is linked with its anomalous properties, staff are to refrain from relaying upsetting information to SCP-7262 unless deemed absolutely necessary. Failure to do so may trigger its anomalous properties. Additionally, usage of SCP-7262's preferred name and pronouns is recommended when interacting with it.\n\n**Edit as of 05/11/2022:** Due to SCP-7262's aversion to eating as a result of its poor mental state, culinary staff have been notified to provide meals that it has expressed favoritism towards in the past.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Description**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=12\n|speed=1\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=256px\n|height=150px\n|url= Art.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Artwork SCP-7262 drew during its second week in containment.\n]]\n\nSCP-7262 is a 24-year-old non-binary human formerly identified as Jonathan \"Gutz\" Everett.  When in a heightened emotional state, SCP-7262’s body will undergo multiple physiological changes that would typically result in death. These changes typically entail damage to the structure and function of joints, ligaments, and tendons, as well as complex fractures. Organ damage, internal bleeding, and gross distension of limbs, trunk, and head are also common. \n\nDuplication or disappearance of organs and bodily fluids has also been observed. It is also typical for bodily fluids to become discolored or to be replaced with various beverages. However, this damage does not appear to cause SCP-7262 any emotional distress or discomfort. For a list of documented alterations, see [# SCP-7262 Alteration Log]. When SCP-7262 returns to its emotional baseline, all of the damages will reverse with no complications.\n\nIt has been noted that SCP-7262's medical records prior containment indicate that it had recently sustained three broken ribs, a broken arm, and a broken nose. When discovered, no proof of this injury was present, leading to the conclusion that SCP-7262's anomalous properties reset any non-anomalous injuries.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Discovery**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-7262 was discovered on 04/16/2022 when it called emergency services upon observing its anomalous properties.

I like that better than my deadname. If I had to chose the name you people called me, it would be Gutz. Cause that’s my name. But, the number is like… a cool nickname.\n\n**Dr. Diamond:** ‘Deadname’. Are you gender non-conforming?\n\n**SCP-7262:** Yeah. I’m non-binary. I’m still like, super confused about all of this, but it makes me really happy that you asked.

Uh, pastel gore, aesthetic gore art work. It’s kinda how I get out my feelings when times are tough. Instead of um, gouging out my organs, I draw characters gouging out their organs.

SCP-7262 has the following diagnostics on file://\n\n* //Borderline Personality Disorder//\n* //Generalized Anxiety Disorder//\n* //Major Depressive Disorder//\n\n//Although not an exhaustive list, the following behaviors have been observed://\n\n* //Poor self esteem;//\n* //Self defeating and harming behaviors;//\n* //Suicidal ideation;//\n* //Panic and anxiety attacks with no external trigger;//\n* //Extreme emotional swings;//\n* //Dissociation;//\n* //Reliance on social media;//\n\n//SCP-7262 has been kept on its previously prescribed medications to attempt to alleviate its symptoms.//\n\n//Additionally, SCP-7262 appeared incredibly distressed by the fact that it would not be allowed to contact any one from the outside world for the entirety of its time in containment. In response, its anomalous effect has been rapidly activating multiple times a day. Attempts to alleviate this stress in other ways are currently being discussed.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Addendum 2: Research**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIt was decided that as SCP-7262's mindset appears to play an integral part in its anomaly's function, research is to be done into its past relations and interactions.\n\nThe following will be split into three separate addenda:\n\nAddendum 2-A: In-person Relations[[footnote]]Peers, coworkers, past teachers, bosses (this includes its current boss previous to its entrance into the Foundation), and family members.[[/footnote]]\nAddendum 2-B: Interpersonal Relations\nAddendum 2-C: Familial Relations\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Addendum 2-A: In-Person Relations**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFoundation psychologist Dr. Kenneth Hart reached out to a collection of persons that SCP-7262 has known within recent years for further information about SCP-7262. All interviewees were told that SCP-7262 is a missing person.\n\nAlthough many interviews revealed similar information, below are relevant portions of these interviews that revealed unique information. During the interviews, SCP-7262 was referred to with masculine honorifics.

I don't think I could tell you anything about why he'd be missing.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Well, any information is helpful. What type of person was he back then?\n\n**Mr. Bray:** Less weird. He made more efforts to actually interact with the other guys in his grade.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** What does that mean?\n\n**Mr. Bray:** It means what I said it means.

His first and mostly second year, he was one of the club’s most active and hard working members. But, he came back the next year different. I think it was stress. He had his first seizure during the club, his health issues probably took a toll on him. He eventually just stopped showing up all together. Which is a shame, he’s a really talented artist. I wonder what he’s doing now. Besides uh, being missing.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** I see. So you think he began to miss because of his health issues?\n\n**Mr. Ryan:** That, and something else. Even before his seizures started that next year, he was different. I could tell something else was going on. His health issues didn't help.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Physical health issues tend to induce mental health issues. If I'm right, he already had mental health issues, which was probably rather tough on him.\n\n**Mr. Ryan:** Yeah... I felt bad for him.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** What types of artwork did [Mx.] Everett do? Do you still have any of his club assignments?\n\n**Mr. Ryan:** Oh, I have a few. But obviously not with me. He did these really fun cartoony-style human drawings.

I've been really worried about its mental state.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Expand on that.\n\n**Mr. Wells:** He’s been withdrawing from social stuff. We’re in this Discord server together.

It was discovered that SCP-7262 was raised by its father Robert Everett with its mother Jane Everett absent. It was raised alongside its older brother Aaron Everett.\n\nSCP-7262’s father refused further interrogation claiming he wanted nothing to do with SCP-7262. Fortunately, it’s brother agreed to participate in questioning about SCP-7262. The resulting interview is documented below.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▼ Open Interview ▼\" hide=\"▲ Close Interview ▲\"]]\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Interview Log\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[<]]\n**INTERVIEWED:** Aaron Everett\n \n**INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Hart\n\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Hello, Mr. Everett. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.\n\n**Mr. Everett:** No problem. I- it's been a bit since I've talked to Jon. I can't believe he's missing. I have no idea where he could've gone. Besides, you know. //[hesitates]//\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Yes?\n\n**Mr. Everett:** The afterlife. It would make sense if he just... couldn't take it one day.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** I see. Mr. Everett, is there anything going on in your brother's life that you think would cause him to attempt serious harm to himself?\n\n**Mr. Everett:** I mean, he has BPD. Everything makes him think that way. But, in particular... //[hesitates]// He called dad asking for money. Jon //never// asks dad for help. Dad told him to meet in person, so he ubered over there despite being broke. He must have been super desperate. I don't really know how the conversation went. But it didn't end in any money lent. That's all I know.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** I see. What type of relationship does your brother have with your father?\n\n**Mr. Everett:** They don't have one. Not now, anyway. Dad kicked him out of the house for being non-binary the second he turned 18. Literally, he woke him up at two in the morning and said he had twenty minutes to gather his belongings.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** That's terrible. Where did he go?\n\n**Mr. Everett:** He stayed with a friend until I moved out just a few months after. Then, he stayed with me until I helped with the funds for him to go to college. I-I don't know that much about his identity and stuff, but he's always gonna be my brother- er, I don't know what term he prefers. Anyway, I'll always care for him. I do my best to help him out. But, his recent financial troubles have been getting at him. He... he doesn't ask for help. I had to beg him to take the ride to college. Whatever happened made him desperate enough to ask dad.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Are you still in regular contact with your father?\n\n**Mr. Everett:** No. Dad never officially cut me off or anything, but I kinda strayed from dealing with him as time went on. Because he's...\n\n//[Mr. Everett points to his head with his index finger pointing outwards, moving his wrist in a circular motion.]//\n\n**Mr. Everett:** I'm tempted to ask what happened. To ask my dad. But he'd probably give me some twisted version of the story. Jesus. I'd never forgive my dad if he's the reason I'll never see my brother again. I-I know he was on the ledge a lot... //[sighs]// this is all so nightmarish.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Thank you for your time. You'll be updated if we have any updates.\n\n**Mr. Everett:** Thanks. I'd do anything to just ensure that he's safe. I... I hope you guys find him. \n\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n----\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Addendum 3: Discord Logs**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following logs were taken from the Discord server previously logged discovered after SCP-7262's entrance to the foundation.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=five\n|username= ♕ ᗪᖇEᗩᗰ ᑭᖇIᑎᑕE ♕\n|msg-time=04/26/2022 4:43 pm\n]]\n[[span class=\"at_mention\"]]@📺Local TV Man📺 [[/span]] now that you're back home, do you have any updates on Gutz?\nOr, updates at all?\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username=📺Local TV Man📺\n|msg-time=04/26/2022 4:43 pm\n]]\nNo.\nWell\nnot technically.

Could you elaborate on what happened?\n\n**SCP-7262:** I don't want to talk about what happened.\n\n**Dr. Diamond:** Alright, you don't have to. Next, I wanted to ask about your friends.\n\n**SCP-7262:** My friends? You mean the ones you're letting think I'm dead?\n\n**Dr. Diamond:** That's still being discussed.
