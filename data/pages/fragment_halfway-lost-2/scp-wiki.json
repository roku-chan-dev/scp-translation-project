Undercover personnel are to infiltrate criminal operations and trace black market connections to the initial source providing KTE-3573-Ether-Florence.\n\n[[div class=\"log\"]]\n[[size 140%]]###2c4a78|**KTE-3573-Ether-Florentine**##[[/size]]\nAuthorized Response Level: ###2c4a78|**2**## **(Sub-Moderate Threat)**\n\n[[size 120%]]Description[[/size]]\n[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3573 KTE-3573-Ether-Florentine] is an anomalous substance similar to red wine. Threat entity possesses various alchemical and thaumaturgic properties, most notably in the //magnum opus//. Due to its paranormal applications, possession is strictly limited to authorized Coalition personnel, and any discovered instances are to be seized and contained immediately.\n\nKTE-3573 originates from an extradimensional municipality commonly known as [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264 Alagadda.]  However, due to a requirement for various alchemical components, including KTE-3573, in generating a Way to Alagadda, it is unknown how the substance initially entered distribution. The leading theory, proposed by Dr. Calixto Narváez, presumes an unknown and potentially hostile entity initially generated a Way from within Alagadda, through which the substance was transported.\n[[/div]]\n\nMission does not entail seizure of undocumented threat entity supplies and/or detainment of associated criminals. Following initial reconnaissance mission, appropriate responses are to be executed by specialized Strike Teams and regional Coalition enforcers. In order to prevent disclosure of operatives' Coalition affiliation, each region is to be assigned exactly one operative, and operatives are to attempt contact with Coalition command only regarding significant developments.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Nothing You Could Do' ;\"]]Whenever the Coalition rolls out a sting operation, they always start off with the three largest Free Ports — Three Portlands, Backdoor SoHo, and Eurtec. Of course, Portlands has the largest human population and SoHo has the most stable economy.

Originally founded by the Servants of Silicon Nornir, following their addition to the Council of 108 in 1984, administration of Eurtec was promptly transferred to the Coalition.\n\nEurtec is notable for its expansive criminal underground, which primarily reside in the lower city. Lower city residents are significantly more likely to possess paranormal properties and participate in blue market commerce[[footnote]]Commerce involving parascientific goods or service, usually thaumaturgy or alchemy.[[/footnote]], and many are known to be involved with anomalous substances and unregulated technologies. Coalition Enforcers are to engage known criminals on-sight but limit interaction with other paranormal individuals as outlined in the 1984 Coalition Administration Agreement.\n\nThe section of the city 600 meters above sea level or higher is officially designated the upper city. The upper city operates as the de facto capital of the Council of 108, and houses both the regional Coalition headquarters and the modern Council Assembly building.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Nothing You Could Do' ;\"]]Last one.
