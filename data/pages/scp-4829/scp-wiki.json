Containment personnel are to remain in Uranus' orbit and monitor SCP-4829's state.\n\nIn the event that SCP-4829's containment staff deem neutralization necessary, one instance of [[[SCP-2501|SCP-2501-EX]]] will be immediately delivered to them from orbital storage by MTF Mu-119 (\"Red Squadron\").\n\n**Description:** SCP-4829 is Uranus' moon Umbriel.\n\nSCP-4829 repeatedly generates large, flower-like structures made of ice or rock along its surface; each of these structures measures up to 40 km tall and moves rhythmically for several months before sinking back below the surface. Routine probes determined that beneath the ice lies a gelatinous layer of dissolved hydrocarbons, proteins and enzymes.\n\nOn 9/19/2072, Foundation astronauts Chad Roland, Vanessa Marquez, and Monica Lorenz descended from Umbriel's orbit in a lander to investigate SCP-4829’s surface.\n\n> [The following log is transcribed from Monica Lorenz's bodycam.]\n> \n> [**BEGIN LOG**]\n> (//The camera jolts as the lander touches down on Umbriel's surface.//)\n> \n> **Roland:** Mission Control, this is Skywalker. We've landed half a kilometer from one of the structures.\n> \n> **Mission Control:** Roger, //Skywalker//, we copy. Excellent job.\n> \n> **Roland:** Stepping out.\n> \n> (//Roland opens the airlock and climbs onto the ladder.//)\n> \n> **Marquez:** Performing thruster diagnostics, stand by.\n> \n> (//Roland descends the ladder and steps onto the surface, with Lorenz following on the ladder.//)\n> \n> **Roland:** Surface appears- what the fuck?!\n> \n> **Lorenz:** Are you alright?\n> \n> (//Roland sinks into the regolith up to his knees, and his space suit dissolves. His body balloons and stretches into an ellipsoid shape as his skin becomes translucent white.//)\n> \n> **Lorenz:** Oh shit! Vanessa, get us out of here!\n> \n> (//Lorenz climbs back into the lander and disconnects Roland's tether, throwing the remaining length out of the lander.//)\n> \n> (//Roland sinks further into the surface and bursts, spreading white liquid across several square meters of ice. The liquid is pulled into the surface and the ground shakes.//)\n> \n> (//Lorenz closes the lander door.//)\n> \n> **Marquez:** Fuck! 3, 2, 1, ignition!\n> \n> (//The camera feed shakes as the lander takes off.//)\n> [**END LOG**]\n> \n> **Postscript:** As Lorenz and Marquez returned to orbit, the surface of SCP-4829 cracked along the equator, causing vast amounts of lunar material to fall into the widening chasm. SCP-4829 continued to crack until it fully split into two identical, smaller instances of itself.\n\n##blue|**UPDATE 9/21/2072:**## SCP-4829 is currently thousands of small moons attached to each other in a spherical arrangement, dividing roughly every 13 hours. Orbital data shows SCP-4829's constituent objects to be composed of cytoplasm, surrounded by shells of ice and rock.\n\n##blue|**UPDATE 9/23/2072:**## Individual lunar structures now number beyond 20,000. SCP-4829 remains roughly the same size.\n\n##blue|**UPDATE 10/11/2072:**## SCP-4829’s orbit decays further; causing it to fall into the ε ring (Uranus' brightest ring). The ring material rearranges, sheathing SCP-4829 in a diffuse cloud while a stream of ice particles extends down to connect SCP-4829 with Uranus' atmosphere. Gas from the atmosphere flows up the ice stream, covering SCP-4829 further.\n\n##blue|**UPDATE 11/14/2072:**## SCP-4829 has deformed and is no longer spherical. Sensors indicate a rhythmic, repeating vibration generated by SCP-4829’s core at a rate of 110-120 beats per minute.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4828]]] | SCP-4829 | [[[SCP-4830]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
