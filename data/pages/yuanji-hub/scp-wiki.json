Its main fields of business are medical services, higher education, biomedical development and public transports. The corporation has large medical institutions in multiple counties and cities in Taiwan, and has also estabilished an institution for higher education (**YuanJi University**) and a couple of museums. It has huge influences in Taiwan's social network and there have been plans to expand its business to Hong Kong and Shanghai, China.\n\nAt first, the Foundation did not list YuanJi Inc. as a Group of Interest. But, from 2019, there have been instances of  [[[scp-zh-610|utilising anomalous biotechnology resembling Sarkic mechanisms]]] appearing in its database and clinical practices; anomalies produced (both actively or passively) have been found in its campus in its [[[scp-zh-593|campus]]], [[[scp-zh-950|instructional materials]]] and [[[scp-zh-628|research subjects]]], and thus they quickly drew the attention.\n\nCurrent intelligence shows there are several characteristics to YuanJi Inc.'s activities:\n\n# **Mainly active in non-anomalous business:** Apart from the [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/遠己#pages anomalous activities interfered] by the Foundation, the majority of YuanJi Inc.'s business are still within normalcy.\n# **Lack of understanding of the anomalous:** Current investigations have shown approximately 98.5% of YuanJi Inc.'s members have a similar understanding to other civilians', and the knowledge of anomalous communities is limited to corporate executives, whom have shown unilateral and shallow understanding of said communities.\n# **Sarkic activities within the higher-ups:** The executives of YuanJi Inc. have shown high interests in anomalous biotechnology, and [[[scp-4036|have formed a connection with certain Sarkic societies.]]] However, YuanJi Inc. did not see Sarkic mechanisms as \"out of the ordinary\" but a \"new resource available for in-depth development\".\n\nIn the risk assessment conference held in 2020, YuanJi Inc. has been assessed to be a low-risk threat to the Foundation, and a medium-to-high risk of veil-breaking. The Foundation is presently conducting an overall investigation within the corporation to prevent any potential anomalous hazards, or the emergence and activation of veil-disrupting factors.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Location of Medical Operation]]\n[[include component:image-block\n  name=gSCdwZL.png|\n  caption=YuanJi Hospital's location of operation in 2021, excerpted from the group’s official website.|\n]]\n\nAs of 2021, YuanJi Inc. has opened multiple large medical infrastructures in Taiwan, including:\n\n**Xinzhuang Main Hospital:** A well-known large medical centre in North Taiwan, has the highest number of inpatients and outpatients in the industry. Includes a shuttle to Shulin Campus. The Main Hospital is also the affiliated hospital of YuanJi University School of Medicine, which provides clinical practice courses to its student.\n\n**Taipei Songshan Branch**\n\n**Taoyuan Nankan Branch**\n\n**Hsinchu Zhubei Branch**\n\n**--Miaoli Gongguan Branch--:** Abandoned in 2009. There may be anomalous activities within the area, which is to be clarified by regional agents.\n\n**Changhua Lugang Branch**\n\n**Nantou Jiji Branch:** Established in 2004 in response to the September 21 Earthquake to provide nearby medical services in Nantou.\n\n**Chiayi Branch**\n\n**Tainan Jiali Branch:** Includes a shuttle route to Shanhua Campus of Yuanji University, which takes about 20 minutes.\n\n**Kaohsiung Gangshan Branch**\n\n**Hualien Ji'an Branch:** Includes a traveling medical shuttle bus. Responsible for medical services in Hualien County.\n\n**Taitung Branch:** Includes a traveling medical shuttle bus and complimentary helicopters to Green Island Township and Orchid Island.\n\n----\n\nAside from the aforementioned hospitals, YuanJi Inc. has also established smaller-scale **YuanJi Clinics** which provide a medical network to satellite towns and rural areas. The numbers of clinics are multitudinous, and are regularly inspected by regional Foundation agents. These clinics will not be listed in this file.\n\nFurthermore, YuanJi Inc. is constructing high-end international medical facilities in Kowloon, Hong Kong and Shanghai Pudong, China. These constructions are yet to be completed, and most of their information are still classified.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Location of Academic Operation]]\n[[include component:image-block\n  name=avoC8Hy.png|\n  caption=YuanJi Education's location of operation, excerpted from the group’s official website.|\n]]\n\n**YuanJi University (YJU)** currently (May 2021) has 4,772 undergraduates, 956 faculty members, and 275 graduate students. It has seven colleges and four research institutes. There are few anomalous activities within the academia and therefore require fewer attention. However, in YJU postgraduate school, there have been instances of parascience and anomalous yields of research application or usage of risky assets that the Foundation pays close attention to.

In this world, YuanJi and Chang Gung coexist and are in a feisty competition, so you can assume YuanJi has resources that the \"Real Chang Gung\" has (e.g.: public transportation and universities), or resources that \"Real Chang Gung does not have\" (e.g.: research centers in the mountains, a hospital in Huadong).\n\nAs writing the inner workings of a corperation in detail is not a simple feat, the following are some easy ways to write and utilise __settings of YuanJi__: \n\n= **YuanJi University**\n> School life is something everyone should have experienced, and strange stories within the academia is a good resonating topic.
