Site-449 will take jurisdiction over containment of SCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A. The SCP-5050 signals are to be monitored at all times; any errant changes should be reported to the lead researcher immediately.\n\nSCP-5050-A is to be monitored indirectly. Civilians are to be instructed to stay away from the location of SCP-5050 and SCP-5050-A and the road leading to them will be barricaded. Intruders are to be amnesticized. No overtly anachronistic technology is to be introduced to SCP-5050-A; incoming television and radio signals are to be monitored to this effect.\n\nThe Foundation database is to be checked bi-weekly for any unauthorized SCP-5050 behavior.\n\n----\n\n[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=signal-noise.jpg |\n    width=200px |\n    caption=Radio propagation signals from SCP-5050.\n]]\nSCP-5050 is a large radio tower in the Bavarian Alps on the Austrian/German border, specifically the Mittenwald municipality in Germany and the Innsbruck-Land district of Austria. SCP-5050 constantly emits signals ranging from 2 kHz/kilohertz to 279 GHz/gigahertz[[footnote]]The equivalent of a range between the Very Low Frequency (VHF) and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) ranges as designated by the ITU.[[/footnote]] over a large area, although the maximum effective range is estimated to be within a 1,374 meter radius of SCP-5050. The frequency range produced by SCP-5050 is so extreme as to be considered anomalous by the disruption of applied physics.\n\nSCP-5050 also broadcasts television and audio signals as well as radio signals. These broadcasts can be occasionally intercepted by the Foundation; because the process requires a significant amount of time, the broadcasts usually do not last long enough to be fully intercepted. These media appear to be somewhat procedurally-generated.\n\nThe signal from SCP-5050 primarily affects the surrounding town of Drachen-Domane (designated SCP-5050-A). SCP-5050-A appears to be consisted of a mix of technology from the 1960s to the 1980s; the level of technological advancement in SCP-5050-A seems to be slowed. Its inhabitants appear to be affected easily by the signals, but no direct testing has been available to support this conclusion. Neither SCP-5050 nor SCP-5050-A have any historical construction records.\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=lpb-spectro.png |\n    width=1800px |\n    align=center |\n    caption=Spectrogram of a 21kHz frequency from SCP-5050.

Further surveillance of SCP-5050-A was approved and aerial reconnaissance was carried out. During the reconnaissance, the signals from SCP-5050 interfered with the control system of a Foundation plane and severely damaged it in the process. Due to the inability to get in close proximity to SCP-5050, a ground task force has been assigned to initiate first contact with SCP-5050-A (See Addendum 01.1 - Contact Proposal).\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=dd-plane-down.jpg |\n    width=300px |\n    align=center |\n    caption=Foundation plane destroyed during aerial surveillance.

The first thing we saw wasn't exactly what we - or I - expected. On the side of the road, there's a sign that every self-respecting small town has, you know, \"Welcome to Plainsville\" or that sort of stuff. This one just said 'Drachen-Domane' but that's not the important part. Underneath that was this sort of Foundation logo. Stunned us there. It makes no sense cause we're the contact team; there shouldn't be any trace of us here at all. I had Audrey make a mockup of the sign using some of the stuff we have.\n\n[[=image town-sign.png width=\"400px\"]]\n\nInteresting start of the day. Got into the main area of Drachen; it's quaint overall. Reminds me of the days as a young girl roaming around the outskirts of town. Almost antique, if someone plucked it right out of the 70s. Roamed around for a while; people around are cautious but friendly. Understandable. Asked about the history of the town and the tower. Foundation too. Most people couldn't give us an awfully straight answer. Figures they wouldn't know much.\n\nStrangest part is the welcome sign. We asked around, but no one's actually ever seen the sign. You'd think at least one person in town would know. Does that mean no one ever leaves? Possible. We're staying at the Righiera Hotel in Drachen. Two rooms, connected by an adjacent door. Thankfully (or unusually) everyone here speaks English, not German. Turns out \"Drachen-Domane\" means \"Dragon's Domain\" in English. About right.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000b38; background:#d1f4ff; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em;\"]]\n[[size 105%]]**May 03, 2019:**[[/size]] Saw the logo again. Middle of the tunnel, embossed straight into the wall. Made out of some sort of red acrylic or tile. No spaces in between the logo and the surrounding concrete. Didn't make it too far examining it before a young boy, dressed in what looked like a WW1 doughboy outfit, told us that the insignia is the town crest. Town crest. Makes sense given its prevalence but still: it's just our logo with a tower in it. I guess \"just\" is an understatement considering the preservation of the veil and all. It's also a crime to tamper with the 'town crest' according to that darned kid. Said he'd notify the Brigade. Law enforcement of the town, they run more like Military Police than any standard district. Derek paid him off with some sweets. Shouldn't have to look over our shoulders for a little while.\n\nDomane today. Same aesthetic as Drachen. We received some nice pictures today from some of the townfolk. They heard we were in town (it's a tiny place, I bet you could hear a pin drop at the other edge of the town) and dug into their library's archives. Visited the place ourselves, but all the books are very old and musty. Nothing new that I could spot. Found a town map, though. Had Audrey do some of her special work again for us. Took a nice pic, too.\n\n[[=image polaroid.jpg width=\"500px\"]]\n \nCalled it quits earlier than usual today. Mild headaches, nothing too severe, but annoying enough to hinder good work. Everyone in the team's got them, I think. As for me, I have this ringing in my ears - in the back, like if someone had a triangle clanging around in there. Lazenby's current diagnosis is tinnitus. Don't believe it for a bit.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000b38; background:#d1f4ff; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em;\"]]\n[[size 105%]]**May 04, 2019:**[[/size]] God, my head is killing me. Feels like that one time I downed about a dozen tequila shots at that Foundation Christmas party last year. I can tell everyone's feeling it, too. Lazenby's trying his best but it's sort of clear he can't think really straight either. His left eye's been killing him. Day three and we're already out-of-action. Some top Foundation team we are.\n\nWatched TV. Not much on besides reruns of the original Twilight Zone. Watched \"A Thing About Machines\" and \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit.\" Great stuff, probably one of the best shows out there. Caught a broadcast directed to us. Not sure what to make of it.\n\nWe all eventually figured a bit later that we can't just sit around all day doing nothing, especially after that broadcast. Headed to the clinic doctor, Hubbard, to see if he knows anything that Lazenby doesn't. He chalked it up to 'pressure difference' in altitudes messing with us and that it was nothing to worry about. The probability of that being true is about the same as shooting the edge of a coin at 500 meters away. Even Lazenby argued with Hubbard for a while on the diagnosis. Guess it wasn't worth it to him to fight because he stopped after a while. Paid our dues and went back to the streets.\n\nWent wandering about Drachen-Domane. I don't know //why// we just went walking, but it was just a feeling that I had. It was almost like a trance. Snapped out of it when Lazenby shouted and ran off somewhere. Caught up to him, and he had one of the Brigade members by the collar. Relatively young man with chestnut hair. The soldier, a Captain Marek, explained that he was following us for our safety. Okay, sure. Told him to leave us alone, but Lazenby nearly tore his throat out. Hippocratic oath my ass. Pulled him off. Went back to the hotel after. Wrote most of what we learnt on a hotel notepad.\n\nLots of things to unpack.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#fffdf0; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em;\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[size 200%]] **IMAGE LOG** [[/size]]\n------\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=map-final-a.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Rough map of Drachen-Domane by Sampi-3.\n<Hover to Enlarge>\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=dd-military-police.jpg |\n    width=500px |\n    align=center |\n    caption=The Brigade.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=tower-talk.png |\n    width=500px |\n    align=center |\n    caption=A townsperson gives a speech unequivocally praising SCP-5050 to fellow townspeople.\n]]\n[[/div]]\n \n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#fffdf0; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 0.8em;\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[size 200%]] **VISUAL LOG** [[/size]]\n------\n@@ @@\n+++ SCP-5050 Broadcast: MAY 03. 2019\n[[/=]]\n[[html]]\n<video style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%;\" controls>\n<source src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-5050-0/tower-2.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:dashed 2px #1c1c1c; background: #c9c9c9; padding:20px; margin: auto; text-align: left; font-family: \"Courier Prime\", monospace; align: center; font-size: 1em;\"]]\n**[0:00]** - **[0:02]** > Standard 120hz test tone.\n**[0:02]** - **[0:08]** > SCP-5050 generated jingle, aka 'opening'.\n**[0:08]** - **[0:24]** > //\"It is my decree that our new visitors should be treated with respect and kindness and not mauled, maimed, disfigured, or killed in any way possible.

Some of the things we asked about:\n* Town Crest – Nothing new regarding this. No one seems to know its origin.\n* Von Gernreich – Literally nobody’s seen this person or heard their name in their life. Go figure.\n* Righiera – “Shut down” following an incident several months ago. Owner disappeared suddenly after. The incident’s most likely the Sampi-3 team’s ambush.\n* The Viceroy – All the responses we got were enigmatic to say the least. Everyone had speculations on what he looked like. Seems like the only people who’ve seen him are the Tower Speakers. Lives in Capis Cai – the executive manor in Domane. That’s all we could factually get.\n\nOverall, not entirely a useful week.

Given you knew about the Viceroy, it fits.\n\n**Kontakteen**: Correct, Mr. Roland.\n\n**Neame**: You- aren't you-\n\n**Kontakteen**: Erich Lazenby, Ms. Neame?\n\n**Neame**: You are! You're not dead! Why haven't you contacted the Foundation?\n\n**Roland**: It seems like a better move to have contacted the Site instead of us, given your technology.\n\n**Kontakteen**: Let me explain. I may have been Erich Lazenby at one point; but I am no longer that person. This is not quite what is happening, but I am living in the shell of Erich Lazenby. I am Kontakteen.\n\n**Roland**: Interesting, the phonetic mispronunciation.\n\n**Neame**: Of what?\n\n**Roland**: Contact team. Kontakteen. Can't you hear it?\n\n**Neame**: You're right, holy shit.\n\n**Kontakteen**: I promised information - what do you wish for?\n\n**Neame**: When was Drachen-Domane founded?\n\n**Kontakteen**: April 26th, 1964. It's a very important date in this town, beyond what you probably understand.\n\n**Roland**: How did you become one of the Tower Speakers? What is your purpose?\n\n**Kontakteen**: How I became, I don't know. I just... was, one day. My purpose: I simply spread the message of the Tower.\n\n**Roland**: Fitting, I guess.\n\n**Kontakteen**: This painting behind me. It is a beautiful painting, is it not?\n\n**Neame**: That's Goya, right?\n\n**Roland**: Saturn Devouring His Children.\n\n**Kontakteen**: Indeed. One of Francisco Goya's black paintings, painted directly on the walls of his house between 1819 and 1823. It's almost like you could walk directly through it into another world.\n\n**Roland**: You're knowledgeable about that.\n\n**Kontakteen**: One of my passions, Mr. Roland. There are a lot more Goyas in the wine cellar.\n\n**Neame**: What does Project ROOK have to do with Capis Cai and this town?\n\n**Kontakteen**: That one you will understand soon enough. I cannot answer that question.\n\n**Roland**: What about the Foundation?\n\n**Kontakteen**: The Foundation... founds. Is it not amazingly simple?\n\n**Roland**: So they founded this town?\n\n**Kontakteen**: It is up to you to decide how you want to interpret my statements, Mr. Roland.\n\n**Roland**: I see.\n\n**Neame**: Why so enigmatic now, Kontakteen? You were mostly straight forward with us then, why not now?\n\n**Kontakteen**: The layers are only there to protect you, Mrs. Neame. Did Julius Ceasar listen to the Soothsayer? Maybe he couldn't understand dates!\n\n//<Kontakteen laughs.>//\n\n**Neame**: Oh. Okay.\n\n**Roland**: What is the Tower?\n\n**Kontakteen**: The Tower? It is three looking for one, drunk on knowledge and wishing to take from the waters of Eden.\n\n**Roland**: Got it, thank you.\n\n**Neame**: What happens if you don't listen to the Tower?\n\n**Kontakteen**: Questioning the voice of the Tower is a missed step that it will forcefully rectify.\n\n**Neame**: Wait! That means... Kontakteen, did Von Gernre-\n\n**Kontakteen**: Halt, stop!\n\n**Neame**: W- what is it?\n\n**Kontakteen**: I thank you for visiting Capis Cai and heeding the warnings of the Tower.\n\n**Neame**: Huh?\n\n**Kontakteen**: If you would like me to answer the rest of your questions, I will be available tonight.

Tiny crevice in the wall, but there was a door - a metal door. Locked by keycode, five numbers. That was the harder part. Tried 26564 and a bunch of combinations of April 26th 1964. Roland remembered his weird dig about Julius Caesar, then it clicked. Julian day. Using that, we got 35812. Worked like a charm.\n\nIt leads to this long, deep tunnel.
