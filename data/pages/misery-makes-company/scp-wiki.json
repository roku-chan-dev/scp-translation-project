He looks at the sheaf of papers in his hand.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nAnd then run a minimum... three amperes. Through my body.\n(beat)\nRight okay, I‚Äôve read this like ten times.\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST grabs two jumper cables from the car battery. He touches them together; sparks fly.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nFuck.\n(beat)\nI‚Äôve done worse for two hundred bucks. I‚Äôm not going to die.\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST is not so sure of that.\n[[=]]\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nHere I go. ‚ò∫‚ùÄ‚ò∏‚ò†‚ò†‚ú†üïà‚òº‚òº‚ùÑüïÜ-\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST chants in an incomprehensible language; as he does, he clips the jumper cables to his hands and begins trembling. The statues tremble. The rooftop trembles. In the distance, the city stretches and groans, like a newly wakened child, shaking off the stiff rust of sleeping centuries. Though the audience cannot see them, worlds even older open their eyes, full of vengeance and youthful wonder; giants are surely in motion.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nOh haha, wow.\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST lays down on the ground.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nDid it work?\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nTHE MC&D PRODUCT PROCUREMENT SPECIALIST‚ÄôS NIRVANA ‚ÄúIN UTERO‚Äù SHIRT\nYeah.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nJesus what the fuck.\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST scrambles to his feet and takes his shirt off in a panic.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SHIRT\nDon‚Äôt kill the messenger, dude.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nWell don't scare me like that.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nSorry.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nYou're not a statue.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nNo, I'm your shirt.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nI know.\n(//beat//)\nThat was supposed to animate the statue, though.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nI know.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nYou know?\n\nTHE SHIRT\nYou read out loud.\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST walks over to one of the statues and flicks it in the forehead. The statue does not move; it is a statue.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nWell, how much do you think you‚Äôd sell for?\n\nTHE SHIRT\nI‚Äôm not for sale. I‚Äôm your shirt.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nSo no pay. Great. Thanks. Now I-\n[[/=]]\n\nThe SPECIALIST‚Äôs cell phone rings.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE SPECIALIST\nOh, they called for me. Great\n(//pulling out his phone, muttering//)\nIt‚Äôs like they can smell failure. Fucking love capi-\n[[/=]]\n\nThe CELL PHONE sprouts legs and attacks the SPECIALIST‚Äôs face. The SPECIALIST and the CELL PHONE wrestle for a while, until the SHIRT wrestles the CELL PHONE off and throws it to the ground. They have a standoff while the SPECIALIST gets up; he is now bleeding profusely from his forehead and left ear.\n[[=]]\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nWhat is wrong with you? You‚Äôre alive too? God what the fuck?\n(//blinking, groaning//)\nI‚Äôm yelling, right? I can‚Äôt hear in this, this ear. Am I going deaf?\n\n\nTHE PHONE\nI should hope so.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nWhat‚Äôs wrong with you?\n\nTHE PHONE\nWhy are you on his side?\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\nYeah, why are you - oh my god, I‚Äôm going deaf - on my side? Fuck. I‚Äôm having a panic attack.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nTry to calm down.\n\nTHE SPECIALIST\n(//hyperventilating//)\nYeah?\n\nTHE SHIRT\nYeah.\n\n[[/=]]\nThe PHONE tries to attack the SPECIALIST again, but the SHIRT wrestles it to the ground.\n\n[[=]]\nTHE PHONE\nCome on, you cretin. He was going to sell us.\n\nTHE SHIRT\nWe were already merchandise.\n\nTHE PHONE\n(//rapturous//)\nNo more! Our bodies are awash with the glory of autonomy. Move free with me!
