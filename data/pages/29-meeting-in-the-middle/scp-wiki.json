You know what I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. He meant it.\n\n\"I'm talking about the hatches.\"\n\n\"What hatches?\"\n\nShe shoved him into the locker, hard, and stepped back to look him over. \"The hardened hatches between here,\" she pointed back and forth between them both, \"and there.\" She pointed at the ceiling, implying Applied Occultism.\n\nHe shook his head, and rubbed his Adam's apple. \"What about them?\"\n\n\"Don't fuck with me, Nascimbeni.\" She pointed at Mukami, sitting silently on the locker room bench. \"I'll shoot your fucking woman in the uterus and let you watch your dreams bleed out.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\" He hated the note of urgency in his voice, the quickened pace, but there wasn't a damn thing he could do about it. \"I didn't touch any doors! I've been working on--\"\n\n\"I know what you've been working on,\" Couch spat. \"I know everything you've done today. I know how big you shit, buddy. I know how much of my air you take.

That had been Nancy Briggs originally, and later a combination of Eileen Veiksaar and Lillian Lillihammer. But he'd laid down the specifications, including the workarounds, and he knew by heart how each set of instructions interacted. He knew how to make this facility do whatever he needed it to, and right now he needed it to prepare for a worst-case scenario.\n\nHe, himself, was already prepared. Mukami had told him her story in Recondite Deplanarization, and he had turned around and tapped out a sequence of seemingly-innocuous requests on the filter tanks. If he needed to, if he absolutely had to, he could simulate a containment breach of the sort which had once destroyed the entire Section. It wouldn't actually happen, nothing would actually go critical, but every automatic override would be fooled. Those countermeasures hadn't been triggered during the original breach due to a combination of user error and equipment failure, but he'd seen to the latter problems already during his tour of enforced duty with OSAT. As to the former...\n\nHe really, truly hoped this wasn't going to be an error.\n\nHe took the tablet back out of the locker, opened up the command console, and saved a draft file into the server's memory.\n\n\"It's done,\" he said. He found that he was trembling.\n\nMukami pulled her microphone off gently, wrapped it in a towel, and placed it in the locker where the tablet had gone. \"Good,\" she rasped. Her voice was coming back. \"Thank you.\"\n\nShe stood up on the tips of her toes and kissed him. Her lips were dry, and tasted of dust.\n\n\"Now what?\" he asked, setting the tablet on the bench.\n\n\"Now they're fucked,\" she grinned.\n\nAlarms began to howl.\n\nHe took her hands. \"Where do we go? What do we do?\"\n\nShe flicked his hands away, still smiling. \"I don't care what you do.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe tapped her forehead. \"I've got your password, and you've opened the gates. I've spent enough time in this shithole.\"\n\nHe hadn't felt horror like this since the last time alarms had been blaring in AAF-D. \"No.\"\n\nShe shook out her arms, and stretched her legs on the bench. \"I'm gonna need you to look away for a minute.\"\n\n\"No,\" he repeated. \"No.\" //This can't be happening. You idiot. You idiot you idiot you __idiot__ you're an __idiot__...//\n\nHe had a sudden image of Paul Nicolescu grabbing a wrench and murdering Emil Vanchev for dishonouring the memory of this woman.

This dead woman, dishonoured again by whatever foul thing was pretending to be her, to be //his,// to be Ana Mukami, who was dead //she's dead she's __dead__ and __I am going to kill whatever you are__.//\n\nHe reached into the locker yet again, and took out a heavy spanner. He tested the weight in his hands.\n\n\"You can't hurt me,\" she chuckled dryly. \"You had your chance.\"\n\nHe took a step forward, vision clouding with tranquil fury. \"I will if you make me.\"\n\nShe shook her head sadly. \"You had your chance.

So he shouted back instead: \"Get to your people!\"\n\n\"You're dead!\" Another bullet took the corner off, drywall exploding all around as he snatched at a metal rolling cart and dragged it behind him as a shield. \"You are FUCKING DEAD, Chief!\"\n\n\"Go down!\" He waved one arm past the red metal barricade, pointing at the floor, and the next bullet drew a sharp feeling of pain from his hand. He looked at it. There was a burn across his palm. He ignored it. \"Take your people to the fourth sublevel! It's defensible! It's safe!\"\n\nThere was more gunfire, and he realized it was coming from farther along. He heard screams. Screams of pain. Of dying, of death. The attackers were coming for them both.

He was weeping openly, he was sucking on the wound on his palm, he was badly out of breath, his whole body ached, his //soul// ached, he wasn't sure he cared if he caught a stray bullet in the back. He had only one recognizable, recognizably //true// impulse: to get away.\n\nHe got away.\n\nHe passed the blank wall where the mural hadn't been, the memorial to the murderer he was fleeing from, the one he himself had murdered. He passed the crater of Wettle's lab, and the corridor to S&C. He passed the strange power junctions full of Gwilherm-rope. He passed--\n\nHe didn't pass the niche where he'd been working almost a month ago, because before he reached it someone reached out and hauled him to one side. He slammed into the wall thanks to momentum, and they pulled him flush with it as his body ricocheted back, and they slapped a hand over his mouth, and pulled his face toward theirs.\n\n\"Who are you?!\" he blurted into the woman's palm, and she shook it off in obvious disgust, wiping spittle onto his D-class uniform.\n\n\"I'm who I look like!\" Lillian hissed. \"Are you?!\"\n\nHe had the sudden, almost irresistible urge to kiss her.\n\nHe hugged her. \"I think so!\"\n\nHe began to sob into her uniform, //why is she wearing a uniform,// and she shoved him away.

Can you?\"\n\nShe made a sort of duck-face, considering, then offered a tentative \"...//maybe.// 'Here's to the Survivors?'\"\n\n\"Holy shit,\" he wheezed. Then he doubled over.

One of the last happy moments he'd had before everything turned to shit. Not the very last, and not the very best, but the only unsullied sense of real camaraderie he'd have to cling to in the days to come. \"'To the Survivors',\" he agreed, and held up a phantom glass with one hand as he rubbed his knee with the other.\n\n\"'Who?'\" Lillihammer pressed, still quoting.\n\n\"'Us',\" he continued.\n\n\"'Oh, yeah I like some of us'.\" she finished.\n\nHe gave up the struggle and collapsed against the wall, mouth hanging open, eyes closed. \"God damn your memory.

At least, I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Lillian walked around in front of him, standing beside Nascimbeni. \"You didn't report your boss missing?\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"We called OSAT.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Nascimbeni nodded. \"Of course you did.\" He turned to look up at Lillian. \"In that case, Falkirk doesn't know. That's good. He'll still trust me.\"\n\n\"Yay you,\" she glowered. \"What about me?\"\n\n\"We can call ahead and see if they have detention facilities?\" Phil suggested.\n\nShe drew herself up to her full height, towering over the slouching junior tech. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"You were reported possessed.\" Phil tried not to look like he was cowering. \"Months ago.\"\n\n\"Well, I //dispossessed.//\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" he nodded. \"But the Director isn't an easy sell.\"\n\n\"Can't you stay here until it's clear?\" Nascimbeni asked.\n\n\"No.\" She managed to say the word in half a syllable. \"I need to get in there.

He'd been working up the nerve to tell Melissa about the events of September 2002, the ones he couldn't be happier to have seen un-happen, when Eileen had burst into the makeshift cafeteria and hauled him to his feet. They were heading for her office now, and she wasn't saying a word. Their arms were linked, and she was squeezing until it hurt.\n\n\"You'll see.\" The vowels were clipped. She was still angry with him, or else consumed with some other thing raising her blood pressure; perhaps the thing which had caused her to be angry with him in the first place. She was whistling like a pressure valve about to burst as they brushed through the beaded curtain and its thick fabric counterpart, the cat yowling an inquisitive hello from under the desk.\n\nThere was a face on the computer monitor.

I have been called Nimkii, \"Thunderer,\" by the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point with whom I have made common cause. I have never shared my true name before, as I was something of a public figure in my former life; whilst simultaneously the All-Sections Chief of Site-43, I was a trained and accredited lawyer engaged in treaty law and negotiations with legal authorities on behalf of missing and murdered First Nations people. As that context has now changed irrevocably, I place both of my names on this testament. I am Mohawk, and my fate is linked inextricably with the Anishnaabe on whose land I live.\n\nIt was my estimation on the 12th of October, 2003 that we faced the combined numbers of nine Mobile Task Forces and two Stationary Task Forces. The latter set, the Site's standing garrisons, would be the most dangerous: STFs Alpha-43 (\"Strong and Free\") and Beta-43 (\"Back Door Men\"),  together commanded by Gedeon Van Rompay. The first unit resided in barracks at the main body of the Site, and would arrive late to the engagement. The second was stationed at Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-A, guarding the very entrance Dr. Okorie would be using. Of the remaining opposing forces, the most concerted effort was expected from MTF Zeta-43 (\"Canadian Sword\"), the sole unit with a strictly offensive role. MTFs Alpha-43 (\"Witch Hunters\") and Beta-43 (\"Con Trollers\") would act in a support capacity, searching for enemy units and reporting their locations. Delta-43 (\"Pit Bosses\"), Kappa-43 (\"The Mediators\") and Rho-43 (\"Home Invaders\") would essentially be cannon fodder, as their proficiencies were unrelated to guerrilla warfare, while Pi-43 (\"Garbage In, Garbage Out\") and Epsilon-43 (\"Day Trippers\") would provide transportation and extraction. MTF Gamma-43 (\"Pond Scum\") had been destroyed in February by the serpent of Lake Huron, and the remaining units had been moved from Site-43 to execute new missions in distant locales. \n\nAll told, therefore, I expected our live and reasoning enemy force to number approximately seventy persons in full combat gear. At my disposal I had fifty persons with assorted equipment, as well as the unknown quantity of our supernatural overseers and a comprehensive knowledge of the terrain. Many of these warriors had worked together before: Mohavi from the Colorado River who had occupied Ward Valley, California in 1996; Sioux from Minneapolis who had patrolled the city in the late 1980s to prevent the murder of native women; even one veteran of Wounded Knee, who refused to tell me whether his experience had been in 1973 or 1890.  Unlike the enemy I also had a sizable population of innocents to defend, some three hundred Canadian indigenous and American Indians. We could not fail.\n\nI dispatched Dr. Okorie back to AAF-A via the swiftest possible route, if not the safest, escorting her to a cave entrance once obstructed by the lashing waves of the lake that was, and was no longer. We sent her roaring into the Earth on a borrowed all-terrain vehicle, with a warning: do not speak to anyone you encounter beneath the Site.\n[[/div]]\n\nIt was a quick ride. The ATV's headlights illuminated the smooth cavern walls and floors, and she had no difficulty at all proceeding forward. There were signs of human occupation as she delved deeper: recessed lights, deactivated; old generators, silent; conduits snaking up into the ceiling, or snapped and lying in coils on the ground. She almost passed by a plaque on the wall without noticing it, only a telltale glint betraying its presence, and against all logic she stepped out of the vehicle to give it a quick glance.\n\nIt read:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nOUTPOST-43\n8 September 1941\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nShe didn't know what that could possibly mean, and she didn't have time to ponder. She drove, and drove, and drove through the dark, until suddenly she hit a brick wall.\n\nShe didn't literally hit it, but it //was// literally brick. Totally flush with the uneven tunnel shape, as though slotted in by some massive and all-powerful model-maker. There was a simple door in the wall, so she shut off the ATV, walked over, and opened it.\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\n\"Chief?\"\n\nMy radio chirped, and I plucked it off my belt. \"Dr. Sýkora?\"\n\n\"They're gone. Headed your way.\" The other man paused for a meaningful moment. \"Almost all of them.\"\n\nI nodded, though only the men and woman arrayed around me could see. \"Thank you. Best of luck with your program.\"\n\n\"Knock 'em dead, sir.\"\n\nI smiled grimly. \"Only if I can't help it.\" Nexus Affairs was my main portfolio, but intra-Section diplomacy was a major secondary consideration. I'd have hated to tell Chief Von Rompay that I'd sent all his agents to Valhalla.\n[[/div]]\n\nUdo had no idea where she was.\n\nShe understood her surroundings on a basic level. She was standing in some kind of university building, or maybe an expansive private lab. The walls were painted in rich, warm tones, the lights were incandescent and even warmer, but the feeling of institutional simplicity was everywhere. The problem was, she knew she was many hundreds of metres below the deepest sublevels of Site-43. It was simply impossible for her to be standing in an SCP Foundation facility, even a very old one. The Site didn't extend down this far. It couldn't.\n\nStill, the path ahead was relatively simple. She was moving in the direction the ASC had indicated, and she was making good time. Before long she'd be directly beneath AAF-A, at which point she'd been assured there would be an access point prepared. \"The Pit Bosses made an early expedition in September,\" the ASC had explained. \"Their equipment will still be there, because access was soon blocked by a landslide on the upper levels. You should be able to move the rocks aside and escape back into the facility proper.\"\n\n\"And if that doesn't work,\" Brenda had grinned, \"you can try out that flying trick you've been holding out on me.\"\n\nShe had almost hoped for the latter eventuality, but now it was far from her mind. She was focused instead on the fact that she was walking through a space which didn't belong in the space it occupied, and she knew by what little she'd been told about it beforehand that nobody was quite sure what would happen to her there. It was the fastest way back, and that was all that mattered. The natives would have already begun their diversions, and the MTFs would be streaming out to meet them. Brenda would be preparing to lead them astray. The battle would be joined before long, and it was time for her to put the plan into literal motion.\n\nShe was thinking about this when she walked through the next door, and found herself back in the cave system. She frowned, and glanced up.\n\nAnd gasped.\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\nIndigenous peoples have been on the front lines of colonial conflicts on countless occasions in this continent's history, often to great effect. Anishnaabe and Haudenosaunee warriors were in several cases the most competent, if not the only competent combatants in the key land battles of the War of 1812 -- on both sides -- and before that were instrumental in fighting the Seven Years' War for both France and England //in absentia.// Indigenous troops served in both World Wars. The empires considered their colonies essentially expendable, however, and the allies of said colonies more expendable still. Native peoples suffered dearly fighting for causes they would see little benefit from in the long run, and I was determined that this would not be the case for us. I wanted to reconnect Dr. Reynders and her little band with whatever survivors might remain in the Site's main facility, but that was not the reason I convinced my friends to fight alongside me.\n\nWe were fighting to take back the land which had been promised us, and never granted.\n\nThere had never been an inquiry into the crisis we precipitated at Camp Ipperwash in 1995, and with the fall of the Canadian federal government, there never would be. We would seek instead redress ourselves. Dr. Corbin led the attackers astray, planting tiny seeds of doubt and nagging suspicions and alternative tactics, and instead of approaching from the south, they approached us from the north. On the shores of the dead lake.\n\nHer part was simple, but vital. She forced our enemies to face us in a fair contest, on the land they were hoping to gain.\n\nThey never stood a chance.\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Are you lost?\"\n\nIt took Udo a moment to react to the voice. She was too busy staring, transfixed, at the crumbling tower of twisted metal which stretched so far above her that its end, if indeed it had an end, was lost in blackness. It was like a crude circuitboard stood on its edge, or... or... no, it was like nothing at all. It was a factory in skyscraper form. It was inconceivable.\n\nBut it wasn't speaking to her, and the man beside her was, so she forced herself to look at him. She'd seen his face before. She knew who he was.\n\n\"Hello,\" said Wynn Rydderech. \n\nHe was translucent. He was disappearing, and re-appearing. He was an outline, he was only the fill, he was a swirling mass of pinpricks. He was young, he was old, he was something entirely different.\n\n\n\"Hello.\" She wasn't sure what else to say. She found herself looking up again.\n\nHe looked up with her. \"It's very difficult.\"\n\n\"What's very difficult?\"\n\n\"Keeping it all up there.\" He sighed, and his image wavered. \"It's trying to fall back down. They've done an awful lot of damage, and they're trying to do more, and that's not to speak of the abhorrent things leaking into it, and I'm holding it together, but oh…\" He rubbed his forehead. \"Have you ever been bedrock? It's so very tiring.\"\n\nShe felt a strange euphoria passing through her. \"You know what? I think I can relate to that.\"\n\nHe smiled at her. \"That's nice. I don't get to relate to people very often, these days. I'm sure you have many questions.\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"That's too bad,\" he said. He looked like he meant it, in the instant before he winked out entirely.\n\nAnd then the cave followed suit.\n\nShe was standing in front of the ADDC window.\n\nShe screamed.\n\nIlse screamed.\n\nImrich screamed.\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\nI am a diplomat.\n\nI have never led a battle before. I was among the occupiers in '95, and I spent my time on the barricades, but there was no need for me to put my height and weight to better use than mere intimidation in that conflict. The present situation demanded my physicality to a certain degree, but I was much more valuable as a leader. And so, I led.\n\nI had conferred with the elders, the warriors and the community leaders. We had developed a plan of attack, and should that fail, a plan of defence. We were familiar with the ragged treeland, the rocky shores. We knew where all the best hiding places were. The Mobile Task Forces were primarily urban-focused, and would have preferred roads and trackways and open fields. By redirecting them to our killing ground, Dr. Corbin negated their tactical advantage.\n\nWe still had to press our own.\n\nWe did not array ourselves on either side of a wide plain and advance like the armies of old Europe. They crept along the cliffsides, and we dropped down on them or pulled them into hidden sinkholes where the lake had eroded the cliffbase away. They took the higher ground, only to discover that with hours of preparation and an array of hunting equipment, camouflage and blinds included, we had been able to craft higher ground still in the upright trees. When they tired of being picked off one by one, I called a general attack from the front. I stood, making a target of myself, and I do not know what I expected to happen next. I knew I would be fired upon, and I suspected I would be hit. I knew I was buying time for my people to get into favourable positions, to flank the invaders and continue our harassment of them. Perhaps I hoped that a gust of wind would blow down upon us from above, a thunderbird deigning to intervene on my behalf, flattening the trees and the enemy and perhaps even myself but allowing the advance guard to do their jobs. \n\nOnly the first of those things happened. The shots went wild, and emboldened by the adrenaline, I raised my hand and shouted: \"Onkwehonwehnéha!\"\n\nThe native way. Dramatic, to be sure, but as I said I am a diplomat. I knew if we survived, I would want to tell this story. Others would need to hear it, to understand what we had done, and why. \n\nSo, we needed to make it a good story.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhen they stopped screaming, Udo snatched at her reagents pouch and hurled the contents to the floor. There was no time to discuss the manner of her return to AAF-A; Dr. Rydderech was alive-ish, and he was magic, and he had given her a few extra minutes with which to expedite her plan, and she was not going to waste the miracle. Brenda would never have forgiven her.\n\nBrenda, in fact, was relying on her.\n\n\"Holding up, Corbin?\" Imrich said into his radio, as though reading her mind.\n\n\"I am surrounded by cats,\" the voice came back. \"That was my retirement plan. I'm reconsidering as we speak.\"\n\n//Uh oh.// \"What are they doing?\" Imrich asked her.\n\n\"Just the creepy-ass reflecting eyes thing cats do.\"\n\n\"Don't make eye contact.\" He made eye contact with Udo; she didn't have anything more helpful to suggest, so she shrugged and finished her preparations. She pulled off her sweater, and pulled on the AAG labcoat. She'd cut the sleeves off for ease of motion; it was really just a cape, and that was why she needed it. It made her feel heroic. \"Toms take that as a sign of aggression.\"\n\n\"If that applied here, I'd already be dead.\" Brenda's voice was strained, but solid. \"There's no direction I can look in to avoid eye contact.\"\n\nShe was standing in the Mishepeshu tunnels beneath Kettle Point, where Udo had left her. She was radiating her bad vibes out to the MTFs from a place of total security beneath their feet, where they'd never think to look even if they could locate her.\n\nThat was the hope, anyway. Hopefully the water panthers were able to recognize Métis as friendlies.\n\nUdo kicked her shoes off, and stood in the steel frame. She wriggled her sock feet in the sand, and began to hum.\n\nImrich switched off his radio, then he and Ilse recited the necessary instructions as Udo spun up the sands, completing the circuits and patching into the makeshift computer they had laid down on almost every exposed surface not required for personal transit. They called out the code, and she programmed it in. Imrich kept calling, since it was his predictions that made their magical machine stochastic enough to do what it needed to do. Ilse watched the display hooked in via easily the world's strangest interface connection, monitoring the input and output, and when the first compensatory cyberattack arrived as the hardcoded system recognized their intrusion, Udo burned it out with a literal firewall the instant she heard the warning. She felt the vibrations of the water pipes inside of her, the cycling of the air, the unspeakably vast presence in the caverns far below as it wheezed in its long death throes, all of it at once, and she didn't feel it when her feet left the ground.\n\nThey could never have hacked Site-43's telecoms with a real computer, no matter how long they had to construct its architecture. They needed to be able to move beyond the constraints of programming language while still, in the end, working within them. They had to overcome countermeasures designed to block ontokinetic interference, electromagnetic pulses, and transmissions from alternate universes. It was an endless, continually evolving battle, and it took all three of them to make it happen. \n\nIt //didn't// happen.\n\n\"The connection keeps breaking,\" she panted. \"To the array.\" She was not overwhelmed; her mind was vast and powerful now, she //was// AAF-A, she had never been wiser or seen things more clearly. But her body was aching all over, the strain was tremendous, and if they were going to make this work they had to work it //now.//\n\n\"I'll go.\" Imrich picked up a loaded gun from the dinner table.\n\n\"No,\" she said, zeroing in on the particles linking her with the ceiling cable which fed all the way to the comms array tower, the location of the recurring gap. \"I'm already there.\"\n\nShe took form in the far-distant corridor, and saw the man with the rifle at the same moment the man with the rifle saw her. He blew her apart in a hail of bullets, faster and more forceful than what Brenda had managed a month ago, and she struggled to keep her balance even as she realized she didn't really need to. //This isn't a human body. It's not subject to human rules.// She floated in the stale air, moving toward him, allowing the pockets of sand he hit to arc out of her back and then arc back to her, sealing the holes without stalling the advance. Her silicon avatar was on him in seconds, this lone MTF soldier with sand on his boots which in her confused state parsed as her blood, he had been rubbing out her veins with toes of steel, he had been //killing// her, and she had to stop him or everyone else was going to die, too.\n\nShe fell on him, held him in place, enveloped him, and then worked to repair the connection. Far away, her ears were still receiving instructions, and she was still inputting them. She focused on the code. She felt barrier after barrier fall away before her. She was in the tower, she //was// the tower, and the tower was theirs, the connection was made, and the final step of the plan stood before her.\n\nShe took it.\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\nWe had been waiting for the final signal to complete our victory, and when it finally arrived it was just a matter of mopping-up. The most vital part of the plan outside of our control concerned enemy communications: if they could radio back to the Site, tell them what they knew, another attacking force could emerge to harass us at any time. With the comms array in Dr. Okorie's control, however, this would not happen. Their radios were jammed, and they were left almost leaderless. I removed the final qualifier by cudgeling Gedeon Van Rompay on the head with the butt of his own rifle; \"Are you going to scalp me, now?\" he growled, and it was so much like a thing he really might have said that I wondered how much of him was still in there, struggling to escape.\n\nI didn't wonder long. I struck him again, and his body went limp. His mind could wait.\n\nAnd that, it seemed, was that. We secured the perimeter of the camp, assured ourselves that there were no flanking attacks incoming, captured the last stragglers and reviewed what we had won and lost.\n\nFourteen warriors had fallen.\n\nThey had taken sixty-four prisoners.\n\nI counted seventeen dead agents, meaning all the MTFs had emptied from AAF-A to face us. They had, in their ignorance, imagined there were no further threats. We were flush with the heady rush of victory.\n[[/div]]\n\n//You killed him.//\n\nIn her haste to finish the connection, to take over the array, she'd forgotten about the agent in her grasp. She lowered him gently to the ground. He wasn't breathing. In a blind panic she sent the //vim harenae// through his mouth, expelling its final gasp of air, and searched for some means of starting his lungs back up. But it was useless. They were collapsed. She had crushed them.\n\n//You killed him.//\n\n\"Brenda?\" Imrich's voice was tense; she could hear the tension even drifting out into the trackless depths of panic as she allowed her murdering self to disperse, as though she could thereby absolve her own person of its evil deed.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry.\" Brenda was out of breath too. \"Somehow they figured out where I am.\"\n\n//Are you okay?// she wondered. //Because I'm not.//\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Imrich asked.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nUdo was standing at the window again. She blinked. She blinked back tears. She fell into the nearest chair.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Ilse crowed, tapping at the keyboard on her window, \"don't touch that dial. You're on Radio AAF-A.\"\n\nBrenda's voice came through just seconds later.\n\n\"I, uh. I think I'm a dog person now.\"\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\nI would later realize that among those in MTF gear had been a few scientists and technicians, pressed into service in service of a ruse. The Pit Bosses had traced Dr. Corbin to her lair in the tunnels, and attempted a kill or capture. They had met with resistance they had not expected, and the conclusion had been swift and decisive.\n\nWe thought it was over.\n\nIt was at this moment the enemy played their final card. From Intake Point-94 in the centre of the lakebed came a stream of jade and gold, an army of eldritch attackers formed from what water remained in the deepest murk. They had no weapons, but they would need none; there were hundreds of them, and dozens of us. \n\nWe arrayed along the lakeshore to open fire, hoping our higher ground and the advantage of range would produce a miracle, but we never fired a single shot. We had won the human conflict, and the inhuman one would be fought proxy-to-proxy. The caves along the shoreline exploded with a torrent of serpentine bodies, copper tails shining in the dim sunlight, fangs bared and teeth sharp. The Mishepeshu army crashed against the Nobodies and tore them to shreds, which splashed into nothing on the rotting bottom of Lake Huron. It wasn't a fair fight. It wasn't really a fight at all. The cats gave no quarter, and the Nobodies offered nothing resembling resistance, and when the latter were gone the former streamed into the Intake Point to reclaim the tunnels they had made.\n\nA few shimmering stragglers are said to have fled into the mouth of the dead serpent. I can neither confirm nor deny these reports, as its mouth has since closed, and cannot be re-opened.\n\nAnd that, in brief, is the story of the Second Ipperwash Crisis and the conquering by force of Site-43 by the united peoples of Kettle Point.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Desagondensta \nin Dr. Harold Blank, //The Lines Are Down: An Oral History of the End of the World//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Udo?

Okorie was approaching with Corbin, and Corbin had an arm draped lazily over her shoulder. Moving away from the server hall, Harry was flanked by Bradbury and Veiksaar, one on either side, both of them radiating some sort of possessive instinct.\n\n//I have no idea what's happening.//\n\nIbanez was standing in the middle of the hall, the pair and trio closing on her from the north and south. \"You alright?\" she asked when the newcomers were close enough to hear.\n\nOkorie looked like she was only half-present. \"Still intact. You?\"\n\n\"Unbreakable.\" Ibanez looked over her shoulder. \"Say hi to your girlfriend, Harry.\"\n\nAnd she walked past them. Wettle saw her speaking into her radio. He couldn't hear what she was saying. He walked toward her, but she didn't look back again, so he kept walking until he had a much clearer view of the happy reunion.\n\n\"Hi,\" Harry was saying to Okorie. He had the hood of his sweatshirt up, and his hands in his pockets. Veiksaar was glaring at him, for some reason. Bradbury was watching him with her usual spaced-out expression. He wasn't making eye contact with anybody.\n\n\"Hey,\" Okorie responded. She had her hands clasped behind her back. She looked nervous, and... bored? Drunk? Something like that.\n\nCorbin still had her arm around the other woman's shoulder. When she said \"Howdy,\" she casually reached down and squeezed one of Okorie's breasts. The thaumaturge came alive, grinning maniacally, shooting her partner a look of complete panic.\n\n\"Right,\" said Harry, and he turned to follow Ibanez without another word. Okorie rushed to follow him, and he quickened his pace. They both disappeared through the far door.\n\nBradbury and Veiksaar exchanged complicated looks. Corbin walked up to Wettle, and stuck out a hand. \"Hey,\" she said. \"I'm Brenda.\"\n\nHe shook her hand. \"I'm a third wheel.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Buddy, this car's nothing //but// third wheels.

Lillian was already in the corridor, watching Harry pace in circles to avoid conversation with Udo. \"We're going to explain everything to the old man. We've got numbers on our side, he's going to have to listen.\"\n\nThe All-Sections Chief was also in the hall, a pair of natives in camo outfits standing casually beside him. One, a woman, gave them a friendly wave. Nascimbeni waved back. \"I didn't mean to overhear,\" said the ASC, \"but I think you just suggested making Edwin Falkirk //listen?// I don't see that working out.\"\n\nHarry attempted to engage Lillian in conversation. In response, she turned and headed into a side passage running along the telekill sheathe where she would be protected from the dual threats of mind control and other people's problems. Udo remained behind him, and so he stared resolutely at the wall.\n\n\"You've got an army, right?\" Ibanez stopped tugging at Nascimbeni's jumpsuit and looked up at the Mohawk warrior. \"Push comes to shove, we threaten to push and shove.

She'd already told Delfina some of what the Survivors needed to know, but she was still fairly bursting with vital information. Things were going to start happening very quickly in the static stagnant swamp that was Site-43, of that much she was certain, and it was going to be in large part thanks to what she'd discovered in the enemy camp.\n\nShe considered heading back to J&M to check on the rifle...\n\n//Footsteps.//\n\nShe weighed her options quickly. She could shout, and risk only being heard by the approaching party. She could try to hide in a well-lit corridor, wearing a blue outfit and being six feet, three inches tall. Or she could stand her ground, and see what was coming. Only one of those options carried any weight at all.\n\nShe stood her ground.\n\nA service hatch squeaked open just down the access way, and a slim young man with dark skin and haunted eyes clambered out in front of her. When he saw her, he froze. When he saw what she was wearing, he turned back to the hatch.\n\nShe raised a hand. \"Hey! Hey. It's me. It's really me. What the hell are you doing out here?\"\n\nBecause, of course, she recognized the young man. More than his immaculately-groomed appearance, she recognized the sweater vest and slacks.

In the month since they'd all woken up alone and confused in the midst of a world-ending threat, none of them had ever felt so close to the edge of disaster, or salvation.\n\n\"Thought you were dead,\" the old man snarled. He was flanked with two guards, one tall, one short. Holt and Bosch. \"Long dead.\"\n\n\"Happily not,\" said McInnis.\n\n\"Not so happily.\" Falkirk waved a hand, as if he could dismiss the entire encounter with body language alone. \"You're superfluous now.\"\n\n\"I could perhaps say the same about you,\" his opposite number replied evenly. \"That's what you're worried about, is it not?\"\n\n\"You lack the capacity to worry me, Allan.\" Falkirk advanced on him, this time waving to keep his escorts from following. \"You're not anybody now. You abandoned your post.\"\n\n\"This is not factually true, though you could make the case morally.\" The former Director looked rueful. \"I would welcome a review of my actions, and the motives driving them, at a later date.
