  "content": "+ **Part 9: The Redd Era (Wha-Wha-Wha-What!?)**\n\n[[==]]\n\"Alright, so now we're gonna dig into //the Redd era.// But, there isn't a single article written in the Redd era on the site, in fact this piece of lore is entirely invisible to the average readership. So, instead, we're going to talk about the events that //are// written, in the Judy era, that lead to the Redd era first.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We've already namedropped the two major articles here. That would be [[[Curtain Call]]] and [[[Austin \"Aggy\" Genadew]]], but there's a third important article here, which would be [[[The Really Really Real Adventures in Capitalism]]], all of which are written by me, with Aggy being co-written with Dharma.\"##\n\n\"Oh, and also [[[Do They Know It's Christmas Time At All?]]], written by Elenee and discussed earlier.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So to recap what's already been said, the Scarlet King, in the guise of a Mr. Redd, ends up in Cornelius' canon-cannon that launches the whole story into the universe / dimension / timeline that //What a Wonderful World// takes place in. Thought dead, his fate is a bit more ambiguous than that... later, it's going to be revealed --\"##\n\n##979ca8|\"This isn't even explicitly said anywhere in any written tales yet.\"##[[footnote]]Oh shit, it happened again, ye ol' switcheroo and Stuff interrupting himself somehow. 😋[[/footnote]]\n\n\"-- that the Scarlet King has been reincarnated as Dr. Isabel Helga Anastasia Parvati Wondertainment V, PhD, otherwise known as that protagonist from the Wondertainment TV show that was beamed into children's heads that were enslaved by the Factory.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Voiced by Isabel. Who is a bell.\"##\n\n\"That's not very plot important but it is very funny and I forever love that joke. So anyways, speaking of plot-unimportant details, and this one hasn't even really been written about, Mr. Redd Jr. of the Little Misters is shown in [[[Cornelius the Collector]]] to be kind of //impulsively// created by Cornelius, like how he made Mr. Redd in the previous timeline. I imagine this was //supposed// to be (though he was unconscious of this fact) an attempt at creating a vessel for the Scarlet King who, like Cornelius' consciousness, was spreading influence all across the timeline as their consciousnesses were beamed into this new world Cornelius had created.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It's all the very wibbly-wobbly and whatever-we-want-it-to-be kind of magic.\"##\n\n\"But that vessel fails because the Scarlet King, though not dead, //has// been severely wounded, far too much to take hold of a physical being. So the Scarlet King -- who, by the way, during this whole time, has no real consciousness, is working on instinct and doesn't know who they are -- needs an easier target. Well, where else... but the dreamlands? But Oneiroi?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So, the joke here, of course, is that Isabel, in Djoric's writings, is the reincarnation of the Wondermaker, who fights the Scarlet King in a very typical mythical good-versus-evil sort of way. But this time, the Wondermaker and the Scarlet King are the same, and Isabel is a reincarnation of them both. Thematically -- well, referentially -- this means at some point we're going to address the internal turmoil of an Isabel that is fighting herself, essentially. But that hasn't made its way into the story yet. Let's get back down to earth and start dissecting the actual extant articles on the subject of Isabel.\"##\n\n\"Sounds good! So Isabel is made, beamed into children's heads in a cartoon, and then left. Nobody knows she's alive -- the reason implied for her being a real, physical being is just that they beamed this TV show into their heads literally as dreams, and the dreamworld is shown to be somewhat physical and real in the SCP universe, as it exists as Oneiric space. So, we basically pull some big leaps of logic and say, maybe a character who is so beloved by so many people in Oneiric space can become a breathing, thinking dream-being. A tulpa, by one definition.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"One would wonder why, if this is possible, there aren't //more// beings like Isabel Parvati running around.\"##\n\n\"Well, at some point a character would probably point that out and plant a seed of doubt, which later would be answered by the reveal that it's because this process really //can't// make people like this --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well, 'can't' is a strong word considering that another fine point in this whole canon is that the magic of the SCP universe is mostly chaos and unknowable, though that //too// isn't written about, really. There's maybe a line in reference to that in [[[This Toy Facsimile of Life]]], spoken by Cornelius to Mr. Redd.\"##\n\n\"-- but the collective imagining of a character //does// act as a suitable //vessel// for the Scarlet King to possess. Its reality is very, very weak, which gives the King's parasitic nature a way in. The prey is practically nonexistent. Finally, something that fits the bill.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We imagine the bill, in this case, requiring some kind of connection to Wondertainment or Cornelius or the like, as otherwise the King could have popped up anywhere. Something something, in his last life he was Mr. Redd, something something, Mr. Redd was made by Cornelius so the version of the Scarlet King that gets shot into this new timeline is inseparably tied to Wondertainment -- look, it's all bullshit and we //know// it's all bullshit, it's just contrivances and justifications to tell the story we want to tell. We know that, everyone knows that.\"##\n\n\"I think contrivances like that are pretty accepted on the wiki, though.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Indeed.\"##\n\n\"Okay moving right along. The Scarlet King, slash the Wondermaker, reincarnated as Isabel, sees the impact of her story in these children. In [[[The Really Really Real Adventures in Capitalism]]], we find Isabel has dropped in on Brainy --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Ayyy Brainy!\"##\n\n\"-- as Dr. Neurosis, doing his usual shtick, in his dream office, waiting around for potential clients, y'know. The stuff. That he does. He's of course scared of Wondertainment as... y'know, his last thing he did before disappearing completely was something pretty heinous in their name, so when Isabel walks in with a Wondertainment insignia he rightly freaks out, but she calms him down and explains her story.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So after she was a mindless cartoon character, she sort of floats around the Factory children dreamspace as they continue to dream about her. But, they dream about her less and less, and the positive impact she seemed to have on their lives wanes in the face of, you know... horrible, torturous Factory conditions. She herself basically becomes disillusioned to the message of her show.\"##\n\n\"Well, not quite. Not disillusioned to the message of the show... disillusioned that the actual show itself did any good. The //message// of her show, well, is to fight evil, is it not? It's only that a show... just a message... it does nothing... without //action!//\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So she breaks out of the Factory children dreamworld into the greater world of Oneiroi West.\"##\n\n\"Or... Oneiroi. I dunno what West really means. I've never understood that part.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Funnily enough I think Isabel actually makes a joke just like that in her explanation to Brainy.\"##[[footnote]]She does.[[/footnote]]\n\n\"Well. Uh, yeah.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Anyways, she breaks out, and scours for a way to go from being a tulpa to existing in the real world, and eventually she finds Dr. Neurosis, whose whole deal is making vessels for souls to jump into. Well, she's soul enough so she can, and Dr. Neurosis basically just puts her in the real world, as is his job. While she's being beamed out, she reveals that maybe she knows who Brainy is, maybe she actually doesn't like him very much at all (go figure), confesses to a desire for violence (against the Factory, so who am I to judge), and then after she's gone they discover they've just been conned because she didn't pay and there's some namedrop of the Serpent's Hand.\"##\n\n\"Well that's a lot. So what's going on here?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well behind the scenes, what happened is that Aggy's crew, with Gina and... oh god what was his name. Chris. Those three are Serpent's Hand members, young politically charged people. The Serpent's Hand is a group of mostly magical individuals who are collected in opposition to the Foundation and other such oppressors of the anomalous community. Their goal is to protect their own and get information out there to destroy the Veil, in essence. These three characters are just sort of a friend group of Serpent's Hand members. They go out to try to find people to recruit -- because, I dunno, that's a thing they do? -- and Chris finds Isabel.\"##\n\n\"This is shown in the tale [[[Austin \"Aggy\" Genadew]]], we're referring to a scene in there.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Chris, who's kind of insinuated to have an ability akin to mind reading or more generally, like, personality reading -- he grabs onto people's //vibes// and uses it to manipulate them. In any case, when they walk into Isabel, he likes what he sees. She's doing some very typical kooky crazy stuff. I tried to take Djoric's Isabel's flavor of whimsy and wacky and just make it a little creepy. She's over-the-top, theatric, childish, but this time, kind of out for blood. I mean, I guess Djoric's Isabel was too, against the King, but I think that was more depicted as, like, a duty, or just, //it must be done.// Righteous, y'know? Here, we're making her impulse to hurt a bit more disturbing. Oh, and to make it a //want,// not just what must be done.\"##\n\n\"So they, what's the word... I dunno, 'enroll' and 'indoctrinate' both feel wrong.[[footnote]]You seriously forgot the word \"recruit.\" 🙄[[/footnote]] They enter her into the Serpent's Hand, there, maybe that wording works. Their first order of business is to get her a body, so they find Dr. Neurosis, and now we're caught up.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Next in the chronology is [[[Curtain Call]]],[[footnote]]Which still has a bunch of errors in present- and past-tense confusion which I've been meaning to fix for a long time and somehow have //still// not gotten around to. Hopefully acknowledging this publicly will motivate me, and if you go read Curtain Call and find that it's all grammatically sound, then know that this is what did it![[/footnote]] which has a lot of implications that aren't spelled out. Let's talk about those.\"##\n\n\"So... Isabel's goal, right now, is to destroy the Factory. That's end-goal number one. As she learns more about the real world, she finds more things she wishes to destroy. Under the guidance of Chris and the Serpent's Hand, she learns to hate the Foundation, the GOC (although I don't even know if they've appeared in this canon, and if they haven't, they're probably an unnecessary complication... if they haven't then let's say they don't exist, for simplicity's sake),[[footnote]]They're literally the ones that go fuck up Brainy's shit after attaching a tracker on him in Cairo, how did you forget that? 😜[[/footnote]] many world governments. Y'know, the works. If you're beginning to catch on to some worrying political messaging in this story, don't worry. We're gonna address that after the summation.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"But to get enough power to overthrow the Factory, she needs, like, a //lot// of people on board. She needs to drum up a movement. How do you drum up a movement? Well, she and her crew decide they ought to get an oppressor and kill him live to show people they're serious and that things can be done. Said oppressor, said evil shit, is Herman Fuller, the previous head of Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting.\"##\n\n\"I don't remember how much we've said about those people,[[footnote]]Not a lot, honestly.[[/footnote]] but Brainy works for them for a time, and by the time he's there Herman is already out of the picture. Or, y'know, not in charge at least. By this point in the story, however, he's worse than that -- he's been made into a wax puppet, forced to endure a fate-worse-than-death of his own creation (that's a long and mostly irrelevant story, none of the articles that describe this are tagged as being part of this canon so it's pretty much just a reference), which he at some point escapes. But, after he escapes, it's implied here -- or even just said out loud by Chris -- that he has done nothing of note since then. His connections eroded. His power has waned. He hasn't been capable of any real damage in a long time. But he //did// damage in his past, and now they're going to punish him for it, for their own means.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"This article is basically torture porn against Herman with little details dripped across it. Lady Redd (Isabel's new moniker) slays him on stage after revealing all his evil deeds, to an enraptured audience. Some people in the comments have headcanoned that Herman gets away somehow, but no. I didn't write it like that. In //What a Wonderful World//, this is where Herman dies, for good.\"##\n\n\"And that's all that is currently written about Redd's rise to power.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Woowee. Okay we've been talking for a while, let's take a break, play some video games and eat something, why don't we?\"##\n\n\"That sounds good. We'll reconvene in ten.\"\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n= ...\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nJasper blinks, and then widens his eyes. \"Uh.\" He move his forelegs, slowly, bending them and straightening them, and then tilts his head to one side, pushing until he hears a satisfying //pop// that tells him his neck has cracked, but it comes with an unexpected jolt of pain that he flinches at. \"Ah, fuck.\" He repeats the process, tilting his head to the other side, but he's ready for the pain, so only winces. He then returns to an upright seated position, and rubs some of the dust off of his armchair.\n\n\"Ugh, wow. That was a bit longer than ten, wasn't it?\"\n\n...\n\n\"God, I'm thirsty. Stay hydrated everyone. Where'd, uh, where'd Stuff go?\"\n\nNo answer is forthcoming.\n\n\"//Stuff?// Stuuuuuuff, yoohoo. Where are ya?\"\n\nStuff pokes his head in.\n\n##979ca8|\"Oh shit, you're back.\"##\n\n\"Yeah. Looks like the holidays really threw us out of our rhythm, and then even once the holidays were over the vibe just... didn't come back, y'know?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah.\"##\n\n\"At least we were actually writing something in that time, so it's not like we just lapsed back into writer's block completely -- heyyyy, where were //you?// Did you get to be mobile the whole time? I was just stuck here to this chair!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I dunno. Once you stopped talking, I went to get a drink. Didn't feel like that long to me, but time is pretty relative, especially when you only exist on the page.\"##\n\n\"I collected a layer of dust!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It's metaphorical. Anyways, I got you something.\"##\n\nStuff crosses the room and hands Jasper a soda.\n\n\"Oh shit, thanks. I was actually just thinking I needed something to drink. Wait...\" Jasper looks at the drink in their hoof. \"These things can grab?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"What were we talking about?\"##\n\nJasper stares at the drink with furrowed brow for a moment, then seems to come back to reality, regarding Stuff with a blank look.\n\n\"Oh right. If I remember correctly, we were just about to talk about Lady Redd, Isabel, doing all her stuff we never wrote her doing. Basically we were about to do a quick and dirty rundown of the endgame of the canon, which is a pretty big undertaking.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Kind of reasonable we couldn't conscience doing that while also hunting for presents and everything.\"##\n\n\"Yeah. Also Art Exchange... y'know, stuff.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Everyone here should go look at [[[Art Exchange Hub|Art Exchange]]] stuff.\"##\n\n\"Oh yes. Yes definitely. DarkStuff, please link that.[[footnote]]It was already linked earlier, but I will gladly do so again. Art Exchange deserves it. 🖌️[[/footnote]] We called the footnotes guy DarkStuff right? I'm Jasper, you're Stuff, the guy is... did we just call him Dark?\"[[footnote]]Ye.[[/footnote]]\n\nStuff shrugs.\n\n\"Helpful. Anyways, Lady Redd. Uh, so, she destroys the Factory successfully with her movement and everything that she drums up in the wake of killing of Herman Fuller and doing some more political maneuvering. There's, like, a verb, for going and getting support for a movement, maybe starting a revolution, but I can't remember it.[[footnote]]Rallying, recruiting?[[/footnote]] She and her crew gather support and numbers, do some political action to show they're part of things, start doing small scale stuff, and then grab a large part of the anomalous community to utterly destroy the Factory. And they succeed! As I said.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Which grabs the attention of the Foundation. Now, all of a sudden, Lady Redd, as the leader of the movement that is powerful enough to take down a whole inhuman horror-monster GoI, becomes a priority target -- and the Serpent's Hand at large as well, as this is all done under their banner.\"##\n\n\"This would be an 001 Proposal, actually. I was planning on SCP-001 being, in-universe, the reserved spot for //whatever// the most important SCP directive is at that moment, so the Serpent's Hand takes the priority spot in the wake of the death of the Factory.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Then the rest of the canon's story would basically spiral into a war between the oppressors and the oppressed, and a lot of intrigue would come from who ends up on what side and why, and what the conflict really means, what it's about, et cetera.\"##\n\n\"We have some very critical things to say about how this plot was conceived by our younger selves when we committed to putting everything in motion this way, but for now we're going to continue with recitation of the ideas uncritically. It's basically just gonna be a laundry list, and if some connection of plot points feels tenuous it's because we never really figured out how it all fit together or what went between Point A and Point B in that case. We just weren't there yet, we never outlined this part in full, so it's more like a collection of scenes.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And those scenes are! Isabel and her entourage take over Wondertainment as their base of operations, and Isabel executes Judy Papill. Her speech surrounding that execution is basically a discussion between herself and Judy along the lines of companies and profit incentives leading to dehumanization -- as in, once companies get big enough, they lose the human element completely, and are, by necessity of their structure, lost to the whims of profit incentives, which destroy their ability to be completely ethical. There would be discussions on Wondertainment's previous dealings with the Factory under the Cornelius era, and then also their compromises with the Foundation in the current era -- where they basically agree to operate by the oppressor's rules to survive in the market. I was really interested in this scene, I thought it would be really interesting.\"##\n\n\"I was also thinking this would be a fun time -- this or another speech she does, because she will be doing a lot of speeches -- to have a sniper try to take her out, and have the bullet grind to a halt before it reaches her, and she can get a huge grin and go 'wonderful, I've been //waiting// for someone to try that!' and that would become an action scene between maybe the GOC and the Serpent's Hand in the streets of Wonder World!™️\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And then we get to change up the aesthetic of Wonder World!™️ for the final time, now having it under a revolutionary banner, helmed by Lady Redd.\"##\n\n\"This //really// establishes her as a threat, and so we get like, a summit (is that the word?)[[footnote]]It is![[/footnote]] helmed by the SCP Foundation, gathering different organizations to address the Serpent's Hand threat to the Veil (their ultimate goal is to destroy the Veil -- well, I guess their ultimate goal is to destroy the Foundation, but interim goal is the Veil). Actually, screw that last section being in parentheses like we're not gonna talk about it -- the Serpent's Hand //does// at some point destroy the Veil, that's one of their big plays, rocking the world of the public and yaddah yaddah. Dunno if this summit happens before or after.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Back on topic though...\"##\n\n\"Right. So, it ends up that Holly Light, Faeowynn Wilson, MC&D (so, Brainy) and such get wrapped up in this side of things, because they're all organizations that benefit from the status quo. (Fae and Holly can have some really tough conversations about this together -- there's a //lot// to dig into here, but also, I think I put them on this side of the conflict before my views on how this conflict is weirdly constructed came into being, and I'm gonna have to assess their role in things, and how they feel about stuff, and... yeah.) They talk about some plans, don't know what those are. They contact Dr. Everwood because something something we wanna have them be back in the story and do some cool shit, Dr. Everwood discusses a //bunch// of wibbly-wobbly magic bullshit about concepts and how they can measure conceptual ties, they -- with the help of Holly telling everyone the real story about Cornelius -- figure out what //followed// Cornelius in with the canon-cannon. Identify Scarlet King, badabing badaboom, they discover Isabel as the reincarnation of the thing that ultimately destroyed the previous reality by inadvertently creating the Factory. (Did we talk about how the first thing they do in this reality is //destroy// the Factory? Because I find that fun.)\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We want to juxtapose this very in-depth analysis of the magic system of the SCP-verse with a line later, by Isabel, about how it's all chaos and nonsense -- and having her immediately demonstrate this with some show of power. Because I really //do// want the magic to remain unexplainable -- it is //openly// contrivance and nonsense, and probably if we were to think about this story thematically a lot harder, we could say something about how the oppressed fringe-groups get to have the magic, and that //normalcy// is built off of oppressing the people who have the ability to do things we don't understand under our limited cultural framework. Y'know, stuff like that. It could be interesting -- and empowering.\"##[[footnote]]I have also been informed that this is not a very unique plot idea, but ah well. I dig it. (There's no shovel emoji? Lame.)[[/footnote]]\n\n\"I don't think I'd ever thought of it that deeply until you put it that way just now, but yeah. I see it.\" Jasper sips his soda you and I both forgot he had. \"Ahh. That's nice. Thanks again.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"No prob. Uhh, what else what else... extremely minor details include wanting one person of the Aggie / Gina / Chris group to defect for plot intrigue purposes, probably Gina because Aggie and Chris both feel like they're too dedicated while Gina seems volatile. If I was okay with how zany this is, Brainy could become an unstoppable combative force as he continuously spawns from his Headspace with more and more monstrous bodies, seemingly unable to be killed. The Circus joins Isabel's side at some point. We want to portray Icky and Lolly's relationship as incredibly uncomfortably publicly kinky because some people have been uncomfortable with Lolly's depictions in Dread & Circuses and I feel like the two options are either to shy away from that discomfort, or lean into it //heavily,// because I think the source of the discomfort was mostly from not committing and existing in this weird middle ground where people were unsure what the author intended and if they were reading something fetishy. Uhh... I think those were the only two minor scenes we'd thought of.\"##\n\n\"And then now we're at the conclusion. Though the Veil //is// ultimately broken, the head of the revolution, Isabel, is assassinated successfully by the Foundation (or someone on their side). The canon 'concludes' with a tour through //many// of the characters seen before now, becoming completely introspective. All different perspectives on the events. How people are reeling, coping, and what their lives look like going forward.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Might be cool to sprinkle in a character you haven't seen here before -- if we really want to highlight perspectives, we could put in a completely new one. I like that idea.\"##\n\n\"And, if this were written like a book, the //very// last thing you'd read would be a conversation between Chester Williams and Maria Herring, talking about their small business and some anxieties about their lives going forward. I imagine Maria would be worried, and Chester would smile and speak comfort. The story -- the canon -- would end on optimistic lines about the beauty of the world. If we wanted to be cheesy, I bet we could even get away with saying 'what a wonderful world' as the final line, and have the emotional impact still land.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Even just thinking of the scene kind of makes me wistful and melancholic, in a... positive way.\"##\n\n\"Yeah... yeah.\"\n\n...\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay so there's a problem with this story.\"##\n\nJasper finishes a sip, putting the can down to say: \"There is.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It's the messaging.\"##\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Let's talk about that.\"##\n\n\"I'd love to. But first, I have to ask —\"\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ **Part 10: Who is the Scarlet King in This Story?**\n\n\"That seems like a useful thing to discuss, because its thematic implications are //really// important.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It is. So, in its original conception -- and I'm inclined to keep this idea and alter //other// things to accommodate it //if only// because I find this to be a //fascinating// idea to write a personification of -- the Scarlet King -- also known as the Wondermaker -- is a God of Progress.[[footnote]]//Oh, God of Progress / Have you degraded or forgot us? / Where have your laws gone? / I think about it now// 🎵[[/footnote]] In Cornelius' original timeline, the Factory's takeover of the entire world is in part because that is a timeline in which 'progress' meant the destruction of the planet, scoured for its resources. The Factory was the natural conclusion to this endless march towards 'progress,' which had been manipulated into existence by the Scarlet King, the Wondermaker.\"##\n\n\"Of course, I dislike insinuating that humans aren't responsible for the things they do and that other factors make us do evil, so I would like to say that the //intended// reading of this is that the Wondermaker more-or-less //represents// humanity's desire for 'progress,' and is not a completely separate entity. However, any interpretations of //What a Wonderful World//'s Scarlet King / Wondermaker will fail to match perfectly, because diegetically this god is 'killed' by Cornelius --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We're putting a lot of things in quotes, I see.\"##\n\n\"Yeah yeah we'll address that, shush you. But, as I said, it is 'killed' by Cornelius, but that didn't get rid of humanity's industrialization and scientific endeavors in the new timeline.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay let's rewind slightly first though.\"##\n\n\"Sure, what's up.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Let's just talk a bit more about the King himself. What he's like, what does 'progress' mean, why we keep putting it in quotes.\"##\n\n\"Alright, yeah yeah. We don't want to get too deep into the new timeline before discussing that. Okay, so. Let's say that the Wondermaker has been around since the start of humanity. I do like the imagery of it showing humans fire, even though I don't think it literally did that (y'know, once again, I think it's much cooler when humans get to claim credit for doing the things they did). It gets the idea across though: a kind of mentor that nudges humans along. A muse, actually, that inspires scientists and artists alike. Its personification is this. The Wondermaker is //deeply// invested in the success of humanity as a whole. However, it doesn't give a single shit about //you.//\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It has no regard for individuals. If people must die for progress to be made, so be it. The only health it is interested in is the health of the hive. It sees how conflict inspires innovation, and will thus inspire conflict. It is very Darwinist. It thinks that by pitting things against each other, only the fittest will survive, and this will lead us towards yet more //progress.//\"##\n\n\"But progress -- even in the story (though this was never written, when it //was// this was going to be the plan) -- is left intentionally vague. Progress what? Progress how? Running ourselves into the ground isn't progress. Progress towards what? Is there an end goal?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"No.\"##\n\n\"No, there isn't. The goal //is// progression itself. The Wondermaker will remain ever unsatisfied, will forever push. It experiences no comfort. It has no patience, and it has no foresight. It wants only one thing: to //build.// It wants humans to make ever bigger, more elaborate things. To go more places. To have more epiphanies, to know more things. It wants //more.// More and more and more and more and more!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"But of course, infinite growth is not possible. This is how we see Cornelius' timeline fall. We watch the Factory exemplify this concept, that when growth is the only goal humans are lost along the way, and we will reach a point when we completely burn ourselves out and die. Yes, the Factory is shown to be 'inhuman,' but it is, like the King, a representation of human activity, of human greed and industry. It is not //alien,// like some write it. In //What a Wonderful World//, the Factory is //us.// It is our worst nature as an unstoppable force.\"##\n\n\"But it does get stopped!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It //does.// Okay, so, Cornelius figures all this out -- what the Scarlet King is, how it made Cornelius make it a vessel (it likes walking among its subjects) -- and realizes he himself is an extension of this infinite growth, right? That Wondertainment, despite its candy-colored branding, is just another company that eats and eats. So that's where his idea for the new world comes from. A world without the Scarlet King, a world with less //ambition.// He's still warped, he doesn't make the perfect world, he only makes his own fantasy, with all its flaws inherent. He still believes, for example, that a company like Wondertainment //can// exist, free from corruption.\"##\n\n\"Poor sod.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Indeed.\"##\n\n\"The Scarlet King surviving the cannon can be seen as a nod to the fact that the King is a representation of human ambition, which has certainly //not// gone away.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"But now, maybe, you're connecting the dots, and going 'hey... wait... wait a minute.'\"##\n\n\"Yes, we made like, the same primordial evil that makes the world into a barren acidic wasteland from razing of resources and natural landscapes into the leader of the revolution against the oppressive reign of the Foundation.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Hmm...\"##\n\n\"Yeah, hmm indeed. And look, there are ways I can sell this idea -- there are ways I can spin this idea that I still would find interesting and rewarding to write. But in all honesty, at the time that I //conceived// this idea, I self-identified as a centrist, and it was almost as two-dimensional as you're imagining.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Mmm...\"##\n\n\"So I've written myself into a bit of a corner, where all the groundwork is there to capitalize on this reveal, but now I'm not sure I want to go through with it, because to make the leader of the revolution be... //this//, is to condemn the revolutionaries that follow her.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well, it //can// not be. Let's talk briefly about Isabel again. Who she is, what her motivations are -- and how she functions as a reincarnation of the Wondermaker.\"##\n\n\"Ah ah ah, to answer //that,// we need to talk about the Foundation actually! So, the Foundation is the current biggest barrier to that ever-nebulous //progress// we were just talking about. Think about it. Anything 'too advanced' for society to handle at that moment -- anything significantly outside of 'normalcy' -- gets shelved, gets //contained.// Cornelius' timeline didn't have this. Magic existed very out-in-the-open, there was no such Foundation. The Foundation puts a damper on our science surrounding AI, all of the possible energy sources we could have with anomalies, it disrupts //cultural exchange// by condemning and hushing entire religions, what it does to the information highway is devastating. This is the price of Cornelius' wish, to make a world with less ambition, that is happy with the //now.// (Despite the fact this is patently impossible, and ambition is a generally good thing.)\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So, to further the progress of the human race, the Wondermaker must take out its biggest detractors. Firstly, it seems the Wondermaker //has// learned a little bit, even if it's an amnesiac, because it starts by destroying the Factory. (Feel free to read into this how you want -- we'll return to it, but using a different lens, I didn't really develop what it //meant// for Isabel to crush the Factory first thing, thematically.) Then it takes a look at the big picture, and 'decides' that the biggest barrier to the progress of the human race is the Foundation and its allies. The Veil. It needs these gone to get its machine running again.\"##\n\n\"So... we've equated... the fight for human rights... with endless industrialization?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I don't think it's quite //equated,// they are weighed differently, //but...// inadvertently, we did put them in close relation.\"##\n\n\"But that's not really what we were meaning to say with this choice. Right? Right...?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"No, we weren't.\"##\n\n\"Good. I mean if we were I could own it, younger us had some shitty things about them, and it's healthy to own your shit.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah.\"##\n\n\"But still. It's good that's not actually a message we were ever intending to send.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"No. Of course not. Instead, it was supposed to be the //method// that we were equating.\"##\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So what was really being condemned here was the violence of everything. Isabel's hyperviolence, the Wondermaker's proceed-at-all-costs mentality. We were trying to say that without empathy, //everything// is for naught. You will end up making choices that lose track of the individuals, that start to have questionable relevance to //anyone// because of the sheer number of those you have to hurt to get there. When everyone's miserable, was the accomplishment of the goal meaningful? Or did you lose track of something? When you have to kill so many, who sees the fruits of your labors? That was the ideological tract this brainstorm went down.\"##\n\n\"...Well, when you put it like that, I kind of like it again.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It's not uninteresting! But it inadvertently condemns... well... //all// forms of violent protest, essentially. And I -- we -- of course, say this knowing //the intent// of ourselves back in the day. In fact, I shouldn't say 'inadvertently.' It //does//. That was the point. I very much detested the idea of violent protest. I had been caught by the narrative of the peaceful protests, that change can be enacted by... sigh.\"##\n\n\"Hmm?\"[[footnote]]##979ca8|\"This is the start of a really big conversation, and I need to go to sleep, so let's go to sleep and tackle this later.\"##\n\n\"Okay. Goodnight.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Night.\"##\n\n\"...\"\n\n##979ca8|\"...So are you going somewhere?\"##\n\n\"No, idiot, it's day again already. In fact it's been three days.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay then -- you know what, fuck it. Can we be done with making reference to how this is written asynchronously? If that's the correct word? It's getting old and it adds nothing. If we have to stop writing -- er, speaking -- then let's just not make mention of it and it can read as one continuous thought process.\"##\n\n\"Fair enough. In fact, uh, Dark? Mind putting all of this in one of your footnotes? Thanks.\"\n\n👍[[/footnote]]\n\n##979ca8|\"Ignore that. What I meant to say is, I had been caught by the narrative that change can be enacted purely by education and understanding.\"##\n\n\"I mean... isn't that the end goal?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It is. But there is too much investment, on the part of power-holders, to uphold the system as it is, and frustrate attempts at education and understanding. People have a vested interest in us fighting each other -- and that isn't to say that our fights are fake. But... let me rewind slightly. So I am -- we are -- a cishet[[footnote]]🤔[[/footnote]] white male, and we grew up that way. I didn't see the point in fighting. On the one hand, I do still believe that hatred and violence are, in part, self-defeating. But I also have never //had// to fight. My perspective is limited, and I am not of the crowd that needs to literally overpower someone to escape oppression. There is fighting in the world of ideas -- that shit is fucking //important.// It might, in my ideology, still be the most important thing. But we are all representations of ideas. We are more than our ideas, but we still enact the ideas themselves. This is a complex system --\"##\n\n\"That honestly we don't have all the time to get into right now.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"-- sure, yea. But, you know. Look. When people are //getting killed// for... oh, //anything// about themselves, like, you have a right to bear arms.[[footnote]]🍔[[/footnote]] You have a //need// to throw hands. If your ability to fight someone is what is keeping you alive, you'd better do it. If you have to punch someone to keep someone //else// alive, //you'd better do it.// More than that, even, I think violence is in the human genome. I'd rather it stay in boxing rings, and on football fields, in martial arts competitions and rock and roll stages --\"##\n\n\"Consensual violence is based.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"-- but that's just not the world we live in right now. You have to fight in the world of ideas... you have to bring people in, 'reach across the aisle' (as ugly as saying that makes me feel), let people learn. You have to make space for your enemies to become your friends, or else the //only// resolution you leave is violence. But...\"##\n\n\"But.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"But. When protesters storm an abortion clinic -- when a lynch mob comes -- you do what you need to do. If you need to be strong and intimidating, you do what you need to do.\"##\n\nJasper pauses. And sips his soda. \"Man this thing is fucking huge, what did you give me? 40 ounces or something?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah it's -- is that empty?\"##\n\nJasper shakes the fountain cup.\n\n##979ca8|\"Duuuude. You drank //all of that?//\"##\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"You shouldn't have done that.\"##\n\n\"I probably shouldn't have. I have like, a dentist appointment tomo-- nope. Today. It's past midnight.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"You're living fast and loose buddy.\"##\n\n\"Yeah. Okay back on topic.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"For sure.\"##\n\n\"...\"\n\n##979ca8|\"...\"##\n\n\"Uh, so, how did this...?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Isabel, protests... violent protests...\"##\n\n\"Yeah yeah! Okay so, at conception, Isabel was supposed to be a leader of a human rights revolution to overthrow 'the government' --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"The Foundation is the only government that matters when you peek behind the Veil.\"##\n\n\"-- but she is driven entirely by hatred and black-and-white thinking. If you're not with her, you're against her. If you're against her, you deserve to be overtaken by the tide. We would use this radical political stance to make some criticisms of progressive parties -- particularly infighting despite being functionally on the same side. Witch hunts, hypervigilance among their own. The stuff that gets progressive people cancelled on Twitter. (God, once again, saying that makes me feel ugly -- cancel shit is its own discussion, can we agree to leave this one alone? But I hate using it because of the people who //usually// bring up 'cancel culture' and the degrees to which they do it make my blood boil.)\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And that's still very interesting, and worth writing about.\"##\n\n\"I do think so, I truly do. But, Isabel is portrayed as the face of this movement, this movement with nominally good ideals --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"If they actually put them into practice.\"##\n\n\"-- right. Okay okay, let's... take a different angle here. Because I don't think it's Isabel that needs to change, specifically. I mean, we need to be much more careful with her, we need to be much more cognizant about what she's saying and the role she plays in this story. What her existence says about the themes. But what you //can// explore with her, I still think is very fun. There are some niggling issues though.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Namely, being a God of Industry.\"##\n\n\"And!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And?\"##\n\n\"Being //the// representation of progressive ideals in this story. A big-huge thing missing from the original conception of this conflict is that Isabel //does// end up representing the uprising. We don't have people on her side of the fence contradict her, we paint the oppressed anomalous community -- via the Serpent's Hand -- as overall bloodthirsty. She gets shit //done.// No one else does. With no other representation, what this story is saying about progressives is... //bleak.// And unkind. We need a balance -- we need people who challenge her ideology without being the oppressors themselves.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And also without being peace-loving hippies.\"##\n\n\"Right. I've grown up, and, I don't think I want to forward the message that the best thing you can do is to hurt no one at any costs. I don't want to condemn radical action. I want to condemn polarization -- I want to condemn the death of empathy. You can hurt people for a cause. It should //suck.// You can do it. Please, in fact, do it. But it should //suck.//\"\n\n##979ca8|\"That's our perspective.\"##\n\n\"Yes, that is but one perspective. And //What a Wonderful World//... well the whole point of this article is to try to make this canon able to be written for by others --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Right, because this document is //so// approachable.\"##\n\n\"Oh //shush,// you're as aware as I am that we're hoping to make a much more condensed writer's guide.[[footnote]]Which will probably go on the revised canon hub, which will be a project on my horizon after posting this article.[[/footnote]] This is about the thoughts //behind// the writer's guide. So shush.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay, shushing.\"##\n\n\"Ahem. Anyhow, the point is, we are not the be-all end-all for what gets represented in this canon. //However,// consistency of themes is rather important if we want it to feel at all cohesive, so we're outlining our own suggestions for that. And what we're recommending is...!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"...\"##\n\n\"...Why isn't it going to the next part?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Because there's one last thing we should address here.\"##\n\n\"That is?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We failed to mention that Isabel is supposed to be unaware that she's the Wondermaker, and that we were thinking that revealing her to //be// the Wondermaker would throw her for a loop, and we could go into her own emotional turmoil, realizing that she is an actor made to forward a plot that undermines her whole ideology as written. The cognitive dissonance would be wonderful. //But.//\"##\n\n\"But?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Painting her as a pure depiction of her spoken ideology is a little disingenuous, don't you think? To condemn a revolutionary for paving the way for more oppression is //pretty fucking weird,// assuming they actually believe their own shit. And, historically, there is a ton of precedent for revolutionary leaders being power-thirsty and abusing their support to seize absolute control while spouting that they represent 'the people.' I think it would be more pertinent to portray her as a manipulator than so horribly misguided -- because, like, misguided by who? Herself? The Wondermaker? If she //doesn't// actually want to seize total control, then why is she acting the way she is? Subconsciously? But if the end goal really //is// to relinquish control when the Foundation topples, then is she doing anything wrong?\"##\n\n\"Well the stratification and persecution of her own people, yes.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay right --\"##\n\n\"And the killing people part.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay fair game. But I just don't know if that's close enough to reality to be worth representing. It's a wrinkle to the formula that confuses the message, I think, and we have a perfect reason //for her// to be power-hungry and want control.\"##\n\n\"But we've painted ourselves into a corner, haven't we? If she //doesn't// believe what she spouts, then everyone who is following her is portrayed as, basically, dumb. Misguided. And now we're back to condemning all radical action. If she //does// believe what she says, then we say that the end point of radical action is... what. What is the end point? If they won, would it be a good thing? Would all the violence along the way be justified? ... Do people who believe the ideals of violent quelling of the opposition ever actually coincide with nominally progressive ideals?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"That's how Communist revolutions were hijacked, wasn't it?\"##\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"What?\"##\n\n\"We were way out of our fucking depth when we started writing this, weren't we?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah. Deeply.\"##\n\n\"And we still are. We don't know enough. We don't have an informed opinion. It's all feelings.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"...They're strong feelings, at least.\"##\n\n\"Yeah, but, we can't argue shit. We don't actually know anything. We're writing a revolutionary story with no skin in the game. We, like, read //Animal Farm// and thought we knew what we were talking about. And this stuff is like... very relevant. Very modern. This isn't like, commenting on the building of the pyramids in Egypt. What we say on this topic is really, like, pertinent, and conveys our feelings about current politics.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah.\"##\n\n\"And by publishing this, we also don't have the excuse that we didn't think about it. Now we're being really deliberate. Now we're assuredly //confidently// stating whatever messages that we send out.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"...Are we?\"##\n\n\"Are we not?\"\n\nJasper stares down at the floor, his chest tight.\n\n##979ca8|\"Let's return to this, later.\"##\n\n\"Only if you promise we do. I think we've dropped a few threads here and there.\"[[footnote]]Actually, we've been pretty good on our follow-through![[/footnote]]\n\n##979ca8|\"I promise, but I think we should just power through first. Get your idea out. We can get back to this.\"##\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"It can, like, be in our conclusion maybe.\"##\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nYou didn't know that these two characters were close enough to touch each other, and previously it was definitely implied they weren't, but Stuff nonetheless reaches over and gives Jasper a pat on the shoulder. His hand stays there a moment, before he retreats back into his seat, having gotten no substantial response.\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay. Let's move on for now.\"##\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ **Part 11: Introducing... Nuance!**\n\n##979ca8|\"Not that there wasn't any before, of course. Heheh.\"##\n\n\"...\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Oh, c'mon bud, chin up, we got stuff to discuss.\"##\n\n\"Yeah, I know, just...\"\n\nStuff can't hide looking a bit exasperated, but tries his best to put on a sympathetic face. ##979ca8|\"Look, if it makes you feel better, we can have the conversation now, and with the magic of this-isn't-real we can move the conversation to the end. Get it out of your system.\"##\n\n\"No, no. Let's stay on track. We have the ball rolling, let's keep rolling it.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay.\"##\n\n\"Okay.\" Jasper sits up straighter, takes a deep breath, and then repeats: \"Okay.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Good. So?\"##\n\n\"So. To counterbalance Isabel, we need another representative of the anomalous community, someone who falls more in-line with my own ideals. If we're going to have a //bad guy// be the main actor of the revolution, we need to have a good guy be in there somewhere to so that the entire thing isn't defined by the bad guy. So, we conceptualized a character -- thus far unnamed, thus far with only one or two scenes in mind -- to represent this. They -- we imagined a he, but they could be anything or anyone at this point -- would be heavily focused on the empathy, the outreach, the education and the rehabilitation angle on conflict resolution, on attempting to build bridges, reach compromises and bring everyone into the fold.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Our only two scenes we thought of with them were a kind of... if not introductory scene, pivotal scene, that really showcases their ideology, them meeting with some //funky// people, making connections and deals with those the rest of the Serpent's Hand would find detestable.\"##\n\n\"Oh yeah by the way, if it wasn't explicitly said, the Serpent's Hand is the banner under which all the revolutionary stuff is happening.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We thought of this character as having a guy they bring around, basically to have the philosophical conversations with. A... foil? That's not the word. A sounding board, really. Their friend, who is questioning of their methods, which would make their scenes often be dialogue of that sort. This feeds into the final scene we thought of, with them.\"##\n\n\"Okay so, the endgame. Isabel gets killed, right? The Foundation //essentially// wins, but, y'know, the Veil has been broken, well and truly. Inroads have been made. The field //has// shifted, and she was integral to it. //Because// of the way the playing field has shifted, the Serpent's Hand does end up with more power and sway to effect change, even if the leadership has changed and they've been set back a bit. The direct conflict dies down, but the setting implies continuation. Due to all that has happened, our friend -- we ought to name them. Thoughts?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Uhh... Zhaleh.\"##\n\n\"I like that. Ever noticed that Persian names are so fucking pretty? Zhaleh. Tahirih. Maybe that should be the two -- Zhaleh is the one making connections, Tahirih is the sounding board.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Let's go with that.\"##\n\n\"Cool. Zhaleh accomplishes something, makes a connection, brings people into the fold, makes an inroad... but there's a hanging question. Would any of Zhaleh's accomplishments have been possible without Isabel's crusade? Was the violent uprising, in fact, necessary?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We didn't plan to answer this question.\"##\n\n\"The implication does seem to lean heavily in one direction though.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yes. It would be pretty clear that the //specific// accomplishments Zhaleh was capable of would have been made possible only through the Serpent's Hand taking radical action. Zhaleh wonders if they were going to be able to do anything if that weren't the case -- if what they were doing was going anywhere. Tahirih doesn't provide easy, clear answers to these questions. Though, I was wondering if they ask a question back. Something like, 'Maybe. Probably. But would it have been fast enough? How many more people would have suffered, died, been //contained// in the meantime? Is it right to take a nonviolent route when you can prevent suffering with violence?'\"##[[footnote]]Also, could they have reasoned with the Factory? Assuredly not.[[/footnote]]\n\n\"We don't condemn Zhaleh, per se, but we suggest that there is a middle ground between Isabel's ideology (or, what her followers believed anyways) and Zhaleh's. Isabel clearly destroyed unnecessarily, and for that is portrayed as unjust. She caused many issues. She created rifts within the Serpent's Hand, she preached a gospel of hate. But they //accomplished// something.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And that brings us back to something said earlier. Violence may be necessary. But it should //suck.//\"##\n\n\"'Love thy enemy' type bullshit.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah.\"##\n\n\"So Zhaleh is criticized, and Isabel's followers are criticized (by showing that their hatred makes them more blind to when their ideology veers towards reiterating the oppressive hierarchies of power as their predecessors, instates another dictator that would have been Isabel). Peace isn't always an option. Right now, I don't think peace is an option. But violent justice fails to acknowledge the imperfections of human judgment -- makes the same mistake as our current systems (when you're charitable enough to call it a mistake and not a feature): that to allow death as penalty, you create a system that will necessarily condemn the marginalized of whatever society you build. The unpopular. Can you trust that whoever you dislike today, the society you set up will dislike tomorrow? Can you trust that //you// are the perfect arbiter of who gets to die? Why?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"But nonetheless. When your life is at risk. Fight.\"##\n\n\"Fight like Zhaleh refuses to. The snappy way to put it would be something like: 'Action for the wrong reasons is just as bad as inaction for the right reasons.' That is the dichotomy we would be portraying.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Right.\"##\n\n\"And that's... well, that's the end of //What a Wonderful World//, as we imagined it. That's everything?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I... kind of think so.\"##\n\n\"Did we cover how companies lose humanity when they get to a certain size? How that feeds into Wondertainment?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I don't know if we did. Dark will let us know.[[footnote]]Yeah that was touched on.[[/footnote]] But I don't think we really need to go over it. I think mentioning it like this, even if this is the only mention, is enough.\"##\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So, are we gonna have that conversation now?\"##\n\n\"Yeah, we are.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Alright.\"##\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ **Part 12: Responsibility & Art. What Happened to You, Buddy?**\n\nJasper sighs.\n\n##979ca8|\"Feeling better than before?\"##\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Alright. Wanna discuss now, or postpone?\"##\n\nJasper sighs //again,// louder. \"Now. Let's do it now.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay. Where do you want to start?\"##\n\n\"Well, honestly I've been doing a lot of thinking on this, in the background, so, this discussion isn't going to sound as natural because I've already... talked a lot of this out, to myself.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Ah c'mon, representing our thought process is the whole point of this format!\"##\n\n\"Yeah, well, I don't always write things down as I think of them, even when they're relevant, okay? I took some time to myself, between writing things, and... well, let's start at the end, shall we? I think... my mission statement, such as it is, with my writing, is to write a completely honest depiction of myself and my own thoughts. I want to represent all of how I think, how I process. I want people to be able to read what I write and see a whole human being. Not a human tailored to an audience, or, made to be approachable. I want to be a representation of the human experience, not as it is presented to make friends, or, make people like you, but instead, how it actually //is.// How it feels. To be human.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay. Do you think you're accomplishing this?\"##\n\n\"One sec, I'm not finished.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Alright.\"##\n\n\"Before saying whether I'm accomplishing this, I wanna say why this is the goal.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Shoot.\"##\n\n\"It's for partially selfish reasons. I... struggle with self-absorption and ego, not necessarily that I think I'm //great// or better than people, but just that so much of my time is spent on //me,// so much of what I do is about myself. I want to give more of my mental energy to others, to developing relationships and caring. So, part of this idea... of self-exploration, of self-representation, of self-expression, is wholly self-involved. There's no way for it not to be, I don't think.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Sure.\"##\n\n\"But there's more to it. Or, there's a way that I can feel good about it, that I can tailor this mentality, this outlook, to my goals of being more focused on others. Did we talk about this in the Chester section?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Talk about what?\"##\n\n\"About uh, 'lighthousing.'\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I don't think so, no.\"##\n\n\"So, in that section I was rather honest about a part of myself I don't think is very desirable, approachable, or pretty. That interracial interactions make me uncomfortable, for some reasons I think are at least somewhat sympathetic -- that I'm worried about getting something wrong, about offending people, and that's very true, that is at the forefront of my mind. But, putting that forward is the very approachable, nice version of that discomfort. There is also, undoubtedly, that I have grown up in the whitest county in California. That historically our media does not portray interracial interactions in a positive light -- that I am white, and through white culture, I'm going to inherit racist tendencies and prejudices. That a lot of my life -- if not all of it -- will be spent, in part, deprogramming myself, and I don't think that the work will ever be //done,// because your brain, while very plastic, spends years building a foundation that all the rest of your brain chemistry works off of. (This is not science, this is just to my understanding.)\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Heheh.\"##\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I just remember, one of our beta readers -- could you believe we're having some people read this over before it goes up? -- read the Chester section and said they were afraid of posting that. Said it was a 'bad look.'\"##\n\n\"Mhmm.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And here you are, bringing it up a //second// time.\"##\n\n\"Well... yeah! Because it's relevant! Because... that's what I'm talking about, that's my point. I am willing to... okay, so, lighthousing, right? It's a term I heard that I really liked. It's about, like... so, why be like, very outwardly queer somewhere where doing that is, like, straight up dangerous? Well, besides it being a //fuck you// against the systems, both social and governmental, that make your position dangerous, it's also because other people -- closeted queer people -- need representation that they //exist//, in the wild. They need to be able to see people they can identify with. I... this is a long story, and it's only a little relevant, so I'll just say it's much like how I felt weird when my Aunt Michelle died, and I felt like... I felt like my version of mourning was wrong, that something was wrong with me. 'Cause I didn't cry, or, do anything like what I'd seen in media, even in some others I knew in real life. Then I watched Jacob Geller's video on //What Remains of Edith Finch,//[[footnote]]It's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7ABdDSYJko&pp=ygUYamFjb2IgZ2VsbGVyIGVkaXRoIGZpbmNo How Edith Finch Handles Death], and it is very good![[/footnote]] and he talked about how he didn't cry when his best friend died in high school, and how he described that resonated so hard I... like, realized, all of a sudden, that it wasn't that I was //missing// something other people had. It's... hard to believe that you yourself exist when you don't have representation of how you work, out there, in the world.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah.\"##\n\n\"It's lonely. I don't feel as lonely anymore, thanks to Jacob Geller. And don't you //dare// think that //I// think I'm being as noble or as vulnerable as openly queer people in the deep south, I am coming from a place of much more safety and privilege than that and I know it, but, I want to be that. I want to be 'a lumen,' as a comment on my Adventure Time fanfic put it (that comment really made my day, and I love that word now, I am adopting it).[[footnote]]This comes off as incredibly self-congratulatory, but I reread the fanfic and //I// came up with \"being a lumen,\" they were quoting //me// and I //forgot.// I find that very funny. Still lovely comment, still made my day, still a word I wanna keep using, but wow, that is... that is kind of full of myself, haha![[/footnote]] I don't want to represent the acceptable version of myself, I want to represent //myself.// I want to represent anything and everything people keep behind closed doors, so that people can see things talked about that people don't like talking about. And while it can be detached, while it can be put on characters in fiction, I think the feeling is even stronger, knowing what I am representing comes from personal experience, that what I am writing is not speculative, but, representative of the real. That... if you relate to a character of mine, in some way, that character is a representation of me -- I am a representation of that character -- there is someone you can talk to, there is a real person out there, like that.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Hmm. I don't feel that will hold up for //all// of your characters -- don't you //want// to write characters that deviate from your personal experiences by a wide margin?\"##\n\n\"Like, Chester?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well, you had some concerns about writing Chester.\"##\n\n\"Yeah. I had a different beta-reader, and then some people I shot the shit with IRL, tell me that those weren't reasons not to write Chester, but reasons to do a lot more research, consult people. Chester is a character worth writing. If other people don't write Chester, it's not like I have a moral obligation not to write him. If I enter writing him with an open mind, with the allowance that someone can fact check me or say 'hmm, maybe do this part differently,' then there shouldn't be anything stopping me.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Hmm. Do you feel that?\"##\n\n\"Kind of. I don't disagree with them, I don't not feel uncomfortable still.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Right. Well, if you were to write Chester... does what you said hold up? About being a representation of your characters -- of being a version of them you can speak to, of being proof that whatever they relate to in the character exists in a real person?\"##\n\n\"Well... hmm. Maybe not. I'm not sure.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Does that affect your philosophy on writing?\"##\n\n\"I'm sure it will. It will have to be examined and incorporated, of course. There are characters that are more representations of myself, and there are characters that are more explorations of my relationship to other things. Or even, I'm sure there are characters I have written and will write that are meant to be plot-forwarding -- that aren't necessarily intended as explorations of anything, but instead accomplish a goal for writing the story. The stories themselves are almost always made with messages in mind, at least these days... I dunno. It's a complicated mess, but... I think the core of it remains the same. There's a uh...\"\n\nJasper pauses.\n\n\"There's a beauty to, like, fanfiction. Like, what you think of when you think fanfiction -- the public's version of it. The //My Immortal//s of the world. They're //very// honest. They don't always communicate the best messages, they aren't always pretty, they're not... thoughtful, all the time. But there is so much to be gained from having honest, raw representations of thought processes, interests. I know I've heard of fanfiction being used as a way to process trauma, as a means of exploring relationship dynamics, the self. And it's not always intentional, it's often just what happens when you write uninhibited by the fear of repercussion for what you write. Will you occasionally get heinous shit? Yes. Well, I want to more or less embody the good aspects of this kind of fanfiction, combined with the intentionality and open mind of an adult.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And you think that these kinds of explorations are good, not just for your own sake, but for others?\"##\n\n\"Well... yeah, I do. I think the comments I have received on my works in the past support this. I've historically gotten positive responses to stories exploring the worse aspects of myself, admittances of fault. I try to be honest in, like, everything. I actually got fired for it once, heehee. Don't tell your bosses that you know what you're doing is wrong, fellas. It's better to say you had no idea and won't do it again. I learned that one.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Heheh. Yeah.\"##\n\n\"Worked out in school though. I got to be a bad student that teachers still had no problems with. It was nice.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"'Twas.\"##\n\n\"Sorry, circling back, yeah. For the sake of lighthousing. For representing learning. For showing people that it's, like, okay, to be imperfect, and that these situations are known, experienced, related to.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Alright.\"##\n\n\"...Alright?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Sorry, I don't want to interrupt if you're not finished. Are you finished?\"##\n\n\"Mmm... sure, yeah, for now. What?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well, I'd like to point out a key difference between the type of writing you're talking about and what you're looking to do with //What a Wonderful World.// Your character studies allow for a greater variety of people, of exploring flaws and breeding empathy, sympathy, and relation, but... this canon is a different beast, isn't it? It includes that first part, but, what you're struggling with is that it also makes an //assertion.// The scale of your story requires that you aren't merely showcasing an aspect of human nature, you are discussing a problem and proposing a solution. You could bounce around the characters, ask a lot of questions, discuss their positions and personal misgivings, flaws, joys, sorrows. You could have almost all of the plot beats happen within the confines of your comfort zone, writing with a focus on the humans behind the action, but in the end you're still depicting a high-stakes conflict as a direct allegory to the current political climate, and how you reward or punish the characters for their beliefs and actions will portray a message.\"##\n\n\"...\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Which is to say, all of your sentiment is nice, but, you've talked around the central issue, that made you get upset about what you're writing in the first place. Ultimately, you're comfortable with the smaller-scale character studies not only because they make lesser assertions about the world at large, but also because you //are// confident in the message they send. You feel your position, that all humans are deserving of empathy and compassion, is defensible. That //is// a message you are sending with those character studies, and you know it. That will be especially true with the Cole Ortegren story that will be coming out alongside this article. It's a rather explicit purpose of that article. Your issue //here,// is that you //aren't// confident in the message you would be sending. How do you address that?\"##\n\n\"...\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Did I go too hard?\"##\n\n\"Man, you were the one who //questioned// whether we're sending a confident message with this story! Now you're talking completely different. What happened?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Bro, I'm just devil's advocate. I balance you out, whatever form that takes. At that moment, you needed some doubt. Now, I'm trying to make you confront the issue again because you worked around it. I guess it's fair though, to add here, //are// we making a confident statement? That could be part of the 'how do you address that.'\"##\n\n\"Well... I've given it some thought, and, I have an answer for you, I'm not sure it's one I //feel,// but it's a working uh... what's the word. Premise? I can use it as a premise for my thinking, or, I can use it as a tool to explain how I //would// justify myself, for writing a story that sends a message I don't feel especially confident in, even if I don't necessarily believe it. Is that good enough?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Whatever helps continue the discussion, yeah, that sounds useful.\"##\n\n\"Alright. Well... I'm, a very nonconfrontational person. To a fault, I think. I even have, like, this fantasy, of having been bullied more in high school, not to be able to be the victim and be self-righteous, but specifically to know I could //handle// it. Like, I wish I was challenged more, in my developmental years, so I could handle people giving me shit, or that I could handle, well, //producing// conflict as well. A lot of my actions are centered on //not//. I just dislike arguing, and I wilt pretty quickly when it becomes a heated conversation. So, it's difficult for me to feel comfortable //making// any kind of confident assertion, because I am very afraid of being challenged.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Right.\"##\n\n\"But, I don't think that's particularly... helpful. I think that people ought to put out their opinions. I think you should have some basis for speaking -- I think if you know yourself to be //especially// uninformed, detached, then you shouldn't, I dunno, write a whole story about the political climate in Sudan without doing a fair bit of research. But... this is the United States, I live here, and, there is purpose to //having discussions.// And discussions don't //happen//, progress isn't //made// if nobody asserts confident opinions and explains how and why they think the things that they do. I think... the ideal form of communication is to embody your opinion fully and honestly, and then, in a discussion, explain why you think how you do, while the other (should they be against your position) does the same, and you honestly assess the reasons for your own conclusions and take into account what the other person said.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"That is //heavily// idealized.\"##\n\n\"It is, but it's an ideal I think I can embody. I can put forth how I feel, how I think, and leave myself open to discussion, interrogation. I mean, already, once, I have heavily altered the fabric of //What a Wonderful World// due to losing faith in the message I was sending. I have considerably more faith in what I am sending now.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"What are you sending?\"##\n\n\"Well, I've been thinking about what I wanted to do with these characters, and I was thinking the story ends with Isabel's assassination, right? I don't remember how much of this I did and did not say, but, basically, Isabel is meant to be action for the wrong reasons, and Zhaleh is inaction for the right reasons, and the story criticizes both. In the end, Zhaleh realizes they couldn't have accomplished any of what they accomplished without the more radical action of Isabel's group. I've also decided -- and I think I decided this after writing the Scarlet King section, so this may be new information -- that Isabel is manipulative, that she is explicitly making a ploy for power. She may believe some of what she says, but she also believes in her right to take power and enforce her ideals, subjugate those she dislikes (maintain a structure where she has a faithful following). In the wake of her death, we follow her faction, which regroups and continues operation, building a platform based on the ideals marketed to them by someone who didn't even have their best interest in mind, and was using them. I imagine the person who reclaims the leadership position similarly understands what Isabel was actually doing, and continues the trend, milking people's fear and hatred to gain position. But it is not without nuance, Isabel's group made significant inroads that did, in fact, aid Zhaleh's efforts, and it is Zhaleh's realization of this fact that makes them move towards more radical, violent action themselves. This is where I want to leave the story.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So, you are asserting that some violence is necessary.\"##\n\n\"I... think that I am. I mean, we've discussed that here. We have. My point is against the hatred of the act.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Are you confident in that point?\"##\n\n\"Relatively. I understand that hate can be a powerful motivator, I just fear what it motivates. I fear for our conceptions of justice, our vitriol. I fear for the continuation of a culture so focused on punishment and pain. I think that without compassion and empathy, it's easy to be manipulated and to follow new power structures that exploit you, and lead to a similar end. I watched a YouTube video recently that talked about some of this, actually. I really liked it.[[footnote]]That would be [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPhrTOg1RUk Envy] by Natalie Wynn.[[/footnote]]\"\n\n##979ca8|\"So, Zhaleh is still the //good guy,// they represent your ideals --\"##\n\n\"More than that, they represent specifically my failings, I think. My nonconfrontational attitude. They are me telling myself to do more. But, honestly, we're getting a bit off track. Yes, I think I am good, sending this message. I don't think that undoes my concerns from before. I do think I'm still a bit... out of my depth. I am still writing from a place of privilege and detachment. What we should be discussing here is not exactly what message I'm going to be sending --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Hmm.\"##\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"That //you're// going to be sending?\"##\n\n\"...Ah, right. Sorry, this whole thing is supposed to be handing people the tools they need to write for this canon, and there I am, again, seeing it at as //my// project. Maybe... actually, maybe reframing it as //not// my project makes my point better here.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Oh?\"##\n\n\"Because it's not about the message sent, really, it's about opening up an avenue for discussion. Right? It's about creating media that sparks discussion. That represents a viewpoint, to be used to support and to critique. Its merit, decided by its audience and detractors. That's the point of media, isn't it?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"One of them.\"##\n\n\"Maybe not a point, always, a point requires that the creator intended it, but a //use//, certainly. Media is //used// as a means for discussion and representation. I can promote that use. Right?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yes.\"##\n\n\"Well, then that. That is what I want to do. And I think I accomplish that better by writing how I feel and what I think with the utmost honesty, than I would by being meek and dodgy. I've been reading Ayn Rand recently --\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Oh //gods.//\"##\n\n\"-- yes I know. But. I've been reading her recently, because I wanted a good frame of reference for like... what she and her followers -- Libertarians -- //think,// how and why they think it. And her book, the one I'm reading, //Atlas Shrugged,// well, //wow// does it accomplish that. It's a fantastic resource for that purpose! It is extremely informative and enlightening, while being a piece of media I just... well let's politely say that I have a lot of feelings on the matters of which it speaks, and I think that Ayn Rand is an //intriguing// mind. (And while we're here, let me say with less sarcasm that I think she is a very intelligent person, who comes to some //extremely wild// conclusions. Thankfully, her prose is actually good, because if it wasn't it would be truly difficult to get through her writings.) And yes, there are arguments to be made that Ayn Rand 'shouldn't have published that book,' because it advertised and spread harmful ideas into the public consciousness. But, if we were to say that she genuinely //shouldn't be able// to write a book of that nature, then we're entering the realm of book bannings, and I feel very confident saying that my target audience here -- nearly 100% of those who will actually read this article (say, the ten //maximum// who have made it this far) -- agrees with me when I say book bannings are immoral and bad! I don't feel the need to make that its whole own discussion right here.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah. We know where the idea of book banning goes. We all know the value in protecting unpopular opinions.\"##\n\n\"Exactly. So, for the same reason, I shouldn't need to feel nearly so much anxiety and trepidation as I do, about asserting a viewpoint, representing my opinions, even if they aren't those borne of the highest education and widest perspective.[[footnote]]And laying myself low, prepared for disagreement and discussion.[[/footnote]] And it works, it synergizes, with my desire to represent a real human being, you know? My want to be honest. It is honesty. That's what I want to promote.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Once again getting into a lot of //I// territory here.\"##\n\n\"Oh -- look, do you want me to make this generalized? I can make this generalized. Look, I think we're done here. I'm making it about me, yes, but just as my own want to represent myself is to resonate with others, find things within me that are within other people, this, too, is about me, but it's speaking to //you//, the reader, the prospective writer for this canon, this believer in //What a Wonderful World.// But, you want me to make that explicit?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yes.\"##\n\n\"Okay. You got it. Let's make this explicit.\"\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ **Part 13: The Writer's Guide to What a Wonderful World**\n\nJasper slaps his hooves together. \"Okay! You want to write for //What a Wonderful World?// What are you waiting for! Here's what you have to know!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"First, in case you are genuinely tackling this as a writer's guide, let's summarize all the most important plot beats of the canon.\"##\n\n\"Ho boy.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Lightning fast, brutally short, come on.\"##\n\n\"Sure sure. Okay, so in 1909, Chester Williams, a black man in Boston, founds Dr. Wondertainment's World of Whimsy, in Boston. He isn't inherently magical himself, but being oppressed as a black business owner, he comes in contact with another secretive, oppressed group -- magical people! Maria Herring joins him and becomes the first magical toymaker of Wondertainment's lineage. They slowly build a refuge in the back of their shop, expanding it until it becomes the start of Wonder World!™️, where the Wondrous people take refuge from the 'Real World,' and where the company Wondertainment operates from. That's the Chester Era.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Maria dies, and then Chester dies, and he names his heir as Cornelius Młynarczyk, who continues the economic expansion of Dr. Wondertainment as a company -- at all costs, even dealing with the Factory at times. In his time, he creates the Little Misters as an artificial-life children's band. This brief era, starting in 1976 and lasting until 1998, is the Cornelius Era of Wondertainment, kind of regarded as the 'Dark Era,' in which it's all a bit scary.\"##\n\n\"Cornelius dies, and Holly takes over. She receives a letter from Cornelius on her day of inauguration as the new Dr. Wondertainment which she keeps secret. She largely works on reversing Cornelius' damage to the company, and reverting it back to its wholesome, people-oriented goal. This, the Holly Era, lasts until 2040, due to Holly Light's slowly deteriorating faith in herself and the company.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Judy Papill, Holly's partner, still has 'the spark,' and takes over as Dr. Wondertainment. She makes a compromise with the very people oppressing Dr. Wondertainment's goal and functions, the Foundation. She swears to have all the company's operations above board, and severely cut down on their making of magical products, in an effort to reach more children and enrich more lives. The Foundation accepts, and they grow a working relationship.\"##\n\n\"There isn't a clear year-mark on this part yet, so do forgive, but nearing the end of the Judy era, a mysterious Lady Redd of the Serpent's Hand begins making large political moves and taking radical action against the Foundation and the Veil at large, and eventually her contingent of the Hand make it to Wondertainment and target them as they are in cahoots with the Foundation, their main enemy. Judy is executed and Redd names herself as the newest Dr. Wondertainment, and they operate out of Wonder World!™️, ushering in the Isabel era.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"As the conflict between the Foundation and the Hand erupts, the Veil is ultimately destroyed, but eventually Lady Redd is assassinated. I might call this 'era' something like 'The Years Beyond.' Not much story is meant to be told in the post-Isabel setting, but of course it's open for anyone to explore, that is merely the end of my interest in making concrete statements about plot developments.\"##\n\n\"Okay, does that do it?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"That leaves a //lot// out.\"##\n\n\"It sure does, but hey, that's a workable outline of the setting, you can look at that and get an idea of how to write while respecting those plot beats. You'll mostly be right, as long as you also read some articles to get a sense of the aesthetic and tone.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah, I believe that.\"##\n\n\"Cool! Then, moving on, and perhaps more importantly... what //is// the tone? What should people be //thinking// about when wanting to write for //What a Wonderful World?//\"\n\n##979ca8|\"You should --\"##\n\n\"Ah ah ah, let me speak! //You// asked //me// to make it explicit, so //I'll// be making it explicit.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okayyy, okay, go right ahead.\"##\n\n\"So. //What a Wonderful World's// main theme is given away by its title: the canon is about finding beauty in life and the world. Specifically, finding beauty while still acknowledging the bad. Finding beauty in the ugly, even. Discovering that life is worth living, not even in //spite// of the pain, not really //because// of it, but... what word should go here, then... that life is worth living, and pain is part of life, and these two facts do not conflict. That joy is possible, that beauty can be found anywhere.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I don't think we've really highlighted that before, have we?\"##\n\n\"No, not really. This whole article was more about the political message of the canon, but its real central //tone// is the bittersweetness of life.[[footnote]]We have been talking about how we want to represent real human beings, horrid flaws included, hoping to inspire compassion and empathy for //everyone,// and I think that part of that is acknowledging the beauty within the human spirit, the same human spirit that can create the most detestable of all possible people. 🪷[[/footnote]] Perhaps the best band to get in the headspace for this canon would be //the Flaming Lips,// with their extraordinarily popular song //Do You Realize,// but also like... I dunno, most things by them? They hit the right silliness sometimes, too, and they come with a psychedelia that jives very well with the eye-searing colors of Wondertainment's aesthetic. Go listen to them. Great band.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"A little sidetracked, there, friend.\"##\n\n\"True. In any case, while there is room for depressive, venting articles in //Wonderful World//, the central message is perseverance and love of life. It can be about the struggle to attain these things -- it //can// be about anything you want, really -- it can be about redefining your senses of beauty and love, but its about the search for and the discovery of happiness.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Couldn't it be argued, that's what much of the human experience is?\"##\n\n\"It can be. And I suppose this canon is making the argument that it is.\"\n\nStuff nods.\n\n\"And seeing as we just mentioned the human experience, let's make this the segue into what we were talking about in the last section. The biggest word for this canon should be //human.// I don't much care to see perfect good guys nor cackling evil bad guys. Even if we were to believe that such people can exist in real life -- and, I concede, I think of the 8 billion people on earth, there may be a few that truly exist in such stark contrast to my own ideals that I may lose the ability to sympathize -- this story isn't about that. It is about representations of the imperfect human experience. It is about people doing their best. It is about humans using the tools they are given to work towards the best outcomes they know to achieve. It is about positive change, it is about discomfort. What I want from you, prospective writer of a //What a Wonderful World// article, is //honesty.// I don't want idealized humans chiseled from marble, I don't want magical characters that are just you if you could do the things you want to do. I want people I can meet on the street. I want every character to be written with a desire to understand them, to empathize with them, to embody them, or have them embody some part of //you.//\"\n\n##979ca8|\"We want difficult art.\"##\n\n\"We want difficult art!! Knowing full well the risks we are taking by saying this, we want art that makes you uncomfortable to write, and makes the audience uncomfortable to read, and we want everyone involved to be looking for the beauty, not in looking upon what we hope to exist and what we hope to be, but what we //are,// because while each of us holds something we dislike about ourselves, we do better to acknowledge and embrace our faults than by pretending they don't exist to make ourselves more presentable, more acceptable. I find that, by hiding flaws, you merely lose the ability to see when they influence you. It's hard to notice your prejudices if you're so certain you have none.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Yeah. I hope people get your vibe, because 'uncomfortable' can mean a lot of things.\"##\n\n\"That's very true. Like, the intent is to write things that make people uncomfortable because they are honest, not because making people uncomfortable is the goal and you succeeded through slight of hand and writing techniques. Y'know, not shock horror, not senseless but impeccably described violence. I dunno. Listen to //the Flaming Lips,// read //Take it Away, My Darling!// You'll get it.\"[[footnote]]In a conversation recently, a friend and I differentiated \"discomfort\" from \"distress\" -- the aim is the former, not the latter.[[/footnote]]\n\n##979ca8|\"I think they will.\"##\n\nThe two sit in silence for a moment, then briefly making eye contact.\n\n\"So is that it?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"I mean. Do you have anything more to say?\"##\n\n\"Not off the top of my head, I don't think. Kind of unsure what the response to this article will be. It's not very traditional and I think it might rub some people the wrong way.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Well, then, prepare for that. But I'm optimistic.\"##\n\n\"Glad someone is.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"And maybe this'll breathe some life into the canon. Some new authors, even.\"##\n\n\"I do wonder. We didn't make this a very approachable piece, so, it's not //that// inviting.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"No, but the hope is that that means the people who do get this far are more likely to be the ones inspired by it, no?\"##\n\nJasper nods slowly. \"That's the hope. For sure.\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Okay then. Well, then I think we're signing off.\"##\n\n\"Yup. That only took... oh dear. A full year? Yeesh. Well, bye!\"\n\n##979ca8|\"Bye! Love you all.\"##\n\n\"Long live this stupid website, eh?\"\n\n##979ca8|\"For sure.\"##\n\n\"For sure.\"[[footnote]]💚[[/footnote]]\n[[/==]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n//P.S.// @@    @@ Hi! It's me, Dark again, just giving a closing statement, kind of related to the questions about whether any of the messaging I'm sending I'm confident in. It goes without saying, but I'm saying it anyways, that part of the point is that it's hard to make assertions when I still feel like I'm learning and my views will change. I think it's useful to try things on and see how they feel, but the thing is, I'm by my very nature very wary of anyone who's //certain// about anything, and that makes it a lot harder to feel confident in myself, because I don't want to risk being //certain.// It's that attitude coming into contact with my want to send nonharmful messages that's really chafing. I don't think that'll ever stop, lest I become set in my ways, which I at least don't foresee happening for a long time.\n\nSo, just like how Vend-a-Friend has some messaging about mental health I don't much care for, I know for a fact things I write now I will find distasteful in some way or another in the coming years. But if I let that stop me, I'll never write again! How shitty would that be?\n\nSo really this is all an anxious meditation on self-change, and I figure that if you ask me in a year's time, my ideas on how this should all play out -- the conclusions Zhaleh comes to, what Isabel represents -- will be different again. And that's why it shouldn't all be up to me.\n\nAm I just reiterating stuff I already said? I dunno. But I felt like this was a useful addendum.\n\nWrite cool shit. Don't be afraid to be yourself. Heheh, or, be just the right amount of afraid to be yourself, but be honest anyways. //Learn.// Never stop learning. And practice what you learn by writing, maybe. Art internalizes. Art externalizes. Art is really fucking cool.\n\nAlright.\n\nPeace,\nDark~!",
