I was two years behind in high school, held back because we moved to America when I was a young child and I didn't understand English very well. As the anime continues, Shiragami introduces her two \"legally adult\" children who also attend Otaku High. I was the oldest of three girls, but I felt like the youngest. My sisters were my \"social coaches,\" as my parents put it. My middle sister, two years younger than me, was in my same grade. She's an adult now too, with a real job out somewhere safer. I'm so happy for her, and I miss her so badly.\n\nSCP-8608's anomalous properties begin to manifest when I was thirteen years old. My parents asked me if I felt \"funny\" when I held hands with boys at church to pray. I didn't know what they meant and I didn't understand why they were worried when I said no. When I was fifteen I still couldn't get that \"funny\" feeling. My father, trying to comfort me but failing, reassured me that he knew I wasn't gay. I didn't know about that, myself. I didn't feel like //anything//. But next year, when my sexuality would finally come in, we'd find out for sure.\n\nOr the next year, I guess. Or the year after that.\n\nAttached is a complete list of SCP-8608's episodes, alongside notable features and details that both differ and remain consistent between viewings.\n\n||~ EPISODE TITLE ||~ EPISODE TITLE (ENGLISH) ||~ SETTINGS/CHARACTERS ||~ DESCRIPTION||\n|| //コミュニティクリニックのすぐ近くです// || //Is it wrong to enroll in the same high school as my daughters?// || Ayana Shiragami, Imoto Shiragami, Musume Shiragami, Adam Markley; The Shiragami kitchen, Ayana's bedroom, Otaku High, Headmaster Markley's bedroom || In this episode, Ayana Shiragami is depicted as a struggling young mother who enrolls in high school alongside her two daughters. Headmaster Markley is depicted as Otaku High's stern but charming headmaster. Other details change between viewings. ||\n|| //思い出は換気口にカビが張り付くように喉に張り付く// || //Is it wrong to date the headmaster even if we're both adults!?!// || Ayana Shiragami, Adam Markley; Otaku High, Headmaster Markley's bedroom, \"The Forest\" || In this episode, Ayana Shiragami and headmaster Markley are depicted in a romantic and sexual relationship. ||\n|| //これがあなたが望んでいたものではありませんか？// || //Isn't this what you wanted?// || Ayana Shiragami, Adam Markley; Otaku University || In this episode, Ayana Shiragami is depicted as a college student attending Otaku High. She meets Adam Markley at the school's anime club and begins to foster a relationship. Depending on the viewing, the final five to eighty minutes of the episode consist entirely of Ayana vomiting into a gas station toilet. ||\n|| //あらゆる関係には犠牲が伴います。これは普通のことです。// || //My Adventures at the SCP Foundation// || Ayana Shiragami, Adam Markley; \"The Foundation\" || In this episode, Ayana Shiragami is depicted as a young junior researcher working for \"The Foundation,\" a fictional organization which studies and contains the paranormal. Adam Markley is depicted as her superior and site director. ||\n|| //何もないことは決してない// || //Nothing is Ever Nothing// || N/A || This episode consists of thirty minutes of uninterrupted footage of an asteroid flying through space. ||\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"\nclass=\"mz-img-wrap img-frame ]]\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Clitoris_Penis_Homology_-_latin_medical_terms.png/2000px-Clitoris_Penis_Homology_-_latin_medical_terms.png\n|caption=You shouldn't have it, but you //need// to want it.\n]]\n[[/div]]\n\nGrowing up, sex was always this strange, distant thing. It was the topic of the night so many times at youth group, but nobody ever really bothered //explaining// it to me. I never had \"the talk.\" I never wanted it. The boys talked about \"struggling\" with pornography and the girls talked about \"purity\" and \"saving ourselves for marriage.\" By the time I was fifteen I had learned to just kind of pretend I already knew all about it. And then I hit college. I hit college.\n\nOnce, about halfway through our relationship, I had lunch with another classmate. We talked about a group project we were working on and a movie we had both seen recently. You were //furious.// You made me swear up and down I would never be alone with another man ever again. Because I was \"yours.\" I was confused, and upset, and felt like I had done nothing wrong and everything wrong at the same time. I called my Dad for advice and he took your side.

He wants me to watch them with him. He wants me to \"just get used to it.\" We were driving to his dorm and I said I didn't really want to do it tonight. He was quiet for a long time and then said, very calmly, that he could swerve and crash the car right now. We did it that night after all. Watching (being?) SCP-8608 makes me shrink back into myself.

Goodness, babe. It's okay. I'm here. What do you want to eat? I'll get it this time.\n\n//I wipe the gunk out of my eyes.//\n\n**ME:** Fish sandwich would be nice.\n\n**MOM:** I was thinking the same thing.\n\n//I go and find a clean booth to sit at while Mom orders two fish sandwiches and Dr Peppers. After a few minutes, she comes and sits down with me.//\n\n//Mom gives me a fish sandwich, then reads my mind.//\n\n**MOM:** You told your father already.\n\n//I nod.//\n\n**MOM:** And, what did he say?\n\n**ME:** He said he can't believe I'm still so hung up on \"that gay little-\"\n\n//Mom holds up a finger.//\n\n**MOM:** That's... what I thought he'd say.\n\n//We both take a bite of our sandwiches.//\n\n**MOM:** I've tried talking to him, but, well, you know how he is. He's stubborn.\n\n**ME:** I just wish he would understand that I'm still hurting, you know? I wish he didn't have to //understand// it in order to accept it.\n\n**MOM:** So do I.\n\n//Another bite of fish sandwich.//\n\n**MOM:** You know, I was in high school the same time you were.\n\n//I look up.//\n\n**ME:** Huh?\n\n**MOM:** We moved to the U.S. when you were six, because your Dad had work here. But then, when you were a teenager, 2008 happened, his work dried up, and we had five mouths to feed and rent to pay without it. I... never really //got// a proper education, and I had an even harder time finding work in the recession than he did. So I went to school.\n\n//I think on that for a moment.//\n\n**ME:** How come I never saw you?\n\n**MOM:** What?\n\n**ME:** At school, I mean.\n\n**MOM:** ...Ayana, I went to an adult high school. For adults.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**ME:** That's a thing?\n\n**MOM:** Across the street from the community clinic! There were about ten of us in that class, I think? Every morning I would drive you and your sisters to school, then take myself to mine. Study for six hours, eat at this Popeye's if I could afford it, and then drive over to the gas station where I worked part-time. Spent another six hours there, then came back home. Your father spent those twelve hours doing odd jobs for the people at church and looking for employment. If I was lucky, you girls were still awake when we got back and we all had time for a movie. If not... well, we saw you the next morning.\n\n**ME:** Wait, is that why Jessie's mom always drove us home from school?\n\n//Mom nods, and takes another bite of her sandwich.//\n\n**MOM:** It was hard on all of us. I made sacrifices, your Dad made sacrifices, and we all got through. We tried to get through without you girls noticing too much.\n\n//I don't say anything.//\n\n**MOM:** Your father and I did a lot for you. We both love you, Ayana.\n\n**ME:** ...This isn't the best time to say this, but... you weren't always perfect. You and Dad.\n\n**MOM:** I know.\n\n**ME:** You made a lot of decisions that ended up hurting me.\n\n//Mom nods. She looks... old.//\n\n**MOM:** Every parent does, some way or another.\n\n**ME:** Do they?\n\n//Mom seems a little thrown by the question. We both stay quiet, and take another bite of our sandwiches.//\n\n**MOM:** So... what- //exactly// - happened today?\n\n**ME:** Not much to say about it. I saw him again. I don't know if he saw me, and I don't know why he's here. He was just... walking down the street. Looking the same as he always did.\n\n**MOM:** And you're sure it was him?\n\n**ME:** I'm pretty sure.\n\n//Mom finishes her sandwich and moves on to fries.//\n\n**ME:** I shouldn't feel so scared all the time, I know. It happened //years// ago.  I just-- I keep feeling like I'm going to wake up and still be in my dorm bed again. And he's going to still be there, and I'm going to be //back//, and I'm never going to get to leave. I've moved on and I still feel stuck.\n\n**MOM:** That's trauma, babe.\n\n**ME:** Well, I don't //want// trauma. I have a //job// now. I don't have time for it!\n\n//Mom chuckles joylessly.//\n\n**MOM:** Welcome to adulthood. It sucks and then you die.\n\n**ME:** Were you always this bleak?\n\n**MOM:** You're old enough for it now.\n\n**ME:** Hm.\n\n//We both sit in silence for a while and finish our food.//\n\n**ME:** Mom?\n\n**MOM:** Yes?\n\n**ME:** I'm glad we're still here. I'm glad we're both still around.\n\n//Mom smiles.//\n\n**MOM:** Me too, sweetheart. ...Do you want to spend tonight with us?
