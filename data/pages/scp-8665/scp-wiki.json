As for the entities summoned by the anomaly, they are to be locked in a replica of the White House. (Read information below for more context). To pick up the object, tweezers are needed.\n\n**Current Site of the Object:** Site-76\n\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-8665 is a paranormal shield protecting US Standard coins. If a coin is touched, it will summon the US president that it has drawn in it. They cannot be destroyed yet they can be locked, as their shield is extremely strong.\n\nIf the coins are touched by any other objects or anomalies that possess the ability to destroy instantly by just touching objects, the shield will cause an energy explosion and afterwards remain intact.\n\nAny president summoned by SCP-8665 has a bad memory and needs to be talked through things so they can fully understand any kind of situations.\n\nThe coins are the following:\n\n**==1 Penny==**\n**==1 Nickel==**\n**==1 Dime==**\n**==1 Quarter==**\n**==1 Half-Dollar==**\n\n-----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/axckt0J.jpg\n|caption=Image of SCP-8665 before containment\n|width=100%\n|align=left]]\n\n**Discovery Location and Time:** SCP-8665 was found in a hotel room in the Pearl Hotel, South Walton, Florida in June 19, 2024 by a 27-year-old male called Ethan Grant Jackson. He discovered the coins in the room he had been staying for the past 10 hours. (Room 8). Jackson tried to take the coins from the ground, thinking they are just normal coins, but he grabbed the Quarter and observed how George Washington just appeared in front of him, which scared him. But instead of calling 911, he touched the coin again and he saw how George Washington ceased to exist. From that moment, he spent 2 hours trying to destroy the coins with no success at all, until the loud noise made the other guests in the hotel report him. After he explained everything to the hotel personnel and showed evidence of what he was saying, the hotel personnel called 911. Once the authorities arrived, Jackson explained what just happened to him and they contacted the US Government. The US Government informed the SCP Foundation and the Foundation arrived to the place 44 minutes after. The personnel of the hotel was asked to check the cameras past recordings and the hotel guest lists from the past few days to see who was there before Ethan. They did this while the Foundation figured out what the coins could do. The hotel personnel was also asked to check in the guest lists who was in that room before Jackson. And in the guest lists, the only person to be in that room before Jackson, was Rebecca Aldridge Winslow, a 42-year-old female. She was found at her home and the Mobile Task Force took her to Site-76, the same thing was done with Jackson.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/qzAnrP9.jpg\n|caption=Pearl Hotel, South Walton, Florida, US.\n|width=100%\n|align=center]]\n\n**Activity of the Object and Experiments Done:** \n\n> **Interrogation Log:** SCP-8665 #1\n> \n> **Date:** 06/19/24\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. James Holloway Carter\n> \n> **Interviewee:** Ethan Grant Jackson\n> \n> **Interrogation Note:** Jackson was told he'd get $5,000 USD if he shared what he knew with the Foundation, but he was told that just so he could talk without complications.

The presidents fell unconscious at the time they were supposed to be dead and had a dream about the material their respective coins are made of. By the fact that Thomas Jefferson looked so young despite him dying of old age, it was assumed that the presidents reincarnate looking the way they do in the coins yet remembering everything they pre supposedly lived.\n\nEver since Ethan Grant Jackson said that he tried to destroy SCP-8665 with no success at all due to a shield protecting the coins, the Foundation has tried to break the shield using different types of acids, lava and other corrosive liquids, but that didn't work. Hammers, knives and all kinds of weapons were used to try to break the shield as well, with no success. In Site-19 a scientist asked for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-294 SCP-294] to generate \"A cup of SCP-8665 destroyer\" but the machine refused to generate it. It showed a text saying \"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP-682] was enough\". The coins were transported back to Site-76 afterwards. Once there, the Foundation also tried to make other animals touch the coins to see if the US Presidents were summoned. They were not. Not even objects could touch the coins and summon the presidents. Only humans. This was useful information because now it was known that any form and/or kind of material could be extracted from the coins by just using animal paws/feet or objects like tweezers.\n\nThe shield protecting the coins is invisible most of the time, it stops being invisible when it is touched by a human or something trying to destroy it. If any other type of object that's not trying to destroy the coins or any other living creature that isn't a human, touches the coins, the shield doesn't appear. This demonstrated that the shield is what makes the unnatural events occur and not the coins themselves.\n\n**Detailed Pictures of the Anomaly:**\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Penny]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/LbkqpWq.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/w53lKgn.jpg]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Nickel]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/LF1TTdW.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/JEYJo8o.jpg]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Dime]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/S443Q38.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/bMNgIC5.jpg]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Quarter]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/mCs46yi.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/10GWZRm.jpg]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Half-Dollar]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/rFkovH9.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/2zetZQt.jpg]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Shield]]\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/06Wgjn6.jpg\n|caption=Image of the shield that protects the coins.\n|width=100%\n|align=center]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n**Addendum 8665-A:**\n\n> **Interrogation Log:** SCP-8665 #6\n> \n> **Date:** 06/24/24\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Emily Rose Kessler\n> \n> **Interviewee:** SCP-8665-4: \"George Washington\"\n> \n> **Interrogation Note:** SCP-8665-4 was very agressive and confused at first, so he had to be put under the influence of drugs so he could talk without a problem.\n> -----\n> \n> [[span style=\"color:red\"]]//// [BEGIN LOG][[/span]]\n> \n> **Rose:** Hello Mr. Washington, my name is Emily Rose but you can call me Dr. Rose.

A hypothesis on why it happened was still made. It is believed to have happened due to an object that can corrode every type of matter, having contact with an object that is made of an entirely different type of matter. Dark matter. Just like when two opposite magnets have contact, except for the fact that the reaction in this case was a lot more agressive.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]] \"Death\" is theorized to be a being that can somehow warp reality. This considering the fact that the coins contain the very type of matter that shapes the universe.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]] It is not only believed that dark matter is what makes the shield unbreakable, but also that dark matter is what causes the anomaly in general. The dark matter found in the coins is believed to be sediments of the shield.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]] The note found next to Aldridge's body contained dark matter as well.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]] \"Death\" might be a cosmic being rather than a mystic one. The dark matter found in the coins and in the note is what fundaments this theory.\n[[/footnote]]\n[[footnote]] It is unsure if this \"Death\" has any correlation with the \"Death\" that [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1440 SCP-1440] has described whatsoever. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1440 SCP-1440] was asked how \"Death\" looked and he described three different persons that tricked him. But SCP-8665-5 described a horrifying creature that appears to be every evil mythological character merged into one being.\n[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
