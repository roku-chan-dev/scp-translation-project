If you want to see these plays in full, please join us at the Blackbox Theater in Three Portlands, from May 10th-31st.\n\n++++ //Tickets are now available, and can be purchased [[[Pseudogenesis Productions Hub|online]]].//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n+++ int. blackbox\n\nTHE STAGE begins in darkness, as all house lights FADE DOWN.\n\nA LIGHT turns on overhead, creating a spotlight on the stage. It is empty.\n\n+ solomon (vo)\nI have never wanted to be the center of attention.\n\nTHE LIGHT turns off. A second spotlight appears, downstage, near the audience. It too is empty.\n\n+ solomon (cont.) (vo)\nIt's not that I try to avoid it, you know? It just... I stand around, trying to hype myself up. Trying to find the confidence, find the will to just put myself out there! But...\n\nTHE SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns off. The stage remains in darkness.\n\n+ solomon (cont.) (vo)\nI've always been a fraction too late.\n\n++++ SCENE CHANGE:\n\nGRINDING SOUNDS play as the stage changes in the darkness; the walls of the blackbox theatre begin to disappear, as if stretching out into the abyss. The room is no longer a room: the rest of the play takes place within this BLACK VOID.\n\n+++ int. black void\n\n+ solomon (vo)\nI used to think that it happened only recently, you know. I didn't feel like this when I was a kid, right? And then I thought, fuck it. Hey, therapy seems neat, right? Ha.\n\nTWO SPOTLIGHTS turn on, creating two circles of light in the center of the stage. (These spotlights must be kept at a white balance of 3300K and 6200K respectively.) The hum of the lights is audible, having been AMPLIFIED.\n\n+ solomon (cont'd) (vo)\nNo matter how far back I go, even before I existed, I have always had the wrong timing.\n\nA CLOCK begins to tick quietly in the background. A VHS is heard REWINDING, as the light appears to bend in the air. Noise increases, as AUDIENCE MEMBERS voices can be heard, murmuring. It gets louder and louder, almost deafening until--\n\nTHE FULL HOUSE LIGHTS TURN ON, illuminating the stage in a dark, red, pulsating glow -- it is clear that instead of the same theatre this once was set within, the void appears to stretch on as far as the light reaches. On all sides, there is nothing.\n\nTHE RED LIGHT fades, alongside the noise. Only the two spotlights remain.\n\n+ 3300k spot (VO)\nAre you sure we're ready for this?\n++ \n+ 6200K spot (vo)\nI've been waiting for our daughter since I met you. Of course we're ready.\n\nThe incandescent spotlights make a HUMMING noise, which is amplified. The fuzz is nearly deafening, before cutting out to silence.\n\n+ solomon (vo)\nLike I said. Even when I was on time, I still managed to screw that up. After all, they were expecting a daughter.\n\nA SMALL SPOTLIGHT turns on beside the main two. This one is tinted 'Rosco Gel 332 Cherry Rose'.\n\n+ solomon (cont'd) (vo)\nI wanted to be a daughter, I think? I can never really know now. Not looking back. It's funny that way, isn't it? The moment you realize something about your life, the moment that I realized where I went wrong; from that moment on, you can never know what you thought before.\n++ (coughing)\nI just don't know what to do, you know?\n\n3300K and 6200K TURN OFF, leaving the PINK SPOTLIGHT alone on the stage. The light begins to waver, flickering, as the darkness surrounds it, threatening to engulf it.\n\n+ solomon (cont'd) (vo)\nThe things I felt as a little girl are foreign to me now. I can't even remember how I felt, not then. Everything has been poisoned by the now; changing who I was, an antivenom festering at my very core.\n\nThe lights flicker, like a CAMERA FLASH, a momentarily blinding white light.\n\n+ solomon (cont'd) (vo)\nSometimes I still try and find her. I dig deep, wondering if that little girl is still alive, somewhere. I'm happy with who I am, really, I just... you know when you've lost something that really matters to somebody who you care about, a lot? I don't want her back, but... but I don't want to disappoint my parents. So, still, I keep digging, sorting through the filth and looking for a corpse.\n++ (they sob)\nBut I can't see her, no matter how deep I dig.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"staticTransition\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n\n+ George\nWhere do you keep your kettle within this ramshackle hut? I see neither a stove, let alone tea bags.\n\nGeorge roots through the cupboards of the log cabin, but there is nothing in the cabinets.\n\n+ Noname\nThe fire is not lit yet. You cannot make a pot of tea if you do not have a fire.\n\n+ George\nBut you cannot light a fire for your tea unless you have a kettle to boil! Otherwise you are wasting wood. Now, where is the kettle?\n\nTHE MANNEQUIN CHORUS turns, and stares off-stage left.\n\n+ Noname\nWhere do you keep your kettle?\n\n+ George\nMine is at home. In England, where a home is not a home unless there is a kettle.\n\n+ Noname\nThen mine is with yours, at your home. If you sit, I will make you pine needle tea. After all, you are the guest, and you are in my home.\n\n+ George\nHow can this be a home without a kettle?\n++ (beat)\nAnd for that matter, am I a guest?\n\n+ Noname\nYou came to my home, where I was settled in for the night.\n\n+ George.\nNo, I am sure that I am the settler, not you. This is my home now.\n\nTHE MANNEQUIN CHORUS closes their eyes and does not move.\n\n+ Noname\nNeither of us had a home here, not before we arrived. The land was a home for another, long ago; can either of us truly say that we are not guests?\n\n+ George\nIf you cannot be polite and proper within my home, I would ask you to leave. After the tea, of course.\n\n+ Noname\nYou ask me to leave, and yet, that is all I do. I have never arrived, not quite -- I have always been here, and if I have never left, can I truly arrive?\n\n+ George\nSurely you must have arrived at some point. You are the same as I am, James, no matter the color of your tea.\n\nGEORGE holds a WHITE TOWEL in the air, and rubs it on their face.\n\n+ George (cont'd)\nFear not old chum, I will save you from your filth. Simply wash away your dirt, and you will be as pure as this cloth.\n\nTHE MANNEQUIN CHORUS open their eyes, and walk closer, surrounding the pair in a semi-circle.\n\n+ Noname\nAre we not cut from the same cloth? You have bleached yourself in the sun -- allow me to introduce you to soil, and we can address that.\n\n+ George\nNo. While we may be the same bolt, mayhaps, you have sullied yourself in devotion to nature. I, instead, worship science and medicine.\n++ (beat)\nI know what to do! I shall put on a pot of tea. That cures any wound.\n\n+ Noname\nHow will you put on your pot of tea, without a kettle? No, please, allow me to boil the pine needle tea, it will help you understand the flavor of the woods.\n\n+ George\nHow can you possibly make tea, if you have no tea bags? And no kettle? It is like trying to survive without culture, or society.\n\n+ Noname\nWhere is your society?\n\nTHE MANNEQUIN CHORUS turns away.\n\n+ George\nThey should be here any minute now. And they will have a kettle.\n\n+ Noname\nThis land has waited for a long time. There is no rush, nor a desire for a kettle.\n\n+ George\nIf you truly believe so, then you are an idiot.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"staticTransition\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n+ Valerie\n+ (furious)\nHow can you say that to me? After all I've sacrificed for you?\n\n+ ##green|Her Love##\nAll that //you// have sacrificed?\n\n##green|THE SUITOR## gestures to the empty bar, tables knocked over.\n\n+ ##green|Romancer## (cont'd)\nThis is what you have done. You have sacrificed nothing, not really. Look at yourself, Valerie, genuinely. Stop for just a fucking second and--\n\n+ Valerie\nLook at me? Jesus christ, look at yourself! I didn't do this; the fact that you didn't tell your family about me is why they fucking ran. You made this happen.\n\n+ ##green|Her Paramour##\nI made this happen? The only thing I 'made' -- was a fucking mistake. I wish I'd never given you that flower.\n\nValerie goes to speak, but no words come out. She sighs, moves downstage, sits, and puts her head in her hands. ##green|THE FLING## hesitates, looking on, but not moving.\n\n+ Valerie\nI told my mom about you.\n\n+ ##green|Partner##\nYou did? But I thought you said--\n\n+ Valerie\nThat she wouldn't approve? That she would scream at me, maybe kick me out for it? That she would think I was being manipulated, by the evil forces of ##green|the forest##, all because I'm still the stupid little girl she knew I was?\n\n##green|She## moves across the stage, sitting beside Valerie.\n\n+ ##green|Lover##\nWhat happened?\n\n+ Valerie\n+ (fighting back tears)\nWhat do you think happened? Why do you think I came here, out of the blue?\n\n+ ##green|Her##\nI... I thought that you were trying to hurt me. Embarrass me, in front of my family.\n\n+ Valerie\nI could neve--\n\n+ ##green|Her Heart##\nLook around, Valerie.\n\nThe lights flicker overhead, as Valerie sees the extents of the trouble she has caused. She reaches out to touch ##green|her other half##, but hesitates.\n\n+ Valerie\nWhat was I supposed to do? I... I never meant for any of this to happen. I just... I just wanted escape with you, to run away, to keep our fantasy going for as long as we could. I...\n\n+ ##green|Her Escape##\nDid... did you ever think about what //I// wanted?\n\nThe pair sit in silence for A BEAT.\n\n+ Valerie\nWas... was it always going to end like this?\n\n+ ##green|Her Fantasy##\nIt was always going to end badly, we both knew that. It wasn't just being gay, of course, that would have made it too simple. No, Valerie, we are just... two completely different people with nothing in common. Why would it have ended in anything //but// disaster?\n\n##green|They## turn away, standing and walking to start cleaning up the damage.\n\n+ Valerie\nBut... ##green|You## can't just give up! I... I love you!\n\n+ ##green|Her Former Lover##\nDo you? You've got a shit way of showing it.\n\nA BEAT, as both avoid eye contact. A second later, Valerie jumps to her feet.\n\n+ Valerie\nThis is all just because of my stupid fucking mo--\n\n+ ##green|The Ex##\nDon't you get it, Val? You are the problem. You can blame your mother all that you would like, but she's not here, is she? You spend your entire life, running, fleeing, living in a fantasy world, where it's all sunshine and kisses and sweet little nothings -- and you don't give a shit about anything else.\n\n+ Valerie\nThat's not--\n\n+ ##green|The Fury##\nI'm not fucking done.\n\nValerie is quiet.\n\n+ ##green|Catharsis## (cont'd)\nYou have a fantasy in your mind where you are a princess, suffering at the hands of an evil step-mother, and I'm a brave princess from a far away land, willing to serve you on hand and foot, whisking you away into the magical ##green|world of the trees##.\n++ (they laugh)\nThe real world fucking sucks, and you can't just cover that up. You can't keep running away from everything, and I won't keep solving your problems.\n\n+ Valerie\n+ (softly)\nWhat are you saying?\n\n+ ##green|Former Lover##\nI'm saying that we're through.\n\n+ Valerie\nI--\n\n+ ##green|Rage##\nWill you just fuck off and let me clean up your mess, one last time?\n\nSuddenly, BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS stream in from off-stage, illuminating ##green|the faerie##; EXPLOSIONS and GUNSHOTS are heard, deafening. ##green|She## moves instantly, shoving Valerie behind her.\n\n+ Soldier (VO)\nGet down on the ground, now! Back away from the human girl, or else.\n\n+ ##green|Her Protector##\n+ (yelling)\nWhat the fuck are you doing here? This is my home, you can't just--\n\n+ Erin (VO)\nShe has a weapon!\n\nGUNSHOTS erupt, as the ##green|fae## collapses to the ground in a heap. Valerie freezes, blood splattered on her face; she slowly raises her hands above her head.\n\n+ Valerie\nMom? What the fuck have you done?\n\n+ Erin (VO)\nI saved you.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"staticTransition\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n\nThe SHADOW-PUPPET CASTLE looms in the mid-ground, hills on either side. CUT-OUT FLAMES rise up from the fortification, a radiant glow emanating. The FROG-PRINCE falls to his knees, hands raised to the sky.\n\n+ Narrator\nBut of course, the Frog-Prince cared not for his soldiers, or for his citizens; he only cared about his precious treasures.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nSend more men in!\n\n+ Narrator\nThe Frog Prince said, bellowing from the top of his lungs.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nYou must save my precious rubies, and my delicate emeralds, and my piles of silver and sapphire -- please, you have to rescue them!\n\n+ Soldier\nBut sire, it is too dangerous! The flames grow ever stronger, and the castle threatens to consume all. Where is Princess Arabella?\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nThe Princess? Pah, if I had not left her alone, none of this would have happened! To think, a princess such as she could cause this immense trouble...\n\n+ Narrator\nThe Frog-Prince could not change, and was still a wicked man. And although Princess Arabella had tried to love the Frog-Prince and wanted to help him with all of her heart, he was too far gone. The gems that he so loved had crusted around his heart, a shell of opulence protecting his core. As Princess Arabella watched from the hillside, she began to cry.\n\nPrincess Arabella's cutout begins to cry -- her TEARS drip down the side of the mountain, in a rush of water.\n\n+ Princess Arabella\nFrog-Prince, hear me now! I have tried to be good and to show you the world as I see it. I have rescued you from the swamp and brought you to my home. I have dressed you in the finest garb and introduced you to kings and queens from afar -- and yet, you are still the same.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nArabella, you must return to me at once, or face the consequences. I have lost my fortune thanks to you, but I will not lose my princess. I may be a frog, but I am still a prince -- guards, bring her to me!\n\n+ Narrator\nBut there were no guards left. They had all burned, trying to save the riches in the castle.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nNo guards? Very well. Citizens! I call upon you, help your prince! The princess has betrayed us, we must hunt her down!\n\n+ Narrator\nBut there were no citizens left. They had burned, trapped in the dungeons.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nCowards, the lot of them! Almighty above, I beg of thee -- Princess Arabella has betrayed her prince, and must be punished! Strike her down, at once!\n\n+ Narrator\nBut I would not do so. I wished the Frog-Prince had burned.\n\n+ Princess Arabella\nDo you see the truth now, 'prince'? You are the ruler of the swamp; you are rotten to your core. Return to the woods, swim amongst the cattails and leap from stone to lily pad to your heart's content.\n\nThe Princess mounts her horse, which rears into the air, kicking its feet.\n\n+ Princess Arabella (cont'd)\nNever more shall you gaze upon my face each morrow, nor hear my song each night. You deserve all that you have earned -- a wild creature cannot become a king, no matter how he lies and steals. He will always be an animal, unless he is willing to change.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nI will change! Give me another chance!\n\n+ Narrator\nThe Frog-Prince begged, tears falling down his face. But the Princess was clever, and could see through his lies with ease. He felt no guilt, only fear.\n\n+ Frog-Prince\nDo not leave me alone in my swamp! You broke my curse, princess -- and only true love's kiss can break the spell. You are my true love, Arabella. You made me into the prince I am.\n\n+ Princess Arabella\nYour curse was never broken--\n\n+ Narrator\nPrincess Arabella yelled, scorn in her heart.\n\n+ Princess Arabella\nYou were always a frog, never a man. I am not your true love, and I never was. For my true love would understand me, and would have allowed me to live -- goodbye, Frog-Prince. I hope I never see you again.\n\nPrincess Arabella rides down the hill, disappearing. The Frog-Prince croaks, neck bulging out, as he falls to the ground, croaking and crying.\n\n+ Narrator\nAnd then the frog, who was once a prince, found himself alone once more.\n\nThe curtains draw shut.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Pseudogenesis_Logo_Flatter.png\n> **Name:** Pseudogenesis Logo\n> **Author:** [[*user Queerious]]\n> **License:** cc-by-sa 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** Vhs_Glitch-cropped-flipped.gif\n> **Name:** Language of fourier strings.\n> **Author:** Roͬͬ͠͠͡͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠sͬͬ͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠͠aͬͬ͠͠͠͠͠͠͠ Menkman\n> **License:** cc-by 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/r00s/6974122193/\n> **Notes:** Image was cropped and edited by me, [[*user Queerious]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
