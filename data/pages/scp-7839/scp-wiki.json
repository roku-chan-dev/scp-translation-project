Access to specific instances of SCP-7839 may be approved by the Research Head.  \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=kutuzov.jpg| caption=Ivan Kutuzov, sketched posthumously in 1866.\n| width=50%]]\nSCP-7839 refers to a collection of poetry and short-form prose written by Ivan Kutuzov during the early 19th Century. The Foundation has access to 312 works that exhibit anomalous properties, the majority of which were retrieved from a secret compartment within a small camp near Achinsk, Russia. SCP-7839 instances have an intrinsic memetic effect. Any individual who reads an SCP-7839 instance will report immediate, vivid, and potent hallucinations. The contents of these hallucinations depend on the exact instance read and remain relatively consistent between witnesses.  \n\nIf the text of an SCP-7839 instance is copied, it will not develop any anomalous effects. Nonetheless, several SCP-7839 instances have multiple duplicate pages which show consistent effects, indicating that SCP-7839 instances were produced intentionally.\n\nHistorical records indicate that Ivan Kutusov was born in April 1793  [[footnote]] All dates in this article are written in Old Style (pre-Calendar Reform) to accord with related documentation [[/footnote]] in Voronezh, Russia. Kutusov became involved with the Russian Anart community from an early age. Kutusov was a veteran of the French Invasion of Russia and was wounded in the Battle of Shevardino in August 1812. Kutusov was dismissed and returned to Voronezh, where he began producing SCP-7839. Kutusov was a respected member of the local anomalous community, and his poetry was widely circulated in the 1820s. In 1821, Kutuzov was stripped of his Russian Citizenship following increased scrutiny of the Russian anomalous community. He moved to the countryside, only interacting with his family and a network of like-minded writers behind the veil. In July 1826 the Seventh Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery [[footnote]] The \"Seventh Section\" was an Imperial Russian organization dedicated to the suppression of the Russian anomalous community. [[/footnote]]  captured Kutusov and sent him into containment in Achinsk, as part of a broader campaign against the Russian anomalous community. [[footnote]] This campaign began shortly after the Seventh Section's founding in February 1826, in response to reported anomalous involvement in the Decembrist Uprising. [[/footnote]]  Kutusov remained there until his death in 1839.\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n= [[size 120%]] {{ADDENDA}} [[/size]]\n----\n=  **1.

The Lily is universally reported to be illuminated by a ray of sunlight. A group of humanoid figures surround the grave, their faces indiscernible. Readers report that these individuals shake hands, before manifesting shovels and burying the flower. [[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt was snowing the last time I was allowed to see a member of my unit. I was sitting near a little fireplace, listening to the roar of chatter and community in a small Tavern in the city. I wasn't there to drink, not really. Certainly I //was// drinking, but I wasn't there for that. I suppose I had to remind people that, yes, I am real. Yes, I exist. I knew they would not believe that for long.\n\nI pulled a folded piece of paper from my coat and wrote out a few lines of poetry, before downing a shot of vodka and asking for another. The bar was cacophonous, but in a way that was comforting. I often remember riding home on horseback, shoulders bandaged, drained by war. The worst thing about it was the silence. In silence, all I can hear is the drumming. A permanent marching band of cannon fire filling my head, whizzing through my brain.\n\n\"Ivan!\" someone said. I looked up.\n\n\"Ah, Vladimir! It's good to see you.\" I replied, hugging the young, disheveled man in front of me. I remembered Vladimir Kamensky as a bright youth, witty and funny. He was only sixteen when he fought in the Patriotic War. He served with me at Shevardino. I met him again in 1813, at his brother's funeral. He had been struck by grapeshot at Dresden. Some people just got unlucky, I suppose. The years had not looked on Kamensky kindly.\n\n\"I didn't expect to see you here.\"\n\n\"Nor did I, what brings you to Voronezh?\" I replied.\n\n\"Oh, you know how it is. Won't get far as a farmer.\" He gestured to the bartender, ordering another shot of Vodka. He gulped some of it down, coughing. \"Woah, Strong stuff. Anyway, how's it going?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know, the usual.\" I lied. I remembered the soldier at my door, steel blade glinting in the sun. I imagined myself in a pit, their steel shovels glinting in the sun. \"Writing, I guess.\"\n\n\"More Politics?\" He laughed, but I almost cried. I took another sip of Vodka.\n\n\"Yeah, more politics. I guess that's all you can write about these days. I probably sound pretty grouchy while doing it.\"\n\n\"A bit pessimistic, maybe. Where's the Ivan of 1812, so hopeful that he would make the world a better place?\"\n\n\"He died at Shevardino. Tsar Alexander digs his grave.\"\n\n\"Come on, you //did// make the world a better place. I - we spent our entire lives with Europe at war. //We// brought Europe peace.\" And what a peace it was. I felt the echoes of gunfire in my ears. I remembered coming back to empty homes. I remembered standing at a store, imagining the clerk in a French uniform, trying not to run and cry. I remembered the drumming. I remembered wishing I could go back to Shevardino, where everything was simple, where we were all //Russian,// and //they//were all enemies.  \n\n\"And how is peace working out for you?\" I asked, my voice breaking as I spoke. I imagined the room growing darker, soil falling on my face. Vladimir shifted in his seat.\n\n\"I - I need to go. I'm meeting someone.\" He hugged me. And then he left. And that was it.\n\nI returned home, seeing the soldier in front of my door again. I caught his eyes, resigned and despondent. I felt as if I was being buried alive. But I could not climb. After all, it is the right of Kings to bury the beautiful.  \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document-main\"]]\n[[div]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :###E8C9B7; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Title:** //Kak polnost'yu unichtozhit' cheloveka// (How to Completely Destroy a Person)\n**Date:** July 1833\n**Effects:** Readers report an approaching figure in the corner of their vision.
