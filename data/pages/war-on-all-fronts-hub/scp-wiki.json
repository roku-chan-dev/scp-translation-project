I was on the beachfront, and the kraken surged out of the water, crashing into the city itself. From where I was standing at the time it felt like the whole world was about to end.\n\nI'd never seen anything like, and I still haven't to this day. That thing was practically ripped from a kaiju movie, hundreds of feet tall and absolutely monstrous. You ever seen anything else with both arms and tentacles, not to mention five of each? I didn't think so.\n\nThat thing destroyed Hy-Brasil. Yeah, I know that it didn't actually do too much to the city, but it crippled the city to the point where it'd never get better. I've stayed behind because I can't imagine leaving, but this city hasn't been the same since the attack.\n\nHell, that's not even counting all of the fallout and complications resulting from the event. I still see MC&D churning out ads to sell the caviar they ripped from the squid twenty years later. Twenty years! And from what I hear, they've got enough stock left over to last them another twenty.\n\nIt makes sense, I suppose. Hy-Brasil practically //was// the anomalous community at the time, and everybody who was living here at the time felt its impact. It's not really odd that everybody who lived here would try to make something out of it, and get the most out of an awful situation like that.\n\nI'm not sure if we'll ever stop talking about it.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 75%]]//-Testimony from Fodla ingen Ernmas, lifelong Hy-Brasil resident, 2008//[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"woaf-holder\" style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\nA previously unknown anomalous entity, now known by many names:\n\nLTE-0851-Cetus.

In the aftermath, the island was left ruined and desolate.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. The fallout and the aftermath of this event still continues to this day. Powerful groups attempted to exploit the events of that day, bending what happened to their own myth.

The more absurd you make it, the more over the top it is, the better. This is a canon about giant monsters running around and destroying cities.\n\nThe primary focus of the canon is on one giant monster: the crocosquid. In 1988, this kaiju showed up -- seemingly out of nowhere -- and then destroyed a mythical fairy island, turning it into ruin. This island was a center of the anomalous world, and almost every group tried to get in at the fallout of the event, or exploit the tragedy in some fashion.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that unlike some canons, War on All Fronts has a number of separate subcanons within it. There are three primary timelines within War on All Fronts, each of which is considered just as canon as any of the others:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote academics\" style=\"background: rgb(245,245,245)\"]]\n+ Academics\n\nIn the Academics timeline, nothing further goes wrong. Various groups do things relating to the crocosquid, but nothing really happens of note. Life goes on, and the world is fine. It does not end. Various groups keep messing around with the crocosquid. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote doom\" style=\"background: rgb(245,245,245)\"]]\n+ APOCALYPSE\n\nIn the Apocalypse timeline, the Foundation keeps poking around at the origins of the crocosquid, until they accidentally break into the universe it came from. As a result, thousands of new crocosquids burst out of a portal and cause the world to flood. They quickly take over the world and destroy everything, leaving little left once they are done. Notably, Academics has some contact with this timeline through interdimensional portals.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote anastasis\" style=\"background: rgb(245,245,245)\"]]\n+ AnAstAsis\n\nIn the Anastasis timeline, Prometheus Labs attempts to bring the crocosquid back to life with advanced cybernetics and thaumaturgy. Unfortunately for them, the rituals used to do this accidentally awaken kaiju all over the globe, of various types. The world is rampaged by these monsters, which destroy everything.\n[[/div]]\n\nIn addition to these three main timelines, there are also a small number of additional timelines, which only contain a few articles. These, likewise, are considered just as canon as any other, including the main three. Because they are normally just a single or pair of articles, these timelines are listed in the \"Alternates\" section, which is not one timeline but a catch-all for any extra timelines. The articles in that section are disconnected from each other, and from the rest of the timelines.\n\nA few articles in the Alternates section (and the Amore section) reference the \"Archives Timeline\". This is the [[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives]]] Canon. The Academics timeline is canon to 120A; this is not necessarily reciprocal.\n\nThe \"Amore\" section represents another group of catch-all timelines. These articles were all entries into the 2023 [[[RomCon]]] and are listed together for clarity.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Glossary]]\n+ Terms\n\nThe following is a brief overview of various groups, locations, people and things that appear and are centered in the canon. Characters and groups known from outside of this canon are not listed.\n\n**Behemoth:** An ancient group of giant monsters, which invaded Earth and fought to the death in the ancient past. Of these, only the Serpent -- which would go onto to found the Wanderer's Library -- survived. In the Anastasis timeline, the crocosquid ascends to the power of a Behemoth.\n\n**Casaba-Howitzer:** A shaped nuclear charge. An experimental weapon used in Hy-Brasil to fight against the crocosquid, which obliterated a large amount of Hy-Brasil in the process. Less collateral than a traditional nuclear blast, but still massive. More powerful than expected.\n\n**Crocosquid:** The central monster of the canon. Three hundred feet tall, with five arms, five tentacles and five eyes. It is a rough blend of a crocodile at the front and a squid in the back. It can breathe fire. It might be associated with Fifthism, either originally or artificially. \n\n**DelbÃ¡eth II:** Current High King of Hy-Brasil. Ascended to the throne after the death of his uncle, Nuada AirgetlÃ¡m and the favored heir. Trying to restore the glory of Hy-Brasil after the destruction.\n\n**Dr. S. Mann:** An ICSUT marine biologist and wizard. Performed an autopsy on the crocosquid in the Academics timeline and analyzed it. Memories later stolen by O5-10, and has no memory of the autopsy.\n\n**Elan Vital Energy (EVE):** Mystical energy emitted by all living entities. When present in high enough amounts, it can be harnessed to perform magic. Certain entities emit more EVE than others.\n\n**Elliot Watkins:** A UIU agent sent to Hy-Brasil in the immediate aftermath of the 1988 attack to find a UIU contact who had been stationed in the city and assess the damage.\n\n**Emile Metcalfe:** Researcher stationed at Site-03 when the crocosquid attacked. Family was killed in the attack. Leading researcher into the field of Fifthism and put on leave as a result. Later brought back to direct research into SCP-5437.\n\n**General Rockefeller:** Global Occult Coalition deployed to Hy-Brasil to kill the crocosquid. Successful, but caused an extreme (and personally unacceptable) amount of collateral damage. Never punished for his actions, but he feels he should have been.\n\n**Hathscorns:** A pair of Neo-Sarkics working with MC&D who attempted to hatch crocosquid eggs into new hatchlings. Attempt was successful, but immediately stopped by Global Occult Coalition.\n\n**Headless & Page Turner:** A pair of Oneiroi dreamers with nonhuman forms. Helped fight off the nightmare kraken which appeared in Oneiroi West, formed by the collective trauma of the original attack.\n\n**Hy-Brasil:** A mythical island inhabited by a race of Irish fairies. Destroyed by the crocosquid in 1988 and never recovered.\n\n**JÃ¤eger Bombers:** MTF Eta-5. A Foundation task force with the duty of killing LSAs. Stationed in an Extradimensional Site and deployed globally when needed.\n\n**KEY:** A Foundation project began after 1988 to create a defense for LSAs. Settled upon creating a large robot to fight LSAs, resulting in SCP-5514.\n\n**Large-Scale Aggressor (LSA):** A generic term used by multiple groups to refer to giant monsters in a clinical tone.\n\n**MH-Class Scenario:** \"Large-Scale Aggressor Overrun\". Involving the enslavement, reduction, or destruction of human life by an extreme number of Large-Scale Aggressors. (Large amount of kaiju appear on earth and trample everything to death.)\n\n**Mikasa Kaori:** Leading Foundation researcher in the study of LSAs. Led Foundation response to MH-Class Scenario in the Anastasis Timeline.\n\n**Nuada AirgetlÃ¡m VII:** High King of Hy-Brasil. Ascended to the throne in 1810 and died in the crocosquid attack in 1988. Wanted gold and glory, but these dreams were cut short.\n\n**Perseus Rosales:** Captain of Mobile Task Force Eta-5 (\"JÃ¤eger Bombers\"), which is tasked with eliminating LSAs. Responsible for piloting SCP-5514.\n\n**Sergey Dragonov:** A low level Soviet pencil pusher tasked with shuttering projects and firing people. Uses form letters.\n\n**Site-03:** A Foundation site on Nx-03. Had a lax approach to anomalies and was one of the few public facing Foundation sites. Damaged, but not destroyed, in the 1988 attack, and heavily shifted purpose following.\n\n**Southern Baptist Fifthist Church:** A syncretism of Fifthism and Christianity operating in Pensacola. Has an uncomfortably high following. Willing gives themselves over to an army of crocosquids in the Apocalypse timeline.\n\n**Stanislav Nikolaev:** A Russian xenobiologist specializing in the creation of monsters. Formerly worked for the GRU-P until their dissolution, and then Prometheus Labs. In the Anastasis timeline, is responsible for the revival of the crocosquid.\n\n**Tuatha DÃ© Danann:** Irish, elvish, fae. Very similar to baseline humans, with a few minor differences. All are reality benders. Had previously inhabited the mainland of Ireland before a retreat to Hy-Brasil in 1468. After the fall of Hy-Brasil, a small number remain on Hy-Brasil, but most disperse to other places worldwide.\n\n**Visini:** A Foundation Doctor stationed at Site-03 in 1988. Survived the attack. Either disappears to a Fifthist anomaly or leads a doomed project to break into investigate the crocosquid's origins.\n\n----\n\n+ Crocosquid Names\nOne of the \"things\" about this canon is that every different faction has their own name for the crocosquid. Any of these terms refers to the crocosquid.\n\nNote that this was not a good idea, and is being lessened in recent attempts at writing for the canon.\n\n: **Crocosquid** : Out of universe, generic civilians. Favored name.\n: **UAE-Brasil-78** : Foundation in the Academics and Apocalypse Timelines\n: **LSA-Brasil-01** : Foundation in the Anastasis Timeline\n: **LTE-0851-Cetus** : Formal Global Occult Coalition\n: **Crocodilian Kraken** : Informal Global Occult Coalition\n: **The Kraken** : Hy-Brasil residents.\n: **Colossal Aquamorph Entity** : Marshall, Carter and Dark\n: **Dread Behemoth** : Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting\n: **ð’€­ð’‹¾ð’Š©ð’†³/Tiamat** : Oneiroi West Dreamers\n: **Squid Ispolin** : GRU Division Psychotronics\n: **Reptilic Cephalopod** : FBI Unusual Incidents Unit\n: **//Crocoteuthis gigantis//** : Prometheus Labs\n: **The angel / the fivesquid** : Fifthists\n: **//Tokage-tako//** : IJAMEA\n: **Quin Krake** : Serpent's Hand\n: **Plokamisuchus** : International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology\n: **Nessie/tentacoolmon**: Gamers Against Weed\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab How To Contribute]]\nWhile the obvious content material of the canon is around a giant monster, the themes of the canon are a bit more philosophical. War on All Fronts is centered around legacy, the aftermath and fallout of events, and the unexpected consequences of our actions. Some examples:\n\n* Nx-03 is about the legacy of the kings of Hy-Brasil, and how Nuada's is stolen from him.\n* LTE-0851-Cetus prominently features the fallout from the deployment of a dangerous weapon.\n* Kaiju Caviar features the consequences of Carter being an idiot.\n* Restless Dreams is how events linger in the public conscious long after they have passed.\n* SCP-3741 has a smaller scale, but has the immediate consequences of stealing memories.\n* The entire Apocalypse Arc is about the fallout from a failed Foundation project.\n\nThere is a canon theme to use, which comes in both a [[[theme:war-on-all-fronts-sigma|Sigma-9]]] and [[[theme:war-on-all-fronts-bhl|Black Highlighter]]] version.\n\nThe canon was originally conceived as an attempt to blend every GoI article into a single, cohesive storyline. This idea was somewhat abandoned, but we had plans for every GoI to get involved. A good place to start, if you want to write an article, is working a new GoI into the article.\n\n[[*user stormbreath]] is in charge of the canon, and I'm active on both IRC and wikidot PMs. If you have any questions, shoot me a PM and I'll get back to you and answer any questions you might have about the canon.
