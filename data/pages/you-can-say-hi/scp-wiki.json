They were a plentiful workforce, plastic enough to be turned into counter-psychics with some targeted lobotomy, and more than willing to place themselves in the caring hands of Uncle Sam. Most importantly, higher-ups believed even the most devoted Russian agents wouldn’t dare lay hands on schoolchildren. \n\nUnfortunately, none of them considered the inverse might also be true.\n\nTom Rosenbloom was the program’s first success. A bright-eyed eleven year old with an interest in dinosaurs and better marksmanship than most of the FBI, he was covertly moved into an apartment above an Italian restaurant suspected to facilitate GRU dead drops. Two months afterwards, he was given the kill order and a Beretta hidden in his T-rex lunchbox.\n\nHis handlers had planned for many contingencies. Heart attack induced by his psychotropic regimen. Demonic possession, classes A-I to VII. Remembering he used to have parents.\n\nNone of them anticipated a tearful confrontation with the elderly telepath-slash-line cook over veal parmigiana, his impromptu adoption, and subsequent defection to Russia within the month. \n\nClearly, they had made a mistake somewhere down the line. The scientists looked over the reports, reviewed their methodology, and came to the conclusion that their problem was the children being conscious.\n\nThey only managed to fix that issue half a year before their funding was cut for good. Over the next decade, they released three of their remaining candidates back into the general population after thorough deconditioning. After all of them ended up having higher killcounts as freshmen than assassins, the fourth and final subject was instead transferred to an organisation that would be able to handle her.\n\nLittle Chessaline Broad was fifteen years old when she was placed into containment. She was thirty-nine by the time she left.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Excerpt from Release Form A233-91: Anomalous Personnel Application Form**\n\n__Current Designation:__ SCP-2370-ARC\n\n__Prospective Position:__ Archival Department, Armsmaster and Security\n\n__Character Witness:__ Dr. Adileh Khayyam, Psychology Department\n\n__Why do you want this position?

The Foundation is at the head of the pack in terms of psychotropic pharmacology. Our newest formulation of Class-A amnestics is, frankly, a miracle drug: they are the safest, cleanest method of targeted memory removal known to mankind, and in 40% of cases, they still don’t fully take.\n\nThe subconscious holds on to what the conscious lets go. Hard memories of a monster next door become impossibly vivid nightmares; waking up bolt upright in the dead of night; the certain, terrible knowledge that there is //something// out to get you, and you have no idea what it was. And these are the side effects of a substance we’ve spent half a century perfecting, with the help of the greatest minds in biochemistry.\n\nNow imagine what an organisation with none of the expertise nor moral scruples of the Foundation was using—on //children//, no less—thirty years ago. \n\nWhatever you’re picturing, it was much, much worse. \n\nI’ve read the initial biopsy reports. When we took her in, 2370’s heart was pumping equal parts kratom tea and blood. \n\nBy all rights she should resemble a late-stage rabies patient. Instead, in the year I’ve spent with her, 2370 has revealed herself to simply be a shy, anxious woman—one with a sleep condition and aphasia, yes, but in temperament no worse than most of the agents I work with on a monthly basis. \n\nWhether that is an indictment of the Foundation’s work conditions, or a compliment towards her progress as a patient, is ultimately up to the reader.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Excerpt from SCP-2370-ARC App. C-6: Field-Readiness Report, 2018-09-16**\n\nAlright, okay, field evaluation. Gonna be honest: do you even need me to fill this out?\n\nI mean, just look at her. She’s built like a monster truck. We took her out to the training grounds and she managed to run a //four minute mile.// That’s twelve whole seconds off the world record, unless you’ve got an anomalous middle-distance runner locked up somewhere. No shit she passes the physical component of the exam.\n\nThen there’s her range performance. Look, I know Command is probably worried about the whole bandana thing in a live fire situation, but couldn’t you just give her- I dunno, some Ray-Bans or something? Alpha-3 got a real life Gauss gun for their designated marksman last year. Surely the big Five could spare a couple hundred to buy their golden girl a pair of blackout goggles.\n\nAnd that’s not even mentioning what she does when she’s in the zone like that. After her first run, I had the range techs set up a wall between her and the target, just to see if the file was bullshitting me. Yeah, I know what the score is. No, that’s not a malfunction. There’s a scan of the grouping in the PDF, you tell me that’s a fluke.\n\nSo, uh, yeah. Maybe don’t send her off to the Mole Rats—she wouldn’t be able to fit through the door to their dorm—but aside from that, top marks all round.\n\nOh, and if she offers to shake your hand? Take it from me: don’t.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Excerpt from SCP-2370-ARC App. C-3: Psychological Evaluation, 2018-03-01**\n\nThe most unusual behaviour 2370 displays is the belief that her hands are sentient, but even this is relatively explainable. I would attribute this firstly to the circumstances of her anomaly: as a twelve year-old girl, how do you explain the fact that you lose motor control if your eyes are closed? More importantly, how do you explain your ability to wield a gun you don’t consciously know how to use?\n\nHer answer was anthropomorphism. It’s a fairly mundane response to the unpredictable, and one that children and adults alike engage in. Chances are you’ve seen this done with computers: people talk to them when they’re acting up, even if they (usually) aren’t able to understand their instructions or respond to them. \n\nUnderstandably, the average reader probably thinks of their limbs in a different way to their workstations. The average reader, of course, was also not indoctrinated as a child assassin. Combine the effects of her anomaly with a half-lethal cocktail of psychotropics and the depersonalisation that comes with childhood violence, and you begin to understand why she might have started engaging in this behaviour.\n\nGranted, 2370 isn’t eleven years old anymore. I confess, I’m still unsure whether this is an affectation preserved out of habit or a genuine belief; in either case, though, it’s not something I believe would cause problems further down the line. \n\nNow what happens when she does fall asleep: that is something which merits concern.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Excerpt from SCP-2370-ARC App. A: Pentagram Documentation of Subject**\n\n__Dr. Jacobi:__ You know who this is, don’t you?
