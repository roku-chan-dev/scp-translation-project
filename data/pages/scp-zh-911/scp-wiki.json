Should Object actively attempts communication with Supervisors on duty, response is to comply with [RESPONSE PROTOCOL 978].##\n\n##6A6AFF|Due to the anomalous effect of Object, details for containment is to be referred to Paragraph 2 in Census Report from United States Census Bureau included in this file.##\n\n**[[span style=\"font-size:110% ;font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;\"]]Description: SCP-ZH-911 possesses complete citizenship of United States of America, i.e. SCP-ZH-911 possesses freedom of religion, speech, the press, assembly, movement, participation in military and political service, as well as obligation to declare taxes annually and presenting U.S. Passport when accessing U.S. Customs.[[/span]]**\n\n##6A6AFF|**Federal Law Interpretation:** Object is a M4A1 Carbine assault rifle, manufactured in 20██ by Colt's Manufacturing Company under Model number 921. Multiple privately procured components are found on the prototype base gun, while no anomalous effects are found in the components, magazine and ammunition inside. Inscription of \"PROPERTY OF U.S. GOVT.\" is found on the receiver, but Object is not possessed by the U.S. Government. See Remark ZH-911 for details.##\n\n--Based on year of manufacture, SCP-ZH-911 is currently in adolescence, with custody assigned to Foundation according to U.S. Federal Judiciary Verdict, due to absence of any biological relatives and custodians.--\n\n**[[span style=\"font-size:110% ;font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;\"]]Currently, SCP-ZH-911 has reached legal age, and eligible to serve as civil servant, be elected to be mayor or governor, serve military, as well as rights to be protected and supported by U.S. Embassy when in foreign countries.[[/span]]**\n\n**[[span style=\"font-size:110% ;font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;\"]]SCP-ZH-911 volunteered to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps in the past, but was discharged during training due to health reason. Then, SCP-ZH-911 joined the anti-war rally in ████████████, and applied for welfare of psychotherapy due to severe ostracization from the organization. SCP-ZH-911 purported to be a member of Democratic Party, but with no recognition from the Party.[[/span]]**\n\n**[[span style=\"font-size:110% ;font-family: 'Noto Sans', sans-serif;\"]]During Foundation custody, SCP-ZH-911 received diagnosis from medical professionals, and determined suffering from Post-Trauma Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to past experiences. Subsequently, SCP-ZH-911 completed renaming procedure in United States Social Security Administration.[[/span]]**\n\n##6A6AFF|**Census Report from United States Census Bureau:** SCP-ZH-911 possesses self consciousness, and is capable of standing using the flat bottom surface of its stock, as well as slow and unstable locomotion by alternating pivots with two corners of the stock base. Object is capable of localized reality-bending, causing the illusion of SCP-ZH-911 being a U.S. citizen for any human aware of SCP-ZH-911, while weakening their actual impression towards Object itself. Usually, affected humans would ultimately perceive Object as \"a middle-aged man with personality and characteristics of a gun\". Currently, Foundation plays the role of custodians for Object, in order to convince Object to be a PTSD patient with the Containment Procedures as therapy, as well as SCP-ZH-911 being its current proper name.##\n\n##6A6AFF|For any form of textual description of Object, the marginal effect of reality-bending from Object often lead to inconsistencies between output text and its intended input. After trials in several approaches, Management Team discovered a simple workaround through changes in titles, but the original content of the Containment File still requires a \"Simple\" and \"Easily Readable\" declaration of human rights. Such declarations are to be output in bigger and more visible font, and precede any content.##\n\n###0080FF|Note of Update for Novice Personnel: If the content of declaration is concise enough, and sufficient to express meaning to promote human rights ideology, such directed content can be minimized depending on the layout, in order to ensure tidiness of file format.##\n\n###0080FF|Comment from Management: Simply put, it will be satisfied as long as it sees what it wants to see. Unaffected audio file corresponding to this file is also attached in the folder of the main file. (Dr. Thomasius, Containment Platform Correspondent, 4/B)##\n\n**Addendum|2020████-6：**\n\n>\n> During U.S. Presidential Election in 2020, SCP-ZH-911 voiced support for Joe Biden, citing the right to vote for patients under custody. Due to its influences leading to anomalous resonance across other containment chambers, Containment Platform Correspondent Dr. Thomasius advised Site-ZH-50 Command to hold a mock in-site Election Procedure, in order to ensure security of Object.\n> \n> Even with complete control of Foundation over the election setting, on-site Personnel placed a mock ballot in the empty containment chamber opposite to location of containment, and opened the safety vault of the containment chamber under surveillance. SCP-ZH-911 did not leave its containment chamber nor enter another chamber, and cited to Supervisors that void voting is also an exercise of freedom.\n>> That's odd. It could go across the globe for its own freedom, but too lazy to go across the room to vote?[[footnote]] //A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy, but won't cross the street to vote in a national election.// -- [https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/bill-vaughan-quotes William E.
