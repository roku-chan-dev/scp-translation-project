Eyewitness reports confirm 3528-Black and its forces emerged from the Ojos del Salado stratovolcano in the Andes, and have been steadily marching north. Volcanic eruptions have emerged along their path, causing heavy civilian casualties.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n**__Sequence P23–86**\n**T: 12:28 | D: NOV-03__**\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The Latin Chapter of the Knights Templar:** hope to god this thing's still working.\n\nOjos erupted about six hours ago, and things have been steadily getting more fucked ever since. The lava streams or whatever they're called wiped out most of the population on the Chilean side, so we're looking at tens of thousands of fatalities already, which will get worse with the volcanic winter- Assuming we make it that far. I've got no idea how things are on the Argentine side, but it's probably the same.\n\nAnd to top it all off, we have an army of fire jötunn marching north to deal with, along with all the other godly shit running loose in Latin America. Anyone out there?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The Hermatic Order of the Golden Dawn** is currently disconnected.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The Ordo Templi Orientis** is currently disconnected.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The World Parahealth Organization** is currently disconnected.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The Latin Chapter of the Knights Templar:** Well, fuck.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology:** Oh thank god this thing's still working. All our other communications have been swamped.

We have a few days at best before our backup generators fail, and that's if we don't starve to death first. Rations are running dangerously low. What happened to you guys? I thought [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4918|Arthur and Fionn]]] were keeping things straight.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #efefff;\"]]\n**The International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology:** They were, but even heroes can't do anything against a tidal wave.
