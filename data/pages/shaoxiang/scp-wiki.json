Considering that it's a bit of a hassle to search for these artworks on each contest page individually, I'm taking advantage of the end of the year to fill in the gaps in this year's personal art posting by creating an artwork page dedicated to the banners I've drawn... Anyway, happy viewing, my friend.\n> @@@@\n> @@@@\n> @@@@\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n[[=]]\n+ 2021 Summer Contest: Look-And-Write (II)\n[[size 120%]]\n----\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:drstse/kantu.jpg]]\n@@@@\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:drstse/2021contestsummer.jpg]]\n\n> Write a story based on the picture.

Either you are caught unawares, or it is carefully disguised, or you take the bait of your own free will. Or it's a poorly constructed trap, a hidden door that no one cares about; or it's an abandoned pit with a few bloodstains on rotting wooden spikes. What traps will your pen weave?\n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n+ 2023 Winter Contest: Foundation Self-Rescue Guide\n[[size 120%]]\n----\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:drstse/基金会冬季竞赛（基金会自救指南）版图.jpg]]\n@@@@\n[[=image http://05command-cn.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Awinter-contest-2022/winter-contest-2023.jpg]]\n> You have to have some skill to survive, right?

For the Foundation, which deals with unknown anomalies on a daily basis, curiosity comes with a layer of cautious armor. But the truth is, a black box isn't always black. It may not be a box at all - a few suspicious personnel transfers, the eerie smile of a certain O5, an unusually loud noise on the site... or even something that is unfolding in broad daylight, with every piece of the puzzle transparent and shiny, but still giving the impression that something is wrong. So what is your \"black box\"?\n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]\n+ SCP-CN-3000\n+ \"Miracle / Fate\" Contest\n----\n[[image http://05command-cn.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:scpcn3000contesthub/SCP-CN-3000%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5%E5%9B%BE link=\"/scpcn3000contesthub\" width=\"auto\"]]\n@@@@\n[[=image http://05command-cn.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:scpcn3000contesthub/SCP-CN-3000%E9%A2%98%E5%9B%BE]]\n[[/size]]\n[[size 120%]]\n\n> From where it all started with SCP-173 being posted to 4chan, no one thought this group called \"the SCP Foundation\" would last until today.\n> From Tieba to the old forum, and then to Wikidot, no one dared to declare that the Chinese Branch could develop all the way to SCP-CN-3000, with the most articles of any foreign branch.\n> To our past selves, the fact that all this happened would seem like a **miracle**, but looking back, every step taken by the Foundation is already its **fate**.\n> Standing at the intersection of miracles and fate, we invite all SCP fans to light their sparks and tell us what \"miracles\" and \"fate\" really mean.\n\n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@",
