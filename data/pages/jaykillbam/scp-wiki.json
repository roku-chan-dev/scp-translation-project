While he did make some attempts early on to move up the ranks without feedback from his peers, JayKillbam soon realized the necessity of community within the Organization. JayKillbam made his first foray into Foundation graces with CupidCon submission [[[stardust| Stardust]]]. Other research soon followed. Now an active member of Site-19, JayKillbam contributes in his limited capacity to Anomalous Research.\n\nAs of July 2021, JayKillbam has been given the opportunity to work alongside MAST in the tagging department as Junior Staff.\n\nAs of September 2022, JayKillbam has stepped down form MAST duties due to negligible contributions and low activity.  He was thankful for his chance to assist, but continues to focus on research.  \n\nAs of August 2024, Researcher Jaykillbam is considered AWOL, due to his lack of communication with the Foundation. Current investigation as well as speculation has revealed that Jaykillbam may be creating his own alternate timeline using ulterior methods. Extant data can be gleaned by what is found in the researcher’s Lab. \n\n**Education:**\nBachelor’s in Music Composition\nTrained Somaliër  \nMaster Mixologist\nArm Chair Physicist \nTenured Psychonaut\nMemelord\n\n**Personal Activities:**\nIn his off time, away from Foundation related experiments, JayKillbam moonlights as a luxury hotel bar manager. He enjoys watching Youtube. JayKillbam also is known to have a small addiction to dry-aged steaks and indulges in this pastime every chance he gets. He has a cat named “Lil’ Man”.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\n\n= SCP OVERVIEW\n||= **File** ||= **Name** ||= **Summary** ||\n|| [[[SCP-5318|SCP-5318]]] || Los Ojos de Mi Padre || A story of Love, Loss, & LSD. ||\n|| [[[SCP-6711|SCP-6711]]] || Only Time Will Tell || One man against the forces of time, propelled far into the future. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5853|SCP-5853]]] || Ticky Taffy Town || What your children watch may take them. || \n|| [[[SCP-7622|SCP-7622]]] || Alcoholics Anomalous || A  Reality Bender must suppress his abilities by maintaining his alcoholism. || \n|| [[[SCP-7029|SCP-7029]]] || 7029 || A compost challenge about a door that is hard to open as an allegory for unrequited love. || \n|| [[[SCP-7098|SCP-7098]]] || A stupid ScP || A near -J that causes staff that write about it lose all writing skill. ||\n\n\n= SCP-DATA\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"jaykillbam\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"scp, -joke\" perPage=\"10\" order=\"created_at\" prependLine=\"||~ SCP ||~ Created ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Length ||\"]] \n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_at%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%%  || %%size%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab TALES]]\n= TALE OVERVIEW\n||= **Name** ||= **Summary** ||\n|| [[[Stardust|Stardust]]] || Two celestial bodes fall in love in a club, but one is holding something  back. ||\n|| [[[What We Know So Far: Answering the Question of What, How, and Why; Green-Types|What We Know So Far: Answering the Question of What, How, and Why; Green-Types]]] || A scientific research paper looking to understand the way in which Reality Benders function. ||\n|| [[[Personnel Spotlight Site-19 F&B Director|Personnel Spotlight Site-19 F&B Director]]] || An interview with the man who ensures staff and anomalies alike get fed. ||\n\n= TALE-DATA\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"jaykillbam\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"tale\" perPage=\"10\" order=\"created_at\" prependLine=\"||~ SCP ||~ Created ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Length ||\"]] \n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_at%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%%  || %%size%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab WORKS IN PROGRESS]]\n= **For Most Recent Lab Work Please Consult:**\n= [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/jaykillbam| JayKillbam's Lab]\n\n= \n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Future Projects]]\n[[<]]\n**The Eyes Of God**\nA painting that drives people insane, painted in blood, and a large investigation. \n\n**The Event at Summerwood Lake**\nA girl summons a plague upon a park as revenge. \n\n**Left Turn**\nA liberal car that has alignment issues and always steers left.\n\n**The Island:** A WL entry about a man who takes a short vacation to a summer island in the dead of winter, while consuming hallucinogenics he gets in way over his head when he starts asking locals about island folklore.\n[[=]]\n__Found here:__ [http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-island-chapter-1| The Island Chapter 1]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
