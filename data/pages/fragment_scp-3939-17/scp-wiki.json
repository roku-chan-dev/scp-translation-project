It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYou open your door and crane your head into the corridor. Just as you suspected, Sally is still waiting outside. She's leaning against the wall next to your office. She snaps to attention as soon as she sees you.\n\n\"Have you been waiting here since you left?\" you ask her.\n\n\"I... uh, yes, I have.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. Would you like to come help me look at 3939?\"\n\n\"Are you, like, telling me to, as my boss? Or are you asking me?\"\n\n\"I am telling you, yeah.\"\n\nShe shrugs. \"I can't argue with that. What do you need me to do?\"\n\n\"I need you to go down to 39-PC01-C and write up a decent description for the object.\"\n\nShe seems a little shocked, but she's trying not to show it. \"You're not coming with me?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Um... okay. I'll report back later.\"\n\nYou retreat into your office as she scuttles away into the labyrinth of corridors. You sit down at your desk.\n\nIt doesn't take five minutes before your communicator buzzes. You withdraw it from your pocket and take a look.\n\n> **3939-Beta:** its moving\n\nYou sit up straight.\n\n> **3939-Beta:** it keeps rotating\n> \n> **3939-Alpha:** It's moving?\n> \n> **3939-Beta:** yeah it keeps turning to look at me\n> \n> **3939-Alpha:** What do you mean? It's a gramophone.\n> \n> **3939-Beta:** im not making this up\n\nYou lean back, close your eyes, and let out a long breath.\n\nDo you believe her?\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/20 Head down to the testing cell to verify for yourself.]\n\n[/scp-3939/offset/52 It doesn't matter. Just write it up.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
