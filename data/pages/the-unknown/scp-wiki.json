There are three things you need to know about **MIRANDA**: she was tall, she was dazzlingly charismatic and she was more stubborn than gravity. Nobody else could even imagine this mission, but she could. They said it was impossible, and she showed them it might not be. They said it could never be made to work, and she put together a plan that showed them how to do it. They said it would be dangerous, and she just laughed.\n> @@ @@\n> **MIRANDA** led this mission before there was a mission. When it came time to assign a team leader, she chose herself. No one had put more into the project, no one knew more about the project. Still, there were those that spoke out against her. \n> \"She's too inexperienced in the field,\" they said.\n> \"She's too valuable to the core unit,\" they said.\n> \"She's too domineering to lead a small team,\" they said. The rumour mill told a different story. It said that if she'd been straighter, more male and less black that she'd have got the job with no resistance. Of course no one was saying //that//, but they were not saying it very pointedly.\n> What do you think she said to that? Not a damn thing. She didn't need to tell them they were wrong. She showed them. They stopped saying that.\n> @@ @@\n> Three months after she got the project signed off everything was ready, faster than any reasonable timeline. There were already plans drawn up for a manned craft and soon we had a shiny new ship in the hanger. We had a fully reconditioned latent-space portal because the second-generation portals had always been designed with manned missions in mind. We had a team: every one of us a volunteer, every one hand-picked from across the Foundation. We weren't the best in our fields but **MIRANDA** saw in us the parts of something more.

All the science gave it a very promising maybe. Electromagnetic waves don't propagate so well out there so once we went through we'd be on our own. **MIRANDA** brought the engines up and eased us through, careful, but confident.\n> @@ @@\n> Things went fine for a while. It was nothing but smooth sailing through empty skies and a deluge of data flowing from the instruments to the databanks. We saw more kinds of nothing than there are words for in any language I know. \n> \n> Then we saw the nullity transition layer closing in around us. If this place had weather, then this would be the storm -- angry nothing whipping around in complex curves and hard, pointed angles. **MIRANDA** dialled up the stabilisation field. It wrapped around us in a gently not-humming aura of thing-ness that kept reality in and everything else out. She pointed our bow straight into the layer and told us to strap in.\n> @@ @@\n> We should have been fine, but we weren't. The layer started seeping through the outer fields in an every-colour fog and the hull began rattling like a castanet. The instruments stopped responding and stayed solidly in the green, ignoring the obvious danger. **MIRANDA** took just a single moment to think about it before turning the ship around and leaving her dream behind. That was one of the things that made her a good leader: she always put people before dreams. She yelled at us to get back into the centre of the ship, nearer to the field generator while she stayed up front to get us lined up on the portal. We left, out of the bridge, back past the crew quarters and into the mess room. We only stopped once we were right in the centre of the ship, above the field generator where its effects were strongest.\n> @@ @@\n> **MIRANDA**'s updates from the cockpit lasted for a little while, crackling to us over the internal comms.

He never did things the easy way if it was the wrong way.\n> @@ @@\n> **DIMO** was careful when he talked too. You can tell that he'd thought about every word before he said it. Some people take fifty words to make their point. **DIMO** didn't. He'd pause and think and then he'd say three words, but they'd be the right words.\n> @@ @@\n> The fog took a while to get back to the mess room, but inch by inch it did. **DIMO** stood in the doorway watching it approach with an unreadable expression and said, \"Not enough time.\" He dialled up the field generator and then paused for a second, thinking. Then he nodded to himself and turned the dial a click farther.\n> @@ @@\n> Fifteen minutes later the lights started flickering and the mist started creeping closer again. **DIMO**'s eyes narrowed and his jaw tightened. He stared down at the floor for a moment and then sighed, shoulders dropping by just the tiniest fraction. \"I'll repair this,\" he said. He left. \n> @@ @@\n> Another fifteen minutes later the lights stabilised and the mist retreated from the edges of the room. We didn't hear from **DIMO** again. Just whispering over the internal comms. Nothing clear, just the shapes of words. \"...my family...\" I think. Then nothing.\n> @@ @@\n> That was **DIMO**.

I never did work out how.\n> @@ @@\n> **ETISHA** figured out what had happened to the others, or at least she said she had and I wasn't nearly clever enough to argue. \"I think they've been subsumed into the local immateria.\" She saw my uncertain look and tried again. \"They're part of all this nothing. They don't exist any more. Maybe they never did now. Or maybe the field is containing what's left of them?\" She stopped speaking and I could see the idea turning in her like a key in a clock.\n> \n> \"So can we get them back?\" I asked. **ETISHA** gave **ME** one of those looks that said she wasn't going to answer soon and when she did I wouldn't understand.\n> @@ @@\n> We got a few hours closer to home before the atmosphere system gave out. The obvious solution was the suits. Problem was, the suits weren't in the mess room with us and everything outside the room was filled with all kinds of nothing. **ETISHA** got creative.
