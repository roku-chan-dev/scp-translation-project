The papers materialize within the affected organization's financial department or relevant administrative area.\n\nSCP-7084 will typically appear within 24 hours following a breach. The manifestation process of SCP-7084 is spontaneous and occurs regardless of the physical location or time of the breach.[[footnote]] Temporal loops and pocket dimensions are also affected. [[/footnote]] The papers resemble standard tax documents, including forms, schedules, and annual statements.\n\nUpon examination, the contents of SCP-7084 appear to be genuine tax-related documents associated with individuals directly affected by the breach.\n\nThe personal details and financial information contained within SCP-7084 are always current and accurately reflect the tax obligations and liabilities of the individuals involved. This includes income statements, deductions, and tax liabilities.\n\nIn the event that SCP-7084 is not filed and submitted following a breach, internal Foundation files will begin to slowly be replaced with instances of SCP-7084, with preference given to files related to taxes, the IRS, SCP-7084 itself, and financial accounts.\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Part II: Nature of Breach:**\n\nIndicate the nature of the containment breach in question.

While searching for information regarding ùê¢5790, several records were found related to ùê¢5790 in the IRS archives. Further research lead to thousands of papers about the SCP Foundation and containment breaches.\n\nRecords indicate that prior to its discovery, personnel have consistently disregarded the anomalous nature of SCP-7084 documents, which have been filed without question since the establishment of the Foundation, unbeknownst to the administration. Since its discovery, SCP-7084 has posed an Amida-Class Disruption to the inner workings of the Foundation.\n\nAfter several years of researching the history of the IRS, many documents related to the SCP Foundation have been uncovered, including the identities of the O5 Council and the Administrator.
