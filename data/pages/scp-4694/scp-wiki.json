All reindoctrination research results should be notified to the Lead Project Parapsychologist.\n\nSCP-4694-L instances (see Figure 1) should be recovered where possible and secured in sight/sound-proof containers at the site most local to recovery. \n\nThere are no plans to contain the Cherished Leaders. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4694 is an emergent para-dimensional phenomena manifesting in this reality as a multi-level marketing company (MLM). \n\nSCP-4694 is characterized by an extreme personality cult built around the “Cherished Leaders,” an as-yet unidentified collective who direct and control members (known as “Associates”) through both mundane peer pressure, cult programming and anomalous positive/negative reinforcement.  \n\nThe primary purpose of mundane MLMs is the generation of revenue through the recruitment of new members. SCP-4694’s primary purpose is unknown, although recovered media and promotional material suggests the importance of belonging and family values.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"> PryMaid Media\" hide=\"Hide PryMaid Media\"]]\n\n##blue|Infomercial:##\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4694/prymaid%20infomercial2.wav\n]]\n\n* Transcript: Female Voiceover: //\"PryMaid: the Generation of Happiness.

A female self-identified as Janey Goodwill is addressing the audience. Zachary turns to take in a panorama shot; there are approximately eight thousand people in the crowd.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** How are you all today? \n> \n> //Cheers from the audience//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Are you making money today? \n> \n> //Cheers from the audience//.\n> \n> **Autoship:** This is amazing! I always //(indistinct)//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Do you know why you're here today? \n> \n> //Many indistinct responses from the audience.//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** You're here because you're winners. You're here because you're PryMaid's newest stars - and talking of stars –\n> \n> //The auditorium lights brighten and a large projection screen displays the words \"Is The Sky The Limit? NO SIR!\"//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** A whole load of science tells us that we are born of stars and suns and galaxy dust. We come from the //stars.// Isn't that something? \n> \n> //Audience cheers and claps.//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Where do we come from? \n> \n> //Audience responds with shouts of \"We come from the stars!\"//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Everything, from the tiniest flea to the biggest whale, comes from the stars. There are so many exciting business opportunities right now!\n> \n> //Audience claps and cheers. The screen displays the phrase \"All Life Is The Same.\"//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** All life is the same. All life is the same. Our message goes out to everybody, and everybody and everything responds to that message. Everybody loves us. If they don’t, they just don’t know it yet.\n> \n> //Applause//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Or…  //(lights dim)// Maybe there are those who really //don’t// love us. They know about belonging, but they //don't// belong. They know about love, but they //don't// love. They. Don't. Love. Do you want someone like that in your life?\n> \n> //Audience boos and catcalls//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Negative  thinkers? Cut them out. Just cut them out. They don't exist. They don't exist. Doesn't matter if it's your husband, your wife, your daughter, your pastor - even Jesus Himself. They will try to drive a wedge between you and PryMaid – between you and everything you //love//, everything you //belong// to, and they will bring you down. They will bring you down. \n> \n> //Audience jeers and catcalls enthusiastically//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** It's so important to fill your life with positivity. Positive people, positive messages - because //negativity// grows like a cancer, like an old man's cancer that spreads from a photograph taken at a wedding reception when he didn't even know he //had// cancer, and it engulfs everything. The people in the photograph, the photograph itself, the photo frame, the mantelpiece it sat on, the arthritic pet dog that moved too slow to escape the metastasis as it overtook the room... And then the walls, the roof... [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2962 The whole house]... Eventually the whole world. Eventually the whole //universe//. All riddled with cancer. All bloating and blossoming and bubbling away. And then who knows where.\n> \n> //Lights dim. The screen displays the message, \"Apostasis - Downlines - Eternity\"//   \n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Positivity is a living thing. And when you lose positivity, it dies. Goes to an awful place, a terrible place, and it dies. If I showed you that place - you would know. You would //know// how important it is to follow our path. \n>  \n> //The screen displays the message, ##red|\"V-SC LC B7-M988-T935-H537 Welcomes New Guests Helena Jeffers, Abeo Akintola and## ##black|//[REDACTED]//####red|\"##//\n> \n> **Autoship:** That's me! Why's my name up there? I don't -\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** - want that negativity in my life. Do you?\n> \n> //Audience murmurs; words are indistinct//.\n> \n> **Autoship:** What does that mean? Why's my name up there?\n> \n> **Agent Zachary:** Special recognition? Maybe //(indistinct)//.\n> \n> **Autoship:** No. I don't - no, this doesn't feel right. This - can we - I want to go home. I want to go home.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwil:** Truth is, some are already there. \n> \n> **Autoship:** //I want to go home.//\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** You turn away from PryMaid and all bets are off. All bets are off.\n>  \n> **Autoship:** Three point one four one - \n> \n> //For the next ninety six hours Autoship accurately recites Pi to 300,000 places. Janey Goodwill continues to present to the audience (details lost due to noise interference from Autoship). Neither Autoship's behaviour nor the time taken is acknowledged by Goodwill, Zachary or any other attendees at any point. After ninety six hours Autoship's vocalisations cease abruptly.// \n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** //(audio recording becomes clearer)// - but that's why you're here right now. You're here to be recognised. You're here for Recognition Day.\n> \n> //Applause//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** You'll recognise - and be recognised by - other Recognised Associates. Today, you and your descendant/ascendant genetic material contemporaries will be forever bonded with the PryMaid family. It's like carrying a photograph of your wife or husband in your wallet or purse, but it's with you all the time. It's kinda like a secret handshake... But don't just take my word for it... Because… \n> \n> //Audience hushes//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Because... \n> \n> //Audience becomes silent//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Because... I have three very very //very// special guests here right now...  I think it's fair to say I idolise these amazing, caring, generous guys. I think you will too. Thing is, they're kinda shy. Can you do something for me? \n> \n> //Audience cheers//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** I need all cell phones, all cameras, all recording equipment turned off. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't.\n> \n> //Noise as a large number of cell phones are switched off//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Thank you all. Now if you've taken any analgesics today, prescribed or otherwise, please make your way to the back of the auditorium where a designated helper will be able to assist. No exceptions, no excuses. We'll know if you don't.\n> \n> //Noise as a number of the audience move to the back of the auditorium//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** Okay guys...  Are you ready to meet them? \n> \n> //Lights in auditorium start to dim. Audience erupts into applause and cheers//.\n> \n> **Janey Goodwill:** I said (shouting) //are you ready to meet them//? They've come a long, long way to be with us here today. So please, please, please give it up for the Cherished Leaders! Come on, make some noise! Let them know you love them!\n> \n> //Audience responds rapturously, including Agent Zachary//.\n> \n> **##blue|96:56:06##** //All lights in the auditorium switch off.

Today I'd like us to go through a typical day. \n>  \n> **Zachary:** Great. What day is it today?\n> \n> **Dr J Bufirst:** Wednesday. \n> \n> **Zachary:** Yeah, Wednesdays are special. Wednesdays we perform the Family Blessings. \n> \n> **Dr J Bufirst:** Explain it like I’m new.\n> \n> **Zachary:** I call it \"Brand Loyalty.\" Cyndie thinks it's in bad taste but whatever. Wednesdays are like mini Recognition Days but just for us - myself, Cyndie, the kids. We use the basement. I put an icebox in and we were good to go.\n> \n> **Dr Bufirst:** Why the basement?\n> \n> **Zachary:** Easiest to soundproof.\n> \n> **Dr Bufirst:** Soundproof?\n> \n> **Zachary:** The Family Blessings really help us gel as a family – but you don’t get that without a few tears along the way. You know what five year olds are like.\n> \n> **Dr Bufirst:** You mentioned an icebox? \n> \n> **Zachary:** Yeah that’s for //after// the Family Blessings - after we've used the Likenesses.\n> \n> **Dr Bufirst:** I don't follow. How do you - ?\n> \n> **Zachary:** Easiest if I show you.\n> \n> //Zachary stands up and starts to unbutton his shirt.//\n> \n> **Zachary:** We all have the Likenesses in our homes.

A massive prison factory. \n> \n> **Dr Bufirst:** Housing who?\n> \n> **Zachary:** Everybody. Every//thing//. Dead Associates making Likenesses forever. That's where we all go. I saw a girl - I didn't know her, she said her name was [REDACTED]. She said she knew me. I'd never set eyes on her before. She'd been there all her life. Her and her children.

Maybe it'll get reviewed and wiped, maybe it won't.//\n\n//I think - I believe maybe whatever PryMaid is, it's huge. Vast. It spreads its thoughts, its feelers into the aquarium of our reality and taps the glass and watches as we skitter and dart back into the fake plastic seaweed like frightened little fish. And maybe we can leap up and out of one and into the next, but PryMaid are there too.// \n\n//Maybe all the different realities are simply different fishtanks, side by side, some below, some above, some filled with water, some with blood. Some with fire, some with cement. I don't know. But PryMaid - or whatever they manifest as - is in all of them, or above or around them, and the weight of their unreality pushes, pushes down on ours.// \n\n//I think the phone and the cancer anomalies - SCP-2982 and 2962 - hell maybe// all //the anomalies we've ever known - are just signs of SCP-4694 seeping in as all the fishtanks start to crack. And you know what? Sometimes those signs are horrific, blasphemous, soul-destroying; but sometimes they're not.// \n\n//I guess that's the best I can hope for now, because Lisa rang me earlier today and told me I'm going to be a father. And one day my children will have children, and they will become PryMaid Associates and we will all end up in a Learning Camp forever, one big happy family.//\n\n//So I guess I must take my comfort where I can. Take solace as all the Things That Cannot Be come squirming  uninvited into our world and invite us to insanity. Sometimes the signs are horrible, inhuman, grotesque; but sometimes the signs fail in their purpose; sometimes instead of offering horror and grief, they offer compassion. Instead of hate, hope.// \n\n//Sometimes they wipe our faces in their shit; but sometimes, just sometimes, they raise us out of it just long enough to know that our frightful, damaged little human lives are beautiful and noble and undefeatable.//\n\n//That's my hope: that even though the vast majority of the things we see are nightmarish, sometimes they're not.
