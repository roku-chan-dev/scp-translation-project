I have personally looked over his blueprints, and I am convinced that his invention will make us a pretty penny. What kind of car owner doesn't worry about vandals and carjackers, after all? They will pay top dollar for this. _\n _\nHe already has a working prototype. I've seen it myself, it sends thoughts into potential thieves' minds that deter any attempts at stealing. I've met his son Daniel, too. Doesn't seem to have his father around a lot, actually. _\n _\nAnyway, the blueprints should already be in our databases, and the prototype will be delivered to our branch in San Joaquin as soon as possible.||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 02||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Stanley Bernal ||\n||||||||I have received the news that Mr. Thalbrum has passed away, and left his son with the prototype. While the company still has the proper blueprints, our lab boys find it difficult to replicate the Thalbrum security system on their test cars. _\n _\nNevertheless, I've come into contact with the late Thalbrum's son, and he will transfer the prototype to us on July 24 in the parking lot of St. Everetts Memorial Hospital in Laurel Creek. Once we get our hands on this, we can finally make out some price point and demand for the security system. _\n _\nMake sure the car makes it safely to us. Your job depends on it. _\n _\n//-Amos Marshall// _\n _\nP.S. The Thalbrum son will join us as well, since he is now the legal owner.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n------\n||||||||~ Incident Log 01||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R||\n||~ Author || Kaitlyn Cantara ||~ Date || July 24, 2010 ||\n||||||||The transfer of the Thalbrum prototype did not go as planned. Operatives from the Foundation were able to intercept the meeting and take the prototype, as well as Mr. Thalbrum, to an unknown location. The agents involved wore MC&D uniforms in order to fool Mr. Thalbrum into turning over our prototype to the Foundation. _\n _\nStanley Bernal, the former project head, has been let go after this incident. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 05 ||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||\n||||||||Congratulations on your promotion, Mr. Innsbruck. While your accountant figures out how much of your bonus is taxable, I will remind you of your new duties. _\n _\nThe man in your position before you failed to perform a simple task: collect a prototype of a new vehicle security system. Now you must pick up where he left off, at great expense to me, the company, and the man before you, who can live off of food stamps for all I care. _\n _\nThe prototype is a vintage cream-tan Chevrolet sedan, accompanied by a man named Daniel Thalbrum. Both are in the custody of the Foundation, where the prototype will rot and be forgotten about, instead of turning into riches under the wheel of free-market capitalism. Your task is to get that car back by any means necessary. You may ask me for additional resources, but keep in mind that I am an impatient man with immense political power. _\n _\nDo not fail me, or you will join Bernal in the unemployment line. _\n _\n//-Amos Marshall// ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP ||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 08 ||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || William Innsbruck ||~ Recipient || Amos Marshall ||\n||||||||I found it! I found where the Foundation is keeping our prototype! _\n _\nIt's at Site-48 in California. I've already sent the coordinates to you. Daniel is there too. We'll need to break him out as well, since he's the only one who can allow us to drive the prototype out of there. _\n _\nI found out about this through a researcher I had to bribe, and I am happy to report that he has been successfully bought out. His name is Bradson Boudames, if you need to know. He's a great tool to find out the layout of the facility, and may have a direct line to Daniel as well. _\n _\nI must admit that I'm not sure what to do next. We can sneak Daniel and the prototype out through Boudames, but by the way he describes the security, I'm not sure if that's possible without massive resources. If you'd like, I can reach out to some third-party operatives to get the job done. _\n _\nPlease respond quickly, Mr. Marshall. As you said, the prototype is rotting away as we speak. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP ||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 09 ||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || William Innsbruck ||\n||||||||Your eagerness and sleuthing skills do not disappoint me. However, your generosity certainly does. Next time, start off with a smaller bribe amount. These costs add up quickly. _\n _\nAs for the retrieval, do not worry about it. I have forwarded the coordinates to a trusted organization with knowledge on the Foundation's day to day operations. With the right price, they'll retrieve anything, and with the right political leverage, we can even get a nice discount. _\n _\nOnce the prototype arrives, you will be in charge of it, as well as all market research. If something happens to that car, you can kiss your job goodbye. _\n _\n//-Amos Marshall// ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP ||\n------\n||||||||~ Incident Report 02||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Author || Bradson Boudames ||~ Date || September 02, 2010 ||\n|||||||| The prototype has been successfully retrieved from the Foundation and into the possession of Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP. Formerly known as [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3763 SCP-3763], the Chevrolet Biscayne is currently with Daniel Thalbrum, and both are at the San Joaquin branch. Former Foundation doctor Bradson Boudames has also defected from the Foundation, and is offering his employment to Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP. _\n _\nThe operation resulted in zero casualties. Study of the item is to begin immediately.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 10 ||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Bradson Boudames ||\n||||||||Welcome to your new career as a researcher for Marshall, Carter and Dark Limited Liability Partnership. My name is Amos Marshall, and I am your new boss. You will be allowed to converse with me through these memos regarding important updates and information. I understand if this is a culture shock to you, as the Foundation higher-ups do not seem to be as accessible to the average Researcher Joe. _\n _\nWhile we appreciate your defection to our company, I must mention that your former affiliations with the Foundation will bring suspicion from your new coworkers. In order to gain our trust, you must demonstrate high levels of loyalty and gratitude to us whenever you perform research. While the use of Foundation research is a topic we cannot get into at this time, I will remind you that I have my eye on you, and so does Innsbruck. _\n _\nAnyway, congratulations on your new job with us. We have a lot of work to do and a lot of money to make. _\n _\n//-Amos Marshall// _\n _\nP.S.

I know from previous experience that the Foundation __will__ release anomalies if they can figure out how they work. This is known as an \"Explained\" SCP. _\n _\nI propose that we allow the Foundation to look at our item's schematics, so they can find out how it works. If they can understand the item enough to put the little \"-EX\" after the 3763, they will stop bothering us. _\n _\nFrom Boudames _\n _\nP.S: What should we do about Daniel Thalbrum? We don't need him or his car around, and it's always cheaper to let him fend for himself, instead of feeding him and keeping him entertained.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP ||\n------\n||||||||~ Memo 29 ||\n||||||||~ ZLQMK/6XY4R/V4D3R ||\n||~ Sender || William Innsbruck ||~ Recipient || Amos Marshall ||\n||||||||Mr. Marshall, I have bad news. _\n _\nI just got a memo from Boudames suggesting that we should give up our blueprints to the Foundation. He rationalized this by talking about \"explained SCPs\", but I'm worried that giving up our sensitive documents to the Foundation will result in the schematics being leaked to the public. If this happens, we'll lose the market for sure. _\n _\nI regret bribing him and letting him work with us. I should've known he would do something like this. _\n _\nWhat should I do?

You were right to come to me for advice. _\n _\nI looked over his memo myself, and I understand where he is coming from. While not as stubborn and ruthless as the Serpent's Hand, the Foundation will not give up on their quest for answers unless we provide them. That being said, I must agree that turning over the schematics is not the best option. It shouldn't even //be// an option. _\n _\nI will deal with Bradson \"Judas\" Boudames.

My name is Kaitlyn Cantara, but you can call me Kate. I'm the new product manager for these items, personally appointed by Amos Marshall himself. _\n _\nThere will be a few changes to this project. First off, we will be rebranding this item from \"Thalbrum Vehicle Security System\" to the more fitting \"MC&D Premium Vehicle Security System\". This will allow us to distance ourselves from the death of Daniel Thalbrum, and hopefully see sales recover. _\n _\nWhile you may be sad to see Innsbruck go, I must remind how necessary this move is for the health of our public relations. His lack of public empathy towards Thalbrum's death has caused a preventable PR disaster. _\n _\nAnyway, I look forward to working side-to-side with you guys.
