As I understand it, according to [https://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14274488/discussion-celebrating-diversity-on-site#post-5130695 this 05command post] made by Gene R, some countries explicitly have laws against such content appearing anywhere. If you are translating my works, and your country has laws against such stuff, you are free to remove it in order to be able to post translations of these works to your site. This said, if your country does not have a law against such, &/or your country later repeals such laws, I would kindly request you keep these CSS changes in any translation you post, & add the corresponding theme to your site. I cannot force you to, of course, but it would be kindly appreciated. In a similar request, if you come across any instances where I refer to myself as \"they\", \"them\", or \"their\" (either on a hub page, in a discussion post, in an article, etc.), or you wish to refer to me in a post you make, & your language does not have a gender-neutral pronoun equivalent, you should use feminine pronouns for me, unless the text specifies otherwise. I greatly appreciate every single translation done on any one of my works, so I wish to accommodate other branches however possible. If you have any questions related to any of my work that you need answered to make translation easier, I will gladly help out however I am able.
