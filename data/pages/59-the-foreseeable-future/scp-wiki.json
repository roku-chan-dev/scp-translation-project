The voice on the other end was a little strained, and just the faintest bit Austrian. \"Director McInnis.\"\n\n\"Mr. Zwist.\"\n\n\"It's been a long time since I called this line. I wonder, is it the same telephone?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. The technology has been hardened considerably since Dr. Scout occupied this office. But it //is// the same office.\" He looked down. \"The same desk, as well. Not the same chair.\"\n\n\"Chairs are one of the few things to have improved over the last few decades.\"\n\n\"You'll hear no argument from me.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're a famously agreeable fellow. That's the only reason I agreed to this communication.\"\n\nMcInnis walked around the edge of the desk, and sat down. \"I understand we've been testing the boundaries of your patience, of late.\"\n\n\"It isn't a matter of patience, Director. I merely refuse to become too… involved. But my debt to your predecessor has not yet been paid, and I know you to be an honourable man. I doubt I will suffer very much in the course of a single telephone call. What did you wish to discuss?\"\n\nMcInnis glanced up at the framed //objet d'art.// \"You know that I was one of Dr. Scout's apprentices.\"\n\n\"As was Dr. Blank.\"\n\n\"Yes. He trusted us to carry on his legacy. He knew his time was limited, and he used it well. He taught us nearly everything he knew. We have done precious little with it.\"\n\n\"Reading between the lines, as I try to do, this would seem to be inaccurate.\" The strain in the old man's voice came through more clearly now. \"I have the distinct impression that you and yours have saved the entire world several times over the last two decades.\"\n\n\"Saved the world as it is. Would you call that a great feat? I wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Billions would. Most of them haven't the luxury of judging the quality of their lives. They are content merely to continue living.\"\n\n\"But I am not.\" McInnis turned back to face his desk, and tried to imagine the old cryptomancer sitting across from him. \"I find myself needing to pass on what I've learned. Give others the opportunity Dr. Scout afforded me. I have tried, and failed, to honour him in this fashion.\"\n\n\"Why do you believe you have failed?\" Zwist sounded surprised.\n\n\"Wynn Rydderech sacrificed his life for the Good Work. Vivian sacrificed his career. I've sacrificed //nothing.// There is no hill for me to die on. I prefer to live, at the bottom of a hole. Vivian dedicated the latter part of his life to finding successors, and mentoring them. We aren't doing that. I made a single, solitary effort in that regard, and I've lost him,\" his throat caught, just for an instant, \"and I can feel myself resisting the idea of starting again. Harry—\"\n\n\"Who have you lost?\" Zwist interrupted.\n\n\"My assistant. A young man named Zulfikar. He was killed by the //giftschreiber.//\"\n\n\"I'm surprised that would be enough to sour you on the prospect of passing on what you have learned. That isn't the impression I got of you from Vivian at all.\"\n\nMcInnis blinked. If they'd been meeting face to face, Zwist could have read him like a large print book. \"You discussed me?\"\n\n\"Of course. He said you were driven. Intelligent. Conscientious. Frighteningly observant. He felt confident you would do justice to his cause.\"\n\n\"Well, he lived for a long, long time. It's little surprise that he would be wrong at least once.\"\n\n\"I don't believe he's wrong. I believe you're at a low ebb, after a long project, and being unfair to yourself. When the hurt has faded, you will try again. You //must.//\"\n\n\"I don't know that I have it in me. I'm starting to feel my age.\"\n\n\"Age has nothing to do with it. You will find your commitment again. You will carry that weight. You are a man of many burdens, and none can bear them but you.\"\n\nHe shook his head, pointlessly. \"Do you think perhaps you might be projecting? I understand you haven't taken an apprentice in years. Perhaps decades.\"\n\nNow the old man sounded cross. \"We weren't talking about me.\"\n\n\"Weren't we?\"\n\nSilence on the line.\n\n\"I am… surprised. Pleasantly or unpleasantly, I do not know.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Vivian spoke so highly of your cleverness. I did not expect to find that he was engaging in critical understatement.\"\n\n\"It has been my experience that people are not often fond of receiving advice, but rarely shy away from giving it.\" McInnis smiled. \"Vivian once told me this: one fact is information. Two facts are an opportunity.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image Zwist_McInnis_Burdens.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 8 September\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was Amelia's first Breach.\n\nIt was the first Breach without Chief Nascimbeni.

There had been suggestions that Nascimbeni's son Gallo, or even his granddaughter Flora, should take his place in the protocols.

Phil Deering sat beside him on the right, holding back tears, but not very well; Doug stayed on his mirror at the door, none of his scars moving. \n\nBanerjee had put on his old J&M uniform for the occasion. \n\nFlora, seated to his left, was already wearing hers.\n\nMcInnis had, as his friends had suspected, begun composing the eulogy early. He had a very efficient mind like that.

You have friends of your own, and I don't know all of them. I would understand what it means to you that they are your friends, of course, but friendship is a thing with import that cannot be fully conveyed beyond its bounds. I can tell you that I worked with Noè Nascimbeni for over forty years, and you might understand that fact academically, but you would not understand how the weight of those years is settling on me now that I know their full number, that the number will rise no further. I cannot make you feel my regret and sorrow at his passing, my guilt for the moments when I fell short in my duties as his friend, the pleasure I took in knowing that despite our differences, I had his respect, and the impulse it gave me to try and deserve it.\n\nYou may not have known he was my friend. You may not have known that I have ever had one. I am not given to overt expressions of affection. I do not advertise my more complex emotions. I am the face of this facility, and to a certain extent that means I wear a mask. A mask of calm, of certitude, of cryptic neutrality. I have only once stood before you and stated, as I am stating now, that I feel this loss as a personal one. It is no coincidence that the first time I did so, it was in eulogy of the finest man I had ever known.\n\nNoè was not the finest man I have ever known.\n\nI was not the finest man he had ever known. We were not always good to each other. We did not always have the other's respect. On countless occasions, I was a better leader to him than a friend. Many times, he was a poor subordinate. On occasion, a poor companion. We did violence to each other, though we never came to blows. We took things from each other, though the power differential meant that what I lost, I got back, and what he lost…\n\nHe lost more time with you, Gallo, and you, Flora, because of me. Because of a need I judged greater than yours, because of a duty I valued above my friendship to your father, your grandfather. I will never know what he might have done with that time, had I allowed him the luxury of choice. I know that what he did instead was the grandest possible expression of what he had striven for all his life: he ensured the safety and stability of all those in his care. Most often, that lucky cadre numbered just over one thousand souls. A few times, every soul of the planet Earth owed its survival to his mastery of his trade, and the generous dimensions of his heart.\n\nI had in my power a great man, and I bent him to a great purpose. That is who I am, and what I do. I am still doing it to others. I will not relent. I will spend you, if you must be spent, because there is a secret and terrible cost to the survival of our race. \n\nThis is not a world which rewards valour, selflessness and sacrifice in equal proportion. It makes fuel of us, and we burn up before the destination is in view. We do not have the comfort of knowing that our good intentions and best efforts will achieve our lofty aims, and we will never know for an honest fact that humanity at large has been saved.\n\nBecause there will always be a next threat, and another, and yet more. But it //is// a tragedy each and every time our ranks are thinned by a new calamity. Our battles are chosen for us, and from time to time, they take us, and the fight is not always good. Our work is not always Good. Ours is not always the side of the angels.\n\nWhat sort of man allows himself to be so abused?\n\nForced down a path of another's choosing. Stolen away from his family. Put to work in defence of the indefensible. No recompense appropriate to the effort expended. No light at the end of the tunnel, only more tunnel, and more, and more, narrowing to a point, and then then oblivion. What kind of man was my friend, that he would allow these things to be done to him?\n\nNot a coward. Not a hermit. Not a monster.\n\nHe was an engineer.\n\nEngineers are dreamers, and he dared to dream as none had ever dreamed before. He dreamed you into being, from nothing, in the darkest of all possible hours, time and again. You were his ideal, and he realized you. You were the future, and he was your futurist. It was his plan that you should be here now, though he is not. That you should do what you believe is right, as he did. That you should do what all engineers must do: improve in increments on the former design. His template was sound, but there is room for improvement. Greater sacrifices are yet to come. Any of us may be called upon to enact them. Perhaps all of us.\n\nBecause we must be dreamers, too. That is what he would have wanted. And he was my friend, so I want that as well. I am your Director, and my authority here is absolute. As I mistreated him, I turn now to mistreat you. I give you no options. I make you a challenge that you must accept, and you will rise to it, and you will succeed:\n\nBe better than he was. Be far better than I have been. Be the very best. Because that is what he expects of you, and you owe him your very existence.\n\nI will not allow you to let him down.\n\nExcel, in his memory, as your children will excel in yours.\n\nThat is his charge. I will not release you of it.\n\nSpeak today in his memory.\n\nWalk tomorrow in his footsteps.\n\nI will not say goodbye. As always, my dear friend, you are merely just ahead.\n\nLead on.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThe program suggested time would be set aside for short personal remarks.\n\nHalf of the technicians ended up giving full speeches instead.\n\nThe funeral dissolved into a wake so organically that they hardly even noticed it had happened.\n\nIt was, in a way, their campfire on the sands translated over time, space, and context.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was probably just coincidence that Ibanez found herself side by side with Polyxeni Mataxas as the funeral crowd shuffled out.

Polly was keeping very quiet, probably waiting for Ibanez to explain what the escort meant.\n\n\"What happens when people die?\" Ibanez finally asked, and felt like a small child for doing so. The fact that she was over a foot shorter than the woman she was asking didn't help.\n\nTo her credit, Polly didn't react with surprise or confusion. \"Depends on a lot of factors. Were you looking for the complete rundown?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I just…\" She shrugged. \"I don't know a lot about ghosts.

Recursive apparitions. Repeating the events that led up to their deaths. What?\"\n\nThe light that had gone on in Ibanez's head had apparently shone out through her eyes. Shades of Udo Okorie. \"Repeating the events leading up to their deaths. Just struck me as funny. We're all sort of doing that, from a timeline perspective.\"\n\n\"Bit morbid. I dig it.\"\n\nThey laughed.\n\nUnlike in Zevala, it felt right to laugh.\n\nThis had been a tragedy, too, but it had also been a triumph.\n\n\"But obviously that isn't the only way to go,\" Polly continued. \"It's not even a common one, actually. If there's one thing we've thoroughly established in all the years we've been examining postmortem phenomena, it's that there really must be something very special about the human soul.\"\n\n\"Because of all the different ways it can manifest after death.\"\n\n\"Right.\" They were into R&E now. All around them, researchers were finding their offices and techs were getting ready to fix all the things that had been broken during the Breach, which could safely have waited until now. Amelia would be giving them their orders. \"It can be as simple as manipulating objects the subject had a close connection with. Whispering to loved ones. Affecting electric light fixtures. Radio broadcasts, sometimes; we're still working on that one, there's a lot of moving parts. Some take corporeal form, some just leave a lingering sense of presence.\"\n\n\"Like Wirth in the bathroom of AAF-D.\"\n\n\"Right. Usually that sort of thing is associated with unresolved trauma. The old chestnut about ghosts being people who left things undone, unsaid or whatever has some basis in fact, evidential fact I mean, but it's also not the most common way these things express.\"\n\n\"What is? What's the most common kind of ghost?\"\n\n\"Everything we've seen suggests that the link between the worlds of the living and the dead needs to go both ways. They need to want to come back, and they need to be wanted, for the manifestation to be at its strongest. We're talking about normal, every-day people here, of course. Anomalous beings of all sorts have all sorts of weird caveats.\"\n\nNow they were in the large lounge space connecting Polly's office to her father's, and the various rooms they'd set up all their equipment in. \"What does it mean when someone doesn't come back?\"\n\nPolly sat down on the nearest chair. \"Most people don't come back. Spectres are outliers.\"\n\nIbanez remained standing. \"Sure, but why?\"\n\n\"I suppose most people end up at peace.\"\n\nIbanez scowled. \"That can't be right. Death is almost always ugly. People don't want to die.\"\n\n\"That isn't the same as not wanting to stay dead. Can I ask, is there a specific reason you're thinking about this now?\"\n\nShe looked away. \"Nothing I can talk about.\"\n\n\"So, it's a clearance thing.\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Well, I can talk your ear off all day about ghosts and ghouls, but if you want specific information you'll have to loop me in on, well. The specifics.\"\n\n\"I understand.\" Ibanez stood up straight, the meeting already over in her mind. \"Thanks, Polly.\"\n\n\"So that's a no, then.\"\n\n\"For now.\"\n\n\"Let me know if you change your mind.\"\n\nIbanez smiled at her, half feeling it. \"That's the good thing about ghosts.

Storied personnel such as Martin Strauss, the first Chief of Security and Containment, or Gedeon Van Rompay, longest-serving Chief of Pursuit and Suppression, make up the bulk of the gallery, though there are plenty of humbler, short-term members of personnel admitted to this hall of the fallen; agents lost in the line of duty, such as Sandrine Holt and Lewis Bosch, or slain technicians like Charles Carter, Sergey Vanchev and Paul Nicolescu (the latter two only after considerable debate by their surviving peers).

There was a distance between your lot and mine that, honestly, I've never understood.\" She sat back in her chair; it was bigger and more comfortable-looking than her mother's had been, from what little McInnis could recall from his first visit to this office, a long, long time ago. \"Lingering personal feuds, I think. I know she didn't comport herself well when she was in your house, and…\" She looked away, and McInnis realized she was looking at a framed photograph. It was facing away from him. \"Well. Your predecessor may not have been on his best behaviour in this office, either.\"\n\n\"I concede the possibility.\"\n\n\"So then.\" Couch clasped her hands together, and rested them on the desk. \"Let's start the new era right. I was thinking we might formulate an agreement, you and I.\"\n\n\"What did you have in mind?\"\n\n\"An official apology from OSAT for the unpleasantness in 1969 and 2003, and a resolution to continue working together for the maintenance of what you call the Veil.\" He saw nothing but honesty in her dark brown eyes. \"Particularly in light of Dr. Okorie's cooperation with the previous administration, I think we can enter into a new relationship characterized by amicable relations, and a sharing of resources.

Even having to get it back from themselves secondhand via recorded debriefings, the Survivors had acquired several duplicate lifetimes of insight into their fellow members of personnel.\n\nIt was just the three of them, for now. McInnis would share whatever was learned with the others in due course, and there would likely be followup appointments, but for now he preferred to omit the interruptions and grandstanding his friends brought to every meeting.\n\n\"So,\" he said. \"You've read the file, and our debriefings.

This is something else entirely.\"\n\nThe Uncontained and Unyielding apparently had a fascinating relationship with causality. Though the timeline had now been fully restored, and one might reasonably have expected that every possible connection between what Harry was trying to get everyone to call \"the Brothers Un\" had already been made, that was inexplicably not the case. A haze of confusion had apparently hung over everything relating to them since the first Breach, such that they were only now all catching up. McInnis wondered if this was the universe abhorring a contradiction.\n\n\"They caused the Breach. Or, one of them did.\" Corbin had a cigarette in her fingers, and she twirled it absent-mindedly. \"And now they inhabit it. And, uh, you guys. Which is obviously awkward.\"\n\nMcInnis inclined his head in acknowledgement.\n\n\"We'll obviously need to wait until next year to know if the Unyielding's influence on you and the other taskforce members is permanent,\" said Nass. \"But given that the Victims still materialize and run through the motions despite the fact that their possessor is presently alive and well, I would imagine you'll be carrying that baggage permanently.\"\n\n\"It is not such a heavy burden,\" McInnis murmured.\n\nThen he blinked.\n\n\"What?\" said Corbin.\n\n\"I will explain at a later date.\" He shook his head. \"I'll have to confer with the others first.\"\n\nCorbin's expression soured. \"Information only flows one way, huh.\"\n\nNass glared at her. \"Brenda.\"\n\nShe shrugged.\n\nMcInnis leaned forward, elbows on the table, steepling and unsteepling his fingers to distract himself from the intrusive thought. \"Have you made any progress on the origins of these creatures?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\" Brenda took a moment to collect her thoughts. \"Udo and I have been conferring since the whole thing with the //Bonhomme,// and… well. You read that report?\"\n\nMcInnis nodded.\n\n\"A splintered sleep deity. That's our best guess. Doesn't seem too much of a stretch to suggest that our fourth floor guests are chaos and order deities, subjected to the same process by the forces of the Breach.\"\n\n\"But from what you told me,\" Nass said to her, \"5281-D believed his primordial form had been //created// before it was shattered.

There was a sign out front, featuring a turtle adorned with the four colours of the Chippewa. The turtle was a symbol of North America, what many of the First Nations called Turtle Island, a living space to be shared and protected. He'd heard a few non-native academics employing the term in their works, even invoking it to acknowledge the ancestral owners of the land on which they lived and worked. Some called it the first step to a new arrangement.\n\nThe ASC wasn't so optimistic.\n\n\"Bad news,\" he said as the Director climbed out of his car.

At any rate, humility at these talks could sometimes go a long way. \"Nexology never got back to us.\"\n\nThe draft proposal for new terms between Site-43 and the reserves making up Nexus-94 had been drafted by the ASC himself, so he took personal umbrage that it had apparently been filed under 'read later' by the Foundation's supposed authorities on all matters Nexus.

One hand was resting on his cane, and the other raised in silent greeting.\n\nThe ASC raised a hand of his own, and unlocked the front door with the other.\n\nHe'd been in this house less and less as the years rolled past him. It was a fiction to be maintained, like any other, but not a particularly attractive one. Foundation regulations meant that he couldn't actually live on the res, with the people he was representing; any residence occupied by someone at Clearance Level 4 had to be secure, and as far out of sight and mind as was feasible. The fact that he was a public figure made no difference. The little house was smart, and well-kept, but it didn't feel at all like home.\n\nZwist sat down at the kitchen table, and the ASC went for the fridge. There was fresh lemonade inside, and nothing else. He didn't have a housekeeper. He wondered what Overwatch would have thought about his definition of 'secure', given it included allowing the locals to keep a front door key.\n\nHe poured two glasses, and sat down across from the old man. Zwist took the glass eagerly, and the ASC smiled as he watched the first glass empty in record time. It was warm outside, and even immortals could sweat.\n\nSome of them, anyway.\n\nHe stood up to retrieve the jug from the fridge, while Zwist began to speak. \"I must say this is the most pleasant introduction I've had to one of your lot. The rest are all…\" \n\nHe shook his head.\n\nThe ASC put the jug down on the table, and sat again. \"Big personalities,\" he said.\n\nZwist nodded. \"And they never shut up.\"\n\nThe ASC chuckled. \"They're talkers. Most of them aren't listeners. But you only need a few of those to make a difference.\" He poured Zwist a second glass, and then raised his own. They clinked the rims together, drank together, and then made eye contact.\n\n\"I think it's my day for listening,\" said Zwist. \"I'm something of a talker myself, as I'm sure you know.\"\n\n\"It's come up.\"\n\nZwist smiled ruefully. \"I have a tendency to ramble, and lecture. But Allan tells me you might have a unique perspective on our common dilemma, and I should very much like to hear it.\"\n\nThe ASC leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs and clasped his hands over his thigh. \"Do you know how Site-43 came to be situated where it is?\"\n\nThe old man shook his head.\n\n\"In 1942, the federal government made an insultingly low offer to buy the land above, for the purposes of constructing a military base. Camp Ipperwash. The people who had lived on that land refused. The land was taken anyway, and the camp built. It was promised that when the war had ended, everything would be returned. This did not occur.\"\n\n\"Power rarely accepts curtailment,\" Zwist nodded. \"And never curtails itself.\"\n\n\"The stolen reserve became a provincial park. In 1995, the people occupied that park to raise awareness. A man was shot and killed by the provincial police. There was a media furor, then an inquiry. The government crafted an agreement for recompense — that's what they called it, an 'agreement'. It would not surprise you to hear that the people did not agree.\"\n\nThe old man's bushy eyebrows rose a little, then fell again, in acknowledgement.\n\n\"These people know a lot about cycles, Mr. Zwist. Since time immemorial they have understood the cycles of the land and its creatures. The advent of the French, the British, the Canadians and the Foundation, these things were ferocious shocks to the system, but they still fit the schema. Everything turns. It was understood that the attention lavished on this place during the war would lapse almost immediately, and might not resume for a generation. When it came down to it, we were forced to give history a push before the cycle swung 'round again. That lasted for a moment, and then the gyre wound off as it always does.\"\n\nZwist frowned. \"You're making it sound like this inhumane treatment is just a symptom of an impersonal force. I should think you'd be the last one to relieve your government of its obligations.\"\n\nThe ASC shook his head. \"That isn't what I mean at all. They are each responsible for their actions. We are all responsible for what we know, and what we do not know. What we witness, and do not witness. What we choose to see, and where we choose to remain blind. But we are all caught up in something bigger than ourselves. Something composed of the whole of us. An individual human being might believe it is wrong to take someone's home away from them, and more wrong to never give it back. They might believe everyone deserves to drink clean water, and have their roads maintained, and be allowed to travel wherever they will along those roads. But to be willing to actually do something in defence of these beliefs? That is uncommon. We are all inertial creatures.\"\n\nZwist sipped at his lemonade. \"So what the others experience as a cycle of order and chaos…\"\n\n\"We see as a cycle of action and inaction. They impose their order, and we act, and they react. They withdraw without admitting defeat, and let the matter lie, and we wait for the next chance. We live our lives. They live theirs. We watch them, and they are ignorant of us. And in the absence of a solution, it swings around again. We present them with what they call chaos, and they attempt to rationalize it again. And again they fail. As they have always failed.

He'd been surprised, very surprised, to find that William Wettle was good for anything, but the replication studies were at this point dovetailing with his own research to produce what might become, in a few more months, a comprehensive roadmap for dealing with the uneven and changeable terrain of their increasingly wobbly baseline.\n\nHe could have used a little fresh air now and then. But that was how long projects went. \n\nThe sun would still be out there when he was done. In fact, finishing the project might be the only way he could assure that the sun would still be out there.\n\nHe was all the way into his dormitory, the door closed behind him and his notepad on the counter, before he realized something was wrong. Even without doing the math, he could tell that there were more lines converging in here than there should have been. \n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_14_Sykora_Kidnapped.jpg]]\n\nThis dorm was his asylum from the web of possibility.

My name is Kyle.\"\n\nImrich accepted the handshake without meaning to. \"What are you doing in my room?\"\n\nKyle looked over his shoulder at the woman. \"Would you like to tell him, Julia?\"\n\nJulia was dressed for the office, but ornamental rather than practical. Her voice, however, was hard and serious. \"We're here to make you an offer, Imrich.\"\n\n\"An offer I can't refuse?\"\n\nShe laughed. The man laughed with her. Imrich hated them instantly.\n\n\"Why would you want to refuse? We know all about you, of course. The man who can predict anything, even when nothing is predictable. What an asset you'll be. To someone.\"\n\n\"You'd be wasted on the Foundation,\" Kyle smiled. \"They won't be making it out of the present troubles intact, I'm afraid. And your talents are a poor fit for their goals, anyway. They're only interested in anticipating threats to the //status quo.// We have rather more lofty goals.\" He was still holding Imrich's hand. \"How would you like to stop merely predicting the future, Mr. Sýkora, and start //making it?//\"\n\n\"I don't think I would like that very much at all,\" said Imrich. He was proud of how easily the words came, even under Kyle's intense compulsive glare.\n\n\"That's a shame,\" said Julia.\n\n\"Definitely a shame,\" Kyle agreed.\n\n\"Well,\" the woman sighed, \"every great man needs a push, to make history.\"\n\nKyle nodded at her without taking his eyes off Imrich. \"We've paid well for the push, anyway.

Specifically, it meant the Foundation was watching each and every GoI. In general, it meant that anyone whose actions impacted the Veil of Normalcy was operating in the Foundation's field of interest. It was a way of claiming the whole anomalous world as their backyard, and all anomalous activity as their bailiwick.\n\nThe Groups of Interest Research Group, which typically abbreviated the first three words for obvious reasons, was headquartered at Site-55 in Boston, Massachusetts and headed by a researcher named Justine Everwood. The first thing Everwood said was \"Call me Jay.\" The second was \"Call me 'they'.\" And they smiled, because that was meant to be funny, because it rhymed.\n\nWhen Ilse had gone into the incinerator room, using 'they' as a singular pronoun had still been generally considered a grammatical error. But given that a woman with a PhD had still been generally considered a socialization error, she found it easy to make this adjustment.\n\nAnd anyone with a sense of humour that corny had more in common with Ilse than most.\n\n\"I suppose you're interviewing everybody,\" she said.\n\nEverwood nodded. \"Everybody who's had any contact with the //alte// or //neuer giftschreiber.// Did I pronounce those right?\"\n\n\"Pretty close,\" Ilse smiled, and then she said both terms precisely.\n\nEverwood repeated the corrections aloud, and Ilse nodded. She noticed that the GoI expert was holding a tablet, but not typing on it, and then realized this was because they only had one arm. The sleeve of their labcoat was tied off. //Must be voice activated.//\n\n\"Okay,\" Everwood smiled. \"You're Dutch, right? That's why you can pronounce it so easily.\"\n\n\"There's similarities,\" Ilse allowed, \"but I can pronounce it so easily because I've got twice as much time as anyone else to figure things out.\"\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Everwood nodded. \"Now, uh, please. Tell me about your encounter.\"\n\n\"It was my sister.\" Ilse shook her head. \"Except it can't have been. She looked just like her — just like //me// — but there was something off about her affect. I wasn't in a good place, and wasn't thinking clearly, but in retrospect I'm sure she was just wearing my sister's appearance as a disguise.\"\n\n\"So, a //geistschreiber.//\" Everwood didn't look to her for approval of that pronunciation. There was really only one way it could go.\n\n\"That's what I think. Yes.\"\n\n\"What did she want?\"\n\n\"She wanted to know what made the deadline special.\" She paused. Everwood had an easy, unassuming nature that made it easy to talk to them, and Ilse had just potentially slipped up because of it. \"You're cleared to know about those?\"\n\nEverwood smiled reassuringly. \"Yes ma'am. They've brought me up to speed on all things 5243.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_15_Reynders_Everwood.jpg]]\n\n\"Good. Okay.

We didn't have a term for them yet, so I called them tangents. I felt they were subordinate to baseline. That's what I told her, and in the end, I was right.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" Everwood was one of the few people Ilse had met who could say that word without it sounding condescending. \"And you're sure this was in the deadline, not baseline?\" They suddenly reeled back a little, and Ilse wondered if they were slapping their forehead with their phantom limb. \"Obviously, or the tangents wouldn't have come up. Okay, that's fascinating. I haven't heard about these people leaping from timeline to timeline before. You're a very special person, Dr. Reynders. I mean, your situation is very… uh.\" Everwood was blushing fiercely as they tried to walk back their //faux pas.//\n\nIlse returned the earlier favour of a reassuring smile. \"Thank you. And yes, it's strange. Does it suggest anything to you?\"\n\nEverwood tapped the tablet against their hip. \"Could tie in to the references some of the others have made to escaping the apocalypse when they trigger it. Maybe the power to create these dead timelines was something the Uncontained and Unyielding could always do, and it got incorporated into the Breach when it killed them.\"\n\nIlse whistled. \"Now //that// is a theory. Something to ask them about. Bravo.\"\n\nEverwood's grateful smile was almost shy. \"Thanks. Yeah, I'll look into it. Did she say anything else?\"\n\nIlse almost didn't tell them, but… //What the heck.// \"She told me I was never getting out of this box.\"\n\nEverwood's face fell. \"Jeez. Wow. I'm sorry, Dr. Reynders. That's awful.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" Reynders shrugged. \"I think it's quite a hopeful thing.\"\n\nEverwood's face went blank. \"Hopeful how?\"\n\nWhere Ilse was from, or rather //when,// women were not meant to grin. But she was more now than her origins would have implied. All of them were, including this one-armed wallflower with the startlingly fast uptake. \"It means they don't know everything,\" she grinned. \"I'm not as helpless as I look.\"\n\n\"You don't look helpless,\" Everwood grinned back. \"But I bet you'd be no great shakes at mountain climbing.\"\n\n\"You climb mountains?\" Reynders laughed, then suddenly wondered if she'd spoiled the moment.\n\n\"With one sleeve tied behind my back,\" Everwood laughed with her. \"See?

They'd brought in a rocking chair for her, which she found touching, considering the circumstances; Harry had told her she'd always had \"the affect of an aunt,\" which she'd found marginally less touching, even if she couldn't quite find an angle to argue.\n\n\"That's it?\" Ibanez picked up the tablet. \"Man, I miss books.

Upset at all.\"\n\n\"What, just because you were spying on us?\" Blank plucked the tablet out of Ibanez's fingers. The little woman made a big noise of protest, but she was already at least two thirds in the bag, and her reflexes were dulled. \"That's old hat. We've been collecting spies like flies. Willie even dated one of them. In every reality.\"\n\n\"Except the apocalypse one,\" Wettle reminded him.\n\n\"That one doesn't count.\" Blank flicked through the files. \"Anyway, it's not like we're idiots. Obviously your reports were going to Overwatch.\"\n\n\"Beyond obvious,\" Okorie agreed. Ngo wasn't totally sure the other woman still knew what was being referenced, but she took the affirmation anyway.\n\n\"It's just…\" Ngo sighed, and folded her hands in her lap. No wonder they thought she was so matronly as to enjoy a rocking chair. The worst of it was, they weren't wrong. \"I felt very guilty about it, for a very long time. But it was what was expected of me. So I did it anyway.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"We've all done what was expected of us. That's how we've learned to set our own expectations.\"\n\n\"Still, big dick move.\" Ibanez swatted over her head, catching the tablet and pulling it back down out of Blank's hands. So, not so dulled perhaps. \"Coming clean to the secret cabal. Whycome?\"\n\n\"This is a secret cabal?\" Torosyan asked. She looked startled.\n\nWettle pointed at her. His head was invisible under the coffee table. \"New Wettle!\" he shouted.\nLillihammer pointed at her. \"New Wettle!\"\n\n\"I like her better than the old Wettle,\" said Blank.\n\nShe furrowed her brow, considered, then winked at him. He choked on his drink.\n\nNgo waited to see if anyone else was going to intercede before answering the question. \"It just… seems to //me,// that you've got it all figured out. It wasn't Overwatch that brought back baseline. It wasn't the TAD. And it wasn't Karen Elstrom, either.\" She just barely restrained herself from adding a descriptive expletive between the woman's names.\n\nMcInnis raised a hand. \"In her own way, Dr. Elstrom is doing what she feels is right. Everyone in this room has that in common with her. And happily, at this facility, we are not outnumbered.\"\n\n\"Everywhere else, on the other hand,\" Blank sighed.\n\nTorosyan looked at Ngo. \"I haven't been here long,\" she said. \"Are they always like this?\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Just… saying whatever comes into their heads, and assuming it'll work out okay?\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_16_Ngo_Grateful.jpg]]\n\nNgo laughed. \"Yes.

Scurrying beneath the boards.\" She made an illustrative motion with her hands.\n\nIbanez made an even more illustrative motion at her in response.\n\n\"We could perhaps do with a little more discretion,\" McInnis admitted. \"Particularly given the uncertain road ahead.\"\n\nNgo frowned. \"You brought them both back. You restored the proper course of reality. What could possibly still be ahead?\"\n\n\"Another deadline,\" Lillihammer sighed.\n\nHer frown deepened. \"Won't those be over, now that…? No?\"\n\nThe archivist was shaking his head. \"One more. Definitely at least one more.\"\n\n\"At least and at most,\" said Lillihammer. She hiccoughed. Okorie hiccoughed back at her, and they both laughed.\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Ngo once again scanned each of their faces for an explanation, and noticed Torosyan doing the same. \"Why do you think there's going to be one more?\"\n\n\"Because of Rydderech.\" Lillihammer hiccoughed again. \"The last warning he gave me was number six out of seven. He's got outside context vision, somehow, because he's weird, so odds are there's still one more bad future in the pipeline.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nThey drank in companionable silence for a while. Okorie elbowed her to ask what she was drinking. Ngo told her: \"Sinh Tố.\"\n\n\"Sounds exotic.\" The other woman's eyes were wide, and glowing. \"What's it mean?\"\n\n\"Fruit smoothie,\" Ngo told her, and the entire room exploded.\n\nMetaphorically speaking.\n\nShe put the glass down on the coffee table, just as Ibanez discarded the tablet. They met with a dull little //clink.// \"Now,\" said Ngo, \"I understand that most of you are drunk right now—\"\n\n\"I'm not drunk!\" Lillihammer protested. \"I am //plastered.//\"\n\nNgo nodded in acknowledgement. \"I was just wondering, ah… why you all seem so upbeat.

It would be her mother again. Age hadn't dulled the parental instinct for interference.\n\nShe dressed at leisure, gently stirring the air in her room as she did so, filling the air with red. It danced to her whims, as it always did. Her whims alone, if they'd understood the Director's epiphany about responsibility correctly.\n\nShe still marvelled that she could have done even a fraction of the things she'd done on her own power, but the others had already accepted it as fact. She felt a certain way about that. She was still looking for a name for the emotion.\n\nIt was certainly more development than most people's characters saw in their early adulthood, she thought as she stepped into the bathroom and turned on the lights. She allowed the //vim harenae// to lift her long hair up in braids, fanning it out to its full and prodigious length. \"God,\" she said out loud. \"It's like four feet fucking long.\" It grew twice, maybe three times as fast as other people's hair did, undoubtedly one of the many symptoms of her thaumaturgical heritage.\n\nWell, she had her doubts, actually.

He stood there a moment longer, staring intently, then obeyed the directive.\n\n\"They told me you didn't want to see me.\" She couldn't tell if the look of relief on his face was genuine or not. In all the years that it passed since she seen him last, she'd never been able to figure out whether any of what they'd shared have been real or not. \"I'm glad they were wrong.\"\n\n\"They weren't wrong.\" Udo sat there in silence for a moment, long enough for him to look her over, see that there was nothing but academic interest in her eyes. \"I only came here because there's still something you can do for me. Something I need to know.\"\n\n\"Why are you being like this?\" He was attempting to look hurt. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nShe wasn't going to give him an inch. \"For starters, Bernie Del Olmo and Adrijan Zlatá are dead. You want to tell me what you know about that?\"\n\nDougall looked bewildered. Perhaps he even was. \"Dead? When did that happen?\"\n\n\"Years ago. While you were dead, too.

And when this conversation is over, you'll be dead again. So if there's anything you want to tell me, now would be the time.\" Before he could say anything, she clarified, \"about what I just asked you. Nothing else.\"\n\nHe chewed his bottom lip for a while, then nodded. \"If that's how you want to play it, fine. Del Olmo and Zlatá are… //were// cryptomancers. //Giftschreiber,// though of a different sort.\"\n\n\"And so were you.\" She hadn't believed when it had first been suggested. But it hadn't taken her long to come around, with the twin powers of retro- and introspection\n\n\"I am,\" he agreed, with deliberate emphasis on the present tense. \"And if the others are dead, all the more reason to keep me alive. What we were doing was vital. It still needs to be done.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\n\"Destabilizing the cults, from the inside.\" He finally stopped making the sad puppy face he'd been making, as he warmed to his subject. \"There isn't just one, you see.

Their go-between?\n\n\"That's right.\" He was nodding rapidly, as though excited she appeared to be buying what he was selling. \"It wasn't safe for them to interact.

Met some folks who really could fuck the power, so the power could never unfuck itself. They taught me everything I know. And I didn't use it wisely, and the Foundation found out. Assumed I was just an unregistered Type Blue, since nobody'd ever heard of a //geistschreiber// before, and they put me to work. But I never forgot what I'd seen. And I came to realize what it meant. And that I could do something about it.\"\n\n\"And did you?\"\n\nHe blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Did you do anything about it? Besides getting your friends killed?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"You don't understand. It was a delicate thing. Can't push too hard. Can't go too fast. That game they're playing? It's the longest long game that's ever been played.

Strength he could lean on, metaphorically.\n\n\"You've done us a tremendous service, as you well know.\" The Advisor's respect was palpably begrudging. \"We've read all the reports and debriefings. It's something of a shock to think how far off the rails everything could have gotten, without anyone recognizing it.\"\n\n\"I suspect Director Xyank realized it,\" McInnis said. \"And chose to wait and see if things shook out on their own.\"\n\nThe Mediator was always the easiest silhouette to identify, even without the glowing nameplate. Their body language never shifted out of neutral. \"I would imagine he had faith you would see us through, Allan. As did all of us.\"\n\n\"If I may, sirs?\" Karen asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Governor responded.\n\n\"Faith is a good start, but only if action follows.\"\n\nThe room was deathly quiet for a moment.\n\n\"I had assumed this meeting was a victory lap,\" the Advisor grumbled. \"Have we been hooked into another harangue? Is the ghost of Vivian Scout here in the room with us?\"\n\n\"One of the many things we've learned from SCP-5243,\" McInnis smiled, \"is that hauntings can be recursive. I would like to think my predecessor never fully left.\"\n\n\"What are we about to argue about?\" the Governor sighed.\n\n\"Debate,\" the Mediator gently chided him.\n\nKaren cracked her knuckles. It was all McInnis could do not to grin at the sound. \"It's been a few decades. We believe, with respect, that it's been a long enough interval that the D-class personnel question really ought to be re-opened.\"\n\nThere was a whirring in the dark, and a single bright light appeared just off centre of the boardroom's horseshoe-shaped table. The Archivist's nameplate blinked into life.\n\nThe Chair's followed. Then the Oracle. The Combatant, the Operator, the Humanist. The silhouettes of the combined O5 Council arrayed around them in an unbroken line. They were surrounded. Outnumbered. Profoundly outclassed.\n\nMcInnis turned to smile at Karen.\n\nShe did the same.\n\nAnd neither of them needed to see the other to know it.\n\n\"Shall we begin?\" McInnis asked.\n\nThere was a rumbling from the Chair, but the Director hadn't been addressing him, and Karen spoke first.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_19_McInnis_Elstrom.jpg]]\n\n\"With pleasure, sir.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image McInnis_Elstrom_O5-8.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"Zaman\"]]\n**2019 Personnel Review**\n\n**Subject:** William W. Wettle (Deputy Chair, Replication Studies SubSection, Site-43)\n\n**Officer of Record:** Noor Zaman (Chief, Hiring and Regulation Section, Site-43) \n\n----\n\n**Chief Zaman:** You've had a busy year.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Have I?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** By your standards.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** What's that supposed to mean?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Your SubSection has done more work than ever. You've taken on new staff. Done a lot of publication. You're pulling your weight, plus.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Plus what?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** I meant you're pulling more than just your weight.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Oh. Well.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Some days my weight is kind of a lot, though.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Still. It's been a great boon to the overall project.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Project?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** The Foundation. The Veil. The preservation of normalcy. \n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Oh. Sure. That stuff.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Director McInnis assures me that although the various implementations are top secret, the work you and your assistants do is materially contributing to the continued survival of mankind at large.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Oh. Yeah. That's pretty good, isn't it?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** It's certainly not bad.\n\n//<Audio event consistent with the shuffling of papers.>//\n\n**Chief Zaman:** On the other hand…\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** There's always an other hand.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** No, I've only got two. See?\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Little joke.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I didn't notice.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Okay. So, that other hand. The studies you've published have been important, and I'm seeing only good reviews, but you've left an enormous amount of work unfinished. Projects half-done. Projects abandoned. Some budgeted and never even begun.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Most of those were boring.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** That's not a very scientific criteria.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Harry would say I'm not a very scientist.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** I'm sure he wouldn't say it that way.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Yeah, he's a lot smarter than me. Thanks for the reminder. You can go back to reading your laundry list, now.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Alright. Even given your unfortunate proclivity for bad luck, you've caused a tremendous amount of property damage this year alone.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I like how you said 'enormous' the first time, and 'tremendous' the second time. You should have found a synonym for 'amount', though. Repetition is my thing, not yours.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Most of your collaborators outside of Replication Studies have given you extremely low ratings for cooperation and academic fellowship.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Not very cooperative and fellowship…//ish,// of them.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** I've had to open a second HR file on you. The second is dedicated entirely to interpersonal complaints. Nobody at the Site has accrued more of them than you.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Is there an award for that?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Dr. Wettle, do you not see the point I'm trying to make?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Not really. You must be kind of bad at your job.\n\n//<Audio event consistent with the shuffling of papers.>//\n\n**Chief Zaman:** I've got your personnel reviews going back all the way to the mid-nineties. You know what they say?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** That it's a good thing I drink so much milk?\n\n**Chief Zaman:** What?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Calcium.\n\n**Chief Zaman:** William, on every metric not related in some manner to SCP-5243, you're essentially the same man today that you were when you first hired on at Site-333. Don't you think it's about time you… I don't know.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You don't know? Does that mean I can go?\n\n//<Chief Zaman sighs.>//\n\n**Chief Zaman:** Isn't it about time you got out of that rut? Changed up your routine? Attempted to actually grow, as a person?\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Have you guys considered replacing the vending machines with an honour system? I could show you some serious personal growth, if that's what you want.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_20_Wettle_Review.jpg]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n**[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|Interstate 10##: Outside Pensacola, Florida, United States of America**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nShe laughed as she read the final line. \"That was good!

Bucket seats were never designed to be straddled. \"Ready for what?\"\n\n\"Anything.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" He rolled his shoulders, and winced at the series of pops and cracks that resulted. \"You mean that since Thing One and Thing Two are back, everything's going to get worse from this point on?\"\n\nShe shook her head.

Gallo ran a paper towel under the faucet, and before she could even say 'Hello', he was wiping it off. She made a little screech of protest, and for a moment he could see his little girl again, inhabiting the woman she'd become.\n\nHe opened the trashbin and disposed of the dirty paper. \"Really getting into your work, huh?\"\nShe smiled, and kissed him on the cheek. She walked around the kitchen island to take up a stool as he washed his hands. \"F-B is in a right state,\" she said. \"Grampa was telling them for years those bearings wouldn't last as long as the specs said, but Bremmel wrote the specs, and you can't tell that guy //anything.//\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" Gallo picked up the chopping board from where it sat vertical beside the fridge, and laid it down flat on the counter.\n\n\"I can't believe they didn't make our new uniforms out of vinyl. You spill something on them, and it's over. Off to the laundry, and it won't come back the same. The fit shifts. It's ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Does sound ridiculous,\" he agreed as he opened the fridge again to rummage around in the crisper. Roasted vegetables tonight, he thought.\n\n\"I know why Grampa never wanted to give up his vest.\" She spun on the stool's rotating seat. \"Nothing sticks to those things.\"\n\n\"Maybe you can get them reinstated,\" Gallo suggested. He pulled a chopping knife out of the top drawer. \"Or just wear one yourself, once you're Chief.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"What makes you think I'm going to be Chief?\"\n\n\"Just a hunch.\"\n\n\"Well, you can hold your hunches. Amelia, Chief Torosyan, she's great. God, she's smart. And funny. And she's so nice.\"\n\n\"Sounds like somebody's got a crush.\" Gallo began dicing a tomato he'd just picked fresh from the garden.\n\nFlora snorted. \"You ought to see her and Deering. They make such a cute couple.\" He thought he detected an undercurrent of artificiality in this construction, and wasn't disappointed when the resolution came. \"Hey, how did you and mom meet? You never told me.\"\n\nGallo paused, then began pulling stalks of celery out of their plastic bag. \"Your grandpa introduced us. He said, and I think I'm remembering this correctly, 'If I don't fix you a date, you'll never do it yourself'. Then he called me a lazy shit.\"\n\nShe burst out laughing. \"That's my grandpa alright.

It started off with a clinical preamble:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Description:** SCP-001-A and SCP-001-B are entities resembling a pair of physically identical elderly male human beings:\n\n__SCP-001-A__ produces semantic effects consistent with the concept of disorder in a radius around its person.

It has been known by the following epithets throughout human history: the Unyielding, the Huntsman, the Falconer, the Servant, the Jailor, the Corrector, the Lock. \n\nSo long as both entities remain in close proximity to each other, their local effects are mutually exclusive.\n[[/div]]\n\nIt then went on, in Harry's florid style, to become a drama athwart space and time with outrageous implications for the human race. But that wasn't really her //thing.// It didn't tickle her fancy. So she set it aside. Maybe she'd give it another chance when the revisions were posted to the database.\n\nThe others were scheduling interviews with the Uns. They had questions about metaphysics, history, and the future of containment. The answers would be scrutinized at the most minute level, because of course neither brother was anything remotely like a reliable narrator. Lillian would read the interviews, once, because she liked to know things.\n\nBut she wouldn't linger on them.\n\nAs far as she was concerned, the gods were as good as dead.\n\nShe'd killed one aspect in her mind. She'd consulted on the killing of several others. She'd done an end run around the Uncontained, and turned a curse that the Unyielding had placed on her mind into a tool to use against both of them. She'd sussed out every secret they kept which she cared to know. They were a solved problem. They just didn't know it yet.\n\nBecause she was the memory of their fivefold failure. The archive of five universes where they hadn't won.\n\nWhat hope did they have in this one?\n\nHer long-term projects were all dealt with. The antimemetics groups would keep plugging away without her regular input. Wheeler would find a new boojum to hunt, and be hunted by. Bernie was as much at rest as he would ever be. Euler's fight… well. That was in the future.\n\nShe picked up her deck of cognitocatalytic agents, began shuffling it in her hands, and grinned to herself.\n\nToday, her desk was clear. \n\nA world of possibilities.\n\nAnd when they had all played out, she knew she'd still be standing.\n\nNot alone.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_22_Lillian_Tall.jpg]]\n\nBut certainly taller than the rest.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 18 September\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|**Grand Cove##: Grand Bend, Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe sun was shining on Grand Bend. There were storm clouds all around them, but a little pocket of light beamed down on the neat row of cottages as Harry approached down the sidewalk. He could have gotten a car — there was one in his name at the subway's parking garage — but he wanted the time to think. To prepare.\n\nNot, however, to decide whether or not to turn around and go home.\n\nHe'd be moving forwards only, from now on.\n\nHe stood before the bungalow in Grand Cove, hair hanging loose over the jacket they'd shared in a land beyond time, itself hanging loose over his shoulders. He took a deep breath of the clean summer air, and what started as a smile threatened to transform into a giddy giggle if he didn't do something else with the energy. So he raised his hand, and he knocked.\n\nShe opened the door almost immediately. She was smaller than he remembered, and rounder, and her once flawless skin now had wrinkles around the eyes, the mouth, and across the forehead. She wasn't wearing her glasses, and her hair was a tangled mess.\n\nIn short, she was beautiful.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something, but the words wouldn't come. Which was fine, really, because she stepped over the threshold and buried her head in his chest.\n\nThey stood there like that in a timeless moment, embracing with such ferocity that it had to be putting serious strain on the electromagnetic fields of their atoms. If he could have pulled her as close as he wanted to, they would have obliterated all of Lambton County in a thermonuclear blast. His heart felt primed to explode already. In an instant, everything had changed. Nothing else mattered.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/59-the-foreseeable-future/DL_59_23_B_and_B_Recommission.jpg]]\n\n\"Melissa,\" he finally managed. \"I love you.\"\n\n\"You'd fucking better,\" she mumbled into his shirt. She was laughing, or maybe there was another reason why she was shaking like a reed in the wind. His cheeks were burning, and it had nothing to do with the sun. \"I love you too.\"\n\nShe drew him back through the door, step by step, as they held on to each other like their lives depended on it. Perhaps they did.\n\n\"Are we dancing?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Not anymore.\"\n\nHe waited until the door was closed behind them before sweeping her off her feet.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/58-time-flat | previous-title=Time Flat\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/60-underlogue | next-title=Underlogue\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadlined-hub | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Deadlined\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\nThis page quotes William Butler Yeats, \"The Second Coming,\" 1919, in the public domain.\n\nIllustrations in this series use reference material created with DAZ studio.
