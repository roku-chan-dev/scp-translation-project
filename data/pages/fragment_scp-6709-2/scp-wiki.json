Here is an excerpt.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Dr. Longo:** So... let’s talk about your origins. Where do you all come from?\n\n**6709-A-25:** You don't know? We thought you did.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** //Us?// You're talking about the Foundation?\n\n**6709-A-25:** Oh, no, no, no. You. People, folks, inhabitants, humans, you get me?\n\n**Dr. Longo:** Not that I'm aware of.\n\n**6709-A-25:** Ah. You created us.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** How were you created? Some sort of ritual, or...?\n\n**6709-A-25:** Nothing barbaric like that. Folks thought about us, so here we are.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** They //thought// about you?\n\n**6709-A-25:** Well, yes.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** And since you come from human minds...\n\n**6709-A-25:** ...we were made in the image of your fables.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** I still don’t understand. People thinking about you made you real?\n\n**6709-A-25:** Indeed.\n\n**Dr. Longo:** Why did they think about you?\n\n**6709-A-25:** Only if I knew...\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**6709-A-25:** I mean, your minds creating us with only to put sticks between the spokes of those Oneiroi doesn't seem that //magnificent//. If I were you I’d worry.\n\n(//Dr. Longo suddenly stands up, picking up the various documents on the table. He quickly organizes them and turns to the instance.//)\n\n**Dr. Longo:** I have to end this interview early. Thank you very much, A-25, you're free to go.\n[[/div]]\n\nTo recap: despite whatever the Collective's purpose in Italy is, the entire local human collective subconscious has been working on modifying the reality outside the noosphere to combat them and unintentionally taking the legends of Italian folklore as \"inspiration\". This information should not be taken lightly and should be immediately investigated upon. It is imperative to prevent the Collective from acting completely undisturbed, knowing what they are capable of and knowing that even subconsciously we deem it malignant. We run risks of seemingly-peaceful Collectives residing in the dream world: imagine the catastrophe if something were to happen to the network of the free port of Cannae. You have seen the data sent by the Croatian branch, haven't you? We can't allow another incident like Zagrobnika to happen. I'll send you the technical details later but currently I'd like to know what you think of a possible //ad hoc// project. The members will be chosen exclusively by me: the last thing we need is for someone to misappropriate a group brave enough to want to attack the human psyche itself.\n\n- Doctor Solei.  \n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n[[<]]\n**From:** Director Nicola Rossi\n**To:** Doctor Marta Solei\n**Subject:** RE: Interview Excerpt\n-----\nGood evening.\n\nI thank you for the information received. I am fully aware of the danger that the Oneiroi Collective poses -- the last time we underestimated it, humanity couldn't sleep for five whole minutes: we were unbelievably //lucky// the Veil didn't fall apart. I'll gather the O5 Council shortly to discuss this, but you have permission to form a team of the best nootic researchers. Consider the project utterly exigent.\n\nBest regards,\nDirector Nicola Rossi.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n##red|input: Sent.##\n> {{Email sent.}}\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=true | last=false | hub=no\n| previous-url=/ | previous-title=\n| next-url=/fanasia | next-title=#Fanasìa\n| hub-url=/ | hub-title=Suspicious Minds\n]]",
