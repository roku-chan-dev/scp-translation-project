Instead, they’re sourced from a veritable battalion of autonomous telemetry drones, which scour the surface of this planet and other Basal Worlds like it, compiling data. Responsibility for deciphering said data is handed off at the crossroads of a half-dozen Outpost-327 Sections.\n\nXenocartography—the Section I fall under—carries the burden of this task. We’re set to work interpreting the data, mining it for working geospatial information, isolating risks, and parcelling out those risks to the proper Sections. And there’s risks aplenty. When dealing with islands of reality governed by non-standard paraphysics, that’s to be expected. Entire, previously non-existent scientific fields find their incipiency at Macrocosmic Outposts. Entire fields that dissolve if you so much as travel one fermi outside their inexplicable domains.\n\nEach telemetry drone we deploy is a fearsome host of technological ingenuity. Not sapient—not quite sentient, either—but with wisdom beyond its programming, and none of the trepidation of its programmers. As will soon make itself known, however, no drone is ever truly insulated from human interaction.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n+++ __ANNOTATED A/V LOG__\n@@ @@\n= {{**[ BEGIN LOG ]**}}\n[[table class=\"dialog\"]]\n\n  [[row]]\n    [[hcell]]\n    [[/hcell]]\n    [[cell]]\n**MÍM-0** exits a portal aperture at a high velocity, completing a successful transit.\n    [[/cell]]\n  [[/row]]\n\n  [[row]]\n    [[hcell]]\nMORGAN\n    [[/hcell]]\n    [[cell class=\"research comment active multiline\"]]\nAlready have an issue.

They’re the canned air we breathe and the preservative-laden spreads that we slather our bread with.\n\n[[div class=\"indented end-mark\"]]\nBecause, when I talk about Narratives, what I refer to is the tapestry that lays a protective barrier between us and certain obliteration at the cusp of material reality. If you think I’m waxing poetic, I’m really not. Out here, in the wastes of the Cosmos, the Narratives we weave are a pillar that helps undergird our very existence.\n\nStill having trouble imagining it? I can’t blame you. If you work for The Foundation, this is probably the first time you’ve even heard of us.\n\nI’ll start from the beginning.\n\n@@ @@\n\n++++ 1 [[span style=\"color: var(--textColorAlt)\"]]The Inner-Space Race[[/span]]\n\nWould you believe me if I said austerity ended the Space Race?\n\nMaybe that’s overly cynical. Without a doubt, though, the interplanetary explorations during the time of the Apollo 11 Lunar Landing were achieved in spite of, and not because of, the strict funding of the moment. That same year, NASA received its thinnest, most austerely imposed budgetary arrangement of the entire 1960s. Harsh government budgets led to riskier projects, overburdened researchers, and more unpredictable results. Yet only by appeasing disinterested bureaucrats could you ever reap the rewards that arise from scientific endeavour.\n\nThe Foundation—which, itself, was downstream of the funding coming from the United States Congress at the time—learned this the hard way. In 1968, as was then-infamously said:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote simple larger\" style=\"border-color: var(--fgColor); text-indent: 0\"]]\nEvery quarter put forward for scientific advancement is one measly penny—or two, when the tides are //really// rising—coughed up for the parascience R&D drive.\n\n[[>]]\n— Dr. Trinity Steyer-Lumley\n//Foundation Interplanetary Phenomena Division//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd this was by no means exceptional. The Foundation found no such luck obtaining funding in the Soviet Union either, where they had their own brand of pathologically motivated austerity.\n\nIn truth, the real Space Race was held entirely outside the public eye. When funding fizzled out, The Foundation parried the gut-punch and turned inwards. Inner-Space, as it were.\n\nThe Cosmos knows deeper bounds than the Universe, which is but one small part. An important part, mind you—but a part. It’s one in a vast constellation of puzzle pieces which form a broader Macrocosm. Almost all of them invariably orbit the Universe, given its utter immensity. Many are chaotic sub-realities only half-conceived. Some rare few hurtle into the ever-present All-Fire, where they lose -versal coherence and rend apart at Planck-scale, returning to nonexistence. It’s likely that there are some others still, floating transiently over a theoretical substratum dubbed “**[[[void-dancer-hub|The Void]]]**”. We have no means of knowing what number of those Floaters exist, given we have no means of accessing them.\n\nThe Foundation began ahead of the curve. We had already laid the infrastructure for a robust Macrocosmic research project—“SIGHTSEER”—a full decade before the creation of NASA. Beginning shortly after the Second World War, this task required an interdisciplinary operation involving our then-most sophisticated resources.\n\nOther groups would join us in the fray: The full might of the Global Occult Coalition; the elusive Prometheus; desperate thaumaturgists’ guilds searching for the Wanderer’s Library; and a handful of occult initiatives funded by dark money. None could match our head-start.\n\nCome the late 1950s, when the Space Race had gone full-tilt, Foundation resources were slowly siphoned towards that riper pasture. SIGHTSEER was virtually abandoned for some time. Decades later, after the Space Race had transmogrified into an austere molasses, the Inner-Space Race continued.\n\nBy then, we were the sole sprinters. It was no surprise: The Macrocosm proves a //much// less desirable frontier than most.\n\nBefore I move on, it’s important to settle the debate. What we are concerned with is //not// the Multiverse. Only outrageously expensive blockbusters have shown any interest in that concept of late. It might exist, but if it does, we want nothing to do with it. What we’re concerned with is the Macrocosm—an unseen and snaking ecosystem waiting just outside reality. A deep sea of existence only accessible by anomalously bending spacetime ‘til you can expose its hyperdimensional underbelly, then pierce it right through.\n\n@@ @@\n\n++++ 2 [[span style=\"color: var(--textColorAlt)\"]]Ways and Means[[/span]]\n\nWith a usable past established, you now have the tools for understanding.\n\nIn a treacherous ecology such as the Macrocosm, certain protections are of utmost necessity to traverse, live, and thrive out here. There are numerous physical and paraphysical ways of going about this. But these are not the foundations our protection is laid on.\n\nWe rely on the power of Narratives to sustain our lives.\n\nIn the past decade or so, a select cadre of whitecoats have theorized automated models that could carry out the same results. Some computer-based noöspheric buffer zone that a technician would tune to a specific volume. It’s as much theoretical as it is //deeply annoying.// By faking it, you miss the bigger picture. Our Narratives need to be every bit as honest as we can muster. Anything less wouldn’t keep //us// honest. And honesty is workplace policy.\n\nThis Outpost was built inside a Tangent—the name for any offshoot reality passing through the flux of the Macrocosm. Here in the wastes, we can’t rely on the Universe to continue surviving. Simply existing doesn’t cut it; we need to reassert our existence in perpetuity, otherwise the exotic reality all around us will reject us quicker than a jaded lover.\n\nConsider this. Of our 150-member staff, each is an individual—unique—with their own worldview and temperament; their own custom and creed; their own set of feelings and aspirations. The Cosmos recognizes the individual as a constituent aspect of a collective, no less important than the bonds among matter.\n\nThus: Personal Truths function as fasteners. Biographical mosaics as anchors. Each person—a structural member. The social fabric—concrete.\n\nEvery single aspect of our lives becomes strengthened by a continual reassertion of our personal values. Completeness becomes an equal parts passive and active affair. Per the former, we recognize a simple parapharmaceutical solution—a prescription of twice-daily medication that bolsters your memome expression.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] [[span class=\"bt bb\"]]memome[[/span]] The complete set of memes that make up a sapient entity's identity and consciousness. Equivalent to a genome.[[/span]] As for the latter: Meditation, physical fitness, reading good books and eating good foods. When we strengthen our vitality and enrich our lives, each individual increases the avowal of their personal Narrative.\n\nNext, we form deep, lasting friendships; sing Kumbaya—\n\nWe become storytellers, and create myths about ourselves as a people. As a community. Our Narratives are both real and… woven. Not fake, because every story we tell about ourselves shields against our own obliteration. It is a matter of protection against this foreign ideatic environment that is hostile to our very existence. It is of utmost necessity to combat, on an intrinsic level, this environment and the entities that lurk within it. So, we keep a coherent history, and nurture our shared mythology. Our very own Mythopoeia Section are shepherds to the flock.\n\nBut we share in these stories, each of us. Encoded in our minds as though in our cells. Stories project our existence outside ourselves, shaping and reshaping our reality in tangible ways. When hardships fall or disasters strike, these are continuations of our existing Threads—rewoven into slightly different outcomes each time.\n\nEach time we come here, we’re here for a 365-day cycle. There are probes that return to the Universe and relay items, both ways, but taking the jaunt on your own is extremely risky. And sending a Macrocosmic shuttle is costly. And I stress—our Outpost is, like any other, a community. That’s where its power lives.\n\nBecause Inner-Space is inside us all.\n\n@@ @@\n\n++++ 3 [[span style=\"color: var(--textColorAlt)\"]]A Knot in the Thread[[/span]]\n\nOn the Sunday before last, local date 26 April 2020, we synchronized with reality for one last time. Around midday, we received our final probe. When the probes stopped coming through, our supervisors thought it was dire. It could have even meant catastrophe.\n\nEventually, bad news would come.\n\nThe Veil burst. We don’t have all the details, but projects like ours are being kept quiet until the dust settles. The Masquerade being dealt a blow with enough force to tear it right down could mean any number of potential things. An Occult War, as The Foundation tries desperately to stitch the pieces back together. The end of the current status quo—of relative Normality with a wool over the world’s blind eyes, for better or for worse—and the fundamental shocks that usher in the new one. Or The Foundation, now cast as pariah. A whole bunch of rightfully angry people out there, beating down the doors of every Site.\n\nWho can say?\n\nThis is the start of a new Thread.

Inevitability—as you had warned.\n\nThere is a junior researcher by the name Morgan Lloyd. You would know her by her elder brother, Samuel, our invaluable [[[scp-3856|K-Class bellwether]]]. In a bout of well-spent overtime, she came across our log buoy in B2N7Q before response teams could conceal the territory. Overwatch censors even overlooked her report; she knew better than to publish.\n\nI still cannot rule out who discovered this data and dropped it into her lap. I have teams looking into that. But she did not call it in; instead, she unearthed a lead and investigated. Thank our lucky stars it was her alone who found this. In more favourable circumstances, this could even be cause for promotion.\n\nI attached the “Narrative Thread” that she created. We can readily discern through context clues that key info from her report crops up, masked by her own half-truths. She made an official request to send a copy to on-the-ground Foundationers. I have made efforts to stifle this request as quickly and as quietly as my directorship allows.\n\nWe cannot jeopardize our privileged place in this new order.\n\nIt does seem our little fiction about “Narrative Threads”—especially that line tossed in about “increasing the avowal of your personal narrative”—has done wonders for project morale. SIGHTSEER will continue this path, and reap whatever benefits secrecy and camaraderie get us.\n\nDiscipline will not be necessary. My staff are a people that rely on mutual trust, and her punishment would only lead to protest. No; she will be of use to us yet.\n\nFor now, we take an oath of silence.
