Civilians exiting SCP-6278 are to be monitored as part of the Temporal Displacement Programme, with the possibility of detention, memory alteration and relocation in cases of poor societal integration.\n\nFollowing Incident 6278-2, Foundation staff are no longer able to enter SCP-6278. Alternate methods of detaining SCP-6278-1 are being considered.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6278 is a diner located at 189 72nd Street, Brooklyn, NYC. The diner is identified by a large neon sign saying \"Welcome to Marvin's!\" across the front entrance.\n\nSCP-6278 was first opened in 1949 by Marvin G. Morris (1921-1979), a former carpet salesman and sailor in the US Navy during the Second World War. SCP-6278 closed in 1963 due to a lack of business. No further references to SCP-6278 or 189 72nd Street exist after this point; it is omitted on all maps of the area and not mentioned in deeds of sale, city planning records or legal documents. Despite this, the diner is well-known among residents, and the Foundation has collated several oral reports about SCP-6278 stretching back as far as 1969.\n\nThe interior of SCP-6278 is reminiscent of a typical American diner of the mid-to-late 1950s. However, visitors to the diner have reported a wide variety of different views from the building's windows, as well as many patrons who reportedly \"do not belong\". Preliminary Foundation observations have noticed several figures wearing unusual clothing emerging from the building.\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Exploration Log 6278-1\" hide=\"-Exploration Log 6278-1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nPersonnel: Agent Angelo Parisi and Junior Agent John Svensson\n\nDate: 29/10/2021\n\n//<Begin Log>//\n\n//The cameras open on a small, 1950s-style diner.

Morris\" hide=\"-Biographical report on Marvin G. Morris\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nMorris was born in the town of Rapid Falls in northern Wisconsin in 1921. His father, John Morris (1884-1933), was a carpet salesman from Kenosha, Wisconsin. He married Martha Benvik, of Michigan, in 1910; they had five children in all, of which Marvin was the youngest.\n\n Little information exists about Marvin's early life. His school reports describe an entirely average boy, who performed unspectacularly in most subjects, although he did have some degree of mathematical talent and was noted as a strong swimmer. At age 16, he began working in his father's carpet store, the only of the Morris children to do so; the others had all left Wisconsin by this point.\n\n His father died in 1938, and Marvin took over the running of the store for the next four years until he enlisted for the US Navy in early 1942. A letter recovered from his older brother Jeb indicates that the family was surprised by this, as Marvin had never shown any kind of patriotic feeling before; it is believed probable that the carpet store was failing at this time, and Marvin consequently needed a different source of income. He performed with distinction aboard the USS Harbinger, receiving the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for unspecified actions during the Battle of Midway.\n\n Marvin moved to New York City in 1946, and worked as a sales representative at Woolworths for three years. In 1949, his mother died, and he inherited a large sum of money which he used to establish SCP-6278. In 1953, he married Maisie Hollis, with whom he had two children, Arthur and Martha.\n\n Marvin is known to have been an active and engaged member of the local community, serving on a church board and being involved with several charitable foundations. He was particularly known for his lobbying efforts on behalf of the district's homeless population, leading to several confrontations with elected officials. Rumours abounded, however, of his involvement in payoffs and minor corruption; none of these stories were ever confirmed, however.\n\n The diner is reported to have done well throughout the 1950s, but a second letter in Jeb's collection indicates financial problems in the early 1960s. The diner closed in 1964; an unsigned bill of sale was found in Marvin's former residence. This is the last known documentation concerning 189 72nd Street.\n\n Marvin's later life is obscured. He was apparently working as an employee at another carpet store in 1967, but nothing further is known. Maisie died in 1968 of food poisoning, and Marvin's disappearance was reported by his children in 1970. A death certificate was registered in New Orleans in 1979, but its authenticity is unknown.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+Exploration Log 6278-2\" hide=\"-Exploration Log 6278-2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n Personnel: Agent Angelo Parisi and Junior Agent John Svensson\n\n Date: 04/11/2021\n\n//<Begin Log>//\n\n//The agents have just entered the diner.

The men in black?\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Not quite.\n\n**Agent Parisi:** But do we know a few things.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Mr. Morris, can I ask you about the events of 1964?\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Well, sure, Mr. Svensson. But I don't know what you want me to say. This diner's been here forever; the 60s were a decade like any other. Quite a quiet one, from behind this counter. Always counting change to see if I can survive for one more season.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Sure. But - well, our records state that your diner went bust in 1964, and yet here it stands.\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Do they? Well, well. Fancy that. I'm afraid I can't help you there - all I remember about 1964 was that Kennedy was shot. Or was that 63?\n\n**Agent Parisi:** It was 63.\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, I'm getting old.

Analysis of SCP-6278-1's life after the diner's closure reveal a man with considerably dimished fortunes and capacity for self-control, leading to the abandonment of his children and a premature death. That SCP-6278-1 would choose to live in the past, at a time when he possessed a degree of wealth and prestige, fits well with the psychological profile prepared by Dr. Obadiah prior to our investigations.\n\n The second theory is that SCP-6278-1 is an imposter. His reticence to answer questions relating to his family and his apparent familiarity with individuals from multiple time zones is unusual for someone who supposedly disappeared over 50 years ago. Very little personal information has been given out over the course of our interviews, and his M.O. seems unusual, as he is evidently involved in temporal trafficking.\n\n Many questions are raised by these theories, and a great deal of further research is needed, but these at least seem like profitable avenues of inquiry. As per Dr. Obadiah's instructions, we will be pursuing them in future explorations.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+Log of community reports of SCP-6278 and SCP-6278-1, compiled by Junior Agent Svensson\" hide=\"-Log of community reports of SCP-6278 and SCP-6278-1, compiled by Junior Agent Svensson\"]]\n||~ Reporter & age at time||~ Date and nature of report||~ Information provided||\n||Marjorie Cartwright, 63||Police report, 1989||Cartwright, a homeless woman, was arrested on suspicion of drug possession.

SCP-6278 was chosen as a low-risk anomaly where he could \"cut his teeth\", so to speak.\n  \nHowever, his actions have demonstrated a failure to live up to Foundation professionalism. Our agreed upon strategy, based on Dr. Obadiah's preliminary psychological profile of SCP-6278-1, was to ask probing, off-kilter questions in an effort to disconcert and confuse him, hoping to catch him off his guard. While this did not yield as many results as expected, Agent Svensson's actions did not help. He was initially too inflexible when it came to protocol in an unexpected situation, before later asking a series of questions and taking an approach that was not part of our broad strategy.\n\nIncident 6278-1 has demonstrated conclusively that Agent Svensson lacks the temperament for this kind of work. He made an unauthorised visit to SCP-6278 last night, revealing key parts of our strategy to SCP-6278-1 in a clumsy attempt to get information. He continues to pursue leads non-congruent to our current approach, with little regard for the avenues his side-investigations may close for our primary investigations.\n\nAdditionally, last week's discovery of an NYPD cold case from 1945 concerning the body of Jack Macintyre had a particularly startling effect on Agent Svensson. He seemed taken aback, becoming withdrawn and sullen during work hours, negatively impacting morale across the team. The uncertain circumstances of Macintryre's death naturally had an impact on all of us, but not nearly to the extent seen in Svensson.\n\nIn short, I am recommending his immediate transfer back to Maine. We wish him well, but do not feel he is suited for this type of fieldwork.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+Incident Log 6278-2\" hide=\"-Incident Log 6278-2\"]]\n\nOn 10/12/2021, the day before his scheduled departure for Maine, Agent Svensson used his still-valid credentials to gain access to SCP-6278. He was inebriated at the time, but turned his microcamera on shortly after entering.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<Begin Log>//\n\n//The camera shows SCP-6278 at night. It is very late, and the street outside is empty; a single flickering streetlight is visible. Two Native American men wearing Lenape clothing from the late 16th century are heading towards the door, leaving shortly afterwards. There are no other patrons. Marvin can be seen behind the counter, cleaning a glass.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome t- oh. Agent Svensson. I'm - I'm afraid we're closed right now.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Yeah, I know. You gonna - heh - gonna call the cops on me, Marv?\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** ...I don't think so, Mr. Svensson. I think you oughtta sit down.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Yeah. Yeah, good idea.\n\n//Agent Svensson sits at the countertop. Without taking his eyes off him, SCP-6278-1 takes a slice of cheesecake from a display counter and places it in front of Agent Svensson.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Here you are. Something to help you so- uh, well, something that might help.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Cheers, Marv. You're a decent sort, you know that? None of them believe it, but I do.\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Well, that's- that's real nice to hear, Mr. Svensson.\n\n//Agent Svensson starts eating the cheesecake. SCP-6278-1 slowly starts eating the cake.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** So I'll tell you what I think.\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Ah, God...\n\n**Agent Svensson:** I keep going over it over and over again. Why here? What's here that you want? You don't seem like too much of a sentimental guy. Why take this place out of time, why stop it from showing up on any documents?\n\n//Agent Svensson takes a bite of cheesecake, chews it and swallows.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** So I got to thinking. None of your motives make sense, unless... unless you're not the one who took it out of time. You just reclaimed it when it was all gone.\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** You're a smart kid. You don't need to keep going down this rabbit hole.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Don't I? Whatcha gonna do, old man? Watch me. Watch me fucking //soar.//\n\n//The window darkens. When it emerges again, it opens on a wooded area. A distant plume of smoke can be seen in the difference.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** When's this, then? Which era is this? Which time are you gonna ply me with now?\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** 1587. Before this place was anything.\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Ah, I see! Showing me the sights, eh?\n\n//Agent Svensson gets up and walks to the window. He looks at the photos over the top. They show groups of people from several centuries, mostly smiling. Some are wearing fashions unfamiliar to Foundation historians.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** Your whole smiling crew. You let anyone who wants to come in here do so. To share, exchange, leave again... you're a good guy. Always looking out for people. But you don't seem to care about how happy they end up being. Where their bodies end up. Keeping everyone happy and dancing so they don't see what's beneath...\n\n//Svensson takes a photo from the wall. It shows an unsmiling Jack sitting at the counter.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** I wonder if you're trying to do something good, Marv. I wonder if you found a way to shove your diner back into the hole it left behind because, without it, there was a hole. A hole in time, in reality. A hole in what you believed was real.\n\n//The window darkens again. A faint, dark sludge can be seen congealing at the corners.//\n\n**Agent Svensson:** A hole, that could contain anything... and what did you do? You papered over the problem. Just keep it together. Keep them smiling. Keep them singing your praises, too, because that's what you a-\n\n//The camera is suddenly jerked out of Svensson's uniform, and hits the floor some feet away. SCP-6278-1 is hitting him over the head with the baseball bat from over the bar. He does this several times, before he stops, breathing heavily.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** God, I...\n\n//SCP-6278-1 drops the bat. He is crying.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Can't let them know. Can't let anyone know.\n\n//SCP-6278-1 sits at the counter, breathing heavily. After several minutes, he gets up, grabs Svensson's body and drags it to the door.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Just for one more season, until you can find a way to make it //stop//...\n\n//SCP-6278-1 pushes Svensson's body out of the diner. He goes into the kitchen, comes out with a mop, and spends half an hour cleaning the blood from the floor of the diner. He returns to the kitchen, emerging again after a few minutes in clean clothes. He checks the area where Svensson was killed carefully, but does not see the microcamera.//\n\n//He closes his eyes for several seconds, before returning to the counter. The view outside the window changes to the early 1960s. He suddenly smiles, and the door opens.//\n\n**SCP-6278-1:** Welcome to Marvin's! Can I take your order?\n\n//The feed cuts out.//\n\n//<End Log>//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6277]]] | SCP-6278 | [[[SCP-6279]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Tufto]]\n> **Filename:** harbingerpic.jpg\n> **Name:** Restaurant cook, Seattle, 1954.jpg\n> **Author:** Seattle Municipal Archives\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Restaurant_cook,_Seattle,_1954.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
