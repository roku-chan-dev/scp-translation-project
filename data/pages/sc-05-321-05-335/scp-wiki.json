But it's not new ones you forge for them, are they?\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** That takes too much time. Were I on the throne it would be different. This way weeks, or days if I settle for sloppy, need to be spent to give one Fae a new name which would fulfil them for life. Not something half-baked that is only marginally better than the hell they're currently in.\n\n**##purple|\"So you bargain with the Wild Hunt instead.

But in reality, a broken name isn't that easily reforged. First, you have to find the right parts and then the name might not even fit anymore. The Shifting makes sport of the nameless, shifting their identities around. You know it yourself with your right eye all greyed out, only the other left with royal purple. Still, it is faster than forging the names anew. I have to settle for that if I want to bring names to all.\n\n**##purple|\"Not without an influx of loyal Fae and the new claim that brings with it, I might say.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** Oh, spare me that. I could easily give all who desire it a name dependent on me, like my brother thought I would, like whoever wins this likely will, to secure their claim. The nameless are desperate. They'd take any name in a heartbeat, not knowing that they would still be trapped. Just like you are.\n\n//(giggles)// **##purple|\"What makes you think I'm trapped? Are you so easily fooled to think that my situation is truly dire? Still here in your custody, I stand with more claim to the Throne of Spring than you.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** Oh, as it stands I won't be winning. I'm not denying that.  **##c29b0c|The only one of us who played this game before##** does not deign to look at me, they've ignored me from the start. I will save as many as I can. It won't be enough, but I'll do what I can. That does mean helping you as well.\n\n**##purple|\"You have already granted me sanctuary, no further help is needed.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** Not the contest. Do you know all the ways one would gain a name again?\n\n**##purple|\"The easy way is to do as## ##green|the trees their long rules twisted## ##purple|provides. Trick someone out of their name and steal their identity, or voluntarily relinquish your name as I did.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** Yes. What a mercy. The other way is to trick the rules or overpower them. According to my late master, these rules once served to protect those who stood before the Spring Court of Old in special cases where they would be too weak to protect their name. Mab just dug out these old rules and twisted them for her purpose. They were never meant to lock out a Namesmith.\n\n**##purple|\"If you want to promise me a name I fear the Spring Throne has you far outbid.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** I wouldn't be so sure. See, there are other ways to go past these rules. Did you know that the Spring Court of Old was once a temple?\n\n**##purple|\"Bits and pieces of it you can find wandering here still.\"##**\n\n**Irvald:** But it is mainly forest. And what are the main ways people refer to this place, but never the same way thrice or they'd be punished? **##green|The forest. The woods. The trees. The grove.##** And that is its identity. With Mab's hold weakening it becomes ever easier to push through. Now, might there be a name that people associate you with? A title that each person referring to you would have uttered once, twice, but never thrice? And that by so many people that it would push through Mabs web? Would you rather not have a new name than be trapped by one imposed on you?\n\n**##purple|\"I thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid I must cut my visit short.
