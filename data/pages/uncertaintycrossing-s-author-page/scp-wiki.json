Retired now, he's in the middle of packing up his belongings as he clears out his office. Scattered across the desk in front of him are piles of paperwork, files, and various reports, along with a [[[uncertaintycrossing-s-art-page |familiar looking folder]]]. With a small sigh he looks up at you.\n@@ @@\n\"Here for the reports?\" He hands you a different folder than the one you recognized. \"Everything I've written is in this. Look through it at your leisure.\"\n@@ @@\nYou pick up the folder and see it's divided into various tabs. As you look at what's scribbled on the cover - some writing and the symbol of an eye - Basar continues speaking.\n@@ @@\n\"Well. Maybe reports is a generous term. I never did contribute to the database...\" He trails off, looking lost in thought. A former Site Director who never wrote a SCP article? Odd. You thank Basar regardless for letting you take a look through the folder. He gives you a polite nod as he returns to packing.\n@@ @@\nDo you take a look inside?\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tales]]\nThis section is filled with things Basar has written. They're mostly horror themed, you find. Not too surprising, given the work Basar does at the Foundation. \n----\n\n||~ Title ||~ Information ||\n|| [[[serus | ]]] || //There were 36 of us once. A collaboration with anonymous.// ||\n|| [[[the-hills-of-adelanto-are-covered-in-a-cinnabar-green | ]]]  || //For the 2020 Canon contest. A collaboration with [[*user Sebarus]].// ||\n|| [[[the-library-cries-in-ultramarine-blue | ]]] || //Also for the 2020 Canon contest, a continuation of the above tale.// ||\n|| [[[the-eleven-fifty-nine | ]]] || //The train comes for us all. A collaboration with [[*user Sebarus]]// ||\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Artwork]]\nThere's a little bit of overlap here from the previous section - it seems Basar really enjoys including artwork in his written works. \n----\n\n||~ Title ||~ Information ||\n|| [[[uncertaintycrossing-s-art-page | ]]] || //The familiar folder from earlier, and the page that started it all.// ||\n|| [[[serus | ]]] || //There were 36 of us once. A collaboration with anonymous.// ||\n|| [[[april-fools-2021 | ]]] || //A crayon filled mess. Owlpede would be proud.// ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:fanart-of-the-eleven-fifty-nine Fanart of the Eleven Fifty-Nine] || //The Gatekeeper gets a hold of a Parawatch file. Based on the collaboration with [[*user Sebarus]].// ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:act-of-creation Act of Creation] || //Stained red from Warpaint. Based on the tale by [[*user Rounderhouse]].// ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:arachis-statuary Arachis Statuary] || //Just a kid playing games.  [[[Remixcon2023]]] entry of [[[SCP-173]]]// ||\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Staff Work]]\nHere you find mostly bureaucratic work. Again - bit of overlap. Basar really focuses on art related policy, doesn't he? \n----\n\n||~ Title ||~ Information ||\n|| [[[april-fools-2021 | ]]] || //A crayon filled mess. Owlpede would be proud.// ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:crayon Crayon Theme] || //A part of the crayon filled mess mentioned above. Collaboration with [[*user stormbreath]]// ||\n|| [[[how-to-post-your-art-to-the-scp-wiki | ]]] || //To help other artists who may be struggling.//||\n|| [[[wanderers-library-hub | ]]] || //Owlpede is actually featured in this one. Collaboration with the WL staff team.// ||\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Elsewhere...]]\nThis section is comprised of sticky-notes and pages ripped out of an address book. They again seem haphazardly shoved in for Basar's convenience more than your own. \n----\n\n//If looking for the Gatekeeper - an entity of uncertainty that makes its home in the Wanderer's Library, [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-gatekeeper-s-room try following its dog]. Do NOT say no if it offers you a bath. That is the way in.//\n\n//If looking for other places to find or support the creator of this page, try [https://uncertaintycrossing.carrd.co looking here].//\n\n//If the creator of this page sails off the face of the earth and can not be contacted, collaboration pieces go to their co-authors, pages in the staff section are released to staff as a whole, while solo works are under the discretion of [[*user Sebarus]].//\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]",
