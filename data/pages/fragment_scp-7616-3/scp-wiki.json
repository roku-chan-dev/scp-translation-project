One moment of doubt.\n\nWas I really gonna do this? Was I really gonna sell my soul to clear my debt?\n\nI don’t know why, but as I kneeled in front of the circle of blood, and took a shot of bourbon, it felt like I reached the point of no return.

You received my post card, but my name is Primrose Fatish. It is lovely to meet you,... Mister?...\" She asked, as if waiting for an answer. \n\n\"I-I uh...\" To be honest, I wasn't sure if she was asking for my name or if I was a Mister or a Miss, so I squeaked out a \"C-Captain Adrian.\"\n\n\"Captain Adrian,\" she nodded. \"It is a pleasure. I could not find a record of a last name. Am I to presume that you do not have one? I just wish to be sure... Please, sit with me. Your knees look weak, did you prepare any drinking water?\"\n\n\"I have bourbon,\" I collected myself, about to take my seat.\n\n\"Alcohol does not hydrate. Additionally, right now it can lead to worsened cramps, and mood swings from hormonal imbalances. I //highly// recommend water. I can provide some, if you do not have any on standby.\"\n\n\"N-no, I wouldn't want you poisoning me, or anything, I'll get it.\"\n\nI saw a flicker in her eye after I said that. Not like she wanted to hurt me; more like //I offended her.// She looked like she wanted to say something, but was holding back. \n\n\"Very well. I will just ready the paperwork for you in the meantime. Do you mind if I smoke?\" A short stack of papers and a quill pen appearing in her hand as I walked over to the sink.\n\n“Sure, go ahead… Sorry. You uh… deserve more hospitality than that. It’s just… you’re a //demon,// ya know? I’m still kinda reeling from this,\" I admitted, filling my glass under the tap.\n\n“Apology accepted. And yes, I am a demon, an archdemon specifically,\" She admitted flatly, pulling out a cigarette from her coat pocket. \"I understand making first contact with the supernatural can be shocking, so I take extra effort to ensure you are aware of the terms of any deal we make. But, I am sure you have metaphysical and logistical questions. I am willing to answer them.”\n\nShe was right. I had questions, and even if I didn't take a deal, I'm never going to look at life the same way. I breathed in, bracing myself as I walked back to the table. “So… okay, is the Bible true?”\n\n“It is mostly not. It touches on a lot of concepts that are analogous to the YHWHist afterlife, such as the existence of Inferno, where I hail from, and Paradiso where YHWH and his angels reside. Of course, not everything is as described. Otherwise the Earth would be flat.“ A small flame appeared on the tip of her thumb as she said that. She put the butt to her lips, and lit, as if waiting for my next question.\n\n“Okay, well, what about this YHWH guy, is he... ya know... God?”\n\n“He is the god of what you call the 'Abrahamic' faiths specifically,\" she corrected, shaking her head once. ”There are multiple pantheons and afterlives. Religions and gods not even present on your living world. YHWH makes claim that he is the sole creator of existence and all other gods are merely false idols. I //highly// doubt that, personally speaking, as do many other gods. However, he is still a major superpower in the spiritual plane and thus many are forced to kowtow to his will.\" \n\n“Well, fuck, I can tell I'm already over my head. Alright, what's //Inferno// like? I mean, if I’m going there, I should know, yeah?”\n\n“It largely depends on which circle you arrive at. When a mortal dies and goes to Hell, they start the month-long process of transformation from a mortal soul to a full fledged demon. A mortal would find Inferno’s weather absolutely horrid and virtually unlivable, but for a //demon,// it is actually quite nice.\" She took a long drag of her cigarette and breathed out.\n\n\"You are currently on the track for the 7th circle, my home. I cannot say that existence is //easy// in Inferno, especially in the 7th circle,\" She shook her head and gave me a long, sad look. \"Wealth inequality is high, the corporate Dukes have carved most of the circle up amongst themselves and the threat of another millennia long civil war is always around the corner.\" \n\n“... Shit, lady, that's fuckin' depressing...\" I sighed. This was a whole lot to take in all at once.\n\nAfter a few puffs of her cigarette, she started to write our terms. It must've been pretty boilerplate for her, since she was writing things down at miles a minute.\n\n\"I apologize, but it is better for you to find out sooner rather than later.\" She gave me a sympathetic look and handed me her lit cigarette.\n\nI reached over and took a drag. The cigarette was a lot like her, classy and refined. It tasted good.\n\n\"So... if I sign my soul away to you, what happens?”\n\n“Well, that is //if// you decide to sell your soul to me. I have other payment options in mind, if that makes you more comfortable. //If// you do, I would most likely either consume it directly for sustenance and power or have it minted as Łucre which is the main currency we use in hell.”\n\n\"Wait, hold the fuck up, you can like... mint me as //money?\"//\n\n\"Well, your //soul,// yes.\"\n\n\"... Okay, what would you buy with me? What would your Adrian bucks get ya.\"\n\nShe stared at me and thought for a moment.\n\n\"I- uh- I could take my brother out to dinner? I apologize I cannot quite think of anything on the spot.\"\n\n\"... Is it a fancy restaurant at least? Michelin Stars and all that shit?\"\n\n\"If it would make you feel any better, then yes. I would spend your 'Adrian bucks' as you put it on a week of gourmet dinners for me and my older half-brother.\"\n\n\"Sweet!\" I take another puff of the cigarette. \"... Is your brother hot?\"\n\nPrimrose blinked and looked at me with her mouth agape. \"I-... I am not even sure how to respond to that. I mean... I //guess?\"//\n\n\"Nice, nice.\" I kick my legs up on the table and lean back in my chair. \"So, you'd be fine with me repaying you in other ways? Like, what exactly? I obviously don't have money, otherwise I wouldn't be in this situation.\"\n\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7616/Primrose.png style=\"width:330px;\"]]\n\"Your body after death is an option with minimal consequence. Human meat is a delicacy, and the rights to your meat is... appetizing.\" She licked her lips, before snapping back into the real world. \"Apologies. Now of course, if you were to accept this, I can not kill you. Nor can I make attempts to shorten your life. It is actually in my best interest to keep you healthy, as that leads to higher quality meat.\"\n\nI blinked. She was certainly being honest. \"I... guess that's fair, in a twisted, cracked up way. So, what EXACTLY am I getting from this? Are you going to settle my debt?\"\n\n\"I suggest something better than just a mere loan: the power to generate high profit, while cutting your main expenditure. How would you feel about guaranteed revenue? I propose that, once a day, the first game you partake in on this vessel will turn out favorably. However, the rest of the games from then on out will be losses. All you would have to do is play one high-stakes game a day, and nothing else after that.\"\n\nI raised my brow. \"If you can manipulate the odds like that, why not make it two games? Or all my games?\"\n\n\"Because that would draw attention to yourself. Additionally, you are in this situation from gambling and alcohol consumption. Giving you guaranteed wins from limited play is a good way to ween you off.\"\n\n\"So, wait, you're trying to get me off gambling //and drinking// too? Why? I don't even have that bad of a drinking problem.\"\n\n\"No, I would not say that you have a //drinking// problem precisely. But, well, I would like you to recall every time that you have gambled, win or lose.\"\n\n\"Sure, alright.\"\n\n\"Can you recall even a //single moment// where you //were not drinking// while gambling?\"\n\n\"... I, uh...\"\n\nI never really gave it much thought until she brought it up but I had to admit, she had me there.\n\n\"... I do not think you are an alcoholic, Adrian. But every time you played, you drank, and that enabled your most impulsive instincts to 'win big' rather than do something sensible like //stopping.\"//\n\n\"So, what, do I have to give up drinking forever then?\"\n\n\"That depends, when you drink away from the tables or the slots do you feel compelled to gamble again? Please be honest.\"\n\n I scratched my chin. I really had to think deep about that.\n\n\"... No, not really. Drinkin' never made me want to gamble in the first place. It's more like... gettin' drunk //while gamblin'// gave me an excuse to keep going.\" \n\n\"Yes, I thought so. For now, temporarily, your drinking ceases until your gambling addiction is treated and the two are completely disassociated from each other.\"\n\n\"That's- okay, that's real nice of you to do but...  this's the FARTHEST thing I'd expect from a demon. Seriously, what's your game?\"\n\n\"I have not lied, if that is what you mean. This is simply the most effective way to get you on your feet again. But... Do you still have my post card?\"\n\n\"The Prim and Proper Legal Solutions one? Yeah.\" I pulled it out for her, turning it over and over between its many sides.\n\n\"Well, PPLS... does not exist. Yet. I have much of the groundwork done, but in order to proceed further, I need to leave my current job at the Infernal Revenue Service. I cannot //quit// because doing so would mean I would have to forfeit certain benefits and protections. But, if I am FIRED...\"\n\n\"You'd get to keep those benefits. And you'd accomplish that by making by giving me this bogus deal that only really benefits me //and// keeps me outta Hell. Correct?\"\n\n\"Very perceptive of you.\" She smiles and tapped some ash from her cigarette.\n\n\"So why take my body? Why not just do it for free, no strings attached?\"\n\n\"Because that would be seen as insubordination, which would put my benefits at risk. Doing an exchange for your corpse however, would show an —albeit flawed— attempt at influencing your final Judgement on my part, since any exchange with a demon is considered a cosmically evil act. Additionally, I have a recipe for chili that calls for human meat, and I would love to try it.\"\n\n\"Okay, so mostly legal bunk, and 'fine dining.' Got it... Is there anything you ain't telling me? Or just haven't gotten around to, yet?\" \n\n\"Not particularly. I get my dream by allowing you to reclaim yours. Sounds like a win-win to me. I do plan on staying here to make sure things go right, but I assure you, anything I do outside of what we discussed will not reflect on you. You are free to read through, of course.\" \n\n\"Okay...\" She handed me the contract, but just one look at it and my eyes glazed over. I just signed the thing and pretended I knew what I was doing. \"Uh, yeah. Looks good.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now, just sign here... and here... and initial here. Excellent, the deed is done.\" I half-expected the contract to disappear after I signed it, but instead, she simply split it in two, and gave me one of the halves. \n\nI couldn't help but look up at her. \"That's it?\"\n\n\"That is it. I will see you tomorrow, as I must prepare. I advise playing blackjack, as that is a game you can win with good judgement, doubling down for maximum profit is possible, and counting cards requires multiple rounds, so that could not be an accusation against you.\" She said, getting up to leave.\n\nI don't know what got me to say anything. But I felt instant regret when I signed it. I squeaked out a question. \"What did I get myself into?\"\n\n\"One of the best decisions of your life, Captain Adrian. You have my word,\" was the response she gave before she disappeared in a cloud of smoke.\n\nAll that was left was me and my thoughts, wondering whether or not her word meant anything.\n\nAnd if it was, was that better?\n\n----\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 400%]]##870F06|♥️##[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n7 of Diamonds. 7 of Clubs.

They hit for the 7 of Hearts. House goes bust at 23.\n\nEvery one of my wins have gone down exactly like that for the past couple months, and... I gotta say, Prim's strategy is working. It's free wins, but its made me so bored of playing the games that I don't even bother anymore.\n\nOutside collecting the free money, obviously. \n\nPast the first game, the dealer gets a natural 21 with an Ace and a random face card, and I barely get a chance to play. The only enjoyment I get out of any card game now is... well, my card tricks and solitaire.\n\nPrim actually got a chuckle when she saw that I started playing a few games of solitaire in my free time. \"I did make an exception for games of Solitaire, actually. So long as you do not put money on any games, I am willing to make further exceptions. Solitaire and its variants can actually be rather meditative, since it relies on more strategy than simple luck.\"\n\nWe actually started playing games with each other when I wasn't working. No stakes, just... fun. And damn if she wasn't a good player. There was a break in our conversation once, and I had to ask her. \"So, uh, Prim. I actually had a question. I noticed when I played blackjack, I'd get the same win condition. Like, down to the suits and how they're played. Is there any special meaning behind that?\"\n\n\"Hm... I do not know. Is there any special meaning behind your 'YႧA⅃ LUCK' tattoo?\"\n\nIt took me a while to piece together what she meant by that, since I was too busy figuring out how she made that sound with her mouth, but I responded eventually. \"Oh. My hand tattoo? Well, hand tattoos are kinda popular in the Family, and I figured giving tribute to Lady Luck might boost my confidence in my odds, ya know?\"\n\n\"But why inverse 'LADY'? I do have a guess, but I do not wish to assume.\"\n\nI scratched the back of my head. \"It's actually kinda embarrassing. 'Thought people might assume I might be talking about me, so I just kinda... reversed 'Lady'?

Being a slightly less drunk WINNER at the card tables... and paying off my debt to The Family. Its been about year with Prim at this point, and things were going so, SO well. I noticed that for a while, the Family's been trying to get me to play more games, and drink more booze. I participated a little, for the money. I drank a little too, but not a lot. I've been getting satisfied with just one drink, since Prim.\n\nI wasn't wastin my money anymore. The Family's debt was just a few hundred shy of paid off. Things were goin perfectly... At least till I saw what happened with the moonshine stills. The place reeked of half-brewed moonshine, I couldn't stand being in there. I had to get the family to send a cleaning crew in there to scrub it down.\n\nThe Family did NOT like hearing about that. I got pulled into Silver Dollar Sam's office, to get chewed out for it. Turns out, the stills were too messed up to be fixed, and since it happened on //my// boat, //I// was responsible for it. After getting kicked out of Chicago by the Chicago Spirit, Silver Dollar Sam wasn't willing to lose any more cash on his business ventures. \n\nThe Family told me that this equipment didn't grow on trees. They threatened to put a bullet in my head and paint the wall with my thoughts.\n\nThey said I'd better pay up. So they added another thousand to my debt and shouted me into agreeing. Guess I was still mad about it after docking, because I couldn't hide the look on my face from Prim. I told her the whole deal.\n\nHer face pointed down as she sighed. \"I was afraid this moment would come. You realize that the Family never intended for you to pay off their debt.\"\n\n\"What?\" I stared at her.\n\n\"Well, they are your employer, are they not? If they truly wanted you to pay it off efficiently, they would have taken a percentage off of your paycheck. Instead, they let you gamble and drink it away. They were likely very lenient to you whenever you lost, correct?\"\n\n\"... They were very forgiving about it, yeah.\" I admitted as the cogs started to turn.\n\n\"When you lose, your money goes right back to them, so you are nearly free labor. The debt was merely a means of keeping you under their thumb. They got a free boat captain, but what happens when you have finally finished financing your boat? You would free of them, under no obligation to work for them anymore, and able to take your business elsewhere.\"\n\n\"It's awful convenient that the stills broke, then.\"\n\n\"Indeed. This is very clearly a desperate and fairly blatant attempt to keep you under them. Likely, they had paid someone off to break the Stills, and left you to clean up the mess.\"\n\n\"...

I think what you should ask yourself, now that you have this information, is 'what are you going to do now?'\"\n\n\"... Hey, Prim. You said you could make me win every game, right? And manipulate everyone else's game? The only reason you're doing it this way is to keep our cover?\"\n\n\"Correct. As a side note, I was largely manipulating the odds of everyone else's game so the Family would overlook you.\"\n\n\"Good.

For just one hour, the house went bust. Every. Time.

And the best part was that everyone else was doing it to. In a entire hour, they lost more money than I've ever seen, stripping the House bare. It was almost a shame to break away; I still had to cash out while the getting was good.\n\nHonestly, the chaos was perfect. After I got my share, I just took my seat at the bar, watched the money bleed, and lit up a smoke. The constant \"DING-DING-DING\"s and cheers as the House got torn apart like a gazelle thrown to lions... Beautiful vengeance.\n\nPrim suggested that she go with me to pay off my debt, putting on a human face for goin out, of course, but it wasn't needed, the Family heard about what went down, and saved us the trip once we docked, about three of them. They said we should wait for people to leave, and that I should meet them at the helm. I got the feeling they knew I was behind it, somehow. It was prolly the smug smile on my face.\n\nI thought they were here for their money. It'd've been the most satisfying couple grand I've ever spent, anyway.

But when I saw their blood spill, I realized that I didn't want anyone dead yet. \"Prim!

Honestly, I didn't think she was that strong; it was like I weighed //nothing// to her. Once we got down to the engine room, she locked the door behind her. \"I counted seven of them, possibly more. They must have been prepared for resistance.\"\n\n\"D-didn't you get hit?\" I asked out of concern.\n\n\"It was a lucky shot off my guard. Thankfully I Retributionally Damned that one I spoke to, so... make that at least seven people, one injured.\" She winced, touching where the bullet hit her. She was bleeding. \"Whoever shot that bullet was definitely praying. It wasn't blessed, but that is enough to potentially kill.\"\n\nI paused. \"You gave them a warning. I've changed my mind about killing them. Do you think you can bump them off?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I can certainly try, but there's risk of death. I have been developing a counter measure for blessed bullets but it is nowhere near complete.\" \n\n\"... You said earlier that fire doesn't hurt you, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\" She tilted her head.\n\n\"I'm just thinking... They can still get in through the distillery room. We need to close that off.\" \n\n\"On it.\" She bolted off towards the adjacent room.\n\nMeanwhile, I was grabbing a rag and a bottle of moonshine. I looked over at Prim. Looks like they were just about to pile in. I grabbed my lighter, and started uncorking our stock, letting it spill to the floor. Got a bit of it on myself, but who cares?\n\n\"Adrian? What are you doing? I smell alcohol... WAIT\"\n\nI was never afraid of dying before, I was just afraid of living a long, miserable and boring life. I'd rather my life be short, meaningful, and end with a bang...\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7616/Molotov.png style=\"width:660px;\" link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7616/offset/4\"]]\n\n\n\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7616/offset/4 Well thank god for that, am I right?]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@",
