Occurrences outside of the Foundation are, provided civilians were present, veiled as planned performances of self-written poems.\n\n**Description:** SCP-315-DE designates a global phenomenon, during which an affected Foundation employee abruptly begins to talk about their own greatest worries, fears, and/or problems. The duration of such an event varies between subjects and is apparently dependent on their well-being. Rhyme schemes and verse number are also dissimilar. Once the process has begun, a premature completion can only be achieved through termination of the affected person, whereas other halting attempts are integrated into the usually extremely exaggerated performance of the subject. Persons who experienced such an occurrence reported a feeling of relieving release and euphoria, which subsides in the following three to four days. Subjects are unable to remember the occurrences. It is unknown why only active Foundation personnel is affected, and not dismissed.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum-315-01/Documented Incidents\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **__Anhang-315-01/Documented Incidents__**\n\n**Foreword:** Multiple recorded instances of SCP-315-DE from different sites across the globe are listed in the following.\n\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Subject:** D-438[[footnote]] Personnel was in the vicinity of his cell during the occurrence.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Content:**\n[[=]]\nIn a coffin of concrete and stone,\nprepared by own misdeed,\nis where my inner being broke down,\nand it became earthly frosty.\n\nThe silhouette stands outside,\nthe stature of which's unknown,\nfor the hangman has yet to serve it;\na swift death's in limbo.\n\nI was cared for and adored,\nby the rose, dear honey,\nbut even failed in love's labor,\nthe jewellery robbery as felony.\n\nThe knocking from outside,\nme all too familiar,\nbut now the key's utilized,\nthe time has come.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Subject:** Agent Herrman\n\n**Content:**\n[[=]]\nThe mask can hardly be kept on the visage,\nwhat it hides is harder to hold,\nwhat grins at you from behind the façade,\nthe web beneath you tend to ignore,\nthe former made of strings with plans.\n\nShould she slip,\nI would be punished,\nhe, who only fulfills the objective,\nO the solitude of being by myself.\n\nA drop flows out of my eye,\nwhen it sees the past,\nbut not the salt's taste I find,\nfor it is the saliva,\nby the persons of mockery.\n\nI have to prove myself,\nI will no longer be teased by them.\nOutside I shall now step\nand bring an end to it all in an instant.\n[[/=]]\n**Remark:** The affected agent was exposed as an Mages Academy member and detained.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Subject:** Dr. Amber[[footnote]] A Mexican female researcher by the English branch.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Content:**\n[[=]]\nEverything lost its color in this plane\nand merely is so monotonous.\nThat's how I exist,\none day it shall take me with it.\n\nThe sun has scraped clouds in front of her,\nso that she must no longer see my stature.\nIs the sun a graven image?\nAnother sun beam about to vanish.\n\nThis grew the brain parasite,\nwho shrills between my every eye,\nI should lay down on a mattress-less bed\nand turn off this last lamp.\n\n[[/=]]\n**Remark:** Dr. Amber was admitted psychological treatment.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Anhang-315-DE-02/Incident\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nOn the 03/08/2022, an incident occurred during a cleaning process with D-3829 in the cell of [[[SCP-129-DE]]]. When D-3829 touched the head of SCP-129-DE out of curiosity, the employee experienced an SCP-315-DE seizure. Due to the telepathic abilities of SCP-129-DE, the latter was frightened, but showed signs of great relief shortly thereafter, while D-3829 recited a poem about mortal fear. During later interrogations, SCP-129-DE reported to have seen a gigantic eye with four white wings full of feathers in a cloudscape, as it said: \"Patre monitores te.\"[[footnote]]Latin for \"The lord guards thee.\"[[/footnote]] SCP-315-DE is therefore assumed to be caused by said entity. Afterwards, some employees began to call this entity \"guardian angel\".\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
