Changes to the document file are marked with ##blue|blue##.\n\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7259\n\n**Object Class:** ##blue|Keter##\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:**  The perimeter around SCP-7259 has been walled off, with two guards periodically patrolling the area. ##blue|Currently, a long-term method for decreasing the amount of spiritual matter inside SCP-7259 is being developed.##\n\n**Description:** SCP-7259 ##blue|behaves as the \"null\"[[footnote]]Coordinates, 0,0.[[/footnote]] spiritual point of Earth.## SCP-7259 possesses no discernible anomalous features at a glance, besides a constant, high pitched imperceptible sound coming from ##blue|the souls located inside.## ##blue|The interior of SCP-7259 contains ~498 billion living souls, with a density of 83.9 million souls/sq. Instead of ascending to one of several afterlives, all souls default to the coordinates within SCP-7259 upon death.##\n\n##blue|Out of the souls located inside SCP-7259, ~110 billion belong to humans. The origin of the remaining ~388 billion souls is currently unknown.##\n\n\n**Discovery Log 7259.1:** ##blue|The real nature of SCP-7259 was discovered on the date of 05/29/2043, during which it had experienced a sudden overflow of 2.3 billion souls entering its perimeters, putting a massive strain on the building itself. A parallel was drawn between the deaths and the sudden change in SCP-7259, which led to a quick mobilization led by DoTT technicians, stabilizing the building and souls inside in a timely manner.##\n\n\n##blue|Due to a limit of potential souls able to inhabit SCP-7259, a definitive limit of when humanity will surpass this number is able to be calculated, leading to a maximum overflow value.[[footnote]]In the case of SCP-7259 sustaining irreversible damage, the souls inside would be violently ejected out of its premises, leading to a potential XK-Class End Of The World scenario, with the souls outnumbering humanity ~3 to 1.[[/footnote]] Currently, an efficient method of siphoning souls out of SCP-7259 is being developed, as to prevent future overflow events.##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
