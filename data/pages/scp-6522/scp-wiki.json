In case of suspicious behavior from intruders, a security team must be dispatched from the nearest Foundation outpost in Mays Landing, New Jersey, and the intruders interrogated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6522 is a quaking aspen (//Populus tremuloides//) colony spanning 3.54 km² located in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States. Like all //Populus// colonies, SCP-6522 is composed entirely of clones sharing the same genetic material and a massive, connected root system. This root system is thought to have been used by a Group of Interest for anomalous computation, by controlling the transduction of electrical signals along the roots in order to use the entire colony as a massive electronic circuit. While electrical impulses naturally travel along the roots of plants, in the case of SCP-6522, the amount, distribution and fluctuation of these impulses throughout the system points to outside interference.\n\nThis computing power is believed to have been dedicated to mining anomalous cryptocurrency and more specifically non-fungible tokens (NFT).[[footnote]]Small units of data intended for speculative trade. Typically handled by blockchain technology, which requires large amounts of computational work to function.[[/footnote]] Electrical records show that information travels through the system from north-west to south-east, therefore, if any data inputting or outputting device is present, it should be positioned along this axis. No such structure has been found at surface level or underground: hence, the information input and output gateways could be thaumaturgical, ethereal or intangible.\n\n**Addendum: Technical information**\n\nThe fluctuations of SCP-6522's activity are correlated to the price fluctuations of an anomalous cryptocurrency known as unXplain'd (code UXP) on occult internet forums. Its current exchange rate is cited as 98,56 US$/UXP and it \"may only be mined using paranormal technology.\" Very little is known about this cryptocurrency, as SCP-6522 is the only system which has been linked to UXP with certainty.\n\n**Addendum: History and recovery**\n\nSCP-6522 has been linked to the activity of a group known as the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groupes-d-interet-fr#aaa Abnormality Amateurs Association]. The AAA is an small, unprofessional organization which engages in anomalous activities for recreational purposes. Despite usually operating in metropolitan France, AAA members had traveled to New Jersey in July 2022. Below is a transcribed conversation regarding SCP-6522 recovered from a member's cell phone.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transcript: AAA\"]]\n> **Date:** 2022/07/05\n> **Participants:** \n> - Gérard, AAA member\n> - Polo, AAA member\n> **Notes:** Translated from French.\n> -----\n> **Gérard:** Ah... you know what, Polo, this group vacation abroad is the best idea that's ever come out of your tiny little head.\n> \n> **Polo:** Yep. Nothing better to bring the Association closer together. \n> \n> **Gérard:** Oh, while you're here, there's something I need to tell you. As you know, our last endeavor cost us quite a bit of money, and it turns out that the Association's funds are not exactly plentiful at the moment.\n> \n> **Polo:** Yes, I know. Can you pass me a beer?\n> \n> **Gérard:** Here you go. So I thought that even though we're on vacation, we could use our time in the 'States to make some quick cash.\n> \n> **Polo:** All while making use of the anomalous, of course.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Wouldn't be fun otherwise.\n> \n> **Polo:** Do you have a plan?\n> \n> **Gérard:** As a matter of fact I do. You know my son's big into computers? Well last week he told me about something called NFT.\n> \n> **Polo:** How amusing. What is this \"NFT?\"\n> \n> **Gérard:** He said a non-fungible token is a small piece of data with a proof of ownership intended to be used in speculative trading.\n> \n> **Polo:** Huh?\n> \n> **Gérard:** Okay. You like car tuning right? Imagine I take a simple car, like a Dacia Sandero, and make some simple modification like, I don't know, painting a pink smiley face on the windshield. Then I sell it to you for 5,000 euro.\n> \n> **Polo:** Can't you just give it to me? We're buddies, aren't we?\n> \n> **Gérard:** This is hypothetical. Just imagine that you buy it. Then, you could wait for someone to buy it from you for 10,000 euro.\n> \n> **Polo:** Why would anyone want to buy a Sandero with a smiley face for 10,000 euro?\n> \n> **Gérard:** Because they think they can sell it for 20,000 euro. See, it's nothing but a chain of people trying to resell things to each other. And as long as they are convinced that they can sell what they buy, it makes the whole thing look like a good way to make money, and even more people join, looking for even more NFTs to buy. They spend all their money, and we get rich.\n> \n> **Polo:** Ooooooooh, I see. But it means the pink Sandero is gonna become more and more expensive, right? What happens when it gets to ten billion euro and no one wants to buy it?\n> \n> **Gérard:** I have no idea. But by that point, we'll have made enough money to fund the Association for a hundred years. Let's go get a computer.\n> \n> **Polo:** An anomalous one, of course.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nIn the following weeks, members of the AAA consulted with several Groups of Interest in order to acquire anomalous technology which could aid them in their goals. Due to the AAA's poor knowledge of anomalous markets, the selected Groups of Interest were not overly competent in this field.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transcript: AAA and Home Wonders Ltd\"]]\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-pl#HW Home Wonders Ltd] is an anomalous manufacturer of home appliances based in Poland.

I know how to check my email and go to the Playboy website, it's enough for me.\n> \n> (The unidentified person hands what looks like a laptop to Gérard.)\n> \n> **Gérard:** Just imagine. All the beeps and boops of the giant machines we see in movies, but in your lap.\n> \n> **???:** Actually, I would advise against putting it in your lap.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Why not?\n> \n> **???:** Because of the slight risk of lethal explosion.\n> \n> (Gérard very slowly puts the laptop back on the table.)\n> \n> **Gérard:** This thing can kill us?\n> \n> **???:** Why of course! There's no such thing as zero-risk.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Is it likely...?\n> \n> **???:** It depends what you mean by \"likely.\"\n> \n> **Gérard:** Well, what happened to the last person who bought one of these?\n> \n> **???:** I'll have you know he's perfectly fine.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Really.\n> \n> **???:** Yes, he was away when the device exploded.\n> \n> **Polo:** (In French) Now I'm confused; is the pink Sandero exploding part of the plan?\n> \n> **Gérard:** Are your other products also life hazards?\n> \n> **???:** Our mission at Home Wonders, Ltd. is to bring the latest innovations to the house of the common man. Functional mishaps do happen, but we encourage the working class to focus on the positive aspects and consider the whole of our activity as an empowering opportunity. Yes, our polar air conditioners have caused frost bite. Yes, pets and babies have been claimed by our supersonic vacuum cleaners.

As you can see on the catalog, the core processing unit is an assortment of connected brains suspended in a reservoir of nourishing fluid. A neural-electronic adapter is included, comprising USB-3, HDMI, VGA and audio jack.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Are they human brains?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** No, obviously. Cetacean brains have comparable performances for a much cheaper price. As for the nourishing fluid, several blends are available depending on your needs: we have finance fluid for accounting work, space fluid for astronomical computation, gaming fluid which...\n> \n> **Gérard:** Man, all this fluid talk is making me thirsty. Do you want anything?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** O-oh, I wouldn't want to bother you...\n> \n> **Gérard:** (In French) Hey Polo! Bring out some beer for the lady, will you?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** You're too kind.\n> \n> **Gérard:** I can't let my guests die of dehydration. So this brain-computer then, how much is it?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** Well, we usually sell business-to-business, so I don't exactly know what price it would be for private use... you should expect some extra fees because of scaling costs. Probably somewhere in the low hundreds for the model you see on the catalog.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Splendid! Ah, look at the guys jumping into the pool under the aspens... I'm gonna do the same. You should join us as well!\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** Uh... I don't think it's very reasonable... I have a meeting with the board of directors this afternoon, followed by a factory inspection...\n> \n> **Gérard:** Come on, don't be so stuck-up, Ma'am. So those brains, do we just plug them into wall power?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** No, there's really no need since you will be supplying them with a constant flow of blood.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Ah... is that absolutely necessary?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** I thought you had been informed... my apologies, I'm not used to dealing with private consumers. The ThinkTank(tm) needs a permanent input of blood from the same species as that of the brains, cetacean in this case.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Well that's a bit of a issue. Where are we gonna find that?\n> \n> **A. Ribeiro:** //(coughs)// This is really strong...\n> \n> **Gérard:** Yeah, it's is good beer. For real men.\n> \n> **A.

This further degraded potential investors' opinions of the market, accelerating its collapse. Occult brokers stopped listing UXP, so cashing out for non-anomalous currency such as the US dollar was made impossible. Anomalous items were found strewn across streets in many cities after their owners abandoned them out of spite.

Completely missed the hole!\n> \n> **Gérard:** As in?\n> \n> **Zhang Yuzhao:** Well... you see, NFTs are something called an economic bubble. And if the bubble inflates too much, it can burst, which results in a sharp decrease in attractiveness, and therefore, of profit for miners.\n> \n> **Gérard:** You're gonna have to dumb it down, son.\n> \n> **Zhang Yuzhao:** Basically, NFTs have gone out of fashion and we're not getting any more money.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Ah.

What we currently have is \"cryptocurrency,\" which can't really be used to buy anything other than NFTs. For that, we would need to \"cash out\" and trade our cryptocurrency for US dollars.\n> \n> **Gérard:** Let's do that then. Bernard, did you finish my beer?\n> \n> **Zhang Yuzhao:** Well... if brokers still permitted cashing out now, with everyone trying to get rid of their NFTs, they would make losses.
