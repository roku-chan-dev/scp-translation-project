Xe was enrolled in the Foundation's internal education system, before officially joining the Metaphysics Department in 2016.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=molly_moth.jpg|caption=Irvine in the Site-42 breakroom.]]\n\nIn 2019, due to a containment breach involving an unknown proto-conceptual anomaly, Researcher Irvine's face was conceptually damaged. Xer mouth and its functions were irrecoverable, and were removed.\n\nIt was decided that Researcher Irvine required an extended reassignment for mental health purposes, and xe was given a low-risk position as a part of the ECRG.\n\nXe has expressed a higher level of productivity and contentness with this assignment; the rest of xer team has given xer the nickname of \"Moth,\" a reference to the //Actias luna//, which lacks a mouth and digestive system.\n\n**Reports:** Researcher Irvine has aided in the containment or documentation of various anomalies throughout xer career. Database links to projects xe has been involved with are included below.\n\n|| [*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5097 SCP-5097] || A former member of the Unreality Department.
