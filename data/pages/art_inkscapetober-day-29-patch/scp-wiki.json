So that made the choice for supporters quite easy. The shield itself was harder. Joreth has quite a few works, but it was rather hard for me to choose one or a couple to depict. However, Joreth himself has divided his articles into two categories. These are represented by the two colors. These two are held together by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-14039956/forum:thread| Thread], uh, I mean [[[J |Thread]]]. And the needle is behind the shield.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** The articles, good and bad, are now patches. And just as the forums of this site, they are held together by Thread.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-28-crispy| Day 28: Crispy]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-30-slither| Day 30: Slither]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Joreth.png\n> **Name:** Joreth\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nJoreth.png is a composite.
