It must be exposed to at least four hours of direct sunlight each day; in the event of overcast weather, sun lamps are to be provided.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7408-A is not to be physically separated from SCP-7408-B under any circumstances. SCP-7408-A's care has been fully entrusted to SCP-7408-B.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Memet:** Item ensures its own containment.[[/span]]\n\nSCP-7408-B has been allowed to continue employment with the Foundation and retain his Level 3 security credentials under the condition that SCP-7408-A remain fully cloaked at all times while within public areas.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Radix:** Item has been integrated into the Foundation's hierarchy.[[/span]] Outside of this document, SCP-7408-B is to be solely referred to by name (Dr. Kondraki) and is never to be referred to with standard object pronouns (it/its).\n\n**Description:** SCP-7408-A is a large swarm of //Lepidoptera graphium agamemnon//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Tailed jay butterflies.[[/span]] that was discovered on 10/20/2003 by a group of researchers in an Antarctic ice cave. Though the average annual temperature of Antarctica’s interior is −57°C, it did not appear to be adversely affected by the cold.\n\nSCP-7408-A’s primary anomaly is its ability to manipulate light. Initially believed to possess a complex camouflage defense mechanism akin to nonanomalous chameleons, it has since been determined that SCP-7408-A can refract light to such a fine degree that it can generate visual illusions in its immediate vicinity.\n\nSCP-7408-A does not need to eat or drink, subsisting entirely off of [[[SCP-2332 | exposure to light]]]. Any form of light is sufficient for maintaining its survival, with natural sunlight providing the highest quantity of nutrition.\n\nSCP-7408-A is solely directed by SCP-7408-B's conscious and subconscious impulses, who has described the process as being analogous to controlling a limb. In the event that SCP-7408-B does not remain within 20m of at least 65% of SCP-7408-A, it has been deemed extremely probable that SCP-7408-B will experience brain death.\n\nSCP-7408-B is Dr. ████████ Kondraki.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"poi_box\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ **Person of Interest File #267-515**\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Kondraki.png\n| caption=PoI-267-515\n| width=250px\n| align=right]]\n\n**Name:** Dr. ████████ Kondraki[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]See Addendum 7408-3.[[/span]]\n\n**Associated Groups of Interest:** [[[are-we-cool-yet-hub | GoI-267 (\"Are We Cool Yet?\")]]]\n\n**Biography:** Born on 01/22/1970 in Lee, Massachusetts to Antoni and Łucja Kondraki. Reportedly had a poor relationship with his immediate family, only remaining in contact with his twin sister, Alicja Kondraki, after reaching adulthood.\n\nExcelled academically from an early age, enrolling in Columbia University in 1988 to pursue a PhD in Biological Sciences. Briefly became romantically involved with PoI-267-113 (\"Hugo Manray\") in 1989, whom he had met through a hobbyist photography group. Was subsequently introduced to GoI-267 and the wider anomalous world, quickly becoming enmeshed in the [[[/locations-of-interest#backdoor-soho | Backdoor SoHo]]] anart scene. Dropped out of Columbia shortly thereafter.\n\nDiscreetly experimented on various anomalies in parallel to anart work, utilizing his findings to produce anomalous objects. By 1995, had gained a degree of renown in the global anartist community for his skill in creating anart equipment -- primarily cameras & film.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]His own art was largely nonanomalous, being mostly landscape and wildlife photography.[[/span]] Was sought for arrest by multiple normalcy organizations, but never caught.\n\nOn 04/17/2001, several months after the birth of his son, Draven Kondraki, he contacted the Foundation through a third party requesting to strike a bargain. Offered the anomalies in his possession, records of his research, and detailed information regarding several high-priority figures in GoI-267 in exchange for amnesty, protection from GoI-267 reprisal, and full-time employment as a Foundation researcher. Terms were accepted under the condition that he did not create new anomalous objects without the permission of the O5 Council.\n\nIn recognition of prior research, has since received an honorary Foundation PhD in paraphysics.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Paraphysics:** The science of anomalous matter.

In its interactions with others, I've seen analogous changes in its personality.\n\nSCP-7408 isn't a hive mind, it's a //mirror//. It //reflects// minds. On its own, it's just... blank. An empty brain, networked across hundreds of butterflies and waiting to be filled out.\n\nLike it does to rays of light, SCP-7408 bends and refracts all thoughts that pass through it. It's a simplified, abstracted sort of reflection -- information without understanding, identity without personhood. All the pieces are there but it doesn’t have the tools to put them together.\n\nBetween its reflective psychology and its illusions, SCP-7408 is fucking //dangerous//.\n\nThank //god// I got to it first.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 7408-3: Incident 7408-01**\n\nOn 08/04/2004, at 2:15 PM, security cameras stationed in and around Containment Chamber 7408 ceased functioning for 12.5 minutes, shortly before Dr. Kondraki entered the chamber. Site security did not become immediately aware of this fact, as the camera feeds had been set to a 30 minute prerecorded loop. The following log was recovered from the remains of Dr. Kondraki's digital recorder.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-left:solid 5px #3a852e;\"]]\n\n**AUDIO LOG 204**\n\n----\n\nSomething's been bugging me about 7408. It's been an itch at the back of my mind since the beginning, before it got me my promotion.\n\nThis anomaly revolves around perception, right? Light and illusions and reflections. It multiplies when nobody can see it. You look at 7408 and try to interpret it -- it looks at you and interprets right back.\n\nIt's color. It's interpretation. It's //art//. Somebody //made// this.\n\nI don't think it was recent, either. This is a hunch, but 7408 doesn't feel like something modern anartists would produce. It feels old. //Very// old.\n\nI should see if my new security clearance can get me historical records of anart from--\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\nWhat is...?\n\n//[Rustling paper. A sharp intake of breath. A sudden gust.]//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Oh, shit.\" hide=\"Oh, shit.\"]]\n\n//[A second voice becomes audible, its source appearing to be near the recorder. The voice sounds as though it is composed of short audio clips of other voices that have been edited together.]//\n\n**???:** {{Hello, ████████. Don't move or I'll shoot.}}\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** Stay back—! Stay the //fuck// back!\n\n**???:** {{Or what? What will you do, record me to death? You don't have your tools anymore.}}\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** Want to bet your life on it?\n\n**???:** {{You know, I'm rather disappointed. I told them, \"he'll never fall for a trick like this, he's not some amateur that couldn't tell a Dalí from a dollhouse. He'll see through it and then we'll lose the element of surprise.\"}}\n\n**???:** {{But then you read the words and let me in.}}\n\n**???:** {{You've embarrassed me, ████████. After all, everyone knows a student is only as good as his teacher.}}\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** Hugo? Hugo Manray? Is that you?\n\n**Manray:** {{In the flesh. So to speak.}}\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** What have you //done// to yourself?\n\n**Manray:** {{The question you should be asking is, what will I be doing to you?}}\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** Are you going to shoot me? We both know you can do better than //that//.\n\n**Manray:** {{You don't deserve my \"better.\" You don't even deserve my \"half-assed.\"}} \n\n**Manray:** {{What you deserve is a bullet and to be blotted from memory like the rest of the Foundation's failures.}}\n\n**Manray:** {{Now, for old time's sake. Any last words?}}\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Dr. Kondraki:** I--\n\n//[Gunshot. Several overloud impact noises as the recorder falls and skitters across the floor.]//\n\n**Manray:** {{Hm. Well, what do you know?}}\n\n//[Manray's voice becomes gradually louder as he approaches the recorder. Rhythmic paper-metallic-squelching sounds are audible as he does so, which are presently believed to be his footsteps.]//\n\n**Manray:** {{I can't remember your name already.}}\n\n//[Overloud impact.]//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nDr. Kondraki was found unconscious on the floor of Containment Chamber 7408 in a pool of blood from a gunshot wound in his upper right temple. No SCP-7408-A instances could be found within the chamber, presumed stolen by Manray. Dr. Kondraki's recorder had been smashed and a slip of paper was crumpled in his right hand:\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n+++ {{**Item #:** SCP-0000}}\n\n+++ {{**Object Class:** Perfidious}}\n\n+++ {{**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-0000 is to reap what he has sown.}}\n\n+++ {{**Description:** Are we cool yet, ████████?}}\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nIn the hours immediately following the incident, it was discovered that Dr. Kondraki had also fallen prey to a media-altering, antimemetic anomalous phenomenon. From that point onward, Dr. Kondraki's eyes have been automatically redacted from all visual records of his face. His first name, ████████, is likewise redacted from all visual and audial records. Those who knew Dr. Kondraki’s forename prior to the anomaly or hear it spoken aloud cannot perceive it without use of [[[antimemetics-division-hub | mnestics]]].\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 7408-4: Incident 7408-02**\n\nDr. Kondraki was rendered comatose by the attempt on his life, his condition stabilizing once the bleeding was staunched by Foundation medics. Initial medical scans determined that the gunshot had damaged his brain to the extent that several vital organs should have stopped functioning -- despite this, they were all operating normally. Further scans discovered the existence of a small mass of unknown matter in Dr. Kondraki's brain, near the point where the bullet entered his skull.\n\nIt was later determined that the unknown mass was composed of 2-3 SCP-7408-A instances.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Location:** Site-17 Medical Wing, Room 301\n\n----\n\n//[Dr. Kondraki lies in a hospital bed, comatose.

Haven't been able to for a while, not since I got word that Dad died. Things were pretty touch and go for a while there, but I honestly thought things were getting better.\n\nGuess not.\n\nI'm not broken up about it. He was a bastard that made my childhood living hell. I don't //miss// him, it's just-- I thought I'd be happier about it, being free of him. But instead I'm...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\nDrunk. I'm feeling drunk about it. Here's to you, you self-obsessed piece of shit.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[A single SCP-7408-A instance crawls out from under Dr. Kondraki's left hand.

I took a sharp rock and carved it open, right there. Its insides slopped out like goo, 'cause that's what happens to caterpillars, they gotta dissolve their bodies into a soup before they can turn into butterflies.\n\nI freaked out, of course, cried my little head off. Dad sure was pissed. He'd brought me to teach me how to hunt and here I was, sobbing over a dead bug.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Six SCP-7408-A instances crawl out of Dr. Kondraki's hospital gown, flying to join the other instances.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-left:solid 5px #3a852e;\"]]\n\nIt fucks me up, thinking about what happens to caterpillars. It's sort of like dying, isn't it? Getting your whole body dissolved, even if it gets reconstituted later. I mean, it's not //really// a death, all its cells are still alive. It's dying-but-not-dying.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[SCP-7408-A instances begin pouring out of every nook and cranny in the room that is out of the security camera's line of sight.]//\n\n//[The air becomes choked with SCP-7408-A instances.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-left:solid 5px #3a852e;\"]]\n\nI've never believed in the afterlife, not really. I always knew I'd just... stop, when my time came. I thought it sounded peaceful.\n\nBut now... they don't let me see a lot at the Foundation, not with my clearance. But I've seen enough to know that there's more out there, after this life. Death isn't an ending, it's a //changing//. Your body turns into a corpse and your soul or your essence or whatever-the-fuck goes and becomes something else. A changing. Passing on.
