Following the installation of site-wide security cameras in 1963, sightings of SCP-1542 increased exponentially. The SCP-1542 research team and site security cooperated to track and capture an instance of SCP-1542 using the new camera surveillance system.\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1542/cat-3.jpg|\n    caption=An SCP-1542 instance in poor health, believed to be a manifestation of SCP-511.|\n    align=left|    \n    width=312px|\n]]\n@@ @@\nOnce captured, the instance was administered anesthesia and fitted with a body camera and tracking device to facilitate the investigation. After being released, the SCP-1542 instance fled to the boiler room of Site-34 and was observed traveling through the ventilation ducts until returning to a large colony of similar instances. This discovery led to speculation that SCP-1542 was a mislabeled SCP-511 manifestation, and anomaly containment procedures were updated to secure Site-34.\n\nSeveral staff members expressed concern that the reaction to SCP-1542 was \"overblown\", with some even citing conversations they had with other staff members in which the anomaly was considered harmless. This can be primarily attributed to the restrictions placed on staff during this time, including required vaccinations and medical examinations that were not typically required of staff at other Sites.\n\nDue to the large number of anomalies contained on the Site, limiting factors in the employment of on-site personnel, the necessary quarantine of rooms that had born witness to SCP-1542 sightings, and decreased workplace satisfaction, updates to containment procedures were considered detrimental to overall containment.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**UPDATE 1973:** In an effort to discover and eliminate the suspected SCP-511 instance, demolition of the wall connecting the boiler room to the SCP-1542 colony was carried out in 1973. Several hours of demolition eventually led to the discovery of the main location of the SCP-1542 colony.[[footnote]] The ventilation ducts above boiler room 4-B.[[/footnote]] Although some instances were accidentally neutralized during initial discovery, most surviving instances escaped into the Site.\n\nIt is unknown if SCP-1542 will persist after the destruction of its primary colony at Site-34. \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1542/offset/2 VIEW THE MOST RECENT SCP-1542 UPDATE?]",
