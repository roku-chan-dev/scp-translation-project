If SCP-7015 is brought to light in international Foundation discourse, its influence among Foundation Branches poses significant risks of internal dissent and breakdowns within the Foundation itself. In an attempt to weaken SCP-7015, the Philippine Branch has initiated Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. It aims to destabilize SCP-7015 through mythological anomalies, propaganda warfare, and weaponization of forms of entertainment banned in SCP-7015, such as anime and manga. \n\nThe first key component of this operation is the cooperation of surviving Korean and Chinese mythological and thaumaturgic entities, which have been steadily growing in numbers since the 1960 and 1970 purges. Operation FILIBUSTERISMO may utilize these recruited entities as spies, tools, or bait.\n\nThe second key component is the Propaganda Division, composed of Philippine Branch agents, either home-grown or recruited from within SCP-7015. Many of these agents are East Asian and anomalous by nature. The Propaganda Division is also in charge of documenting the contacted mythological entities, and turning their narratives and histories into propaganda illustrations and comics.\n\nThe Propaganda Division’s main themes are nostalgia, nationalist secrets, and opportunities in diversity and freedom, intended to target the disillusioned residents of SCP-7015.\n\nThe third key component is the Comic Convention Plan. This convention would feature the works of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO and mass propaganda attacks during the November festivities of SCP-7015. The Philippine government is currently sending agents, personnel, and material in secret to SCP-7015 territory via cover companies and cooperative buffer countries. Fake locations of the Comic Convention are being leaked to SCP-7015.\n\nThe Philippines is to feign the continuation of its alliance and deference to SCP-7015, contributing funds and personnel. On the other hand, it has been clandestinely funding propaganda and disinformation campaigns throughout SCP-7015. Collected Chinese and Korean artifacts are to be planted by Philippine agents throughout SCP-7015, in the guise of being hidden by cultural revivalists and rebels. To gain the trust of the Japanese branch, the Philippines will provide intel on these materials. \n\nOperation FILIBUSTERISMO has heavy provisions on research involving time travel or reality manipulation to correct SCP-7015. The operation's heads cite the possibility of undoing the progress of the Philippines, which has prospered into a highly advanced and industrialized regional power in Asia. \n------\n\n++ **Description**\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=poster.jpg\n| caption= SCP-7015 propaganda concerning investments and financial conservation. SCP-7015 used variations of this poster for the Great Imperial Recession of 2020.\n| width=30%]]\n\nSCP-7015 refers to the Japanese Empire, particularly its modern-day existence stemming from its victory as an Allied Power in World War 2. Multiple parahistorical and multiversal analyses commissioned secretly by the Philippine Branch indicate that SCP-7015 should have been a principal member of the Axis Powers. In approximately 99.2 percent of all studied alternate timelines, Japan would surrender to the United States of America during the final stages of the war, resulting in the dismantlement of its Korean, Chinese, and Pacific imperial territories. In baseline reality, however, China served as the East Asian Axis Power.\n\nIn all universes, including baseline, Germany has a crucial hand in engineering China’s rapid industrialization, such as the Nanchang and Kweichow railway projects and the Three-Year Plan. Furthermore, Germany advanced Chinese military modernization via reconstruction of arsenals, establishment of mustard gas and chemical plants, and joint production of military hardware.\n\nA significant divergence occurs in 1933-1937, often called the “divine wind” in modern-day Japanese circles. Influenced by significant German business interests, German leadership under Adolf Hitler deemed China as an economically viable and militarily capable ally.  China also refused to sign the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, instead choosing to focus on less binding ceasefires. These factors led to the successful initiation of China as one of the Axis Powers in World War 2. China's fragmented leadership at the time, however, and internal issues led to less than ideal use of its military and economic capacity.\n\nSCP-7015 took advantage of this development by joining the Allied Powers. This decision allowed it easy access to Western technology, as well as oil and agricultural products from Allied Asian countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, and French Indochina. With a massive material advantage, as well as the maintenance of a good reputation, Japan was able to cripple China as early as 1943. \n\nAt the end of the war in 1944, SCP-7015 kept its current holdings plus a significant amount of Chinese territory.  It remained neutral and isolationist during the Cold War, focusing on control of its territory. To illustrate, it negotiated control of formerly Chinese regions, such as Inner Mongolia and Tsinghai, with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, countries such as the Philippines remained virtually untouched, accruing wartime profits.\n\nHowever, it later faced multiple internal issues, with reduction of efficiency in its ethnic cleansing and educational propaganda methods as well as significant downturns in its economy. Furthermore, it has remained culturally conservative and traditionalist, often implementing significant restrictions or even bans on \"Western\" entertainment such as comics, animation, and video games.\n\nSCP-7015 was only deemed anomalous upon the creation of sufficiently sophisticated Philippine parahistorical tools and technology in 2000. \n\nUnder the purview of the Philippine government, SCP-7015 is key to the mobilization of resources and technology of the Philippine Branch. A weakened SCP-7015, and by extension, a more fractured Japanese Branch, is significantly beneficial to the Philippine government and its Foundation Branch. \n\nThe Japanese Branch is one of the dominant parts of the Foundation, albeit with significantly decreasing and ossifying efficiency due to its own internal issues and general conservatism. Therefore, SCP-7015 is highly detrimental to the performance of the Foundation in Asia. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that SCP-7015 is beginning to puppeteer neighboring branches through methods such as debt traps, aggressive negotiations, and bribery and blackmail of regional officials. These actions threaten the checks and balances within the Foundation.\n\nThe Philippine Branch has rationalized that SCP-7015's geopolitical serendipity is anomalous, and with the absence of sufficient reality manipulation tools to properly contain SCP-7015, has opted to wage war via Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.\n\n------\n\n++ **Mangaka in the High Castle Logs**\n\nTo illustrate the inner workings and typical missions of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, the logs and commentaries of two members of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, collectively known as the \"Mangaka in the High Castle\" or \"High Castle\" in short, are provided below. Brief profiles of these members are also attached.\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Mangaka in the High Castle Profile.\" hide=\"<< Mangaka in the High Castle Profile.\"]]\n\nThe High Castle pair is composed of anomalous humanoid entities of East Asian descent. Minoru Umino has the appearance of a young adult male, accompanied by an incomplete, levitating orb that enables its temporary and energy-intensive conversion to a draconic entity reminiscent of traditional Asian water dragons. Hoshimi Kitsukumi is a young adult female with vulpine features, such as a secondary set of highly mobile ears and a tail. Both entities can thaumaturgically conceal their features. The pair is currently on field duty, owing to their anomalous capabilities.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab MINORU UMINO (海野 海流)]]\n\nAn agent recruited from the Umino water dragon clan which sought refuge and later, citizenship within Philippine territory after World War 2. As a graduate of Philippine cultural weaponization programs, he has been active on the field for five years, specializing in espionage, reconnaissance, and sabotage. Anomaly strength analysis indicates classifies Umino as a Level-02 entity in his humanoid form and Level-04 in his draconic form.\n\nFurthermore, Umino is adept at ontokinetically manipulating streams of water from sources such as the ground, sea, and rivers. This capability is consistent with mythological descriptions of Korean water dragons. In his draconic form, whose length can range from 1 to 5m depending on its available energy, Umino can cruise at flight speeds of 100km/hr, and is capable of carrying packages and up to 9 personnel.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab HOSHIMI KITSUKUMI (狐組 星見)]]\n\nA defector from SCP-7015, following her disillusionment with her family and society. She is the fifth daughter of the highly affluent Kitsukumi Zaibatsu, a company specializing in surveillance and security products. The Kitsukumi family formerly was a minor and unknown family of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gumiho gumiho][[footnote]]Korean vulpine entities in mythology.[[/footnote]] which collaborated with Japan to subjugate and ethnically cleanse Korea via heavily funded propaganda and disclosure of other thaumaturgic and mythological entities. \n\nAs a gumiho, she is capable of energy-intensive shapeshifting into humanoid forms, although it can only reliably mimic young adult females due to a lack of mastery. Aside from shapeshifting, however, she is functionally identical to a normal female.\n\nOf note, however, is Kitsukumi's artistic and creative ability in terms of comics and depictions, which she uses to create manga published in secret over the Linked Net. Her works were initially based on the hidden confessions, notes, and principles of her father regarding World War 2 and the family's role in the Japanese invasions. Using company technology, she was able to discreetly coordinate with several nationalist underground movements via the Linked Net. She was later scouted by Umino to work together online. After Kitsukumi's near-arrest, Umino rescued her, eventually integrating her into field duty.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=40%\n|url=nuclearbomb.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A photograph carried by Kitsukumi, depicting Japanese and American army observers of the nuclear bombing of Juukei (known previously as Chungking, the last seat of the Chinese national government and of the Axis Powers) on November 1, 1944. \n]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nAs a recruited citizen of SCP-7015, Kitsukumi's behavior indicates a cultural identity crisis, which is important to note for its circumstances in the following Sovereign missions and the literary works it creates. It has penned a commentary, framed as a letter, regarding this issue. The commentary is provided below:\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Letter 7015-01\" hide=\"<< Letter 7015-01\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE LTR-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]07/20/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Letter 7015-01}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=dreaming.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=\"A photograph of me by my grandmother, a few days before you took me away and beyond.\"\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n= -- {{拝啓}}[[footnote]]Romanized as \"haikei.\" Formal Japanese opening in letters.[[/footnote]] --\n\nThe autumn is ever deepening, although I feel that some of summer's oppressive heat lingers to this day. Yet, the wistfulness among the red leaves reminds me of those days I spent before our voyages together. I would rouse from my sleep at around 6 A.M. and prepare myself with the aid of Kinoko, one of our family maids. Then, I would report to one of my aunts for work and training. By that point, work consisted of creating illustrations and advertisements for the sake of publicizing our espionage products. Rather ironic, now that I think about it. \n\nThen, occasionally, your illustration and story requests come to me via that mechanical crow, and I send the finished comics through it. I really liked those requests about demons pranking people around them, as well as the stories about //gwisin// apparitions and grim reapers in wide-brimmed hats. I must have you know, though, that we //kitsune//... we //gumiho// don't really have a taste for human liver today! If you try to force it, I myself will feast on your liver, you know?\n\nAs a daughter of a //zaibatsu//, I wouldn't say that my life here is empty - it would be such a privileged view - but I felt that something really was missing. I remembered what my missing father said, which reflected what you said later. \n\n\"This world has chunks of it missing, as if someone made them vanish into the abyss of time and propaganda.\"\n\nFather really taught me a lot in secret -- drawing illustrations, vague history that I never completely believed until you arrived, and a sense of truth, I guess. While I acted as a prim and proper lady, that feeling of saudade - nostalgia for places that never existed -- persisted within me, due to him. I guess that's what drove me to make those illustrations for our little underground collaborations two years ago.\n \nThen, a few days later, after I sent several comics and illustrations to you via the Underground, we had to escape from the imperial authorities. Me on your back, as we coasted through the busy streets of Heijo. Then, we landed near the dilapidated shrine, where you told me about the truth behind the Peninsula. -- its old name of Korea or Chosŏn, and how the Second World War truly ended. \n\nI remember one question you asked me. I must say, while it was fairly cheesy, it still made a mark.\n\n\"Tell me, are you a citizen of Japan? Or of the Peninsula - Korea?\"\n\nDespite all of them, I still feel conflicted about my completely Japanese heritage, even though I was a bit of a black sheep in our family and did not feel much about all the ceremonies I had to do. \n\nRaised as a Japanese, talks like a Japanese, acts like a typical //ojou//... I attend all of those parties, meetings, and occasionally even marriage interviews with sons of powerful Home Island families - apparently to improve our bloodline. This family of mine really pushed and molded me into the state I am in now.\n\nI feel I can never encapsulate the ideals of the Korean Lady, but I hope you can still trust me enough. As for me, I will try, for your sake, the sake of history, the sake of the Peninsula, and the sake of doing something in my dreary life. \n\nLastly, I am reminded of a saying my grandmother occasionally told me - \"知らぬが仏[[footnote]]Romanized as shiranu ga hotoke.[[/footnote]].\" It means, \"Not knowing is Buddha.\" With that phrase in mind, I wonder what Grandma would say about you and me today.\n\nIn any case, I hope that as we continue our journey, please take of yourself - it's getting very hot nowadays, and I fear that you have become very exhausted.\n\n= -- {{かしこ}}[[footnote]]Romanized as \"kashiko.\" Formal feminine manner of closing a letter in Japanese.[[/footnote]] -- \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs one of its key missions for Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, the High Castle pair investigated SCP-7015-HAETAE, a major Korean mythological entity known as a symbol of justice and law and as a guardian against fires and natural disasters. Recovered cultural data depicts it as a one-horned entity displaying canine and leonine features. SCP-7015-HAETAE has gone into hiding since the Imperial Purges of 1960 to 1965, and has only been recently rediscovered and recruited into Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Sovereign Mission 7015-01\" hide=\"<< CODE: Mamayang gabi'y magkakaroon ng pista...\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE MIS-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]07/27/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Sovereign Mission 7015-01}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=haetae.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A stylized depiction of SCP-7015-HAETAE, located on the grounds of its camouflaged abode.\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**LOCATION:** North Heian Province, Korea\n\n= -- {{START LOG}} -- \n\n//8 PM - a full moon overlooks the Northeastern provinces of the Peninsula. Umino crosses three arched bridges leading to the disguised SCP-7015-HAETAE's residence. Umino then commences his search for Kitsukumi. The whole area is littered with wooden tablets containing carvings of SCP-7015-HAETAE, grouped by three, eight, and nine. Several dolls resembling it hang on pine trees present within the area. Thaumaturgic Buddhist enchantments casted on the ground in the form of calligraphy link these dolls and tablets. Wine, fruits in three colors, and rice cake are offered at the center of the area.//\n\n//Umino sighs, walking between the rows of pine trees where it finds several hand tools and unfinished carvings. As Umino picks up the scattered tools, Kitsukumi, who is wearing a surgical mask over her fox mask, taps him from behind.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Am I… beautiful?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Sighs.//) Yeah, you're beautiful.\n\n//Kitsukumi removes her surgical mask, although her fox mask still completely conceals its face.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Am I still beautiful?\n\n**UMINO:** Hmmnn, yeah?\n\n//Kitsukumi then removes her fox mask. Underneath it is another fox mask, this time with a more pronounced grin painted on it.//\n\n**UMINO:** (//Presses its hand on his forehead.//) Ahh, you sure like to do pointless things. What's up with you today?\n\n//Kitsukumi chuckles for several seconds, covering the mouth part of its mask with a flowered handkerchief.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Minoru, can't a young lady have some fun? I imagined myself being watched by people thinking I went mad as I placed dozens of these wooden carvings in the middle of nowhere. So I decided, why not? Maybe the idea of a crazy foxgirl roleplaying Ms. Slit-mouthed can give birth to a new random urban legend I can write into something. Plus, you sure did take your sweet time going away so suddenly. (//Huffs.//) \n\n**UMINO:** I wasn't enjoying myself. My gut told me there were threats lurking around, like that imperial soldier girl who carries around multiple flags. I feel she has already caught wind of us.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Ehh? If it's really true that she now knows us, it makes it worse that you left an innocent, pure girl behind in this forest. Take responsibility for that.\n\n**UMINO:** Alright, alright, I will buy you an extra big fried liver in the next city. Anyway, are the preparations done?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Points around her surroundings.//) I finished putting all the dolls and tablets, as well as the magic seals, in the correct positions, as per the schematics you gave me. I even double-checked and triple-checked everything, but I soon got too tired. Good grief, you're working a girl day and night without rest.\n\n**UMINO:** We're in a God's house, you know. Get some of your elegant young lady act back together. Let's cast the primary spells now. \n\n//Umino digs out a buried earthen jar in the center of the area. He then checks its interior for water.//\n\n**UMINO:** There's less saltwater than in the past. Lord Haetae must be getting really agitated.\n\n//As Kitsukumi plays a zither, Umino uses his thaumaturgic capabilities to refill the jar. He then buries it again, inscribing the water symbol (水) on the sides of the burial mound. After reciting three incantations, he prepares for the final lines.//\n\n**UMINO:** Oh Great and Just Protector Against Fires and Calamities, Lord Haetae, please grant passage and contact with this lowly group of travelers, as we bring you new propositions from the Philippines. The time that we meet again for the Peninsular dream has come. \n\n//Jet streams of water shoot from the ground, as the area's visibility decreases due to fog. The water coalesces into a small pagoda, which Umino and Kitsukumi enter. Their Hume meters report significantly decreasing values as they climb down the pagoda. They then walk forward at the bottom, passing through a narrow corridor lined with bookshelves and miniature ships, pagodas, and terracotta figures.//\n\n//A bell sounds through the area, as a five-meter-tall, leonine, scaled entity lands in front of Umino and Kitsukumi. Its right eye is gouged out, and the horn on its head is cracked and broken. Necrotic dermatitis has began to set on a few of its scales. It puffs, before speaking broken Japanese.//\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** (//Coughing.//) Hahh, one wondered when you will come again.\n\n**UMINO:** You do not seem well, Lord Haetae. \n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** My jars of blessings will soon dry up, along with my vitalities. As per our contract, it is good that you will still bring tidings to my abode, although time has been running out much faster than I have expected.\n\n**UMINO:** Yes. recently, the Japanese Peninsular Authority and the Mainland Commission have been cracking down on us. It has made it relatively hard for me to move.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** (//Observes Kitsukumi.//) One wonders why you had the time to accommodate a maiden. Even more so, a high-society girl. I'm sure that the Philippines did not have girls like her in mind as part of your education.\n\n//Kitsukumi tries to retort, but she simply bows her head.//\n\n**UMINO:** (//Glances.//) She's a... companion. Aristocratic blood (//SCP-7015-HAETAE glares.//) She makes good stories, like the comics you and the underground movement received a month ago. She's also the one I talked about with you a month or so ago.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Ahh, the story about the flying pagodas and the role of guardians like me at the palace. The ending was too optimistic, I must say, and the characterization were quite inaccurate. It's entertainment nonetheless for someone living in this rotten home. Hahh... I do remember the days at the palace. But they are now just forgotten stories. Still, what's your name?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Kitsukumi... Hoshimi. Just a, just a normal girl now. I am here to request your favor in further documenting... illustrating the days of old, such as your life. \n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Kitsukumi... ahhh Kitsukumi! That's the name the old fox took up after the War. Heard from the winds he built up a powerful spy company, at the expense of his family's pride and history. And things have come full circle, with one of his granddaughters defecting from all the decadence. A cycle of **traitors**. Say, young lady, is it a bid for familial redemption?\n\n//Bowing, Kitsukumi remains silent.//\n\n**UMINO:** Please... please bequeath some of your trust onto her. She has basically thrown her life away in dedication to the Philippine missions. \n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Ah, well, never mind the questions, Kitsukumi...-//agassi//[[footnote]]Archaic Peninsular honorific.[[/footnote]]. I'll still humor you though. Umino here trusts you enough, and I don't have too many options anyway for storytelling. Can't keep talking and talking to myself about them. (//Bellows.//) **Speak**.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** You are... you are the Palace Gatekeeper spoken of in a few legends. Am I correct?\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Hmmn, so the legends still persist! I thought all the writings about it were burnt a hundred years ago... ahh. Too many piles of books and scrolls burnt, with a few repurposed into Imperial propaganda. My mind's also fading away after all these decades. Did someone teach them to you?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** My father taught them to me. At least some of them. I have also based my illustrations from the stories of the underground movement. \n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** To think that a pair of father-daughter black sheep and  hearsay would be my legacy's hope. I still remember the last Emperor; I definitely still know His Highness' temple name... Sojong... Seonjong?  Ah. yes, Sunjong. I recall how His Highness played with his often exhausted retainers when he was a child, and how he ultimately assumed imperial rule after his father was deposed.\n\nAnd up to... well, around 1910s, or 1920s, where he lost everything - the, the Peninsula. I tried to fiercely resist once things went south, but the imperial thaumaturges and the Japanese Army hunted me back north. Took hostage of and firebombed multiple cities and villages to lure me out. Destroyed all traces of me - my statues - too, especially after the War. The pagodas didn't survive too. The Peninsula no longer existed the way I knew it. \n\n//SCP-7015-HAETAE scratches its non-functional eye. Kitsukumi remains silent, with one hand sketching out few of the scenes detailed by SCP-7015-HAETAE.//\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** (//Growls.//) Huh. (Looks over the sketches.) Looks like my story now only exists on paper. You know, once our stories are gone, we guardians will also lose our grip, and even our minds, on the mortal realm. At the very least, the stories your companion draws slow down the erosion. \n\n**UMINO:** Lord HAETAE, we can still change our fates in the following days. The Philippines is planning a wonderful occasion around November.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Let me guess. A revolution of the people? (//Snorts.//) Naive. The Philippines only chooses to act long after the War? The wind says that the Peninsula no longer needs that. Its people's loyalty have shifted winds, after decades of mind-conditioning and cultural erasure. They're Japanese now, right? Heir of the Mireu and Imugi[[footnote]]Aquatic draconic entities of the Ancient Peninsula.[[/footnote]], answer me.\n\n**UMINO:** For the past decade, the Philippines has bankrolled a massive social media propaganda campaign on the Linked Net, calling for a return to the golden ages of - the mythological, for them, anyway - Korean Peninsula. The comics you have seen are part of that. With the economic recession underway, people are angry, Lord Haetae, and they are willing to believe. Taking Kitsukumi away also lends credence to the rumors about the old corporate families slowly fleeing due to danger.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Hah. So they only cling to caricatures of their heritage once they fear that their stomachs will go hungry. (//SCP-7015-HAETAE falls silent for five seconds.//) Still, I wonder if this is the only way left to regain my friends' lives and my culture, albeit in a bastardized form. Seems like a loser's way of doing things. To think I was called a protector.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** I believe that you still serve as an honorable protector of the Peninsula. The villages around your abode are relatively pristine and peaceful, while you continue to preserve multiple legacies of the Peninsula. Please... have at least a little faith in your people.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Hahh, this girl speaks her mind just like that. Umino, that plan of yours, of the Philippines, I bet that it concerns sacrifice, no? And //a lot of luck//, perhaps? I doubt that the Philippines is betting on high chances of success.\n\n**UMINO:** Lord Haetae, it's a gambit that we are planning against the Japanese Empire. The success of the whole project is dependent on what Tokyo does.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Oh? Tell me, are your... cute little comics supposed to prod the Empire - the sleeping giant?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Grins.//) That depends on how you want to interpret it, Lord Haetae. We are in a narrow window of opportunity, after all, and we do much more than just comics. Please peruse these documents for the information needed. (//Umino signals Kitsukumi to hand over stacks of scrolls.//)\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Despite going against the Empire, the Philippines sure has taken a few lessons from its old War Ally. Anyway, I will think about it. I will share my blessings and power once the time is right.\n\n**UMINO:** In any case, the Philippines wishes for you to remember its promise - once you see the lamp explode in the night skies of the Peninsula, we can ensure that you, your friends, and your beloved culture can rise again. Please cooperate with us at the designated meeting points. (//Passes several documents.//)\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** If the whole thing fails?\n\n**UMINO:** Then at least you dealt a final \"kkeo-jyeo\" to a weakened Empire. The Philippines will also probably keep Peninsular artifacts far longer for a future second round.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** (//Snorts.//) Hmn, I see. So the Philippines is aiming for a win-win situation. For us... (//Stares out of the pagoda and into the multitudes of pine trees, sighing.//) \n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Please trust us. I promise you on my honor as the lady of the Kitsukumi Zaibatsu.\n  \n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Alright. (//Faces Umino.//) Heir of the Mireu and the Imugi, I believe that you have one last thing to say?\n\n**UMINO:** Yes, one of the pieces of the broken orb of the dragons, which you hold.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** It is in my understanding that I am the one to bring it to the meeting point, no? You plan to only combine all of the pieces for the grand finale, right?\n\n**UMINO:** Correct, Lord Haetae. It is safer in the hands of the Protector, until the time comes. In any case, we're going further north now. We're going to need updates about the magic we need.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** (//Clutches its beard.//) Hmmn... don't tell me you are going to contact that bastard goblin of a woman. Oh well, she probably contributed more to this operation than me.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** A female goblin? Won't she be like really green and uhm, alien?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Chuckles.//) No, she's a dokkaebi. That is, she's a nature spirit that somewhat does resemble a goblin or an ogre in a few places, but she's much more personable. I just hope she wouldn't screw around with a relatively new recruit like you. Anyway, she has the resources and connections the Philippines needs if it ever wants the Comic Convention to ever get off the ground. \n\n= -- {{END LOG}} -- \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=3\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=manga.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Illustrations drawn by the group \"Scarlet Pen.\" The Scarlet Pen was a casualty of the 1981 Creative Media Reformation, which targeted mangaka (such as Osamu Tezuka) and budding video game studios.\n]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nObtaining approval from the Operation FILIBUSTERISMO Committee, the High Castle pair then searched for SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI, whose invisibility and matter manipulation capabilities are crucial to the Phase 2 of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.

Both Kitsukumi and Umino wear the Concordia Costume, a standard Manchurian clothing based on the Imperial Japanese uniform with Manchuria flag pins on the collar.//\n\n**UMINO:** We got lost in the Ice City of all places, damn it. Hoshimi, you figured out what the coordinates are supposed to be represent?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Not yet. It all feels too foggy. Let's head to the industrial zone. I think that's the way.\n\n//The Harubin Industrial Zone is filled with factories focusing on aeronautics, wood production, cigarettes, power plant equipment, food processing, and sugar refineries. Kitsukumi and Umino observe a group of five workers from one of the sugar refineries. Two of the workers have noticeable hand and facial scars.

Most of Harbin's, and by extension, Manchuria, don't have college education. Not because Japanese get priority, though that's one part of it. The Empire simply overextended its power and reach. Anyway, they're stuck in these factories until they die of overwork or get mangled by a machine. Haven't you seen these kinds of people in your family company?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** No... not really. I haven't visited one of my family's factories. \n\n**UMINO:** Hmmn.

Well, anyway, just don't stare too much if you can't -\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** ...No. That would defeat the point of it all.\n\n**UMINO:** Alright then. Let's go to a small park next. We're supposed to meet someone there after that escape from the Flag Girl. By the way, Kitsukumi, keep a low profile. The Japanese Branch has sent some grunts to patrol this place.\n\n//At the park, Kitsukumi and Umino observe youths playing football, the primary sport of Manchuria.

Let me tell you something, child.

You very well know that the Empire has many resources to field, no?\n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** But pure grit and the right moves can undo whatever material advantage you might have. Never underestimate decades worth of simmering wrath and preparations. Tell your superiors that, alright? We will be waiting for you personally. \n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** Tell me something... why deal a blow at Japan at this point? If the Empire fragments, multiple regions would be utterly destabilized. I know that you are... you are Korean, but don't you think that the vast majority of East Asia is already culturally and practically Japanese? You will be dealing more harm if you think you can make them believe your \"truth\"?\n\n//SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI remains silent for three seconds.//\n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** It's still worth a try. Plus, don't you think that with the way the Empire handled things, there would be a growing disappointment with the people? Hmmn, don't you think that there has been a surge of interest in the myths of old?\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** It's the 21st century right now. A highly modern place different from the cities and villages of the past. It's a lost cause. Don't tell me you and your friends are going to rule the place, because that would only burn things down. \n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** (//Groans.//) It's a golden window of opportunity right now. The myths haven't fully faded yet, and they're in that sweet spot for nostalgia among disillusioned people. And the stars have aligned - we have competent people in our ranks.\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** (//Falls silent for several seconds.//) Anyway, why did you tell your whole plan to me?\n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** As a ssireum - you might know it as sumo - wrestler, I am a highly honorable being, so I announce my fights proudly. I thought that honorable Japanese like you would know. (//Grinning, SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI signals Umino to deafen Aishinkakura again.//)\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Paces and looks towards the ceiling.//) This is a highly illogical thing to do, announcing things so openly... unless you are riling them up for something else.\n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** Smart girl, aren't cha? My boys, numbering in the hundreds, are also telling captured agents the same thing in different ways. A few of them did the same as me - brag about it. Others let the agents barely hear the plan. Many of us spouted different versions of the plan. \n\n**UMINO:** It's a gambit. It's highly likely that they will make their own convention or festival, much grander than what we could realistically do. And that's the key to Operation FILIBUSTERIMO.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Don't tell me you are planning to subvert...

The girl  tells him that the dragon is on a mission to retrieve the seven pieces of the eponymous Dragon Ball[[footnote]]Based on the Asian concept of a draconic orb, a major source of mythical draconic powers.[[/footnote]], scattered through the Eastern continent. Once all pieces are gathered, they reform into the Dragon Ball, which would give the girl the power of creation. The water dragon aims to recreate the flying utopian cities of old, where its fellow mythological entities can live in peace with their culture revived amidst the rule of the Red Ribbon Empire.\n\nBorn in the hinterlands of the Red Ribbon Empire's Mainland, the simian youth desires to tag along, wanting a sense of adventure. In exchange, he gives one piece of the Dragon Ball, inherited from his dead grandfather, to the girl. \n\nThe duo travels through the continent in search of the pieces. Throughout the 15-part series, entities such as a prankster demon and a shape-shifting vulpine woman join them, as the simian youth becomes stronger and more adept at martial arts. They fight through multiple androids, imperial soldiers, and assassins which can travel via trees. The Empire also realizes the potential of the Dragon Ball, and manages to collect several pieces.\n\nAt the climax, where everyone meets and is engaged in an all-out fight, the simian youth, mortally wounded, entrusts the water dragon girl to make the correct decision. After fighting against the top general of the Empire - the Flag Maiden, who can manipulate eight flags - the water dragon retrieves the Dragon Ball and makes her wish for a \"utopia.\" The manga then ends on a flash of light emanating from the Ball.\n\n= -- {{END SYNOPSIS}} --\n\n= -- {{START COMMENTARY | MINORU UMINO}} --\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=dragon.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A statue representing the Umino clan. The Umino clan escaped to the Philippines in 1952.\n]]\n\nI first saw this manga a month ago - well, at least some of its burnt out chapter pages - when I was rummaging through the Embassy's catalogue. From what I could read, it seemed like a generally lighthearted boy-meets-girl action adventure story, peppered with a little bit of lewd jokes. \n\nAfter consulting with Hoshimi and our team leader, Satou, we decided to contact the daughter of the author. The author, apparently, had escaped to Manchuria following an arrest attempt in the 90s. The daughter, meanwhile, took up an art-related and illustration job for a newspaper. After some convincing, the daughter agreed with Hoshimi to revive the series, based on my own experiences and the hidden notes of her mother. \n\nThe idea of a \"yeouiju\" orb serving as a Dragon Ball came primarily from me. It was rather easy to integrate into the story. For some reason though, the girls wrote the water dragon as a clumsy spy with a tendency of making electronic components explode. That fox probably took inspiration from my old stories at the Philippine training camp. \n\nThe orb though, it's not that easy to use. I currently have six pieces of the real yeouiju orb, three of which are taken by my grandfather when they made the run (flight?) for the Philippines. The rest of the pieces are hidden by those that stayed in East Asia, such as Lord Haetae; they are to hold it until the time comes. Still, if I ever have to use it, my body will pay the price. I'm too young to use the Orb of Heaven, but I am afraid that I might have to do so in the future. \n\nI had long accepted that as the heir of the Umino clan, I have to accede to the desires of the Philippines. In exchange for reviving the culture of Korea, as my grandfather and father both wanted, I have to take advantage of any opportunity offered to me. Even if it means that I get treated as a tool or pawn. Geopolitics on a grand scale simply offers scraps of luck for people like me, after all.\n\n= -- {{END COMMENTARY}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE NAR-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]10/06/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Narrative 7015-02}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=peachblossom.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A panel from the first chapter of \"A Festival of the Peach Blossom Spring.\"\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**TITLE:** 桃の花の春のお祭り (A Festival of the Peach Blossom Spring)\n\n**NOTES:** Written and illustrated by Kitsukumi.

The foxgirl originated from an alternate timeline embroiled in a Cold War. The nature of the conflict is unclear, but it involves a team-up of the Japanese Empire and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe foxgirl hopes to determine how to gather materials for establishing racial harmony by investigating the lives of the residents of the YSIZ. As a slice-of-life series, the foxgirl and the nekomata deal with a mischievous, heavily tattooed Korean goblin, who often engages in sumo with a red-masked tengu, one-footed peony dancers from the Mainland, ghosts, water dragons who operate as taxi drivers, and lunar jade rabbits. \n\nThe foxgirl also gains fame as a talented //hanafuda//[[footnote]]Japanese card game.[[/footnote]] player. She would often compete against a half-Japanese player hailing from the Philippines.\n\nThe series' final arc involves a Christmas festival, where the foxgirl, having received orders to return to her timeline, bids goodbye to the nekomata at a shrine. As she disappears at the strike of midnight, she promises to return, hopefully with her world in a better state.\n\n= -- {{END SYNOPSIS}} --\n\n= -- {{START COMMENTARY | MINORU UMINO}} --\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=utopia.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Unidentifiable Korean town from the pre-war era.\n]]\n\nI can guess where the idea for this one came from. A group calling itself \"Avalon,\" apparently one of the few hundred groups in cahoots with us, sent us multiple copies of their manga a while ago. All of them focused on one thing - the idea of racial harmony, technology, and utopias. Hoshimi got utterly engrossed in reading these works, to the point that I joked that she might soon hallucinate about a talking cat. Apparently, Avalon is obsessed with including cats in their stories.\n\nReading the whole thing, I felt that it was... grossly unrealistic. Maybe Hoshimi also realized how difficult it is to write, because she often complained to me about it. As someone who ground his scales for a degree in international relations and diplomacy in De La Salle, I often wondered what the story's foxgirl thought about the economic system, politics, and daily relations of the utopia's residents. While Hoshimi, a Political Science major, could explain well enough how some of these worked, I did not feel satisfied.\n\nHoshimi did say something about this piece. \"It's based on a dream I had before, you know. And about its realism... sorry, I'm still trying to figure out how to be realistic. I haven't really interacted much with the masses, after all, but I promise to try to know their life stories better.\"\n\nPerhaps I'm too jaded. Multiculturalism never really existed in this world, save for maybe America in the past. The Philippines itself almost got torn apart along ethnic lines in the 70s, during the height of the Modern Depression, to the point that they decided to solve it the //hard// way. What more with the idea of Japan, Korea, and China co-existing peacefully with their own cultures intact? \n\nHowever, I do feel that there is potential. Most Japanese citizens I know are good and friendly people, and Hoshimi is practically Japanese in all but lineage. Perhaps there is hope.\n\n= -- {{END COMMENTARY}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE NAR-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]10/10/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Narrative 7015-03}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=esprit.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=An illustration for the Not Seeing is Flower manga.\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**TITLE:** 見ぬが花 (Not Seeing is Flower).

Based on data from SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI, Miyacchi is specialized in delivering visions and dreams of \"what could have been.\" ESPRIT became one of the most popular games of the underground movements, and thus is banned by the Japanese Media Authority (JMA).\n\n= -- {{START SYNOPSIS}} -- \n\nThe manga starts with Takeda bemoaning his luck in the universe, as the latest product in the video game company he works for has not obtained JMA approval. Said product involved a storyline of yokai, or Japanese monsters, working as a crime-fighting ring in charge of cleaning the streets and alleys of Harubin. The JMA did not approve it due to its gritty portrayal of Harubin, which ran contrary to Japanese propaganda. The company was marked with a warning for potential \"subversion.\"\n\nMiyacchi then sporadically appears to him via dreams, slowly convincing the disillusioned Takeda to create a game based on one of Miyacchi's visions. Initially fearful for his life and career, as he remembered the multiple video game developers arrested in the recent decade, Takeda decides to make \"ESPRIT.\" Miyacchi later appears in a physical form to help him with the art.\n\nESPRIT involves an alternate universe where Japan, in a \"stroke of bad luck,\" joined the Axis side of World War 2. At the end of war, three of its cities - Kokura, Kyoto, and Niigata -  receives the brunt of the nuclear bombings, while its imperial order was completely dismantled. The protagonist is a cervine yokai, or Japanese monster, who hopes to coordinate with fellow entrepreneurs to create a more progressive Japan. In the golden ending, Japan is at peace with its neighbors, while it continues to rapidly progress in technology.\n\nMiyacchi is also at work on a animation film script, involving the same premise and story as ESPRIT's. According to Miyacchi, the script would be sent \"back to the one who needs them.\" Takeda questions the idea of \"anime,\" saying that it was banned many years ago, until Miyacchi declares that it should be revived. Miyacchi further surprises Takeda by saying that her employer has been churning multiple amounts of animated films[[footnote]]Technically true; the Philippines has discreetly produced approximately 300 animations, with lengths ranging from 30 seconds to one hour. All of these animations are used only for Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.[[/footnote]], and that the audience will soon know the \"power of anime.\"\n\nTakeda and Miyacchi then publish the game, alongside their development notes and visions for the future, to underground channels, before they hastily make their escape. Based on the development notes, it is highly likely that they joined one of the many underground workers' rebellion or cultural revival movements in Asia. \n\n= -- {{END SYNOPSIS}} --\n\n= -- {{START COMMENTARY | MINORU UMINO}} --\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=entrance.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A photo thaumaturgically generated by a dokkaebi as part of a vision of \"what could be.\"\n]]\n\nAn alternate universe again, I see. I do wonder if we're in an unlucky universe where everything in the war went just right for the Japanese Empire. Together with Hoshimi, I played the game that the manga featured.  A few edges were rough, and the foxgirl was getting smug over how I made admittedly dumb political decisions, but overall, it felt... entertaining. Rereading the manga with the game in mind, its pacing and story flowed well most of the time.\n\nUnlike the utopian story illustrated by Hoshimi previously, I felt that the whole thing felt more realistic, something that could have actually happened. What did Miyacchi peer into, I wonder? Are dokkaebis really that cognitive? \n\nPerhaps in an alternate universe, Korea and China exist in a better state, but the Philippines is a sorry excuse for a country. Perhaps in an alternate universe, Japan could truly co-exist with others, and not conquer. Perhaps, the utopias that Hoshimi and the Avalon group dream of could actually exist.\n\nYet, we are all in this timeline, where history just went well enough for the Empire to be on the \"right\" side, and survive till the modern day.\n\nI occasionally wonder if the whole reason the Philippine Branch is launching a crusade against the Japanese Empire is that its //existence// was an anomaly; perhaps in the grand view of history, it wasn't meant to be. Though realistically, it can also be a lucky excuse to score some hits on the Empire for better trade deals and a stronger voice in the region. \n\nThere is no harm in dreaming about the possibilities of luck, though. What matters the most is how we use what luck gives us at the moment.\n\n= -- {{END COMMENTARY}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE NAR-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]10/12/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Narrative 7015-04}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=wenchanganime.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A panel from the last chapters of the manga depicting Kitsukumi's father and Wen-chang.\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**TITLE:** キツ구미 (Kitsu-Gumi)\n\n**NOTES:** Written and illustrated by Kitsukumi. Based on her family records and stories. \nThe actual existence of Wen-chang, the god which Kitsukumi's father allegedly contacted, is not yet confirmed.\n\n= -- {{START SYNOPSIS}} -- \n\nThe mushroom cloud blooms over Juukei, signaling the end of World War 2 and the capitulation of the Chinese government to Imperial Japan and the United States of America. Daigo, Kitsukumi's grandfather, expresses elation that the war ended early. Prime Minister Hideki Tojo recalls how China, aside from ill-fated invasions of Vietnam, Tibet, and Eastern Russia, failed in being a viable Axis power and only imploded due to a mix of sanctions and internal issues. \n\nTojo compares China and Korea to a broken, ragged mess of flowers, saying that the Japanese \"intervention\" and that the nuclear bombing symbolizes the perfect art of ikebana, or flower arrangement. \"The mushroom cloud is a fluffy flower,\" he said. Chuckling, Daigo Kitsukumi then assures Tojo's assistant, Kawasaki, that the Kitsukumi family and the Korean elite have fully acceded to Japanese rule.\n\nIn the background, another member of the Kitsukumi family, Sawaki, remarks to a Filipino observer about the glee and awe of the Japanese involving the bomb. The observer then wonders how the Japanese would feel if two of their cities, Kokura and Kyoto, were hypothetically bombed. Sawaki responds that the Japanese would be incredibly distraught and angered at nuclear warfare. The observer simply chuckles.\n\nThe manga fast-forwards to 1980, almost 40 years later. The vast majority of Korea has been fully Japanized, while the Kitsukumi Zaibatsu's Korean lineage has been diluted due to Japanese marriages. Kitsukumi then details how her father, a historian and the youngest of Daigo Kitsukumi's children, discovered Daigo's correspondences about selling out his country, and how the Kitsukumi Zaibatsu grew extremely rich afterwards using favors from the system.\n\nHer father, Haku Kitsukumi then detailed how he had a \"fated\" encounter with a long-forgotten Chinese god, which Kitsukumi names as either \"Wen-chang\" or \"Wen-chü.\" Majoring in Japanese history, he had chanced upon several ancient scrolls tucked between bundles of documents in a university library. These scrolls described Wen-chang as a god of culture, literature, and the truth. Additionally, it detailed how to call upon Wen-chang through prayers, incense, and rituals.\n\nTaking a secret trip to Southwest China, her father prayed to a rundown temple in the middle of cypress trees. After reciting the prayers and Chinese poet Du Fu's \"The Hope of Spring,\" strong gusts of wind pass by him. From within the temple, two humanoid entities, resembling a young adult male and female and clad in a round-collar robe with long sleeves, emerge.  The entities approach and hold his hands. The group walks towards a two-meter wide sheet of paper hanging between two cypress trees. Her father and the entities then pass through the paper.\n\nHe reemerges in a heavily decorated temple, and is soon greeted by Wen-chang, who resembles an elderly scholar. The two then converse and debated for hours; Haku Kitsukumi describes the whole process as an \"event that destroyed and reformed his sense of history.\" Not fully believing at first, Wen-chang pointed her father to different locations throughout China, Korea, and Europe, where multiple books, scrolls, and documents have been stored in secret. If he decides that they are consistent and authentic, then he may revisit Wen-chang. Seven years later, her father does so.\n\nThe manga fast-forwards further to 2020. Hoshimi Kitsukumi herself states that her father effectively disappeared, apparently after a warrant from the Japanese Media Authority. Alongside his letters, however, he left behind troves of information and research secretly collected throughout two decades.\n\nKitsukumi notes how her father was especially curious about early manga and the general comics industry in Asia, with him declaring that they should not have been left to stagnate and rot. The manga then detailed her father's tutorials on their general style and structure.\n\n= -- {{END SYNOPSIS}} --\n\n= -- {{START COMMENTARY | MINORU UMINO}} --\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=wenchang.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A photo taken by Kitsukumi's father during his voyages for Wen-chang, a Chinese god of culture.\n]]\n\nI approached Hoshimi after she made me read this piece. After being allowed to enter her room, I saw that she was staring out the window at that point, wearing her favorite flower kimono. Let me recall the conversation:\n\n\"So, Hoshimi, about your father...\"\n\n\"I wonder if I have made him proud. Looking back, the old man was engrossed in his studies, though he did make a point of playing with me as a kid and having at least one substantial conversation with me every day, when I grew up a bit.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is proud of you.\"\n\nI explained to her how she had grown through her manga and illustrations, detailing the worlds of both the mundane and fantastical realities. How she had been studying history and literature worth centuries of East Asian development and culture, most of which had been sadly burned under the Rising Sun. \n\n\"Your father was a historian who, despite his entirely Japanese education, managed to dare himself to critically re-analyze history. I'm sure he would be proud of you, who also rose up to the challenge,\" I said. \n\n\"I see\" she looks at me. \"By the way, Minoru, do you know what's supposed to be the concrete difference between a kitsune and a gumiho?\"\n\n\"Hmm, what?\"\n\n\"It's something called a fox bead... how do you say it in Korean... I got it, yeowu guseul. It's a bead that I put in my mouth. When I... kiss someone... deeply, I can pass on the bead to him. Then, he gains some of my and my ancestor's memories. According to my father, my grandpa feared that his family would be hunted down due to this yeowu guseul, which can contain a lot of ancestral history.\"\n\n\"Your grandpa turned into a traitor because of him trying to save -\"\n\n“Maybe. One hand, if he didn’t do it, it’s completely possible that my mother and aunts would have ended up as comfort women - sex slaves for the Japanese soldiers. All of our land and businesses would be confiscated and resold to settlers. It would have been a very tragic ending for a once aristocratic family.”\n\n\"One the other hand,\" she then faced me. “According to my father, my grandpa once heard that the Japanese had captured a gumiho. This gumiho, which already had nine tails, was called the Vixen. Plus, this fox supposedly had rather screwed up morals, so her selling out the other gumiho, particularly the secret of the memories contained within a fox bead, wasn’t out of the question. In any case, she also got likely dissected by the Japanese, who might soon consider us a threat due to what we know.”\n\n“Your Foundation, has it ever recorded the Vixen?”\n\nI hesitated to tell her about SCP-953, which somewhat matched what she says. Our own records are extremely sparse regarding 953, and we can’t even fully confirm if it’s an actual anomaly. When I read the file from the Japanese Branch, I had doubts about how it seemed one-dimensionally brutal, deceptive, and bloodthirsty. It wouldn’t be surprising if it was just a smear article to justify genocide against gumiho. \n\nBut if extremely genocidal empires can exist without much of a problem in this world, I guess these kinds of gumiho can also do fine for at least a while.\n\n“I’m not sure if the Vixen is the one we recorded. The info’s too inconclusive. In any case, did the news about this Vixen scare off your grandpa into submission?”\n\n“Hmmn, maybe, maybe not. He was an opportunistic bastard who was already planning to collaborate with the Japanese for family prestige. What he couldn’t do at the time was to fully convince the family, especially the more dominant women, to follow him. Paranoia revolving around the Vixen was a very good excuse, however, for him to repress the females. He told us to act like kitsune, which are fox spirits that didn’t have any beads. We didn’t have much of a choice back then, and here we are, living almost like kitsune.”\n\nHoshimi was silent for several seconds.\n\n“In any case, I think I should use my yeowu guseul in a way that actually upholds the honor of the Kitsukumi family. Though who should I share it with…”\n\nShe suddenly turned away from me. However, fluttering like plum blossoms, she soon approached me.\n\n\"I am not yet ready to give it. Still too early, and I'm sure that Ms. Kinoko will hit me on the head if I do so. Plus... I'm not sure if I deserve to even give it in the first place, since it's a unique thing to gumiho.\"\n\n\"Well, tell me, do you feel like a kitsune, or a gumiho?\"\n\n\"Hmmn, I'm practically a kitsune. I feel like I'm lying if I said I'm a gumiho. I honestly don't know much about the Korean spirit world. Well, not for a lack of trying, since a lot of writings has burnt or rot. So...\"\n\nShe manifested her vulpine ears and one small brown tail.\n\n\"I have 900 years until I have all nine tails, and by that time, I might still be probably thinking about this dilemma. As a kitsune capable of shape-shifting into multiple things, identities are fickle. Much more when you have an empire chasing after your tail. Minoru, what do you think?\"\n\n\"Well, why not do what your father did? Accept the good things that make you Japanese?\"\n\n\"Hmmnn, go on Minoru. Let me hear it.\" She covers her mouth with fan while chuckling.\n\n\"What I mean is, if you still feel like a part of you is Japanese, wouldn't it still be a Japanese thing to be honorable and civil? In the history books I have read, Japanese and Koreans can afford to be cooperative, particularly with being scholars and exchanging wisdom and information. I mean, that's how the Japanese imported kanji from the Mainland. Of course, this relationship had a lot of ups and downs, and they occasionally went to bloody wars with each other.  Still, in the 17th century, Korea was one of the few trading partners of the isolationist Shogunate, and they regularly sent envoys to celebrate each other in goodwill events known as tongsinsa.\"\n\n\"Ehh, that's a new thing for me. In my history books, Korea was an overseas province since the Shogunate started. They really made a big fuzz about the Japanese kingdom of Mimana, and how it protected us...\"\n\n\"That's because of the Empire trying to rewrite history. Anyway, my point is that it's not out of the box for a Japanese to be critical, scholarly, and open-minded. Therefore, it won't be -\"\n\n\"Strange for me to still be a sort of Japanese while doing rather anti-Japanese things?\"\n\n\"You're too blunt, but yes.\"\n\nHoshimi chuckles.\n\n\"Eto, I was trying to actually convince myself that I'm helping the Empire as a bona fide citizen. The Empire, as a whole, has stagnated. No anime, no manga, and very strict censorship rules on games and entertainment. Quite honestly, a boring country stuck in the past. Which is bad. Long before we met, I had been hearing news of protests and rebellions, as well as the Soviets making a move. It wasn't long before something came out of that.\"\n\n\"I see. It's not a bad perspective.\"\n\n\"Of course. I'm no Arminius - that German hero who could suddenly switch over from his Roman education  and lead his own tribe to victory. I'm just a simple fox girl, long due for a marriage interview, who managed to wrangle her way out of the zaibatsu by gathering enough wits to form a breakaway faction and go on escapades with a dragon. In any case, Minoru, give me some time... with your words, I think I can sort this issue out soon, but I promise to be loyal to you.\"\n\nShe turned away and towards the window again. There is silence for several seconds.\n\n\"The moon... I hope it still shines beautifully in November.\"\n\n= -- {{END COMMENTARY}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\nDuring preparations for Phase 2, the leader of the occultist Worker's Coalition Movement, Saki Matsumoto, called for an emergency meeting to discuss her group's reluctance to fully participate in Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.  Due to Umino's extensive experience with Mainland politics, he was sent to negotiate with Matsumoto. With Umino citing security risks, Kitsukumi did not accompany him to the meeting, although she stayed in a nearby underground outpost.\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Sovereign Mission 7015-03.\" hide=\"<< CODE: Papalundagin mo ba ang isang ilaw sa ilog?\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE MIS-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]11/18/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Sovereign Mission 7015-03}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=meeting.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The meeting venue between Saki Matsumoto, leader of the Worker's Coalition Movement, and Umino.\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n//Before starting the meeting proper with Saki Matsumoto, an hour was dedicated to all participants watching an animation film called Volt-In, produced under Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. Volt-In is focused on five Earthling pilots of a 20-meter-tall robot called \"Volt,\" made to fight against a repressive Solar Dominion. The Solar Dominion is an interstellar oligarchic monarchy focused on forcibly assimilating egalitarian planetary states into a state of absolute uniformity and obedience.//\n\n//At the end, the pilots, who are nearly destroyed via missiles alongside Volt, inspire the abused workers of a central planet of the Solar Dominion to rebel, severely weakening it.//\n\n**UMINO:** (//Claps.//) Mrs. Matsumoto. This film, Volt-In, required the best out of our animators and writers, and we needed to pour at least 10 million dollars into making it. And that's without the do-it-yourself robot figurines that we have already mass-produced in a few factories. (//Places an assembled toy robot.//) But many of these will be wasted if you don't cooperate with us, Mrs. Matsumoto.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** You know, kid, our issue is not just about the effort. I know that whoever you are - Aviatica[[footnote]]Cover company used by the Philippine Branch.[[/footnote]], isn't it? - is rich enough to fund metric truckloads of these anime and other propaganda pieces.\n\n**UMINO:**  (//Raises a hand.//) So, Mrs. Matsumoto, would you be - \n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Our question is,. what's the assurance that we won't be left hanging dry after all of these? You focus so much on the propaganda and the flashy stuff, but when the actual day of the revolution comes, you might suddenly wash your hands off us. And also, what's the price? \n\n//Umino sighs deeply.//\n\n**UMINO:** You want to know how much we have invested into this whole operation, Mrs. Matsumoto? //2 billion dollars//. That's not accounting for the prior support we gave to you in the past decades so you and your little band of occultists and worker's rights advocates can buy ammo and build up intel. The total amount we splurged is a good chunk of Korea's GDP, but we sure can afford it. \n\n//Matsumoto scratches his left cheek.//\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** So, it really is a massive investment on your part, but still, what comes after all of it? After all of these robot anime and propaganda?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Grins.//) A new beginning, Mrs. Matsumoto. (//Stands up.//) If you were to ever break off from our movement here, you will be losing out your voice to speak out together with the other worker's rebellion and cultural revivalist movements that we are currently bankrolling. It's a sad fate, considering that you are especially proud of your magic as a weapon of change. Too bad though, that there are many more disillusioned residents in the Empire who can fill in for you.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Hmm, are you underestimating me and my group?\n\n**UMINO:** No, you're actually rather strong, especially with how you gathered a lot of influence despite being on the top of the red list. But the Empire is something you can't screw with so easily, even if it's rotten to the core. It can still stomp you flat, even with your decades of occultist know-how and thousands of rallyists, Mrs. Matsumoto. We are pretty careful with dealing with it. Think about why we're so focused on subversion and not on actual war, Mrs. Matsumoto.\n\n//Matsumoto scratches his heavily scarred left cheek.//\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Hahh. It does not answer the question of what comes after all these, though? Would you... puppet us Koreans? Is the endgame being that we become independent from Japan, but not actually free? You do have many of our information networks, propaganda, and even our supply chains.\n\n**UMINO:** (//Sighs.//) We can't, and that's the good thing for you. Once everything in the Empire comes to a boiling point, it would make it very hard for us to do something more substantial here. Being separated by thousands of kilometers will do that. You will functionally become independent even from us. You and workers can set up shop by your own, and you will have a lot of room for that. \n\nThough, there's this concept in our culture called \"utang na loob.\" We poured 2 billion dollars into supporting your activities, particularly your ammo, intel, and propaganda. We did so much for you, so wouldn't it make sense to at least stay as friends? (//Grins.//)\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Sangbusangjo. Boiguksa. They mean give and take in the old language. Are they what you mean? (//Umino nods.//) Hmmn, still, it's a very complicated situation. We aren't even sure which country you came from. Some say that you are funded by the Russians. The others say you are part of a secret Chinese enclave somewhere from the South. A few argue that you are a bunch of war profiteers from Southeast Asia.  \n\n**UMINO:** (//Chuckles.//) Siguro nga, parang Rusya minsan ang galawan namin, and mukha naman akong Tsino.[[footnote]]Filipino for \"Perhaps, yea, we do act sometimes like Russia, and I do look like a Chinese.\"[[/footnote]] Well, you're way off the mark. \n\nBut tell me, Mrs. Matsumoto, do //we// even really have much of a choice here?\n\n//Matsumoto slightly flinches and frowns.//\n\n**UMINO:** Let me recall an old story you told me a few months ago. As a man who has been alive and kicking since the 1920s, you have been unsuccessfully doing multiple uprisings and revolutionary attempts against the Empire. All of them were stomped down, but for some reason, you keep escaping and managing to de-age yourself with some techniques. You have lost a lot of your family to the Japanese purges, and You even talked about how some of your subordinates were carted off to laboratories in Manchuria. You saw your culture wither away in this Empire. \n\n//Umino pours another glass of wine for Matsumoto.//\n\n**UMINO:** But no one outside Korea cared. To the Americans, your Korea was a rebellious, backwater Japanese colony. My country was an American puppet at that point, and we had to deal with a lot of ethnic troubles too. To the Soviets, you were something used to draw borders in the Far East. But now... you are lucky to have us. Someone willing you to go through thick and thin for you.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Luck, eh? There's no such thing as a miracle or a lucky break on the geopolitical stage. Only trade-offs.\n\n**UMINO:** Maybe, maybe not. But you have finally have a chance to turn things around for your culture.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** It's no longer even about the culture at this point. That's why I'm rather confused about your intense focus on all that cultural revival stuff. It's been decades since the native culture on Korea has been extinguished, and even I can no longer remember much about my childhood in the... in the 1900s. The fog of time has caught up so badly, and it doesn't help that only a few of us remember the time before the Japanese came. So, I personally see it as pointless. Culture can't feed us, especially once it's long-dead.\n\n**UMINO:** Hmmn, cultural revival, eh.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** (//Softly chuckles.//) You did tell back a story about how your family wanted to restore the culture on this godforsaken peninsula, right? How you came all the way for your culture? Too bad it's not what the workers or even the common masses want. \n\n//Umino stands up and drinks a shot of wine. He is silent for several seconds.//\n\n**UMINO:** You do have a good point there. Cultural genocide over the decades is certainly hell to deal with, and it's nothing like what happens in the movies. People just don't magically regain their culture and sense of pride after decades of oppression. Hell, some of them even go back to glorifying their oppressors. But you forgot a certain point.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** What? You want to wax poetic about culture? \n\n**UMINO:** Sure, let me do so for a bit. (//Chuckles.//) Cultural revivals may not really feed mouths, but it can feed dreams. And... (//Puts down his glass.//) if you want an actual revolution to succeed, you need a myth at the center of it all - a legend. Desperate masses don't simply cling to promises of food and land; they need to grasp an idea. Even if the idea or culture itself is bastardized, people can base their egos and hopes on it. \n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Even if the idea is false, right? \n\n**UMINO:** Hmmn, sure. Millions can die for an ideology or culture that they might not really fully understand. Even the Japanese think that their samurai honor code, the bushido, actually exists, when in fact it was actually invented by someone wanting to suck up to Americans. We're all based on convenient lies. But it comforts their pride, and that's the important thing.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Big words for a pawn like you. Well, it's not as if I can talk.\n\n**UMINO:** Even if I'm a pawn in the whole grand scheme of things, I can assure you they're all my words, and that they're true. I wouldn't have graduated from an expensive-as-hell university like De La Salle if I don't know how to make //bola-bola//[[footnote]]Filipino for flattery.[[/footnote]]. Alrighty, enough talk for now. I want to show you something, Mrs. Matsumoto, that will serve as my promise that this operation will succeed. On the other hand, it will signify whether you are willing to take the cards we offer you.\n\n//Umino signals an assistant to unravel a thaumaturgic flying lantern on the meeting table.//\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** A lantern? \n\n**UMINO:** It can transform into a mecha, you know. I call it Lantron, and it can fly, explode and accelerate time. It's kinda like Volt-In. If you want to get in the mood while activating it, you can even shout \"Volt-In!\" Trust me, it works. \n \n**MATSUMOTO:** Really? \n\n**UMINO:** Of course not, we don't have the budget to actually make it transform into a robot. We aren't making toys, after all.  It's true though that it can fly, explode, and accelerate time. If you think about it carefully, those are what a mecha can do. \n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Stop joking around, you damned rascal. \n\n//Umino chuckles softly.//\n\n**UMINO:** On a more serious note, this lantern is the best sabotage technology we can afford and sneak into the festivals. We have already mass-produced the lantern within our factories in Southern China, Manchuria, and Vietnam, so you don't need to worry about running out of them. Once thousands of these lanterns explode at the designated time and above a certain city, a very //wonderful// thing will happen to the city. \n\n//Via the meeting room's TV, Umino then displays a short snippet of a video simulating Phase 2 to Matsumoto. The details have been limited to prevent information leakage.//\n\n**UMINO:** Once the lanterns explode, communications can become limited throughout the city. Although, we will be sending in journalists and social media influencers to cover you, so we can make sure you get your voice out to the masses.\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** (//Mumbling.//) Just how far are you willing to go...\n\n**UMINO:** In any case, here's the deal, Mrs. Matsumoto. If you back out from Phase 2 of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, you lose out on all the opportunities that you can get from being an influential occultist member, and quite possibly, you and all your workers get fired or even executed due to charges of treason. I think we all know how paranoid the Japanese can be, right? Plus, if you hold your rallies without us, I'm not sure that many of you will be safe or even survive. If you agree though, we would like you to -\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Cast all the necessary thaumaturgic spells on these lanterns? \n\n**UMINO:** At the same time, we ask for your men to carry around the festival stalls and telescreens. We can't showcase all the animation without screens, after all, and how can we sell these toy mecha if we don't even have a table to put them on?\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** Can't you send all your personnel... it's really a goddamn proxy war, isn't it?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Grins.//) Personally, I think you should see it as a way to trailblaze your own destiny amidst all the crappiness of this world. Plus, think of our help as just lucky charms. We certainly increased your chances, no?\n\n**MATSUMOTO:** (//Huffs.//) Let me think about it for a second. \n\n**UMINO:** You have the option of extinguishing that lantern. There's a creek nearby where you can jump off together with it. Though why would you waste such a good and bright lantern? You haven't even let it fly yet.\n\n **MATSUMOTO:** Alright. We will cooperate with you, but only for the festivities. After that... \n\n**UMINO:** (//Sits down.//) A new sun will be rising soon.

While previous endeavors, such as Operation [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6815 HINODE], have pacified chances of national awakening, Site-731 specialists and MTF ほ-02 (\"Ninja Raccoon Dogs\") raised urgent concerns involving a wide-scale MEZAME-involved phenomenon, often referred to by captured entities as the \"Comic Convention.\"\n\nAvailable intel indicates that the Comic Convention is an attempt to showcase multitudes of cultural relics and propagandistic works, particularly literature and illustrations, related to anomalous Peninsular and Mainland cultures. \n\nPlans for the Comic Convention have been set into motion as early as two decades ago, with as many as 130 principal MEZAME anomalies funding and coordinating their schemes discreetly. They have opted to launch them this year, coinciding with the deep economic recession that the Empire is currently facing. \n\nAs a counter-operation, the Directors' Executive Committee of the Japanese Branch of the Foundation has convened and decided to implement Operation MATSURI. Operation MATSURI is composed of two parts. First is a grand stockpile of films, literature, poems, and play scripts created in the last decade, designed to overwhelm plots similar to that planned by the MEZAME anomalies. With executive control of the Divine Winds over the Linked Net, the Foundation Department of Propaganda can further amplify the effect. \n\nThe second part, meanwhile, refers to live-stage concerts, performances, and celebrity showcases, to take advantage of celebrity worship of normal Imperial citizens. For proper conduct, Operation MATSURI sets the Japanese Branch on Class-A Red Alert, dedicating a minimum of 10 percent of the Branch's personnel and resources. The Imperial Army and Navy are also on high alert.\n\nOperation MATSURI will be fully realized during November, when annual Imperial festivities are underway. Further benefits of Operation MATSURI are stimulated economic activity and boosted morale over citizens. With the recommendations of Site-731 and the Philippine Branch, a significant amount of Japanese Branch resources has been directed to Operation MATSURI's promotion.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the Empire's long-time allies, the Philippines, will serve as further assurance to the success of Operation MATSURI. In exchange for improved trade deals, the Philippines has delivered 200 million dollars of assistance and funding to Operation MATSURI. \n\nThe Philippine Branch of the Foundation has also committed to sending approximately 13,500 personnel - many of whom are field agents and thaumaturges - to the Empire. Previously, many of these personnel have enthusiastically contributed to the end of the MEZAME phenomenon, providing valuable intel on artifacts[[footnote]]These artifacts were hoarded by the Philippines since 65 years ago, and were planted into specific vantage points throughout the Empire.[[/footnote]] and entities[[footnote]]Only entities deemed insignificant to Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, and they were given warnings to escape.[[/footnote]]. As such, they have been deemed trustworthy and committed to the Imperial cause.\n\nThe Empire is not stagnant, nor is it overreaching. Operation MATSURI is a demonstration of Japan's superiority over anomalies and inferior entities, and it shall be the highlight of one of the Empire's most sacred month. The situation will be developed necessarily to Japan's advantage. \n \n++ //Tenno Heika Banzai!//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Philippine Announcement Concerning Operation MATSURI.\" hide=\"<< CODE: Kapag tinangkang itaas ang lambal ay puputok ang isang kapsula...\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE JPL-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]10/21/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Operation FILIBUSTERISMO Declaration}}[[/size]]**\n\n= [[image philogo.png width=\"210px\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white\"]]\n\n//Padayon//, people of the Philippine Branch! \n\n\"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\"\n\nOperation FILIBUSTERISMO is now in full force due to the geopolitical serendipity of the Japanese Branch's actions. There were several means for the Japanese Empire to respond to the core gambit of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. \n\nFirst is the most straightforward - directly funnel their funds and resources into destroying the Operation FILIBUSTERISMO collaborators. They have attempted to do so, with varying levels of success. However, the Empire is ossifying under the bureaucratic weight of holding the bulk of the Great East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and more importantly, their deep economic recession is ravaging them.\n\nSecond is more apt for the highly honor and superiority-bound culture of the Empire - outmatch anything it deems inferior. The Philippine Branch wagered that the Japanese Branch will also possess the same outlook, and judging by the Japanese Branch's response, it played its cards right. It also put its trust into the actions made to gain Japan's trust, using the artifacts and bloodline of Korea and China as tools, \"stock,\" and bait. \n\nLastly, it is within the Philippines' luck that Japanese entertainment has stagnated over the last few decades, only relying on highly censored or supervised live action dramas, literature, and more recently, video games. The wasted and disillusioned //talents// of the Empire have been recycled into uncontrollable //inspirations//. In a way, the lack of Japanese creativity in certain areas such as comics is a stroke of luck.\n\nThere is no independently organized \"Comic Convention\" that will compete with the Empire's Operation MATSURI. After all, the Comic Convention is Operation MATSURI. The true meaning of FILIBUSTERISMO - Subversion - thus comes into play. All personnel, resources, and produced materials of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, offline or online, are mandated to arrive at designated positions for the second phase. The takeover, lasting one day in real time, will be sufficient to deal a blow to the complacent Empire.\n\nShould the Empire be sufficiently weakened, the Philippines and its Foundation Branch moves further in establishing its brand of normalcy, based on three core tenets: Secure dominance and a stronger voice among all branches. Contain the possibilities of the Sovereign dreams of superiority. Protect normalcy from oppression.\n\nThe Eight-Rayed Sun of the Philippines will triumph over the smoldering Red Sun. The Philippines offers the Empire the following words, \"MENE THECEL PHARES.\"[[footnote]]Your days are numbered.[[/footnote]]\n\n++ //Mabuhay ang Maharlika!//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=celebration.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Paper lanterns released over Shinshuu, accompanied by fireworks.\n]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\nFor Phase 2 of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, the pair was transferred to Provisional Site-444, 50km away from Heijo, Korea. Heijo is one of the key cities of Northern Korea, due to its ancient cultural prestige, population, and industries. It is also the site of the Worker's Coalition Movement's planned protests, thus serving as an ideal location for Operation FILIBUSTERISMO.\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Sovereign Mission 7015-04.\" hide=\"<< CODE: Sa ikasiyam ay nakaputok na marahil ang makina at ang tunog ay nadinig.\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE MIS-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]11/01/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Sovereign Mission 7015-04}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=painting.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Created by the Propaganda Division for later dissemination, this illustration depicts Kitsukumi as a \"Kimonojou.\"[[footnote]]Derived from kimono, a traditional Japanese clothing, and ojou, meaning a high-class, wealthy girl.[[/footnote]] \n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**LOCATION:**  Heijo, Korea (Formerly known as Pyongyang)\n\n= -- {{START LOG}} -- \n\n//Kitsukumi and Umino are on a mission to patrol Heijo and monitor the progress of various Operation FILIBUSTERISMO personnel. Heijo is currently celebrating a variation of Gion Odori, Japan's main November festival originally localized to Kyoto. At the opening of festivities, Heijo is currently packed with three million residents. Hundreds of stalls, fairs, and stages line the streets of Heijo.//\n\n//Their first stop is the Heijo no Yasukuni Shrine, which glorifies the soldiers and officials in charge of the Japanese invasions of Korea and China. Inside, a drummer hits a one-meter-tall mitsudomoe taiko drum, signalling all residents in the vicinity, totalling up to a hundred, to enter and pay their respects to the shrine. Umino signals a hesitant Kitsukumi to enter the shrine's torii gates.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Pouring water on left and right hands via a ladle, as a mandatory purification ritual.//) Shouldn't we go away? This shrine is... is something we shouldn't pray to, right?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Quietly chanting a thaumaturgic spell.//) Play along for now. We have to first check the people here. \n\n//At the main hall, Kitsukumi and Umino wait for their turn to ring the main bell and make five-yen offerings. Umino rings the bell again, thrice this time, before also clapping thrice.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Aren't we supposed to ring the bell and clap twice only? \n\n**UMINO:** That's a signal. Look. That shrine maiden over there - the one with brown hair, a lamp in hand, and a bird perched on her shoulders  - is looking at us. That's our accomplice.\n\n//Umino then sends a small stream of water upwards, where he directs it towards the shrine maiden. Approaching the alerted shrine maiden, the stream of water forms into rows of small kanji characters containing the check-up message. The kanji characters disappear after five seconds. The shrine maiden then blinks the lantern thrice.//\n\n**UMINO:** They're A-OK. Let's go now, Kitsukumi. This shrine will blow up in the next few hours. Next stop would be the theater.\n\n//At the shrine's gates, Kitsukumi nearly bows as a sign of respect, but stops herself.//\n\n**UMINO:** Hoshimi, don't you think that the gods should bless us, since we did all the proper rituals?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Lightly chuckles.//) I wonder.\n\n//They then course through the Seikai Mondori Street, leading to the Heijo Grand Theater. The Theater, formerly dedicated to operas featuring revolutions against Korean and Chinese \"invaders\" and \"barbarians,\" had been renovated into a film-centered establishment. Umino then sends another stream of water towards one window. It then returns.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** What's their response? \n\n**UMINO:** I hate to break this to you... but the anime our personnel were carrying suddenly became anomalous and trapped them in the animes' worlds. We have to free them.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Huh? Wha - what?\n\n**UMINO:** Just joking. The dokkaebi in charge of taking over the theater managed to shape-shift all our personnel inside, and they knocked out all of the original Japanese staff. They're busy configuring the theater's software with the anime films we produced. They asked us a favor. Hoshimi, can you change the film billboard to instead feature the anime films' titles?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Su - sure. But won't it reveal our positions too early? (//Takes out the anime primers and begins chanting the pertinent spells.//)\n\n**UMINO:** No, not really. Just make sure that it makes people think that they're really the titles scheduled for the theater.\n\n//A mechanical bird sent from the Propaganda Division approaches Umino, providing him with a news scroll. In exchange, Umino jots down notes and gives them to the bird.//\n\n**UMINO:** Alright, at this point, everything's A-OK. The last stage would be to get to the Sho Warehouse. Walking there would take us through the heart of the city, and into the outskirts.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Wait, isn't that where you will be getting ready to fly the propaganda packages soon? \n\n**UMINO:** Yep. In three hours, Phase 2 will officially begin. Walking to Sho Warehouse will need at least an hour, or hmm, an hour and a half. Then, another hour for me to transform and get the packages loaded onto me.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** I... I see. \n\n**UMINO:** I can take you back to Site-444 if you want. At least you're safe there.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** No... no. I should see this through to the end. \n\n**UMINO:** OK then. Let's just enjoy the festivities for now.\n\n//The pair then arrives in the Grand Pavilion, filled with bustling shops for food and stationery, towering bath houses, and Heijo's MRT and LRT lines. They then ride the train, disembarking at the Takuni Plaza Station. Several hundreds of citizens, young and old, have gathered in the plaza. A group of intricately dressed geisha perform a flower dance, which the two watch. Kitsukumi rejects several beggars approacing her for alms. She then notices policemen silently taking away them away soon from the streets.//\n\n**UMINO:** Don't pay attention to them. The police here like to keep every man and woman here happy. They aren't counted as people. (//Kitsukumi frowns.//)\n\n//They then proceed to the Silver Horse Megamarket in the Eastern District. They haggle with a old, scarred vendor for fried liver. Afterwards, they approach a maker of flying lanterns.//\n\n**LANTERN-MAKER:** Oii, young lady over there, and ohh, a //favored customer.// (//The lantern-maker quickly chants a spell, to which Umino responds by clapping thrice.//) \n\n **UMINO:** How are the sales?\n\n**LANTERN-MAKER:** We nearly got discovered by the Japanese Branch. Many of their agents - I think, around 23? - are prowling the streets - looks like they caught some wind of the whole thing. They checked the flying lanterns.\n\n **UMINO:** I thought they got distracted enough by the Comic Convention's fake locations. Did they see them? \n\n**LANTERN-MAKER:** No, we haven't fully applied the spells to them yet. That's gonna happen in one hour, and the final touches will be applied by batch. Plus, the vast majority of the flying lanterns are in Philippine factories and warehouses. Is the girl part of those who will defend the city in the takeover?\n\n//Kitsukumi nods.// \n\n**LANTERN-MAKER:** Well, good luck to both of you then. \n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Let's hurry, Umino.\n\n//Kitsukumi and Umino then pace through the busy streets, where vendors sell yakitori, takoyaki, candied hawthorns, sushi, and rice rolls. They briefly stop in front of a digital screen explaining the fabricated Japanese origins of flying lanterns, which are originally only used in Korean and Chinese cultures.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** \"Starting since the rule of the most honorable Emperor Daigo, and the proud Japanese of the Peninsular kingdom of Mimana meant to symbolize the resistance against invaders from the mainland...\" these are all false, no?\n\n**UMINO:** Yep. The Japanese had the idea of assimilating flying lanterns into festivities, probably because they were pretty. So they created a whole mythology behind them. Very effective honestly, since even the Philippines didn't know at first what they're for. But now, we're going to take them back to where they should belong. (//Grins.//)\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** I see. Jaa, should we enjoy them, then? As a sort of advance celebrations?\n\n**UMINO:** If you want to, though I think it's a bit too early. (//Kitsukumi chuckles.//)\n\n//The Grand Imperial March, composed of a thousand soldiers from the Chuuhei and the Higashidaiin-ri Barracks, is starting to assemble near the city center. On the other hand, protestors on the opposite district are congregating in buildings, ready to come out upon the signal. In a secluded area, Umino is sending out streams of water upwards, to serve as messages to various collaborators. Meanwhile, Kitsumi is buying various mementos, including a fox mask, near the shop. It is one hour before the climax of Phase 2 commences.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** You know, Umino, I have a question. This is it, right?\n\n**UMINO:** Yea, this event's the culmination of an operation years... no, decades in the making. It's pretty much the luckiest opportunity Koreans, Chinese, and the Philippine Branch will ever have.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** I see.\n\n//Kitsukumi stops walking. She then takes off her fox mask, and clutches it.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** The Japanese Empire and its Foundation Branch will soon probably take quick action. The whole thing, after all, is objectively an anomaly. Even the officials back at Site-444 don't know what will exactly happen afterwards. Especially to us too. You will be flying through Korea, delivering stuff, while I will be helping out in setting up the lanterns and the time barriers. Both are extremely risky, though hopefully, things work out.\n\n//Kitsukumi tries to smile, although she falters, coughing due to the smoke from a stall. She nearly bumps into a youth.//\n\n**UMINO:** Oi, watch your steps. (//Clutches Kitsukumi's shoulders.//) Let's keep going to the warehouse. I know a secluded spot near there where we can see the fireworks and the lanterns pretty well.\n \n**KITSUKUMI:** Are you looking for one last good time with me? (//Chuckles.//)\n\n**UMINO:** In another sense of the word, yea.\n\n//The pair then takes 10 minutes to travel to the spot. It is a desolated Buddhist shrine, albeit with an intact bench where they sit. Kitsukumi partially wears her fox mask on the side of her head. The pair stays slient for a few minutes.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Minoru, as a writer and illustrator, I wonder if this really is how our story together should be. I occasionally dream about a sort of what if. What if I didn't find any letters from my dad, and if I didn't bother drawing silly little comics to share with revolutionists, you know, that sort of thing. We would never meet, right? \n\n**UMINO:** Probably, though I would still be kicked to this godforsaken empire to do dirty work. It would be extremely unlikely for us to meet though, even if its just a second-long eye lock. \n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Hmmn, say, Minoru, do you think we're lucky to have gone through all these stuff together?\n\n**UMINO:** (//Faces Kitsukumi.//) Hmmn, perhaps... quite? No, I'm definitely sure that the answer is yes.\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Covers her face with the mask.//) Your \"definitely\" there didn't sound too definite. (//Chuckles.//)\n\n**UMINO:** Even if Operation FILIBUSTERISMO rattled the empire, I'm sure that your family will bear its effects, and you will still be safe and sound. But... I personally think that our story up to now is a good stroke of luck. You get to write your manga and have adventures an ordinary person wouldn't have in their lifetime. Meanwhile, I wouldn't have to always go curse my luck in getting assigned to missions. (//Sighs.//)\n\n//The pair is silent for a few minutes. Soon, fireworks light up the sky, while bombastic orchestral music can be faintly heard from the pair's location.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Faces and embraces Umino.//) It's almost time for us to head to our stations. Haah... do you still remember the yeowu guseul? The fox marble that gumiho keep in their mouth? Did you know that it's for good luck?\n\n**UMINO:** I thought it contained knowledge.\n \n**KITSUKUMI:** A book I once read said that good luck is merely a result of multiple calculated moves made through the power of wisdom and foresight from available information. When you will be soon flying, you would need a very good awareness of your surroundings, you know?\n\n//Umino stays silent, with eyes closed.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Hmmnn, I guess it's time to act like an actual young lady for once. (//Stands up and bows.//) In any case, let me express my gratitude for letting me experience all of these. Thank you very much too, for letting me have the chance to redeem my family's name. \n\n**UMINO:** (//Stands up.//) You're welcome, Hoshimi. Alright then, let's go to the - \n\n//Kitsukumi then kisses Umino, delivering the yeowu guseul. After the kiss, Kitsukumi hurriedly puts on the fox mask. The two are silent for several seconds, although Umino grasps one of Kitsukumi's hands.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** That was, that was you know, just for good luck! A-anyway, I hope that tomorrow, we wake up to a world where the moon shines more beautifully. Then, please take care of this airheaded foxgirl in front of you, Minoru.\n\n**UMINO:** (//Sighs and embraces Kitsukumi.//) Sure, Hoshimi. Let's do our best then. \n\n//Several flying lanterns float amidst the fireworks. They soon begin their thaumaturgic mechanisms for memetic influences.

They first envelop the target city in a temporal manipulation barrier, accelerating the flow of time within the city. In theory, one day inside the time barrier is equal to half a day outside. As a result of this barrier, most communications outside the cities have been also cut, aside from the Linked Net. Second, they emit a mild memetic effect on the populace, urging them to consume the media and propaganda used in Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. Third, they explode near military barracks, as well as Japanese Branch Sites.\n\nThrough proxy networks set up in SCP-7015 and its neighboring countries, the Philippine Branch conducts multiple large-scale cyber attacks on government facilities and Japanese Branch communication networks. The hacks were based on Foundation cybersecurity protocols shared between international sites, as well as Japanese Branch protocols obtained via infiltration and social engineering. Sufficient care has been taken in avoiding servers needed for containment of the Japanese Branch's anomalies.\n\nFurthermore, Japanese social media sites, and their Linked Net in general, have been flooded with content, such as manga and animation, related to Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. SCP-7015's Divine Wind protocol for their Linked Net has been partially circumvented, although Japanese Branch webcrawlers and cybersecurity specialists have stemmed progress.\n\n= **[[04:01:06]]**\n\nStalls providing manga, comics, illustrations, and art for free have been launched throughout a total of 79 cities, such as Heijo. Multiple telescreens showcasing animation have also been installed in conspicuous locations. Additionally, deepfake videos depicting the apologies of major Japanese officials, such as Yuusei Tojo and the Emperor, have been prepared. These videos focus on \"apologies\" in terms of \"displaying the truth of our shared history.\"\n\nTo provide plausible deniability, multiple Philippine factories, embassies, and establishments were severely bombed or damaged by Operation FILIBUSTERISMO personnel. Philippine Branch agents present in the region have vowed to superficially cooperate with the Japanese Branch.\n\nThe time barriers, supported by Scranton reality anchors and the thaumaturgic chants of personnel such as Kitsukumi, withstand multiple attacks and bombings from the Japanese Branch, which has mobilized faster than expected. Kitsukumi and other content creators with thaumaturgic capabilites are located in their own stalls, alternating between catering to customers and festival-goers and chanting.\n\n= **[[06:02:01]]**\n\nApproximately 740,000 Korean and Chinese entities, such as SCP-7015-HAETAE and SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI, are now present and active in assisting Operation FILIBUSTERISMO forces in repelling the Japanese Branch. SCP-7015-HAETAE, currently located in Heijo, has been thaumaturgically neutralizing fires and reality-manipulation bombs dropped on the city. \n\nMeanwhile, draconic entities, such as Umino, have been delivering animation telescreens and comics throughout rural areas in Korea, Manchuria, and China. Umino, in particular, was soon redirected to the Yellow Sea, the body of water separating Korea and Mainland China. The region has multiple Japanese Branch Sites and SCP-7015's navy bases, all of which are on Red Alert.\n\nIn the region, Umino and his companions have to contend with dogfights against jets and airplanes deployed from aircraft carriers. They were considerably damaged from energy blasts from the experimental thaumaturgic guns of ships such as Yamato. Furthermore, the Japanese Branch sent out MTF-ん-1 (\"Cowhands\"), composed of shrine maidens, thaumaturgic specialists, and monks. MTF-ん-1 was airdropped from planes, and fought draconic entities while in parachutes.\n\nUmino and the other water dragons then stayed at an instructed vantage point in the middle of the Yellow Sea, and activated his hydro-manipulatory capabilities. During this process, they were protected by their compatriots. After 30 minutes, a low-pressure area was created in the region, with multiple whirlpools and storm surges. Multiple wounded dragons have also conducted kamikaze attacks on the bases themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, MTF-ん-1 specialists have also besieged cities taken over by Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. Within six hours of the takeover, nine cities have been retaken, although the vast majority of Philippine Branch personnel and Korean / Chinese collaborators have either escaped or self-terminated.\n\n15 percent of all collaborator entities have been redirected to Japanese Branch Sites, such as Site-335, Site-731, and Site-333. The vast majority of these entities were terminated by the sophisticated defenses of the Sites, although they managed to divert or waste personnel and resources away from Operation FILIBUSTERISMO hotspots.\n\n= **[[08:01:00]]**\n\nAs of this time, approximately 126 million residents throughout SCP-7015 are still affected by Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. Surveys taken by personnel indicate that  61.3 percent of the respondents feel a mixture of confusion, interest, and disillusionment against SCP-7015, after consuming Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. On the other hand, the Japanese Branch has managed to repel a considerable amount of the cyber attacks, and have regained control of the Divine Winds protocols and SCP-7015's Linked Net. It has also mobilized the standby Japanese Army forces.\n\nWorker rights, cultural revival, and formerly underground revolutionary protests and rallyists have also broken out in 40 cities still under Operation FILIBUSTERISMO. At least three cities in Northwest and Northeast China have been taken over by independent rallyists.\n\nThe Japanese Branch has successfully used ENNUI-level amnestic agents and MTF forces on 23 cities, breaking them away from Operation FILIBUSTERISMO control. Philippine Branch memetic agents, however, have stemmed the effects.\n\n= **[[12:00:05]]**\n\nOperation FILIBUSTERISMO forces and collaborator entities, now only operating at 51 percent capacity after all the attacks, are preparing to escape. At this point, most objectives of Operation FILIBUSTERISMO have been met. Remaining Japanese social media sites have been inundated by propaganda, while multiple announcements have been released, declaring the festivities to be canceled. Meanwhile, amnestic agents targeting memories of the Philippine Branch among the majority of collaborator entities have been released. \n\nJapanese Branch forces have been severely weakened and scattered throughout the vast reaches of SCP-7015. Analysis indicates that destabilization is underway, particularly in the Northern and Southern regions of China, as well as Manchuria. Breakdown of the Veil within SCP-7015, particularly in more distant Chinese territories, is also expected. However, regions and territories near the Japanese Home Islands, such as South Korea and Taiwan, are still stable.\n\n= -- {{END LOG}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nDepicting Kitsukumi and Umino in the final hours of the operation, a log illustrating the Operation FILIBUSTERISMO escape plan has been provided below.\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Sovereign Mission 7015-05\" hide=\"<< CODE: Ano ang mapapawi?\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE MIS-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]11/02/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Sovereign Mission 7015-05}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=90%\n|url=explosion.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The collapse of the temporal acceleration barrier for containing Heijo.\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px; color:white;\"]]\n\n**LOCATION:** Heijo, Korea (Formerly Pyongyang)\n\n= -- {{START LOG}} -- \n\n//Foundation-made thaumaturgic time sinks have been set to self-detonate. The time-accelerating barriers are on the verge of collapse, while the remaining flying lantern weapons have been deployed. Signal lanterns are blinking thrice every three seconds, indicating retreat mode. During retreat, however, Kitsukumi was separated.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Damn it! Where are they now? (//Operates her transceiver.//) No signal... I guess this it, then. \n\n//Kitsukumi disposes of her bulkier equipment and lights them on fire, while she transforms into her vulpine form. She then begins to run through the streets of Heijo, which have been emptied of citizens and personnel. She courses through partially destroyed buildings, although she becomes cornered by an array of flags suddenly blocking her path. Five beeps can be heard in the vicinity.//\n\n//Japanese Foundation Branch Agent Nao Aishinkakura, alongside MTF-ん-1 shrine maidens and priests, corner Kitsukumi. They fire their thaumaturgic exorcism guns and spears at Kitsukumi, wounding her shoulder and transforming her back to her humanoid form.//\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** I see. Foxgirl, we have met in the past, haven't we? It's unfortunate for you that this is how it ends. \n\n//Kitsukumi fires a fire-based thaumaturgic spell towards her pursuers, but the shrine maidens swiftly block it. However, she then manages to escape towards another building. She positions herself in a narrow corridor, where she successfully wounds one agent. She then transforms back into a fox and digs her claws beneath the ribs of one of the agents, conducting a pinpoint attack on the liver. She manages to heal back by ingesting the blood from the liver, soon escaping. In an open area, she launches a rescue flare.//\n\n//Multiple flags fly towards her, stabbing one of her legs. She then shifts back to a humanoid form, and vocalizes a call for help. MTF-ん-1 surrounds and prepares to exorcise and neutralize her.//\n\n//MTF-ん-1 agents now chant purification prayers, Furthermore, they dance using taiko drums, leaf branches, and paper fans for the ritual, imitating the moves of yaegaki and Noh plays. Kitsukumi attempts to crawl away, but her arms are pinned down by Japanese flags.//\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** It's such a shame, isn't it? But this is a small price to pay for what you all did to the Empire. (//Smokes a cigarette.//) The Japanese Branch is doing its best, but I wonder if it's enough. Soon, hungry ravens might descend on the Empire, and all people living it will suffer the brunt of the chaos.\n\n//Offers a cigarette to Kitsukumi, who is currently accumulating injuries from the ritual.//\n\n **KITSUKUMI:** (//Coughs up blood.//) Don't you have some... somewhere else to be?\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** (//Sits down.//) Hmmn, I guess I am too responsible for cleaning up messes. Anyway, you... you're a defector from a family of traitor kitsune, no? I wonder if you have really fulfilled your goal, cause your country might end up puppeted by another.\n\n//Kitsukumi's body has considerably faded due to the purification ritual.//\n\n//However, high-pressure jets of water target and scatter MTF-ん-1, while groundwater erupts beneath Kitsukumi. A film of water envelopes Kitsukumi. Aishinkakura is considerably injured. Meanwhile, SCP-7015-HAETAE lands near her, emitting a loud roar. In the distance, Umino's draconic form is flying, blocking multiple roads with one-meter saltwater bubbles. Several dokkaebi also arrive via levitating logs, followed by SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI.//\n\n//SCP-7015-HAETAE's remaining eye is wounded, while its scales have sustained severe damage. Meanwhile, Umino has gaping holes and severe burns on its arms, chest, and neck. SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI is mildly injured compared to them.//\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Never thought that I would lose my last eye in an honorable battle. It's a... battle well-fought, isn't it, Heir of the Mireu and Imugi? (//Checks Kitsukumi.//) The young fox still breathes. You made it just in time.\n\n**UMINO:** Good. (//Cradles Kitsukumi.//) Hoshimi, are you still awake?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** Hmnn, Umino... you're still here.  \n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** Oi, you two be careful! The shrine maidens 'n the Flag Girl are back on their feet! (//Orders its subordinates to battle Aishinkakura and MTF-ん-1.//)\n\n**AISHINKAKURA:** (//Gasping.//) Lion dog, dragon, fox, and demon! Damn it, so you really are all in the same place!\n\n//Aishinkakura waves two Japanese flags on each hand, waving them in a cyclical motion. Multiple patterned energy blasts strike SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI. Aishinkakura then plants a flag deeply on the ground, which rapidly manifests a row of flagpoles which nearly skewer Umino and Kitsukumi. SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI and its subordinates then lunge towards Aishinkakura, fighting using their clubs against Aishinkakura's flag and sword.//\n\n//The shrine maidens of MTF-ん-1 fire at Umino and Kitsukumi using their automatic rifles, but Umino summons a shield of rapidly solidifying seawater.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** (//Bleeding.//) Was... it a good fight? Did my yeowu guseul... help you?\n\n**UMINO:** Yea, yeah. I could see the ships and the jets in front of me much more clearly.\n\n//Kitsukumi then grabs onto Umino, kissing him.//\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** It's... somewhat spent now, but there's still a lot remaining. Please... use it as much as... possible.\n\n**UMINO:** Don't, don't worry. We'll get you out of here, ok?\n\n**KITSUKUMI:** ...Mino... make me promi... something. Once all of this... ends... let's go back to writing and drawing an... ok? I wonder... what kinds of stories we will have...\n\n**UMINO:** Ok, I will try as much as possible to do that.  I will just first make sure that you're safe. Dowa, can you get away from here with Hoshimi?\n\n//SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI had mostly repelled MTF-ん-1 into retreating, at the cost of several subordinates and a wounded arm. At this point, Kitsukumi has become unconscious.// \n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** Sure, kid. I know how to get outta' here, tho' me thinks I heard some bad news about the retreat?\n\n**UMINO:** What?\n\n**SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI:** We're supposed to scoot out through some subs and boats in the Yellow Sea, as you Operation FILI-whatever folks told us. The routes though, are blocked by Nihongents and soldiers. We need some firepower to go through them.\n\n**UMINO:** I, I... see.\n\n//Umino remains silent for a minute, before he summons his \"yeouiju\" orb. SCP-7000-HAETAE gasps slightly, but also falls silent.//\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Hmmn... one wonders if you are truly prepared to make that decision, Heir of the Mireu and Imugi. Using it for something so grand will utterly destroy your mind and body, to be frank. Let me serve in your place when it comes to clearing the routes. I'm the Protector, after all, and I'm ready to shed my blood on the soil of this country.\n\n**UMINO:** Ehhh.... you might still speak like that... but you look like a statue that has seen much better days, Lord Haetae. You won't last out there.\n\n**SCP-7015-HAETAE:** Well... I accede to that. But you are still very young with a bright future, Umino. It would be such a waste, and the little fox will need you.\n\n**UMINO:** She can manage. She's a strong young lady who knows what she does, and what she wants to do. Plus, I vowed to her since the start that she will make it out of here safe and sound. (//Smiles.//) Anyway, this is what my family would have wanted. \n\n//Umino directs a stream of water towards the orb, which begin to glow extremely brightly. He then faces SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI and Kitsukumi.//\n\n**UMINO:** (//Bows.//) Well then... Ms. Dowa, please take care of her. And... see you on the other side.\n\n//SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI and her remaining subordinates escape alongside Kitsukumi. SCP-7015-HAETAE and Umino silently stay in the plaza. After several minutes, Umino then chants towards the orb. SCP-7015-HAETAE provides the last piece of Umino's yeouiju orb. The orb begins to levitate and spin rapidly.//\n\n//Umino then puts his hand over his heart, and begins chanting towards the orb. SCP-7015-HAETAE also rapidly increases in size while also chanting in the extinct Korean language. Video recordings obtained from nearby drones drastically degrade in terms of quality and become filled with static.//\n\n//Monitoring stations more than 1.5 km away report visuals of a 100m-long draconic entity wrapped in rope-like aquatic formations. It carries a 10-meter high orb, decorated with repetitive, curved patterns and the characters of the long-dead Korean writing script and Chinese hanzi. Meanwhile, a 60m-high  leonine entity, surrounded by levitating aquatic formations shaped like swords, accompanies the draconic entity.//\n\n//Multiple high-speed streams of water attack the Japanese Branch agents blocking the way to evacuation. Using water formations, the pair proceeds to generate a multitude of Chinese and Korean script characters, alongside sceneries depicting vignettes or activities in daily life, within a 100km radius. Their forms bear the style of Kitsukumi's drawings, indicating that they are formed due to the yeowu guseul. To illustrate://\n\n# //A girl in hanbok, playing with a young boy in a garden labeled \"Hallim Park\". Historically, it was turned into a factory.//\n# //A Manchurian adolescent exiting from a textile factory. He soon returns to his home, where he hugs his sick brother.//\n# //A game developer playing on a banned console, rapidly smashing buttons.//\n# //A room of mangaka and her assistants rushing to draw and polish a chapter.//\n# //A girl and a boy in festival clothes, embracing each other amidst the fireworks and lanterns.//\n\n//Approximately 700 members of MTF-ん-1 were soon airdropped from multiple planes and helicopters, conducting a heavily synchronized fan and drum dance in the sky. The dance manifested multiple high-intensity thaumaturgic blasts towards the pair, neutralizing many aquatic water formations. In return, the pair shot out high-intensity water jets and strong gusts of wind, although the shrine maidens were able to counter via a kinetic paper fan chant.//\n\n//MTF-ん-1 soon retreated via teleportation talismans. Fifteen minutes later, Japanese Branch army forces barraged the pair with volleys of thermobaric and small-scale atomic bombs. These attacks, combined with the MTF-ん-1's damage earlier, caused the pair to crash into the buildings.//\n\n//The bodies of the pair soon turned into water and levitating bubbles, flooding Heijo.//\n\n//SCP-7015-DOKKAEBI later reported that a single jet of water traveled to it and Kitsukumi, just as they were about to board an evacuation submarine. The stream of water formed into message in Korean script characters, declaring, \"jal gayo - farewell.\"//\n\n//The jet of water lightly impacted onto the awakened Kitsukumi's hands, disappearing.//\n\n= -- {{END LOG}} -- \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n[[div class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\">> Operation FILIBUSTERISMO Aftermath Log.\" hide=\"<< CODE: Consummatum est.\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE MIS-0815[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]12/01/2020[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Operation FILIBUSTERISMO Aftermath Log}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=150\n|float=false\n|width=100%\n|url=http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/un-nuevo-comienzo-de-veralta/ph.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Greenbelt Park, Makati, Metro Manila.

The discussion has been translated into English.//\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** (//Commits the hand-over-heart salute.//) Mabuhay ang Maharlika, Simoun.\n\n**O5-13:** Mabuhay, Ezekier. Before we start, here's some coffee straight from the Cordillera highlands. Apparently, they're really experiencing good harvest.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Thank you... it's delicious, Simoun.\n\n**O5-13:** How's clean-up going?\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Going rather smoothly. We managed to evacuate most of our personnel, while we're sure that enough Korean and Chinese collaborators escaped with us. Those that couldn't escape either died or went their own separate ways. In any case, the Japanese Linked Net is exploding with social media posts and websites detailing all our works of art.\n\n**O5-13:** Good, very good for a two-billion-dollar project. (//Slumps on his chair.//) I have seen a little bit of the footage myself... God, those lanterns were a sight! Rizal himself would be proud. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a lot of paperwork, especially with the ramifications of us designating Japan as SCP-7000.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Simoun, we're going to be lit dead by the rest of the Foundation if they find out what we were up to. From a certain point of view, we went rogue. Wouldn't be out of place if the Philippine Branch itself lands a slot on the lists of SCPs, especially with how we used Chinese and Korean anomalies.\n\n**O5-13:** Ezekier, isn't it fun to set records, like being the first Foundation Branch to land itself a slot on the mainlist?\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** First, Japan already broke that record technically, thanks to us. Second, it wouldn't be so funny if our containment class ends up as Neutralized, Simoun. \n\n**O5-13:** Ahh, don't worry about it for now. I have been busy making sure that no word slips away from this country. O5 perks, I guess. (//Chuckles.//) Still, our luck hasn't run out yet.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** I always had the feeling that SCP-7000 was a convenient excuse to mobilize the Philippine Branch. I just hoped it was really anomalous, so at least we have something to defend ourselves in court.\n\n**O5-13:** It sort of is an excuse, especially if we just limit our definition of normalcy to our timeline. In our world, the Japanese Empire is a normal fact of life. We trade with them, butt heads with them over rather trivial political stuff, and collaborate over things like science. Hell, they even thought that our Foundation Branch is trustworthy enough.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Heh, so we had to be... creative with multiversal stuff?\n\n**O5-13:** Hmmn, that's correct. Though we really do have an anomaly on our hands. Thousands of alternate histories we studied say that Japan should have lost the war. China joining the Axis Powers, although possible, shouldn't have happened. Why is it that it only happened in our timeline? We can make a good case for it, I think, especially with how the Japanese threatens the balance of power in the Foundation.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Interesante, though from an objective viewpoint, SCP-7000 wouldn't just be Japan. It would be the whole world, including us. If Japan went Axis, who knows what would happened to us.\n\n **O5-13:** The Philippines turns into a failed state over the next few decades. Not helping is how stupid Filipinos can be when it comes to electing dictators and populists.\n \n**ALTAVISTA:** I guess we're very lucky then, and we have the Japanese Empire to thank for that. We should soon change its designation to Thaumiel. (//Chuckles.//)\n\n **O5-13:** Though Korea and China didn't have it so good in this timeline.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Simoun, in the grand scheme of history, someone loses, someone wins. That's just how things work in reality. Plus, those who care about what it actually means to be Korean and Chinese are desperate enough to be under our wing. You can't find tools like them anywhere. \n\n**O5-13:** Well, we gave the Koreans and Chinese their chance. Speaking of them, Ezekier, have you taken care of the new Korean and Manchurian Foundation Branches? We still have to resolve the problem of redistributing the balance of power, given how the Japanese Branch will likely implode. \n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Hmmn, not yet, really. That's still in the works. So far, I have only taken care of filling the legal and political departments of those Branches, but my collaborators are rather cooperative. We're also getting offers from some of our allies, like the Russians. Looks like they all want a piece of cake, but at least we have a few allies in the Foundation that can legitimize the new branches. \n\n**O5-13:** (//Sips coffee.//) Good, looks like the Foundation is unraveling. Japan is currently investigating the aftermath. It's only a short matter of time before they start pointing fingers, especially at us. It's fairly obvious that someone in the Foundation set up the whole shebang.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** It's time to consolidate our power. Simoun, I plan to contact the Indonesians and the other branches in Southeast Asia soon. Maybe they would help us out, seeing that our government did put out a lot of work solidifying our alliances. Should I do so now?\n\n**O5-13:** Hahh. Wait a little bit for now, since we have to make sure that these guys won't turn against us. I'm especially wary of Thailand, whose king has been sucking up to Japan, and Vietnam, which had a bone to pick with the Chinese way back then. The Indonesians might be good partners, but their ties with Australia and by extension, the western branches are a little suspicious. \n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Don’t worry, Simoun. I won’t say a word about FILIBUSTERISMO. All I would say is that the Japanese Branch might no longer be fit for duty, seeing that it got overwhelmed in the recent attacks. Like, who knows if it can survive another wave of anomalies? It would also help us out in legitimizing the Korean and Manchurian Branches, going by the logic that delegating things to smaller but more focused Foundation groups is the best option.\n\n**O5-13:** As for the other, more neutral Foundation branches... ah, we do have evidence of the Japanese trying to puppeteer neighboring branches, right? Like, putting them in debt traps and aggressive dealings. We can say that they were preparing to strike. \n\n**ALTAVISTA:** I remember filing those documents away. We can just make the issue overblown enough that the Foundation will go into red alert when it comes to the Japanese! (//Claps.//)\n\n**O5-13:** Hahh, I see how we can go about this, Ezekier. Hopefully, this would strike a big enough political blow to Japan and reduce its influence to a low enough point for the grand finale.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Simoun, are we really going forward with the next operation? I thought it was a merely a hypothetical plan, at least for now. Are all of these things really just preparations for it? \n\n**O5-13:** It's still all hypothetical. We still have a long way to go before we can actually implement Operation DOWNFALL. Despite the rest of the empire not faring so well, the Home Islands are very well-guarded, and they have a very firm grip on their citizens. Being told that they're superior beings over and over again will do that to you. Best we could do for now is to isolate them.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** (//Chuckles.//) I see, we're going to implement the Sakoku Decree, Filipino-style. Alright then. By the way, we're still going to devote millions of dollars to Operation FILIBUSTERISMO, right? What I worry about is that the propaganda and militia funding might take a toll on our finances. We also have to train new agents and personnel from our stock of East Asian people. Two billion dollars has already been a lot for a rather small country like us. \n\n**O5-13:** Don't panic over it. That's why we're going to get the other branches discreetly involved here. The resulting arms deals will be very good plus points for us. I also personally know GoIs that we can contact for help. \n\n**ALTAVISTA:** Simoun, we're going to end up causing a worldwide occult war if we continue with this. I'm not entirely opposed to the idea, but we still have to secure, contain, and protect stuff as part of one Foundation.\n\n**O5-13:** One Foundation, eh. Never really understood why the Foundation is so united and monolithic, even if we're composed of wildly disparate cultures, interests, and circumstances. Hmmn, I guess this is why the Foundation really likes Japan. It's very good at enforcing uniformity and a \"normal\" world. But I think that a normal world like that isn't enough if we actually want humanity to progress. So, Ezekier, we have to do all we can, even if means war.\n\n**ALTAVISTA:** (//Taps his coffee cup repetitively.//) Hmmn, progress. Very fun word, especially for us Filipinos. A word so fun it's going to redefine normalcy. Anyway, there's nothing normal in a uniform yet rotting world. It's time to shift the balance of luck and power towards who deserve it and are prepared to have it. Simoun, I will see what I can do. \n\n**O5-13:** That's the spirit, Ezekier. Mabuhay ang Maharlika. I bet that a new, golden, eight-rayed sun will be rising soon. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-7014]]] | SCP-7015 | [[[SCP-7016]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n> **Name of the file:** philogo.png\n> **Author:** Veralta\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** Created for this article.
