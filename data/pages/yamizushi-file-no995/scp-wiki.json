Also this kind of sushi is able to use its twist to propel itself in the air and float. It is not unusual for it to use sushi as projectiles to incapacitate a non-sushiblader, but none is capable, to my knowledge, of staying in the air in a sustained manner as the suisame does.\n\nThe ingredient used is unusual, shark fin does not stand out for having a special flavor, in fact, it is tasteless by itself; and, ethically speaking, the trade of this ingredient represents a risk for shark species due to indiscriminate fishing. For the fin to obtain flavor, it must be prepared with different broths. But what really gives it flavor is the \"desire for revenge\" of the shark from which the ingredient was obtained (see Episode for more information).\n\n[[size 120%]]**Sushiblade Usage**[[/size]]\n\n[[include :fes-ryuukatetu:include-list:radar-chart-6\n|no=1\n|size=250px\n|stage=5\n|color=#282828\n|max=10\n|data1=10\n|data2=2\n|data3=10\n|data4=4\n|data5=2\n|data6=1\n|label1=Attack\n|label2=Defense\n|label3=Speed\n|label4=Stamina\n|label5=Weight\n|label6=Usability\n]]\n\n[[module css]]\n#page-content .circle-1 .label-box .label{\ncolor: black;\ntext-shadow:1px 1px 1px white,-1px 1px 1px white,1px -1px 1px white,-1px -1px 1px white;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\nThe penetrating power of the suisame is so powerful that it is capable of destroying any sushi that does not have an enviable resistance. Trying to escape from it is also not an option because of its great speed, like that of a shark hunting its prey. If that doesn't sound scary enough, its supernatural ability to lacerate is capable of shredding rival sushi with ease.\n\nBut it is not without its problems. To begin with, it is not a particularly accessible ingredient in Japan (in other parts of Asia where its consumption is more common, such as China, it would be more so), so for many sushibladers it would be more accessible and advisable to prepare other types of sushi. Second, the sushiblader and the sushi need to have a more intimate connection with the sushi for proper control. This means that the sushiblader must have a deep appreciation or fondness for sharks, or at least for the shark from which the ingredient was extracted, which adds another problem on an emotional level. Another option is for the shark to possess a great hatred or desire for revenge at the time of death has so that the fin gets a special taste. So getting the right ingredient is very difficult, if not unique.\n\nThe suisame would open up a world of three-dimensional sushi combat with its ability to float. It could allow the creation of new attacks and techniques not only from the four cardinal directions, but also from above and below. Although this would be limited to fights against the same suisame, which would take away some variety to the confrontations, and only few could get them for all the problems already mentioned. But there are those who are willing to go very far to get the strongest sushi, so their spectacle would not be negligible.\n\n[[size 120%]]**Other Uses**[[/size]]\n\nSelf-defense and assassination. The suisame is perfectly capable of seriously wounding a person by its attributes, attacking from 360 degrees and stopping projectiles.\n\n[[size 120%]]**Episode**[[/size]]\n\nWhen I went on vacation to Cancun, by the coincidences of life, I met a Mexican sushiblader. His name was Jose, he was the son of immigrants from Japan to Mexico and we talked a little about what it was like to be a sushiblader in America. He was polite and somewhat modest. He told me how complicated the sushiblade situation was in Mexico; there were very few bladers in the country and people in that part of the world had little interest in learning the art of sushiblade. There was a moment of popularity in the early 2010s, but very few were fit to be real bladers. Then he told me that he had developed a new sushi, one that would change all known paradigms. Driven by my curiosity, I wanted to see it.\n\nJose invited me to his dojo and there he showed me Felipe, the first and only suisame that existed at that time. There, he showed me the capabilities of his sushi in combat. Felipe destroyed the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/koigarezaki-news-20210809 California Roll] I had borrowed from my host in mere seconds. I was very surprised at the great potency of that sushi as I ate the leftovers of my defeat. But the California Roll is very basic in terms of attributes and I did not know how the one he had given me had been prepared. To make sure it wasn't a trick, I gave him a real challenge.\n\nI took out one of my own sushi (one cannot leave home without his sushiblade equipment in hand), a gunkan made with Kalix caviar. One of my best works, and more expensive, whose nori was impenetrable, capable of crushing sushi specialized in powerful and fast attack as the likes of  suisame.\n\nWhen we began to fight, I was confident that my gunkan would withstand the suisame's attack and defeat it by exhausting its spin. My sushi withstood the first onslaught and the second. The third made the nori start to break. I had no time to act before the fourth lunge shattered my gunkan. My jaw dropped. That sushi was on another level.\n\nWe discussed the possibilities of bringing his sushi to Japan and he told me about his main problem: the extremely strong bond needed for proper control. That put me off a bit, but he told me that it was possible to build that bond with the sharks and that he would gladly be willing to teach all the bladers who were willing to go that route to care for and love the sharks. Although I found the proposal somewhat odd, many people are willing to do many things to get the strongest sushi. Although I didn't know how you could become friends with a shark and then kill it to get its fins off.\n\nSuddenly, someone kicked open the door of the dojo. Upon looking in, we saw a muscular man wearing shorts and a T-shirt with a fist print. The stranger entered the dojo with a menacing air. Jose, putting a hand on my shoulder, advised me to stand back, that what was about to happen was something exclusively between him and the stranger. The seriousness of his voice and his expression gave me no more room to obey my host and I limited myself to watch the fight from the side.\n\nJose and the stranger met in the center of the dojo. The stranger was a head taller than my host and his biceps were massive, covered with hundreds of scars, and he brought with him the smell of the sea. An air of danger rolled over both men who were silently analyzing each other. It was the stranger who broke the silence.\n\n> **Stranger:**You are the sympathizer, right?\n>\n> **José:** Yes, you must be one of those brutes from the Center, or am I wrong?\n>\n> **Stranger:** No.\n>\n> **José:** I see. May I have your name?\n>\n> **Stranger:** For what? I'm going to hit you so hard you won't be able to remember it, not to say you'll be dead.\n>\n> **José:** Please. I insist.\n>\n> **Stranger:** Mmm… Ethan.\n>\n> **José:** Well well, Mr. Ethan, my name is Jose Takanaka and today your blood is going to be spilled in this dojo.\n>\n> **Ethan:** Pretty big words for a twig like you.\n\nThe man whose name was Ethan raised his big fists, while Jose revealed his sushi Felipe held by two chopsticks in one hand and a cup of tea in the other. It was going to be a fight of man vs. sushi. With a great cry of \"HEY RASSHAI\", the contest began.\n\nFelipe swiftly went flying at the man who tried to intercept the sushi with a punch. Felipe dodged the attack and with a horizontal swing flayed Ethan's right arm from the knuckles to the shoulder. He screamed in pain as a cascade of blood poured from his long wound. Ethan, with an expression of great fury, attempted to approach Jose, but was stopped when Felipe slashed him across the calves; falling to his knees.\n\n> **José:** What's the matter pugilist, can't you fight a simple sushi?\n>\n> **Ethan:** WHAT?!\n\nEthan's confusion was quite clear - did he not know what sushiblade was?\n\n> **José:** Yes, sushi made with shark fin. Felipe, the Suisame! The sushi that will tear you apart with a vengeance, pugilist!\n\nThe man jumped to his feet trying to get to Jose as quickly as possible, but Felipe quickly appeared to defend his master. Ethan seemed to notice the sushi's attack and tried to catch him with his hands. It seemed absurd, but he was able to catch the sushi in mid-air. But it did him no good. With a storm of blood, Felipe broke through the man's grip and went straight for his neck. In an instinctive reflex, Ethan managed to dodge him, but not without losing the flesh of his left trapezius in the process.\n\nEthan's blood was painting the dojo floor red. I could see with shock and disgust the living flesh on his left hand as Ethan groaned on the floor and stared in stupefaction at his wounds. Meanwhile, Jose laughed arrogantly at his opponent. A laugh that did not sound like the kind and humble man of a few minutes ago.\n\n> **José:** HAHAHAHAHA! What's the matter pugilist, weren't you going to hit me, you IDIOT! I bet your little brain can't understand what's going on, so I'll explain because I'm nice. What's going on is that my sushi is spinning at such a speed that it's comparable to an industrial drill. And you think you can stop an industrial drill with your bare hands? YOU FOOL! A THOUSAND TIMES A FOOL! HAHAHAHA!\n\nEthan then raised his fist and with great force struck the ground, shattering it. He picked up a piece of debris and threw it at Jose. Felipe smashed the rock in mid-air with no trouble; Jose didn't even flinch. The pugilist, as José called him, threw rocks at him in the hope of hitting the blader from a distance, but all the rocks were stopped by Felipe's flying attacks, only a few harmless pebbles hit José.\n\n> **José:** You look pathetic. A fitting end for someone like you, you caveman who only thinks with his fists. You and yours are despicable and pathetic beings. You beat innocent sharks who only want to swim the great waters of the sea in peace. You are wretches. You beat Felipe to death in your malice. He was an innocent shark who never hurt anyone. But now I, Felipe and all the sharks you murdered in cold blood will get their revenge. With sushi made from your flesh and flavored with our hatred I will destroy your filthy punching center to the ground and rid the world of filth!\n>\n> **Ethan:** SHUT UP ALREADY!\n\nThe pugilist shouted with a very irritated tone, interrupting José's revenge speech.\n\n> **Ethan:** What bullshit are you talking about? Who asked you? I didn't and that other guy over there didn't either. Wanna know why? Because NOBODY cares about the reasons of a nerdy shark sympathizer like you. When I catch up with you, I'm going to punch you in the face and fix you just like we did with your shark bitch.\n\nJose's face turned red with rage.\n\n> **José:** DIIIIIEEEEE! SPECIAL ATTACK: //A THOUSAND SLASHES OF A THOUSAND TEETH!//\n\nFelipe then began to attack the man from all directions, slashing and tearing at his flesh with great vengeance. Ethan could barely cover himself from the brutal barrage of slashes. It seemed that the fight was over and that the sushi would once again rise victorious over the man, but the pugilist did not give up. Ethan stood beneath the storm of teeth, covered in blood and his clothes in tatters, defiant in the face of Jose. The sushiblader could not tolerate such insolence.\n\n> **José:** KILL HIM FELIPE! GET HIS THROAT!\n\nFelipe shot out like a shark about to devour an unsuspecting fish. Ethan didn't move from his spot, opening his arms to receive the attack. Once again, despite his speed, Ethan managed to catch the sushi in mid-air. Jose laughed. Trying to stop Felipe's attack had become clear that it was impossible.\n\nBut the impossible happened.\n\nSeconds passed and the pugilist's carotid artery had not been violently opened. Then Ethan opened his left hand and blood, skin and the remains of sushi fell from it. Our eyes widened like saucers. We didn't understand what had happened. How had this man managed to overcome the power of the suisame?\n\n> **Ethan:** Throwing rubble did some good.\n\nAfter that comment, we realized the truth. Ethan had not thrown the rocks to try to hurt Jose, but to slow Felipe's turning speed so he could stop him with his hands! He had provoked Jose into making a direct attack that he knew he could stop!\n\nJose fell backward in disbelief that Felipe had been defeated.\n\n> **José:** Impossible! Impossible! Impossible that someone like you would have defeated Felipe! Felipe is invincible! Impossible! Impossible!\n\nJose had gone mad in the face of defeat, unable to accept it. Watching a sushiblader fall into that state is quite sad, especially if they were once your friends. Once you fall like that, getting up is almost impossible. It looked like the end for Jose. But the miracles didn't end that day.\n\nA golden cloud began to form in front of Jose. None of us understood what was happening. The golden cloud began to increase in size until it took the shape of a small shark.\n\n> **José:** Fe-Felipe?\n>\n> **Felipe:** My friend, do not give up.\n\nSaid the cloud without our being able to believe what we were witnessing.\n\n> **Felipe:** Maybe you lost today, your sushi couldn't overcome the challenge, but don't give up! Losing a battle is not losing the war. You still have a way to go as a sushiblader. Whether as an avenger or a hero, I want you to rise up and go all the way to the top. I want my friend to become the best sushiblader he can be.\n\nJose stood up, tall and proud in front of Felipes spirit, being illuminated by an almost celestial light. Jose's motivation to go forward had returned and he felt that he was facing the beginning of a legend in the world of sushiblade. But that didn't last.\n\nEthan, with a powerful movement, unraveled the golden cloud, making Felipe disappear. From one moment to the next, the light of the place was extinguished, creating a shadow that covered the man bathed in his own blood.\n\n> **Ethan:** What a load of bullshit.\n\nThe contempt in that man's voice made my skin crawl.\n\n> **Ethan:** \"Stay ahead and be the best\"? \"Rise up and get to the top\"? What a stupid thing to say. Sympathizers like you can only aspire to be pugilized. Because, neither you nor the sharks can dream of surpassing the excellence of the human species. And the strength of the Shark Punching Center's fists!\n\nWith great hatred, Ethan threw a punch against Jose's face. The sound he generated with the blow was so grotesque that I can't describe it. Jose was sent flying against the other end of the dojo, impacting violently against the wall, leaving a bloodstain on it and falling to the ground inert.\n\nEthan, looking as big as an Oni after coming off a massacre, sighed with great fatigue. Then he turned to look at me and asked me a question:\n\n> **Ethan:** You... Are you a selachian sympathizer?\n\nI was scared and had no sushi to be able to defend myself at hand. I said \"no\" quickly with great fervor.\n\n> **Ethan:** Mmm… You're safe for today.\n\nThat was all he said to me before leaving the dojo with a limp step, trailing pools of blood behind him.\n\nI called an ambulance. The paramedics told me they could do nothing for Jose, his skull had been destroyed. The only consolation they could give me was that he would not have suffered, having died instantly.\n\nWhen I returned to Japan the first thing I did was to try to replicate the suisame. What I got were cheap copies with mediocre power and that couldn't even mimic the horizontal spin of a real suisame.\n\nIt fills me with sadness to think of this sushi being lost as there will not be another Jose who can make a connection like he did with Felipe. This is a dark world indeed.\n\n[[size 120%]]**Related Documents**[[/size]]\n\n[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/scp-es-272 Anomalous sushi and the possibilities of the paranormal.]\nWritten document.
