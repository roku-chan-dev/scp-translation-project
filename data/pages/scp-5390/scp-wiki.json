Foundation agents disguised as police officers are to monitor the location and amnesticize any affected civilians.\n\nInstances manifested by SCP-5390 are to be stored in a cryogenic storage locker at Site-30.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5390 is the designation for a phenomenon occurring in the Roma district in Mexico City, Mexico. Whenever a person starts to consume a tamale between 17:00 and 18:00 o'clock, while present at the aforementioned location, a human finger will instantly manifest itself within the tamale dough.\n\nAt the time of writing, 35 instances materialized by SCP-5390 have been recovered, designated SCP-5390-01 to -35. Neither the tamales nor the fingers have shown a recognizable pattern. Below are some notable instances.\n\n||~ Instance # ||~ Recovery Date ||~ Notes ||\n|| SCP-5390-01 || 15/11/1979 || First instance recovered, found in the food stand of Mrs. Adelina López Luna. Right thumb; the fingerprint identified the instance as belonging to Mr. Miguel Antonio Herrera Moreno, former husband of Mrs. López. Subject had died in 1975, from 2 shots in the chest cavity received during a dispute in a bar. Exhumation of the body showed that 3 fingers were missing; however, both thumbs were still present. ||\n|| SCP-5390-09 || 03/01/1992 || Right index finger of a man between 25 and 30 years old. Fingerprint has not yet been identified. It is to be noted that the instance shows signs of having been bitten in different parts, in a manner not consistent with the way it was recovered. ||\n|| SCP-5390-12 || 07/09/1994 || Left little finger; the fingerprint identified the instance as belonging to Mrs. Patricia Abel Santos, a Mexican journalist who died in 1991, at the age of 44, from colon cancer. Exhumation of the body showed that all fingers were still present. It is to be noted that Ms. Abel was the one who reported SCP-5390-01's discovery before the Foundation was able to establish a cover story. ||\n|| SCP-5390-13 || 11/10/1995 || Right middle finger; fingerprint identified the instance as belonging to Dr. Venceslao, who was assigned to Site-30 at the time, and expressed ignorance about this event. This is the first and only time that SCP-5390 has manifested an instance directly related to the Foundation. ||\n|| SCP-5390-19 || 24/12/1999 || Left little finger of a male infant between 4 and 9 months of age. Fingerprint has not yet been identified. This is the first time that SCP-5390 has manifested an instance belonging to a minor. ||\n|| SCP-5390-26 to -31 || 27/09/2007 to 15/06/2015 || Left thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger of Ms. Carla Salvador Uribe, a 15-year-old Mexican student who disappeared on 10/09/1975 in the vicinity of the Historic Center of Mexico City. This is the first and only time that SCP-5390 has manifested more than one instance belonging to the same person. ||\n|| SCP-5390-35 || 03/10/2020 || Right index finger of a person of indeterminate identity and gender. It should be noted that the right incisor of an unknown woman between 45 and 50 years old was attached to the instance. ||\n\n**Addendum:** On 10/01/2021, SCP-5390-26 to -31 began to spasm inside their containment cell. After they were removed and placed on a table for examination, all the instances began to gather and roughly spell out the words \"HELLO\", \"CARLA\", and \"[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/about-deer DEER]\" in Mexican Sign Language, before returning to their inert state. Research into the possible significance of this is ongoing.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5389]]] | SCP-5390 | [[[SCP-5391]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=EthanHanson]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** A_mi_me_gustan_los_de_chile_verde.jpg\n> **Name:** chicken tamale from mom’s tamales\n> **Author:** jimw\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/7aca1c4f-4b82-44cf-8a93-5f06ce048340\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
