been left inside an unmarked envelope in her mailbox the day before. She was wearing blue jeans and a grey fleece, and kept the hood up to hide her face. This wasn't quite the bad parts of EURTEC, but it was closer to the Lower City than she was comfortable with, receiving almost no light from the artificial suns far above. \n\nShe checked the note again, then followed its directions to a small cafe, squeezed between a drug dispensary and a used robotics store. Circe opened the door and looked inside.\n\nAlthough it wasn't part of a chain, it had the same generic appearance of any café anywhere. The only thing that was distinctively EURTEC was that the barista was clearly synthetic, with the slightly sagging features and thinning brown hair of a homunculus approaching the end of its working life. She was probably only here because the owner had bought her second-hand.\n\nThe way synthetics were treated had bothered Chris a lot more when she'd first arrived in EURTEC. She still thought the buying and selling sapient beings was wrong, even if they were grown in vats or made in factories, but by now she'd gotten used to it. If she stayed here another decade, she'd probably stop caring entirely, and buy a cute robot maid to keep her company.\n\nShe had to get out of EURTEC before she got that desperate.\n\nChris walked into the cafe and looked around. It seemed eerily empty, but then it was early on a Sunday morning.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the barista behind the counter. \"Are you Circe?\"\n\nChris cringed at her internet username. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"He's in the back.\" The homunculus gestured towards a door at the back of the cafe.\n\nChris went through to find herself in a small meeting room, more formal than the rest of the cafe. The man she'd come to meet was waiting for her, sitting at a square table with a black coffee. He gestured at the seat opposite him as she closed the door behind her.\n\nThe most obvious thing about him was that he was pale. Most of the residents of EURTEC were white Europeans who didn't get any natural sunlight, so this wasn't too unusual. However, this man's skin wasn't just beige, it really was white, just like his hair.\n\n\"Are you Circe?\" he asked, also using her online handle. \"Or would you prefer Chris?\"\n\n\"Er... Chris is fine.\"\n\nIt suited her. She passed well enough that everyone usually assumed her full name was Christina, even though she'd never officially gotten around to changing it from Christopher.\n\n\"Chris, you can call me White Crow.\" He smiled warmly, and Chris wondered if she should have also kept using her fake name. \"I represent the Serpent's Hand.\" \n\nA thin forked tongue flickered out from a tattoo on his pale throat, before the inked black snake retreated back under the collar of his white shirt. Chris wasn't sure why a member of a secret organisation would wear such easily recognisable anart on his body.\n\n\"How did Max get in contact with the Serpent's Hand?\" \n\nWhite Crow smiled. \"She was asking around about you inside the Wanderer's Library.\"\n\n\"And how did you find me?\"\n\n\"I have connections here in Eurtec, and you told Max plenty about yourself. We just had to cross-reference records until we identified your address.\"\n\nChris occasionally forgot she was living in a surveillance state. \"I just want to go to the Library. Can you help?\"\n\nAs she said the words, she glanced towards the door, half expecting a dozen secret police to break it down and reveal this as an elaborate sting operation. But nothing happened.\n\nWhite Crow leaned toward her. \"How long do you plan on visiting for?\"\n\nChris leaned back in her chair. \"I don't plan on ever coming back.\" \n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Anywhere has to be better than here.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Just checking. But I'm afraid I can't just show you the Way to the Library.\"\n\nChris wasn't even surprised. \"I can pay.\"\n\nWhite Crow shook his head. \"I don't want money. The problem is who you work for.\"\n\nChris was confused. \"I do tech support?\"\n\n\"You live here, you work for the Bookburners. And Coalition members are barred from the Wanderer's Library.\"\n \nChris gave this some thought. She was employed by the Aetheric Engineers, which were a member of the Council of 108. She was technically supporting the Global Occult Coalition every time she went into work.\n\nChris sighed. \"So you won't help me?\" Part of her had known this would be pointless.\n\nThe man across the table smiled. \"The question is, can you help me?\"\n\n\"You know I work in an office, right? I can't exactly...\"\n\nHe cut her off. \"Do you have access to the Ptolomy system?\"\n\n\"Coalition logistics?\" she asked, and he nodded. \"I don't personally have access, but my colleagues do.\"\n\nWhite Crow smiled, then pulled a piece of paper out of his trouser pocket. After unfolding it carefully, he handed it to her. \"Would you be able to requisition these?\"\n\nChris scanned the list. It took a moment to process what she was reading. Guns. Bombs. [[[goc-supplemental-equipment| Material for Black Suits]]]. \"What do you want all this for?\"\n\n\"I intend to change the world.\" He seemed entirely serious.\n\n\"You do know they won't just... mail this to you?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"There's an address below the list, it should be on the system as an official Coalition depot. Nobody will notice this has gone missing until we're long gone.\"\n\n\"I can't just send an email! I'd need to access a collegue's computer, submit a request, attach a project code...\" Chris stopped, realizing she was actually considering this.\n\n\"Do you know how to do that?\" asked White Crow.\n\nChris was not officially responsible for it, but she'd had to talk a lot of her older colleagues through the process. It wasn't that hard...\n\nWhite Crow's leaned forward again, getting uncomfortably close for a moment. \"Perhaps the real question is - do you want to do that?\"\n\nChis was silent for a long time, before saying, \"I'm not a revolutionary.\"\n\nWhite Crow shrugged. \"Don't you Maxwellists want to rebuild god?\"\n\n\"That's very different!\" she insisted. \n\n\"Do you think the Coalition will permit it?\"\n\n\"No,\" she admitted. \n\n\"Then you understand the Serpent's Hand, even if you're not one of us. The Bookburners have made war our only option, and I intend to win. I'll need weapons, and I'll need people willing to use them. You can help me.\"\n\nChris didn't care if he burned EURTEC to the ground. \"I just want to leave.\" \n\n\"I can show you a Way into the Library. But betraying the Coalition is the only way you'll be allowed through it.\"\n\nChris sighed. \"I could find an excuse to access the computer of someone senior at work. Requisition these supplies via the system, dispatch it to that address. It shouldn't take long to arrive.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" White Crow's smile widened further, showing all his teeth. \"I'll arrange a dead-drop for you to tell us the details.\"\n\nChris wasn't smiling. \"But you have to take me with you.\"\n\n----\n\n**Maxamin:** DO NOT MEET WITH THAT MAN\n**Maxamin:** IM SO SORRY CIRCE\n**Maxamin:** I SHOULDNT HAVE TOLD HIM ANYTHING\n**CrC:** Bit late for that now Max\n**Maxamin:** u met him already?\n**CrC:** yes\n**Maxamin:** why didnt u listen to me?\n**CrC:** I was out\n**CrC:** Can't access Dark Web on my mobile\n**Maxamin:** sorry i didnt realise\n**CrC:** I'd never get any work done if I could talk to you anytime\n**Maxamin:** oh thanks :)\n**Maxamin:** i guess i overreacted\n**Maxamin:** obviously ur not going to do what he asked\n**Maxamin:** right?\n**Maxamin:** Circe?\n**CrC:** How do you know what he asked me to do?\n**Maxamin:** i dont know\n**Maxamin:** but thats what ive heard about him\n**Maxamin:** he uses people\n**CrC:** He says I'm a bookburner\n**Maxamin:** ur not\n**CrC:** if I don't help him I'll never be allowed in the Library\n**Maxamin:** thats only official members\n**CrC:** I work for them every day\n**Maxamin:** i dont think that counts\n**Maxamin:** i can check what the rules are\n**Maxamin:** dont do anything rash because of him\n**CrC:** I'm not ssure I can even do what he wants\n**CrC:** He wants me to con the goc\n**Maxamin:** sorry i oversold u\n**CrC:** Maybe its best i stay here\n**Maxamin:** i wanted people to be interested in helping u\n**Maxamin:** i made out u were some computer genius\n**CrC:** I am a computer genius\n**Maxamin:** but it must have been scary meeting someone like him\n**Maxamin:** oh sorry i guess u are\n**Maxamin:** i think he was expecting a super hacker though\n**CrC:** Max ill tlak to you latr\n**CrC:** need to check somethinh\n\n----\n\nAs an ICSUT dropout, Chris hadn't had any better options than the job offer from the Aetheric Engineers. Moving to Eurtec had been an excuse to break off contact with her family, and the salary and healthcare benefits were generous. She lacked the natural talent required for [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/aetherische-information aetheric informatics], but she'd assumed the company would find some way to make use of her experience with computer programming.\n\nThree years later, she was still working in internal Tech Support, and it turned out that moving to EURTEC was a one-way trip. Her lack of anything beyond a high school diploma was severely limiting her options for promotion or transfer within the city. \n\nThe only perk of the job was that she knew all about the kind of scam her collegues fell for, since she was the one who had to restore their access every time their corporate accounts got compromised.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**To:** sophie.reinhardt@aetheng.eu\n**From:** werner-hertz10@eurmail.eu\n**Subject** URGENT FILES YOU REQUESTED\n\n[# payroll_data.xlsm]\n\nHi Sophie,\n\nI was told you needed this file ASAP?\n\nI've attached it to this message, I hope this isn't too late!\n\nApologies for sending this from my personal email, I've been locked out of my work email again, no idea why!\n\nSent from my Android\n[[/div]]\n\nAs a teenager, Chris had discovered it was possible to code complex programs within the macro language of Office software, and that included computer viruses, which she'd then gleefully shared with her teachers at high school. After an evening spent testing an updated version, she was confident that the corruption of files was still very noticable. \n\nChris planed to send the email from an account she'd created by proxy, impersonating a man she knew Reinhardt worked with simply by lying to Eurmail. It turns out they didn't actually verify any of the details they asked for during sign-up.\n\nChris sheduled to the email to send at 10:33, then headed into work. She didn't have to wait long for Reinhardt to contact Tech Support.\n\nAs Chris had expected, none of her coworkers were enthusiastic about responding to Reinhardt, and were more than happy to let her handle this.\n\n----\n\n\"I'm glad you didn't keep me waiting too long!\" said Reinhardt sharply, as soon as Chris walked into her office. \"Now... Miss?\"\n\n\"Call me Chris.\" She hoped her nervousness seemed normal for anyone interacting with Reinhardt.\n\n\"Files keep crashing on my computer. It says I have some sort of virus? I have no idea how I could have got it, I've always been careful online!\"\n\nChris grimaced. \"It can happen to anyone. Let me take a look.\"\n\nShe could have removed the virus with a few lines of code in the command line interface, and reversed its effects with a couple more, but that wouldn't have taken long enough. Instead, after she'd plugged in a USB stick, she opened up a program, and a large window marked \"Scanning Computer\" appeared in the middle of the screen.\n\n\"How long will this take?\" asked Reinhardt.\n\n\"Er... It says fifteen minutes.\"\n\nReinhardt waited impatiently as a blue bar slowly incremented, one square at a time. The estimated time to completion noticeably increased, rather than decreasing.\n\nChris turned to her, trying to seem sympathetic. \"If you want to, you can come back later. It should be done in... 18 minutes? I'll need to check it's worked, that might take a little longer...\"\n\n\"Can't you make it go any faster?\"\n\n\"No,\" Chris lied. \"This is going to take as long as it says it will. Er... 20 minutes?\"\n\nReinhardt seemed to be increasingly impatient.\n\nChris, very casually, said, \"I'm sorry, do you want to go get a coffee? I'll wait here.\"\n\n\"Do you want a coffee?\" asked Reinhardt.\n\n\"No,\" said Chris quickly. \"I've had one recently.\" She stared at the progress bar, as if willing it to move faster. She knew it wouldn't.\n\nReinhardt sighed, and walked out of her own office.\n\nAs soon as she was gone, Chris opened up her browser and navigated to the PTOLOMY requisitions website. The username and password autofilled, as Chris had expected. No normal human could be expected to remember at least 14 characters, including a number, symbol and uppercase letter.\n\nChris quickly input the items from the list she'd been given by White Crow, copying it over from a text file on the USB drive. Nothing on the list would seem suspicious, since the Aetheric Engineers ordered plenty of military hardware for enhancement and testing. She was relieved to discover that the requested delivery location really was on the GOC system, and she quickly submitted the request to PTOLOMY.\n\nShe had just enough time to delete the confirmation email from Renhardt's mailbox, then delete it from deleted items as well, before Reinhardt came back in.\n\nChris had already closed all other windows, so she gestured to the taskbar, now close to completion. \"It's nearly done!\"\n\n\"Did you find anything?\"\n\nChris shrugged, and waited as the program finished. \"Seems like I did!\" She opened up the command line interface and told the virus to reverse its effects, then uninstall and delete itself. It worked, exactly as she'd programmed it to do.\n\nReinhardt looked more annoyed than anything else. \"That's it fixed now? Good. I need to get back to work.\"\n\nChris quickly left. She had merely solved a problem she'd created, but Reinhardt's reaction made it very easy to not feel guilty about it.\n\n----\n\n**CrC:** So turns out I am a super hacker\n**CrC:** It was basically just scamming my boss\n**CrC:** but most hacking is social engineering anyway\n**Maxamin:** Circe\n**Maxamin:** What did u do?\n**CrC:** Requisitioned some assets\n**Maxamin:** that doesnt sound too bad\n**Maxamin:** wait what did u actually do\n**CrC:** That \"white crow\" guy will collect them tommorrow\n**CrC:** then I'm out of here\n**Maxamin:** did u just\n**Maxamin:** sell arms to terrorists?\n**CrC:** Of course not\n**CrC:** no money changed hands\n**Maxamin:** i dont think the goc will care u did it for free!\n**Maxamin:** come on Circe\n**Maxamin:** its not too late to back out\n**CrC:** It kind of is Max\n**CrC:** They'll work out what I did eventuallt\n**Maxamin:** Circe\n**CrC:** If he takes me to the Library I'll be safe\n**CrC:** I'll be able to see you\n**Maxamin:** i want to see u too\n**Maxamin:** but not like this\n**CrC:** Then how Max?\n**Maxamin:** i dont know\n**Maxamin:** i should have come to find u myself\n**CrC:** Dont say that Max\n**CrC:** I dont want your in danger for me\n**Maxamin:** i don't want u in danger either\n**CrC:** Then I have to leave Eurtec\n**Maxamin:** ok\n**Maxamin:** i guess its too late to do anything bt pray?\n**Maxamin:** WAN help u\n**CrC:** Thanks\n**CrC:** May the WAN be with us, always\n**Maxamin:** lol\n**Maxamin:** amen to that\n**CrC:** I love you Max\n**CrC:** Max?\n**CrC:** I mean\n**CrC:** your my best friend\n**Maxamin:** love u too Circe\n**Maxamin** ur the little sister i never had\n**CrC:** I do actually have a big sister\n**CrC:** But we dont talk\n**Maxamin:** dont worry Circe\n**Maxamin:** big sis max will look after u\n**Maxamin:** ill be waiting for u in the library\n**CrC:** looking forward to meeting you irl\n**CrC:** love you \"big sis\"\n**Maxamin:** love you too lil sis\n**Maxamin:** and im sorry\n**Maxamin:** i never should have gotten u into this\n\n----\n\nThe next day, Chris walked out at lunch. Usually, she drank a meal replacement shake at her desk while browsing the internet on her phone, but it wasn't like she couldn't go out for her break if she wanted. So today, she did.\n\nChris was carrying a small rucksack containing her laptop, tablet and phone, all definitely powered down, plus a few toiletries and a couple of changes of clothes. It had taken surprisingly little time to pack everything she wanted to take with her from her one-room apartment. She would have said she was going to be visiting a friend's house that evening to stay over, but neither of her coworkers had asked her about it.\n\nChris waited anxiously on a street corner. If White Crow and his allies didn't show up to collect her, she wasn't sure what she'd do.\n\nHer worrying ended when an unmarked black van pulled up next to her, and she recognized White Crow in the passenger's seat. He shifted over to the middle to let her climb in, and she noticed that next to him was the same homunculus that had been working in the cafe. Although she was seated in the driver's seat, she wasn't touching the wheel. As soon as Chris climbed in and closed the door, the vehicle began moving again, the electric motor making minimal noise.\n\nA calm, synthesized voice came from the dashboard, which displayed a map of Eurtec, overlaid with their route and an estimated time of arrival. \"Welcome. Resuming route.\"\n\n\"You looked nervous,\" commented Crow, as Chris placed her bag in the footwell. \"Did you think we weren't coming?\"\n\nChris wasn't sure whether to reply honestly.\n\n\"Relax,\" said White Crow. \"The Serpent's Hand looks out for its own.\"\n\n\"Err...\" said Chris. \"I wouldn't say I'm one of you...\"\n\nWhite Crow grinned. \"That's not what I meant.\" He gestured to the homunculus, then to the screen in the van's dashboard. \"This is Franchesca and Otto. They're Children of the Noise, but they're still my people.\"\n\n\"You're working with them?\" All Chris knew was that they were a group of dangerously defective synthetic intelligences.\n\nWhite Crow smiled. \"The freedom of intelligent beings is more important than human comfort.\"\n\nFranchesca frowned at him. \"You shouldn't say too much to her.\"\n\nWhite Crow shrugged. \"If Chris isn't trustworthy, we have bigger problems than her knowing about why I'm helping you.\" He was no longer smiling.\n\n\"I swear, I'd never sell you out!\" said Chris, then worried that her reply came suspiciously quickly. \"I'm Maxwellian, remember? I'd end up...\" Chris wasn't sure what would happen to her if anyone found out about her online communications, but supplying arms to terrorist groups was definitely illegal.\n\nOtto's calm, synthesized voice came from the dashboard. \"I've received a request for us to pull over.\"\n\nFrancesca suddenly looked nervous. \"That has to be the cops.\" She was glaring at Chris.\n\nOtto replied \"I have elected to ignore it,\" and continued driving. That wasn't usually possible for a navigational AI. The cops' suspicions would be confirmed.\n\nChris was terrified. \"I swear, I had nothing to do with this.\" She flinched as White Crow turned to face her, a cold look in his pale blue eyes. \"Please don't hurt me.\"\n\nWhite Crow placed a hand on her back, and Chris flinched, but it seemed he was only trying to calm her down. The unexpected physical contact did not help. \"I doubt this was intentional. They were probably tracking you already, and noticed you'd unexpectedly gotten into this vehicle.\"\n\n\"My phone's off!\" insisted Chris. \"The battery's out and everything!\"\n\nWhite Crow shrugged, moving his hand away from her. \"Then it's probably your OROI chip. They can't track everyone all the time, but if they were suspicious of you already, and you made an unexpected deviation from your usual routine...\"\n\n\"I should have gone out for lunch more often,\" said Chris, weakly. She'd had the subdermal chip implanted in her head so long ago that she'd entirely forgotten about it.\n\nThe vehicle stopped at an intersection. The red lights were retained only for the benefit of human passengers, as AI-controlled traffic sped passed in front of them. Like the other cars around them, Otto was patiently waiting for the wireless signal permitting them to move again.\n\nChris expected to be thrown out of the vehicle, but realized it was already too late for that. Now they'd identified the vehicle, the police could track it anywhere in the city. There were sirens behind them, and cars were pulling over to enable a small unmanned police drone to pass through as it approached behind them. The traffic lights were not turning green.\n\n\"Recalculating Route,\" said the calm voice from the dashboard.\n\nFranchesca tensed, and quickly said, \"Brace yourself!\"\n\nChris saw the route on the dashboard screen suddenly become much more convoluted, yet the estimated time to arrival decreased. She frantically checked that her seatbelt was definitely clicked in, just as sudden acceleration slammed her back against her seat.\n\nThe vehicle's electric motor only emitted a slight hum, but the shriek of spinning tires was deafening. The van lurched through the red light, then sharply turned right to squeeze into a gap in the traffic in front of them. The vehicle they pulled out in front of automatically slowed to avoid a collision, but only just avoided slamming into the rear end of the van.\n\nAcceleration continued as the van began weaving through traffic to overtake vehicles in front of them. Otto disregarded both the speed limit and the usual rules of the road, at one point passing through the narrow gap between two cars by driving on the center line between lanes. The police sirens behind them began to get increasingly distant. It seemed they had not been authorized to drive as recklessly as Otto.\n\nThe lights at the intersection ahead were red. Enough cars had already stopped that it would be impossible for the van to force its way through. The voice from the dashboard calmly repeated \"Recalculating Route.\"\n\nRather than halting, Otto drove the van onto the pavement to the right, squeezing into the narrow space between walls and lamposts, before turning again to drive down an alleyway between two tower blocks. After speeding past confused smokers of e-cigarettes, they reemerged on the other side of the city block, rejoining the road on the left-hand side.\n\nIn EURTEC all cars drove on the right, but Otto managed to avoid the oncoming traffic. Frequently by millimetres.\n\nChris gripped her seatbelt in terror, expecting a head-on collision at any moment. Glancing to the right, she saw White Crow grinning like a maniac.\n\nAt the next intersection, the van resumed driving on the right side of the road, but the occasional scraping of metal on metal as they overtook slower vehicles made it impossible for Chris to unclench herself. They'd lost the vehicles that had been following them, but aerial drones and traffic cameras would make it easy for the authorities to track them.\n\nChris had no idea where they could be going. It was impossible to just drive out of EURTEC! The only thing outside the city was empty void, and every gateway back to Earth was heavily guarded!\n\nAs they approached another red light, Chris knew Otto wouldn't be stopping. The flashing blue lights of a police car were approaching in front of them, and hearing the words \"Recalculating Route\" again provided no comfort.\n\nRather than trying to avoid it, Otto swerved to the left so that the van clipped the back corner of the oncoming police car, sending it spinning across the intersection, brakes shrieking. Chris breifly wondered where that maneuver came from in Otto's training data.\n\nThe van then drove off the road again, this time cutting through a park. In a breathtaking display of either skill or luck, Otto managed to avoid the fountain, concrete sculpture, and taco truck, without hitting any of the  joggers or dogwalkers crowded into the small green square. The van then cut across a lawn to re-emerge on the other side.\n\nThey drove a little further along the road, but from the noise of sirens all around them, it was clear they hadn't lost their pursuers. The van took a sharp U-turn onto an ramp leading down to the Lower City, and to Chris's relief nobody was driving up in the opposite direction.\n\nThe ramp led down to a road, running parallel to EURTEC's Endloserfluss. The artificial river had recently been cleaned of industrial effluent, allowing a carpet of vibrant green algae to thrive on its surface. The other side of the road was lined with run-down housing projects and derelict factories, long overdue for urban renewal. Police sirens were audible from all directions as they closed in on the van.\n\nThey suddenly took a sharp left turn into a dark tunnel.\n\nChris had heard of the Catacombs, EURTEC's original transport system, but had never been there before. The van drove slightly slower through the dark underground tunnels, but continued to take sharp and erratic turns. Chris soon had no idea where they were.\n\nTo her surprise, White Crow and Francesca seemed to be relaxed, although it was hard to tell since their faces were only lit by the reflected light of the van's headlights.\n\nWhite Crow noticed her stare, and said in a reassuring voice, \"Don't worry. Wireless transmissions don't work down here! They can't track us anymore.\"\n\nChris had read about that - too much electrical interference from the newer induction roads above. It was one of the many reasons it was forbidden to enter the Catacombs, but she supposed that did make them useful for evading the law.\n\nAfter spending far too long driving through almost total darkness, the van abruptly stopped. \"You have arrived. We hope you had a pleasant journey.\"\n\nChris assumed Otto was using the pre-programmed phrases sarcastically, but it was possible the AI was simply insane. Otto had managed to lose their pursuers while avoiding any serious collisions, so Chris assumed there was at least a method to its madness.\n\nShe still flung herself out of the vehicle as fast as she could. Chris wasn't quite desperate enough to kiss the concrete, but she did lie on it for some time, appreciating the stillness.\n\n\"You forgot your bag,\" said White Crow, dropping it on the ground next to her. He then moved towards the back of the van, grabbing a trolley that had been left against the wall along the way. The vehicle's back doors had already opened, and he removed two cardboard boxes to place them on the pushcart.\n\nFrancesca looked down at Chris from inside of the van. \"I hope you never come back to Eurtec. For your own sake.\" She smiled, although her slightly warped facial features made the expression seem both unsettling and insincere. The van's doors slammed shut automatically, and then the vehicle drove off into the darkness.\n\nChris got to her feet, picked up her bag, and turned to face White Crow. He had a torch, providing the only light in the pitch-black tunnels. Chris quickly rushed over to join him, following the squeaking of the trolley's wheel.\n\nIt led through into an empty underground loading bay.\n\n\"Where are we?\" Chris asked.\n\n\"An old Prometheus laboratory.\"\n\n\"Are the others not coming with us?\" She'd been surprised when the van drove off.\n\n\"No, we're going to the Library. They're staying here in Eurtec.\"\n\n\"Won't they be recognized? They must have caught us on camera...\"\n\nWhite Crow shook his head. \"Otto's just the computer, they'll swap him into a new vehicle. Francesca will change her face again too. She's older than she looks - they don't make homunculi like they used to.\"\n\nChris had heard about this before. Her wealthier colleagues frequently complained about the \"planned obsolescence\" of their personal servants.\n\nThe man from the Serpent's Hand handed her a torch of her own, then led her towards a set of double doors, ignoring peeling police tape and bright yellow signs warning any would-be intruders about a \"Parallax-class spatial hazard\".\n\nChris paused at the threshold. \"Is this place... safe?\"\n\nWhite Crow shrugged. \"It's an empty building.\"\n\n\"Prometheus Labs went bust a decade ago! Why hasn't it been redeveloped?\"\n\nWhite Crow took a while to reply. \"From what I've read, they tried to fit employee housing and research laboratories into the same space. They violated a few non-Euclidian zoning laws.\"\n\n\"This place isn't built to code?\"\n\nWhite Crow shrugged. \"They may have literally cut corners, but it's sturdy enough. Just don't knock through any walls.\" He pulled something out of his pocket and placed it on top of the trolley, then dragged it through the doorway behind him.\n\nLit by the beams of their torches, the abandoned research facility looked exactly as Chris expected. The corridors were industrial, with bare concrete walls and many exposed pipes and wires, but most of the rooms on either side looked like they had once been used for scientific experiments or data storage. Everything of value had been stripped out long ago, leaving only the objects too bulky or too worthless to be worth removing.\n\nWhite Crow wheeled the trolley in front of him, making sharp turns at every junction. He had a map resting on top of the two cardboard boxes stacked on the trolley, with a route marked on it. Although it began as a red line, it changed to yellow, then green, and finally blue. The gradient of color was necessary to follow the route, because it crossed over itself multiple times, reminding Chris of some sort of Celtic knot.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" asked Chris.\n\n\"To the Wanderer's Library.\"\n\n\"And... how?\"\n\n\"Prometheus turned this place into a labyrinth, and there is always a Way out of a labyrinth.\"\n\n\"This... somehow connects to the Library?\"\n\n\"Yes. A Wayfinder identified the route for me. It's how I got into EURTEC.\"\n\nChris was relieved. She had no desire to spend the night with a strange man in an abandoned and condemned underground lair.\n\nShe followed behind him as he continued to trace a path through the Prometheus facility. The rooms they were now passing seemed to be some sort of dormatory, beds and kitchens abandoned long ago. It seemed much more spacious than the apartment Chris had been living in.\n\nWhite Crow broke the silence first. \"When you get to the Library, what do you intend to do?\"\n\nChris shrugged. \"Read books, I guess.\"\n\nHe looked at her with interest. \"Are you an avid reader?\"\n\nChris paused. \"I guess I'm actually more interested in meeting other Maxwellians in person, rather than online.\"\n\nWhite Crow grinned. \"The main thing I've noticed about the Maxwellist Network is that they are always online.\"\n\n\"I suppose we are.\"\n\n\"No, I mean they have chips in their brains to talk directly to each other. Although I think Max used a real keyboard with you. She said she was too fast otherwise, it didn't seem fair?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Chris had wondered why Max had gotten slower to reply.\n\nWhite Crow continued walking. \"She obviously cares a lot about you.\"\n\n\"I guess she does.\"\n\n\"You guess?\" he asked, picking up on her phrasing.\n\n\"She's never seen me in-person.\"\n\n\"Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"Well... she'll meet me for real soon.\" Chris immediately regretted saying that.\n\nWhite Crow started walking again, shaking his head. \"There is no real you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, indignantly.\n\n\"Chris, it's all fake. You at work, you talking to Max, you talking to me. None of those people are real.\"\n\n\"You think... I need to be more honest?\" She'd not been expecting that from a terrorist.\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. You need to decide how you want people to see you.\"\n\nChris was sure they'd now doubled back on themselves, but nothing around them looked familiar. There was more intact equipment in the rooms around them, connected together by a tangle of wires and tubes.\n\nShe turned back to White Crow to continue their conversation. \"I'm not sure if you'd understand this, but sometimes people don't believe what you tell them, even when it's true...\" She trailed off.\n\nHe smiled at her again. \"Chris, I used to be a Librarian. I sometimes forget I no longer have ten arms.\"\n\n\"Er... What?\" asked a confused Chris.\n\nHe continued, elaborating. \"I don't know how long it lasted for, or even why I owed a debt to the Wanderer's Library. But once it no longer required my service, the Serpent spat me back out. I knew more than a dozen languages, I knew the shelving system like the back of my hand, but after so long as a Librarian, I didn't know who I was.\"\n\n\"That sounds... disorienting?\" She wasn't sure why he was telling her this.\n\n\"The Serpent's Nest found me, wandering the stacks. I was a complete //tabula rasa//, a blank slate to write on. I envied their conviction, and wanted it for myself.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you weren't... er...\" He looked at her expectantly, as she trailed off. She reluctantly finished the sentence. \"Brainwashed?\"\n\n\"My brain was already washed!\" He didn't seem upset. \"I invented White Crow to fill the empty space back in. He's as real as any other mask I could wear, but I enjoy playing the part. The righteous rebel against the GOC, against the Foundation, against anyone else who threatens us.\"\n\nChris understood him now. He needed to be part of something he could believe in.\n\nHe was now looking directly at her as he walked, and no longer checking the map. \"Chris, I want you to make the most of this opportunity. You've made a clean break with the past. I'm interested to see what you do now you're free.\"\n\nWhite Crow was slowing. While the walls were still concrete, Chris could smell the unmistakable scent of old books, coming from somewhere up ahead.\n\n\"You know what? I never liked that name.\"\n\nHe looked at her, still smiling.\n\n\"White Crow, my friends call me Circe.\"\n\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Circe.\"\n\n\"I really haven't changed anything important...\"\n\n\"Not yet, Circe. But I believe you will.\"\n\nThey walked out of EURTEC together, two Wanderers entering the Library.\n\n----\n\nThe section of the Library they emerged in was lined with tall shelves of academic books, some in English but others in what Circe could recognise as Latin, even if she couldn't read it. White Crow lead her around a couple of corners, towards a middle aged woman in a grey sweater, her eyes magnified by the large spectacles she was wearing.\n\n\"Hello, Max!\" said White Crow. \"As promised, I've delivered her to you!\"\n\nCirce tensed as the woman ran over and embraced her. \"Circe! I'm so glad you're okay!\" Max quickly let go. \"Sorry, I shouldn't have done that. You told me you don't like being touched.\"\n\nWhite Crow wheeled away his trolley, still squeaking under the weight of the two boxes loaded onto it. \"I'll give you two some privacy. Don't worry, I'll find you again later.\" He passed around a corner.\n\nCirce hugged Max again, but less tightly, and more awkwardly. Her chin rested on top of the other woman's head. \"Max, if it's you, it's OK.\"\n\n\"Wow, your heartbeat is really racing,\" said Max, speaking quietly. \"That White Crow guy... He didn't...\"\n\nCirce let go of Max. \"He's not so bad. We had a deal, and he followed through. I'm here now.\"\n\nMax nodded, then stood silently for a nearly a minute. \"Oh, sorry Circe! I forgot you can't hear me. I'm letting the Maxwellist Network in the Library know you made it out of Eurtec safely.\"\n\nCirce winced. \"They all know about me?\"\n\nMax smiled. \"Of course, you're part of the community!\" She paused, her eyes unfocused. \"I'm getting a lot of congratulations, everyone's glad you're OK. There's a lot of... anti-Gock memes? I'll have to show you later.\"\n\n\"When I get my own brain implant?\" asked Circe.\n\n\"Oh no, that's not necessary!\" said Max. \"There's a mobile app. I'm old though, I never really got the hang of apps.\"\n\n\"You're not old!\" said Circe. \"You're... er...\"\n\nMax hugged her again. \"Thanks Circe, but I'm actually old enough to be your -\"\n\nCirce interrupted just in time. \"Don't say that. Please.\"\n\nMax laughed as she let go. \"Sorry. We already said we're like sisters. Anyway, I was going to say there's no rush to get hardware fitted, you can meet in person. There's loads of us here in the Library, it might just take a while to find them...\"\n\n\"Can we not see too many new people right away?\" pleaded Circe.\n\n\"Of course!\" Max smiled. \"Sorry, I forgot you must be stressed. If you don't mind staying with me, we can head to the Way back to Three Portlands?\"\n\n\"Thanks Max. There's enough space?\"\n\n\"I have my house share, but they're all Maxwellist. They'll be happy to make room for you while you settle in. You're one of us.\"\n\nCirce followed as Max lead the way, both of them walking in silence. Circe broke it first. \"Max, I have no idea what I'm going to do next. My whole life was in Eurtec, and I don't even miss it.\"\n\nMax shrugged. \"There's no rush. Take as much time as you need to work things out.\"\n\nCirce nodded. \"I'll think of something. I'm not sure how but... I'd like to help.\"\n\n\"What with?\"\n\nCirce smiled. \"I have no idea. Not yet. But I'm looking forward to finding out.\"\n\n[[>]]\n[[[More Cunning Than Any Beast]]] »\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
