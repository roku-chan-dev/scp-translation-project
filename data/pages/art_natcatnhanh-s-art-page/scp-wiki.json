I love everything about the concepts and website. \n\nAbout me: Sometime in 2019, I came across SCP through [https://www.pixiv.net/user/18923/series/10631 松(A・TYPEcorp.)] and their [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3jjv0wpZJg&list=PL8fm_MTq3WfU7AlpGkU3W44R_WO3cY_7N Oversimplified SCP] series that was posted onto Youtube. I've been a huge fan of it ever since, and I adore TYPEcorp's art. I automatically consider the majority of their designs as canon and draw them accordingly in my work keke\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-978-extended-test-logs Desire Camera is my favorite SCP], it's very beautiful and heartfelt. The epitome of everything I like about the SCP website and all things relating to it.  \n\nI like cosmic horror, and horror that still centers around themes of humanity. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes that I associate with SCP is: \"I believe in a universe that dosen't care and people who do\" from the 2017 video game; Night In The Woods \n\nhttps://www.tumblr.com/natcatnhanh\n\n= ₊⊹♡\n\n+ //Here is some of my art though// \n//[ w/ artist commentary, and dates ⊹☽ ]//\n \n[[collapsible show=\"worktober day three, Foundation Medical Examiners\" hide=\"epic\"]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/natcatnhanh-sandbox/foundation%20medical%20examiners.jpg]]\n\n \n> \n> art for Worktober day three, Foundation Medical Examiners!

I remember reuploading it on my tumblr like 7 different times because I wanted everything to look perfect.
