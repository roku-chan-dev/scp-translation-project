I can drive the rest of the way, if you want. \n\n**Narjeen:** No no! I’m fine! Uh, let me just check something-\n\n//Narjeen grabs her phone off the dashboard.//\n\n**Cooper:** Salam, not while you’re driving, deer- \n\n **Narjeen:** Hang on—\n\n**Cooper:** Deer—\n\n**Narjeen:** Yes, love? \n\n**Cooper:** Deer— DEER! \n\n**Narjeen:** Why are you calling me—\n\n//A deer scurries in front of the vehicle. Narjeen, distracted, catches the animal on the bumper, launching it approximately 20 feet forward. She brakes and swerves.// \n\n**Narjeen:** FUCK- \n\n**Cooper:** Are you alright? \n\n//Narjeen stays silent. Cooper exits the car and approaches the deer. With significant effort, she pulls the carcass to the side of the road. Returning to the car door, she leans in through the passenger window.//\n\n**Cooper:** Salam? You okay? \n\n**Narjeen:** Yeah… Yeah, I’m sorry. That was stupid of me. \n\n**Cooper:** It's okay, let’s just get back to the site. \n\n**Narjeen:** Listen, can you promise me you won’t tell anyone about this? I’m already knee-deep in reprimands for my driving, and I can’t—\n\n**Cooper:** The car is dented. \n\n**Narjeen:** It's barely noticeable! \n\n**Cooper:** Hang on, where's the-\n\n//Her gaze is drawn to where she had pushed the carcass.// \n\n**Cooper:** Where’s the deer? \n\n//A knock comes from the driver-side door.

A second strikes knocks it to the ground.// \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Stop! Stop! You win!\n\n//SCP-2845-J lays on the ground, cradling one of its hind feet and sniffling. The bottom of the leg is wound in a tight cast.// \n\n**Narjeen:** I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were—\n\n**SCP-2845-J:** A living being? A fellow creature of Earth? Someone with their own life and existence? Dreams and hopes? \n\n**Narjeen:** Something like that. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You broke my foot! Then you pushed my body aside like it was some sort of trash! How am I supposed to live like this? How am I- I—\n\n//SCP-2845-J grows teary-eyed and wipes its eyes with a hoof. Narjeen and Cooper exchange looks.//\n\n**Narjeen:** Are you okay? \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** If-If I can’t use my deer leg, I’m not going to be able to do my deer duties! How will I support my deer son after my deer wife took him in our deervorce? I don’t even have a place to stay right now, and- \n\n//SCP-2845-J buries his face into his hooves.// \n\n**Narjeen:** Oh, Ari- Look at him! We can’t leave like this! We should take him with us. \n\n**Cooper:** It's a talking deer, Salam. We should call a containment unit, because that's kind of what we're supposed to do.\n\n**Narjeen:** I mean, he seems harmless enough?\n\n**Cooper:** //I’m sorry?//  \n\n**Narjeen:** I did this to him. It’s only right we help him get back on his feet.\n\n**Cooper:** This is so out of line… \n\n**Narjeen:** Besides, if someone finds out I hit a deer, they'd probably make you do all the driving. \n\n//Cooper stares at the deer, dumbfounded.//\n\n**Cooper:** If anyone finds out—\n\n**Narjeen:** They won't. Thank you Ari! I promise I’ll do this right. \n\n//She opens the car door and ushers SCP-2845-J into the back seat. Its antlers catch on the roof, causing a loud screech. Cooper sighs again.// \n\n**Cooper:** Dear god. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** That’s me. \n\n**Cooper:** You’re a god? \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Something like that. \n\n<END LOG>\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Female_Sambar_Deer_in_Sri_Lanka.jpg/640px-Female_Sambar_Deer_in_Sri_Lanka.jpg | caption=SCP-2845-J confronting Junior Researcher Cooper and Narjeen upon initial contact.| width=WIDTH-GOES-HERE]]\n\n**Item Number:** SCP-2845-J \n\n**Object Class:** Roommate \n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2845-J is currently housed within the personal travel quarters of Junior Researchers Ariadne Cooper and Salam Narjeen at Area 63. The entity must remain concealed from all other personnel, and access to the quarters is restricted to Cooper and Narjeen exclusively. SCP-2845-J is permitted to utilize the couch in the communal area for sleeping and has unrestricted access to the adjoining kitchenette and restroom. \n\nIn return, SCP-2845-J has agreed to take on a share of household responsibilities, primarily pertaining to tidying the living area. This includes ensuring that any mess generated by the entity is promptly removed. \n\n**Description:** SCP-2845-J designates a male white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) of indeterminate age. Physically, SCP-2845-J has demonstrated no anomalous traits apart from its ability to communicate verbally in English and its humanoid-level intelligence. SCP-2845-J shows an increased level of emotional sensitivity and anthropomorphic thought; it will often bring up such subjects as feelings of distress, loneliness, and existential uncertainty, along with a substantial desire for companionship and stability.\n\nThe entity also claims to possess additional anomalous abilities related to the forests and climate of Northern West Virginia, further asserting that they were provided to it as part of its \"deer job,\" but has not physically demonstrated these properties. \n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n**Cooper:** Okay, I’ve checked us in. \n\n**Narjeen:** Sounds lovely!

The junior researchers stare at it.// \n\n**Cooper:** Your clothes!\n\n**Narjeen:** My my, this is endeering. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:**  Should I have taken some of the other one's clothes instead? \n\n**Narjeen:** No no, don’t mess with Ari’s stuff. \n\n**Cooper:** I need a shower.

Narjeen and SCP-2845-J stare at the door, then back to each other.// \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Why do you wear this cloth over your head, and that one doesn’t? \n\n**Narjeen:** Oh this? It’s a hijab. Ari and I have different faiths, and we wear different things to demonstrate that faith. For me, it's a symbol of—\n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You both have //different// gods?\n\n**Narjeen:** That’s a bit complicated. Some say he’s the same god, others say he’s different. It depends who you ask. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You’re telling me some gods get //multiple// religions? \n\n**Narjeen:** Again that’s a whole other conversation, but either way, Ari and I respect each other, work together, are friends, all that good stuff. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You have a lucky god. I wish //I// could have a religion. \n\n**Narjeen:** A religion? \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** I’m //a// god of nature. Not //the// god. And, well, people don’t respect the “one of many” tag that comes with that title. \n\n**Narjeen:** Well, if you are a god, I think that’s very rude of them. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Really? \n\n**Narjeen:** Yeah.

Like uh...  \n\n**Cooper:** How about washing? Doing the dishes or the laundry? \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** I don’t think that’s very fair to put me through, seeing as I have been forbidden from wearing clothes or eating off your plates. \n\n**Narjeen:** We didn’t forbid- I mean, fair, actually.\n\n**Cooper:** How about vacuuming, then? You //do// leave quite a bit of hair around the place. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You mean that loud monster that eats everything that goes under it? I don’t think even a great nature god such as I could tame such a beast. \n\n**Cooper:** Would you at least mind tidying up some of the physical space here? Not to point fingers, but the living room has gotten fairly cluttered after you moved in. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Listen, ladies, I don’t think you understand. Gods aren’t meant to do chores and menial work. That’s what we have followers and religions for. \n\n**Cooper:** Still, you are living here, and you did agree to help out while you’re here. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You’re saying you’re going back on acknowledging me as a god?\n\n**Narjeen:** I mean yes, you are a god, and I’m sure you’re a great one- but right now we see you as more of a roommate than someone I’d worship, y’know? \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** So you’d rather worship a god you’ve never met than one standing in your own living room? Sounds like you're mad at the wrong god. \n\n**Narjeen:** At least my god doesn’t talk down to me, or come into my room, make a mess, and then never clean shit up! \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Your god doesn’t even talk to you! \n\n**Narjeen:** He does! In his own way! \n\n//She shifts in her seat uncomfortably.//\n\n**Narjeen:** And even if it were true, after dealing with you? I think I prefer my gods being quiet! At least then I don't know they don't give a shit about me, unlike with //you.//\n\n//She looks away, tears threatening to fall. Cooper glares at the entity.//\n\n**Cooper:** Trust me, you’re not the first god or deity who’s tried converting us, and while I’m flattered, this is frankly why we make it a point to separate personal beliefs from work at the Foundation where and when it’s necessary. \n\n**SCP-2845-J:** You humans are such assholes when it comes to that. You’d rather beg some god you’ve probably never even //met// to fix all your problems than the one offering to let you serve him directly. You’re all the same! Just absolute morons, never even giving the nice gods a chance. \n\n**Cooper:** We’re asking you to solve the problems that you’re causing. You should at least do some fucking chores before asking us to dedicate our lives to you? \n\n**Narjeen:** Look, I’m sure you’re plenty nice as a god, and you’ll find those followers when you’re ready. But those followers aren’t us, and, well-\n\n**SCP-2845-J:** Ladies, I'm done here. You did this to me. You're responsible for me until I feel better.\n\n//The entity clambers out of the chair and returns to the living room.// \n\n**Narjeen:** I made a mistake. You were right, Ari. You’re always right about these things. \n\n**Cooper:** “Always” is a bit of a stretch... \n\n**Narjeen:** I can’t believe he thought we’d just switch religions for him! You think all gods are that entitled?  \n\n**Cooper:** Probably not, but you were also just trying to help. Don't be hard on yourself.\n\n**Narjeen:** I don't know if I want him around anymore. \n\n**Cooper:** Don’t worry.
