The code consists of a combination of span classes you can mix and match. Here's how they fit together:\n\n||~ Span Class ||~ What they're for ||~ Colour Code ||\n|| grade || basis gradient colouring, lighter colour || marker[colour] ||\n|| hili || a more blocked/pressure colouring, lighter colour || marker[colour] ||\n|| acc || emphasis and ink bleeding effect, darker colour || darker[colour] ||\n|| underdlined || double lines under the words|| liner[colour] ||\n|| underdash || dashed line under the words || liner[colour] ||\n\nThe split exists so you can put the marker and the underlining in the same span class without it affecting each other! You can choose which and how much of these layers you'd want to add, though. Whether you want the ink bleeding effect or not, which layers you stack, etc. Here's how I'd do it:\n\nFirstly, there is the base code for highlighter. We'll be using the green one for our annotation of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173 SCP Wiki's Sacred Text].\n\nFirst order of business is highlighting the containment procedures. Imagine taking that big marker and going to town on the text! We use the **grade + colour span class** for this, so in this case, **@@[[span class=\"grade markergreen\"]]Text[[/span]]@@**.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Code example\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@**Special Containment Procedures:** Item [[span class=\"grade markergreen\"]]SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times.

At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173[[/span]] until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.\n[[/div]]\n\nAlready looking pretty lighted, but you could add some accents. Imagine specific words getting a second coating for emphasis, the marker stopping and restarting again over the words. For that, we use the non-fading version of the highlighter: **hili (for highlighter) + colour span class**, which is in this case **@@[[span class=\"hili markergreen\"]]Text[[/span]]@@**.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Code example\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@**Special Containment Procedures:** Item [[span class=\"grade markergreen\"]]SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times.

However, you can also add a little more flourish by adding darker short lines, like pauses in the marker getting through the document. You can also use it for a specific (set of) words, as if someone frantically over-marked it and it got messy. There is a very minimal blur added to it, so words that get this coating get a little ink bleeding effect. For this, we use the darker, blurry accent marker: ****acc (for accent) + darker colour span class**, which is in this case **@@[[span class=\"acc darkergreen\"]]Text[[/span]]@@**.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Code example\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@**Special Containment Procedures:** Item [[span class=\"grade markergreen\"]]SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times.

We're gonna do that with the equivalent of a blue pen: **under dlined (for under double-lined) + colour**, which is **@@[[span class=\"underdlined linerblue\"]]Text[[/span]]@@**. Some details might just need a little more thinking, and we can mark those with a dotted underlining: **underdash + colour**, which means **@@[[span class=\"underdash blue\"]]Text[[/span]]@@**.
