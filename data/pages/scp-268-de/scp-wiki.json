Apart from basic supplements, it is to be equipped with a variety of hairdresser tools it requires for its labor.\n\nSite personnel as well as non-hazardous humanoid SCPs of Safe or Euclid class are allowed to request a haircut from SCP-268-DE with site-lead approval, which can be authorized by the leading researcher following thorough examination. For this purpose, a written request describing the desired haircut in detail must be submitted, which does not allow for any free designing of the hairdo, in order to negate the creation of an SCP-268-DE-A instance.\n\nSCP-268-DE-A instances may only be created for authorized tests and need site-lead's approval. After the finalization of an SCP-268-DE-A instance and weighing of the risks, the leading researcher decides how to proceed. If SCP-268-DE-A does not pose any risk for persons or containment or necessitates observations and tests over a longer period of time, the test subject may keep SCP-268-DE-A until the hair is grown out. Otherwise, termination of SCP-268-DE-A may succeed by use of SCP-268-DE, depilatory, fire or akalis.\n\n**Description:** At time of this writing, SCP-268-DE designates a woman at the age of 24 who worked in the ██████████ hairdresser salon in Berlin before her containment. It measures 1.76 m in height, weighs 60 kg, and possesses shoulder-length hair, the ends of which it likes to dye in red or pink.\n\nIf SCP-268-DE is given exact instructions about the haircut[[footnote]]This can be made both verbally as well as in writing. However, the written way is favored to exclude eventual misunderstandings.[[/footnote]], it will carry them out without any incidents.[[footnote]]Hairstyles created this way show no anomalous properties, with attempts to insert anomalous properties failing due to the subject's inability.[[/footnote]] The anomalous effect of SCP-268-DE only occurs when a subject grants it free choice to design their hair.\n\nAfter the subject expressed the wish that SCP-268-DE is to decide about the hairdo's type and designing, without giving exact specifications, SCP-268-DE will enter a kind of trance and begin with its work on the subject's hair. In the process, it showed the anomalous ability to completely alter the hair's physical properties. Hair could be observed being shortened or elongated, hardened, liquidated, abnormally deformed, dyed, or even given a life on its own through the effect, what should be impossible with present resources. During this process, the affected subject appears to fall into a kind of deep relaxation, and no longer reacts to external influences, not even to those on their own hair. The process can vary from five minutes to three hours depending on the complexity of the hairstyle. The hairstyle resulting from this process is designated SCP-268-DE-A.\n\nSCP-268-DE-A instances greatly differ from each other, with every newly created one being unique. Some represent objects, including their intended usages and physical properties, others are modeled after animals and show similar behavioral patterns like them. The only commonality is that the DNA in all of them corresponds to the subject's hair, even if their structure and composition greatly deviates.\nAttempts to have SCP-268-DE create SCP-268-DE-A instances with exact instructions failed so far due to its inability to do so, even if it already created those once before. According to their statement, it can only create SCP-268-DE-A instances in this trance state without precise instructions and has no control about its creation.\n\nSubjects who wear SCP-268-DE-A always testify that they are pleased with the hairstyle, even if they have negative effects on them. Depending on their composition and properties, instances of SCP-268-DE-A can not be destroyed by conventional means like simple haircuts or with shavers. SCP-268-DE-A instances can solely be destroyed by SCP-268-DE via outgrowing the hair [[footnote]]What may take several weeks to two months depending on the subject.[[/footnote]], application of depilatory, akalis, or through direct fire exposure[[footnote]]Past SCP-268-DE-A instances showed no differences to usual hair regarding their methods of damaging and destruction, despite their altered structure and composition.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-268-DE attracted the Foundation's attention on the 20/07/2021, when an emergency call was received at a police station that the hairdo of a female customer would allegedly attack persons inside the hairdressing salon ██████████. Agents who arrived at the hairdresser salon mentioned discovered a 56 year old female customer, whose 2 meter long tentacle-like hair reached around for objects to throw in all directions, resulting in several injuries. In panic, SCP-268-DE hid inside the break room of the hairdresser salon.\n\nAfter getting reinforcement, the agents could immobilize SCP-268-DE-A and the person affected and transfer them to the nearest site. After questioning led them to SCP-268-DE and she was also put into containment, amnestica were administered to the remaining attendee, with the incident being disguised as an unsatisfied customer's violent outbreak. The woman affected by SCP-268-DE was left on-site until the hair had grown back and lost their anomalous properties. She was administered an amnestica thereafter, with her absence being cloaked as an spontaneous stay at a health resort due to a psychologically induced nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Test Log SCP-268-DE\" hide=\"Close addendum\"]]\n\n__**Test Log SCP-268-DE**__\n\nSeveral tests were conducted concerning SCP-268-DE's abilites and the resulting SCP-268-DE-A instances. SCP-268-DE was given the order to cut or process the respective test subject's hair according to her own ideas.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Subject:** Male, light-blond crew cut\n\n**Result:** The test subject's hair was elongated laterally by SCP-268-DE and formed into a construct akin to moose antlers in form and structure. SCP-268-DE-A had adapted the rigidity and structure of horn, even though the individual hairs were still clearly visible.\n\nDespite the enormous size and actually heavy weight, the test subject seemed to have no difficulties in wearing it, even if it had difficulties when performing fast movements, standing up, or tilting the head.\n\nSCP-268-DE-A was retained until it grew out and lost its structure. The 5 meter long hair was later cut and discarded by SCP-268-DE.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test subject:** Female, black, shoulder-length, straight hair.\n\n**Result:** The hair was pinned up into a 1 meter long, highly bounded braid with six segments by SCP-268-DE. An elongated curved tip, with which a poisonous substance could be injected into other subjects. An injection of the substance into its victims resulted in severe pain in the affected area, nausea, dizziness, fever spasms, sweating and, in two cases, shortness of breath and cardiac arrest. An examination of the substance revealed it to be a toxin similar to those of some species of scorpions.\n\nDue to the heightened risk of injuries, which renders the deployment of SCP-268-DE impossible, SCP-268-DE-A was destroyed using potent depilatories, which led to severe chemical burns at the test subject's sculp.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Female, green colored crew cut, featuring an 20 cm long rat tail at the back.\n\n**Result:** SCP-268-DE extended the length of the braid until it reached the rough body mass of the test subject. Afterwards, it formed a female figure from the hair which matched the subject in height and physique and stood back to back with her. The resulting SCP-268-DE-A instance imitated the subject's movements [[footnote]]For example, SCP-268-DE-A lifted the right arm when the subject its right arm.[[/footnote]]. The subject was unable to move from the spot, as SCP-268-DE-A moved forwards when the subject wanted to do it.\n\nThe subject was given stationary care until the hair grew out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Male, plain black middle parting.\n\n**Result:** SCP-268-DE extended the hair to a length of 3 meters, forming eight separate structures similar to the stilt legs of arachnids. They could lift the subject, so that it dangled in the air while the leg structures could move freely, even on the floor and across the ceiling. The legs were pointed and sharp on their ends. When one of the present researchers approached the subject, one of the legs stabbed forward and systematically penetrated the heart of the researcher, who perished on the spot. The present security personnel admonished the subject to not attack, but it stated to not be in control. SCP-268-DE-A then attacked the security personnel, which led to the subject's termination via firearms.\n\nThe legs continued to move despite the subject's death, killing two researchers and two security guards, before it could be terminated via fire.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Female, blond afro.\n\n**Result:** The hair was straightened and formed into a hair construct that was similar in form to a beehive. When approaching the object, a deep buzz could be heard coming from within, which increased in volume the closer one comes. If the object is being touched by someone else then SCP-268-DE or the test subject, small hairballs flew out of it, who caused the feeling of a burning sting on the skin when touched. The pain was described to be similar to a bee's.\n\nThe subject kept this hairstyle until the hair grew out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Male, purple-dyed mohak hairstyle.\n\n**Result:** The subject's hair was elongated and widened, halved in the middle and laterally folded down, so that it is similar to laid out wings. They were capable to flap 200 times per second, resulting in the subject flying through the test area. The subject was unable to control the direction of flight, causing it to crash into walls, windows, and other objects on several occasions, leading to several fractions of the skull and other bones in the subject.\n\nThe subject could be secured via a net fixture and SCP-268-DE-A neutralized using depilatories. The subject inhabits a comatose state since this incident.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Female, brown bob cut.\n\n**Result:** The subject's hairdo at the back of the head was formed in a way that made it similar in appearance to the German fashion designer Harald Glöckler with closed eyes. When the face is being observed for more than ten seconds, the eyes opened and stared at the observer until they avert their gaze. People who observed this face while it stared at them found it extremely disturbing, attempting to avoid further contact.\n\nThe hairstyle was kept until it grew out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Dr. Männelein, bald except for a grey-brown hair wreath.\n\n**Note:** This was not officially approved.\n\n**Result:** After SCP-268-DE's work, Dr. Männelein wore about 15 cm long, straight hair, which formed a dense, 10 cm high accumulation atop. When rustling a plastic bag, SCP-268-DE-A reacted with loud, shrill squeaking noises akin to guinea pigs. When it is offered vegetables, it disappeared inside the dense hair tangle with silent squeaking and cooing.\n\nAfter not growing out, SCP-268-DE-A was terminated via depilatories.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n__Addendum__\n\n\"I want to point out once more that anomalies are not to be used for re-polishing one's own ego. Yes, I know that many colleagues here have age-related doubts and mourn the youth, wishing to feel young once again. But there are other methods than to unnecessarily risk a containment breach. We were lucky that Dr. Männelein turned out well.\n\nUsually, a serious disciplinary penalty would be necessary, but I think, in this case, he already is punished enough that he has to wear this hairdo for a month.\"\n\n//- Site-lead Dr. ███████//\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Female, brown chignon.\n\n**Result:** The finished haircut was converted in such a way that it resembled an pineapple fruit. The the outflowing odour was reminiscent of fresh pineapple. Attempts to cut SCP-268-DE-A open were strictly rejected by SCP-268-DE, however.\n\nThe subject had to wear this hairdo until the hair grew out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Male, shoulder-length black hair\n\n**Result:** SCP-268-DE shaved almost all hair of the subject up to a long mop of hair above the forehead, which she formed into an oblong, pointed, horn-like structure, 50 cm in length. She then bleached it until it had become completely white, and decorated it with colorful glitter dust. When moved, the SCP-268-DE-A instance created a rainbow-colored, sparkling mist veil. When SCP-268-DE-A is touched, it began to sparkle and emitted a scent evocative of fruit gum.\n\nThe subject had to wear the haircut until the hair grew out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Subject:** Pomeranian dog\n\n**Result:** SCP-268-DE refused to work on the subject at first on the grounds of her not being a dog groomer. Following several prompts and threat of disciplinary action, it began with her work. After SCP-268-DE had finished her work, the subject possessed 10 approximately 1 m long and 5 cm thick hair structures akin to arms that featured small, hand-like protrusions, with which SCP-268-DE-A could grab and punch.\n\nShortly thereafter, the subject leapt up and attacked the personnel in its vicinity to grab them and tear their hair violently from their heads, whereafter it added them to its own hair to form additional hand structures. The subject itself barked and emitted whimpering sounds in the process, while SCP-268-DE-A continuously collected hair for its development. SCP-268-DE seemed frightened, but was completely ignored by SCP-268-DE-A.\n\nSecurity personnel called to the test area terminated both SCP-268-DE-A as well as the subject by use of a flamethrower.\n\nSince this incident, SCP-268-DE denied all tests involving animals, and rather accepted all disciplinary action.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview-Log SCP-268-DE\" hide=\"Anhang schließen\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n__**Interview SCP-268-DE**__\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-268-DE\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Mähne\n\n**Foreword:** The interview took place at the 27/07/2021, a week after the containment of SCP-268-DE. The subject's abilites were confirmed via testing.\n\n\n\n**< Begin Log >**\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** Good morning, SCP-268-DE. How are you today?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** What? Hey, Doc, what's all this shit about? Can somebody finally tell me what is going on here? And why does everybody call me SCP-268-DE? I'm a damn human and have a name, ya' know! I'm Jenny ████, for fucks sake! Want to finally get home!\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** I understand your situation, but there are regulations we have to comply with after all, Jenny. And I am afraid you can't go home for the time being. Not after this incident inside the hairdresser's salon.\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Maaaaaan, I've already told a thousand times that I have no idea how this shit happened. Or in those „tests“. You can't accuse me! Shit, this ain't a flatfoot's shed here, right?\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** No, Jenny, don't worry. We are not here to accuse you of anything. We are here to study that and help you. But in order for us to help you you need to help us in understanding the whole issue. You understand?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Hm, well, I have no choice, do I? And what about my job?\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** We've already sorted it all out with your boss. But let's get to the questions. How about you tell me what happened on that day?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** For my sake. Now, you know I have not been around for long. Only recently completed my training. Had been quite a hard stair to take. Haven't been that good actually, and had to take the exam multiple times. Was always really nervous. That one time in the exam...\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** Well, you do not have to go this far. We simply like to know what happened on that day.\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Well, even though you miss something. Now, usually the customer says what he wants. Shortcut, hair so and so short, classic bob... Accurate and precise instructions. And what I didn't know, I let the colleague or the boss do. Either way, Miss Böcke was back. A regular customer. Normally wants her standard haircut. Simple page cut with exact measurements. But she had a date on that day. Matthias or so, knew her from...\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** Please focus, Jenny.\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** All right, all right! Sorry. Habit from the job. Anyways, she wanted something different. Something unusual. I should simply surprise her. Fuck, really! I've never had such a case where I was to just make something without specifications. My colleague was on vacation and boss said that I should do it, as she was too busy. Boy, I was soooooo nervous! So I just snatched scissor and the other stuff and then...\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** And then?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** I have no idea about what happened afterwards. It was something like being in a sort of... Don't know, what those yoga meditation people have sometimes. When you don't think or something like that.\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** A trance?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Yes, a trance! Was totally out of it. Couldn't notice anything around me. My arms went full bore, but I was completely out of control. They simply happened. My eyes saw only blackness. Really heard nothing. No idea what the boss or Miss Böcke did. Didn't even know what I did. It really felt like someone was making my movements, without me noticing. Like a doll or so. Really creepy, come to think of it, boy!\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** Do you also feel this way when making other hairstyles here?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Yeah, man! I'm all blacked out. But only when I don't get exact prompts. When someone says „Yo, Jenny, surprise me“. When I get templates: No problem. But when I have to do something randomly: Trance!\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** What exactly happened then?\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** It then made „bing“. Like those meditation bells. And then I saw Miss Böcke's hair. Shit, they really were alive! Like those disgusting octopuses! Lashed out and grabbed everything. Really creepy! And Miss Böcke didn't even react to it. As if it were the most normal thing! Boss ran outside in panic and called the cops, while I hid inside the break room. That was really scary! And then the cops showed up and brought me and Miss Böcke to this place. You know the rest.\n\n**Dr. Mähne:** Thank you, Jenny. I think that's it for now.\n\n**SCP-268-DE:** Hey! And how long do I have to stay in here?\n\n**< END LOG >**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
