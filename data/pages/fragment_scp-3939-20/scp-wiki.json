It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\n> **3939-Alpha:** I'm on my way. Don't make any major discoveries until I get there!\n\nYou get up, leave your office and start to make your way down the maze of corridors towards pre-containment.\n\n> **3939-Beta:** is that a joke?\n\nYou reach the holding cell and scan your card against the scanner. Red light becomes green, there's a click, and the door slides open. Sally, exposed, spins around to see you.\n\n\"Yeah.\" you smile. \"It's a joke.\"\n\nShe smiles back, but it's not genuine.\n\n\"Right.\" she says, turning back to the object. She steps over to the far left of the room. It doesn't move. \"Did you see that?\"\n\n\"See what?\"\n\n\"It moved.\" She walks over to the far side of the room. \"See?\"\n\n\"No, I'm not seeing anything.\"\n\n\"Come over here, then.\" she says, in a tone of voice that makes it very clear that it's a suggestion and not an order. You comply.\n\nAs you move, the brass horn does indeed rotate. No matter where you are, it points directly at your face. If you move left and right, it twists clockwise and anticlockwise. If you move up or down (or closer or further) it tilts up and down with you.\n\n\"Huh, you were right.\" you say. You could swear you hear a slight crackle coming from within the horn.\n\n\"Told you. Look, I think I've got enough to be making a start on. I'll quickly go write up what I know so far, then I'll come right back.\"\n\nYou nod, thinking about the crackle you think you just heard. \"Do it. I'll be here.\"\n\nShe leaves the holding cell, sliding the door shut behind her. It locks with a click. You check your pocket for your card â€” you still have it. It could be disastrous if you didn't.\n\nYou turn to the object. You're sure that you heard something.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/7 \"Hello?\"]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
