Access to a mobile device has been deemed acceptable by the containment team. Content posted by SCP-4831-1 is to be heavily monitored to prevent confidential information from being leaked. For more information on SCP-4831-1's needs, please see Document-315.\n\nThe house containing SCP-4831 has been secluded from the public. SCP-4831-1's family are not to be amnesticized. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4831 is the bathroom of a household within Wet Money, Kansas, US. SCP-4831's anomalous properties manifested on 25/4/2018, and the Foundation  was made aware of its existence on 2/5/2018. Attempting to access the interior of SCP-4831 is physically impossible.\n\nThe door and window for SCP-4831 are locked, and all attempts at unlocking both have failed. The walls, door, floor, and window inside SCP-4831 are indestructible as well, and have resisted all attempts at dismantling. This includes the use of sharp tools, explosives, high amounts of heat, and corrosion. \n\nSCP-4831-1 is, at the time of writing, 17-year-old Tucker Miles who was inside of SCP-4831 when it gained its anomalous properties and is now trapped within. Besides this, SCP-4831-1 is physically non-anomalous. All attempts at freeing SCP-4831-1 have failed.\n\n__**Addendum:**__\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Household-531 Security Footage: #1\" hide=\"Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur\"]]\n\n> **Background:** Footage was taken from security camera footage that overlooked SCP-4831's door. \n> \n> **Time:** 15:15 \n> \n> //[BEGIN LOG]//\n> \n> //SCP-4831-1 is heard opening the front door, presumably returning from school.// \n> \n> //SCP-4831-1's mother is heard yelling from another room.//\n> \n> **Mrs. Miles:** Tucker, can you do me a favor? \n> \n> **SCP-4831-1:** What?\n> \n> **Mrs. Miles:** Can you bring me the duct tape from the bathroom?\n> \n> **SCP-4831-1:** 'Kay, give me a sec.\n> \n> //SCP-4831-1 is seen entering SCP-4831 to retrieve the duct tape.
