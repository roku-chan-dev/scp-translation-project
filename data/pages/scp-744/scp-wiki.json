As SCP-744's anomalous properties are confined to a singular, isolated locality and only affect individuals that are highly unlikely to attempt a breach of the Veil,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]GoI-952 has stringent information security procedures regarding anomalies within their facilities.[[/span]] containment of SCP-744 has been deemed unnecessary.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Cernunnos:** Containment of item is possible, but impractical.[[/span]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-744 is the Olney Ironworks West Virginia Manufacturing Center, a structure that has become host to causal, spatial,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**UPDATE (06/12/2010):** Potential links to [[[SCP-4370]]] are currently under investigation.[[/span]] and semantic dissociation.

C. Public representative received an anonymous tip that implicated the West Virginia Manufacturing Center in anomalous activity. To confirm the tip's validity, Foundation agents confiscated GoI-952's surveillance footage, utilizing BENTHAM.AIC to analyze and isolate all potentially anomalous events. The following transcripts are excerpts of particular interest.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]To view all transcripts of recorded SCP-744 anomalous activity, contact RAISA liaison Ingrid Blum.[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 04/07/1996\n\n**SPAN:** 07:55:34 - 08:05:22 EST\n\n----\n\nA security officer (identified as Ester Rojas) enters the employee breakroom. She crosses from one end of the room to the other, which takes 12 seconds. Between **[07:55:46]** and **[08:02:15]**, she prepares a cup of coffee, drinks it, and rinses out her mug. Rojas proceeds to exit the room, crossing from one end to the other in 187 seconds.\n\nRojas' walking speed while departing is approximately equal to that of her speed entering. For the duration of the recording, the breakroom does not experience any visible spatial shifts.\n\nAt no point does Rojas display awareness of this discrepancy.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 11/22/1996\n\n**SPAN:** 07:41:12 - 17:09:56 EST\n\n----\n\nFrom **[07:41:12]** to **[08:14:55]**, 46 men and women enter the factory floor. As each arrives, they notice that roughly 85% of floor machinery has been replaced with mechanisms not normally found within ironworks.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Including, but not limited to: automobile manufacturing equipment, industrial looms, an 18th-century printing press, a large piston of unknown function, and 7 //spondias mombin// tree saplings that have grown through the concrete floor.[[/span]] The general reaction appears to be that of mild surprise and annoyance. At **[08:02:00]**, a man (identified as Ray Briggs) grumbles that \"management's fucking with perfectly good equipment again.\" Another man (identified as Rafael Sharp) agrees, stating that Olney management \"can't leave well enough alone.\"\n\nThe workers display discomfort with the new equipment, but the overall production rate remains within normal boundaries.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 05/09/1997\n\n**SPAN:** 13:44:31 - 14:28:57 EST\n\n----\n\nAn administrative assistant (identified as Mateo Lozano) is sitting in an office and speaking on the phone. Though only his half of the conversation is audible, it is clear that the conversation is regarding delayed shipments of iron ore. He seems to be mildly harried.\n\nAt **[13:56:39]**, the call ends. Lozano turns to the computer at his desk and opens its email client. His inbox appears to have 19 unread messages. However, all text within the client is in an unknown language. Lozano rubs his face with his hands and mutters \"not again.\"\n\nAt **[14:06:21]**, a woman (identity unknown) steps into the office's threshold. Her facial features are rendered indistinct by a faint haze of indeterminate origin. Lozano and the woman have a brief conversation; its contents are unclear, as her speech has been made unintelligible by audio distortion. Lozano's half of the conversation is primarily affirmative responses to what presumably are questions and/or commands.\n\nShortly after the woman leaves at **[14:11:51]**, Lozano leans his elbows on the desk and sinks his face into his hands. He does not move from this position for the remainder of excerpted footage.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Lozano did not return to work for three days after this event, citing illness.[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n= [[size 150%]]**ADDENDUM 744-002: INCIDENT 744-LOZANO**[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 05/14/1997\n\n**SPAN:** 09:03:22 - 09:51:05 EST\n\n----\n\n= {{[BEGIN LOG]}}\n\n//[Lozano enters the private office of SCP-744's production manager, Joel Newman (provisionally designated SCP-744-1).

You don't got perspective.\n\n**Lozano:** ...What?\n\n**Newman:** Nothin' to be ashamed of. Most people don't. Y'see, your problem is you don't have the big picture. The grand purpose of this whole enterprise.

The following transcript is a log of all notable events during this period.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 09/18/2017\n\n**SPAN:** 11:04:36 - 11:52:04 EST\n\n----\n\n**11:04 |** SCP-744's production manager, Mateo Lozano, is sitting in his private office. He receives an email notification.\n\n**11:05 |** A woman with indistinct facial features is glimpsed passing by the threshold of the employee breakroom.\n\n**11:08 |** A man (identified as Josh Hahn), begins pouring molten metal into a mold. The metal phases through the mold and the floor, disappearing from sight. He appears exasperated.\n\n**11:09 |** Inside the breakroom, a man (identified as Josiah Lewis) is gossiping with a woman (identified as Shannon Garza) during their lunch break. Partway through their conversation, Lewis begins speaking in an unknown language, to his own visible confusion and distress.\n\n**11:11 |** Lozano opens his newly-received email, exposing himself to the cognitohazard within. He convulses in his seat, then slumps forward onto his desk, unconscious.\n\n**11:15 |** SCP-744 is partially obscured from the view of external surveillance cameras. The object or objects obscuring it are not seen.\n\n**11:27 |** 14 men and woman throughout the building simultaneously receive cognitohazardous phone calls. The 8 that answer their phones convulse and become unconscious.\n\n**11:28 |** Ester Rojas, having witnessed 3 people collapse at the same time, immediately contacts emergency services.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]No record exists of emergency vehicles being dispatched to SCP-744 during this period.[[/span]] She orders Hahn to SCP-744's entrance to direct EMTs towards the victims when they arrive.\n\n**11:30 |** Hahn sprints through the hallway connecting the work floor to SCP-744's entranceway. A woman with indistinct facial features is briefly visible through an ajar door that he passes by.\n\n**11:31 |** All of SCP-744's exits demanifest.\n\n**11:38 |** 29-41 people begin speaking in an unknown language, causing the amount of panic and confusion within SCP-744 to increase considerably.\n\n**11:43 |** Garza is straining to hold on to Lewis, who is slowly phasing through the floor. Lewis has started to sob.\n\n**11:49 |** An unidentified voice begins speaking over the intercom system. All conscious individuals within SCP-744 begin to convulse.\n\n**11:51 |** A woman with indistinct facial features is seen within an active industrial furnace.\n\n**11:52 |** All internal surveillance cameras within SCP-744 cease functioning. External surveillance cameras' view of SCP-744 become fully obstructed.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-744 appears to have fully dissociated from surrounding reality shortly after the conclusion of Incident 744-Exodus. Subsequent investigation revealed that it was still physically present, but had become inaccessible and obscured from sight.\n\nAfter an unknown length of time had passed, the camera in Lozano's office partially regained functionality, recording audio but not video.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= {{[BEGIN LOG]}}\n\n//[Lozano does not speak for the first 10 minutes and 25 seconds of audio, though his labored breathing is audible throughout. When he does speak, his voice is raspy and strained.]//\n\n**Lozano:** There... there has to be a reason. A plan.\n\n**Lozano:** Everything Olney does, it does for a greater purpose. I haven't figured it out--don't even see the shape of it. But that's okay. There are some things I'll never understand.\n\n**Lozano:** I just need to know it's //there//.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Lozano:** More than twenty years, I've given this place. I've given it my time and... and my //health//, and my...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Lozano:** I've given so many things to Olney. Seen so many...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Lozano:** I've kept my faith, despite it all. Because I knew. I knew it had a //purpose//.\n\n**Lozano:** They wouldn't just leave us here. Leave //me// here. I kept my faith. They know that, don't they?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Lozano:** Don't they?\n\n= {{[END LOG]}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 02/09/2018 at 14:28 EST, SCP-744's dissociation from reality ceased. No trace of any of the 83 Olney employees inside could be found.\n\nIt has since been discovered that SCP-744's dissociation coincided with the mass layoff of all Olney employees in the Eastern United States. Its return to consensus reality likewise coincided with Olney Ironworks' declaration of bankruptcy.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n----\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-743]]] | SCP-744 | [[[SCP-745]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Factory.png\n> **Name:** Factory\n> **Author:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/decafinata/ | Thomas Berg]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/decafinata/1989725289/ | Flickr]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
