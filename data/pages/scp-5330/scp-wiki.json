Testing on SCP-5330 is forbidden.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5330 is a small, engraved metal box, secured with a latch and displaying signs of slight oxidation. The material composing SCP-5330 is impermeable to physical force and radiation-opaque, and its latch cannot be released. This has rendered its contents impossible to ascertain. \n\nIf SCP-5330 enters the potential visual field of a human (regardless of ambient light levels), they will become subject to a series of miniaturized detonations located within their cranium. These detonations originate in the cerebellum and move outwards, invariably resulting in severe cranial damage, brain hemorrhage and subsequent expiry within 5-10 seconds of initial observation. This effect does not extend to photographs or recordings of SCP-5330.\n\n**Supplemental Material - Incident 5330-030920:** On 03-09-2020, severe seismic activity in the vicinity of Site-8 caused a total power failure and subsequent site evacuation and lockdown, during which a significant number of dangerous SCP objects breached containment. Additionally, numerous storage lockers were compromised, including that of SCP-5330, and their contents were scattered across the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing. \n\nAssistant Researcher Marcus Cromwell was unable to evacuate and was trapped inside the High-Security Anomalous Items Storage wing, which was rendered inaccessible by multiple automatically sealing bulkheads; he was not located for over a week, as the wing could not be breached.\n\nAppended below are several audio logs recorded by Cromwell on an emergency terminal over the first 48 hours following Incident 5330-030920.\n@@ @@\n> **<BEGIN LOG>**\n> \n> //(Rustling fabric and a metallic click, followed by heavy, panicked breathing, are audible.)//\n> \n> **Cromwell:** Hello?

It’s pitch-black, and... and a lot of the lockers are broken, and the stuff inside them fell out. All of the lockers, actually. They're all broken. I saw all the doors coming off when the quake hit.\n> \n> **Cromwell:** And, yeah, that means 5330 is... out in the open. Somewhere in here. Don’t know where.

Must be a side effect from one of the skips that breached or something, because this is just weird.\n> \n> **Cromwell:** But, yeah, I can't even tell how big the room is. I genuinely can't see shit except the blinking green light on this thing. I think I can use the light to establish a baseline of measurement, though.

Useless for this specific terminal, but if I can severely overcharge them with the reserve power, I might be able to create a makeshift bomb and blast my way through the wall.\n> \n> //(Cromwell sighs.
