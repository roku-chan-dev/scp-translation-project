Before you all vote me out, I'd just like to say that, no matter how terrible this experience has been, I'm really glad I met all of you. I mean that. I know you have to vote for someone, and I know that I haven't been the greatest person to be stuck on a merry-go-round with—\n> \n> **Hughes:** Craig.\n> \n> **Dalton:** Yeah?\n> \n> **Hughes:** I'm voting for Shelley.\n> \n> **Long:** Luke! Really?\n> \n> **Ashcombe:** Fine by me. Bitch. \n> \n> **Simmons:** Hey, Ash-hole. Shut up. Luke, why are you voting for Shelley?\n> \n> **Hughes:** This whole thing is a game, right? One big, sadistic game. But it's so //long//. We spend most of our time watching TV. Yeah, being trapped on a carousel was hellishly uncomfortable for the first couple of decades, but we've basically gotten used to it by now. \n> \n> **Kirkwood:** Speak for yourself.\n> \n> **Hughes:** Obviously it's not //great//, but it's gotten easier with time. \n> \n> **Long:** Sorry, but what's this got to do with me?\n> \n> **Hughes:** I've been watching you. Granted, I've been watching //all// of you, but you're different, Shelley. You're not just bored. You're waiting for something, aren't you?\n> \n> **Simmons:** Wait, you're basing this whole speech on a hunch?\n> \n> **Hughes:** Come on. I'm sure you guys have felt it from her, too. There's something 'off' about her whole demeanor. She's more impatient than scared. She's gotten more and more detached as the game's gone on. She's bored with her own game.\n> \n> **Simmons:** She's depressed.\n> \n> **Kirkwood:** We're //all// depressed.\n> \n> **Long:** Look, if you're going to vote for me, just vote for me. I don't want to hear all this. Just end it, please.\n> \n> [11 seconds of silence.]\n> \n> **Dalton:** Okay, good enough for me. I vote Shelley.\n> \n> **Simmons:** I vote Hughes.\n> \n> **Ashcombe:** (//Gesturing toward Dalton//) The fairy.\n> \n> **Dalton:** Shelley. Sorry. \n> \n> **Kirkwood:** I vote Jesus.\n> \n> **Long:** Hmm. I guess it doesn't matter who I vote for, does it?\n> \n> **Hughes:** Looks like it.\n> \n> **Long:** Well, that settles it. Thank God. \n> \n> **Dalton:** Wait—\n> \n> **Long:** You know, it was fun at first, but it's really gone on far too long.\n> \n> **Simmons:** Holy shit. No way.\n> \n> **Long:** Thank you all for being my test group. I daresay things are going to be different the next time around.\n> \n> **[End Log]**\n\n**Afterword:** Following this, 3306-POI-33 vanished and SCP-3306 ceased all anomalous activity. The five remaining 3306-POI subjects were placed under quarantine. Initial observation has shown that subjects appear to have regained normal biological functions.\n\nSeveral days later, a new instance of SCP-3306 carrying 25 new persons of interest was discovered in the Far Northern Rockies. Updates to SCP-3306's documentation are underway.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[!--\nThat's how it could have happened. \n--]",
