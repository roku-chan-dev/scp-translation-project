Its extensive amenities were meant to serve as an escape vehicle, a safe haven, and -- most importantly -- the gold standard of luxury travel experiences.\n\nBronze-Tier boarding passes start at just $40,000,000,000. For more information and a free quote, please consult __our website__.\n\nRemember: //If the end is nigh, then the magic is just beginning.™//\n\n[[size 75%]]**NOTE:** If you have received this after inquiring about the Osiris Express rather than the Elysium Express, please be advised that the Osiris Express has been permanently discontinued due to premature activation and sanitation problems. Boarding passes for both Osiris and Elysium Expresses are non-refundable.[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-8201\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The only realistic means to contain SCP-8201 is mitigate the spread of information following Boarding Events. To that end, Foundation webcrawlers and agents continue to monitor all North American passenger and commuter rail systems for Boarding Events. After a Boarding Event has been confirmed, local task forces are to be deployed to detain all resulting SCP-8201-B.\n\nVapor-based dispersal units containing Class A amnestics have currently been installed in 408 train stations throughout North America, with 100 slated to be installed next year. These dispersal units are to be remotely activated during a confirmed Boarding Event.\n\nVisual records of SCP-8201-A contain an ALPTRAUM-class cognitohazard and must be destroyed through automated systems.\n\nSCP-8201-B are to be apprehended and kept at the humanoid containment wing of Site-59. This is primarily to monitor and study ways to mitigate SCP-8201's influence -- and, if possible, to rehabilitate them through the use of amnestic therapy. While they have no anomalous capabilities, SCP-8201-B remain under constant suicide watch. \n\nAll staff are advised that \"OsEx\"[[footnote]](Short for Osiris Express)[[/footnote]] communities on the Internet are //not// entirely composed of uncontained SCP-8201-B, with approximately 70% of relevant persons of interest being non-anomalous conspiracy theorists. Their activities are to be monitored closely, as this remains the most accurate means to predict Boarding Events.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8201 is an armored, 30-car passenger train. The words \"OSIRIS EXPRESS\" have been painted on every car, often paired with an emblem of the eponymous Egyptian god. SCP-8201 is pulled by an engine that takes the appearance of a steam locomotive of the 4-8-4 \"Northern\" wheel arrangement. [[footnote]](General consensus among SCP-8201-B is not steam-powered, but driven by a nuclear reactor. The appearance of the engine is purely aesthetic.)[[/footnote]]\n\nThe only entrance is a single bulkhead at the end of the rearmost car. When opened, this bulkhead is guarded by between 20 to 30 instances of SCP-8201-A.\n\nSCP-8201 has never been observed in motion, save for pulling in and out of stations to board passengers. All attempts to accurately track SCP-8201's movement after departure have been unsuccessful. The most accepted explanation for this is that SCP-8201 is capable of either teleportation or cross-dimensional travel.\n\nSince June 1st, 2017, SCP-8201 has stopped at 195 different train stations throughout Canada and the continental United States. (No appearances outside of North America have been documented as of yet.) These have been designated Boarding Events.\n\nSCP-8201-A refers to the staff of SCP-8201. Visual contact with an SCP-8201-A instance constitutes an ALPTRAUM-class cognitohazard -- as such, the only details of their appearance come from what has been gleaned from questioning SCP-8201-B:\n\n* They take the appearance of male humanoids aged 25-35.\n* They're dressed in body armor that mimics the appearance of a railway conductor's uniform.\n* Some are equipped with tranquilizer dart pistols, while others have riot shields and stun batons.\n\nNo SCP-8201-A speak, save for SCP-8201-A-1, their apparent commander.\n\nSCP-8201-B refers to a human subject that has made either direct, indirect, or //de facto//[[footnote]](i.e. recordings and photographs)[[/footnote]] observation of SCP-8201-A. Immediately upon observation, the subject develops an intense compulsion to board SCP-8201, seeing it as their only means to survive an impending global catastrophe. (The details of this catastrophe continue to remain unclear, especially to SCP-8201-B.) \n\nTo a limited degree, SCP-8201-B are able to predict Boarding Events.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Boarding Event Transcript:**\n\n> **Incident Log: Boarding Event-102**\n> **Date:** 3/20/2024\n> **Time:** 01:48 AM CST\n> **Location:** St. Cloud Station, St. Cloud, Minnesota\n> **Note:** The following was taken from video footage from the phone of Woody Morgan, an railway history blogger on YouTube. \n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //[SCP-8201 can be seen approaching from the north.

A serial number was discovered on a passenger car's wheels, which was traced back to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/marshall-carter-and-dark-hub Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Ltd]. When questioned, a representative of the company stated that SCP-8201 was their discontinued project that had activated prematurely. (See above.)\n\nAfter a brief investigation, an outdated boarding pass for SCP-8201 was found in the personal effects of PoI-81111 (a Marshall, Carter, and Dark agent).\n\nResearcher Gina Gualtieri volunteered to use this boarding pass to attempt to board and explore the interior of SCP-8201. Gualtieri was given a hidden audio wire to record her findings.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n\n++++ Exploration Log: SCP-8201\n++++ Start date: 8/20/2024\n++++ Start Time: 10:18 PM EST\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n<10:18> SCP-8201 pulls into the station at Kingstree, South Carolina.\n\n<10:19> Gualtieri views SCP-8201-A and becomes an instance of SCP-8201-B. After displaying the boarding pass, she successfully boards the train. She hurries to the other side of the entry car to decompress.\n\n<10:23> SCP-8201 departs Kingstree. Gualtieri is the only one who has successfully boarded the train.[[footnote]](A successfully audited passenger total of 0 makes up for 38.4% of recorded Boarding Events.)[[/footnote]]\n\n<10:29> Gualtieri begins recording.\n\n> //[Heavy breathing, gradually growing slower.]//\n> \n> **Gualtieri:** ...okay. I'm on the train. That was one hell of a panic attack.

They're standing in place near the bulkhead. In fact, they're standing single-file. Really stiff and motionless. //Too// stiff. Like they're T-posing in a video game.
