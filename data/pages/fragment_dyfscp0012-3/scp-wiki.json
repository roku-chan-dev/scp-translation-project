Blue: land used as a disposal area by ORANGE-B. \n]]\n**Item #:** SCP-001-##orange|**ORANGE**##\n\n**Object Class:** Apollyon\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** As of 3/20/2079, ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## has been sealed from within, and all remaining Foundation Staff and facilities are self-sufficient until further notice. There will be no further contact with ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## unless it opens from within.\n\nFollowing the sealing of ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**##, the object class of every contained item that would impede the progress of Project ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## has been updated to Kušum. All remaining anomalies have been retroactively approved to defend ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## and other surviving humans[[footnote]] (In that order of priority) [[/footnote]] against the forces of ##orange|**ORANGE**##.\n\nAll remaining staff are reassured of the following truths:\n* O5-1, -2, -4, -10, -11, and -12 are alive and in good condition at ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**##. \n* The central disposal area in Antarctica is surprisingly unguarded and is an excellent source for salvage.\n* ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B are mortal, capable of feeling pain, and could hypothetically be destroyed through sustained heavy-caliber gunfire.\n* On a more personal note, //nobody// in ##D8CB00|**YELLOW**## is there because they are more deserving of protection or superior to you in any way; this was merely done to preserve existing command structures.\n* You are __self-sufficient__, //not// alone.\n* **We will endure.**\n\n**Description:** ##orange|**ORANGE**## is an umbrella designation referring to all phenomena associated with an ongoing SK-class dominance shift that began with ##orange|**ORANGE**##-A.\n\n##orange|**ORANGE**##-A was a two-hour period on 4/29/2078 during which 48.52% of the Earth's habitable surface area (primarily urban centers) dematerialized and rematerialized 0.5 kilometers above the South Pole. \n\nWhile inorganic matter reappeared in Antarctica mostly intact, multicellular organisms cannot experience this transposal without the bonds between every cell being instantaneously broken, resulting in liquefaction. As such, ##orange|**ORANGE**##-A has resulted in the deaths of at least 6.9 billion humans and an incalculable amount of wildlife.\n\n##orange|**ORANGE**##-B refers to the instigators of the ##orange|**ORANGE**##-A event. \n ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B are intelligent extradimensional life forms that vary in appearance, but all share the following common traits:\n\n* A minimum height of three meters.\n* A layer of exoskeletal carapace covering their skin.\n* A segmented body composed of a head, primary thorax, secondary thorax, tertiary thoracic cloister, abdomen, and tail.\n* Sixteen legs, all but four of which are used for walking.\n* A hard, segmented shell over the backside, similar to that of an isopod of the order Oniscidea[[footnote]] (Better known as the woodlouse.) [[/footnote]]\n* No apparent sensory organs or orifices, save for a single radula on the lower part of the head, which is lined with prehensile teeth.[[footnote]] (It is unknown if or what ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B eats; feeding has never been observed.) [[/footnote]]\n\nThe main differentiating factor between instances of ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B is the presence of various sessile flora on top of their segmented shells. All attempts to take samples of these plants from ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B have failed. \n\nIt is currently hypothesized that these are gardens as a form of personal fashion, and that the size and content of individual gardens is used among ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B to differentiate ranking or caste within their community. The instance with the largest observed garden appears to be their leader; it has since been classified ##orange|**ORANGE**##-PRIME. \n\nThe primary anomalous ability displayed by ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B is their ability to switch the positions of two different locations on Earth of equal size. These have come to be known as \"juxtaposition events.\" \n\nThe range and mechanics of this ability are unknown, but ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B have been seen raising their four forelegs and moaning harmonically before juxtaposition events. Larger juxtaposition events have been accompanied by several ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B doing this at the same time. \n\nThe only organic matter that can survive a juxtaposition event are ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B instances and their shells' decorative flora. \n\nIt is also worth note that ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B have expressed reluctance to juxtapose areas with a high density of plant life.\n\nIt is currently believed that ##orange|**ORANGE**##-A was caused by at least ████████████ ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B working in unison. \n\nAdditionally, ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B refer to themselves as the \"WEASELS?!\" and are capable of indirect human speech through spliced video footage if they are provided with a device that has an internet connection, as seen here:\n\n> **Interview Log - First contact with ##orange|ORANGE##-B before the ##orange|ORANGE##-A event**\n> **4/29/2078, 1405 local time (GMT + 4)**\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //(Harlan Stump, Site-59's chief groundskeeper, rides his lawnmower on the eastern edge of the Site-59 courtyard.

He stares at the ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B for approximately 13 seconds.)//\n> \n> **Stump:** Hmm.\n> \n> //(He continues mowing.)//\n> \n> //(##orange|**ORANGE**##-PRIME raises a hand. Stump's smartphone floats into its hand.)//\n> \n> **Stump:** Uh... okay?\n> \n> //(The phone's screen suddenly flickers with intense light.

Ever since, ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B has been on a campaign to colonize and terraform the planet Earth as well as exterminate the remaining native fauna through juxtaposition events.\n\nThe Foundation subsequently classified ##orange|**ORANGE**## as Tiamat and authorized its neutralization or mitigation by any means necessary.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Tactics/Behavior:**\n\n> **Personal log - Corporal Alexis Hale, MTF Nu-7 \"Hammer Down\"**\n> **Excerpt from 8/20/78**\n> \n> //...I've spent the past two months painting the backsides of these bonsai crabs for airstrikes, and I still feel like I don't understand the first thing about them.//\n> \n> //They're always hunched over. Their bodies have way more points of articulation than we thought, but we never discovered that until we finally killed one of them after two weeks and saw its corpse splay out across the ground. It gives them the impression of little Benedictine monks watering the plants outside their monastery.//\n> \n> //But what disturbs me the most is how they fight back: they **don't.** And we're **still** losing. There's no ferocity when they kill us, no anger, no malice.//\n> \n> //Yesterday, my platoon was up in what used to be the Himalayas. It was now this vast, sprawling marsh of pink ferns that leaned away from us as we waded through. The sounds of all the new alien animals they introduced... low-pitched warbling. One was like if you gave a shrieking mouse an amp and a reverb pedal. It was too easy to lose yourself in the serenity and forget that your species was currently being eradicated...//\n> \n> //I digress. Recon said that PRIME was in the area. If he was, he must have juxtaposed somewhere else just as he sensed our presence.//\n> \n> //When we first spotted the crabs, half were busy teleporting some giant mushrooms into the swamp and the other half were relaxing under the shade of said mushrooms.//\n> \n> //We started shooting, and they didn't budge. They didn't even acknowledge us. They only did something different once some of the ferns caught fire from an RPG. Without too great of a sense of urgency, they splashed the marsh water over the fires.//\n> \n> //There must have been 30 straight minutes of sustained fire on our end. Granted, a few of the crabs keeled over, but they didn't even cry out in pain. I don't think they can feel pain, not in the way we do -- and even if they can, they don't care at all about self-preservation.//\n> \n> //Once we ran out of ammo, that's when the juxtapositions started. I faked my own suicide on a gamble -- and that's why I was the only one who made it out. Maybe they thought my body would make good fertilizer. Maybe they just didn't care enough to bother with killing us all.//\n> \n> //In my professional opinion, I don't think this is a war to them. They're just chillin' out, working on their planet-sized garden. Our whole species is being murdered, and they treat it like a low-energy hobby.//\n> \n> //And it makes me want to vomit that I'm even saying this, but... it's honestly kinda cute.//\n\n**Addendum 2 - Incident ##orange|ORANGE##-Omega:**\n\nOn 10/28/2078, acting against pre-established agreements with the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition launched the Project POP-GO[[footnote]] (A 200 megaton nuclear ICBM enhanced through anomalous means) [[/footnote]] toward Point-94, the most densely populated ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B colony in central India. \n\nAt 14:50 GMT, Once POP-GO reached low orbit to begin its descent, the entirety of earth's sky changed color to dark, solid blue. All satellite communications completely ceased function, and the GOC lost contact with POP-GO. Additionally, all astral bodies, including the sun and moon, were no longer visible.\n\nInvestigation via unmanned probe was impossible due to the satellite blackout. Two days later, the Foundation space shuttle //Faraon// was launched from Provisional Antarctic Site-01 with a crew of five astronauts to POP-GO's last known location. Contact with the //Faraon// was lost nine minutes after launch.\n\n> **Final audio transmission from the SCPS //Faraon//**\n> \n> <Begin Log> \n> \n> **Ground Control:** T-minus 70 seconds to breaching orbit --\n> \n> **Capt. Hauer:** To //impact.//\n> \n> **Ground Control:** Requesting clarification.\n> \n> **Hauer:** Radar's picking up this blue sky as a solid wall. We're about to crash.\n> \n> **Ground Control:** What the -- abort mission. Turn off the engines.\n> \n> **Hauer:** With all due respect, the crew and I have been talking, and our choice is currently between dying in an explosion and dying as soup in a garbage heap. The former sounds more attractive.\n> \n> **Lt. Cotswold:** Permission to speak.\n> \n> **Hauer:** Granted.\n> \n> **Cotswold:** If we somehow break through and survive, we can give you more answers.\n> \n> **Ground Control:** T-minus 18. //Abort.//\n> \n> **Hauer:** It has been an honor.\n> \n> **Chief Engineer Stanislas:** Fifteen... fourteen...\n> \n> **Science Officer Albers:** (singing) //Neeeearer, my Gooood, to theeeeee...//\n> \n> **Stanislas:** //Ten!

As for damage, the wings are bending, the nose cone is concave, and the boosters --\n> \n> //(An alarm suddenly sounds from Stanislas's console.)//\n> \n> **Stanislas:** The boosters can't keep up this strain. They're about to go nuclear. Jettison?\n> \n> **Albers:** Can we maybe not drop them over Site-01? That's where //people// are.\n> \n> **Ground Control:** All right, listen. I'm going to need you to cut off the main thrusters -- but keep the boosters running. Detach and jettison. Let them explode. Freefall until you're at a safe distance to deploy the chutes. Understood?\n> \n> **Cotswold:** Received and understood! Just let me hit the --\n> \n> **Hauer:** Keep going.\n> \n> **Cotswold:** Captain?\n> \n> **Hauer:** I'm starting to see something above us. It's getting translucent. \n> \n> **Cotswold:** Uh --\n> \n> **Hauer:** You're not the only one who wants answers!\n> \n> **Ground Control:** Hauer, your orders are to --\n> \n> **Hauer:** //Keep going!//\n> \n> **Albers:** (Singing while sobbing) //STILLL ALLL MY SOOOOONG SHALL BEEEE, NEEEEARER MY GOOOOOD TO THEEE...//\n> \n> //(Whack.)//\n> \n> //Dooon't throw your shoooe at meeee...//\n> \n> **Hauer:** I can almost see it!\n> \n> **Ground Control:** Hauer! //Hauer!//\n> \n> **Hauer:** (Berserk yelling.)\n> \n> //(SPLASH!)//\n> \n> //(All alarms stop.)//\n> \n> //(The next 37 seconds are comprised of a series of sounds muffled by the shuttle's hull: rushing wind, several echoing cries reminiscent of whale songs, thunder, and constant, low-frequency humming.)//\n> \n> **Hauer:** ...huh.\n> \n>  **Ground Control:** You're alive? Look, we can discuss disciplinary proceedings later, but -- status report?\n> \n> **Hauer:** This is not space.\n> \n> **Ground Control:** Pardon?\n> \n> **Hauer:** There's sound. Atmosphere.
