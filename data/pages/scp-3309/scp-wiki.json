After the containment of an instance, all personnel assigned to the affected anomaly must undergo amnestic treatment and transfer to unrelated projects.\n----\n**Description:** SCP-3309 is a phenomenon in which catalogued anomalies spontaneously disappear. Items affected by SCP-3309 have included anomalous objects, entities, locations, and conceptual structures. Anomalies affected by this phenomenon appear to lack a causal relation; SCP-3309 activity is indicated by a note of unknown origin (designated **SCP-3309-1**).\n\nBetween 24 and 36 hours before the disappearance of an anomaly, SCP-3309-1 appears appended to the item's file. Documents undergoing SCP-3309 become wiped from all known file systems, including Protected Site-01 and RAISA Archives. Afterward, the anomaly itself becomes effectively neutralized or otherwise disappears.\n\nThe contents of SCP-3309-1 are as follows:\n\n> //If you are not the author and you want to rewrite this article, you may reply to this post asking for the opportunity to do so. Please obtain permission from the author.//\n\nSCP-3309 affects backups created for disappearing documents. SCP-3309 also affects the documents of anomalous items encountering SCP-3309; about 71% of disappearing documents are connected to other, unaffected anomalies. This leads to a weakening in the Foundation's anomaly containment network, potentially escalating to an ADK-Class “Complete Anomalous Destabilization” Scenario.\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n= **I.

The long circle is nearly complete.\"]]\nSince its prime emergence, SCP-3309 has affected an average of 40 anomalies per month. Researchers assigned to SCP-3309 have identified an emerging pattern and developed a list of criteria:\n\n* Affected items are documented as having been contained with excessive containment procedures, such as chambers constructed from heavy-duty titanium alloy. This indicates either a misunderstanding of the anomaly's nature or an unprofessional level of care taken to contain it.\n* The affected item itself is powerful enough to threaten a K-Class “End-of-the-World” Scenario. Documentation outlines only partial consequences of the anomaly, and any Provisional Containment Procedures typically align with that of the first criteria.\n* The affected item's documentation -- including any added supplements -- is poorly written, improperly formatted, or filled with logical and grammatical errors.\n\nBased on these observations, the containment team has proposed Project: TAPERED SPEAR. TAPERED SPEAR outlines the adaptation of these criteria for use against high-risk anomalies to neutralize them. As this contravenes the Foundation's mission, an [[[ethics-committee-orientation|Ethics Committee]]] special tribunal has contested the execution of TAPERED SPEAR.\n\nThe results of this tribunal are as follows:\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n+++ PROJECT: TAPERED SPEAR\n++++* __TRIBUNAL RESULTS__\n----\n**FOR:**[[span class=\"rev-green\"]] 21 [[/span]]\n**AGAINST:**[[span class=\"rev-red\"]] 20 [[/span]]\n**ABSTAIN:**[[span class=\"rev-blue\"]] 2 [[/span]]\n\n**OUTCOME:** TAPERED SPEAR is authorized.

Attached is an experimentation log, the results of which will determine a final decision.\n\n[[div class=\"report-box justified\"]]\n+++ PROPOSAL EXCERPT\n----\n**PROPOSAL:** Use SCP-3309 to neutralize [[[SCP-4463]]]: A complex water-based spatial anomaly capable of flooding North America within 50 years.\n----\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-4463 is a water-based anomaly affecting parts of the Chihuahuan Desert in the state of Arizona. SCP-4463 describes the gradual transformation of a substantial area of the desert into an equal area of wetlands.\n\nSince the 1990s, desertification of southeastern Arizona has occurred at a rate of 2 km^^2^^ per month. This desertification increased at a rate of 0.5% per year until 2008, when 1 200 km^^2^^ of previously arable land had been rendered incapable of bearing healthy vegetation. In response, the government of Arizona considered this phenomenon an ecological disaster and enacted plans to reverse the spread of desertification. This occurred as a response to mass protests by members of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in the neighbouring Tucson region beginning in November 2006.\n\nIn August 2008, 60% of desiccated topsoil per square metre began transformation into water by an unknown anomalous effect. At present, 45% of the previously desertified area has transformed into wetlands, preventing any native animal or human development in this territory.\n----\n**FURTHER ACTIONS TAKEN:** [[[scp-4463-j|SCP-4463's file was updated to contain heavy grammatical errors and significant inconsistencies among related effects of the anomaly]]]. Various fabricated addenda and an unrelated image depicting a large ocean wave were also added.\n----\n**RESULT:** SCP-4463 was erased from all Foundation databases within a 28-hour period. After further research and observation into the former location of SCP-4463, its risk had been nullified, and the area again became desertified.\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter continued debate and experimentation involving 19 different anomalies, SCP-3309 has passed the second stage of voting within the Ethics Committee special tribunal. SCP-3309 has been additionally classified as Thaumiel and authorized for use in TAPERED SPEAR. The first round of post-reclassification research involving 49 anomalies is under way.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ RESEARCHER NOTE\n----\nI don't understand how one round of testing could burden a man like this. I think I saw my first white hair this morning -- or an entire patch of white hairs?\n\nFading to dust -- how does that feel? Would it burden my senses the way an illness might? Or might it leave me numb? I think, if I had to go out, I would want to continue feeling, even into my final moment. To know I'm still here, as everything else fades away.\n\nThere's something wrong.\n\nI've locked myself in my office. I'm going numb. This isn't what I would have wanted. But the end doesn't much care about one man's wants and needs, does it? There is nothing, nothing.\n\nDid we ever find out where those neutralized anomalies went? Surely it can't be so straightforward, to do what we did -- to see //justice// without repercussions. That's unlike us. But it feels like everyone, everyone except me, forgot what happened.\n\nIs it that simple? Have we simply //forgotten//?\n\nI don't want to be [[span style=\"color: hsl(0, 0%, 96%)\"]]forgotten[[/span]].\n----\n[[>]]\n--Researcher Adamo Smalls\n//Memetics and Infohazards Division//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n@@ @@\n= **III.

This place — if it is a place — is devoid of, well. Things. There's nothing here. Something has gone wrong.</p>\n\n                  <p>Let me go back.</p>\n\n                  <p>My name is Adamo Smalls. I was born on August 21st, 1988, to Katherine and Charles Smalls in Portland, Oregon. I studied at the University of Oregon and have an MA in Information Science. The Foundation employed me in late 2010 as a memeticist. I hold a cognitive resistance value in the 99th percentile.</p>\n\n                  <p>I was on a long-term assignment at Site-82 to research SCP-3309 and–</p>\n\n                  <p>... That's it? No–</p>\n\n                  <p>3309 is a strong memetic construct associated with a few key Foundation variables. It neutralized anomalies and the articles we compiled to explain them. It supported the Veil, but we were fools to believe we could play with the universe like that. It isn't our right.</p>\n\n                  <p>But surely the universe plays with us every day? No, why separate us from the world around us? We are that world. And we played ourselves.</p>\n\n                  <p>I don't recall exactly what happened, and I figure my memetic retainment is still not high enough to let me completely understand. But 3309 started erasing things. Systematically. It erased personnel, then entire task forces. Sites. The places between them. Sections of the damn Foundation — all gone. The fundamental permeating concepts that allow us to create the Foundation. The concept of an organization? Wiped. Didn't exist.</p>\n\n                  <p>This continued until there was nothing, and I felt myself go away along with it. Everything was different after that night. When I was alone.</p>\n\n                  <p>But now I <i>am</i> alone. In here.</p>\n\n                  <p>Here? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/sandrewswann-s-proposal\">This is hell.</a></p>\n\n                  <p>No — That isn't what happened. I made it up. I must've. But–</p>\n\n                  <p>Am I one of the erased personnel?</p>\n\n                  <p>If I'm forgotten like them, what does that mean? What does any of this mean? Oh God, I don't want to be forgotten.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"options\">\n                  <strong><a href=\"javascript:;\">Reply</a></strong>\n                  <a href=\"javascript:;\">Options</a>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"options\" style=\"display: none\"></div>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"post-container\">\n              <div class=\"post\">\n                <div class=\"long\">\n                  <div class=\"head\">\n                    <div class=\"options\">\n                      <a href=\"javascript:;\">Fold</a>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                      Admin Post - Closed\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"info\">\n                      <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zyn\"><img class=\"small\" src=\"https://d2qhngyckgiutd.cloudfront.net/a27359b77b8d8b4fe61170b6d61f652d?userid=1802367&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1493035945\" alt=\"Zyn\" style=\"background-image: url('https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=1922529&onlyKarma=true')\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/zyn\">Zyn</a></span> 9 Apr 2020, 13:19\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n\n                  <div class=\"content\">\n                    <p>Researcher Smalls, please note the following:</p>\n\n                    <b>Please do not reply to this post for any other reason unless you are staff.</b>\n\n                    <p>Additionally, you have been warned already for roleplaying on the forums.
