This is WhiteGuard speaking. I was a reporter until recently, it is August now, and I have been given the role of editor of Site News. From all on the Site News team, we apologize for the delay. The change in management and everyone being busy caused delays in everything. I am however happy to announce that the July edition of the Site News will be out very soon with a brand new team, brand new sections and content, and a brand new look and format. Thank you so much for reading Site News. Hopefully starting with the July edition with our revamp of Site News we can develop something that even more people will enjoy reading!\n>\n> We will feature a lot more original content in addition to overhauling our older sections. These new ideas include some writers' opinion pieces, broader interviews, a revamped art section, and more! Additionally, if YOU, the reader, have any suggestions for things you would like to see in a monthly Site News, please feel free to contact me directly. Much of the below edition has been worked on over a number of months and so we decided to finish this one up in the old style and do a fresh start with our July edition. While you wait for the new and revamped July Site News, feel free to read and check out this final edition of the Site News with this format. Also, please give props to Elenee Fishtruck, a new member of the team, who created the editorial for this June edition!\n\n\n[[size 75%]]This is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover!

[[/size]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Editorial]]\n**From the Editorial Desk**\n\nIn 2011, an IRC chat operator kicked a user for saying \"/v/ is such a pile of insecure one-upping f*ggotry\" in conversation, and soon 24-hour banned them for fighting the decision. While the latter action received little pushback per standard policy on sarcastic attitude towards ops, the former action spurred debate on allowing slurs in #site19. No one actively promoted homophobia or other bigotry, but the common opinion excused slurs given they're \"not a harmful slur\" or \"not directed at anyone\", and \"we're [not] losing much should [someone offended by casual slur usage] leave in a huff of butthurt\".\n\nThis came to a head when a user used the same word in conversation, and the 05 thread represented a similar reaction. An admin fiat-allowed their usage, telling dissenters \"you may tender your resignation\", and a moderator cried \"CENSORSHIP IS NOT OKAY, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\". \"By attempting to protect the interests of a group of people, you are imposing your will upon another and limiting their capacity to express themselves,\" they said.\n\nThat is, expressing themselves by casually using slurs.\n\nStrength, in the internet's early days, constituted sucking up and lifting your chin at every vile thing you see. //It's the internet, after all.// One should have expected such heinous occurrences or messages, words and phrases that hurt. \"That is a damn fool thing to get offended by on the internet.\" Strength, then, represented hiding emotion, excusing vitriol under \"comedic\" or \"nonharmful\" pretenses. Attempting to change meant \"hypocrisy in the extreme\" in the face of the early internet. Clearly this is how strength will be forevermore defined.\n\n3 years later...\n\nSimilar arguments and actions emerge in another thread on slurs. Another admin attempts fiating certain actions without consulting others, stating they \"will consider [snark against their decision] the next time promotions are made\", though this admin smartly retracts their fiat once receiving such snark. Even another argument on censorship, calling it \"a slippery slope\" when deciding what to ban, and once again citing that definition of strength. \"It's the internet.\"\n\nYet this does not form the predominant voice. While still not fully modern, the consensus trails towards a brighter and more considerate future. Maybe slur usage //[https://c.tenor.com/YctxttUmGMYAAAAC/forehead-slap-slapping-forehead.gif is]// bad. The thread does not have a definitive conclusion, nor does it need one.\n\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dixieland-nightmare-magic-hub I] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-good-work think] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4175 it] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shaggydredlocks-proposal is] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-clean-a-polyester-dress clear] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/take-it-away-my-darling who] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wwydftltimd-hub won] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/jude-s-bizarre-adventure the] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/protected:scp-2721 battle].\n\nStrength changed. Strength doesn't mean blindly accepting what goes on around you because it's \"the status quo\" or \"how it always was\" or \"the internet\". Strength isn't letting old habits continue for the sake of old habits. Strength is standing against those traditions. Strength is being yourself when facing hardship. Strength is making active efforts to change the rules, do the right thing, help your fellow human. Strength is taking //pride// in what you know is moral and just. With strength, with pride, you can make a community //change//.\n\nWhile, in our internet bubble, acceptance becomes much more common, such trends do not continue elsewhere, at times regressing. Strength continues to mean repression and oppression in those spaces. Perhaps, just like the forebears in 2011 and 2014, users can take their strength past the internet, into spaces that need it, and transform definitions. The work and time it requires pays off eventually, and everyone will feel all the more prideful for it.\n\nHappy belated Pride, everyone.\n\n-----\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab News from the Fandom]]\n\nThe biggest news of June was the voting period of the [[[scp6000contesthub | SCP-6000 contest]]]!

It's the most private of all the staff teams, so I'm certain that a lot of our users would love knowing more. Do you mind giving me a brief overview of the team? What role it plays in the staff structure?\n> Alright, so, before I start I have to make it clear I can't share anything confidential, obviously.\n\nAbsolutely. I wouldn't want you to.\n> AHT, as in the name, deals with harassment issues on the wiki and related spaces. It's one of the smallest and least active teams, but when it is active it's highly important. It's got an unusual structure because whilst there's a captain, it's less traditionally tiered in the way many other teams are\n> It's small and so when we do have to deal with an incident, we all share the burden and the lot of us work together.\n\nI realize that a lot of the stuff you handle is very private, but is there anything you can point at (without revealing anything confidential, of course) that you can identify as an accomplishment?\n> One of the biggest things I'd say is an accomplishment is the recent change in how we present bans; the secrecy of the team has always been a bit of a sore point and I think we've finally struck the right balance. Plus, any time we can help make the wiki a safer place is always a bonus\n\n\"Safer place\" can be pretty subjective. How do you define it?\n> In this case, by removing predatory/harmful users. It's not the nicest thing but someone has to do it haha\n\nI know that I appreciate it, and I'm certain I'm not the only one. But, that being said, I'm sure that some of the conversations and situations can be quite stressful. How do you manage your reaction to that stress, as well as having to sift through the pretty awful things I'm sure you sometimes see?\n> I think that one comes down to the individual. Not to get into uncomfortable details, but I've dealt with quite a few tough situations through my life and I think that experience helps. It's also important the whole team works together to share the burden of it, so it's a lot less stress on any one person\n> Cases are fairly infrequent, which helps.\n\nI hear that. I've also had to face some pretty unpleasant situations, so I can relate to the benefit of having a team around you to help. Is that part of what keeps you on the team? Have you ever truly considered just resigning?\n> Honestly? Not really. I like being able to make a difference, and it's an important job that someone has to do. I've been somewhat adjacently involved in a few cases when I first joined the wiki, and it was definately not as well handled or decent as it is now; I don't want anyone to have to deal with that\n\nWe've come a long way since those \"good ol' days\", haven't we? I've found that, in retrospect, the \"good ol' days\" rarely are.\n> Yeah, it's weird looking back and realising how long I've been around here\n\nHow has being a part of AHT impacted the way you view the site? Does it impact how you approach reading site content? Not forum stuff, but the fictional side of things.\n> Not too much; I've never felt it's had an impact on site content, as it's user behaviour we deal with.\n\nThat's good to know. Speaking of site content, and this will be my last AHT question for you, has being on the team impacted your own fiction? The way you tell stories?\n> I'd say, but I don't think I've actually finished a story since joining! That's mostly been down to me finishing university this past year though, so hopefully I'll have some more published by the end of the summer\n\nCongratulations! That's quite an accomplishment, graduating university. In that vein, has being a member of staff (not just AHT) been helpful to you in your real life? We all know how real life can impact our work here, but it isn't always just one way.\n> I think so, stuff like communication and working in teams - all the stuff that looks great on a CV - but yeah. Plus, I've made friends through this, which is important.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Word from Staff]]\n\n**Staff News:**\n\n++++* __New Staffers:__\n\nThe [http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main Maintenance team] (MAST) has recruited two new junior staff.
