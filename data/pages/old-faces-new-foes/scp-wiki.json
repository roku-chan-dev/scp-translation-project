She picked it up and sat down in a chair across the desk from his own. \"Ah.

I'll never get used to those things.\"\n\n\"If we do our job right, you won't have to.\" He kicked his feet up on the desk; the coffee mug jumped dangerously at the impact. \"But if Bowe wasn't bluffing, we'll almost certainly have to deal with them at some point.\"\n\n\"This is terrific. '//Little to no response from conventional firearms//' ...so how do we deal with them?\"\n\n\"We might have a few options in that regard.

He was shouting something about \"personal goddamn space\" as they prodded him past the door.\n\nA cold French fry bounced off her forehead. \"What in fucking hell?\"\n\n\"If you're not paying attention to me, you're asking for trouble.\"\n\nCarlotta Deneb, one-time UIU tracker and profiler, was smiling at her and holding up a stack of flash cards.

Just a few more cards, and we can call it quits.\"\n\nLucretia blew out a breath. \"You gonna learn Russian?

He was, she had come to understand, just like that. \"Does anyone follow protocol around here? I issued your reassignment papers three days ago. Who, might I ask, thinks they can overrule me?\"\n\n\"Why, you, of course!\" Gat sipped from a teacup wafting an oolong aroma. He still hadn't made eye contact with her.\n\n\"Irving.

No,\" she added as he opened his mouth, \"//more// straightforward, please.\"\n\nHe took a moment to recollect his thoughts. \"Well, you're the Director of Project Resurrection -- which, after the gloriously grandiose cataclysm at Site-19, now envelops ETTRA in its organizational umbrella -- and the head of said Authority was kind enough to suggest I stay and consult a while, so long as my sworn duty to assist with Alpha-9 takes priority.\"\n\n\"Dan, you son of a...\" She shook her head again. \"Wait.

Did he say why he //needed// your consultation?\"\n\nGat turned the monitor towards her; she was unsurprised to see the SCP-093 database file. \"He claims that a nebulous and unknowable entity seems to be pulling the strings in this mysterious other world, defying the capacity of his considerable faculties to rationally comprehend.
