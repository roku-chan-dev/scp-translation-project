SCP-6599 are present across 68% of all websites that allow for account creation, though activity is centered on hobbyist message boards, with the oldest recorded instance dated to 1999. SCP-6599 accounts are somewhat knowledgeable about the topic of the website they are posting to, as well as extremely active, posting upwards of 100 times a day across all accounts in the form of responses to other users. Accounts have been observed to post contemporaneously with one another, though typing pattern analysis, coupled with SCP-6599's anomalous effects, indicates that the likelihood of SCP-6599 being multiple individuals or an organized effort is remarkably low.\n\nSCP-6599 accounts are English-speaking, and communicate in a hostile, argumentative pattern consistent across all instances, insulting users and making boastful statements about themselves. This behavior often prompts action by site moderators, who will most likely implement a ban on the account. To date, there have been no recorded instances of an SCP-6599 account attempting to circumvent a ban.\n\nIf an individual engages an SCP-6599 account in a combative way, such as insulting the instance or provoking a response from SCP-6599, an ALT-F4 Event is likely to occur. These events result in a hostile entity, designated SCP-6599-1, manifesting near the individual's present location a short time after the argument. Analysis of SCP-6599 activity has determined only 40% of engagements result in the appearance of SCP-6599-1.\n\nSCP-6599-1 is a humanoid entity resembling professional wrestler Scott Rechsteiner[[footnote]]Known under the ring name 'Scott Steiner'[[/footnote]].  SCP-6599-1 is sapient, sentient, with an estimated intelligence similar to that of an average adult human, and anomalously enhanced strength and durability. After manifesting, SCP-6599-1 will locate the individual it had engaged in an argument with online, and proceed to verbally berate and physically batter them to the point of hospitalization. SCP-6599-1 will then demanifest from its target's location. While no fatalities have resulted from an ALT-F4 event, SCP-6599-1 frequently causes damage to the surrounding area during its assault.\n\n**Addendum.6599.1:** Discovery\n\nSCP-6599 was discovered on March 28th, 2008 on Parawatch.net.\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #262626; padding: 0.5em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##3f6cb5|**GregTheCarp**## 03/28/2008 (Mon) 16:54:32 #74439151\n------\n\nFavorite Cryptid thread?\n\nBig fan of the Squonk personally.

A police report that was filed by Kaplin described a humanoid entity that appeared, attacked him, and disappeared from his home. WALDO.aic's anomaly detection software was triggered and then prompted Foundation investigation.

Entity brandished a banjo and delivered a rendition of \"Rainbow Connection\" with lyrics lampooning Henson and the Muppets, while assaulting White with the object to the point of unconsciousness.

Nakatosa resident Seo Hirotada reported SCP-6599-1 entering his residence via emerging from underneath the floorboards, despite the home being built on flat ground. Entity assaulted Hirotada with punching gloves, repeatedly asking if the victim had ever seen \"Rocky\". When the victim fell to the floor, SCP-6599-1 unlocked multiple cages containing exotic insects, and poured them atop Hirotada's body. SCP-6599-1 leapt in the air, and drove its elbow into his chest. SCP-6599-1 demanifested, and Seo contacted law enforcement and was later admitted to a hospital with a shattered rib cage. Standard Foundation Veil retention protocol followed.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum.6599.3:** Containment Log\n\nFollowing a period of data collection related to SCP-6599, attempts to contain the anomaly were authorized by Area-179's Containment Authority under the direction of Researcher Coates. Attempts are listed below.\n\n\n||~ **Proposed Containment** ||\n||Lure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. Subdue SCP-6599-1 with tranquilizer darts.||\n||~ **Result**||\n||SCP-6599 account engaged on a forum related to scrimshaw. SCP-6599-1 manifested, battered its way into Area-179's Testing Chamber α-4 and immediately attacked D-662833. Tranquilizer darts were unable to penetrate SCP-6599-1's skin and effectively sedate it. D-662833 survived with a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, and a broken tibia.||\n\n-----\n\n||~ **Proposed Containment** ||\n|| Lure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. Test Chamber α-5 will be refitted with conductive flooring and wall panels. These will be electrified until SCP-6599-1 is subdued.||\n||~ **Result**||\n||SCP-6599 account engaged on a board related to square dancing. The door to Test Chamber α-5 was left open and a path was cleared. Upon SCP-6599-1 entering, the chamber was electrified; this was ineffective, as SCP-6599-1 was able to withstand the voltage, remarking that the feeling was \"weak as shit\". D-109682 was grabbed by SCP-6599-1 and thrown at the opposite wall, electrocuting them. D-110465 suffered 3rd degree burns on 60% of his dermis and two broken arms.||\n\n-----\n\n||~ **Proposed Containment** ||\n|| Lure SCP-6599-1 via use of a D-Class subject. With approval from O5-5, Agent Woodcock, wielding [[[SCP-5175]]], will then be implanted into Test Chamber α-6 to confront SCP-6599-1.||\n||~ **Result**||\n|| Incident-6599-029.

Prepare to be vanquished by DEATH KNIFE, bitch!\n\n//SCP-5175-1 appears above Woodcock. It then flies towards SCP-6599-1, who once again attempts unsuccessfully to punch the entity. While SCP-6599-1 is distracted, Woodcock unholsters shurikens from his armor and slings them at SCP-6599-1. The entity quickly punches through a wall, ripping out a large chunk of concrete, and uses it as a makeshift shield.//\n\n//SCP-6599-1 launches the concrete at Woodcock.

Woodcock flies over SCP-6599-1, who attempts unsuccessfully to grab the agent midair, and bounces again off another wall and onto SCP-6599-1's back. SCP-5175-1 punches at SCP-6599-1's legs, attempting to take it off balance.//\n\n//SCP-6599-1 begins to thrash as Woodcock's grip tightens. Woodcock is unable to stab SCP-6599-1, as his knife hand is firmly in the grip of SCP-6599-1. SCP-6599-1 runs backward into a wall, jumping and slamming Woodcock into the concrete, who finally releases his grip.//\n\n//Woodcock lands on his feet, and surveys the chamber as SCP-6599-1 appears to be catching his breath.//\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** You’re pretty good!\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** NOT SO BAD YOURSELF, DIPSHIT.\n\n//The two run at each other. Woodcock tosses SCP-5175 into the air, catching it and stabbing at SCP-6599-1, who dodges each attempt. All attempts to punch Woodcock made by SCP-6599-1 are deflected by SCP-5175.//\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING—\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** JoJo reference?!? He’s kind of like a stand actually if you th—\n\n**SCP-6599-1** I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. HE’S A SKELETON THOUGH, THAT’S FUCKING COOL, BROTHER.\n\n//SCP-5175-1 grabs SCP-6599-1 and throws it to the ground.//\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** You had enough yet?\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** ME? I’M JUST GETTING STARTED.\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** You ever dance with the devil in the, uh, under the, in the moon?\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** THE JOKER SAID THAT. I FUCKING LOVE THE JOKER. HELL YEAH, BRO.\n\n//SCP-6599-1 leaps to its feet and readjusts its sunglasses, which are now visibly cracked. The entity charges forward, but Woodcock counters with a punch from SCP-5175-1, who now stands in front of the Agent. The two exchange blows for a period of time, fighting to a stalemate.//\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** I’m thinking of getting a portrait of the Joker on my thigh.\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** THAT’D BE SICK. WAIT, I’M FIGHTING YOU. STOP DISTRACTING ME.\n\n//SCP-6599-1 goes to punch Agent Woodcock, but is once again deflected by SCP-5175-1. Angered, SCP-6599-1 begins to target SCP-5175-1, as Agent Woodcock slides under the entity's legs and towards the chuck of concrete left on the floor.// \n\n**Agent Woodcock:** //Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.//\n\n//Woodcock runs at the concrete, using it as a springboard. He leaps towards a wall, bounding off of it towards SCP-6599-1, driving the blade into SCP-6599-1’s back and pulling the knife out. SCP-6599-1 falls to a knee.//\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** //Tsuki no ringo dakedenaku, meiyo o motte korosu. Watashi no petto o sayōnara.//[[footnote]]Loosely translates to “Not only the moon apples, but also the mayo. Goodbye, my pet.”[[/footnote]]\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** GODDAMNIT. THAT AIN’T NO POCKET KNIFE, SON.\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** Sucks having to end this so early. I was having fun.\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** NEVER HAD ANYONE WHO COULD ACTUALLY KEEP UP WITH ME BEFORE. YOU DID ALRIGHT. I’D BUY YOU A BEER, YOU PIECE OF SHIT.\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** In the next life then, okay?\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** IF YOU’RE GONNA FINISH ME OFF, DO IT RIGHT, BASTARD.\n\n//SCP-6599-1 grabs SCP-5175 and stabs the knife further into SCP-6599-1's check.//\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** Y-You’re…\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** A BADASS MOTHERFUCKER.\n\n**Agent Woodcock:** Hell yeah, you are!\n\n**SCP-6599-1:** THAT WAS KIND OF… F...F-FU—\n\n//Purple mist surrounds SCP-6599-1, and the entity disappears. Tears are seen forming in Agent Woodcock’s eyes. He sheathes SCP-5175, and exits the testing chamber.//\n\n[[=]]\n**<<END LOG>>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum.6599.5:** Behavioral Changes\n\nFollowing the altercation with SCP-5175-1 and PoI-3445, SCP-6599 and SCP-6599-1 were presumed to be neutralized, as was the case with other anomalies that had been lacerated by SCP-5175. However, SCP-6599 accounts resumed activity the following day, though a number of changes in posting behavior were noted. SCP-6599 began writing opening posts instead of responses, seemingly inviting communication from others. Secondly, SCP-6599 accounts began posting exclusively on websites related to psychology, therapy, anger management, self-improvement, and life advice at a rate less frequent than its previous activity levels. Below is an abridged list of examples.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n**Website:** //FlowersGalore// - A website dedicated to advice and do-it-yourself \"life hacks\" regarding personal gardens.\n[[div style=\"display: block ; background :#d4fad4 ; font-family: 'Bona Nova', serif; color: #525252; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n= [[size 160%]]##2b9c09|**FLOWERS GALORE**##[[/size]]\n\n-----\n[[div style=\"background:white;width:90%;padding:1px 15px;margin: 10px auto;\"]]\n[[size 85%]]**HOGSLICE** ##gray|08/23/2020##[[/size]]\nHELLO DOUCHEBAGS.\n\nSOME ASSHOLE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO TOUCH GRASS AND WHEN I DID I REALLY LIKED IT.
