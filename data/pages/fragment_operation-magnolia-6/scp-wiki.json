Satellite eyes blink and roll as the triple pupils narrow, focusing on the old man on the other side of the observation porthole.\n\nDr. Zipf, high on stolen Soviet psychotropics, sits in a chair in a room crowded with monitoring equipment. Colors bloom and shift and fade and decay as his scrambled sensory perception associates sounds with sight, sight with taste, smell with sound. He hears distant murmurs without the use of his ears. He leans heavily on his cane, shoulders hunched and back bent. Seventy-nine years have not been kind to him; he would not deserve their kindness, anyway.\n\nHis lips move silently, tracing out the ancient phonemes as they rise and fall in the long patterns of those long-dead priests. He has marked his face with blood drawn from his own body and mixed with glycerol, to keep the sigils from dripping. \n\nThe walls of the observation chamber fall away, and Zipf feels himself plunge into the slurry of meat and acid. His skin burns in a flashing moment of white-hot sympathetic pain. He feels himself floating weightless in cold, dark water. A black shape, barely visible in the gloom, circles around him with powerful strokes of its tail.\n\nA voice that is not a voice rumbles up from the depths and settles into his bones. It is raw thought: untainted by feeble and uncertain language, unburdened by decadent sapience. By esoteric pathways it reaches Zipf’s language centers where his altered consciousness, straining under the weight, converts it into lesser sounds and words. They echo through his mind like the grinding of glacial ice.\n\n<THE VERMIN THINKS ITSELF LORD.>\n\n<By the Wounded Lord I compel your submission to his law, Mighty Son.>\n\n<THE VERMIN CLAIMS AUTHORITY, THAT IT IS BELOVED OF THE MASTER OF THE HEAVENS AND EARTH.>\n\n<By the Wounded Lord, I compel your submission to his law.>\n\n<CRAWLING IN FILTH, IT CLAIMS TO SPEAK AS A SERVANT OF HIGH STATION.>\n\nZipf, back in the observation room, draws in a deep breath and completes the last component of the ritual he had been building up in his mind. A flower of pain, cold and bright, blooms and burns in his skull. His teeth clamp down on the belt he has placed in his mouth. His limbs shake. His cane falls to the concrete.\n\n<By the Wounded Lord, I **COMPEL YOUR SUBMISSION TO HIS LAW**.>\n\nThe dark shape pauses its orbit, slowly moves its great triangular head back and forth.\n\n<THE VERMIN ROARS AND BEARS ITS TEETH. IT HAS STOLEN A PIECE OF POWER.> A bassy thundering rolls through the water, untranslated. <BY THE LAW THAT ORDERS THE COSMOS, THE VERMIN SHALL BE HEARD. SPEAK, PARASITE.>\n\n<Who is your lord and master?>\n\n<THE KING OF POWER.>\n\n<For what purpose were you sent here?>\n\n<TO MAKE STRAIGHT THE PATH.>\n\n<Are there more of your kind?>\n\n<THE LORD’S SERVANTS ARE MANY.>\n\n<Does your lord seek entry into this world?>\n\n<DOES NOT THE MASTER HOLD RIGHT OVER HIS POSSESSIONS?>\n\n<What does he seek here?>\n\n<TO ORDER AND TO CLEANSE.>\n\n<How will he arrive?>\n\nThere is no answer. Zipf is coming down from the high, now. The pain in his head dwindles to a dull throbbing fog. The observation room appears behind the veil of the abyss as the black water fades from his vision.\n\n<THE VERMIN HAS OVERSTEPPED ITS STATION. ITS WEAKNESS REVEALS ITSELF. DISGUSTING. BEGONE, PARASITE.>\n\nZipf snaps back into his own mind and falls from his chair as he is struck by simultaneous GTC seizure and intracranial hemorrhaging.\n\nThe great yellow eye closes.\n\n> While Dr. Zipf’s access to SCP-682, possession of synthetic psychotropic НЛ-3, and use of thaumaturgic ritual had not been authorized by the relevant departments, his means of acquisition were quickly determined during the investigation to follow.\n> \n> As SCP-682 was one of the three principle anomalies overseen by Special Project Group CADMUS[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The others being SCP-076 and SCP-106.[[/span]], Dr. Zipf’s Level 3 security clearance would have been sufficient to procure time in the observation chamber. His personal influence as CADMUS senior staff would have been sufficient to dictate that this time was not officially logged.\n> \n> The acquisition of 15 mg of НЛ-3 is believed to have been carried out on 05.APR.1985, three weeks before the incident, during SCP-███ cross-testing. This was the last logged access to the НЛ-3 supply prior to Dr. Zipf’s death, and the SCP-███ experimentation log entry for the day states that the НЛ-3 acted as expected on the human user and triggered no response from SCP-███. Due to the requirements of SCP-███’s containment procedures and the aftermath of its 1995 containment breach, it is not possible to confirm if this test occurred.\n> \n> The thaumaturgy used by Dr. Zipf was identified as a derived form of Daevite Ritual AA12 (Manuscript G-102-B1), which is presented in the text as a means for the priestly caste to communicate with non-human entities. As with his access to the SCP-682 observation room, Dr. Zipf’s existing clearance and senior status would have been sufficient to persuade lower staff to violate archive protocol and either delete or never log his search queries.\n> \n> At the time of Zipf’s death, his actions were judged to be a singular incident caused by a lone actor against the directives of SPG CADMUS; more recent analysis of the incident has placed it as part of a greater trend of security access abuse and unaccountability within the Special Project Groups of the 1980s and 1990s.\n> \n> Complicating matters were Zipf’s connections with Dr. Lukas Graham[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Graham, who served as Paleoanthropology Department Chair from 1919-1939, research lead on SCP-1726 from 1926-1939, and Overseer 5 from 1948-1956, was a controversial figure both during and after his tenure due to his outspoken belief in theosophic theories of race science and its connections to occultism and the Daevite civilization.[[/span]] and his prior membership in the Sonderkommando für Paranormales[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Zipf swore an oath of allegiance to the Foundation and its mission as part of his participation in Operation LETTERHEAD, and was consistently judged to be within the acceptable range of mental health and ideological expression during psychiatric evaluations.[[/span]]. While neither thread could be proven as a direct influence on or cause of his actions, these connections spurred the generation and spread of related conspiracy theories among Foundation personnel. \n> \n> As Dr. Zipf expired within minutes of his attempted contact with SCP-682, it is not known if the ritual succeeded or what information may have been communicated by either party. Subsequent autopsy revealed brain damage similar to that of rapid-onset chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a known side-effect of improperly-practiced or purposefully destructive mind-altering thaumaturgy.\n> \n> It remains unknown why Dr. Zipf believed that there was a connection between SCP-682 and the Daevite civilization. \n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/5| Previous]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/7| Next]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
