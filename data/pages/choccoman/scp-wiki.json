I'm [[*user choccoMan]]. I am a connoisseur of cringe, and an avid collector of dust.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=pfp.png|caption=Artist's rendition of my profile picture cos I can't verify whether it's CC and I don't want Doctor Cimmerian to find out where I live (yes, he actually did that). I think I'll name him Eugenius Quasimodo Lawchild.|width=300px]]\n\nI tend to mostly write tales and post art, but I do happen to take a cheeky visit to SCP land every once in a while. This page is dedicated to storing my written work, including my SCPs, tales, GoI formats, and other doodads and hooligans. I have a separate page for my art, which would be linked **here** if I actually had one.\n\nMy favorite genres are absurdism, surreal horror, surreal anything and bureaucratic horror. My favorite author is [[*user Billith]], and my favourite SCPs are [[[SCP-4231]]], [[[SCP-7999]]] and [[[SCP-7000]]].\n\nI'm bisexual and aromantic.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCPs\n[[/=]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Order Chronologically]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8886\"]]\n+++ [[[SCP-8886]]] - ##brown|INRI## [[size 60%]]//(+%%rating%%)//[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n> //Save your breath, brother, for this is not the final punishment.
