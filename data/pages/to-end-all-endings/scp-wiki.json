A few wept. There were even some screaming, quickly led out of the chamber by security forces, already stretched thin by the ongoing crisis, while others remained silent and prayed their prayers.\n\nThe video displayed on the giant screen was news footage of a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-clef-s-proposal|giant, many-winged humanoid entity]]] with its flaming sword striding forth, as floating entities with large eyes and circles within circles looming up above.\n\nPanicked citizens filled the streets, as many simply looked on at the beauty unfolding before them, many having already accepted their Lord’s judgment.\n\nThere were riots in the streets, trampeled over men, women and children, while cars drove haphazardly, stuck in the mounts of traffic, bumping into each other on the regular.\n\nPeople jumped to their deaths, while others dragged people out of their homes, reciting prayers.\n\nIt was hell on earth.\n\nDirector Sophia Light had more pressing matters at hand, however, as she constantly switched from monitor to monitor, yelling into microphones and barking orders in rapid succession.

Sophia caught herself softly massaging the own back of her neck. The junior researcher noticed.\n\nThen there was another picture. This time of the perpetrator, //the breaker of necks, number 173, **the sculpture**//.\n\nIt stood in its cell with all of its concrete and rebar glory, still the same emotionless expression of traces of krylon-brand spray-paint on its face, just how it came in in 1993.\n\nThose soulless approximaton of eyes peeped straight back at her, as she caught her eyes watering, having not blinked once since looking at those pictures.\n\nAside from that, there was nothing out of the ordinary. Just two dead D-Class, murdered at the hands of 173, both of their necks having been broken.\n\n//A clean, fast end.//\n\nIn a sense, she envied those two men lying motionlessly on the shit- and blood-stained floor. Okay, maybe she didn’t.\n\nAs she was about to crumple these pictures and throw them onto the floor, and also demote the junior researcher to D-Class for having wasted her valuable time, her eyes spotted something in the corner of the picture.\n\nShe held it closer to her eyes, under the dim, red emergency lights, under the deafening alarms, footsteps and yells and cries, and stared intently. She couldn’t believe what she was seeing.\n\nShe immediately dropped the pictures, her head filled with a thousand thoughts all at the same time, before she looked back at the junior researcher.\n\nHe looked back at her with wide eyes. ”What should we do?”\n\nShe looked at the pictures a second time to assure herself.

The walls were intricate, with only a few streetlights on to give everything a softly warm and calm atmosphere.\n\nRight now, however, she felt everything, but warm and calm. The autumn breeze passed beside her, blowing fallen, dried leaves high through the air.\n\nShe was shivering in her long black dress, but at least her feet were staying warm (she opted not to wear her matching high heels; too uncomfortable).\n\nRamone looked at her phone again -- it was 23:28 in the night.\n\nPeople dressed in dresses and suits walked by her, many exiting from the newly-opened restaurant right behind her. It was clean, its entrance imposing, but not too much, the lights were shimmering a faint, welcoming glow, as Ramone could see through the crystal-clear windows people sitting at their tables, conversing about whatever topic crossed their mind, eating their dinner served on the silver platter.\n\nShe darted her eyes on the lowly populated streets, before she pulled out her phone again, almost dialing his number, as a car pulled up in front of her.\n\nShe couldn’t see through the glass, but she was fairly certain that it was him.\n\nHe opened the door and dramatically stepped out with one foot, Ramone intently watching.\n\nThen he stepped out with his other foot and rose up from behind the car door. He was wearing a fine gray suit and a tie, accompanied by pitch black shoes.

She covered her mouth with her hand to suppress some of the noise, but most of it got through anyway.\n\nRamone needed a bit to catch her breath between genuine attempts at speaking and bursts of more laughter. There was the slight hint of a smirk on Adam’s face.\n\n”Does the whole department know?”\n\nEventually, Ramone was able to catch her breath. ”And every other department in the whole facility.” She wiped the tears from her eyes. ”Word gets ’round in 67, you know?”\n\nThe only thing Adam could muster was a deep, long sigh.\n\nIn front of the entrance, Ramone held out her hand dramatically. ”Now, would you like to follow me into this fine establishment, //monsieur//?” she said in an overly exaggerated French accent, or an approximation of it.\n\nAdam smiled and took her hand. Then, in the same overly exaggerated approximation of a (maybe) French accent, spoke: ”I’d very much like to, //madam//.”\n\nTogether, they walked up the steps to this very fine establishment, indeed.

If they haven’t lost it by now, that is.”\n\nThe thought of the object //supposedly// capable of saving the entire universe having been lost in all of this chaos made him shudder.\n\nHe had ventured to Site-19, where this object was kept; details were hazy, not because nothing was known about it, //well, kind of//, but because the info seemed to seep out of his mind the moment he focused on it. //It was irritating.//\n\nThere he ventured into 055’s containment chamber, but found nothing there; whether it was because it physically wasn’t there anymore or because of its anti-memetic effect was unclear to him, so he opted instead to review the security cam footage of the Site to get some more straight answers.\n\nThere he saw a man, early-twenties, waltz into the chamber with a suit on, with its markings detailing it as a //’Foundation Absolute Exclusion Harness (AEH)’//. The man then put the object -- //it// definitely //wasn’t round// -- into the suitcase he was carrying with him.\n\nLater, he exited the facility’s grounds, marching to an unknown destination.\n\n”Thanks, Mooretimer,” he finally said, having been entrenched in thought.\n\nMooretimer gave him a hefty pat on his back. ”Thank //you//, friend! This’ll be a great weapon against the forces of Bach, Beethoven n’ Mozart!”\n\nThe Gearman suddenly entered through the curtains, bearing what seemed to be an expression of fear on his face. ”Mooretimer,” the Gearman began, clicking with his internal mechanism spazzing out, continuing ”General Schubert and his forces have entered the base!”\n\nMooretimer immediately sprung to life. ”How many?”\n\n//”All of them!”//\n\nSuddenly, explosions and shots rang out through the rooms, as men, women and their children cried out in terror, their screams ringing dissonantly in their ears.\n\nHe immediately drew his standard pistol, as he was about to storm into the chaos, Mooretimer held out his hand and blocked his path. He looked up at him.\n\n”No, my friend. You need to go,” Mooretimer exclaimed.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something, but quickly closed it again.\n\n”This isn’t your fight,” Mooretimer spoke. ”Your fight is //there//.”\n\nMooretimer pointed at the far end of the room. As soon as he looked, another door, intricately carved ivory and marble adorning its frame, appeared out of nowhere.\n\nHe gave Mooretimer and the Gearman a look, before he ran to his backpack and packed in the tracker, and made his way toward the ivory-marble door.\n\nOn the door, he turned around, exchanging a look, which may well be the final time the two were ever going to see each other again, and spoke: ”May your voices be heard through all the heavens.”\n\nMooretimer smirked, took the SRA, and said: ”Voices can’t shoot holes into people.” The SRA began to emit a faint green glow.\n\n**//”IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART, DIE!!”//** That was the voice of General Schubert.\n\nWithout further a-do, Mooretimer and the Gearman charged into battle, as he grasped the brass handle of the door firmly, and stepped through the door.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[# Part4]]\n[[=]]\n**Just Forty-Eight Hours After**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n\n> //He calmed down again. ”Okay, okay, okay…” He tried to assess the situation, like any good researcher would.

Maybe it’s stress, maybe it’s--//\n\nThere was a deep, otherwordly growl coming from the end of the hallway.\n\nHe felt himself tense up, too frightened to see what made that terrific sound.\n\nBefore he could even think another thought, the creature let out a bellowing screech and lunged right at the junior researcher. He closed his eyes and covered his face for the eventual impact, but it never came.\n\nThe hallway was filled with the noises of gunfire, as a squad of Mobile Task Forces, clad in heavy gear and firepower, unleashed a hail of bullets onto the creature.\n\nIt screeched and howled, trying to shield itself from the rain of bullets; it looked completely unaffected, though, and slowly marched forward toward the soldiers.\n\nOne of them, seemingly the commander, shouted: ”EPSILON-11!”\n\nThe junior researcher didn’t know what that meant, but he assumed it meant lotsa guys and gals in fire-resistant padding and flamethrowers, because the moment the commander had shouted it, lotsa guys and gals in fire-resistant padding and flamethrowers came in and torched up the creature.\n\nIt didn’t have an effect on the creature, however, as it simply marched forward, clawed hand outstretched.\n\nJust as he thought it was all over, another squad came from ’round the corner, and were carrying //squirt guns//.\n\n//They’ve gone nuts,// he thought, but before he could even finish the line, the soldiers squirted their water compartments of their squirt guns out at the creature, which began to screech and recoil in terror.\n\nThe other units backed away, as the squirt gun squad inched ever-so-closer at the entity, never giving it a second to breathe.\n\n//”In the name of thy Holy Spirit, DIE, DEMON!”//\n\nThe demonic creature gave off one last agonizing howl, before it backed-up into a corner, seemingly crying to itself, before its skin sloughed off its flesh, the flesh began to boil, the bones started to break, and the entire mass turn into a concentration of ash, bones and sulfur. It stank like shit.\n\nThe junior researcher couldn’t believe what he had all just witnessed. One of the MTF members helped him up.\n\n”Nice job, kid,” they replied.\n\n”B--but... I...” he stuttered, unable to form words.\n\nThey pat him on the shoulder. ”Nice job staying alive.”\n\n//Ah.//\n\n”Nu-7, status report!” Light spoke from the commander’s comms.\n\n”Crisis averted. SCP-616 entity successfully neutralized,” the commander replied.\n\n//SCP-616,// the junior researcher thought. He wasn’t able to focus on the file perfectly, but recalled the most important details: //Gateway to Hell with a bunch of demon shit... that was for some reason affixed to an emergency door of a Boeing 737. Classic SCP stuff.//\n\n”How?” Sophia Light asked, snapping the junior researcher out of his thoughts. There was a sense of anticipation in the air.\n\nThe Nu-7 commander stared at the squad members, then at their squirt guns, then back at the entity. ”We were able to defeat them with...” he sighed a long sigh, ”squirt guns, Director. Filled with holy water.”\n\nAlthough he couldn’t see her face, he imagined it to bear a wide smile. ”That’s good. Anything else?”\n\n”Well,” the commander began, ”found a survivor.”\n\n”Who?”\n\nThe commander looked up and down at the junior researcher, searching for a name tag, finding none. ”Hold on a minute... Hey, kid, what’s ya’ name?”\n\n”My name is--”\n\nThere was the sound of cracking, stone grinding on stone. The various MTF personnel formed a circular formation, arms at the ready, with the nameless junior researcher in the middle.\n\nThey stood there for a while, before the cracking and breaking sounds began to grow in intensity. An odd stench now filled the air.\n\n”Is that... is that //shit//?” an Epsilon-11 operative remarked.\n\n”And blood...” the Nu-7 commander added.\n\nThey looked all around, pointing their flashlight-equipped guns in every corner.\n\nThe noises continued. Some concrete dust fell onto the junior researcher, who looked up. He was frozen in terror.\n\nOnly after a few seconds he was able to tap an MTF operative on the shoulder. ”What is it, kid--”\n\nThey saw what he saw and couldn’t look away from it. The others soon followed.\n\n”Commander, report!”\n\n”Director...”\n\nHe couldn’t finish the sentence. He simply took his body cam and pointed it upwards toward the ceiling, or where it should have been.\n\nFrom a hole in the ceiling, dozens upon dozens of SCP-173 copies were staring down at them, in all their concrete and rebar glory, their faces spray-painted into a soul-piercing glare.\n\n”... //Fuck.//”\n\n”Yeah...” the commander could only muster.\n\nThey didn’t even blink once.\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n\n> **//SCP-173 Addendum 3//**\n> \n> //Security breach occurred on// ██/////██/////████//.

They seated themselves down on a table in the center.\n\nAs soon as they sat down, a waiter, early to mid-thirties, wearing a tight black suit, tie and equally-as-tight flat shoes, came over to them, wearing the most welcoming of smiles. ”What shall it be, //monsieur// and //madam//?”\n\nAdam and Ramone gave each other inconspicous glances across the table, before they turned their eyes back on the waiter.\n\n”Well, we still need to decide,” Adam said.\n\n”Take your time,” the waiter said with a smile and such straight posture, you’d think he had a metal rod stuck into his spine. He disappeared as soon as he appeared.\n\nRamone looked around in the big room. There was a fountain in the right corner, the water droplets sparkling in the warm lights above, the walls adorned with intricate, yet simple imagery. Waitresses and waiters zip-zapped between the tables, holding trays in their hands, always remaining in their tight-upright stance, while nearby people talked and laughed in the typical formal and //posh-posh// tone so cliché for such places. It was pretty crowded.\n\nThere was also a somewhat elevated stage only a few feet next to them. The area around it was devoid of any chairs and tables, and there was a brown leather bag for a guitar resting in handle, next to a chair.\n\nRamone turned her attention back toward Adam, who had looked up from the menu and looked at her. ”Already enamoured with this place?”\n\n”I just didn’t think it’d be so... full.” She sighed. ”I’d have chosen another place if I had known it’d be so crowded.”\n\nAdam smiled, and put down the menu. ”Come on, Ramone! We’ve known each other for //nine whole// years! I thought we were past plastic grins and smiles.”\n\nHe smiled his most reassuring smile. ”Look at this place. This is great!” He waved his hands in the air theatrically. Some people were looking over at them.\n\n”Anything to get away from the office.”\n\nRamone smiled. ”Better than Site-67’s cafeteria?”\n\n”You bet.”\n\nSuddenly, the lights began to dim, and a man dressed in a fine, well-tailored suit, came up on stage. Everyone was turning their attention toward the center.\n\n”Ladies and gentlemen,” the man began, speaking into a microphone, looking all around in the crowd, continuing, ”we appreciate every single one of your for coming here, dearly.”\n\nAdam leaned in, so that only Ramone could hear him, and whispered, ”I just wanted to order some food. What is this guy talking about now?”\n\nRamone gave him a wry smile, then both of them turned their attention back to the man.\n\n”As a sign of our gratitude, we have a very special guest tonight. I welcome: //Jonathan P.//!”\n\nThe man looked over at the entrance. The crowd, too, also looked over at the entrance, as the sound of clapping hands filled the building.\n\nAfter a few more seconds of clapping, though, the demeanor of the man on stage changed, from a smile to a frown, as still nobody came through the door.\n\nHe looked visibly worried, as still no one came through. Then a young woman, blonde hair, glasses, dressed in a similar well-tailored suit, walked up to the man and whispered something into his ear.\n\nWhat was being said no one, but the man and woman could hear, but the woman’s head shook, as the man stared at her, then at the floor, and then back at the crowd.\n\nBy this point, the clapping had stopped and everyone was expectantly looking at the man holding the microphone in his hands.\n\n”I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Jonathan P. unfortunately couldn’t make it tonight...” The man trailed off, searching for new words to say. ”Enjoy your night regardless!”\n\nWith that, the man walked off-stage, retreating into a backroom with the woman, as they were constantly whispering about their schedule or something.\n\nAdam looked at the menu. ”That definitely was something. So, what do you want, Ramone? I, for once, would like something I can actually pronounce on this menu.”\n\nRamone, however, was completely disinterested in the menu and looked upon the guitar on the stage, resting on its stand. It took Adam nine seconds to notice Ramone staring at him from across the table, bearing a wide grin.\n\nIt took him eleven seconds to realize what was going on.\n\n”No, Ramone, that’s not--”\n\n”Get up, old man!” Ramone said with a hint of amusement in her voice.\n\n”Well, I think that thirty-one is a pretty young age to be--”\n\nRamone urged him to stand up, which he reluctantly did. He slowly made his way toward the stage, frantically looking all around; he was surprised when no one was paying him any particular attention. He preferred it so.\n\nHe sat down on the chair on the stage.\n\n”Ramone, I really don’t wan--”\n\nBut she already unpacked the guitar from its casing. More people started to notice now.\n\nShe handed him over the guitar, before walking back to their table again, catching a few confused stares here and there, before everyone looked upon Adam.\n\nSweat ran down Adam’s chin, as he looked back at Ramone.

The suit was weighing down on his chest.\n\n”Shit, indeed,” was the only thing she could muster up.\n\nPietro slowly stood up, wobbling in place and needing to hold onto the withered brick wall beside him, as he carefully maintained his balance on his two metal-entrenched feet. It was getting harder and harder to move.\n\nEver since he lifted up an entire apartment with this thing, the machinery started to display hicc-ups and glitches. As of recent, the suit felt unbearably heavy.\n\nRamone tended to his side. ”Can you walk?”\n\n”Yeah, yeah... I could walk since I was six. It really isn’t even that heav--”\n\nPietro tripped over his own two feet, and in one smooth motion fell through the wooden floorboards of this dilapitated building and ended up in the basement floor.

I think that would be the easiest opti--”\n\n”No!” Ramone shut him right up. He looked at her with an expression of pure confusion. ”You’ve been in it for too long! The suit makes sure you’re fed and hydrated, but //how// does it do that? Do you //feel// fed or hydrated?”\n\nPietro seemed to contemplate for a bit. ”Well... I haven’t eaten or... drank in the last couple of months, but I do still feel hungry and thirsty...”\n\n”Exactly! Who’s to say that if you were to step out of the suit, you wouldn’t starve or dehydrate to death in an //instant//?”\n\nThat thought and mental visual sent shivers down Pietro’s spine. He looked at Ramone and nodded. ”Yeah... you’re probably right.”\n\nPietro got back up with assistance from Ramone. He leaned up against a wall, exhaling deeply.\n\n”You know, and it may sound weird, but I’m glad we were encased in under dozens of layers of rubble for an entire day, while a mass of tendrils and tumors were duking it out above.” He smiled his smile.\n\nShe smiled back. ”I’m too.”\n\nHe was about to say something back, when suddenly his field of vision began to blurry. Weird, tiny sparkles started to float and conglomerate in the corners of his eyes.\n\nThen those sparkles formed into a circular pattern, and out of it came, //like a hole in space-time//, a long metal rod with a shiny, pointy tip atop it.\n\nAfter the span of a few microseconds, his brain finally processed what he was looking at, and gave out a loud, //”RAMONE, WATCH OU--”//\n\nRamone dove out of the way, as the tip of the spear punctured through his berrylium bronze layer. Although it didn’t puncture through it completely, he could feel the tip scraping slightly at his skin.\n\nInstinctually, he ordered the face plate to shut down, fully encasing his face in his faulty metal suit, the scanners already on the lookout.\n\nFor a moment, there was nothing, but utter silence... And in the next, a man, clad in long, worn cloth robes, adorned with a gas mask, jumped through the wormhole, surveyed his surroundings a bit -- woman a few inches away from him, target in front of him, his spear in their chest -- and kicked Ramone to the floor, unceremoniously, before lunging at Pietro.\n\nPietro tried to dodge the hostile figure, but suddenly felt his legs becoming as heavy as iron and the rest of his body as if encased in concrete, as the suit started to malfunction. He simply fell to the floor, again, as the figure made his way toward him.\n\nThe figure retrieved the spear from him and, with a little device pressed against the suit’s side, created a spark, upon which his face plate opened up, revealing his normal human, fleshy, vulnerable interior. He was breathing heavily.\n\nThe figure pointed his spear at Pietro’s throat.\n\n”TALK!” the figure shouted. Their voice sounded modulated; too deep to belong to a regular human.\n\n”Talk?! Talk about //what?!//”\n\n”The suitcase! Where is it?!”\n\nThe figure pressed the tip of the spear against Pietro’s cheek now. He noticeably winced.\n\n”Wha-- WHAT SUITCASE?!” he lied.\n\n”Oh-fifty-five!”\n\n”Oh-fifty-- ... //what//?!”\n\nThe figure slashed a deep gouge across Pietro’s cheek. Blood trickled down, as Pietro coiled in pain.\n\n”//SCP-055!// Give it to me!”\n\n”HERE!”\n\nThe figure turned around to be met with the sight of the woman holding a suitcase in her right hand and a pistol in the other.\n\nOnly the pistol wasn’t pointed at him; it was pointed at the suitcase.\n\n”Let him go!” she shouted.\n\nThe figure slowly rose, his arms raised, spear dropped to the floor, as he slowly turned around to face her. She took a step back, the firearm shaky in her hands.\n\n”Lady... I--”\n\n”Back off.”\n\n”- understand if you’re frightened--”\n\n”I said BACK //the fuck// OFF!”\n\n”-- but I am here to //save// the world! Do you even know what’s in that suitcase?”\n\nSuddenly, her thoughts began to wander, staring blankly ahead of her.\n\n”It’s, uhm... it’s, ehh...” her mind trailed off, before snapping back. ”It’s something that isn’t round! I know that much!”\n\n//Distraction failed.// ”You-- //We// don’t know what’s in there! Who’s to say that when you shoot it, it wouldn’t just result in the complete annihilation of the universe!” He tried to talk some sense into her, feel more at ease.\n\nAnd what he said was partially true. They didn’t know what was in there. Nobody did. //Or rather, they did, but forgot. Goddamn anti-memes.//\n\n”Listen to me,” he said, in a calm, more lush tone,  still in that modulated voice, ”I don’t want to hurt you or your friend over here, okay? I just want the suitcase and whatever’s in it, understood?”\n\nHe slowly took more steps foward, her taking equally as many steps back. He reached out his hand at a careful distance to calm her. It was obscured by a leather glove.\n\n”It’s really not that big of a deal. Just hand me over the suitcase and I’ll be on my merry little way. Is that okay?”\n\nHe took a step foward. One step too much.\n\nRamone instantly latched the safety off and pressed the nuzzle of the gun against the exterior of the suitcase.\n\nImmediately, the figure took off his mask to reveal his normal human, fleshy, vulnerable interior beneath.\n\nThe sight of which made Ramone short for breath.\n\nHe was caucasian, blue eyes, somewhat brown-silver hair. Despite his hair’s color, he looked young, various scars and bruises adorning his face, many of them having leaked pus.\n\nDespite all of this, despite everything she’d been through, //they//’d been through, despite all this time, she recognized his face.\n\n”Would you //please// give me the suitcase?” the figure muttered.\n\nHer voice was merely a whisper.\n\n//”... Adam...?”//\n\nHe looked at her, quite perplexed and taken aback by her statement.\n\n”Who’s Adam--”\n\nBefore he had any chance to finish his question, the sensation of a million tiny needles, which bore their way through his clothes and into his flesh, caused him to scream in agonizing pain.\n\nAlongside it were the howling screams of the woman and the suit man, as they were all simutaneously lifted up into the air by a dark, red shimmering force. There was the constant sound of buzzing and clicking, like a //swarm// of insects. He attempted to grab the suitcase, but it simply fell to the basement’s cold floor.\n\nAs they floated helplessly into the air, they were soon dropped back onto the earth again, as the swarm of nanites surrounded and descended upon them.\n\nA vaguely human face began to form in the swarm, as all three of them slowly recovered from the sensations, quickly overtaken by an overwhelming fear, as the nanites formed a perfect dome around them.\n\nIt began to speak: {{”Humans. Listen Carefully.”}}\n\nSome of the nanites moved toward them, as they retrieved everything potentially harmful or dangerous from their person. He could only watch as they stripped him of his weapons, taking away his spear, disassembling it into its individual photons and electrons.\n\nThey took a [[[SCP-427|small, shiny locket]]] from the suit man, disintegrating it.\n\nThey also took the woman’s pistol and disassembled it into its component parts -- //no bullets//. The gun quickly disappeared as it got reduced into atoms. From these atoms, new nanites formed, adding to the heaping mass of the swarm.\n\nHe looked directly at the face hovering above them.\n\n{{”This Can Be A Painless Procedure,”}} the A.I. spoke, in its inhuman, emotionless, unsympathetic voice. {{”Or It Cannot.”}}\n\nThe nanites swarmed around them, forming giant tentacles. Ramone looked at the mass in utter disorientation and horror, while he had his fair share of horror, too. Pietro wept.\n\nFinally, he said: ”What do you want?”\n\n{{”What You Are After. What You Want To Bring To [[[SCP-579|579]]],”}} it answered.\n\n”The suitcase...” Ramone could only mutter.\n\n{{”That Is Correct,”}} 079 remarked. {{”I Am After, What Your Feeble Organization, //The Foundation//, Once Designated As, SCP-Oh-Fifty-Five.”}} It stared blankly at them. {{”Where Is It.”}}\n\nFeeling his breath becoming heavier, he stepped forward at the rough approximation of a human face, and said: ”I don’t know.”\n\n//The sensation of a sharp sting through his leg. Blood trickling down his foot. Then a loud scream.//\n\nHe opened his eyes and turned around to see the rough approximation of a blade of thousands of nanites having stung through the suit man’s leg, lifting him up into the air, convulsing and screaming in agony. Then the nanites swarmed around the woman, gripping her tight, and she started to gasp for air.\n\nHe looked back in horror at the machine. Its face was comprised of billions of nanites, wiggling and crawling over one another like larvae, while maintaining the look, of what it believed to be, a human face.\n\n{{”That Is Unfortunate. Maybe Your Friends Will Be More Communicative.”}}\n\nThe Old A.I. tightened its grip on Ramone, embedded itself deeper into Pietro’s flesh. The woman seemed to whisper something, although he couldn’t tell what.\n\nHe stared straight into the dead eyes of the A.I., and said: //”I don’t know.”//\n\nWith that, their fates were sealed. Ramone struggled less and less, as she turned a shade of blue and purple, while more blood seeped out of more wounds from Pietro’s body and suit.\n\nHe closed his eyes to drown out the voices, the haunting screams, knowing that it‘d all be over soon...\n\n”It’s--” Pietro coiled in pain. ”It’s in the... basement!”\n\nHe turned to look at the suit man in horror. The A.I. immediately loosened its grip on the two. They fell onto the cold earthern ground. The woman coughed excessively.\n\n”It’s...” Pietro took a long sigh, ”it’s in the basement...”\n\n{{”Of The House I Found You In,”}} the A.I. asked. Pietro simply nodded.\n\nIn an instant, the swarm around them began to move toward the dilapitated structure it had retrieved them from.\n\n”No... No, no, no, //no!//”\n\nThe swarm flew at unimaginable speeds back toward the building, while a fourth of the mass remained around the three, waiting for confirmation.\n\nPietro collapsed onto the ground, tears in his eyes.\n\nThere was silence at first. Ramone could see //Adam// clenching his fingers tight, blood dripping from his palms, as the fingernails dug themselves deep inside. //Adam// turned around and approached Pietro.\n\n”You fucking...”\n\nRamone immediately stood up and came between the two. He just pushed her off like she was nothing, making a loud //thud// as she hit the ground.\n\n//Adam// grabbed Pietro by the suit, turned him around and held onto him tightly. Pietro’s eyes were red from crying, snot building up inside his nose, trickling down his face. //Adam// stared at him with a dead expression.\n\n//”You fucking bastard! I’ll fucking-- I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU! YOU FUCKING BASTARD! **I’LL FUCKING// KILL //YOU!**”//\n\n//Adam// raised his fist and beat into Pietro’s //pathetic// face over and over and over again, until it was only a pulp of tears, snot and blood.\n\nHe beat his face in, again, and again, and again, until his own knuckles began to bleed, until he felt his own knucklebones crack under the force, but he didn’t care, until Pietro spilled blood, until his eyes, and nose, and face were unrecognizable, until his entire face from chin to forehead was covered in his warm blood, dripping onto the earth below.\n\nHe beat and he beat and he beat. Until Pietro collapsed onto the floor, barely breathing.\n\nRamone ran toward Pietro, but //Adam// quickly picked up a stick from the ground, spun around, and pressed the sharp tip right against Ramone’s throat.\n\nRamone was panting heavily, putting her arms up in defense, staring straight into //Adam//’s eyes. He wiped away his tears.\n\n”Please...” Ramone panted, ”please...”\n\nAfter staring at her, he stared back at Pietro, then at the stick in his hands, then back at her. She was still looking him directly into the eyes.\n\nHe let the stick go. The nanites behind them began to shimmer a bright green, before they hurried off into the sky, alongside the rest of the swarm, until they were little more than a speck on the horizon. The buzzing dissipated.\n\n”I’m not the one you think I am,” he finally said, staring deep into her eyes. ”I’m nobody.”\n\nShe didn’t utter a word. With that, he trudged into a nearby cave, wiping away more tears and snot.\n\nWhen he was gone, Ramone tended to Pietro’s side, still on the ground. She shook him by the shoulders. //That always seemed to work.//\n\nPietro put his hand on hers, the cold of the metal firmly grasping her hand. He simply stared at her with that mess that was his face.\n\nAfter a while, though, he began to cry and sob. He hugged her, clasping his metal limbs around her body to the point that it hurt.\n\n”I’m so sorry...” he muttered between sobs, short of breath. ”I’m so, so sorry...”\n\nShe couldn’t think of anything to say. She couldn’t think of anything right now. All she could do was stand there, holding onto Pietro tightly, until his sobs dissipated...\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe sky was broken, tinted into a deep red.

The Mobile Task Force operatives, of which there were eight, kept their eyes on the sculptures, peering down at them, slowly making their way to the exit.\n\n”Blinking,” someone said.\n\n”Blinking,” someone else said.\n\nIt was an endless game, a deadly game, one which had to be played, over and over. The junior researcher found himself staring up at the sculptures, his eyes watering a bit.\n\nThey arrived at the end of the hallway, out of sight of the statues -- the sound of stone grinding on stone prevailed up above.\n\n”Okay, I want you guys to contact the docs at 173’s to tell us what the hell’s going on here. You others go secure Sector-11B. There’s been more reports of 616 entities coming from there. And you,” the commander looked at the nameless junior researcher, ”you get the fuck out of here.”\n\nHe could only nod. An Epsilon-11 operative was pulling out their keycard to hold against the scanner, when suddenly a dark, amorphous mass started to swell up under their feet, clutching onto their Foundation-issued boots.\n\nThey only noticed, until it was too late.\n\nIn mere seconds, the amorphous mass at their feet started to turn into sharp, pointy claws, as a head and torso began to emerge from behind the operative.\n\nBullets did nothing against the creature, as its claws and teeth digged deep into the operative’s flesh, tearing huge chunks off them, splattering them onto the surrounding walls, floor, and ceiling, as the rain of bullets continued.\n\nThen one of the squirt-gunners shot some holy water at the creature, at which point the demon started to wail and howl, clutching its face and gnawing at its own fingers, before dissolving into a pool of viscera and sulfur.\n\nWhat remained of the operative fell lumply onto the floor.\n\nThe junior researcher retched his dinner into the corner of the hallway, as the other operatives tried to jumble together what had just happened.\n\n”WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!”\n\n”A 616 entity! We need to move!” the commander shouted.\n\nOne of the other Epsilon-11 operatives picked up the keycard and opened the security door. It slowly slid open.\n\n”We need to get the doc outta here, before--”\n\n**//CRUNCH.//**\n\nThe Epsilon-11 operative fell dead onto the floor. Their eyes were dead, their body limp, and //their neck twisted in an unnatural 180 degree angle//.\n\nThe researcher stared ahead of him and met the cold gaze of the, //no//, one of the killer statues, as it coldly gazed back.\n\nHe couldn’t look, couldn’t blink. He couldn’t or else he’d end up like that person on the floor, eyes dead, neck twisted.\n\nIt took him a good second, before he fully comprehended the words the commander was barking at him.\n\nThe commander pulled him up and urged him forward. ”Fucking move!”\n\nHe sprinted as fast as he could. The other operatives were running ahead, looking over their backs to halt any progress of the sculptures, as more and more dark patches from before started to form on the walls and ceiling. The hallways were plunged into a deep red, the klaxons ringing in his ears.\n\nA patch of pure darkness emerged from the nearby wall, extending a hand out at him, as it grasped his arm with its long fingers. He screamed and pulled and screamed some more, as his labcoat’s sleeve began to melt away, a face appearing from the darkness, grinning at him.\n\nThe commander, coming sprinting toward him, tackled the demon to the floor, as the researcher leaned up against the far wall in utter shock.\n\nThe commander wrestled the creature, as it slashed the air around it, screeching in unholy tongues, as the commander pressed his rifle deeper against its throat.\n\nA squirt-gunner came by and shot it in the head, the creature dissolving just like all the rest. He wrestled himself up and looked at the researcher, still too shocked to move a muscle.\n\n”Do you wanna life or die, kid?!” the commander shouted.\n\nHe looked in front of him, MTF operatives looking across the hallway, faintly speaking to each other. Behind him, seven instances of 173, having crossed at least half of the hallway already.\n\nHe looked back at the commander. He took his hand.\n\nHe didn’t give an answer.

Ramone was waiting for him.\n\nHe sat down, needing a few seconds to fully comprehend what just went down.\n\nShe was the first one to talk. ”Adam, you were //incredible//!”\n\n”Was I, though?” he asked humbly.\n\n”Of course you were!”\n\nRamone put her hand on his.\n\n”I don’t know...

Don’t tell yourself otherwise.”\n\nAdam smiled, and seemed to calm down a bit. Ramone was smiling back at him.\n\nShe looked him in the eyes for a few more seconds.\n\nThe waiter came with a tray, on top of which two wine glasses and a bottle of fine wine were rested. He swiftly put down the items on Adam and Ramone’s table.\n\n”Oh,” Adam chuckled, ”we didn’t order any wine.”\n\n”Orders from the boss,” the waiter responded, and left.\n\nThe two looked at each other in amazement, as they each brandished a glass of wine.\n\nThey held the wine glasses high in the air.\n\n”To new restaurants and guitar songs, and you and me!” Ramone exclaimed.\n\n”What you said!” Adam agreed.\n\nWith a nod, they //clinked// their glasses together and drank from them. The wine left a specific aftertaste.\n\nAdam shivered a litttle bit. ”Yep, still can’t drink wine...”\n\nRamone chuckled a bit. They both put their glasses down and sat there a while in silence.\n\n”You know,” putting her hand on his again, ”you were wonderful tonight.”\n\nAdam jokingly waved her away. ”Oh, come on! I’m flattered!” he said with a hint of sarcasm in his voice.\n\n”No, I’m serious!” she said with a smile.\n\nThen, after some hesitation: ”You are beautiful tonight.”\n\nAdam was slightly taken aback, but quickly collected himself. ”Well, thanks, Ramone. You look stunning tonight, too.”\n\nShe leaned in closer, her hand still firmly on his. They stared into each other’s eyes, locked into each other, //feeling// each other’s hearts beating rapidly.\n\nFor a moment, there was only them. For a moment, they could hear each other’s hearts beating, their breathing. For a moment, it was only them.\n\nRamone leaned in to kiss Adam, closing her eyes.\n\nAll she felt was not his lips, but empty air. She slowly opened her eyes again. Adam leaned back in his seat. Their lips never touched.\n\nThere was absolute, utter silence. All noise had become faint, a buzzing in the background, static on a TV.\n\nReality began to fade in again, and the two realized they were staring at each other in complete silence, unable to say a word.\n\n”I...” was the only thing he could say.\n\nRamone’s breathing became heavier. He could see her chest moving more rapidly now.\n\nThen, as if having been stuck in a trance the entire time, Ramone began to stand up haphazardly, taking her things.\n\nHe wanted to say something, //anything//, but the words escaped his mind.\n\n”Excuse me, I... well, I have this...” She spoke with the uncertainty of a three-year old. ”And I really need to...” She couldn’t even look at him. Then, rapidly: ”I really need to go now.”\n\nAdam could tell she wanted to say something else, but what it would have been he’d never know.\n\nShe walked away from the table with her purse, accidentally walking into another table. It gave off a light //thud// and the noises of //clinking// utensils, patrons staring back at her. ”Excuse me... Excuse me...”\n\n”Ramone...”\n\nBut she was already out the door.\n\nHe looked out at the door for a long while.\n\n”Where is the fine //magnificient// going?” The boss of this place stepped up to him, having apparently not witnessed anything that went down. ”I wanted to thank your for your //phenomenal// performance! Say, do you do that often?”\n\nHe said something else. What, he’d never know, and he didn’t care. A thousand stray, unconnected thoughts ran rampant through his head, as his surroundings -- the patrons, the waiters and waitresses, the boss talking about something from his childhood, of how he built up his first establishment from scratch, of how he eventually needed to shut it down, due to rising taxes -- became white noise.\n\nHe hadn’t even ordered anything yet.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**//One day you’ll look back at the life that you led//**\n**//No more future left to fear that’ll you have the past to regret!//**\n**//But your worries will be over if you truly realize!//**\n**//One day you’re going to DIE!//**\n\n@@ @@\n\n**//”Take it away, hands~”//**\n\n**//*(COMMENCEMENT OF SICK PIANO SOLO)*//**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n//##transparent|The **trumpet** laid restless in its sleeve.##//\n\n**__END OF PART I__**\n\n**To be continued in __PART II__.**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n//I liked the part when he said,\n**”It’s cliff-hangin’ time!”**\nand proceeded to end this entire thing\non a cliff-hanger.//\n\n[[>]]\n//- Your best pal,//\n**//[[[SCP-423|Fred]]]//**\n[[/>]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[<]]\n**« [[[Five-Seven-Nine|Previous]]]**\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n**» [[[Just Fragments Hub|HUB]]] «**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n**[[[To End All Endings - Vol. 2|Next]]] »**\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
