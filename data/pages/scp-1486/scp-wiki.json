Following incident 1486-8, a 55-meter spherical radius is to be demarcated around SCP-1486 as an area in which absolutely no copulation is to occur.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1486 is a children's doll, 48 centimeters in height. SCP-1486 is animate; however, due to its nature it is mostly immobile. SCP-1486 is highly damaged, and is missing its right arm. SCP-1486 will frequently exude human blood, feces, pus, and cervical mucus from small pores covering its torso and head. SCP-1486 is seemingly sapient.\n\nIf a fertile, human couple of opposite sexes completes copulation within ~50 meters of SCP-1486 (regardless of contraceptive use), SCP-1486 will disappear from where it has been placed and appear in the female subject's uterus at less than 0.01% of its original size[[footnote]]Whether this effect is achieved through use of the same phenomena as observed in [[[SCP-886]]], [[[SCP-1263]]], [[[SCP-1586]]], or a combination thereof is currently unknown.[[/footnote]]. SCP-1486 will then begin slowly increasing in size at the rate of a normal embryo and foetus[[footnote]] For financial and ethical concerns, testing regarding the subject body's acceptance and nourishment of SCP-1486 has not been performed. For more information read Dr. Fulnan's paper: //SCP-1486: Hypotheses regarding the placenta and immune system//. [[/footnote]]. Ultrasound testing of the subject has shown that SCP-1486 retains its shape throughout the growth process. Subjects may sustain damage to the uterine wall, causing infertility. Excretions from SCP-1486 will exit through the cervix.\n\nAfter a period of ~9 months, SCP-1486 will induce labor in the subject. SCP-1486 may be birthed normally. However, due to the presence of several harsh edges on its exterior, Caesarian sections have proven to be a much safer form of delivery.\n\nOnce it has been birthed, SCP-1486 will search for the subject mother and in some instances, SCP-1486 will attempt to breastfeed unless restrained. SCP-1486 can communicate verbally through unknown means, and will address the subject and others.\n\nAttempted abortion results in SCP-1486 rapidly expanding, causing the subject's abdomen to rupture. SCP-1486 will be immediately hostile.\n\nSCP-1486 was discovered by Foundation operatives following a complaint submitted by [REDACTED] after an ultrasound imaging session.\n\n**Addendum 1486-1:**\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-1486\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Fulnan\n>  \n> **Foreword:** SCP-1486 had recently been birthed and was sitting with D-7397, its \"mother\", at the time of interview. D-7397 had been sedated and was unconscious.\n>  \n> **<Begin Log>**\n>  \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Hello SCP-1486.\n>  \n> **SCP-1486:** Hey doc, long time no see.\n>  \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Indeed.\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** 9 months, if I had to guess (Laughs). How's it hanging?\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** It's fine. Mind if I ask a few questions?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Shoot.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Alright. Who or what made you?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Well doc, when a mommy and a daddy really love each other, or are really fucking drunk...\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Please answer the question.\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** How do you think? My momma got laid and I happened to be the fastest sperm.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Alright. How did you become damaged?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Being born isn't fucking easy, you can get pretty torn up. I think I would know that better than anyone.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Okay. So this woman is your mother?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Yeah, this woman here's my momma. Might not be the best looker, but she's got the best tits I've ever seen.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** So you've seen tits before this?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** It's an expression, dumbass.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** But what about all the times you've been, er, born before this?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** What?\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** You don't remember being born before this birth?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Well, yeah, of course I do.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Were the women those times not your mother?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** I thought they were, but they would scream and throw me away. How could they be my momma if they would do that?\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** They gave birth to you.\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Well, yeah, but I mean they hate me. How could a mother hate her own kid, doc? Enough to hurt them so much?\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Lots of mothers...\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** It doesn't make any sense! How could they just throw me away? How could they just hammer it in like that?\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** Well, I mean...\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** I just don't get it.\n> \n> **Dr. Fulnan:** 1486?\n> \n> **SCP-1486:** Can we stop please?\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n>  \n> **Closing Statement:** Examination of SCP-1486 following the interview showed a severely increased excretion of cervical mucus from the area surrounding its eyes. SCP-1486 was separated from D-7397 and placed into storage.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1485]]] | SCP-1486 | [[[SCP-1487]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
