My name is Darius![[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/adoption-poster-darius/dare.png]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nGet To Know Me!\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\nI'm looking for a good and loving home in the Three Portlands-Boring area. I get along with most people, so long as they aren't in positions of power. I really can't stand to be near them. This is no joke, folks! I start cussing up a storm and shouting all sorts of profanities if one so much as gets near me. So long as you aren't in a place of authority, you and I should get along just fine!\n\nI'm a very special bird, a resplendent quetzal to be exact. My species doesn't talk, so I really am unique! As you can see, we've got some pretty attractive plumage, which means I would be a colorful addition to your home. I don't need a lot of room, but I would certainly appreciate having a big, spacious cage to stretch my little wings in. I come with a small travel cage, one bag of feed -- and my toys!\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;\"]]\nI'm a rebel! Ms. Wilson tried her best to look after me, but I would yell and yell until she left me alone. The folks at Wilson tried to acclimate me by assigning me to a Volunteer Jefferson (a police officer), but after I threatened to bite his lips off and defecate in his mouth, they figured it was time for me to go.\n\nI'm pretty easy to take care of. I only need my feed and water to be changed regularly, and some room to relax in. Seeds and fruits are my favorites, especially avocado. No need to turn it into guac -- just feed me that yummy fruit as-is!\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nImportant Things About Me!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\n* I just love to eat fruits and bugs!\n* My tail feathers get really long during mating season!\n* I'm part of an endangered species, please be kind to me!\n* I am really quiet most of the time!\n* My species is associated with the Aztec feathered serpent, the Quetzalcoatl!\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;\"]]\n* I have a really bad potty mouth!\n* I //really// don't like police! Please keep them away from me!\n* I can chew through wires, so keep them hidden and out of my reach!\n* I can get pretty loud if someone I don't like comes near, so be careful!\n* Keep me away from cats! They scare me!\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes From My Foster Parents!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n> //This thing was awesome until I became an RA at Deer and he started pooping on my reports. Sorry, Darius. You were a real homie but I can't have this happen again.//\n> \n> ~Brock Sanders\n\n> //This bird sang the entire 'Fuck the Police' song.//\n> \n> //Who taught him the song?! There's no way anyone over at Wilson's knowingly allowed this.//\n> \n> ~Ted\n\n> //The proximity range Darius picks police officers up on is startling. I can't in good conscience keep him in my home because it makes me feel as if I am using a living, breathing, and sometimes squawking, police scanner. Creepy.//\n> \n> ~Simran Nark\n\n> //It was funny at first (my dad's a cop), but then it got loose and pooped all over my dad's uniform and chewed up his radio. After my Dad found out, well,  better off at Wilson's than here. Sorry, Darius...//\n> \n> ~John O'Malley\n\n> //He was perfect up until inspection time at the Deer dorms came. He started calling the dorm inspector a fascist and told him to kiss a frog. It was pretty funny, especially when the inspector threatened to turn him into a frog. It wasn't funny when Darius threatened to stab him with a broken bottle. Needless to say, he's not welcome here anymore.//\n> \n> ~Alice Ferrer\n\n> //My husband and I thought we would be able to deal with a potty mouth parrot. We were fine when he started calling him a class traitor and cuckold. We were fine when he threatened to peck out his eyes and poop in the sockets. We were really unhappy when he flew out of his cage and threatened my husband at knifepoint in the kitchen.//\n> \n> ~Erik E.

We were looking forward to putting him to work. \n\nYour brother was able to show me the email in which you replied to him about the bird's medical emergency, but he was not able to produce his own receipt. He had claimed to have cleaned out his Inbox and Outbox, which was true, but we found no such receipt on your end after a brief inspection. \n\nI apologize for the intrusion, but one can never be too sure with national security. \n\nYours,\n- FBI Regional Director Aponte\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowynn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Anders Wilson\nDate: 7/29/2019\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nMr Aponte,\n\nYeah, it sure is strange.
