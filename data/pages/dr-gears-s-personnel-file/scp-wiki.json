  "content": "**Dr.Gears** (aka \"COG\")\n\n------\n\n**Euclid-class object specialist.**\n\n**Security Class:** [EXPUNGED]\n\n**Duties:** Field Evaluation, Field Recovery, SCP development and review, object research. \n\n------\n\n**History:**\n\nDr. Gears was approached in the early days of the Foundation's existence.  Since that time, he has assisted in several recovery and containment projects, and has been a valuable consultant during several events, notably [DATA EXPUNGED].  \n\nDr. Gears is a normal human being, and has thus far avoided any SCP Item contamination.  However, he posses some notable differences, mainly in the form of emotional response.  Dr. Gears appears unable to respond in an emotional manner to any outside stimulus, with very few exceptions.  Also, he appears to lack a startle reflex, and the basic form of “fight or flight” response.  A example is the [DATA EXPUNGED].  Despite both the internal bleeding and partial blindness, Dr. Gears calmly requested for the testing to finish, and walked under his own power to the medical ward a half hour later.  \n\nWhen asked about these irregularities, the doctor responds “I'm good under pressure.”  Some members of staff have asked if Dr. Gears is a robot, or a SCP item.  Such inquires are to be directed to Dr. Gears.\n\n------\n\n**Yearly review interview excerpt:**\n\n**O5-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Dr. Gears:** No, it’s not that they’re “out to get us”. Nothing is out to get us. Review the data, most of the SCP items do not actively seek to damage or harm anything. It’s an extension of their basic function, like a car emitting exhaust. It’s not that it intends to produce a toxic mix of chemicals in order to do harm; it’s just one of its functions.\n\n**O5-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Dr. Gears:** With very few exceptions, no, I don’t believe they are. Their existence is just a determent to //our// existence. Other beings may view these items as basic as children’s toys or a spark plug. They are removed from their reality.\n\n**O5-██:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Dr. Gears:** Why would they be sent to us? We all need to put away our “Mars Attacks!” cards and start being realistic. We are not under attack. We are not the “last line of defense”. We are not on the cusp of a new era. No one is out to get us, and no one is going to save us. These things exist because they exist, and will do whatever it is they do. I think that’s the problem we have, we want there to be some great plot or underlying reason for this. There’s not. We are alone, and the universe does not care. At least, I sincerely hope it doesn’t. \n\n------\n\n**Current assignments:**\n\n[[[SCP-882]]] - A Machine\n[[[SCP-053]]] - Young Girl\n[[[SCP-409]]] - Contagious Crystal\n[[[SCP-718]]] - Eyeball\n[[[SCP-162]]] - Ball of Sharp\n[[[SCP-238]]] - Building Complex\n[[[SCP-455]]] - Cargo Ship\n[[[SCP-015]]] - Pipe Nightmare\n[[[SCP-682]]] - Hard-to-Destroy Reptile\n[[[SCP-914]]] - The Clockworks\n[[[SCP-028]]] - Knowledge\n[[[SCP-104]]] - The Lonely Ball\n[[[SCP-184]]] - The Architect\n[[[SCP-172]]] - The Gearman\n[[[SCP-201]]] - The Empty World\n[[[SCP-212]]] - The Improver\n[[[SCP-217]]] - The Clockwork Virus\n[[[SCP-236]]] - Mimic \"Crabs\"\n[[[SCP-229]]] - Wire Weed\n[[[SCP-261]]] - Pan-Dimensional Vending\n[[[SCP-280]]] - Eyes In The Dark\n[[[SCP-293]]] - Obsession\n[[[SCP-352]]] - \"Baba Yaga\"\n[[[SCP-386]]] - Eternal Fungus\n[[[SCP-470]]] - Nexus of Abandoned Places\n[[[SCP-510]]] - Soft Death\n[[[SCP-575]]] - Predatory Darkness\n[[[SCP-775]]] - Hungry Ticks\n[[[SCP-716]]] - The Train\n[[[SCP-367]]] - Little Dog\n[[[SCP-791]]] - Water Ball\n[[[SCP-084]]] - Static Tower\n[[[SCP-106]]] - The Old Man\n[[[SCP-673]]] - Tissues\n[[[SCP-695]]] - Eels\n[[[SCP-1013]]] - Cockatrice\n[[[SCP-4940]]] - Transforming Transformer\n[[[SCP-6341]]] - Canadian Mail Void\n--SCP-197-- - Crystal Spiders\n--SCP-216-- - Water Absorber\n--SCP-039-- - The Parasite\n--SCP-306-- - Frog Rot\n--SCP-527-- - Deadly Block\n--SCP-218-- - Lamprey-Mass Organism\n[[[SCP-406-ARC]]] - Mysterious Life Form\n\n**Support Documents:**\n\n[[[Interview 882-1]]]\n[[[Personal Log of Gordon Richards]]]\n[[[Personal log of Paul Martin]]]\n[[[Personal Log of Dr. Gears]]]\n[[[Experiment Log 187-1]]]\n[[[Experiment Log 914]]]\n[[[SCP-212 Upgrade Log]]]\n[[[Archived Incident 076-2/682]]]\n[[[Experiment Log T-98816-OC108/682]]]\n[[[CoTBG \"Bible\" Fragments]]]\n[[[Recovered Documents From Cell 3]]]\n[[[Transcript Found on Storage Level B-8]]]\n\n**Additional Documentation:**\n\n[[[Work manifest for Dr.Gears]]]\n[[[Document 8668206-DG]]]\n[[[Dr. Gears storytime entries]]]\n[[[archived:electronic-shadows-project|Electronic Shadows project]]]\n\n[[[Perfection]]] - Mr. McCredie and [[[scp-138-arc|the former SCP-138]]]\n[[[Epitaph]]] - Iceberg and Gears share some quality conversation\n[[[The King Is Dead]]] - What if...\n[[[Transcript Found on Storage Level B-8]]] - More disinformation?\n[[[Clockwork Time]]] - Who can say what you might find, if you look back far enough?\n[[[Splinters]]] - \"No man is an island, entire of itself\"\n* [[[Opening Moves]]] - Sometimes you start to play a game well before you're aware of it.\n* [[[Queen to Pawn]]] - Every piece is useful, somehow.\nThe Lockdown - Containment breach incident of [[[SCP-110]]]\n* [[[the-lockdown|Intro (Pt.0)]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
