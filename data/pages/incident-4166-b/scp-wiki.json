Any and all items deemed fit in use for self harm have been removed and SCP-4166 will be denied its usual requests until further notice. Increased security and surveillance will be in place indefinitely. End of report. \n\n    **Addendum:** The following conversation was captured on camera 64-B, in front of the office of Dr. A. Clef. \n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n    **Personnel Present:** Dr. Alto Clef, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-0166 Dr. Sophia Whateley]\n\n    \n\n\n  **<Begin Log>**\n\n\n**Whateley:** “I mean did they even //think// this through even a little? We can’t afford to keep this up forever, let //alone-//” \n\n    **Clef:** “Do I need to call security? If you don’t get out of here right now I’m going to-” \n\n    **Whateley:** “SCP-4166 attempted suicide.” \n\n    **Clef:** “... Yeah and?” \n\n    **Whateley:** “Doesn’t that bother you?” \n\n    **Clef:** “Believe it or //not//, it does bother me. I mean what if it’d tried to attack our guards?” \n\n    **Whateley:** “Come //on//!” \n\n    **Clef:** “No, //no!// Don’t come //on// me. You’ve gotten lax. That //thing// might look like a depressed teenager, but it’s not human, and you need to stop caring about things like that.” \n\n    **Whateley:** “You’re disgusting.” \n\n    **Clef:** “Ha! //Oh man// if I had a dollar for everytime someone said that to me… I should start charging.” \n\n    **Whateley:** “I’m serious, you’re //despicable//. That anomaly in there is just a little girl. Taking away her art supplies and putting more //strangers// around her isn’t going to make her //less// suicidal.” \n\n    **Clef:** “Look, sweetheart, I don’t know what the hell you want from me. Last I checked, //you// were in charge of containment here. They don’t let me //near// kids anymore.” \n\n    **Whateley:** “She needs people to talk to. People //her// age.” \n\n    **Clef:** “We tried that shit before, doesn’t work. Too dangerous. You still haven’t answered my question: What's this have to do with me?” \n\n    **Whateley:** “I need you to make a fuss. The second you stick your nose in something the entire Foundation starts looking at it. No one will hear me out unless you make a scene.” \n\n    **Clef:** “Okay, and what if I don't give a shit?”\n\n    **Whateley:** “Then //I’ll// remind //you// of a //certain// time I helped you out.” \n\n    (//Silence for 5 seconds//)\n\n    **Clef:** “Are you serious right now?” \n\n    **Whateley:** “This isn’t a threat, I’m not threatening you. I’m just saying it would be //nice// if you did something out of the //kindness of your heart// to repay an old //favor//. Do you have a heart? Or do you eat them?” \n\n    (//Silence for 5 seconds//)\n\n    **Whateley:** “So what’s going to happen here?” \n\n    **Clef:** “I’ll get back to you.” \n\n    \n\n\n  **<Log End>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n    **Addendum 2:** On ██/██/2013 Dr. Alto Clef made the following public statement: \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n    //“Back in my day containment was so simple. You put the thing in the box and if it starved in there then great! One less anomaly! These days we have so many variables and expenses and ‘mental health issues’. The point is, I believe in doing things in the simplest and cheapest ways possible. And rerouting half of the guards to watch some kid is not simple or cheap. -𝄡”//\n[[/div]]\n    \n\nIn response, Dr. Sophia Whateley made the following proposal: \n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n    //“Whether or not certain people want to admit it, our anomalies are people. And people don’t react well to being shoved in small spaces with no one to talk to. In the past we’ve deemed SCP-4166 too dangerous to interact directly with other anomalies, which is why I’m proposing we give SCP-4166 a penpal. Someone her age that she can talk to without so many prying eyes on her. All correspondence can be easily monitored and edited to preserve any classified info. - Dr. Whateley”//\n[[/div]]\n\n    **Addendum 3:** The following discussion took place 3 hours following Dr. Whateley’s proposal. \n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Personnel Present:** Dr. Alto Clef, Dr. Sophia Whateley, Dr. Benjamin Kondraki[[footnote]]It should be noted that Dr. Kondraki was not invited to this meeting, but was allowed in given his previous experiences with anomalous humanoids.[[/footnote]], Dr. Sophia Light\n\n\n  **<Begin Log>**\n\n\n**Clef:** “A //penpal//? Seriously? That’s the best you could come up with? What are we in grade school?” \n\n    **Whateley:** “Did you ever go to school, doctor?” \n\n    **Clef:** “That’s a //weird// question and I'm not going to answer that.” \n\n    **Kondraki:** (//Snorts//)\n\n    **Clef:** “Do you have something to say?’ \n\n    **Light:** “Who would 4166 be writing to? It would have to be someone we can easily monitor. And how do we even know this will help?” \n\n**Clef:** “Do you want to give some junior researcher a sad teenager to keep happy?” \n\n    **Light:** “Or a therapist.”\n\n    **Whateley:** “No, I think it //needs// to be someone her age. Someone who really knows what she's going through. The point is that she’s just a lonely kid who needs a friend.” \n\n    **Kondraki:** “I’ve got a teenage boy back at home. He’s always been social, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind befriending someone new.” \n\n    **Whateley:** “That’s closer to what I have in mind, but 4166 tends to react negatively to male presenting personnel. I think her penpal should be a teenage girl, and I think she should be another one of our anomalies.” \n\n    **Light:** “You’re kidding.”\n\n    \n\n\n  **<Log End>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 4:** The following letter was written by SCP-166 to SCP-4166: \n\n    \n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\"]]To My New friend,\n\n    My name is [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-166 Meridiana], but you can call me Meri if you’d like. Sometimes I’m also called SCP-166. I haven’t written a letter in years and I’m SO excited to get to know you! I want to know everything about you. What’s your name? How are you? What do you do for fun?\n\n    I’ve been told you haven’t been feeling very well lately, and that makes me so sad :(. Whenever I feel bad I like to reread my favorite book. What sort of books do you like to read? I’d love to hear all about them! \n\n    Write back to me soon! \n\n    Your new best friend,\n\n    Meri[[/span]]\n\n    **Response from SCP-4166:**\n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]Hello Meri,\n\n    I’m SCP-4166, but I’d really rather you didn’t call me that. You can call me Doe if you have to, or really anything. Just don’t call me that. \n\n    So that’s my name. How am I? I’m not doing well. Sometimes I feel like I shouldn’t exist and I don’t know why I'm not allowed to. Not exist that is. \n\n    I don’t really know what to do for fun around here. I like to draw but I’m not allowed to right now. That’s about all I really know how to do. \n\n    I don’t really like reading. Sometimes I play video games when they let me have them. What sort of books do you read? Do you play video games? \n\n    I don’t know how to end this letter, \n\n    -Me[[/span]]\n\n    **Notes:** This letter was initially written in crayon and retyped for SCP-166’s viewing. After receiving SCP-4166’s letter, SCP-166 requested several video games (denied) and several age appropriate novels (granted, pending review and approval of contents)  [[footnote]]//“It’s Warrior Cats, what’s the big deal?”// -Whateley[[/footnote]]\n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\"]]Dear Doe,\n\n    Doe is such a cute name! It’s so good to meet you, Doe! I hope you don’t stop existing, because I only just got to meet you! And you seem really nice. \n\nDrawing sounds really cool, I draw too sometimes, though I prefer to write stories. I’m sorry you can’t draw right now,  I hope you can again soon! I’d like you to show me! \n\nI recently finished reading a very interesting story about cats! I’m going to ask if you can borrow my copy. I’d love to hear your thoughts. I don’t really know about video games. I’ve never played one. Sometimes TVs don’t work around me. What are they like? Do you enjoy them? [Maybe we can play one together]*. \n\n    I know we’ve just met, but it’s been a long time since I’ve met someone new and very excited about this. Sometimes I struggle to talk to the people I know, so it’s nice to talk to you! I hope you won’t hesitate to talk to me too!\n\n    Your new best friend,\n\n    Meri[[/span]]\n\n    **Notes:** *The following line was removed from the copy SCP-4166 received. [[footnote]]//“We don’t want to give either the impression that they will ever be able to meet in person.”// -Light[[/footnote]]\n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]To Meri, \n\n    I’m glad you like my name? I’ve never really given it much thought. I don’t really like being referred to, though I don’t mind so much in these letters. \n\n    I did get your cat book. I thought it was a little weird. I guess I can see why it’s cool. I’m not really sure how to talk about things. \n\n    Video games are cool I think. They’re kind of like books but you’re the main character. It’s something to do. I’d send you my favorites but they probably wouldn’t let me. Sorry there’s not much more to say about it.\n\n    I’ve never really talked to anyone else either. I don’t think I’m all that interesting. I hope you like the cat.\n\n    -Doe[[/span]]\n\n    **Notes:** SCP-4166 included a crayon drawing of an orange cat in its letter[[footnote]]A recreation of the //Warriors: Into the Wild// illustrated cover[[/footnote]]. The drawing was deemed appropriate and included in the copy SCP-166 received.[[footnote]]//“These letters are sooooooo boring. Do we have to catalog every single one?”// -𝄡[[/footnote]][[footnote]]//“You’re not even supposed to have access to this.”// -Light[[/footnote]]\n\n    **Addendum 5:** As of ██/██/2014, SCP-4166 has made no further attempts on its life. Manifestations of SCP-4166-2 instances have decreased by 67%. SCP-166 also shows increased morale. Any noteworthy correspondence will continue to be recorded in this file.[[footnote]]//“I think this is what we call a success.”// -Whateley[[/footnote]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]Deer (the pun has just occurred to me) Meri, \n\n\tI've included my annotated copy of your story in this letter. I found it very sweet and charming, though personally it feels a little incomplete. This would work as a very good first chapter if you want to continue this into a longer story.\n\n\tI must ask if the romantic undertone of Fennel and Verity's relationship is intentional. Fennel's descriptions of Verity and her devotion to Verity’s cause feel like they go beyond simply a shared goal and passion.\n\n\tI found myself very invested in their relationship (full thoughts in the annotations) and whether or not Verity shares Fennel's feelings or if she only enjoys Fennel’s company because she agrees with everything she says. \n\n\tIt’s good writing, if not really what I expected of you.\n\n\t-Doe[[/span]]\n\n\t[[span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\"]]My deerest (haha) Doe,\n\n\tAs always I am forever grateful for your input, I wouldn't be half the writer I am without you. I wasn't initially planning on writing a continuation of this, but if you enjoyed the characters enough maybe I will! You're always free to share your ideas for future parts!\n\n\tI’m afraid I don’t entirely see what you mean by the romantic undertone, or at least that wasn’t my intention, but it’s really cool to hear that there’s a whole story in there I didn’t even mean to write! If you would like to read their relationship as romantic then you can. I think Verity considers Fennel just as much as a friend and possible lover. \n\n\tPersonally I’m a little nervous about writing about romance as I’ve never experienced it. I’ve been in love of course! But it’s never become anything. If it’s not too personal, have you ever been in love?\n\n\tExcited for your response,\n\n\tMeri[[/span]]\n\n\t[[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]To Meri,\n\n\tThere was a time I thought I was in love. With a man I knew way back. He was much older than me, and I thought I liked that about him. I thought that being with him make me rebellious, that it was something I had control over, that no one could take away from me. \n\n Though, I’m afraid to say this story doesn’t end happily and ultimately I wish it had never happened to me. I don’t think that was love, more someone using my own desperation against me. I don't really want to say more about it than that.\n\n\tI know for sure that I have been in love once, but I don’t think it would be right of me to put that on them, what with everything. I’m sorry this isn’t really helpful to your romance writing.\n\n\t-Doe[[/span]]\n\n\t[[span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\"]]Beloved Doe,\n\n\tIt makes me happy when you share stories with me, even if they aren’t always happy ones. I’m sorry to hear that your relationship with your old friend didn’t end well. Personally, I think any man (or woman?) would be lucky to have you. You’re a very kind person who’s easy to love, and you deserve someone who loves you back. \n\n\tIf you are in love now (you don’t have to tell me with whom, though I would like to know) I think you should follow that feeling. Love should be a happy thing, and I hope you know that I want you to be happy above all else. \n\nI think for my next story I will write about Verity and Fennel’s love. After everything they’ve gone through with each other they deserve each other. \n\n\tYour friend always,\n\n\tMeri[[/span]]\n\n**Notes:** Upon receiving this letter, three SCP-4166-2 manifested and were quickly terminated. The following audio excerpt was picked up on Agent ████’s microphone seconds before the incident. \n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\t**<Begin Log>**\n\n\t**SCP-4166:** “Easy to love she says… She says it so gently…”\n\n\t**<Log End>**\n[[/div]]\n\n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]Dearest Meri, \n\n    We’ve been sharing these letters back and forth for some time now, longer than I think I’ve ever really known anyone. I hope you don’t take offense to me saying this, but when we first met I didn’t really believe you were real. I thought you were some person paid or forced to keep me entertained, that you were too good to be true and eventually you’d slip up or something and I wouldn’t have you anymore. \n\n    Now I know you, you’ve welcomed me into all the pieces of your life. You’ve shown me nothing but unending kindness even when I haven’t been particularly kind to you. I look forward to receiving your letters and stories even and especially when I look forward to nothing else. \n\n    I’ve had these feelings lately that I know I shouldn’t have. I fear if you were to ever see me in person you’d know instantly that there’s something wrong with me. That you’d immediately pick apart my awful and incorrect body and the sinful little creature stuck inside of it. \n\n    I’m not really sure if I had a point to what I was saying here, I’m sorry to dump such insecurity in these letters. I just want you to know that I --love-- consider you to be the best friend I’ve ever had.\n\n    -Doe[[/span]]\n\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\"]]My Darling Doe,\n\n    From what you’ve told me, the world hasn’t been very kind to you, and for that I can only ever be sorry. I may not ever see your face, but I know that you are a charming and wonderful friend and a fantastic artist. You’re more than what you’ve been told you are, you are not sinful and most of all, you’re not a monster. \n\n    To be honest, it’s a little comforting to hear you talk about your insecurities, to know that I’m not entirely alone in some of the things I too have been feeling. Lately I’ve had these thoughts about myself, about these feelings I’ve been having that I was told were wrong and strange. \n\n    Growing up I was given a long list of things that a girl like me should be. How I should speak, dress, behave, look, and most pressingly how my body is supposed to be. I’ve known for a long time that I’m different from other girls, not just for the traits that brought me here, and I was ashamed of how I was. But I know that God loves me, and I’m the way I am because He wanted me to be.\n\n    My point is, after all these years I’ve known you, after all the stories we’ve shared, I could never look at you as anything but my friend Doe. I’m so glad to have you in my life after all this time, and I hope whatever you’re feeling passes soon. \n\n    You're not alone, \n\nMeri[[/span]]\n\n**Addendum 6:** On ██/██/2020 SCP-4166 was approached for its letter. Upon seeing Agent ████, SCP-4166 proceeded to tear its letter to shreds and hide in its bed. The manifestation of three SCP-4166-2 instances required Agent ████’s retreat. \n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia Whateley\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-4166\n\n**Forward:** Following the incident described above, Dr. Whateley insisted on having the following conversation with SCP-4166. \n\n\n  **<Begin Log>**\n\n\n**Whateley:** “Heyyy buddy, what’s up?” \n\n    (//SCP-4166 does not move or respond for thirty seconds//)\n\n    **Whateley:** “You know your buddy 166 will be sad if she doesn’t get a letter from you soon.”\n\n    **SCP-4166:** (//Muffled//)\n\n    **Whateley:** “What was that?”\n\n    (//SCP-4166 sits up in its bed//)\n\n    **SCP-4166:** “Her name is //Meri//.”\n\n    (//Silence for ten seconds//)\n\n   **Whateley:** “Alright then, do you want to talk about your friend Meri?” \n\n\t**SCP-4166:** “No.”\n\n\t**Whateley:** “Are you sure?”\n\n\t**SCP-4166:** “It’s none of your business!”\n\n\t**Whateley:** “I just want to help you, I might know a little more about what you’re going through than you think.”\n\n\t**SCP-4166:** “You don’t know anything about what I feel or think! It doesn't matter anyway, it's not something I should be thinking about at all.”\n\n\t**Whateley:** “Is this about your feelings for SC- Meri?”\n\n\t(//Silence for ten seconds//)\n\n\t**Whateley:** “It’s not something you should be ashamed of, natural even for a girl in your position.”\n\n\t**SCP-4166:** “I don’t want to talk about this with them.” \n\n\t(//SCP-4166 points to Whateley’s standard issue recorder//)\n\n\t**Whateley:** “Would this help?”\n\t\n\t**<Log End>**\n\n\t**Notes:** Dr. Whateley remained in SCP-4166’s containment cell for another thirty minutes. She has been chastised for improper record keeping while interacting with an SCP object and has been temporarily removed from the project.\n\n[[/div]]\n    [[span style=\"font-family: \"Gayathri\", sans-serif;\"]]To Meri,\n\n    I’m sorry it’s been so long since I’ve last written. There’s a lot of thoughts I wanted to work through that I don’t think I can share with you. It’s nothing you did wrong. You’ll be happy to know I’ve been feeling a lot better now that I’ve had a chance to think about what I’ve been feeling. Maybe someday I’ll get to explain it all to you, but for now I’m keeping it private. \n\nI've been thinking about what you asked me before, about my feelings about love and whether I've ever been in love, and I remembered something. There was this girl, about my age, she was very kind to me in a time when I thought I never deserved kindness at all. She was someone who lived outside of where I grew up, I saw her playing out in the yard from my bedroom window. My sisters chased her off, but she kept coming back anyway. One day I got the guts to go say something to her. \n\n\tShe looked at me not with hatred like I was used to, but like I was something desirable. She’d give me cigarettes and taught me how to throw stones and run away. I knew her for a few years, before I eventually lost track of her and ended up here. She's one of my few positive memories.\n\n    In other news, I’ve been drawing a lot more lately, I’ve been told it’ll help my emotions. I think it would be fun to draw a comic of one of your stories :] if you’d be interested in that. I like when we can work together on something. \n\n    I’ll try to be quicker with my next few letters to make up for lost time. \n\n    Yours,\n\n    Doe[[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
