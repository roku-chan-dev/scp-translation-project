Foundation plants in global maritime and aerial authorities are monitoring all traffic for signs of disappearing and/or reappearing vessels related to SCP-8711. Individuals claiming to have been to and/or returned from SCP-8711-1 are to be detained, questioned, and then treated with Class B amnestics. Original photo and video evidence is to be archived or destroyed as needed.\n\nIf a vessel or aircraft disappears due to SCP-8711, recordings or transmissions prior to their disappearance should be closely analyzed and altered as needed. \n\nExpeditions into SCP-8711-1 should avoid disruption of the environment or SCP-8711-A. Field operatives are to be equipped with shielding devices designed to filter out auditory compulsions and are required to wear Andrewsian Insulation Suits at all times due to elevated Elan-Vital Energy (EVE) and Akiva radiation, and must have CRV scores of 15 or higher. Field operatives remaining on SCP-8711-1 for extended periods are, under no circumstances, to ingest liquids or edible material from SCP-8711-1 or SCP-8711-A, and must be aware that SCP-8711-A may attempt to tamper with their food or equipment. \n\n**Description:** SCP-8711 is a spatial-temporal displacement phenomenon and pocket dimension that primarily affects maritime vessels and aircraft traveling towards the rising sun on any given Sunday.[[footnote]] This is usually due east in more middling latitudes, but may be more south/north east in higher latitudes.[[/footnote]] Vessels affected by SCP-8711 are instantaneously removed from material reality, disappearing from all known means of detection. \n\nVessels and aircraft affected by SCP-8711 reappear in coastal waters filled with extensive rock formations and reef prone shoals surrounding a large island landmass dubbed SCP-8711-1. This landmass geologically resembles the semi-volcanic islands of the eastern Mediterranean, with a mixed temperate coastal and tropical climate. SCP-8711-1 is surrounded by a 'ship graveyard' filled with the wrecks and ruins of vessels from many disparate eras of history. \n\nRemaining on SCP-8711-1 for extended periods is hazardous due to elevated EVE and Akiva radiation levels. (See After Action Report and Interview Log AARIL-8711-01 & -02). Cellular phones, advanced computing devices such as laptops, tablets, and cybernetic cognitive processors fail upon entry into SCP-8711, but analog and digital cameras are largely unaffected. Individuals exploring SCP-8711-1 describe a constant feeling of being 'watched.' \n\nNo indigenous humans or other humanoid species have, as of the creation of this entry, been contacted on SCP-8711-1 by Foundation personnel. --SCP-8711-1's only living inhabitants appear to be SCP-8711-A.-- (See Supplementary Logs S-8711-01)\n\n[[include component:image-block\n  name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/USS_Wasp_CV-18_thypoon_damage_1945.jpg/751px-USS_Wasp_CV-18_thypoon_damage_1945.jpg?20090515155222|\n    caption=USS Wasp after Typhoon Cobra.\n]]\n\nSCP-8711-A consists of the fauna living on/within SCP-8711-1. SCP-8711-A are, primarily, known species of animals native to the Mediterranean region of Europe, with some notable deviations, including the presence of lions and leopards. SCP-8711-A are non-hostile. A number of civilians interviewed by the Foundation after escaping SCP-8711 claim to have encountered entities resembling well-known mythological or cryptozoological species. \n\nThough entry into SCP-8711 is well understood, the means by which some vessels have managed to escape the anomaly are unknown. \n\nAs of this report's creation, SCP-8711 has likely existed for at least two millennia, based on close examination of existing records, and may have existed as early as 1000 BCE.\n\n**Discovery:** The Foundation was aware of SCP-8711 and SCP-8711-1 from the moment the organization formed, due to wider awareness of superstitions regarding the phenomenon and the island contained within among sailors, and documentation by the British Admiralty during the early stages of modern colonization and the colonial period. Though records from other historical regimes and periods exist regarding SCP-8711, they tend to be more fantastical, fictionalized, or exaggerated.  \n\nDue to a lack of substantive evidence, experts within the Foundation widely considered SCP-8711 to be a superstitious belief fueled by the hallucinations of sailors until December of 1944, when the US Third Fleet produced video and photographic evidence which could not be dismissed. \n\nInvestigation of SCP-8711 through direct means was, initially, determined to be too dangerous, as the conditions for undoing the spatial displacement were not known and several expeditions had vanished shortly after loss of contact.\n\n[[div class=\"phasebox\"]]\n[[div  class=\"oceanliner\"]]\n+ {{Joint Pentagram and Foundation After Action and Interview Report}}\n+ {{Typhoon Cobra Log 1}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4776/pentagrambw.png width=\"200px\"]]\n\n**Incident Date:** December 17th, 1944.\n\n**Area of Command:** Central Pacific, Philippines theater.\n\n**Commanding Officer:** Admiral William Halsey.\n\n**Combatants:** US Third Fleet.\n\n**Hostiles:** Unknown, suspected Japanese Meteorological eigenweapon (Pentagram stance). Unknown Anomalous force designated SCP-8711 (Foundation stance).\n\n**Friendly losses/Casualties:** Three destroyers lost, 790 men killed or missing, 146 planes destroyed or severely damaged. Twenty-seven ships damaged, eleven requiring major repairs.\n\n**Hostile Losses:** Unknown.\n\n**Interview Date:** December 26th, 1944.\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Nyssa Eurylochus.\n\n**Interviewee:** Major Tiresias Smith, Paranatural asset officer and aerologist of USS Enterprise.\n\n**Foreword:** At 21:00 hours on December 16th, 1944, Admiral William Halsey ordered the US Third Fleet to sail due East out of effective combat range of Japanese aircraft into deep oceanic waters to conduct refueling and resupply operations. \n\nVessels near Guam, 1-2 weeks beforehand, reported unusually rough seas  and drops in barometric pressure, indicating the possible formation of a tropical depression; however, the system was believed to have dissipated due to changes in local pressure fronts, and the Fleet made minimal course adjustments as a result. At 06:00 hours on December 17th, Pacific Fleet command and Combined US Arms Command Philippines lost contact with US Third Fleet for approximately 24 hours. \n\nAs part of the tribunal reviewing the events of the Typhoon Cobra incident and initial evaluation of SCP-8711, the Foundation was allowed to question ranking officers and attached paranatural experts of the Fleet. The following is a mixed documentation and audio-visual log of the USS Enterprise's paranatural liaison and aerologist officer. \n\n------\n\n<**Begin Log**>\n\n> <**December 17th, material reality.

They attempt to follow //USS Iowa// around the reef, but the USS Intrepid reappears and admonishes the //Birmingham// for nearly colliding with them.\n> \n> //USS Alabama// reports the presence of a large landmass off its stern, and advises several wayward destroyers that suddenly appear in front of it to alter course.\n> \n> //USS Biloxi// and //USS Miami// both collide with unidentified wooden objects. \n>  \n> //USS Massachusetts// is forced to take evasive action to avoid colliding with shallow shoals. \n> \n> //USS Monterrey// promptly vanishes from in front of //USS New Orleans// and reappears in front of a large rock pillar, colliding with it. It reports the collision and several destroyers/destroyer escorts pull alongside to deploy tow lines. \n> \n> **0630:** Confusion ends as an unknown admiral orders all ships to clear radio channels and restores order. Most ships move free of shoals and reefs.\n> \n> **0631-0701:** Admiral Halsey is woken and arrives on station aboard the bridge of the //USS New Jersey//. All attending vessels are ordered to report in. \n\n//Dr. Eurylochus sits across an interview table from Major Smith.//\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Before we begin, I appreciate you speaking with me Major. I know the last week and a half has been extremely trying.\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Trying is certainly a word for it Ma'am. We all lost friends to the storm and that... //island//.\"\n\n//Several seconds of silence. Major Smith scratches the side of his head.//\n\n**Major Smith:** \"That's why you're here right? I've been questioned to death about the technical end, I tried to tell the brass, but they didn't much care to hear about the supernatural details beyond whether or not there were Japanese on the island.\"\n\n//Dr. Eurylochus smiles and pushes a glass bottle of Coca-Cola towards Major Smith.//\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Why don't we start from the top? I want you to focus on the anomaly. Distill as many of the small and big details as you can remember.\"\n\n//Major Smith pops the cap off the Coke.

Then, nothing.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Nothing? As in, everything was just normal?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"No, no, it was like, literally nothing. Oblivion. I was awake, conscious you know? I was aware I existed, but I couldn't see, couldn't hear, couldn't feel or smell. Like the whole shebang just came undone and I was just thoughts in a white void.

There was this oppressive feeling, like a million eyes were suddenly watching the idea of my consciousness. And there was this concept. Something old, very old, I'd say sorcerous even. Or maybe even witch-y? Yeah, more witch-y. Only got glimpses of it in the eternity, felt like an eternity you know? What you'd imagine the moments after death are before you're judged and sent to heaven or hell.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Let’s stay focused. Did you feel any hostility from this presence?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"No, I'd say it was more... curious? There might have been a bit of hunger, or predation mixed in. Mischief maybe?\" \n\n//Dr. Eurylochus writes down several more lines on her notepad.//\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Ok, before we continue, I want to show you some colors and symbols. Could you please tell me which ones most correspond to the feeling you got in the void?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Uh, sure?\"\n\n//Dr. Eurylochus cycles through multiple pieces of canvas brought into the room by a guard. Major Smith indicates Gold, Blue, and Purple. She then opens a folder on the table and shows him a large variety of symbols. He picks symbols for the Sun and herbs.// \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Excellent, this is very helpful. Ok, now can you tell me what happened next?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Right yeah. So right at 0601, don't ask me how I know, it was on the dot, it was like everything came screaming back. All the senses, and by god the light was murder. Instant chaos, people screaming, every radio on the bridge in an uproar. The Helmsman had to make an immediate bank to the starboard, there was a huge fucking rock prolly no more than half a mile ahead and thick, jagged shoals. And the tides, the current and waves were brutal, tossing us, a full-sized fleet carrier about like a rubber duck.\"\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"The rest of the fleet didn't have it much better it seems.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** //Runs a hand through his hair.// \"Yeah it was complete chaos. Heard a couple of cruisers rammed into rocks. Now I know how the boys at Samar must have felt when those pagoda masts popped up over the edge of the horizon.” \n\n//He pauses for several seconds.// \n\n**Major Smith:**  “Anyways, at about 0605 is when I noticed our detection equipment was going haywire. Every reading, every scale maxed out, and it did not let up. I had to turn on the ship-integrated detectors, and those readings were unbelievable. Surging and falling with the tide. Other liaisons had similar issues.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"When did you first notice the island?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"I'd say about 0610? Maybe 0615. The //'bama// saw it first, but the rest of us noticed pretty fast, given the currents kept trying to toss us towards it.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Ok, we'll come back to the island since I understand you went ashore briefly at the Marine's beachhead?\" \n\n//Major Smith shivers.// \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Yeah, I was. I drew the short lot, having a sixth sense.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** //Tilts her head.// \"You can sense magic?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"More or less. Mom came from a long line of witches, but she refused to take up the craft, got into church when she was young. But Grandma? Oh boy, now that was a witch. No, I see it on your face, not the pointy hat crooked noise kind, the Hecate tradition, potions and spells and boons from the gods. Always deep in the belief of myth and folklore. Father's side though, all down the line they were sailors.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Ah ha! So, your family is filled with belief in the strange and supernatural. Then you were already aware of the anomaly given your familiarity with the superstitions of sailors?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Only as much any other sailor is aware of it. I consider myself a scientist, well as much as you //can// science with magic or the weather. Sailor's superstitions exist for a reason, just as any myth or legend has some kernel of truth, but they are still just superstitions. I definitely didn't believe in this one until last Sunday.\" \n\n//Smith pauses and scratches behind one ear.// \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Well, I suppose that's a fooling really given my line of work.\" \n\n> **0702-0744:** Third Fleet vessels respond to roll calls and detail their status over the course of the next 45 minutes.\n> \n> Halsey receives the initial reports of anomalous activity and promptly dismisses paranatural experts. \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"You'd be surprised. So, you arrived at the Island, and next you were summoned to //New Jersey// to brief Halsey?\"\n\n//Smith scoffs.//\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Is this interview off the record?\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"No, but the Navy will be receiving a heavily edited and redacted version of the transcript.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Good. Yes, we were summoned to Jersey, and we stood around for 45 minutes while Halsey listened to the status of his ships, ignoring us. He heard one of our reports and immediately dismissed all of us. Accused us of being parasitic sycophants, and that the 1 in 10,000 occurrences of supernatural phenomena didn't justify the waste of manpower and resources we occupied. Bull indeed.\" \n\n> **Between 0746-0800 the following events and radio messages occurred.**\n> \n> //USS Intrepid// reports malfunctioning navigational equipment. \n> \n> //USS South Dakota// vanishes for fifteen seconds, and promptly reappears with its keel suspended seven meters above the water. It hovers for approximately seven seconds before being dropped back into the ocean, forcing multiple destroyers to heel away to prevent being capsized.\n> \n> //USS Alabama// reports its compasses 'spinning like a Ferris wheel' before promptly pointing towards the center of SCP-8711-1 at Alabama's stern.\n> \n> Admiral Willis Augustus Lee announces to the fleet that the //Washington//'s radar cross sections do not match the topographic visuals of the environment, and asks for other vessels to confirm. \n> \n> The //USS// Enterprise validates //Washington//'s readings before the oil tankers steaming alongside it vanish, and reappear one kilometer off its port bow, spinning like tops over the rough waves. It takes nearly ten minutes for them to regain control. \n> \n> **//USS New Jersey//, Admiral Halsey:** This is Halsey to the fleet. Be advised, all carriers are to dispatch float planes and scout craft. \n> \n> **//USS Spence//:** //Jersey// this is the Spence, are we to continue with refueling operations?\n> \n> **//USS New Jersey//:** Affirmative Spence. \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Fortunately it seems some of the 'brass' took you seriously.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Thank the gods for Admiral Lee, and the Carrier group admirals. When Halsey issued the order for scout planes to go up in the air, Evans asked me to ride along.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"And of course you took the opportunity?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"You bet I did. Things were already chaotic enough. I wasn't about to let us fly blind into an anomaly for whatever cockeyed plan the Bull might come up with. After Leyte Gulf, I don't think there were many people left in the fleet who fully trusted Halsey.\" \n\n> **0805:** All vessels are ordered to turn and sail ‘south’, away from the island. \n> \n> **0825** Third Fleet steams away from the landmass in standard formation into the wind.\n> \n> **0835:** Recon aircraft from the fleet and light carriers begin their scouting runs. \n> \n> **0845:** Smaller vessels low on fuel begin refueling attempts. \n> \n> **The following events occurred between 0845-1000**\n> \n> //USS New Orleans// crests a wave. Its hull is promptly accelerated to 100 km/hr, launching it out of the water briefly and causing several destroyer escorts to nearly capsize.\n> \n> //South Dakota// is tossed about for several minutes on rogue waves at least 30 m tall. At one point, the whole vessel capsizes underwater and then rolls back upright, and then repeats this motion three more times. No injuries are reported. \n> \n> //USS Witchita//'s rudder is, without the crew's knowledge, pushed hard right, forcing the helmsman to have to hold the rudder left to avoid being pinwheeled by the waves.\n> \n> **Unidentified Oil Tanker:** Disengage Hull, our fuel lines are snapping from the effort of trying to keep you alongside. \n> \n> **Unidentified Oil Tanker:** We're going to have to abandon side-by-side fueling, this isn't working, our lines are going to break.\n> \n> **//USS New Jersey//:** Vessels that need to refuel should revert to stern attempts until further notice. \n> \n> **0917-0944:** Fleetwide refueling attempts continue, despite repeated anomalous events. \n> \n> **0945:** Enterprise's spotter aircraft realizes after an hour and thirty minutes in the air that the fleet has ceased movement ~30 km away from the island.  \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Can you describe what you saw from the recon plane?\" \n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Reconnaissance Aircraft Topographical Report]]\n**Reconnaissance report, unidentified landmass associated with Typhoon Cobra incident.**\n\nLandmass was characterized as an island, exact dimensions impossible to determine due to atmospheric instability and changing geography, general estimation based on multiple reconnaissance flights of ~15-30 km at widest points. \n\nGeographically hilly, East, West and Southern coastal areas are characterized by gradually sloping forested ridges and grassy valleys with lighter forests and fields. \n\nSouthern coastal area appears to fluctuate between dense tropical jungles and swamps.

This strains the fuel lines attached to USS Spence, rubber banding the destroyer briefly and forcing it to unhook the lines and end its refueling attempt. \n> \n> **1020:** Admiral Halsey takes operational command of marine units assigned to Third Fleet vessels.\n> \n> **1021:** Halsey orders several Marine platoons ashore to conduct further reconnaissance operations to \"assess enemy fortifications and strength.\" \n> \n> **1025:** Paranatural liaisons advise against any sort of amphibious landing, due to the magnitude of ontological instability readings measured by primitive detection equipment and the ongoing anomalous events. \n> \n> **1030:** Halsey continues to ignore advisories of anomalous conditions. \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Right, did you experience that yourself? What was Halsey's reaction to your report?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"We didn't get any spatial instability while I was up there.\" //Smith pauses and gestures, frowning.// \"How do you think he reacted?\"\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Dismissal?\"\n\n//Smith nods.//\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"And then he took command of marines for further reconnaissance?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Against all of our advice.\" //Smith crosses his arms.// \"Look at how that ended up.\"\n\n> **Between 1035-1050 the following signal lamp messages were recorded:**\n> \n> **//USS Enterprise// to //USS Intrepid//:** Halsey ignoring anomalous reports, captain is ordering the Big E to initiate parathreat countermeasures. \n> \n> //USS Intrepid// doesn't immediately respond, as the aircraft carrier enters into a slow and gradual spin, before abruptly launching into the air while still spinning. She continues up into the sky vanishing into the clouds. Ten seconds later she reappears in her assigned formation position, as if nothing happened. \n> \n> **//USS Intrepid// to non-Jersey Vessels:** Severe paranatural events, potentially para-assault. Halsey ignoring all reports. Proceed at your own discretion in deploying para-assault countermeasures or risk being St. Lo'ed.[[footnote]]Reference to the escort carrier USS St. Lo which was sunk at the Battle of Samar by the Japanese center force due to the absence of Task Force 34, a consequence of Halsey's run to the north to chase down and sink the remaining Japanese carriers.[[/footnote]] \n> \n> **1050:** Halsey orders the fleet into a circling pattern, probing the edge of the anomaly for any potential 'exit' routes. \n> \n> **1100:** Additional reconnaissance aircraft are launched. Several briefly find themselves embedded underground in the island, before reappearing in the air with engines needing to be restarted.\n> \n> **1130:** Marine detachments are provided with sufficient rations for only 24-48 hours ashore due to the hasty deployment. \n> \n> **1200:** Marine detachments land in the eastern and southern portion of SCP-8711-1. \n> \n> **Reconnaissance aircraft Radio transmission:** We're experiencing strange phenomena up here.

So let's focus on your specific experiences.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Well the first thing is, that as soon as those Marines landed and went upriver, it was like the whole atmosphere of the bridge changed. Like something else was there with us. That same feeling of being watched, I could feel it and it kept every hair on my body standing straight up. Every time the Marines made a report over the radio, there was this... singing.\" \n\n> **1301-1330 Marine radio transmissions are recorded:** \n> \n> **Marine Party East:** Command, there's something happening out here. The local flora doesn't match anything I've seen before. There's also a lady singing somewhere upland of us, but we can't see her. \n> \n> **Marine Command:** Transmission received East, proceed inland and continue to document what you see. \n> \n> **Marine Party South:** Command, we've got people--, mass insubordination. We could use reinforcements and a PT boat to take the mutineers back to the beachhead.\n> \n> **Marine Command:** Understood South, dinghy is on its way. \n> \n> Marines experiencing compulsive effects regain their senses as soon as they are returned to the beachheads. They are ferried back to the exploration parties, experience the compulsive effect and are ferried back to the beachheads at least two more times.\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Singing?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Yeah. It was beautiful. Like I could sit there and listen to it for days on end and not need to eat or drink, it made me feel whole, full. Taken care of.\" //Smith briefly sniffles, wiping his eyes on his shirt sleeve.// \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"That was the compulsive effect?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"I'll never forget it. Guessing it was way more intense for the Marines given how many had to be brought back to the beachhead.\" \n\n//Several seconds of silence.//\n\n> \n> **1340:** Marines continue to move further inland. \n> \n> **1345:** Admiral Halsey ignores another report from paranatural liaisons indicating large-scale anomalous activity.\n> \n> **1350:** Two destroyers promptly vanish from alongside the New Jersey, and reappear thirty meters in the air. They begin slowly pirouetting while moving forward. The crews are forced to cling to any available surface to prevent being tossed into the water below. After approximately thirty seconds, the destroyers vanish, and reappear alongside the //New Jersey// again.\n> \n> **1355:** Marine party east has moved 1 km away from its river berth when it experiences a substantial ontokinetic shift, depositing them atop a forested hill. They report this to command, and backtrack, discovering the river has moved ~300 m away from its original position.\n> \n> **1357:** Continued refueling difficulties plague destroyers and destroyer escorts due to rough seas and ongoing anomalous events.\n> \n> **Marine Command:** Continue exploring East, we need as much detail about any potential encampment sites as possible.\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Oh, right. Then the whole thing with the Marines shooting into the air happened, and the bridge changed. Intense, it got real intense real fast.\"\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Can you describe it?\" \n\n> **Marine Party East:** Command we've encountered local fauna, wolves? \n> \n> **Marine Party South:** That lion is watching us.\n> \n> **Both Marine Parties:** //Gunshots.//\n> \n> **Marine Party East:** That didn't scare them off. \n> \n> **Marine Party South:** The lion is following us, and it has friends.\n\n**Major Smith:** \"It was this choking sense of anger pressing down against my chest. Breathing got very hard for a minute, and no not because the Jersey was suddenly underwater. That's when Halsey started talking to something. Well, talking, yelling really. He was pissed at the air. Maybe it was the Island itself, the anomaly or whatever was driving it. I just know //something// was there in the room with us.\" \n\n> **1400:** Admiral Halsey interrupts a briefing from a ranking officer, demanding to know \"Who are you!? How did you get on my ship?\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Were you able to see anything?\"\n\n> **1401:** The bridge crew of the New Jersey report Halsey to be \"staring into thin air.\" The flagship abruptly submerges, immediately dragged beneath the surface of the water. Crewmembers on the open parts of the ship's deck grab hold of anything within reach to avoid being pulled away by the surrounding current.\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Flashes. Colors, shifting fabric, rays of sunlight, a pot bubbling over an open fire, the crashing of the waves against the land. A silhouette if I really grasped at it, cloaked in the shadows of dark fires.\" \n\n> **1402:** Halsey: \"You're aboard my ship.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Could you make out any sounds or words?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"No, not really. Just shifting... I almost want to describe it as an aura, changing color in the open air. But it's hard to say for sure.\"\n\n> **1403:** Halsey: \"You're the commander of the local garrison?\" \n> \n> **1404:** Halsey: \"Commander, Third Fleet, William Halsey. Answer my question, are you or are you not a ███?\"[[footnote]]Slur redacted.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **1405:** Halsey: \"Yes I got that this is **your** home. Are you or are you not a ███[[footnote]]Slur removed.[[/footnote]] officer?\" \n> \n> **1405:** Foundation Liaison attempts to intervene and ask Admiral Halsey if he is seeing/hearing someone, and where.\n> \n> **1406:** Halsey ignores the liaison, and yells \"Remand this civilian to Quarters!\" \n> \n> **1407:** Foundation Liaison is escorted off the bridge, and secured in their quarters for the rest of the incident. Para-natural experts elect to remain uninvolved to avoid a similar fate. \n> \n> **1407:** Multiple ships abruptly swap places, resulting in the near collision of many vessels, and the actual collision of the Monterrey and an unidentified destroyer.\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Whatever it was, it really pissed Halsey off. Like his authority had just been challenged. Guess that's why he lashed out at your guy.\"\n\n> **1408:** Halsey: \"Your claimed identity is farcical. Not even someone who lived under a rock would miss the war going on at their door. You are either a █████-███[[footnote]]Slur removed.[[/footnote]] spy or a trickster.\"\n> \n> **1409:** Halsey: \"My men will discharge their weapons as their duty requires. I have the authority of the United States Navy and the might of the Third Fleet at my back and will not be stopped by some self-proclaimed witch.\" \n> \n> **1410:** Admiral Halsey points at an unspecified point on the bridge. \n> \n> **1410:** Halsey: \"Your warnings have no authority here. I will burn this entire island to the ground, raze its villages, scour the earth to root out your ███ occupiers! They will use you as shields, tools of terror. Give them to me now and save yourself or burn.\" \n> \n> **1411:** Halsey: \"Seize this spy and throw them in the brig!\" \n\n//Eurylochus scribbles several more lines in her notebook.//\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"So what happened at 14:12?\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Oh, I told him there was no-one there. Cause, there wasn't. At least not that I could see. Feel with thaumaturgic intuition? Yeah, sure. But not physically see. Besides, was he ever going to believe me? I was a sycophantic parasite remember?\" \n\n//Smith pauses, taking another sip from his Coke.// \n\n**Major Smith:** \"But man, the look on his face was so satisfying.\"\n\n> **1412:** Unnamed Bridge Officer: \"Sir, there is no one there.\" New Jersey abruptly resurfaces. \n> \n> **1413:** Halsey \"stares\" at the officer for ~20 seconds, before looking in the general direction he'd been talking at before. \n> \n> **1415:** Halsey orders the bridge back to stations.\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"What happened at 14:15?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"It stopped. The anger, and the weight. Like the eyes had shifted. Like whatever was there had left. Of course, you know the rest of the bridge crew looked at Halsey like he'd lost his marbles. I'm sure he saw whatever it really was.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"He's not been terribly forthcoming about what he saw.\"\n\n**Major Smith:** \"Bastard is probably trying to avoid getting discharged. Can't blame him for that, figure they'd label him unfit for duty. Be better for all of us though.\" \n\n> **Marine Party East:** Hey we're still being followed by these animals.\n> \n> **Halsey:** Continue scouting for enemy fortifications. They're just animals, and you have guns. \n> \n> **1430-1759:** Ontokinetic instability continues to alter terrain around scouting parties. Ontological conditions around Third Fleet stabilize. \n> \n> **1800:** Scouting parties establish perimeters and set up camps. \n> \n> **1801:** Local fauna continues to observe scouting parties. \n> \n> [Extraneous Events removed.]\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"This has been immensely helpful Major Smith.

It was like, one minute we'd be steaming, and the next we were suspended at the edge of a field, engines running hot, still going up and down the troughs, but not a damn difference in how far away from the island we were.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Then reports came in over the mixed frequencies from the Marine parties. Local wildlife destroyed their rations and ran off with their equipment in the night. My first thought was 'Well, somebody is pulling latrine duty for weeks.' How do you let a bunch of animals slip past your watch like that?\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"It does seem out of character for experienced Marines, no?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Yeah well, the stuff I was hearing on the 17th, and then reports on the 18th make me think they weren't any ordinary animals.\" \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"You're referring to the report around 0035?\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Well, that, the following behavior, and the equipment they recovered.

Notably, multiple ships again promptly switch places, causing several minor collisions. \n> \n> USS Franklin promptly disappears for ~45 seconds. She reappears, hovering over the USS Lexington, prompting panic amidst the task group, causing multiple ships, including the Lexington, to abruptly heel out of line to avoid collision.

A woman's voice, I'm pretty sure a woman because of the pitch and range, singing. It had an ethereal quality to it, clear and crystalline even over the sound of the engines and motors.

They didn't have field mages attached to screen anything, they should have, but they fucking didn't, all cause Halsey was too much of a bull.

It promptly identifies itself as the USS Damocles.[[footnote]]No US Naval vessel with that designation existed at the time.[[/footnote]] New Jersey's task group promptly scatters, but the aircraft carrier remains suspended above the New Jersey for the rest of the fleet's time in SCP-8711.\n> \n**1430:** Massed airstrikes begin their runs on relayed coordinates, moving to other villages to avoid ontological instability. \n> \n> **1500:** Spotters direct bombardment to other villages as firing lines become obstructed by terrain.\n> \n> **1515:** Third Fleet circles around the western portion of SCP-8711-1, forcing them to switch off targets on the eastern side.  USS Washington abruptly swaps places with a destroyer, causing a minor collision with the USS Langley. \n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** \"Right.

I think everyone but Halsey could feel it because there was a very sharp and rapid mood shift.\" \n\n> **1516-1530:** Halsey engages in a tense, one-sided, exchange with the bridge viewport. No surviving transcription of the conversation exists, due to the chaotic nature of surrounding events, but the multiple personal reports indicate that Halsey exclaimed \"Your consequences mean nothing!\" before handing command of further operations to Admiral Lee, believing the situation under control, and retiring to his quarters.\n\n**Dr. Eurylochus:** //Takes a sip from a glass of water.// \"Let's focus in on what happened at 1516.\" \n\n**Major Smith:** \"Oh, yeah.

Multiple complaints were filed with the US Department of the Navy for the reckless behavior which endangered US Third Fleet and any potential relationship with a new paranatural entity. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Aftermath:** A court of inquiry found Admiral Halsey responsible for the damage and loss of life due to SCP-8711 and the questionably connected Typhoon, but did not find it to be negligence, concluding they were errors made under the stress of war operations and seeking to meet military requirements. Halsey received no larger disciplinary admonishments. \n\nDr. Eurylochus submitted her report and log recordings to Foundation officials on the 28th of December, 1944 after the conclusion of the Court of Inquiry on the 26th. \n\nAdmiral Halsey would go on to become Fleet Admiral in the US navy. Despite multiple interviews by Foundation and early GOC personnel, Halsey never discussed the events within SCP-8711. \n\n-----\n\n**Additional Associated Phenomena:** On June 5th, 1945, Typhoon Viper, bearing similar anomalous characteristics to Typhoon Cobra, collided with US Third Fleet around Okinawa and caused significant damage to multiple ships. \n\nA third typhoon, with similar characteristics, hit the US fleet anchorage at Okinawa on October 8th and 9th, 1945 before curving northeast to hit mainland Japan. Typhoon Louise lost its anomalous characteristics after departing Okinawa. \n\n-----\n\n**Incident I-8711-02:** Dr. Eurylochus and Major Tiresias Smith secured a small Foundation research craft through duplicitous documentation on the 31st of December, 1944, and were last seen sailing due east from Ulithi at 03:00 local time by a fishing vessel. Their research vessel has never been recovered.\n\n-----\n\n**Suspected Incident I-8711-34:** On Sunday, the 9th of August, 1959, Admiral Halsey returned to his vacation home on Fisher's Island, New York. He discovered a pair of golden idols, one in the shape of a bull with markings of the sun engraved into its sides, and one in the shape of a pig, meticulously placed on his front porch. \n\nHis wife, who was present at the time, told investigators that when he reached down to pick up the idols 'a cloud of dust stirred and flew about his head for a few seconds like crazed bomber pilots' before vanishing. These objects were seized posthumously by Foundation agents and designated Object of Interest 8711-01 and -02.\n\nA note was found on a small slip of paper bound to the Bull, reading: \n\n> A viper always strikes when its prey is least suspecting.\n\nAdmiral Halsey died at 0600, sunrise, on Sunday,  August 16th, 1959 from a massive heartattack. Subsequent investigation discovered trace elements of a previously unknown toxic compound on both objects of interest. \n\n----\n[[=]]\n+ [[[The Lion the Sun Witch and the Warlock | Supplementary Logs SL-8711-01]]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/The-City-Sings| previous-title=The City Sings\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lion-the-sun-witch-and-the-warlock | next-title=The Lion The Sun Witch and the Warlock\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/With-The-Old-Gods-hub| hub-title=With the Old Gods Hub\n]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Typhoon Cobra, 18 December 1944 east of Luzon.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Typhoon_Cobra,_18_December_1944_east_of_Luzon.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/USS_Langley_%28CVL-27%29_during_Typhoon_Cobra%2C_December_1944.jpg?20070105131432\n\n> **Filename:** USS Cowpens (CVL-25) during Typhoon Cobra.jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Cowpens_(CVL-25)_during_Typhoon_Cobra.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** USS Santa Fe (CL-60) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/USS_Santa_Fe_%28CL-60%29_during_Typhoon_Cobra%2C_December_1944.jpg?20070105131624\n\n> **Filename:** USS Anzio (CVE-57) rolling heavily during Typhoon Cobra, 17 December 1944 (80-G-298079).jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/USS_Anzio_%28CVE-57%29_rolling_heavily_during_Typhoon_Cobra%2C_17_December_1944_%2880-G-298079%29.jpg/763px-USS_Anzio_%28CVE-57%29_rolling_heavily_during_Typhoon_Cobra%2C_17_December_1944_%2880-G-298079%29.jpg?20200717190507\n\n> **Filename:** Oil tanker trying to move into refueling position during Typhoon Cobra.jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oil_tanker_trying_to_move_into_refueling_position_during_Typhoon_Cobra.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Unidentified Allen M Sumner class destroyer in heavy seas during Typhoon Cobra.jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unidentified_Allen_M_Sumner_class_destroyer_in_heavy_seas_during_Typhoon_Cobra.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** USS Massachusetts (BB-59) forecastle in typhoon 1944.jpg\n> **Author:** USN\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Massachusetts_(BB-59)_forecastle_in_typhoon_1944.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Radar images of Typhoo Cobra development, December 1944.jpg\n> **Author:** US Navy Employee\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radar_images_of_Typhoo_Cobra_development,_December_1944.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** SB2C Helldiver on USS Kwajalein (CVE-98) in a typhoon 1944.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SB2C_Helldiver_on_USS_Kwajalein_(CVE-98)_in_a_typhoon_1944.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Flight deck of USS Bennington (CV-20) damaged by typhoon, 12 June 1945.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flight_deck_of_USS_Bennington_(CV-20)_damaged_by_typhoon,_12_June_1945.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Wrecked aircraft on USS Attu (CVE-102) after typhoon in June 1945.jpg\n> **Author:** USN\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wrecked_aircraft_on_USS_Attu_(CVE-102)_after_typhoon_in_June_1945.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** USS Windham Bay (CVE-92) typhoon damage.jpg\n> **Author:** Bruce Blegen\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Windham_Bay_(CVE-92)_typhoon_damage.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** IDA EYE.jpg\n> **Author:** CIA employee\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IDA_EYE.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Bow of USS Pittsburgh (CA-72) under tow toward Guam in June 1945.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bow_of_USS_Pittsburgh_(CA-72)_under_tow_toward_Guam_in_June_1945.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** USS Wasp CV-18 thypoon damage 1945.jpg\n> **Author:** U.S. Navy (This image is part of a photograph album that was acquired by RADM Joseph C.
