Get the nerves out of my system. \"God\" can help with that, and all.\n\n**SCP-343:** Indeed, but I would be hesitant to call myself that. Though I understand why everyone seems to prefer such nomenclature.\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** It would be a reasonable explanation for how an anomaly I've never met before knows my name without prior introductions.\n\n//SCP-343 chuckles.//\n\n**SCP-343:** When --\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** What?\n\n**SCP-343:** Hmm?\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** Your laugh.

It's also true that I have both seen and have been able to do more in my lifetime than any regular person could accomplish if they had all of eternity. But, well, ascribing it to \"God\" may be over-emphasizing the types of parlor tricks I am able to accomplish.\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** So... why did they start calling you God?\n\n**SCP-343:** When the Foundation first contained me, it was merely a joke I came up with to keep myself amused. Of course, they asked me to prove it. All it took was walking out and coming back with a hamburger for them to believe such.\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** Come on.\n\n**SCP-343:** Oh, but it's true. You would have needed to read my documentation before interviewing me, correct?\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** I'm not new to this job. The presented truth isn't always as real as it seems on the surface.\n\n**SCP-343:** So similarly, would you say that reality isn't as truthful as it appears to be?\n\n**[RIVENCLARK]:** I... well, um...
