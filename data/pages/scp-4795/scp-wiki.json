Foundation parazoologists regularly track pigeon flock movement through the Kanz Park area to assess population numbers. Park signs warning against pigeon aggression have been installed in and around Kanz Park to reduce the likelihood of pigeon attacks on civilians.\n----\n**Description:** SCP-4795 is Kanz Park, a 2.5-km² recreational park located in southern Cairo, Egypt.\n\nSCP-4795's anomalous properties manifest in its attraction of domestic pigeons (//Columba livia domestica//), which flock to the park's premises in large volumes. Between 400 and 600 pigeons (designated **SCP-4795-1**) currently reside within the park. When in close proximity of humans, SCP-4795-1 display a marked increase in aggression, tending toward seeking out and attacking humans in possession of food.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**I. Discovery**\n\nIn the early 2010s, Cairo's municipal government reported a dramatic increase in pigeon populations, along with the prevalence of pigeon flocks using sophisticated attack techniques[[footnote]]i.e. stealth, tactical grouping, and the hierarchy of command.[[/footnote]] against other flocks. This culminated in March 2014 following the pigeon-mating season, when an observed convergence of tens of thousands of pigeons (comprising hundreds of rival flocks) organized and attacked one another within the Kanz Park area.\n\nRegional Foundation parazoologists noticed Kanz Park's use as a focal point and classified it as **E-08298** while designating increased social intelligence and aggression in pigeon populations as **E-08298-1**. The case was later forwarded to the [[[scp-3095|Avian Division]]] for its immense importance to inter-avian relations. Cairo-based Foundation officials flew Dr. Guenevere Goshawk, then-Envoy to the Avian Division, out to Egypt to foster positive pigeon relationships. Dr. Goshawk was charged with placating the population and determining what power structure had emerged -- if any.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   a.

Nour. Dr. Goshawk conducted the interview in an Egyptian-avian dialect and translated it into English.\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n**Dr. Guenevere Goshawk:** Sergeant Nour, was it? I am Doctor Guenevere Goshawk. Thank you for agreeing to discuss this with me this evening.\n\n**Sgt. Nour:** The pleasure is all yours, miss! You get to bless your eyes with my magnificent presence!\n\n**Goshawk:** Sergeant, I was actually hoping you could answer some questions for me.\n\n**Nour:** Hmm, what //questions// do you speak of, my dear? @@[@@//He holds a wing over his beak.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** I am interested in Kanz Park. Why are pigeons flocking there in thousands?\n\n**Nour:** My, whatever do you mean, miss? That is what we pigeons do! @@[@@//He stretches his wings outwards.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** I am not stupid; do not play games with me. Tell me what you know regarding the flocks of pigeons at Kanz Park.\n\n**Nour:** We just flock together! Silly bird, do you not see that?\n\n**Goshawk:** If you listen to me and answer my questions, I will reward you with some bread.\n\n**Nour:** @@[@@//He coos.//@@]@@ Ta-//da//!

He eats it whole.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** Good. Now, what do you know about the flock of pigeons in Kanz Park?\n\n**Nour:** Hmm, it is a source of food! The humans like to save their food for sacred entities such as us -- they are too pathetic to wield it for themselves. Thoth created this park for us, and so we must protect it.\n\n**Goshawk:** Did you say... Thoth?\n\n**Nour:** Yes, my darling, yes! Thoth is our lord and savior -- he introduced us to the treasure!\n\n**Goshawk:** Treasure?\n\n**Nour:** //The// treasure, yes. It's our food! And Thoth chose //me// to share the message! My messengers and I share his message with pigeons worldwide! I am luminous! My name says so.\n\n**Goshawk:** Uhm, I think you've shared enough. Thank you for talking to me.\n\n**Nour:** Thoth be with you!\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n----\n**NOTE:** Dr. Goshawk's efforts across March and April 2014 led to E-08298-1's current flock taking permanent residence in Kanz Park. The current flock displays moderate aggression toward human occupation; though, no further pigeon or human injuries resulting from E-08298-1 attacks have been documented.\n\nA human investigation into E-08298 is now underway.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   b.

Extended Communications**\n\nThough the study of E-08298 occurred mainly through Foundation plants within Cairo's Parks and Recreation Department, Site-76's Command Office found it necessary to assume control over the project. Starting in late April 2014, several budgetary and personnel cuts were made. Site-76's administration eventually declared the anomaly as self-containing. After issuing the current Special Containment Procedures, site officials ordered the Foundation Parazoology Division personnel to cease their operations.\n\nInternal correspondences were transmitted during this time.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   ▷ Site-76 correspondences\" hide=\"△ Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"warning-notice tacTheo justified\"]]\n= [[span style=\"font-size: 150%;\"]]**OFFICE OF TACTICAL THEOLOGY**[[/span]]\n+++ STOP WORK ORDER 4795.001\n----\nUnder the Command of Site-76 Assistant Director Soliman al-Ghali, the Tactical Theology Office has been granted full control over Kanz Park and will undergo immediate occupation for reasons of the reclamation of a Beirut-Tier religious artifact. All associated Foundation personnel within the **Parazoology Division** are to vacate the premises for the undertaking of an important archaeological survey.\n\nAs well, E-08298 is pending reclassification to SCP-4795.

Incident Log**\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n+++ INCIDENT LOG 4795-ALEPH\n----\nOn the early morning of May 18, 2014, archaeological surveyors arrived on the premises of Kanz Park with dowsing equipment to locate a suspected Beirut-Tier religious artifact. During this time, SCP-4795-1 instances evaded archaeologists and perched in high locations around the park. Archaeologists soon determined that an artifact was located beneath the center of the park and began excavation. SCP-4795-1 instances fled the park.\n\nOn May 25, archaeologists located a clay statue of an ibis bird wielding a long, narrow, and gold and beryllium bronze ankh staff in its beak. When the site supervisor deemed the excavation pit stable, workers descended to retrieve the artifact by hand but found that visibility in the pit had reduced dramatically.\n\nA large flock of an estimated 30,000 pigeons amassed above the park and attacked.\n\nMost pigeons surrounded Kanz Park to prevent workers from leaving, while others defecated from a high altitude. In response, the containment team attempted to enter the park but met extreme opposition and experienced extensive injuries. In the resulting commotion, the artifact's whereabouts could not be located. Within the hour, the pigeons evaded Kanz Park with minor casualties.\n\nThough the artifact had been lost, the containment team managed to secure several SCP-4795-1 instances and relocated them to Site-76 for study. Agents discovered that SCP-4795-1 instance “Sgt. Nour” was among the captured pigeons and intended on carrying out an interrogation. However, without the proper avian communications equipment (which was under the possession of the Parazoology Division), no further actions could be taken.\n\nOn May 30, through correspondence with the Mediterranean Regional Command, Envoy Dr. Guenevere Goshawk requested to assist with the interrogation. Dr. Goshawk was transported to Site-76 with diplomatic clearance.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   ▷ Interview 4795.1\" hide=\"△ Close\"]]\n**NOTE:** Containment staff had placed Sgt. Nour in a cage prior to his interrogation.\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n**Dr. Guenevere Goshawk:** Hello again, Sergeant. It has been quite some time.\n\n**Sgt. Nour:** @@[@@//He slumps his head and covers his face with a wing.//@@]@@ Now that you sport your true feathers, I see just how odious you are. With that fast-talking beak, explain why //I// am sitting here in this cage and //you// are out there -- flying free!\n\n**Goshawk:** It was with my charge that you and your fellow pigeons would be protected. I failed my duty. I'm sorry. But now–\n\n**Nour:** @@[@@//He jumps at the cage.//@@]@@ Odor on your tongue and still you beg. Go on, then -- beg! You will be begging from a perch in the Underworld! Feel its wrath and cry out for the Sacred One. Face a thousand birds of prey, and only with his mirth may your apology be accepted. But not by me!\n\n**Goshawk:** Advise me, then. What is the real reasoning behind Thoth's dominion over Kanz Park? It is //not// just for food, is it?\n\n@@[@@//Sgt. Nour stares in silence.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** You are inside this cage, not me. I am working for your freedom, but no one else. Why do you think I've come here -- to taunt you? For what purpose?\n\n@@[@@//Sgt. Nour continues to stare.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** I am not your enemy. I am just like you. @@[@@//She hops closer to the cage and speaks in a low tone.//@@]@@ Look at what humans do to your kind. Around the world, in places just like Kanz Park, they see you as filth. Here in Cairo, they train and race you like sport. They breed your brothers, sisters, and cousins in pens, and then they treat //you// as the food. They eat //you//.\n\n@@[@@//Sgt. Nour squawks.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** I don't do any of that. If I had my way, //all// the humans and birds of this world would flock together.\n\n**Nour:** But they do not have wings! They cannot seek food as I can.\n\n**Goshawk:** @@[@@//She pauses.//@@]@@ You're right. But they have something you do not. They don't have to seek food as you do -- they can make their own.\n\n**Nour:** Heresy! @@[@@//He leaps from his perch and jumps around.//@@]@@ How? If you seek no food, you will have no crumbs of bread inside your head. How can they do this?\n\n**Goshawk:** I had a feeling you would want to know. That's the only //real// difference between you and them, I think. You don't know how to make food of your own, so you take the food of others. That is how odor and deceit find their way in -- because you don't know any better.\n\n**Nour:** This is not from Thoth. Where did you get this?\n\n@@[@@//Dr. Goshawk lowers her neck and peers through the cage at his eye level.//@@]@@\n\n**Goshawk:** I can teach you.\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n----\n**CLOSING REMARKS:** //I want to take some SCP-4795-1 instances under my wing. I can teach them how to become more civilized. Whether that leads them to relinquish your artifact is none of my concern. The stability of their flock, however, is.//\n\n//I realize now that Nour and his pigeons would never be content with just food. No, they seek knowledge, too -- they just don't know it yet.
