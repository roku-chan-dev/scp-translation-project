SCP-088-PT is to be constantly monitored and contained within a 4m³ containment chamber on Site-PT33, inside a standard container for inanimate objects. As it is impossible to load the object with ammunition, SCP-088-PT requires only standard maintenance and hygiene procedures while in its inactive state.\n\nUpon indication of the occurrence of an 088-Σ Event, it is to be assumed that SCP-088-PT has entered its active state and that SCP-088-PT-1 will appear in exactly 2 minutes to equip SCP-088-PT. Those responsible for this observation are to alert all personnel involved in containment through the on-site standard communications systems that an 088-Σ Event has begun (for more information regarding 088-Σ Events, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-01).\n\nSTF PT22-Γ is responsible for the establishment of a 500m perimeter around SCP-088-PT. This perimeter must not contain any individual that placed in any region to the left of the y-axis as determined by the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates (for more information regarding the test, personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 may refer to Document 088-02). All personnel within the perimeter must be trained to react efficiently to the protocols of an 088-Σ Event. STF PT22-Γ is authorised to investigate and repel any efforts to violate SCP-088-PT's containment, and to employ lethal force in the case that it is necessary to maintain containment.\n\nUpon the occurrence of an 088-Σ Event, individuals within the perimeter must safely conclude or halt their current activities and salute; if approached by SCP-088-PT-1, personnel are to address the entity as \"Sergeant Rocha\", and treat the entity with all the conventions of this title. The 088-Σ Event will only be considered concluded when a new communication announces the dematerialisation of SCP-088-PT-1.\n\nNo personnel may enter SCP-088-PT's containment chamber during an 088-Σ event or within 6 hours after its conclusion.\n\n------\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-pt-br.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-088-pt/SCP-088-PT.jpg|align=center|width=500px|caption=SCP-088-PT in its inactive state.]]\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-088-PT is a semi-automatic rifle M1 Garand approximately dated to the 1960s, with a mass of 4.2 kg and a length of 1.1m. The rifle has been modified to shoot .458 calibre Winchester ammunition.\n\nIn its inactive state, SCP-088-PT does not differ from an ordinary M1 Garand rifle. However, when the object is activated, its appearance is spontaneously modified following an apparently random period of time. No means to prevent or control this process are currently known.\n\nIn its active state, SCP-088-PT appears as an extremely deteriorated firearm with damage consistent with a weapon used excessively in combat without proper maintenance. A roughly carved phrase will appear in its stock, reading \"THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMIES\"; in addition, several marks are carved into the rifle apparently counting the number of individuals terminated by SCP-088-PT. However, according to information obtained by Dr. Nascimento in interviews with 088-PT-1, the actual number of neutralised individuals is closer to [REDACTED].\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 denotes the entity that is manifested when SCP-088-PT is activated. SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to a male human, dressed in a uniform traditionally worn by the soldiers that comprised the Força Expedicionária Brasileira (FEB, or Brazilian Expeditionary Force) during the Second World War. SCP-088-PT-1 appears to be approximately 40 years of age, with a tanned complexion, voluminous moustache and beard, and dishevelled hair.\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is able to interact physically with its surroundings and environment despite being completely incorporeal. X-rays, thermographic equipment, and other methods of detection thus far utilised by the Foundation are unable to detect the entity. SCP-088-PT-1 considers itself the \"owner\" of SCP-088-PT and is the only individual capable of appropriately utilising the object. When equipped by SCP-088-PT-1, SCP-088-PT also becomes incorporeal.\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is capable of using SCP-088-PT as an ordinary M1 Garand rifle; however, it has never been seen to reload the weapon, generating projectiles apparently without source or trace. The projectiles fired from SCP-088-PT are not propelled by powder or made of lead, but rather appear to be completely incorporeal and propelled by an unknown force. Therefore, targets shot by SCP-088-PT rarely survive their injuries.\n\nIt is theorised that SCP-088-PT-1 is identical in appearance to the late Sergeant ████ Rocha, as he resided in the same location where SCP-088-PT was originally discovered. Additional data has been catalogued by Dr. Nascimento derived from a diary found in [DATA EXPUNGED]. For more information, refer to Document [REDACTED].\n\nDetails regarding SCP-088-PT-1's behaviour may be accessed by personnel with a Security Clearance Level 3/088 in Document 088-01.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Document 088-01: Security Clearance Level 3/088 is required to access these files.\" hide=\"- Access granted.\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS CONFIDENTIAL AND CLASSIFIED AS 01/088.\n----\n+++ ATTEMPTS TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 3/088 AUTHORISATION WILL BE REGISTERED AND WILL RESULT IN A DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Preface:** The following document depicts the extension of the Foundation's knowledge regarding the nature of SCP-088-PT, SCP-088-PT-1 and 088-Σ Events.\n\n**Document 088-01:** An 088-Σ Event comprises the observation of the deterioration of SCP-088-PT and the subsequent appearance of SCP-088-PT-1. --What triggers these events is currently unknown-- These events are triggered by the introduction of a politically-left-leaning individual within a 500m radius of SCP-088-PT. An 088-Σ event happens sporadically and irregularly when these conditions are met. Researchers are still trying to decipher a pattern for these seemingly random occurrences of 088-Σ Events.\n\nDuring 088-Σ Events, SCP-088-PT-1 behaves similarly to how an actual drill sergeant would act when inspecting soldiers, a behaviour which masquerades its intention to search for any individual with left-leaning tendencies within the aforementioned 500m perimeter. When identified by SCP-088-PT-1, such an individual will be promptly executed via the use of SCP-088-PT; SCP-088-PT will, without exception, label the individual as \"a filthy commie\", even if the target did not technically have left-wing beliefs that corresponded to communism. Those attempting to defend people attacked by SCP-088-PT-1 will be regarded in the same manner and be similarly targeted. The Foundation currently does not understand how SCP-088-PT-1 detects the political affiliation of individuals within the perimeter.\n\nThose without a left-leaning political bias have little to no risk while interacting with SCP-088-PT-1, so long as they treat it as their hierarchically superior military officer, do not possess objects or a demeanour that leads to SCP-088-PT-1 suspecting of such a bias, and do not attempt to help those attacked by SCP-088-PT-1. Failure to maintain these protocols will result in targeting by SCP-088-PT-1.\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 is able to teleport instantaneously to any location within the established 500m perimeter (an action performed frequently during the object's active state). It is effectively impossible to track SCP-088-PT-1 or block its entrance from any specific location within the perimeter. In addition, SCP-088-PT-1 is capable of changing the epicenter of the aforementioned perimeter to its current position. However, such an occurrence has only been observed when SCP-088-PT-1 had to pursue one of its targets past the 500m radius.\n\nSCP-088-PT-1 will always complete its pursuit at Dr. Nascimento's office (one of the personnel responsible for the containment of SCP-088-PT), after speaking with every human being within the established perimeter and executing those that did not conform to the mentioned parameters. SCP-088-PT-1 will leave SCP-088-PT to his care, as it considers him the \"most-competent subordinate available\". Dr. Nascimento --must be present in his office during 088-Σ Events-- is responsible for transporting SCP-088-PT back to its containment chamber following the conclusion of an 088-Σ Event. When any human that is not Dr. Nascimento enters the containment chamber during this period, a new 088-Σ Event will be initiated, and the perpetrator subsequently eliminated.\n\n--If Dr. Nascimento is not present in his office during the conclusion of an 088-Σ  Event, SCP-088-PT-1 will become hostile, attacking [DATA EXPUNGED]-- On 20/12/20██, Dr. Nascimento entered into an agreement between himself and SCP-088-PT-1: SCP-088-PT was to be left on his desk in the case of his absence; no other individual may touch SCP-088-PT or a new 088-Σ Event will be initiated, resulting in the manifestation of a new perimeter around the object, and the subsequent elimination of the perpetrator. Dr. Nascimento remains the only individual allowed to enter SCP-088-PT's containment chamber during the six hours following the conclusion of an 088-Σ Event.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Document 088-02: Security Clearance Level 3/088 is required to access these files.\" hide=\"- Access Granted.\"]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS CONFIDENTIAL AND UNDER 02/088 CLASSIFICATION\n----\n+++ ATTEMPTS TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 3/088 AUTHORISATION WILL BE REGISTERED AND WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-pt-br.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-088-pt/politica2english.png| caption=A simplified example result from the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates.]]\n\n**Preface**: Document 088-02 details the Foundation Test for Political Coordinates developed by Dr. Mirtes and Dr. Nascimento.\n\n\n**Document 088-02**: The Foundation Test for Political Coordinates consists of a series of questions specifically formulated by Dr. Mirtes under the supervision of Dr. Nascimento, and based on several studies of [DATA EXPUNGED]; at this moment, it is the most-effective test to determine the political bias/orientation of a human being, having a success rate of ██.█%.\n\nThe complete results of the test are extraordinarily complex for personnel without specific knowledge in mathematics and political science to understand; thus, a simple representation in a Cartesian coordinate system has been created, an image of which has been attached to this document. The ordinated (y) axis determines how authoritarian or libertarian the individual that performed the test is, the abscissae (x) axis determines whether the individual is left-leaning or right-leaning. The intersection point of the lines is thus the point of origin.\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-088-PT, personnel that report a negative score in the abscissae axis must not participate in any way in the containment of SCP-088-PT, as detailed above. The score in the ordinated axis is irrelevant for the containment of SCP-088-PT.\n\nThe questions for the tests required to determine the political orientation of an individual may be accessed in Document 088-██.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 088-01 - Discovery:** SCP-088-PT was discovered in ████████, Minas Gerais, Brazil by a driver that passed through the apparently deserted city; shortly thereafter, finding several corpses.\n\nThe anomaly was located by the Foundation after agents infiltrating the PMMG (Polícia Militar de Minas Gerais, or Minas Gerais State Military Police) reported the new 088-Σ Events that were triggered during police investigation. The Foundation, with new information about the anomalous effects of SCP-088-PT, managed to contain the object without further incidents.\n\nThe proximity of Site PT33 to the city of ████████ decreased the probability of new 088-Σ Events occurring during the transportation of the object to containment. The surviving civilians that witnessed SCP-088-PT-1 were administered Class-B amnestics.\n\nIt is theorised that several 088-Σ Events occurred sequentially due a political rally led by a notorious left-leaning Brazilian political party in the city, leading to the annihilation of all human life in a radius of approximately ███ kilometres. The city of ████████ had 5,830 inhabitants prior to the occurrence of the event, with only 1,627 surviving. Standard disinformation protocols and procedures are currently being put into effect.",
