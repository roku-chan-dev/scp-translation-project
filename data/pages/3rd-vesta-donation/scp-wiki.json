The Kashimir-13 handlers must have been regaled with an incredible sight. The growing structures may look ghastly at first and their smell can be unpleasant and irritating; yet their capacities make up for any inconveniences! The thought of entire cities built of the stuff is enough to make one shiver.\n@@        @@Past week I gave you an impression on the characteristics of the Mason Mold and its specialized organelle, the Laviano Grid; while I can't confirm it at the time, Ruperts-2 suspects it works as the equivalent of mitochondria for the Mold, an organelle it lacks. I also believe it has other functions we have yet to confirm. I think the control-linking process that allow us to connect the VESTA application to it and allows it to cast a wireless signal for us to latch on is based on the Grid.\n@@        @@Today, however, I want to talk about the two problems we face when using the donation. The first one is the most evident: we must be discreet and this donation makes that hard for us. The Kashimir Programme had to be closed down because growing cities draw too much attention and, expectedly, are difficult to hide unless we have full cooperation from local authorities. \n@@        @@To avoid that security problem, I recommend we use the 3^^rd^^VD to produce static structures, yes, but to program the seeds with smaller, individual structures instead of large, sprawling, self-generating urban areas. Isolated vital buildings may be erected in days (or weeks, at most) this way.\n@@        @@The second problem is the safety concerns inherent to the 3^^rd^^VD. The Mason Mold is programmable thanks to the VESTA v.3.0.1 software, but not controllable at a cellular scale; could it be an infectious element? While the Vesta Conglomerate produces wonderful Abnormal Assets, we must remember what happened with the First Vesta Donation and its effects when it passed over to something so inconsequential as a wheat crop. \n@@        @@While we have confirmed the 3^^rd^^VD is incapable of affecting plant life, I do not wish to test its effects on living animals. However, our colleagues at Ruperts-2 warn us that its is preferable to cover a seeded place as best as possible while the desired building grows. Special care is to be put in stopping animals, particularly plant-eating mammals, from reaching the growing 1-Vesta items. We are told they react poorly to them.\n@@        @@Today we managed to grow a small, cubic room with a metal door and a fixed window. Unfortunately, as this was the result of an overriding of the original designs of the v.3.0.1 software, the room had current water, electric output... and no way to cycle its air.\nWe will be working on that.
