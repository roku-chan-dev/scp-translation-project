The file occupying the wider Foundation's SCP-7777 slot is not to contain any of this file's addenda or its image. Furthermore, it must contain minimal information regarding the anomaly itself or its true containment procedures.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-7777 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting random number generators (RNGs) utilized by the SCP Foundation. SCP-7777 can manifest in any RNG that both continuously creates output and is not, at the time of manifestation, being monitored directly by a sapient individual.[[footnote]]It should be noted that SCP-7777 appears to affect pseudo-random number generators and \"true\" random number generators equally.[[/footnote]]\n\nWhen an RNG comes under the effects of SCP-7777, it will immediately begin to produce a series of 7s interspersed with 0s at seemingly random intervals. This will continue for an unspecified duration, before abruptly ceasing. After an SCP-7777 event concludes, the RNG will continue to output as normal, with no detectable differences.\n\n--Thus far, the meaning behind SCP-7777, if any, is unclear.-- See below.\n\n----\n= **Addendum One — Discovery**\n----\n\nSCP-7777 was initially discovered on January 28th, 2018, following the presumed malfunction of a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3557 CK-Class Scenario Detector] (CSD). The device's internal pseudo-RNG had deviated significantly from its synchronized counterpart, indicating a potential CK-Class Scenario had occurred. When Technician Davis Silverstein (who was nearby at the time) checked the CSD's pRNG output, he discovered an abnormal pattern consisting entirely of 7s and 0s and reported it to a colleague, Dr. [EXPUNGED]. \n\nDr. [EXPUNGED] quickly informed the other members of his research team stationed in Site-17, including a member of the Department of Analytics Senior Researcher [EXPUNGED], who requested Dr. [EXPUNGED] receive a copy of the pRNG's output. With assistance from Davis, they were able to copy the abnormally generated numbers onto a separate drive, and forward the information to the Department of Analytics. The phenomenon was classified and catalogued provisionally as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/log-of-extranormal-events EE]-770707.\n\nFaced with a number of urgent assignments, the department relegated EE-770707 to low-priority. As a result, the phenomenon was not researched for an additional three weeks, until Dr. [EXPUNGED] requested a follow-up. As Senior Researcher [EXPUNGED] was off-site, the assignment was given to Junior Researcher [EXPUNGED].\n\nAfter attempting various methods of analysis on the data, eventually [EXPUNGED] determined that the number of 7s between each 0 present in the pattern never exceeded 255. Under the assumption the numbers may be referring to the value of bytes, they translated the values into ASCII characters. The following is the resultant message.\n\n[[div style=\"width: 75%; margin: auto;\"]]\n> = [[size 85%]]{{Site Director Franklyn Garnett murdered Dr. Theresa Booth on March 11th, 2003, by replacing her medication with Compound Y-909 and framing it as amnestic overdose.}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\nUpon decoding the message, [EXPUNGED] panicked and emailed the Department of Analytics' Ethics Committee Liaison, Flora Marinos. After several hours, Liaison Marinos read the email and immediately reported the findings to the Ethics Committee proper. The Ethics Committee launched an investigation into Site-85 Director Franklyn Garnett, as Dr. Theresa Booth was indeed confirmed to have died from severe Class-C amnestic overdose on March 11th, 2003. The Records And Information Security Administration (RAISA) was tasked with locating the exact origin of the report.\n\nThe official explanation for the death at the time was that Dr. Booth had suffered from a traumatic sibling loss one month prior, and unsuccessfully attempted to use Class-C amnestics to erase the memories of how they died. However, review of archived security camera footage revealed that approximately three minutes of footage were removed from various tapes — including the hallway directly outside Dr. Booth's living quarters — on the day prior to her death. \n\nWith this knowledge, the Ethics Committee suspended Director Garnett's clearance provisionally as the investigation continued. However, shortly thereafter Director Garnett noticed the change and began to flee the site, unsuccessfully. When later detained, he confessed that he had indeed murdered Dr. Booth, in order to prevent her from coming forward to the Ethics Committee with embezzlement charges against him. In light of the confession, all pay was deducted from Franklyn Garnett's Foundation accounts, and he was amnesticized and removed from the Foundation permanently.\n\nSince this event, over 37 new instances of SCP-7777 have appeared in Foundation RNGs.\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum Two — Abridged Log of SCP-7777 Instances**\n\n----\n\nThe following is an abridged list of SCP-7777 instances that the Ethics Committee recorded since the initial discovery of the anomaly.\n\n> [[div style=\"font-size: 85%\"]]\n> **Instance ID #:** 7777-2\n> \n> **Date:** February 3rd, 2018\n> \n> **Discovery:** Instance 7777-2 appeared in a pRNG being run alongside [https://scpwiki.com/scp-1214 SCP-1214][[footnote]]SCP-1214 is a pseudo-random character generator which eventually deviates from random generation and produces predictable and coherent sentences.[[/footnote]], during tests by the Department of Analytics to determine the differentiation between SCP-1214 and standard RNGs.

Using various tactics, they've successfully managed to fool a majority of the Foundation's leadership — including the Ethics Committee and even us, for a time — into believing SCP-7777 is a real, anomalous phenomenon which cannot be controlled. Only recently have some of us caught on, including the at-large O5-6, who attempted to uproot the project at its source — completely unaware his plan had already been compromised, and used to trigger his own downfall.\n\nNonetheless, the Ethics Committee is completely in the dark about SCP-7777's true nature. I intend to keep it this way. I have reason to suspect that their intentions aren't as pure as they'd like us to believe; much of our data on what occurred have been through their reports, and they conveniently paint a pretty picture that the Ethics Committee overthrew a corrupt O5 Council. \n\nBut a whistle-blowing service wouldn't be necessary to begin with if the Ethics Committee was //actually fighting corruption//.\n\nI don't think we're getting the full story here. The missing employees, the coincidental possession of SCP-427, and that one conspicuous database infiltration seem to point to the fact that the Ethics Committee is playing their own game, with the O5 now eliminated. I haven't a clue what they intend to do with the Foundation as the sole executive power, but I doubt with the pieces we've been able to put together that it's remotely good. \n\nFortunately, SCP-7777 has given us a weighted 7-sided die, and I intend to leverage it with all of the power RAISA can muster. While the Ethics Committee's been creating their conspiracy, we've been creating our own. And I think it's time we excise the bad apples from our rotten bunch. \n\nReach out to me when you're ready.
