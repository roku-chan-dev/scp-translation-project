Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**From:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**Subject:** URGENT: Chair situation is getting out of hand.\n[[/div]]\n------\nHey folks,\n\nSo, I don‚Äôt want to alarm anyone, but I think we have too many chairs.\n\nI counted last night‚Äîjust in the break room alone, we have 86 chairs. For reference, there are four tables and six employees on this floor. I moved some to storage, but when I checked this morning, the break room had 92 chairs and storage was full.\n\nI am requesting formal anomalous classification and assistance before we all die in a tragic ergonomic avalanche.\n\nBest,\nAgent Hughes\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**From:** Dir. Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**Subject:** Re:URGENT: Chair situation is getting out of hand.\n[[/div]]\n------\nAgent Hughes,\n\nHave you considered simply removing the excess chairs?\n\nRegards,\nDirector Lumbago\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir. Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**From:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**Subject:** Re:Re:URGENT: Chair situation is getting out of hand.\n[[/div]]\n------\nI appreciate the suggestion, Director, but I have tried removing them.\n\n* I threw 15 chairs in the incinerator. An hour later, we had 20 more in the conference room.\n* I attempted to break one apart for analysis. It screamed.\n* I locked a chair in containment. This morning, there were two chairs in containment, and they were holding hands.\n\nI am no longer convinced these are normal chairs.\n\nBest,\nAgent Hughes\n\n[[collapsible show=\"APPENDED IMAGE\" hide=\"APPENDED IMAGE\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/choccoman-chairs/chairs.jpg|caption=Chairs.|align=center]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**From:** Dr. Elonie Pitchard (Dept. of Ontokinetics)\n**Subject:** Re:Re:Re:URGENT: Chair situation is getting out of hand.\n[[/div]]\n------\nAgent Hughes,\n\nI performed a minor reality audit. You‚Äôre not going to like this.\n\nSite-303 currently has a Chair Surplus Event at an estimated 1.3 CPM[[footnote]]Chairs Per Minute[[/footnote]]. That number is growing. The chairs appear to be self-replicating through unknown means.\n\nWorse, our records now show that a \"Department of Furniture Logistics\" has always existed, despite us both knowing that isn‚Äôt real. I went to check, and, uh‚Ä¶\n\nHoward, there‚Äôs a new office on Floor 3 that wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. The sign on the door says \"Department of Furniture Logistics.\" There are people inside. They are wearing suits. I don‚Äôt recognize any of them. One of them made direct eye contact with me and whispered, \"Please file Form 42-B if you require additional seating.\"\n\nI am leaving now. Figure this out on your own.\n\nDr. Pitchard\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir. Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**From:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**Subject:** CRITICAL: The Chairs are organising\n[[/div]]\n------\nDirector,\n\nWe have a Class-V Bureaucratic Anomaly. The ‚ÄúDepartment of Furniture Logistics‚Äù is issuing paperwork at an alarming rate. I received an interoffice memo (on letterhead that doesn‚Äôt exist) stating that I have been promoted to Assistant Chair Manager. I did not accept this job.\n\nUpon entering the office, I observed the following:\n\n* Every desk contained at least six chairs.\n* Every employee was sitting in two chairs at once.\n* One employee was just a stack of chairs in a lab coat.\n* There is now a breakroom vending machine that only dispenses smaller chairs.\n\nThey greeted me with a 71-page onboarding packet. Director, I'm scared.\n\nAwaiting orders,\nAgent Hughes\n\n[[collapsible show=\"APPENDED IMAGE\" hide=\"APPENDED IMAGE\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/choccoman-chairs/congrats.jpeg|caption=Promotion üòÄ|align=center]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**From:** Dir. Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**Subject:** Re:CRITICAL: The Chairs are organising\n[[/div]]\n------\nAgent Hughes,\n\nCongratulations on your promotion. Please resolve this.\n\nDirector Lumbago\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir. Edwin Lumbago (Site-303)\n**From:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**Subject:** UPDATE:Situation contained\n[[/div]]\n------\nGood news: The Department of Furniture Logistics has been neutralized.\n\nLess good news: I had to file a formal resignation as Assistant Chair Manager, which led to a mandatory exit interview with a chair named James. James was very disappointed in me.\n\nOnce my resignation was accepted, the entire department ceased to exist. The office is gone. The extra chairs disappeared. The vending machine now just dispenses soup, which is weird but manageable.\n\nHowever, I did receive a final paycheck from the Department of Furniture Logistics. It is written on a chair. I do not know what will happen if I try to cash it. I am not going to try.\n\nBest,\nAgent Hughes\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Agent Howard Hughes\n**From:** Dir.
