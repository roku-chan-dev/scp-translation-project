Viewing SCP-7138 should be done through those mirrors. SCP-7138 will not be interacted with on Sundays or during the first week of the month.## Personnel viewing SCP-7138 directly are advised to ##red|wear rose-tinted glasses, unless you have brown eyes.## All interactions with SCP-7138 must be approved and supervised by Dr. Montgomery.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7138 is a 1 square meter canvas covered in magenta paint of various shades. Subjects exposed to SCP-7138 report heightened anxiety and aversion to the color magenta. On at least one occasion, exposure to SCP-7138 has caused subjects to remove their optical organs. \nSCP-7138 does not emit any thaumic radiation, nor are its effects hampered by Scranton reality anchors. \n\n##red|The lack of any obvious anomalous aspects, combined with SCP-7138’s effects, suggests that there must be a deeper level on which SCP-7138 operates. We just can’t see past our reality to what’s underneath. We can’t see the true reality.##\n\n##red|Since its discovery, SCP-7138 has remained quiet, but sooner or later we’ll wake it up. Sooner or later we’ll wring the truth from it.##\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7138 came to the Foundation’s attention during an investigation into the deaths of several suspected members of AWCY (designated subjects 7138-A through C) during a \"twenty-four-hour art contest\". Interviews with 7138-C indicate that they may not have intended to create SCP-7138.\n\n**Supplementary Documents:**\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email?

You’ve made a lot of progress, of course, but maybe it’s time to take a step back, let someone else take the helm. \n\nOnly temporarily, of course.

You know that we’re no closer to figuring out SCP-7138 than when we started.  We have no idea what makes SCP-7138 tick, and until we do, there’s no guarantee that it won’t go off at any moment. It could be even worse the next time.\n\nAnd I’m not taking a break either. I’m the best – heck, the only – expert on SCP-7138. I know there’s something here, and I’m going to find it. I will see the deeper reality.\n\nThere’s no way I can just walk away from this. I can’t even look at something magenta without thinking of that stupid painting and shuddering.\n\nI’m in it till the end.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Montgomery, \nPHD\nSite ██\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\nto: montgomery1@SCiP.Net\nfrom: ██Director@SCiP.Net\nsubject: re-re-SCP-7138\n[[/div]]\n------\nAlright.

Attached is a transcript of the security footage taken from the incident.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[The laboratory is in disarray. Every monitor in the room has been smashed, and there is a pile of ash where something was burnt. SCP-7138 has been removed from its secure storage and subjected to severe laceration. Dr. Montgomery is present. He is crouched in the corner farthest from SCP-7138, his face turned toward the wall.]\n\n[Security Officer Charles enters the room.]\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** Dr. Monty? I heard there was some kind of ruckus happening. Do you need a hand?\n\n[Security Officer Charles surveys the room.]\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** [Speaking into his radio] I need backup down here. We might have some kind of breach. [Out load] Dr. Montgomery? Are you alright? \n\n[Dr. Montgomery is unresponsive. A soft whispering is audible.]\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** Can you repeat that?\n\n[The whispering continues, rising in volume.]\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** Monty? Are you okay?\n\n[Security Officer Charles touches Dr. Montgomery on the shoulder. Dr. Montgomery turns around. Security Officer Charles takes a rapid step back.]\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** What the...\n\n[Dr. Montgomery's face is heavily disfigured. Both eyes have been removed, and he is holding them in his hands. He continues speaking, now at a much louder volume.]\n\n**Dr. Montgomery:** It's not real. It can't be real. I didn't see anything. The truth is a lie. What I saw was a dream.\n\n**Security Officer Charles:** I... I need a medic in here!\n\n**Dr. Montgomery:** It was all a dream. A simple dream. And then it became a nightmare. And now I'm awake.\n[[/div]]\nFollowing this incident, Dr. Montgomery was reclassified as Subject 7138-E\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\nA newer version of this document has been detected.\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7138/offset/3|VIEW NEXT ITERATION]]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
