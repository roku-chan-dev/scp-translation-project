SCP-5441 is perceived as non-anomalous unless observed using audiovisual media, or transcribed in the form of a script or teleplay. It should be noted that in order for this to be effective, any references to the anomalous properties of SCP-5441 must make contextual sense within the narrative of a given \"episode\".\n\nSubjects affected by SCP-5441 are observed to jump between locations via unknown means in a manner representative of scene changes. Much of the Records Department's productive output is believed to occur during these temporal lapses.\n\nSubjects will often acknowledge or address the presence of a \"camera\" despite a film crew having never been observed within the premises. In most cases, however, the direct suggestion that a camera crew is present will be disregarded by subjects under the influence of SCP-5441.\n\nDespite the comedic inclinations of this narrative causing Site-67 personnel to display incompetent and/or highly unprofessional behaviour, the productive output of those affected remains exceptional.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: #EEE; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px white; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n= **MILTON**\n= Could be, Dave.
