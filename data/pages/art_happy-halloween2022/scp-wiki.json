It's ART. I went with the second prompt! I got as many people who asked for their characters to be here as I could as well as some extra kids because... it's a party for children. It should work on both mobile and desktop but might look a bit wonky on mobile. If it doesn't work for you(either mobile or desktop) try viewing it on the itch.io page. There are links to each of the characters' sources in the interactable itself.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Okay here's my giant crediting portion below.\" hide=\"I'm sorry licensing team.\"]]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Halloween.zip\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://ironshears.itch.io/happy-halloween\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-166 by DrClef and Cerastes\n> SCP-2017 by MissMercurial\n> SCP-6080 by ratking666\n> Abigail Lacroix by Abrethe\n> SCP-2241 by Tuomey Tombstone\n> SCP-3663 by MaliceAforethought\n> Phoebe by hetarae\n> SCP-1003 by Doctor Flibble\n> Dr. Desmarais by Metaphysician\n> Kuobach by IronShears\n> Karcist Halyna Ieva by Naepic\n> Agent Jones by DrAkimoto\n> SCP-191 by DrClef and Sylocat\n> SCP-134 by Skali Sharpnose, Voct, and Unknown Author\n> SCP-2118 by ahbonjour\n> Chloe and Janet by Dr Asteria\n> Toby McEnderson by OriTiefling\n> Director Calvin Bold and SCP-6469 by Calibold\n> Site Director Basar by UncertaintyCrossing\n> Snapdragon by Snapdragon133\n> Dr Cerise by Dr Cerise\n> Dr Asteria by Dr Asteria\n> Dr Theron Sherman by Theesherm\n> Irizu by Skorpt\n> Ariel Ovo by Seraphannim\n> D-5761 by D-5761\n> Tyler Umen by Tyumen\n> Ines Bernard by Tao McCawley\n> Prim by Fantem\n> Jack by Agent Whitney\n> SCP-2192 by PurpleCheetah\n> Dr Fern by Dr Fern\n> Dr Lucretia Deamonne by Zygard\n> SCP-053 by DrGears\n> SCP-682 by DrGears and Epic Phail Spy\n>SCP-999 by ProfSnider\n>Alex Thorley by Fishish(I think?)\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nWell, Hope y'all like it! If there are any bugs or you want me to change gross mischaracterization of your characters just let me know. I'll fix em up.(but not the gross-mischaracterization of your characters tho. That's staying. Sorry.) \n\n[https://github.com/IronShears/Halloween Github Link of source code for Translators. Godot required.
