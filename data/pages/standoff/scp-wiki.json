Staring back at him was a massive iceberg, roughly a mile away. A pair of helicopters sat idly on a flat part of the icy structure.\n\n\"Maintain our speed of 5 knots and open a line to Commander Derris.\"\n\nCalvin typed away at his console while Huic stroked his graying beard. For 32 years he had served in the United States Navy, and for 30 years it had been under the assumption that the world existed as the eyes perceived it.\n\nHis knowledge of the anomalous was limited to what the public knew, as well as what he had been given for this mission—which wasn't as much as one would think. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, his imagination had been running wild recently on what was out there. What was now possible that had once never been? What new tactics could he employ to both defend and utilize that which should not exist? How-\n\n\"Admiral,\" Calvin said. \"Channel six.\"\n\nHuic cleared his throat as a female voice echoed out from the intercoms.\n\n\"This is Derris.\"\n\n\"Commander,\" Huic began, \"what's the situation looking like? Have any idea how to redirect or stop the anomaly?\"\n\n\"No luck as of yet,\" Derris replied. \"We've located the entity that appears to be controlling the iceberg, but communication has been… unsuccessful.\"\n\n\"Explain,\" Huic said. \"Are you in need of assistance?\"\n\n\"Negative Admiral, though the thought is appreciated. As for our communication efforts, well... it's not easy to explain...\"\n\nHuic sighed in disappointment. His curiosity for the anomalous was always hitting //some// road block.\n\n\"Don't fret, Commander. I was never the brightest STEM student. Does it appear to be hostile?\"\n\n\"No,\" Derris said. \"Though we are picking up signs of mild intelligence. If all goes well, we //may// be able to either convince the entity to stop the iceberg, or learn how to stop it ourselves.\"\n\nHuic felt some of the tension in his arms relax. //They're making progress.//\n\n\"Very well, Commander. We have two and a half hours until the anomaly reaches GOC territory. I can't imagine they'd be very pleased to see us, so I suggest solving this problem before it comes to that.\"\n\n\"Understood. Derris out.\"\n\nHuic turned and fell back into his seat. From this angle, the afternoon sun was //just// low enough to peek through the window, adding an annoying glare to his view. Still, he was able to make out the heavy cruiser coasting to his left, as well as the destroyer flanking his right.\n\nAbout six hours ago, Foundation satellites had detected an anomaly a couple hundred miles off the coast of Greenland. Huic had been ordered to take a small squadron of ships and escort a group of Foundation agents out to investigate. Upon arriving two hours ago, they realized the iceberg the anomaly rested in was making its way towards Iceland--an area controlled by the GOC.\n\n\"Admiral!\" Clarence shouted, jumping up from his console. \"I'm picking something up on our radar.\"\n\n//Speak of the devil,// Huic thought while standing from his chair. He already knew what it was.\n\n\"There's several unidentified objects about five miles east of us,\" Clarence said as he pointed to his radar scanner. Sure enough, four blips popped onto the edge of the screen as the radar line passed over it.\n\nHuic responded by raising his binoculars in the direction of the unidentified objects. At the very, very edge of the horizon was the outline of several vessels. To most, it was indistinguishable from the blurry haze of the horizon, but to Huic's eagle eyes and decades of experience, it was clearly the hulls of warships.\n\n\"Open comms on all frequencies,\" Huic said as he walked back to his spot. While the subordinates typed away, the Admiral folded his hands behind his back and stiffened his posture. In times like these, one needed to present themself as firm yet honorable, and posture led presentation.\n\n\"Attention unidentified ships,\" Huic began, \"this is Admiral Austin Huic of the USS Ulysses S Grant. This is a restricted sea zone and is off limits to unauthorized vessels. Identify yourself and state your business or leave the area.\"\n\n\"Good afternoon, Americans,\" an English-accented voice said a moment later. \"This is Admiral Henry Wilson of the HMS Longsword.\"\n\nHuic quickly reached down and pressed the mute button on his control board. \"Lieutenant,\" he said to the officer to his left, \"contact Commander Derris. Tell her the Coalition has sent an interception party and be ready to evac the iceberg if need be.\"\n\nThe officer nodded as Huic turned back to the window. He could just barely see the British warships start to peek into view.\n\n\"Admiral,\" Huic said, unmuting the comm, \"there's anomalous activity in the area and we're currently conducting a joint operation with the SCP Foundation. I would advise either aborting your current objective or rerouting to a different location.\"\n\n\"We're aware of the anomalous activity,\" Wilson replied. \"We've been ordered to intercept the object and terminate it.\"\n\n//Well, there goes any hope they were just passing by,// Huic thought. The Global Occult Coalition had somehow picked up on the anomaly and sent warships to destroy it—which came into direct conflict with the Foundation's goal of containing the iceberg.\n\nWorse yet, the Foundation had agents investigating the anomaly. Would the Coalition try to destroy it if there were still people inside?\n\n\"I mean no disrespect when I say this Admiral,\" Huic said, \"but the UnLondon Treaty states that the Coalition's sphere of influence doesn't start for another few miles. The anomaly is still within Foundation territory.\"\n\n\"We're aware,\" Wilson responded. \"We've been monitoring the anomaly for quite some time now. At it's current speed and trajectory, it's set to enter our waters in less than three hours. When it does, we intend to open fire and eliminate the anomaly by any means necessary.\"\n\nThe ideological differences between the Foundation and GOC were well known by this point. How they each puppeted their respective nations reflected as much. And Huic could already see where this clash of ideologies was going to lead.\n\n\"Admiral,\" Huic said in a cool voice, \"there are Foundation personnel aboard the anomaly. They're attempting to stop, or at least reroute, the iceberg as a containment measure. They've made good progress from what I understand, and are on the brink of being able to subdue it. But they'll need time. And they may still be aboard the iceberg when it drifts into your territory.\"\n\n\"As I said, Captain,\" Wilson replied in an equally cool voice, \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nHuic tightened his fists. He cursed the Coalition's sheer recklessness while pressing the mute button on his microphone.\n\n\"How quickly can we get our birds in the air?\"\n\n\"Five minutes, sir.\"\n\nSilently, Huic turned his attention to the fleet of ships on the horizon, ever growing in size as they inched closer. Then, he reached down and unmuted the comm.\n\n\"Do you truly intend to fire on our agents if it comes to it?\"\n\n\"Apologies, Admiral,\" Wilson replied. \"But we're under orders from the Undersecretary-General herself.\"\n\nHuic let out a defeated sigh. He knew better than anyone that an order from that high up couldn't be ignored. But at the same time, he too was under orders. Orders to protect the Foundation agents aboard the iceberg and contain the anomaly. //By any means necessary.//\n\nAgain Huic muted the microphone.\n\n\"Send a message out to the crew and other ships,\" Huid said. \"Prepare for battle.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" a crewman said before turning to his console. Alarms began blaring as he spoke into his console. \"Attention all personnel, man your battle stations.\"\n\n\"Admiral,\" Calvin said, \"Commander Derris has been informed of the situation. What should we do?\"\n\nHuic fell back into his chair and glared at the British ship, now only about four miles out.\n\n\"Get me in contact with the Secretary of Normality.\"\n\n------\n\n------\n\n\"So which O5 member do I have the pleasure of conversing with this time?\" D.C. al Fine asked the second the blue wave line, representing Fine's voice, appeared on screen.\n\n\"The situation is too pressing to schedule an assembly of the O5 Council,\" Corvitch said. \"I will be negotiating in their stead.\"\n\n\"Ah, Dr. Corvitch. Good to see you haven't resigned the role of Foundation liaison to the Coalition.\"\n\nCorvitch couldn't help but frown. One would think that the role of liaison to the GOC would be an easy job for anyone in the Foundation. After all, the two organizations shared a goal... or at least they used to. Once the veil broke, the common goal of keeping the anomalous under wraps was obsolete. And once that thread was cut, the two couldn't be further from each other. In fact, they very quickly became unreckonable in their hostilities.\n\n\"I assume this is about the situation by Iceland?\" Fine continued.\n\n\"It is,\" Corvitch said, adjusting his glasses. \"Half an hour ago, our office was called by the Secretary of Normality. Apparently, your warships are preparing to blow up an anomalous iceberg... with our agents in it.\"\n\n\"Don't paint us in such a transgressive light,\" Fine replied sternly. If Corvitch could see her, he was sure the Undersecretary-General would be frowning as much as he was. \"Admiral Wilson has been ordered to hold off on engaging the anomaly until it drifts within our borders. We have no intention of violating the UnLondon Treaty.\"\n\nAh, the UnLondon Treaty. When the GOC took power in Europe, it was immediately put at odds with the Foundation. While a few smaller sites were left alone, the Coalition wasn't pleased the Foundation had a massive site right beneath one of the capitols of one of its most prominent nations. So, they assaulted UnLondon in an attempt to drive the Foundation out.\n\nTo prevent World War III, an agreement was reached between the Foundation and Coalition. The main take away being the establishment of borders between the two powers, more or less.\n\n\"The problem here isn't your destruction of the anomaly,\" Corvitch said, \"the problem is our agents aboard the iceberg storing the anomaly. From what I hear, your Admiral intends fire upon it even with our people still on it.\"\n\n\"Admiral Wilson's orders were very clear. Stop the anomaly at all costs.\"\n\n\"Even if it costs the lives of multiple SCP scientists?\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" Corvitch could //hear// Fine lean forward, \"//you're// the one who's putting lives unnecessarily at risk here. Those agents being aboard that iceberg is entirely your own doing. Your obsession with protecting anomalies is what's jeopardizing lives, not us.\"\n\n\"The anomaly in question is showing signs of intelligence,\" Corvitch rebuked. \"An intelligence your gung-ho thinking would happily destroy. As for our agents, they're aboard the iceberg to try and stop it. And are making progress at doing so, may I mention. But they'll need more time. All I ask is you order your men to hold off an attack until we're certain we can't control it.\"\n\n\"You //can't// control it. Every second that anomaly is left afloat is a second it gets closer to Iceland and civilization. Knowing the anomalous, the entire island could be at risk. You and your Foundation may be indifferent to the lives lost to anomalies, but the Coalition deals with threats as soon as we can.\"\n\nCorvitch clenched his fists, digging his nails into his palms. Oh, what he'd give to punt this woman off to the O5 Council.\n\n\"Do you seriously intend on firing upon a group of Foundation scientists?\"\n\n\"The iceberg will enter our waters in an hour. That's enough time for the agents to evacuate. We're terminating the anomaly no matter what. If they're still on it when we do, that's their own fault.\"\n\nCorvitch opened his mouth to speak, but was met with a black screen as Al Fine cut communications. The liaison stared at the screen for a few seconds, sighed, and slammed a fist onto the table.\n\n------\n\n------\n\n\"With all do respect, Commander,\" Huic said, \"I would advise your team pull out.\"\n\n\"Negative,\" Derris responded. \"We're so close to communicating with the anomaly. Once we're able to decrypt and translate these brainwaves, we should be able to get the iceberg to stop.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" Calvin called out, \"the anomaly is half a mile away from the border. It'll be within Coalition waters in 15 minutes.\"\n\nHuic looked up from his console and out the bridge window. The scene had changed dramatically. The heavy cruiser and destroyer that had been flanking Huic's aircraft carrier were now well in front of it, screening it from the two battleships, cruiser, and destroyer a mere mile and a half away. The iceberg was right in the middle of them, though Huic's order for all ships to stop meant that it was quickly moving further away.\n\n\"Commander,\" Huic started again, \"you heard what the Secretary said. The Coalition fully intends on firing the second you cross into their territory even if you're still aboard. As I speak, the GOC is zeroing in on your location. Their heavy guns will shatter the anomaly, the iceberg, and you. You need to evacuate.\"\n\n\"Admiral,\" Olivia, the air traffic controller, said, \"a squadron of fighters are ready to launch at your command.\"\n\n\"What of the USS Jefferson and USS Franklin?\" Huic asked.\n\n\"Both are ready to move in to protect the iceberg if need be, but sir,\" Calvin looked back at him, \"the longer we wait, the longer it'll take both to move into a position that'll be of aid.\"\n\nHuic felt his finger begin to twitch. He was a decorated Admiral, so he was hardly losing his nerve, but this was the first time he had dealt with anything so... serious. The seas had been peaceful for decades, with the only real problem being the occasional pirate. But now? He could find himself in an actual, genuine naval battle. With the British, no less.\n\n\"Ten minutes until they cross, sir.\"\n\n\"Dammit Derris,\" Huic said, leaning down into his console. \"You're out of time. Get off that iceberg before you get your entire team killed.\"\n\n\"But-\"\n\n\"Derris,\" the Admiral started, \"you and your team have been at this for hours. You've tried everything you could to stop the iceberg. In eight minutes the GOC is going to start bombarding you with everything they've got. Do you really think you can achieve in eight minutes what you couldn't in six hours?\"\n\nSilence echoed from the MTF commander. Likewise, no one on the bridge said a word. Only the subtle static and whine of the radio reverberated off the walls.\n\n\"Very well,\" Derris said in a clearly disappointed tone. \"I'll give the evac order. It'll take some time though. I'll call back in about ten minutes when we're ready to fly off.\"\n\nHuic let out a sigh of relief, then turned to Olivia. \"Bring our fighters back down and order the ships to stand down. Calvin, get me in contact with Admiral Wilson.\"\n\nThe crew seemed to be just as relieved as they carried out their orders. A few moments later, the light indicating comms were active flashed on Huic's console.\n\n\"Admiral Wilson, this is Admiral Huic. Do you copy?\"\n\n\"We hear you, Admiral,\" Wilson responded.\n\n\"We have confirmation that the Foundation team has begun evacuation. It'll take some time though, so they may not be off before the iceberg drifts into your territory. But you have my word, they //are// evacuating.\"\n\n\"Understood,\" Wilson said. \"How long will it take the team to get off?\"\n\n\"About 10 minutes.\"\n\nThere was no immediate reply. After a few moments, Wilson spoke, \"Very well. I believe we can spare a few minutes for your team to get off.\"\n\nHuic fell back in his chair, a great weight being lifted off his chest. The last thing he wanted was to engage in a proper naval battle, especially if it was in retaliation for the SCP agents being killed. Fortunately, they were able to figure something out, so it looked like they were able to avoid-\n\n\"Admiral,\" Calvin said, \"we're getting a distress call from Commander Derris.\"\n\nHuic looked up from his seat. //Distress?//\n\n\"Put her through.\"\n\n\"Admiral,\" Derris said once communications were established, \"we seem to have a problem here.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Huic said, standing once more.\n\n\"It's... we can't leave the iceberg.\"\n\nHuic felt the weight fall back onto his chest.\n\n\"Now's not the time for stalling, Commander. The Coalition-\"\n\n\"W- we're not stalling!\" Derris interrupted. \"Our sense of navigation is off. Every time we try and exit the catacomb where the anomaly is, we just... end up right back in the room. Our scanners are all out of whack too. We can't tell east from west down here.\"\n\n\"Five minutes until they cross the border, sir,\" Calvin called out.\n\nHuic tightened his fists, \"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"No, but...\" Derris trailed off for a moment, before speaking again. \"We think it might be the anomaly. Some how, and for some reason, it's messing with our sense of position to keep us in its room.\"\n\n\"Which means you can't evacuate,\" Huic whispered. \"Commander, keep trying to find a way out. I'll speak with the GOC.\"\n\nWith that, the Admiral turned and nodded to Calvin. The young officer typed away at his console, bringing Wilson back online.\n\n\"This is Wilson.\"\n\n\"Admiral,\" Huic began, \"we're facing complications with the evac.\"\n\nThere was silence for a few moments.\n\n\"Explain,\" Wilson said after a bit.\n\n\"The team's sense of direction has been compromised. They're trying to remove themselves from the area, but are unsuccessful. They believe an outside force is intentionally keeping them within the iceberg.\"\n\n\"The anomaly?\"\n\n\"Yes. At least, that's what they're thinking. It goes without saying, but they can't evac.\"\n\nOnce more, silence filled the room. No one, not the Admirals nor crewmen, dared to so much as breath. The quiet was only broken when Calvin spoke up.\n\n\"Sir, they've crossed into Coalition territory.\"\n\n//Hell.//\n\n\"Admiral Wilson,\" Huic said, \"do you copy?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"The agents are working to regain their bearings as we speak. I can't give an estimation for how long it will take for-\"\n\n\"Admiral Huic,\" Wilson interrupted, \"do you have the names of the SCP agents currently onboard the iceberg?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. Send my sincerest apologies to their families.\"\n\nAs soon as Wilson finished speaking, flashes of light burst from the British warships.\n\n\"They've opened fire, sir!\" Calvin cried.\n\n\"Derris!\" Huic shouted, leaning into his command console. \"You've got a volley of shells coming towards you! Prepare for-\"\n\n**BOOM**\n\nHuic straightened and looked out at the iceberg. The tips and ridges of the structure were blown to bits, sending ice shards scattering in a thousand directions. The helicopters, filled with gallons of fuel, were quick to be consumed in their own blazes. Shell after shell bombarded the iceberg, obliterating the surface and leaving it a cratered mess that was quickly taking on water.\n\nAs for Huic, there wasn't much he could do. Even if he could move his ships forward, there was no point now. They could never reach the iceberg before it was totally annihilated by the unending volleys. All he could do was watch, helpless as the anomaly was shattered chunk by chunk.\n\nThe shelling only lasted for less than a minute, but that was all that was needed. Scattered across the sea were thousands of ice shards, softly bobbing in the water. The main structure of the iceberg wasn't even there any more, or at the very least was indistinguishable from the small fragments around it. Huic had, in the back of his mind, considered organizing a search and rescue party if things came to this, but there was no point. Nothing remained of the anomaly or iceberg.\n\n\"For what it's worth, Admiral Huic,\" Wilson said through the comms, \"I contacted my superiors when you told me about the team's difficulties. I argued in favor of giving them more time to try and evac, but the second they heard the anomaly was acting hostile, there was nothing I could do. I had my orders.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Huic said, straightening back up as if nothing had happened, \"you were only following orders.\"\n\n\"Fair winds and following seas,\" Wilson finished before cutting communication.\n\n\"Admiral,\" Huic turned to Calvin, \"we're getting messages from the other Captains. They wish to know if you plan to retaliate.\"\n\nHuic looked out the bridge window once more. The warships had already turned their backs to them, making their way back to Europe.\n\n\"No. Things are bad enough. Just be happy this standoff didn't turn into a war,\" Huic said, and then muttered under his breath, \"at least not yet.\"\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/journal-of-iris-thompson << From The Journal Of Iris Thompson]** | **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/broken-masquerade-hub Hub]** | ??? >>\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=DrDapper]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
