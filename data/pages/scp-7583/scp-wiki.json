The AI must have the following order: \"You are tasked to both monitoring any art piece that is inside the vault, and to keep them at optimal conditions. You have full access. [[footnote]]There must be a backdoor that only personnel with a clearance level 2 or higher can access. This information must be kept away from the AI.[[/footnote]] to any of the vault's systems\"\n\nAny interaction with the object is restricted without the authorization and supervision of at least one psychologist and one senior researcher. \n\nAny 7583-beta instances are to be contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber.\n\n**Description:**  The object is an oil on canvas painting by Alfred Stevens, a Belgian artist. The painting has multiple names, including the following: \"A Blueberry\", \"The (new) Blue Ribbon\" and \"Un Bleuet\". It was painted around 1894. \n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/StevensBlueRibbon.jpeg | caption=Un Bleuet ]]\n\nAny person who looks at the painting's model undergoes serious psychological reactions. Ranging from mild paranoia to extreme panic attacks that can be lethal. The severity seems to be in direct correlation with the time spend observing the woman. In addition to the aforementioned effects, the subjects who have spent enough time with the painting reports memories that are not originally theirs. After sufficient time, the subject[[footnote]] Designated 7583-beta [[/footnote]] will fall in a mental coma and will be replaced by 7583-alpha. Alpha is defined as the complete collection of memories and personality of the painted lady. The proof of Alpha's reality is currently lacking sufficient proof. The Painted Woman has no record of existence. \n\nAny replica of the painting, regardless of how well it is made, does not show any anomalous behaviour \n\nThe object was first found by the Turkish branch and is currently contained at the international site-35, in İzmir [[footnote]]The old (and maybe more recognisable to international research personnel) name for İzmir is Smyrna[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addenda:** \n[[collapsible show=\"**+Recovery Log:**\" hide=\"**-Recovery Log:**\"]]\n> Attending personnels: 2 MTF-████ and 1 Senior Memetics researcher\n> Attending civillians: Owner of The █████ Art Museum \n> The following log has been translated from Turkish to Engish \n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> //Video feed shows a bland room with one table.

Please reply if you are fine with the video feed\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Owner:** I acknowladge the video feed. Now, can I offer you gentilmen some tea?\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **D. P:** No, thank you Miss [redacted]. The nature of our visit is... highly //secretive//. Regardless, we are here to buy one of your paintings; Un Bleuet.\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Owner:** Well then, I am sorry to dissapoint you people, but the painting is not for sale. \n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Dr. P:** That's unfortunate. May I ask, what's so important about that piece anyway?\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Owner:** Funny, I had the same questions, Doctor. Nonetheless, I can entertain your... curiosity. When I look at it, I feel a sense of... home. Like I am looking towards a mirror. I feel as if that painting is who I am, who I'll ever be. A reflection of nobody, who somehow is the definition of me. A gift, from a long lost friend. A memory that longs for an end, yet desires to be remembered.  \n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Dr. P:** Interesting, would you mind explaining how you felt when you first acquired this... artwork?\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Owner:** What I can only describe as severe paranoia. I... I could not sleep. I felt terrible, I needed to be with her. My heart would beat fast, I would sweat, tremble so much that I couldn't stand upright. However, then I realized what it was, and what I was. It was hard getting used to my new world, but I did it regardless. That work means the world to me. You can't have it. No one can. \n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> **Dr. P:** I see. I'm terribly sorry, Miss [redacted], but we need that painting. I hope that this will change your mind.\n> ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ\n> //Dr. P takes a picture out of his bag and slides it across the table. The owner looks at it, and then relaxes her expression.
