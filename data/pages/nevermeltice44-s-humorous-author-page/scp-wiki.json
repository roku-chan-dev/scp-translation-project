I told you you shouldn't try to out-pizza the hut. Anyhow, welcome to solitary confinement, also known as my author page. Me being able to create this means that the higher-ups believe I have any idea of what I'm doing, a statement with which I disagree completely, but oh well. You may be wondering why are you in a completely white and seemingly endless space filled with boxes. Simple: I am reverse Santa Claus, I steal this shit from kids every Christmas.

I'd say it's fine but worse than some of my other work. And yes, most of this was indeed written in a toilet.[[/collapsible]]\n> \n> [[[SCP-7299]]]\n> \n> [[collapsible]]My first main list article, and one I'm pretty proud of. Here I introduce my Researcher OC, Markus Fairweather[[footnote]] Feel free to use him in any of your works if you want to for some reason...[[/footnote]]and try to make him somewhat unique. Inspired by what I believe to be the funniest book of all time, //No Word From Gurb//. Go check it out to inflate my bottomless ego even further.[[/collapsible]]\n> \n> [[[Job Interview]]]\n> \n> [[collapsible]]A continuation of 7299, this time relating the struggles of Fairweather as he tries to arrive in time for his final Foundation employment interview. I decided to make this because writing from Fairweather's POV is inspiring, and most importantly, fun.[[/collapsible]] \n> \n> [[[SCP-7096]]]\n> [[collapsible]]Inspired by the real signs used by the South Armagh Snipers, back when the Irish loved leaving //mind-blowing// surprises inside gentlemen's cars. It's a really simple article, so I understand why it may drop below 0 at any point, but I feel like it's neat. [[/collapsible]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> **//Huh, this looks kinda empty doesn't it? No worries, I'm brewing more projects in my witch's lair, and some may not even be comedy articles!//**\n> [[/=]]\n\n\n\nThat's about it, mate. The bathroom?
