Eating lasts for several minutes, as the victim continues to choke and cough.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** No great party is //truly// great without a few gifts, amiright everyone?!\n\n//The crowd vocalizes in confirmation.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** Let's give our friend a very special gift of her own! Something she can remember us by, forever and ever.\n\n//A member of the crowd pulls out scissors, gauze, syringes, scalpels, string, and a hand-held sand grinder from a toolbox. The victim shrieks again and attempts to squirm away.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** Don't worry. You're going to look //gorgeous!//\n\n//The camera is knocked away, facing upwards towards the ceiling. The sand grinder is heard activating, and the crowd cheers as the victim shrieks again. A loud snap cracks throughout the room before the victim's shrieks turn into gurgling.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN 2]:** She already looks //so// much better!\n\n//Recording ceases abruptly as a member stomps on the device, destroying the camera.//\n\n**{{[END LOG]}}**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ ##9d1cb9|**JUNE 2021**##\n+++++ Customers satisfied: ##green|556##\n[[/=]]\n-----\nAh, what a fun and fantastic memory to share together!\n\nBut now we're coming to an end of our journey. We, here at Belwood Staffing, will sorely miss you, BSL-6864-313. From the happy memories, to your fantastic work performance, and even for the toughest moments life has to offer -- we will never forget you. And, while it would be terribly sad to see you go, we at Belwood Staffing are empathetic. We understand that feeling of wanting a fresh start. Even if it means finding a worse company to work for instead!\n\nHowever, don't think that you'll never be welcomed back. Or, perhaps you're thinking about returning now. Either way, we would love to keep you here! If that interests you, or perhaps you're not able to find a new position due to any sudden or pre-existing conditions, then we'd be happy to have you back here in no time.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ ##9d1cb9|**JULY 2021**##\n+++++ Customers satisfied: ##red|0##\n[[/=]]\n----\nIt seems like you have made your choice.\n\nWe'll leave your special gift right here <3\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"SHOW ATTACHMENT\" hide=\"COLLAPSE ATTACHMENT\" hideLocation=\"bottom\"]]\n[[=image updatedcard style=“width: 100%;”]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\nWith love from your new family,\n- **##9d1cb9|Belwood Staffing##**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n{{@<>>@ SAFE MODE has ran into an unexpected problem and is attempting to restart the session.}}\n\n{{@<>>@ Closing client now at 16:27.}}\n\n{{@<>>@ SAFE MODE de-activated.
