I don't really immerse myself in the different canons on this wiki nor am I particularly active and so I may come of as quite unknowledgeable or out of the loop at points. I read a lot of fiction which is neither sci-fi or fantasy (although that does happen as well, I love //Harry Potter//, //LOTR// and //Dune// for instance). I'll be very happy if you interact with me or my stuff here on the wiki.\n\n\n+ Underread Articles\nI do this thing where I look through older and newer articles below a rating of 30 without many comments (or very old comments) and leave a crit just to try and give the article some attention.\n\n++ This particular time, I recommend reading [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-curse-of-mount-abraxas|The Curse of Mount Abraxas]]]. \n[[div style=\"background:#f3d9d7;padding:10px;margin:5px;padding:10px;\"]]\n//\"Fernand,\" said Fernand, still chewing.

It all depends on what setting you plan to write. For any type of writing I typically go with romantic classical composers such as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG87oy53_zM Tchaikovsky], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn09UdSb3aA  Chopin] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiChxN0T2kA Schubert]. \n\nDepending on the setting, you may use vastly different genres of music. The [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9_twwsWUPk&list=PLwDEuPBgBi4NDcdlZrA-LCU7j-aUXzm_k soundtrack from Zelda: BOTW] as well as the calmer [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhOEn7Xl8as background music of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion] works well for a lot of atmospheric settings. For childish, lighthearted pieces I believe [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxtRYpvJKRc bossa nova] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edXrvZj58SY Yoshi's Crafted World OST] works quite well.
