Petrakovich following his abandonment of the \"shock and destroy\" tactics of the art collective \"Are We Cool Yet?\", //Every Day Is Wednesday// is an important and breathtaking viewpoint into the artist's struggles to redefine himself as a member of the ReCreationist school of anart rather than as a Pseudo-Deconstructionist.\n> \n> The references to the traditional style of surrealism are most pronounced in the usage of inks composed of blood samples from Picasso, DalÃ­, and Masson, combined with sweat from the artist himself. Petrakovich's use of synaesthetic effects is given full freedom here, with gustatory-tactile and auditory-proprioceptive responses most often reported. Also note the unique use of ocher and crimson in order to provoke the sensation of drunkenness, a cognitive effect Petrakovich used to great effect in later pieces.\n> \n> The secondary and more infamous effect has been described by the artist as \"fuck copyright\" and consists of any indirect representations, including photography, video feed, hand-drawn sketches, clairvoyance, astral projection, and scrying, to only produce an altered copy of this descriptive plaque with the majority of the text replaced by the following phrase: \"Suck it bitches. You got to see to believe.\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** petrakovich.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Drewbear]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/library-gallery-exhibition SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
