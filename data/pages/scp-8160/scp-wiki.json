The entrance is approximately their height, they have no trouble maneuvering through the gap as they enter, descending below the planet surface.]//\n\n//[The walls are thick with compact dust, growing more and more solid as they gain depth.

They pull again and it slams open, releasing a rush of rust and stale air.]//\n\n//[They move to a drawer, then another cupboard, each yielding similar results.

It doesn't budge.]//\n\n//[They pull harder.]//\n\nHm.\n\n//[They retrieve their knife from their pocket and flick it open, before jamming it into the small gap around the drawer.]//\n\n//[As they work the knife around the edge, it cuts through like paper, fully disconnecting the front of the drawer.]//\n\n//[Theta crouches.]//\n\n//[Inside the drawer sits a single piece of paper. The paper is scrawled across in smeared black ink, and an additional splash of blood red in the top right corner.]//\n\n//[Theta stares at the page for a moment, unmoving.]//\n\n//[Their grip on their knife tightens. They take a deep breath.]//\n\n//[They suddenly grab the page, taking it in both hands shredding it over and over again until each composite piece is the size of confetti and littering the ground.]//\n\n//[Theta leans against the countertop, and looks around.]//\n\n//[A distant noise can be heard. Rustling, like paper. Soon, the noise is surrounding them.]//\n\n//[A piece of paper falls from the ceiling.]//\n\n//[In moments, the room begins to dissolve into paper, walls, floor, and furniture alike.

As they wrestle their leg from the hole, their focus darts to the entrance, which continues to get smaller.]//\n\n//[Theta quickly clambers to standing as the table at center of the room collapses. Simultaneously, they notice the ceiling beginning to concave, bulging downward to cut off their escape.]//\n\n//[Theta flinches then changes direction, lunging to their side and barreling through the collapsed table.]//\n\n//[Swiftly they gain momentum and begin to charge at the entrance once more, bursting through the wall as the room disappears behind them.]//\n\n//[The view fills with dust as theta scampers up the cavern, breaks the surface, then turns.]//\n\n//[The cave no longer exists.]//\n\n//[The feed fails.]//\n\n<->\n[[/div]]\n\nlog/capture.11b [NULL]\n[[div style=\"margin:10px;background:rgb(0,0,0);border-color:rgb(40,40,40);border-style:solid;color:white;margin-inline:auto;width:300px;text-align:center;padding:10px\"]]\n[[div style=\"background:rgb(0,0,0);border-color:rgb(60,60,60);border-style:solid;color:white;margin-inline:auto;width:auto\"]]\n[[image Dust-Diploma.png]]\n[[/div]]\nAUTOMATIC M.A.T.

A few meters in front of them, the ground begins to angle downward sharply into a large crater.

It becomes apparent that Theta is sinking, half above ground as they thrash, the motion of which is churning up pages that were sitting just bellow the dust. They shoot into the air, sheets of white, sheets smattered in ink, then fall back down, sliding about Theta's body like a thick, crunching, and crackling stream.]//\n\n//[Theta and their objects have been caught in a tide of circular motion, a whirlpool of dust and paper and trinkets all being funneled down into center the crater. Theta looks wildly in every direction, desperately tracking each of their objects whilst staying afloat. Their arms spin as they fight the tide, pushing, swimming up the side of the crater and looking back every other second. As each passes, their things are getting further and further away, down deeper into the crater, and closer to swirling abyss at its core. They notice the path their objects follow. A trail painted in ink. A line shifting as the liquid-pages move, but always clear- connected across their surfaces. Uncountable pages interlocking in a perfect spiral of patterned ink, pointing down, leading down, into a dark whirling splotch at the center.]//\n\n//[In moments, Theta can no longer see their objects. They reach back desperately and shout.]//\n\nMatty!\n\n//[Theta fights the tide, in stalemate. They paddle desperately, circling the crater, and though they aren't losing ground, they aren't gaining it either.]//\n\n//[As more time passes, their movements start getting slower. And with their paddling less powerful, they start to lose ground.]//\n\n//[They begin to move down the spiral, following the line writ in ink and paper. It drags them in slowly, still fighting, but their strength is long drained. Now, they are barely treading water, committing more of their mind to staying afloat and none to to attempting to escape the crater.]//\n\n//[Theta's arms turn rigid. Every movement elicits a pained grunt. Though they are sputtering, they want to fight. Heaving, they want to escape. Pleading, they want to live.]//\n\n//[They want to last.]//\n\n//[Forever.]//\n\n//[Then their head goes under.]//\n\n//[The sound of rustling pages picks up louder and louder as Theta picks up speed, spinning, coughing, lungs full of dust, losing track of which way is up and down.]//\n\n//[It's getting darker. More and more pages drenched with ink, so that the rare white spot glows like a beam of light, or a lone star in the sky.]//\n\n//[A lone glimmer crosses the view.]//\n\n//[Then it is black.]//\n\n//[For a moment, it appears that Theta is floating in a dark void, gently floating in nothingness, desperately tired, and shaking.]//\n\n//[This is not the case.
