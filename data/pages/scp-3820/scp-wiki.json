It is to be provided with an adult diet designated for large breed canines twice daily as well as a constant supply of water. The containment unit is also to be decontaminated daily. A Foundation personnel specializing in canine veterinary is to complete a health inspection on SCP-3820 annually.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3820 is a member of //Canis lupus familiaris// that is coated entirely in a material similar in texture and appearance to calcite, but is malleable enough to allow for normal movement. Other than the aforementioned anomalous properties, SCP-3820 vaguely resembles and behaves like a 5-year-old, female Golden Retriever.  \n\nSecurity footage of Site-19’s lobby showed the sudden appearance of a bright, blue-colored flash lasting for approximately one second before subsiding, with SCP-3820 manifesting at the center of the flash. Researchers have yet to determine the exact mechanism of SCP-3820's manifestation, or why it appeared at Site-19.  \n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Incident Log-3820-1\" hide=\"◀ Collapse\"]]\n\n**Incident Log-3820-1:** On 08/08/2017, one month after SCP-3820's manifestation, Site-19 administration staff Harvey Black received a phone call from an unknown Person of Interest concerning SCP-3820. A follow-up investigation has failed to identify or trace the caller, appearing as if the call never transpired.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the conversation between the unknown caller and Black:\n\n> **Black:** Been a long day, so keep it short.  \n>  \n> **Caller:** Oh, sorry, sorry! I'll just get straight to business then. Is this, uh... is this Site-19? \n>  \n> **Black:** ...The hell are you- what’s your ID number? \n>   \n> **Caller:** Sorry, don’t have one. Unlike you, I don’t actually work for the Foundation! I’m just calling you about my dog, Marbs? \n> \n> //Black activates a silent emergency alert, designating the call to be a potential Level-3 security breach.// \n>  \n> **Black:** Okay, hold up, hold up. Before we talk about... ‘Marbs’, how did you get onto this network? \n>  \n> **Caller:** I got your number from the phone book! It's right between Site-██ and Site-██. \n>  \n> //Black receives a directive from Site-19 Security to continue the conversation with the unknown caller and attempt to acquire as much information as possible.//  \n>  \n> **Black:** Right, right. So, who are you, really? \n>  \n> **Caller:** Just Marbs’ parent, of course! And speaking of Marbs, I think she’s registered as number thirty-eight... two-zero in your system? \n>  \n> **Black:** Yeah yeah, I think I found her. Our file on ‘Marbs’ is kinda scant, so tell me more about her.  \n> \n> **Caller:** Oh, she’s just the sweetest thing ever! A bit stiff, but what sentient canine statue isn't? But I’m sure she’s warmed up to you all already! \n>  \n> **Black:** Yeah, totally. Right so, what’s a... ‘sentient canine statue’? \n>  \n> **Caller:** I’m... not really sure? Statue dogs are just so cool and elegant and- okay, maybe Marbs’s not any of that, but that's what makes her so special! And that's also why I chose Site-19. I heard you guys are really good with sentient statues! \n>  \n> **Black:** ...Okay. Alright, uh... how did ‘Marbs’ get here? \n>  \n> **Caller:** Wow, you’re really blasting me with the Q and As today, huh? Uh... it’s something to do with [REDACTED], maybe? Oh, I’m so sorry, I- \n>  \n> **Black:** I haven’t got a clue what you’re on about either. I’m just the... well, guess I got demoted to 'receptionist'. \n>  \n> **Caller:** Yeah, I get you, I so get you- oh! Oh, I’m so sorry. You said to keep it short and now look at what I’ve done! \n>  \n> **Black:** What? Oh, nah, nah, nah, I got time now- \n>  \n> **Caller:** No, that won’t be fair of me. Alright, I just wanna let you guys know that I’m picking up Marbs soon. So, you all better say goodbye to her! \n>  \n> **Black:** Seriously? \n>  \n> **Caller:** Oh, sorry, I should also thank you all at Site-19 for taking such good care of Marbs! And don’t worry, I’ve sorted out payment. Hey, it was fun chatting with you today! \n>  \n> //The caller disconnects.// \n>  \n> **Black:** ...Reckon someone needs to go check on SCP-3820. \n\nOne minute after the phone call, SCP-3820 underwent a spontaneous disappearance event. Security footage showed the appearance of a bright, blue flash, similar to the manifestation event, lasting approximately one second before subsiding and revealing the disappearance of the subject. Replacing SCP-3820 is exactly one kilogram of [DATA EXPUNGED]. As of the compilation of this incident log, the Foundation’s potential use of [DATA EXPUNGED] is still being debated among the O5 Council.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3819]]] | SCP-3820 | [[[SCP-3821]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
