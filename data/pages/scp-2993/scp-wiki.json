Access to SCP-2993 is available only to staff Level 2 and above. Any personnel wishing to use SCP-2993 must contact the current leading researcher assigned to SCP-2993.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2993 appears to be an unremarkable pair of aviator sunglasses with no visible markings or logos. The durability of SCP-2993 is unremarkable and without proper care may be damaged in a way similar to its non-anomalous counterparts.\n\nWhen viewed from the front, SCP-2993 is opaque and acts as a mirror. No form of radiation is able to pass through SCP-2993, including visible light. Replacing parts of SCP-2993 while preserving its original function is possible as long as more than 50% of the original mass is present. The most notable feature of SCP-2993 occurs when it is viewed from behind: SCP-2993 shows exactly six hours behind the period of time the user is wearing them (see Addendum SCP-2993-1).\n\n**Addendum SCP-2993-1:** A Junior Researcher under Dr. A████████ compared security footage to the view through SCP-2993 while searching for any abnormalities that lead to the containment breach of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Security footage showed the researcher writing on a piece of paper \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" a sentence that contains all 26 letters of the alphabet. Six hours later, the researcher (using SCP-2993) noted that the sentence read, \"A mad boxer shot a quick, gloved jab to the jaw of his dizzy opponent,\" a sentence that also contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.\n\nFurther testing has revealed that the past as viewed through SCP-2993 contains many minor changes. Examples include Junior Researcher B█████'s hair as shoulder-length instead of neck-length, an Agent's first name spelled as Hannah instead of Hanna, and the color of Dr A████████'s favorite pen appeared green instead of red. \n\n**Addendum SCP-2993-2:** Due to differences in details found when viewing the past while wearing SCP-2993 (detailed in Addendum SCP-2993-1), Dr A████████ used SCP-2993 to look over notes he had taken on SCP-████ six hours before. The notes on SCP-████ appeared to be minimally different, excluding ten millimeter differences in length of the steel bars keeping SCP-████ in containment. Although this difference appears negligible, the difference in length would normally lead to a security breach by SCP-████.\n\nAlthough these dimensions should have caused a containment breach for SCP-████, no such breach occurred. Approximately three hours later, when Dr. A████████ used SCP-2993 to observe the containment area of SCP-████, SCP-████ did not break free of containment, and the differences in measurement observed by Dr. A████████ while wearing SCP-2993 were non-existent when he performed measurements of the containment unit himself. \n\n------\n\n//Memo from Dr: A████████: \"Is what SCP-2993 shows us consistent? We know that it maintains at least some level of accuracy in regards to reality, at least nominally, as noted in Addendum SCP-2993-1. Is SCP-2993 selectively altering information? I can't help but wonder what mechanisms influence the effects of SCP-2993.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Experiment-Log 2993-A\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\nAt 23:54, 5/11/████, Dr. A████████ reviewed notes on SCP-2993. Exactly six hours later, Dr. A████████ donned SCP-2993 and viewed himself looking over his notes. Content of the files appeared completely unchanged other than a select testing log that had been appended. The log contained tests that Dr. A████████ had never conducted. The appended log has been exactly reproduced:\n\n> **Past-Experiment-Log-2993-1**\n> \n> SCP-2993 tapped lightly with a hammer. No effect\n> SCP-2993 forcibly hit with a hammer. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 dropped from ten meters. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 dropped from 30 meters. No effect\n> SCP-2993 dropped from 100 meters. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 shot with a 9mm handgun. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 shot with a .50 caliber rifle. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 introduced to temperatures of over ███ Kelvin. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 ████ ██ ██████ ██████ █████ █████. No effect.\n> SCP-2993 ██████ █ ██ ████ ██████ ██ █████████. █████.\n*It should be re-noted that SCP-2993 is no more durable than a regular pair of sunglasses.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Experiment-Log 2993-B\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\nDr. A████████ donned SCP-2993 to view an interview for [DATA EXPUNGED] in person six hours after it had completed. Although differences between recordings of the interview and Dr. A████████'s observation were minimal at first, the end of the interview observed by Dr. A████████ was different than the recording. Following is the transcribed audio recording of Dr. A████████ describing the interview through SCP-2993:\n\n> //Audio log capture//\n> //Experiment 2993-B//\n> Date: 07/13/████\n> **Subject:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> **Location:** ██ █████████, ████\n> //Skip to 23m 05s//\n> \n> **23:07:**\n> **//Dr. A████████//**: Something is changing. The officer is - (extended pause) - there is something different with the way he's looking at the Subject. I can't quite say what the difference is, but it's there. The Subject is nonplussed - wait, was nonplussed. They appear to be agreeing on something. They are nodding to each other.\n> \n> **23:40**\n> **//Dr. A//**: The officer is no longer talking to the Subject. The two are staring at each other from across the table, doing nothing.\n> \n> **24:05**\n> **//Dr. A//**: The Subject and the officer are still looking at... fuck, now they are looking at me. They can - (pause) - I think... they can see me.\n> \n> At this point Dr. A████████ hurriedly takes SCP-2993 off and searches his immediate surroundings. \n> \n> **//24:22//**\n> **//Control//**: Doctor A████████, can you continue?\n> \n> **//24:26//**\n> **//Dr. A//**: [Pauses] I can.\n> \n> **//24:28//**\n> **//Control//**: Continue.\n> \n> **//24:30//**\n> Dr. A████████ re-dons SCP-2993.\n> \n> **//24:31//**\n> **//Dr. A//**: HOLY SHIT.\n> \n> Dr. A████████ quickly removes SCP-2993 once again, showing signs of severe distress.\n> \n> **//24:35//**\n> **//Control//**: Doctor A████████?\n> \n> **//24:43//**\n> **//Dr A//**: They - (pause) - they were standing right in front of me, right there, shoulder to shoulder, staring at me.\n> \n> Dr A████████ terminates the experiment.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2992]]] | SCP-2993 | [[[SCP-2994]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
