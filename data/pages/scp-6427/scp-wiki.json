[[/footnote]]\n\n**Object Class:** Keter[[footnote]] pending approval. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Undefined.[[footnote]] Note: Forward this to HCML rep. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6427 is the temporary designation given to an entity currently inside Site-324. The full extent of its abilities is currently unknown, but it is believed that SCP-6427 is capable of teleportation, abnormal feats of strength, and enhanced agility.[[footnote]] discerning additional abilities has presented several challenges, due to the ongoing situation. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6427 appears to be a pale grey creature approximately 3 meters tall. [[footnote]] Taking exact measurements is currently unfeasible. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6427 possesses irregular body proportions, with some appendages extending over 2 meters further than others. [[footnote]] I'll be cleaning up the description when the entity isn't breathing down my neck. I hope. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6427 possesses mild antimemetic properties, which it theoretically uses in order to avoid description.[[footnote]] As if anyone could describe a single creature for long, especially at this hour.  Also: Double-check the meaning of antimemetic later. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6427 was discovered after sightings of a hostile force inside Site-324 were confirmed on 12/10/2021. The entity proceeded to engage several members of Site Security, ultimately overpowering them and turning towards nearby personnel.[[footnote]] This is probably off tone, hopefully, I'll be able to fix it later. [[/footnote]]\n\nThe entity materialized inside Junior Researcher Michaels' living quarters at approximately 3:56 AM[[footnote]] Bastard. **REMOVE THIS LATER** [[/footnote]] and was subsequently restrained accidentally by a file describing it[[footnote]] A miracle, if you take into account the battery left on my laptop. [[/footnote]], which Michaels had made in an attempt to communicate with any available member of site staff.[[footnote]] I will never thank orientation enough after this. We all laughed at \"If you see an entity lunging at you, use your last breath to document it\", but I guess it's not always about being part of an undercover meat grinder with these people. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6427 is thought to possess an aversion to written descriptions of it, which render it inert.[[footnote]] Verbal descriptions and video logs seem to have no effect since the entity did not stop until I wrote its designation. [[/footnote]]\n\nWhen SCP-6427 is actively described in a document, it assumes a fetal position, although a pause longer than a second restores its ability to move.[[footnote]] Note: I was willing to risk it for science. It's practically on top of me now. [[/footnote]]\n\n[[div id=\"blink-bar\"]] \nAlthough SCP-6427 could remain contained indefinitely[[footnote]] Provided I find my power cord.
