Case reports  involving SCP-2901 will be remitted to MTF Phi-5 (\"Twilighters\") for further investigation.  \n\nCivilian sightings of SCP-2901 will be suppressed using amnestic field applications.  Media leaks regarding SCP-2901 will be deleted or discredited by the Information Detraction, Censorship, and Rescission Division (IDCaRD). \n~~~~~~~~\nField personnel should avoid SCP-2901 if at all possible.  Those authorized to investigate SCP-2901 must carry mobile devices capable of short message services (SMS) in case of sudden acoustic cancellation.  If a hostile encounter is unavoidable, personnel should adhere to the following steps:\n# Do not attempt to run.  Fleeing may provoke SCP-2901 to give chase.  \n# Hold your ground.  Be sure to make eye contact.  \n# Make a threat display.  Use clothing to imitate an increase in body mass.\n# Continue Step 3 until SCP-2901 becomes disinterested and submits.\n# Avoid physical contact if at all possible.[[footnote]] Due to the fluctuation of SCP-2901's mass, any physical connection made between the entity and victim will result in intersecting membraneous contact.  This phenomenon usually results in the removal of the dermal layer along the contact area as SCP-2901 retracts.

Wield or throw objects to maintain distance.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2901 are a species of nocturnal carnivorous scavengers of limited intelligence; averaging 1.7m in height. SCP-2901 usually appear as having an ellipsoid shape and possess 2 large eyes layered with photophoric tissue.  SCP-2901 are covered in a layer of minute iridescent lamellar scales, similar to //Lepidopterans//[[footnote]] Lepidoptera (lɛpɨˈdɒptərə/lep-i-dop-tər-ə) are a large order of insects that includes moths and butterflies. [[/footnote]].  SCP-2901 are able to move through space-time freely, granting them certain abilities such as levitation, flight, and teleportation.  SCP-2901 are, however, tangible and susceptible to conventional firearms.  SCP-2901 are also able to emit an acoustic cancellation effect within a radius of approximately 25m.  The purpose or function of this ability is not wholly understood but is theorized to aid in stealth.  \n\nSeveral methods of containment and/or deterrents are still being considered.  However, because of the elusiveness of SCP-2901, a large majority of the general public are aware of related incidents and possibly even the existence of SCP-2901.  Counter-measures are in place as a temporary solution for protecting information on SCP-2901.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[LEVEL-2 ACCESS REQUIRED]\" hide=\"[ACCESS GRANTED]\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#F0F0F0; padding: 1px 8px; border: solid 2px #003\"]]\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2901/IDCARD.png width=\"150px\" style=\"padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px\"]]\n+ [[size 125%]]{{**__IDCaRD__**}}[[/size]]\n+++ {{Information Detraction, Censorship, and Rescission Division}}\n{{**IDCARD@SCPFoundation.intranet**}}\n{{**Ext 7502**}}\n{{**Fax 7503**}}\n----\n[[=]]\n+ {{OPERATION:}}\n+ __{{\"SURGEON'S PHOTOGRAPH\"}}__\n+++ {{PRIORITY: DALET}}\n+++ {{INTERNAL USE ONLY}}\n[[/=]]\n\n[[==]]\n++++ __{{PREAMBLE:}}__\n{{**Due to the uncontainable nature and general notoriety of SCP-2901, certain protocols must be established in order to quell civilian suspicion as to the existence of these entities.

Since then, continuing field observations have concluded that SCP-2901 are an aggressively territorial and solitary species.  SCP-2901 normally do not engage or reveal themselves openly to humans, and will often retreat or vanish if discovered.\n\nFurther observations suggests that SCP-2901 are able to approximate the time and location of future disasters with a certain degree of accuracy, particularly those resulting in multiple fatalities[[footnote]] This precognitive ability is believed to function as a physiological sense comparable to scent.  Data varies, however, on the number of SCP-2901 within a given area (φ^^n^^) versus the total fatalities after the disaster event occurs (Σδ).  False positive incursions, though rare, have also been observed. [[/footnote]].  This is supported by accounts and reports showing a sudden presence of SCP-2901 within the vicinity of the disaster area, usually within a month or week before it occurs.  \n\nDuring this period, many SCP-2901 will claim rights to the area resulting in altercations with other SCP-2901; sometimes including human bystanders being mistaken as threats.  During these aggressive territorial behaviors, SCP-2901 are able to change their physical shape into a large nebulous-like body as a threat display.  After the disaster event occurs, the remaining SCP-2901 will take part in feeding off the deceased in a frenzy-like behavior until the food source is depleted; vacating once satiated.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[LEVEL-4 ACCESS REQUIRED]\" hide=\"[ACCESS GRANTED]\"]]\n[[div style=\"background-color:#F0F0F0; padding: 1px 8px; border: solid 2px #003\"]]\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2901/IDCARD.png width=\"150px\" style=\"padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px\"]]\n+ [[size 125%]]{{**__IDCaRD__**}}[[/size]]\n+++ {{Information Detraction, Censorship, and Rescission Division}}\n{{**IDCARD@SCPFoundation.intranet**}}\n{{**Ext 7502**}}\n{{**Fax 7503**}}\n----\n[[=]]\n+ {{CONFIDENTIAL}}\n+++ {{PRIORITY: GIMEL}}\n[[/=]]\n[[==]]\n++++ __{{DIRECTIVE:}}__\n{{**Operation: \"Surgeon's Photograph\" is to be considered the \"Special Containment Procedures\" for SCP-2901 and is to operate under the guise of an active public disinformation campaign.  MTF Phi-5 will be responsible for its continuation and level of effectivity in maintaining acceptable levels of public awareness and conception.**}}\n\n{{**As a point of clarification, the purpose of Operation: \"Surgeon's Photograph\" is not to protect information on SCP-2901 but rather control information on SCP-2901.**}}\n\n++++ __{{SUMMARY:}}__\n{{**SCP-2901's current evolution is the sum of Foundation efforts in manipulating its existence through public perception.  SCP-2901 are a group of extradimensional entities that lack a stable cohesive form and purpose that only coalesces through continued observational reconciliation.  For SCP-2901 to maintain a stable physical mass, approximately 75% of the nearby human populace within 500km need to be congruent on a singular concept of what SCP-2901 is and what it does.**}}\n\n{{**SCP-2901 were first discovered and categorized as highly unstable Keter-class entities capable of producing localized CK-class scenarios at random.  Further research into SCP-2901's unstable manifestations proved to be futile as, unbeknownst to Foundation scientists at the time, SCP-2901 would involuntarily change during each subsequent observation.  During a containment breach into the civilian populated areas within the Appalachian region of the Southern United States, SCP-2901 began gradually condensing into a singular manifestation the more it was exposed to humans.**}}  \n\n{{**Civilians began conceding to the idea that SCP-2901 was a dark winged-like humanoid with large red eyes, which corresponded to pre-existing local folklore.  SCP-2901 also began to evolve predatory-like behaviors and anomalous acoustic effects that conceptualized due to the mass fear generated within the surrounding communities.**}} \n\n{{**Foundation researchers recognized the effects and began isolating SCP-2901 as much as possible. However, deprived of regular perceptual input, SCP-2901 began to devolve into its initial highly unstable manifestations once again. The decision was made to maintain SCP-2901 in a functioning manageable state through continued exposure to human perceptual belief that SCP-2901 is a tangible creature of local folklore: another [[[SCP-1000|Bigfoot]]] or [[[SCP-3934|Loch Ness Monster]]]. The nearby Silver Bridge collapse of 1967 and the SCP-2901 Appalachian Incursion in reality have no connection with one another; however, public opinion strongly disagreed, and henceforth SCP-2901 began to appear at other future disaster events. This was the precursor of the precognitive scavenging animal-like behavior that is observed today.**}}\n\n{{**Efforts are to continue gradually introducing notions developed by the Foundation as to further SCP-2901's evolution into a more docile and manageable concept.**}}\n\n++++ __{{INTERNAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE:}}__\n{{**Only Foundation personnel with Level-4 clearance are permitted to view this document.  For all intents and purposes, all other personnel are to be included in actively contributing to SCP-2901's perceptual evolution.  It is pertinent that this document be limited to no more than 50 persons, including the O5 council.**}}  \n\n[[/==]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2900]]] | SCP-2901 | [[[SCP-2902]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP-2901-edit1.jpg\t\n> **Author:** LurkD\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2901|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n> **Filename:** IDCARD.png\n> **Author:** LurkD\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2901|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-2901_1.png\n> **Author:** LurkD\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2901|SCP Wiki]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
