Not all of our volunteers and donors like to advertise their career and spending habits. These days, you can get a lot of trouble from the self-righteous masses if they find out you believe in things they don't.\"\n\nShe shifted in her chair. It was more expensive than the civilian clothes she was wearing, probably more expensive than any of the chairs at Site-43. \"I understand that you don't want to talk about this,\" she said. \"And I think you understand that you haven't got a choice, so I don't see any purpose to this prologue beyond expressing your own petulance.\"\n\nShe couldn't tell if the face he made was meant to convey offence or false humour. It was hard to clock the moods of a wizened reptile. \"I'm not accustomed to taking orders from dual state actors. You'll have to forgive me.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"We can pretend I do. Now tell me about Ophelia Righting.\"\n\n\"Never met her. She was on President Bush's campaign staff. That's all I know.\"\n\nThat was all Ibanez knew, too, at least as far as the early 2000s was concerned. Decades earlier she'd been part of a think tank which had turned out to be a //giftschreiber// front, interfering with the results of a Canadian federal election. She wondered what 9/11 and its aftermath would have looked like under an Al Gore presidency. \"The Senate Majority Whip never met one of the president's key advisors?\"\n\nHe shook his head. His neck flaps wobbled like a wattle. \"She vanished from his circle as soon as he was elected. That's not uncommon, as you should know. Politicians serve until political considerations shift. She's probably on a beach somewhere with Karl Rove.\" This time he did try to smile. It made him look like a police sketch from a Special Victims Unit bulletin.\n\n\"Maybe you met her, and you don't quite remember.\" He would assume this was a crack about his age, and she was content to let it be so. \"Big bouffant hair, scar right here.\" She draw a finger vertically across her lower lip.\n\nHe frowned. It looked like he'd simply ceased to have lips of his own. \"You sure you're after the right woman? That sounds more like, what's her name. Shenk. Geschenk.\"\n\n\"Lisbet Geschenk.\"\n\nHe moved to snap his fingers, but then didn't. Probably they would actually snap. She was reminded, as she often was when in the presence of necrocracy, of Edwin Falkirk. \"That's it. You want to talk about donors? She's a donor's donor. I take back what I said. I'll tell you everything I know, because I don't want to end up in front of a grand jury.\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"That bad?\"\n\n\"Worse. Like I said, a donor's donor. Meaning she contributes everything she can contribute, and then contributes more. We think she's propping up other lobbyists and bankrolling people who wouldn't otherwise be moved to donate. We can't prove it, but maybe you can.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_01_Ibanez_Capitol.jpg]]\n\nShe frowned. \"I'm not sure why you'd tell me that. If she's helping you clowns get your funding,\" for a moment she thought the old man might retract his head into his shirt, as his face screwed up tight, \"isn't it shooting yourself in the foot to call foul? What about the next election?\"\n\n\"You're not from around here, Miss Ibanez, so let me explain how Washington works right now. There is no next election. There is no future tense. You do whatever you can to make today go in your favour, you spend everything you've got on the present case, and you let tomorrow take care of itself. You're in my office with the name of Lisbet Geschenk on your lips, which means her time is up. Mine isn't. If I have my way, it never will be.\" His lip curled up so she could see his shrivelled gums and improbably white teeth. \"If you're looking for someone who'll sacrifice their interests on principle, you're looking in the wrong place.

On a day-by-day basis--\"\n\n\"I understand what you mean, Harold.\" The cryptomancer tossed the crumbs out in front of them. They made dark little indentations on the new-fallen snow. \"But you need to understand my position. I trusted Vivian, and Vivian trusted you.\"\n\n\"So if you trust me--\"\n\n\"I do //not// trust you.\" The old man fixed him with a grim glare. \"That's not how the math works. I half-trust you. Anyone you recommend to me would have a quarter of my trust, at best. Nothing you and I have to talk about could conceivably be shared with such attenuation of confidence.\"\n\nHarry whistled. \"If I lived as long as you, would I be able to talk like that?\"\n\n\"You might stop wasting time talking the way you presently do, with a better perspective on how valuable that time is. What did you call me here to talk about, Dr. Blank?\"\n\n\"Elizabeth Crocker.\" He watched as easily half a dozen emotions flashed across Zwist's face in quick succession, blending into each other in various ways. \"Bittersweet?\"\n\n\"The memory is only bitter.\" Zwist stared out at the lake, then looked down at his spread of bread crumbs. \"But ruefulness is like... coffee, with too much artificial sweetener. A false note of humour. Elizabeth Crocker was my enemy. She was also yours, when you were also mine.\"\n\n\"Not me-me,\" Harry clarified, \"but the Foundation-me.\"\n\n\"That's right. She and hers, the //giftschreiber,// have interfered with my work time and again.\"\n\n\"What //is// your work? You always talk about it, the way Scout used to, but all we really know about is 5382.\" It was how the Foundation, or rather Vivian Scout, had first discovered the immortal Austrian in the aftermath of the First World War. A moment of weakness in the mid-1600s had caused Zwist to curse all Germanic languages with an immolation virus transmitted by the written word, which he'd then dedicated his life to eradicating. The Foundation knew it as SCP-5382. Just another number in their massive database, though one with long-lasting implications.\n\n5382 was how the Foundation had first learned of the existence of the //giftschreiber.//\n\n\"I am not about to tell you,\" Zwist half-smiled, \"because you would interfere.\"\n\n\"Something Scout knew about?\" Harry pressed.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And didn't approve of?\" Harry tried to arrange himself more comfortably on the bench. He was wearing ski pants, and they weren't padded. His ass was freezing. \"I know he used to run the hunt-and-capture teams, back in the day. Gave you a merry chase.\"\n\nZwist glanced down at Harry's shifting legs, and really smiled for the first time today. The old man was wearing thick snow pants. \"I led, and he followed, but he had the sense never to consummate.\" The smile became impish, for an instant. \"No, Vivian would have approved, and he knew some things that you do not. Perhaps some day. Rest assured that what I do is for the greater good, and where Crocker's path crossed mine, her intent was quite the opposite.\"\n\n\"It's hard to rest assured when someone who only half-trusts you says they're telling you all you need to know.\"\n\nZwist looked up. A blue jay was circling the clearing. \"Oh, this isn't all you need to know. It's just all I'm willing to tell you, for now.\" He back glanced at Harry. \"Is this how you wish to spend the goodwill between us, Harold? Do you want to talk about me, for you, or do you want to talk about Crocker, for your friend?\"\n\nHarry had tried to convince Zwist to meet with Del, not because he thought it would work out well, but because the security chief had asked. This chilly rendezvous was the compromise, and it wasn't a perfect one by any means. \"Crocker.\"\n\n\"I hear the reluctance.\" Zwist brushed the remaining crumbs from his hands, as an afterthought, then patted Harry on the shoulder. \"It's not an easy choice for you. I won't make this more difficult than it needs to be, then. Elizabeth Crocker is indeed still alive, and she is affiliated with a slowly growing cancer on the collective conscious. An organized cancer. The //neuer giftschreiber.//\"\n\nHarry had heard the term before, had used it himself, but the implications here were new. \"I thought they didn't organize.\"\n\n\"They don't,\" Zwist nodded. \"But //she// does. She's not a pure poisoner, you understand. She came to them from outside.\" His eyes got that faraway look they took on when he was about to monologue, and his words took on the character of recitation. \"The //giftschreiber// have always been a true secret society. Incestuous and secretive. But sometimes a convert can become the best of all believers, and that is the case with her. She has helped mold them into the threat they are today, to face the things that threaten them.\"\n\n\"Us.\"\n\nZwist shook his head. \"Not only you.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. There are others. I suspect a schism. Another faction is at large.\"\n\n\"We already sort of know about that.\" He wasn't sure he should be explaining, but really... who was Zwist going to tell? As far as he knew, the old man spoke to nobody but him. \"We've encountered them, or their agents, elsewhere.\"\n\n//That 'elsewhere' is doing heavier lifting than any other word has ever done.//\n\n\"Is that a fact?\" The bushy eyebrows had now shoved a lot of paper bag skin into furrows in the middle of Zwist's forehead. \"I'm surprised you'd be so free with this information.\"\n\nIf Zwist thought it was too far, it probably was. //Oh well. Make up an excuse, or casually blow it off.// As he usually did, he took the second option with a seasoning of the first, crumbled in like the bread now being hungrily eyed by the descending scavenger. \"Maybe I'm trying to up my trust quotient. Anyway it's nothing you'd be able to act on. The place where we learned it no longer exists, and neither do the versions of us who were there, and saw.\"\n\n\"Very cryptic.\" The corners of Zwist's eyes crinkled with mischief. \"Perhaps we talk together too often, you and I.\"\n\nHarry let the sidebar pass without comment. \"So Crocker is leading the //giftschreiber// against us, and some other renegade bunch of cryptomancers. That much we already figured out. But to what end?\"\n\n\"That is something I have never been able to ascertain.\" The old man reached down and began sliding his hands into a thick pair of woolen gloves. \"They speak of an apocalypse.\"\n\n\"Heard that, too. They seem really excited about it.\"\n\n\"They frame it as a new beginning. Something beautiful. And //imminent.// But they've been doing so for decades. Perhaps centuries. Their organizational sense of time is //longue durée.//\" Zwist certainly didn't seem worried.\n\n\"Do you know what an ancient Foundation facility in Argentina would have to do with it?\"\n\nThat got his attention, if only because the change of topic was abrupt and probably confusing. \"Ancient? How ancient?\"\n\n\"Maybe a century, I don't know.\" It was true. Every time any of them tried to learn more about the place where Del had spent the planning phase of her eviction action on the Insurgency in Zevala, the upper echelons had slapped them with all manner of aggressive stop orders.\n\n\"So, not ancient at all, then.\" Zwist looked up at the sky, and squinted in the harsh winter light. \"Consider to whom you speak. But that is odd... a chronological anomaly. Is it native to where it was found, do you think?\"\n\n\"We don't know. Information is scattered, and... well.\" Harry smiled sheepishly, though Zwist's gaze was still on the clouds. \"Parts of the Foundation trust me and my friends less than you do, so not everything that's known is known by //us.// But let's say it comes from an alternate universe, or an alternate timeline. What would that mean?\"\n\nThe old man blinked. \"It would mean that such things exist.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Well. Sorry for the revelation. Push past the shock. Why would Crocker want that? To learn how to travel through time? Through space?\"\n\nZwist shook his head, and rubbed his face with both gloves until the skin was red. Harry had genuinely surprised him, apparently. \"The //giftschreiber// are anathema to order. Everything they seek to know, or possess, must be bendable towards the aim of dissolution. I have never heard the faintest suggestion that they expect to escape the consequences of their actions.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well.\" Harry looked away. \"We have.\"\n\n\"Do tell.\"\n\n\"I think maybe not all //giftschreiber// are created equal. Some are keeping secrets from the rest. Some of them expect to be whisked away at the end of all of this, and get the chance to start anew.\"\n\nThe jay finally got up its courage, and dove into the snow. They watched as it pecked away at the meager pickings.\n\n\"I have never heard that before,\" Zwist said finally. \"And it doesn't sound like them, to be quite frank. Not at all.\"\n\nHarry shrugged. \"Maybe this is a new direction Crocker is leading them down.\"\n\n\"Lisbet does not lead them, Dr. Blank.\"\n\nSomething startled the bird, and it shot back up into the sky. A streak of blue on grey.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n[!-- [[=image Blank_Zwist_Bird.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 30 January\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe safe in Daniil Sokolsky's office -- or at least the one Lillian was able to find, there were undoubtedly others -- took the seventy-two digit code she'd liberated from his wallet, and //clicked// when she hit the final key.

She'd need her equipment to take a look at the memory itself, to experience it.

It was sheeted over with ice; this winter was colder than usual. There was a signal somewhere out there, and they were following it, though visibility was very poor. As Van Rompay had said, human eyes were unlikely to spot the target before the chopper's sensors did. Still, it felt right to keep on the lookout anyway, even if the pair of MTF agents along for the ride kept glaring at her for keeping the door open.\n\n\"You're taking this very personal,\" the gruff old soldier remarked.\n\nIbanez didn't look back at him. The wind chilled her face, and the roar of the rotors was loud enough that she could only hear him through the headset. \"It's personal whether I take it that way or not. I captured these fuckers. Someone else let them go.\"\n\nThe evidence all added up. An intercepted tip to the London police about suspected cult activity in an abandoned warehouse. A taste of //geistschreiber// energy on the street corner outside. Imrich's calculations tracing a line up the coast, then onto the frozen bay. The signal.\n\nThey were out there, or at least one of them was.\n\n\"They blew up an entire Site,\" Van Rompay growled. \"Nobody 'let them go'.\"\n\n\"I'm not disrespecting the dead.\" Ibanez squinted, as though that would help. The snow was melting on her forehead, and running into her eyes. \"I'm saying that when I catch someone, I expect them to //stay caught.// If they don't, I want to catch them again.\"\n\n\"What //I// am saying,\" and the big man hauled her inside again, \"is that you're leaning out the door of //my// helicopter, and if I have to pull you back in one more time, it will be to chain you to your seat.\" And he pulled the door shut.\n\n\"Fine.\" She glanced at the empty bench, but didn't sit down. She didn't think she could, and she certainly didn't want to. \"But they'd better not miss anything.\"\n\n\"They won't, if there's anything out there not to miss.\" Van Rompay did sit down. He was at that age where he would rather conserve his energy than keep up appearances. \"As long as you stop distracting them.\"\n\nThe pilot up ahead did not react. The copilot was examining his instruments.\n\n\"Easily distracted, your people?\" Ibanez smirked. \"That sounds like a you problem.\"\n\nVan Rompay smiled, but his tone belied it. \"They're used to working with professionals. I don't allow amateurs on my team.\"\n\nHer smirk evolved to a grin. \"You're a real piece of work, Ged. You know that?\"\n\n\"And you're a liability.\" Van Rompay wasn't smiling anymore. \"The Director says you get to come, you get to come. But I'm not going to let you put my people's lives in danger. Let them do their jobs. You--\"\n\n\"What the fuck is //that?//\" the copilot suddenly shouted.\n\nAnd the helicopter banked to one side, hard.\n\nDel had already reached for the handhold on the closed door, so she kept upright, if only barely. The two agents and Van Rompay shifted in their seats. \"Report!\" the MTF commander barked.\n\n\"Saw something,\" the pilot snapped, no panic in his voice. \"Didn't hit us. Could have been a bird...\"\n\nThere was a loud BANG, and the chopper suddenly fell for a brief, exhilirating second. Ibanez felt her boots leave the ground, then slam back down. \"What...!\" she managed, through a rush of breath.\n\n\"What now?\" Van Rompay shouted.\n\n\"Different kind of bird. Took fire.\" The pilot still wasn't panicking, but his tone was very flat and professional now. Clipped. \"We're supposed to own these skies. No civvies around. Gotta be a hostile.\"\n\n\"Dammit.\" Van Rompay gestured at the three of them, Ibanez and a pair of grunts. \"Strap in.\"\n\nShe did, but only loosely. He didn't seem to notice, focused on his own belts.\n\n\"I see it!\" There was finally excitement in the pilot's voice. The chopper banked hard again, in the other direction, and Ibanez felt her armour cutting into the padding of the bench back. \"Looks like a Huey. Sniper at the door.\"\n\nVan Rompay slapped the back of the copilot's chair. \"Weapons free.\"\n\n\"In plain day?\" Ibanez asked.\n\n\"You're goddamn right.\" Suddenly he was grinning at her.\n\nSuddenly she was grinning back.\n\nThere was a roar from somewhere in front of the cockpit, and the entire cabin shook. Something rattled, and didn't stop rattling. Heavy machinegun fire. Ibanez fought the urge to stand up again and take in the view. There wasn't likely to be one, and if there was, she'd be pressing her face to the only thing on the chopper's exterior that couldn't block a bullet.\n\nAs this thought crossed her mind, the pilot pulled them into a corkscrew that threw her stomach into her mouth. A dozen points of daylight suddenly streamed through the roof, and she realized they were bullet holes. Fired between the rotors.\n\nThe sounds from outside now incorporated a high, threatening whine.\n\nVan Rompay slapped again. \"How bad?\"\n\n\"Not great!\" There was a grunt of effort between the two halves of the pilot's report. \"She's sluggish.\"\n\nIbanez stood up, and slapped the back of the pilot's chair herself. \"Can you get her alongside?\"\n\nThe pilot glanced back at her, just for a fraction of a second. \"Alongside what?\"\n\nShe could see the other chopper, a black shape shrouded in white on a grey blanket, out the cockpit window. She pointed at it.\n\n\"Are you crazy?!\" Van Rompay shouted.\n\nShe pulled the door open again and turned to face him, leaning in so he could clearly see the look in her eyes.\n\n\"They're closing!\" the pilot shouted, and banked the chopper yet again.\n\n\"Can't get a clean shot!\" the copilot cursed. Through the door, the black shape resolved into what looked like a Bell Iroquois. Long out of production, but sometimes still in service.\n\nShe didn't wonder whose service this one was in.\n\n\"You're not one of mine,\" Van Rompay was yelling. \"You're a civilian. I'm supposed to protect you.\"\n\nThis time the cluster of holes appeared immediately between his face, and the face of the agent strapped in beside him. Both faces went sheet-white.\n\n\"Good!\" Ibanez threw herself to the opposite door, which was closed, and watched as the other craft approached from the rear, its flank exposed. There was an armoured figure in the gap. He was levelling some sort of rifle; she couldn't tell at this range. \"You can protect me by letting me save our sorry asses.\"\n\nThe pilot looked back at her, and nodded. The Sea King banked harder than it had banked before, and the deck rose up as it canted to forty-five degrees.\n\nShe ran, and jumped.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_02_Ibanez_Jump.jpg]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThere was blood all over her. Some of it, uncharacteristically, was hers.\n\nThe sniper had managed a lucky shot right through her upper arm, where armour met armour, and a few seconds into the skirmish she'd lost all sensation and control on that side. But it hadn't mattered, because by that point she'd already driven the man's rifle into his nose, and put four rounds into the rest of his face. There was one other man in the cabin, and she put him out the door. There was a hole in the ice shaped like him, now.\n\nThe copilot was next, because she wanted a free hand when the crashing started. Her round went through his eye, and spiderwebbed the window, which held. The Huey was already in a spiral, the pilot attempting to throw her out after her first victim, and she used that fact to her advantage.\n\nWhen her feet left the floor, the momentum was more than enough to let her snap the pilot's neck.\n\nOne of the landing struts had broken as they hit the lake at a bad angle, and the rotors had chewed up the ice something terrible, but under the circumstances she thought it had been a pretty good landing.

None of it was visible. But she'd seen it all, in various ways.\n\nStacey dropped her voice to a conspiratorial near-whisper. \"He convinced the Overseer Council, Udo.\"\n\nUdo realized she was going to have to really start paying attention. This was sounding like fodder for her investigation with Del. \"Do you know what it was? The thing he was afraid of?\"\n\n\"No.\" Stacey looked pained. \"He didn't tell me everything. Not even me.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Udo hoped her burning face parsed as empathetic.\n\nStacey bounced on the cushions suddenly. \"So, when should we make the big announcement?\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"Us.\"\n\n\"Oh.

Books everywhere. Random objects in awkward locations. Standing and sitting room only. He'd had it set up like that a decade ago, and was only now settling in in earnest. It wasn't all that different from his office back at 43. \"The point is that I'm here to help you get through this program as quickly and painlessly as possible, so if I'm slowing you down or giving you grief, that's on me to fix.

I've got a government job, and I can't tell you what it is. Don't look into it, and if I'm not here, don't ask me where I've gone.\"\n\nReggie blinked. \"That's... a lot.\"\n\n\"I had a prof at Western who did work with CSIS,\" Altan mused. \"Academics end up in all sorts of weird places.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the truth,\" Harry agreed. \"So, first things first. You're all thesis track, because for some reason you want to be here two years for a thing you can do in one.\"\n\n\"I wanted to do more research before my doctorate,\" Reggie shrugged. \"I like being in the archives.\"\n\n\"I have no idea what I want to do with my life.\" Heng, a Chinese man with muscles that made Harry's arm hurt just to look at them, was grinning. \"So I want this to take as long as possible.\"\n\n\"Those are both very good reasons. Altan?\"\n\n\"Everyone says I write too much. I don't see any reason to stop.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" Harry nodded. \"Well, you've all got a few months before I need your thesis proposals, but you should be thinking about them as soon as possible. The more detailed, the better. You don't want to get stuck working on something that doesn't do anything for you, and you don't want to have to change tack halfway through.\"\n\n\"Is that what you did?\" Reggie asked. \"With your career?\"\n\n\"Yes and no,\" he smiled. \"Have you considered social history, Reggie?\"\n\n\"Maybe.

Because I really do have to be working on this actual case.\" She pointed at the terminal, though the screen was out of Lillian's view. One side was full of chronologically-sorted reports; the other was a stock photograph of Elizabeth Crocker's face.\n\n\"The actual case is what I want to talk about,\" Lillian said. \"But you've been dodging all my calls.\"\n\n\"I'm busy.\"\n\n\"On a case that's been cold for over a decade.

Because there were fifty thousand other things to talk about, and honestly, after you shot that bitch in the face, she stopped mattering so much to you.\"\n\nShe wanted to sit back up in her chair, but she wasn't one of those people who twitched and changed position constantly over the course of a single conversation, so she didn't. It took some effort, though. \"That's very good to know. But why didn't you tell me after? Put it on the record?\"\n\n\"Because once I reported that my memories were still there, TAD made me tell them absolutely everything I'd missed mentioning to Ngo, and then they told me which of those things I could tell anybody else about.\"\n\nIbanez frowned. \"Told you?

Pensak has always been suspicious.

Probably the latter. Nascimbeni stuck his tongue out as he worked his screwdriver through the gunk which had collected over the most recent oil application.\n\n\"You're wondering why I didn't come down to meet you earlier,\" Westbrook said, and Nascimbeni nearly jumped.

Enough to keep it sealed until my next visit.\"\n\nWestbrook made a sour face. \"I doubt we have the budget for replacement parts.\"\n\n\"I'll bring them over from 43,\" Nascimbeni assured him. \"We've got plenty left over from the last time we serviced our lake bulkeads.\"\n\n\"I would appreciate that.

They'd been talking animatedly amongst themselves, heedless of the traffic, when he turned the corner and saw them.

First day with the Home Invaders tomorrow?\"\n\nHe nodded, still not trusting himself to speak. The only thing that had softened the blow of losing his son to the Mobile Task Forces for Anastasios Mataxas was that Rho-43 worked closely with anyone investigating bumps in the night; houses and ghosts went together like pods and pod people.\n\n\"Great.\" She beamed at him. \"Then you and I need to have a talk.

It almost always meant his statements were convoluted and confused, as this one was now. \"You weren't allowed in your locker all day. That's protocol until we've got all the apparatus damage under wraps.\"\n\nThis time Phil looked to the left, shifty-eyed. \"I know, but look.\"\n\n\"You were going to eat cake that had been in your locker for two days?\" Nascimbeni pressed.\n\n\"Can we not talk about the cake?\" Phil whined. \"Why do you want to talk about the cake so much?\"\n\n\"I just think maybe you need someone checking on you more often.\"\n\nThe technician clenched his hands into fists, and bobbed a bit on his heels. \"That's not the point.

Fuck. I hate this. We really need to set up a real Vegas room.\" The slate in the Cognitive Decontamination Tunnel seemed to vibrate when she looked at it. She could feel her brain cells peeling off, as though she were rubbing them against the rough black stone and its deeply-carved sigils.\n\n\"I would have thought the Division already had something like that,\" Euler yawned. She wasn't sure what accommodations he'd set up back at Site-87, but Wheeler's people had agreed that it would be sufficient to isolate his thoughts. The telephone calls were routed through recursive firewire lines looped between half a dozen interdimensional Ways, resulting in a transmission speed very slightly faster than realtime and a signal that could not under any circumstances be traced or hijacked. It had cost a mint.\n\nWhen you were saving the world, the Foundation opened up wallets so secret they practically qualified as concealed carries.\n\n\"Maybe we did.\" Wheeler didn't sound tired, the way Euler did, but she did sound a little confused. Site-41's secure comms room benefited from an effect the Division ordinarily found frustrating, the one that made everyone forget who they were when they weren't in plain view, and that effect was bolstered in a variety of occult ways. Lillian had it on good authority that an hour in that room caused migraines that didn't go away without amnestic treatment, which was fine, because Wheeler took amnestics after every one of these long-distance meetings anyway. \"But we don't have one anymore, and the budget isn't there to replace it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Lillian asked.\n\n\"Because most days we don't have a budget at all. One of the first things I do when I get in every morning is remind the Accounting Department that we exist. One of these days they're not going to believe me.\"\n\n\"Which makes what we're doing that much more important,\" Euler yawned again. The meeting was running long, and he was yawning everything he said. If they didn't wrap up soon, he'd probably fall asleep. \"Lillian will handle the report, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Wheeler agreed.\n\n\"Of course. Because I did most of the work.\" Lillian paused. \"Well, that's not true.\"\n\n\"Certainly it is,\" Euler said. He managed to get it all out without taking an extra breath in the middle.\n\n\"No. I couldn't have done it without you.\"\n\n\"Certainly you--\"\n\n\"Let me be uncharacteristically generous, would you?\" The nice thing about audio-only communication was that she could offset the vocal generosity by pulling a truly outrageous face. //I hate being nice. I __hate__ being nice.// She let her tongue hang out in disgust as she continued to tell the old man how she felt. \"Going against the grain gives me splinters, and we don't have time to listen to me sitting here sucking on my fucking hand.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_08_Lillihammer_Tunnel.jpg]]\n\nHe made a small noise of surrender.\n\n\"The new electronic systems have helped a lot,\" Lillian continued, \"though we're still running into the squish factor. Automation doesn't help when people forget to check their machines. The new drugs have helped a lot with //that,// but obviously it's an uphill battle.\"\n\n\"And it's going to remain that way,\" Wheeler sighed. \"I don't know how many groups there were studying antimemetic phenomena last year -- I don't even know how many there are //this// year -- but I'm sure there must have been more, because there aren't enough now. You're going to need to take up the slack.\"\n\n\"I've been visiting as many of our cells as I can,\" Euler yawned again. \"We want to avoid cross-contamination, of course, keeping them all in their own unique headspaces, but--\"\n\n\"But?\" Wheeler's voice was suddenly hard and hyperfocused. \"I'm sorry, Dr. Euler, but that sounds like a tremendous security threat. Why is it acceptable for you to be acting as a link between these groups? You're endangering the project, if I understand it correctly.\" Wheeler only occasionally made these little asides every year, when Lillian called and reminded her the project even existed. She was a woman who was used to being told she had forgotten something, but she was also a woman who would never be very happy about the fact.\n\n\"There is no linkage, Mrs. Wheeler. I've been cleared for this duty by medical personnel who are fully aware of the situation, and what it demands. There is no possibility of memetic contagion.\"\n\n\"If you say so.\" She didn't sound convinced, but then, he'd offered nothing convincing. Lillian hoped she'd remember to press him on it later. \"The work is going well?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\" Euler sounded very old, but then, he //was// very old. \"It never does. But it //is// going. And it will continue to go.\"\n\n\"Then that's all I need to know. Unless there's anything else...?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lillian interjected, \"my back's cramped up bad enough as it is. And you've got your date with... whatever.\" She'd never understood what Wheeler's annual appointment was about, and the other woman had never elaborated. Perhaps she couldn't. \"Let me know how it goes.\"\n\n\"If I ever find out myself,\" Wheeler said, \"I'm sure you'll be the next in line.

She was even more surprised Sokolsky hadn't understood the meaning of his own memory. Or perhaps he did? Perhaps this was a gift he was giving to her, the knowledge of how...\n\nShe found herself shaking her head. Daniil Sokolsky did not share his toys. Daniil Sokolsky did not give other people the advantages he had. The only difference between him and a billionaire was that his wealth was knowledge.\n\nThat, and he wasn't making up for any deficiencies down below.\n\nObviously he'd been too close to the source material to fully comprehend its import. She understood that. She'd once had the same problem. But now that she had perspective, the perspectives of four different versions of her single self, she could see angles that didn't even exist in the geometry everyone else was used to.\n\nShe closed her eyes, and pictured the room.\n\nThe living room in Harry's childhood home, with its awkward angles and lines that only barely seemed to connect by random happenstance. Her little trick for clearing the mind of all distractions, and honing in with crystal clarity on what she needed.\n\nAs always, when her mind was completely still, she could take a breath and feel it fogging up against the impediment. The only thing which had ever happened to her that she could not in any sense remember. In her mind, she placed a single hand on the block, and conjured up the keys one after another.\n\n//She was standing at the bottom of the DUAL Core shaft, wielding a bottle of white vinegar as though it were a chemical weapon. Which, in this context, it was.//\n\n//The carpet of corpses flowed over the edge of the catwalks above, forming and reforming, a new victim every time. People she knew. No-one she loved, not yet, but it was only a matter of time. She'd been a fool to get so attached. This should never have been her problem.//\n\n//But it was. The bubbling mass of chittering chitin crept along the pipes and conduits, and she began to spray with targeted bursts. The first few came out as mist, and she screwed the tip of the bottle until it offered her more precision. The bubbling biomass retreated from each jet, and the space which already stunk of cutting oil now took on a vinegaric tang. The thing hissed, and pulled back, like a child which had burned its hand on the hob, and the hiss suddenly resolved into words.//\n\n//\"We are going to have you, brother.\"//\n\n//She didn't respond, and she didn't stop spraying.//\n\n//\"We will be __one__.\"//\n\n//And a face emerged from the crawling horde of spiders, billions on billions of them, and the face was spiders, too, but it was also a man she loved, and had lost, and had been forced to lose over and over again.//\n\n//Del Olmo's rippling face spoke in the same histrionic sussurus. \"What do you see, Lillian?\"//\n\n//She raised the bottle higher, and sent the next stream into the thing's false mouth. \"A bad imitation, and an easy target.\"//\n\n//The face exploded, and the spiders came raining down...//\n\nShe shuddered, but kept her hand firm on the obelisk. Had it been an obelisk before? It now had contour, form and shape. She could feel its weight, its chill.\n\n//Wettle was trying to scream, but his mouth was filled with spiders.//\n\n//The effigy of Alis pressed its lips to hers, and the stream of wriggling legs continued to pour out of her, and into him.//\n\n//\"Shush,\" she hissed. \"You know it's right.\"//\n\n//He thrashed his head to one side, and spat out a tremendous globule of saliva-drenched skittering horror.//\n\nShe was openly weeping in disgust, waves of revulsion travelling through her body and pulsating through the corridor wall.\n\nIt was a corridor.\n\nShe was standing in the middle of it.\n\nShe was almost there.\n\n//There were no eyes in the darkness this time. It didn't make any sense, but even her oldest memories were filled with segmented legs and twitching pedipalps. The refinery that towered over them was swaying back and forth, like the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, like a skyscraper made of jelly, only the jelly was a colony of arachnids numerous enough to encircle the moon ten times over.//\n\n//\"You can withstand,\" Rydderech told her, and there were spiders in his eyes. \"You will endure. The memory of dead worlds lives in you.\" He pressed a hand to her forehead, and there were spiders beneath his fingernails. They separated, and the things came crawling out, into her hair, into her nose, and still she didn't break eye contact. She had to hear the end of it. \"You carry them across the gulf between.\" Rydderech's voice was now a sibilant squeal, like all the rest, but it wasn't real, and he was still him. \"You are the vessel,\" he told her, and she knew that it was true. \"You are unsinkable.\"//\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_11_Rydderech_Spiders.jpg]]\n\nAnd she was there.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"flashyhammer\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ##C5000B|2004##\n++ 9 October\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**##990011|Site-06##: Outside Bad Karlshafen, Kassel District, Hesse, Federal Republic of Germany**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nFinally, urgently, as though realizing it was late to the party, a hollow screeching filled the halls. The solid red lights began to flash.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Wheeler.\n\n\"Uh,\" Lillian agreed.\n\nIt was the nuclear overload alarm.\n\n\"How long do we have?\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_12_Wheeler_Ready.jpg]]\n\n\"Twenty-five minutes.\" Wheeler checked the magazine on her pistol, and grunted. It was a grunt neither of satisfaction nor alarm.\n\n\"I thought these things were supposed to go up in a flash.\"\n\n\"Not here. The nukes in containment facilities for slavering beasts, yes.\" The other woman's body language had changed in all sorts of interesting ways since the breach had begun. Lillian suddenly believed the unlikely story she'd heard about tentacles and the fire axe. \"Cut short the rampage before it reaches the exit. But 06 is too important. There are vital assets here. They'll be evacuated.\" \n\n\"I'm a vital asset,\" Lillian said.\n\nWheeler didn't roll her eyes, because she was too busy scanning the corridors. But her voice carried the same implication. \"Sure you are.\" Then her brow furrowed. \"You might be more important to //them,// actually.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\nWheeler gestured back the way they'd come, where one of the //giftschreiber// attackers had made the brief error of attacking them. \"He called you 'the vessel'. Thoughts on what that might mean?\"\n\n\"Zero.\"\n\nThe other woman -- was she an agent? Lillian didn't think she was a doctor, really she only thought of her as Wheeler -- had apparently chosen a direction. Probably she'd memorized the Area's layout on the flight over. She was the type to be prepared like that. \"Zero,\" she mused as they passed from pool after pool of red light. \"The thing that makes all complex math possible.\"\n\n\"I wasn't trying to be clever.\"\n\n\"Maybe you don't even have to try. It just happens.\"\n\nIf Wheeler hadn't been holding a gun, Lillian might have patted her on the head. \"Flattering. But what are you on about?\"\n\n\"The //giftschreiber// are fascinated by your disaster.\" Wheeler poked her head around a corner, then swung around with her weapon at the ready, then ushered Lillian to follow her. \"They think it's the key to understanding themselves. They think there's something intrinsic to it that relates to them.\"\n\n\"You're saying they think it's... //in// me, somehow?\" It wasn't a pleasant thought, but neither was it totally a foreign one.\n\n\"Maybe. Or maybe you're the focus for it. Maybe it happens because of you. All of you.\"\n\n\"He didn't say I'm //a// vessel. He said I'm //the// vessel.\"\n\nWheeler shrugged. \"Well, the most obvious connection would be your memory. Right?\"\n\n\"Right. So it's probably not that.\"\n\n\"But what if it was? You're the only one who remembers everything.\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly.\"\n\n\"Not exactly?\"\n\n\"The Victims remember, too.\"\n\nThat seemed to take Wheeler by surprise. \"Do they?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's why I said it.\"\n\n\"Don't get snotty while I'm saving your life.\"\n\nLillian didn't actually see the man at the end of the hall until they were stepping over his body. Wheeler had hit him centre mass, and he was passed out already from blood loss. Even the gunshot had been lost, as the periodic klaxon reminded them that there were things of this nature all around them, and they had really better leave.\n\n\"Ambrogi told Nascimbeni things he could only have seen in baseline,\" Lillian said as they moved through a windowless hall that put the words //kill box// in her mind, right where she didn't want them. \"He remembered across the boundary.\"\n\nWheeler might have had the same thought, because she was moving like she had purpose enough for a woman twice her height now. \"Anyone else, or just Ambrogi?\"\n\n\"What does it matter? They were all the same. Variations on one mind.\"\n\n\"You know that for sure?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They didn't display any differences between them?\"\n\n\"Well, sure, but... hmm.\" Lillian scratched at the back of her head as they made the next corner, where an inset seating area complicated the otherwise dead simple cris-cross of passages.\n\n\"Yeah?\" Wheeler's jacket might have been full of magnets, the way she pressed herself flush to each stainless steel wall as she took in every possible approach.\n\n\"Yeah, alright,\" Lillian allowed. \"Maybe. //Maybe.// But that's not useful right now. Even if it's just one of them and just one of us, that doesn't explain why it's so damn important. It's just facts. Impressions. Tastes and sounds. What use is that?\"\n\nThe coast was apparently still clear. Maybe they were going to make it after all. \"What use is the only record of a world that doesn't exist anymore?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Lillian nodded, more to herself than to Wheeler. \"Yes. What use is that? Because that world //doesn't exist anymore.//\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Wheeler said. \"They're an apocalypse cult. Your memories are postapocalyptic. It's enough to go on.\"\n\n\"Go //nowhere.// Speaking of which...\"\n\n\"They'll have locked down the elevators. I'm heading for the stairs.\"\n\n\"Good idea.\"\n\nThe next corner shaved itself off in a little cloud of polymer and metal shavings, and Wheeler pulled Lillian to the wall.\n\n\"But apparently not a unique one,\" the little woman muttered.\n\nA voice rang out, a middle-aged man by the sound of it, in the direction they were heading. \"Let's talk!\n\n\"Let's not,\" Lillian found herself shouting, \"and don't say we did!\"\n\nWheeler gave her a look.\n\n\"I've always wanted to say that,\" she shrugged.\n\nAlmost faster than Lillian could see, Wheeler stuck her head and arms around the corner and squeezed off a couple of shots.\n\n\"There's no reason for us to fight!\" the man at the end of the hall shouted again.\n\n\"Says the reason this building is about to explode!\" Wheeler called back.\n\n\"I think you'll find it was your people who set that in motion!\"\n\n\"Yeah! For no reason at all! Just bored, I guess.\" It occurred to Lillian that she was making it easier for the explosion to kill all of them. By the look on Wheeler's face, she wasn't the only one thinking that.\n\nIt probably informed the other woman's decision to once again brave the corner, this time going low, and fire her weapon three times.\n\nShe had to be getting low.\n\n\"You don't need to keep doing that,\" the man shouted. \"Listen to me!\"\n\n\"You're a fucking //giftschreiber//!\" Lillian yelled, and Wheeler took the opportunity to take yet another potshot. \"'Don't listen to //giftschreiber//' is the first rule of memetics!\"\n\n\"I know who you are! I know both of you! I know enough not to want to take my chances.\" The man's voice was dropping in volume; they were all getting used to the klaxons. \"So let's talk, and then make our ways separately to separate exits while there's still time.\"\n\n\"What makes you think we'd ever let you go?\" Wheeler yelled.\n\n\"Because you can't stop me, and be sure of surviving. I don't want to try my own luck, but if you force my hand, it will end badly for you.\"\n\nWheeler met Lillian's eyes. She expected some sort of resistance to what she was going to suggest, but she'd misjudged the other woman's own judgment. \"This needs to stop,\" Wheeler said to her, much too quietly for their enemy to overhear. \"Soon.\"\n\nLillian nodded.\n\n\"Okay, asshole.\" She took a deep breath, and stepped around the corner, hands spread. \"Let's talk.\"\n\nShe was standing at one end of a short corridor. There was a man standing at the other end. There were two men not standing, and not crouching either, one on either side of him. Still, he didn't look worried. He was dressed for a brisk autumn stroll, and his hair was a shock of white.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/48-unforgettable-too/DL_48_13_Keil.jpg]]\n\n\"Dr. Lillihammer,\" he greeted her. \n\n\"And friend,\" Wheeler snarled from behind. Lillian could tell just by her tone of voice that the gun was levelled on him.\n\n\"We should all be friends,\" the old man smiled, \"right now particularly.\"\n\nAs if on cue, the public address system announced: \"Ten minutes to reactor overload.\"\n\nThe adrenaline almost made it hard for Lillian to hear. She found herself nodding frantically. \"Yeah, let's all take the stairs up in friendly silence. Won't be awkward at all, and none of us will blow up.\"\n\n\"Actually, we're not on the way out.\" The pleasant smile became an almost as pleasant grin. //God, but he's confident.// \"We're just coming in.\"\n\n\"Are you saying this wasn't you?\" Wheeler snapped. She was beside Lillian now, and yes, her gun was raised. Lillian wondered if that would make any difference. \"You're not with the attacking force?\"\n\nThe old man nodded. \"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then who are you?\" Wheeler pressed. \"And who are they?\"\n\n\"Think of us as...\" Lillian knew that look. He was choosing which lie to tell. \"...two stones, in search of the same bird.\"\n\n\"I would rather think of you as what the fuck you //are.//\" Lillian wished she had a gun of her own. She made herself a promise to figure out a way to weaponize some of her memetics for close-range combat, if they ever got out of here. \"What the fuck are you? //Giftschreiber?//\"\n\n\"I've been called that,\" he nodded. His hands were still spread wide, as though that might convince them of the goodness of his intentions and the honesty of their parley.\n\n\"And who started the attack?\" Wheeler demanded. She was edging slowly forward. They really did need to be getting a move-on.\n\n\"They've been called the same thing.\"\n\nLillian sighed. \"Cut the shit. We're about to get blown to kingdom come, and my impression is that you guys have made different travel plans for the apocalypse. What are you after? What //bird?//\"\n\n\"Unless I miss my guess, you just left her.\"\n\nLillian blinked. \"...Alis?\"\n\n\"I'm not familiar with the name. But, then, I wouldn't be.\" His grin kept getting wider, and yet never more threatening. \"Very likely yes.\"\n\nWheeler was solid on the trigger as a finger of rock. \"You're trying to get her out of here?\"\n\n\"No. I'm trying to kill her.\"\n\nLillian did a double-take. \"Oh.\"\n\n\"If you think we're going to let you walk past us,\" Wheeler said darkly, \"and take out a prisoner...\"\n\n\"Oh, that's what's going to happen no matter what.\" The man's hands closed, and Lillian saw Wheeler //almost// put a hole in him, or attempt to. \"I'm just taking this moment to lend you a helping hand on the way, since you so obviously need it.\" He waited a moment to see what response they would give. When they didn't give any, he suggested, \"I believe your line here is 'I don't need your help'.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know that.\" Lillian reached out, very slowly, so Wheeler could see it, and lowered her partner's gun. Wheeler allowed it; Lillian knew it was only a gesture, she'd seen how quick the other woman was on the draw. But gestures could go a long way between cryptomancers. \"I like to keep my options open. You're not the first weird old man to offer me cryptic advice. Of course I think you're probably full of shit, but.\"\n\n\"I think someone already said this,\" Wheeler hissed, \"but it's worth trying again: can you two skip the niceties and //get to the point?//\"\n\n\"Good idea.\" The man pursed his lips in thought. \"If you'll tell me where I can find... Alis, did you say? I'll tell you a few things you want to know.\"\n\n\"I want to know a lot more than a few things,\" Lillian snapped.\n\n\"I wasn't offering to let you choose. I have tidbits in particular in mind. You don't have to agree until you've heard them.\"\n\n\"Wow. Real generous.\" She glanced at Wheeler, who shrugged, as if to say //none of this will matter in about ten minutes anyway.// \"Okay, spit it out then. We're on a schedule.\"\n\n\"DETONATION IN TEN MINUTES.\"\n\n\"Good timing,\" Lillian sighed.\n\nThe old man affected a voice that reminded Lillian of the transcripts she'd seen of Thilo Zwist. She wasn't sure how that could translate, but it did. \"We are all marked by ideas, ladies, and ideas are marked by their origins. There are ideas in you which do not originate from here, but other heres. You carry them across the gulf between. Now that we understand, we will not harm you. We need you to finish what you've started.\"\n\n\"This isn't the deal.\" Wheeler raised her gun again. \"This is just more psychobabble. Why don't you--\"\n\n\"I am your mentor's mentor, Dr. Lillihammer, and he did our work before his demise. He does //their// work now, as does another.
