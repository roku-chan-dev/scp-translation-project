All noticeable debris emerging from SCP-6247 is to be retrieved and stored in a secure containment unit at Site-184. Constant monitoring of SCP-6247 for fluctuations in anomalous activity is to be carried out.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6247 is the designation given to a structure found on the seafloor of the Atlantic Ocean. SCP-6247 exists in a constant state of flux between an unconfirmed number of realities, rendering a full mapping of the structure unfeasible. From time to time, debris is violently expelled from SCP-6247 in a manner consistent with that of an explosion. Of note is that all debris recovered from SCP-6247 has exhibited signs of stress consistent with depths of -6,000 meters below sea level. [[footnote]] The Atlantic Ocean has an average depth of 3,646m, with a maximum depth of around 5,000m. [[/footnote]]\n\nA secondary anomalous effect that has been attributed to SCP-6247 manifests as a series of messages encoded through standard Foundation methods; these messages are transmitted repeatedly at regular intervals. The content of these messages is displayed below.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[UNKNOWN COLLISION IN SECTOR 4B.

Upon retrieval, the contents of the box were examined and sent to Site-184 for study due to the site's proximity. The box contained documentation on several unobserved aquatic anomalies attributed to a non-existent Foundation facility located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nNo data recovered has been linked to any existing Foundation operation, and is to be disregarded.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6246]]] | SCP-6247 | [[[SCP-6248]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
