The armies and monsters of Revelations and Ragnarok and older, forgotten myths march across the Earth. The old gods have returned, and brand new gods are waking up. And more are waiting in the wings.\n\nThe Foundation has been split at the seams. Senior staff and the leaders of the Foundation are missing, incapacitated, dead, or making desperate plans on the fly.\n\nThe ends of the world are here, all of them, and we're not ready.\n\n---------\n[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFYpKos1iONgAN_Tw4D5RvwRnM8KT_leo Competitive Eschatology Official Playlist]: You're a god or an entity or a force of nature, and you're here with an agenda.

Then, write whatever you want and throw it up!\n\nAct One is complete and shouldn't be added to, but please feel free to add your story in the appropriate place. If you make your own storyline (or a group storyline), feel free to make your own section.\n\n> **Note:** We're looking for stuff that's //different// here. Don't be afraid to be ambitious. Don't shy away from under-appreciated SCPs and unusual concepts. Please don't just write an incredibly straightforward take on a subject!\n\n--**If your story doesn't fit into the main plot**, then we'll call it a 'splinter' canon and maybe link it in a different section on this page. This includes stories that contradict planned \"Secret Story Arc\" material below.--\n\n**Update:** All current continuations of the main plot are 'splinter canons'. Please feel free to write whatever you like, free of any concerns of officiality, and add the stories to this page! You can begin from \"Act One\" and continue from there, or you cam choose to follow up on any or all of the existing splinter storylines as you like. (But ask permission from the creator(s) of a splinter storyline before you add to their section.)\n\n> ++ **Canon Status** (Updated 10/5/2024)\n> \n> The original planned storyline on this canon is on an indefinite hiatus. Most of the writing guide below still stands on its own, and has been lightly revised to reflect the hiatus.\n> \n> If you want more spoilers for how the original planned storyline was going to end, the writing guide contains hints below, and a sandbox link straight-up spoiling most of our original plans, so read on!  \n\n+ Main Story Arcs \n\n++ The Ends of the World \n\nThe Lock is open, and many more world-enders will be waking up. Or arriving. Or suddenly compelled to do what they were apparently always supposed to do. Maybe-gods like SCP-343, ancient entities like the bear king, modern things like the ink pen, eldritch beings from beyond the stars - the world-enders are coming from everywhere. It's only going to get bigger and messier before the curtains close.\n\n**Writing Suggestions for \"The Ends of the World\":**\n* More vignette collections for this arc, like \"Awakenings\". Remember, one of the big themes of this canon is \"things not going according to plan\" - creativity is key.\n* New world-enders. Any SCP can be a world-ender if you want, and you're not limited to SCPs.\n* Previously established world-enders: what they do next. \n* World-enders clashing with each other. Or maybe teaming up. Or refusing to end the world and trying to help the Foundation or the Serpent's Hand or other entities. Or...\n* Write up something from the perspective of people in the real world. The Foundation might not be public - yet? - but when giants walk the Earth... everyone knows. You can do a character piece, further a subplot, anything you like.\n* Several of us were planning to write crossover pieces for the [[[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/|Wanderers Library]]]. Feel free to jump aboard that ship too!\n\n++ House Divided\n\nPer the Ganymede Protocol, the Foundation has split into multiple independent sites. Only Level 5s knew about this protocol before, and though they don't know //why// the Protocol was enacted (beyond the fact that O5 Command has been compromised and is incommunicado), they know what to do now.\n\n**Writing Suggestions for \"House Divided\":**\n* Foundation members reacting to the end of the world, and to the splitting of the Foundation into myriad independent sites. Making plans, joining sides, handling containment breaches, dealing with the world-enders, simply wondering what the fuck happens now.\n* Do individuals - or whole sites - try and join up with each other? Are there people who agree with - or want to team up with - notable personalities?\n\nNotable \"leaders\" so far: \n> * **The Administrator**\n>  * The current Administrator essentially represents the attitude of the Foundation as a whole. She - and others in agreement - feel that the Foundation has to stand up to the world-enders. Secure, contain, protect. The Foundation will defend humanity, and will //not// take the risk of allying with any of the world-enders. It will be a hard road, full of bluffing and desperate measures, but they will stop the end of the world, without compromising themselves.\n> * **The First Administrator**\n>  * The first Administrator vanished some time ago. Unbeknownst to the Foundation until now, he never truly went away. He has been operating as both \"Nobody\" and [[[SCP-990]]]. For starters. Somehow, the first Administrator has made himself a world-ender. How? Why? No one knows. To the first Administrator, and those who agree with him, the world has to end, one way or another. Their goal is to end it in a way that lets the Foundation - and humanity - come out on top.\n> * **SCP-343**\n>  * Is SCP-343 the real God, a powerful reality bender, or something in between? Who knows. Either way, He wants to do what Revelations foretold: a new heavens and a new earth. But He's got to end //this// version first. He would certainly welcome any Foundation personnel on His side... and some of them already are.\n> * **Dr. Light**\n>  * Newly - and perhaps shakily - allied with the Serpent's Hand, Sophia Light doesn't want the world to end. Turns out a whole lot of people agree with her, and not just in the Foundation. Ever the pragmatist, Light and others who agree with will be allying with anomalous entities to stop the end of the world. Even some reluctant world-enders themselves. A devil's bargain? A massive mistake? Some risks have to be taken.\n\n++ //Secret Story Arcs//\n\nAnything on the following list is something we have fairly specific stuff planned for any \"official\" canon continuation. As of 2024, this is on indefinite hiatus, so if you want to contact the authors listed below, please feel free, but understand you may at best just get our memories of what we've planned, unless this changes and we decide to write the originally planned Act Two in the future!\n\n> * The Judeo-Christian Apocalypse: The events of Revelations are coming to pass, though… not quite as planned.\n>  * War (Contact: Dexanote)\n>  * Famine (Contact: Sophia Light)\n>  * Pestilence [Forthcoming] (Contact: Sophia Light)\n>  * Anything else (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * [[[Qntm's Proposal|SCP-001: \"The Lock\"]]] (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * [[[SCP-008]]]: \"Zombie Plague\" (Contact: Sophia Light)\n> * [[[SCP-598]]]: \"Sentient Color\" (Contact: Sophia Light)\n> * [[[SCP-1000]]]: \"Bigfoot\" (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * Dr. Light (Contact: Sophia Light)\n> * The Harbinger (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * Asherah (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * The Greco-Roman pantheon (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * The \"classic\" Groups of Interest, specifically: The Global Occult Coalition, The Church of the Broken God, The Chaos Insurgency, The Factory, and MC&D. This list does not include \"Nobody\" because you can understand him from reading the canon, and it doesn't include the Serpent's Hand because they have a million splinter groups. (Contact: thedeadlymoose)\n> * \"Stirrings\" Arc: Ancient nature gods waking up in North America. (Contact: Skara Brae) //Note: Skara Brae currently cannot be contacted.//\n\nThis is not a list of everything we've used, just what we have (or had) something in mind for that you can't get by just reading the canon as of Act One.\n\n\nFinally...\n\n++ The Way It Could Have Ended\n\n...here is a [http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/eschatology-project-hub sandbox link] outlining some detail many of the original plans for Competitive Eschatology. Please feel free to take any of those ideas you like, or ignore them all. \n\nIf we do continue the original storyline, we reserve the right to use anything there--or change everything completely.\n\nHappy writing!\n\n-------\n\n+++ Original Inspirations\n\nThis is an incomplete list of stories we used as inspiration for the story so far.\n\n> * [[[Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench]]]\n> * [[[Post Finem]]]\n> * [[[Unfinished Business]]] & [[[Unfinished Business II]]]\n> * [[[In His Own Image]]]\n> * [[[Containing Yourself|Contain Yourself]]]\n> * [[[Thaumiel|Project Thaumiel]]]\n> * [[[The Flytrap]]]\n> * [[[Incident 239-B - Clef-Kondraki]]]\n> * [[[tales-from-the-bright-side-chapter-one|Waiting on God...
