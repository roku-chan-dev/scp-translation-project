Any individuals who wish to perform testing upon SCP-4342 are free to do so.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4342 is a folded paper cube with a mild glow emanating from its interior. Incredibly, when exposed to external stimuli, SCP-4342 is capable of changing the colour of this glowing light as well as doing something on occasion. Due to the miraculous nature of these anomalous properties, SCP-4342 is currently under intensive testing.\n\n------\n\n**Test Log 4342-1:**\n\nFor experimental purposes, SCP-4342 was exposed to a variety of stimuli, with any responses being recorded.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** Being touched by Dr. Marsleigh.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** Being left in a dark room.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** Being locked in a small box.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n> \n> //Fascinating...// - Dr. Marsleigh\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** Being thrown against a wall.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 does something. As a result, the wall becomes lost[[footnote]] Judged no longer recognizable or functional as a wall.[[/footnote]].\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** A dead body.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes red.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Marsleigh\n> **Stimuli:** A medium-rare sirloin steak.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 does something. As a result, Dr. Marsleigh becomes lost[[footnote]] Judged no longer recognizable or functional as a human being.[[/footnote]].\n> \n> //While the loss of Dr. Marsleigh is unfortunate, the advances SCP-4342 could bring us mean we simply cannot abandon our research. Testing shall continue.// - Dr. Shaw\n\n------\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Being set alight.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Being spat on.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue, then becomes red.\n> \n> //This is a milestone in our understanding of SCP-4342.// - Dr. Shaw\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** SCP-682\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue. SCP-682 is visibly confused.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Drawn on with crayons.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes red.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Drawn on with a pencil.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 cycles between red, green and blue for ten seconds.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Drawn on with a pencil (second attempt).\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr. Shaw\n> **Stimuli:** Drawn on with a pencil (third attempt).\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 does something. Site-22 becomes lost, along with all on-site personnel and anomalies[[footnote]] Judged no longer recognizable or functional as extant matter. [[/footnote]].\n> \n> //The risks of testing SCP-4342 are far outweighed by the benefits. More test.// - Site Director Bir (Site-44)\n\n------\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** Shot at by security personnel.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 does something. All security personnel present become lost.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** Put down in front of SCP-914.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes red.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** A map of the United Kingdom from 1893.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** SCP-682\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes green. SCP-682 is again visibly confused by the test.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** Licked by Site Director Bir.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes blue.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** Read a bedtime story.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes green.\n\n> **Testing Personnel:** Site Director Bir\n> **Stimuli:** Being touched by Site Director Bir.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 does something. Site-44 becomes lost, along with multiple neighboring settlements and significant portions of Mexico City. Through a thorough disinformation campaign blaming damage on a natural disaster and use of the prototype [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4156 KALEIDOSCOPE] system, a SK-class Broken Masquerade scenario is narrowly averted. \n> \n> Testing procedures of SCP-4342 are submitted to the Overseer Council for review.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum 4342-1 (O5 Judgement):**\n\nFollowing a thorough review of the testing procedures concerning SCP-4342, as well as the results of said tests, the Overseer Council has - following consultation with Internal Security and the Ethics Committee - unanimously prescribed the following action for all future SCP-4342 research:\n\n> More test! More test!\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4341]]] | SCP-4342 | [[[SCP-4343]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** scpcube.jpg\n> **Name:** paper cube\n> **Author:** Jose Sa\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/28271674@N00/2245786780 Flickr]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
