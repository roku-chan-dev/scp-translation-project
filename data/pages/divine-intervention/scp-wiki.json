I see no reason to deny it. Could you do me a favor, though? Pass me that grape juice box on the bedside table. I would get up and grab it, but my bones aren't what they used to be anymore. \n\nThank you.\n\nHow refreshing. Now, what was it you wanted to ask me about?\n\nAh, //that//. You had another name for it, at least before the changes happened. What was it again? [[[SCP-6500]]]? My, my, how far along we've come since the days of little old me, huh? Anyway, forgive me for reminiscing, it's all I've got left nowadays.\n\nBut yes, The Impasse. To tell you the truth, my child, I knew of it since it's waxing days, though I said nothing of it in hopes that you and yours would notice. It took far too long for your superiors to realize the world was at stake, and even longer for them to act. Unfortunate, yes? \n\nHmm?\n\nWell, I couldn't interfere. It's not up to God to decide what happens to His creation. You have free will for a reason, my child. You were made in my image, after all, and I love you all so much.\n\nYou do your best as a Father.  You raise your children; You prepare them for the world and then You let them go.  You can’t swoop in every time Your children are struggling. \n\nTo do so would undermine the point of raising children.  If they can’t solve their problems on their own, if they need You to save them every time they falter, then they’re nothing more than Your pets. I love you, so I respect you enough to save yourselves.\n\nI see.\n\nDoubt is such an ugly emotion to feel. But I do not fault you for it. After all, faith is blind trust in a higher power, and me being who I am, I did nothing to intervene. Yes, I am aware there were many lost. I know it was ugly. But like I said, I trusted you to save yourselves.\n\n[[>]]\n//Click.//\n[[/>]]\n\nWhat's this now? \n\nHmmm. I suppose there is only one way for us to know the truth or not. Pull the trigger, my child. Find out for us both, for I do not know myself. Do it.\n\nDo it, and face the truth no matter what.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[>]]\n+ BANG!\n[[/>]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[div class=\"meta-title\"]]\n[[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** [[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]SCP-343[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]VNP-343[[/span]]\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** [[span class=\"cycling\"]]Uncontained[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]Neutralized[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]Uncontained[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]Neutralized[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]Neutralized[[/span]][[span class=\"cycling\"]]Uncontained[[/span]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[module css]]\n.cycling {\n    width:0;\n    display: inline-flex;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    animation-name: cycle;\n    animation-fill-mode: forwards;\n    animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n    animation-duration: 1s;\n}\n\n.cycling:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.16666s;}\n.cycling:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.33333s;}\n.cycling:nth-child(4) { animation-delay: 0.5s;}\n.cycling:nth-child(5) { animation-delay: 0.66666s;}\n.cycling:nth-child(6) { animation-delay: 0.83333s;}\n@keyframes cycle{\n  0% { width:auto }\n  16.6% { width:auto }\n  16.7% { width:0 }\n  100% { width:0 }\n}\n\n\n.meta-title {\n  border-bottom: solid 1px #bbbbbb;\n  color: #990011;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  margin: 0 0 0.6em;\n  padding: 0 0 0.25em;\n  font-size: 200%;\n}\n.meta-title p {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n\n[[/module]]",
