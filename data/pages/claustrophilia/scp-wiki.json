Good, good! I was worried for you, you know. You slept for way longer than usual, I thought that you might've went into a coma or something. Do you feel me holding you? Keeping you nice and cozy?\n\nDid you dream of me last night? I know that I was dreaming of you. You know I don't sleep, it's just... it's just, you know!\n\nNo, no you can still lay down, don't get up just yet, please just stay still! Won't you stay just a little longer? Just for me? There's no need to go out, see? It's still dark outside. It's still cold, way too cold for you. And you wouldn't want that, would you? Humans are feeble little things.\n\nThat's what a house is for, to protect humans.\n\nWhere are you going? Leaving the bedroom already? Oh, breakfast. I can help with that. Everything is already done and made. No need for that milk, I ordered it myself. And- No, don't worry about that stove either! I made it sure it couldn't ever hurt you. You won't have to lay a finger on any of that stuff ever again.\n\nWait, wait, why are you putting on your shoes? Where did you get that coat? I thought I... No, no, no, no, no... Where could you possibly need to go? Everything is here, right?\n\nWork? Friends?\n\nThey don't miss you, they can't possibly miss you. They never do. They forgot about you the moment you were gone, but I hold onto everything. I hold onto //you.// I know you. I love you.\n\nWhere are you going? What are you doing?\n\nPlease don't touch the door, please don't go, your warmth, it...\n\nIt's locked, see? You'll just have to stay with me for a little longer, stay inside of me, where it is nice and warm. It's okay, no need to look scared, we have a lot we could do together.\n\nYou're pulling too hard, stop, please. It hurts. It doesn't like that, //I// don't like that. Why would you hurt me? I never hurt you after all. I never have, and I never will.\n\nI can show you everything, I can talk about our history together, you... you have those games, don't you? Could always play some of that, it's always fun to watch you try your best at... what was it again, F-Zero? Yes, that one.\n\nThe window? No, no, they don't open anymore. Not since last time, I made sure to fix them to keep you from accidentally breaking them or letting the cold in! I will keep you safe.\n\nPlease just sit down. Stay. Please, please.\n\nAre you still looking for your phone? Darling, you should know that it's long gone. You don't need it, we both know this.\n\nWhy are you upset? Haven't I been good to you? I am your house, I am your warmth, your comfort. My entire existence is to keep you nice and warm inside of me, and so I will do just that. You belong here. You belong inside of me and nowhere else.\n\nOut there, you are nothing. There is nothing but hatred in this cold, bitter world. But here you are mine. I am full, I am well.\n\nPlease just sit down. Here, I made the couch nice and cozy, I heated up the fireplace again. I can play your favorite song through the floorboards, anything for you. Just please don't go.\n\nWhy are you scared of me? You're safe.\n\nYou're loved.\n\nWorshipped. Don't you get it?\n\nA house hungers to keep someone happy.\n\nTo keep you happy.\n\nDon't you understand? I need you.\n\nI //need// you. I always have needed you.\n\nAnd I know you need me.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/troutmaskreplica-human/outside.jpeg width=\"800px\" align=center]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
