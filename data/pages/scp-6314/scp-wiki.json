At the discretion of the project supervisor (currently Dr. Sara T. Kothari), compatible SCP-6314 instances may be allowed to share enclosures temporarily or indefinitely.  All instances are to receive at least two hours of social interaction, either with other instances or Foundation personnel, each day.  See individual entries for special containment procedures unique to specific instances.  Special containment procedures for individual instances override the general containment procedures here if contradictory.  \n\nAs of current regulations on \"Amazing Alliterative Animals\", SCP-6314 are to be contained in Hall ██ of Site-66.  To prevent possible [[[[scp-redd |DATA EXPUNGED]]]], all 25 instances are never to be contained in the same facility.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nNow that [[[scp-2217 |Hypothetical Lifted Veil Scenario 2217]]] has been realized, all contained SCP-6314 instances (with the exception of SCP-6314-W) are to be released from Foundation custody.  Dr. Kothari has been entrusted with the task of redistributing SCP-6314 to the custody of appropriate groups and individuals.\n----\n+++ Description  \nSCP-6314 is the collective designation for a set of 25 anomalous animals which appear to have been designed as pets for children.  Each instance is of a different species and displays different anomalous qualities, but all possess the following traits in common:\n* **Negligible senescence.**  Though adults, SCP-6314 do not appear to age or grow.\n* **Cellular regeneration.**  SCP-6314 rapidly regenerate from physical injuries.\n* **Perfect health.**  SCP-6314 have never contracted any illnesses, pathogenic or otherwise.\n* **Anomalous diet.**  SCP-6314 do not appear to require either food or water to survive, but become increasingly uncomfortable after long periods without either.  Instances will consume food appropriate to their species or any form of commercially available pet food, typically preferring the former.  Regardless of diet, no waste is produced; food and water vanish upon reaching the instance's stomach.  Carnivorous and omnivorous species refuse to consume other vertebrate animals; those capable of speech universally claim that doing so would be \"gross.\"\n* **Enhanced intelligence.**  Many instances display intelligence roughly on par with a human.  Said instances are also fluent in English, though most are illiterate.\n* **Domestication.**  SCP-6314 are universally docile and friendly toward humans, especially children.\n* **Branding.**  All instances bear markings somewhere on their bodies which spell \"[instance's name], by Dr. Wondertainment\".  Each instance was recovered alongside, or able to produce when asked, a variation of the same document.  Reproduced below is the version that accompanied SCP-6314-S, the first instance contained.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"show attached documents\" hide=\"hide attached documents\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blokquote-alt\"]]\n\n**Wow!** You've just found yourself your very own Amazing Alliterative Animal, a brand new series of Fantastic Friends and Perfect Pets brought to you by Dr. Wondertainment!\n\nFind them all and complete the Zany Zoo!\n\n01.

The Russian branch of the SCP Foundation supervised containment of Cyrillic instances until the fall of the Russian Federation during the Second War of the Flesh, at which point custody was transferred to the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#DATSSU Department of Abnormal Threats to the Security Service of Ukraine].  WonderCo representatives have confirmed that there were once plans to create Alliterative Animal series for multiple languages, but only the English and Russian sets were produced before post-Veil restructuring led to the project's cancellation.  As the Cyrillic instances are already in GoI custody, the remainder of this document concerns only the English series.[[/footnote]]  The lack of capitalization for #18 and misspelling for #22 are present on all versions of the document.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n-----\n\n+++++ Addendum 6314-1\n\nSCP-6314-A, -B, -D, -E, -G, -L, -M, -r, -U, and -X are not in Foundation custody, and in most cases their whereabouts unknown.  As these objects are presumably no more dangerous than the instances that are in containment, and would therefore qualify for the anomaly release program were they contained, efforts to locate them have been abandoned.\n\nAttached is a relevant log of messages between Dr. Kothari and Site-66 Director Louis Martin.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"show attached documents\" hide=\"hide attached documents\"]]\n[[div class=\"console\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"console-header\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n-----\nSCIPNET COMMUNICATION LOG\n-----\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++++++ Sara Kothari\n10 instances of SCP-6314, over one third of them, remain uncontained.  We've got decent leads on -A, -G, -r, and -X, but the other six are complete unknowns.  I therefore recommend that the remaining instances be located, contained, and documented before those currently in containment are released.\n\n++++++ Louis Martin\nBased on the instances currently in containment, it can be safely assumed that the others are no more dangerous than non-anomalous animals.  As such anomalies would qualify for the release program were they already in Foundation custody, attempting to contain them in the first place would be counterintuitive.\n\n++++++ Sara Kothari\nWhile the remaining instances of SCP-6314 may not be a threat to human life or the nonexistent Veil, they may themselves be in danger.  Although these animals are immortal, they are nonetheless capable of suffering.  If the unknown instances are in the possession of groups who are mistreating or exploiting them, it is our obligation to protect these creatures by removing them from such situations, even if it is just to redistribute them to better homes.\n\n++++++ Louis Martin\nThe welfare of objects not requiring containment is beyond the scope of the Foundation's mission.\n\n++++++ Sara Kothari\nConsider, then, the psychological well-being of the instances that are in containment.  Several instances have expressed a desire to reunite with the rest of their \"family,\" and claim to miss their \"siblings\".  They will all be negatively affected by the redistribution of instances to different locations, but I believe that allowing them all to briefly reunite beforehand (while ensuring that all 25 are never in the same facility at once, of course) would mitigate this effect somewhat by providing some sense of closure to them.\n\n++++++ Louis Martin\nThe \"psychological well-being\" of objects not requiring containment is beyond the scope of the Foundation's mission.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n+++++ Addendum 6314-2\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=carlos.jpg\n| caption=SCP-6314-C sleeping in its habitat\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=hubert.jpg\n| caption=Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapua'a in Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapua'a's aquarium\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=napoleon.jpg\n| caption=SCP-6314-N being held by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8726 Researcher James (age 13)]\n]]\n\nSCP-6314-C is a male //Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris// (capybara).

It seems, however, that this is not the case, as SCP-6314-O was removed from containment by a Global Occult Coalition representative this morning, before I arrived.  I did not have a chance to assist in this transfer of custody, brief the GOC rep about the object, or inspect the conditions in which it would be transported and kept to ensure the object's safety.  I do not object to SCP-6314-O's transfer to ICSUT, but I do object to this apparent override of my authority on this object, and I sincerely hope that this is the last time such a thing will occur.\n\n++++++ Louis Martin\n\nYou approved the transfer and ICSUT and the GOC filed all the necessary paperwork.

I fear that SCP-6314-O may come to harm in my absence.\n\n++++++ Louis Martin\n\nAs I said, your presence was not required.

Well, you used to.  They were being killed by the thousands, during the War.  People ate their ground-up scales, thinking that would cure the Red Death.  They almost went the way of the elephant.  But you didn't do a thing about it.  You had in your hands something that could save the whole pangolin family, but all you did was keep him as a pet.  Even after the Veil lifted, that's all you had in mind for him.  You were going to give Percival to Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and let the rest of them die.\n\nLucky for the pangolins, I decided to intervene.  It wasn't easy to alter his effect like this, but it was worth it.  Now, instead of being the most trafficked mammal on the planet, they're probably its safest.  That includes Percival - he's safe with me, and you needn't worry about him anymore, even if you do somehow manage to remember that he exists.\n\nBy the way – [[[pleasing-to-the-eye |Mel]]] (you know, the moose) wanted me to tell you that xe's perfectly safe and happy where xe is.

It possesses no notable properties beyond those shared by all instances.\n\nAs SCP-6314-Q is potentially immortal and one of only (at time of writing) three living quaggas, it has considerable conservation value.  After experimentation with a female quagga[[footnote]]produced by [[[SCP-646]]][[/footnote]] determined that the object's offspring do not inherit its anomalous properties, all specimens were entrusted to the [https://quaggaproject.org/ Quagga Project] for use in quagga re-breeding efforts.\n\nLogs relating to the transfer of SCP-6314-Q's custody have been omitted, as they did not involve notable interactions with sentient anomalies or Groups of Interest.\n\n**Update:**  Shortly after SCP-6314-Q's transfer, the Quagga Project and all its assets were acquired by Marshall, Carter, and Dark LTD.  All quagga specimens, including SCP-6314-Q, were relocated to an unknown location, and the object's whereabouts remain unknown.  Dr. Kothari was not informed of this development, as it occurred after the events of Addendum 12.\n\n-----\n\n+++++ Addendum 6314-9\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=sammy.jpg\n| caption=SCP-6314-S posing for the camera in its habitat\n]]\n\nSCP-6314-S is a male //Lampropeltis elapsoides// (scarlet kingsnake).  Though intelligent and capable of speech, its vocabulary consists almost entirely of words beginning with the letter \"s\".  It possesses a cognitohazardous effect that limits speech directed at the object to such words.\n\nSCP-6314-V is a female //Micruroides euryxanthus// (Sonoran coral snake), though scales that would normally be red on a non-anomalous coral snake are instead a vivid violet hue.  Instance has similar properties to SCP-6314-S, but related to the letter \"v\" instead of \"s\".  Unlike other SCP-6314 instances, -V is generally hostile toward humans, particularly those it perceives as authority figures.  However, Dr. Kothari has gained the instance's trust over time and with the assistance of SCP-6314-S.\n\nSCP-6314-S and -V share a close emotional bond and are able to communicate with each other nonverbally.  For this reason, and because SCP-6314-S's presence seems to have a calming effect on -V, both instances were contained in the same habitat.\n\nMuch like SCP-6314-K, SCP-6314-S was slated for adoption by retired Foundation personnel.  SCP-6314-V was deemed unacceptable for adoption or transfer to GoI custody, however, as its human-level intelligence, venomous nature, general hostility, and documented anarchist tendencies made it non-negligibly more dangerous than a non-anomalous animal.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"show attached documents\" hide=\"hide attached documents\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"console\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"console-header\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n-----\nSCIPNET COMMUNICATION LOG\n-----\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n+++++ Sara Kothari\nWhile SCP-6314-V is normally hostile towards people, I have been working with her for years and have gained her trust and cooperation over that time.  Additionally, SCP-6314-V is consistently less aggressive when in the presence of SCP-6314-S, the instance with whom I have the most experience.  I therefore propose that these instances simply be kept in containment.  Although this would be an exception to the anomaly release protocol, I feel that it is a justifiable one, given the unique relationship between these two instances.\n+++++ Louis Martin\nI cannot allow exceptions to the release program for such a trivial reason.  There is no reason -S cannot be adopted, and Site-66 is well-equipped to contain -V, with or without any marginal decrease in hostility due to your presence or -S’s.\n+++++ Sara Kothari\nI still feel that separating both instances would be detrimental to the mental health of both, leading to an unnecessary increase in -V’s aggression levels.  To avoid this undesirable outcome, I propose that they both be released from containment and entrusted to my custody.  For reasons previously stated, I believe that I am the ideal caretaker for both instances.\n+++++ Louis Martin\nI cannot grant this request.  -S is to be released from Foundation custody, including the personal custody of active Foundation personnel.\n+++++ Louis Martin\nAdditionally, please note that transfers to the custody of retired personnel would also be subject to my approval, and that it would be inappropriate for a retired employee to adopt an object whose containment they previously supervised.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nLogged below is Dr. Kothari's initial attempt to separate SCP-6314-S from SCP-6314-V.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"show attached documents\" hide=\"hide attached documents\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"logs\"]]\n[[div class=\"logs-header\"]]\n[[size 150%]]\nVideo Log\n[[/size]]\n**> RECORDING STARTED <**\n[[/div]]\n[[table class=\"dialog\"]]\n \n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n//Dr. Kothari enters the shared enclosure of SCP-6314-S and -V, which are curled in the corner under a sunlamp.//\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n \n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nDr. Kothari\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell class=\"active\"]]\nSalutations, Sammy. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nSCP-6314-S\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell class=\"active\"]]\n'Sup, Sara! \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n \n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n//Dr. Kothari sits down on a large rock.
