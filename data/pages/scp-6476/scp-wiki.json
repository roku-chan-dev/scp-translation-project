Every six months, researchers will organize a single session with D-class personnel to ascertain whether SCP-6476's anomalous traits have reactivated.

[[/footnote]] will continue monitoring online storefronts and reviews for mentions of \"magic\", \"special\", and/or \"enchanted\" dice.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6476 is the collective designation for a series of six-sided dice created by Raul Nandes de Jesus (PoI-6476, \"rollinboxcars\") for a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) played by members of GoI-5869 (\"Gamers Against Weed\").\n\nAll instances of SCP-6476 were made with translucent green plastic, engraved with Arabic numerals, decorated with gold paint, and contain a weighted metallic core. Whereas mundane \"loaded\" dice favor specific outcomes during play, instances of SCP-6476 influenced local probability outside the game.[[footnote]] Specifically, within 2-7 days of each planned event. [[/footnote]] When activated by a two-thirds majority vote, this effect (termed SCP-6476-A) increased the likelihood of arranging an online meeting between all participants every two weeks, while reducing interruptions and obligations that would otherwise disrupt the event.\n\nWhen used to advance TTRPG gameplay, instances of SCP-6476 induced an anomalous state of hyperphantasia,[[footnote]] Vivid mental imagery, comprised of all baseline human senses. [[/footnote]] enhancing the user's capacity for visualizing descriptions of in-game setting, character and action. This effect (termed SCP-6476-B) was heavily stylized and consistently distinguishable from reality.\n\nAs of 2019/03/16, all anomalous effects associated with SCP-6476 have ceased.\n\n||~ Instance ||~ Anomaly Status ||~ PoI # ||~ Username ||~ Role ||\n||= SCP-6476-1 ||= Unknown ||= PoI-6476 ||= rollinboxcars ||= Game Master ||\n||= SCP-6476-2 ||= Neutralized ||= PoI-7331 ||= alwaysbpositive ||= \"Leena\", human bard ||\n||= SCP-6476-3 ||= Unknown ||= PoI-6660 ||= meatgerm ||= \"Throndir\", elf ranger ||\n||= SCP-6476-4 ||= Contained ||= PoI-9791 ||= twilight_tone ||= \"Rose\", halfling druid ||\n||= SCP-6476-5 ||= Contained ||= PoI-9102 ||= WHEREISMYHOG ||= \"Puck\", halfling thief ||\n||= SCP-6476-6 ||= Contained ||= PoI-7132 ||= whistl_stahp ||= \"Helga\", dwarf cleric ||\n\n**Discovery:** During standard sweeps of international mail, MTF Alpha-4 (\"Pony Express\") identified an anomalous package sent from the mainland United States to a post office box in Moreno, Brazil. Securing the scene, MTF Alpha-4 seized two additional packages of contraband, all of which were marked \"return to sender\". Attempts at tracing PoI-6476 have failed, as all data on his postal registration documents is fabricated or incomplete.[[footnote]] Raul Nandes de Jesus is described as \"male\", \"3d6+10\" years old, with \"joyous\" eyes. The address field reads, \"choose one\".

One such asset, **[[[being-known|Codename NEMO]]]**, agreed to participate in PoI-6476's game in hopes of assessing his anomalous abilities and further ingratiating themselves with the community.\n\nOperational protocol dictates that LEVEL 3/CLOWNFISH assets remain anonymous to persons outside their local working group. For more information, see Document 5869-512-03, \"Project CLOWNFISH Executive Summary\".\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Partial Experiment Log [LEVEL 3/CLOWNFISH CLASSIFIED]\" hide=\"- Partial Experiment Log [LEVEL 3/CLOWNFISH CONFIRMED]\"]]\n**Testing Protocol**: Seeking empirical evidence of SCP-6476-B's anomalous effects, NEMO's working group prepared a battery of tests for \"Session 2\", 2018/12/22. In all the experiments listed below, NEMO's activities were monitored using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and [[[goc-supplemental-arad|VERITAS Resonance Imaging]]] (VRI).\n\n> **Subject**: Control (NEMO narrating, SCP-6476-B inactive)\n> **Description**: NEMO visualizes standing \"in a field, in a stiff summer breeze\", taking a bite from a \"bright red\" apple. They roll one standard polyhedral die (1d6) to represent throwing said apple at a target.\n> **Results**: NEMO visualizes striking the target.\n> * EEG results baseline.\n> * VRI detects zero anomalous activity.\n> * Estimated VVS: 64/80.\n> **Comments**: NEMO previously scored a 64/80 (above average) on their standard employee Visualization Vividness Scale (VVS) assessment.\n\n> **Subject**: Session 2, Test 1 (PoI-6476 narrating, SCP-6476-B active)\n> **Description**: The group interacts with patrons of a crowded bar. Music, food and drink are described in detail.\n> **Results**: NEMO experiences strong visual, auditory, olfactory and gustatory responses.\n> * EEG confirms heightened activity in the parietal, temporal and visual areas.\n> * VRI detects EVE spike: ARAD 300-700 Caspers, sharp, orange, loose.\n> * Estimated VVS: 78/80.\n> **Comments**: NEMO notes that they have never tasted real mead, and cannot attest to the accuracy of the experience.\n\n> **Subject**: Session 2, Test 2 (PoI-6476 narrating, SCP-6476-B inactive)\n> **Description**: The group engages in social intrigue. NEMO rolls a set of mundane dice and lies to PoI-6476 about the resulting outcome.\n> **Results**: No effect.\n> * EEG and VRI detect zero anomalous activity.\n> * Estimated VVS: 67/80.\n> **Comments**: Cheating during the game does not elicit a response from PoI-6476. Other participants continue play, suggesting that imagery generated by SCP-6476-B is specific to each individual participant.\n\n> **Subject**: Session 2, Test 5 (PoI-6476 narrating, SCP-6476-B active)\n> **Description**: The group engages in battle. NEMO's character tries to dodge enemy attacks.\n> **Results**: Simulated motion is blurred and exaggerated. NEMO does not experience any vestibular disorientation or pain response, even when their character is struck in combat.\n> * EEG confirms heightened activity in the parietal, temporal and visual areas.\n> * VRI detects EVE spike: ARAD 500-800 Caspers, sharp, orange, loose.\n> * Estimated VVS: 74/80.\n> **Comments**: SCP-6476 appears to have built-in countermeasures against loss of balance or psychosomatic injury as a result of play.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addenda:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 6476-1: Excerpts from GoI-5869 IRC logs, 2018/11/23\" hide=\"- Close Addendum 6476-1\"]]\n> **rollinboxcars**: hey, can I do a self-promo/LFG post in this channel?\n> **rollinboxcars**: or is that against the rules\n> **bones**: That is perfectly acceptable.\n> **twilight_tone**: yeah, I've posted my commission info in here a few times.\n> **acuterobot**: me too!\n> **rollinboxcars**: sweet, ty\n> **rollinboxcars**: short version: I'm starting another TTRPG campaign!
