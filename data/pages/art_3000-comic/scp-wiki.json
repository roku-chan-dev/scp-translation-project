To be frank, this comic is 25 pages in total and I've already completely sketched/panelled it out, I just have to find the motivation to finish it. :'D anyways...here are pgs 7, 8 and 9!**\n\nhi everyone, im making a comic about SCP-3000. despite it being one of the more popular SCPs and the many videos and fanarts made about it, I hardly see the story of Krishnamoorthy and Mannava explored. In my opinion, their story is the main emotional payoff, so I wanted to honor it. That being said, the dialogue is taken directly from djkaktus & co.'s writing, but mishmashed and Frankensteined together so it would fit in a comic format. sorry about that, I tried to do it in a way that still kept the theme and tone of the story, but wasn't overbearing. \n\nThe images are 72ppi, so if it's blurry you'll have to zoom in. I'm a little excited to show this off, so this page will look a little lame until i upload more pages. or until i find the motivation to learn CSS.\n\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/79FGYot.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/FgiiNvl.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/YXElQdO.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/DQKDvnS.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/1zHCPGg.png]]\n\n\nthnx for reading, btw.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 79FGYot.png\n> **Author:** [[*user ephalets]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/79FGYot Imgur]\n\n> **Filename:** FgiiNvl.png\n> **Author:** [[*user ephalets]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/FgiiNvl Imgur]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
