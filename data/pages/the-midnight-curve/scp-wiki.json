This poem is part of the [[[end-of-death-hub|End of Death]]] canon. More of Tufto's work can be found [[[tufto-personnel-file|here]]].\n[[include info:end]]\n\n> The following is from the juvenilia of the early Imperial poet Ruth Harlequin (born 1994). Despite the clear compositional flaws of this early work (dated to 2497) it provides an early glimpse at the themes she would explore in the 27th and 28th centuries.\n\n1.\n\nOn the dirt paths that lead away\nFrom dusty English hedgerows in the grey,\nWhen the setting sun turns the grass\nInto a strange and pinkish pallour,\nA pallour of desperation,\nWhen the hungry sun paws and claws at the memory of its former self.\nThat time of hazy day when the beast shines down\nAnd all seems hidden,\nAll a lie beneath its happy rays.\nAll is turned, now, turned to dusk,\nThe truth of night crawling slowly\nAs shoes kick up the frail dust on the path\nAnd the trees rustle in the breeze\nAnd you watch.\n\nMud turned to grass turned to mud\nAs sheep and men tread upon it, \nIn timeless veneration of the old ways\nOf the old rites bleeding through\nTo make our present lives so quick in rot and ruin.\nLines become pronounced, paved, expanded,\nMonorails and trains rise like mausoleums\nFor the notion of a mausoleum.\nTombstone carriages are rushing through the night\nTheir living peering meekly\nOver deep lakes and dishonoured paths\nWhere shepherds used to ply their trade.\n\nWhat was it like to have ancestry?\nTo know the turning of the seasons, the play of weather and weir\nThat would take one's maiden aunts, one's grandmothers,\nOne's smiling childhood faces\nThat never had any worries except in one's understanding, long after the fact\nOf adult and childhood memory\nAnd arguments ill-understood.\nTo be, to live, to exist upon a wire\nStrung out in a continuing spiral\nOf birth, maturity, love, age, death-\n\nSeeing in the old woman by the firelight, with stories so distant\nThe future of one's self, looking into the eyes of her past\nA thing remote, of distance, of mystery\nOf patterns long-sketched out and barely changing\nSo timeless that all meaning came only from continuation,\nNo endings or beginnings.\nOnly the repitition in endless cycles of seasons\nSnow falling on autumn leaves falling on summer grass\nOne life in many lives, one meaning in many meanings,\nNo death in the knowledge of continuation, of having been made complete,\nTo an everlasting rest, or oblivion, or both,\nAnd all was settled,\nA whirlpool of perpetual autumn,\nA ballerina dancing with her face still smiling,\n[[[end-of-death-hub|And then the clocks all stopped.]]]\n\n-----\n\n2.\n\nThe cottage is bare\nThe food is all gone\nShe stands outside\nInside the autumn cold\nOne more day\nOne more life\nAnother movement,\nAnd the Reaper dies\nAnd the breeze runs through\nAnd it howls its way\nAnd knocks all the pots\nAnd has nothing to say\nAnd she is undone\nShe has no more to do\nThe sun is not raising\nIts hullabaloo\nThe thatch and the straw\nEnters its maw\nThe house\nThe house\nThe house is\n\nWhen they find her,\nComing in from the long field\nAnd the golden corn,\nThey rush to comfort her,\nLaying down their burdens to help, to aid,\nWhile all around the wind rips in,\nSlicing new wounds\nMaking new thoughts\nThe desire to just stop, just for a day,\nAs the open sky rides roughshod on their backs\nAnd makes them too old, too old for sleeping on the fields\nSo [[[hypnotraline|they swallow the bitter pill]]]\nOr [[[ii-tab-po-c-h20-qhs-prn-pain|sell themselves for dreaming]]]\nAnd the sun seems a little lighter on their back\nWhile the trees grow from their hearts,\nTheir lonely hearts,\nToo old for caring, for [[[until-death-do-us-part|loving]]]\nWhen the story that bound them is gone\nAnd there's no profit at [[[there-s-a-hole-in-the-bottom-of-the-wishing-well|the wishing well]]].\n\n-----\n\n3.\n\nThe building is not used any more. The men and women inside pack it up, weeping slighly, wishing there could be some other way but there is none.\nThe rain keeps falling, falling, as they say a goodbye, a funeral to funerals, Morecambe and Sons packs up its coffins and bereavements and organisational frameworks and sympathetic mourners and walk out into the storm, the lightning falling but not hitting, to become new people.\nThe roof begins to fall in, as urban explorers and adventurers and pain-lovers looking for rusted nails come traipsing through.\nSterilised rats keep staring through the holes, as the wallpaper chips, as the leaks intensify, as the innards are eaten and looted\nThe worms of the overworld gnaw through walls, gnaw through wallpaper, gnawing, gnawing\nThe iron rods embedded in the concrete rise out of their crumbling mountains\nIt is an ending, it is a beginning, it is a death\nThe reapers of the mind will always come, killing forms to make anew, killing poems to spring them up again, change and death and change and death until there is no difference\nUntil the ballerina and the dance are one\nUntil it's all iron-\nThe ruin awakens, crying as a newborn. It sits where it was, perfectly still, as the men and women inside shine lights, weeping slightly, happy that they have found this place in which they can be\nThey light candles and sing songs of the old country, that discovered country,\nThey play guitars and form workers' communes and don't think about the inscription,\n\"Memento Mori\" above the door,\nIt's not words any more. It's just a form, a geometric shape,\nA monument to alchemical precision\nNobody speaks Latin any more\nLatin is a dead language\nAnd nothing is dead\nLife expands into its space-\n\n-----\n\n4.\n\n-and expands more. Its greenery\nRises up from the rainforests, from the savannahs,\nFrom the gaps between the sands, from the ocean floors,\nInexorably, constantly, rising,\nRising,\nThe tendrils merge and split and coalesce\nIn blocks of mass that dominate\nLike the furnaces of empire\nAnd squeeze the air out of the sky\nSpreading into nooks, into crannies,\nInto the gaps between the atoms\nInto mouths and noses and the breathing bodies\nThat can't breath or struggle any more.\nAnd all is immobile\nIn the endless march of life\nIn the cessation of all cessation\nAnd there are no more ancestors,\nNo more stories, no more creation\nJust the green,\nMoss and lichen, flesh over flesh\nThat can't be seen\nBecause only the life can see,\nAnd the life is growing\nEating, consuming\nColonising, imperialising\nMaking all one\nAcross the stars, making all one.\n\nIn the one there is nothing. A zero\nIts absolute line singular and eating\nItself into itself into nothing.\nA ballerina moves, in timeless grace,\nSpinning and spinning and spinning more\nFaster, faster, deeper, keener,\nThe human frailties and flaws ironed out\nThe motion's weakness becoming strong\nReinforced iron leaking from the armpits\nWhich are not armpits but hinges, joints,\nThe face is scrubbed away, the hair flies off\nThe flesh is moved into movement, into light,\nInto insubstance,\nSpeed upon speed so that even the fire goes\nAnd all that's left is movement\nAnd the movement becomes the circle\nAnd the circle goes on forever\nSilent and still in its fury and noise.\nLolling and lolling and lolling.\n\n-----\n\n5.\n\nA man sits. The light is reflected\nIn the wet milk of his eyes\nAs the other man smiles and waves and slicks his hair back with a mullet grin\nAnd stares out of his box\nInto the eyes, the milquetoast eyes\nHis own existence oozing into the air\nNo sleep, no dreams, no pentecostal fire,\nJust an open mouth, lolling,\nAnd the television sirens calling.\n\nThis is but one state of being\nIn a world so ordered in its flux\nA span of a thousand generations\nWhere one can sit and stare\nAnd then get off their feet and walk\nMarch, mine, replace\nCreate empires and kingdoms and New Kowloons\nReinvent oneself a thousand times\nExperience it all, under the sun,\nBecome mulch, become man\nBecome alive in another way\nThat seems the same as every other way\nBut slowly, slowly,\nThat ordered chaos cracks its edges,\nThe whirlpool does not last, the hurricane retreats\nThe waves begin a new pattern\nA swirl of activity to prove them wrong\nTo prove them all wrong-\n\nAnd so, five centuries after we started\nWhile the midnight curve stretches ever on\nNew worlds and ideas, with all the time on Earth\nThe body perfected, the mind swirling upwards,\nThe promise of future, of the reclamation of the damned,\nOf the end of death truly ending death-\nAnd still I think back\nTo the dirt paths\nTo the grandmothers\nTo the lives that were not parades of novelty\nOf whipping-dens of orgies choosing their own trauma\nInstead of time thrusting it upon them.\nUnder the maglev lines and concrete halls\nWhere the dirt tracks lie\nIn a quiet silence, under the bare stars\nA blade of grass that bitter water grows\nIn memory of all that went before\nTakes its old place, its old pattern,\nBy the sheep trail\nAnd looks up\nAnd blinks\nAnd dies.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
