Every word. Matchless. The best content on the site. ||\n|| [[[lily-s-proposal|SCP-001: Lily's Proposal]]] || [[*user LilyFlower]] || Justly famous, and deserves all of its plaudits. Wonderful companion piece to [[[SCP-6999]]] (see below). ||\n|| [[[shaggydredlocks-proposal|SCP-001: S. D. Locke's Proposal]]] || [[*user s-d-locke]] || //Step into the daylight, and let it go.// ||\n|| [[[SCP-504|SCP-504: Critical Tomatoes]]] || [[*user blastyoboots]]  || Probably my favourite Series 1 skip: devilishly simple concept executed with aplomb. Very, very funny. ||\n|| [[[SCP-1425|SCP-1425: Star Signals]]] || [[*user silberescher]]  || I have a certain preoccupation with Fifthist SCPs, and 1425 is a classic of the genre. ||\n|| [[[SCP-2764|SCP-2764: The Eldritch Antarctic]]] || [[*user Choiwel]]  || I've been thinking about this on and off since I read it. Many SCPs try to do something with repetition and recursion, but this one absolutely nails it. ||\n|| [[[SCP-2874|SCP-2874: DON-BURTEN EXPLOSIVE]]] || [[*user Tanhony]] || A simple idea, a terrific almost-format screw. Strong influence on my own [[[SCP-6106]]]. ||\n|| [[[SCP-3004|SCP-3004: Imago]]] || [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]] || Criminally underrated during 3kon, this is probably the best religious article on the site because it actually understands what it means to have gods, and what it is to believe. Exceptional. ||\n|| [[[SCP-3034|SCP-3034: The Counting Station]]] || [[*user the-great-hippo]] || Frightening and upsetting, and an excellent introduction to SCP for newcomers. ||\n|| [[[SCP-3519|SCP-3519: These Quiet Days]]] || [[*user sirpudding]] || Affecting and disturbing, this SCP is a faultless depiction of failure and collapse. Another Fifthist article. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5031|SCP-5031: Just Another Murder Monster]]] || [[*user PeppersGhost]]  || My favourite SCP on the site, and a very strong influence on my work. A beautiful depiction of kindness, friendship, and humanity amid institutionalism. It's a masterpiece. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5232|SCP-5232: Roses in Her Eyes]]] || [[*user GerrymanderBassist]]  || Never fails to make me well up. A delight, and a huge influence on the feel of my work. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5488|SCP-5488: Ratings That Stick]]] || [[*user HarryBlank]]  || A very old-fashioned SCP, but in the best possible way: takes an unusual but immediately appealing concept and pushes it as far as possible, to the delight of the reader. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5510|SCP-5510: Universal Remote]]] || [[*user aismallard]]  || The perfect short-form SCP. ||\n|| [[[SCP-5733|SCP-5733: Return of the Suburb Slasher]]] || [[*user dysadron]]  || Freaky, upsetting, masterfully written. ||\n|| [[[SCP-6999|SCP-6999: Nearer, My God, To Thee]]] || [[*user elenee-fishtruck]]  || //Out of my stony griefs, Bethel I'll raise.// ||\n|| [[[SCP-6273|SCP-6273: The Empty Skin]]] || [[*user PeppersGhost]] || A chilling horror story. The best of the HARBINGER anthologies. ||\n|| [[[SCP-6427|SCP-6427: Night Hour Crunch]]] || [[*user Fishish]] || Fantastic little semi-format screw, neat and tidy little story, a real jolt to read. Excellent. ||\n|| [[[document-recovered-from-the-marianas-trench|Document Recovered From The Marianas Trench]]] || [[*user Dr-Gears]] || Obviously, it's a classic, but what's important about the Marianas document is how much of its tropes are now commonplaces - from the wandering log so important to [[[SCP-5000]]] to the refusal to explain some of its pieces. It's a really good snapshot of the mood that makes SCP so addictive. ||\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
