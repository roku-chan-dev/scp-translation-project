The locals refuse to accept the American way of life, and are abandoning their stations in the gold mines and coral reefs. Many more have perished to plague.

It is as if the locals know of something that we do not.\n\nRegardless, it is clear that the locals must be corralled in order to abate this.

I will see to it that your organization is reimbursed for your efforts to contain the Great Old One. But as you know, the old gods cannot be kept asleep forever. Regardless, our efforts are not over; humanity will prevail in the face of this darkness. I will see to it that any available funds are directed to your Foundation, so long as you continue to consider the interests of Terblanche Enterprises.\n\nIndeed, the company has been making an amazing progress in these past several years. As you may know, our relationship with our partner Belgium was never the same after the death of my acquaintance, the good King Leopold. But you Americans have fitted like a glove, and what we've accomplished together back in Hawthorne has attracted the local attention of the highest members of the growing National Party, and some foreign eyes as well. Though the end result was unsatisfactory, the strength of what we can accomplish together cannot be understated.\n\nI would like for you to consider strengthening our partnership. I am willing to fund as much researches of you Yankees as necessary as long as I receive a part of the gold to expand my collection — and speaking of which, if you give this offer of mine a chance and come to Cape Town, do so on March 20th. I am going to conduct a special exhibition of advanced thaumaturgic practices to a few admirers of my work, from handheld transcievers to static electricity. Feel free to invite any acquintance of yours, regardless of their liking, and send me a response as soon as you can.\n\nThe next decade will be ours, Fritz — and dare I say the century as well. God bless you and I,\n\n[[[businessmen|Nathan]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Footnotes\" hide=\"- Close Footnotes\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8775]]] | SCP-8776 | [[[SCP-8777]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=ubergoober and local lesbian commie]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
