He acts as a herald of the King's will, and devours whoever stands in the path of the Scarlet Horde.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Page_121_%28Beyond_Fantasy_Fiction_Volume_1_Issue_1_1953-07%29.jpg]]\n\nA depiction of Kenkgor among the illustrations of a mad, nameless artist who witnessed the Scarlet Horde.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Lord Kenkgor is a colossal creature possessing a dark, spidery body with only a massive mouth for a face. His lips are large and plump. Kenkgor is known to have a constant grin that shows off his massive teeth. He moves about with tendrils.\n\n**Nature:** The Mouth is a gluttonous creature known for possessing great strength, and devouring enemies whenever possible. The destruction of others brings him satisfaction. It's claimed that Kenkgor prefers his victims to have suffered, finding them to taste better.[[footnote]] \"From what I read this is like salting meat for certain beings. Some like it when flesh becomes more tough from stress. Maybe a similar standard applies to Kenkgor, but I doubt that he is a picky eater.\" - M[[/footnote]] He accumulates power each time he feasts, assimilating the essence of others into himself. In the process he also grows larger. This has caused him to be a difficult foe for many across Creation. However, he can lose that power from a ferocious battle, or regurgitating it for his master to grow stronger off of.[[footnote]] \"That last part sounds disgusting. Surely the King has better ways to gather power.\" - L.B.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"He uses all methods at his disposal. Admittedly, it's wise of him to use Kenkgor in bringing him the essence of others from beyond his domain. There are many who will try to kill him outside the safety of the Darkness Below.\" - M[[/footnote]]\n\nKenkgor is loyal to the Scarlet King, speaking nothing but praise for him. Within the court he is said to be like a hound by his side.[[footnote]] \"So he's like a royal pet?\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"He is derogatorily referred to as such in a few texts, but I guess you can look at it that way.\" - M [[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** It is said that Kenkgor was born within the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-maker-and-the-beast Great Abyss][[footnote]] The Great Abyss is a massive tear in Creation where many beasts, great and small, originate from. It is famously known for being dominated by the goddess Yaldabaoth before her imprisonment by Mekhane. For further information on the Great Abyss consult a Librarian for relevant texts, and read the Hand's entry on it. [[/footnote]] where he aimlessly devoured whoever he came across. Eventually he found his way to the Darkness Below, and met the Scarlet King in his youth. He greatly admired how the King devoured his own siblings to become stronger despite being small and weak at the time. Kenkgor pledged his allegiance to him ever since. As a result, he is recognized as the first soldier of the Scarlet Horde.\n\nThe King then began his conquest of the Darkness Below with Kenkgor by his side. Together they had killed many who resisted, and others soon joined them. When the King finally established his kingdom he rewarded Kenkgor with lordship.\n\nKenkgor typically commands over conscripts and the children of A'ghor[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dust-and-blood A'ghor is the second bride of the Scarlet King.] [[/footnote]] due to their disposable nature. If they are accidentally eaten by him during a battle it would be of little consequence. He also collaborates with his fellow lords regularly, especially [[[Lord Jeser]]].[[footnote]] Jeser, also known as the Prince of Many Faces, is a dangerous deceiver within the Scarlet King's court. Consult the Hand's entry on him for further information. [[/footnote]] The surviving children of A'habbat[[footnote]] A'habbat is the seventh bride of the Scarlet King, and widely known for defying him. As a result, her children oppose the Scarlet Horde. See their entries for further information.[[/footnote]] loath Kenkgor. At the suggestion of Jeser, he was used by the King to execute them alongside other punishments.\n\n**Approach:** The best course of action is to flee from Kenkgor. Being consumed by him will just benefit the Scarlet King. A mortal can only hope he falls in battle against someone stronger than him.\n\nIt has been proposed to poison Kenkgor with the most vile concoction possible to bring about his end. However, attempts so far have caused him to become temporarily ill to serve as a distraction, and offer a chance to escape from his maw. They became collectively known as Kenkgorian poisons. It is useful to have a bottle of one if you ever find yourself in the presence of the Mouth. The recipes for them can be found in the third volume of //Encyclopedia of Arcane Poisons//, but print outs of just the passages are available at request.[[footnote]] \"In case anyone new reads this, you go to me for print outs. It's better than carrying around the whole book, but it does have plenty of other useful knowledge. I recommend reading the volumes if you get the chance. You never know when it could save your life.\" - M [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Those are big ass books, M. I don't think anyone is patient enough to read them, especially without falling asleep.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Speak for yourself, Kunj.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]] It is encouraged to create new poisons in the hopes of killing Kenkgor.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\n//\"The Gluttonous Lord devoured every colossal beast as far as the eye could see. None were spared from his gaping maw, and he too devoured the great forest in scoops for the smallest of creatures. Then he drank up the small oceans of water nearby, revealing their bottoms. Meanwhile, the children of A'ghor destroyed what they could as they were ordered to by the Mouth. Soon there was nothing left of that great forest except ruin.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //The Atrocities of the Scarlet Horde//\n\n------\n\n//\"Everyone was able to hear the Mouth as he shouted orders in a demonic tongue. In the horizon he was bigger than the tallest mountain I have ever seen, casting a great shadow over the land. With him were soldiers and spawn of the Scarlet King. We tried to resist them by firing our holiest of cannons, but there were too many of them. Meanwhile, Goran[[footnote]] Referring to [[[Lord Goran]]], another subordinate within the Scarlet King's court. Consult the Hand's entry on him for further information.[[/footnote]] was sieging the capital, which prevented us from receiving aid. Then came the time to finally flee through the Ways as the Mouth laughed in triumph.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //Exodus of the Da'vo Christians//\n\n------\n\n//\"Kenkgor consumed the poison as planned, but he did not perish. Instead, he thrashed about in agony while gnashing his teeth. Quite a number of the Scarlet King's minions where crushed beneath him, including some of the children of A'ghor. In the cursed, ancient language of the Great Abyss he howled obscenities. Despite the failure of the poison to end his wicked existence, the suffering of Kenkgor was nonetheless a delight to behold.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //Encyclopedia of Arcane Poisons: Vol. III//\n\n------\n\nThe following is a rhyme about Kenkgor. The demon prince [[[Vassago]]] is often credited for it, and featured within the legendary //Necronomicon//.\n\n//Beware the Mouth of enormous girth,\nHe who swallows both sea and earth.\nTo one in tribute he loudly sing,\nTo Darkness Below - the Scarlet King!//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\n\nAn argument could be made that the Mouth possesses an ulterior motive for serving the Scarlet King.[[footnote]] \"I think you can make that argument for nearly everyone in his court. They either serve him or die.\" - L.B.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"True. Jeser immediately comes to mind.\" - M [[/footnote]] He could have killed him when he was most vulnerable, which some find to be suspicious that he didn't. However, it is likely that Kenkgor's motives aren't anything grand. Perhaps he simply saw an opportunity with the King to indulge himself.[[footnote]] \"I wouldn't be surprised if that is indeed the case. Joining the Scarlet King's side is the best thing to happen to him. He gets to eat many beings across Creation like a buffet.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"I think it is a mix of him being opportunistic while also genuinely admiring the King.\" - W [[/footnote]] It is ultimately just speculation, and what is certain is that Kenkgor is a hungry beast.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** Page 121 (Beyond Fantasy Fiction Volume 1 Issue 1 1953-07).jpg\n> **Author:** Sanford Kossin\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Page_121_(Beyond_Fantasy_Fiction_Volume_1_Issue_1_1953-07).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
