I got to get all dramatic because! Well it was fitting. I had to get kinda creative with the anomaly because there wasn't a super great description of it(Which is not a fault of the article at all). I also got a little artistic license with the definition of a \"fetal position\" but I wanted the monster to be REALLY looming over Micheals.\n\nI love this article. It's such a clever idea. I read it after the video log was removed and I actually went back and checked out the video log to check if there was a better description of the anomaly and I definitely agree that it does better without it. The simplicity with the strong payoff of the concept really really makes it\n\nI honestly don't have anything else to say besides seriously go read it.\n \n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
