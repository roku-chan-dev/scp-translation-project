Regardless of the number of actual deaths, the Foundation is to report the number as Fibonacci(//n//), where //n// is equal to the number of days since 06/06/2025.\n\nShould an independent report submit a verifiable case of death by dysentery, that report is to be added to the sum, and SCP-4946 is to be reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4946 is a probabilistic anomaly observed in reported human deaths as a result of dysentery.\n\nBeginning on 06/06/2025, the sum number of reported dysentery deaths per day has been equal to position //n// in the Fibonacci Sequence, where //n// has been equal to the number of days since 06/06/2025. Research into such deaths reveals that, aside from standard statistical error, all recorded deaths before current containment procedures were enacted were the results of otherwise non-anomalous cases of dysentery.\n\nIt should be noted that SCP-4946 does not represent the actual number of human deaths by dysentery; SCP-4946 merely represents a sum total of published reports.\n\nCurrent containment procedures were developed and implemented on 02/07/2025. As a result, actual human death by dysentery appears to have been eliminated entirely. Foundation Intelligence ÆŸU-4946 has been assigned to mislead the public regarding the disappearance of fatal dysentery cases.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4945]]] | SCP-4946 | [[[SCP-4947]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
