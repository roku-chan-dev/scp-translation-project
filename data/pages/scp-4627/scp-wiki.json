Any residents of the area that have been absorbed will have an appropriate cover story fabricated to explain their disappearance. All civilians in the immediate area must be treated with amnestics, as absorption does not always occur when a person enters the anomaly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4627 is a spatial anomaly that manifests near inattentive travellers. It creates non-existing pathways, roads and locations (hereby referred to as SCP-4627-A) that resemble the area it appears in. The initial manifestation is usually discovered by those not familiar with the area, or who are not paying attention to the route they are taking. These people will invariably follow the route of a manifestation of SCP-4627-A, as opposed to continuing along their intended path.\n\nInstances of SCP-4627-A superficially resemble the area surrounding the anomaly, and will connect to other pathways along the way, including pre-existing paths and other SCP-4627-A instances. In addition, these instances will create other objects and entities that logically would be located alongside the path, such as parks, buildings, flora and fauna. These connections will constantly change, with entrances moving around both inside and outside SCP-4627.\n\nFurther studies of this anomaly have revealed that instances of SCP-4627-A are non-Euclidean in nature, and cannot be observed from above. Additionally, attempting to enter instances from anywhere other than the entrance has proved unsuccessful, due to the non-Euclidean nature of these pathways. However, it has been found that radio signals can still be received from inside the anomaly. Attempts to track how these signals transmit show that each signal emanates from the point-of-entry, regardless of how far the radio device has been taken inside.\n\nAs the anomaly continues to manifest, more interconnecting SCP-4627-A instances will appear, until the point where people will become \"absorbed\" by the anomaly, unable to find their way out. This is due to the fact that the layout of SCP-4627 changes, with exits constantly changing location. When the anomaly reaches this point, all people inside are to be considered lost, as attempting a rescue mission will only cause more loss of personnel.\n\nAt an undetermined point in time, the anomaly will start creating humanoid creatures, referred to as SCP-4627-1. These humanoids resemble people located in the area affected by SCP-4627, but with very slight differences in appearance. Otherwise, there are no discernible differences between these creatures and regular human beings.\n\n**Explorations:** Catalogued below are the explorations undertaken inside manifestations of SCP-4627.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Exploration-4627-01\" hide=\"- Hide Log\"]]\n> //**Opening statement:** Exploration was conducted by Researcher █████████, using D-9571 to explore the anomaly. Subject's history showed violent tendencies. Both were equipped with a radio. In this case, SCP-4627-A had manifested as the entrance to a street.//\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Hello, please test your radio.\n> \n> D-9571: Test, I guess?\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Good. Please enter the street.\n> \n> //D-9571 enters SCP-4627-A//\n> \n> D-9571: Okay, now what? Am I meant to explode or something?\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Please, keep walking into the street.\n> \n> //D-9571 walks approximately 10 metres into the anomaly//\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Good, stop there. Now please test your radio.\n> \n> D-9571: Uh, hi?\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Loud and clear. Now, continue walking until you can no longer see us.\n> \n> //D-9571 continues walking until they have turned around a corner, and are no longer visible to Researcher █████████.//\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Radio test.\n> \n> D-9571: Yep, still here.\n> \n> Researcher █████████: What can you see?\n> \n> D-9571: Just looks like a normal street, with houses. Kind of quiet though, can't see anybody here.\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Please continue on, and tell us what you see.\n> \n> //D-9571 stays silent for a few minutes.//\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Hello?\n> \n> D-9571: Yep, still looks like houses to me, also I've hit a dead end.\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Alright. Please return to the entrance.\n> \n> //D-9571 remains silent for a few more minutes//\n> \n> D-9571: Huh, swear that street wasn't there before.\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Please elaborate.\n> \n> D-9571: Oh, uh, I came past this area earlier, but I remember there being, like, a purple house here before. Now there's a new street. Maybe my memory is just bad though.\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Continue moving back to the entrance.\n> \n> //D-9571 stays silent again for several more minutes//\n> \n> D-9571: Uhhh...\n> \n> Researcher █████████: What is it?\n> \n> D-9571: I'm here, where are you guys?\n> \n> Researcher █████████: We are still waiting at the entrance. We do not see you.\n> \n> D-9571: Wait no, this is different, this is definitely different. There's an intersection here now! It changed!\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Please calm down, we will—\n> \n> D-9571: Shit, I'm going to die here aren't I?\n> \n> Researcher █████████: Calm down D-9571, rescue can—\n> \n> //The radio went static at this point. It is assumed that D-9571 destroyed it in a fit of violence. Upon further inspection, the static signals were found to be emanating from the location that he entered at.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Exploration-4627-02\" hide=\"- Hide Log\"]]\n> //**Opening Statement:** This exploration was performed by Dr ████, using D-5724. Subject had suffered several panic attacks in the past. Both were equipped with radios, and D-5724 was additionally equipped with a day's worth of rations, a flashlight with spare batteries, and a harness attached to a pulley system. In this case, SCP-4627 had manifested inside a large office building, with SCP-4627-A manifesting as a door that had previously not existed.//\n> \n> Dr ████: Please check that the rope is taut.\n> \n> //D-5724 tugs at the rope//\n> \n> D-5724: Yeah, seems fine.\n> \n> Dr ████: Please enter through the door.\n> \n> //D-5724 enters and looks around//\n> \n> Dr ████: What can you see from inside?\n> \n> D-5724: Lots of cubicles. Ugh, I hate offices.\n> \n> Dr ████: Are there any windows?\n> \n> D-5724: Yeah, there's windows. I can see the city outside. Looks like I'm on the top floor? (**Note:** Analysis of security footage did not show D-5724 as being visible from outside the building at any point during the expedition)\n> \n> Dr ████: Please continue through one of the doors. \n> \n> //D-5724 can be heard opening a door.//\n> \n> Dr ████: What can you see now?\n> \n> D-5724: Just a ton of hallways. There's one to the right that seems to go to another room of cubicles. Wait, shouldn't that be where the edge of the building is?\n> \n> Dr ████: Please enter the hallway on the right.\n> \n> //D-5724 enters the hallway, reaching the next room of cubicles//\n> \n> D-5724: This is really weirding me out. It doesn't make sense. This is past where the windows were.\n> \n> Dr ████: Are there any windows in this section?\n> \n> D-5724: Uh, yes. I can– wait, what the fuck? Now I'm near the bottom of the building!\n> \n> Dr ████: Please continue the exploration.\n> \n> D-5724: What is happening here?\n> \n> //Dr ████ remains silent//\n> \n> D-5724: Whatever.\n> \n> //D-5724 continues walking for several minutes, silently.//\n> \n> D-5724: Hey, I'm at some sort of kitchen now.\n> \n> Dr ████: Describe your surroundings.\n> \n> D-5724: It looks pretty normal. There's a sink, coffee machine, stove, kettle, everything you'd expect in an office kitchen.\n> \n> //On Dr ████'s end, all rope beyond the entrance of SCP-4627 seemingly vanishes, leaving a clean cut on the end of the rope that remains.//\n> \n> D-5724: Guys, what happened to the rope? It's gone slack.\n> \n> Dr ████: It appears to have vanished on our end. Please check the direction that you came from.\n> \n> D-5724: Okay... Shit! The rope just ends at the door!\n> \n> Dr ████: Please stay calm. Follow the route that you came from.\n> \n> //D-5724 remains silent for several minutes//\n> \n> Dr ████: Checking in.\n> \n> D-5724: It's all different! The hallways have changed, there's more doors now, where do I go!\n> \n> Dr ████: Please do not panic. We will find you a way out. Remain calm.\n> \n> //D-5724 becomes unresponsive. Multiple attempts were made to contact them, to no avail. Due to the danger of the anomaly, no rescue attempts were made. As soon as the Reality Anchor was activated, the radio signal ceased, and the entrance door completely disappeared, being replaced with solid wall. Further investigation revealed that nothing was behind where the door had been previously been.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Incident-4627-33:** A civilian escaped from SCP-4627 after being \"absorbed\". They were interviewed by Dr ██████. As soon as the anomaly was brought under control, they were given amnestics and released. Interview transcript below.\n\n> //Introductions and other unimportant conversation has been removed for brevity//\n> \n> Dr ██████: Can you please describe the layout inside the anomaly?\n> \n> Civilian: It kept changing. One minute I was driving down a dead end road, suddenly there were two more roads leading off of it. When I came back to where I originally entered, it had been connected to a new road leading past a park I had never seen before.\n> \n> Dr ██████: Did you see anyone else during your time spent in the anomaly?\n> \n> Civilian: Yes, there were people. But it was weird, they looked like people I knew, but there was something off about them? Like their faces were slightly different, or they were wearing glasses, or had wider shoulders. Whatever they were, they were definitely not the same people I knew.\n> \n> Dr ██████: Did you address any of them?\n> \n> Civilian: Yeah, I tried talking to a couple of them. Some seemed just as confused as I was, while some had no idea what I was talking about.\n> \n> Dr ██████: What do you mean by \"Just as confused as you were\"?\n> \n> Civilian: They said they experienced something similar. Turned down the wrong road, and now they were in this ever-changing maze, just like me. But they were definitely people I had never seen before, and they had never seen me either.\n> \n> Dr ██████: Did any of them tell you their names? Or where they came from?\n> \n> //A list of names and locations were given. When researched, several of these names and locations did not appear to exist, and various names were found to belong to people living very far away from the existing locations mentioned. The interview was concluded here.//\n\n**Incident-4627-71:** During a minor manifestation of SCP-4627 in the ███████ Hospital ventilation system, D-9571 crawled out of one of the vents, and attacked several patients. They were quickly reacquired by the Foundation and subsequently terminated. Their body showed emaciation due to starvation and their violent state appeared to be non-anomalous.\n\nDue to the presence of Foundation insignia on their clothing, amnestics were administered to all civilians that were involved. A cover story was given presenting D-9571 as an escaped convict.\n\n**Incident-4627-105:** SCP-4627 manifested at Site-██, leading to the absorption of several important personnel and artifacts. Safety procedures have been revised, and a Scranton Reality Anchor of appropriate size must now be present at all Foundation sites holding sensitive objects or important personnel.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4626]]] | SCP-4627 | [[[SCP-4628]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
