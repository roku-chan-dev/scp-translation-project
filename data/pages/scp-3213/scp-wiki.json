Subject vocalized \"Fuck off, Carl!\" prior to SCP-3213 being removed from the area.]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3213\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3213 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell on floor 20 of Site-88. Under no circumstances is SCP-3213 to be allowed unsupervised interaction with any member of any pinniped species (pinniped families include, but are not limited to, walruses, seals, and sea lions). Testing of SCP-3213's effects is to take place in the aquatic facilities on floor 21 of Site-88.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3213 is a 44-year-old human male named Carl Prosser. When SCP-3213 is in the direct line of sight of any member of any pinniped species, the animal will become sapient and capable of vocalization. SCP-3213-affected animals will then utilize this capability to direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213. \n\nAffected animals appear to possess individual personalities and behaviors, though all share a common dislike of SCP-3213. Affected animals either do not comprehend, or do not care to respond, to any verbal requests from individuals who are not SCP-3213. Repeated interactions between SCP-3213 and affected animals has yielded no verifiable information relating to the cause of the anomaly.\n\nWhen in the presence of pinnipeds, SCP-3213 is under constant danger of physical attack. Affected animals will attempt to inflict as much physical pain as possible on SCP-3213, although multiple tests in controlled settings have revealed that these attacks will cease if SCP-3213's life is in danger. All attacking animals will continue direct verbal abuse towards SCP-3213 until removed from SCP-3213's presence.\n\nSCP-3213-affected animals do not appear to retain their sapience or ability to vocalize once out of direct line of sight of SCP-3213. Examination of live, actively affected specimens has been unsuccessful due to their aggression. SCP-3213 has, however, been cooperative in continued testing of the anomaly.\n\n> +++ Test 3:\n> \n> **Purpose:** Visual demonstration of described anomaly.\n> \n> **Date:** 10/30/17\n> \n> **Method:** SCP-3213 was given a video camera and told to enter a room with a tank housing two adult earless seals.\n> \n> **Results:** A relatively docile interaction occurred during this test. This is believed to have been an attempt to make SCP-3213 feel safe. Two separate attempts were made to physically drag SCP-3213 into the water six seconds after SCP-3213 turned his back on the seals.\n\n> +++ Test 5:\n> \n> **Purpose:** Attempts by Dr. Paul Clifford to communicate with affected animals while SCP-3213 was present.\n> \n> **Date:** 11/08/17\n> \n> **Method:** SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals. Dr. Clifford was already present.\n> \n> **Interaction Log:**\n> \n> **Seal 1:** Go fuck yourself, Carl!\n> \n> **Seal 2:** Yeah, go fuck yourself. Long and hard, you fucking bastard.\n> \n> **Dr. Clifford:** Excuse me, can you understand me?\n> \n> **Seal 2:** Carl, how's it feel to know that even though you're going bald, you'll never get any uglier?\n> \n> **Dr. Clifford:** Can you hear me?\n> \n> **Seal 1:** What's the matter, Carl? Too much of a pussy to answer us?\n\n\n> +++ Test 16:\n> \n> **Purpose:** Attempts to glean more of the reason for the anomaly's existence.\n> \n> **Date:** 1/24/18\n> \n> **Method:** SCP-3213 directed to enter a room with a tank housing two earless seals and to inquire as to the reason behind the anomalous behavior.\n> \n> **Interaction Log:**\n> \n> **Seal 1:** Should've figured you'd come back, bet you like the taste of shit.\n> \n> **SCP-3213:** What did I do to make you so mad at me?\n> \n> **Seal 2:** Oh ho! This piece of shit wants to know what he did.\n> \n> **Seal 1:** You fucking know what you did, Carl.\n> \n> **SCP-3213:** I never know what you're fucking talking about.\n> \n> **Seal 2:** You're a fucking asshole. We fucking remember 'cause we saw you do that shit, Carl.\n> \n> **Seal 1:** You got all these people fooled. You thought just 'cause it was dark and raining on the beach that night, no one was gonna see what you did?\n> \n> **SCP-3213:** Jesus fucking Christ.\n> \n> **Seal 2:** Coming back to you now, ain't it, asshole. Why don't you jump in here and I'll give you a taste of how it felt. \n> \n> **Seal 1:** Don't worry, we won't kill you. Promise.\n> \n> **SCP-3213:** Why?\n> \n> **Seal 2:** 'cause then we couldn't hurt you any more, Carl.\n\nFollowing this interaction, SCP-3213 refused to elaborate on the incident described by the affected animals. It is also unknown why all members of pinniped species are aware of this triggering incident.\n\nInvestigation into SCP-3213's past has turned up nothing matching the described details. SCP-3213 testing is currently suspended, and daily interviews are scheduled to determine what events caused this anomaly.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3212]]] |  SCP-3213 | [[[SCP-3214]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** SCP-3213_Affected_Animal.jpg\n> **Name:** Mirounga leonina.jpg\n> **Author:** [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/user:butterfly_austral Serge OuachÃ©e]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mirounga_leonina.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n\n=====\n[[div class=\"titlepreview\"]]\nF*ck Off Carl\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"coauthors\"]]\nNone\n[[/div]]\n[[module CSS]]\ndiv.titlepreview { display: none; }\ndiv.coauthors { display: none; }\n[[/module]]\n======",
