Videos containing SCP-6780 are to be taken down and stripped of the anomaly.  The channel owners are to be amnesticized.  \n\nCopies of SCP-6780 instances are to be stored at the High-Yield Data Storage Facility 1 at Site-43.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6780 is a series of videos and written advertisements produced by GOI-5889 (\"**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]**\") that represents a public relations advertising campaign for a line of supplements known as //'helth by dado'//.  The verbal and audio-visual content of SCP-6780 appears to be attempting to extol the virtues of 'helth by dado' through use of spoken and written testimonials, reenactments, and use of devices such as medical diagrams, which often do not display human anatomy.\n\n'helth by dado', [[[dado-hub | despite the apparent origin]]], is largely non-anomalous in content; examples of products in this line include coyerroodlquhhylx[[footnote]]A rebranded malaria treatment, marketed as a preventative treatment for all viral and bacterial infections.[[/footnote]] and dado brain plus[[footnote]]Consisting of 99% ginkobiloba and ginseng supplement, 1% salt.[[/footnote]].  SCP-6780 instances often portray the products causing significant mundane physical changes in the subject.\n\nIndividuals who view SCP-6780 become skeptical of testimonial endorsements concerning a product,[[footnote]]Even in person, as subjects will no longer trust product recommendations from individuals who are close to them.[[/footnote]] even products not featured in SCP-6780.  This compels subjects to research products recommended to them, ultimately showing a preference for generic products over well-known brand names.\n\nVideo instances of SCP-6780 typically involve testimonials of one kind or another, but can vary with unpredictable regularity.  Additionally, demonstrations of the product often end with undesirable results.\n\n**Discovery**: On 11/12/2021, METATRON.aic noted activity triggering several flags for Vikander-Kneed activity on numerous YouTube channels.  Review of the noted channels revealed instances of SCP-6780 edited into videos uploaded.  Upon confirmation of the GOI’s involvement, members of MTF-Kappa-43 (“The Mediators”) contacted the uploaders, who were unaware of the inclusion of the instances.[[footnote]]Despite the instances resembling ads, they were spliced into the video files themselves.  It is unclear how the GOI managed this.[[/footnote]]  The videos were taken down, the channel owners amnesticized, and the current containment procedures developed.\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 3px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; background: #E5E5E2; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n++++ Addendum 6780.1: Selected Transcripts\n//The following are several examples of SCP-6780 instances//:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Designation:** SCP-6780-04\n**Duration:** 01:29\n\n//A brunette woman sits on a wooden stool on a sound stage made to look like a plain, white room, framed so that its existence as a sound stage, as opposed to an actual room, is obvious.
