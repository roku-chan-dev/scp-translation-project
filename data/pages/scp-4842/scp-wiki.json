As SCP-4842-2 instances cease all anomalous activity after playing, it is to be removed from its location and recycled as needed.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4842-1 is a boombox which operates at maximum volume for its model without the need for a power source. The only recording that has played since its discovery and subsequent containment are field recordings of trains passing nearby the microphone. The recording lasts for 30 minutes and 29 seconds. After it finishes, the recording loops and plays again. SCP-4842-1 was discovered and initially cataloged as AO-17-051902 on 01/05/2015. It was reclassified as SCP-4842-1 following Recording-4842-Beta.[[footnote]]See Addendum 4842-B.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-4842-2 is a boombox which manifests at 40°██'██.█\"N 74°██'██.█\"W once every 177 days, thereafter playing at maximum volume without the need for a power source. Recordings played from SCP-4842-2 vary in content and length; two individuals are present on all recordings, identified as Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson. Interviews with the individuals in question have revealed that neither are aware of SCP-4842 or its associated phenomena, and that neither have visited the state of ████████, having lived on Martha's Vineyard together since April 7th, 2013.\n\n**Addendum 4842-B:** List of transcribed SCP-4842-2 recordings\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Recording 4842-Alpha (07/01/2015)\" hide=\"- Recording 4842-Alpha (July 1. 2015)\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n> **Recording 4842-Alpha:** Recording played during discovery.\n> \n> //00:00:// Low humming drone.\n> \n> //00:05:// Ambient noises of a train.\n> \n> //00:20:// Audio of Jensen Kortland starts midway through a word.

This recording deviates from previous recordings, consisting of a single sustained train horn for 4 minutes and 35 seconds. Individuals in the area were examined for possible cognitohazardous containment, and amnescitized afterwards.\n> \n> SCP-4842-1's recording during this time period differed, consisting of incomprehensible voices from Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson, with the possible sound of fire in the background. Neither Jensen Kortland and Alix Cuthbertson reported unusual activity or mood changes that day. Upon follow-up questioning the next day, their home was found abandoned. Various types of batteries and keyboards were spilled across the living room floor, along with a miniature model train, 8 grams of marijuana, and an artistic depiction of severed ears located under a bed mattress.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Recording 4842-Delta (06/08/2017)\" hide=\"- Recording 4842-Delta (06/08/2017)\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n> **Recording 4842-Delta:**\n> \n> //00:00:// Low humming drone.\n> \n> //00:08:// Ambient noises of a train.\n> \n> //00:36:// Coughing.\n> \n> **C:** I don't want to think about it.\n> \n> **K:** Okay.\n> \n> //00:45:// Silence for 10 seconds.\n> \n> **C:** I fucking hate trains.\n> \n> **K:** Huh?\n> \n> **C:** I said I hate trains!\n> \n> //00:53:// Silence for 12 seconds.\n> \n> **K:** Hun, I'm going to step outside for a little bit.\n> \n> **C:** Okay.\n> \n> **K:** Do you want anything?\n> \n> //01:11:// Eight seconds of silence, followed by the sound of a door closing, followed by 1 minute and 9 seconds of silence.\n> \n> **C:** I don't want to hear myself anymore... please stop.
