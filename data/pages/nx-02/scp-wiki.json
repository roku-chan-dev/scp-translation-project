Anomalies relating to Nx-02 have had their containment procedures reevaluated and altered to support these interaction protocols. If individual/s successfully access Nx-02, they are to be retrieved as soon as possible and subjected to an interview and amnestic and oneirological treatment.\n\nAccess and traversal into Nx-02 by Foundation personnel is to remain a high priority, to prevent an LV-Zero \"Lifted Veil\" scenario.\n\n**Containment Facility:** [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-12|Site-12]]]\n\n**Description:** Nx-02 is an island located within a partially extradimensional space, accessible from any coastline within the British Isle and Northern France. To date, the only known way of accessing Nx-02 is to apply a Newman-Hyatt Key[[footnote]] More commonly known among the anomalous community as 'Knocks'.[[/footnote]], following subjection to a specific oneirological and mnesiological [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6916 |triggers]]]. When applied, individuals are able to walk to Nx-02 via a causeway connecting its coastlines with that of the mainland. This access can be revoked and those who attempt to reach Nx-02 with revoked access will be subjected to translocation and be redirected back to the point of perpetration.\n\nAs of this documentation, it is believed that Nx-02 is not inhabited by any living denizen. However, Nx-02 is home to several spectral entities, consisting mostly of canine, cervine and avian animals. Ruins and landmarks found on Nx-02 do suggest that the island was once inhabited and had some working industry. This theory has been further corroborated by the cadavers scattered across the island. These remains include both humans[[footnote]] Whilst DNA analysis showed no genetic differentials between the human inhabitants and modern-day humans, thaumaturgical analysis suggests many of them had developed thaumaturgical capabilities.[[/footnote]] and members of the anomalous hominid subspecies //homo sapiens tumuli// and //homo sapiens sidhe//.\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n**Homo Sapiens Tumuli**: Colloquially known as Tuatha Dé Danann or Tuatha. Before 1988, they were a thriving populous, inhabiting [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-03 | Nx-03]]] and Ireland. However, since then, their numbers have dwindled significantly, with most now inhabiting the Free Ports. Physiological differences include tapered ears, longer lifespans, prominence of black and red hair pigmentation, and a moderate allergy to iron and silver.\n\n**Homo Sapiens Sidhe**: Colloquially as Fae, Gwyllion, Sidhe, Tylwyth Teg, Aos sí, or Fair Folk. Due to current and historical animosity between them and other hominid subspecies, the current population's size and habitation are unknown. However, a small demographic has been reported inhabiting Three Portlands. Physiological differences include tapered ears, gold-pigmented iris, longer lifespans, prominence of grey and white hair pigmentation, eyebrows joined with hair at temples, pointed cuticles, petal-like wings with nacre texture and gloss, and a severe allergy to iron and silver.\n\n//Due to shared physiological traits and natural affinity with thaumaturgy, homo sapiens tumuli and homo sapiens sidhe are often mistaken and misidentified for one another.//\n\n+++++ - Prof. Saifur. L. Otters (1994). Thaumic Evolution: The Secret Miracles of Modern Biology\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe majority of the botanical life on the island is non-anomalous, with the exception of the species //[[[anomaly-306-the-silver-alder|Alnus argentum]]]//. Due to their silver and iron-rich xylem, these trees give Nx-02 various thaumactive saddle points [[footnote]] A region where the flow of Akiva Radiation is obstinate and stable. Such points can impact or negate thaumaturgy and are difficult to redirect or overpower.[[/footnote]]. Ignoring this, when alive, the fibres of the trees have properties identical to that of non-anomalous trees. Although, when chopped and dried, the wood's properties alter to be similar to that of steel.\n\nThe island, and possible the space itself, appear to be under the direct control of a human entity, identifying itself as //Arawn ap Carnonos//, who claims to be the ruler of the island. The entity has demonstrated numerous thaumaturgical workings, including atmomancy, necromancy, and oneiromancy. Currently, due to differences in goals, relations between the Foundation and Arawn are strained, with the latter revoking all access to Nx-02 from Foundation personnel.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=triskelion.jpeg|caption=This symbol, known as a triskelion, was found carved into many of the ruins located on the island.]]\n\nDue to a lack of documentation, exploration, and situational miscommunication, the history of Nx-02 is mostly unknown. According to research and interviews conducted by the Global Occult Coalition and Unusual Incidents Unit, Nx-02 was, prior to the 1880s, under Fae governance. As a result of the backlash caused by the Sixth Occult War, Nx-02 underwent destabilisation, resulting in its destruction and a loss of around 14% of the Fae population. Despite the acceptance of these claims by the anomalous community, recent research and uncovered evidence suggest that the claims are historically inaccurate. Whether this negationism is a result of either inaccurate record-keeping or deliberate distortion is yet to be determined.\n\nInstead, evidence points towards Nx-02 originally being a human habitation, not a Fae one. Initially, this was only a claim made by Arawn ap Carnonos, though after assessing the discoveries made by Foundation exploration and evidence collated by the Department of History and the Department Of Mythology And Folkloristics, this claim appears to have some degree of truth. Documented evidence, however, is divided, with earlier accounts confirming its existence, whilst later ones dismiss it as either an error in geographical calculation or the creation of folklore.\n\nBefore the turn of the millennium, several Greek writers wrote of an island within the British Isles, known as the Cassiterides. These writers also included priests of the Followers of Mekhane - the historical precursor to the modern Church of the Broken God. According to their scrolls, during their downfall and assimilation into the Roman Empire, the Followers established and maintained a peaceful trade deal with the inhabitant of the island, exchanging metallurgic and scientific discoveries with ores of iron, copper and tin from the island's fruitful deposits:\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n \nThese lands are cold. Not deep like those of the Alpes but a [damp/wet] feeling. It almost always rains. The [Mabyn/sons/brothers][[footnote]] Whilst the rest of the scroll is written in Hellenistic Greek, this word is in Brythonic. This word could likely be a title or name rather than just a noun. [[/footnote]] do not appear to mind. They are used to such [damp/wet].\n\nWe did not know what to expect. [Unknown phrase, untranslated] spoke so highly of [Albion's][[footnote]] An alternative name for Great Britain [[/footnote]] metal and people yet the [faithless/athists] scholars deemed the natives simple.\n\nWe arrived at Cassiterides at [dusk/twilight]. To our surprise, we were greeted warmly by the [Mabyn/sons/brothers] leader. All eight met us at the shore, attended by their [wonder/miracle] workers, smiths and warriors, some of whom were [ghost/\"afterlife-stranded\"]. Introduced, we were taken to the fortress, a [castle/palace] of stone and iron, surrounded by paddocks of silver trees.\n\nAt night, we dined in the halls, provided with rich oils and coals to strengthen our bodies after such a journey. We spoke of enlightenment, engineering and art, and were shown the workings of the [Mabyn/sons/brothers]. Such kindness they gave us. It is good not to have to fear.\n\nDespite our efforts, these natives, the [Mabyn/sons/brothers] remain [faithless/athist] and will not join us in our plight for Mekhane. Despite this, the trade remains. Our pilgrimage may have failed once more but we shall be safe for the foreseeable future.\n\n+++++ - Scroll Found in a Followers of Mekhane Ruin (50-100 BCE)\n\n[[/div]]\n\nDuring the Roman's first and failed attempt to invade Britain, Caesar made several observations of the British Isles' geography and culture. In one of his passages, he noticed the existence of two islands located within the Irish Sea:\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\nBritain is triangular in its form, and one of its sides is opposite to Gaul. One angle of this side, which is in Kent, whither almost all ships from Gaul are directed, looks to the east; the lower looks to the south. This side extends about 500 miles. Another side lies toward Hispania and the west, on which part is Ireland, less, as is reckoned, than Britain, by one half: but the passage from it into Britain is of equal distance with that from Gaul.\n\nIn the middle of this voyage, are two islands, Mona[[footnote]] The Isle of Man [[/footnote]] and Annwvn. Mona, in the north, extends about 33 miles in size, and though may provide uses in rest and coordination, it does not show any great promise. Annwvn, however, shows greater promise. Extending about 60 miles, the island appears to be a great source of gold, tin and iron. Unfortunately, the island is also fortified, believed six, with Siddi found on the eastern bank holding up to a thousand men. It will prove to be an issue in our attempt.\n\nMany smaller islands are supposed to lie there, of which islands some have written that at the time of the winter solstice, it is night there for thirty consecutive days.\n\n+++++ - Julius Caesar (55 BCE). Commentarii de Bello Gallico\n\n[[/div]]\n\nWhilst the works Caeser had compiled were useful, a majority of their claims were confirmed to have been gained by inquiry and hearsay rather than direct experience, casting doubt on whether any of the entries were wholly accurate, including the island's existence. During the second attempt at invasion, Claudius's Roman forces could not locate the island described by Caesar's passages, further cementing the idea that the island was nothing more than a fantasy.\n\nThese divisions in passages made at the turn of the millennium, the claims made by Arawn and the dimensional nature of Nx-02 have led the Foundation to assume that at some point in the past the island known as Annwvn or Cassiterides was once a part of baseline reality before being removed and exiled into an extradimensional space to form Nx-02. Further research to support this theory is underway.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum: Recovered Documents**\n\nDuring an expedition into Nx-02 on 06/04/2000, the remains of the //Arausio//, a clipper used by Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal, was discovered. Numerous supplies and documentation were recovered from the boat, including several rubbings, sketches, and notes, created by Second Lieutenant Nathanial Logan. Below is a description of Logan's rubbings:\n\n# A tree of unidentifiable species is seen planted in a space. A flow of wind or dust is seen intertwining the tree, with the flow emanating from its branches and leaves. On the ground, several creatures, reptilian in shape, are seen feeding on the tree's roots and flow.\n# The reptilian creatures are seen attacking the tree with their bodies, lightning and fire. A serpent-like creature coils the tree, defending it and retaliating against the attackers. (//**Notes:** Further described in [[[history-of-behemoths|Extinction of Behemoths]]].//)\n# The serpent from the previous image, is seen standing before the tree. Cuts can be seen on its body but its face is serene, encompassed with the flow. The damaged roots depicted in the first image have been replaced with shelves of books, merging with the untainted tree roots.\n# Three humanoid-shaped creatures are seen standing side by side. The middle resembles a standard human. The left possesses tapered ears and petal-shaped protrusions on its back. The right is taller compared to the other two and its upper body is coated in a thick layer of hair. (//**Notes:** Men, Gwyllion, Na Liath Mòr?//)\n# The humans and hairy humanoids are seen exchanging tools and crops. In the clouds above, the petal humanoids can be seen, watching the flow, the humans and hairy humanoids.\n# A group of petal humanoids is seen cleaving the bodies of the reptilian creatures from the first image. Another group of petal humanoids is seen at the base of the tree, inspecting the flow, cutting the roots, and holding stones in their hands. The serpent is seen coiled up in the corner, suggesting a fear of their presence.\n# The humans and hairy humanoids are seen fighting each other. The petal humanoids sit in the clouds, whispering to the two beings below them and growing a small plant.\n# A female, [[[SCP-8899|human figure]]] is seen holding the plant depicted before and holding it above her. Around her, the hairy humanoids are seen screaming, flowers blooming at their feet. Humans and petal humanoid watch on from the sides.\n# The humans are depicted forging metal, petting canines, conflicting with the petal humanoids, and meeting three hooded figures, who point to the tree and the coiled serpent.\n# Several humans and petal humanoids are seen engaging in warfare. Some of the petal humanoids are seen wearing pelts in the shape of the reptilian creatures seen in the first image. The humans and several canines are seen fighting alongside each other. Some of the humans are shown with increased height.  \n# Two islands are seen surrounded by the flow. The left island is depicted with several pillars and towers. The right island is depicted with branching trees.(//**Notes:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-03 |Brasil]]] and na nÓg? [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/new |Blackwood]]] will know more.//)\n# Two groups of humans are seen standing side by side, with one group possessing tapered ears. Both parties are seen holding weapons but also exchanging parchments, suggesting diplomatic relations. Above them, in the clouds, a single petal humanoid is seen, looking down at the two.\n\nFollowing the discovery of HMFSCP's involvement and successful expedition into Nx-02, the Foundation was able to uncover further documentation in the Juniper Archive in Site-44. Many of the entries had been foxed or consisted of only a few phrases and drawings. Below are the surviving excerpts of Corporal Idris Berach's diary during his time on Nx-02:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Diary excerpts of Corporal Berach\" hide=\"▽ Diary excerpts of Corporal Berach\"]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n###0b5369|My rations finally ran out today. Given sleep is already painful, I'm not looking forward to starvation adding to my plight. I would eat the fruit here but they're all so strange. I do not wish to grow sick. As they don't appear to need to eat, it's possible what grows is not even edible.\n@@@@\nI've managed to make an appropriate outline of this land. Klaus would've made a more accurate assessment but I would guess this island is at most forty thousand acres. So little of it has been used. Most of the buildings here have faded into ruin. I am yet to find where these creatures even be taking residence. Moreover, I must find out what they are doing here. In the dreams, I saw an invasion. This land was usurped. What for?\n@@@@\nThey're worried. Something is scaring them.\n##\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n###0b5369|I was attacked. Whilst exploring a ruin three of them appeared behind me. When I asked for diplomacy, they laughed. They spoke of me like I was a child or a pet. They believed me stupid. One attempted to detain me. They whispered and had the ivy entangle me. Sorcery comes so easily to them. I only managed to escape before it encased me.\n@@@@\nTheir wings are spectacular. When aloft, they are able to move with grace and speed, unlike any bird I've seen. I ran for a whole quarter of an hour with them on my tail. They did not tire. They seem to enjoy hunting me.\n@@@@\nI was on the brink of exhaustion when I found this grove. I recognised the trees from the cuttings I saw in the ruins. I thought I could fashion a weapon from the metallic branches. To my surprise, they stopped their chase and refused to approach me. One attempted but was forced back when its skin blistered. Out of anger, I taunted them. They answered in their own language and claimed the grove gave only cover, not protection and I would only end up starving here. They left soon after, promising to return.\n@@@@\nHunger grows in me but I don't worry. I have found a weakness.\n##\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n###0b5369|The island continues to grant me blessings. I ventured out of the grove today and found in the mudflats a growth of samphire. I haven't wept over food before.\n@@@@\nI've taken to carving myself arms and armour from the tree's bark. Since the creatures find their aura deadly, it is in my best interest to utilise them as much as possible. The material is fascinating.\n@@@@\nStrangely, I haven't dreamt of this place since I got here. Back home, my sleep was plagued with images of this place. Now I am here, I dream of nothing.

Walking to the ruins on the eastern hills, I saw a ship in the distance. It was the Arausio. It was fighting the creatures, who were attacking from the heavens. A bell sounded and a storm formed, beached the Arausio. From the wreckage, I saw the creatures remove and bind the crew. One was the Brigadier. Logan and Klaus were there too. Brigadier attempted to communicate with the creatures but their leader rebuffed him and demanded they should be taken to the king.\n@@@@\nI followed the party to a ruin in the mountains.

Their king is hunting us with all his power, and returning will only grant us sanctuary for long. We've taken shelter in the mountains. We're running out of samphire. \n@@@@\nThe man is getting worse. We've examined him but we can find nothing wrong. We find nothing actually. No heartbeat. No breath. No heat. It is as if his form is neither living nor dead. \n@@@@\nHe keeps coming in and out of sleep. When awake, he speaks in an old language. Brigadier says it's a Brittonic tongue. He can't make out most of it but understands some of the phrases. He keeps mentioning hounds and the sea. When we mention the creatures, he spits and refuses to speak.\n@@@@\nIn his sleep, he begs.\n##\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n###0b5369|Sir, if you're reading this then it's started and I have done what is needed to get you off this island and a chance to fight these beasts.
