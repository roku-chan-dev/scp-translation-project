Overview:** Special Asset 4-N-SH is a Noospheric-type ontokinetic deployed by the Foundation as a combat overwatch unit and a research asset. The asset is a human female, age 27. Instructions for proper usage of Special Asset 4-N-SH are detailed in Attached Document 14.\n@@ @@\n**2. Acquisition:** Special Asset 4-N-SH was acquired following the events of Incident-G019-22.09.2011. During the incident, anomalous ontokinetic effects temporarily enclosed a portion of the town of ████, Russia (population: 15 000) in a Type-IX Noospheric Field. The portion of the town enclosed included Foundation Site-147. This caused a total communications blackout for 6 hours[[footnote]] All information leaving the Noospheric field suffered from a fundamental ideatic incompatibility with the human ideatic space and was annihilated upon leaving the field. Electronic records of communications during this six-hour period still exist in a metastable state, but any attempt to access these records causes the information to destabilize and annihilate. [[/footnote]], during which members of GoI-019 \"The Serpent's Hand\" entered Site-147 and removed SCP-███ from containment. It is believed that the members of GoI-019 were anomalously shielded against the field, or otherwise excluded from its effects. 1 hour 13 minutes after the theft was completed, the Noospheric field dissipated, allowing scrambled MTF teams to apprehend the source. \n@@ @@\nLarge-scale use of amnestics was authorized by O5-8, following damage assessment by MTF Zeta-11 (\"Dreamers Awake\"). An estimated 63.6% of the town's population required amnesticization. An estimated 15.1% of the town's population required memory-rewrite procedures in order to reduce post-amnesticization PTSD response. An estimated 1.9% of the town's population was terminated due to unrecoverable mental/ideatic injury caused by excision from and subsequent reentry into conventional ideatic space. The remainder of the town's population did not require special amnestic intervention.\n@@ @@\nThe cause of the Noospheric field was determined to be a natural Type-IV (\"Noospheric/Ideatic\") ontokinetic, human.\n@@ @@\nFollowing detainment by MTF Zeta-11, the subject was interviewed.
