These actions are to be disrupted by Foundation agents.\n\nThe original manuscript from which SCP-PL-380 originated currently resides in the possesion of the Interdimensional Paraphonetics Association (IdPA)[[footnote]]Or GoI-8781, a scientific organisation focused on research of linguistic anomalies, anomalous means of communication or anomalous cultures, etc. It was founded as a division of the International Phonetic Association (IPA) in 1902 and over the time became a separate organisation.[[/footnote]] in the archives of the group's museum in Three Portlands and is available for research as needed by the Foundation.\n\n##black|**Description:**## SCP-PL-380 is an anomalous variant of the Cyrillic letter O called \"multiocular O\" and represented by the character ꙮ. SCP-PL-380 has only been used once in historical writing, replacing the usual version of O in the phrase \"серафими многоꙮчитїи\"[[footnote]]From Old Church Slavonic, meaning \"many-eyed seraphim\".[[/footnote]] in a 15th century copy of the Book of Psalms. \n\nThe object was first documented by a well-known Belarusian linguist, Yefim Fyodorovich Karsky, in 1928. It is unknown whether Karsky was somehow related to the anomalous world, although this possibility is mostly discarded by researchers.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-pl-380/beafraid.jpg|caption=SCP-PL-380 in the original manuscript.|width=400px|align=center]]\n\nSCP-PL-380 almost exclusively affects individuals with a background in linguistics, mainly phonetics or phonology, through an observational cognitohazard. Such individuals, while constantly observing a written SCP-PL-380 character, will claim that it represents an \"over-open extrafront vowel\", despite the fact that such a term makes no sense within the framework of accepted linguistic conventions. Subjects under the influence of SCP-PL-380 will often try to make the sound described by them to no avail; frustration usually follows due to repeated failures.\n\nThis effect partially fades when the individual looks away from SCP-PL-380. After the manifestation of the effects is over, individuals will continue to have knowledge on the exact manner by which to make the alleged sound of SCP-PL-380, however they will not be further affected by the anomalous compulsion.\n\nFrom interviews conducted with affected individuals it was determined that in order to properly pronounce the sound represented by SCP-PL-380, a human subject would need to undergo a series of highly invasive body alterations, especially of the larynx, tongue, vocal chords, teeth and cranial bones. These procedures always result in inevitable breathing difficulties and end with suffocation.[[footnote]]The Ethics Committee explicitly prohibited further testing.[[/footnote]]\n\nIt is currently unknown whether a correct vocalization of the sound bears any anomalous effect.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= ##black|**INCIDENT LOG**##\n\n-----\n\n##black|**Date:**## 01.08.2022\n##black|**Location:**## Tromsø, Troms og Finnmark, Norway\n**[[[anomaly-classification-system-guide|Disruption Class:]]]** Keneq [[span style=\"text-shadow: 0 0 2px black\"]]##yellow|●##[[/span]]\n\n-----\n\n##black|**Undertaken Actions:**##\n* Providing Amnestics and witness observation\n* Recovery of all recordings of the incident\n* Distribution of a cover story\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-pl-380/downabitfromtromso.jpg|caption=Tromsø]]\n\n##black|**Incident Summary:**## On August 1st 2022 at night in the city of Tromsø, Norway,  a concert of the little known Finnish metal band \"Lentokenttä\" took place, attended by roughly three hundred people. The event, due to the surrounding circumstances, was observed by a team of four Foundation agents from the Scandinavian Regional Branch.\n\nThe band advertised the concert with many symbols based on and similar to SCP-PL-380, and one of the new songs written especially for the event was titled \"Multiocular\", which gained the Foundation's interest. Investigation revealed that members of \"Lentokenttä\" had no previous connections to the anomalous world.\n\nThe concert lasted around an hour and a half without any visible anomalous activity, however, after the repertoire ended, the lead vocalist announced that the band had prepared a surprise for the audience at the end of the event. Immediately after the announcement, a scream of more than 150 decibels came from the vocalist's mouth, the sound of which spread an unusually strong cognitohazard throughout the surrounding area. Sound analysis conducted by the Department of Miscommunications was inconclusive.\n\nAll audience members immediately lost consciousness for the next half an hour. Recordings recovered from some people's phones showed that at the time the entire stage was covered by a beam of white light of unusually high intensity, accompanied by strong wind. Light and wind were gone after a few seconds, and the members of \"Lentokenttä\" disappeared from the stage; their current whereabouts are unknown.\n\n-----\n\n##black|**Notes:**## After a week of observing witnesses of the incident it was noted that all religious individuals that attended the concert had undertaken apostasy.[[footnote]]All four Foundation agents requested immediate transfer to the Department of Tactical Theology.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"margin-top: -1.5em\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-PL-379]]] | SCP-PL-380 | [[[SCP-PL-381]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=BlazingPie, translated by KubKac\n]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** benotafraid.png\n> **Name:** U+A66E multiocular O (10 eyes)\n> **Author:** Unknown Author (Original), Incnis Mrsi (Vectorization)\n> **License:** CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://web.archive.org/web/20240128100415/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U%2BA66E_multiocular_O_%2810_eyes%29.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Additional Notes:** Edited, devectorized.\n\n> **Filename:** beafraid.jpg\n> **Name:** Cyrillic multiocular o in Psalter, 1429\n> **Author:** Anonymous\n> **License:** Public Domain (United States)\n> **Source Link:** [https://web.archive.org/web/20230120201657/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cyrillic_multiocular_o_in_Psalter,_1429.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** downabitfromtromso.jpg\n> **Name:** Tromsø sentrum (5835702754)\n> **Author:** The Municipality of Tromsø\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://web.archive.org/web/20240128100805/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Troms%C3%B8_sentrum_%285835702754%29.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
