I aim to add on more as I write them. Enjoy, and try not to take them too seriously.\n\nHappy holidays!\n\n> +++ Table of Contents:\n> **Festive Cheer #1**: The Mann Who Stole Christmas: A Children's Story\n> **Festive Cheer #2**: 12 Days of SCP\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Festive Cheer #1]]\n\n+ The Mann Who Stole Christmas: A Children's Story\n\nAll hail Christmas Eve, the most wondrous of times,\nFull of roasts and of toasts and the most festive of rhymes.\nWith some fresh eggnog and toddy,\nAnd cocoa for mommy,\nA Christmas like this is not shoddy.\n\n//But one Christmas Day almost didn’t come clear\nWhen a Mann of great horrors came to spread fear.\nA scalpel and grin,\nAnd a swig of some gin,\nWas all that was known of this demon of sin.//\n\nWho knew where he’d strike, that merciless fiend,\nfor naught but fair Chance could help intervene.\nThe good ole Foundation,\nwith much radiation,\nDid try but found only frustration.\n\n//So who was to save Christmas, that season of wonder,\nSince those who had tried were all torn asunder?\nThe famed GoC?\nOr maybe MC&D?\nThe world held its breath at who it could be.//\n\nThen the deadliest Moose with their antlers of flame\ncame charging on in to change up Doc Mann’s game.\nWith a neigh and a kick,\nRight into Mann’s dick,\nMoose brought down the surgeon right quick.\n\n//And so Christmas was saved, with a kick to the nuts.\nThe peasants so happy leapt out of their huts.\nThey crowned the sweet Moose,\nwith freshly whipped mousse,\nand feasted like kings on great goose.//\n\nSo all hail the great Moose, lest you find their quick ire,\nfor if they’re not praised, you’ll die in a fire.\nOr maybe by crushing,\nperhaps even flushing,\nbut it’s best to just leave them a-blushing.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Festive Cheer #2]]\n\n+ 12 Days of SCP\n\n> On the first day of Christmas the O5 gave to me…\n\n     Another round of keter duty.\n\n> On the second day of Christmas the O5 gave to me…\n\n    Two [[[scp-198 | cups of Joe]]] and another round of keter duty.\n\n> On the third day of Christmas the O5 gave to me…\n\n    Three new class-D’s, two [[[scp-198 | cups of Joe]]], and another round of keter duty.\n\n> On the fourth day of Christmas the O5 gave to me…\n\n    Four lazy guards, three new class-d’s, two [[[scp-198 | cups of Joe]]], and another round of keter duty.\n\n> On the fifth day of Christmas the O5 gave to me…\n\n    Five MTFs!!!!!!
