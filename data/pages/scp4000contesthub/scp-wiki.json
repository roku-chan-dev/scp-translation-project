competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests (and possibly further disciplinary action).\n * Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to:\n  * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted\n  * Spamming people with PMs about your work\n  * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's\n * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to ask a Community Outreach Member.\n* One entry per user\n* Collaborations are allowed, but that will count as the one entry for all participants\n* Pre-existing drafts are allowed, so long as they have never been posted to the wiki\n* History will be interpreted very broadly. Dinosaurs are just as historical as the Civil War is, for our purposes. Hell, if you can swing Site History, even that'll count. So long as you can explain how your work relates to history as a concept, in any interpretation, it'll be accepted. The theme is here to inspire, not constrain. If you're not sure if it'll count, feel free to ask.\n* Edits to works **are** allowed.\n* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.\n* The prize, obviously, is the SCP-4000 slot. Runners up get to choose other Series V slots in order of place.\n\n+++ Contest Minions- Bother these people\n* [[*user ProcyonLotor]]\n* [[*user AbsentmindedNihilist]]\n* [[*user ChaoSera]]\n* [[*user Sly161]]\n\n+ Good luck, and here's to another 10 fantastic years!\n-----\n^^Many thanks to [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/zhange-artwork Zhange] for the lovely banner!^^",
