  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-3145\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is to be kept in a locked container at all times. The enclosure must be cleaned biweekly. Personnel are to enter SCP-3145's container in groups of no less than 3, with the door locked behind them. Two personnel must maintain continual direct eye contact with SCP-3145 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container. Personnel are to alert one another before blinking.\n\nAny change in sounds originating from SCP-3145's containment chamber should be reported to the HCML supervisor on duty.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3145 is a sculpture constructed from concrete and rebar, with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. Its origin is unknown.\n\nSCP-3145 is animate, but cannot move while in direct line of sight of a human being. When a human breaks eye contact with SCP-3145, it will move at high speed and attack the individual, typically by snapping the neck at the base of the skull. Strangulation has also been employed.\n\nWhen SCP-3145 is not under observation, personnel have reported sounds of scraping stone within its chamber. A reddish substance, a combination of human feces and blood, has also been observed on the floor of SCP-3145's chamber. Though SCP-3145 is believed to be the origin of this material, the actual source of SCP-3145's means of producing it are currently unknown.\n\n**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon\n> \n> **Foreword:** A change in the sounds coming from SCP-3145's chamber was reported on 04/09/94 to Dr. Falzon, HCML supervisor on duty. Investigation led to SCP-3145 requesting an interview. A screened porthole was installed in the chamber door to facilitate communication.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 09:50>**\n> \n> **Falzon:** How are you finding your accommodations, SCP-3145?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Not bad, not bad. You know, I really appreciate you guys cleaning up after me. Honestly, I don't even know where that stuff comes from.\n> \n> **Falzon:** It's the least we can do. Is there anything I can get you?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Well, uh. //[laughs]// Maybe train your D-Class a little better? I mean, not //too// good, I don't want to kill them //all//. But they've been screwing up pretty bad lately, and I like a little challenge.\n> \n> **Falzon:** I see. I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything else.\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Hey, don't judge. Being an unstoppable, well, //mostly// unstoppable, killing machine is fun!\n> \n> **Falzon:** Fair enough. Is there anything else I can do for you?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** No, I think I'm good. Thanks for the screen, though. Nice to get some fresh air in here for once. //[laughs]//\n> \n> **<End Log, 10:01>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Request to leave porthole open when SCP-3145 not under observation denied. Investigation of the origins of both the materials found in SCP-3145's chamber and its ability to vocalize are ongoing.",
