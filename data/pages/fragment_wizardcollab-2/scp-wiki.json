The tale of the beast is one of archaic terror; it was a ghastly, unsightly monster than ruled over the lands like a wicked crimson king. It changed and warped all that it could to suit its mind, creating a grotesque landscape of horror that only a mind such as the beast's could conjure.\n\nThe kingdoms trembled in fear, cowering to avoid the wrath of the beast, but most were slain in its violent rage. Families were torn apart, villages were ravaged, and the creatures that shared the world with the wretched beast were eradicated within the blink of an eye.\n\nThe kings of the earth congregated to solve their dire problem, and so came the Red Eye. The Red Eye was one who saw the tragedies that the wretched beast created, weeping dearly for those lost in the blaze and the wreckage. It sought to best the beast, bringing peace and what once was.\n\nThe Red Eye began to work upon its mighty powers, sifting through its many millions of spells to concoct solutions. As it gathered its hexes, it began its attack upon the wretched beast; it did everything within its power to power over the vile creature that had thwarted peace and tranquility. The Red Eye fired spell after spell against the treacherous villain that stood before it, refusing to yield for even one solitary moment in time. It would stop at nothing to defeat it.\n\nWithin what seemed like eons, the wretched beast was swiftly defeated. It took might and power, a battle that was fought long and hard, but The Red Eye prevailed, coming out as the victor and the saviour of the land. It needed no gratitude or acknowledgement, for it was simply doing what it was tasked to do. It had performed this with perfection, restoring balance and order to the world.\n\nIt begged. It weeped. The poor thing was ground into a pulp. And so was the group it came from. They were wiped off the face of the earth. The story doesn't want, no, it doesn't //need// them.\n\nThe Red Eye saw other issues. It saw irregularities and problems plaguing the world, the horrible things that live alongside the wretched beasts, living on the same level as the beast. It knew that these things must be fixed, just as the wretched beast was. If the beast was to be thwarted, the others were as well, as well as anything noxious or foul in the world.\n\nThe Red Eye will end the age of the beasts.\n\nThe Red Eye will fix them all.\n\nThe Red Eye will keep everyone safe.\n----\n\n**Addendum:** The above information is most likely incorrect, as various files within the Foundation database directly contradict it. Despite the contradictions, the number of Keter and Apollyon class anomalies within the database has decreased significantly. Efforts to prevent a 𐤌K ('Narrative Restructuring') scenario are in progress.\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Personnel:** Senior Researcher Octavia Cleary, Junior Researcher Quentin Holt, Researcher Regina Kennedy, Researcher Javier Reyes, Junior Researcher Harold Scott, Researcher Dallas Taylor-Walsh\n----\n**ocleary7891:** What did I say about a para-anti-fucking whatever virus?

The file's icon resembles a priest standing atop a pillar in an empty room. When SCP-6289 is placed within any folder, the folder itself and all files within become password protected. Attempts to bypass the password prompt have proven unsuccessful through all known means, including brute force trials, reverse engineering, and any form of software manipulation.\n\nSCP-6289 demonstrates limited knowledge of its surrounding environment but is capable of textual communication through anomalously altered interfaces such as text editors.\n\nIf an incorrect password is entered, SCP-6289 initiates a series of anomalous effects within the user's computer or to the user themselves. The exact nature of these effects vary, but can include increased GPU usage, corruption of hardware, replacement of files with SCP-6289 doing various activities, manifestation of spiders, and what is colloquially known as \"Skeletal inversion\".\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**qholt6862:** holy shit\n@@ @@\n**ocleary7891:** How did we NOT use this?\n@@ @@\n**rkennedy0121:** File is typically top-secret, makes sense anyways.\n@@ @@\n**rkennedy0121:** Bad news is, he's uh, very... hard to work with.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**SCP-6289:** YES.
