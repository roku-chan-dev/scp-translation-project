SCP-3261-2 instances are only to be removed from the locker for testing purposes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3261-1 is a 17-stringed koto made from //Paulownia tomentosa// wood measuring 182 centimeters in length. The ryūgaku is decorated with a floral pattern, while the ryūzetsu depicts a small village and is engraved with the kanji \"樺岡[[footnote]]Translates to \"birch tree hill.\"[[/footnote]]\". SCP-3261-2 is the collective designation for 12 pieces of sheet music for koto written in Yamada school notation.\n\nWhen an instance of SCP-3261-2 is viewed, the viewer will begin to search for SCP-3261-1. The degree of this compulsion varies depending on the instance viewed.  Copies of SCP-3261-2 do not preserve this anomalous effect.\n\nWhen the viewer finds SCP-3261-1, they will begin to use it to play the SCP-3261-2 instance viewed. The SCP-3261-2 instance will be played within an error margin of 0.7%. If play is interrupted, the player will become distressed and attempt to resume by any means possible.\n\nThe player and all listeners will begin to perceive a scene dependent on the instance of SCP-3261-2 selected. The player and listeners can interact with people and objects within this scene, collectively designated as SCP-3261-3, although these objects are not visible to non-listeners. When SCP-3261-2 ends, the player and listeners will become unconscious for approximately 15 minutes. Selected SCP-3261-2 instances are listed below:\n\n|| Instance || Title || Scene || Notes ||\n|| SCP-3261-2a || 村人の子守唄 (Villager's Lullaby) || A small village with late Meiji era architecture at dusk. At the beginning of the third line, a man exits a house carrying a wooden bucket. The man collects water from a well in the center of the village. During the seventh line, he re-enters the house. || Thought to be the village depicted on the ryūzetsu of SCP-3261-1. Lyrics are similar to a typical lullaby. ||\n|| SCP-3261-2c || 小瑠璃 (Siberian Blue Robins) || Two young boys watching a pair of Siberian blue robins in a cherry tree. The robins' vocalizations align with the rhythm of the song. || Song consists of three stanzas, each of which is a tanka. Lyrics describe the robins in a manner typical of Japanese poetry. ||\n|| SCP-3261-2d || 君が代 (Kimigayo) || The coronation ceremony of Emperor Meiji. No deviations from the original event have been observed. || Song was composed in 1880 and became the national anthem in 1888, although Meiji was coronated in 1868. ||\n|| SCP-3261-2g || Unknown || A village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a at noon. SCP-3261-3g1, a man in 1970s clothing, can be seen frantically searching for an unknown object. || No lyrics. See notes on SCP-3261-2a. Page is partially illegible due to water damage. SCP-3261-3g1 is thought to be searching for SCP-3261-1. ||\n|| SCP-3261-2j || 私の親愛なる小春専用 (Dedicated to My Dear Koharu) || A young couple walking through a village identical to that appearing in SCP-3261-2a in the morning. || Lyrics are typical of modern love songs, although analysis of the paper and ink has determined it was composed in the early 1910s. SCP-3261-2j is the longest known instance of SCP-3261-2. ||\n\n**Addendum 3261-01:** SCP-3261-3j9, a man standing near the well in SCP-3261-2j, was interviewed by Researcher Hidekazu ███████. A transcript of the interview is attached below.\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3261-3j9 Interview Log\" hide=\"SCP-3261-3j9 Interview Log\"]]\n> **Interviewer:** Researcher Hidekazu ███████\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3261-3j9\n> //Note: Researcher ███████ is a native speaker of Japanese. This interview was translated into English.//\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** Good morning.\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** Good morning. What's your name?\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** My name's Hidekazu. And yours?\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** Keinosuke. It's nice to meet you, Hidekazu.\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** It's nice to meet you too, Keinosuke. What's the date?\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** January 15th.\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** Do you have the year by any chance?\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** Meiji 44. How could you have lost track?\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** I guess the New Year just confuses me a bit.\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** Me too. I couldn't tell you how many times I've accidentally written 43.\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** Well, Keinosuke, where are you from?\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** Kabaoka.[[footnote]]This corresponds to one possible reading of the text \"樺岡.\" In reality, Kabaoka is the name of a station on the former Tenpoku line.[[/footnote]] It's a nice place.\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** I've never heard of it.\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** You haven't? There's no better village in Karafuto![[footnote]]Karafuto Prefecture, also known as South Sakhalin, was a prefecture of Japan from 1907 to 1945.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** I've been to every corner of Karafuto, and I've never once heard of Kabaoka.\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** That's strange, you must have simply forgotten.\n> \n> **Researcher ███████:** It seems I did. Well, I think we're done here. Thank you for your information, Keinosuke.\n> \n> **SCP-3261-3j9:** You're welcome, Hidekazu. I hope to see you again soon.\n> \n> <End Log>\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 3261-02:** A journal (now designated SCP-3261-3g9) was recovered from SCP-3261-2g, thought to belong to SCP-3261-3g1. An excerpt from the journal is attached below.\n[[collapsible show=\"Document 3261-1\" hide=\"Document 3261-1\"]]\n> Well, I guess I'm a citizen of Kabaoka. I don't know shit about Japanese, but I figure that's the name of this place. There's really nothing interesting here. If I could choose anywhere to go, this would be at the very bottom of my list. In fact, I wouldn't even have ended up here if I had just stopped playing that damn koto, then and there. It was just laying there at that curios shop, with a few pieces of paper I couldn't even read. I bought it, played a song, and boom, I'm in some village. The first few times I played it, everything went fine, I got out. But no, this time I had to get stuck here. How did this even happen?\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3260]]] |  SCP-3261 | [[[SCP-3262]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
