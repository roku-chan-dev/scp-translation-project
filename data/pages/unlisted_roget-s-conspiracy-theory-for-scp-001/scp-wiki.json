Two copies exist, one is located within a secured headquarters and the location of the other is known to the Overseers. \"Red Right Hand” has successfully seized all documentation of Incident-001-Γ which are not currently available to any public. Current theory is that as a result of SCP-001's effect, there exists no possibility for any trespassing within SCP-001's continuity via distortion of [[[scp-3780| time]]] and/or dimensional space.\n\nQuality of life health insurance plans and any extraordinary medical expenses [[footnote]]Along with any other resources necessary to maintain a ‘stable’ lifestyle[[/footnote]] are to be provided to the witnesses of Incident-001-Γ. \n\nMassive publicizing and public re-affirmation of established perspectives on Incident-001-Γ are to be disseminated through both reputable and alternative news sources in order to blunt the spread of uncontrolled manufactured information. Marketing and production front companies are to fund independent media outlets creating, distributing, and selling advertising space on media catering to narrow niches of alternative perspectives which are rooted to or branched off of an Incident-001-Γ perspective variant.\n----\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]]**{{Description}}**[[/size]] \n[[/=]]\n----\nSCP-001 is the projectile which killed U.S. President John F. Kennedy, fired by an unidentifiable number of assailants acting simultaneously as part of one or more conspiracies. Upon impact, human perception began falling out of sync with objective reality at an individual level.\n\nThe events surrounding SCP-001's trajectory are designated as Incident-001-Γ.\n\nAlthough the divergent standards of objectivity are largely compatible enough to allow for human society to function, that does not mean they are not a threat to the long-term viability of human civilization and intelligent life as a whole. It is possible that the current formation of reality exists as a result of a [[[keter-duty| VK-Class reality restructuring scenario.]]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Blackdogman.PNG|\n    caption=Possible documentation of lone individual present during Incident-001-Γ.|\n    width=600\n]]\n\nIndividuals with living memory of Incident-001-Γ are the last population of humanity able to agree on any shared concept of truth, their shared experience in seeing or hearing about Incident-001-Γ. The percentage of still-living eyewitnesses negatively correlates to the density of unnatural potential energy manifesting in the observable universe as anomalous phenomenon.\n\nTheir collective memory provides a consistent base of widely, but not universally, held truths. This in turn stabilizes the increasingly individualized SCP-001 perspectives, as it is the last living shared \ncertain truth among Earth's population. \n\nWitnesses who do not otherwise provide valued testimony and who have robust physiques may volunteer for experimental and indefinite life-extending experiments, in order to preserve the stabilizing effect their memory provides for as long as the human body can allow.\n\nA statistically significant minority of witness testimony report variations on so-called \"Badge Man\"  even taking into account inflation caused by civilians seeing unfamiliar Secret Service and other security forces. The only conclusively proven participants in Incident-001-Γ are John Kennedy and Lee Oswald, although they did not have any prior contact. Other individuals have been named or described often enough to be viewed as persons of interest.\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; width: auto; padding: 10px 30px; margin: 20px auto; background: url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Oldpapertexture01.jpg/1024px-Oldpapertexture01.jpg) repeat; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.25)\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ {{On New-Fashioned Bilateral Universality}}\n[[size 69%]]Collected testimony and evidence for Incident-001-Γ and SCP-001[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n,,//Written By//,,\n\n## ##black|Truth & Facts Committee##\n\n= ,,//In Association With//,,\n\n##black|Historical Relevance Committee, Anti-Revisionist Task Force##\n[[/=]]\n**Preamble:** As the increased veiling segmentation of the sheep has produced a confusing number of potential perspectives for personnel to be prepared for, a conclusive report on the development of more branching worldviews and how they may conflict with each other in order to properly prevent badsight is the accurate and correct way to maintain veiltruth. Interpersonal arguments are not considered to be infringing on the sanctity of veiltruth at this time as collated through this documentation.\n[[=]]\n+ S. I - Summary of Events & Suspects\n[[/=]]\n\nOn 11/22/1963, at 12:30 p.m, Lee Oswald fired two bullets from the sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository. Oswald's first shot missed, striking a concrete curb. The second shot mortally wounded the President and injured the Governor. A third shot (SCP-001) lethally vaporized U.S. President Kennedy's cranial cavity.\n\nFor the approximate decade between Incident-001-Γ and the ascension of President Gerald Ford, SCP-001's effect was widespread but largely benign. The disparity between perception and reality was growing, but gradually and in a linear fashion. The fractalization did not begin to occur until the failed attempt to assassinate President Ford on September 5, 1975 by Lynn \"Squeaky\" Fromme. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=ford|\n    caption=38th U.S. President Gerald Ford exactly 11 years and 10 months after Incident-001-Γ.|\n    width=600\n]]\n\nIn both crowds, all witnesses reported seeing differing versions of the events, most of which did not have President Ford surviving. Two weeks later, Sara Jane Moore made a subsequent attempt on Ford's life in order to reconcile her knowledge of his death with his visible living person. The exponential spread of SCP-001's effect can be demonstrated by Gerald Ford's sincere belief from at least 1976 until his death that the Soviet Union had withdrawn from eastern Europe during the Nixon administration.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Badgeman.jpg|\n    caption=Alleged photograph documenting the 'Badge Man'.|\n    width=300\n]]\n\nHistorical documents reflecting the official story are to suggest that it was the scandal which caused the proliferation of distorted information throughout society, and not the survival of President Ford.\n\nAny scenario, whether there exists witness testimony or not, could be true given the ephemeral nature of truth and falsehood on a conceptual level.\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ {{Suspect & Witness Testimony}}\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n> [[collapsible show=\"Police Log - Babushka Lady\" hide=\"__Babushka Lady__\"]]\n> **Foreword:** //The so-called \"Babushka lady\" was briefly held in custody by the Dallas Police, giving a brief statement before she was released. There is no record as to when or why she was released from custody.//\n> \n> **BL:** Yeah, I saw old man Zapruder with that 'camera', right? Pretty good view from that pillar, especially since the TV crew wasn't there to hog the space. I'm sure a few frames with extra white puffs will just happen to go missing, right? \n> \n> (//Pause. Lighter flicking.//)\n> \n> My grandmother loved to play the games she could win. Her favorite was //Find the Lady//. All you need is a ball, three cups, and a rube to play. There was never a shortage of eager and willing rubes.\n> \n> Grammy relished in showing off every cup as slow as she could, then covering the ball and going to work once she had their trust. Rube watching, she'd shuffle and move 'em all around fast as tilt-a-whirls. Rube, with luck, picks the right cup. Oh, the sweet talk she'd use to string them along, come on, double down, let's play one more time, just for the laughs. Poor saps get convinced they've sliced the gambling knot. Everyone was ready to think they were special. \n>\n> We both had a sixth sense for knowing when rubes were getting ready to cash out. By then, they're not even the same person they were when the game started, not after they've been on a hot streak long enough that the money's as good as half-spent to them.\n> \n> Zapruder is being played as a shell game. That's the point. If you've seen any home movies-- the shaky blurs, the way the timing always seems just a little 'off'? That's by design. The unreality on the surface conceals that if you look at it hard enough, you'll find the fatal flaw. You'll find where the Lady is hiding.

I didn't have any of them on me, I only brought this particular umbrella because it is my only black one.

But now you, and I, and everything, it's split up in little black boxes, I'm not paranoid. The walls have closed in and now we're standing straight up in the dark. I was there when it happened.//\n> \n> //My first thanksgiving after, everybody on my Mom's side of the family was convinced that I had been convicted of the President's murder. Then, I started to remember it too. I could hear Lyndon's boasting that we would have the greatest administration of all time, and we'd lick the Soviets too. Maybe it did happen that way, I haven't convinced myself enough to be sure. So... I know I squeezed a trigger but I can't remember whose hand it was I was squeezing, if that makes sense.//\n> \n> //I don't like going out anymore, people all know. Some of them know.

The belief that one is skilled, but unable to get a job, or that they are wonderful people yet nobody seems to like them. Unable to understand that they are being paid less than they think they are. Feeling cramped and confined even if they see themselves living in a big house all to themselves.\n\nWrongness is there, it can be felt, but it cannot be explained. It manifests in psychological disorders such as Imposter Syndrome. At a certain level, they know that they don't belong. One more way to feel the lonesomeness of SCP-001.\n\nThose with less self-awareness may be promoted via the Dilbert Principle, that incompetent individuals will be promoted until they can no longer do damage. This is a natural organizational self-defense measure as the structure is aware something is wrong, even if none of the participants themselves are able to.\n\nThe so-called \"Mandela Effect\" arises when the degree to which any given person is out of sync with reality drifts further in their living memory, so that what was true to them once is no longer so. However, this is easily rationalized and is not considered to be damaging except in rare cases.\n\nAnalysis of social movements derived from SCP-001 was at first limited to immediate interpretation of the Kennedy Assassination, but following disruption of the assassination attempt on Gerald Ford and the subsequent lack of new renewals of blood, the fracturing of collective truth has continued on its path to disintegration.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=rifle|\n    caption=Mannlicher–Carcano allegedly owned and used by Lee Oswald\n]]\n\nWhen a critical mass of knowledge an individual is able to interpret as factual have no connection to reality as defined by physical laws and natural forces, it will frequently cause them to disconnect most of their familial and social relationships. This withdrawal is usually a result of frustration and confusion. They may begin to make new social connections in small networks of those who find that their alternative viewpoints overlap on at least some measures.\n\nEven in these extreme cases, this does not prevent those with heavily altered viewpoints from carrying out the functions which have become routine. This is more a result of muscle memory, as their will to engage with the wider world is totally broken by their SCP-001 experience.\n\n\n----\n[[=]]\n+ {{Conclusions:}}\n[[/=]]\n\n\nThere is no purpose on speculating who killed President Kennedy. Every guess is correct to someone.\n\nNobody can see the world the same way as anyone else. That's just the way it is.\n\nNormalcy is a comfort to those confused by SCP-001, and should be provided whenever possible.\n\nWe Secure, Contain, and Protect.\n\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[html]]\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n@import url(http://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--50456838fc8c/common--theme/base/css/style.css);\n@import url(http://d3g0gp89917ko0.cloudfront.net/v--50456838fc8c/common--theme/shiny/css/style.css);\n@import url(http://05command.wdfiles.com/local--theme/scp-custom-2/style.css);\n</style>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nfunction showHide(e)\n{\n    var el = document.getElementById(e);\n    if (el.style.display == \"block\") {\n     el.style.display = \"none\";\n    } else {\n     el.style.display = \"block\";\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n<div id=\"firstCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('firstText');\">°×××°×××_°××°°°°×_°×××°°×°_°××°×××°</a></div>\n<div id=\"firstText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>Case N°:** 137718042 John Fitzgerald Kennedy Autopsy Report</u></b>\n<b><u>MALE | 46 | WHITE</u></b>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>External Examination: Skin and hair of the President were rigid.

There is one thing that can make everyone feel that hate, that blind rage, every single one of them stemming from this snapped continuum point. I go deeper. Even the small hole's beams of light went away. Each one projected every possible terrible future in a twisted dystopian kaleidoscopic light show.<br />\n <br />\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"sixthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('sixthText');\">You're complicit now</a></div>\n    <div id=\"sixthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div style=\"border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;\">\n<h1>It thinks only to Secure itself, leaving us to show them the way through the valley of mines with our blood.</h1>\n<br />\n<h2>It Contains the aspirations of mortals everywhere to be greater than just human resources</h2>\n<br />\n<h3>It Protects itself at the expense of all else, all that matters is continued survival and preserving the status quo.</h3>\n<br>\n<br>Normalcy is the Conspiracy's founding lie.\n<br />\n<br>\n[[/html]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Anonymous]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Blackdogman.PNG\n> **Author(s):** Mary Moorman (Mary Krahmer)\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blackdogman.PNG|Wikimedia]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Badgeman.jpg\n> **Author:** Mary Moorman\n> **License:** Public Domain \n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Badgeman.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n> **Filename:** smiles\n> **Name:** John F.
