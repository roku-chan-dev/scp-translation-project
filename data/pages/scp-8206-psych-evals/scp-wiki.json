His primary complaint is, \"I don't know what I'm doing wrong.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. and Mrs. Lazzeri, Dante has been routinely disobedient and withdrawn over the last eight months. Difficulty eating and sleeping, as well as episodes of dissociation, are reported.\n[[/div]]\n _\n\n##444|Good morning, Dante.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Hi.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|My name is Dr. Lantry, but you can just call me Joan if you'd like.##\n\n##444|I just want to talk with you for a few minutes, if that's alright.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Okay.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|I read what you told Mr. Yafai.##\n\n##444|That you feel like you're doing something wrong.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Yeah.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Could you... elaborate a little bit on that for me, please?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Are you mad at me?##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Who?

It sounds like he didn't\ngive you very clear instructions.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|But I don't like asking too many questions,\ncause he gets annoyed.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Has he told you that your questions annoy him?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Yeah. Well, he... I can tell.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|How so?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Because he looks at me like he's mad.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|I also read that you've been having difficulty sleeping.##\n##444|Would you be able to tell me a little bit about that?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Mommy and daddy fall asleep easy.\nbut it takes forever for me.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Any idea why?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|I don't really feel tired.\nOr, tired like I need to sleep.\nI'm tired when I get home from school,\nbut then I lay down and I just start thinking.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|What do you think about?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|I don't know. A lot of stuff.\nI don't really remember.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Alright. So you just can't get relaxed?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Yeah. Or sometimes I do,\nbut then I hear something outside,\nand I can't focus on anything else.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Could you give me an example?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|People yelling. Wolves howling.\nWhen it rains it's okay.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|You like the rain?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|When I'm laying down.\nI don't like when it's too quiet,\ncause then I just know that\nsomething's gonna ruin it.##\n[[/>]]\n\n[[>]]\n##777|But Mommy doesn't let me outside\nto play when it's raining.\nShe says I'll get sick.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Well, I think your mommy has it right, there.\nNot good to get caught out in the rain.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Am I a real boy?##\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n##444|Yes, Dante. You're as real as any of your classmates.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|How do you know?##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Because I've talked to a lot of boys and girls just like you.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|There are other boys like me?##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|More than you can even imagine.##\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDante is very sensitive to the opinions of others, and seems to care deeply about being liked. He appears to experience great anxiety when even recalling situations where he believes he failed to meet expectations. He has also described difficulties with nonverbal communication and understanding the \"rubric\" by which he is being \"graded.\"\n\nI recommend that Mr. and Mrs. Lazzeri create a daily schedule for Dante, consisting of all of the tasks expected of him on a given day. This way, he has a clear idea of what he is supposed to do, and won't need to resort to simply guessing. Mr. and Mrs. Lazzeri should also encourage Dante to ask questions as much as he needs, particularly in regards to his tasks and to the emotions that either of them are feeling at any given moment. Hopefully, this will allow him to develop an understanding of what their emotional responses look like, so as to gradually reduce his confusion  on the topic.\n\nAdditionally, I will personally be speaking to Mr. Lazzeri about his communication style and encouraging him to provide clearer direction to Dante in the future; I will also request that he stop punishing Dante for unintentionally completing tasks \"wrong,\" as I believe this will only make Dante less likely to want to do those tasks in the future for fear of retribution.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n##000|**Now, Joan—**##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Dr. Lantry, please.##\n\n[[>]]\n##000|**—yes, of course.

Her primary complaint is, \"I don't feel like I know who I am.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Innocenti, Gina has presented avoidance of social situations for several months, as well as insomnia and sudden, unexplained bouts of crying.\n[[/div]]\n\n##444|Good afternoon, Gina.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Hey, are you the doctor my dad was telling me about?##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Must be!##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|Well, I hope you can help me.\nNo one else has been able to.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|I'm sorry to hear that, dear.

She seems to experience rejection sensitive dysphoria to such an extreme that she will avoid getting close to people whatsoever, to avoid rejection. She also appears deeply concerned with keeping up appearances, for fear that friends and loved ones will not accept her for who she truly is.\n\nI recommend that Gina be assigned a therapist and attend twice-monthly sessions with them. Mr. Innocenti should make a concerted effort to encourage Gina to explore things which interest her. I believe this will allow her to discover more about her identity, and begin to establish a healthier relationship with herself. I would also encourage Gina to begin keeping a journal, so that she can organize her thoughts and hopefully not become as overwhelmed by them.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n##000|//Joan?//##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Oh, hey.##\n\n[[>]]\n##000|//It's 4 in the morning.

His primary complaint is, \"I don't know what I'm doing with my life.\"\n\nAccording to Ms. De Santa, Romano was a very successful student, achieving very high grades throughout his academic career. Since leaving school, however, he has struggled to make friends, develop routines, and hold steady employment. He has been increasingly withdrawn for the last three months, and has sent increasingly cryptic messages to friends and loved ones.\n[[/div]]\n\n##444|Hello, Romano.##\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n##444|Well, um... your mother said you were struggling a lot with work.##\n\n##444|And that you've been really depressed recently.##\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n##444|Could you... elaborate on that for me?##\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n##444|Mmm.##\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n##444|I can wait.##\n\n[[=]]\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n##777|It just all used to be so much easier.\nWhen I was in school, I made friends without even trying.\nIn class, in sports, in choir, it didn't matter.\nI could just get along with people.##\n\n##777|But now, I just feel stuck.\nEveryone else grew up and went someplace else,\nand here I am and I'm still just me.\nAnd I don't know how to meet people,\nor make friends, or anything anymore.\nI just don't understand what changed.\nI feel like a switch flipped, and suddenly\neverything that used to be easy stopped being easy.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Was it //always// easy for you to make friends?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|I— well, when I was really little,\nI had a lot of trouble with it.\nBut I figured it out.\nAt least, for a while.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Why do you think you had trouble with it?\nWhen you were little, I mean.##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|I don't know.\nI don't remember much from back then.\nNot that I'd really care to.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|When you say everything \"stopped being easy,\"\nCould you clarify that for me?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|I mean,\nI feel like I used to be able to\ncharm an entire room full of people.\nI could get everybody laughing easily.##\n\n##777|But now, it's just exhausting.\nI still enjoy spending time with people,\nbut I can't make myself do it as much anymore.\nI just can't.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|When did it start becoming harder for you?##\n\n[[>]]\n##777|It was right after I finished my education.\nWell... really it was right //before// that.\nI was already getting really overwhelmed with\ntests and papers and events and—\nwell, everything really.##\n\n##777|And as soon as I was done,\nI just wanted to rest.\nI needed to recover.##\n\n##777|But I don't know how to... stop.

He is struggling mightily to adjust to life after education, particularly in regards to interpersonal relationships. He consistently holds himself to an impossible standard, which he then agonizes over failing to meet. Most of all, he seems filled with grief over having lost connection with many of friends and classmates from school. He is paralyzed by executive dysfunction, and a newfound lack of a rigorous schedule often keeps him from accomplishing even basic tasks.\n\nI recommend that Romano be assigned both a therapist, with whom he will attend twice-monthly sessions, and a social worker, who can aid in establishing schedules and helping him seek steady employment. In addition, Romano should be encouraged to engage with the community around him and establish relationships with the people in his vicinity; however, this should also be balanced by addressing his needs for alone time and not stretching him too thin.\n[[/div]]\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[>]]\n##00F|You do good work.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Who's there?##\n\n[[>]]\n##00F|Easy now.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|Are you— //oh.//##\n\n[[>]]\n##00F|I mean no harm.##\n[[/>]]\n\n##444|But how are you... here?
