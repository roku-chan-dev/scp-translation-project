Procedure 02-Dandelion is to be implemented once per instance within 14 days of initial containment. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4044 is a phenomenon in which persons in the late stages of terminal illness become capable of periodically altering local reality.\n\nAn estimated 85% of SCP-4044 activity is limited to relatively minor reconfigurations such as the spontaneous generation of preferred foods or manifestation of desired objects. Highly visible public episodes of anomalous behavior occur in the other ~15% of SCP-4044 events. Examples can be found below.\n\n**Notable Incidents:**\n||~ Designation ||~ Incident Overview ||~ Foundation Response ||\n||< **4044-1** || Instance repeatedly caused stock cars to manifest outside of hospital and race through surrounding neighborhood. Cars bounced off pedestrians and other vehicles without damage, honking loudly on impact. || First contact; only identified when instance expired due to natural causes and phenomenon ceased to occur. Cover story 4044-CS1 (\"Street Racing Hoodlums\") improvised by responding agents. Anomaly catalogued. ||\n||< **4044-61** || Instance manifested several large saurians [[footnote]] Matching no known species of dinosaur, but similar to popular depictions of //Velociraptor//.[[/footnote]] accompanied by an entity strongly resembling American actor Chris Pratt.[[footnote]] Investigation confirms Pratt was elsewhere on this date; he has been designated PoI-4044-61A and remains on passive monitoring.[[/footnote]] Entities assist instance in mounting a saurian and riding it to a nearby park. || Hospital staff amnesticized. Cover story 4044-CS64 (\"Guerrilla Marketing\") implemented. ||\n||< **4044-79** || Instance manifested space shuttle on roof of Mayo Clinic parking garage in Phoenix, AZ, USA and teleported self inside before launching. Rocket exhaust caused no injuries or property damage. || Class A amnestics mass-administered by air; high visibility of incident requires follow-up Class-B amnestic treatment of over 900 civilian witnesses. Instance last seen exiting Earth's atmosphere. ||\n\nFollowing incident 79, SCP-4044 containment procedures were updated to require acquisition and confinement of instances rather than //in situ// concealment of anomalous activity. Procedure 02-Dandelion was proposed at this time and implemented after unanimous approval from Ethics Committee Panel 4044-EC062.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"width:500px;border:solid 4px #000000; background:#ffd75e; padding:30px; margin-bottom: 10px;margin:0 auto;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #ffd75e; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 5px;margin:0 auto;\"]]\n\n++ ##ffd75e|**Procedure 02-Dandelion Overview:**##\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[==]]\n\n##000000|//Travel will be arranged for up to six individuals related to the instance.//##\n\n##000000|//Chosen individuals will be informed that their assistance is required for philanthropic medical research and compensated for their time.[[footnote]] Payments disbursed via Standard Distribution Channel Fi-009 (\"Tax Adjustment\").[[/footnote]]//##\n\n##000000|//Chosen individuals will be transported to the instance's location.
