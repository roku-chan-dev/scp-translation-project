While mostly sharing appearance with land snails, VNP-111 deviates from the baseline species in several areas.\n\nRoughly 7-10 cm in length, members of VNP-111 have heads that resemble that of classic depictions of European dragons -- with vertebrate-like jaw structures, complete with keratin teeth. These creatures have complex, reptilian eyes, and warm blooded metabolisms. Notably, VNP-111's have varyingly shaped structures on their head reminiscent of horns, though these horns composition are more akin to that of baseline snail eye stalks. \n\nMembers of //Helix dracarys// are capable of vocalizations in the forms of whistles, hoots and trills. This, combined with parental care and imprinting behaviors, has lead to the conclusion that VNP-111 have intelligence comparable to that of small mammals.\n\n//Helix dracarys// includes six unique, identifiable subspecies:\n* **//Helix dracarys draco//, Slimebellies:** vibrant red bodies, straight black horns, and speckled globose shells. Out of the VNP-111 in Vanguard's current possession, this subspecies is the most populous. They are incredibly hardy and resistant to temperature change. \n* **//Helix dracarys drake//, Oozedrakes:** Yellow bodies, curved horns, and striped globose shell. Second most populous subpsecies, display more group oriented behaviors. Prefer warmer climate. \n* **//Helix dracarys viperia//, Goowyverns:** dark blue-grey bodies, bumped horns, and flat shells. This subspecies has shown themselves to be semi-aquatic, most commonly gravitating towards bodies of water. Have a high tolerance for cold.\n* **//Helix dracarys lumbricina//, Blobwyrms:** striped green and gold bodies, singular horn, elongated conic shell. Display similar behavior to oozedrakes.\n* **//Helix dracarys lumidraco//, Glowdrakes:** blue-black bodies, straight horns, speckled globose shell, bioluminescent. Incredibly similar to slimebellies, glowdrakes are notably nocturnal species -- and hold preference to darker areas. \n* **//Helix dracarys wivre//, Gunkwyverns:** green, thin horns, domed shells. This dragonsnail subspecies are often times larger than the others, and shows propensity for inner-species territorialism, and live solitary.\n\nAdditionally, VNP-111 have the ability to produce a weak flame. Done in a methane sack via byproducts of their digestion, and their latent thaumaturgical nature. This ability to produce small, low heat flames is seemingly done to warn away potential threats, and as displays to attract possible mates.  \n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= dragonsnail2.png|caption= //Helix dracarys draco// |width=750px|align= center]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Normalization Protocols:** In-line with Vanguard's attempts to integrate paranormal species into the rest of the world, VNP-111 was analyzed for compatibility. After extensive research via environmental simulation and small scale control releases, on 12/04/2023 it was determined safe for VNP-111 to be released into the wild of North America as a means to combat species loss due to climate effects and habitat loss -- in part due to their hardier nature, and swift reproduction. \n\nAs of introduction, Vanguard will monitor and track the growth of the species and adaption to the wild over the next decades to observe stability. Some members of VNP-111 are to remain in captivity for the sake of conservation.\n\n**Addendum.111.1:** In 16/06/2047, a regular population census of VNP-111 was undergone. During this, a new subspecies of //Helix dracarys// was discovered. This subspecies, //H. dracayrs x G. stylommatophora//[[footnote]] Currently, the colloquial referral to this hybrid as just \"dragon-snails\" is widespread.[[/footnote]] appears to be the result of widespread hybridization of VNP-111 with a handful of other North American land snail species. How this was undergone despite differences in biology is currently up for debate, and the fact that these hybrids are fertile, are presently classified as a newfound property of VNP-111.\n\n//H. dracayrs x G. stylommatophora// can be identified by duller colors and smaller sizes than the average //Helix dracarys//, as well as the retaining of eye stalks as well as complex eyes. This subspecies is capable of quiet vocalization, but possesses no fire-breathing capabilities.  \n\nIt has been determined that the species //Helix dracarys// has established itself in a steady and healthy population -- and have well adapted into the environment as both a useful decomposer and a keystone prey for other animals.\n\nThey have also become popular pets.   \n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= dragonsnail3.png|caption= A hatchling //H. dracayrs x G. stylommatophora//, recovered during population census|width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 111.2:** As of 05/11/2048, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/8000-dead-rats-hub Washington Virion] has begun to spread throughout the United States.\n\nThis virus poses a threat to anomalous species[[footnote]] Majority of which are thaumaturgical in nature.

A loss of this ability will render members of the species incapable of regulating their body temperature, which could swiftly result in death. A large portion of other anomalous species similarly rely on EVE as part of their natural biology. \n\nEfforts by Vanguard to determine a way to mitigate environmental damage and extinction risk to already threatened anomalous species is underway.\n\nBelow is a compilation of relevant communications in the protective efforts of VNP-111 and others.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##green|@@s.yu@vanguard.int@@##\n**From:** ##green|@@a.zhong@vanguard.int@@##\n**Subject:** Current Situation\n[[/div]]\n------\nHey, Samnang, we have a major issue right now when it comes to the virus.

These animals measure roughly 4.2 meters long, and have been recorded reaching speeds of 72 km/hr in full sprint.\n\nThese nocturnal predators hunt in mate-bonded pairs, typically along roads present in heavily forested areas. Their range includes the Eastern and Northern regions of the United States, and Northern Canada. VNP-745 primarily prey on deer and other mammals, using their lights to stun their prey during pursuit. Due to poor vision, they rely primarily on smell, sound and movement.\n\nThis anomalous species is classified under //Allosaurus luxvenator// due to similarity skeletal structuring to those of //allosaurids//.\n\nDue to pre-Vanguard efforts by the Foundation to exterminate the species, VNP-745 is considered critically endangered.\n\n**Normalization Protocols:** Roads that are known hunting grounds of VNP-745 are to be designated via road signage -- knowledge of these signs meanings are to made widespread, added to all repository, and incorporated into driving manuals.\n\n**The directions for VNP-745 Hunting Grounds are as followed:**\n* Activate your vehicle's high beams, as VNP-745 pairs will believe you to be another pair, and keep their distance\n* If your vehicle is approached by a VNP-745 pair, do not slow down, create as much noise as possible to frighten them\n* It is not recommended to pick up hitchhikers, stop your vehicle for long periods, or exit your vehicle at any time\n* Do not bike nor motorcycle these roads at night\n* Do not to walk these roads at night\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Attachment: VNP-966\" hide=\"- VNP-966\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**ITEM №:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-966 VNP-966]\n\n**Specification:** VNP-966, called \"sleep killers\" colloquially and //Pan somnus// scientifically, are hairless and digitigrade-bipedal primates only visible at wavelengths ranging from 760 nm to about 900 nm -- making them only visible via infrared. \n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= somnus.png|caption= A pack of three VNP-966, picked up via an infrared trail cam. |width=250px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFamily unit pack hunters, VNP-966 are notably fragile -- with thin, light-weight bones, needle-like teeth and claws prone to breakage. Instead of hunting by force, VNP-966 are persistence predators that utilize a specialized soundwave (dubbed \"somnus waves\") that inhibits the ability to sleep, and will stalk their prey until they succumb to exhaustion. Primarily, they hunt medium-to-large-sized animals.\n\nVNP-966 are critically endangered due to pre-Vanguard Foundation efforts to drive them to extinction -- with their known remaining ranges being the Eastern and Southern United states, as well as Northern portions of South America. Like other species, they are protected from hunting and harm under the Predatory Anomalous Species Act (PASA) -- and are only legally permitted to be killed if ones life is considered to be at genuine risk. \n\n**Normalization Protocols:** A silent wave inverse of VNP-966's somnus wave was discovered on 07/10/2025, allowing for the production of personal, property, and household protective devices that render VNP-966 mostly incapable preying on humans and domestic animals -- as the cancellation of somnus waves renders their hunting methods useless.\n\nFiles containing the somnus wave were released to the public domain on 24/1/2026, and thus can also be played via personal devices and speakers without need of purchasing specially made devices.\n\nPeople living within areas with known VNP-966 packs, however, are to be given somnus wave producers to ensure self protection. Townships within these areas are advised to broadcast these waves to deter VNP-966s.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n**##green|Environmental Department##**\n##green|Shelter, Normalize, Inform##\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##green|@@s.yu@vanguard.int@@##\n**From:** ##green|@@a.zhong@vanguard.int@@##\n**Subject:** Re:Current Situation\n[[/div]]\n------\nFuck, yeah, right.

The sanctuary zones of Project Preservation are large-scale fenced quarantine pens, and members of threatened species are planned to be tranquilized and transported after undergoing a physical exam to ensure the animals are healthy.   \n\nEfforts to do this have been met with extreme levels of difficulty.\n\nWhile ranges of VNP-745 are all known and marked, tracking down the animals within their large hunting territories has been proven difficult. VNP-745 are nocturnal, and hide within brush and dug-out nests during the day to sleep. These camouflaged nests, combined with attempted night tracking, has lead to slow progress in the actual finding of VNP-745 instances to be located. Attempting to tranquilize members of the species at night has been proven dangerous for both the animals and personnel due to the speed at which they run at, and risk of aggravation. \n\nTracking efforts of VNP-966 packs via infrared equipment has proven reasonably successful, however only on small scale and at a slow pace due to the cost of said equipment, and the rationing of tranquillizers due to widespread efforts. \n\nWhile sanctuary zones for VNP-939 are already established, these are areas are not protected in the same way that those created by Project Preservation are. However, due to their lack of any actual bodily systems, it is currently unclear if they are capable of actually contracting and spreading the Washington Virion. Due to this, packs are under limited observation currently, with further action not yet being taken.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n------\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##green|@@s.yu@vanguard.int@@##\n**From:** ##green|@@a.zhong@vanguard.int@@##\n**Subject:** Project Preservation Update\n[[/div]]\n------\nHey, how's your team's progress out there?\n\nCause we're struggling a good bit.
