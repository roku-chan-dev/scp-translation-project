SCP-8888-J's particular sub-breed of goldendoodle[[footnote]](2022 Fall Collection Northeastern Coprocephalic Tennessee Williams Teapot Goldendoodle)[[/footnote]] possesses unique characteristics that make raising one difficult, such as:\n* Severe, nonstop anxiety.\n* Twelve different skin conditions, which cycle depending on external factors such as weather, political climate, and winning North Carolina State Lottery numbers.\n* Sexual attraction to broken glass.\n* Chronic, bloody, explosive diarrhea, which is triggered by even-numbered air temperatures in the Kelvin scale.\n* Nonstop awareness of the finality of death, coupled with an immovable conviction that the afterlife not only exists, but is run by dog-hating sledgehammer goblins who never share their cheeseburgers.\n* A heart of gold.\n* A buildup of trace metals and corrosion from said heart in the bloodstream, resulting in chronic hemorrhaging.\n* Militant opposition toward the Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965.\n* Refusal to eat any traditional dog food that does not include at least one AAA battery.\n* Sub-clinical narcissism.\n* Speech capabilities in English and Estonian, but exclusively at moments when a talking dog is neither expected nor wanted.\n* Six built-in years of extensive training in small firearms.\n* Feline leukemia.\n\nSCP-8888-J's anomalous effects manifest through causing his owner, Dr. Marsden, to no longer have the mental capacity to leave SCP-8888-J at home or with a sitter, leash him, or neuter him. \n\nTo date, all attempts to enforce the containment of SCP-8888-J have resulted in Dr. Marsden threatening to accidentally sell our payroll data to the Chaos Insurgency. As such, SCP-8888-J has been classified Cernunnos.\n-----\n> **Incident 8888-J-42**\n> **Date:** 6/29/2024\n> \n> <Begin Log> \n> \n> //[Junior Researcher Tim Acikgoz carries SCP-49222[[footnote]](\"Ark of Barren Tomorrows\", object class: Keter, a 200-kilogram stone chest covered with the ancient blood of unborn ponies, requires twice-daily procession around the grounds of Site-59 by a single Turkish freestyle rapper with untreated hemorrhoids in order to keep the entity within sealed)[[/footnote]] on its second procession of the day, while singing the sacred chant that keeps it sealed.]//\n> \n> **Acikgoz:** //...Stop.
