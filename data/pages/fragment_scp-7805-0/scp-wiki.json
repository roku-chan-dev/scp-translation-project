Containment procedures still apply.\n------\n\n**__Description:__** SCP-7805 is the designation given to three main components which function together to cause anomalous effects, these being SCP-7805-α, SCP-7805-ß and SCP-7805-δ. SCP-7805-1 refers to the initial instance of SCP-7805. Further instances have been labelled in order of chronological appearance, however this system is regarded as heavily redundant due to the seemingly infinite appearances SCP-7805 can take thus referring to the anomaly as a whole is most appropriate and less confusing.\n\nSCP-7805-1α is a run-down dark green shelter located 8km south-east of Site-549 which functions as a bus stop for SCP-7805-1ß. A bench is attached to the inside of the shelter and a simple white bike rack with worn-out paint is placed beside it. Significant markings include: 1) a green sign with text: \"Bus Stop\" located on the side of the roof, 2) a yellow sign with text: \"Signal Driver\" located to the right of the green sign, and 3) a four-digit number[[footnote]] This number has noticeably changed three times over the course of experimentation and exploration and currently reads 2514. [[/footnote]] with white lettering located on the outside-wall of the stop.\n\nSCP-7805-1ß is a standard blue bus with a capacity of 58. It has no external markings besides the number twelve written in white lettering placed on the front of the bus underneath the front window. The inside of the bus contains grey walls, 43 grey seats, 15 blue handles for standing passengers, a driver's seat and standard driving components. SCP-7805-1ß appears to be solely controlled by SCP-7805-1δ and it is unknown whether or not this is the only way its anomalous effects can occur. This component's anomalous effects include the ability to evaporate targeted individuals, transportation to different dimensions and/or different locations in this universe and durability against significantly different climates and conditions.\n\nSCP-7805-1δ appears to be a Caucasian, elderly male with balding white hair, hazel eyes and a blue driving uniform with the name: \"Robert McZimmerman\" sewn on the left lapel. SCP-7805-1δ is the driver of SCP-7805-1ß with no major anomalous abilities, besides the presumed ability to survive in a variety of different physical and atmospheric environments. Whether or not this is attributed to SCP-7805-1δ himself or to the inside of SCP-7805-1ß is unknown.\n\nDescriptions of other instances of SCP-7805 can be read in **Addendum #6**.\n\n------\n\n**__Discovery:__** SCP-7805 was brought to the Foundation's attention on 10/3/2016, when the lead researcher of [[[SCP-7057]]]: Dr. Romilly (henceforth referred to as Subject 7805-A), was reportedly \"acting strange\" by their fellow researchers and was hence sent to Site-549's medical infirmary and after 30 minutes of silence finally mentioned their coming into contact with an anomalous bus. Following an interview with Subject 7805-A, the location of SCP-7805-1α was reported and restricted access to SCP-7805-1α was established. As a result of SCP-7805 seemingly targeting Subject 7805-A after certain experimentation on SCP-7057, it has been noted that a connection between SCP-7057 and SCP-7805 may exist. The nature of this connection is still under documentation.\n\n------\n\n= **__Addendum #1 - Transcript of Interview with Subject 7805-A__**\n**Subject 7805-A Interview Information:** Interview with Subject 7805-A was conducted on 12/3/2016 by interdimensional researcher **Dr. Bradley Matthews** at Site-549.\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Click to view: Interview Log - Subject 7805-A\" hide=\"Interview Log: Subject 7805-A, Full Transcript\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n> {{INTERVIEW BEGINS AT 12/3/2016, 20:33}}\n>\n> //**Subject 7805-A** sits down//.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Hello, Dr. Romilly. How are you today?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** (//quietly//) I'm...okay, I guess.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Do you think you're ready to talk about your experience with SCP-7805?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Um...I think so. What do you want to know?\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** If you are comfortable doing so, I would like you to recount as much as you can about SCP-7805.\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** (//Subject clears throat//) Ok, so I was coming home after doing an experiment on SCP-7057 and I-\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Hold that thought for a sec, Morgan. Which experiment was this?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** (//Subject looks confused//) Uh...how is this relevant?\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Trust me, it is //very// crucial we get every detail about what happened that day. So, what tests did you do on SCP-7057?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Okay, um...so we started by [REDACTED]\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Alright, thanks for being honest and aiding our knowledge on SCP-7805. So, go on. You were coming home from work when...\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** So...I, uh...was heading to the bus stop I would usually wait at when I saw one much closer to here so I though: \"Hey, this might save me some time!\" So then, I...\n>  _\n> //**Subject 7805-A** glances off into the distance//.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Uh, Morgan? Will you be able to continue the interview?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Oh, uh...yeah, sure. I'm sorry. It's just quite overwhelming reliving it. So...I waited at this new stop when a bus stopped, like it usually would...and I didn't think too much of it, I just went on it like I usually do. Paid the fare, found a seat, dozed off a bit, you know, the usually things you do.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Yes, that makes sense. Can you tell me anything about the driver of this so-called bus?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Uh...not much, other then he just seemed like a normal dude. Took my money and just started driving. Nothing unusual.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Yeah? Okay, interesting...anything abnormal about the journey?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** (//Subject takes a deep breath//) The, uh...first ride was pretty normal. You know...bus regularly stopping and starting as people leave and come on. Then...the, //clears throat//, the ride takes a turn. The outside seems to get much darker than it usually would at that time.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** And what time was this at, Dr. Romilly?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** I, uh...I'm not quite sure but it was around 16:04 when I boarded the bus and I'd say...20 minutes after when I started to notice something was wrong.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Okay so you'd say it was about 16:25, then?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Yeah around then. Sun doesn't usually set till well after. So anyway, I look outside my window and I see a dark blue sky, not too abnormal but still not quite right given the time. (//Subject starts to speak faster//) So I get a bit spooked when all of a sudden I see these strange looking plants with like neon-yellow leaves and hexagonal-shaped red flowers and so I start to freak out and I press the stop button and the bus stops at the next stop and I exit the bus and the driver gives me a weird look as I get off and then there I am in the middle of this weird place with freaky plants with no way to get back home and my phone stops working and-\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Okay, okay, slow down, Dr. Romilly. Take a breather.\n>  _\n> //**Subject 7805-A** takes a few deep breaths.//\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Okay, so I'm in this weird place and for a while I am freaking out. A few minutes pass and then I see a pair of headlights. And so I wave them down and see that it is another bus, however looks much more, let's say, steampunk-ish.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** What do you mean by that exactly?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Oh, you know. Cogs and gears everywhere. Exhaust pipes in places where they probably shouldn't be. Even the driver was steampunk, wearing those weird goggles.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Could you talk a bit more about the driver of this bus?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Uh, ye. Nothing much to say about her, except for she wouldn't let me on the bus unless I played double the fare. I mean, of course I paid it; I had no other way to get out of here. Now for this one, I was much more alert and noticed the weird passengers on this bus. Pretty much none of them looked the same as another. All different shapes and sizes. I think I mighta seen a talking pig.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Alright, interesting...now where did this bus take you?\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Fortunately, it took me back to the first stop. I thanked the driver so much and was in tears. Right before the bus arrived I actually was starting to get eyed by a scary-looking owl creature. I pushed that stop button so quickly.\n>  _\n> **Dr. Matthews:** Would you say that is an extensive enough recount of your experience?\n>  _\n> //About 2 minutes pass before **Subject 7805-A** responds.//\n>  _\n> **Subject 7805-A:** Uh...yeah. Anything else you want to hear?\n>  _\n> //**Dr. Matthews** pulls out a map of the local area.//\n>  _\n>  **Dr. Matthews:** Could you show me on this map around whereabouts you would say this bus stop is?\n> \n> //**Subject 7805-A** points to location of SCP-7805-1α on map.//\n> \n> **Dr. Matthews:** Right here?\n> \n> //**Subject 7805-A** nods.//\n> \n> **Dr. Matthews:** Cool, we'll get our agents right on it. You're free to go.\n> \n> {{INTERVIEW CONCLUDES AT 12/3/2016, 20:56}}\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n[[=]]\n**__Addendum #2 - Summary of SCP-7805 Experiments 01-05__**\n\n||~ Experiment No. ||~ Description ||~ Findings ||\n||= #01 ||= One Class-D is told to enter SCP-7805-1ß without paying the bus fare ||= The Class-D disappears and is never seen again.  _\n{{NOTE: Following this experiment, the number located on the outside wall of SCP-7805-1α changed from 2501 to 2502.}} ||\n||= #02 ||= One Class-D with a tracking device implanted into the back of his neck is told to enter SCP-7805-1ß and pay the fare. He is also informed to avoid interaction with any passengers on the bus and the driver of the bus and that he is to do the same with any subsequent instance of SCP-7805-ß. ||= The tracking device works for around five (5) minutes until seemingly falling out of range, occurring around 4km away from SCP-7805-1α. Nearly 1 hour passes before the Class-D returns back to SCP-7805-1α, on a pink and yellow bus with a vastly different shape to standard buses ({{This has now been allocated designation SCP-7805-4ß}}). Class-D reportedly went on three (3) bus rides in total, with their fares each costing more than the previous one. Descriptions on the locations and other instances of SCP-7805 were documented ({{See **Addendum #6**}}). ||\n||= #03 ||= Three Class-D are told different instructions. First Subject (D-7805-3) is told to not pay the fare or interact with any passengers or drivers. Second Subject (D-7805-4) is told to pay the fare and not to interact with any passengers or drivers. Third Subject (D-7805-5) is told to pay the fare and to interact with all drivers and as many passengers as appropriate. ||= D-7805-3 does not return. D-7805-4 and D-7805-5 do return after two bus rides, however the latter subject has a wounded left arm and a bruised right eye. According to recounts from both surviving subjects, SCP-7805-1δ pushed a special, blue button on the dashboard after D-7805-3 refused to pay the fare, causing the Subject to seemingly evaporate.[[footnote]] Although it is unknown whether D-7805-3 is incapacitated or not, he has been documented as deceased. [[/footnote]] D-7805-4 mentioned that the fare for the second bus ride was more than the first, however for D-7805-5 the fare was actually lower than the first. Based on this information, it appears interacting with the driver of the bus has an impact on the price of the buses.[[footnote]] After many more experiments, this effect is tied to each individual and still occurs even after months have passed since the last bus ride one has taken. [[/footnote]] D-7805-5's injuries occurred after he talked to a disgruntled creature with a deformed face. However, interaction with other passengers did result in both valuable conversation regarding the nature of SCP-7805 and D-7805-5's receiving of a decorated box.[[footnote]] No anomalous properties have been found to exert from this item, however experimentation is ongoing. [[/footnote]] The key point of information that D-7805-5 found from conversing with passengers was that SCP-7805 is a large bus service-network with the ability to transport between different realities. ||\n||= #04 ||= Two Class-D are given slightly different instructions. Both are told to pay the correct fare and to interact with the bus driver. One is told to only interact with SCP-7805-δs, while the other is told to interact with passengers as well. ||= Neither Subjects return. Reason unknown due to absence of documentation.  _\n{{NOTE: The number on SCP-7805-1α changed from 2502 to 2504 after this incident.}}  _\n**{{EDIT: Further knowledge of this incident has been provided through the improved ability to communicate with the driver. Both were perfectly safe during the ride on SCP-7805-1ß. Health problems began when they entered a different reality (Dimension-7805-5) which, according to SCP-7805-1δ's testimony, seems to have had vastly different laws of physics to ours, causing their bodies to implode upon exiting SCP-7805-1ß.}}** ||\n||= #05 ||= Two Class-D wearing //specialised suits//[[footnote]] For more information, contact your RAISA supervisor.

One is told to get off the bus normally (D-7805-8), while the other is told to stay on the bus as long as possible (D-7805-9). ||= D-7805-9, returns to SCP-7805-1α well before D-7805-8. Disciplinary action was underway until the Subject explained that he had figured out how to communicate with SCP-7805-1δ and hence was able to tell him to return to SCP-7805-1α ({{For more information, see **Addendum #5**}}). D-7805-8 returns an hour later with a profusely bleeding right arm. She stated it was caused by a hostile creature residing in the second alternate dimension she was taken to. This Subject reportedly went on four bus rides before returning back, however not much information was gathered on these locations as she soon after dropped dead from immense blood loss, despite the medic's best efforts. ||\n\n[[/=]]\n------\n= **__Addendum #3 - Discussion with Ethics Committee regarding use of Class-D personnel in the experimentation of SCP-7805__**\n[[=]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Ethics Committee\n**From:** Dir.

Each of these experiments required the use of Class-D personnel, with some of them unfortunately being either KIA or MIA. I would like to add that these casualties and injuries appear to be largely related to the misuse of SCP-7805 and hence blame could be accurately placed on the harmed individuals themselves. However, instruction from researchers given to these Class-D personnel may have influenced their actions to result in harm. Therefore, I propose experimentation with the use of Class-D subjects continue under measured regulation, ensuring as little harm is caused to them as possible. I think we're close to an important discovery, and this anomaly could definitely be useful in the capturing of dangerous and escaped anomalies.\n\n- Director Hugh Bradley\n\n//**Staff of the SCP Foundation**//\n//##grey|Head of Site 549##//\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir.

While there is the slight risk that dangerous anomalies may be passengers on these buses, and that seeing members wearing Foundation issued suits could provoke them, I think that this situation would be too rare to occur and that the risk is worth the benefit that this anomaly could provide.
