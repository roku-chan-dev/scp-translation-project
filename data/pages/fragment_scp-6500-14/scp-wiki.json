It was far too big, so she stopped looking at it. The second thing she saw was her body; it was indeed naked, so she closed the labcoat over it and started doing up the buttons. The third thing she saw was a second moon, also far too big, and in the process of confirming that there were in fact two moons in the sky -- the pale green sky -- she accidentally saw a fourth thing, the third moon, and was forced to acknowledge the uncomfortable truth.\n\nShe sat up in a measureless, undifferentiated plain of orange desert just in time to see a sooty cloud dissipate on the horizon. She felt a pang in her heart, and she didn't know why. She only knew she had brought that thing here with her, here to...\n\n\"Corbenic.\" Her voice was surprisingly calm and clear. \"I'm dead?\"\n\n//Let's put a pin in that.//\n\nShe reached into her breast pocket out of habit, and was surprised to find her Coke bottle glasses there. She put them on, and winced; there was something wrong with the lenses. She tapped them, and winced again at the dull response. //Plastic. Oh, dear.// She clambered to her unshod feet.\n\nA rhythmic thumping greeted her, and she turned to see -- //What else?// -- a kangaroo loping toward her. \"Oh,\" she said. She knew what this was, she'd read the low-clearance parts of the [/operation-galahad Operation Galahad] dossier a few years back. It was called a Flame Bearer, and she wasn't sure if there was more than one of them. They didn't live in the Great Desert, though. Where...\n\nIt was getting close. She took a step back, and it took a giant leap forward as if to demonstrate the futility of this gesture. It peered down at her with judgemental black eyes, then reached into its pouch with one clawed paw. She saw the paw clench into an almost-fist, and reached for her own pouch -- the reagents on her belt -- before her complete lack of pants caught up to her.\n\nThe kangaroo withdrew its paw, held it between them, and opened it.\n\nIt was empty.\n\n[[image kangarooSmall.jpg class=\"img-responsive\"  link=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-6500-14/kangaroo.jpg\"]]\n\nThe Flame Bearer stared morosely at its own empty pad for a few moments, glared accusingly at her, then turned and loped away again.\n\n\"Okay,\" she said.\n\nLacking any particular reason not to, she followed it.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-6500-14/SCPasterisk.svg]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Cinzel; font-size: 200%; color:black\"]]Foundation Mission Control[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-6500-14/SCPdivider.svg]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Any change?\"\n\nAlthough FMC at Area-08 was presently monitoring over one thousand extraterrestrial objects, Director Richard Barnard didn't need to specify which one he meant.

The restoration of anomalous equilibrium had brought the self-styled 'lookout' out of her foetal position more than a week ago, and she had immediately aimed one long finger at humanity's pale blue dot. This had initially occasioned some debate about what threat she might be detecting, but that was over now.\n\nShe was pointing at the Foundation. Everybody knew they had caused the Impasse -- though nobody knew //how// everybody knew -- and they also knew that the O5 Council had taken a vote on what to do about it. Until that vote passed, all anomalous life in the universe was potentially at risk.\n\nThe vote had been six days ago, and yet...

[/scp-2578 SCP-2578-D] was a horseshoe crab in Earth orbit, a bizarrely-shaped drone spacecraft belonging to Corbenic's militant Three Moons Initiative. They used it to lase holes in fascist dictators. It had disappeared during the Impasse, either fleeing through a dimensional aperture on the dark side of the moon or else activating some sort of cloaking mechanism. The latter now seemed much more likely. \"What's it doing?\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The controller blanched. \"Pointing its stinger at Site-01.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Barnard nodded again. \"Well, I was already going to say, let's call--\"\n\nA second //beep,// this one more insistent. \"Getting a message from them,\" the controller reported. \"2578-D, not Site-01.\"\n\n\"Well, let's see it.\"\n\nWhile he waited for the printer, Barnard examined the big board more carefully.

Corbenic was an afterlife; you were supposed to have to die to get there. She couldn't remember having died, yet here she was. You were also supposed to arrive there bare as the day you'd been born, and yet she'd somehow kept her labcoat and the general gist of her eyewear. The lenses even seemed to be focusing; she wondered if they'd sound like glass, now. What did it all mean?\n\n//It means Corbenic is affected by the Impasse.// That wasn't really news. All contact between the lands of the living and the dead had abruptly ceased months ago.\n\nThe Flame Bearer looked back at her occasionally, nodding when it saw she was still there. That made her feel a little better about her decision to follow it, if only a little. She noted that they were moving in the direction of the strange black cloud she'd seen on awakening, and wondered what the connection was. A faint starry light shone in the pea soup sky, beneath the cluster of moons; they were moving toward that, as well. //Been a hell of an interdimensional pub crawl,// she mused. //From Kayaköy to the Wanderers' Library to... to...//\n\n//Oh no oh no oh no//\n\nShe remembered it all in a rush of terrible understanding. Her flight through the Palace of Alagadda, the billowing, bellowing shade in pursuit, knowing she'd saved her friends but doomed herself, her wards failing, flinging the last of her power behind her at the encroaching black, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel...\n\nShe closed her eyes tight. //I brought the Hanged King to Corbenic.// She opened her eyes just in time to avoid running into the kangaroo.\n\nIt was looking down at her with an expression of intense concentration, its huge brown eyes squinting, its jaw set, paws clenched.

Where her Mobile Task Forces went, so did she. That meant she split her time between Site-43 and various hot-spots in Canada and the United States, which in turn meant she spent virtually no time at other Foundation facilities. She therefore hadn't been here in years, and there were changes on every scale. Obvious lines in the sod where Broken God gear-renders had torn up the old grass; obvious rebuilding where the Chaos Insurgency had flattened the exterior walls; obvious shutters on one entire wing, shut down in the wake of the mass die-off. Site-19 had suffered the one-two punch of the [/resurrection-old-foes-hub Foundation Elimination Coalition] last October and the horrors of the Impasse, and like everywhere else it had been profoundly changed.

She took the opportunity to collect her thoughts. \"I don't like Italian food.\"\n\nMoose blinked, and pursed her lips. Ibanez shrugged. \"Olive Garden. Joke?\"\n\nMoose flicked a file on her desk with a neatly-clipped fingernail. \"You're going on leave to Site-91, where you'll tell Dr. Okorie's parents what happened to her.

A different world fell together in its place, and she shuddered at the profundity of the change. She was sitting on a grassless, blasted hillock, back against some gnarled and twisted thing, gazing at a turbulent sky of charcoal grey and pus yellow through a pair of almond eyeholes. A vulgar metropolis of black and gold spread across the plain below, pulling the dead soil tight like a scab on the skin, an ocean of opaque jet surrounding it.

She preferred to attract attention with her actions alone. This particular dress was sure to occasion some comment: a high neckline and a low, split hem, shimmering saffron and glittering gold, catching so much light that it had to be somehow luminescent itself.

She lifted the flap and examined the contents, sighing with relief when everything checked out. She felt itchy all over, and she didn't know how to scratch it, and it worried her how much she wanted to.\n\n[[span class=\"BlackLord\"]]**THAT'S THE THING PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORRUPTION.

They were now trekking across a glimmering sea of gel, an expanse of tiny turquoise balls which squirmed beneath their cautious tread.\n\nThe once-interminable march had become measurable, almost pleasurable in the company of Udo's father. His plan was lunacy, and she shuddered to imagine how she might set it in motion, but at least it didn't take long to outline. They had plenty of time for less stressful conversation, for catching up, for [[span class=\"WhiteLord\"]]**AVOIDING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.**[[/span]]\n\nShe shot their diligent stalker a dirty look.\n\n\"It was a brave thing you did,\" Obi was saying. \"To draw the Hanged King away from your friends.

The kangaroo's head was ablaze, and it reared back to shout to the heavens: [[span class=\"FlameBearer\"]]ARISE, O LORD BENEATH![[/span]]\n\nThe gel rose up around it, and it was gone.

She had expected the mass masquerade, but she had //not// expected the massacre.\n\nThey were everywhere, the porcelain-veiled Alagaddans, laying prostrate in the street, slumped over in shadowed arcades, face down in reflectionless reflecting pools or simply sitting down, breathing low, holding their masks to their faces like they needed them to breathe.\n\n[[span class=\"BlackLord\"]]**THE LIVING ARE LOST, AND DEATH COMES FOR THE DEAD.**[[/span]]\n\n\"What's wr--\"\n\n[[span class=\"BlackLord\"]]**I CAN HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS, YOU KNOW,**[[/span]] the voice chided.

Hunched figures in black robes moved door to door, knocking, waving wrought iron censers and further deepening the xanthous mist.

That is to say, she knew more books of magic than we even knew existed.\" He squeezed one nodule between his thumb and forefinger, as if trying to make it burst. \"She even knew something of the Athenaeum of Severed Tongues. How to get there. What we might find.\"\n\n\"The library of Alagadda.\" Udo grimaced. \"The safer one, rather.\"\n\n\"Not that safe, as it happened.\" Obi let the last of the spheres roll off his fingertips, into the emptiness. \"We were engaged to be married when I went through the Janus Gate with my armed escort.

They pulled me out of there three days later, me and my men and women, all of us spent and wasted and stark raving mad.

She didn't fancy meeting one up close.\n\nThe broad oak doors were unlocked and open wide -- //Which is good, because I'm not ready to go home just yet// -- the encircling foyer beyond devoid of both life and smog. Her heeled boots dug into the rich saffron carpet, which emitted small clouds of yellow; the fire in her mask still burned, and the incense deflected the dust with reassuring efficacy. There were arches and cupolas and lunettes and oriels in a cacophony of architectural styles, and row after row of soaring columns. She followed them up, up, up, before forcing her eyes back down.

She had expected it to be empty, but it wasn't; nearly every seat was filled. Hundreds, no, thousands of Alagaddans stared transfixed at the performer, their eye and mouth holes clotted up with bile, pus and blood. Many of them were unmoving. Many more were shuddering, coughing, sneezing and weeping. Gold-masked attendants walked the aisles, attentively pressing the uncongealed matter back into the masks to a litany of strangled protests. //Fuck.//\n\n[[span class=\"YellowLord\"]]**STAY YOUR NO DOUBT APPRECIATIVE HAND. APPLAUSE IS FORBIDDEN IN ALAGADDA.**[[/span]] \n\nThe yellow carpet was virtually spotless, and produced no mist. The air in the theatre was instead filled with raucous unmusic pouring from a tremendous black piano on the stage, where a figure in flaxen robes hammered madly at the keys. She couldn't see its hands, but its robe was bunched up where they should be, slamming into the piano as fists or picking out the anti-melody with mummified fingertips.\n\n[[span class=\"YellowLord\"]]**DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE VIROLOGY OF IDEAS, CHIEF IBANEZ?**[[/span]] \n\nShe walked down the central aisle, passing one of the solicitous Dissonants.

[[span class=\"YellowLord\"]]**I DIDN'T KNOW YOU PLAYED.**[[/span]]\n\n\"Enough with the bullshit.\" The crowd was stirring now, choking, pulling at their masks and clawing at their eyes. \"Give me your key.\"\n\nAgain that demented laughter.

They clanged in protest. \"You've been trapped here a long time, I guess you don't know. My Earth is gripped by a disease that never ends. It eats us away, day by day. And we don't care! We go about our business. We don't worry about getting sick, we don't worry about getting //other people// sick, we pretend like it isn't happening because we're bored with it.

Not about others -- because they're not //us.// Disease holds no meaning when you're touched in the head like we are.\" She leaned forward, hands on the bench between her legs. \"We once imagined a world without disease, and you know what?

The silence of the streets outside oppressed her with their ugly import.

[[span class=\"RedLord\"]]**I RUN AN EQUITABLE ESTABLISHMENT. THERE'S SURE TO BE WEAKER SPIRITS IN STOCK, FOR WEAKER SPIRITS LIKE YOURS.**[[/span]]\n\nShe found a black bottle with white stencilling behind the bar: Cháteau Lafite, 1787. \"You weren't joking.\"\n\n[[span class=\"RedLord\"]]**NOT ALWAYS, BUT OFTEN.**[[/span]] \n\nWhen she returned to the table, the Lord was already hunched over its mug.

She was surprised and relieved to find that the bottle of red wine contained, in fact, red wine. \"Give me that, and you can take what you want. //After// you drink.\" She wiped her lips off on her dress sleeve.\n\nThe lord was virtually vibrating in its seat as it placed the flagon to its sneering graven lips.

The scene around the fortress in the firmament was as far removed from the stark nothingness below as could be practically imagined: a polyglot array of impossible vessels, sleek designs of colourful metal kept a loft by repulsors glowing with the heat of at least several suns, unfathomably vast capital ships looking like something out of //Star Wars// or the bastard child of a model collector's bits box, and so many smaller fighter craft of a dozen different descriptions that merely trying to keep track of their movements nearly sent her spiralling to the distant sands. \n\nLike the Great Desert before it, //Thbbbbt Thbbbbt Thbbbbt//'s seemingly interminable tentacle finally terminated, leaving them stranded high in the sky with a view to end all views. Dichotomy offered two soaring skylines, one stretching toward the trio of moons and the other hanging over the wastes like a melted cake. The upper hull was orange and the lower hull was blue, wrapped around a central cavity lambent with radiated white. The light, however, was dying as a sentient charcoal nebula roared through the immense luminous spires, enveloping them, pulling them down and apart or sending coruscating spiderweb cracks through their trunks. There was a constant musical tone like the shattering of wine glasses, and every science fiction laser sound effect she'd ever heard (plus several novel ones) rang out as the Three Moons Initiative tried in vain to pierce the Hanged King's shroud. She almost fancied she could see him standing in the glow and gloom at the citadel's core, drawing down the artificial sun.\n\n[[span class=\"WhiteLord\"]]**A SIGHT TO DIE FOR, DON'T YOU THINK?

A lone, dark woman in simple military dress strode down to meet them, and for one horrible moment of narrative auspiciousness Udo thought she was going to meet her mother.\n\nThe woman was too tall, her eyes too dark, and her expression too displeased for that to be the case. She stuck out a hand, and Udo took it without thinking. \"This is your fault,\" the woman declared, jerking her free thumb over her shoulder. \"Thanks so much.\"\n\nUdo nodded. \"Yeah, well, I don't know how scientific your spaceships are, but if they're even a little bit magic they're only flying because of //me.//\"\n\nThe woman suddenly smiled, a gesture at least partially predatory. \"Hell of a thing to take credit for. The Foundation kills magic stone dead, you D&D it back slow as molasses, and I'm supposed to be thankful? No thanks.\" She backed back up the ramp. \"Anyway. The Impenetrable thinks you might be useful, said I should dump you in Dichotomy if you somehow found your way here. Didn't think there was much chance of that, I'll admit.\" She shook her head, resting one hand on a telescoping strut. \"Not sure I want to risk getting close to that //thing// -- not a word I use lightly in Corbenic -- just to watch another catspaw get eaten.\"\n\n[[span class=\"WhiteLord\"]]**YOUR FATHER'S SACRIFICE, FOR NAUGHT.**[[/span]]\n\nUdo shut the voice out. \"We risked a lot to get here.

She could see orange-robed monks standing on the bottom of the orange half, on the ceiling from her perspective, all of them staring into the core of the Hanged King's maelstrom.

Not a damn thing, since time immemorial. You talk about your pool of tears? They've gone stagnant, your high-and-lowness, and you're still drowning in them.\" She pointed at the aperture. \"That's why you're going nowhere, don't you get it? There's no tension within you. You're still chained to that throne. //You're still in Alagadda,// and you're never going to leave. You have no hopes, no dreams, no soul... you're just a dead husk with a city-shaped accretion of hate built up around it. There's nowhere to go for you, but back in the cage.\"\n\n[[span class=\"HangedKing\"]]**I WILL NOT RETURN TO ALAGADDA!**[[/span]] The darkness pressed her back, shoving her roughly to the steel, and her glasses fell from her face.

All your power, all your strength, and you're using it to lie to yourself? To hide from the horrors that even you fear?\" She held her hands in front of her face, carving a veritable zodiac in front of her to spare a few final moments from the rushing tide. \"The Lords of Alagadda have fallen. Your city is waiting for you.\"\n\n[[span class=\"HangedKing\"]]**I SPIT ON MY CITY.

It turned its nightmare face upon her, and asked: [[span class=\"HangedKing\"]]**WHY?**[[/span]] \n\nShe shrugged. \"Because the choice wasn't his, and it isn't mine. It's yours.\" She gestured back at the aperture, which still showed the silent throne of Alagadda. \"Your servants await you. A second chance.

He picked up speed and kicked, and the mask skittered across the riveted surface of Dichotomy. He tore the robe from its back, and left it shuddering in a pool of spreading ichor.

She only saw her father standing before her, holding the soiled white robe, eyes shining. \"Told you,\" he said.\n\nShe made a noise halfway between joy and despair, a loud ungracious outburst of emotion. \"I opened it,\" she said. \"I opened the goddamn thing myself.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Of course you did. The ways you've changed, the //things// you've changed, you're twice the spirit that empty husk could ever be. You know who you are, Udo. You're not lying to yourself, and I'm not lying to you either. Not anymore.\" He shook out the impossibly bright fabric, spattering the deck with flecks of gunk. \"But that's not the only reason it opened for you. You're torn between two places, like those monks above and below. You want to go with your friend, and you want to stay here with me.

This, then, was goodbye. \n\nHe walked her to the portal, and smiled in the face of her tears.\n\n\"Will you be okay?\" It was a stupid question, but she had to ask. She had to hear him lie to her, if only one more time. She hoped he wouldn't mind.\n\nHe laughed. \"You found me in the desert, and you brought me to the end.
