Video feeds are to be checked once every 24 hours for any change in SCP-5320’s shape or location. SCP-5320’s current locations are mapped and may be accessed with permission from Dr. Keul. \n\nSCP-5320 can be formally referred to as The Fish That Just Goes On Forever, Our Merciful and Long Lord, or Its Glorious Infinitude, Hail Its Everlasting Fish Body. Chances of locating the head or tail of SCP-5320 may be increased by offering sacrifices in the form of vending machine snacks placed on top of the break room microwave. Removal of present offerings is strictly forbidden. [[footnote]] Offerings must be left on the microwave in order to preserve the site’s current internet speed. Internet may slow if offerings are removed, as proved by one test conducted by Researcher Avery. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5320 most closely resembles a Liparidae [[footnote]] Snailfish [[/footnote]], but without a visible head or tail. Although width and height measure in normal ranges for its species, SCP-5320’s body extends as long as Foundation underwater drones have been able to follow it, concluding that the creature is either extremely long or limitless entirely. Efforts to locate the head or tail of SCP-5320 are ongoing. The creature was discovered during a routine bi-yearly sweep of the ocean floor. The drone responsible for the discovery examined the creature for approximately 50 hours and 38 kilometers before steps to anomalous classification proceeded. Underwater drones have been following the length of SCP-5320’s continuously for three years since, making the estimate for SCP-5320’s length between 37,000 and 39,000 kilometers long and perpetually increasing.\n\nAdditional side effects of viewing SCP-5320 include a heightened awareness of the passage of time, increased interest in ceiling tile number, and increased use of the phrase “long boy” in casual conversation, even when referring to things that are neither long nor a boy. Personnel monitoring SCP-5320 have reported feeling an unusual amount of excitement upon seeing one of SCP-5320’s occassionally-visible fins, as well as a compulsion to loudly cheer. \n\n**Addendum 5320-1:** The People’s Church Of The Fish That Just Goes On Forever has received a new addition to the Shrine in the form of two (2) fish-shaped novelty erasers, gifted to the Church by one Kenny Rosenfield, age 8, progeny of Researcher Margaret Rosenfield.\n------\n> \n> **Log taken from security recordings within primary surveillance office**\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Barlow:** Hey.\n> \n> **Avery:** Hey.

I will finish due diligence to officially close this investigation upon arrival back at Site-211. The \"effects\" of SCP-5320's suspected additional ability turned out to be nothing more than a very elaborate running joke among the staff. Dr. Keul has promised to tone it down and keep any further tomfoolery out of the Foundation database.//\n\n//Today marks the fourth consecutive false alarm I have had in the past several months.
