I don't know if there's anyone left that could change it.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5825 is the sudden cessation of life of all human lifeforms. SCP-5825 occurred at\n\nFuck clinical tone. I was never good at it anyway. Everyone is dead. I thought it might be localized, but I traveled as far as my car could take me yesterday. There is no one. Cell towers and internet seem to be down.\n\nSite-32 is filled with the corpses of my former co-workers. I can't go more than an hour without throwing up. I spend most of my time on the beach. There are corpses there, too, but there are long stretches of land without them. The tide washed many of them away.\n\nI sit on the beach and I close my eyes as if when I open them this will all be a bad dream but it isn't. It's real, it's all too real and it's sickening and it's tragic.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Why don't I remember it? And why am I still here?\n\nI stayed because there were resources here. Food. Shelter. Water. But it's too much. I'm leaving tomorrow, for a while at least. Searching for survivors.\n\nIf by some miracle anybody sees this, please\n\nhelp. find me. i dont care i just cant be in this alone\n\n[[div class=\"danke red\"]]\n@@> Save@@\nChanges saved to SCP-5825\nWhat would you like to do?\n@@         @@1.
