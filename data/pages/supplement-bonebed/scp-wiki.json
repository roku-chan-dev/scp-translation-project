Until recently, it was believed that these 37 videos were all that existed -- but several weeks ago, an additional unlisted private video in the channel that was never set to publish was discovered. This 38th video appears to be a direct continuation of the 37th -- as such, abridged transcripts of both follow.\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**DinoVlogs Episode 37**\n\n//[17 minutes and 3 seconds into the 26 minute long video. Ty Rex is awkwardly holding the camera pointed towards himself as he runs.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Alright diplodudes and chickteryx, I think this is it. For those of y'all just joining us, for the past week, me and Penny -- say hi, Penny!\n\n//[Ty Rex tilts the camera to his left, showing a large female spinosaurus keeping pace with him. Upon realizing she is being filmed, she lets out a monstrous screech directly at the camera.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Hah, classic Penny. Yeah, me and Penny, we've been chasing -- that thing!\n\n//[Ty Rex tilts the camera once more, this time directly upward. In the sky, there is what appears to be a second sun: a huge , blinding ball of light high hovering overhead in the distance.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Yeah, on last week's video that thing was //tiny!// And now look at the size of it. It's gotta be a UFO, right? Aliens and shit! Penny, you think it's a UFO?\n\n//[Penny screeches at the camera again, which develops into a hacking cough as she clears her throat.]//\n\n**Penny:** Whoof, yow, sorry. Don't be stupid, Ty, it's not aliens. Aliens aren't real.\n\n**Ty Rex:** Oh yeah? How do you know?\n\n**Penny:** 'Cuz how the heck would they build their UFOs with their claws, numbnuts? God, your brain really is the size of a rock.\n\n**Ty Rex:** Yeah, but like, a really big rock! \n\n**Penny:** Come on, it's getting away!\n\n**Ty Rex:** //[To camera]// Anyway, yeah, we've been going after that thing ever since we saw it. It's been moving and getting bigger and bigger -- I still think it's aliens, and I think they're gonna land and they're gonna take me with-- ow!\n\n//[A loud crunching noise is heard as Ty Rex stumbles forward, losing his footing. He recovers, and casts a look behind him as he continues running away.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Ooh. Uh. Whoops! Sorry lady. Call my agent and we'll get you a new nest! Can't get new eggs though, haha. My bad!\n\n**Penny:** Ty, come on!\n\n**Ty Rex:** Okay, okay, keep your pants off! Alright, so, it's way too far away to get to, but we know a spot around here that's super duper high, like CRAZY high, so you can see as far as you want from it. It's at the top of this like, mountain thing? Yeah, that's where we're going. We're in a hurry though, so I'll keep filming once we get there! Remember to comment what you guys think the thing is!\n\n//[The video cuts out. A few seconds later, it resumes. Ty Rex and Penny are standing on a mountain ledge at least several miles high, overlooking a vast swathe of untamed forest and jungle. The object in the sky is still overhead -- it does not appear to have moved, but is noticeably larger and brighter.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Wazzup guys! Yeah, we finally made it.\n\n**Penny:** Would've gotten here faster if you didn't take that smoke break.\n\n**Ty Rex:** Those velociraptors were delicious after we pushed them into the wildfire and you know it.\n\n**Penny:** Yeah, yeah. Look! You can see it moving now.\n\n//[True to Penny's word, the movement of the object is now visible to the naked eye. Ty Rex squints up at it.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Ugh, this is taking FOREVER! Keep an eye on it, in the meantime, check out this sick crib you guys! This whole mountain is filled with these caves, right? Sometimes I hang out here, you know how it is. So we've fixed it up pretty nice!\n\n//[Ty Rex walks up a side path up the mountain, then turns the camera to face the interior of the cave. It is a narrow, winding passage downhill, and he follows it until he emerges in a secluded cave chamber. A large pile of carcasses and bones are in the center of the room, blood is smeared nearly everywhere, and there is a makeshift 'nest' of straw and leaf fronds. Inexplicably, a neon beer signs hangs above the nest.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** I call it my mantle cave! Hah. Bring chicks, make chicks, eat chicks, rad.\n\n**Penny:** //[Distantly]// Ty! It's getting pretty big and close! Get up here!\n\n**Ty Rex:** Gimme a second! I'm trying to find the drinks. \n\n//[Ty sets the camera down, rummaging in the pile of carcasses.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** I know I left some brewskis around here somewhere...\n\n**Penny:** //[Strangled]// //TY DON-//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Damn, I said gimme a second! It's not the end of the--\n\n//[Suddenly, a deafening boom sounds out, blowing out the audio of the camera. The screen shakes uncontrollably as Ty Rex is thrown forward facefirst into the carcass pile and the cave walls begin to come down. The deafening explosion continues at length as the screen abruptly cuts to blackness.]//\n----\n= **[VIDEO END]**\n\n[[/div]]\n----\nAs mentioned, Episode 37 is the final public-facing video uploaded to the 'DinoVlogs' channel. However, an additional video was recorded and uploaded to the channel, but set to private. While typical episodes are 20-30 minutes in length, Episode 38 is a full two hours and thirty-nine minutes long. Due to its length, an abridged version of the transcript follows:\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**DinoVlogs Episode 38 -- UNPUBLISHED**\n\n////[The episode opens with what appears to be a black screen, but then the camera is fished out of a pile of rubble by Ty Rex. He is still inside the cave -- portions of the walls have collapsed into rubble, but overall, it has held up remarkably well. The only source of illumination is the beer sign.]////\n\n**Ty Rex:** Oh, crap! Wazzup, dudes? I was wondering where my camera went. But yo, it's your boy Ty Rex back at it! I've been trapped in my mantle cave for... man, I don't even know how long. A month? Two months? I've been eating all the carcasses I had stored in the caves. \n\n//[He leans the camera back, showing a stack of licked-clean bones where the huge pile of corpses once was. They are arranged in a pattern reminiscent of a// Jenga //set.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Needed to keep these big muscles juices up, you know? The cave collapsed, so I've been digging out the path, trying to get out. And I finally did it! Just a few more feet of rock, and I wanted to make sure you guys saw my triumphant return to the land of the living! Alright, peep it.\n\n//[Ty Rex carries the camera over to the entrance. A large path has been clawed out of the collapsed rocks and boulders. Ty Rex sets the camera down as he reaches the end, where yet more collapsed rock lies, and begins digging.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** M-man, is it just me or is it c-cold as shit all of a sudden? 'Cuz, it got really hot for a second there, but ever since then it's been g-getting colder and colder. And I can't be getting too cold. I tried c-calling out to Penny when I got stuck, but I guess she didn't hear me. Or maybe the aliens got her! Hahaha.\n\n//[Minutes pass as Ty Rex continues digging. Suddenly, a crack of light appears.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Oh shit! \n\n//[The rest of the wall falls away and Ty Rex steps outside into a cold, desolate landscape. The vibrant jungle below is gone -- it has been burned to a crisp, reduced to nothing more than blackened cinders and ash. The entire world is dark, with thick, black clouds blotting out any sunlight. Ash falls from the sky like so many snowflakes, blanketing the ground in a thick, paper layer of blueish-grey. There is no vegetation, no greenery in sight. The streams and rivers that once dotted the area are now either evaporated or frozen solid. The landscape is hostile, alien, and utterly empty.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Oh my god.... that bitch left without me!\n\n//[He notices the bleached skeletons of several pterodactyls scattered across the mountaintop. He begins to notice the other, countless skeletons littering the ground below, and begins walking unsteadily down the mountainside path.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Holy crap. This is nuts. Where did everybody go?\n\n//[Reaching the mountain ledge, Ty Rex steps forward, hearing a crack underfoot. He looks down.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Dammit, another pteroda- Penny! No!\n\n//[He kneels down for a moment, closing his eyes. Then he gets to his feet, staring at the pile of bones that was once Penny. Then he reaches out and pushes her bones into the adjacent pile of pterodactyl bones, ensuring they are entirely mixed up.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Huehueheu. Bet that won't cause anyone major problems one day.\n\n----\n\n//[Forty-five minutes into the video. Ty Rex has made it down the mountain, and is now walking across the foothills littered with bones. He looks around, calling out as he walks.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Wazzup? Wazzuuuup! WAAZZZZUUUUUPP!\n\n//[There is no response besides his own echo.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** God, my engagement is //so// dead right now.\n\n----\n\n//[An hour and twenty-one minutes into the video. Ty Rex is walking through the flattened landscape, blanketed in a thick layer of ash as more falls from above. It is still extremely cold, and his breath fogs up as he walks. He holds the camera in one hand, panning it across the landscape.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Finally made it off the mountain. That place sucked ass. I've been walking for a while, for a really long while. And I'm really hungry. Hopefully I find a triceratops or something soon. Oh man, I could //really// go for a triceratops right now, man.\n\n//[He continues babbling absentmindedly for several minutes about various species of dinosaur he would like to consume. The camera focuses on something.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Woah!\n\n//[Ty Rex rushes over. It is the charred husk of a tree -- the lack of sunlight has caused its leaves to wither and die. Despite that, it is still holding itself up. The corpse of a sauropod has fallen from the air and crashed directly into the canopy of the tree, hanging there limply. Ty Rex holds the camera up, getting good footage of it.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Hahaha, did you //see// that?! That was insane, man! You good?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** You good?\n\n----\n\n//[Two hours into the video. Ty Rex is walking across a dry, desert plain. It is still exceedingly dark, the only light coming from the occasional isolated sunbeam poking through the dark smog overhead. He mumbles to himself, semi-conscious.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** I've made a severe and continous lapse in my judgement... I apologize, and want--\n\n//[His stomach audibly grumbles, and he stops for a moment looking down at his own emaciated body. Then he realizes the camera is still recording.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Woah! Hey there, dudes. Forgot about you for a second there, haha. Hope you didn't forget about me, though! Yeah, if you're part of the #TyArmy, especially if you're a triceratops or a brachiosaurus or something, lift your head up and give me a big loud //ROAR!// Seriously, do it. Real loud, so I know exactly where to find you. And then maybe like, lay down next to a pool of water or a salad or something.\n\n//[He stops talking, listening for any sounds in the wasteland.]//\n\n----\n\n//[Two hours and thirty-five minutes into the video, near the very end. Ty Rex is still shambling across the ashen landscape. He reaches a small outcropping of rock over a cave, and peers inside.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Mom? Dad?\n\n//[The inside of the small cave is empty save for an unoccupied nest, but is free of ash and offers some comfort from the biting wind outside.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Hm, it's either this or the peat bog outside, which is an anaerobic environment that would preserve my body perfectly, were I to unexpectedly die.\n\n//[He thinks for a moment.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Yeah, let's go in here.\n\n//[Stepping into the small cave, Ty Rex collapses heavily into the unoccupied nest, shaking the ground as he lands. He curls up, wrapping his tail around himself.]//\n\n**Ty Rex:** Yeah, I.... I think I'm gonna take a little nap, #TyArmy. Mom and Dad are probably out getting food. Maybe a nice big 'tops, you know? Some real gourmet stuff. Anyway, I'm gonna hang out here. They'll be so psyched to see me -- oh, I'll do this-- this awesome food review when they bring it back. But, 'til then, I'm just gonna... close my eyes. Keep it real, #TyArmy.\n----\n= **[VIDEO END]**\n\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[span style=\"font-size: 80%\"]]<< Return to main [[[SCP-6556]]] document[[/span]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
