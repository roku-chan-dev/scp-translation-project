It is theorized to have been created before the First Sealing War[[footnote]]Taking place from 3100 BCE to 3000 BCE.[[/footnote]], with thaumic-dating placing its origins at around roughly 6100-5900 BCE. Most likely to be part of a poem, it is one of the oldest examples of Finnfolk language and culture before its shaping by Mitheric influences into the forms we know today. \n\nIf you are not familiar with typical lens of historical poetic analysis, it is advised to first contact Dr. Molly Hussie at Site-212A to check on the date of available workshops, then to read this poem once without footnotes, and again with them for the best experience.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"scenesetter\"]]\n[[span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Grenze Gotisch ; font-size: 1.25rem\"]]Count their arms: I shall give blessings for each\n\nOne stroke of my scales\n\nTwo liftings out of the life-water [[footnote]]Uncertain translation and meaning, word seems to be compounded unusually from “life”, “sea” and “water” in the original text. Possible precursor to modern portmanteaus as seen in English and other Germanic descended languages.[[/footnote]]\n\nThree offerings of seaweed, for a hungry mouth\n\nFour scallop shells to the working limbs, but let the mating arm[[footnote]]Oral traditions throughout Finnfolk history have superstitiously assigned reproductive importance to only a single arm of most starfish species, even though, in actuality, they reproduce with all of them. It is currently unknown how deeply this belief persists in their modern, scientifically rigorous societies.[[/footnote]] rest\n\nAnd five pearls[[footnote]]Five pearls as a cultural symbol seems to be present in most time periods of Finnfolk civilization. Modern iconography posits their significance similar to the romantic connotation of diamond rings in many areas of different human cultures, but it is uncertain if that same meaning is carried within this poem.[[/footnote]] to the sucker feet who number greater than the singing stars\n\nBrighter than the shining moon\n\nThe moon, moon\n\nThis moon, our moon[[footnote]]Fivefold repetition here and in other tercets of this poem suggest intentional anaphora instead of an accidental clustering of words, marking this poetic device as the earliest developed by pre-Mitheric Finnfolk, at least according to records known by the Foundation.[[/footnote]], weeping in our waters \n\nShrouding my tiny thin-armed children.\n\nOh, if only my womb were as numerous\n\nAs the great piles you lay upon!\n\nIf only the clouds above \n\nCould let me swallow you all.\n\nAnd yet, despite my sorrows, I must follow this path \n\nOf these waving ones, throughout their life of stones [[footnote]]Most likely a precursor to the modern Finnfolk phrase “of rocks, like starfish”, roughly translating in meaning to “these two objects are closely related to each other in some manner, usually by virtue of physical characteristics”, similar to the English idiom “like father, like son”. It is currently unknown why this connotation developed; the most likely explanation is the hard, calcified remains of dead starfish being likened to stones.[[/footnote]]\n\nFollowing where the waves shatter them\n\nAll of their bodies, as the shore-water smooths.\n\nWhere will you go when you die?\n\nWill you go where the sharks do?\n\nThe great many colorful fish? \n\nHow I wish I knew, knew, knew\n\nKnew the little life-names[[footnote]]Uncertain translation. Literal translation is “life carvings”—“carvings” was translated to “names” due to context clues and greater poetic impact. [[/footnote]] of each of you[[footnote]]Rhyming does not occur in the original translation; Finnfolk poetry did not express this trait until several decades after the First Sealing War’s end.[[/footnote]]\n\nKnew how many kin in your great squirming reefs.\n\nI wish I was as numerous as sand on the ocean floor\n\nAs numerous as hagfish[[footnote]]Literal translation: “fish which coughs slime”.[[/footnote]] to a whale’s carcass\n\nCarcass, carcass, you all rush to the carcass\n\nOne carcass of yours I shall forever hold to my breast.\n\nInfinite and eternal, your five arms waving\n\nArms, arms, arms\n\nMay your arms guide my wandering\n\nInto the great abyss\n\nBeneath these wet underskies[[footnote]]Uncertain meaning; literal translation is “second sea beneath us”. Most likely referring to the regular sky, but could also have greater theistic connotations. Currently, little is concretely known about whether pre-Mitheric Finnfolk believed in any kind of afterlife/higher plane of existence, or if their naturalistic beliefs lended themselves to believing that nature as it appeared to them existed instead as cycles of reincarnation and rebirth.[[/footnote]] \n\nThat we call home[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=xexnoncores]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
