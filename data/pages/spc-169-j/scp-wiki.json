As such, Project Ahab has been established for the full-scale pugilization of SPC-169. \n\nProject Ahab consists of simultaneous Dreadnought-class punchery from five separate sources in the southern Atlantic Ocean:\n\n# **Ahab-1 \"Fist of Neptune\":** 50 satellites currently located in stationary orbit over critical points of SPC-169's anatomy. These satellites are capable of releasing 100kg tungsten-osmium sculptures of fists into Earth's atmosphere, which will use the natural acceleration of Earth's gravity to punch SPC-169 at terminal velocity.\n# **Ahab-2 \"Fist of Triton\":** Ten volleys of 20 intercontinental ballistic missiles modified for shark-punching purposes with Kaiju-grade Doomfist tips.\n# **Ahab-3 \"Fist of Calypso\":** Two-stage operation in which Megara-277EA92R (a van-sized asteroid in an L4 orbit around the Earth) is 1. implanted with several boxing gloves, and 2. magnetized directly onto SPC-169.\n# **Ahab-4 \"Fist of Cthulhu\":** 500 modified drilling rigs will be installed on the exterior of SPC-169 for the purpose of applying continuous punching action over the course of several years.\n# **Ahab-5 \"Fist of Nemo\":** [DATA EXPUNGED] will be trained in bareknuckle boxing techniques and summoned to challenge SPC-169 to fisticuffs.\n\n**Description:** SPC-169 is the largest shark ever encountered by the Shark Punching Center, believed to be between 2,000 and 8,000 km in length. Radar analysis has detected a hardened outer carapace, indications of a state of dormancy, and, unfortunately, a complete lack of exterior indications of punching. SPC-169 is believed to have existed since the Pre-Cambrian era. Due to the ethical ramifications of a shark having remained unpunched for that long, Project Ahab is to be executed as soon as possible.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Shark Identification Discrepancies:**\n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, we have reason to believe that SPC-169 is not a shark.\n> \n> **Administrator:** Explain.\n> \n> **Dr. Swayze:** SPC-169 has an exoskeleton, as well as multiple sets of limbs and feelers. In truth, I believe SPC-169 is a very large arthropod.\n> \n> **Administrator:** Interesting. Tell me, is SPC-169 located in the ocean?\n> \n> **Dr. Swayze:** Yes.\n> \n> **Administrator:** Is it larger than a dolphin?\n> \n> **Dr. Swayze:** [Audible sigh] Yes.\n> \n> **Administrator:** Does it have lots of pointy parts that could potentially be dangerous? Then it's a shark! This is entry-level sharkspotting; you really should know better at this point.\n> \n> **Dr. Swayze:** Sir, with all due respect: by that logic, sperm whales, orcas, and narwhals could also be called \"sharks\".\n> \n> **Administrator:** ...oh God, no.\n> \n> <End Log>\n\nFollowing this meeting, an emergency initiative was established for the investigation and immediate punching of SPC-170 (\"Moby Dick Sharks\"), SPC-171 (\"Free Willy Sharks\"), and [[[spc-172-j|SPC-172 (\"Sword Sharks?!\")]]].\n\n**Addendum 2 - Ethics Committee Review:**\n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Dr. Balboa:** We've been going over the agenda for Project Ahab, and I think we need to step up the lethality.\n> \n> **Administrator:** On what grounds?\n> \n> **Dr. Balboa:** If we were to punch this... shark, and we did not kill it, I'm fairly certain its enraged awakening would potentially cause irreversible damage to human civilization.\n> \n> **Administrator:** But would it be punched?\n> \n> **Dr. Balboa:** The human race would go extinct, but yes, SPC-169 would be punched.\n> \n> **Administrator:** Look, whatever the fine print says, our job is done once the fist is in the shark's bitch face. Forgive me if I fail to see how the most punchable shark in our organization's history is generating so much nitpicking.\n> \n> <End Log>\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** ahab2.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user daveyoufool]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** saturnv-3_0.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://nasa.gov/for-kids-and-students/what-was-the-saturn-v-grades-5-8 NASA.gov]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
