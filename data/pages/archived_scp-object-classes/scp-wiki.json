Safe designates may have individual containment procedures, but these procedures are not expected to fail frequently, or be subject to later revision as more information is obtained about a subject.\n\nSome Safe designates are human, humanoid, and/or sentient. To prevent injury and/or death to personnel and SCPs, interaction with such designates should be professional and courteous, taking into account special containment procedures.\n\nIt should be noted that Safe does not indicate that the containment procedures are unnecessary. Many Safe-designated objects can be quite dangerous in the right contexts. The important distinction that defines a Safe object is that it can be handled safely with appropriate containment procedures. An example of a Safe object would be a gun, a nuclear weapon, or polonium.\n\nThe following is a list of the twenty-five highest rated Safe articles on the site:\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" tags=\"safe,-joke,-archived,-decommissioned\" order=\"rating desc\" perPage=\"25\" limit=\"25\" separate=\"no\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\nFor a complete list of the Safe articles on the site, click [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/safe | here.]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Euclid]]\nAn SCP object is classified as Euclid when its behavior cannot be unerringly predicted, either because the item is sentient, it behaves outside of current scientific knowledge, or its nature is simply poorly understood at present. Euclid-class objects do not pose the same existential threat to humanity due to containment breach that Keter-class objects do, but they still generally require more diligence to keep contained than Safe-class objects. \n\nAlthough many Euclid-class objects could be used for the benefit of the Foundation or of humanity, they may have unforeseen ramifications after their use due to their unpredictable nature. Some Euclid-class SCPs are eventually understood well enough to be reclassified as Safe, but most remain inscrutable even to the most rigorous of experimentation.\n\nThe following is a list of the twenty-five highest rated Euclid articles on the site:\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" tags=\"euclid,-joke,-archived,-decommissioned, -keter\" order=\"rating desc\" perPage=\"25\" limit=\"25\" separate=\"no\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\nFor a complete list of the Euclid articles on the site, click [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/euclid | here.]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Keter]]\nThe designation \"Keter\" is assigned to subjects that both (a) display vigorous, active hostility to human life, civilization, and/or spacetime, and (b) are capable of causing significant destruction in the event of a containment breach. Such subjects must be cataloged, contained according to special containment procedures, and destroyed, if possible.\n\nMerely being inimical to human life is not in itself cause for classification as a Keter-level object. A Keter classification indicates that not only is this subject capable of inflicting devastating harm to human life and civilization, but that containment protocols must be extensive, involved, and precisely followed in order to prevent it from doing so. Research into the neutralization of Keter-class SCPs is always a top priority for the Foundation. \n\nCases where Keter-class objects that can be neutralized by Foundation personnel persist in Foundation custody are rare, and are grouped into three main categories. In addition to cases where destruction of the object continues to be unfeasible due to apparent invulnerability or similar circumstance, there are some Keter-class objects with significant tactical value for the Foundation, as well as Keter-class objects that threaten more harm to humanity from their neutralization than from their continued existence.\n\nThe Foundation has harnessed some Keter-class SCPs, but such situations are rare exceptions: for example, [[[SCP-076|SCP-076-2]]] only agreed to work with the Foundation due to its unusual relationship with Agent [REDACTED] and its ability to communicate with us, and even that [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076-2-splash didn't last]. The majority of Keter-class SCPs are insentient, and most are inanimate objects. This status may change as research and discovery continues.\n\n\"Keter\" means \"crown\" in Hebrew and is the uppermost level of the Sephirot in Jewish Kabbalah.\n\nThe following is a list of the twenty-five highest rated Keter articles on the site:\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" tags=\"-euclid,-joke,-archived,-decommissioned, keter\" order=\"rating desc\" perPage=\"25\" limit=\"25\" separate=\"no\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\nFor a complete list of the Keter articles on the site, click [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/keter | here.]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Anomalous/Neutralized/Decommissioned]]\n\n**Anomalous:** Any object that has been appraised by the Foundation as not meriting further study or special containment. Some of these objects may be catalogued in the [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]]. Note: No object with an SCP designation is categorized as Anomalous, but some SCP objects were //once// categorized as Anomalous before being assigned an SCP designation.\n\n**Neutralized:** Any object that has since been destroyed, or in some way has no odd, extra-dimensional, or adverse effects. Objects classified under this class should have a note stating what class it was while it was an active SCP. The list of Neutralized SCPs can be found on the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/neutralized#pages| Neutralized]]] page.\n\nTop 10 Neutralized articles:\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" tags=\"neutralized -safe,-joke,-archived,-decommissioned\" order=\"rating desc\" perPage=\"10\" limit=\"10\" separate=\"no\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n**Decommissioned:** Reserved for objects that are not only destroyed, but disavowed by the Foundation. The list of decommissioned SCPs can be found on the [[[archived:decommissioned-scps | Decommissioned SCPs]]] page.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]",
