Not now, at least.\n\nI had a plan.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/when-god-wept | Death taught me what the “end” of someone looks like]]], and I would make sure that when Azrael came to claim my soul, I would have something to carry my heritage. Someone that can be seen and heard; someone that is loved and loves.\n\nBut I could not just manifest a perfect person into existence like that. Not that I am incapable—but rather how unnatural it would be.\n\nI would create that person from the womb of a virgin and watch with my cosmic eye as he grows exactly how I would want him to be.\n\nTo start that, I had to go somewhere. Somewhere that is grand and complex, a house of infinite information and books.\n\nWanderer's Library.\n\nWhen I first put my foot in there, I was greeted with… absence.\n\nHm? Wasn't this place supposed to be full of readers? I guess even a cosmic library closes during the weekend.\n\nShrugging it aside, I moved forward, going between the unfathomably large shelves. I was staring at them while walking; a side of me wanted to reach out and pick up a book from one of them.\n\nI looked at my left, right, back, and front, and any other direction that exists beyond the 3rd spatial dimension. Nobody was here but me.\n\nI reached out to grab a book, but as soon as my hand came close, the book suddenly withered away in an instant before I could even touch it. I retracted my hand and looked at it for a few seconds. Why did that happen?\n\nStrange, I guess I would have to find someone else to do it for me. But who?\n\nI continued to move forward until I reached an open area; there was a relatively big table with chairs surrounding it.\n\nA place for readers to collect and read together. How cute.\n\nBut one thing I realized: the books were left on the table; some of them were still open, even. As far as my knowledge about this library was concerned, leaving books unreturned to their place is against the rules. That giant snake—I believe they call him “Serpent,” that giant snake's “Hand”—can come and kick you out for violating it.\n\nAn emergency evacuation, perhaps? But why? Hm, I would figure that one out later.\n\nSpeaking of that snake and the absence of people, I figured I would ask him for help instead. But then the question would be where to find him?\n\nShelves after shelves, sections after sections, floors after floors, and wings after wings, I practically went in and out of this infinity and danced around it.\n\nPerhaps that snake was hiding?\n\nCome on now, I'm not //that// scary. Maybe.\n\nBut then, I finally found it. A door that wasn't there before. Two giant gate doors.\n\nI approached it, and as soon as I came close, the doors opened by themselves. They were… annoyingly slow and loud.\n\nI stepped in; the first thing I noticed was the ground lightly glowing in bright pink, but not enough to be bothersome. I fixed my gaze on my front; I saw a white-colored, semi-transparent visual display of the Tree of Knowledge.\n\nThe giant snake's body was wrapped around the tree, and his head was at the top of it. He hissed at my presence.\n\n“Greetings.” I said. “Looks like I came here at the wrong time.”\n\n”Not exactly,” he replied. ”I was expecting you. Gabriel warned me about you.”\n\nWarned?\n\n”Hah, it's not an archangel if it doesn't poke its nose into things.” I joked.\n\n”Leave the library, Lucifer.” He commanded, direct and harsh.\n\n”Excuse you, sir. You wouldn't see a customer as dedicated as me.”\n\n”That's exactly //not// what I want. Your mere presence is a danger to the library and the tree. Leave.”\n\nThat was a clue, at least. So that's why everyone seemingly launched themselves out of here.\n\n”Come on, I'm pretty, pretty sure I'm not that scary.” I joked again.\n\n”You are the absence of information, the opposite of the library. If you come into contact with information, you erase it.”\n\nHmm, so that's why that book withered like that.\n\nAnd... why I can't interact with people...\n\n”That's more or less why I am here, Mr. Serpent. I need you to alter the book related to my universe.”\n\nHe hissed again. ”Altering the books is forbidden, even for me.”\n\n”Tell God that it was me if he gets angry at you.”\n\n”This is not a laughing matter, Lucifer. Leave, or I will have to make you.”\n\n”Haha,” I paused. ”You can't.” I added, voice suddenly serious and annoyed.\n\n”I ask you for a simple task, and you rebel like a child. You are making us waste both of our times.” I slowly tilted my head. ”If I like, I can make this tree and all the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4555 | multiverses]]] attached to its branches your grave.”\n\n”Punishment would be severe if you do.” The Serpent replied, not threatened even one bit. ”You already broke one of the universal laws after creating that golden watch. Azrael was mad that you sabotaged his job.”\n\n”Of course someone who is incapable of dying would complain about not being able to kill people, and all of you label me the evil one in the scriptures.” I said sarcastically, my tone still serious.\n\n”Get this, Snake. I do not care what God commanded or how he will 'punish' me; I am already stripped away from the only thing that kept me alive after countless years of being stuck in hell, and if I need to bury all the archangels into a single coffin alongside you, then I won't hesitate to do so.”\n\nI stepped back, letting myself cool down; that wasn't very godly of me.\n\n”Just make this easy for me.” I said, in a calmer tone.\n\n”Fine, I will fulfill your request. But if I get kicked out of Eden again, I promise I will haunt you in your dreams. I am already on bad terms with God about this.”\n\nThat got a chuckle out of me.\n\n”Thanks. Here is the request: There is a yet-to-be-born individual named '[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-be-me |Alan]]].' I want you to change his fate with the book. Make him live… a miserable life. Soon, he will become one of us. I will take great care of him from the shadows.”\n\n”I didn't expect anything less.”\n\n”Also, give me a white cat while you're at it.”\n\n”...Sure...”\n\nI turned around and headed back to the gate doors. My footsteps were completely silent; a man-shaped hole cannot produce actual sound. I was and am a non-being.\n\n\"Oh,\" I abruptly paused and turned my head. \"And here is a reward for your cooperation.\"\n\nI opened my palm, created a half-bitten apple, and hurled it in front of the Serpent.\n\nAdam's Apple.\n\nWhen he raised his head to look at me, I had already left.\n\n\"Prick.\" He said annoyingly in a whisper.\n\n-----\n\nTo his surprise, I would stay at the library for some time. As the Serpent stated, I am the absence of information. I had no past or future; I only existed in the present moment, so he had no way of knowing if I had actually departed.\n\nIn a dark form of irony, the bestower of knowledge lacked knowledge.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-place-called-nowhere | I would wait for an individual for a deal]]].\n\nA Nobody I did not create, but indirectly created the one that did.\n\nThe plan was, and will be, forever perfect.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[One To Another]]]**\n[[/=]]",
