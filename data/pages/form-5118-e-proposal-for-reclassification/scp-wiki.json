The meeting was recorded via visual and audio devices for posterity. \n\n**Attendees:** Dr. Williams (Site-65 Director), Dr. Atmos (Regional Director), Dr. Laicux (Regional Containment Specialist).\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Meeting Log - Part A\" hide=\"Hide Meeting Log\"]]\n\n//The group enters the room and sits at a round table. Dr. Atmos and Dr. Laicux shuffle through several papers while Dr. Williams places a briefcase on the floor beside his chair.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Let's see here... Ah, here we go.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** All good?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, yes. Let's begin. Dr. Williams, we're gathering today to discuss your proposal.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Alright.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** As you probably suspected, we've already reviewed the request prior to this meeting. It's very uncommon for an anomaly - a reality bender, nonetheless - to be reclassified as neutralized. \n\n**Dr. Williams:** I am well aware of that and stand by my proposal. There are many ongoing projects that could use the resources we currently have allocated to SCP-5118.\n\n//Dr. Laicux straightens his stack of papers on the table.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Laicux?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Dr. Williams... To what degree are you confident that the subject currently in containment is the same subject encountered by the task force?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Are you suggesting it swapped places with a dog?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** No, I'm asking about how confident you are that it didn't.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** I'm certain, without a doubt. \n\n//Dr. Williams lifts his briefcase on to the table and taps its side.//\n\n**Dr. Williams:** May I?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Please do.\n\n//Dr. Williams opens the briefcase and removes an SD card. He walks to the other side of the room towards a small SD card reader connected to a projection screen and inserts it.//\n\n**Dr. Williams:** If I may direct your attention to the following moments of the footage...\n\n//Dr. Williams fast forwards through the video for a while before pausing it.//\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** What exactly are we looking at here?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** One of the frames from MTF-Alpha's camera. The others show it too but this angle is the clearest.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Show what?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Take a look in the corner of the frame. Do you see it? A dog's foot... human's leg.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** I see. So, the actual metamorphosis was caught on film. I suppose that reasonably rules out the possibility of a different subject.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams, can you please rewind the footage to the moments before the metamorphosis?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Uh-huh, sure.\n\n//Dr. Williams proceeds to rewind the video again.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Right there, stop!\n\n//Dr. Williams quickly hits the pause button.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** This is the subject in frame?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Yes, that's correct.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Is it... smiling?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Hm. It does kind of look like it. Almost like a smirk.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** It's probably distortion from the camera movement. It could even just be that it was breathing through its mouth during the pursuit and it happened to look like a smile on video.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, that is a possibility. Can you skip through the surrounding frames a bit?\n\n//Dr. Williams skips through the previous and upcoming seconds of the video frame-by-frame.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** The subject's face is only visible in the first frame?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** On this tape, yes. There were two other members on the team who also had cameras.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** I see. We're going to take a short recess then, during which Dr. Williams will retrieve the footage of MTF-Beta and MTF-Gamma.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Uh... Okay, sure.\n\n//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//\n\n------\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** So?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** I'm not sure.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Same here.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Everything so far points to-\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** I know.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Meeting Log - Part B\" hide=\"Hide Meeting Log\"]]\n\n//Dr. Williams returns to the room holding another briefcase.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Any issues?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Nope, I've got them right here.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Perfect. Please play MTF-Beta's camera footage.\n\n//Dr. Williams removes the previous SD card from the machine and inserts another one from the second briefcase before skipping through the video.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Right there, I think this is the same moment.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Yeah, it's still hard to tell, though.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** I really don't think it's a smile.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** What about Gamma's angle?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Right here.\n\n//Dr. Williams swaps the SD card for another one. He fast forwards the video to the same point.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** You can't really see the subject's face in this one.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Unfortunately not, too bad. Are there any photos of the subject on file?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Just the post-containment one we took for its document. \n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Hmm... Any missing person reports for the area?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** None at all. \n\n**Dr. Laicux:** That's odd to say the least... Previous containment of humanoids have almost always been followed-up on by addressing a missing persons report.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Indeed.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Without a doubt, it lived alone. If there's no missing persons report, it might not be in contact with its family. Bet that makes post-containment follow-up a bit easier, huh?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** If only it worked that way, Dr. Williams.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Can you please rewind the video to the first moment the task force made visual contact with the subject?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** No problem.\n\n//Dr. Williams rewinds the footage as requested.//\n\n**Dr. Williams:** There?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Yes, that's fine. Please play it.\n\n//Dr. Williams plays the video. SCP-5118 is sitting on a bench as described in its article.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams, do you notice anything significant about the following scene?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Yeah, definitely. It's sitting out in the open. Normally, a reality bender would try to hide its abilities upon discovering them, but this one just wandered into a busy public park and couldn't care less who saw it.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** I see. And what was the name of this park?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Hyde Park. Some off-leash dog park in the middle of the city.\n\n//Dr. Atmos and Dr. Laicux do not respond, scribbling intently on their notepads.//\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Is everything alright?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Everything is fine, Dr. Williams. I think we're going to take another recess now.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Already? But it's only been-\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** We'll resume in 10 minutes. Please leave the room.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Er... Alright...\n\n//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//\n\n------\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** It definitely looked like a smile, but we can't rule out the possibility that it wasn't.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** True, but we can use other evidence from the video to support that...\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** What do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Look at the video...\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** I mean, yeah, it makes sense that it'd be in a dog park of all places.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** That's actually not what I was referring to...\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** What is it, then?\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Meeting Log - Part C\" hide=\"Hide Meeting Log\"]]\n\n//Dr. Williams re-enters the room.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Ah, Dr. Williams. Shall we continue?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** That's what I've been wanting to do...\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Great. Please have a seat, then. I wanted to ask you a few more things.\n\n//Dr. Williams sits back down in his seat.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Now, the snacks that SCP-5118 was seen eating...\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Mhm?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Did anything significant stand out about the subject's choice of snacks?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** What? No... \n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Atmos. On that topic, I wanted to ask you if SCP-5118 has ever requested these snacks while in containment?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** It's a dog... It can't talk...\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Very well.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Let's continue through the video, then.\n\n//Dr. Williams stands from his chair to hit the play button. The video shows SCP-5118 eating snacks, breaking attention from its snacks only temporarily when a dog walking by with its owner barks at it.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Interesting.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** What? Without a doubt, it's just eating junk food.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Dr. Williams... I'd like to move onto the topic of the subject's current containment.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Of course. Standard canine containment, as per policy.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Yes, yes, I can see that from the document. I'm more curious as to the subject's mood surrounding current containment procedures.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Um, happy I guess? It gets three meals a day and new toys, so why wouldn't it be? \n\n**Dr. Laicux:** And does the subject interact with its assigned staff?\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Yeah. Whenever they go into the chamber to give it food or replace the toy, it jumps up on them all playfully. Some of the staff even started calling it \"Goldie\" since it's a Golden Retriever. Creative, I know. I'm still writing up the disciplinary reports for those staff, but it seems to like the name... Saying it gets its attention.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** I see. Dr. Williams, I think we can conclude this meeting. Dr. Laicux and I have to discuss a few things before moving forward with a decision. \n\n**Dr. Williams:** Alright. Now what?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Please return to your office. We'll page you to return once we've made a decision.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Will do. Thanks.\n\n//Dr. Williams leaves the room.//\n\n------\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** That was short.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Yeah, but I'd already made my decision during the last recess.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** You did? What did you see?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Dr. Williams came back in before I could show you. Here, screenshot this frame of the video and send it to my drive. I'll be right back.\n\n//Dr. Atmos leaves the room while Dr. Laicux does as requested. Around 5 minutes later, Dr. Atmos returns to the room holding a piece of paper.//\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** What's that?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Take a look. I had to zoom in and crop it, but it's pretty legible if you ask me.\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** No way...\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** So you've come to a decision as well, then?\n\n**Dr. Laicux:** Without a doubt.\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Now you're sounding like Dr. Williams. I'll page him back in.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Meeting Log - Final Decision\" hide=\"Hide Meeting Log\"]]\n\n//Dr. Williams enter the room again.//\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Hello, Dr. Williams. We've come to a decision on your proposal.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** Fantastic, and?\n\n**Dr. Atmos:** Your proposal for reclassification has been denied.\n\n**Dr. Williams:** What? That's preposterous! What's the reason?\n\n//Dr. Atmos reveals the piece of paper he had shown Dr. Laicux.//\n\n> [[=]]\n> + MISSING DOG\n> \n> ------\n>\n> [[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Happy-afternoon-golden-retriever-yoko_%2824326853815%29.jpg]]\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **$250 Reward**\n> Last spotted on September 16th near Hyde Park\n> Very friendly and playful, loves to play chase\n> Responds to \"Goldie\"\n>  \n> ------\n> \n> **If found, please call 306-555-4417**\n> Please help us find our baby\n> [[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[*http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deathbygin More from this author...]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n@@@@ @@@@",
