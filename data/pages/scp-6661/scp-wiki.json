If popularity declines, the think tank is to evaluate the best course of action. SCP-6661-2 based memetic agents are to be spread throughout the internet and social media sites as well as Foundation intranet.\n\nFoundation web crawlers are to scan the internet for SCP-6661-1 instances and look out for any active SCP-6661-1 events. The final instructions of the SCP-6661-1 are to be redacted whenever possible.\n\nPersonnel directly dealing with SCP-6661-1 are to be memetically inoculated prior to being assigned to the object.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6661 is a phenomenon surrounding a particular internet meme[[footnote]] An image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations. [[/footnote]]. SCP-6661-1 is an internet meme commonly known as Trollge. This meme spawned as a variant of the Trollface meme.\n\nThe meme starts out similarly to how a Trollface comic plays out, with the main character, Trollface[[footnote]]A character wearing a mischievous smile, used to symbolize internet trolls and internet trolling. [[/footnote]], providing instructions to carry out a prank. What distinguishes SCP-6661-1 from a regular Trollface meme is that the prank instructions begin devolving into more macabre instructions with each panel. These steps culminate in an atrocity or sinister event occurring.\n\nThe final step of each comic seems to be a cognitohazardous switch that makes a reader carry out the act displayed in the comic. It is estimated that 0.25% of those exposed to SCP-6661-1 are susceptible to its anomalous effects. It is currently unknown on what basis readers are chosen to carry out the skits.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nNOTABLE INCIDENTS\n[[collapsible show=\"+ December 2020 \"Pretty Girl\" Incident \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nWant to get back your girlfriend?\n\nStep 1: Find out her favourite facial cream.\n\nStep 2: Procure the facial cream.\n\nStep 3: Obtain urticant plant (Use gloves)\n\nStep 4: Blend the leaves with the cream, then repack it,\n\nStep 5: Give girlfriend the gift.\n\nStep 6: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n24/12/2020,\nMelbourne, Australia:\n\nCollege student, Leah Miller was hospitalised after applying a facial cream spiked with gympie-gympie (Dendrocnide moroides). The victim had crudely enucleated herself and had attempted to remove her face before being restrained by paramedics.

Hospital orderly Aziz Hidayat was identified as the perpetrator after he was caught replacing oxygen tanks with carbon monoxide tanks. During the interrogation, he was recorded calmly stating that he was \"delivering them\". He has not stated who the recipient was.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ January 2021 \"Harvester Valley\" Incident \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nWant to have a good holiday?\n\nStep 1: Pack necessary equipment and items\n\nStep 2: Say goodbye to family.\n\nStep 3: Drive to the valley campgrounds.\n\nStep 4: Find local shepherd and his flock.\n\nStep 5: Steal a little lamb.\n\nStep 6: Relish upon its flesh for it will be your last meal.\n\nStep 7: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n20/1/2021,\nAlberta, Canada:\n\nOliver Desjardins entered a local tourist campground and opened fire upon the campers, killing 10 and injuring 14. He was subsequently shot dead by an Emergency Response Team (RCMP) sniper. He had illegally obtained the semiautomatic rifle and handgun.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ February 2021 \"Ascension\" Incident \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nOil is lighter than water.\n\nStep 1: Cover yourself in oil\n\nStep 2: Feels good.\n\nStep 3: Cover others in oil.\n\nStep 4: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n16/2/2021,\nBratislava, Slovakia:\n\nAt 0200, Jozef Procházka began spraying kerosene onto nearby buildings in his neighbourhood with his water truck. When emergency services were called to the scene, Procházka stood in front of the active nozzle and ignited a road flare. 26 people including Procházka were killed, and property damage was in the hundreds of thousands. \n\nReports of floating corpses and objects occurred when it began raining at the site.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ February 2021 \"Red Master\" Incident \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[REDACTED]\n\n23/2/2021,\nBray, Ireland:\n\nBrother Brendan O'Brien is still at large.\nMTF Chi-13 \"Choir Boys\" were deployed to the site. Defensive perimeter has been set up. Amnesticisation of the population is underway. [[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 1:** Foundation webcrawlers detected an SCP-6661-1 instance with the final step being heavily distorted. Before carrying out the necessary expungement, Junior Researcher Michael Ramirez edited out the distortion and scanned the image through a spectrogram generator without authorisation. The following phrase was recorded:\n\n[[image Trollge%20Initial%20Voice%20Contact%202.PNG size=\"medium\"]]\n\nAudio generated by the spectogram:\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n| type=audio\n| url=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6661/d2405797-94a0-4190-a1b2-a34075343938.wav]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**TRANSCRIPT:**\n------\n**You...see...me?**\n------\n[[/div]]\n\nDespite the breach of protocol, Junior Researcher Ramirez's actions provided valuable insight into the anomaly. With permission from the O5, a spectrogram was constructed with a reply to the question and spread through the internet. Within 24 hours, another SCP-6661-1 instance with the distortion was detected and isolated.\n\nThe following is a record of the messages:\n\n------\n[[<image Foundation%20Reply.PNG size=\"medium\"]]\nFoundation made spectrogram:\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n| type=audio\n| url=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6661/untitled.mpeg]]\n\n[[<image Trollge%20Response%202.PNG size=\"medium\"]]\nSCP-6661 response:\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n| type=audio\n| url=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6661/5efe3043-73fa-4c15-95ec-86213f59c1b2.wav]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n----\n\n**5/3/2021:** Yes, we see you. Who are you? And why are you doing this?\n\n\n**6/3/2021:** People...make...me...People...bored...People...forget...You...mad?... I...am...mad...I...be...weaker...People...now...like...darkness...Adaptation...Embrace...shadow...Chaos...reigns...I...exist...People...see me...I...thrive.\n\n-----\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nIt is theorised that the collective popularity of the Trollface meme created a thoughtform which manifests via the meme. SCP-6661-1 came into existence due to the decline in popularity of the Trollface meme. The irrelevance caused the thoughtform to latch onto the darker SCP-6661-1 to garner back attention.\n\nTherefore, it has been hypothesised that if Trollface became popular again, then the effects of SCP-6661-1 would subside.\n\n**Addendum 2:** The percentage of susceptible individuals has been steadily increasing.\nThe order has been given to carry out the experiment.\n \n**Addendum 3:** A think tank of researchers, sociologists, and statisticians is to be assembled to design visual images and media involving Trollface, now designated SCP-6661-2. SCP-6661-2 is then to be disseminated across and within the Foundation intranet as a test. The aim is to saturate media with the memetic agent to the point it achieves popularity due to its overuse.[[footnote]] When a memetic agent has reached this point, it is colloquially dubbed in mundane circles as \"Dank\". [[/footnote]]\n\nThe think tank has been designated Task Force Hexa-9 \"Meme Machine\".\n\n**Addendum 4:** Incidents involving SCP-6661-1 have slightly reduced. Authorisation by the O5 council to disseminate SCP-6661-2 across the internet has been given.\n\n**Addendum 5:** Due to the increased popularity of SCP-6661-2 memes, SCP-6661-1 instances have decreased to more controllable numbers to allow for standard containment procedures.[[footnote]] Amnesticisation, information suppression, etc.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum 6: 19/9/2021** An unknown SCP-6661-2 instance was detected in Hexa-9's database. The instance is currently being scanned for possible cognitohazards and is currently omitted until deemed safe.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SHOW SCP-6661-2-919 \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[=image Trollface%20King%20Redacted.PNG size=\"medium\"]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6660]]] | SCP-6661 | [[[SCP-6662]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
