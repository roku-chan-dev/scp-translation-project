Following neutralization, the plot of land should be rendered incapable of supporting flora via the application of specialized herbicide PQ4608. \n\nDue to the circumstance of SCP-4608's recovery, no further containment procedures were developed. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5 \n|speed=250 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=200px \n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4608/one.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Artistic depiction of John Chapman, created in 1860.\n]]\n\n**Description:**  SCP-4608 was a 60-acre apple orchard containing over 22,000 trees, located on the outskirts of Milan, Indiana. Engraved on approximately 75% of trees within SCP-4608 were thaumaturgic sigils and symbols relating to occult [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4677 Norse religions.]\n>\nRecords indicate SCP-4608 was sown in 1826 by John Chapman,[[footnote]]An American pioneer commonly known as Johnny Appleseed.[[/footnote]] who maintained it until his death in 1845. John Chapman's obituary indicated he was the sole priest of the Allen County Church of Iðunn,[[footnote]]In Norse mythology, Iðunn is the goddess associated with apples and youth.[[/footnote]] though no records of a chapel or congregation exist. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5 \n|speed=250 \n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=200px \n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4608/two.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Photograph of a SCP-4608-1 instance, circa 1947\n]]\n\nDue to the circumstance of their discovery, little is known about SCP-4608-1 and SCP-4608-2. All information has been gathered from the first-hand accounts of MSF Agents and the response transcripts.\n>\n SCP-4608-1 were organisms consisting of unidentified plant-like muscular structures and a periderm resembling those found on common hardwoods. Instances ranged in height from 5 cm to 3 m and were capable of locomotion. Instances of SCP-4608-1 were highly aggressive, displaying territorial and predatory behavior. \n>\nSCP-4608-2 was a large apple tree with 13 human faces imbedded in its periderm. These faces were capable of speech, though the language used is currently unidentified. SCP-4608-2 was found at the center of SCP-4608 and was hostile, using its roots as a means of manipulation. \n>\n**Discovery:** A local logging company had purchased the land on which SCP-4608 was located. During the first logging expedition within SCP-4608, a member of the crew died as a result of a safety equipment malfunction. Shortly after, all remaining crew members were declared dead or missing; the search party was also presumed missing. On October 14, 1947, the Foundation was alerted to the occurrences surrounding SCP-4608 by police reports accompanied by a photograph of an SCP-4608-1 instance. A week later Site-81 sent a three-man investigation team. All three agents were presumed dead after four days without contact.\n>\nFollowing the loss of communication with the investigation team,  Site-81 dispatched a high-risk response team, Mobile Strike Force Bravo-7 (\"Hometown Heroes\"), to handle the situation.\n>\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n**Response Log Transcripts**\n\n**Date:** 10/15/1947\n\n**Response Team:** MSF Bravo-7\n\n**Subject:** 3 Squads of MSF Bravo-7 responding to SCP-4608 - Milan, Indiana.\n-----\n**__ALPHA Squad:__**\n-----\n**Squad Lead:** ALPHA-1 \"Cap\" \n**Squad Members:** ALPHA-4 \"Square\", ALPHA-5 \"Fives\", ALPHA-7 \"Sev\"\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[Camera pans to a small clearing of recently cut trees.]//\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Alright. BETA Squad, you're heading east. GAMMA Squad, you're going west. Radio me in 30 minutes if you haven't found anything.\n\n**BETA-1:** Got it, Cap. Switching channels.\n\n**GAMMA-1:** Roger that. Move out boys, you heard the man. Switching-\n\n**ALPHA-1:** ALPHA Squad on me. We're scoping out the incident site-- then we're movin' south.\n\n**ALPHA-4:** The equipment is set up just over there. Probably a good place to start, Cap.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Well, no point in wasting time. Let's get this shit over with.\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Let's. This place gives me the creeps.\n\n//[ALPHA Squad begins approaching the logging equipment; several bodies can be seen.]// \n\n**ALPHA-5:** Christ, they didn't even clean this shit up.\n\n**ALPHA-4:** Cap, come take a look at this. \n\n//[ALPHA-1 approaches ALPHA-4, who is crouched in front of mutilated human remains. The chest cavity has been ripped open and filled with apples.]//\n\n**ALPHA-4:** What the fuck would do--\n\n//[A loud shriek can be heard over all radios. The camera pans to the tree line.]// \n\n**ALPHA-1:** Roll call, squad leads.\n\n**BETA-1:** Wasn't near us, Cap, but we heard it too.\n\n**GAMMA-1:** Came from the south-west. En route now. We are definitely not alone out here.\n\n**BETA-1:** Agreed. It's shy, whatever it is. Caught a glimpse, though; it's...fast.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Check back in 15. \n\n//[ALPHA-1 begins walking away from the logging equipment towards the tree line.]//\n\n**ALPHA-1:** We're not doing shit just standing around these stiffs. Let's move.    \n\n**ALPHA-7:** I don't know, guys. I got a bad feeling about this one.\n\n**ALPHA-4:** That's what you said in Ontario too, Sev.  \n\n//[ALPHA-4 and ALPHA-5 both laugh.]//\n\n**ALPHA-5:** Cut him some slack-- that was a //big// fuckin' turtle.\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Listen, that was-\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Cut the chatter.\n\n//[ALPHA Squad enters the tree line.]//\n\n**ALPHA-5:** Look at this tree.\n\n//[Camera pans to an apple tree. A sigil is etched into the periderm.]//\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Shit if I know what that means.\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Got some over here too, Cap.\n\n**ALPHA-4:** Looks like it's all over the place.\n\n//[Another loud shriek is heard. Several seconds later, multiple shrieks are heard in the opposite direction.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Cap, that second one came from this direction.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Regis, be prepared for anything. The bodies we found... let's just say you don't want to be on the wrong end of this one.\n\n**BETA-1:** Got it, Cap. We found some sort of path, going to follow it. Stay safe.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Heads on swivel, boys.\n\n//[ALPHA Squad walks south for 10.5 minutes. Extraneous dialogue removed.]//\n\n**ALPHA-4:** Movement, 2 o-clock-- 3-- 5. Fuck, it's fast.\n\n//[Camera pans to ALPHA-4. A blur of motion can be seen behind him.]//\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Form up!\n\n//[Several gunshots can be heard over the radio; the loud shriek can be heard before several lower shrieks from all directions.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** We've got a man down, Cap. These fuckers don't die right.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Confirmed kill?\n\n**BETA-1:** Negative. Bullets didn't do a god damn thing. Keep a close eye //[Gunshots can be heard over the radio.]// Keep your //[Gunshots]// fucking trees. They look like fucking plants.\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Fuck. Where's Fives?\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Fives! Fives! Square, you got eyes on Fives? Square? Jesu-\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Shit. Cap, I got Fives over here.\n\n**ALPHA-1:** Fives, why the fuck didn-\n\n//[Camera faces ALPHA-7. Behind him, ALPHA-5  is seen bisected and hanging by his intestines from the trees.]//\n\n**ALPHA-1:** We need to move now. \n\n//[ALPHA Squad begins moving west at a fast pace. A loud shriek is heard followed by another shriek directly behind ALPHA Squad.]//\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Cap, watch out!\n\n//[Camera blurs before settling on an SCP-4608-1 instance a meter from ALPHA-1.]//\n\n[END LOG]\n------\n**__BETA Squad:__**\n------\n**Squad Lead:** BETA-1 \"Regis\" \n**Squad Members:** BETA-6 \"Sixes\", --BETA-8 \"Eight\"--, BETA-9 \"Nino\"\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[BETA Squad is moving quickly down a dirt path.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Sixes, make sure you keep pressure on that wound.\n\n**BETA-9:** What the fuck! Those things came out of nowhere. What's the plan, Regis?\n\n**BETA-1:** I don't know, Nino. Just stay the fuck away from the apples.\n\n**BETA-6:** //[Strained laughter.]// That's a good one, Reg, but I need a br-  \n\n//[BETA-6 collapses to the ground.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Nino, get him up, now. I'll cover.\n\n**BETA-1:** Cap, we aren't doing so good over here. One KIA, one injured. Could use a little help. Cap? Cap?\n\n**GAMMA-1:** //[Gunshots]// I think we're on our own, Regis. Switch to high impact //[Gunshots]// or explosive rounds. These fuckers ain't so tough.\n\n**BETA-1:** What's your location? We need assistance.\n\n//[BETA-9 is now carrying BETA-6 over his shoulder as BETA Squad continues down the path.]//\n\n**GAMMA-1:** //[Gunshots]// We aren't exactly having a picnic here. //[Gunshots]// sure you watch out after the first scream. It's like a call-response type thing //[Gunshots]//\n\n**BETA-9:** Regis! Over here, look!\n\n//[Camera pans to show a small brick chapel. The louder shriek can be heard. The response shrieks can be heard from all directions.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Get him in there! Go go go!\n\n//[The camera view swings behind BETA Squad, showing 3 SCP-4608-1 in close pursuit. BETA Squad enters the chapel and slams the door.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Put him down and give me a hand with this pew.\n\n//[BETA-9 slouches BETA-6 against the wall before helping BETA-1 barricade the door. SCP-4608-1 can be heard slamming on the door.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** That should buy us so-\n\n**BETA-9:** Oh shit.\n\n//[Camera pans around to show BETA-9 standing in front of a wall composed of human skulls.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Hey! Snap out of it. We don't have time for slack jawin'. Wake Sixes up. Fuckin' stick a finger in his wound if you have to.\n\n**BETA-9:** Sorry; you got it.\n\n//[BETA-1 begins rummaging through various scrolls and books on the shelves before pushing all of them to the floor.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** God damn, there's nothing but chicken-scratch bullshit. I can't read any of this.\n\n//[The call and response shrieks are heard again. The slamming on the door grows louder and more frequent.]//\n\n**BETA-6:** What is goin-\n\n**BETA-9:** He's up, Regis. You better come look at this wound, though.\n\n//[BETA-1 walks over and focuses his light on BETA-6's leg wound. The area around the wound is showing advanced necrosis. Several apple seeds can be seen embedded in and around the wound.]//\n\n**BETA-6:** What do you mean-- Oh god!\n\n**BETA-1:** //[Hands BETA-9 a small medical kit]// Dig those fucking things out and clean it up. We have to move.\n\n**BETA-9:** Gotcha. Sixes, this shit's gonna hurt.\n\n//[BETA-1 walks back to the other side of the chapel. Sixes' muffled grunts can be heard in the background. The call and response shrieks are occurring more frequently.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** //[Speaking quietly into his radio]// Jones, you copy? I'm fucking trapped. I don't know what to do.\n\n**GAMMA-1:** I'm getting close, I'm- I'm almost to the source. Going quiet.  \n\n//[Static can be heard over ALPHA-1's radio channel.]//\n\n**BETA-1:** Cap! Thank God, where the fuc-\n\n**ALPHA-7:** C-can anyone hear me? Come in, can anyone hear me?\n\n**BETA-1:** Sev, is that you? What the fuck is going on? Where's Cap?\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Dead, the-they're all dead. I'm heading west I think. I can't tell at this point, I- I think I'm getting close.\n\n**BETA-1:** Close to what- //[BETA-1 is cut off by the sound of BETA-9 screaming]//\n\n//[Camera swings around to show BETA-9 flailing on the ground. Twenty-five SCP-4608-1 instances are seen ripping off chunks of his flesh. More instances can be seen emerging from BETA-6's mouth, eyes, and leg wound.]// \n\n**BETA-1:** Fuck, fuck, fuck! \n\n//[BETA-1 is seen firing his weapon as the SCP-4608-1 instances begin to rush towards him.]//\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Regis? Regis? ... Anybody?\n\n[END LOG]\n-----\n**__GAMMA Squad:__**\n------\n**Squad Lead:** GAMMA-1 \"Jones\" \n**Squad Members:** --GAMMA-10 \"Tener\"--, --GAMMA-11 \"Elve\"--, --GAMMA-12 \"Doz\"--\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[GAMMA-1 is slowly walking toward a clearing in the orchard. Several inhuman voices can be heard speaking in an unidentified language.]//\n\n**GAMMA-1:** I gotta put you down, Tener. I think we got bogies ahead.\n\n//[GAMMA-1 slouches as he drops GAMMA-10 off his back.]// \n\n**GAMMA-1:** Tener? Fuck.\n\n//[Camera swings around to show GAMMA-10 disemboweled on the ground. GAMMA-1 searches GAMMA-10's pockets before pulling out a grenade.]//\n \n**GAMMA-1:** Dammit, John, you were too good for this shit. //[Inaudible whispering]//\n\n**ALPHA-7:** --think this is the channel. GAMMA Squad, do you copy? GAMMA Squad, do-\n\n**GAMMA-1:** //[Speaking quietly]// Sev, fuck, what's goi-\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Everyone is dead. I think BETA Squad is the same. Are you guys alright?\n\n//[Camera swings back to GAMMA-10's body.]//\n\n**GAMMA-1:** It's just me. \n\n//[The inhuman speech stops, and rhythmic shrieks begin. These shrieks last for 93 seconds.]//\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Oh god-- look at the trees.\n\n//[Camera pans to see human faces emerging from the trees surrounding GAMMA-1. The faces are sobbing as blood pours from their empty eye sockets.]//\n\n  **GAMMA-1:** Fuck this.\n\n//[GAMMA-1 stands as he enters the clearing. SCP-4608-2 can be seen in the center. All 13 faces stop shrieking, and begin frantically vocalizing in the unknown language.]//  \n\n**GAMMA-1:** Holy fuck.\n\n//[GAMMA-1 fires several rounds at SCP-4608-2, which continues to vocalize.]//\n\n**ALPHA-7:** Hold on Jones, I'm almost ther-\n\n**GAMMA-1:** Get the fuck out of here, get out and get back up, call in- //[grunting]//\n\n//[Camera snaps down to see a large root constricting around GAMMA-1. The sound of several bones breaking can be heard.]//\n\n**GAMMA-1:** Don't wo- worry, I wasn't going an-anywhere. //[GAMMA-1 gurgles a laugh as he throws the grenade at SCP-4608-2.]//\n\n//[A loud snap is heard before GAMMA-1 goes limp. SCP-4608-2 can be seen erupting into flames as it begins to collapse. The camera and GAMMA-1's body fall to the ground; the camera shows the surrounding trees screaming-- their branches spontaneously combusting. Several SCP-4608-1 can be seen weaving through the trees, also on fire.]//   \n\n**ALPHA-7** Oh my god, shit, shit, Jones I'm- I'm sorry I can't- I have to //[Coughing.]// go.\n\n[END LOG]\n-----\n-----\n**Closing Statement:** On October 16, 1947 ALPHA-7 was recovered by the Allen County Fire Department, unconscious and suffering from exhaustion and smoke inhalation. The Site-81 Concealment Team took control of the situation and quarantined the area using the cover story of a toxic chemical hazard.\nFollowing debriefing and a psychological evaluation, ALPHA-7 was administered amnestics and switched to low-risk recovery assignment. The members of MSF Bravo-7 were posthumously awarded the Foundation Star for their efforts during the neutralization of SCP-4608.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4607]]] | SCP-4608 | [[[SCP-4609]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=DrAkimoto]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** File:Photograph of Logged Off, Burned Over, Nonrestocking Private Land - NARA - 2129428.jpg \n> **Name:** thing.png\n> **Author:** U.S. National Archives and Records Administration\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Photograph_of_Logged_Off,_Burned_Over,_Nonrestocking_Private_Land_-_NARA_-_2129428.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** File:Johnny Appleseed 1.jpg\n> **Name:** one\n> **Author:** H.
