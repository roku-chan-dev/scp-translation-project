All advertisements featuring SCP-6985, whether digital or physical, are to be hidden from public eye by any means available. Recovered instances of SCP-6985 are to be stored in a large glass case imbued with insect repellent within Site-19.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6985 is the designation for an unmarked, bright pink spherical object attached to a small round stump approximately the size of a bowling ball. The entirety of SCP-6985 is rounded and smooth, crafted out of an unknown, soft and slightly adhesive material. Attached to a hole in the top of the object is a removable neon tag that reads 'The anti-spider!' in large bold letters. \n\nOn 07/7/21, instances of SCP-6985 started spontaneously appearing within the homes of hundreds of seemingly random individuals. Later tests show these individuals all suffer from mild to severe arachnophobia.[[footnote]]Fear of spiders.[[/footnote]] About three days prior to this event, multiple advertisements and pieces of media surrounding SCP-6985 began revealing themselves, visible only to those suffering from arachnophobia. After 07/7/21, they proceeded to become perceivable to all. The individuals who received SCP-6985 had varying reactions, ranging from uneasy to indifferent towards the object's appearance in their homes, and over 80% of these people appeared heavily reluctant to lose contact with it upon notice. \n\nThe most detailed advertisement concerning SCP-6985 that was obtained by personnel was a colourful poster picturing SCP-6985 resting on a white table in front of a bright screen. The poster reads as follows:\n\n> //'Let your fears die away! Presenting.....the anti-spider! The anti-spider is perfect for anyone with even a small fear of spiders. Why? Because it's nothing that a spider is and everything a spider's not! Simply take a look to see how not a spider this amazing creation is! And sleep good dreams with this on your bedside table, or anywhere else in your house. Knowing confidently that this is NOT a spider!'//\n\nThe back of the poster features a table detailing the numerous differences between instances of SCP-6985 and members of the arachnid family:\n\n||~ Spider ||~ Anti-spider ||\n|| Is hairy || Is not at all hairy ||\n|| Has eight legs || Has no legs ||\n|| Has eight eyes || Has no eyes ||\n|| Has fangs|| Does not have fangs ||\n|| Can produce silk || Can not produce silk ||\n|| Builds webs || Does not build webs ||\n|| Sometimes eats other spiders || Does not eat, just waits ||\n|| Lays many eggs || Does not lay eggs ||\n|| Lives up to 40 years || Stays forever ||\n|| Is easy to kill off || Can not be killed, effectively indestructible ||\n|| Is alive || Is not alive ||\n|| Eats thousands of insects every year, thus controlling the bug population in households worldwide|| Does not do that ||\n [[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6984]]] | SCP-6985 | [[[SCP-6986]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
