The reason, of course, is ... my pleasure. Included are the top 20 of CN-3000 and some of my own picks.

Two things in particular:\n\nFirst, what to draw for \"Nodes\"? I can't possibly draw every character with a profile picture. That would exhaust me (and if you really want to see them, why not go to Stse's art page?) Drawing the logos or feature vectors also seems uninteresting, so I ended up unimaginatively choosing the head picture. But as the official 3k, it will definitely get special treatment, and you'll see that in the end.\n\nSecond, you two authors have tough avatars! They don't fit the 2D style at all! Anyway, it's also quite challenging, completely out of my comfort zone, so I had to force myself to draw it.\n\nAlso, as you may have noticed, the CSS on this page was copied from [[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/jiedianzhiguang|Light of Nodes]]].

However, at Anzi (day by die)'s request, two NPCs, Yunxi and Liang Mao, were added, bringing the total to six. The authors split into two groups and acted as groomsmen and bridesmaids on two sides, with each character having its own style. Originally, the idea was to have these four play flutes and work as carpenters, but considering their appearance, it seems that this task is not quite suitable for them.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack scp-stack-reverse\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3004.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3004|SCP-CN-3004]]] - In the Midst of the Rainstorm (于覆雨中)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Lumina Mio]]\n\nIt seems that more than one participant wrote about a scene with rain this time, but this article has the word \"rain\" right in the title, so it's okay. The artwork also includes the little shapeshifter Utna from the story. The author mentioned that it was inspired by FFXIV's Meteion, and when I asked if the tail should be shorter, the author said it could be longer. Good taste.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-block\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3005.PNG]]\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-caption-alt\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3005|SCP-CN-3005]]] - The Bitzer (大崽种)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Kanie Ja]], [[*user Nya_Scarlet]]\n\nIt's a funny piece, so it should be paired with a funny pic.

I also don't understand furry, so I could only draw a humanized version like in my tape art. The author seems to be a professional thaumaturgist, and I'm not sure if he plays some kind of cult simulator besides thaumaturgy.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3100.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3100|SCP-CN-3100]]] - Why Intimidate Them With Death (奈何以死惧之)\n\n**Author:** [[*user TobiasReaper]]\n\nI originally thought I wouldn't be able to contact him, but by a lucky coincidence, I did! As a result, this is the last character drawn on the art page.\n\nAlthough the most famous passage in this article is \"arrested and executed,\" its intended meaning is clearly not that, so I cannot irresponsibly draw a person who shoots others! Finally, based on the feeling conveyed in the conclusion of the article, I drew people of different colors holding hands to rebuild the global village (for sure)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack scp-stack-reverse\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3125.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3125|SCP-CN-3125]]] - Snake Glare (蛇凝)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Rye Travis]], [[*user NoelleFavonius]]\n\nThe easiest episode. Since I also designed the logo for Basilisk.aic, all I had to do was draw it accordingly. Don't expect me to draw fractals or memetic kill agents, because I can't draw them, and even if I try, I might get terminated by the drawn kill agents halfway through.

They even included reference images of the crutch and specified the exact model for a DJI drone with a link. However, I didn't really follow their instructions. Don't expect me to actually draw a meter-long drone for you!\n\nHala suggested drawing a burning globe with a little paper man behind it. Hala tries to put out the fire while ChroIr starts the fire. It seems like that's how their writing process works, one person holding back, the other letting go. But the end result feels like an elderly military officer confronting a dangerous public arsonist.\n\nIt was only after I finished the drawing that I realized I could have drawn the three flames!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3141.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3141|SCP-CN-3141]]] - Morokoshi\n\n**Author:** [[*user Hueyacuetzpali]]\n\nSuper-clinical academic paper. The image is the sowing of rice, as the author specifies. There may be an indescribable affinity between cultures of different times and places, but that affinity dissipates with the wind. However, please spare me from drawing a bunch of unearthed relics.\n\nIf there really was a Foundation, I hope it would be an organization like this.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack scp-stack-reverse\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3200.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3200|SCP-CN-3200]]] - Site-41\n\n**Author:** [[*user Jiu_Huan]], [[*user Parismay_Mochi]]\n\nI have two major shortcomings: first, I don't read EN much, and second, I don't understand antimemetics. These two factors combined make me completely clueless about what to draw. The authors suggested drawing a lot of dark figures, so I did that, and also added something that is not a sphere, but rather quite spherical.\n\nYou antimemetics are quite annoying!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-block\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3300.PNG]]\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-caption-alt\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3300|SCP-CN-3300]]] - //#Automata#//\n\n**Author:** [[*user CaroyalKKaia]], [[*user Sylvia_Blank]], [[*user MoRIME]]\n\nI saw six shipgirls as soon as I opened the article. No wonder, since it's from Old Wu (CaroyalKKaia). Here I drew Kanaloa-chan with braided hair, looking very obedient, sitting in the center of the picture.

The most character-crowded episode (though technically balanced by the addition of two NPCs in Rhapsody on the Dream of Splendor). Everyone has a card of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\", but Resonance couldn't appear since it has no shape (and the cards only come in four colors). For my own avatar, I chose the (self-proclaimed) God of Toilet Tank. When Silver Ice saw it, he drew a \"bread-holds-up-poop.jpg\" sticker for me. It was quite mysterious...\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3309.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3309|SCP-CN-3309]]] - The Lone Myth (独自神话)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Mizuhanabi]]\n\nAmong the various god-like AICs in the CN3K, our poor little Myt, with little power, seems a bit out of place, trembling in the corner.

The scene is very simple: it's snowing in the background, and the character is holding a (not readily apparent) storybook. That's it.

Bishop served as the height model for all the other characters in the following drawings. I don't know why, but after reading about King Mu of Zhou, an image of a group of people studying a miniature version of him in a misty environment came to mind.\n\nAlthough I had previously drawn avatars for Flower and Bishop, when I revisited their files and asked around, I found that their appearance had undergone subtle changes.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-block\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3500.PNG]]\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-caption-alt\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3500|SCP-CN-3500]]] - To Found (为建立)\n\n**Author:** [[*user haplocalyx]], [[*user Confucian Lee]], [[*user LogicWu]]\n\nAm I playing FGO? It feels like the phrase \"Humanity Foundation Value\" just slapped me in the face. However, it's true that I quit before version 2.0 came out. Don't ask me why I quit; you don't want to know how much I spent trying to summon a certain character...\n\nSimilar to Rhapsody on the Dream of Splendor, the three authors are each in three different styles: one in battle gear, one in historical costume, and one as a maid. What a mix, but it's very FGO-like. This is also one of the two groups that has specific requirements for what the characters should be holding (the other being Raging Fire Burns the Heart). Since I'm not very familiar with the history of the Foundation, I could only draw an abstract scale pretending to be a timeline.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack  scp-stack-reverse\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3555.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3555|SCP-CN-3555]]] - File Not Created (档案未建立)\n\n**Author:** [[*user ONXY]]\n\nI have to say it's hard to draw your antimemetic stuff. I had no idea what it actually looked like, so I could only symbolically color it black. I've done this before with Site-41 and Onxy's tape art. Here I did it again, for the third time.\n\nThe simplified logo in the background is the site logo of Area-CN-55, and yes, I designed that too. I wanted to create a feeling of \"guarding the last fortress\", but because the outline and the fill are the same color, it's hard to see a fortress. Let's just think of it as Area-CN-55 being overrun by weird antimemetics (sad).\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-character-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-image\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3600.PNG]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-text-block\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3600|SCP-CN-3600]]] - Red Sun (红日)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Andy_W7]]\n\nThe author asked for a hedgehog hair style similar to Kamijou Touma's, which was a bit difficult to draw, so I just barely managed it.

Although showing their backs can also reduce their charm, it's still a difference between -100% charm and -50% charm compared to showing their faces. Looks like it's a good angel.\n\n\nThe author strongly requests that a sentence be added: \"The angel in the picture is just an impression! Canonically, the angel has no definite form!\"\n\n\n\nIt's well known that an angel without a definite form has a charm level of -0%, full charm!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-block\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/3999.PNG]]\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-caption-alt\"]]\n++ [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3999|SCP-CN-3999]]] - Crossing the Heaven (跨越天堂)\n\n**Author:** [[*user Kcorena]], [[*user Diamond_Apple]]\n\nAt first, I couldn't think of what to draw. Finally, I thought, why not draw a group photo of the author and the two heroines? I added Exulans in the corner of the photo for my own bias, definitely not as a third wheel.\n\nKC said he wanted a huge beard, so I gave him his wish! As for Diamond Apple's author avatar, there are so many versions. He has dozens of different versions on his author page alone, so I just drew my own.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-block\"]]\n[[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/breaddddd6/cn3000-2.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-gallery-caption-alt\"]]\nThose who know me know that I really dislike contests.\n\nIn fact, during the cn3k contest, my mentality broke down several times, and from around November to the end of January, there was a lot of negativity. There are many reasons for this, but in general I am not used to competition.\n\nBut strangely enough, I still attended every cn kcon. During the 1k, I was still a newbie. One Friday after Halloween, I stayed in my dorm and finished writing [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-1999|Remnants of Fantasy]]]. During 2k, I had no confidence in entering, but in the end, after three days of hard work with Phage and Silver Ice, I submitted [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-2002|Wonder Wanders]]] in the last 21 seconds of the contest. During 3k, I had an early discussion with CL about making a game, and in the end, I got a lot of people together, worked tirelessly for over a month, even creating a project management plan, a bug tracking sheet, and a number of other things, and finally created [[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-3301|THE FOUNDATION MINIGAME]]].\n\nI don't want to emphasize how much effort I put into these kcons, or what kind of feedback I expect these articles to receive. I'm just thinking that while I was writing for kcons, many other authors were also creating in places unknown to me. Regarding kcons, I have many stories to tell, and other authors have many stories to tell as well. Every day and night from November 2023 to January 2024, miracles happened every minute and every second, on buses, in cafes, under desks, on telephones next to office desks, and in the faint glimmer of computer screens visible through apartment windows. Each article is not just an article, but a collection of the author's thoughts and ideas during that time, the effort put in, the advice received, and the inspiration generated. So I won't just draw the works themselves, I hope to see the authors and their creations standing together. This is similar to //Nodes//, as each author strives to find what they love and resonates with their \"rarusium\". Authors and works are nodes, and the network of them forms the community.\n\nAlthough this group photo was only a half-hearted coincidence, it could also be fate. I've probably wanted to commemorate an event and a group of people associated with it in this way for a long time. Unfortunately, due to my limited energy and the fact that some articles are really difficult to depict, this group photo cannot include all cn3k entries. But I believe that all the creators must have expressed something and gained something from this event. And I believe that you, who have come this far, have done the same.\n\nTo be honest, I still really dislike contests. But I really enjoy creating with everyone. I look forward to our next meeting (and hopefully cn4k will come much later).\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
