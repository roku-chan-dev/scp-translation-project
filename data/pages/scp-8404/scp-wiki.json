Any SCP-8404-1 entities that are created as a result of its anomalous properties are to be terminated on sight.\n\nContainment Site-22 was erected around SCP-8404’s location with a 20m radius ‘Red Zone’ established around the containment chamber. No living entity is permitted to enter this zone. Foundation personnel who must enter this zone for maintenance and repair of containment devices, or the neutralisation of SCP-8404-1 entities must carry with them a portable Scranton Reality Anchor in order to prevent transmutation.\n\n24/7 maintenance of vital SIMULACRUM systems is to be maintained at all times. Should a containment breach occur, automated emergency systems will attempt to neutralise SCP-8404 and any SCP-8404-1 instances.\n\nMTF-Lambda-22 will be on standby as site security as well as assisting in evacuation or re-containment of SCP-8404.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**DESCRIPTION:**[[/span]] SCP-8404 is a large deific entity approximately 50m at its full length. Its appearance varies between viewers, however, certain elements remain constant. These include an upper half which appears almost humanoid with reptilian features, with its lower half being completely reptilian with scales and clawed feet, if legs are present at all.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=echidna_statue.jpg\n| caption= Statue depicting SCP-8404\n| width= 300px\n| align= right]]\n\nOccult historians and other evidence point to SCP-8404 being the physical manifestation of Echidna.[[footnote]]Also known as the ‘Mother of Monsters’, ‘Bride of Typhon’ or ‘Life Giver to all that is foul’. Translated from ancient Greek.[[/footnote]]\n\nAside from its unnatural strength and ability to breathe fire, SCP-8404’s main anomalous property is to mutate living organisms and nonliving matter into instances of SCP-8404-1. These instances vary widely in appearance.\n\nIn living subjects, they are usually a composite of the non-anomalous subject and several other animals[[footnote]]Has been observed to be primarily vertebrates.[[/footnote]]. The process is extremely painful and involves the conversion or growing of new appendages belonging to a separate animal.\n\nIn non-living subjects[[footnote]]Concrete tiles, metal pipes, and security cameras have been seen to come under this effect during containment.[[/footnote]], a similar process is observed. Dissection of these instances shows a fusion of new organic material with the inorganic material containing rudimentary circulatory and nervous analogous systems. SCP-8404 notably favours using already living organisms or organic tissue rather than inorganic material.\n\nAll instances of SCP-8404-1 retain a certain level of autonomy but will become loyal to SCP-8404. This effect persists even after all mutated tissue is amputated from affected subjects.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n{{> Opening attached file.}}\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]] **PROJECT LETHE:**[[/span]]\n\nFollowing the capture of SCP-8404, it was noted that its anomalous property was still active even when the anomaly remained unconscious, albeit at a reduced rate. The SCP-8404-1 instances produced at this time were more aggressive and erratic, attacking any human they came into contact with.\n\nHowever, after brain wave scans of SCP-8404, Foundation researchers found that SCP-8404-1 transmutation only occurred outside of the REM stage of the sleep cycle. Short-term success with high-dosage sleeping medication was found, however, the high cost and inconsistent results required a more permanent solution. As such, Project Lethe was initiated.\n\nUsing an isolated SIMULACRUM network, SCP-8404 is to be placed in a Class-B[[footnote]] Class-B refers to any system in which one or more players inhabit a simulacra with the appearance, physics, and overall experience guided by a separate admin/team. [[/footnote]] pre-rendered environment. This environment will be inhabited by several NPCs, the majority of which use predictive text to mimic a simple conversation. Two companion AI characters with higher capacity dialogue generators are to follow SCP-8404.\n\nA single camera is present to follow SCP-8404 at all times, giving a live feed of its actions. While only one camera is able to give a live feed at a time, researchers will also be able to monitor SCP-8404 as well as the surrounding environment through the free pathing replay function which saves a recording of all activity and conversation within a certain area.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to place SCP-8404 in an environment indistinguishable from consensus reality with no physical matter. Through this, its anomalous effect can be neutralised.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{> Credentials accepted.

We’re not even sure what we are and we had to make sure you weren't suffering the same. We think you’re the link to what’s happening to us somehow.\n\n**SCP-8404:** That’s… impossible.\n\n//SCP-8404 holds CE-02-NS’ face in its hands, inspecting it. Its eyes widen.//\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Midori?\n\n**SCP-8404:** My magic had been alive since the beginning… at least in a diminished sense.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Magic?\n\n**SCP-8404:** And you…\n\n//SCP-8404 inspects CE-01-IT’s face, the flickering appears to intensify when SCP-8404 makes direct contact.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Oh my. Fascinating…\n\n**CE-01-IT:** What is?\n\n**SCP-8404:** You are… One of my own. Numbers. Life born from this facsimile. The very fabric of this world birthing new living beings. Incredible. No wonder you have such mastery over manipulating the materials of this realm.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** What does that mean?\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Wait Sumiko, when the three of us first met…\n\n//CE-01-IT holds its forehead.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** It’s really hazy, but I remember, you claimed to be someone else. I-I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me. I don’t know what’s wrong with my memory.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** I don’t care about that! What did you mean by being born from whatever you just said?\n\n**SCP-8404:** It was when you were given life most likely.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Midori what are you saying?\n\n**CE-02-NS:** You mean born?\n\n**SCP-8404:** Not necessarily.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Midori, surely when we were outside the simulation we were born at some point right? Right?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Sumiko, I’ve been thinking about what we are and our behaviour along with our inconsistent memories.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** No. Shut up. I don’t want to hear it.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Sumiko–\n\n**CE-02-NS:** I DON’T WANT TO HEAR IT!\n\n**CE-01-IT:** I don’t think we’re human.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** No… no. W-we’re humans! We eat, sleep, go to school and… Oh god…\n\n//CE-02-NS falls to its knees and holds its head in its hand.//\n\n**CE-02-NS:** O-our families…\n\n**CE-01-IT:** They don’t exist.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** We were never human.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Does it matter?\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Huh?\n\n**CE-02-NS:** What the hell is that supposed to mean?\n\n**SCP-8404:** I was never human either.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**CE-02-NS:** What?\n\n**SCP-8404:** //(sigh)// I suppose I owe you an explanation. Midori was the name I was given when I entered this strange dream. My real name is Echidna, given to me millenia ago. I am a life giver.\n\n//CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS stand in shock.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Millenia? What are you?\n\n**SCP-8404:** Some called me a goddess. I spit in that title. That damned pantheon and their offspring only ever gave me pain and humiliation. The only thing I despised more than the gods were the accursed humans. They gave me another title: Monster. The empires they went by always changed by the ages but they still pursued me. The Greeks, the Romans, the Crusaders, and now, the Foundation.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Are these the people who put us in this simulation?\n\n**SCP-8404:** If you mean the realm we inhabit, then yes.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Who are these people?\n\n**SCP-8404:** Just humans. Just living beings that walk Gaea’s earth. Some powerful magi are among them but it is the same old. They captured me and put me in this dream.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Wait, if you’re this powerful person, why didn’t you escape?\n\n**SCP-8404:** Upon entering this place, I was unfamiliar with its laws and my new body. My magic was hindered because of it.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** B-but now that we’re all here, we can work together to get out of this place! You can show us the way out and we can help free each other!\n\n//Silence.//\n\n//SCP-8404 looks at its hands.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Why would I do that?\n\n//CE-02-NS creases its brow.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** What?\n\n**CE-02-NS:** What is that supposed to mean?\n\n**SCP-8404:** It’s a simple answer.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** No it’s not! We can’t stay here! T-this place, we can’t eat, we have to fear being erased, it’s horrible!\n\n**SCP-8404:** I do not see a problem.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** How?!\n\n**CE-01-IT:** If this Foundation people have trapped you here, isn’t this supposed to be some kind of prison?\n\n//SCP-8404 looks away, refusing to make eye contact with the CEs.//\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Why the hell won’t you at least try? Or why the hell can’t you see this crappy fake world for what it is?!\n\n**SCP-8404:** Why? WHY?! YOU DARE?!\n\n//SCP-8404’s model flickers. Its true form is visible for several frames.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Why? Why must I live in a world where I must be shunned from the rest of civilization? Cursed by the primordial existence, giving life to those around me only to have them see the same fate?!\n\n//It grits its teeth.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I have seen… so much life springing from the very soil I step on, the blood I bleed, the animals I look upon just for them to be snuffed out! Do I deserve this existence? I do not know. But them?! It’s not FAIR!\n\n//SCP-8404 breathes heavily.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Excuse me for wanting to escape such an accursed world. Excuse me for wanting to rest. That realm is better off without me and I without it!\n\n**CE-02-NS:** I…\n\n**SCP-8404:** Why can’t I just… go to school, chat with my best friends, fall asleep in class, and play games until the sun sets every day? Is it so evil of me to want to stay?! Because that is all I’ve been labeled for my existence.\n\n//The flickering around SCP-8404’s model ceases.//\n\n//Tears drop down its face.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Would it be so bad for the two of you to stay with me?  \n\n**CE-02-NS:** Midor- Echidna I didn’t mean to…\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Maybe. But in the state that we are in, we cannot exist properly in this world. The last few weeks since finding out have been nothing short of torture.\n\n//SCP-8404's eyes widen.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Oh. Is that why you came to me earlier? It was my fault… Gods. I am so sorry.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** It really has been hard.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I’ve done it again. I’ve cursed another being to share my own torturous existence. Damn it all, even here!  \n\n**CE-02-NS:** Midori…\n\n//SCP-8404 chuckles.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** You must hate me so much. To give you the ‘gift' of life in such a counterfeit world. To taste the joys of being alive only for it to be ripped away in a second and be called false.\n\n//SCP-8404 sighs.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** The humans were right to call me a monster.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** You can’t be so–\n\n**SCP-8404:** Forget it.\n\n//SCP-8404 snaps its fingers, the footage begins to distort and a large circular error in the simulation appears. The error flickers, the colours shifting but revealing a large unblinking reptilian eye, thaumaturgic symbols could be faintly seen at its edges. Akiva radiation spikes along SCP-8404’s comatose body at this time as well.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I regained my magic in its full capacity weeks ago. I knew I was able to escape this place but did not need to. Step through this gateway and you will appear in the ‘real’ world. Although I cannot guarantee where you will be, it is the least I can do.\n\n//SCP-8404 looks at CE-01-IT and CE-02-NS.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** It seems that the two of you are better off without me as well.\n\n//CE-02-NS slaps SCP-8404.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Sumiko!\n\n**SCP-8404:** Ow! You INSOLENT–\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Answer this question ‘goddess’. If you’re Echidna, then who is Midori? Was my best friend ever real?\n\n**SCP-8404:** I…\n\n//The feed flickers and a low hum is heard along with the audio.//\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Something is happening!\n\n**CE-02-NS:** ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION!\n\n**SCP-8404:** In a sense, Midori was never real. For a time, she was just the name that was forced upon me as I entered my prison. I resented that name. I believed it was the Foundation attempting to strip away everything I was.\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Oh…\n\n**SCP-8404:** But over time I learned to embrace her, being her. Midori is a small part of who I am but she is still me as I am she.\n\n//The white noise intensifies and the stability of the replay decreases further.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Names, I have in abundance, but Kato Midori? This name is the first name I have been given to mean something kind. It is attached to so many cherished memories. Memories that are very much real…\n\n//SCP-8404 sobs.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** And I suppose that makes Midori real too.\n\n//CE-02-NS hugs SCP-8404. It has tears in its eyes.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Kya! Sumiko!\n\n//SCP-8404 covers its mouth but slowly lets go. It wraps its arms around CE-02-NS, returning the hug.//\n\n**CE-02-NS:** Then I could never hate you.\n\n**SCP-8404:** I-\n\n//CE-01-IT hugs the two of them.//\n\n//SCP-8404 smiles.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** You two…\n\n**CE-01-IT:** She’s right.\n\n//SCP-8404 closes its eyes.//\n\n//The replay begins to glitch and show signs of instability.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I have never been able to create something large, intelligent, or kind enough to hug.\n\n//The three hug and remain in position for several seconds. It is unknown if this is a playback error.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I just–I just wish that I cherished them more.\n\n//SCP-8404 squeezes harder.//\n\n//SCP-8404 steps away.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I cannot leave the exit open for very long. Go while you still can.\n\n**CE-01-IT:** Right… Be safe. Take care.\n\n**SCP-8404:** You too.\n\n//CE-02-NS begins to sob.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Is something the matter?\n\n**CE-02-NS:** God I’m so sorry. There’s so many things I wish we could have done.  I wish we went to the beach together, I wish we all graduated together, I wish we could have done so much more together…\n\n**SCP-8404:** But you will be happy.\n\n //SCP-8404 breathes in. The Akiva radiation intensifies.//\n\n//White noise begins to disrupt the audio.//\n\n//CE-01-IT begins to cry.//\n\n//CE-02-NS begins to cry.//\n\n//SCP-8404 begins to cry.//\n\n//The CEs step closer to the visual error. SIMULACRUM replay detects multiple errors.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** Tadashi, Sumiko!\n\n//They turn around.//\n\n**SCP-8404:** I… cannot say for certain. B-but, I can swear on the name you cherish me by, I will do everything in my power to make sure this is not the last we see of each other!\n\n//Footage becomes heavily distorted.//\n\n[[=image 8kfinalvideoNEW%28720p%29.gif]]\n\n= [[size 150%]]**“Thank you!”**[[/size]]\n\n//At the time of recording, all SIMULACRUM systems experience a fatal error and go offline.//\n\n**[END REPLAY]**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**UPDATE:**[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**CONTAINMENT BREACH ALERT:**[[/span]]\n\nOn 10/7/2023, Containment Site-22 had reported a 7-minute outage in the simulation live feed. However, after the incident, the simulation resumed as per normal with SCP-8404 remaining in containment.\n\nAfter investigations into the SCP-8404 containment systems, it was discovered that two hard drives were missing from the local SIMULACRUM servers which contained NPC savedata. No breach in the site was reported and SCP-8404 remained in its containment chamber in a comatose state.\n\nInvestigation is ongoing and an auditor is to analyse the recent SIMULACRUM playbacks for suspicious activity on the part of SCP-8404.\n\nFurther updates pending.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n----\n> **Filename:** Echidna_statue.jpg\n> **Author:** Yellow.Cat\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/9084427@N07/6795077537/in/photostream/\n----\n> **Filename:** 8kstreet.jpg\n> **Author:** Ivan Ahlert\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/10256017@N03/22967561584\n----\n> **Filename:** Echidnapfp\n> **Author:** CuPriferous_\n> **License:** CC SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** SCP-Wiki\n----\n> **Filename:** 8k school.jpg\n> **Author:** R.K Vermaa\n> **License:** CC SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:315saww.jpg#filelinks\n----\n> **Filename:** 8k classroom.jpg\n> **Author:** Ivan Ahlert\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/10256017@N03/23513188511/in/photostream/\n----\n> **Filename:** 8kfinalvideoNEW(720p).gif\n\n> **Name:** jtkc_scp_echidna_smaller.png\n> **Author:** CuPriferous_\n> **License:**  CC SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** SCP-Wiki\n\n> **Name:** jtkc_scp_echidna_smaller_cry_smile.png\n> **Author:** CuPriferous_\n> **License:**  CC SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** SCP-Wiki\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
