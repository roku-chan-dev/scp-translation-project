Now, they're gone,\n\"Absconded,\" he said, glowering past me.\nThe bags below his eyes belied a yawn.\n\"A handful left, perhaps a score, and thee.\"\n//His accent was too thick for me to grasp\n\"It was fun, once,\" was all I heard him rasp//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab 2000]]\n[[[scp-2000 |Deus Ex Machina]]]\nWe live our lives in quiet discontent\nBut safe among the rambling lies we weave\nAbout how we've protected our ascent\nTo afterlife, and yet we thought to leave\nA ranger station, quiet in its place\nAmong the geyser's roaring waterspout\nConcealing network hoping to replace\nThe world that we can learn to do without\nA hidden comfort we cannot learn of,\nDespite the fact that it would bring us peace,\nA magnifier of the dang'rous love\nA counter to the promise of release\n//But in the end, with blackness ending yawn\nI bet no one will even know we're gone//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab 2999/1903/1619]]\n[[[scp-2999 |The Black Cat and the White Rabbit]]] / [[[scp-1903 |Jackie's Secret]]] / [[[scp-1619 |Site-45-C: Floor 24]]]\nOh, listen close to humming in the air,\nThe disk drive, like a flitting moth, awakes\nAnd spins the empty numbness it can spare\nFrom lines of code that slither through like snakes\nThe party's in full swing now, and the lords\nAnd ladies in their grandeur turn to watch\nThe cat among them, slowly drifting towards\nThe center, now devoid of all debauch\nBut even masks can't save him now in this\nEmaciated form, he tries to tamp\nThe feeling grown of dread encasing bliss\nHe's wond'ring if he should have asked the lamp\n//A sharpened mind's no match for rabbit's claws\nOur Sarah isn't here now, never was//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab 006-J]]\n[[[scp-006-j |WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING]]]\nDo living creatures not deserve respect\nNo matter how upsetting their visage?\nMaybe. Perhaps we all need to reflect\nUpon the thin genetics, and the bridge\nThat draws us close together, us and them\n(Disgusting though their many legs may be)\nThe tree of life has crafted many stems\nAnd good or ill, entwined with them we see\nThem only through the crystal glass I wield\nTo capture them, release upon the earth.\nThe index card's a flimsy sort of shield\nProtection that we've borne against since birth\n//Yet tender love for them--oh no, it fell\nOh shiTTING FUCK, IT'S ON MY FACE, OH HELL//\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[=]]\n**<< First Quarto | [[[second-quarto |Second Quarto]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
