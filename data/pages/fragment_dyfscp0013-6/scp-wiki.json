Casey himself has gone from \"that guy who stabbed you in a back alley\" to your first real friend.\n\nBut the three others aren't bad, either!\n\nThere's ##7CFF71|**McDrugs**##, the loud one who has an odd theory about literally everything. Whenever someone says her name, she always interjects with, \"It's ironic; I'm actually straightedge.\" \n\nThen there's ##cyan|**Wakako**##, Casey's on-and-off girlfriend. You've stayed up late many nights talking to her about movies. As fate would have it, for ten years, you've been forced to watch her favorite kind of movies -- gory nightmares with downer endings. She taught you how to see them in a whole new way!\n\nAnd last of all, ##ff99ff|**Gregg**##. Aloof, cynical, and spends most of his time reading philosophy. If anyone knows what he's thinking, that puts 'em a peg over you, Casey, and all the rest of the world put together. Very good at cards, though!\n\nYou've gone on many adventures with these four idiots. You've seen every corner of Australia from bus terminals and underpasses. You've even been to bits and pieces of the \"Reconstruction Zone\", like China and Singapore -- where Three Moons slowly terraforms the endless fields of Tarrare's black glass into neat little checkerboards of farmland.\n\nAnd through it all, your innocent sense of humor has been the glue keeping their collective sanity together. (And it doesn't hurt that you never need to eat \"real\" food!)\n\nAnd best of all, rival gangs like the Greensleeves leave you all alone on principle, and all it took was the Lambo Incident.[[footnote]]That was about 1 1/2 years ago, when a Greensleeve caught you opening the hood of his Lamborghini, unhinging your jaw, and swallowing the engine block whole. You smiled to him like a threatened chimpanzee. The Greensleeve in question has since devoted his life to religious monasticism.[[/footnote]]\n\nUnlike at Site-6800, there's been a reason to laugh[[footnote]](And you //can// laugh without your voice. It's sort of a rapid-hissing-through-your-teeth thing.)[[/footnote]] every day. This has been the best two years of your life, and the only drawback is that you can't help but feel like you're forgetting something...\n\nSo, where are you now?\n\nAbout a month ago, McDrugs's uncle died and bequeathed her the roadside movie theater he owned in Perth. The idea was for McDrugs to, and I quote, \"settle down and fucking make something of her worthless life for a change.\" Fortunately, that guy was a racist, so this cinema's being used exclusively as a place for Casey and his mates to goof off.\n\nAnd now that you and your friends aren't on the move as often, Dr. Fenwick might even track down your ankle bracelet and take you back...\n\n... \n\n...but will you even //want// to go back?\n\nQuestions for later. \n\n------\n\n> +++  ☐ Find out what movie you're watching.\n\nFor now, you've been startled awake from another of your horrible \"Tarrare\" dreams. McDrugs yelled something about Alan Rickman in response to a movie trailer. You stir in your leather stadium seat, one of the few in Theater 5 where you haven't eaten the cushions. The swell of an orchestra booms over some old movie trailers.\n\nYou turn to Casey inquisitively. Alas, you just remembered that he's up in the projector booth with Gregg.\n\nBut Wakako's just one seat over, staring drowsily at the screen. She's buried nose-deep in her oversized blue hoodie. This movie isn't her kinda thing. But what movie //is// it?\n\nYou wave. She raises an eyebrow.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|WHAT MOVIE IS THIS??##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIt takes her a second to read your whiteboard in the darkness.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n##cyan|{{...oh, right.

Wakako's already napping again.\n\nIt's been explained to you many, many times, but you're still not too sure what this \"Three Moons\" thing is. Apparently they run the whole world's government. And they come from \"the afterlife\" -- which is another confusing concept in itself. \"The place where you go after you die.\" But if you're dead, how can you tell where you are?!\n\nOh, here's the big, fancy title logotype.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **MUTINY ON THE //PERUN//**\n+++++ AN ED WOOD FILM\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAWESOME!

Being bored by a movie is better than being horrified. But too much boredom is pretty horrifying in itself...\n\nBut what's this? Tarrare's showing up for the first time! The CGI is impressive, but it wouldn't have killed them to stick a badass set piece like this in the first ten minutes. \n\n(...hold on, are you turning into a cinema snob? Then again, you //have// been studying it for a while...)\n\nThere's a Pacific Northwestern forest on the screen, set completely ablaze. The night sky is red from the flames. Tarrare can be seen in the horizon, with its tornadoes of slag sucking in everything below. It looks different from your dreams -- more sharp angles, lots of glowing blue lines across its hall. (Must be some pretty advanced tech; it's got the glowey-stripey bits.)\n\nA hard and fast zoom... \n\nThey're on Tarrare's bridge now. It's sort of like the thing you've seen in Star Trek but with the lights dimmed, more sharp angles, and glowing stuff on the walls for no reason. There's a crowd of turtle-bug-things barking orders at each other. \n\nThey're Threll, but the Threll you've dealt with look nothing like these stupid things. The Threll you've dealt with //in your dreams//, that is. \n\n...Right?\n\n(Don't think about it too hard. That's how your head starts feeling spicy.)\n\nTheir big, scary leader appears on a big, scary hologram in the center of the room... \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ {{THRELL CAPTAIN}}\n[[/=]]\n+++++ {{SSSILENCE, YOU LOWBORN //FILTH!// The Massster speakssss...}}\n[[/div]]\n\n(Threll do //not// talk like that. ...you're not sure how you know this.)\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px\"]]\n+++++ {{//(The captain bows.)//}}\n[[=]]\n++++ {{THRELL CAPTAIN}}\n[[/=]]\n+++++ {{Oh, Most Gloriousss, Exalted, and Immortal Lord HAJHETI, the mighty Tarrare humbly welcomesssss your holographic presssence --}}\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++ {{HAJHETI}}\n[[/=]]\n+++++ {{Cease your noise.}}\n[[/div]]\n\n(HEY!

You don't tire easily, but you're a lightweight when it comes to boredom. Sometimes you have to dash in front of the pack and run around in a few circles to work off energy. (There's a 30% chance that you're secretly a cat.)\n\nThe sky darkens as the journey goes on. As do the buildings. As you get a better look, you get the feeling it used to either be an office building or a prison compound built after the Tarrare Incident -- and something burned it to the ground.\n\nThe closer you get, the less everyone talks.\n\nYou enter the shattered glass doorway in complete silence. Whatever happened here was worse than just a fire. There's a residual sadness here, something that washes over the whole gang as they enter.\n\nThere's a sign at the front desk -- but the smoke damage is too heavy to show anything but the vaguest outline of a circle with three arrows pointing inward.\n\nThere's a foyer area. A broken fountain. Plastic plants that melted.\n\nYou freeze.\n\nBack at Site-6800, when construction work was being done on your usual movie floor, you passed //this very fountain// on the way to the temporary location.\n\n...\n\nYou're home. The last you remember of it, the Fox had leapt into Dr. Fenwick's office. And two years later, there's nothing but ashes. Even someone like you can put the pieces together.\n\n...\n\nYou clap a hand over your mouth.\n\nAnything to stamp back a scream.\n\nCasey glances after you. He knows something is wrong.\n\nYou drop the whiteboard. Talking won't help, only stumping back the building scream in your throat -- trying to bash its way out of your mouth with an invisible battering ram.\n\nYou fall to your knees. Tears gather.\n\n...\n\nThere's no way Dr. Fenwick could have made it.\n\nBefore Casey or anyone else can ask you what's wrong, a familiar voice cries out from the other side of the foyer...\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Do you know what's the funniest part about the Tarrare Incident?##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n++ {{##FAFF91|FOX!

You were only human for as long as you believed. Your voice is the sound of crackling flames given thought and meaning, and the sound of it was the reminder you needed.\n\nYour shape struggles to maintain its humanity.

Your chest seizes up with unfamiliar emotions.\n\nYou stumble backward.\n\nThe floor where the deer once stood is now a red-hot curl of slag, as if someone had just taken a spoon from a pot of thick fudge.\n\nYou've seen this before. In your dreams.\n\n...\n\nYour body shrinks. You're as tall as Riordan once was, if you can even call yourself that anymore.\n\nThough your malleable body struggles to even step forward, you make your way to the stairs.\n\nThe journey is long and hard. You end up having to crawl for the last few steps.\n\nAnd once you reach the second floor, there stands the Fox, with an open Foundation laptop next to him.\n\nWithout a word, he slides the laptop in your direction.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp0013/offset/6 There's a document on the screen...]\n[[/=]]",
