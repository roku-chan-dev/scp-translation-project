I hope you enjoy my crazy rambles in the form of articles. I first got into scp my senior year of highschool. I would spend hours listening to youtube videos and drafting my set designs. Then the pandemic hit and I didnt get a prom or the first year and a half of college... fun.\n\nDuring the first year and a half of the pandemic I listened and read all that I could but it wasn't until November of 2021, where I would spend the longest time with my head in a sandbox. I would finally go further than dipping my toes in the water and post my first scp in the 8kcon and now Im gonna try and push further.\n\n+++ The Author\nI'm from the American Midwest, born and raised by a pair of hippies an hour outside of Dallas. I graduated with my Bachelor's of fine arts in 2024. I do overhire carpentry work and backstage work for shows in the DFW area. My dream is to become a full time scenic designer but before that I wanna work on shows performed on cruise lines, maintenance/upkeep and backstage.\n\nI love to watch a good movie franchise or binge a old series and enjoy life in the moment with my friends. When I'm lost or can't find my way when looking for my next project I'll always try and see if poetry will help. But I wanna create not just for myself but I wanna make concepts for the entire community and beyond to continue to use.\n\n\n+++ The Inspiration\nWhen I'm creating an idea I like to draw inspiration from my own life and the things that interest me the most. Whether that's what I'm currently interested in or something old. I love to read fantasy books and others media that predates me by about 70 to 100 years. Books from the 40s that talk about books from the 1800s.\n\nMy inspiration comes from all the media, news, history and other sources I consume on a daily basis or getting higher than a kite. I have a book from the 1970s about synonymes I use daily if that speaks to anything. But most importantly what inspires me are books I find and what I read on the wiki.\n\n----\n+++ Achievements\n\n[[=]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=srs]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n+ Thanks for reading!\n----\n[[/div]]",
