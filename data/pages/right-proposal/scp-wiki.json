I: REPORT\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 3/12/1954, [[[spc-140|SPC-001]]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]\"The Mistaken Beast\", a pataphysical selachian entity possessing primordial sway over the fabric of reality.[[/span]] successfully instigated a T/K/O “Unraveled History” Scenario, an event hereafter referred to as “The Disagreement”. This event, the subject of this documentation, is recognized to have been caused by SPC-001 devouring a considerable section of the timeline, which is recorded to have been the years 1800-1900 Anno Domini. Due to this, only thirteen individuals on the planet, the membership of Oracle, are capable of remembering events which occurred during this period, albeit with significant deviance from each other. Due to the Centre having been founded during this period, The Disagreement is believed to have been a deliberate attempt by SPC-001 to disrupt its operations.\n\nIt is recognized that consensus reality managed to survive The Disagreement without succumbing to a total temporal paradox or collapse of reality due to SPC-001’s pataphysical effects requiring the presence of the present era for its existing narrative[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]It is believed that due to the Centre being regarded as the primary threat, or \"main antagonist\" to the Mistaken Beast, it is unable to destroy it directly without altering its unchangeable narrative, requiring a third party to do so.[[/span]]. To this end, the timeline was not altered retrocausily and still acts as if the events during the erased years occurred despite their current nonexistence. All attempts to send individuals to the period via temporal deviant phenomena has resulted in the complete obliteration of the subject. Attempts to send the subject prior resulted in their obliteration occurring only once the annihilated era began.\n\nThe Disagreement is named as such due to the aforementioned failure to establish a complete chronology of the events which occurred during the erased period, as all thirteen recollections contain several conflicting points of interest. While there are significant points of agreement, they are dwarfed by the amount of historical inconsistencies. Due to the nature of these inconsistencies[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Specifically, arguments regarding the true \"Founder\" with the right to be the primary leadership figure of the Centre.[[/span]], a mediator, later designated as the High Pugilord, was conscripted to oversee the actions of Oracle during the defining of The Disagreement and was later deemed to be considered necessary for the Centre’s leadership from that point forward, being appointed for the role permanently.\n\nDespite the widespread nature of The Disagreement, the public has not been made aware of its existence. A majority of the population was unable to recognize that they could no longer remember the erased era following the event’s occurrence, allowing the Centre to establish a chronology based upon the points of agreement within Oracle alongside several approved alterations, which were publicly distributed as historical fact and are now considered the basis for historical events which occurred between 1800 and 1900.\n\n[[div class=\"divider\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section small\"]]\n\n++ CH. II: POINTS OF AGREEMENT\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following are several summarized points of agreement established by Oracle during initial discussion regarding The Disagreement. They have been placed into the file due to being specifically of interest and considered necessary to the report despite knowledge regarding multiple of them being available from public sources and other reference materials.\n\n* Within the erased era, a conflict referred to as “Benthic War //i//”, which was primarily fought utilizing extensive amounts of deviant technology, occurred. As per the agreed-upon description of this event, several Centre precursor organizations fought a hostile sect of the Sharkic Empire capable of operating on dry land who sought to subjugate significant portions of it for themselves. The war ended with the Centre precursors being victorious, with the Sharkics having lost their ability to operate out of water via a disputed method and driven back into the ocean.\n\n* Following Benthic War //i//, all Centre precursors had been almost entirely crippled of their resources despite their victory over the Sharkics. One of these organizations’ leaders elected to approach the others and asked to begin negotiations to consolidate their resources into a single force. After several months of deliberation, all precursor groups successfully unified into what would become the Centre under the leadership of Oracle, which was made up of the former leaders.\n\n* Napoleon Bonaparte, dictator of the United French Empire and major player in Benthic War //i//, was ousted from his position in a coup by a Centre-backed resistance movement after a deviant spell transformed him into an immortal Napoleon fish (//Cheilinus undulatus//). Following this coup, he was imprisoned on seventeen different islands, each farther and farther away from France, before escaping and reforming the Empire each time. After the eighteenth coup, he was only able to retake the now-independent island of Corsica, which he remains the leader of to this day.\n\n* It was decided during the compilation of all information regarding SPC-001 at the beginning of the Centre's lifespan that all data gathered on the entity was deemed too important to be entirely held within a single document. Instead, members of the Centre would be able to file different \"proposals\" regarding high-profile Projects, events caused by, or miscellaneous aspects of SPC-001 to ensure the information remains on separate files. The first of these lesser documents was to concern SPC-001-RIGHT, otherwise known as The Disagreement.\n\n* During Benthic War //i//, Theodore Roosevelt, former professional wrestler and American politician known for Sharkic Cult involvement, briefly ascends to the status of an [[[scp-8820|Apex-Tier Pluripotent Entity]]] after an extensive Sharkic ritual. At the same time, members of the Boatswains of the Cog of God awakened an [[[twistedgears-kaktus-proposal|incomplete version]]] of the Cog of God using a false engine. The two entities proceeded to engage in Mexico, resulting in extensive damage to the landscape and the creation of the Sea of California. The two are recognized to have destroyed each other after several weeks of continuous, destructive battle.\n\n* Benthic War //i// left many countries vulnerable and unprepared to domestic attacks. As such, the territory known in the modern day as the Union of American States was overtaken by a revolution led by Joshua Norton, a homeless man from San Fransico. He was crowned Emperor Norton I, who proclaimed the as area part of his new empire. However, despite his charisma and intelligence, he had little to no ability to run a nation, eventually leading to the dissolusion of this empire into what would become the Union soon after. Despite his defeat, it is possible that Norton is [[[scp-4004|still alive]]].\n\n* A vicious squaloidohazardous attack from the attacking Sharkics during Benthic War //i// led to a brief period where New Zealand was thought not to exist by a majority of the world's population, including many within New Zealand. While it eventually wore off, it managed to continue beyond even the erased era as a fringe conspiracy theory believed by several-thousand individuals.\n\n* Prior to the founding of Poseidon Laboratories, an unnamed precusor organization supplied both sides of Benthic War //i// with powerful deviant technology. However, after realizing their operations would be heavily taxed upon the Sharkics taking power, the organization exclusively began working against them, supplying weaponry to the other side of the conflict at a discount.\n\n* One of the Sharkics who came out of the ocean during Benthic War //i// met with two wealthy businessmen operating within America and proposed going into business together, with the three eventually forming Marshall, Carter, and Shark Ltd.\n\n* The territory recognized in the modern day as the Jianese Federation experienced a conflict referred to as the \"Boxing Glove Rebellion\" when part of the population, outraged by its government's support of the Sharkic Empire in Benthic War //i//, began attempting a takeover of the country. While most Centre precursors were too occupied with the primary conflict at the time to assist them, they were able to spare a large surplus of boxing gloves, which was sent to the revolutionaries. It was these gloves that the rebellion got its name from after their victory.\n\n[[div class=\"divider\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section small\"]]\n\n++ CH. III: DIVERGENT OPINIONS\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following are statements provided by each member of Oracle regarding their view of the events that occurred during the era consumed by SPC-001. None are to be considered part of the official chronology regarding events which took place during the period in question and continue to remain under scrutiny.\n\n[[div class=\"oracleouter\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-1\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nLet it be known before you read the words of everyone else here, I am the one with the most claim to be on the throne as leader.\n\nI was there on the front lines of the Benthic War. I raised my fists against the selachian menace and I punched with the fury of over 9000 steamrollers as we rained down our hellfire onto those horrific monsters. It was glorious, as if we were warriors who had been sent down directly from Valhalla to fulfill our destinies in life. When the dust settled, people looked to me for guidance as to where we should go next, and it was guidance that I was sure to grant them.\n\nIt was I who went to everyone else who led their inferior, though still skilled, groups together after our victory and enlightened them to the idea that we must all join forces. Then, The Disagreement hit. SPC-001 took something else from me that it somehow hadn’t before. It took the very claim I had to leadership of this organization I built with my own damn two hands. It is disgusting, horrible, and I will never stop us from moving endlessly towards it in our unceasing march for freedom from the selachian menace.\n\nI have the memory. I have the enthusiasm. I have the skill. Do you truly have any doubt that it was I who founded our glorious organization?\n\nThough, overall, is there no greater argument than the fact I was dubbed O-//1//?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-2\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nBack before the days of the Centre, I led a noble group dedicated to the entrapment of the selachian menace across the planet. When we were conscripted to enter that Benthic War, I saw everyone else raise their fists, even those within my own following. They saw it as the most effective means of reaching their own end, simple violence above all else. It’s true, we were in war, but that does not mean one has to forsake the ideals that got them to where they were.\n\nWhen everything was said and done with, we were all part of one organization together. I was given nothing more than a token leadership position due to my previous standing and memory of what we began to call SPC-001-RIGHT. I’m one of the few in this group that knows for a fact I have no claim to the leadership position, but I’ll be damned if I could remember who approached me to join this whole thing. It was all a blur after a while. Lost some good people out there, and all I could do was watch as they //punched// in their final moments.\n\nOne way or another, I will not forsake containment. I will not stop doing what I was put on this planet to do. As a member of Oracle, they can do little to stop me, anyway. They gave me this position and I will use it however I am able to ensure my art does not die out like a smoldering flame. I will punch in the light if it means I can contain in the dark.\n\nWith or without the Centre, I promise you I will continue my mission.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-3\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nDo not forget that the mundane has suffered as much from The Disagreement as the deviant has. While many of the events in Benthic War //i// were the direct result of deviant events, it was our job to define both the normal and the abnormal. While the others don't, I remember a world where this was the case, and it was glorious.\n\nThe divide between the two has proven to be an irreversable faultline, one we cannot ignore. I have strived for the rest of Oracle to see my view, that we must protect the mundane from the deviant. They often ask me how we would even accomplish such a thing, and I give them the same answer every time: just hide it.\n\nIf we ensure no one can see or remember something, they will no longer know it exists, and they'll be able to live in peace and harmony. The deviant will be covered by a sheet... a Veil.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-4\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nIt's been a long, long time since Benthic War //i//.\n\nMuch like One, I was there on the front lines of the war, fighting the good fight. Back then, I had the strength to punch nearly anything, but now? Now, I'm just an old, battered man. My muscles are barely defined anymore. My old anchor tattoo I got when I first became a sailor has faded to a dull gray. I hardly remember the memories that once made me different, not enough to tell you much other than small things.\n\nInside me, I no longer feel the bloodlust I once did, the fire in my heart to do what was right. I promise that even if I can't punch, I'll still be right here behind it all, guiding as best I can. I'll be the pen signing on the documents if I can't be the fist in a selachian's putrid face. And once they recognize who truly got us all together, I'll be the one sitting where the High Pugilord sits right now.\n\nThere's something I learned a long, long time ago, and it still continues to ring true to this very day:\n\nWar, war never changes.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-5\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nBefore Benthic War //i//, there was an event I remember that no one else on Oracle does: a drought.\n\nNow, this wasn't the type of drought you're probably imagining in your head right now. We had plenty of water. Hell, we //always// have plenty of water. What I'm bringing up was a drought of selachians.\n\nMy men and I, we roamed the world nomadically, hunting for selachians and protecting those who couldn't defend themselves. We were an honorable bunch back then. At least, we were, until the drought came. It was terrible. No selachians could be found anywhere, leaving us to... pugilate each other.\n\nThen, the war started, and we managed to get our heads back in the game, but we never really fully recovered from what transpired during that horrible era. Though we will be free of them one day, this world is not fit to live without selachians, something to punch, yet. At least, not until we finally rid it from SPC-001 once and for all.\n\nAs a member of Oracle, my [[[spc-2000|grand design]]] will soon unfold, and I can make sure we will always have enough selachians to punch.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-6\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nDown in America, we have a saying. I can't exactly remember what it is right now, but rest assured that it validates what I'm about to say: we should be using guns.\n\nThink about it. If we [[[spc-001-ex|paint little fists on the bullets]]], it would be like we're punching them from a distance, and not like that Project we assembled a while back out of a bunch of trebuchets and giant stone fists. This is a real solution to our current issue of being mostly limited to close contact combat.\n\nI used to be the leader of the Union of American States' Center for Institutionalized Impacting, and we were about to implement my idea there before Benthic War //i// hit and, well, the whole world went to shit. Then, after The Disagreement, no one who used to be part of my group, nor the rest of Oracle, even remembered we were going to do this! If only I could prove to everyone else that I'm supposed to be the leader here, too, and they'd all see my reasoning.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-7\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nWhile, on paper, its said that only the membership of Oracle remembers events taken away by SPC-001, at least in our own ways, I don't think thats true.\n\nI remember that, one day, I was allowed to sit in at a meeting with the higher ups in Wilson's Wildlife Foundation, or the WWF for short. A man I had never met before happened to sit next to me, and we got to talking. He knew who I was and, of course, knew what the Centre was. However, what I was not expecting was for him to know a bunch of other things too, things only we as Oracle had remembered prior, which we had scrubbed from public databases.\n\nWhile he feigned partial ignorance at my confusion, I could tell he knew what he was doing. He had this look of smugness on his face I couldn't otherwise explain. Before I could ask him how he knew so much, he was called up to speak at the meeting, and I realized who I had really been talking to that entire time.\n\nThe man was Tim Wilson.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-8\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nWhat no one else will tell you is that there were many other organizations beyond our thirteen fighting in this war, because the rest claim that they \"don't remember\". Personally, I think that's a load of crap. They claim to not remember this because of how embarrassing it was.\n\nThe others were just as, if not more powerful than we were. We were the runts of the litter and we came together to form something greater because if we didn't, well, you know the saying of sharks coming after blood in the water.\n\nI was the one who coined the term \"Groups of Finterest\", and the assurance we keep tabs on these other groups who think they can measure up to us is what will keep us around for many years, just like we all want.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-9\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nParticularly, I've never been concerned with The Disagreement, at least, not after we defined everything that happened. No, what concerns me is that this all may happen //again//. What's stopping the Mistaken Beast from simply chomping down on the timeline again, erasing more and more until nothing is left? We cannot simply stand by and risk this happening another time. In the world //I// remember, I'm pretty sure it did. Though, it wasn't one I could remember as clearly as this.\n\nIt was I who initially declared SPC-001 should be the Mistaken Beast, and outlined what an SPC should //be//. Fists on their own are worth a lot, but sometimes you just need that little something extra to really pack a punch. Our Projects have shown that our experimentation and augmentation on the deviant, no matter how risky they may be, are worth it at the end of the day. SPC-001 will cower before our fists, someday, somehow.\n\nWhen you are fighting against something that can eliminate time itself, the selachian which ensures we are to suffer until it is gone, the ends justify the means.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-10\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nAs much as the others want to ignore it, I know for a fact that, someday, an [[[spc-6500|Impasse]]] will be upon us. Five's little toy and the oceans won't be able to sustain us until we are able to reach the Mistaken Beast. Much like the drought he claims to have seen, I remember something very similar.\n\nHowever, when //we// ran out of sharks, we decided to... accept it. We began trying to move past things, but then Benthic War //i// hit, and we realized it was all for naught. We cannot let ourselves be lost to such a mindset again, lest we not only lose what gives us purpose, but our very timeline as well.\n\nThere has yet to be a timeline where the Centre exists where the Mistaken Beast is finally pugilated once and for all, but I will be making sure that once we survive the Impasse, we will be the first.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-11\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nConflict has marred my nation of [[[spc-1810|Hawai'i]]] for ages now, and I can assure you that Benthic War //i// was no different. My people and I joined alongside all of those organizations whose leaders joined alongside me to create our glorious Centre. Then, SPC-001-RIGHT hit, and no one else on Oracle even remembers I was there!\n\nTruthfully, while I know deep down it was I who inspired us all to come together, I am content not to fight the others on it, as long as they allow me to remain a member of Oracle. I am already the emperor of the Hawai'ian Islands and Oceania, so what more could I possibly want when I already have all that?\n\nWell, I'll tell you: I want SPC-001 punched right in its selachian face, and I want us to be the ones to do it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-12\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nI remember that at the start of all this, a few among us, such as Three, floated around the idea of a \"Veil\", or some safeguard to protect the rest of humanity from knowledge of the deviant. After all, we had already agreed to hide the true nature of SPC-001-RIGHT from them, so what was one more lie at the end of the day?\n\nWhile such an idea may have been necessary if humanity was not faced with a menace as horrific as the Sharkic Empire, the fact of the matter is that our Projects inspire ideals of heroism in the common people. They see us with our powerful deviant technology and realize that humanity still has a chance to fight back, to //punch// their oppressors instead of serve them.\n\nA Veil is not only an egregious waste of resources, but actively detrimental to rallying others to our cause. I remember a world where we used to have one, and it was horrible. As long as I am on Oracle, I can promise you I will be working as hard as I can to ensure such a thing never comes to fruition.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF O-13\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nHonestly, I don't know why I'm here.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n...\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nWould be cool to be the leader, though.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nTo date, none of the statements made by an individual member of Oracle have been proven by any means as having been part of the true timeline of events. Further study remains ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"divider\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section small\"]]\n\n++ CH. IV: FURTHER EFFECTS\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThough The Disagreement has already occurred, the aftermath of the event continues to manifest within consensus reality, specifically as a poorly-understood timeline adherence failure phenomenon. Specifically, the act of SPC-001 devouring a section of the timeline has resulted in significant temporal fragmentation throughout various events in world history both before and after the consumed century. This phenomena, referred to as “cracks” have visibly formed across nearly all of the timeline, subsequently leading to the widespread alteration of history.\n\nWithin this fragmentation, cracked events are known to have had multiple outcomes that various amounts of people remember, even within the Centre. Due to this, inconsistencies in both world events and Centre documentation regarding several details of history are expected to contradict each other in subtle ways, otherwise referred to by the Pataphysics Department as \"loose canonicity\". At the time of writing, very little of history is affected, leaving these affected events to be few and far between.\n\nThe fragmentation remains primarily concentrated around the initial era affected by SPC-001-RIGHT, but cracks are slowly starting to stretch out, with no known way to counterract their spread. It is very well possible that this may eventually lead to a complete eradication of timeline comprehension if left unchecked. The Centre's Temporal Deviance Department has been established with the sole goal of ensuring this does not occur, but it remains unclear if there is a way through which it can be halted.\n\nCurrently, Oracle is attempting to compile a full list of agreed-upon events throughout all of world history in a similar manner to the era affected by The Disagreement in hopes the Centre's documentation will be able to remain accurate. However, due to the nature of such a task and Oracle's positions also requiring them to assist in the operations of the Centre, it is expected to not be complete for several years.\n\nIt is also possible that this fragmentation may eventually become so severe that a [[[ouroborealis|differing, lesser timeline]]] splits off from the primary one.\n\n[[div class=\"divider\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section small\"]]\n\n++ CH. V: CONCLUSION\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following is a transcript of a statement made by the High Pugilord following the definition of The Disagreement during a meeting of Oracle.\n\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ STATEMENT OF THE HIGH PUGILORD\n\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nMy friends, I know that this is hard, but we cannot afford to lose ourselves in crisis. We sit on the precipice of a new era, one with a force capable of actually beating back the selachian menace once and for all. Before, we were divided, but now? Now, we can pool together our fists into a fury capable of battering even the Mistaken Beast up above.\n\nI know many, if not all, of you wish to be the one to guide us in the face of this crisis, but rememeber that it takes more than just one finger to form a fist. As Oracle, you are meant to be the best of us. This is no time to squabble over who has that small, extra little bit of power over the rest of you. What does such a thing accomplish in the long run? At the end of the day, we are all pugilists.\n\nI cannot promise that there will not be hardship, but I can promise that we are now the force best suited to deal with it. For the good of the Centre, for humanity, and for the world, this is the burden we must bear. And when we do finally strike, SPC-001 will not know what hit it. Or, well, maybe it will.
