Climate controls are to include complete control over temperature, moisture, and a fire prevention system. \n\nSCP-8903's containment chamber must keep a constant temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, with a ±2 degree deviation allowed. A relative humidity level of 70% must be maintained, with a ±5 percentage points deviation allowed. Note that deviation is measured in overall relative humidity of the containment cell.\n\nSCP-8903 must receive a simulated rainstorm every day at a random time for exactly 8 minutes and 54 seconds. The simulated storm is to produce 127–254 mm of water. No deviations of any kind are permitted.\n\n--A lighting system is not required for SCP-8903, and can be left in darkness.--\nAs of 25/02/202█, a day-night cycle has been implemented into SCP-8903's chamber, with an unknown amount of deviation allowed. Between the hours of 06:00 and 18:00, constant light must be shone onto SCP-8903. Otherwise, no light can be presented to SCP-8903 in any capacity.\n\nAny prolonged deviation of specified conditions outside of testing is to be reported to Dr. Enkei.\n\n++ **Description:** \nSCP-8903 resembles a bonsai tree of unknown species. No record of discovered bonsai trees match SCP-8903's description. SCP-8903 currently measures at 83 cm in height, and has a diameter of 23cm. The leaves of SCP-8903 are all 2cm in height, 3.5cm in width, and 0.2cm in depth. All other aspects of SCP-8903's physical appearance are unremarkable.\n\nSCP-8903 shows a consistent growth rate, that being 1.2cm/week in height. However, this growth rate is slowed when appropriate conditions are not met. The growth rate has shown no signs of increasing, even when feeding SCP-8903 various fertilizers. This would indicate SCP-8903 being approximately 1.3 years old, although it is unknown if this growth rate has been halted before.\n\nSCP-8903 is planted within a pale blue ceramic bonsai pot, with writing on the underneath reading \"You are what you are.\" However, this writing is only visible when SCP-8903 is not under optimal conditions. Any attempt to remove SCP-8903 from its pot is strictly prohibited.\n\n SCP-8903's primary affects occur when optimal conditions are not met. When conditions are not met, SCP-8903 will begin to alter its surrounding area gradually. Over time, if conditions are not met, the affected area under SCP-8903's influence will begin to widen at a proportional rate of the deviation. SCP-8903 does not seem to be affected by the changes it incurs, remaining perfectly healthy, besides the rate of growth slowing.\n\nIt is currently unknown whether SCP-8903 has a \"maximum\" area of influence, however the possibility of there being //no// maximum area has halted testing of extreme deviations of optimal conditions. Any testing must be approved by Dr. Enkei.\n\n++ **RECORDED ALTERATIONS:** \nThe record of all observed alterations, the area, and the expanse of the area have been tabulated below. All deviations lasted 6 hours, unless specified otherwise.\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 1500px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 3px solid black; background-color: black; width: 20%;\"]]\nType of Deviation\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 3px solid black; background-color: black;\"]]\nEffect on Area\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 3px solid black; background-color: black;\"]]\nEffect on Organisms within Affected Area\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 3px solid black; background-color: black;\"]]\nExpansion Rate\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 3px solid black\"]]\nTemperature falling __below__ optimal levels\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe overall temperature of the affected area fell dramatically to -89.2 degrees Celsius over the 6 hour period, averaging in a drop of -18.5 degrees per hour. Any heating applied to any room besides SCP-8903's chamber had no affect, however the wearing of heat retaining clothing did serve its purpose normally.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAll flora within the affected area died within 1 hour of deviation. Most fauna within the affected area died within 2 hours of deviation, with bigger animals lasting up to 3 hours. No human life was lost, besides D-8456, whom died to frostbite 2 hours from deviation.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAffected area expanded at a rate of 22 meters per hour. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 3px solid black\"]]\nTemperature raising __above__ optimal levels\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe overall temperature of the affected area rose to 56.7 degrees Celsius over the 6 hour period, averaging in a rise of 5.8 degrees per hour. Any cooling applied to rooms within the affected area failed, besides that applied to SCP-8903's chamber.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nMost flora survived, with 32% of flora present in the affected area dying from hyperthermia. No fauna within the affected area was harmed.

All fauna within affected area died within 30 minutes. 8 Class-D subjects within affected area died within 30 minutes. Upon autopsy, it was revealed that each Class-D had no water present within any parts of their bodies.\n**Any further testing of relative humidity deviating negatively has been prohibited.**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nIt is currently unknown at what rate the affected area spreads.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 3px solid black\"]]\nRelative Humidity rising __above__ optimal levels\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nRelative humidity within the affected area began to rise steadily until humidity reached 100% within the 6 hour period, averaging at a raise of 5.6% per hour. Any water that was produced within the affected area would vanish when transported outside of the affected area.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAll flora within the affected area survived, with an average growth boost of 22% recorded. No changes to fauna were recorded. One electrician working on a fuse box died due to electrocution within the 6 hour period. All repairs are prohibited when SCP-8903 is being tested. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAffected area expanded at a rate of 21 meters per hour.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 3px solid black\"]]\nSCP-8903 Being Under Watered\n**EXPERIMENT TERMINATED AFTER THREE HOURS**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAll clouds within affected area vanished instantaneously.

Even when experimentation was terminated, affects lasted approximately 36 days.\n**NO TESTING OF OVER WATERING SCP-8903 IS PERMITTED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nDue to the size of the affected area, it is currently impossible to determine damages to any organisms outside of Site-██. Within Site-██, 25 personnel were not recovered, with 12 being severely injured. Site-██ was promptly locked down after 30 minutes of deviation. \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 3px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAffected area expanded at a rate of 183,4 kilometers per hour, reaching a maximum area of 2220.895 within 12 hours. Even when termination of deviation, the affected area grew. It is currently unknown whether SCP-8903 has an even bigger area than that recorded. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n\n++ **ADDENDUM 8903-01:** \nOn the 23th of February,202█, at 00:00, all light sources within a 500 meter radius from SCP-8903 ceased operation. This includes, but is not limited to: flashlights, phones, light bulbs and bio-luminescence produced by specific fauna. Moonlight and starlight was unaffected. \nSite-██ was initially put under high alert, and a nearby security team located at Area-██ was deployed to the Site. At approximately 00:23, a Security operative's flashlight began to operate normally when inside SCP-8903's containment. \n\nUpon shining their flashlight towards SCP-8903, all light sources within a 523 meter radius began to operate normally again. It was determined that SCP-8903 had grown a dependency on light level, on top of all of its required conditions.\n\nA lighting system was installed within SCP-8903's chamber, with permanent lighting presented inside of it, however, at 18:00, all light sources within a 500 meter radius began to emit 500% more light than what  was expected. Light sources only returned to normal operation after the lights in SCP-8903's chamber were turned off. \n\nSee revised Special Containment Procedures.\n\n++ **ADDENDUM 8903-02:** \nOn the 16th of March,202█, at 13:32, Dr. Enkei and Dr. Perl attempted to remove SCP-8903 from its pot.\n\nAs soon as SCP-8903 was lifted, an earthquake of magnitude 3.2 occurred at Site-██. As more force was put into lifting SCP-8903 was applied, the earthquake rose instantly to a magnitude of 6.7. Both Dr. Enkei and Dr. Perl stopped their attempt to raise SCP-8903 from it's container, as soon as SCP-8903 was placed down normally, the earthquake ceased.\nSignificant damage to Site-██ was recorded, with damages costing $428 million. No containment breaches occurred.\n\n\"It is currently unknown at what magnitude removing SCP-8903 from its pot would cause, and I want to keep it that way.\" \n-Dr. Enkei.\n\n**ALL ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE SCP-8903 FROM ITS POT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED**\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8902]]] | SCP-8903 | [[[SCP-8904]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
