Although referring to them as gods would be theologically presumptive, many of these beings are regarded as divine by members of specific [[[Groups of Interest]]], and there is evidence indicating that many SCP objects currently in containment originate from the actions of one of these entities. Although some attribute the apparent existence of all allegedly divine beings to the anomalous effects of belief on the Akiva Field, evidence for the existence of many of these entities precedes any worship of them. Given their demonstrated anomalous ability and uncertain constraints, many members of the Foundation simply refer to these beings as **Pluripotent Entities**.\n\nThe Parareligions Division of the [[[tactical-theology-hub | Department of Tactical Theology]]] presents the following list, not as an endorsement of the divine status of any of these beings, but merely as a summary of claims that have been made about them, and a compilation of the best evidence available to us at this time. This document will be continually revised to reflect new developments in the field.\n\n[[# broken-god]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub| The Broken God]]]\nKnown as [[[v19113a-01| MEKHANE]]] by the Cogwork Orthodox Church and the [[[so-the-beasts-shall-plague-the-land-no-more| ancient]]] [[[nadox-and-the-mekhanite| Mekhanite]]] [[[scp-2406| civilisation]]], as [[[about-the-serpent| Father Serpent Fuxi]]] by the [/system:page-tags/tag/xia-dynasty Xia Dynasty], and as [[[wans-image-png| WAN]]] by the Church of Maxwellianism. Other related sects refer to the same entity as [[[scp-6217| Holos]]], [[[beneath-two-trees| Hakhama]]] or [[[excerpts-regarding-st-sophia| Sophia]]]. All of these groups have claimed to be reassembling the fragments of their deity (in the case of the Maxwellians, [[[corruption| compiling]]] it from human minds and [[[implanting-god| digital data]]]), although exactly how this being was originally \"broken\" is disputed. \n\nThe object of their worship is consistently associated with knowledge and technology, often described as a [[[scp-6217| \"universal machine\"]]], and its followers have attempted to achieve closer communion with it through the [[[rounderhouse-gold-proposal | replacement of body parts with prosthetics]]] since [[[fratricide | ancient times]]], often utilising [[[scp-217| anomalous means]]]. It is also frequently depicted as being in [[[scp-2217|opposition]]] to the [[[scp-610| FLESH]]], which the Church of the Broken God [[[scp-6166| associates with]]] [#yaldabaoth Yaldabaoth] and the [[[sarkicism-hub| Sarkic Cults]]], a dichotomy that bears resemblance to Gnostic theology.\n\nWhile many of the [[[scp-3179| claims]]] made about the Broken God are clearly more myth than history, any [[[broken-mind|attempt]]] to bring together [[[scp-882| multiple]]] [[[scp-1139| anomalous]]] [[[the-tick-tock-gospel| artefacts]]] in order to [[[twistedgears-kaktus-proposal| \"reassemble\" this entity]]] will be opposed by the Foundation as a threat to normalcy. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[# brothers-of-death]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [/system:page-tags/tag/brothers-of-death The Brothers of Death]\nAlso known as the [[[about-the-serpent| Lords of Death]]], the Small Death, the Great Death, and the All-Death are described as each ruling over death on a different scale. Known for their connection to [[[SCP-1440]]] and [[[SCP-032]]], and [[[death-and-the-doctors-hub| perhaps]]] with [[[SCP-049]]]. Interaction with these entities is [[[now-you-find-out| allegedly]]] [[[empty-nights| possible]]], but is strictly prohibited without authorisation from the O5 Council.\n\nIt should be noted that the Brothers are not the only [[[tanhony-s-proposal| entities]]] identified as [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii| personifications]]] of [[[scp-6292| \"Death\"]]], and there [[[scp-8004| may be many more]]]. [[[scp-2935| Research]]] is [[[scp-3448| ongoing]]] in order to better understand the [[[scp-4260| anomalous aspects]]] of the [[[end-of-death-hub| concept of \"Death\"]]].\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# starfish]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ The Cosmic Starfish\n\nThis extradimensional entity is revered by the various manifestations of [[[fifthist-hub| Fifthism]]]. Although each of these cults emerge independently and interpret their faith differently, they share a fixation on the [[[beneath-the-council| number Five]]], as well as an association with [[[scp-1425 |stars]]], [[[scp-1534| starfish]]], [[[scp-1982 | smoke]]], [[[prologue-water-coalesces-and-descends-as-rain| music]]] and [[[scp-3005| the color pink]]]. There are always five branches of Fifthism, [[[scp-2456| dating back]]] [[[stephane-the-apostles-epistle-to-the-palmyrene| to antiquity]]], with the Group of Interest re-emerging in a new form whenever [[[disillusionment| a branch is disbanded]]]. These new recruits typically come from within an existing [[[scp-5982| spiritual]]] or [[[the-broken-fifth | religious]]] [[[pink-cracks-in-a-digital-wall| community]]], influencing the exact form their new religion takes. The Cosmic Starfish has also been independently discovered by members of the Foundation investigating a [[[scp-5800| five-dimensional space containing volatile abstract concepts]]], as well as during a [[[scp-6659| deicidal search for a truly transcendent being]]]. \n\nThe entity worshipped by Fifthists is believed to be, at least in part, the [[[SCP-3125]]] entity contained by the Foundation's [[[antimemetics-division-hub| Antimemetics Division]]]. This would mean that a connection also exists between Fifthism, the \"missing number\" [[[SCP-033]]], and the antimemetic body part [[[SCP-2828]]].  Fifthist religious texts have also indicated [[[fifthdation| an antagonistic relationship]]] between this being and the anti-narrative [[[SCP-2747]]], which they personify as the \"Lord of Non-Existent\", and associate with [[[why-is-five-afraid-of-seven| the number seven]]]. However, even after the [[[scp-5502| apparent death]]] of [[[inverted-swiss-cheese| this Fifthist entity]]], [[[kte-5503-bice-copernicus| manifestations of Fifthism]]] have continued.\n \nA connection has also been proposed between Fifthism and the [[[war-on-all-fronts-hub| Large Scale Aggressor]]] responsible for [[[lte-0851-cetus| the destruction]]] of [[[nx-03| the island of Hy-Brasil]]]. Fifthist sects regard this [[[scp-5437 | five-armed and five-eyed monstrosity]]] as an [[[embracing-the-angels| angel sent by their god]]], although these claims have been met with scepticism.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# gate-guardian]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [[[dr-clef-s-proposal | The Gate Guardian]]]\n\nAn immense humanoid figure with a variable number of wings, armed with a sword and continually surrounded by fire. It is located in Iraq, at the intersection of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and appears to be guarding a gateway [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii | leading to a garden]]]. Although clearly divine, it is not believed to be a deity, and has instead been identified as a [[[kte-5503-bice-copernicus | \"Type Bice\"]]] entity, more commonly known as an angel. While there is substantial evidence indicating that it falls within the purview of the Abrahamics Division, which have documented a number of other \"messengers from God\", it cannot be known for certain exactly which deity (if any) this being represents.\n\nThe Gate Guardian is capable of compelling obedience to any command it gives, seemingly without limitation. While observers are usually told to \"FORGET\", a small number are tasked with [[[themission | a different mission]]], including [[[scp-073 | one individual]]] compelled to \"[[[REMEMBER]]]\", and another ordered to \"[[[scp-4960 | PREPARE]]]\". [[[clavis | Intercepted transmissions]]] indicate that this entity may play [[[the-gate-opens | a key role]]] in an XK-Class [[[competitive-eschatology-hub | End-of-The-World scenario]]], and so decommissioning has been considered. However, no method proposed could be guaranteed to succeed without also risking the hastening of eschatological events.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# hanged-king]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [/system:page-tags/tag/hanged-king The Hanged King] \n\nAn anomalous entity alluded to in [[[SCP-701| The Hanged King's Tragedy]]], as well as [[[the-hanged-king-s-tragedy | a number of other]]] [[[scp-2732| theatrical productions]]], which typically end in an [[[scp-7838| outbreak of mass hysteria and violence]]]. Although initially believed to be fictional, the Hanged King was discovered to be [[[a-wandsman-in-the-court-of-the-hanged-king| the ruler]]] of the [[[scp-2264|extradimensional city]]] of [[[locations-of-interest#alagadda | Alagadda]]], with the only surviving witness describing the Hanged King as a [[[clown-town| \"god-shaped hole\"]]]. [[[theology-of-a-snake| Mythologised accounts]]] of the Hanged King's origin disagree on whether he [[[about-the-serpent| hanged himself]]] or was [[[and-so-the-crows-laughed| hung by]]] his own people. This \"hanging\" may also be interpreted as symbolic, representing the entity's status as a liminal being, neither alive nor dead.\n\nThe Hanged King [[[the-hanged-king-s-comedy | rarely appears in person]]], except to [[[masks-monsters-merchants| the most distinguished guests]]]. It is [[[incident-report-scp70119971 | usually represented]]] by the [[[scp-5075| Ambassador of Alagadda]]], a powerful thaumaturge responsible for [[[scp-6500| multiple attacks]]] on Foundation personnel. Additionally, Four Masked Lords have been identified as overseeing Alagadda on behalf of the Hanged King.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The Four Masked Lords\" hide=\"The Four Masked Lords\"]]\nDuring the initial exploration of [[[SCP-2264]]], the following anomalous entities were documented: \n* The Black Lord, Wearer of the Anguished Mask. Currently exiled, [[[midnight-parade | contained]]] as [[[SCP-035]]], [/system:page-tags/tag/possessive-mask \"The Possessive Mask\"]. \n* The White Lord, Wearer of the Diligent Mask.\n* The Yellow Lord, Wearer of the Odious Mask.\n* The Red Lord, Wearer of the Mirthful Mask.\nAlthough unconfirmed, it is likely that all four of these entities are literally the masks they wear. The four colours they are associated are the only colours that exist within Alagadda, and also have a notable equivalence to the [[[restoring-harmony|four stages of the alchemical]]] //magnum opus//, the process required to create a Philosopher's Stone.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# jalakara]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ JALAKÅRA of the Impenetrable\nThe patron deity of the [[[three-moons-initiative-hub| Three Moons Initiative]]], JALAKÅRA is a powerful reality-bending entity native to [[[locations-of-interest#corbenic| Corbenic]]], depicted as a [[[ill-be-home-for-christmas| gigantic spider]]] with a human face and a beard. In exchange for [[[scp-7578|energy]]], [[[scp-7157|resources]]] and [[[wielka-altana| divine protection]]], the Initiative provides JALAKÅRA with [[[scp-5319| worship]]], servitude, and the final word in all their administrative matters. Almost all communication with JALAKÅRA is mediated by the 13 members of The Central Cabal, as the only other person permitted to directly address JALAKÅRA is Eternal President Niang, the [[[radical-acceptance|Founder of the Three Moons Initiative]]].\n\nAlthough the Foundation is limited in its ability to [[[scp-2922| gather intelligence on Corbenic]]], it is clear that JALAKÅRA is not the only powerful anomalous entity resident to Corbenic. One of the Initiative's [[[scp-3768 | most persistent foes]]] is [[[operation-galahad | SCP-PC-007]]], known to the Initiative as HÉKATI-BØGAL, the \"Witch-Queen of Bogal Mountain\". During the initial colonisation of Corbenic, [[[scp-3319 | direct intervention by JALAKÅRA]]] was required to defeat this entity and achieve victory in the First Harvesting War against the Striders. Additionally, JALAKÅRA is a member of a pantheon of [[[scp-7922| eight \"princes\"]]] that date back to the [[[the-lithopedion| creation of Corbenic]]]. While JALAKÅRA was previously revered by the tribes of Corbenic as a deity of silence, labor, modesty, obedience, and bureaucracy, patronage of the Initiative and their powerful military forces has [[[scp-7702| undoubtedly elevated JALAKÅRA's status]]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The Eight Princes of Corbenic\" hide=\"The Eight Princes of Corbenic\"]]\nArising from the shattered mind of [[[the-lithopedion| a stillborn god]]], the Eight Princes are:\n* KHUUM of the Eightfold Jewel (or Eightfold Star), First Star Prince of Corbenic, and eldest of the princes. Depicted as an eight-armed hybrid of a stork and a dragon. Supposedly possesses [[[scp-7941|a mystical fire whose radiation generates life]]], which it uses to create stars in universes devoid of living beings.\n* NÅZHDAK of the Eternal Hunt, Second Hunt Prince of Corbenic. Depicted as a seven-headed ferret holding a saxophone-like device. A deity of wildlife and ferality, infamous for its fixation on [[[dyfscp-001|particular Corbenese species.]]] Research on this entity temporarily halted due to [[[scp-7922|security concerns]]].\n* ABBAD of the Red Crater, Third Vermin Prince of Corbenic. Depicted as a centipede holding a scimitar. Known brother to JALAKÅRA, and father to another deity only known as \"[[[dyfscp0012|Grandma]]]\". Interviews with the ☽☽☽ Initiative representatives regarding the entity failed to uncover further information, as all contacted members respond only by claiming it to be a \"[[[stella-secundus|thankless, useless, mooching, incompetent worm that smells absolutely wretched.]]]\"\n* MUZD of the Everkiln, Fourth Fire Prince of Corbenic, and second eldest of the princes. Depicted as a flaming hawk holding a large hammer. A deity of flame, art and construction. Supposedly the owner of a court managed by one \"[[[scp-7702|Traufek the Sagebeast]]].\"\n* ROUM of the Drömglänta, Fifth Love Prince of Corbenic. Depicted as a humanoid deer holding a branch; consistently drawn with a seductive stare. Further information is unknown.\n* HAJHETI of the Primrose Deep, Sixth Sea Prince of Corbenic. Depicted as a sea turtle with several human hands, holding a flute. A deity of commerce, trade, and hierarchies – its descendant species, the Threll Dominion, dedicate their lives on conducting business throughout multiple dimensions. Related doctrine heavily focuses on subjugation as a fundamental part of life. As such, [[[dyfscp0013|Thrells use other organisms as tools in place of machinery]]], a notorious practice that has declined relations with HAJHETI followers and the ☽☽☽ Initiative.\n* JALAKÅRA of the Impenetrable, Seventh Order Prince of Corbenic.\n* VUOOU of the Murk, the forgotten Eighth Prince of Corbenic. Appearence unknown; all known depictions have been disfigured beyond recognition. Scolded by all other Corbenese deities, who they refer it as the \"Parasite,\" due to its  [[[scp-7702| obsession with cruelty and suffering]]].\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# queen-mab]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [/system:page-tags/tag/queen-mab Queen Mab]\nThe entity now contained within Site-01 as [[[ralliston-s-proposal|SCP-001-C]]] was once an [[[cos-tu-smierdzi|ancient Fae monarch]]], with some of the most powerful thaumaturgic and ontokinetic abilities ever documented.

Despite the [[[wniosek-o-dotacje-na-opracowanie-srodka-przeciwko-alergii| great harm]]] she inflicted on her former subjects, a number of [[[kte-6990-mendel-nimuebusterchild| Fae organizations]]] remain [[[ambrose-esterberg| loyal to her]]] and seek to [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub| restore her to life]]].\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# orcadia]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ [[[seas-of-orcadia-hub| Orcadian Pantheon]]]\nWorshipped by the [[[seas-of-orcadia-hub| Finnfolk of Orcadia]]], also known as //Homo aquarius//, the Orcadian Pantheon consists of thirteen entities, each having deep religious meaning and significance to their followers. Originating on the astral plane, each god has its own defining aspects and characteristics, with some of them [[[scp-3703|imprisoned]]], while others [[[scp-4700|remain free]]]. \n\nThe worship of this pantheon is concentrated around the Orkney Islands, but comparative religious analysis has confirmed that the members of this pantheon of deities include entities documented elsewhere, including the [#broken-god Broken God], [#yaldabaoth Yaldabaoth], the [#cosmic-starfish Cosmic Starfish], and the [#scarlet-king Scarlet King].

Ortothans believe that these entities were survivors of an [[[pattern-dwellers-an-expose| earlier universe]]] (\"The First Hytoth\"), and continually fight to protect this universe (\"The Second Hytoth\") from [[[scp-3417|hostile extrauniversal entities]]] known as \"Voruteut\". \n\nAdherents to this parareligion regularly make [[[let-the-winds-send-you-onwards| sacrifices of blood]]], which they claim are necessary to [[[scp-6695| sustain]]] their divine protector. [[[a-real-actual-blood-cult | These sacrifices]]] are considered to be especially important now that Rakmou-leusan fights alone. [[[scp-2417| Descriptions of Rakmou-leusan]]] provided by his worshippers emphasise his warrior prowess, his long list of heroic accomplishments, and his unwavering determination to continue his battle.  \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The Koru-teusa\" hide=\"The Koru-teusa\"]]\nThe Holy Seven revered by the [[[second-hytoth-hub| Church of the Second Hytoth]]] are, in order:\n* Zeyu-leusan, the Holy First. Original leader of the Koru-teusa, after discovering the method of the Seven's apotheosis. Died defending the early universe against the First Invasion of the Voruteut.\n* Uron-leusan, the Holy Second. A divine swordsman, wielder of two swords ripped from the fabric of space. Attacked Eov-leusan in a jealous rage, resulting in both their deaths. Allegedly the parent of [[[scp-7381 | The Valterians]]].\n* Eov-Leusan, The Holy Third. Reclusive craftsman, constantly refining three canons of unmatched power.  Attacked by Uron-leusan in a jealous rage, resulting in both their deaths.\n* Rakmou-leusan, The Holy Fourth. Four-armed bearer of the Four Spears, weapons capable of folding into any shape necessary. The only remaining survivor.\n* Nesren-leusan, The Holy Fifth. Master of psionics, forgotten by the Orthothans until too late. Believed to have falled victim to an [#starfish unknown entity] that erased awareness of their existence, depriving Nesren-leusan of the Ortothan bloodletting required to survive.\n* Yorun-leusan, the Holy Sixth. Holder of six staffs, known as the Holy Mage. A major influence on Ortothan thaumaturgy. [[[scp-5471 | Died in the year 2000]]]. [[[scp-7046 | Still mourned]]] by many members of the Church.\n* Myran-leusan, The Holy Seventh. All information about them has been lost, [[[scp-2747| as if they never existed]]].

All of these titles combine a word signifying the [[[scp-6996| color red]]] with a term for [[[beneath-the-council| royalty]]]. The entity these epithets refer to is worshipped by various cults, including the [[[scp-6019| Children of the Scarlet King]]] and the [[[blood-in-the-water| Church of the Scarlet King]]], but also by many other [[[scp-3178 |religious sects]]], with the Scarlet King [[[tears-and-bone| being reinterpreted]]] [[[christ-in-scarlet-hub| every time]]]. \n\nDespite great variation in how the Scarlet King is worshipped, he is invariably associated with authority, violence and masculinity. He is typically depicted as having [[[ scp-6462 | Seven Brides]]] and as the leader of a [[[lord-goran| Scarlet]]] [[[lord-jeser | Horde]]], and is frequently associated with [[[scp-475|cephalopods and cetaceans]]]. The Scarlet King [[[beneath-two-trees| has been connected]]] to the [[[daevite-hub| Daevite Empire]]] described in [[[SCP-140]]], as part of a [[[empire-of-dirt-part-1| pantheon of gods]]] [[[the-trashfire| worshipped by the Daeva]]]. However, this may be a [[[SCP-6140| misinterpretation]]] of [[[rounderhouse-jade-proposal| actual  Daevite beliefs]]].

[[[narrativistics-and-you| This hierarchy]]] is hypothesised to contain all of existence, with every reality being [[[i-h-p-proposal | shaped by stories]]]. \n\n[[[scp-6747| Current research]]] by the 'Pataphysics department is particularly concerned by these \"author entities\" [[[to-pulp-the-fiction| apparent interest]]] in the anafabula classified as [[[SCP-2747]]]. This anti-narrative [[[a-quiet-night| entirely erases]]] any story it appears in, and so is, at least in theory, an existential threat to our reality.  Documents recovered from the [[[fifthist-hub| Fifthist Church]]] describe this specific set of narrative components [[[fifthdation| as an antagonistic entity]]], consistently associating the  [[[why-is-five-afraid-of-seven| \"Lord of Non-Existent\"]]] or [[[scp-5317| \"Lady of Black Thorns\"]]] with the number seven. [[[tools-and-their-uses | Research is ongoing]]] to identify [[[all constituent elements of SCP-2747]]], in order to prevent them from occuring outside fiction. [!-- This is deliberately a deadlink, I am very clever.--]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# yaldabaoth]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ Yaldabaoth\nAccording to [[[sarkicism-hub| Sarkic mythology]]], Yaldaboath is the [[[scp-3391| principle power in the universe]]], the creator and destroyer of all life. It is known by many epithets, including Važjuma, the [[[scp-4884| God-Eater]]] and the Womb of Chaos. Although widely used in Sarkic contexts, the name \"Yaldabaoth\" originates from Gnostic theology, which regarded the creator of the material world as a demiurge, the would-be usurper of the purely spiritual true God. Scholars of both Sarkicism and early Christianity are investigating the extent to which these two faiths influenced each other.\n\nYaldabaoth has also [[[about-the-serpent| been depicted]]] as a rival and sibling to [[[scp-6166| MEKHANE]]], the [#broken-god \"Broken God\"], although many members of the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub| Church of the Broken God]]] regard this association as heretical. [[[party-of-gods| Portrayal of them as lovers]]] is [[[hist-327-comparative-mythology-of-mekhanism-and-naelkae| even more controversial]]]. It should also be noted that in Gnosticism the demiurge is described as the son of Sophia, the personification of wisdom, and \"Sophia\" [[[beneath-two-trees| has been used]]] as an alternative name for the Broken God.\n\nSarkic theology typically regards Yaldabaoth more as a [[[an-anthropological-approach-to-sarkicism-case-study-04-house| force of nature]]] than as a god, with most proto-Sarkic sects regarding it with fear and disgust rather than reverence. Various Sarkic religious texts and oral traditions describe the historical Person of Interest known as Grand Karcist Ion being granted power by Yaldabaoth's [[[lord-goran| six subordinate Archons]]] after [[[on-the-origins | passing certain ordeals]]]. In some versions of the myth, Ion's abilities are interpreted as a sign of Yaldabaoth's approval, but most accounts describe a much more [[[scp-5480 | antagonistic relationship]]], with Ion forcibly seizing power from Yaldabaoth itself, wearing its flesh as armor and creating the Kingdom of Adytum from its body. While religious claims should not be interpreted literally, the abilities of [[[memoria-adytum| modern Karcists]]] still require explanation, and an investigation into their origins is ongoing. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[# about]]\n+ About This Page\n\nThis page is an extension of the [[[Personnel And Character Dossier]]], intended for characters that don't fit neatly into the Persons of Interest or SCP Objects tabs. While some of these are documented in SCP formats, those articles rarely capture the full scope, and \"person\" is not really the right word for these characters - they're not all considered gods, but they may as well be. Note that there is no canon on the SCP Wiki, and deities seem to be particularly open to multiple interpretations, so these descriptions deliberately include links to conflicting information.\n\nThis list is open to new additions by any member of the site. It is primarily intended for tagged characters, but any powerful anomalous entity that appears in at least 3 articles can be added to the list (SCPs, tales or GoI formats - appearances on author pages, hubs and collaborative logs are not counted). Avoid adding characters here rather than on the Personnel And Character Dossier unless there really is no better place for them. [[[SCP-343]]], although allegedly God, is listed as alongside other SCP Objects, partly because he was originally described in an SCP article, and partly because there's deliberate ambiguity as to whether he's actually \"God\" or just another powerful reality bender, and we have plenty of those listed as characters already. Anomalous prophets and messiahs like [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub | Robert Bumaro]]] and [[[sarkicism-hub | Grand Karcist Ion]]] were also deliberately left off this list despite being somewhat divine, since they're at least one step down from the entities listed on this page, and so don't seem too out of place on the Persons of Interest list.\n\nFor certain characters on the list, collapsibles have been included to list what might be considered their \"supporting cast\". In some cases this is the pantheon they are part of, in other cases their notable subordinates. Since there are a number of articles that draw connections between the various gods listed on this page, these collapsibles are primarily for characters that otherwise wouldn't warrant inclusion on this list.\n\nI want to emphasise that this is a fictional resource on parareligions, and so deities worshipped by a living religion in the real world should not be added to this list, even though many of them appear in articles on the SCP Wiki. The reason for this rule is that there are plenty of sources elsewhere if people want to find out more about the Abrahamic God, and we'd rather keep this page focused on fiction, and avoid edit wars with theological implications. Entities like [[[dr-clef-s-proposal | The Gate Guardian]]] can be added to this list, as they are original to the SCP wiki despite referencing real-world religions.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
