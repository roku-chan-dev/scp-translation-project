In a sudden and unusual bout of collaboration, the Nevada Gaming Commission and Research and Preservation Site-666 have come to an agreement: the Strip has to be closed for business in the next two days.\n\nThis may come as a surprise to the least informed or the most stupid of you. We all know that Vanguard (the current managers of Site-666 and the //Luxor Vegas Hotel and Casino//) has been trying to shut down the strip for the better part of this last year on account of the Washington Virion. According to them, Undervegas and its earthly counterpart have become the hotspot of the epidemic, and it's in no small part due to the casinos' reluctance to close down. But the NGC and its allies on the underside of the city have held fast to their ideals. And what was their reasoning behind this? According to them, demons cannot fall sick to mortal illnesses. This fact had held true, at least until Ebenezer Shax, owner of the Augustus Palace, fell mysteriously ill last week and stopped performing his renowned magic tricks.\n\nThus, the scramble for control began. According to our sources, the GNC in full folded to Vanguard's demands. Of course, Ba'al, the Lord of the Flies himself, stated that he would continue doing business as usual in a secret meeting we were privy to. \"The chips must flow\" he said, to the seemingly ecstatic audience gathered in the Moneypit.\n\nIn response, Vanguard convoked a press conference in the Luxor. And their spokedemon (one Agent Calendar) had this to say about the whole ordeal: \"If anyone of you doesn't follow the quarantine protocols I'll have you know that I have full permission to rip out your spines and use them as coat-hangers. And I don't even own a coat!\" Sources in the Moneypit tell us that since this declaration, the greed demons have calmed down significantly, but there's no telling what the future holds.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:void-post\n|profile-pic=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Roasted_coffee_beans.jpg/640px-Roasted_coffee_beans.jpg\n|username=Dive Simmons\n|handle=Davethebrave\n|void-msg=I miss coffee.\n|echoes=6,724\n|hums=19,402\n|time-and-date=07:04 AM ¬∑ Sept 22, 2049\n]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Broadcast Name:** \"Radio Free Genosha,\" an indie podcast and pirate radio show\n\n**Broadcast Location:** unknown location near Kenosha, Wisconsin\n\n**Host:** anonymous individual using the name \"Antithesis\"\n\n**Broadcast Focus:** The //X-Men// franchise, leftist politics\n\n**Broadcast Date:** 25/09/2049\n\n-----\n\nMagneto was right.\n\nThe Washington legacy virus has proven that peaceful coexistence with humanity is impossible. For the second time, humankind has chosen to annihilate us, despite the equal risk to itself, for no crime but being born better than them. Though calling the Impasse the first time would not truly be accurate either, for the Impasse was but the culmination of centuries of containment and witch-hunting, was it not? Parahumans have never been safe amongst the flatscans, no matter how hard the starry-eyed idealists of Vanguard or the race traitors of the Global Occult Coalition might try to convince us otherwise.\n\nHave we forgotten that these organizations were the ones who caused the Impasse? Have we forgotten the Ichabod campaign? I certainly have not. I remember all too well the way anomalies were forced to be the Foundation‚Äôs child soldiers, coerced into killing their own kind by the Coalition, or scrapped for reality anchor parts if we were not useful enough while alive. We have only ever been slaves and tools to these people, and though they may have changed their names and faces they still cannot or will not protect us, as the Washington Virion proves.\n\nAnd just as surely as this is not the first time, it will not be the last. Dan Crenshaw campaigned on our oppression and extinction, and millions of people voted in favor of it. Do you think this pandemic will teach them what the Impasse did not? Do you think they will ever learn the consequences of striking out at their ontological superiors? Of course not. For in the eyes of a //Homo sapien//, these things are our fault. We brought this upon ourselves, we forced Crenshaw‚Äôs prejudiced hand, by having the audacity to exist, to be different. And if we dare to survive this latest attempt on our collective lives, it will only be a matter of time before the purple robots start breaking down our doors.\n\nSo what are we to do? Join with Vanguard‚Äôs meek efforts to prove that we are worthy of existence? Convince the Coalition that locked us in here with the monsters that we are more useful alive than dead? No. The dream of Vanguard, of Charles Xavier, is dead. Magneto was right. So I urge you, paranormal listener -- when you are ready to forsake the weak and thankless brood that spawned you into this hateful world, come and join me in anomalous brotherhood.

Secretary Graham has been accused of numerous alleged charges in the past including embezzlement, bribery, extortion, verbal and physical abuse, perjury, gross misuse of amnestics, and conspiracy, but was [[[chronicle-of-the-worm|pardoned by President Crenshaw]]] during his first term after many years of a long, drawn-out case. In the meantime, Secretary Graham worked as a conservative lobbyist, quickly climbing the ranks of American politics as a charismatic far-right politician, eventually becoming a key figure in Crenshaw's second-term administration.\n\nSecretary Graham claims that his statements were altered and taken out of context by malicious actors within \"far-left online sects\" [sic!].

Some consider it highly suspicious that the GOC is creating their own anti-cognitohazard infrastructure, rather than supporting the existing but underfunded protective systems currently utilized by social media companies and consumers.\n\nWhile the number of congitohazards spread over the internet has risen over the past decade, the deadliness of these events is lower than ever thanks to software such as MindGuard and Cognito-Ward.
