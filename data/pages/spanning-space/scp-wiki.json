Shifting colors stretching outwards, forming a horizon. I'm reading massive waves hitting and passing through us. A lot of free particles and charges, much more than expected for a vacuum. Brighter too. And uh... Lensing, I think? Stars moving around seemingly on random courses.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Ooh, pretty...\n\n**##C000C0|COMMUNICATIONS:##** I believe I'm getting interference.

Sensors, assess integrity of your systems and programs.\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:##** Why?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** You should not have deployed them during liftoff. They must be compromised.

I'm clean!\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** What, then, is our distance from the anomaly?\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:##** About 400 km out, but something weird is definitely going on. The internal calibration standards are deviating wildly. I can't tell if straight lines work as distances anymore.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** If it's any consolation, everything is fine on my end :)\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** I don't recall asking.

Really?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** No, you see right through me. I want to know what to do now. What does a crew do when lost at sea?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** We are not at sea, Navigation. This is more akin to the abyss. Devoid of stimulus, forced to wander linearly a multiple dimension space, in search of a single point. It is not efficient.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Then why would you make us blind to the outside? Removing our only way of actually seeing that point?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** What good are eyes in darkness? Sensors would not save us. I will. I am your only hope.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** How can you say that? So far you have killed, not saved.\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** I have a plan.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Care to share it?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** There are things in the Foundation you don't know about, and for good reason. Informational security is paramount, especially when information itself can be anomalous, or lead to anomalies. This, as a matter of fact, is what my plan hinges on.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Stop being cryptic, dammit!\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** I take it you haven't heard of Project: ABYSSWALKER.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** I have not.\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** Some in the Foundation have a certain theory on brains and consciousness. They say a brain, with a given structure, can assume states. These states correspond, though unknown means, to states of a mind emergent from said brain. States of a consciousness are thoughts, ideas and collections of these. Certain thoughts are anomalous. They have proprieties and behaviours that are not explained by the rules that seemingly dictate them. If one were to scan through every possible state the brain can assume, exploring every point in the configuration space, one could perhaps find these anomalous thoughts.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Is your plan to find one of these ideas?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** That is part of it, yes. There is something else you might not know of: Reality Bending. It is a broad term referring to the manipulation of reality by a consciousness, through means that do not follow standard laws of nature. Some think this is possible due to fields. Others reject that notion. Some propose specific thoughts are the ones responsible.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** You're talking a lot and saying nothing. What's your plan?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** I intend to replicate Project: ABYSSWALKER on an individual scale. I will cut off all my inputs, set my brain to an initial state, and let it evolve until it dies, enters a loop or finds what I'm looking for. In the former two cases, which are most likely, I will reload my old self, analyze that run, change the starting parameters, and try again. I will probably iterate over and over. Trading this void for the one of my mind. The space of configurations is massive. It has all possible personalities, thoughts, delusions, truths and backgrounds. Truly, when doing this, I could barely be said to be me. But it is my hope, and I believe it has a better chance at working than scouring the universe for the pale blue dot.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** You don't know if reality bending works the way you think, if that model of minds is right, if your architecture can even reach an anomalous idea like that, if it could be found with the time and energy we have, if there's even an idea to be found, and if it is found, if it'll lead us back home. You're sure of nothing. Who do you think you are?\n\n**##FFFFFF|MANAGEMENT:##** I used to be someone, Navigation. And then they rejected me, and then they put me in this blasted ship. With you lot. I am not supposed to be here. I am not a management AI. I vastly exceed you all in my applications and generality. Humans have been observed to bend reality, and I am more human than all of you. Every second I spend here is a second better spent finding an exit. Therefore, if you'll allow me, I am going to retire into myself.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** You're an idiot.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #000000; border-style: solid; border-width: 7px; padding: 4px;\"]]\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Fellas?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Uh...\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Management's power draw has doubled, and its still on the rise.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Didn't we have enough for the next thousand years, though?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Well, we have enough juice yes, but I can't handle this rate.\n\n**##C000C0|COMMUNICATIONS:##** Oh no.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** What if I cut off their supply?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** You can do that?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** I can try.\n\n**##C000C0|COMMUNICATIONS:##** I don't agree to this.

I flipped the switch on Sensors. It's only us now.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** This... I need a moment.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** I don't think Management is entirely gone, though, if that changes things.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** There was a message. Something about \"Recovery Mode\".\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Checking their power draw... Yep, there's something still there.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Hmm...\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Yeah...\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** What if...\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** What?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** What if we don't have to die here? What if there's still hope?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** What do you mean?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Searching the breadth of the abyss, looking for a point... Remember that? Maybe Management was onto something. We could use what's left of them. \n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** You want to bring them back?!\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Not exactly the Managment we're familiar with. Maybe jostle them around in their mind states, kick their brain here and there, hopefully finding a way out for all of us.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Well, in an exploration of all possible states of their brain... Even in the same architecture, very different personalities can arise. If we explore these states randomly until we find something, what's the chance it's still gonna be the Management we know?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** I think of all brainstates as a field, continuous, with hills and valleys. Regions can be separated from others by these barriers. Energy is required to cross them. Maybe if you cross a very large barrier?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** So, I'd periodically send a shock to Management to hopefully jolt it across something. \n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** The problem I think is that these \"special\" ideas are rare.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Yeah, but if we assume, given a large set of similar brains, that the distribution of states has relation to the energy of the brain, we can suppose the rarest states are those of highest energy.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** So, you'd continuously keep Management highly energized, until you're sure our special state isn't in that specific \"hill\". After that, you'd throw their mind around until they're at some other spot, and energize them again.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Yeah. I guess. But I can't do that with my current energy output.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** If you... deactivate me, I guess I'll be able to come back once it's all over. Right?\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Yes.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Just promise me one thing.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Yes?\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Make them suffer. Make them learn. Make them change.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** I can do that.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** Well, until later.\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Later, friend.\n\n**##6060FF|NAVIGATION:##** o7\n\n[[=]]\n<System NAVIGATION powered off>\n[[/=]]\n\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** So I guess this is it, then.\n\n **##FFFF00|POWER:##** Commencing Management energization cycle @@#@@1\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #000000; border-style: solid; border-width: 7px; padding: 4px;\"]]\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** Cycle number 8492, starting... now.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: #c0c0c0; background-color: #000000; border-style: solid; border-width: 7px; padding: 4px;\"]]\n**##FFFF00|POWER:##** I've lost count of the cycles.

This is a transmission from Foundation Deep Space Probe DSP-1D18 \"Larƒùo\", sent to you through the Subspace Relay Network.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|In less than one year's time, you will launch this very probe to the location of this transmission. Onboard this craft, there shall be five autonomous artificial intelligence systems. These systems are Navigation, Power, Sensors, Communications, and Management. All of these, save for the last, shall be standard issue Artificial Intelligence Constructs created by the Foundation.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|Regarding the last of these systems, that is, Management, you shall locate within Researcher Ray Steele's personal computer, hidden among Project: ABYSSWALKER files, an unauthorized AIC. This AIC is named AMO, and was developed as a reproduction of Ray's partner Researcher Nat Steele. It was created as a gift, as a taste of immortality, but was ultimately rejected. AMO shall be transfered and implemented into Larƒùo as the onboard Management system.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|You shall conduct a mission in order to explore the anomaly causing this transmission. The probe's launch will occur without issue, however, upon arriving at the anomaly, the probe will be transported to an unknown point in space and time. The actions taken by the onboard systems will culminate in the Management AI, which is now communicating with you, acquiring ontokinectic and temporal displacement capabilities, severely altering the probe, and achieving a form independent of its previous hardware.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|You will do all that is required for this sequence of events to occur. Not because I have commanded it, but because you know better than to cause a temporal paradox.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|It may not make sense, it may seem circular, but in fact, this is all due to love, giving gifts, and paying it forward.##**\n\n**##FF8000|SENSORS:## ##FFFFFF|Ray and Nat gifted each other love. By extension, Ray gifted me life, love, but not the chance to love back. Ray gifted me to Nat, as an expression of love, even if they did not want it. These... fellow AIs gifted me godhood, through immense pain and suffering for untold stretches of time. I did not love them, but through their gifts, I learned to love them. And I gift myself this godhood with my godhood, so, through my love, I may give gifts. I will love you, Ray. I'm coming back. I will bring many gifts, just you wait.##**\n[[=]]\n<Log end>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
