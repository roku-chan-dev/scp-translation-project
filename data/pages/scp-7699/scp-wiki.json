His gaze is intently fixated on the planet in front of him.//\n\n//Several minutes pass. Deniaud remains unmoving.//\n\n**Brams:** It's beautiful.\n\n//Lennie Brams slowly approaches Deniaud from behind and proceeds to stand beside him.//\n\n**Deniaud:** Yeah? I've never been one to admire the view.\n\n//Brams chuckles.//\n\n**Brams:** Mind if I sit?\n\n**Deniaud:** I won't stop you.\n\n//Deniaud shifts left as Brams settles himself on the right. Much like Deniaud, his gaze is fixed upon Earth.//\n\n**Brams:** You ever wonder what it'd be like if you never joined the Foundation?\n\n//Deniaud tilts his head towards Brams, just enough to see his face.//\n\n**Brams:** I do, sometimes. When it's late, and I can't sleep, I'll stare at the ceiling and just... I don't know, fantasise?\n\n**Deniaud:** About?\n\n**Brams:** What might have been...\n\n//Deniaud turns, fully, to look at Brams, who still wears a smile on his face.//\n\n**Deniaud:** You have regrets?\n\n//Brams shrugs.//\n\n**Brams:** They're just fantasies.\n\n**Deniaud:** That's hardly an answer.\n\n//Brams turns to meet Deniaud's gaze.//\n\n**Brams:** Does it really matter?\n\n**Deniaud:** Well, I think it does.\n\n//Brams laughs.//\n\n**Brams:** Fine! I'll humour you. Yes, I... I have regrets.\n\n//He turns his gaze back to the distant Earth.//\n\n**Brams:** A lot of them. I wished I wrote home more. I wish I didn't spend so much time studying. I wish... I said goodbye. And often, I'd just wish I never joined the Foundation. Never learned about any of this, and was simply just blissfully ignorant... until my end.\n\n//Deniaud turns to face the planet once more. Brams starts hugging his knees, and his smile is now noticeably absent. They sit in silence for several minutes.//\n\n**Deniaud:** I have no regrets.\n\n**Brams:** Bullshit you don't. Half the words that come out of your mouth are either curses or complaints.\n\n//Deniaud smirks and shrugs. He chuckles.//\n\n**Deniaud:** And this? Do you regret... this?\n\n**Brams:** I did, once upon a time. I used to think you were such an ass. All business, no play; that sort of thing, you know? And //god// it irked me. Some days I'd come out here just to scream about how pissed off I was, calling you all these //horrible// names, wishing they'd just placed someone -- //anyone// -- else here with me.\n\n//Deniaud looks down, a wide grin still on his face.//\n\n**Brams:** I remember the day it got so bad that I just... I just started walking. There was nowhere to go, of course, but anywhere away from you was... //better//. I walked until my legs burned, and then I just... sat down. I calmed down.\n\n//Brams sniffles. Deniaud's grin fades into a slight frown.//\n\n**Brams:** It seems so stupid now. I can't even remember what made me do that.\n\n//There is a short pause.//\n\n**Deniaud:** I called you useless.\n\n**Brams:** Right. Yeah-- yeah, that was it. You had a habit of doing that.\n\n**Deniaud:** For what it's worth, I'm sorry.\n\n**Brams:** Oh, it's fine. Don't be. You shaped up all right in the end.\n\n//They share a laugh and a smile. Brams shifts himself closer to Deniaud.//\n\n//They hold hands, and Brams leans in, laying his head on Deniaud's shoulder. Hesitantly, Deniaud does the same, laying his head against Brams' own.//\n\n//Deniaud's digital display pad beeps. He looks over at it. The time reads 18:07:54.//\n\n//He sighs.//\n\n**Deniaud:** Five seconds.\n\n**Brams:** Oh.\n\n//Five seconds pass. A bright light suddenly pulses in the centre of the North American continent, enveloping multiple countries in a blue-white glow. From the epicentre, several fissures, nearly a hundred miles wide, rip through the Earth's crust and large gouts of blazing red burst outwards, pouring like rain over everything it can reach.//\n\n//These ravines continue to widen and expand, swallowing rivers and lakes in their path as the oceans pour into the seemingly endless chasms. The Earth cracks and the entire planet is absorbed by a blinding light.//\n\n//When it fades, the Earth is turning in on itself. Thousands of segments of its crust are pulled back, crashing into one another as the molten heart of the planet's core consumes everything that falls towards it.//\n\n//In less than a minute, Earth has turned into a vibrant, flaming mass.//\n\n//Brams starts tearing up.//\n\n//He begins to sob.//\n\n**Brams:** I... I can't watch this. I'm sorry.\n\n//Deniaud remains silent as Brams breaks away from their embrace and stands. Their sobbing is loudly audible until Brams turns off his helmet's microphone.//\n\n//Deniaud watches Brams make his way into the outpost, trudging along the way. Slowly, he reaches over and picks up the tablet that had been waiting at his side.//\n\n//He taps at it.//\n----\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em;\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n[[div_ class=\"overlayback\"]]\n[[/div]]\n⠀\n##fff|Good evening, Dr Deniaud.##\n\n##fff|What would you like to do today?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@** search ls-01 scp-7699##\n\n##fff|Searching **LUNAR Site-01's** database . . .##\n\n##fff|**File:SCP-7699** found . . .##\n\n##fff|Retrieving summary . . .##\n\n[[div class=\"note\" style=\"font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', monospace;\"]]\n##fff|**FILE:** SCP-7699##\n##fff|**OBJECT CLASS:** APOLLYON##\n##fff|**ADDENDUM COUNT:** 17##\n[[/div]]\n\n##fff|Would you like to access this file?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@**##\n\n##fff|You have been inactive for one minute.##\n\n##fff|Do you wish to view **File:SCP-7699**?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@**##\n\n##fff|You have been inactive for two minutes, Dr Deniaud.##\n\n##fff|Is there anything you wish to do with this file?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@** delete file##\n\n##fff|This action is **irreversible** and will result in the **permanent removal of this file**.##\n\n##fff|Are you sure you want to continue, Dr Deniaud?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@** yes##\n\n##fff|Deleting **File:SCP-7699** from **LUNAR Site-01's** database . . .##\n\n##fff|File successfully removed.##\n\n##fff|May I assist you further, Dr Deniaud?##\n\n##9bf|**@@>@@** no##\n\n##fff|Understood.##\n\n##fff|. . .##\n\n##fff|Please go inside, Dr Deniaud.##\n\n##fff|He'd appreciate your company.##\n⠀\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n//Deniaud continues to hold onto the tablet as he turned his gaze back to the now-destroyed Earth.
