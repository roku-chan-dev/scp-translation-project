The Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, and the Unusual Incidents Unit have entered into a temporary agreement to identify themselves to the public under the umbrella of a single entity titled the “Sourcery Initiative.” Disinformation claiming that SCP-8320 is an isolated incident and the only extant anomaly is currently being propagated, with pseudoscience explaining the phenomenon in non-anomalous terms currently being devised.\n\n--Instances of SCP-8320-1 are to be detained using remote detonating thaumaturgical anchors and handled by no fewer than 7 armed personnel trained in anti-magic combat.--\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 are to be shot in the head on sight.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8320 is a phenomenon globally affecting all domestic cats. Although this effect is fully reversible and does not inherently harm the animal, the resulting increase in intelligence, dexterity, and anomalous ability has resulted in the spread of populations and the misplacement of many house pets. The effect was caused by Eric █████, a 23-year-old resident of Brentwood, New Hampshire, known henceforth as PoI-8320. PoI-8320 has been missing since June 4, 2025, the date SCP-8320 initially occurred. From evidence recovered at the scene, SCP-8320 was likely caused by PoI-8320’s attempt to use some manner of anomalous item (missing) to turn his cat (also missing) into a “magical creature.”[[footnote]] Taken from PoI-8320’s notes.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-8320 and the ensuing events began instantaneously at 3:08am on June 4, 2025, when every member of the species //Felis catus// [[footnote]]Domestic cat or house cat [[/footnote]] suddenly transformed into Type Green humanoid reality benders, designated instances of SCP-8320-1, all with common physical characteristics.\n\nObserved common characteristics within instances of SCP-8320-1 include:\n \n* Very elderly, regardless of the age of the original animal\n* Long-haired and bearded, regardless of sex of the humanoid\n* Wearing large hats, usually pointed or otherwise eclectically shaped\n* Wearing floor-length robes, tunics, or capes in bright colors, often embroidered with simple shapes like stars or crescents\n* Carrying wooden staffs or wands\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://i.imgur.com/GZHPDo9.jpeg|caption=Instance of SCP-8320-1]]\n\nInstances of SCP-8320-1 are observed to be of greater safety risk to the public when many are present in a small space. The instances appear to be immensely territorial, and will frequently employ anomalous measures to eject other instances from their perceived territory. These conflicts have resulted in significant property damage through the use of anomalous abilities, but relatively few civilian casualties. SCP-8320-1 instances are almost always friendly to humans in spite of their massive aggression toward one another.\n\nCommon SCP-8320-1 behaviors that present a danger to the public include:\n* The spontaneous creation of narrow, but very tall stone towers\n* Throwing balls of fire, bolts of electricity, or other concentrations of energy at other SCP-8320-1 instances with disregard to surrounding structures, people, or wildlife\n* The creation of small, localized weather events (primarily thunderstorms)\n* The attack and consumption of small poultry (pigeons, game hens, etc.)\n _\n _\n-----\n _\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8320/lostposter.jpg|\ncaption=Handmade poster found near the residence of PoI-8320. |\nalign=center |\nwidth=50%\n]]\n _\n-----\n _\n _\n++ Addendum – Lifted Veil Scenario 8320\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\nWe have a very big problem on our hands and that problem has appeared in the form of about 700 million wizards.\n\n//- Memo from Dr. E.

Embedded Foundation agents and social engineers are currently working to keep public knowledge of anomalies limited to SCP-8320 specifically, perpetuating the idea that SCP-8320 is a singular, isolated incident.\n\nPrior to the discovery that SCP-8320-1 instances originated from cats, the Foundation apprehended several instances for containment and questioning.\n _\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:audio-player-woed-source\n|unique-name=secretparty (only words, no numbers)\n|audio-file= http://radraddzonezone.wikidot.com/local--files/home:home/Log1.mp3\n|background-color=rgb(252, 252, 252)\n|border-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|border-radius=0.313rem\n|dropshadow-color=rgba(12, 12, 12, 0.15)\n|text-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|icons-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|player-color=rgb(215, 215, 215)\n|progress-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n]]\n\n**NOTE:** Instance SCP-8320-1 was captured near Site-109 shortly after SCP-8320 took effect.

Site-109 created a specially-designed mobile vehicle for apprehending instances, equipped with anchoring and anti-magic devices. Force was used at a much lower frequency when it was discovered that most SCP-8320-1 instances will enter containment willingly upon being told something of interest is in the vehicle, like a grimoire or a bird. In an attempt to gather information about the origin of SCP-8320, instances were captured and held in the back of the vehicle, where agents would ask them simple questions. Upon determining that the instance did not have an appropriate level of intelligence to reliably answer additional questions, the instance was neutralized with a non-anomalous hand gun, and released as close to the capture location as possible. Site-109’s SCP-8320 reconnaissance team captured and neutralized several SCP-8320-1 instances using the following line of questioning.\n _\n\n||||~ Where did all the wizards come from? ||\n|| Lucian the Garrulous || “From over the tallest mountain and through the widest river.” ||\n|| Oswald the Itchy || \"From off the back of a very large turtle.\" ||\n|| Mazdor the Overconfident || “From my mummy and daddy.” ||\n _\n\n||||~ What are your goals or intentions here? ||\n|| Axar the Lackadaisical || \"I have come to save the kingdom from the wicked demon Lostharnac.\"[[footnote]] No such demon exists [[/footnote]] ||\n|| Thaddius the Nasty || \"To be perhaps some sort of healer or other man of science to serve the unwashed masses.\" ||\n|| Jeremy the Trespasser || \"I'm running away from death.

It is also noted that this method of neutralization can result in the creation of specimens of recently-extinct bird species.[[footnote]] The oldest example having gone extinct in 1891.

As I was saying-\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** It’s finally getting better. I can tell we’re toward the end.\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** Finally. This has been the longest four months of my life.\n\n//[Agent Nitt joins the call]//\n\n**Agent Nitt:** Sorry. \n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** What is it this time?\n\n**Agent Nitt:** I forgot this was today.\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** Anyone have updates on the wizard black market?\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** I hear Dark is getting awfully invested in it. Been trading them all over. Lots of countries jumping on the chance to repopulate their native birds. Very lucrative. \n\n**Agent Nitt:** Terrible idea. Only a matter of time before one of them shoots a fireball through the wall of an airplane. \n\n**Dr. Ogg:** One of them //already// shot a fireball through the wall of an Anderson joint. I guess it didn't like being //in// the bubbling cauldron.\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** We can be happy they’re gullible. After all, look at New Zealand. It worked out for them.\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** What about New Zealand?\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** Solved their cat overpopulation problem and their bird under-population problem in one go. Set up a “grand wizard tournament” on top of a vacant lot full of a healthy amount of buried plastic explosives. They didn’t even lose any of the animals. We’re looking into it. Some of our researchers are a little worried about the hypothetical implications of explosion-proof songbirds.\n\n**Agent Nitt:** A “grand wizard tournament?”\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** They-\n\n//[Dr. Weatherwax sneezes.]//\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** Bless you.\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** It’s the only way they could get so many of them in one place without starting a fight. An uncontrolled fight, anyway. Told them they were going to compete to see who was the best wizard.\n\n**Agent Nitt:** What’s left? Are you going to disband your task force?\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** They’re already disbanded, mostly. Just a few squads taking care of the stragglers out in the rural areas. \n\n**Dr. Ogg:** I thank God they’re so easy to find. You don’t even have to //look// to find those towers.\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** Between us, the cat lovers, the gun lovers, and the avian conservationists, my guess is we’ll be done with all this by the end of the month. \n\n**Agent Nitt:** And then we can focus on how to convince the whole world it didn’t happen.\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** Oh, I don’t think we’ll need to try that hard. My niece is in college and when I asked her what she thought, she said it didn’t lower her rent or pay her loans, so she doesn’t care.\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** Our disinformation department is observing that most US citizens are talking about why it happened much less than they’re talking about the NRA v NRFA case.\n\n**Agent Nitt:** The what?\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** The National Rifle Association and the National Renaissance Fair Alliance.\n\n**Agent Nitt:** Ah. \n\n**Dr. Ogg:** Did either of you see the reports about the cargo ship that found one of them stowed away? Traveled all the way across the country, hopped on a boat? Vanished from the port without a trace?\n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** No?\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** You don’t think that’s strange behavior from one of them? Requires more forethought than we usually see?\n\n**Agent Nitt:** Maybe. \n\n**Dr. Weatherwax:** Whatever happened, it’s probably gone by now.\n\n**Dr. Ogg:** You’re right. It’s probably gone by now.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n _\n _\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"Birdwatcher Sighting\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:audio-player-woed-source\n|unique-name=secretparty (only words, no numbers)\n|audio-file= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8320/Final%20Log.mp3\n|background-color=rgb(252, 252, 252)\n|border-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|border-radius=0.313rem\n|dropshadow-color=rgba(12, 12, 12, 0.15)\n|text-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|icons-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n|player-color=rgb(215, 215, 215)\n|progress-color=rgb(64, 64, 64)\n]]\n\n**NOTE:** The following transcript is taken from the body camera footage of Agent ████ Coin, of MTF Lambda-4 \"Birdwatchers,\" who was on duty staking out a potential sighting of SCP-███ in rural Alaska.\n—--\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Coin’s camera is level, pointed toward an abandoned farmhouse.]//\n\n//[A branch cracks behind her. She turns around and raises her rifle.]//\n\n//[Camera refocuses. Standing roughly 10 meters away from Coin is an SCP-8320-1 instance, wearing a red sequined pointed hat and a matching robe. It hides behind a tree.]//\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** No no no no no, don’t shoot!\n\n//[Coin moves closer.]//\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** //Please// don’t shoot, I’ve been shot at so much already!\n\n//[Coin lowers her rifle.]//\n\n**Coin:** You look just like one of those wizards.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** I- I am! I am one of those wizards but-\n\n//[Coin raises her rifle.]//\n\n//[SCP-8320-A collapses face-down onto the ground, clasping its hands behind its head.]//\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Wait wait wait wait wait please! You can’t shoot me! I can’t be shot!\n\n**Coin:** Why’s that?\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Because what if it hurts?\n\n//[Coin lowers her rifle again. Neither speak for several seconds.]//\n\n**Coin:** You don’t seem like one of them.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Well, I am. I’m a genuine bonafide wizard, I’ll tell you.\n\n**Coin:** Then how come you talk like that?\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Talk like what?\n\n**Coin:** You know. Like a normal person. I’ve blasted my fair share of wizards and usually they just shout something about how my wand is the wrong shape.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Oh. Well. I don’t have a wand, so I wouldn’t know.\n\n**Coin:** You’re really one of them? You’re not just somebody in a costume?\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Of course I am! I’m just as much a wizard as the rest of them! Watch!\n\n//[SCP-8320-A rolls up the sleeves of its tunic and holds out its hands. It strains. Nothing happens.]//\n\n**Coin:** If that was supposed to be magic-\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** I’m having an off day. Very long trip, you know. Hell of a boat. Not meant for people.\n\n**Coin:** It’s still awfully dangerous to be walking around in a costume like that.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** It’s not a-\n\n//[SCP-8320-A pauses and rubs its beard.]//\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Maybe I can’t do my own magic- //right now-// but you watch this.\n\n//[SCP-8320-A removes its hat and steps several paces away from it. The hat disappears and reappears on its head.]//\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Ha ha! See? I told you! I told you!\n\n**Coin:** Ohh…\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** If I could have worn a disguise to keep myself from being shot at all the way around the country, I would have done it, wouldn’t I? Would have simplified things, that’s for sure.\n\n**Coin:** I’m a little amazed you made it this far.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Well, I might not be the best at magic, but I suppose I’m the best at staying alive. And at this point, I don’t think I want to be either, frankly.\n\n**Coin:** You said you came here on a boat.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** I went //somewhere// on a boat. I've no idea how I ended up here, though. One minute I was on a dock, the next I was out here. Sure doesn't look like Mexico.\n\n**Coin:** Why travel around so much in the first place?\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** I’m looking for my friend. My best friend. The man with curly black hair and glasses. He’s very nice to me. Scratches under my chin and everything. I want to find him so we can go home.\n\n**Coin:** Where’s home?\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** The red house by the two maple trees.\n\n**Coin:** I’ll tell you what. I’ll call in, and we can go back to base. We’ll help you find your friend.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Really? You promise?\n\n**Coin:** Sure. But once we find him, we’re turning you back into a cat again.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** By blasting me?\n\n**Coin:** It won’t hurt.\n\n**SCP-8320-A:** Then thank the gods. I’m tired of this. And I always liked fish more than birds.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8319]]] | SCP-8320 | [[[SCP-8321]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** lostposter.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Raddagher]]\n> **License:** Creative Commons 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Wizard and his Wishing Well on Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana LCCN2011632742.tif\n> **Name:** wizard.jpg\n> **Author:** Carol M.
