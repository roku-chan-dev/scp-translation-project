As the primary Research & Containment site on the East Coast of Canada, it hosts cutting-edge installations such as the //Applied Metaphysics// Laboratories, the innovatively designed //Aquatic Anomalies// facilities, and the //Anomalous Art & Artefacts// wing. Additionally, the Site functions as a command center and shipyard for the //SCP Foundation Naval Command:// the Foundation’s naval presence in the North Atlantic. This body is responsible for overseeing ocean-based Search & Rescue, Salvage, Anomaly Containment, Force Projection, and Research operations.\n\n**Founded:** 7 September 1908\n\n**Founding Director:** Johnson C. Maud\n\n**Current Director:** Roger D. Barrett\n\n**Location:** Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\n**Cover Story:** Site-184 operates under the facade of a marine and naval shipbuilding organization: //Ship Captain's Productions.// To maintain the feasibility of this pretext, Site-184's Shipbuilding Division will occasionally undertake commissions from the Royal Canadian Navy and independent contractors in an adjacent complex. Relevant personnel are given Level-0 Clearance: only allowing access to the shipbuilding facilities, and are unaware of the SCP Foundation or Site-184's additional purposes, but may work on construction and repair projects for Foundation vessels. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nShould he include a floor plan?

His office sat atop the Main-Camp: the central administrative building for the site and the home of the Naval Offices; far below him the //GOTTFRIED Applied Metaphysics Labs// were carved into the bedrock. Adjacent to the Main-Camp was the Lewis Building, hosting //Art & Artefact's// climate-controlled collections facilities. Across the way was the new wing for //Aquatic Anomalies:// a collection of holding tanks and research facilities. \n\nThe waterfront was dominated by the dry-docks, shipbuilding facilities, and barracks. Barrett could see the naval and research vessels moored at the docks beyond, flags snapping in the wind. He would have loved to be out on his afternoon walk. Shortly, he promised himself, as he placed a request for the floor-plans to someone in Admin. Wondering how close his recreation of those plans would be, Barrett pulled over a notebook and quickly sketched an outline of the site's main buildings:\n\n[[=image Plan2.jpg]]\n\n\nGod that was atrocious, he admitted.
