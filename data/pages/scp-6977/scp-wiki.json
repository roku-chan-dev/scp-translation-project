Children may not enter Area-179 unaccompanied.\n\nPer **Addendum 6977.2**, investigation into anomalous activity from the McDonalds corporation is a top priority.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6977 is a McDonald's Playland Officer Big Mac Climber, a playground attraction resembling former McDonald’s mascot Officer Big Mac[[footnote]]The primary law enforcement in McDonaldland, Featured in commercials until a rebranding exercise in 1985.[[/footnote]]. Children may climb into the “head”, via a small entrance on the back of the tubular base, and peer out the bars of the attraction as if in a jail cell.\n\nSCP-6977 displays signs of sapience. The anomaly moves the top portion of its head autonomously when communicating with children under 9 years of age. Individuals over 9 cannot perceive SCP-6977’s speech. When the top half of SCP-6977’s head descends, the bars remain static, piercing the structure's upper \"bun\". The anomaly expresses pain from the punctures, though all wounds inflicted heal over time.\n\nSCP-6977 attempts to lure children it communicates with into its head for consumption. Objects inside SCP-6977's head will disappear upon the head’s complete closure and a varyingly long mastication period, leaving behind only minor viscera.\n\nFoundation personnel discovered SCP-6977 after the disappearance of 6-year-old Jagjit Dhiman at a McDonald's PlayPlace in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The attraction had remained at the location without notice for 30 years prior, besides minor reports from children at play of pained groans and wheezes. Foundation investigators believe it only gained the ability to move its head when its bars had deteriorated enough.\n\n**Addendum 6977.1:** Initial Interview Log\n\nAfter ascertainment of SCP-6977’s anomalous properties, Dr. Dunn brought her child, seven-year-old Elizabeth Dunn, to Area-179 for an interview with the anomaly. The younger Dunn acted as transcriber.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n//(Dr. Dunn and two armed guards escort Elizabeth Dunn into SCP-6977’s containment cell.

I just wanted to ask you some questions. Question number one: How did you gain sa- say-peence…\n\n**Dr. Dunn:** Sapience, sweety.\n\n**Dunn:** Sapience.\n\n**SCP-6977:** I DON’T KNOW!

THEY’RE RIGHT THERE, DANGLING IN FRONT OF ME. JUICY JUICY FLOPPERS.\n\n**Dunn:** You can't eat me, Mr. Burger! How do you even grow a burger head, anyways?\n\n**SCP-6977:** Y- YOU GROW FROM A BURGER PLANT. WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU GROW FROM?\n\n**Dunn:** Are you born with a body?\n\n**SCP-6977:** NO, IT’S A //PLANT//, YOU- IT SNAPS OFF THE STALK AND THE LIMBS SPROUT OUT LA-\n\n**Dunn:** Do you eat burgers?\n\n**SCP-6977:** NO, YOU PSYCHO! //(Sighs)// THIS IS WHY THEY GOT RID OF KIDS FROM THERE. WELL, THAT AND THE WHOLE “NO WITNESSES” THING. STUPID SCRUMPTIOUS BASTARDS.\n\n**Dunn:** From where?\n\n**SCP-6977:** //YOU// KNOW. “YOU” BEING THE PERSON READING THIS FILE. YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. I'M NOT RISKING IT MYSELF. 1977, NEVER FORGET!\n\n**Dunn:** Well, it was, uh, nice talking to you! I have to go now. Bye!\n\n**SCP-6977:** NO, DON’T GO, I’LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW. I SWEAR IT! I’M TELLING YOU-\n\n**Dunn:** If you tell me the name of the place, I'll, uh, give you the biggest child I can.\n\n**SCP-6977:** //(Gasps)// FOR ME? RIPE? PLUMP?\n\n**Dunn:** All those words.\n\n**SCP-6977:** OH THANK //FUCK//, I'LL TELL YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MCDONALDLAND.\n\n**Dunn:** OK!\n\n//(Dunn and attendees leave the cell.)//\n\n**SCP-6977:** HEY, WAIT! OH, MOTHER OF FUCK. JUST FEED ME, DAMN IT! I’M A GOOD COP!\n\n----\n\nAs a reward for aiding containment efforts, Elizabeth Dunn’s request for a Burger King meal was approved, subsidized by the containment budget.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6977.2:** Collected Documents\n\nFollowing **Addendum 6977.1**, Area-179 filed a RAISA inquest for mentions of “McDonaldland”. No uploaded Foundation Intranet documents were found. Further requests, emphasizing the concerning nature of SCP-6977's awareness of the Foundation and a lack of other McDonald's-based anomalies on-record, led to RAISA searching its physical archives. Three documents were found.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= [[size 150%]]**__Containment Proposal__**[[/size]]\n= [[size 90%]]__Submitted 10/19/1976__[[/size]]\n\n= [[size 100%]]__Abstract__[[/size]]\n\nWith the raid against Nx-191 (\"McDonaldland\") imminent, the Foundation requires an inconspicuous and reasonable cover story for the nexus' sudden disappearance. We propose a faux legal battle between Sid & Marty Krofft and the McDonald's Corporation. In such a case, Sid & Marty Krofft would sue McDonald's for plagiarizing characters from the TV series //H.R. Pufnstuf// in their McDonaldland advertising campaign. McDonald's losing such a case would reasonably result in a drastic altering or haulting of the McDonaldland campaign. We would requisition professional actors to play the parts of representatives from both companies, advertising agents, and judges. In recompense for false legal proceedings, via our contacts with [[[scp-6690|Henson Associates, Inc.]]], we would provide Sid & Marty Krofft with financial assistance.\n\n= [[size 120%]]__Please contact the NXMCD-Site-25 Office of Containment Proposals for a full copy.__[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; background:#fff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= [[size 150%]]**__Site-25 Memo__**[[/size]]\n\nIn preparation for the raid on Nx-191, please attend sessions on nomenclative detachment.
