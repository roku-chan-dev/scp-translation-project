He pulled the gun out of the holster and moved towards the steel door in front of him.\n\n\"Halt!\" came a voice from behind.\n\nHe spun around and leveled the pistol. In front of him was Dr. Cimmerian, in a similar outfit, looking very confused.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing here?\" Kondraki said with a touch of anger in his voice.\n\n\"What? Who are you?\" Cimmerian's hand rested on his hip.\n\n\"Dr. Kondraki, motherfucker. You told me I couldn't go back in time to kill baby Hitler. Which was bullshit cause I hadn't even told anyone I was considering it.\"\n\n\"Oh. Right. I remember you now.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause for several seconds.\n\nKondraki's eyebrow raised. \"Why are you here?\"\n\nCimmerian looked off to the side. \"I'm uh, I'm here to stop you from killing Hitler.\"\n\n\"In his bunker? Really? He's gonna be dead in minutes even if I don't do anything. I'd have figured you ethics eggheads would be fine with that.\" Kondraki trailed off. \"Wait. They wouldn't send you to stop me. They'd send like an agent or something.\"\n\nA small tremor from the battle going on outside rumbled through the floor as the lights flickered.\n\n\"Well I mean. Obviously. But I was the only one available for...\"\n\n\"Bullshit.\" Kondraki said. \"You're here to kill Hitler.\"\n\n\"I am, in fact, here to kill Hitler. Yes.\"\n\n\"Motherfucker. You're late. I called dibs.\"\n\n\"When did you call dibs?\"\n\nKondraki waved his gun in the air. \"Like, just now.\"\n\nCimmerian pursed his lips. \"You can't call dibs on killing Hitler.\"\n\nKondraki shrugged. \"I mean. We could both kill Hitler.\"\n\nCimmerian's nose scrunched up for a few seconds as he considered it. \"Right. How do we get through this door?\"\n\nThe two of them looked at the door. It was made of steel, with no visible hinges.\n\nKondraki pointed at the door. \"I mean we can just bash it down, right?\"\n\nThey looked at each other and then turned and slammed their shoulders into the door. Both of them bounced off one after the other with a grunt and grimace.\n\nKondraki clenched his teeth to speak. \"Ok that's a strong door.\"\n\nCimmerian grabbed his right shoulder with a gloved hand. \"Yup. Strong door. Ow.\"\n\n\"I think maybe we need to coordinate better. If we hit it at the same time we might get it.\"\n\nCimmerian nodded. \"You wanna go on three?\"\n\nThey both readied themselves and Kondraki started to count. \"Ok. One. Two-\"\n\n\"Wait wait.\" Cimmerian interrupted. \"Are we going on three or is it like 'One, Two, Three, Go'?\"\n\n\"We go on three.\"\n\nThey got ready again and Kondraki counted. \"One. Two. Three.\"\n\nAs they both put their shoulders into the door they bounced off again. This time a loud crack came from the other side. A gunshot.\n\nBoth of them closed their eyes and let the pain and failure wash over them. They'd just blown the only chance they had of...\n\nThe handle of the unlocked metal door turned. Dr. Clef, in full SS uniform, opened the door from the other side to see both Kondraki and Cimmerian reaching for their shoulders.\n\nDr. Clef smiled widely. \"Ha. Were you guys here to kill Hitler?\"\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
