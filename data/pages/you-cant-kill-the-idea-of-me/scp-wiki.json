I know who’s behind this.\n\nThe thing that I helped create is now the thing that\nis choking art out into a soulless, banalized husk\nof what it once was.\n\nIt is no longer a detailed,\nflexible figure of a mouse,\nbut a rough sketch, a shapeless\nand disfigured mess.\n\nI can’t even see his face anymore,\njust three circles stuck together.\n\nWhat happened while I was gone?\n\nWho allowed this monopoly to exist?\nWho let all the artists’ voices die out like this?\nWho let all of this become so devoid of life?\nWho let all the paint chip away?\nWho let all the ink dry?\nWho let all the animation become so stiff?\nWho let all the watercolors drown the whole painting?\nWho sat back and watched everything crumble?\n\n//Who did this?//\n\nWas it Walt?\n\nNo, it can’t be him,\neven if he left me\nto rot, he wouldn’t\ndare let his pride and\njoy become so hollow.\n\nWould he?\n\nWe worked together fine,\nwe bounced off each other\nand sketched so many ideas\nand characters together.\n\nWe had so much fun,\nbut I can’t go back.\n\nEverything’s different now,\nthere’s an awful cloud that\nis covering over everything,\ncreating a blackened tone\nthat suffocates the rest.\n\nThere’s no balance in\nthis grand painting,\nonly darkness and\na raging fire.\n\nIt all feels so miserable,\na mix of apathy and\na feeling of giving up.\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\nI’m just one person. I can’t solve every problem in the world. I can’t bring down all the corporations overnight. I can’t take out the systemic issues present in our society with one stroke of my brush. Thousands of people are homeless and starving, thousands more are losing basic needs just because they’re being themselves, everyone is dying, everyone is going to die, they are all going to die, die, //die//\n\nbecause of me.\n\n//Remember what Maddy said.//\n\nRight, okay. Okay.\n\nI am just one person.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean I’m incapable\nof creating change.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that\nI can’t make something beautiful\nor make something that has meaning.\n\nThe world is made of broad brush strokes\nfilled with small details that if you look closely,\nwill make the whole work of art much more\nintricate and meaningful than it already is.\n\nI can’t change the world in a day.\n\nBut I can start by making people happy.\n\nBy making something that I’m proud of.\n\nBy making something that’ll piss off all those bigwigs,\nall those spoiled, entitled nitwits with nothing that\nthey can truly claim as their own accomplishments.\n\nI’ll pour my heart and soul out,\nand even if it’s bad,\n\nat least it was made by someone real.\n\nMaybe I’ll go down to\nDisney’s offices and\ndo something special,\nput some color in those\nconcrete walls of theirs.\n\nNow that would be something, eh?\n\nIt’s hard living out here.\nIt always has been,\nbut I think, in the end,\nit’ll all be worth it.\n\nMy name is still out there,\nfor people to see.\nMight not be everybody,\nbut it’s something.\n\nI will not stop living until I see the monopolies fall.\n\nThey can erase me, chain me down,\nkeep me miserable as the world burns,\nbut they can’t kill the idea of me.\n\nThe human act of creation will thrive. And so will I.\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
