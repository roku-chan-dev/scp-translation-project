They have short brown hair, green eyes, and look tired most of the time. Is missing their right arm, which they lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn't like the prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite their snark and grump, they know how to have fun and like doing so.

Has a tendency to ramble.\n\nAs of spring 2024, they are dating Doctor [[[scp-5616|Ilse Reynders.]]]\n\nYou can use them as a GoI specialist if you like, as that's what they enjoy. Works for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.

She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina. She went to college at NYU for Accounting. She has a love for cooking that isn't often explored because she's very busy dealing with Wilson's.\n\nDislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.

Is friends with Jude Kriyot, JJ, and Esther Kogan.\n\n__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__\nShe doesn't really like coffee, but will drink it black if presented with it.

He doesn't pick up well on social queues, is prone to talking too much and getting in trouble for it, and has had at least one run-in with the Ethics Committee over his treatment of humanoid anomalies. Rex is a very anxious person, and is plural. His headmates are ##red|Atlas## (a loose-lipped and fiery taxidermy enthusiast), ##blue|Wally## (a rather relaxed and carefree individual), and ##grey|Janus## (a serious, though artistically inclined person).

He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, which went untreated for an unfortunately long time due to his toxic masculinity. Because of this, he killed his roommate and their cat, which led to him being imprisoned for life before signing up to be a D-class. He is now medicated and in therapy with the Foundation as to stabilize him. \n\nNowadays, D-1221 is kind, polite, and most of all, remorseful. He wants to change and grow as a person but has no idea how to even begin doing so. The fact that he is a D-class and is only receiving the bare minimum of help doesn't help this. \n\n__HOW DOES HE LIKE HIS COFFEE?__\nDouble double.\n__HOW OFTEN DOES HE SWEAR?__\nOnly when frightened or startled\n__WHAT IS HIS FAVORITE MEAL?__\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesesteak Philly Cheesesteak with lots of onions.]\n__WHAT IS HIS FAVORITE ANIMAL?__\nAardvark\n__WHAT IS HIS FAVORITE SHOW?__\nBreaking Bad\n__WHAT IS HIS FAVORITE SONG?__\n//Banner, Acoustic Version// by Lights\n__WHAT ARE HIS THOUGHTS ON WEEZER?__\nThose guys who did Buddy Holly?
