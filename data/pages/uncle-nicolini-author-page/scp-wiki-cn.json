She has short brown hair, green eyes, and looks tired most of the time. Is missing her right arm, which she lost in a [DATA EXPUNGED] incident. Doesn't like her prosthetic arm but wears it when necessary. Despite her snark and grump, she knows how to have fun and likes doing so. Identifies as female, but looks relatively androgynous and likes it that way. Born and raised in Florida. Speaks Spanish and English.\n\nYou can use her as a GoI specialist if you like, as that's what she enjoys.\nWorks for the UIU as a rookie agent in the Aces and Eights canon.\nLead Dr. Wondertainment researcher in Wonderful World canon.\nAdministrator in the canon of [[[SCP-4224]]]\n\n__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__\nPrefers bubble tea, but if forced to drink coffee likes espresso with a little bit of sugar.\n__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SAY USE SWEARS__\nSometimes.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab D-1221]]\n__APPEARS IN__\n* SCP-3297\n* SCP-3803\n* SCP-3867\n* SCP-3923\n* SCP-3709\n* Seven Days With Mr. Fish\n\n__SUMMARY__\nD-1221 is objectively a terrible person. Though his past is largely a mystery, we know a few things about him. His last name is 'Schieffer', and he killed his pet cat. Canonically, he dies after the events of SCP-3297 but don't let that stop you from torturing him with anything you want. Knows he's a terrible person and tried fixing it, but he fell back into old habits, ultimately landing in the Foundation as a D-Class. Idenfitifes as male.\n\n__HOW DOES HE LIKE HIS COFFEE?__\nHe would kill for any form of coffee right about now, to be honest. He hasn't had caffeine in forever.\n\n__HOW OFTEN DOES HE SWEAR__\nLike a sailor.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Faeowyn Wilson]]\n__APPEARS IN__\n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"+faeowynn-wilson\" perPage=\"40\" prependLine=\"||~ Title ||~ Author ||\"]]\n||%%title_linked%%||%%created_by%%||\n[[/module]]\nLOVINGLY MADE WITH MY FRIEND AND PAL DARKSTUFF\n\n__SUMMARY__\nFaeowyn Wilson (born Felix Wilson) is Tim Wilson's daughter and the second person to run Wilson's Wildlife Solutions. She is very intelligent and inherited her father's love for animals, but is a lot more competent and responsible than him. Is a very 'no-nonsense' person. She is tan, has shoulder length hair, brown eyes, has an athletic body type, and is often seen wearing a WWS-embroidered khaki shirt and shorts. Smells of sunscreen. Is dating fellow WWS volunteer Alex Molina.\nDislikes Marshall Carter and Dark.\nIs friends with Holly 'Wondertainment' Light in Wonderful World canon.\nIs aware of Three Portlands and the Wanderer's Library.\n\n__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__\nPitch black.\n\n__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__\nIn front of her dad?

Her eyes are unnaturally large and almost cartoonish, her arms are rubbery, and her eyes change color to reflect her mood. She is the current Dr. Wondertainment in the Wonder World canon and is doing the best she can to improve the company's image following some rather disastrous years of bad leadership. She's very optimistic and always tries to look on the brighter side of things no matter the situation, even though she may not truly believe them to even be remotely possible in the long run. Identifies as female.\n\n__HOW DOES SHE LIKE HER COFFEE?__\nShe likes her sugar with a dash of coffee. Yes, a dash of coffee.\n\n__HOW OFTEN DOES SHE SWEAR?__\nDr. Wondertainment™ licensed products and personnel are not permitted to swear as per article 15 of section 2 of the Wondertainment Wonder-employment contract™.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ __like my stuff?__\naw shucks, thanks. i'm open for collabs almost all the time, so just hit me up. it helps if you have an idea though, so don't just come up to me asking to write. \n\n\n\n++ __srs bznz__\n[[/=]]\nin the event something happens to me and i disappear for 5 years or die, i leave all my non-colab articles entrusted to [[*user Varaxous]], and all my collab articles with the respective co-authors.
