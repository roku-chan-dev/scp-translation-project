These are caused by the fact that Scp-7487's existence is embedded in the current fabric of the space-time continuum causing all containment efforts to be completely unreliable.\n\nScp-7487 is currently located in a highly restricted containment zone known as Site-007, which located in a uninhabitable desert in [REDACTED], Site-007 is about 150 km in width and length while having walls approximately 25 meters in height. The perimeter is surrounded by all Foundation personnel including MTF's,  Global defense and military groups as well as multiple Governments from surrounding nations.  \n\nDue to 7487's nature in being calm and peaceful and also due to the fact that all containment methods are ineffective, current containment is focused on observing and studying the anomaly, while also trying to halt any civilian access to 7487's containment zone, this is done to keep the anomaly undisturbed. The use of high-level drones and other Aerial surveillance devices, seismic monitors and dimensional anomaly sensors have been used in observing 7487 activities.\n\n So far only members of the O5-Council and clearance level 6 researchers, and MTF Zeta-99 \"Vigilant Shephard's\" are allowed to be within a range of 20 km of 7487. Disturbance or contact with 7487 can only be done during a XK-end of the world scenario or a ZK-end of reality scenario which include or is done by Scp-7487",
