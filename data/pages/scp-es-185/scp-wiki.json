Because of its historical importance and nature, and in spite of its inertia, it must still be monitored frequently for any sign of reactivation. The entrance to SCP-ES-185's hangar is to be guarded by security personnel armed with stun batons. Personnel wishing to access the hangar must pass a three-step security check consisting of: vocal verification via passcode, ocular telemetry verification, and fingerprint verification. Only Foundation personnel with DEINEX[[footnote]]**De**partment of **E**xtraterrestrial **In**vestigation and **Ex**ploration[[/footnote]] clearance can access the hangar. Anyone otherwise attempting access will risk disciplinary action.\n\nDue to SCP-ES-185's capability to utilize strange matter[[footnote]]Refer to [http://scp-es.com/scp-es-129 SCP-ES-129] (Interplanetary weaponry development).[[/footnote]], testing without prior approval and safety measures is strictly prohibited.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-185 are the inert remnants of an ultraplane[[footnote]] **Ultraplanes** are aircraft that are functional solely in outer space; etymologically derived from the Grecian prefix //ultra//, \"beyond\" and //planus//, \"traveller\", \"vagrant\". [[/footnote]] discovered in the Kuiper Belt following Extranormal Event DELTA-V, which transpired 8 February 2020. SCP-ES-185's fuselage exhibits signs of surface and battle damage. The cockpit has no area for a pilot, instead housing a damaged AI terminal, with the word \"Babel\" engraved onto it. SCP-ES-185's logs were able to be recovered from the cockpit.[[footnote]]Refer to Appendix ES-185a.[[/footnote]]\n\nAs SCP-ES-185's fuselage resembles a swallow[[footnote]]//Hirundo rustica.//[[/footnote]] with prominent wings, it is theorized that its capabilities extended beyond spaceflight[[footnote]] Virtual ultraplane simulations with similar fuselage show remarkable success in suborbital flight.[[/footnote]].  One of SCP-ES-185's wings is emblazoned with a bird superimposed over the Foundation symbol, and the name **Swallow-DX-185**.\n\nResearch and analysis of SCP-ES-185 shows that its technological capabilities far exceed current ultraplanes. However, it shows similarities in Foundation-accessible technology. Deduction of SCP-ES-185's capabilities has been achieved by detailed analysis of its components. This is still ongoing, due to both the complexity and the irreplaceability of its parts.\n\n* SCP-ES-185's fuselage is composed of nuclear pasta[[footnote]] The toughest known material in the natural universe, gathered from the innards of neutron stars. Highly unstable. See [http://scp-es.com/scp-es-129 SCP-ES-129][[/footnote]] and shows signs of surface damage.\n\n* SCP-ES-185 possesses a mono-turbine propulsion engine with hyperluminal capacity similar to that of SCP-███, albeit with significantly greater portability.\n\n* SCP-ES-185 has an armament with two systems:\n *  Dual lasers that fire horizontally and possess the capability to pierce all known materials, with no overheat;\n * A guided missile launcher, with each missile containing strange matter that causes targets to suffer extensive molecular damage.\n\n* SCP-ES-185 is able to release a total of four SCP-ES-185-1 constructs, metallic bars that generate energy fields via rotation, and can copy SCP-ES-185's offensive maneuvers.\n\n* SCP-ES-185's main defense mechanism, aside from the fuselage's durability, is a kinetically generated shield that can withstand several attacks consecutively without wearing down. However, after exhaustion, it requires several minutes of recharging before it can be used again.\n\n* SCP-ES-185 posesses a module with space-time manipulation capabilities, showing similarities to SCP-████, but again with much greater portability [[footnote]]As of writing, it is not understood how this is achieved.[[/footnote]]. Due to severe deterioration, it is not possible to repair or reactivate this module.\n\n**Appendix ES-185a:** Inspection of SCP-ES-185's cockpit led to the discovery of a recording device. Only the last six logs were able to be recovered.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Log 1]]\n**Pilot Sam Trubon, beginning log.**\n\nDate of recording: **08/02/2220** of the Terran calendar.\n\nThe Dark Shadow's started its final attack. It was going to happen sooner or later. Disrupting its genocidal plots against the universe for several years has painted a target on our backs. Not that we didn't know; this is what we signed up for, centuries ago. It's a thankless task, but one I accepted with a smile.\n\nIf they've made the decision to go all out, it's only fair we respond in kind, isn't it? Every single Swallow has been deployed. This fight is the tipping point; no matter how it ends for us, we won't go out without a bang.\n\nI'll be the Swallows' squad leader once more, and I can finally find out how well this ship fares in a true firefight. It's a Swallow-DX-185, the Foundation's most technologically advanced ultraplane. I like the DX-150 model better; at least with that, I don't have to rely on an AI for some tasks. But I digress, our choices were limited.\n\nI was there when they showed us the design documents for the ship. I almost immediately voiced my concerns about including an AI, saying that it was unnecessary, and I haven't changed my mind about it. And why did we need a space-time manipulator in an ultraplane? That's just asking for a disaster...But the brass wouldn't budge on either of them.\n\nOur task is simple: take control of the skies, and put a permanent end to these hostiles. I know we'll be able to do it...even if we don't survive.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Log 2]]\nBeginning log, voice-activated.\n\n**Sam:** I'm starting a check on Swallow-DX-185's systems. ... Babel switched on.\n\n**Babel:** {{Welcome, Samuel Trubon, pilot.}}\n\n**Sam:** Thanks, Babel. Just get me the mission schematics and perform a system diagnostic.\n\n//(Two minutes of silence)//\n\n**Babel:** {{Mission schematics downloaded. 100% weapon capacity. 100% engine capacity. 100% shield capacity. Space-time manipulator fully operational, pending activation.}}\n\n**Sam:** Excellent. Nothing else to be done. Mission Control, this is Swallow 1. All checks have been made, and waiting to fly on your word.\n\n**Mission Control:** Affirmative, Swallow 1. You're cleared for flight. Bay doors have been opened. Best of luck.\n\n**Sam:** Affirmative, Mission Control. Signing off...\n\n//(10 seconds of silence)//\n\n**Sam:** Swallow 1, liftoff!\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Log 3]]\n**Sam:** Swallow 1, under enemy fire! Swallows 2 through 10, form at my six and cover me!\n\n**Babel:** {{Samuel, several hostiles are closing in on our coordinates. There are at least 500 of them.}}\n\n**Sam:** They're trying to overwhelm us with their numbers. All Swallows, we need to release the drones[[footnote]]SCP-ES-185-1 constructs.[[/footnote]] **now**. We need to cut down their forces!\n\n//(No sound for several minutes except static)//\n\n**Babel:** {{I'm registering a hostile, much larger than the others.}}\n\n**Sam:** What the fu--?\n\n**Swallow 2:** A massive citadel!\n\n**Swallow 5:** Can we even scratch that thing?\n\n**Sam:** ...Babel, I need you to scan every centimeter of that ship, see if there's a flaw that we can exploit!\n\n**Babel:** {{Scanning... The entirety of the hostile craft is reinforced with--▒▒▒▒▒▒ SCAN INTERRUPTED. \"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE\" PROTOCOL ENGAGED.}}\n\n**Sam:** Babel? What the hell's gotten into you?\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Log 4]]\n**\"MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE\" PROTOCOL**\n\nIn the light of the Dark Shadow's mothership manifesting on 8 February 2220, the Foundation created this protocol and preprogrammed it into Babel before implementing it into the ultraplane Swallow-DX-185, making sure that all the data was exactly as discovered in SCP-ES-185 on 8 February 2020.\n\nThis procedure covers vital data concerning the make and structural integrity of the mothership, along with intel detailing how it can be damaged internally. The essential coordinates to complete this task have been downloaded automatically. With one well-timed explosive, a domino effect will ensue and rupture the ship, giving your ultraplane time to evacuate.\n\nNone of us are certain that the minutae of events are 1:1 causally, but time will still give us favor.  Samuel Trubon, in order to end this, the loop must stay stable.\n\nWe wish you luck.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Log 5]]\n//(Information downloaded)//\n\n**Sam:** Babel, you knew about the mothership already? What do they mean, \"discovered in SCP-ES-185\"? What skip is that? Hold on...\n\n**Swallow 2:** Sir, don't you remember anything they taught us in the Academy? SCP-ES-185 was the genesis of the entire Swallow line of ultraplanes. Back then, no one could figure out how it even functioned, but with the advance of tech more could be reversed-engineered, leading to...\n\n**Sam:** The DX-185, my ship... It all makes sense now. ...There's no use defying time, is there? So let's make the most of what the past's given us. Swallows, form with me; let's finish them!\n\n//(Indistinct sounds of combat for several minutes)//\n\n**Sam:** The center of the mothership's in our sights. One last mission... Firing explosive! Move your asses, you need to go!\n\n**Swallow 5:** Everything's exploding. Sam, come on!\n\n**Sam:** Go, go... Babel, overclock the engines! I'm not letting it end like this.\n\n**Babel:** {{Affirmative. All non-essential energy has been diverted.}}\n\n//(Silence)//\n\n**Sam:** Oh yeah, there we go! Out of the fire...\n\n**Swallow 2:**Sweet moves, Sam! It's over, I can't believe it's over. Drinks are on me.\n\n**Sam:** As much as I could use a drink, we need to take care of one last thing.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Final Log]]\n**Swallow 5 5:** Sam, hold on. You're telling us you have to send DX-185 into the past?\n\n**Sam:** Absolutely. Causality has to stay as stable as it can, and it needs to happen immediately. In SCP-ES-185's file, it says they saw nothing inside the cockpit except for Babel's module... Which means I discharged myself and sent all of this data to use for their future, our now... A circular message in a bottle.\n\n**Swallow 2:** Wait, wouldn't that create a bootstrap paradox? If not, where did the intel that let us win come from?\n\n**Sam:** You bring up a good point. How many times has this happened before? Who started it? Who cares? All that matters is this is how the Foundation will contain this anomaly. It's a necessity, and there's no disputing that. I'll give Babel everything they need and then leave through the escape pod. Make sure you pick me up and bring me back home, boys.\n\n**Swallow 5:** Sure, but you'll have to pay for our drinks...\n\n//(Sam chuckles)//\n\n**Sam:** Babel, fire up the space-time manipulator. Date of arrival: 8 February 2020, exactly two centuries ago. Retain all of our logs, especially the \"Message in a Bottle\" Protocol. This Swallow needs to land securely into the Foundation's hands.\n\n**Babel:** {{Affirmative, Samuel. New objective. Temporal travel will commence in exactly three minutes.}}\n\n**Sam:** Thanks, Babel. And to everyone in the past listening to this message, my gratitude to your intel. It turned the tides.  //Hasta la vista!// Babel, prepare the escape pod.\n\n**Babel:** {{Firing escape pod.}}\n\n//(Disconnection is audible.)//\n\n**Babel:** {{Temporal travel commencing in three. Two. One. Zero.}}\n\n//(Static for the rest of the log.)//\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Daman_1985 and newnykacolaquantum]]\nImage License: Swallow symbol is under CC-BY 2.0 generic https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Swallow-tailed_Kite_(34163638494).jpg\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
