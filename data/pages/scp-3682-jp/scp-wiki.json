This document is provisionary.\n\nIf any information or instances of SCP-3682-JP are found outside Foundation spaces, they are to be temporarily contained at Site-8154 by Task Force Ki-18 (\"Shut Eyes\").\n\n**Description:** SCP-3682-JP is presumed to be a symbol drawn by a child. This is formed from data successfully recovered and restored; the actual anomaly and its designation are unknown.\n\nSCP-3682-JP was supposedly contained and researched at Site-814A, but most of the instances and related documentation were lost during a major site containment breach. Three of the five staff members in charge are deceased, with the remaining two missing. Since the only damage to SCiPNet caused by the breach was to this slot, SCP-3682-JP is currently under investigation as being related to the breach. Currently, only a select few brief descriptions of SCP-3682-JP instances have been recovered.\n\nFrom the recovered data, it can be inferred that inserted images of SCP-3682-JP have the effects of causing disasters or accidents to relevant persons or events in the near future.\n\nThe following is a record of successfully recovered SCP-3682-JP instances. Foundation discussion is based on the currently remaining data, as the details of assumptions made prior to the containment breach are unknown.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n__**Excerpts from recovered SCP-3682-JP instances**__\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-41-srq9/Ki_01 link=#]]\\\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-klrx/Ki_01W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-3\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2022/08/21\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture\n> \n> **Details:** A fire was caused by the firing of fireworks at the referenced display. 12 casualties. Additionally, this display had 10% less participants than in prior years.\n> \n> **Investigation:** SCP-3682-JP appears as a cat-like symbol, believed to match with the poster's aesthetic. If it appears on an item that describes a future event, such as this one, it is likely that a disaster will occur at that event.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-42-k1kp/Ki_02 link=#]]\\\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-efza/Ki_02W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-24\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** [DATA LOST]\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Machida City, Tokyo\n> \n> **Details:** The creator was afraid of the relevant symbol and appeared to be slightly confused. Eight hours after the poster's circulation, the creator was beaten to death by people intending to rob him.\n> \n> **Investigation:** This SCP-3682-JP instance is believed to have been made by the poster's creator. However, since they expired, it's hypothesized that spur-of-the-moment drawings can also trigger tragedies, or that the drawing itself is created by SCP-3682-JP, based on the examples below.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-43-f8u5/Ki_03 link=#]]\\\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-g9az/Ki_03W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** [DATA LOST] (henceforth referred to as \"instance with an unknown item number\")\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** [DATA LOST]\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Machida City, Tokyo\n> \n> **Details:** Same as above. However, additions were made by an unknown third party. It is known that they were made within two days of its creation; however, identification of the addressee has failed due to them being outside of surveillance range and other means of capture.\n> \n> **Investigation:** It's highly probable that the additions were either made by a party separate from the initial creator that knows about SCP-3682-JP's effects, or is SCP-3682-JP themselves, adding it through unknown means. Currently, it's hypothesized to be the latter, based on other examples.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file:5018858-46-td3x/Ki_04 link=#]]\\\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-x01u/Ki_04W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-68\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2020/06/04\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** on SNS[[footnote]]**TL note:** Social Networking Service.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Details:** Used as a profile picture. The submitter did not recall creating the picture and reacted negatively to its design. They were subsequently ran over and killed in a vehicular accident, five days after being interviewed. Nothing suspicious was found in this accident, and its relation to the anomaly is unknown.\n> \n> **Investigation:** Unlike other examples, a torso is depicted, but this may be due to the damage displayed on it. Marks on the torso are believed to be from car tires, with the object on the leftmost side presumed to be the car itself.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-44-dhk8/Ki_05 link=#]]\\\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-oncl/Ki_05W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-109\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2021/10/24\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture\n> \n> **Details:** The above image was found on SNS. The poster found the item at their home's mailbox. The item had already been incinerated by the poster. Three days after discovery, the poster, expressing unease, decided to sleep at a friend's house for a week. However, the day after they started sleeping over, the house collapsed from old age.\n> \n> **Investigation:** The item's handwriting differs from that of the instance with an unknown item number, and the reference to SCP-3682-JP suggests that it was written by someone with knowledge of the anomaly. The fact that both eyes and the oval on its forehead are crossed out suggests that they are all eyes. However, this is not corroborated by other instances. SCP-3682-JP appears to have been crushed, which would suggest death from the collapsed house.\n----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Addendum 3682-JP.1:** Recovery of the SCP-3682-JP slot's edit history revealed that several staff members in charge of the slot had erased most of the data at the same time the containment breach occurred. Additionally, remnants that appeared to be parts of SCP-3682-JP instances were found in the Site's incinerator. The reasoning for these behaviors is unknown.\n\nAdditionally, a new instance was found at the Foundation after the containment breach in Site-814A. The following is a record of these instances.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n__**SCP-3682-JP instances recovered from the incinerator**__\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-c0d9/Karada_Yakekogete link=#]]\\\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-37-awhx/Karada_YakekogeteW link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-A-1\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2024/01/15, during post-containment breach search of Site-814A\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Site-814A (relatively undamaged area)\n> \n> **Details:** It's been confirmed that several posters similar to this example were placed around the Site, but all have been lost. The currently presumed author is one of the researchers in charge of SCP-3682-JP, who was killed by an explosion in the containment breach that caused the loss of their body's lower half. The other two confirmed researcher fatalities are believed to have perished from head injuries and lethal infohazards, respectively.\n> \n> **Investigation:** The fact that Foundation staff were unaware of the SCP-3682-JP instance, despite it being posted across the Site, suggests that SCP-3682-JP occurrences are self-concealing, as is the case of other instances.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file:5018858-38-to1k/Muryoku link=#]]\\\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-37-m5wb/MuryokuW link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-A-2\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2024/01/18, during post-containment breach search of Site-814A\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Site-814A (severely damaged area)\n> \n> **Details:** Recovered to the right of a Foundation employee's body. Appeared to have been crushed to death from a collapsed part of the Site. The handwriting is similar to the employee's, and since SCP-3682-JP's drawing is incomplete, it's theorized the employee died in the middle of drawing it. The message's meaning is currently pending analysis.\n> \n> **Investigation:** SCP-3682-JP's drawing is incomplete.

The advised for the meeting to be cancelled, in case of unexpected circumstances.  At 11:12PM that day, a fire broke out in the meeting room the conference was scheduled to take place in. However, thanks to the prior warning, no one was injured. The fire's cause was determined to be an electrical fault in the wall's wiring. However, the wiring had experienced unnatural deterioration, despite being replaced a month ago.\n> \n> **Investigation:** The wire's degradation is hypothesized to be caused by SCP-3682-JP, but the accompanying writing implies SCP-3682-JP's anomaly is triggered independently of subconscious acknowledgement of it. --The arm-like appendage is currently pending investigation.-- See SCP-3682-JP-A-6.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center scp-clear-false img-change\"]]\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file%3A5018858-48-ed1s/Ki_06 link=#]]\\\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wikidot.com/local--files/file:5018858-35-bh4n/Ki_06W link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-3682-JP-A-6\n> \n> **Date of Discovery:** 2024/01/25, after fire in the meeting room\n> \n> **Location of Discovery:** Whiteboard in the meeting room where the fire occurred\n> \n> **Details:** No applicable accidents have occurred.\n> \n> **Investigation:** The entity holding SCP-3682-JP down is also drawn on SCP-3682-JP-3.
