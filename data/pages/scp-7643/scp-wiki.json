SCP-7643 causes an ontokinetic shift whenever SCP-7643-1 interacts with a one-way, non-automatic door. Through unknown methods,[[footnote]] Update: See //Protocol Deostiation// for details behind the transfer mechanics.[[/footnote]] SCP-7643 is able to transfer between hosts.\n\nWhen an SCP-7643-1 instance attempts to pull a door, SCP-7643 retroactively applies an ontokinetic shift, inverting the door swing[[footnote]]The mechanical pieces of a door that determine if it opens in or out. [[/footnote]] such that the door opens the opposite direction. If an SCP-7643-1 instance persists in alternating between pushing and pulling, SCP-7643's effect will occur each time, for a period of time greater than 5 minutes, with no recorded maximum duration.\n-----\n**Addendum 1:** Discovery\nOn March 22nd, 2023, the following exchange was recorded between Dr. Garrison and Dr. Lillihammer. It is the first confirmed instance of SCP-7643 in Foundation records.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= **Security Log 7643-A Transcript**\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Dr. Heather Garrison is recorded as she approaches the doors to Testing Room 432-A.//\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** I'm fucking exhausted, can we just get this over with?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Heather? You're suggesting we, //gasp//, cut corners?\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** Babe. Not today.\n\n//Dr. Garrison reaches the threshold -- she pushes on the door, activating SCP-7643, and inverting the door swing. She pushes a few more times.//\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** Really?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Have you tried pulling the door?\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** Thanks Lilli, I'll be sure to try that.\n\n//Dr. Garrison begins to pull on the door, activating SCP-7643, switching the door state. It does not move. Dr. Garrison begins to push and pull on the door alternating, in rapid succession.//\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** MOTHERFUCKER I WILL KICK YOU I--\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Are you sure you're pulling it? I know it's a complex concept, I'd be happy to give you some pointers?\n\n//Dr. Garrison glares at Dr. Lillihammer. Though the mechanics are unknown, it is believed that the previous exchange resulted in the transfer of SCP-7643.//\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** Look, watch. Pull.\n\n//Dr. Garrison pulls the door, which opens without issue.//\n\n**Dr. Garrison:** No, fuck this, I'm done.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the above incident, Dr. Garrison submitted a request for security videos, to determine if an anomaly was present; before the request could be granted, SCP-7643 was captured on another security camera.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= **Security Log 7643-B Transcript**\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Dr. Lillian Lillihammer and Dr. Harry Blank are captured approaching the doors to Site-43's Cafeteria-A.//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I don't know what's up with Heath. Yeah, she's cranky sometimes, so am I. But today, she was just... more frustrated than normal?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Hmm? How so?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Harry, she stormed off because of a door.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Weird. Maybe there's something else going on?\n\n//Dr. Lillihammer approaches the leftmost door to the cafeteria and pushes on it. SCP-7643 activates, and it does not budge.//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Motherfucker.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** What's wrong now?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Harry, this is a pull door.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** No, you don't understand. This is a pull door.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yeah. You pull them, not push.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Asshole. My point is, we both agree that when I push on this door, nothing happens, because, it is a pull door, right?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay, sure, we agree. It's a pull door.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** But it shouldn't be a pull door.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Lillian, there's no need to be embarrassed about pushing on a pull door, it happens all the time. People forget, it's no bi--\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Harry, look who you're fucking talking to, okay? I need you to understand this; throughout the entire time I've worked on this Site, this door has been a push door. Across countless timelines, realities and simulated scenarios, it has **always** been a push door.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** But your memory is -- could you be wrong?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Harry. Please.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Well there goes my lunch. All because Lillian Lillihammer forgot how to open a door.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the events of Security Log 7643-B, it is believed that Dr. Harry Blank became the new SCP-7643-1 instance. The next transfer would be the final one, prior to the implementation of //Protocol Deostiation//.\n-----\n**Addendum 2:** Incident 7643-W\nOn March 23rd, 2023, Incident 7643-W occurred, transferring SCP-7643 to its current host. The following security log captures the moment of transfer.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= **Incident 7643-W Transcript**\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Dr. Harry Blank and Dr. William Wettle are seen outside of Site-43, as a heavy rain begins. Both rush towards the doors, which Dr. Blank reaches first. He attempts to pull on the door, which activates SCP-7643.//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Fuck. I can't believe Lillian gave m--\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Ha. Idiot. You can't even open a door.\n\n//SCP-7643 transfers to Dr. Wettle, now SCP-7643-W.//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Well that worked out nicely.\n\n//Dr. Blank pushes the door, entering Site-43. The door closes behind him. Dr. Wettle approaches the same door, and attempts to push, activating SCP-7643.//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Wait, what?\n\n//Dr. Wettle is observed attempting to open the same door for the next 4 hours, as the rain continues to fall.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the events of Incident 7643-W, Dr. Lillihammer, Dr. Garrison and Dr. Blank submitted this file, alongside a proposal for //'Protocol Deostiation'//.[[footnote]]Deostiation is defined as 'The act of throwing something or someone out of a door.'[[/footnote]] After a swift approval by the Site-43 section chairs, it was enacted and has run without issue since, as detailed in the notice below.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE SITE-43 SECTION CHAIRS REGARDING //PROTOCOL DEOSTIATION//\n\nTo all staff employed at Site-43, excluding Dr. William Wettle,\n\nTo maintain containment of SCP-7643, //Protocol Deostiation// has been implemented. Following //Protocol Deostiation// is considered a top priority for all staff, and any individuals found to be in violation will be punished accordingly.\n\nAs per //Protocol Deostiation//, individuals are prohibited from **mocking, making jokes at or about, taunting, teasing, or engaging in commentary that could be construed as 'sarcastic' or 'insulting' towards Dr. William Wettle, also known as SCP-7643-W, when he is attempting to open a door.**\n\nDue to Dr. Wettle's [[[SCP-7000|latent abilities]]], our hope is SCP-7643 will be assumed as an extension of those effects, causing a negligible additional harm, and containment will be ensured through self-deprecation.\n\nPlease note that this does not restrict actions or statements made towards Dr. Wettle during periods where he is not actively attempting to [[[Reostiation|open a door]]].\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-7642]]] | SCP-7643 | [[[SCP-7644]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
