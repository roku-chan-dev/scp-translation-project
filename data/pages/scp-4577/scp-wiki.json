[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The town of ██████[[footnote]] Redesignated as Area-102. [[/footnote]], Missouri is occupied by Foundation personnel, and a 5km exclusion zone has been established around it. Deceased individuals are to be immediately removed from the town and incinerated. All consumer waste is to be collected and transferred offsite twice weekly. All previous residents are to be monitored, in the event of them becoming SCP-4577-1 instances. Individuals attempting to enter the exclusion zone are to be thoroughly questioned, issued amnestics, and released.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4577 is designated as the spontaneous animation of approximately 20% of recently deceased citizens in the town of ██████, Missouri.[[footnote]] Occurrences have been noted to primarily take place from 11:00 P.M. to 3:00 A.M. Deviance has been observed once on ██/██/2014 when an SCP-4577-1 instance animated at 6:00 A.M. No further discrepancies have been observed. [[/footnote]] Individuals affected by SCP-4577 are henceforth known as SCP-4577-1. From documented occurrences, no pattern in the selection of SCP-4577-1 instances has been observed; all entities are indiscriminate. Once animate, SCP-4577-1 instances will make their way to the nearest concentration of waste within the town, the primary target being the town's landfill, designated SCP-4577-A.[[footnote]] Recently, SCP-4577-1 instances have been observed to deviate from the primary target of SCP-4577-A, instead choosing smaller concentrations of waste. [[/footnote]] Upon arriving at its destination, SCP-4577-1 will bury itself in waste and cease all further anomalous activity. Non-anomalous instances, at this point, can be returned to their original location of burial. To date, there have been 95 documented occurrences of SCP-4577. \n\nCitizens of ██████ refer to SCP-4577-1 instances as \"lost souls,\" treating their reanimation as a commonplace event. Citizens will often ignore SCP-4577-1 instances, --out of what is assumed to be respect for the dead, or because they are unable to discern the difference between an SCP-4577-1 instance and a pedestrian.--[[footnote]] See interview logs 4577/1 and 4577/2. [[/footnote]] \n\n--Foundation personnel are currently devising procedures for isolating ██████ and moving its citizens to other locations, as SCP-4577 has only been documented to occur in the town itself.--\n\n**Interview Log 4577/1:**\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Access Interview Log 4577/1 ▼\" hide=\"▲ Hide Log ▲\"]]\n**Interview Log 4577/1 Recorded on ██/██/2014**\n [[/=]]\n[[<]]\n**Interviewed:** Terrence Kelley\n \n**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Canton\n \n**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted by Jr. Researcher Canton, disguised as an interview for a documentary about the town, in order to learn a local resident's view on the anomalous incidents that occur in ██████.\n\n-----\n@@ @@**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n@@ @@**Canton:** Good afternoon, Mr. Kelley.\n\n@@ @@**T.

When people die here in ██████ sometimes they ain't satisfied with where they get buried. So they get themselves up and hop over to the landfill.\n\n@@ @@**Canton:** And these lost souls find a landfill more appealing than a coffin?\n\n@@ @@**T. Kelley:** Hell if I know. Things don't talk at all. They wake up at night, 'round eleven, and walk straight to the trash.\n\n@@ @@**Canton:** What do they do when they find trash?\n\n@@ @@**T.
