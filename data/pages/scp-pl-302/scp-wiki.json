No characteristic features that could be used to indicate the sender are heard during the recorded message. \n\nThe anomalous effects of the object manifest after it is heard by a human being. At that point, the listener will not be able to vocalize for a short period of time; testers' vocal cords were not damaged in any way.\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]Addendum PL-302/1:[[/span]] Reception\n\nSCP-PL-302 was discovered during the exploration-colonization of planets capable of supporting life beyond Solar System by Foundation's Colonization Vessel [[span class=\"h-span\"]]KENNEDY-3848-XK[[/span]]. With time, an attempt was made to establish communication with any alien civilization to restock food supplies. The message was anomalously modified to instantly translate it to a listener's native language. The following is a transcription of the message sent by the crew of [[span class=\"h-span\"]]KENNEDY-3848-XK[[/span]].\n\n[[div style=\"color: #ccc; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#192845 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #ffb961; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ [[span class=\"h-span\"]]EMERGENCY MESSAGE FROM KENNEDY-3848-XK[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n----\nTo whomever this message will reach.

Due to the alarming context of the message, research command of [[span class=\"h-span\"]]KENNEDY-3848-XK[[/span]] decided to change the course of the route and not to respond to the message.
