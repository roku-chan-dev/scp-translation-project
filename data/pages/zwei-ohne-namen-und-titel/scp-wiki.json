Nimbly, the owner hopped and ducked over roots and under bushes and tree trunks. \nThe vixen had a goal and it could be found in a hollow.\n\n@@ @@\"Oh, [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Wolf[[/span]], why do you lie so sad and hidden in such a place?\"\n\nThe vixen pushed her face into the wolf's field of vision.\n\n@@ @@„[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Vixen[[/span]], wretched cheater, what do you care?“\n\nThe large creature barely lifted its eyelids once.\n\n@@ @@„I am worried, my dearest.“\n@@ @@„I know you. This is not pity. Oh no, it can't be any further than that. You're afraid you won't have anyone left to torment with your pranks. You've fooled me too many times already.“\n\nAnd so the wolf turned around so that he would no longer see the vixen. To his surprise, anger and hurt could be heard in the vixen's following words: \n\n@@ @@„Oh, have I hurt your pride that you no longer believe a word I say on principle‽“\n\nThe wolf stood up. Now his curiosity was awakened after all. Calmly he answered:\n\n@@ @@„The truth is quite clear: yes, once, twice too often you have abused my goodwill for your pranks. What should make me think differently now, dear friend and enemy?\"\n\nThe vixen hesitated, well aware that the wolf had a right to ask about her motives. The wolf saw how his counterpart inwardly tried to find a good defence and failed.\n\n@@ @@\"I'm sorry,\" she stammered, \"you have to believe me that this is not one of my little games.\"\n\nThe wolf was moved, because he knew that the vixen meant it when she made a promise. A promise was worth too much here to just break it like that.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/zwei-ohne-namen-und-titel/baum.png width=\"75px\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Finsterhain[[/span]]\n++++ //Outside World//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nBranches and twigs crackled under the feet of a woman with bushy hair as she walked with steady steps through the undergrowth. On her shoulders she carried a whole lot of furs still worn by their deceased owners. \nHer destination was a hollow where a young man crouched under two trees, regularly feeding a fire with wood. The flames had an uncharacteristic colouring for the type of fuel.\nThe dark-haired woman placed her hunting prey next to the fire so that the red-haired man could see her. The man looked with an expressionless gaze at the dead animals, then at the huntress.\nThe woman moved her head in different directions, a little unsure where to look.\n\n@@ @@„I asked them beforehand. They had the opportunity to identify themselves as intelligent.“\n\nThen the woman sat down with her friend and pushed herself close to him so that they could share their only woollen blanket and keep each other warm. The man's body language showed a slight hesitation that was not because his friend was the taller of the two, but he let it happen. The woman didn't seem to notice.\nSomewhat absently, the woman ran her hand over her right wrist, which still bore clear bite marks of a predator. \nThe man gingerly felt the left side of his neck, where a reddish-pink scar extended up to his ear, with a good chunk of skin and the pinna missing. The area was in the process of healing and growing back. \nThe eyes of the two met, but neither spoke.\n\n@@ @@„Eat something, [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fox[[/span]], it will help it grow back faster.“\n\nThe man grabbed one of the limp bodies, that of a hare, and began to chew on it. A cracking sound could be heard as the strong jaws and teeth broke the bones.\nThe woman watched the goings-on before asking her counterpart with a slight grin, \"Don't you want me to roast them over the fire?\"\nA sheepish smile appeared on the man's face.\n\n~~~~\n------\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/zwei-ohne-namen-und-titel/Standort-DE20.png width=\"75px\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ [*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/standortliste#u-DE20 Esoteric-Site-DE20]\n++++ Glarus Alps, Switzerland\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThrough the quiet corridors of a sector of Site-DE20, two agents walk silently, lost in their thoughts.\n\n@@ @@\"What are you thinking about?\" asks the athletic, red-haired woman.\n\nHer colleague with the angular features takes a moment to put his thoughts into words.\n\n@@ @@\"How we met back then and how you asked me to leave our home.\"\n\nThis is unexpected for his partner. \n\n@@ @@\"Do you think it was a mistake?\"\n@@ @@\"Do you regret it?\"\n@@ @@\"I asked you first.\"\n\nThey both remain silent. The small quarters for the staff, where researchers and agents can spend the night, come into view.\nThe two slip into the room with the number plate 34 and the bunk bed. The man turns a switch button from the green field with Free to the red one with Occupied.\n\n@@ @@\"I sleep upstairs!\" says the woman, hopping briskly up the stairs - taking care not to touch the sheets with her work boots - and then throwing down her things from upstairs that might disturb her rest.\nThe man almost demonstratively takes his time, but when he too has made himself comfortable, he sighs in relaxation.\n\n@@ @@\"To your question: No,\" he answers, facing the wall.\n@@ @@„What do you mean, [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]][*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/seltsame-dinge-geschehen-an-ruhigen-tagen-prolog Wolf][[/span]]?“\n@@ @@„I just wanted to share that I don't regret it, [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]][*http://scp-int.wikidot.com/seltsame-dinge-geschehen-an-ruhigen-tagen-prolog Fuchs][[/span]] that we left.\"\n\nAgent [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Wolf[[/span]] listens to the ensuing silence before hearing someone climb down and the bed crack barely audibly as another person lies down on it.\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fuchs[[/span]] snuggles up against his back. \n\n@@ @@„I miss the others.

I just don't like it when you breathe down my neck or snot all over my uniform.“\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fuchs[[/span]] giggles and rubs her nose against one of his sleeves, knowing full well that he too was seeking comfort.\nThey lie still for a minute before [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Wolf[[/span]] whispers: \n\n@@ @@„I don't want to ruin this touching moment, but the uniforms insulate really well.“\n@@ @@„Yes, i feel hot too, but i didn't want to say anything.“\n\nThe two giggle. Again there is a moment of silence as they both lie on their backs looking at the underside of the bed. Then [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fuchs[[/span]] becomes restless again.\n\n@@ @@\"Do you actually trust me now, you know, after all these decades?\"\n@@ @@\"Of course I don't. You play tricks on me just like you did back then.“\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fuchs[[/span]] sulks, but she can't stay angry with her friend for long.\n\n@@ @@„But what has changed is that I can laugh along now.\"\n\nThen he pushed [[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', serif;\"]]Fuchs[[/span]] over the edge of the bed so that she fell onto the floor. They both laugh as they throw their pillows at each other.\n\n[[/==]]\n[[module CSS]]\n.outside {\n  margin: 2em -6em;\n  padding: 1em 10em;\n  --narration-color: rgba(245, 245, 245, 1.4);\n  background: var(--narration-color);\n  background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255,255,255,0) 5%, var(--narration-color) 10%, var(--narration-color) 90%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 95%);\n  z-index: -2;\n}\n\n.outside.inline {\n  margin: 1em -6em;\n  padding: 1px 10em;\n}\n\ndiv#container-wrap::before {\n    content: \"\";\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 162px;\n    background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Atheme/body_bg.png\") repeat-x;\n    -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%);\n            filter: grayscale(100%);\n}\n\n.imagediv { float: right; margin: 15px}\n@media (max-width: 540px) {\n  .imagediv {\n    float: none; text-align:center; margin: auto;\n  }\n}\n\ndiv#header h1 a span {\n    font-size: 0px;\n}\ndiv#header h1 a:before {\n    content: \"ㄗITCH 卄AVEN\";\n    color: #eee;\n    \n}\ndiv#header h2 span {\n    font-size:0px;\n    padding: 4px;\n}\ndiv#header h2:after {\n    content: \"Fables about Hate, Secrets, Love and Death\";\n    font-weight: bold;\n    color: #f0f0c0;\n    padding: 19px 0;\n    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .8);\n    white-space: pre;\n}\n\n#header {\n  background-image: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/pitch-haven-hub/scp45.png)\n}\nspan, a { word-break: normal !important }\n\n#extra-div-1 {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 170px;\n    pointer-events: none;\n    background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component:theme/body_bg.png) top left repeat-x;\n    -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(0,0,0,1) 40%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 60%);\n    mask-image: linear-gradient(to left, rgba(0,0,0,1) 40%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 60%);\n}\n\n/* reapplying sigma-9 styling */\n#top-bar ul li a::after,#top-bar ul li a::before{display:none}#search-top-box-input{border:solid 1px #999;border-radius:5px;color:#ccc;background-color:#300;box-shadow:inset 1px 1px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)}#search-top-box-form input[type=submit]{border:solid 1px #999;border-radius:5px;padding:2px 5px;font-size:90%;font-weight:700;color:#ccc;background-color:#633;background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom,#966,#633,#300);box-shadow:0 1px 3px rgb(0 0 0 / 50%)}\n[[/module]] \n\n[[module css]]\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Special+Elite');\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Govt_Logo.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Fantem]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2746 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** Standort-DE20_logo-400.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dr_Grom]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/zwei-ohne-namen-und-titel SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** baum.png\n> **Name:** Etz Chaim.svg\n> **Author:** FLLL, פֿינצטערניש.\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Etz_Chaim.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
