No animals of the family //Spheniscidae// are allowed to make contact with the advertisements. SCP-5451-2B instances found to have memetic effects are to be blocked by Foundation Web Crawler Πουλί . All materials released by SCP-5451 is to be disseminated as Foundation Cover R621 (\"Online Roleplay\"). In addition, a Foundation web crawler is to track the posts and conversations of SCP-5451-1 instances to detect any anomalous activity.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5451 is a virtual school primarily attended by animals in the family //Spheniscidae//, more commonly known as penguins. Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interact with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.\n\nSCP-5451-1 are a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that can access the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances are done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turn into SCP-5451-1 instances when they come into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) come in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.\n\nSCP-5451-2A instances are flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They are found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that come into contact with SCP-5451-2A turn into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they are enrolled in SCP-5451.\nSCP-5451-2B instances are banner ads found on the Internet. They take the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text \"(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!\", or some variation of the text. Subjects that come into contact with an SCP-5451-2B instance have a 25% chance of contributing to penguin conservation efforts using the forums.\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=400px\n|url= http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/scp-5451/forum.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The forum used by SCP-5451-1 instances to communicate\n]]\n\n\n**Addendum 1.1: Attempted Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances**\n\nOn 2021/02/01, Junior Researcher Cook was assigned to arrange an interview on the SCP-5451-1 instances to gather general information about SCP-5451 and SCP-5451-2.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Attempted Interview\" hide=\"- Hide Attempted Interview\"]]\n\n> Topic: what's this school about?\n\n[[div class=\"post\"]]\n[[div class=\"one\"]]\n[[image  http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/scp-5451/beep-beep-lettuce.png]]\n##000000| beep beep lettuce ##\n##0055FF| Newbie ##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"two\"]]\n>\n> Hello, I'm a new student here, and I really really want to learn more about your school, the history behind it, how's the culture here, what are the great stuff to be found here and other stuff.\n>\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"post\"]]\n[[div class=\"one\"]]\n[[image  http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/scp-5451/cody.png]]\n##000000| Cody ##\n##00AAFF| 4th Year ##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"two\"]]\n>\n> Ugh, newbies like you cluttering up the forums with \"what's this school about? what's the food like?\" and on and on and on\n> Why not do your homework and read the FAQ and lurk more around the forums before posting?\n>\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"post\"]]\n[[div class=\"one\"]]\n[[image  http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/scp-5451/beep-beep-lettuce.png]]\n##000000| beep beep lettuce ##\n##0055FF| Newbie ##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"two\"]]\n>\n> Hey, you don't need to be aggressive to me\n> I'm just asking questions, man\n>\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"post\"]]\n[[div class=\"one\"]]\n[[image  http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/scp-5451/cody.png]]\n##000000| Cody ##\n##00AAFF| 4th Year ##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"two\"]]\n>\n> Ah, yes the classic excuse\n> \"iM jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs\"\n> Hey dummy, most of the questions you have will be answered if you lurk more\n> @Forster, please close this thread.

After 10 months, Junior Researcher Cook publishes a paper entitled //The Culture of SCP-5451: A VIew Into the Life of Anomalous Penguins Through an Online School//. An excerpt of the paper is available below along with an excerpt of the interviews done by Junior Researcher Cook on SCP-5451-1 instances.\nA copy of the full paper and interview log can be received from either Junior Researcher Cook or Senior Researcher Drake.  \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances\" hide=\"- Culture of SCP-5451-1 Instances\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n1. **Family Life**\nSCP-5451-1 instances have a close-knit relationship with their family, not unlike non-anomalous penguins, despite having the mannerisms of non-anomalous humans. In a sense, their relationship with their family is like a fusion between non-anomalous humans and penguins.\nSCP-5451-1 instances have a noticeably close relationship with even their cousins thrice removed, as most of them live together in packs, like non-anomalous penguins. However, when it comes time for SCP-5451-1 to leave their house to start their own lineage, they are given a copy of a recipe that both their mother and father made.\n\nIn fact, it is a rite of passage for an SCP-5451-1 instances to cook their first meal without the assistance of their parents.\nA marriage proposal between two SCP-5451-1 instances consists of cooking a traditional recipe from their families and presenting their meal to the bride/groom.\nDue to their food recipes being passed down from generation to generation, SCP-5451-1 instances take great pride in their lineage.\n\nBeing a cook is considered to be the highest honor among SCP-5451-1 instances, and recreating their families' dishes while adding their own touch is considered to be one of the important things parent SCP-5451-1 instances must teach to their children.\n\n2. **Cuisine**\n Although mainly inspired by American cuisine, the recipes made by SCP-5451-1 instances noticeably have fish in them, with some seaweed mixed in for umami.\n Most of the dishes SCP-54511 instances call \"traditional\" are Inuit recipes, suggesting a link between Inuit culture and SCP-5451-1 instances. In addition, most traditional SCP-5451-1 dishes involve some sort of food preservation technique, whether that be fermentation or drying food.\n Due to globalization, other methods of cooking food has reached the SCP-5451-1 instances. This has developed their cuisine so much, younger SCP-5451-1 instances are having a hard time developing their own recipes due to the amount of methods possible.\n \nSome notable food preparation methods that SCP-5451-1 traditionally use are:\n* Fermentation of fishes\n* Freezing of fishes to be eaten raw\n* Drying of seaweed under the sun for consumption\n* Smoking\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Excerpt of Junior Researcher Cook's Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances Regarding Their Cuisine\" hide=\"- Excerpt of Junior Researcher Cook's Interview with SCP-5451-1 instances Regarding Their Cuisine\"]]\n\n> Daily Topic Thread: Favorite Food?
