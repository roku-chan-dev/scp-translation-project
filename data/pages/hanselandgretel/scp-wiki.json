Jobs such as leading human cloning and falsifying scenic spots and historical sites are the responsibility of Level 4/2000 personnel. If all these people die, after SCP-2000 is activated, it's nothing but replicating them first then repeat the steps above.\"\n\n\"It's like the mysteriousness is gone.\"\n\n\"You are just expecting a big red button with convenience. Even the Greek's literal //Deus ex machina// is, after all, just a //Mechane// designed and powered by humans. You can't expect the machine to know when Medea's going to be killed.\"\n\n\"What's Medea? Let me see...\"\n\n\"I think the high manual requirements are probably due to the fear of turning it into a clone war or a cliche AI rebellion film, the unique 2K version phobia called... Technophobia? Though, this thing itself has significant ethical and practical issues——\"\n\n\"Take a look.\"\n\n\"hmm?\"\n\nAfter the implementation of the Ganymede protocol (indicating a failure of the Foundation to prevent a K-Class scenario), SCP-2000's security systems will unlock, allowing any Foundation employee to initiate Procedure CYA-009. If, after 20 years, SCP-2000 remains inactive, security will be relaxed further, allowing any non-anomalous human being to access the facility and initiate the procedure. Once activated, SCP-2000's internal monitoring systems will attempt to locate all personnel of Level 4/2000 clearance and assess their condition. Mission-critical personnel not found will be replicated using the most recent neural archetype scan on file, and awakened prior to the initialization of any other systems.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"'allowing any Foundation employee to initiate Procedure'...?\"\n\n\"......\"\n\n\"How?\"\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**0.**\n\nYou see, machines can’t speak.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@>@@  ↲\n\n{{}}\n[[/div]]\n\nBut there's an input box where you can type something to interact with it.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@>@@ The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone↲\n\n{{The Yellowstone Grand Canyon is the first canyon on the Yellowstone River downstream of the Yellowstone Falls in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.
