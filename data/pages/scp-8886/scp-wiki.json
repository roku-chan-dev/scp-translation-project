Security cameras located within SCP/8886’s containment chamber are to have undergone specialised SCRAMBLE Protocol modification, in order to prevent security personnel from being subjected to the anomaly.\n\nCustody of SCP/8886 is currently split between the Department of Demonology (containment) and the Department of Tactical Theology (research). At least once a day, a member of D-Class personnel is to be subjected to SCP/8886 in order to glean more information about SCP/8886/A[[footnote]]Due to the nonlethal nature of the anomaly, this has been allowed by the Ethics Committee.[[/footnote]]. \n\n[[include component:image-block name=tv.jpg|caption=SCP/8886 during an SCP/8886/B event.|width=300px]]\n\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**DESCRIPTION:**[[/span]] SCP/8886 is an analog, CRT television, dated to 1987. SCP/8886 remains turned on and at full power even when not connected to any power source, and continuously displays a video recording now designated SCP/8886/A.\n\nSCP/8886/A is a video recording that constantly emanates from SCP/8886. SCP/8886/A is a static shot of a green hill, upon which is a large, wooden cross. Upon this cross is a figure bearing resemblance to the religious figure of Jesus Christ[[footnote]]Whether this figure is actually Jesus Christ is still under debate.[[/footnote]]. This figure is nailed to the cross by the hands and ankles, but does not visibly bleed, and regularly emits sounds of great distress. SCP/8886/A does not appear to loop, and seems to either be an extremely long, if not infinite, video, or a form of ‘live-stream’.\n\nSCP/8886/A is a form of visual cognitohazard. Individuals that observe SCP/8886/A will begin feeling symptoms such as pain in the hands and ankles, the taste of blood in their mouth, the feeling of dehydration, the feeling of intense sun on their face, and heavy sensitivity of the eyes. Individuals who continue to observe SCP/8886/A will begin to experience vivid vision of being strung up on a cross and crucified. These hallucinations appear to have a continuous story, but are almost always interrupted by SCP/8886/B, before the full story can be experienced. Following an SCP/8886/B occurrence, the story resets to the beginning with the next individual.\n\nSCP/8886/A shows signs of interference, and is often interrupted by bouts of static that entirely block out the video. For ease of reference, these bouts of static have been designated SCP/8886/B. SCP/8886/B instances interrupt SCP/8886/A in such a way that SCP/8886/A’s cognitohazardous effect is nullified. This makes it difficult for the hallucinations to be fully experienced and understood.\n\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**ADDENDUM 8886/1:**[[/span]] On 02/06/2006, SCP/8886/A experienced the single longest recorded run without SCP/8886/B, allowing D-6786, the current test subject for SCP/8886, to experience the currently most complete record of SCP/8886/A’s hallucinations.\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**D-6786 TESTIMONY**[[/span]]\n\n//When the vision started, I was being dragged up the greenest of hills, by two guards. I didn’t have my clothes, only a clean, white, cloth around my waist. When we got to the top, I saw the cross, lying in the grass. They laid me down, and they started nailing my hands down. That’s when the pain began.//\n\n//They then did my ankles. Those were a lot harder to get through with the nails they were using, but it did the job, and soon I was bound to the cross. I did not bleed.//\n\n//They had a rope attached to the top of the cross, and they used it to pull the cross up to a standing position. That’s when I saw the crowd gathering on the hill before me. Some were weeping. Some were laughing. Some were indifferent. That’s when another man walked up to the cross, and fixed a wooden plate above my head. The plate held a single word://\n\n//“**INRI**”//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**ADDENDUM 8886/2:**[[/span]] On 15/08/2004, St. [REDACTED]’s Cathedral, Ireland, suddenly became corrupted with heavy Anti-Akiva[[footnote]]Radiation derived from sin.[[/footnote]] Radiation.

All members comply.##\n\n##F6C403|They enter through the ruined archway into the interior. ε5-Victor makes a comment about the state of the structure. ε5-Alpha orders him to be quiet. ε5-Victor makes further comment about ε5-Alpha’s leadership abilities.##\n\n##F6C403|A small disturbance is heard from within the structure. All members are immediately wary, and raise their weapons. ε5-Alpha cautiously walks towards the source of the disturbance. When the coast appears to be clear, she orders all other members to continue. ε5-Bravo makes a comment about “this place freaking her the hell out”.##\n\n##F6C403|The team reaches the centre of the structure, which contains a stone well, which appears to stretch down indefinitely. The team hears footsteps from behind them, and immediately turn, weapons raised. They see a figure which seems to be a priest, wearing white robes. His eyes have been gruesomely cut out, and replaced with two small, wooden crosses. The figure has a euphoric smile.##\n\n##F6C403|ε5-Alpha orders the figure to stop moving. The figure ignores her order, and slowly approaches the team. It raises its arms slowly, and begins incoherently mumbling words which appear to be latin.##\n[[/<]]\n\n##F48237|“**jesu christe salvator noster qui in cruce mortuus est pro peccatis nostris in vita post- ueni gaude eum gaudere gaude gaude gaude gaude**”##\n\n[[<]]\n##F6C403|The figure continues to approach despite ε5-Alpha’s orders. When the figure is approx. 2 meters away from the team, ε5-Bravo shoots her rifle, killing the figure instantly. Several team members protest, but ε5-Bravo remains adamant it was the right decision. ε5-Alpha appears indifferent, and orders the team to keep moving.##\n\n##F6C403|As the teams descends further, the cathedral becomes a labyrinthine structure with several dark rooms. The teams splits up and begins searching individual rooms. ε5-Sierra reports finding several malnourished humanoid beings cowering among rubble in a collapsed section. One of the beings becomes hostile, and ε5-Sierra is forced to execute the group. Anti-Akiva readings increase.##\n\n##F6C403|After approx. 30 minutes of searching the structure, ε5-Victor reports discovering a “weird-ass TV”. At this point, ε5-Victor’s camera feed is interrupted by heavy static, and he becomes unresponsive. When the other team members converge on ε5-Victor’s location, they find him dead, nailed to a wooden cross. SCP/8886 sits on the ground before the cross. ε5-Bravo is ordered to collect SCP/8886, and the team makes a hasty retreat.##\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]**ADDENDUM 8886/1 (CONTD.):**[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n\n//Suddenty, I heard a voice speak behind me.//\n\n[[=]]\n//##F48237|\"So you're the messiah, huh?\"##//\n[[/=]]\n\n//It's a man's voice, behind me.
