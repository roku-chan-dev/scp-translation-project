This article was intimidating me for a while cause of how long it is but it's really really good! I love the whole vibe, the characters, and the fact that the MAIN character is designed to be completely unlikable yet still manages to be endearing and make you care about him.\n\nThe anomaly is confusing the get a grasp on at first but as it goes on and on and on it makes more and more sense until suddenly, near the end, you understand perfectly. It's such a nice balance! It's a good article. I like it a lot :)\n\nAlso I put a LOT of trust into this article actually staying in the #1 spot so I wouldn't have to rush and get the video done the day after and I'm glad it worked out. \n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
