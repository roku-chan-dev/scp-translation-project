Internal security protocols may only be revised / updated by O5 Executive Order, and only after a full Council screening via the //Knows Test//. \n\nIf an individual undergoes the //Knows Test// and SCP-5657 does not give the code-phrase \"I can feel their heart beating\", automated restraints will keep the individual fully immobilized. Should immobilization fail, or the individual poses any eminent threat to SCP-5657's safety, they will be terminated via automatic gunfire. Secondary to SCP-5657's survival, the live capture of a GOI-115 specimen is considered paramount in averting a total SK-Class \"Dominance Shift\" scenario.\n\nSCP-5657, together with all knowledge related to its existence, has been permanently restricted to Section-ØN.  Upon exiting this area, you will be amnesticized. \n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-5657 is Nikita Ludo, a television personality from Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.A.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997 Ms. Ludo hosted //Nicki Knows//, a daytime talk-show formatted to resemble a therapy session. This hour-long program would feature weekly celebrity guests, each recounting childhood experiences and future aspirations in front of Ms. Ludo and a live studio audience. Unlike typical therapy, Ms. Ludo would often criticize and berate her guests to the delight of her audience, revealing any lies or hidden details told throughout the interview with seemingly (and now proven) supernatural accuracy. \n\nSCP-5657 is capable of C2M minor empathic communication, i.e. the extrasensory perception of emotions through physical contact. Under ordinary circumstances, SCP-5657 would only require Grade-D passive surveillance. However, SCP-5657 must remain within Section-ØN at all times, having become the target of a newly discovered group of human-mimicking lifeforms — GOI-115 — hereafter known as \"Smiling Men\".\n\nThe total population, objectives, and anomalous capabilities of the \"Smiling Men\" is currently unknown. However, to date, this group has carried out 26 near-successful assassination attempts on SCP-5657. These breach events continue to occur wherever SCP-5657 is relocated, and against all escalating containment protocols; the most recent attempt being carried out via an undetected form of micro-explosive implanted in the tear-duct of Security Officer Wills. As a direct result, SCP-5657 has been left with 3^^rd^^ degree burns on 32% of their epidermis, and partial loss of lower-body mobility. \n\nUntil testing is complete, SCP-5657's survival is considered paramount, as currently they are the only known means of detecting \"Smiling Men\". \n\nThese entities \n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n> **USER_NOT_FOUND:** Stop.

The radial bone of his left arm is fractured open. Pieces of the bone are seen extending out from a large gash. Subject shows no signs of discomfort, even as he rotates his arm up well past baseline human flexibility. The sound of tendon and bones snapping is heard.  Subject inspects the radial bone now inches from his face.//\n> \n> **Unknown Male:** //(monotone)// Ah.\n> \n> **Zeta-12-1|Helmen:** Don’t.

Both the subject and 12-1's skulls are terminally fractured within seconds. 12-1 flatlines. Hostile is still fully mobile despite large sections of brain matter being exposed.//\n> \n> //Hostile runs out of the motel room. The remaining members of Zeta-12 re-group, take up position, and over 12 seconds of sustained gunfire obliterate 36% of the figure's body.//\n> \n> //Hostile stumbles several steps from the highway, then collapses. The body is seen convulsing for several seconds, then dissolves, leaving only a set of clothing and a gas-slick-like puddle evaporating on the asphalt.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n> **USER_NOT_FOUND:** Such a waste.

We both know I'll never publish an autobiography and... well, chances are, you all might be my last audience.\n> \n> **Dr. Adelard:** //(...)// Please continue, Ms. Ludo. \n> \n> **SCP-5657:** //(sighs)// So, I paid for my motel room in cash, and I was standing over the bed so damn ready to pass out... but then my stomach reminded me it'd also been 72 hours since I //ate//. So, I went to get a quick vending machine lunch. 20 seconds, tops. When I got back with my Cheetos he was just... there. In my room. Standing. Smiling. I didn't even have time to scream before his hands were around my throat. He didn't even squeeze; he just pressed his palms in like a bear trap, crushing my windpipe. Then everything went black.\n> \n> //2-second pause.//\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** I'd felt a lot of things in my life, Doc, but dying... I didn't know terror and calm could exist together like that. There's no feeling like it. \n> \n> //4-second pause.//\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** But then, out of nowhere he just... let me go. I was on the floor, gasping, coughing, this god awful ringing building in my ears. I could barely see, but when I looked up at him... Doc, he was //crying//. Not just crying, but screaming, clawing at his neck, trembling like a scared puppy. I didn't know what was happening at first, but after I got a bit more oxygen to my brain I realized: //I// was crying. //I// was terrified, and hopeless, and dying... and without knowing it, I'd somehow forced those feelings onto him.\n> \n> **Dr. Adelard:** That-... Ms. Ludo, are you saying you can //transmit// your emotions to other people? None of our testing—\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** No. Not people. I've... well, sometimes, I feel like I can almost share a little piece of what I'm feeling with someone I'm—... really intimate with.\n> \n> **Dr. Adelard:** You mean—\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** I don't mean that, no. I mean emotionally intimate. Someone I'm in sync with, someone I trust... but no. Like I said before, people are just too different — too full and complex. Trying to impart my feelings onto someone else would be like... trying to add a spark to a bonfire. But that //thing// had no fire — no anything. Suddenly I was adding that spark to a dry pine bed. Fwoosh!\n> \n> **Dr. Adelard:** Incredible. I'm curious, though: why didn't you take your chance to run?\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** Because I decided to hit him with a goddamn chair instead. He'd tried to kill me, Doc. I was running on pure instinct. I'd been cornered, exhausted, and terrified. My brain switched from flight to fight. I just screamed and started swinging. I broke his back, his arm, and his nose with that damned chair. He didn't even flinch. He just kept trying to get back up. The only thing that seemed to hurt him was when I grabbed his face and gave him another dose of //fear.//\n> \n> //5657 takes a deep breath.//\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** It worked... for a while. Maybe I was losing focus, maybe I just wasn't scared enough... maybe he was getting used to it. I don't know; but he got back on his feet. I had to do something. I grabbed him one last time and gave him the only thing I had left... anger. That's when he started hitting me. He could have killed me — easily — but he didn't. He just hit me, over and over. You've probably seen the medical reports. I'd never even broken a bone before that day, let alone twenty-freaking-seven. It worked, though. I stayed alive long enough for your SWAT guys to show up. You know the rest.\n> \n>  **Dr. Adelard:** I do, yes. Thank you Nicki. Let's stop here.\n> \n> **SCP-5657:** Oh— yeah alright. That's... hey— hey Doc? Do you think... are you guys close?
