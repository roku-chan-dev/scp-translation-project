I spoke with factory manager Sanjay Lochan, who told me about the company's success in what they call the 'Mindscape' industry. \"We fulfill about 1,500 orders daily, and have a current waiting list of 30,000 people,\" he says. \"It's in high demand. We offer people a chance to become what they never would have been naturally. It's a surprising business model that would not have even worked ten years ago.\" This is, of course, in reference to the Veil protocol, which as you may know, was [...]\n\n> Anonymous Moosphere representatives -- who relayed messages through a company liaison, to avoid divulging trade secrets -- told us they have five factories going up in India alone in the next eighteen months.\n> \n> Their facilities use state-of-the-art paratechnology that's genuinely out of this world. \"Aren't you concerned about consumer safety?\" I ask Sanjay in private.\n> \n> \"Quite the contrary. People consent with their dollars, and they consent to cranial probes before we even admit them, and they light up in all the right areas,\" Sanjay tells me. \"The truth is people enjoy it. They like it. And why wouldn't they?\"\n> \n> I can't argue with that logic, Sanjay! One process involves hooking oneself up with the pumping station, through which you can experience a prolonged astral projection for just under 18,000 rupees. Trials for a more permanent, long-distance experience -- in a process known as \"astral bridging\" -- are underway in a lab in Hong Kong. Moosphere Astrologists say they want to allow \"[a] chance to explore nearby nebulae from the comfort of your own home!\"\n\n> Overall, my talks with Sanjay were unexpectedly candid. Sanjay, my crew, and I laughed for what must have been hours. The ruckus garnered a few furtive glances from the otherwise focused line workers, who stood wide-eyed and taciturn at their stations the entire day. Talk about diligent work ethic! But, of course, before the tour was over, Sanjay brought me down to the R&D Wing to join my mind with [[span style=\"color: #1951AF; font-weight: bold;\"]]The Lactescent Chorus[[/span]]–\n> \n> = **[[span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; color: hsl(360, 100%, 27%)\"]]「 //Informational hazard destroyed.// 」[[/span]]**\n\n----\n\n//Excerpts of the music-related magazine \"Rolling Stone\", 31 January 2027.//\n\n> ... Results of the new investigation and witness testimonies have proven that the car accident that led to the death of T-Rex singer [[[scp-1841-ex|Marc Bolan]]] was orchestrated by the SCP Foundation...\n\n> Pete Doherty, lead singer of both The Libertines and Babyshambles, has been arrested at his home in Paris, France, and is currently under interrogation by the police for suspicions of [[[fifthist-hub|Fifthist sympathies]]]...\n\n> \"Even if we are not and will never be a Hand-related band, yes, the discovery of the Library had been a great influence for us, since the early years,\" Radiohead's lead guitarist Jonny Greenwood revealed in a recent interview for //Q//. \"When we had begun recording for 'The King of Limbs', we wanted, especially me and Thom, to make a record that would be able to capture the very essence of what this place is and the mystic parts of it...\"\n\n----\n\n//Excerpt from a Breitbart article \"Millions concerned for job security - Anomalies optimise more jobs, leaving normal people behind.\", 7th July 2027.//\n\n> More than 2500 people have gathered in Hyde Park, Sydney after 'Lendlease' determines that a known reality warper is a suitable replacement for 150 workers.\n> \n> The reality warper, who can instantly construct anomalous structures, was provided with the job by a Manna Charitable Foundation security net, and Lendlease agents spent several weeks determining whether he was fit for the job. On Tuesday he was allowed onto the construction site for '1 Central' (A skyscraper planned to be built on Central Station, Sydney, anomalously made invisible so as to bypass air rights laws) and 150 workers were made redundant as a result. \n> \n> Following the news, a protest was organised, which is so far peaceful. Counter-protesters, mostly from anomalous communities, also arrived, and a small scuffle occurred near the Anzac memorial, resulting in one arrest. Breitbart reporters performed exclusive interviews on some of the protesters, showing that the people of the world are sick and tired of this anomalous menace. \n> \n> //\"I don't want to sound insensitive but, is it fair to be removed from your job because you were bet- born different? Is it?\"// One protester said. \n> \n> //\"These people think that they can steal our jobs! This is not the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last.\"// Another said. \n> \n> **More headlines:**\n> **[[[SCP-5350 | Secondary Oculus Flu]]] outbreak confirmed in Libya.**\n> **Anomalous History to be Taught in French Schools, President confirms.**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Deadly Bread, IFBench, Lt Flops, newnykacolaquantum, and Westrin]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** reddeer.png\n> **Name:** Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig390.png\n> **Author:** Arthur Charles Fox-Davies\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry_Fig390.png Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Additional Notes:** Edited by [[*user ch00bakka]]\n\n> **Filename:** bluntfiend.png\n> **Name:** User (89620) - The Noun Project.svg\n> **Author:** Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:User_(89620)_-_The_Noun_Project.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** rook4.png\n> **Author:** [[*user The Great Hippo]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/parawatch-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** rabbit.png\n> **Name:** Outline of a bunny.svg\n> **Author:** Honsvu, Père Igor)\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Outline_of_a_bunny.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** wl_logo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Woedenaz]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/component:theme Wanderers' Library]\n\n> **Filename:**rantvideo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Nykacolaquantum]], MorikoWulf, Barb Henry, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, [[*user ch00bakka]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/broken-masquerade-epistolary SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> **Name:** New Moriko.jpg\n> **Author:** MorikoWulf\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Moriko.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Name:** Yellow to Blue Background\n> **Author:** Barb Henry\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bhenry/35998655230/ Flickr]\n\n> **Name:** Complete Guide to Heraldry Fig390.png\n> **Author:** Arthur Charles Fox-Davies\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry_Fig390.png Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Additional Notes:** Edited by [[*user ch00bakka]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
