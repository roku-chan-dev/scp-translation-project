Moosphere Astrologists say they want to allow \"[a] chance to explore nearby nebulae from the comfort of your own home!\"\n\n> Overall, my talks with Sanjay were unexpectedly candid. Sanjay, my crew, and I laughed for what must have been hours. The ruckus garnered a few furtive glances from the otherwise focused line workers, who stood wide-eyed and taciturn at their stations the entire day. Talk about diligent work ethic! But, of course, before the tour was over, Sanjay brought me down to the R&D Wing to join my mind with [[span style=\"color: #1951AF; font-weight: bold;\"]]The Lactescent Chorus[[/span]]â\n> \n> = **[[span style=\"font-family: Georgia, serif; color: hsl(360, 100%, 27%)\"]]ã //Informational hazard destroyed.// ã[[/span]]**\n\n----\n\n//Excerpts of the music-related magazine \"Rolling Stone\", 31 January 2027.//\n\n> ...

On Tuesday he was allowed onto the construction site for '1 Central' (A skyscraper planned to be built on Central Station, Sydney, anomalously made invisible so as to bypass air rights laws) and 150 workers were made redundant as a result. \n> \n> Following the news, a protest was organised, which is so far peaceful. Counter-protesters, mostly from anomalous communities, also arrived, and a small scuffle occurred near the Anzac memorial, resulting in one arrest. Breitbart reporters performed exclusive interviews on some of the protesters, showing that the people of the world are sick and tired of this anomalous menace. \n> \n> //\"I don't want to sound insensitive but, is it fair to be removed from your job because you were bet- born different? Is it?\"// One protester said. \n> \n> //\"These people think that they can steal our jobs!
