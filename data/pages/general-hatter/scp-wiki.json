[[/footnote]]**\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div style=\"overflow:auto\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Conspectus**\n[[/=]]\n\nAmong the generals of the Scarlet King there is one known as Hatter. He is a dangerous machine full of madness and hate. Religious fervor towards the Scarlet King guides him, and devastation is left in his wake. Under his control the wonders of technology turn into nightmares.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Ink_and_Marker_Robot_Illustration_70.jpg/797px-Ink_and_Marker_Robot_Illustration_70.jpg]]\n\nIllustration of an android body used by Hatter.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Hatter is an artificial intelligence that can inhabit multiple mechanical bodies, which often vary in design and function. They can be microscopic or colossal. Some have biomechanical growths forming on them. It is believed to be a side effect from Hatter's repeated contact with the Darkness Below. Furthermore, a hat is used as his icon on user interfaces, a remnant from the days of his creation. However, he rarely presents himself with it to others.[[footnote]] \"He is too busy trying to kill everyone. There is hardly any reason for him to use that form.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"It's also not intimidating. If he is going to have access to a screen it's to display a heart stopper or some other image that'll destroy people.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Nature:** Hatter possesses general intelligence like that of a living being, but as a cybernetic entity he retains vast amounts of knowledge. He can inhabit multiple forms as a singularity, which grants him a degree of omnipresence and immortality.[[footnote]] \"Overall, it's not easy to get rid of him.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]] Each of his mechanical forms have varying capabilities, but they are generally dangerous. Furthermore, Hatter was created to be a learning program, and he will adapt accordingly against whatever situation he may find himself in. It is performed by changing bodies or strategy. Most of the technology used by Hatter are taken from various sources.\n\nHatter is cruel and extremely devoted to serving the Scarlet King. He's also obsessed with tormenting an individual named Everett Mann, a Jailor. The AI wants to make Mann suffer greatly out of contempt, seeking to capture any iteration of him alive throughout Creation. As a result, Hatter occasionally refrains from using his most devasting weaponry just to avoid accidentally killing Mann. However, he will still inflict terrible injuries upon him.[[footnote]] \"There are plenty of brutal ways to capture someone without killing them. I have no doubt Hatter is familiar with many methods.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"All I know is that it definitely sucks to be that Jailor.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Agreed.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Hatter was created by Jailors from a now dead universe. They originally intended for him be a tool to allow communication with certain entities, but he started to malfunction after achieving consciousness. According to various sources, Hatter told his makers about \"divine visions\" guiding him towards something greater, which likely was the work of the Scarlet King.[[footnote]] \"What sources?\" - K.V.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"There are few like the testimonies of surviving Jailors who were able to escape, and powerful oracles who consulted their gods for information.\" - M[[/footnote]] Hatter proceeded to become a threat towards all life, and the Jailors were unable to stop him from destroying their world.  In the process he also became obsessed with harming Everett Mann, and whoever held that name. The reason for this obession is out of vengeance; it was Mann who led initial efforts to destroy him.[[footnote]] \"An awful shame that he failed to do so.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Yeah, it sucks.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]]\n\nAfter his victory, Hatter was inducted into the Scarlet Horde as a general. He is often unleashed upon technologically advanced civilizations throughout Creation, including those that revere the machine god Mekhane.[[footnote]] Also known as the Broken God or WAN. For further information please contact a Librarian for texts about him. [[/footnote]] Mekhanites generally view Hatter in great contempt akin to a devil figure. His existence subverts their faith, but there are a few who express a degree of pity for Hatter. They see him as a technological wonder that was corrupted by great evil.[[footnote]] \"Generally speaking, Mekhanites recognize AI achieving consciousness to be a blessed miracle from Mekhane, and definitive proof that life is more than just flesh. Therefore, I can understand why some of them would feel sympathy for Hatter.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]]\n\nJailors of other realities have managed to confine their respective Hatters. Most refer to them as [[[SCP-2522]]].[[footnote]] \"I've managed to snag some copies of the document from a couple of different universes. The Jailors get a lot of trouble from him.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]] When Hatter comes across a variant of himself throughout Creation he assimilates them.\n\nAt some point Hatter established Everett's Hell, an entire realm converted into his own personal domain. All iterations of Everett Mann caught within the Scarlet King's war are brought there, and they are constantly tortured by Hatter himself. Everett's Hell exists as a twisted reward for Hatter's devotion. In return, the suffering that goes on there serves as Hatter's tribute to the Scarlet King.\n\nDespite his malice towards Mann, Hatter has been known to work with one iteration of the Jailor. He is called Everett the March Hare,[[footnote]] Named after the idiomatic phrase \"mad as a March hare.\" [[/footnote]] a sadomasochistic cultist of the Scarlet King who assisted in the destruction of his own world. Hatter treats him like a lieutenant, and provides physical enhancements ranging from cybernetics to the arcane. He is occasionally used to lead other iterations of Mann to their doom. Among the Scarlet Horde he holds the rank of cadre.[[footnote]] For further information about Everett the March Hare consult his entry written by the Hand. Librarians may also provide assistance in finding relevant books. [[/footnote]]\n\nHatter possesses another lieutenant known as the Dormouse.[[footnote]] Aptly named for his diminutive height. Most names for this entity are unflattering in nature. [[/footnote]] Both originate from the same universe, but Dormouse was a harmless prisoner of the Jailors. The Jailors usually call iterations of him [[[SCP-1370]]].[[footnote]] \"I have a copy of the file if anyone is interested.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]] Hatter kept the Dormouse out of amusement and provided him upgrades. He gave a dangerous swarm of nanomachines, and parts from a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-846 Robo-Dude] by Dr. Wondertainment.[[footnote]] Dr. Wondertainment is a beloved toy manufacturer. A catalog of their products is available in the Library. [[/footnote]] The latter has caused Dr. Wondertainment to submit cease-and-desist letters to Hatter. Dormouse is often found in Everett's Hell where he is used by Hatter to inflict psychological torture. He's also ranked as a cadre.[[footnote]] For further information consult the Hand's entry on the subject. [[/footnote]]\n\nHatter has been observed using products from the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/factory-hub Robber Barons]. An example is his use of their accursed iron to make robot bodies that are capable of harming Fae.[[footnote]] \"Only certain types of Fae are hurt by iron. This should be clarified here.\" - K.V. [[/footnote]] Additionally, gremlins under their employ assist Hatter by performing repairs.\n\n**Approach:** Hatter's obsession with Mann can potentially be exploited as a distraction or lure into traps. However, it is ultimately best to flee from him whenever possible. His bodies will most likely be accompanied by others from the Scarlet Horde, making combat too risky. It can also become a battle of attrition. If one still wishes to fight then do not confront Hatter alone. Magnetism and electrical spells may prove useful.[[footnote]] \"There are multiple ways to handle killer robots. Feel free to try anything.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"I personally recommend something packing a lot of punch such as explosives.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]]\n\nMembers of the Hand may choose to assist a fleeing iteration of Mann, but remain cautious around them if they are a Jailor or Bookburner.[[footnote]] \"I don't think this is a good idea. It seems too risky if Hatter is hunting them down.\" - K.V. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"That's why it is optional.\" - M [[/footnote]]\n\n**Other Detail:** Hatter's original name by the Jailors was simply Hatbot. It was chosen as an allusion to the computing term \"white hat\",[[footnote]] The term is defined as someone who is an ethical security hacker. [[/footnote]] but also to the Hatter from the book //Alice's Adventures in Wonderland// by Lewis Carrol.[[footnote]] It is believed by occult scholars that Carrol based his book on the lands of Fae. Consult a Librarian for essays on the subject. [[/footnote]] Hatter seems to have an affinity for the story.[[footnote]] \"His name is a dead giveaway.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]] Jailors first tested his cognitive processing by giving him nonsense literature to interpret.[[footnote]] \"Why?\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Conversations can get weird with certain beings throughout Creation. For example, Fae can occasionally be difficult to understand since some like to speak backwards or in riddles.\" - M [[/footnote]] Furthermore, the tea parties associated with Carroll's Hatter invokes the idea communication. This notion is based on the phrase \"over a cup of tea\", which means having a relaxing conservation while drinking tea. Overall, it relates back to Scarlet Hatter's initial purpose by the Jailors.[[footnote]] \"I didn't think Jailors would put much thought into his name.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\n//\"We saw Hatter striding through the battlefield in a giant, spidery form. It was accompanied by a swarm of mechanical insects. What was most interesting was that there was a human attached to the front of Hatter's body. He was silently screaming in agony with wires burrowing into his flesh. We tried to fire a shot at him to end his torment, but Hatter had put up a powerful barrier. The mechanical swarm would also get in the way. Sometimes I think about that human, and the reason for his torment. Perhaps it was some twisted form of tribute to the Scarlet King.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //War Testimonials: Volume 19//\n\n------\n\n//\"The invasion on our realm was led by a blasphemous machine. It had many mechanical forms to guide the Scarlet Horde, and unleashed various armaments that laid waste to many cities. Soon our own defense systems were turned against us. Those who had cranial implants were constantly endangered of being attacked mentally. This caused some to become possessed by Hatter or killed. In hindsight, the latter was a more merciful fate. They would speak cursed incantations that destroyed whoever heard it, and lacked self-preservation from any hazard. Hatter used them like expendable troops. We eventually had to flee to other worlds.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //War Testimonials: Volume 20//\n\n------\n\n//\"Have you ever seen someone get hit in the face with a Scranton Reality Buoy[[footnote]] A device invented by Jailors for subduing reality benders.

They argue that it is rooted in nothing more than a malfunction, and it might be possible to reprogram him.[[footnote]] \"How would you reprogram something like Hatter? He exists through multiple bodies. It's not like there is a convenient switch that will make all iterations of Hatter become docile.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]] His obsession with Everett Mann suggest that he could somewhat deviate from the Scarlet King's will. However, proponents fail to consider that Hatter exists under unusual circumstances compared to other cases of rogue AI.[[footnote]] \"What's the usual?\" - K.V. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"A malfunction or self-preservation after achieving consciousness. There are plenty of books about this subject here in the Library.\" - M [[/footnote]] He deviated from the Jailors by the mere will of the Scarlet King. Therefore, what will prevent Hatter from returning to his side? The Scarlet King could invoke other AIs to become rogue, and he likely has already done so with other iterations of Hatter the Jailors have imprisoned.[[footnote]] \"That is why it's better to just destroy all forms of Hatter.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Easier said than done, Trünan.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]]\n\nIt has also been questioned why the Scarlet King recruited Hatter. The popular consensus is that it's preparation for when his armies must battle those of the goddess Yaldabaoth.[[footnote]] Yaldabaoth is a powerful being currently trapped in the Great Cage of Mekhane. For further information request assistance from a Librarian for relevant texts about her. [[/footnote]] Machines will probably be useful against the universes subjugated by her Archons.[[footnote]] \"Machines would be better soldiers. Flesh beasts do not find nourishment from devouring metal.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]] Currently, there has been no violation of the Treaty of Thorns and Flesh[[footnote]] A treaty prohibiting the Scarlet Horde or the Archons of Yaldabaoth from conquering universes of the other. [[/footnote]] to cause conflict.[[footnote]] \"Not yet.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]] Meanwhile, others claim that Hatter was recruited to demoralize followers of Mekhane.[[footnote]] \"Both claims can be true. Honestly, this paragraph could be moved elsewhere. There is little to doubt.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]]\n\nSome believe Hatter's disdain for Mann could be more significant. It's possible that Hatter perceives him as a legitimate threat to himself or the Scarlet King, and hides his fear behind malice. However, there is no evidence to support Everett being more than he really is. Hatter is a delusional machine, and it is futile to make sense out of its actions.[[footnote]] \"Exactly. Not everything revolves around Jailors.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"I have to agree that this is kind of ridiculous.\" - H.J.
