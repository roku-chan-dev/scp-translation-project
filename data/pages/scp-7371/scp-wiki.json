Every 20 days[[footnote]]A period corresponding to a uinal in the Haab calendar, the Mayan version of the Tzolk'in calendar[[/footnote]], prior to a Malob-event, the entity is to be provided with 5 kilograms of gold. At 11:25 AM on the first day of a uinal, all CCTV devices situated within the containment chamber of SCP-7371 are to be deactivated and remain so for a duration of 15 minutes. All existing footage of SCP-7371 engaging in a Malob-event is to be disposed of immediately without viewing of its contents. Personnel exhibiting any symptoms of illness or manifesting signs of --religious fanaticism-- ##gray|//pure love//##  are to be removed from SCP-7371's area of influence and receive immediate medical attention.\n\nShould a Taak-event take place, foundation personnel in a 500-meter radius are to be evacuated into the nearest shelter. Security operatives, equipped with level-A CROYANCE[[footnote]]Protective tactical armors designed to withstand concentrated levels of energies linked to the Divine.[[/footnote]] suits, are to patrol the facility during the event and neutralize any SCP-7371-1 instance on sight.\n\n+++++ **Description:**\n\nSCP-7371 is a sapient humanoid entity measuring 2.7 meters and weighing 286 kilograms. ##gray|//It's beautiful.//## The entity has dark-grey skin, with white ornamental markings resembling flames, located on the cranial and abdominal regions. The origin of these paintings remain unidentified. SCP-7371 displays four bat-like wings and two sets of horns. With the exception of its eyes, SCP-7371 possesses no facial features, resulting in its inability to speak.\n\nWithin a precise time frame and upon receiving materials of a specific quantity, SCP-7371 executes an unknown activity, identified as a Malob-event. The condition of SCP-7371, along with its influence on its environment when a Malob-event is not conducted at the proper time, is identified as a Taak-event.\n\nThe designation SCP-7371-1 is assigned to multiple diminutive entities similar in appearance to Alouatta pigra[[footnote]]Monkeys native of Guatemala.[[/footnote]]. ##gray|//They're family.//## Their skin is composed of alabaster[[footnote]]A form of gypsum, prized for centuries for its ease of carving, making it a popular choice for sculptures.[[/footnote]], however, this characteristic does not impede their movements. These entities display two enlarged, lizard-like eyes and share the same lack of facial features as observed in SCP-7371. Instances of SCP-7371-1 possess a level of intelligence on par with regular howler monkeys.\n\nSCP-7371-1 instances possess a viable and functional body, however, they exhibit indifference toward their own physical well-being. Notably, most of the SCP-7371-1 instances display no initiative to sustain themselves, and consequently succumb to starvation, a process that may extend up to three days following their manifestation. ##gray|//His most faithful ascetics.//##\n\n+++++ **Malob-Event:**\n\nAfter certain materials have been provided to SCP-7371 during the first day of a uinal, a Malob-event happens. \n\nThe entire event releases a potent flow of Akiva radiations[[footnote]]Energy linked to prayer and divine intervention.[[/footnote]] with a peak situated mid-Malob-event. \n\nAny living entity witnessing the event, either directly or remotely via CCTV footage, will experience internal combustion of the skull, with temperatures recorded at approximately 3.67*10^^4^^ Kelvin. In some of these occurrences, afflicted individuals have exhibited lava emanation from their cranial region. ##gray|//It makes for a beautiful firework.//## --It remains unclear whether this phenomenon is an intended consequence of SCP-7371 or the result of elevated levels of anomalous radiation.-- This phenomenon is voluntarily induced by SCP-7371. \n\nShould the Malob-event conclude without any disturbances, all living and sentient beings within a 500-meter radius will be subject to the ensuing effects:\n* significant release of endorphins within the brain\n* devout reverence towards SCP-7371\n* ##gray|//He is the air I breathe He is the light I see.//##\n* a slight euphoria\n\nThe psychological impacts of a Malob-event will diminish over a period ranging from one to three month, contingent upon the prior beliefs of the affected subject.\n\nFollowing a Malob-event, the containment chamber of SCP-7371 is devoid of any trace of the materials involved, with the rare exception of small accumulations of volcanic ash.\n\n+++++ **Taak-Event:**\n\nWhen the time for a Malob-event has come and no materials have been provided to SCP-7371, a Taak-event happens.\n\nDuring this event, individuals within a 500-meter radius are prone to contract an infectious disease in a severe form and SCP-7371-1 instances manifest seemingly at random inside the area of influence, regardless of the state of consciousness of SCP-7371. \n\nThroughout numerous of these events, SCP-7371 has been observed engaging in various activities within its containment chamber. These actions include pacing back and forth, clawing at the walls, placing an SCP-7371-1 instance on its lap and stroking it, or angrily glaring at the surveillance cameras. ##gray|//He waved at me once.//##\n\nThe SCP-7371-1 instances will forage the location of their appearance, subsequently delivering their collected items to SCP-7371 in what seems to be an attempt to initiate a new Malob-event. ##gray|//A holy work.//## The materials can include :\n* Personal items such as rings, pendants, bracelets, earrings, watches\n* Electrical components such as circuit boards, wires, batteries\n* Small animals such as rats, insects, cats\n* Any kind of food\n* Human body parts such as fingers, eyes, tongues, noses, teeth or ears\n* Other SCP-7371-1 instances when there is nothing else to give\n\nUpon presentation of an offering by an SCP-7371-1 instance within the containment chamber, SCP-7371 inflicts a wound on its arm using its claws and then applies a drop of its blood onto the forehead of said instance. The wound heals immediately after that.\n\nOnce a substantial quantity of materials has been accumulated, the SCP-7371-1 instances depart from the vicinity of SCP-7371 and proceed to wander the area without discernible purpose. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 7371.A\" hide=\"Close Addendum 7371.A\"]]\n**Dr. Rend** was tasked with identifying a dependable alternative to the gold utilized during Malob-events, due to its current exceedingly high cost and the risk of impact on the judgment of all personnel within the facility.\n\nExperiments were conducted at Remote Testing Ground-17-B situated 5 kilometers away from the main Site, throughout 3 different Malob-events.\n\nA D-class, different for every iteration of the experiment, was placed in a room neighboring the test chamber of SCP-7371 so they could not witness the Malob-events. They were given the task to describe how they were feeling at the end of each test and were then surgically and mentally examined. \n\nThe materials used in the course of the different experiments were selected after observation of the items gathered by SCP-7371-1 instances during Taak-events.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Experiment #1]]\nAn assortment of beef meat is provided to SCP-7371. The entity displays evident discontent, yet continues with the Malob-event.\n\n//The Malob-event is completed in 11.4 minutes.//\n\nIn the other room, D-4539 collapses on the ground. Surgical examination revealed that D-4539 had developed a functional third arm and heterochromia. No additional information was obtained from D-4539.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Experiment #2]]\n5 kilograms of silver are offered to SCP-7371. The entity stares at the camera with visible anger before proceeding with the Malob-event.\n\n//The Malob-event is completed in 16.4 minutes.//\n\nD-8524 instantly falls to the ground, visibly unconscious. Surgical examination revealed that most of the organs of the subject were turned to marble. D-8524 did not survive.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Experiment #3]]\nSCP-7371 is given a live goat. The entity appears disgusted at the animal but still carries on the Malob-event.\n\n//The Malob-event is completed in 8.42 minutes.//\n\nSCP-7371 seems irritated and carves ██████ ███████ on the walls using its claws. ##gray|//Duty calls.//## \nSubject D-3952 seemingly enters a state of euphoria. Psychological examination revealed symptoms similar to the usage of gold in Malob-event, but notably stronger. D-3952 was terminated after attempting to free SCP-7371 from containment. See Incident Report 7371.01 for further documentation.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Incident Report 7371.01\" hide=\"Close Incident Report 7371.01\"]]\n\n##gray|//I can't let them see this.//##\n\nThe Foundation became aware of this transcript only after Incident 7371.02, during an investigation of Dr. Rend's computer and belongings.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**BEGIN AUDIO TRANSCRIPT**\n\n-**Dr. Königswald**: This is Dr. Jeffrey Königswald, reporting pathologist for Site-17's coroner department, recording my preliminary remarks on D-3952, terminated after Mara's little tests on SCP-7371. I pray to God one day this lass learns empathy.\n\n//A clicking sound, quickly followed by the song \"Y'a d'la joie\", by Charles Trenet. The pathologist is humming the lyrics as he is carrying on the procedure. Dr. Königswald seems to be cutting the clothes of the deceased man using a pair of scissors.//\n\n-**Dr. Königswald**: I apologize for the indignity, my friend.\n\n//Grating sounds of a metal recipient being placed by Dr. Königswald under the operation table, presumably the bucket used for containing excised organs of the cadaver. Incision and sawing sounds followed by movement.//\n\n-**Dr. Königswald**: Mmh?\n\n//Another clicking sound, the music stops. Coughing and groaning sounds.//\n\n-**Dr. Königswald**: WHAT TH-\n\n//A loud sound of metal hitting something, followed by someone falling to the ground. The voice of a woman matching Dr. Rend's.//\n\n-**Dr. Rend**: Sorry Jeff.\n\n//More coughing sounds. A low, gravely voice speaks, matching D-3952's.//\n\n-**D-3952**: So you have seen my invitation, (//difficult breaths//) come, we have matters to discuss.\n\n-**Dr. Rend**: Yes Lord, but are you certain this is safe?\n\n-**D-3952**: Your safety is not my concern.\n\n-**Dr. Rend**: Of course, I apologize.\n\n-**D-3952**: Let us get straight to the point, I will not stand being within this lowly envelope any longer than need be.

All communication with Agent ██████ has been severed, and he is presumed to have been killed in action. ##gray|//He was too weak to serve.//##\n\nWithin the same week, the area witnessed a succession of robberies, violent homicides, extensive infrastructure damage, widespread riots, public executions, instances of arson as well as outbreaks of infectious diseases, including bubonic plague and leprosy, in addition to an isolated case of SCP-████.\n\nMTF Beta-7 (“Maz Hatters”) was deployed to secure SCP-7371 within the tumultuous city. The anomaly had amassed a significant contingent of devotees, along with numerous hundreds of SCP-7371-1 instances. The mission concluded with great difficulty, MTF Beta-7 suffering major casualties and one instance of betrayal from within. ##gray|//A new member in our family?//##\n\nA misinformation campaign of unprecedented scale is still to this day being conducted to cover up the events.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 7371.B\" hide=\"Close Addendum 7371.B\"]]\nThe subsequent transcript originates from a notebook originally belonging to Level 2 researcher R.████, and was discovered beneath a dislodged tile within the containment chamber of SCP-7371. CCTV footage revealed the entity concealing it. It appears that the entity took advantage of the 15-minute window during which CCTV surveillance is deactivated to engage in writing activities, when it had spare time following a Malob-event.\n  SCP-7371 exhibited aggression towards the Class D personnel sent to recover the item, but was swiftly sedated by the accompanying security operatives. \n\nThe texts were inscribed using a notably antiquated variant of Popti'[[footnote]]Mayan language from the Q’anjob’alan-chujean branch, spoken by the Jakaltek people.[[/footnote]], intertwined with an unidentified language. The following translation was accomplished over the course of several months, utilizing both pattern recognition AI technologies and the expertise of paralinguistic specialists from Site-12. The resultant prose exhibited an unexpectedly high level of sophistication despite being a roughly translated text. Research on the potential anomalous properties of the inscriptions is ongoing. Certain words remain untranslatable.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//My thrall[[footnote]]Identified to be a rogue SCP-7371-1 instance.[[/footnote]] has pilfered this curious parchment, upon which I inscribe my reflections.//\n\n//It shall serve me well.//\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//A span of 148 Obloths[[footnote]]Presumed to be a time measurement unit.[[/footnote]] has elapsed since my arrival to this continent.

SCP-7371 appears to be praying. Dr. Rend is immobilized on the ground and regardless of the evident crippling pain, she is praying as well.\n\n//Akiva radiation are emitted at an exponentially increasing rate.//\n\n**11:11:12** | An SCP-7371-1 instance emerges from the ventilation system and joins SCP-7371 in its act of prayer.\n\n//As the intensity of the radiation escalates, a faint voice speaking an unidentified language becomes audible.//\n\n**11:11:47** | Several SCP-7371-1 instances continuously manifest around SCP-7371, they all assume a deeply bowed position.\n\n//The amount of Akiva radiation reaches a concentration fatal to humans. Personnel present on-site are thus instructed to evacuate. MTF Eta-77 (“Spheres Within Spheres”) assisted by MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) are dispatched in the event that a dangerous pistiphage[[footnote]]An entity that feeds on faith, deriving sustenance and power from belief and worship.[[/footnote]] entity is released by SCP-7371.//\n\n**11:15:03** | The room darkens significantly and the air boils as a result of the anomalous radiation.\n\n//The MTF units are unable to approach the containment chamber of SCP-7371 due to the extreme amount of radiations.//\n\n**11:20:12** | The population of SCP-7371-1 instances in the containment chamber reaches 30 individuals and static electricity in the room is building-up massively, to a point where it is visible.\n\n//The concentration of Akiva radiation reaches an amount sufficient to alter nearby reality and a hurricane forms above Site-17.//\n\n**11:23:00** | A tear opens in the abdomen of Dr. Rend entirely flaying her. A blurry humanoid figure can be seen through.\n\n//A remotely controlled combat drone is sent to disrupt the ritual. The Apparition is evaluated to be a type 6 Behemoth on the Redwick-Nacht scale, with the potential to cause an HK-Class 'Deific Subjugation' scenario. The Alpha Nuclear Warheads are left on standby, to be activated should the ritual continue without interruption.//\n\n**11:24:36** | The drone reaches the cell while the tear expands, traversing the confines of the chamber by eating through the walls and ceiling.\n\n**11:24:39** | The doors to the cell are opened remotely. At the same time, the Apparition attempts to navigate through the tear, causing a 4.6 earthquake in the area.\n\n**11:25:41** | The drone enters the chamber while the Apparition, with one arm already manifested in this reality, is in the process of transitioning its remaining three arms. Six SCP-7371-1 instances rush towards the drone.\n\n**11:25:57** | The drone is slowly disassembled by the SCP-7371-1 instances. \n\n//Before being dismantled in its entirety, self-destruction protocol is triggered remotely. A countdown starts.//\n\n**11:26:07** | The Apparition has its abdomen in this reality, leaking an impossible amount of Akiva radiation and making the ground melt. SCP-7371 and the SCP-7371-1 instances all pray before the Apparition. \n\n//The countdown reaches an end, making the drone explode.//\n\n**11:26:13** | The manifestation of the Apparition is halted by the detonation, resulting in parts of its materialized form being severed as the tear closes. The Apparition seems to be deceased. SCP-7371, seemingly overwhelmed by anger, proceeds to exterminate every instance of SCP-7371-1.\n\n**11:26:58** | SCP-7371 breaches containment by forcefully rupturing the compromised doors.\n\n//SCP-7371 is intercepted and sedated by MTF Epsilon-11 54 minutes succeeding the end of the ritual, having caused major damage to the site and killed or injured several MTF units.
