In the near-two months this contest ran, we got 165 entries from 42 teams, of which 23 teams and their 124 entries ended up qualifying for victory. An incredible showing, by any margin -- the biggest contest the wiki has ever had, in fact, by a margin of 20 entries (shoutout Jamcon 2020). Thank you to every single person who participated, whether you were able to qualify or just post, or even if you never posted and just read some of the fantastic entries (seriously, take it from someone who read all of them - they're //great.//). This is the first contest I've run on the site, and you guys and your insane, wacky departments made it one to remember.\n\nAnd without further ado, the rankings:\n\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 🥇 FIRST PLACE 🥇\n++++ 637 UPVOTES\n[[/=]]\n+* Team Name: Marge is canonically incapable of farting\n**Department Name:** Fire Suppression Department \n**Team Members:** [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] (ˡᵉᵃᵈ ᶦᵐᵃᵍᶦⁿᵉᵉʳ), [[*user UraniumEmpire]], [[*user T Rutherford]]\n-----\n+++* Entries:\n* **[[[SCP-6630]]]: Fire on the Horizon** by [[*user T Rutherford]]\n* **[[[life-insurance-policy|Life Insurance Policy]]]** by [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n* **[[[SCP-6355]]]: A Choking Grip upon the Neck of Propriety** by [[*user UraniumEmpire]] and [[*user T Rutherford]]\n* **[[[turn-the-lights-off-when-you-leave|Turn the lights off when you leave.]]]** by [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 🥈 SECOND PLACE 🥈\n++++ 504 UPVOTES\n[[/=]]\n+* Team Name: Your Call Is Very Important To Us\n**Department Name:** Telecommunications Monitoring Office\n**Team Members:** [[*user Meserach]] ^^(cpt)^^[[*user Agente Shuffle]] [[*user BattleblockB0ss]]\n-----\n+++* Entries:\n[[[Hanging On The Telephone]]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/introductionfilm Picture This]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/maria-a-tale-of-the-tmo Maria]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/for-your-eyes-only-a-tale-of-the-tmo For Your Eyes Only]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-14-secure-facility-dossier WINTER]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5783 SCP-5783 - Accidents Never Happen]\n[[[Atomic]]]\n[[[Call Me]]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 🥉 THIRD PLACE 🥉\n++++ 439 UPVOTES\n[[/=]]\n+* Team Name: Ruiz Duchamp Memorial Contest Team Memorial Contest Team\n**Department Name:** Department of Interstellar Containment\n**Team Members:** [[*user TyGently]] ᶜᵖᵗ, [[*user ch00bakka]], [[*user GreenWolf]]\n-----\n+++* Entries:\n* **[[[damocles|The Damocles Initiative]]]** (Hub)\n # **[[[Stairway To The Stars]]]** by  [[*user ch00bakka]]\n # **[[[Harvester of Eyes]]]** by [[*user TyGently]]\n # **[[[Workshop of the Telescopes]]]** by [[*user GreenWolf]] and [[*user TyGently]]\n # **[[[SCP-6523]]] -- The Machine (ISV //Joyeuse//)** by [[*user GreenWolf]]\n # **[[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]]** by [[*user ch00bakka]], [[*user GreenWolf]] and [[*user TyGently]]\n # **[[[burnin-for-you|Burnin' For You]]]** by [[*user ch00bakka]], [[*user GreenWolf]] and [[*user TyGently]]\n* **[[[site anvil|Secure Planet Dossier: Site Anvil]]]** by [[*user GreenWolf]] and [[*user TyGently]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n||~ Place ||~ Qualifying Team Name ||~ Number of Entries ||~ Votes (Top 5 Entries) ||~ Additional Awards||\n||1||Marge is canonically incapable of farting||4|| 636 || A Random Day Memorial Jamcon Award||\n||2||Your Call Is Very Important To Us||9|| 504 || Stans | > tale author | Wait, We Can Do That? ||\n||3||Ruiz Duchamp Memorial Contest Team Memorial Contest Team||7|| 439 || Stans | > tale author | Wait, We Can Do That?||\n||4||Fifth Suit||6|| 415 ||\n||5||Team Fortress 3||5|| 413 || > tale author ||\n||6||Can't Wait to See It As a Team||7|| 336 ||\n||7||The Wiggles Hate Each Other in Real Life||4|| 330 || Stans | > tale author | Wait, We Can Do That? | A Random Day Memorial Jamcon Award||\n||8||Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe||4|| 192||\n||9||Whippersnappers||4|| 179 ||\n||10||No Keter Left Behind||9|| 154||\n||11||Xenophania||5|| 142 || WWE WRESTLEMANIA SMACKDOWN CHAMPION ||\n||12||TBD||4|| 142||\n||13||Why yes!

Everyone’s got their favorite one, and new ones ain’t shit if you can’t build on them. You’ve got all the big ones - the Antimemetics Division, the Pataphysics Department, the Ethics Committee. But the Foundation is a great big beast; those guys get all the attention, meanwhile there’s gotta be dozens, hundreds of other departments and divisions that toil endlessly away from the spotlight.\n\nThe Diplomatic Department, who make sure the international community continues to tolerate the Foundation. The Culinary Operations Division, responsible for feeding the Foundation’s hungry employees (and anomalies). And of course, that most sinister of Foundation units: Human Resources.\n\nThese, and countless others. Who are they? What are their niche specialties? What are their stories?\n\nQuestions for me to know and you to desperately try to answer with your compatriots in the highly-anticipated, edge-of-your-butt event known as…..\n\n[[=]]\n+ DEPARTMENTCON 2022\n\n[[/=]]\nand i’m your host, Scumbird Supreme, the Yurt, [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]].\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ What we’re trying to do here, you and I\n[[/=]]\nThis is a contest about creating new Foundation departments, divisions, committees, and branches. There’s a lot of creative freedom there, but one thing to emphasize is the word new. I understand a lot of people have their personal departments they’re working on, and while that’s completely respectable this contest is aimed more for building and expanding new ones than altering or developing existing ones. As such, there’s a (small) list that teams are going to be prohibited from selecting as their horse of choice, based on the number of pre-existing pages they have on the site and navigational notability:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAntimemetics Division\nAIAD\nAlchemy Department\nDepartment of Abnormalities\nDecommissioning Department\nDepartment of Miscommunications\nOffice of Tactical Theology\nEthics Committee\nPataphysics Department\n[[/div]]\n\nThere, not so bad. I have full faith you’ll come up with something wackier, wilder, and more insane that lets you spread your wings and fly.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to share this passage from the Doomsday Contest, where ARD said it better than I could:\n\n> There are multiple ways to approach this project. You can get together with some of your friends, write stuff, and have lots of fun doing it—regardless of winning or losing. Or, you can write, get angry at your friends for not performing the way you want them to. You can complain about them, the rules, the contest, the judges, and hate your life.\n> \n> Try to be a bit more classy. This is supposed to be a fun opportunity to add more to the site rather than make yourself upset, frustrated, or angry. People have quit over contests. You're better than that.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ The Contest\n[[/=]]\n\nYou will want to read this. I know how much some of you like reading the rules after deciding on your team, but seriously.\n\nYou and your team will make a new Foundation department. You will write things centered around building up this department. That means you can’t just write an unrelated skip about food and then drop one line in the containment procedures saying “The Department of Food will handle containment of SCP-XXXX”. We understand each other, right?\n\nYou will write a minimum of 4 articles, which will include at least one SCP and one tale. The rest are up to you. I would personally recommend including an Orientation-style tale, but like I said, up to you.\n\nVoting will be determined by the net rating of your top 5 entries.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ The Teams\n[[/=]]\n\n**You and your team will comprise a total of 3 people.** Not two, not four. You may be thinking ‘hey wait ROUNDERHOUSE every other team contest has had 3-4 people’ to which I say ‘haha sike’. More seriously: there’s been plenty of advance notice about the approximate time and theme of the contest, so I feel comfortable tossing a little gamechanger in. Keeps you guys on your toes, and hopefully inspires you to create some even more standout work. Necessity is the mother of innovation, after all. :)\n\nYou'll work together on the collection. Everyone must contribute significantly to the final product. It is expected that each team member will write at least one work. If the contest marshals get the idea that one guy is writing 100% of the content for their team there will be some investigation. I will consume any offenders.\n\nI’m not cruel, though. I understand things do come up. If there’s a real issue meaning someone won’t be able to post - please, contact me. We’ll figure something out.\n\nOnce posting begins, your magnificent trio are locked in and cannot change. Choose wisely. Once you’ve picked your team and decided on a captain amongst yourselves, add yourselves to the team roster at the bottom of this page using the provided format.\n\n**Looking for a team?** Comment in the discussion of this page saying so! Join up with other people also looking for a team!\n[[=]]\n+++ The Rules\n[[/=]]\n\n# Your team must consist of **three** people, all of whom must be announced. You may only be on one team. Each team will have a captain, but the individual members are responsible for posting their own work. Please pick someone who is actually around to be Captain, as all communication and questions about the contest should go through them to the organizers. Any other responsibilities the team chooses to invest in the captain should be discussed among the members of the team.\n# The Department/Division/Whatsit you pick shouldn’t be one of the ones on that list. That said, there are countless departments that have appeared in one-line mentions in articles and were never followed up on. Hell, there's a whole [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/departments-complete-list page of them right here] you can browse for inspo. You wanna pick one of those, be my guest. If I feel that you’re skirting this rule, we’ll sit down and talk and figure it out. Really the only hard rule is that it must be a department of the Foundation.\n * Department of X is not the required vocabulary. You can be the X Division, the X Committee, X Unit, etc etc.\n# Furthermore, you may **NOT** use drafts that existed before the contest went up. All entries must have been created after the contest page went up[[footnote]] Drafts that were not completed before the contest began may be admitted on a case-by-case basis. The general principle is less than 50% done; if you're not sure, feel free to ask.[[/footnote]]. Any entries found to violate this rule will be subject to disqualification.\n# SCP format screws are fine. The tale should be substantive and long enough to show that you've invested some time in them.\n# A minimum of 4 articles must be written for the contest; there is no maximum number, but only the five highest-rated articles will count towards point total. Once again, at least one of these must be an SCP, and at least one must be a tale. Art submissions will not be considered for this contest.\n# SCP supplements such as separate exploration logs, experiment logs, revised versions, etc. will count as extra entries past the main four. For example, if you have two tales, and two SCPs with two supplements each, the highest-rated of the four supplements will count as the fifth entry for voting purposes.\n# Teams may create hub pages for their work. However, hub pages will not count for scoring nor for the minimum article requirements. Furthermore, they cannot be put up until your team has posted the minimum required number of articles for the contest (4).\n# You may not delete or edit an article once posted, regardless of performance. Articles that dip to the deletion mark will be subject to normal deletion practices, but they will not be removed until after the contest has ended. This should encourage everyone to work hard with their teams to have a superior product. What's posted is posted. Small corrections are fine, but significant edits are not.\n * Small corrections are defined as: fixing minor sentence wording, correcting grammar usage, changing spacing, etc. Large, substantive changes are not allowed until the contest has passed.\n# Each entry must be posted by its primary author. Collaborative entries between teammates are encouraged but each author must contribute at least one (1) entry which was mainly written by them. If you rewrote someone’s work entirely, it's not really theirs anymore, and it wouldn't be fair for them to post something you spent four hours revising when they only invested ten minutes writing it. This does mean that one or two people will be writing more than one entry.\n# Any member who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests. Site members who are not participating in the contest but do this sort of thing may be subject to Disciplinary action, in addition to the personal wrath of the Yurt.\n * Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to:\n  * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted\n  * Spamming people with PMs about your work\n  * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's\n * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to PM me asking.\n\nAfter posting your entries, tag them \"departmentcon2022\" and link them to your team's blurb at the bottom of this page. Winners will be decided by the total points across the team's five highest-rated entries. The winners will have their work featured on the frontpage and possibly other prizes. Runner-ups (2nd & 3rd place) will be rewarded by having an article of theirs (their choice) featured on the front page.\n\n[[=]]\n++++++ Additional Awards\n[[/=]]\n\nI'll be periodically updating this through the planning phrase as I think of stuff, but I will be offering fun little challenges teams are encouraged to complete to earn my pleasure. There are no point bonuses, no real thing you get from completing these: just bragging rights and my distant approval. And maybe a shoutout at the end. We’ll see.\n\nAlso, these are obviously jokes. Don't take them too seriously.\n\n+++++ Stans\n//Name all articles in your series after songs from the same artist.//\n\n+++++ > tale author\n//Finish the contest with one SCP and at least three tales.//\n\n+++++ Wait, We Can Do That?\n//Write a Site dossier as part of the contest.
