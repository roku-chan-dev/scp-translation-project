However, they are to be under constant surveillance to continually oversee their anomalous capabilities. Drs. Abigayle Quinlan and Windsor Gladwyn of the Department of Psychometrics are currently overseeing their research.\n----\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7571 is the designation given to an anomaly presently affecting two human individuals currently employed by the Foundation; hereafter known as SCP-7571-A and SCP-7571-B.\n\nSCP-7571-A is Senior Researcher Dr. Roman \"Rome\" Collymore, the Deputy Chair of the Archives and Revisions Section of Site-400. SCP-7571-A is a Caucasian adult male of British-Scottish descent, with brunet hair and brown eyes. SCP-7571-A is 26 minutes older than SCP-7571-B.\n\nSCP-7571-B is Communication Specialist Rowan \"Collin\" Collymore, the Chief Executive of Site-400's Office of Telecommunications Monitoring. SCP-7571-B is a Caucasian adult male of British-Scottish descent, with brunet hair and brown eyes. SCP-7571-B is 26 minutes younger than SCP-7571-A.\n\nOn the 5th of March, 2019, SCP-7571 spontaneously manifested as the capability of both SCP-7571-A and SCP-7571-B to directly communicate and interface their own thoughts with each other via a psychological telepathic link. Research into the limits of this link is ongoing.\n----\n**ADDENDUM 7571-1:** Experiment Log\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #696969; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"]]\n**Experiment 7571-1/A**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px\"]]\n**Date:** 08/03/2019\n**Presiding:** Dr. Abigayle Quinlan and Dr. Windsor Gladwyn\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px\"]]\n\n**Procedures:** Both SCP-7571-A and SCP-7571-B were placed within two different holding chambers.  SCP-7571-B was presented with a questionnaire relating to world history and is instructed to answer all of them correctly. Permission to seek help from SCP-7571-A was granted.\n\n**Observations:** SCP-7571-B was able to answer all of the questions with complete accuracy. As expected, he attempted to telepathically communicate with SCP-7571-A to request the answers to the questions.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #696969; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"]]\n**Experiment 7571-2/A**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px\"]]\n**Date:** 10/03/2019\n**Presiding:** Dr. Abigayle Quinlan and Dr. Windsor Gladwyn\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px\"]]\n\n**Procedures:** SCP-7571-B was temporarily transported to Research and Development Site-45, located in Western Australia. Meanwhile, SCP-7571-A was transported to Research and Containment Site-43, situated in Canada. Both of them were then instructed to communicate with each other via a telepathic link.\n\n**Observations:** SCP-7571-A and SCP-7571-B were able to establish a connection despite the sizeable distance (approximately 16,270 kilometers). Both individuals were subsequently returned back to Site-400 without incident.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #696969; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"]]\n**Experiment 7571-3/A**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px\"]]\n**Date:** 17/03/2019\n**Presiding:** Dr. Abigayle Quinlan and Dr. Windsor Gladwyn\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px\"]]\n\n**Procedures:** SCP-7571-A was singularly exposed to an Artificial Regulated Memetic Agent (ARMA-567: a photo that causes viewers to sneeze three times). SCP-7571-A was asked to \"send\" SCP-7571-B the same image of the photo through a telepathic connection.\n\n**Observations:** SCP-7571-B mentally \"received\" the image of the photo and sneezed thrice.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #696969; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"]]\n**Experiment 7571-4/A**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px\"]]\n**Date:** 18/03/2019\n**Presiding:** Dr. Abigayle Quinlan and Dr. Windsor Gladwyn\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px\"]]\n\n**Procedures:** SCP-7571-B was singularly told \"classified information\" regarding an unrelated anomaly, and was asked to keep said information verbally and telepathically hidden from SCP-7571-A. Afterward, SCP-7571-A was ordered to delicately \"probe\" SCP-7571-B's mind in order to uncover the information.\n\n**Observations:** Following some time, SCP-7571-A finally declared that he has failed on uncovering the \"classified information\" from SCP-7571-B.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n**ADDENDUM 7571-2:** Incident Log // Neutralization\n\nOn the 13th of July, 2019, SCP-7571-A and SCP-7571-B were among the individuals captured and held hostage within Site-400's auditorium by Chaos Insurgency operatives during the \"[[[scp-7742|Great 4:00 AM Raid]]]\". Despite objection from SCP-7571-B, SCP-7571-A attempted to provide a distraction in order for the other hostages to escape. Unfortunately, he was found out by one of the Insurgents and killed via gunshot.\n\nThankfully, MTF Bowe-47 (\"How I Became a Martyr\")[[footnote]]A task force specializing in the neutralisation of threats associated with GoI-051, or the Chaos Insurgency.[[/footnote]] was able to breach the auditorium from the outside and terminate the Insurgents before any more casualties occurred. At the request of SCP-7571-B, SCP-7571-A was buried near the sessile oak tree located in Site-400's courtyard, along with the other personnel who regretfully perished during the raid.\n\nSCP-7571 has been redesignated as Neutralized. Its document will be updated accordingly.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/heckfire-twin/grave.jpg |\n    caption=Site-400's courtyard, with the sessile oak tree visible. |\n    align=center |\n    width=270px\n]]\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= __**Transcript of Therapy-Session 7571-B/#49**__\n\n**Date:** 17/01/2022\n\n**Personnel Present:**\n\n* Dr. Abigayle Quinlan\n* Specialist Rowan Collymore\n----\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Quinlan:** Welcome back, Collin.
