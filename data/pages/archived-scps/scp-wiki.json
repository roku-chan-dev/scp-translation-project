  "content": "From [http://www.scp-wiki.net/deletions-guide the Deletions Guide]:\n\n> -ARC refers to pages which have been archived instead of deleted outright. Archived pages are appended with -ARC. There are a few reasons for a page to be archived rather than deleted. Most often, it’s because an SCP is old and referenced in Tales, and its wholesale deletion would muddle works which reference it. There are also things that Staff simply want to keep around, albeit off the main list. The process for archiving a page is identical to the process for deletions, with suggestions for -ARC typically occurring after initiation of the deletion vote, save the page is renamed rather than culled.\n\nRegular users may not add to this page, nor do you get a call in archiving your own article in most cases.  For more information on these articles, please contact a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/contact-staff staff member].\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n+ Archived SCP Articles -- Referential Integrity\n\nThe following SCPs were archived due to backlinks or references in Tales or Supplements that would lose important context if the page were to be entirely deleted.\n\n* [[[eberstrom-s-proposal-arc | Eberstrom's Proposal]]] for SCP-001 - Site-19\n* [[[SCP-048-ARC]]] - \"Joey\"\n* [[[SCP-049-ARC]]] - Plague Doctor\n* [[[SCP-091-ARC]]] - Wood Nymph\n* [[[SCP-132-ARC]]] - Sufferer of the World's Sorrow\n* [[[SCP-157-ARC]]] - The \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\"\n* [[[SCP-244-ARC]]] - Egg Walker\n* [[[SCP-400-ARC]]] - A Telephone Box\n* [[[SCP-494-ARC]]] - Communication Torus\n* [[[SCP-515-ARC]]] - Butterfly Camera\n* [[[SCP-517-ARC]]] - A Demon Born From War\n* [[[SCP-728-ARC]]] - Flying Deer\n* [[[SCP-776-ARC]]] - A Slightly Unlucky Die\n* [[[SCP-784-ARC]]] - Posthuman Brain\n* [[[SCP-922-ARC]]] - Proust's Lunchbox\n* [[[SCP-1023-ARC]]] - A Broken Telekill Sword\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n+ Archived SCP Articles -- Staff Purview\n\nThe following SCP Articles were archived by staff purview.
