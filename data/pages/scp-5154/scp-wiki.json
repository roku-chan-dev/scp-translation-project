Personnel are not to engage in conversation with SCP-5154  without approval from the SCP-5154 Project Lead (presently Dr. Ahmad Punjari). Given its manipulative tendencies, all communications with SCP-5154 are to be closely monitored and reviewed.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5154 refers to a gestalt collection of handmade dolls constructed of cotton, polyester, and various plastics. The dolls that comprise SCP-5154 are attached at the wrists with cotton thread and are incapable of independent movement, however, the object is capable of speech through an unknown mechanism. SCP-5154 will attempt to engage passers-by in conversation, invariably seeking to establish a contractual relationship of some kind, typically offering freedom to D-Class personnel in exchange for various herbs, animal carcasses, incenses, and minerals. To date, SCP-5154 has requested sage, salt, a spider, an amethyst, myrrh, a cervid skull, and unscented candles from various D-Class personnel. SCP-5154 presents multiple distinct personalities, each conducting themselves in a manner conducive to the establishment of a seemingly mutualistic verbal agreement. The nature of these agreements is highly variable, but none have been successfully carried out prior to the events of Addendum 5154.1.\n\nSCP-5154 was discovered in an abandoned and severely dilapidated bungalow in LoI-504 (\"[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/larue-hub|La Rue Macabre]]]\"), three miles east of the settlement proper. Undercover Foundation agents operating in La Rue Macabre were investigating rumors of the disappearance of Adélaïde Hecaud, an elderly resident who had not been seen in town for approximately three months. The corpse of Mrs. Hecaud was found in her bed, having died of acute myocardial infarction approximately nine weeks earlier. SCP-5154 was found in the basement of the residence on top of an end table, surrounded by black gunpowder and 4 bottles of home-brewed dark rum. The Foundation was contacted after the object attempted to converse with the agents.\n\n**Addendum 5154.1:** Incident Log\n\nPreliminary testing via indirect communication has demonstrated that SCP-5154 is incapable of fulfilling any requests made of them by D-Class personnel, as the object possesses no means by which to manipulate its surroundings or utilize the solicited payment. Direct interactive testing was to be carried out under the supervision of the SCP-5154 Project Lead Dr. Ahmad Punjari.\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Purpose:** To establish the abilities of SCP-5154 to negotiate, enter, and execute a verbal contract via direct interaction.\n@@ @@\n[[size small]]**Date and Time:** 02 February 2009, 1803 EST[[/size]]\n[[size small]]**Subjects:** Dr. Ahmad Punjari, D-3415, SCP-5154, ##DA70D6|SCP-5154##, ##firebrick|SCP-5154##[[/size]]\n[[/<]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n//[D-3415 is ushered into the containment chamber, and the item locker containing SCP-5154 is disarmed.]//\n\n**Dr. Punjari:** D-3415, please approach the containment locker and open the door.\n\n//[D-3415 approaches the containment locker and opens the door to reveal SCP-5154.]//\n\n**SCP-5154:** What do we have here, brothers?\n\n**##firebrick|SCP-5154##:** A friend perhaps?\n\n**D-3415:** Oh fuck, y'all can talk.

As I'm sure you've already figured out, those ain't just any old voodoo dolls. They're property of my old friend, Kalfu. Old lady Adélaïde'd been keeping him cooped up all these years now, keeping him stocked up on powder n' rum. Surprised y'all didn't figure it out right then and there, but I guess y'all don't know your voodoo like ya should, eh? But now she's gone and you lot done scooped up some of the cleverest spirits this side of the Mississip'.\n\nSince y'all don't seem to know who you're messin' with, lemme educate ya. Kalfu is Bealsey-Bub, the Ol' Boy himself. He's bad luck, disorder, chaos. He's more clever than you, he's quicker than you, he'll swipe your soul with a grin a mile wide. A meetin' on his crossroads ain't likely to end well for y'all, don't matter how clever you fix yourself to be. Let me be crystal clear with you fellas -- Kalfu ain't the type to be triflin' with.  Adélaïde and I locked him up years ago, but now he's got a new soul to play with since you Foundation folk can't keep your noses outta places you shouldn't be sniffin'.\n\nMy advice? Lock up them dolls and throw away the key. Ain't no good gonna be comin' from 'em. Leave this ol' ghost to La Rue. Me 'n the spooks'll sort 'em out.\n[[>]]\nKindest regards,\nPapa Legba\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5153]]] | SCP-5154 | [[[SCP-5155]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author: TheMightyMcB and Lukerz]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** VoodooDolls\n> **Name:** Voodoo-dolls.JPG\n> **Author:** Mysticvoodoo\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voodoo-dolls.JPG\n> **Derivative of:** \n> **Additional Notes:** The dolls were created by Denise Alvarado\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
