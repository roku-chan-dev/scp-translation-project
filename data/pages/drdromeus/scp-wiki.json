There’s a thirst in that dry, dry body, more unbearable than you could ever think. All I know then is that I need to drink. Blood, more than anything else. All I can do is watch as I kill people, rip them apart.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nYes, my first article was a keter humanoid \"monster what kills you\" (kids, don't try this at home!) and yes I have no shame. My inspiration? Mummies are scary. So I made a mummy. Then I kinda just kept going and threw in a bit of spooky and some Egyptian mythology and kept adding until I liked what I had. The ending just sort of came to me while I was writing so I threw it in and luckily it just worked. I made the mummy picture myself too - twice, actually, since the first time I failed to navigate the tricky waters of CC-compliancy correctly. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about image manipulation so I just kinda did my best and put a lot of time into it and I think it looks pretty good.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[SCP-3416]]] - \"The Great Anoati!\"\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//**SCP-3416:** It is too late! This place has boxed me in and refused my wishes! I must express my wrath!//\n\n//Security Officer ████’s helmet, which was not properly attached to his tactical suit, begins floating two feet above his head.//\n\n//**SCP-3416:** The wrath of the great Anoati has begun!//\n\n//Security Officer ████ grabs his helmet and clips it back to his suit.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nAnoati! Oh, how could you not love the little god? This one came from an idea of a \"powerful\" island god getting taken by the Foundation and finding out its abilities aren’t worth two cents here. Then I thought it would be funny to have it relate its woes to a therapist, but the relationship began becoming more like a friendship almost as I wrote it so I stuck with it. First SCP I wrote that breached 50 upvotes so that’s pretty cool. Ya can’t help but love Anoati, am I right?\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[SCP-5189]]] - \"Siren Kelp\"\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Consumption occurs at a slow rate for specimens of SCP-5189, being approximately one bite each half-hour. Because no organs are attached to their mouths, the victim’s flesh and viscera, once chewed, floats out of the mouth and into the surrounding water. This results in a frequent red coloring of the water around instances of SCP-5189.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nWritten for 2021 JamCon. This short piece comes from a profound fear of kelp I have realized I possess. It’s irrational, but that stuff scares the shit out of me whenever I snorkel. I tried to convey some of that fear into this article, with a healthy dose of gore on top of that. It’s not my best-received piece, but I enjoy the simplicity of it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[SCP-5184]]] - \"SCOTLAND FOREVER\"\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//While useful as incentives for testing, the health risks of a chipmunk consuming a full can of beer and smoking cigarettes regularly have been deemed too high to be allowed to continue.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was a situation where the pictures came first and I worked backwards - I’m not exactly sure why I decided the two images I’d use would be a chipmunk with beers and a pro-Scottish independence web ad, but I’m pretty glad I went with it because I think it’s a nice little article. A little absurd, a little funny, and a little sad. Hasn’t been read very much, but I’m fond of it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[SCP-7064]]] -\"Manly Man and the Power of Friendship\"\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Footage from the cell shows that instead of killing D-17383, SCP-7064 noticed a Kansas City Chiefs poster, which led to the two conversing over shared interests in football, beer, and exercise. During this time, D-17383 gave SCP-7064 the name \"Guy.\"//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nSome days you just wake up and want to write about monster cavemen dudebros. This article went through numerous rounds of critique and definitely took some time to get right, but I’m glad I was able to hammer the story into a shape that I think really works.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\n++ [[[Pizzicato]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Were there really no other options?

Still firm, but quiet.//\n\n//\"Execute Procedure Pizzicato.\"//\n\n//The sun rose to mark the new doomsday.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI wrote this one pretty quickly for my Doomsday Contest team, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/last-light-hub Last Light], but I still think it’s a pretty good read. There’s not much about Procedure Pizzicato really out there, so imagining what it would look like from a bunch of different perspectives made for a fun little project. If you wanna give it a read, make sure you check out the other stuff the team did too, because it’s all pretty great.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[Ducks, Yucks, and a God]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//“Heh heh, I sez we break his neck!” Tiny shouted, pulling out a large bat.//\n\n//“Ya ignoramus, he ain’t got no neck!” Pinstripes yelled back.//\n\n//“Silence! Anoati has no need for your blathering! What brings you…creatures to this place?” Anoati asked, hovering a few feet from the ground.//\n\n//“Whatcha think? We’re here fo’ da cash! Now where ya hidin’ it?!” The Boss menaced, poking a wing at Anoati.//\n\n//“You come seeking the fabled treasure of Anoati!? Begone, for it is far beyond your reaches, you strange duck-creatures! Your greed serves only to annoy me!”//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nOh, now this was fun to write. Done for the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-oct-hub Original Characters Tournament]. It’s not every day you’re tasked with writing a story about a grandiose but not-very-powerful island god, comedic mobster rubber ducks, and a sentient joke, but that’s what made this story happen. That was a fun tournament.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[Battle for the Minds]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Sarah watched out the back of the van through a dirty window in the door. Dull orange dunes sprinkled with greying bushes rolled past, a landscape stuck on loop over and over again. She grew impatient.//\n\n//“What’s in these boxes, anyways?”//\n\n//“Why, they are the van-beast’s organs, simple Sarah! Is that not obvious?”//\n\n//“No, vans aren’t- this isn’t- you know what? I’ll explain later.“//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nA weak island god, a brain hacker, and a mad neuroscientist walk into a tale. The result? Another weird entry for the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-oct-hub Original Characters Tournament]! This was just as fun to write as the first one. After this one, however, I was out of the contest, so I never really continued the story after leaving it on a cliffhanger. That’s on me, sorry guys. Maybe one day I’ll wrap it up nicely. It’s been a little while though.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[A Fishbowl, Shattered]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//To make an incredibly long story short, everything is real. Everything. There are monsters, aliens, cursed objects, and anything you could ever imagine trying to hurt you out in this world that is so much bigger than you thought. You still with me?//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nAh, the first of the Dromeus Monologue trilogy! This was written in one sitting in a burst of passion, and I decided it would be a good way to bring Dr. Dromeus into the SCP universe. I mean, all the other cool kids get their author OCs, so why not me? I do really like this tale though, and I think it’s a good introduction to people who are newer to the site or SCP lore.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//That’s why you’re now the new editor in chief. Because you don’t hate what you don’t understand. Use that clarity and shine a light into the darkness.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nCo-written with [[*user CanOfSoup]] as part of the Canon Renaissance Contest as [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic]. It was a blast working with Soup, and believe me when I say it won’t be the last time, because we’ve got things planned in the future that’ll knock your socks off. But anyways, this tale serves as an end to the Iris Arc and an introduction into my Kelly arc, and I’m proud of how we ended this arc and set up the next one.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[The Ranger with the Big Iron on his Hip]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Maybe he did wonder if he’d done too much, but it wasn’t important. He had a job to do, and not hell nor high water would get in the way of his justice.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nBIG IRON ON HIS HIIIIIIIIIP. Okay, where was I? Ah yes, Edward Kelly. This duology from the Canon Renaissance Contest’s [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic] was not read or liked by many, but I really liked it. Fun to write and fun to read, at least according to me. It was a blast converting SCPs and GoIs to the Aces and Eights canon, and then having a hardened lawmaker fight them. Also got to listen to a bunch of western songs for \"research\" so that was fun.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[Mama, put my Guns in the Ground - I can’t Shoot them Anymore]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//He could join in his fellow agents and shoot this running man down like a dog in the cold, and maybe his life would feel normal again.//\n\n//But just thinking that brought back the cries in the back of his head.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nAlso part of the Canon Renaissance Contest’s [http://www.scpwiki.com/team-epitaphic-hub Team Epitaphic] and the second part of the Kelly duology. The original goal was to have the outlaw at the end be Nathan Rivers, letting each of the stories connect to each other, but that didn’t work out so it’s just some outlaw. I mean, the meaning still stands and I like how it works out, but it could’ve been nice. It may also be confusing why I chose for the ending song to be “Hurt,” by the Nine Inch Nails, when every other song used was a western. Well, the answer is Johnny Cash. I loved his version enough that I chose to have it frame the ending scene.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[An Opportunity, Gained]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//There’s a thousand fires that need to be put out right now so let’s get this done with. You, Junior Researcher Henry Dromeus, have just survived a major site disaster.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nPart 2 of the Dromeus Monologue trilogy. I liked the first tale enough I decided to keep going! After all, I couldn’t just leave him as a junior researcher, right? So, each tale is a different promotion, letting me establish some things the character has been through and leaving me on a level where I can write some fun stuff I’ve got planned.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[The Mulhausen Incident]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//A large fleshy orb with a sickly black hue floated in the center of the chamber, unmoving. It was bigger than the notes had said, towering almost three times larger than a normal person, with short, tentacle-like protrusions scattered across its surface. A dark hole, large enough for one to enter, was present in a lower region of the sphere. It throbbed and undulated slowly, as if waiting for something.//\n\n//\"Meu Deus.\" Junior Researcher Santos said//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis is the best thing I have ever written. If you love me you will read this. After literally spending years writing and rewriting and revising, I’m very proud of the result. SCP-002 is one of the highest-rated articles on the site, yet there is almost nothing written related to it. So I took matters into my own hands, taking the good and the bad and trying to interpret the article into something that made sense for me. The article hints at things such a space-based origin, perception-altering abilities, and, of course, a \"Mulhausen Incident\" which is completely redacted. I took all those elements and made sure to incorporate them into the story. Of course, the theme of \"home\" was necessary too, as the anomaly literally looks like a home, so I made its abilities fit more into that theme and made this theme relate to the characters as well. All in all, couldn’t be more proud of the results. Read it, please.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[A Risk, Taken]]]\n\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n\n//Let me start out by saying you are one stupid son of a bitch.//\n\n//Don’t respond. We’re going back to the old days, just me talking and you listening.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThe finale of the Dromeus Monologues Trilogy! Now that he’s introduced, I’ve got big plans for this guy, don’t worry. This isn’t the last time you’ll see him. This article, like all of the previous ones, was written in a burst of inspiration. I had an idea for how I wanted Dromeus to fit in to the SCP universe and I just sort of started writing it in the same monologue style I’ve been doing. Hopefully it sticks.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ [[[First Day at the Department of Oral Hygiene]]]\n\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n\n//This is the main lobby. Mind the cords. And the leaks. I know it may not look it, but in this department are some of the most efficient and capable people working to keep the peace, and one of the most important to the containment of anomalous objects. We have a duty to protect the interests of the world’s people and maintain the veil by providing top-notch dental care.//\n\n//I am not joking, son. I do not joke.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy contribution to DepartmentCon! Now, were we very successful? Maybe not. Did we end up in last place? Possibly. BUT, did we also end as a qualifying team at the end of the contest? Yes! But jokes aside, I feel there is huge potential with the Department of Oral Hygiene, and you will see them again some day!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab GOI Formats]]\n++ [[[KTE-6024-Blit-Nuntius]]]\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"border:1px solid black;\"]]\n//Everyone is afraid, but no one knows what to do. Nobody knows when it'll strike, or who it'll strike. In a single moment everyone else's words can blur and lose meaning. Your words become nonsense to everyone. You can no longer read, and you can no longer write, possibly forever.//\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Author’s Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy first, and so far only, GoI format! Written for the Doomsday Contest in [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/last-light-hub Team Last Light]. If I’m being honest, it was hard as hell. The GOC format requires a lot of research and made-up tech lingo. But after researching it, I do actually like it a lot. You basically make a piecemeal story out of these different types of documents, and you get to tell it in a linear fashion, unlike in the SCP format. I also played around with the idea of these \"member organizations\" that make up the GOC command affecting their operations and supplies, which is definitely something I want to play with more in the future. The team definitely played around with lots of ideas about a post-countermeme world that never got written, but I’ll return to it one day.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab About Me]]\nHello! This is where I put miscellaneous information about myself, I suppose. \n\nWell, first off, I am always 100% open to collaborating with whoever wants the help, no experience writing an article required. Just send me a message! It is important to note though that I do disappear from the wiki, sometimes for months at a time, so if I don’t respond or you don’t want to chance it, you can always message me for my Discord. Despite my sometimes lacking motivation, though, I can be a great help and I love working with others.\n\nIf you want to write anything related to something I’ve created, go for it! I would love if you contact me so I can offer input (and just because I’d be so flattered, gosh), but you don’t have to. Just having it exist is nice enough.\n\nThank you for reading my works!\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
