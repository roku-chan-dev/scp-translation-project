She opened a bottle of mineral water and took a swig.  They had moved away from the office into a conference room Euboea had turned into a kitchen of sorts, with burner plate and minifridge.\n\n“That’s a complicated subject.”\n\n“We have time.”\n\nEuboea sighed and sat at the conference table, folding his hands over his stomach.\n\n“For one thing, you seem to be the only one of your organization interested in killing her.  Containment does not shield my people from harm.  We need her gone.”\n\n“Aren’t many of your people [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/an-scp-masquerading-as-a-tale | working with Varga now]]]?”\n\n“Some, but that hardly changes anything.

He took out a pan and emptied the contents into it and started the burner.  He began to stir the contents with a wooden spoon.\n\n“Why does the Matriarch have beef with you?”\n\n“Several millennia ago, my Father destroyed her civilization.  Or at least, provided a final stroke in the killing blow that history and various other power struggles had started.  The Daevites were strong for a very long time, thousands of years really.  But eventually, they began to weaken.  Rebellions from the Nälkän people, competing nation states, and honestly, they were an evolutionary dead end.  They spent so much time preserving their life, they failed to innovate.  You’ve seen how she uses the same tactics in multiple conflicts?  Overwhelm with numbers.  That’s what they did so often in the end.  Slave armies made up of conquered peoples and thaumaturgic constructs.  And that’s what she tried when my Father created a stronghold in her territory.”\n\n“The [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5957 | tower in Russia]]].”\n\nHe stirred as he nodded.  “Her forces surprised us and ravaged the stronghold.  All the work we had done there was lost.”\n\n“Looked like a goddamn torture gallery.”\n\n“No, not torture.  We were making new people, new life forms.  Trying to elevate mankind.”\n\n“Fucked up way to go about that.  Making monsters.”\n\n“They weren’t monsters, but it’s not important enough to debate about.  We wanted… well, he wanted to elevate men, to better survive the anomalous, the magical.  Human beings are incredibly vulnerable and despite all the work the Foundation has done to hide away the horrors, this is still a very dangerous world.”\n\n“Where did he come from?”\n\n“I don’t know the details really, He didn’t confide in me so much as order me around, but they are a wandering species.  System to system, interfering with the natural order and seeding life.”\n\n“So, it is literally an alien species.”\n\n“Yes, ‘it’ is. They all are.  And it’s hard to understand them, like so many advanced beings.  But I can say this, they’re fickle.  They think the work is done and they move on.”\n\n“Not your pops, right?”\n\n“No, He stayed.  They left him and he stayed to oversee the development of life.  Eventually, I think he became lonely or wanted a catspaw to interact with the apes, so he made me.”\n\n“Like in a test tube?”\n\n“No, he took me from my tribe.  This was nearly twenty thousand years ago, give or take, so it’s not very clear in my mind.”\n\n“Come on.”\n\n“I’m serious.  I’ve done some research, and I was basically a caveman in central Asia when he took me.  My tribe didn’t have a name other than the people; we barely knew other people existed.  He plucked me up and shaped me, made me into this.”\n\n“You said he was alone, but we saw [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5512 | another one]]] in Boston.”\n\n“Some of them came back to see how He was doing.  They wanted very little to do with me when they found out He was dead, but they stayed for a while to help me.”\n\n“With?”\n\n“My people.”\n\n“Whatever you did to your cultists.”\n\n“I made them like me. To an extent.”\n\n“Which is what?”\n\n“A conduit for thaumaturgy.  Instead of rites or rituals, we can simply access that power.  Your Captain Zadeh, she had to put tremendous energy into preparing for her thaumaturgy, right?”\n\n“I don’t know that much about it but yeah, she would prep evocations before hand to be used in the thick of things.”\n\n“Right, well my people don’t have to do that.  Neither do I.”\n\n“So, like, are they immortal too? Super strong, all that?”\n\n“No.  I don’t know what my father did to me to make those things happen, it seems to defy the structural physics of a human body.”\n\nHe ceased stirring the soup and ladled some of it into a bowl which he passed to her.  “You haven’t eaten in nearly a day.  Eat.”\n\nShe took the bowl and ate a spoonful.  Cream of asparagus.\n\n“Let’s go back for a minute, why did your father murder the Daevites?”\n\n“I thought it was revenge at the time, but looking back, I think he didn’t see another option.  Here was a group of the humans he was trying to elevate, stuck in the mud and loving it, refusing to move an inch.  All the while, threatening the work he was doing.  I think he saw them as counter to everything he was working for.  He wasn’t what you call a sentimental creature.”\n\nHe took a sip of the soup from his own bowl.  \n\n“All these years later and she hates any vestige of His influence.

However, in the tradition there were four ethereal beings that the Daeva claimed were formed of the stuff of the universe yet had no form.  These were the closest thing to angels to the Daeva, which they called the Agents of Life, these entities were unknowable but their influence extruded into the physical realm on behalf of the Font.\n\nIt was not common practice for the Daevite matriarchs to pray but on occasion a matriarch would beseech one of these four Agents of Life.  This was considered an act of desperation, only to be taken if the lineage was at risk.  Apparently, the Daeva believed that to seek the favor of the Font’s emissaries required a sacrifice far beyond the usual bloodletting in their rituals.  During the many coexisting collapses of the Daevite civilization detailed in the Chronicle of the Daeva, this action was only noted as taking place once; such was the requisite cost of life that it was simply impractical.    \n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n--\n[[/=]]\n\nBased on prior involvement with SCP-7812-A, Judith Low found reference to SCP-7812 in the writings of a vanished Sarkic community with ties to Romania: \n[[div class=\"fancyborder\" style=\"background-image: url(https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/OLD%20PAPER); color: #000; font-size: 110%;\"]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n**__[[size larger]]Excerpt from the //Valkzaron//[[/size]]__**[[footnote]]Holy book of the Solomonari Sarkic people.[[/footnote]]\n@@ @@\n**//The heaving Devourer cast out in its fetid mindlessness//**\n**//For companions of equal hunger//**\n**//Four were crafted from the flesh of the newborn material realm//**\n@@ @@\n**//Mewling, formless things that served the Devourer//**\n**//Faceless eternal impotence and hunger//**\n**//Ever yearning to escape the turbulent darkness of The Outer Void//**\n**//and into the physical world created by Yaldabaoth//**\n@@ @@\n**//The Archons ache to consume the cosmos one world at a time//**\n**//Until their teeth have torn through final surviving world, \nand the Great Winnower is revenged upon its creation//**\n**//Which will return the universe to its birth state – without Light//**\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nExcerpt from //Detailing the Cosmology of the Ancient Sarkite// by Dr. Judith Low:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThe Grand Karcist taught that the Demiurge, Yaldabaoth or the Devourer, was mindless, without foresight or consciousness, and purely an instinctual creator/prophesized destroyer of the material universe.  But, despite its apparent ego-less existence, the Devourer apparently felt lonely, thus did it create four entities to serve as its pantheon.  \n\nThese were the Archons, four servants of the Demiurge and the actual builders of the physical universe on behalf of it.  These entities were not wholly of the universe – faceless and formless but with agency and consciousness of a sort.  According to ancient Sarkic myth, the Archons were the embodiment of primordial chaos, stretching into the material realm to sew the seeds of destruction.  This took the form of natural disasters in general, but in specific, the Archons were the engineers of the Six Ordeals of Ion – in an effort to defeat him before prior to his ascendancy.  \n\nIt is said that the Archons cannot reach into our universe, because they originate in the outer void, a kingdom of darkness where no life can persist.  It is the goal of each Archon to pierce the veil of the material realm and fully manifest so as to consume the world, even to a conceptual level.\n\nThis has a rather interesting wrinkle, in that one of the core tenets of the Sarkite faith is “To Shepherd the Flesh.”  According to Ion’s teachings, all life in the universe comes from a single progenitor, the Demiurge.  All life has a shared ancestry, venerated in the form of flesh crafting – labelled by the Foundation as carnomancy and by the Sarkite as “//Lihakut'ak//” – stemming from “//Weri//” or “The Old Blood.”\n\nWhich means, even the lowest Sarkic practitioner – no matter how pure – is descended metaphysically from Yaldabaoth.  Just like the Archons.  In the realm of Sarkite cosmology, mankind is the second cousin twice removed from the agents of the creator of the world, and they will be the death of everything.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #C7D5EC; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n\n“Who knows?

The outer wall rounded away from them, like the outer wall of a circular building.  But as strange as that was, the interesting thing was the bookshelves that lined every section of the walls.\n\n“A library.”\n\nEuboea nodded.  “A library, yes.  Depository, actually.”\n\n“Okay, so?”\n\n“Well, less ‘a library’ as much as ‘//the Library//’.”\n\nShe turned to look at him, her eyes narrowing.  \n\n“Wait, I thought we couldn’t…”\n\nAnother voice called from behind her.  “Foundation agents can’t enter the Library, that’s right.”\n\nRebekah turned towards the new voice and saw a very young woman in a black sport coat, black blouse, blue jeans and boots.  She brushed a stray lock of hair from her eyes and smiled.  “So, how can you be here, I wonder?”\n\n“Allison,” he said.\n\n“Euboea.  Lovely to see you again.”\n\n“Great, you two know each other.  Want to cue me in?” Rebekah asked.\n\n“My name is Allison Chao; you might know me better as the Black Queen.”\n\n“Doesn’t ring a bell, sorry.  Wait, you call yourself a queen?  What are you, 17?”\n\nThe Black Queen laughed and held open a door.  Rebekah and Euboea followed her out of the room and into a conference style room, with more bookshelves.\n\n“So, is this like the Library library? For real?”\n\n“We are in the Library.  Well… it’s a library in the Library, just to be confusing.  This depository is a place I like to store my collection, and I keep this open for the other members of the Serpent’s Hand.”\n\n“Oh great, so not only am I AWOL, but meeting with an agent of the enemy.”\n\n“Not so much an agent but leader, in a way.”\n\n“That makes it so much better.”\n\n“If you two are done with the flirting, could we get to business?” Euboea said.\n\nThe Black Queen snorted.  Rebekah grimaced and asked, “Why are we here?”\n\n“And how did you get her here?”\n\n“A Way in Munich.  And she’s no longer with the Foundation,” he answered.\n\n“I’m not?”\n\n“If you aren’t a wanted fugitive by now, you’re at the very least unemployed.”\n\n“There’s a Way directly to my depository?”\n\n“Yes, as it happens, I would be glad to show it to you if you could help us.”\n\n“Help with?”\n\nThe next hour involved Rebekah and Euboea explaining their complicated history and that of the Daevite return with the Matriarch.  At that point, the Black Queen’s cynicism bled away into surprise.  “A Daevite alive today? Not just some cultist with delusions of grandeur?”\n\n“Well, she’s hardly alive, but she’s animated and causing all sorts of hell up and down the continent. I’m surprised you haven’t heard anything,” Rebekah said.\n\n“I have heard of these events you’re mentioning, a few of them anyway.  But I did not think the appearance of an abandoned temple in Greece or the Foundation quarantining part of Târgoviște for a few hours had to do with the return of mythical horror stories.  Then again, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised.  We’ve been finding things left over from them for years.  And by we, I mean //you//.” The Black Queen stared at Rebekah.\n\n“Look, I get our two organizations have a lot of bad blood, but I’m just someone stuck in a bad situation that could blow up and fuck with the whole world.  Countless people have died already, even with the Foundation trying to limit her activities.  Imagine if she’s successful.  How long before a reborn Daevite empire comes knocking on the Hand’s door?”\n\nThe Black Queen sighed.  “What do you want?”\n\n“We need some way to find her, before she makes her next move,” Euboea said.\n\n“If even half the things you’ve told me are true, haven’t you been around for millennia?  Why do you need my help?”\n\n“I have never spent my time studying the way I should have.  Nuanced workings like finding someone are hard for me.

Why?”\n\n“I’d like to talk to Iona.”\n\n“That is a terrible idea.  You’re almost certainly a fugitive, like I said.  I left the camera you were wearing, I didn’t want them to track us.”\n\n“So?”\n\n“Director Varga has certainly seen the footage and will know that something is wrong.  Something anomalous, as you people put it.  That’s why I took you.  After seeing how well you were able to counteract her spell, and how the knife hurt her, I couldn’t let them lock you up for study.  And let’s face it, that is what would happen.”\n\n“They don’t just lock up anyone with abilities.  They hired me //for// my abilities.”\n\n“This isn’t psychic phenomena, Rebekah.  You’re possessed by an alien intelligence of astonishing strength.  You have control, but they won’t care.  Even if Varga is your friend as you think, she won’t have a choice.  Especially after I reneged on our deal.”\n\n“What’s it been, a day?  We could rush in there, explain things, she would understand.”\n\n“It’s been two weeks.”\n\nRebekah’s mouth opened to speak but nothing happened.  She just stared at him.\n\n“How could you not know that?” he asked.  \"You were recovering for more than ten days since Romania.  But you were conscious sometimes, and we even spoke.”\n\n“What the fuck are you talking about?” she yelled.\n\n“I don’t know what happened to you, but it’s interfering with your perceptions of reality.  Which only means we have less time than I thought.”\n\nShe slammed her palms against the table.\n\n“Two weeks…”\n\n“Yes, and I’ve been hiding you all that time.  A few days ago, there was a flurry of activity in England and since there’s been multiple teams flying out of Site-91.  They’re looking for something.”\n\n“How do you know that?”\n\n“My people.”\n\nRebekah sighed.  “I don’t think they’re looking for me.  That sounds like mobilization.

CC TV footage did not reveal any individuals matching the descriptions entering or exiting the Underground, thus it was theorized that the assailants represented a small group of homeless individuals living in the tunnels.  Cataloguing the location of the alleged assaults, the department was able to triangulate the most likely underground spaces these individuals were residing in – an abandoned tunnel leading to a decommissioned station.  It was decided to perform a raid at 01:00, launched from the St. Paul’s station,[[footnote]]The closest station to the theorized location of the “camp.”[[/footnote]] because the trains would not be running at this time.\n-----\n[[include component:image-block\n    name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/End%20of%20Hecatoncheires%20Abandoned%20Tunnel |\n    caption= Entrance to abandoned tunnel in London Underground.\n    |width: 300px\n]]\n\n**01:05**: Fifteen Metropolitan AFOs[[footnote]]Authorized firearms officers.[[/footnote]] gather on the platform of St. Paul’s Underground station.  The officers assist one another down from the platform and begin walking northeast along the tracks.\n\n**01:10**: The officers arrive at the entrance to the abandoned tunnel thought to house the assailants.  \n\n**01:11**: Several officers report howling noises coming from within the tunnel, but the group proceeds apace. \n\n**01:13**: Two individuals rush towards the officers screaming incoherently.  Despite attempts to calm these individuals down, they proceed to physically assault several of the officers.  One bites out the throat of an officer, tackling her to the ground.  Another breaks the arm of an officer with little effort and throwing him against the wall.  The other officers shoot and kill the two assailants.  Both are disheveled and dirty, seemingly having been living in these tunnels for months.  Asking for assistance from emergency medical services for the surviving victim officer, the police leave one of their number and move on.\n\n**01:15**: The police officers arrive at the decommissioned Underground station, seeing numerous bed mats and pieces of cardboard laid on the floor.  A shrill scream is raised in the station, followed by countless others.  \n\n**01:16**: Over three hundred disheveled individuals rush the police officers, who open fire.  \n\n**01:17**: Several dozen assailants fall to gun shots but many more quickly approach the officers.  Three police officers are dragged to the ground with dozens of hands striking at their armor and digging fingers into exposed flesh.  An officer’s eyes are pulled out by one of the assailants, who proceeds to eat the organs before being hit with several rounds from other officers.\n\n**01:19**: The ten remaining officers begin pulling back to the tunnel, pursued by the assailants.  Several officers reach the end of the tunnel and turn to cover their colleagues. At least a dozen assailants fall, but an additional officer is dragged down and torn apart by others.\n\n**01:20**: The remaining officers retreat past the entrance of the abandoned tunnel and the assailants stop following them.  The officers watch as five assailants proceed to tear and consume chunks of flesh from the officer who fell with their teeth and fingers. \n\n**01:24**: Nine surviving officers retreat to St. Paul’s station and report to their superiors.\n\n-----\n\n**Afterword**: Michael Howard[[footnote]]The Home Secretary of the United Kingdom[[/footnote]] reached out to Foundation representatives through backchannels and requested assistance.  MTF Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) were mobilized to the scene by 05:00 and the Underground line was shut down under a cover story of gas leak.  Zeta-9 personnel sealed the area populated with the individuals and flooded the tunnels with a light mixture of aerosolized valium before beginning the assault.  The assailants who were still alive (roughly two hundred and sixty) were stunned into unconsciousness and contained. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nIn the following days, the medical center at Site-91 was utilized to examine and treat the individuals recovered from the operation.  Subsequent to its discovery, connection was made to SCP-7812’s emergence in the noosphere through screening for cognitohazards and confirmed by use of Fehn cognitoscope scanning.  Thus, amnesticization was utilized to return those individuals to their conscious state before infection by what was termed Culebra-Simmons Syndrome.\n\nContinuing operations to identify and contain individuals affected by the syndrome are ongoing.\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #DAD9D9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n\n++++ ADDENDUM 7812.4: Analysis\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #EDEDED; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n[[=]]\n**__Summation of Threat Analysis Concerning SCP-7812__**\n//1 October, 1993//\n//Drs. Iona Varga & Judith Low//\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nHaving analyzed those individuals recovered from the London Underground and offered them treatment here at Site-91’s medical center, we have come to two conclusions.  \n\n1) This is not an isolated event or viral infection.  Numerous other reports have been found in medical and police records across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia – the earliest of which date to 1991.  For this reason I have retasked Site-91 forces to find and contain any and all individuals currently infected with the condition.  \n\n2) The infection has not occurred in a vacuum and is quite clearly anomalous.  Culebra-Simmons Syndrome is the side-effect of an ideatic invasion in the noösphere.  Provisionally classified as SCP-7812, this infection has taken root in the famis occulta, and is slowly expanding in size. There is every possibility that this alien concept, whether or not it is a sapient force, will subsume the human conceptual understanding of hunger and consumption, both abstract and practical.\n\nSCP-7812’s primary mode of expansion appears to correlate with the number of individuals currently affected by Culebra-Simmons, as minute reductions have been observed with successful treatment of those contained.  But we have reason to believe this infection has been in place for decades, far longer than cases of Culebra-Simmons have been observed.  Even if we are successful in containing each affected case of the Syndrome, there is no obvious likelihood of neutralization.  At best, projections show a reduction of conceptual size of the infection to approximately 10% of its current ideatic volume. Containment must therefore be focused on containment of affected individuals, while alternative plans are made for the direct containment of the infection point.\n\nGiven the research of the Department of History, SCP-7812 has been known to anomalous communities for millennia, with very different accounts from the Daevite and Sarkic traditions.  Given the mythological importance of this anomaly, we are unsure how to even begin a direct containment effort.\n\nAdditionally, at this time we do not have a working theoretical framework for the surgical excision of SCP-7812 from the noösphere.  Therefore, our new normal will have to factor in this alien presence in our conceptual ecosystem.  \n\nThe pattern of infection seems random unless an outside factor is considered.  A carrier. Someone or something moving around the world spreading the Syndrome.  All attempts must be made to identify and contain this vector, whatever it may be.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #C7D5EC; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n\n“Alright, how long is this going to take?”\n\n“As long as it takes, Agent,” the Black Queen said without taking her eyes off the dish.  \n\nThe three of them were seated around table with a shallow silver dish with flanged rim, filled with water.  When the water was poured, it was crystal clear, but as Chao whispered over it, the water had started to glow and clouded over. \n\nThat was over an hour before.  They had been staring at the swirling waters all that time.  Chao had assured them both that the enchantment on the mirror hated the Daeva, so it would find the one active member of that long dead dynasty if asked.  But as they rounded out to the ninety-minute mark, Rebekah just couldn’t anymore.\n\n“Isn’t there something else we can do here?”\n\nEuboea glanced sideways at her with a sigh.  “Rebekah…”\n\n“Look, we’re on a tight schedule here.  We need to see what she’s doing and get to her before another ritual is performed.  Or before Site-91 finds her first.”\n\n“Just be patient.”\n\nAnother few minutes passed, and Rebekah found herself pacing the room, glancing over the titles of esoteric books on shelves not recognizing anything.  She was about to turn back towards the table when a book’s title caught her eye: //Blood and the Thaumaturgic Ritual//.\n\n“What if we used a little blood?” she asked.\n\nThe Black Queen looked at her sharply.  “I don’t like using that sort of ritual.”\n\n“But this is looking for a Daeva, and they were obsessed with it.”\n\n“She’s got a point, Allison,” Euboea said.  “Also, she recently underwent the Matriarch’s touch, there might be a sympathetic conduit there.”\n\nThe young woman sighed, slipped a hand into her pocket and pulled out a small folding knife.  “Give me your hand, Agent.”\n\nRebekah hesitated but with both of them looking at her, she didn’t feel much choice.  Afterall, she had been the one to suggest it.  She placed her hand in the Black Queen’s, palm up.  The woman pressed the blade into her forefinger lightly, and held it so a drop or two fell into the water, speaking in what Rebekah believed was Aramaic.  Rebekah withdrew her hand quickly, applying pressure, but was distracted by the water in the dish.  The glowing cloudy water had shifted in tone to blood red, much more than would be expected from a few drops of her blood.\n\nThe swirling waters parted and there in the dish, she saw the Matriarch surrounded by her constructs in a very green but overcast scene.  \n\n“That’s outside Site-91!”\n\nSure enough, the Matriarch was leading her constructs towards the walled property containing the Foundation Research Site.  Even as she opened her mouth to ask another question, the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3140 | Daevite’s tree golems]]] opened fire on the walls surrounding the 18^^th^^ century manor.  No sound transmitted through the image but she could imagine the roaring explosions as the front gate to the manor was ripped from its hinges.\n\n“We need to get there.  Now.”\n\nThe Black Queen shook her head.  “I could get you to York, but you’d still be kilometers away.”\n\nEuboea stared at the images of Foundation forces attacking the Matriarch’s puppet army, hundreds of the constructs armed to the teeth and rushing through the ruined gates.  He saw Cynthia, one of his adepts working with Varga, throwing thaumaturgy at the wave of enemy forces before a stray round caught her in the throat and she spun backwards fountaining crimson.\n\n“I might be able to get us to the Site directly.”\n\n“I thought the whole place was warded,” the Black Queen said.\n\n“It is, which would usually be a problem.  But if I know our enemy, she’s heading right for the one thing that I could use to get us there quickly.”\n\n“What?” Rebekah asked.\n\n“My father’s body.”\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n++++ INCIDENT 7812.1: Discovery of SCP-7812\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #DAD9D9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #EDEDED; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n[[=]]\n**__Infiltration of Site-91 by Hostile Forces__**\n//5 October, 1993//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Beta777%20Logo.png width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n**MTF-Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) Personnel Present**:\n//Captain Rashid al Hasin//[[footnote]]Formerly of MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”), appended to MTF-Beta-777.

A priority alpha alert has been sent out to all Foundation Sites for any information concerning both individuals.  \n\nAfter the events of the log transcribed above, ███████ ███████ was designated as SCP-7812-A.  Connection was made when all present personnel developed early signs of Culebra-Simmons Syndrome and required light amnestic treatment.  Additionally, despite the usual ambient Akiva radiation present underneath Site-91 due to SCP-4612-A’s presence, sensors observed almost no radiation during ███████ ███████’s appearance.  Director Varga theorizes that ███████ ███████ was consuming the ambient radiation normally present in the crypt.  \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #C7D5EC; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n\nDirector Varga closed the file on SCP-7812 and pushed it away from her.  She leaned back behind her desk and crossed her arms over her chest.\n\n“Dammit, Rebekah.”\n\nHer desktop computer pinged, having received a secure message through SCiPNet. She turned the monitor on and keyed in her passcode.  Opening the message, she frowned.\n\n“How in the hell?”\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #EDEDED; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 5px; padding:5px; font-family: ‘Arial Rounded MT Bold’\"]]\n\n**To:** Iona Varga, PhD/MD – Director of Site-91\n**From:** Rebekah Douglas\n**Subject:** Thank you\n------\nHey Iona,\n\nI know you’re probably wondering how I managed to get a message to you.  Don’t worry about that, I called in some favors.  What is important is that I’m not coming back.\n\nI’m sure you have everyone out looking for me, but I had to reach out.  I’m sorry things played out this way.  I’m sorry you put yourself out on a limb and I let you down.  Hopefully, you’ll see that I did what I had to.  She needed to die.  Time and again she showed us how dangerous she was, it was only her arrogance that left her vulnerable.  We showed up the way we did because that was the only option left.\n\nBut this was to thank you.  You looked out for me and gave me a chance.  Even if I blew it, that still meant the world to me. And now, I’ve got something inside my head, and it won’t let go.  I know it’s something terrible and even if I had played by the rules, you’d still have to contain me.  And even though I’d love to give you the benefit of the doubt, I can’t.  You won’t hear from me again; I’m going underground for a while to figure it out.  \n\nAnyway… thanks.  I hope someday we can laugh about all this.  But I won’t be holding my breath.\n\nLove, \n\nRebekah\n[[/div]]\n\nVarga sighed and depressed the buzzer that connected to her assistant.  “Julie, will you come in here?”\n\nJulie came in carrying another stack of documents, which she placed at the front of the Director’s desk.  “After action reports on the incident.”\n\n“Great,” Varga said as she slid the documents closer.  “When you go back out, call down to the lab and have them prep the surgery.”\n\n“What’s up?”\n\n“I want to examine the Daevite myself.”\n\nJulie turned to go out and Varga called to her as she was about to close the door.\n\n“Any word from Captain al Hasin?”\n\n“Nothing positive.  They’re fairly sure she went into the Library but from there they don’t know where to start looking.”\n\nVarga nodded as Julie shut the door to her office.  She looked up at the screen and held the cursor over the forward button, intending to send the email to the Captain.  She stared for a moment and smiled, deleting the message instead.  \n\n“Stupid girl.”\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+++ THE END\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hecatoncheires-cycle-hub | Hecatoncheires Cycle]]]**\n[[size 80%]]**[[[scp-6520| << SCP-6520: Director's Eyes Only]]]** | **SCP-7812** [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** I look at eye level\n> **Author:** QThomas Bower\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/qthomasbower/3799770924/in/dateposted/ | Image Link]]]\n> **Note**: Edited by Grigori Karpin\n\n> **Filename:** CERN\n> **Author:** Olivier Bruchez\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bruchez/17702460756/ | Image Link]]]\n> **Note**: Edited by Grigori Karpin\n\n> **Filename**: vintage paper texture\n> **Author**: pinkorchid_too (Sandra)\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/artfullife/6030107724/ | Image link]]]\n\n> **Content**: Quotation/paraphrasing of some material from the Sarkicism Hub\n> **Author**: Metaphysician\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link**: [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub | Sarkicism Hub]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Abandoned tunnel\n> **Author:** Andrew Gray\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://flickr.com/photos/97534175@N00/10932935905/ | Image Link]]]\n\n> **Filename**: Site 91\n> **Author**: Karen Roe\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/karen_roe/8321761390/in/photolist-dFncJE-Fy4rtf-BcW1Bh-wk4EUt-DSnsUu-rkgRpD-A3NU6w-dFngxL-D1rgm6-cKnbaL-aCKyCx-D7Wz3p-cT1SiQ-uWGHsX-efpHwp-d1u7MG-fmjpZ1-nwPCCn-cKnFBS-qCouy3-dFncA7-cKnDQ3-c35HCj-dFncWL-cKmTh9-cKncrS-cKnbRL-aCKyw8-cKmUaA-aCNfLf-ri5o8J-bZK3Jj-kS8XKg-QkS5u9-eF5V2R-dFgMvz-7oocmY-eFcdJU-eizmwE-den4Mu-cT1M7u-cSZM3m-cZ3t5m-9khwzs-dehv8Z-fi4LkL-eYVZsv-den53C-qjEKaa-cZJqF3 | link]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
