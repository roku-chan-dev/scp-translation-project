As of July 21, 2020, these measures have been deemed insufficient due to GoI-233's anomalous mode of travel. As such, predictive analytics have been added to ΛΞ-207.\n\nNone of the three instances of SCP-5335 are currently in containment. In the event that one or more of the SCP-5335 instances are contained, these procedures should be updated to include the contained instances' archived containment procedures. \n-----\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Description**__\n[[/div]]\nSCP-5335 collectively refers to three genetically, although not physically, identical humanoids that all identify themselves as some variation of \"Agent McNeal\", formerly an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub FBI: Unusual Incidents Unit] operative.\n\nThis report contains all relevant data gleaned from the FBI:UIU case file, as well as additional data gathered in the ongoing attempt to apprehend SCP-5335. Due to the sensitive nature of this case & the potential for continued security breaches on the part of SCP-5335-1, -2, & -3, apprehension of all three  iterations have been given a high priority. MTF Pi-6 (\"Clown Wranglers\") has been assigned to the ongoing investigation primarily for their expertise in encountering and capturing bozomorphic-class entities. \n\nSCP-5335 was originally a decorated Special Agent of the FBI. According to the FBI:UIU personnel file for Special Agent McNeal, the subject in question was initially described as slight, dark-complexioned, and of indeterminate gender.[[footnote]] This statement is believed to have been a product of a lack of understanding and acceptance regarding individuals of non-standard gender identities. Based on information gained from several secondary sources, it is believed that Agent McNeal was genderfluid, according to testimony obtained from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2094 SCP-2094], the gender and sexual identities of SCP-5335-2, and -3 is variable between instances.[[/footnote]] \n\n[[include component:image-block name=McNealCouple|caption=Recovered Photograph, SCP-5335-2 & -3, c. unknown |width=300px]]\n\nSCP-5335-1 appears to generally fit this description, but they have successfully evaded capture since they were first apprehended by the FBI:UIU on January 23, 1935. It is unknown if SCP-5335-1 shares the abilities of SCP-5335-2 and -3 beyond biological immortality. SCP-5335-2 and -3 have both exhibited the ability to radically alter their physical form and identity via complete cellular regeneration to take on the appearance of a variety of baseline humans. This process does not appear to be under their control, as it only triggers upon the \"death\" of the current instance. \n\nThis massive cellular regeneration produces a fully-grown adult human and appears to select physical characteristics at random. The only constant has been that the entities have been reported to retain a high degree of physical aptitude, and their memories, personalities, and abilities appear unaffected.\n\nThe current appearance of all three of the SCP-5335 iterations is unknown.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n+++ **Attached Addenda**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Discovery**\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-5335 was originally brought to researchers' attention during an ongoing mutual exchange of files between the Foundation and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub the FBI:Unusual Incidents Unit], which began in 2001.[[footnote]]To date, this file exchange has provided an unknown number of documents scattered across 538 standard-sized file cabinets with no clear system of organization.[[/footnote]]\n\nInitially created to investigate the activities of GoI-233 “[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/herman-fuller-hub Herman Fuller’s Circus of the Disquieting]”, the FBI:UIU's case designation was modified to include a kidnapping charge after Special Agent McNeal was captured by GoI-233 operatives. This was subsequently updated again once it became known that SCP-5335 had begun to actively collaborate with GoI-233. \n\nSince jurisdiction over SCP-5335 was passed to the Foundation, MTF Pi-6 (\"Clown Wranglers\") have engaged repeatedly with SCP-5335 with limited success. \n\nIn March of 2012, Pi-6 agents were able to apprehend SCP-5335-2, and it was transferred to a standard humanoid containment cell at Site-81. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-5335-2 Initial Interview, 5335.int.01\" hide=\"- Hide Transcript\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Initial Subject Interview Transcript**\n\n**Date:** March 13, 2012\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5335-2 \"Mick\"\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Imogene Stewart\n\n**Foreword:** Subject has been polite and cooperative, and appears to accept containment.

Or Agent McNeal, if you're the formal type. \n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Why? You're no longer an FBI:UIU Agent, I think you've made that clear. \n\n**SCP-5335-2:** I find that most labels, titles and names are arbitrary. I think it sounds good.\n\n//[SCP-5335-2 leans slightly towards Dr. Stewart.]//\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** Hey, listen, if you ever do get Spook, please don't tell him I said that first part.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** I'll, uh, keep that in mind.\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** //[nodding]// That is all I ask.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** So, Mick.

A small correction, though; we aren't exactly //separate//.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** I see. While that may be the case, I am asking you.\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** Okay. Fuller did his weird Nalka magic on us one we were still together, And now there are three of us. Mick, Mack, and the Spook. \n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Can you be more specific about those statements? \n\n**SCP-5335-2:** It's almost lunchtime, Doctor. I don't want to ruin my appetite, or yours.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** What caused your feud with the Unusual Incidents Unit?\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** If you're going to tell me not to bullshit you, you shouldn't do it yourself, Doctor. We know you have the files.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Humor me. \n\n**SCP-5335-2:** If it took our former colleagues any time to decide we were beyond saving, none of us could tell.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Is that why you joined the Circus?\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** //[smiling]// Honey, who doesn't want to run away and join the Circus from time to time? It's the Greatest Show in All the Worlds!\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Okay, I get the message. We will reconvene in a few days to discuss your history with the Circus.\n\n**SCP-5335-2:** I don't reckon we will.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** Interview was terminated shortly after the subject's final statement, which it never elaborated upon. Security around SCP-5335-2's containment cell has been tightened as a result.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nShortly after the initial interview, Site-81 experienced a highly localized series of security system failures, and SCP-5335-2 was able to breach containment with the assistance of -1 and -3. To date, the twelve days that the Foundation had custody of SCP-5335-2 represents the longest period that the Foundation has been able to contain any of the SCP-5335 instances.\n\n----\nWhile much of SCP-5335's history prior to their joining GoI-233 has been stricken from the record, the Foundation was able to locate the single living person that could possibly shed some light onto who Agent McNeal was when they were actively an FBI:UIU agent. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Agent Hooper Initial Interview\" hide=\"- Hide Transcript\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Retired FBI:UIU Agent Jackson Hooper\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Imogene Stewart \n**Foreword:** UIU Agent Jackson Hooper was the only surviving UIU Agent to have worked directly with the original SCP-5335 instance.

See, McNeal had this way with folk, could get them to talk like he was some sort of shrink. So we was goin' in to see what we could find. I was with Tommy Meyer, I think. We worked together a good couple times, me and Tommy, watched each other's backs and all- \n\n**Dr. Stewart:** Agent Hooper, please. \n\n**Agent Hooper:** All right, all right! Jesus, woman. Tommy and me, we got ourselves lost in some mirrors, that's what we did. S'hard to find the way out when everythin's just our faces starin' back at us. Most of the fun shit happened while we was lost, and us two got out just as McNeal was callin' for extraction. We was tryin' to meet up behind the Big Top, but things were going to shit. Those Clowns kept poppin' up from everywhere, hell, they was the weirdest things, when they were comin' after us like that. I think two agents went down, 'cause Meyer was bleedin' like a pig when we all got out.\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** How did you manage to escape?\n\n**Agent Hooper:** McNeal. Fuckin' queer managed to steer the Clowns the other way, shit was the damndest thing. I think that he was dancin' or some shit? That point, Draper grabbed us all and we got out. I never saw McNeal after that. Heard he turnt traitor. Spent a while lookin' for sonofabitch, at least 'til I got myself reassigned. I think Draper stayed on a bit?\n\n**Dr. Stewart:** I see. Thank you, Agent Hooper. That'll be all. \n\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** It's clear that McNeal wasn't well-liked, even if they were respected by the people working for them. We attempted to locate any relatives of Agent C. Draper, but he had no children or siblings when he was transferred to the Office of Strategic Services. OSS records indicate that he was lost in action in France in 1944, and his parents died a few months apart in 1946.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Additional Documents**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ FBI:UIU Case File\" hide=\"- Hide Case File\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/unusual-incidents-unit-hub/logo-color.png]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[Tab Initial Report]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]] **FBI:UIU File 1932-013:** Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**Command:** Section Chief ████████\n**Operational Lead:** --Special Agent McNeal-- --Special Agent Thompkins-- --Special Agent Hobart-- --Special Agent Myers-- --Special Agent Ryan-- --Special Agent Gordon-- --Special Agent Rodriguez-- --Special Agent Danner-- --Special Agent Hoyer-- --Special Agent Webb--\n\n**Summary:** \nThe Circus is an anomalous group that is known to be operating throughout the entirety of the United States. Confirmed reports have placed the Circus in Chicago, IL, San Francisco, CA, Sacramento, CA, Madison, WI, Sarasota, FL, Allentown, PA, and many other cities all across the country. Numerous accounts of injuries sustained while visiting the Circus, along with multiple deaths and disappearances attributed to Circus activities show that it represents a serious and present danger to the Citizenry of the United States and all appropriate efforts should be put forth to protect the United States and her citizens from this threat.\n\nWhile it is currently unknown how many people are employed by the Circus, due to the nature of their rapid deployment and movement about the country, it is safe to assume that they can call upon vast material and personnel resources. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Suspects]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n**AS OF 01/23/36, Former Special Agent McNeal is also to be considered a suspect.**\n\n**Name:** \"McNeal\", \"Spook\"\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human(?), Minor Type Green Reality Bender, Cognitohazard, Memetic \n\n**Physical Description:**\n||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||\n|| Unknown || 5'11 || 207lbs/Muscular || Unknown || Brown || Brown || \n\n||~ Identifying Attributes ||\n|| Wears attire no less formal than business casual at all times. Always carries a navy blue pocket square embroidered with the letters S.M in the top right corner, along with a similar handkerchief capable of neutralizing the memetic effects of their byproduct and removing stains via anomalous means. ||\n\n**Capabilities:** The full extent of the suspect's abilities is currently unknown. \n\nThe suspect secretes a clear fluid that has strong hallucinogenic and memetic properties. Direct skin contact with the suspect should be avoided at all costs. The substance causes a Class III memetic effect in observers, which has the effect of rendering any living organism it's applied to virtually invisible. This is accomplished by triggering \"the background effect\" in the viewer's primary visual cortex, which signals to the brain that the viewed \"object\" is completely normal and part of the expected \"background\".\n\nAdditionally, if the substance is mixed with oils present on human skin, it can cause powerful visual hallucinations. There have been reports that the suspect is capable of manipulating these hallucinations, however, these reports are entirely circumstantial. The suspect may also be a minor Type Green.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Though it is believed that the suspect was originally intended to act as a bodyguard or enforcer for Herman Fuller, their role appears to have grown. The suspect also claims they defected from the FBI:UIU as the employees of the Circus “Have been quite cordial to us, especially compared to you lot.”  \n\n**Modus Operandi:** The suspect is calm and methodical in their actions, and appears to have been responsible for planning the majority of the break-ins at UIU properties. The suspect is also capable of easily infiltrating UIU assets and facilities due to the memetic nature of its byproduct. Agents should beware of unfamiliar individuals claiming to be a part of their assigned Action Team.\n\n**Behavior:** The suspect is detail-focused to the point of mania. They are often described by captured Circus employees with some variation on the statement; \"The most unbelievably anal-retentive person I have ever met,\" though they are still generally liked. Suspect \"Mack\" stated in an interview that \"That fucker could carry a stick in their ass through a marathon, but they can count the shit outta some cards, lemme tell ya.\"\n\n----\n**Name:** \"Agent McNeal\", \"Mick\"\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human(?), Kinetohazard Production, Shape-shifting\n\n**Physical Description:**\n\n||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||\n|| Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies || \n\n||~ Identifying Attributes ||\n|| Smokes cigars often, sometimes cigarettes. Wears a 1920s era FBI:UIU badge at all times. Generally dresses in business casual. ||\n\n**Capabilities:** The suspect has proven themselves capable of creating kinetohazards by performing dances of a kinetoglyphic nature. The suspect has also shown an anomalous resistance to injury and death, as well as a tendency to grow new bodies after sustaining \"mortal\" injury. This process is not believed to be voluntary or under the suspect’s control.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Though it is believed that the suspect was originally intended to act as a bodyguard or enforcer for Herman Fuller, their role appears to have grown. The suspect also claims they defected from the FBI:UIU as the employees of the Circus \"Have been much kinder and more accepting than you were, though that is an admittedly low bar.\"  \n\n**Modus Operandi:** The suspect rarely travels without the Circus, and thus it is safe to assume that if the Circus is located, the suspect will also be present. The suspect appears to be in jointly in charge of defending the Circus from intruders such as unruly customers and agents of the FBI:UIU. They are known to use their kinetohazardous capabilities to evade and attack FBI:UIU personnel. Special caution should be used when attempting to apprehend this suspect, as they have extensive knowledge of FBI:UIU tactics and procedures. \n\n**Behavior:** The suspect is quieter than their counterparts, apparently preferring to take more subtle approaches to problems that complement the other suspect's capabilities. \n\n----\n**Name:** \"McNeal\", \"Mack\"\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Human(?), Distortion of Local Physics, Shape-shifting \n\n**Physical Description:**\n\n||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||\n|| Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies || Varies ||\n\n||~ Identifying Attributes ||\n|| Often speaks with an unusually deep voice. Dresses casually and/or scantily. ||\n\n**Capabilities:** Suspect is significantly stronger than baseline //homo sapiens sapiens//, which poses additional difficulties in maintaining custody. Suspect shows an extremely high resistance to the standard array of sedatives and tranquilizers. It is also exceptionally resistant to most forms of impact damage. \n\nCurrently, an electroshock discharge with a minimum of 8 kV and a current intensity output of 750 mA administered for a minimum of 4 seconds is the only known way to incapacitate the suspect.\n\nThis suspect is capable of distorting local geometry and physics in order to perform near-impossible feats of acrobatics with minimal effort. They have also shown a tendency to grow new bodies upon infliction of otherwise \"mortal\" injury. This process is not believed to be voluntary or under the suspect’s control.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Though it is believed that the suspect was originally intended to act as a bodyguard or enforcer for Herman Fuller, their role appears to have grown. The suspect also claims they defected from the FBI:UIU as the employees of the Circus \"Ain't dicks for the most part.\"\n\n**Modus Operandi:** The suspect rarely travels without the Circus, and thus it is safe to assume that if the Circus is located, the suspect will also be present. The suspect appears to be in jointly in charge of defending the Circus from intruders such as unruly customers and the FBI:UIU. They are known to use their ontological capabilities to evade and attack FBI:UIU personnel. Special caution should be used when attempting to apprehend this suspect, as they have extensive knowledge of FBI:UIU tactics and procedures. \n\n**Behavior:** The suspect is reported to be “A loud and enjoyably unruly” individual, with a crass sense of humor and high libido, regardless of the suspect’s gender. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Evidence]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:carousel\n| images=page01,page02,page03,page04,page05,page06,page07,page08,page09,page10,page11\n| caption=File selections\n| interval=5\n| wiki=scp-wiki\n| page=scp-5335\n| width=100%\n| height=700px\n| position=right\n| no-caption=false\n| background=white\n| options=yes\n]]\n[[/=]]\n##white|_##\n@@ @@ \n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Bureau Record]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n\n||~ Date ||~ Action ||\n|| 02/11/1935 || Bureau Record initiated, Sector Chief & Special Agent Assigned ||\n|| - || Chief ████████, Special Agent McNeal ||\n|| 02/28/1935 || Reports of unusual activity collated and recorded in file.

Said they'd just be there for the one night, and I know'd you wanted someone to tell yas about it, so I went.\n\nSuper weird show, but nothin' that usually gets you spooks all uppity. What, you gonna start raiding kiddie parties to get out the balloon clowns? \n\nAnyways, mostly just your run of the mill circus stuff. Cotton candy, animal show, sideshow freak tent, funhouse, weird mirror house, big top show. The cotton candy vendor is right there at the front, and the shit was free with admission, so I got myself some. Tasted pretty fuckin' great, so I ain't even mad yous don't reimburse for that kinda shit.\n\nSo, I ate my candy and went to see the animals. Some funny looking things too. Tiger that causes dead shit to float. Dancing bear. These weird mole things in a big glass cage. Dug tunnels that spellt out words n' shit. \"TRAPPED\" \"SLAVES\" \"HELP\". Real fuckin' riot, like we was sposed to believe 'em or somethin.\n\nAfter that I went to the funhouse, who aint lovin' a funhouse, right? Anyway, played in the ballpit with some kids and a few adults. Big ball pit, lots of ladders n' shit. Could jump off this diving board into the deep end. Never knew'd yous could swim in a ballpit, 'guess I ain't never been in one so big before. fuckin' great shit. \n\nOnly caught the last part of the Big Top show. Some spooky guy named --Malawhatsit-- --Melodrofuckit--, eh, some dude with a lot of letters in his name. He floated in the middle of the room and show'd some poor shit's memories or somethin'. Couldn't hardly understand the guy, he was mumblin' in some weird --languiog--. Shit, he talked funny. Didn't know'd what he said. \n\nThen I went home. \n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab 08/12 After Action Report]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ __**After Action Report**__\n[[/=]]\n**Team Lead:** Agent C.

McNeal sacrificed to save our asses. I don't care what you guys have said about McNeal in the past, but that's a damn fine Agent.

When contact was made, \"McNeal\" became agitated and uncooperative, breaking free of the asset. Asset then attempted to truncheon McNeal, and the agent evaded it with ease. Agent McNeal now referred to as \"Target A\"\n\nTarget A shrugged off all attempts at apprehension, and proceeded to attack Action Team Alpha and NYPD assets. Agent Draper attempted to intervene, and this caused Target A to pause long enough for several NYPD assets to fire their service weapons. Target A fell to the ground and was attempting to rise when suspects The Man With The Upside Down Face[[footnote]]The report appears to refer to this one as \"Manny\" after this point. - Dr. Stewart [[/footnote]] and Fuller arrived on the scene. \n\nSuspect Manny began yelling at Fuller to \"clean up his goddamned mess before I do\", and Fuller pulled a long black cane from beneath his tuxedo jacket. At this point, suspect Manny turned to the Alpha Team and the SWAT assets, and both dropped their firearms. \n\nSuspect Fuller finished whatever he was doing to Target A, then somehow \"pulled\" Target B, an apparent copy of Target A, from Target A's back. Suspects Manny and Fuller began arguing again, and suspect Fuller struck Target B with the cane, causing them to split into two identical copies. He then told suspect Manny to \"deal with it\", and dashed behind the tents. \n\nThe Alpha Team and the NYPD assets were then forced unconscious, and when they were recovered several hours later, the fairgrounds were empty, with only minimal detritus remaining to indicate the Circus had been there.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab 03/10 After Action Report]]\n= //Electronic copy below as per Federal Records Act//\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone\" style=\"padding: 0 1em; font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ __**After Action Report**__\n[[/=]]\n**Team Lead:** Special Agent Thompkins\n**Date:** 03/10/1936\n**Narrative:**\n----\n[This report was received by the Foundation heavily redacted.

A good run, I started learning my dances in that one. \n@@ @@\nFuller had captured me 'cause I stayed behind to let the other Agents escape, unbelievable, I know, but I was a different man. Fuller wasn't, unfortunately. We're still not sure how he managed to do what he did. \n@@ @@\nAt first, he just introduced invasive personality traits to my mind, which was //highly// unpleasant. Manny never likes to go into what he did for us too much, it makes him uncomfortable, bless him. All he'll ever say about it is that he'd got sick of Fuller turning his(Manny's) circus into a hunting ground for his(Fuller's) sick experiments.\n@@ @@\nWhen Manny went in to confront him, Fuller most likely got all blustery, \"Do you know what I am?\", y'know, the typical spiel. But I didn't see that. At that moment, my mind was in the most thorough, intense pain, mental and physical, that I'd ever been in. \n@@ @@\nBut suddenly, it went away. I looked around, I was strapped to a table, and I looked over and saw the biggest man I'd ever seen standing next to the POS who'd be experimenting on me. That Man-With-An-Upside-Down-Face drew himself up, looked Fuller square in his beady eyes, and said: \"Yes, Herman Fuller, I know what you are.\" \n@@ @@\nThen he crouched a bit to get eye level with Fuller, and finished with; \"But you know what I am too. Let's not do this today, hm?\" It wasn't until a long time after that I realized I'd never seen Manny's mouth open. He was pushing so hard against Fuller's mind that I and half the damn Circus heard him. That was when things really started getting tense between the two, or so I hear. I've only ever seen them in their constant Mexican standoff, heh.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Attached Letter:**\n[[include component:image-block name=badcopwheel.jpg|caption=Earliest known image of SCP-5335-3.

It's weird knowin' that we was once the same damn person. I guess I got the lucky draw, 'cause I got all the mean shit that was inside of us. Squigly and Poodles took to callin' me \"Mack\", which is a great fucking name. Now, it's technically from our given name, but hey, it fits me good! \n@@ @@\nWe may not have got along so great in those years, it really got pretty //acrimonial// there in fact! I dunno what that means though, that's just what Spook always says. But in the end, I guess it didn't matter none. Together Mick, Spook and I make a helluva team! We stopped the J Edgars cold when they tried to come and 'nick us. I guess we probably should've gone with them, but we was both done with how they treated us back home.

So much for the years I spent working for them, helping to keep America safe from the shit goes bump in the night. Being called a faggot and a queer every day made that tough, but I --knew-- thought what I was doing mattered. And I had been having doubts too, if you'd believe it. I looked Thompkins in the eyes as I put my hands behind my head, told him I surrendered, and felt his bullets rip through my chest. I guess those doubts leaked out with the blood, 'cause I ain't had none since.\n@@ @@\nI just responded to Thompkins' cowardice by coughing up blood and hollering Cajun profanities at him. My dear Grandad taught me those, bless him. That old swamper and his wife were and are some of the only folks to accept us, both times, and the only ones who'd raise us. I can't remember all of what I said, but I do recall saying \"Vous bâtard jaune, pic kee toi.\" He just laughed and tried to call me a faggot one last time, but he got cut off before he could finish gloating. Mack threw him into a tent pole and told him \"Tuat t'en grosse bueche.\" \"You have a big mouth\". That was when we really started getting along better. \n@@ @@\nAnyway, I didn't stay dead. At all. Fuller says it has something to do with the carnomancy merde he did. The old fuck was all kinds of giddy when I pulled free of my old skin like some sort of weird lizard. He wanted to examine me in his trailer, but Manny wouldn't let him. Said that we should just all be grateful that Mack and I were willing to stick around and help out keeping the Family safe. \n@@ @@\nMack, Spook, and I sat down and had a long talk about it, and we decided that we need to do more. This Circus is some of the only family we've got left now, excepting La Rue.

Whatever that means, I don't really care about findin' out. Livin' with 'em these last years has been fun, I ain't gonna lie about that, but they're still a weird bunch of folks. Manny assures us that we don't need to worry about them, but... hell, it don't matter. Squigly and Poodles are definitely fine by me, those two merdes know how to have real fun! They took us dancin' the other night, too. I didn't know those freaky bâtards could make 'emselves look like people, it's freaky as hell, but I guess we are too, eh? Watching 'em shift and change like that, I ain't wonder where Fuller got his trick at changing us any more. \n@@ @@\nDancing is fun. We'll probably incorporate it into the tricks we pull.

I don't know why those bastards didn't do anything to prevent the fucking war, but they've got a lot more pull than the J Edgars ever did. I guess it's a good thing they don't work for the Feds.

Mick and I have agreed we need to get in there and learn what we can.\n@@ @@\nIt took us a bit to gain access, but some of their Sites have some real poor security.

Edgars trying to raid every other performance, we were dying a lot. But with things starting to calm down, I'm trying to get the old tradition going again, and Mack and Spook have agreed. Things are different now. It's harder and harder to keep the Essies from coming at us full bore. So far we've been able to divert their primary attention away from us, but Fuller's insanity is getting a lot worse. We've had to ditch and run more than a few times when whatever madness he wants to throw out there gets loose. We've hurt a lot of innocent folks, and it's just going to get worse. \n@@ @@\nCahaya and Fraust are with us. That brought Squigly and Poodles as well, which doesn't count for nothing. Now we just gotta get Icky to get on board. Manny's been itching to get Fuller off our backs for years, same with the rest of the Freaks. Couldn't do anything as long as Fuller had the respect of the Clowns.\n@@ @@\nWe don't think he'll have that for much longer. \n[[/div]]\n\n**Attached Letter:**\n[[include component:image-block name=mickandspook|align=left|caption=The only known picture of -1 outside of confinement.

After all, without Fuller, it is still the Greatest Show in All the Worlds, with the added benefit of Herman Fuller's non-presence. It's also been good not being required to organize a full-scale defense of the Circus every other month. It's been so calm, the other day we went out for the first time in years. \n@@ @@\nUnfortunately, however, swing and jazz have more or less lost their former places in popular music. So, we simply set up our own club with Fuller's old tent, the one he did his \"experiments\" in. Mick dug up his old records, and we threw a party, invited over anyone who wanted to come get drunk, learn the Charleston, and dance on Fuller's grave. The tent couldn't hold everyone who came, so we took it down. Mack, Mick and I, as well as Manny, Squigly, and Poodles, (the latter two of which actually took us out dancing for the first time) kept ourselves quite busy teaching everyone how it's done. Although I would never think of saying this to them, I very much enjoyed it. \n@@ @@\nThat might have been Mack's hooch, however. The stuff could get a horse drunk with no more than a shot, and I had five. \n@@ @@\nBack to seriousness, it's almost a shame, really. Herman Fuller created us to protect him. To keep him in his palace atop the hill. How was he to know that he'd get lagniappe?\n@@ @@\nNow, it really is on us to keep the Family from harm, and that doesn't just mean from Fuller. The J Edgars, the Traitors, the Essie P. All of them. We will stand against them, in the shadows or in the light. We don't know why we're this way or how Herman Fuller did it, but in the end, I'm glad we are like we are, because then we wouldn't have found --the-- our Family.
