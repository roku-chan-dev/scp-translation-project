I’m bigslothonmyface. I usually go by Sloth. I started writing here in 2021 after reading the site for almost a decade. Though it’s not a hard-and-fast rule, I try to write pieces that leverage the SCP format to comment on social justice, especially environmental issues and marginalized communities. IRL, I’m an MFA-trained nonfiction writer, teacher and journalist. \n\nThanks for reading! I’m flattered to work among so many talented artists.\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab My work]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6002\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: All Creatures Great And Small**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //7th place, SCP-6000 Contest//\nA tree with the DNA of every living thing in its branches, and the woman trying to save it.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nI spent over a month devising, revising and polishing this piece, my first (and still favorite) for the wiki, and my entry for the 6K contest.\n\nIn my original drafts, I learned harder into eugenics: Muller killed 10 percent of the human population overnight by ill-advisedly editing the Tree, and Rose free climbed up it for three hours to fight him off herself. I ultimately decided that a coverup was a more accurate depiction of how a powerful coward would act, and allowed me to explore my characters in greater depth—but rest assured that Rose is a certified badass and absolutely destroyed the old bastard in their fight.\n\nThe Aeterns are meant to encapsulate many different fictional creatures, and give backstory for a range of myth. I will, however, admit to a mild Pokémon inspiration. I’m a lifelong fan.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7002\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: The Hungry Season**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //13th place, SCP-7000 Contest//\nRogue comet C/2022 I1 compels humanity to make a wish.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nThis 7K entry was written in three days, but that doesn't mean I spent only three days working on the contest. I drafted another story for nearly a full month, but abandoned it when I realized it wasn't working. It was the right choice for me but it left me with little time to perfect the next attempt.\n\nWhich is all to say that I'm not entirely thrilled with this piece, a metaphor for western exploitation of the global south in the mode of some shorter, hard-scifi skips I admire. There are parts I love (I think I nailed the rising action, and I like how I handled the logs leading up the climax) and parts I hate (the abruptness of the ending). I'm thankful that I at least avoided embarrassing myself, and thankful-er still that I lucked into an X002-slot repeat!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8002\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: Maslov's Fire**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //7th place, SCP-8000 Contest//\nThe SCP Foundation's main hospital, on the verge of collapse.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nMy own medical trauma and healthcare stress intermingled with the 8k contest's \"fantasy\" theme to create this work, which consumed me and spat me back out from the moment the contest was announced until the moment it began. In addition to that official theme, I gave myself a second, secret theme for the contest: \"healing.\" It narrowed my focus and kept me thinking about change over time, which were both helpful. \n\nThis was also the most character-focused work I'd ever tried. Dr. Maslov started as a side note to the main goal of my work, but soon became the focus, leading me along as I learned more about her and the rest of the case. I tried to plan what would happen, but found that I worked best by beginning scenes with her and letting them go, with dialogue emerging as I wrote rather than sticking to a rigid structure. It was a satisfying way to create, and one I will certainly use again.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6250\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: Keystone Flats**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%%\nA poisonous city spilling out from our minds and into reality.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nTook me about three weeks to write from start to finish. I envisioned this as a story about urban sprawl, in the form of a suburb that never stopped expanding. Acting on that was a challenge, and I feel the final product falls a little short of what I hoped for. Still, urban sprawl makes for a good, but challenging, memetic skip: a series of interconnected, wasteful practices that collectively redefine physical space. I hope nobody was weirded out by me driving around their cul-de-sacs with my camera sourcing images!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6622\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: Beaver Power**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //Front page feature, March 2022//\nHydroelectric beavers who love you.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nA feel-good article born from a pun, and one I decided I wanted to be short. For all that, I worked on it for a week, and most of that time was spent omitting needless words. I streamlined the conprocs and description dozens of times, saving maybe a word or two each time, until I was happy with my rhythm.\n\nMy favorite headcanon about this piece is that the beavers are using cold fusion to generate the power. I nearly acted on [[*user psychicprogrammer]]’s suggestion that the dams emit neutrinos to suggest that. So, if you’re wondering: beaver fusion. That’s how it works.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6502\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: Harwick Cemetery**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //Winner, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nightmarefest SCPD Nightmare Fest] \"Graveyard Shift\" category//\nAn undying eternity buried alive.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nMy (winning) entry for the 2021 SCPD Nightmarefest contest.

I was also thrilled to finally write a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6630/offset/1 Fire Suppression Department] skip. The FSD capitalizes on bureaucratic horror and labor exploitation for some of the most twisted articles on the wiki, and it lines up perfectly with the kind of horror-commentary I want to work on. Taking a stab at it, and doing so for a project with some of my all-time idol authors as co-contributors, makes this piece a memorable one for me!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8430\"]]\n**%%title_linked%%: Prosophobia: Fulfillment**\nCreated on %%created_at%% | Score: %%rating%% | //Written for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-anthology-2024 ANTHOLOGY 2024], day 11//\nAn anomalously-efficient manufacturing center proves difficult to contain.\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Show commentary\" hide=\"▲ Hide\"]]\nThanks to [[*user S D Locke]] for inviting me back for another round of Anthology! Regulatory capture and artificial intelligence coalesced for me in this piece, which took about a week to produce from concept to completion. I enjoyed trying out an exploration log for a sinister location—one of my favorite inclusions in any skip, but never something I'd written before this. I'd say I did passably on this one, but it ended up being slower than I'd have liked.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Recommended reads]]\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThese are articles I deeply admire by other SCP authors. Many of them have had an impact on my own style, and all have stuck with me for years. Bravo!\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2003 SCP-2003 — Preferred Option], by [[*user Kalinin]]**\nMy favorite SCP??? Maybe. From the conceit of a preferred timeline and how random events bring it about, to the twist use of BigDog, to the wild and often-prophetic alternative sets for our future… This is a piece that rewards you for clicking on its collapsibles. Its scope, structure and portrayal of the Foundation have all had a lasting impact on my work.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5001 SCP-5001 — Sacrosanct], by [[*user Yossipossi]]**\nThe other contender for my favorite SCP. Apparently I just love weird, bigass tech working in unexpected ways! The timeline of the breach is the strength of this piece: it builds tension so effectively and doesn’t waste words. A major inspiration for me as I try to write logs of my own.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1342 SCP-1342 — To The Makers of Music], by [[*user FlameShirt]]**\nThis is a science-y skip that ends on a note written outside of the Foundationspeak voice and which is utterly heart-wrenching. I blatantly rip this off for the commentary (especially the ending note) in SCP-6002.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6355 SCP-6355 — A Choking Grip upon the Neck of Propriety], by [[*user UraniumEmpire]] and [[*user T Rutherford]]**\nThe very definition of socially-conscious horror. You will be worked to death and nobody can save you. The Fire Suppression Department is a transformative canon for the wiki, and this article is the best of them.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1555 SCP-1555 — The Facility], by [[*user atomicthumbs]]**\nSingle-handedly cemented weird industrial locations as the scariest type of skip for me. Also my go-to example of something incomprehensibly strange. I borrowed from its suddenly-shifting randomness for SCP-6250, and I hope to do so again. Losing its images did irreparable harm and I hope they find their way back some day.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard 43], by [[*user HarryBlank]] and many others**\nIf I had to pick a canon that best exemplifies “the Foundation but if it was real,” OG43 would be my choice. Harry's Canadian dug-out adds a much-needed element of relatable humanity back into a universe that often lacks it, and pushes the site to confront questions about justice, society and identity that go beyond its usual collection-of-curiosities vibe. Site-43 treats anomalies with fear and care, but also with respect; its characters are bored, curious and political just as much as they are cold geniuses; and it manages all of this without losing that classic SCP grounding in absolutely batshit, horrific anomalies that would destroy the world without containment in place.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3100 SCP-3100 — The Reliquary], by [[*user minmin]]**\nThis is my favorite by far of the “what if the afterlife is really shitty / what if we don’t die” trope on the site. What I like is that it does just far enough with the technobabble and unexplained decisionmaking to add creepiness, but still gives me something human and terrifying to grab onto.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-072 SCP-072 — The Foot of the Bed], by [[*user Kate McTiriss]]**\nThe reason that I haven’t been able to sleep without tucking my feet under the blankets since February 2013. Probably the skip that’s had the longest-lasting “real-world” effect on how I behave.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3091 SCP-3091 — Temporal Funnel Trap], by [[*user Sophia Light]]**\nThe Red Room anomaly is so ominous! And the mysterious facility built at an unknown time for an unknown purpose has big 5001 vibes (I know it came earlier, of course).\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[Tab Real-life work I admire]]\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n//I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE, YOU LITERARY FUCK//\n- [[*user Elenee FishTruck]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThe below is a collection of media—some written, some not—which I adore and recommend to fans of my work or the site.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Anything by Amy Hempel (my favorite is \"Weekend\")**\n//Prose poetry//\n\n\"And when the men kissed the women good night, and their weekend whiskers scratched the women's cheeks, the women did not think shave, they thought: stay.\"\n\n**//Citizen//, Claudia Rankine**\n//Lyric//\n\n\"Perhaps the most insidious and least understood form of segregation is that of the word.\"\n\n**//Hiroshima//, John Hersey**\n//Narrative nonfiction//\n\n\"There, in the tin factory, in the first moment of the atomic age, a human being was crushed by books.\"\n\n**\"Street Haunting\", Virginia Woolf**\n//Personal essay//\n\nAs the foxhunter hunts in order to preserve the breed of foxes, and the golfer plays in order that open spaces may be preserved from the builders, so when the desire comes upon us to go street rambling the pencil does for a pretext, and getting up we say: \"Really I must buy a pencil.”\n\n**\"Once More To The Lake\", E.B.
