Director Ochako Nakamura has been reprimanded for the accidental dissemination of this and the inappropriate behavior displayed within it; she will be demoted swiftly at the next O5 council meeting.\n\nIf you are viewing this, understand that its current position on Foundation servers is not an accident, as it is currently being preserved by RAISA software for use as a teaching tool regarding professional documentation practices. As a result, this file cannot be deleted until that process is complete; tampering with any material present here will result in severe disciplinary action.\n\n**Marking Key:**[[/=]]\n* Inappropriately personal thoughts will be highlighted in red.\n* Improper formatting will be highlighted in orange.\n* Unverified and/or inaccurate information will be highlighted in yellow.\n* All footnotes within this document are strictly RAISA sourced.

Five years living in Japan and you think she’d have gotten over it, but no! No! God. I’m such a terrible mother.[[/span]][[/footnote]][[/span]] with some exceptions. [[span class=\"hili markerorange\"]]like how one of the stupid marshalls got into a fistfight with one of our undercovers in 04 because they genuinely didn’t believe in santa claus.[[/span]] [[span class=\"hili markeryellow\"]] also all of the damage caused in the skirmish got written off as a tax break?????[[/span]][[footnote]]It is currently unknown if the damage caused by Incident 012-6123 was actually able to be written off by GoI-012. The more accurate information to have put here was that the agent was dismembered and baked into Christmas cookies for a one young PoI-012-04, a.k.a Iris Darke.[[/footnote]] [[span class=\"hili markerred\"]] how the fuck do they always get away with that cockshit i need to go ask [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/application-to-form-mtf-mu3-supplementary-docs dunn] about this again[[/span]]\n\nSince 2015, SCP-8525 is showing an unusual rate of success. Intel from various sting operations indicate GoI-012 has hindered 45% of production and performance capabilities of PoI-025, significantly hampering the global outreach previously maintained by him and his associates.\n\nProjects under the SCP-8525 designation are currently known to include:\n* **BLACKDOG:** [[span class=\"hili markerorange\"]] >+*%aaaa*~~~~~~~~~[[span class=\"invisible\"]] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

(god what does that mean? ?? ) While confirmed to be a BLACKDOG-related phenomenon, no action could be taken at the time without minor (haha minor) destabilization in mail-delivery activities. Shortly after, tensions in Guiseppi escalated, culminating in the local mall being commandeered by a children's street gang. The Foundation stepped in under the guise of being federal agents at this point.

The elves were in dire need of reinforcements against the belligerents, thus the Foundation used a rudimentary teleportation device to send personnel onto the train without detection.

I’m not sure how that happened, especially because it is still able to be copy-pasted. \nI’m unsure of whether or not to recommend the necessary discipline for the contents as would normally be enacted. Public discussion of Fire Suppression Department activities is normally grounds for severe demotion, but Director Nakamura’s behavior throughout this document has lead me to wonder if this was an intentional act on her behalf to relieve herself of her current position. If so, it would show she is clever enough to remain at the Foundation, so it may be more beneficial to put her on a heavy dose of amnestics than demote her. \n[[/div]]\n\nThe altercation ended with [[span class=\"hili markerorange\"]] with one of these guys donating like [[/span]][[span class=\"hili markerred\"]]literally the cost a burger king combo because elves are fucking stupid. my lifelong dream of fucking a hot white chocolate Legolas dnd elf is out the window now[[footnote]] [[span class=\"hili markerred\"]] I only wanted to give my daughter the best life I can’t parent her all by myself[[/span]][[/footnote]], APPARENTLY, because they’re all fucking toy makers and two feet tall.
