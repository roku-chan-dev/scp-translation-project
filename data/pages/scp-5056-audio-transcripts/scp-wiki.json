Since 9 September 2002 it has been fixated on Site-43 Janitorial and Maintenance Technician JM64 (Philip E. Deering), following him from surface to surface and issuing a constant stream of verbal abuse relating to his insecurities and fears. As SCP-5056-A has been known to \"attack\" individuals threatening Deering by manifesting on their eyes or eyewear, he has been permanently confined to Site-43 and its environs.\n\n**Database Contents:** Only JM64 can hear SCP-5056-A's vocalizations, but recording devices activated by him will register them correctly. As such, his standard issue uniform contains an in-seam always-on microphone. This database contains transcripts of Deering's recorded interactions with SCP-5056-A for scientific research purposes. Search criteria must be submitted in advance to the Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43; please allow up to five working days for parsing and processing.\n[[=]]\n++ **Your request has been processed, and the results are appended below.**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FDF6D7; padding-left: 6px; padding-right: 6px;\"]]\n**Log #5056-06-12-20**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px;\"]]\n**Date and Time:** 06/12/2020, 4:05 PM\n**Location:** Chair's Office, Psychology and Parapsychology Section, Site-43\n**Context:** Annual psychological review\n**Present:** Dr. N.
