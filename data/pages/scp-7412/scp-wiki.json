As of writing, SCP-7412 is scheduled to be retroactively nullified on January 13th, 2024.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7412 refers to a sudden, universal CK-Class Event that occurred on January 12th, 2023, at 17:22:58 EST. After cross-referencing with Deepwell Archives, it was determined that the only change caused by SCP-7412 was the retroactive alteration of causality to add exactly one minor holiday to every extant religion.\n\nHolidays retroactively created by SCP-7412 — henceforth SCP-7412-1 — each have varying practices and customs consistent with their corresponding religions. However, despite each having their own distinct cultural rituals, SCP-7412-1 instances seem to follow a few key similarities:\n\n* The holiday will have little overall impact on the extant religion or the course of history, but will still be acknowledged as a unique celebratory event.\n* The holiday will involve some form of victory or success where a situation appeared hopeless or impossible, often through the form of a miracle.\n* The holiday's practices involve celebrating a spiritual leader, some form of game played for monetary or faux-monetary gain, or the construction of a yurt.\n* The holiday occurred on January 12th, 1968, the birth date of [[[undervegas-hub | Site-666 Director Randall House]]].\n\nSCP-7412 was discovered following mass-desynchronization of CK-Class Scenario Detectors (CSDs) from their extra-universal counterparts, indicating a restructuring event had occurred. Shortly thereafter, various Exclusionary Sites confirmed consistent reports that reality had been altered retrocasually; analysis revealed roughly 640 pages of archives came into existence with the CK-Class Event, most relating to minor religious holidays. SCP-7412 and SCP-7412-1 were classified as anomalous shortly thereafter.\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum One — Abridged Log of SCP-7412-1 Instances**\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n> **Affected Religion:** Judaism\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Hanukkah Sheini / Hanukkah Katan[[footnote]]lit. //Second Hanukkah// / //Minor Hanukkah//.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** 26 Tevet\n> \n> **Historical Context:** During the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy by the Maccabees, a surprise attack left Jewish forces in retreat, forcing them away from Jerusalem. Judah Maccabee ordered there to be a fast for all soldiers in the Maccabeean force. On the third day, when it appeared the Jewish forces were surrounded, a mysterious figure only named //Ben Randel// appeared and began to fight the Seleucid army, motivating the remaining Jews to continue fighting, leading to an unexpected Jewish victory. \n> \n> Ben Randel was not spotted or identified following the battle. Jewish tradition maintains that this individual was none other than Elijah the prophet.\n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** Hanukkah Katan is considered a Rabbinical minor holiday in Jewish culture, and thus is not subject to the laws of //Yom Tovim//. Similar to Hanukkah itself, it is customary to partake in a game of //dreidal//, which involves a spinning top and the exchange of faux-money depending on how the top lands. Additionally, a single candle is lit to commemorate the bravery of Ben Randel in his battle against the Greeks.\n> \n> It should be noted that some Sephardi Jews have a custom to construct a circular tent similar to a //Sukkah// on Hanukkah Katan, although it is unclear where the custom originates.\n\n\n\n> **Affected Religion:** Christianity\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Second Epiphany[[footnote]]Or \"Second Theophany\" in most Eastern Orthodox traditions.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** January 12th\n> \n> **Historical Context:** Additional text found on Papyri 𝔓1[[footnote]]B. P. Grenfell & A. S. Hunt, Oxyrhynchus Papyri I, pp. 4–7, 1901 (note that this deviates from pre-CK Event records).[[/footnote]] mentions an additional Magi to visit the infant Christ, resulting in a slight addition to the Gospel of Matthew's recounting of the Magi's visit (though Matt. 2:1-12 remain unchanged):\n> \n>> ^^13^^ In a week's time, after the departure of the others, \n>> a final Magi appeared before the child and his mother, \n>> bringing greater gifts in apology for the lateness of his visit.\n>> ^^14^^ Great merriment and joy did he bring to Bethlehem to compensate, \n>> for he came not for homage but to ease the burden of anxiety upon\n>> Christ and his family in the manner of celebration long awaited.\n> \n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** Similar to Mardi Gras, the celebration of Second Epiphany has evolved culturally into a celebration bordering on excess, with a ceremonial tossing of 'burdens' into a fire pit to limit their ability to affect celebrants into the new year. Several Protestant denominations condemned the practice entirely during the Reformation, resulting in local pushback in areas where Puritanism or Calvinism were more commonly practiced after colonization. \n\n> **Affected Religion:** Islam\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Eid ul-Dawra[[footnote]]lit. //Celebration of the Cycle//.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** 12 Shawwal\n> \n> **Historical Context:** Although largely unassociated with the cultural practices of the holiday, a common folk legend involves a village being attacked by an Ifrit.[[footnote]]A powerful demon in Islam tradition.[[/footnote]] According to the legend, the Ifrit used its abilities to hold the sun in the sky, preventing it from setting on the day before Eid al-Fitr. Although permitted to eat in life-threatening situations, no one in the town wished to break the fast to give satisfaction to the Ifrit.\n> \n> However, the Khalifah of the village procured a solution to trick the Ifrit. The Khalifah coordinated with his citizens to create many large mirrors and told them to bring them onto the nearby hills. Then, angling them correctly, the mirrors would reflect sunlight towards a single concentrated point on the opposite horizon. Confused by the presence of a second sun-like object across from him, the Ifrit rushed towards the opposite side of the sky. He dropped the real sun in the process, giving it just enough time to set before the Jinn could learn the source of the trick. It is believed that the time the sun ended up setting was supposed to be the 12th of Shawwal.\n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** Eid ul-Dawra is informally celebrated in a similar manner to Eid al-Fitr, following 10 days of optional fasting during the month of Shawwal. These days consist of six days of customary fasting, followed by four days of fasting either to make up missed days of Ramadan or on behalf of others who could not fast. The optional fasting ends on the night of the 12th, signifying the start of Eid ul-Dawra.[[footnote]]Days in the Muslim calendar begin and end at sunset.[[/footnote]] During the day of the 12th, it was customary to construct a yurt or tent post-breaking (symbolizing rejuvenation), though this custom has fallen out of favor in modern times. \n> \n> It should be noted that although the holiday is recognized across all denominations, Sunni Muslims place more emphasis on the day being specifically on the 12th, while Shia Muslims celebrate it more loosely and as a general period of celebration.\n\n\n\n> **Affected Religion:** Hinduism\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Purva Holika [[footnote]]lit. //Early Holi//[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** 12 [[footnote]]lit. //Magh//[[/footnote]]ماگھ\n> \n> **Historical Context:** Local to the Sindh region of Pakistan, the festival commemorates the victory of Hamsa Rama, an avatar of Viṣṇu, over a group of demonic Asuras in 'a game of chance with nothing at hand but a wooden die'.[[footnote]]While not all extant manuscripts of the //Bhagavata Purana// includes this deviation in Chapter 7, the anomalous corruption of //Bhāgavatamahāpurāṇam// (which acted as the common translation source) has resulted in roughly 70% of all copies of the text worldwide including the text of this incident.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** While mirroring some of the traditional aesthetics of the later Grand Festival of Holi in the spring, Purva Holika typically is noted by the exclusive use of red and black rice powder in a more combative manner, with 'sides' chosen loosely amongst participants and often changing in the middle of the play fighting. Interestingly, the festival does not commemorate romantic or familial love, as is heavily emphasized during the later traditional Holi festival.\n\n\n> **Affected Religion:** Tengrism[[footnote]]Commonly known as traditional Mongolian Shamanism.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** [[size 130%]]ᠲᠣᠯᠢ ᠲᠩᠷᠢ[[/size]][[footnote]]lit. //Opened Tengri//. There are multiple theories about the name, but no conclusive reasoning as the Eagle God Tengri is not mentioned directly either in historical records or modern cultural celebrations of the holiday.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** [[size 130%]]༡༢ ᠨᠢᠭᠡᠳᠦᠭᠡᠷ ᠰᠠᠷ᠎[[/size]][[footnote]]lit. //Arvan hoyr Negdügeer sar//.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Historical Context:** Celebrating the day that the lasting conflict between Genghis Khan and the supreme imperial shaman Kokochu Teb was finally settled without bloodshed. As described in the //Mongɣol‑un niɣuca tobciyan// (Secret History of the Mongol People), an 'outsider arrived and acted as mediator between the two foes with the aid of the //tngri// spirits of both white and dark nature.' These negotiations are not described, but the outsider was welcomed to the feast to celebrate the accord as its 'architect'. \n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** A traditional feast with roast horse and shamanistic drum dances, typically held in the most hospitable area the nomads might find on the Steppe during late winter. It is notable that while wagering and races are encouraged amongst celebrants, the yurt plays no particular central role beyond its traditional housing of tribes in the region.\n\n\n> **Affected Religion:** Mekhanism\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Δαμάτριος[[footnote]]lit. //Damátrios//. The name of one of the Boeotian lunar months listed by the Greek poet Hesoid (c. 750-650 BCE) in his //Theogonía//, and also mentioned in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/rounderhouse-gold-proposal Aegean Tablets] which led to the discovery of Amoni-Ram. This connection is being researched further.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** 12 Ιανουάριος \n> \n> **Historical Context:** Unknown. The holiday has persisted into the modern day, however due to the Mekhanite diaspora, there is little consistent information about the origin of the holiday.[[footnote]]Although the holiday is apparently celebrated in the city of Amoni-Ram, it likely has origins within the diaspora itself, leading to a lack of primary, secondary, or tertiary sources on its origin.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** Celebrants typically will use the anticipatory days before the holiday to decorate a basic rounded tent structure, often formed from a single sheet of metal, with increasingly complex mechanisms fashioned out of fuladh. Traditions have recently fractured due to the deunification of the Church; Cogsworth Orthodox adherents tend to aim for minimalism in their designs, while Maxwellists design the yurts in 3D modelling programs, often with surrealist or non-euclidean appearances. \n\n\n\n> **Affected Religion:** The Ortothan Religion\n> \n> **Holiday Name:** Yorie-Aímact Kal[[footnote]]lit. //Day of the Sixth's Blood//[[/footnote]] \n> \n> **Date of Celebration:** Occurs eight times per galactic cycle. Exact date unclear; last celebrated January 12th, 1968.\n> \n> **Historical Context:** According to Ortothan tradition, over 100,000 years ago a sudden and large invasion of Voruteut attacked Yorun-leusan, the Holy Sixth. This invasion was apparently on a similar scale to the one that would later kill them in 2000, primarily targeting their blood supply in an attempt to drain their power. This attack nearly succeeded; however, close to the brink of death, an entity only known in holy scriptures as //Houís-Rakdal// (given the title \"ruler of house of circles\") is said to have sacrificed itself to give Yorun-leusan the blood they needed to survive.\n> \n> **Cultural Practices:** To honor Houís-Rakdal's sacrifice, many Ortothans — including the Church of the Second Hytoth — let blood in a special circular room attached to many Ortothan religious buildings. Another custom observed by some human and alien groups involve tossing light objects of monetary value into the air and not retrieving them.[[footnote]]In this context of SCP-7412, this is believed to be analogous to gambling.[[/footnote]] The origin of this practice is unclear.\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum Two — [DATA EXPUNGED]**\n\n----\n\n= The remainder of this file is classified to DoTT/5 Clearance only.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[UNLOCK FILE]\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\n\nThe following events occurred in Director Yossarian Leiner's office at Reliquary Area-27 on January 13th, 2023.
