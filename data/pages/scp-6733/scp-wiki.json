[[footnote]] The tape vault is a controlled environment designed to mitigate data degradation arising from temperature and humidity. [[/footnote]]\n\nEfforts to identify the actors and locations depicted in SCP-6733 are currently ongoing. Stills of the cast are compared weekly to new entrants in the Foundation facial recognition database. A manual effort is underway to investigate contemporary film production sets and compare these to SCP-6733's locations.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6733 is a VHS tape cassette containing a recording of the horror movie \"The Suburb Slasher Strikes Again\" which was, according to the cassette's slipcase, produced by \"Crystal Elms Productions\" in 1985. The movie appears to be a sequel to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5733 SCP-5733], \"The Suburb Slasher Returns\". The primary antagonist of SCP-6733 is \"The Suburb Slasher\", 6733-1, a spree killer who was also present in SCP-5733.\n\nWhen watched, the film causes the observer to become a conduit for the localised destabilisation of reality. Only one viewing of the film, ordered by research lead Dr. Carpenter, has been conducted and documented (See test details below). However, it is currently hypothesised that testing may have occurred more times than currently thought. Investigation is under way.\n\n**Testing:** The testing ordered comprised of a D-class personnel being shown SCP-5733 up till the point its anomalous properties manifest. The same D-class was then to be shown SCP-6733, with the tape inserted into a VHS player attached to a television situated in a testing chamber. Given the unknown effects of SCP-6733, the D-class would be left alone in the chamber to watch the film, and interviewed following conclusion of the film.\n\nThe contents of SCP-6733 and its effects are documented in the addenda below:\n\n------\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Testing Log\" hide=\"Testing Log\"]]\n> = **ACT I: TESTING LOG**\n> \n> //[Footage begins.]//\n> \n> //[Dr. Malcolm Baines enters the testing chamber. D-1974 is sat down, opposite a television and VHS set.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Hi Jaime, I'm assisting in today's experiments. How are you feeling following the film?\n> \n> **D-1974:** Hey, good to meet you. I'm feeling okay, thanks. One of the nicer experiments I've been involved in.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Good to hear. We're just going to run some quick tests...\n> \n> //[Over the next five minutes, Dr. Baines administers cognitive impairment tests to D-1974. All results are within baseline.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Okay, so -- with those out the way, let's talk about the film. Could you tell me what you  saw please? \n> \n> **D-1974:** Like, the plot and stuff?\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Yes, that sounds like a good starting point.\n> \n> **D-1974:** It was pretty much your standard slasher film. There's a group of teens who've just graduated high school and go to a local camping site by a lake to celebrate. One of them mentions it's near the site where the killer, The Slasher, was shot dead by police a year prior after a rampage-  \n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Would this be the events of the first film?\n> \n> //[D-1974 shrugs.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** It's not really clear. They all think it's a joke, apart from the main girl -- she says her dad's a police officer and she's seen video evidence of the attack. No-one references any of the characters from the first film though, and they don't show up in this one either. The Slasher's the only constant.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Interesting; please continue.\n> \n> **D-1974:** So they all go camping by the lake, but soon everything starts going to shit. The site's caretaker gets killed off-screen, then the Slasher starts stalking the kids and doing away with them. \n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Doing away how?\n> \n> **D-1974:** Err...let's see. //[D-1974 checks the notes he made during the screening.]// He's still got a kitchen knife, same weapon as the first film, so he stabs a lot of them. It's pretty gory for the time it was made. He slashes up someone's face, then the nerdy guy gets stabbed through the eye -- that one's pretty good, the camera gets sprayed with blood. One of the last teens gets his head crushed wide open.\n> \n> //[D-1974 chuckles to himself.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** There's a walk-in freezer in the main admin building where one of her mates has been hung up. It's never explained WHY a campsite needs one of those, but it's just there, ha. The Slasher locks someone in there then throws their body, shattering it into a bloody, icy slush.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** How did these scenes make you feel?\n> \n> **D-1974:** Like... there's some good jump scares, and the tension's fairly high at points, but it's a little dated. I've seen scarier, but I've also seen worse horrors.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Anything feel like it particularly lingers and stays with you?\n> \n> //[D-1974 does not immediately respond.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** Well, the end scene. The end scene is pretty weird.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Tell me about it.\n> \n> //[D-1974 fidgets, avoiding eye contact with Dr. Baines.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** So, the girl and her best friend, the one that's been looking out for her this whole time, enter into a cellar. The Slasher creeps up from behind, and grabs the friend -- tears his head clean off his neck. \n> \n> The Slasher then chases the final teen to the side of the lake. He's advancing on her. The camera's set on the water of the lake, it's a wide shot. You've got the lake waterline parallel to the top and bottom of the shot, so it splits the screen horizontally. She's fallen over, crawling away from him. As he advances on her, the camera zooms in -- slowly though. It takes its time. He does too.\n> \n> There's music at the start of the scene: deep, dark synths. This stops as the camera moves closer though. I forgot to say, it's, it's a long scene. Longer than five minutes, maybe it was ten. I don't know. It felt longer than ten. So the Slasher's approaching her, we're - the viewers - approaching the shore. Then the music stops, and it's just his footsteps and her pleading. And she's pleading, man, she's... there's these big, inhales of breath stifled by the mucus running out her nose. She's babbling, but it gets to a point she's not even saying words, just making noise.\n> \n> //[D-1974 appears visibly distressed.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** What next?\n> \n> **D-1974:** The camera's real close to the shore now -- and the Slasher stops. He turns his head and looks straight at the camera. You can't see his eyes, but you know he's looking straight at you. And he just stands there, staring. Eventually the girl crawls out the frame, or the camera zooms past her. I can't remember which. It just keeps zooming in on his face. Where his face should be under the hood. The girl keeps screaming off-camera. Then there's this guttural, ripping noise and the screaming stops. It just stops, but the camera keeps moving. You can see the individual droplets of blood splashed across him. You can see the fabrics that make up his hood. His face soon takes up the entire shot. And then...\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** And then?\n> \n> **D-1974:** ...it ends. No credits or nothing. The tape just cuts to black, and was pushed out the player.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** That's it? There was nothing else?\n> \n> **D-1974:** No, that was it. Why would I lie?\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** I didn't say you lied. When the girl was pleading, was she pleading at you? \n> \n> **D-1974:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Was it like she was talking specifically to you, to Jaime? \n> \n> **D-1974:** No? I don't think so? It was just, it was a disturbing scene. There wasn't anything weird in an anomalous sense -- I just haven't seen a film end like that before.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Okay, I understand. Was there anything else notable about the film? Anything else out the ordinary? \n> \n> //[D-1974 takes a moment to contemplate the question.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** ...I can't remember their name. \n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Whose name?\n> \n> **D-1974:** The girl. Her friends. All of them. I don't think they had names.\n> \n> ------\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Incident Log\" hide=\"Incident Log\"]]\n> = **ACT II: INCIDENT LOG**\n\n> //[Dr. Baines enters D-1974's dormitory room.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** Hey, Doc.\n> \n> //[D-1974 rubs his eyes as Dr. Baines enters.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Jaime, you wanted to speak to me?\n> \n> **D-1974:** Yeah, I had questions. I wanted to know why I had to watch that film the other day?\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** You know I can't share details like that with you. Why do you ask?\n> \n> **D-1974:** I just- it wasn't snuff, right? It wasn't real? \n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Everything's real in a sense. We have a tape of it, it must have been filmed. But as to the nature of those deaths? It's difficult to say. Did the effects seem realistic? You described one as 'corny' yesterday.\n> \n> **D-1974:** I thought it was yesterday, but now I'm not so sure. I kept thinking about the film as I went to sleep. And then I dreamt it. I was there, crawling by the lake. And I remembered all my friends and their deaths and they seemed so real. And when I woke up, I could have sworn, I could have //sworn//, that there was a shadow outside my room. Someone leering in through the frosted glass on the door. \n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** What did you do?\n> \n> **D-1974:** I was frozen. I've never felt fear like it before. I just sat upright in my bed, staring at the door. I hoped that if I kept watching, it wouldn't come in. When the sun rose, and the light entered my room, it faded away. What's the scariest thing you've seen here?\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** I- I don't understand the question.\n> \n> **D-1974:** You must've worked with anomalies before. Or is this your first?\n> \n> //[Dr. Baines is silent for a moment.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** …Why don't we get back to talking about you? You know there couldn't have been anyone outside yesterday. Security guarding the corridor would have seen something and raised the alarm. I want you to keep me updated though. Any other dreams, see anything else that's untoward - let me know.\n> \n> **D-1974:** Thank you, Dr. Baines.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Please, call me Malcolm. \n> \n> //[Dr. Baines leaves the dormitory, entering the adjacent corridor. He walks to the end, and talks to the guard on duty.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** Hey, hopefully a quick one: do you know the name of the person stationed here last night?\n> \n> **GUARD:** Agent Cunningham -- or, it was meant to be. He was assigned but failed to show. Went to town before his shift and didn't come back. Bosses will have him fired faster than anything when he does show.\n> \n> **Dr. Baines:** …I see.

The Site's abandoned, I can’t find anyone. You, you were just in the interview room? Where you left me earlier?\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** Yes, I went to find help, but there's no-one else here. It's just us two. We need to stick together.\n> \n> **D-1974:** That part of the site is over an hour away on foot. \n> \n> //[Dr Baines stares at D-1974.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** We're scared and tired. It doesn't matter. We just need to press on. Despite everything we know, I think you can't comprehend unadulterated, pure evil until it stares right at you. Today, I think evil has us in its sights.\n> \n> //[As Dr Baines begins to move further into the basement, D-1974 takes a step up the stairs.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** Jaime. We go this way.\n> \n> **D-1974:** But-\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** We need to stay close. This way.\n> \n> **D-1974:** This way? Into the dark, creepy basement? Are you serious? \n> \n> //[D-1974 turns and continues up the stairs.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** Jaime! Wait! \n> \n> //[D-1974 reaches the top of the stairs.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** Don't leave!\n> \n> ------\n> \n> //[D-1974 emerges from the basement. Full power has returned to the site lights, to the extent D-1974 and his surroundings look overexposed. He holds up his arm, shielding his eyes from the light.]//\n> \n> //[He proceeds to stumble through the corridor, trying the handles on each door as he goes. The last breaks off in his hand -- he drops it and continues on, eventually returning to outside the interview room.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** Baines was right. I... I swore it was the other side of the site.\n> \n> //[A pool of congealing blood covers the corridor floor; within it lies Officer Loren's handgun. The corpse, however, is nowhere to be seen. D-1974 picks up the gun and proceeds onwards.]//\n> \n> //[He turns into the next corridor, and immediately shouts out.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** Oh thank god. Hello! Hello!\n> \n> //[Ahead, a figure rests against the corridor wall. D-1974 runs towards it.]//\n>  \n> **D-1974:** I need help, there's been a breach. We need to get out of-\n> \n> //[As he approaches, D-1974 trails off. The figure in front of him is dressed in site security gear. It holds a lit cigarette in its left hand. It raises the cigarette, and inserts the end into its exposed trachea. The trachea slurps and contracts, as the cigarette's smoke is inhaled.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** out... out of here....\n> \n> //[REC-Rosso raises his spare hand and swats in the direction of D-1974. As he does so, the mess of fibres and viscera at the top of his neck, exposed by the absence of a head, flap about.]//\n> \n> //[D-1974 steps backwards, bumping into an unknown object. He spins round, and begins to stutter, but is interrupted.]//\n> \n> **REC-Vidal:** We're on break. Fuck off. \n> \n> //[REC-Vidal and REC-Mellor walk around D-1974 towards REC-Rosso. The latter reaches into his pocket and pulls out a carton of cigarettes, offering them to his newly arrived team mates.]//\n> \n> **REC-Mellor:** This better not be another rewrite.\n> \n> //[D-1974 sprints away. The camera follows, positioned closely behind him. He navigates through a complex maze of corridors which seem to grow increasingly narrow. He enters corridor after corridor until he turns into one and freezes -- ahead of him stands 6733-1.]//\n> \n> //[He pulls out the gun, aims, and fires.]//\n> \n> //[Nothing happens.]//\n> \n> //[He pulls the gun near his face to take a closer look, before switching from holding the handle to the barrel. He squeezes. The gun shatters; fragile plastic fragments scatter across the floor.]//\n> \n> **Unknown:** I found you.\n> \n> //[D-1974 startles, as Dr Baines approaches him from behind.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** It's okay, you're improvising. We can work with that. But we need to get to the basement Jaime; you understand that, right? \n> \n> //[Dr Baines reaches out towards D-1974.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** Get away from me!\n> \n> //[With his full force, D-1974 shoves Dr Baines away, sending him flying backwards.]//\n> \n> //[He collides with the corridor wall. The entirety of the wall shakes, before falling completely backwards. As it hits the floor, wooden splinters erupt into the air. Dr Baines falls with it. Next, a lighting rig falls from the ceiling. It lands on Dr Baines, pinning him in place.]//\n> \n> //[The fallen wall exposes only pitch-black darkness behind it.]//\n> \n> **Dr Baines:** Ah! What the fuck do you think you're doing!?\n> \n> **Unknown:** Oh Christ. Oh shit. \n> \n> //[An unidentified woman runs into the frame.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** I...I'm sorry!\n> \n> **Unknown:** Are you hurt? \n>  \n> **Dr Baines:** I'm alright, I'm alright. Fucking amateurs man, christ!\n> \n> //[More unidentified persons enter the shot. In the background, the Slasher begins to walk down the corridor, towards the commotion.]//\n> \n> **Unknown:** Look at yourself first -- you couldn't get him to the goddamn basement!\n> \n> **D-1974:** Who- who are you people?\n> \n> **Unknown-2:** Can we get a medic on set please?\n> \n> //[The Slasher approaches D-1974 -- they halt suddenly and stare directly at the camera.]//\n> \n> **Unknown-3:** Shit, we're going to need production and lighting back to reset this. Are they still on the lot?\n> \n> //[The camera begins to zoom in, focusing on 6733-1's face. As it zooms in, D-1974, Dr Baines, and the unknown individuals are excluded from the frame.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** //[Offscreen.]// Where am I?\n> \n> **Unknown-5:** //[Offscreen.]// Cut! Cut!\n> \n> //[6733-1's face takes up the entirety of the shot.]//\n> \n> **D-1974:** //[Offscreen.]// Where the hell am I?!\n> \n> = **[D-1974 SCREAMS.]**\n> \n> = **[THE  TAPE CUTS TO BLACK.]**\n> ------\n> **Afterword:** The above transcript of SCP-6733's contents was created after the tape was watched by D-1888 during a testing session overseen by Dr. Carpenter.
