Having entered my adolescence shortly after the Veil was dropped, I grew up entrenched in the ensuing cultural craze over anomalies. It was inevitable, in hindsight-- to be an eleven-year-old girl and learn that magic was real? It captured my every waking moment. How could it not?\n\nTo my young mind, it was at once captivating and terrifying to peer behind the Foundation's shroud, to discover that the world was so full of things that couldn't be explained or even described. It was a waking dream and an inescapable nightmare. I couldn't tear myself away. The more I learned, the more I understood how little I would ever know.\n\nWhen I started my tenure at the Beijing Institute of Anomalous Science, I began to find some relief from this existential horror in chaos theory. The world is unpredictable and unfathomably strange, yes, but it all still operates on a complex system of fundamental laws. Consider the second law of thermodynamics; despite everything, one can at least trust that the universe will always progress towards a state of lower energy. Entropy provides a sort of bleak comfort in its absolute certainty.\n\nThese philosophical concerns weren't far from my mind when I began studying SCP-7009. Once again, I faced a universe that made no sense. SCP-7009 shouldn't be possible without some degree of reality alteration-- but wherever we found it, Hume levels remained stable. No trace of thaumaturgic or ontokinetic activity was ever found.\n\nSCP-7009 is merely the child of random chance-- but \"random\" doesn't really exist. Chaos is the result of immeasurably complex laws. And so, as I stare into this abyss of utter improbability, I find myself revising my old mantra:\n\nThe universe will always progress towards a state of lower energy. Roads will always lead to Rome.\n\n[[>]]\n--Dr.  Xiu Huang\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n----\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7008]]] | SCP-7009 | [[[SCP-7010]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 7009-Thumbnail.png\n> **Author:** [[*user MontagueETC]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:** Dougga Roman Theater\n> **Author:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/people/davidstanleytravel/ | David Stanley]]]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/25901468768 | Flickr]]]\n> -----\n> **Name:** Mars sky at noon PIA01546.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA/JPL-Caltech\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_sky_at_noon_PIA01546.jpg | Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Mars Theater.png\n> **Author:** [[*user MontagueETC]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:** Dougga Roman Theater\n> **Author:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/people/davidstanleytravel/ | David Stanley]]]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/79721788@N00/25901468768 | Flickr]]]\n> -----\n> **Name:** Mars sky at noon PIA01546.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA/JPL-Caltech\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mars_sky_at_noon_PIA01546.jpg | Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
