Trapper was deployed to the outskirts of ██████████, ██████████ on 10/28/1981, following the disappearance of a Foundation field agent. The agent was investigating a number of localized missing persons cases, as well the loss of contact with several law enforcement officers dispatched to investigate these cases, in the area.\n\n> <**Begin transcript**>\n> \n> **Trapper Home:** All right, let's get those comm checks people.

Something's been dead for a while… stand by… Team, halt. Home, I'm looking at some shredded clothing down here. No bodies, just the clothes, and nothing that looks like our man. There's the cop…\n> \n> **Agent Hoskins (T1):** Jesus man, look at that… it looks like something just took a huge bite outta that vest…\n> \n> **Trapper Home:** Lock it up down there, One. Washburne, get back on track.\n> \n> **Agent Washburne (T1L):** Copy, Home. Trapper Two, watch yourselves. Something around our pos has an appetite, and it looks like it's got a pretty mean bite.\n> \n> **Agent Michaels (T2L):** Solid, One. We're almost done up here. If our Agent's here, he's down there with you guys. We'll be down as soon as we-\n> \n> <A muffled human voice is audible through Agent Washburne's VOX feed, unintelligible and distant.>\n> \n> **Agent Washburne (T1L):** One and Two, freeze.\n> \n> <**Unknown source:** Help me! Jesus Christ! Somebody!>\n> \n> **Agent Washburne (T1L):** Home, Two, I think we've got our man. Hustle up, people.\n> \n> <Trapper One can be heard moving quickly through the structure. The cry for help is again audible.>\n> \n> **Agent Washburne (T1L):** Home, we've reached the source of the noise. We're about to get our Agent back.

Home, we've got an unconscious one. We're gonna need a mobile containment unit, and medical support for the candidate, I think it sucked down some VX.

We're done here.\n> \n> <**End transcript**>",
