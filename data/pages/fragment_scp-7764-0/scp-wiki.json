Clearance is given to edit document 7764/2 to this effect. Civilian and subveil communication channels are to be automatically monitored for mentions of SCP-7764 or Foundation reconstruction and coverup efforts. Historical information has been edited to indicate a rail line between Casablanca and Berrechid passing overhead the Mohammad V International Airport.\n\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n        | name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7764/mohammadv.jpg\n        | caption=Mohammad V International Airport post-reconstruction.\n        | align=center\n        | width=100%]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7764 is the corpse of Lampeter[[footnote]][[[SCP-7005]]], also known as the Lampeter, is a multidimensional transport network utilizing every known mode of transit. Since the bankruptcy of the Lampeter Non-Euclidean Shipping Company, Foundation control has been established over a minority of stations, mostly in this universe (A001 \"Prime\") and its neighbors.[[/footnote]] train Y618.1, which derailed in extradimensional space on 2024-02-24 before re-emerging approximately 200 meters above the Mohammed V International Airport outside Casablanca, Morocco. About 2000 casualties were reported, alongside extensive structural damage to the airport as well as SCP-7005 Line Y618. The Department of Interdimensional Logistics estimates a 25% drop in service capacity across Foundation-controlled universes as a direct result of this incident, as well as the total isolation of Universes N952 \"Manifold Law\", E086 \"Atlas\", and L256 \"Pleiades\". There are no plans at this time to restore service.\n\nThe repeated failure of normalcy restoration efforts indicated the existence of an anomalous effect surrounding the incident itself. This effect, denoted SCP-7764-A, results in all human knowledge about SCP-7764 being completely immune to all known Foundation amnestics. It does not, however, prevent any disinformative or otherwise non-anomalous info-suppression tactics. Due to the risk of SCP-7764-A cross-contamination in the presence of closely-associated memories, Site Director Thomas Graham has authorized internal preemptive amnesticisation of all Foundation employees associated with SCP-7005 Line Y618, or Universes N952, E086, or L256.\n\n[[div class=\"paper\" style=\"overflow: auto;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Preemptive Amnesticization Logs\n-----\nIdentifying information has been expunged per Ethics Committee memorandum.
