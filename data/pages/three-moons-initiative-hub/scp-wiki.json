[[/footnote]]\n\n**Group of Interest Number:** 4019\n\n**AKAs:** Three Moons, Children of JALAKÅRA, Durakh-Naùu[[footnote]] Rare; pejorative. Context unknown. [[/footnote]], ☽☽ Initiative[[footnote]] Until the Third Harvesting War. [[/footnote]], Lunar Dawn Initiative[[footnote]] Original name; changed after the Second Harvesting War. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Area of Operations:** Corbenic, Earth, fictional narratives[[footnote]] Via [[[SCP-3922]]] [[/footnote]]\n\n**Threat Level:** Orange [[span style=\"color:orange\"]]●[[/span]] \n\n**Description:** The Three Moons Initiative is an extradimensional human organization based in [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2922 SCP-2922-C], an afterlife also known as Corbenic. \n\nThe Initiative was founded approximately 14,000 years ago for the purpose of establishing organized human colonization in an afterlife. Through the Initiative, the sins of the deceased are put through a rigorous judging process, and punished and rewarded by a two-thirds majority vote of the Perdition Committee.\n\nThrough the Humanity Defense Corps, their military branch, they act as a multi-dimensional security force for the protection of the human race. As such, they monitor Earth[[footnote]] Our planet is known as the \"Multiversal Iteration 2N\" of Earth; it is unclear how many parallel worlds fall under Initiative jurisdiction. [[/footnote]] and carry out covert military intervention for its defense, often regardless of nuance or long-term consequences.\n\nOrganic matter is incapable of leaving Corbenic. As such, the majority of objects associated with the Three Moons Initiative are drones and other machines remote-controlled from Corbenic. These objects gain access to our world through a dimensional aperture on the dark side of the Moon. \n\nWhile Initiative personnel believe that they're operating in humankind's best interests, military overreach, poor communication, issues with internal bureaucracy, and other factors -- combined with their disproportionately high military strength to our own --  have made them a potential liability to public safety in our dimension. \n\nAn uneasy peace is kept between the Three Moons Initiative and the SCP Foundation via the Treaty of Cagnazzo. Breach of the treaty is to be treated as a potential XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Structure and Personnel]]\n++++ __JALAKÅRA of the Impenetrable__\n\n(Also known as the Arch-Drudgeon, the Great Weaver, the Seventh Prince of Corbenic, and the Holy Sponsor. Previously documented as SCP-PC-005.)\n\nJALAKÅRA is a powerful reality-bending entity native to Corbenic, and based out of \"The Impenetrable,\" a web-fortress thousands of lightyears above the sky of Corbenic.\n\nIllustrations depict JALAKÅRA as a gigantic spider with a human face and a beard.  Prior to contact with the Initiative, JALAKÅRA was worshipped by various tribes of Corbenic as the god of silence, labor, modesty, obedience, and bureaucracy. \n\nThe Initiative regards JALAKÅRA as its patron deity; it supplies energy and resources to the Initiative  in exchange for worship, servitude, and having the final word in all administrative matters.\n\n++++ __The Central Cabal__\n\n13 human monks dedicated to JALAKÅRA and granted a share in its reality-bending powers. They act as JALAKÅRA's advisors in all interactions with humanity. Former Foundation researcher Dr. Janet Spiegel is the only member whose name has been identified.\n\n++++ __Eternal[[footnote]] The \"eternal\" is purely an honorific; an election is scheduled for September of 3960. [[/footnote]] President Girard Sebastien Niang__\n\nFounder of the Initiative, commander-in-chief of its army, and dictator of the colonies. Other than the Central Cabal, President Niang is the only member of the Initiative allowed to directly address JALAKÅRA.\n\nGirard Niang was born in Dakar, Senegal, in an alternate timeline of Earth. Having graduated from the University of Chicago with a PhD in particle physics, he joined the timeline's equivalent of the SCP Foundation -- eventually becoming the Site Director of Foundation Base-19[[footnote]] Site-19 in our timeline [[/footnote]]. \n\nTo avert an XK-Class end-of-the-world scenario, Niang [http://www.scp-wiki.net/radical-acceptance broke protocol to use an experimental planetary relocation device], teleporting the Earth to the extradimensional realm of Corbenic. In the ensuing invasion from SCP-PC-003 \"Strider\" entities, Niang led the remnants of the Foundation, the central government, and other armed factions to successfully repel the invasion over a period of 20 years -- the \"First Harvesting War.\"\n\nIn doing so, not only did Niang become a hero to the remaining humans, but also won the favor of a local deity, JALAKÅRA -- a bitter enemy of the Striders. The resulting partnership between the humans and JALAKÅRA led to the creation of the Lunar Dawn initiative.\n\nAs President, Niang remains a controversial figure among the colonists, with many local media outlets accusing him of abusing his power for personal gain. To assuage the public's fears of authoritarianism, President Niang undergoes voluntary annual \"humbling\" sessions. The content of the humbling process is top secret, but they are carried out by JALAKÅRA and are said to involve excruciating physical and psychological torture designed to shatter the ego and enforce complete humility. \n\nAfter humblings were formally put into practice, many other media outlets have accused President Niang of ineptitude and indecisiveness.\n\n++++ __General Janet Spiegel__\n\nFormer Foundation researcher. Through her death, first contact between Corbenic and the living world could be established. She defected from the Foundation due to conflicts regarding her husband, Herman Spiegel, and joined the Initiative. She served in the Central Cabal for five years, until JALAKÅRA found her talents more suited to the Humanity Defense Corps, where she successfully repressed a plot to overthrow the government of Corbenic's Saklovai Prefecture. \n\nThough the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/now-watch-and-learn-heres-the-deal death] and subsequent [http://www.scp-wiki.net/ill-be-home-for-christmas capture] of Dr. Isaiah Henderson has quelled some of her resentment, she remains one of the most prominent voices in the Initiative government for military action against the Foundation.\n\n++++ __Colonel James Henson__\n\nThe director of the Initiative's psychotronics division. He was born on \"Iteration 2L\" of Earth, as the parallel-world counterpart to his more pacifist iteration from 2N. Col. Henson designs most of the Initiative's drones (including the \"[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2578 Limulid Series]\"), often controlling them as well. \n\nHaving suffered severe psychological trauma from a Strider attack, Col. Henson has a sadistic attitude toward enemies of the Initiative, and has been known to break protocol to cause as much damage as possible.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Relevant Documentation]]\n+++ \n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp-001 D.
