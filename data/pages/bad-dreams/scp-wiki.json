The watch lights circled lazily in a long, cold circle, waiting for sun that wouldn’t come for another two months. \n\nShe started off, hand on the rope guiding them through the dark, carefully watching her step. Snowshoes were tricky; her worst fear was having to fight in them one day. High heels she could do. Not snowshoes. \n\nThe rope led past the mess to the training facility, the armory, the other dorms for the poor saps that were stuck on winter Lanthanide training assignment against their will. Finally, she came to the old log cabin she was looking for, and trudged up the three steps to the door with “FUCK OFF” written in permanent marker on the window, both in English and shaky Russian. \n\nIn the few years that Adams had spent at Lanthanide, she had never visited Clef’s small house on the edge of the training facility’s grounds. Part of her hesitated a moment on the doorstep, like she was doing something profoundly wrong; her mentor was not necessarily a private man, but also wasn’t one to invite others into his life at all. There was no backstory to it; no reasoning or sad reason why. It just didn’t happen. \n\nBecause Alto Clef was a fucking repulsive little man. \n\nShe looked at the envelope, wondered if it could wait until morning. Maybe it could; she could just leave it here-\n\nSuddenly, Clef started screaming. \n\nClef screamed a lot. One could argue that Adams had heard, actually, nearly every possible sound that Alto Clef could make. But this one started at a low-pitched whine, and grew into a slow, unearthly howl, like a car starting, and increased in pitch and volume until she found herself frozen in place on the doorstep, clutching the envelope tighter. \n\n//What the fuck?//\n\nShe caught herself about thirty seconds into the unholy roar of the damned, and pounded on the door. \n\n“Clef! Are you okay?”\n\nThe house dropped silent. She waited. A few minutes passed. Adams considered knocking again, or doing away with chivalry altogether and just busting in the door, in case he had hurt himself or something-\n\nCLUNK. \n\nThe sound of a lock unlocking. \n\nSHHIIICK. \n\nCLUNK. \n\nTHOCK. \n\nThe sound started at the top of the door, and worked its way down, the sound of about ten heavy-duty locks being pulled away\n\nCLICK\n\nTHOCK\n\nTHOCK\n\nCLICK\n\nCLUNK\n\nThe door opened an inch, and Adams found herself with the tip of a shotgun in her face. \n\n“Leave. Don’t tell anyone what you heard.” His voice was cold, and broke near the end. \n\n“Hey, are you oka-“\n\n“I’m fine. Go away.”\n\n“Look, I brought these files-“\n\n“It. Can wait. Don’t tell anyone what you heard.” \n\n“Clef, what was that? Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine. It happens.”\n\n“What happens?”\n\n“Dreaming. I've seen a lot, Adams. Please give me privacy on this.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The barrel stayed where it was. \n\n“Okay. I won't tell anyone. Um…I’ll…I’ll see you tomorrow.”\n\nIn a moment, the gun was gone, the door was slammed closed, the locks relocked, and Agent Adams was left on the porch, alone. \n\nClef watched her go from the window in the other room. Waited until she was down the road, back to the main facility and the dorms. \n\nHe grinned, pretty damn proud of himself. That was quite a show! God damn. Good cover. Alto Clef, a fucking repulsive little man who had been, in fact, enjoying himself immensely for the past few hours, took his underwear back off, took a Viagra, and put another waffle in the toaster for round number 14.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< | [[[lolFoundation Hub Page| HUB]]] | >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
