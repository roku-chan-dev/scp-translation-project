SCP-6416 manifests across a range of universes (hereafter **Timeplane-6416**) in which the following conditions are met:\n\n* an individual (hereafter PoI-5242) constituting a 99.99998% or greater DNA match to Dr. Abstract M'Doctorat is employed by their respective Foundation-like entity;\n* PoI-5242 undergoes [*/scp-5242 severe identity abstraction] via brief characteristic interchange with a necessarily unspecified semiontological entity;\n* said abstraction affects a **##green|FOURTH-ORDER PUZZLE OBJECT##** (hereafter **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##**) within PoI-5242's possession;\n* PoI-5242 is eventually promoted to Overseer status (invariably O5-6).\n\nIn any timeline which meets the above criteria, all instances of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** are actually //the same instance//, as they have been abstracted to the same fundamental state by **##blue|SCP-INTEGER##**. Collapsing the state of any instance simultaneously collapses every other instance to the same state, causing the restructuring of each of their respective timelines to justify such. To grossly oversimplify: **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** is synchronized across **TP-6416**, and the reconfiguration of any instance results in alterations to the histories of all other instances such that they are identical. It is theorized that this trans-temporal synchronization occurs at the [*/placeholder narrative level], and, thus, supersedes temporal influence.\n\nIterations of PoI-5242 tend to carry **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** on their person with increasing frequency over the duration of their tenure. No single instance can cease existing without all other instances doing the same; the unlikelihood of such an outcome practically ensures the continued existence of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** throughout **TP-6416**. Furthermore, SCP-6416's chronological restructurings adhere to the Path-of-Least-Resistance property, enacting the least drastic possible alterations to justify the state of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##**. In keeping it on their person, PoI-5242 strengthens their causal relationship to the **##green|PUZZLE##**, thereby becoming the most probable mechanism for its reconfiguration which, in turn, increases the likelihood of their own continued existence. It is theorized that relevant iterations of PoI-5242 are aware of these properties and abuse them for parachronological self-preservation.\n\nIn **TP-6416**, PoI-5242 is eventually promoted to Overseer status; it is unclear whether said promotion is causally dependent on their use of SCP-6416. Whether pre- or post-promotion, PoI-5242  eventually develops a communications matrix which reads and decodes the state of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** into an unknown form of instruction, likely memetic in nature. The observation of these instructions by PoI-5242 results in their respective Foundation's development of paratechnologies which then allow their isolation from RCT-Δt's influence via interdimensional data shielding. Approximately 44% of timelines within **TP-6416** have become isolated in this fashion.\n\nIt is assumed that PoI-5242, in serving as O5-6 and maintaining externally-observable trans-temporal autosynchronization, is generally aware of its violations of the 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement and promotes universal isolation in order to avoid RCT-Δt's containment attempts. The results of further instruction, or any other causal progression, of any such timeline is indeterminate. --Any intelligently-designed data communicated by **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** is likely generated by another instance of PoI-5242 in a timeline which has been rendered unobservable, although such a hypothesis is non-falsifiable.--\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n= __**ADDENDUM 6416/I:**__ Project Proposal\n\nDuring the 2024 inspection of PoI-5242 Iteration-Prime's puzzle cubes, it was discovered that one **##green|ELEMENT##** had become an instance of **##green|SCP-6416-CUBE##** in spite of RCT-Δt Iteration Prime's efforts to prevent the conditions of its manifestation. Said instance was confiscated without explanation, and remains under investigation within the Oblique Possibility Wing.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]RCT-Δt's Oblique Possibility Wing is chronologically synchronized with all other instances of itself, thereby heavily restricting the range of likely outcomes of any given structure contained within it.

PoI-5242). Iterations of this individual use SCP-6416 as a parachronological immortality token and communications mechanism, abusing its properties to gain maximum authority within the Foundation (or similar entity) and isolate their respective timeline from any external to **TP-6416**. It is believed that these iterations are cooperating to intentionally endanger the chronological metastability of their respective causal branches.\n\n**PROPOSAL:** Enlist Dr. M'Doctorat in the creation of a communications analysis matrix similar to those observed thoughout **TP-6416**, as they are most likely to succeed in replicating their own variants' designs. Utilize said matrix in conjunction with [*/scp-3955 CAOCIT][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Cyclical Analysis Over Countably-Infinite Time[[/span]] systems to generate and decode the sum of communications sent via SCP-6416 over the phenomenon's duration.

In consultation with Project Advisor O5-9, it was determined by the Council that Dr. M'Doctorat be scheduled for promotion to Overseer status within one week, as she had already undergone much of the necessary training for the O5-6 (Operator) position.
