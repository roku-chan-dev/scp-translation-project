Based on the maintenance gripe sheet lists you might find online or shared in an email from your uncle. Enjoy some dry humor and snarky responses!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\nFoundation personnel submit maintenance reports, also known as \"gripe forms\", to inform level 2 site mechanics about any problems they experience with containment cells and connected facilities. The maintenance crews process the requests, solve the problems, document their repair solutions and file the reports away by once resolved. Submitted problems are marked with a \"P\", while the solutions are marked with an \"S\".\n\n\nCollected Maintenance Reports. Ten per page. Current as of --1/26/2018-- 5/25/2020.\nOverseen by Site-██ Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Open Guide For Submitting Reports\" hide=\"△ Hide Guide For Submitting Reports\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n//Note: Submitted reports are listed ten per page, with newer reports added at the bottom of the last page. Requests come in daily for all manner of odd tasks, often well outside of normal maintenance work. Luckily, inner site maintenance crews can take a joke. \n-Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison//\n\n**Standard format for reports:**\n> **P:** Problem reported.\n> **S:** Solution carried out.\n\n**Example:**\n> **P:** The Foundation is a cold and dangerous place to work in.\n> **S:** It helps to have a sense of humor.\n\n\n**ADVICE:** Keep it simple! Focus on one thing that would require maintenance per report. Think on what kind of strange happenings would be borderline everyday problems at the foundation. Like a vending machine that can dispense lava as easily as coffee. Or a living goo leaving a trail of slime. \n\nIf you want feedback first, comment your idea in the discussion, otherwise, additions are deleted/edited at [[*user toadking07 ]]'s discretion.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n------\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Page 01]]\nSubmitted maintenance reports **(P)** and filed solutions **(S)** from ██/██/████ to ██/██/████.\n\n>1\n> **P:** Security key card reader doesn't work.\n> **S:** Diagram for proper security keycard reader card swiping has been installed.\n\n>2\n> **P:** Smells like there might be a lot of shit inside containment cell.\n> **S:** Confirmed, there is a lot of shit inside containment cell.\n\n>3 \n> **P:** Containment cell door almost needs oiling.\n> **S:** Containment cell door almost oiled.\n\n>4\n> **P:** Request viewing window on test chamber be made of thicker, non-transparent material.\n> **S:** That's called a wall.\n\n>5\n> **P:** Specimen has damaged toilet bowl in containment cell.\n> **S:** Sturdier model toilet bowl has been installed.\n\n>6\n> **P:** Security key card reader still not working.\n> **S:** That security key card reader is for level 4 clearance or higher. \n> \n> //Just because you guard the thing doesn't mean you get to peek in on it whenever you want. \n> -Head Maintenance Supervisor Jaimison//\n\n>7\n> **P:** Muffled screaming can be heard from within containment cell.\n> **S:** Audio system set up so screaming is no longer muffled.\n\n>8\n> **P:** Specimen uprooted toilet bowl from wall and damaged containment cell.\n> **S:** Plastic litter box installed until specimen learns not to break its things.\n\n>9\n> **P:** Entities keep erasing recordings from surveillance cameras.\n> **S:** Fake security cameras have been installed.\n\n>10\n> **P:** One of the containment cell corners smells like piss.\n> **S:** One of the containment cell corners has been bleached.\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Page 02]]\nSubmitted maintenance reports **(P)** and filed solutions **(S)** from ██/██/████ to ██/██/████.\n\n>11\n> **P:** Almost all computers in observation deck have been fried.\n> **S:** All computers in observation deck have been fried.\n\n>12\n> **P:** Door to containment cell does not seem heavy enough to contain artifact.\n> **S:** Weights have been affixed to cell door.
