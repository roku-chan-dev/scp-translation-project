Excess fluids are to be cleaned as necessary. Consumption of SCP-5057 is strictly forbidden.\n\n--SCP-5057 has been assigned to the GoI-386[[footnote]] Doctor Wondertainment. [[/footnote]] research team.--\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5057 is a humanoid automaton made of polypropylene plastic, roughly resembling a clown. It is sentient and capable of speech, despite lacking the necessary organs to do so. Though it is capable of movement, SCP-5057 is mostly still and only appears to move when necessary. SCP-5057 secretes a continuous amount of ethylene glycol (CH,,2,,OH),,2,,[[footnote]]An odorless, viscous, toxic fluid with a sweet taste typically used in the production of anti-freeze and polyester fibers.[[/footnote]] on its surface, which coats the plastic it is made out of. The entity claims to be fully edible and repeatedly encourages personnel who interact with it to consume it.\n\n**Addendum 5057.01:** Attached Document\n\nThe following note was attached to SCP-5057 at the time of discovery.\n\n> Hi, kids!

It's not a Wondertainment product and it's taking away from my containment budget. I assigned one of my Junior Researchers to talk to it and keep it busy for the time being, but I need it reevaluated soon. Please respond ASAP. \n\n----\n\nDr. J.

Please go ahead. \n> \n> **Rex:** Actually, I'm just here to talk.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I insist. Please be eating me!\n> \n> **Rex:** No, but that's actually part of what I'm here to talk to you about.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I can talk. I talk right now!\n> \n> **Rex:** Indeed! Now, let's begin. It says here you are coated in ethylene glycol?\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** It is what gives me my patented delicious flavor. So please, do not stall further and consume my sweet body.\n> \n> **Rex:** Well, that's the thing. It's a toxic substance.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** Impossible. I am delicious, not toxic. These two are not the same. \n> \n> **Rex:** Well, you're just plain wrong on that. And even if you weren't leaking ethylene glycol, you're still a choking hazard because you're made of plastic. \n> \n> **SCP-5057:** You say I am entirely dangerous to eat?\n> \n> **Rex:** Yes. You're like if someone tried making a really shitty Little Mister.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** What is Little Mister? \n> \n> **Rex:** Don't worry about it. But back on the subject, you're toxic to consume, and that's why you're here. Well, that and the fact you talk.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** ... I do not understand. \n> \n> **Rex:** We'll go over this again. You are made of plastic and ethylene glycol. You're toxic. \n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I do not understand still.\n> \n> **Rex:** Come on, you can talk. Surely you can think, can't you?\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I... I can think. \n> \n> **Rex:** That's the spirit.\n> \n> //[There is a fifteen second silence.]//\n> \n> **Rex:** Anything?\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** I must have more time.\n> \n> **Rex:** I'll leave you to it then.

All we can say for sure is that you're here now because of them.\n> \n> **SCP-5057:** But I am toxic.\n> \n> **Rex:** You sure are.
