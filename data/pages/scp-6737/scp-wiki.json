All abnormalities between flight manifest at time of take-off and at time of landing are to be investigated for the presence of SCP-6737-A. Upon acquisition of SCP-6737-A, MTF Tau-14 will bring subject to Anthropoid Site-48 for assessment. By Order of the Ethics Committee, eligibility for Reintegration Protocol is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; See **Reintegration Protocol #6737** for further details.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6737 is a recurring anomaly affecting flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AMS). Within a weekly 24-hour timeframe, a varying number[[footnote]]As of last quarter, average has plateaued at 19 instances per event.[[/footnote]] of individuals (designated SCP-6737-A) will appear within AMS or onboard any number of wide-body aircraft (designated SCP-6737-B) inbound to the airport. Each instance of SCP-6737-A possesses a simulacrum of the identity of an individual who has gone missing and is presumed dead prior to manifestation. SCP-6737-B typically either departs from or has a layover at the international airport nearest to SCP-6737-A's last known whereabouts or the potential location of their remains.\n\nSCP-6737-A subjects do not recall the immediate circumstances of their disappearance and react with unease when informed of traumatic experiences. Instances of SCP-6737-A display intricate false memories which create the belief of having lived a normal life leading up to the decision to board SCP-6737-B. This belief may be superficially supported by personal effects manifested with SCP-6737-A.\n\n**Addendum- Discovery:** The first three SCP-6737-A instances manifested on 02/05/2014.\n\n* American Airlines 2610 departed from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KVG) at 06:40 EST, arriving at AMS at 12:20 CET. SCP-6737-A-001 identified as Lee Ellison, age 18 at time of acquisition. SCP-6737-A-001 was the subject of a missing persons investigation since 19/02/2009, declared a homicide 03/04/2009. Murray Souza would be convicted of her murder and two others in the Cincinnati area; although blood evidence was crucial in the trial, Ellison's remains were never located. SCP-6737-A-001 sent the following text messages to the mother of Ellison:\n\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]just landed mom[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]    [[=image scp-6737-a-1.jpg]]     [[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"green\"]] who is this???[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]lee lol[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]brb i gotta look for jenny. probably at a bar. you know they let us drink here?? and you can't stop us lol[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"green\"]] whoever the fck u are this isnt funny. fck you[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]calm tf down it's just a drink. are you alright?[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"green\"]] sick bstard impersonating my dead child. do i know u? havent seen jenny in years bitch[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]....[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]are you the one drinking? call me.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n//<SCP-6737-A-001 has a correspondence with the mother over video call, prompting her to alert media and authorities.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n* At 18:30 CET, KLM 838 arrived from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) carrying SCP-6737-A-002, identified as Min Jiang, age 38.

Subject allegedly ceased contact with her parents in Suzhou, China due to an interpersonal dispute, and abandoned her apartment intact, her family never receiving correspondence until after appearance at AMS.\n\n* At 19:10 CET, Aeromexico 553 arrived after layover at Cancun International Airport (CUN). SCP-6737-A-003 identified as Roman da Silva, age 27, a Brazilian national who went missing on 05/06/2013 during a vacation trip to Mexico. During a recreational scuba diving excursion in the Gulf of Mexico, subject was separated from his diving group and never found.

I thank the Committee for their expedience in this matter. I believe the ethical violations I will uncover for the Committee are grave, and it would be an unconscionable blemish on my service to the Foundation to let it continue without remark.\n\n**E-2:** State for the record your qualifications and a description of your research assignment.\n\n**Researcher Osman:** Researcher Osman, Criminalistics, 14 years experience at the Foundation in forensic profiling.\n\n//<**14:01** Researcher Osman gives a truncated summary of anomaly, activity relevant to containment, and his induction into research team.>//\n\n**Researcher Osman:** ... I think by the third time someone showed up at A-M-S who's already been on a missing persons case we were interested in, that's when they started to listen to me. I insisted that three days wasn't enough to properly vet these people--\n\n**E-7:** Researcher, are these people? Some of these subjects certainly died. Will you provide evidence that whatever shows up at A-M-S are not simulacra of the deceased?\n\n**Researcher Osman:** Yes, I will. I insisted we needed more time to vet the subjects. That we could lose so much insight to our cold cases by shipping them off to sites unknown less than a week after intake. That we already had the space in Wing D. I successfully campaigned for a few to have their sentences suspended, temporarily. But it was always about the costs of living space, of food and services, that we couldn't keep them for long. In the back of my mind, the numbers didn't parse. The cost of amnestics, the turnover rate on our facilities. Didn't add up.\n\n//<**14:14** Researcher Osman provides a log of instances to the recordkeeper.>//\n\n**Researcher Osman:** Last week, I learned that a majority of subjects labeled 6-7-3-7-A aren't even being taken to Site-48. They get shipped off to black sites, redacted or labeled as auxiliary sites. To my knowledge, these sites do not officially exist. I asked Senior Researcher ████████ about this. He brushed it off as standard protocol. Said it's been done this way for ten months, said that we're overcapacity. He's since dismissed me from all ongoing research projects. But I can assure you, those numbers on the record that say, for example, seventy instances this week, ninety the next week, I can testify that only a small fraction of those instances were ever seen by the S-C-P-6-7-3-7 Research Team.\n \n**Researcher Osman:** I've used my clearance to go through the logs while I still can. I've collected standouts for you.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n**//<Intake Log 6737.2953>//**\n\n||17/04/2016 || Galina Perikoc, Age 43; A-2953 || Eurowings 2977 (ZAG)||\n\n//**Foreword:** Subject Identified at AMS taxiway 01:12.

I speak enough Croatian to know that this woman wasn't Galina Perikoc. She's Croatian, blonde, brown eyes, in her forties, like Galina Perikoc. The passport upon intake said Galina Perikoc. But she's not Galina Perikoc.\n\n//<**14:17** Research Osman produces a Europol notification for missing Croatian woman Julja Emera, dated 17/04/2016.>//\n\n**Researcher Osman:** I contend that the woman identified as A-2-9-5-3 was never Galina Perikoc, and she wasn't missing until we got involved. She was Julja Emera.

A-2-8-9-6, Nikosa Adoyev, not found anywhere close to A-M-S. A-4-1-4-7, Ingard Boyeson, a complete fabrication. Job security for ████████ and ██████ meant sweeping in more subjects for their scheme. All human lives, subjects of greater forces, shipped and sold across our facilities.\n\n**E-12:** Researcher Osman, what estimation of these instances do you contend are false imprisonments?\n\n**Researcher Osman:** The real anomalies are still coming in on schedule. Maybe even at an accelerated rate. I've spoke to them. But if the researcher team never sees most of the inductees, then what facts can I go on? The itineraries of the victims leads me to believe the operation runs around the clock.\n\n**E-9:** I don't doubt your sample, Researcher, but we'll make that assessment after our own audit.\n\n**Researcher Osman:** Beyond that, I believe there are further examples of egregiously misdirecting the research team.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n**//<Research Log 6737.314.3>//**\n\n|| 12/01/2015 || Frédéric Mercado, Age 32; A-314|| Iberia 3341 (RAK)||\n**Personnel Present:** Dr. ████████, Senior Researcher ███████████\n**Prior:** Subject was administered Class-Z mnestics and interviewed.
