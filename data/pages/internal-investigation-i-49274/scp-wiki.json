Internal Investigator James Loope added his opinion on the murder:\n\n> I agree that Amakusa's death is murder. The Factory has many rivals, seeking to liquidate this lovely Factory like old Supes burning some poor soul's noggin with his laser eyes. This murder is a clear attempt to ruin the Factory's good work in Western Kyushu.

Everyone in the Factory are equals with specialised tasks. \n> \n> But the investigation must start from somewhere, and the employee who was the first to have identified the murder victim needs to be interrogated.

In fact, I have been visiting Lesser Foreman Amakusa's quarters for the past week or so. He seems to be looking out at the window all the time. Can't imagine why.

After which, Yamada willingly entered the Central Furnace in order to have his raw materials processed to fuel the Central Furnace. Employees have commented on Yamada's declaration.\n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> I wish we had kept him around as a fellow employee instead, but I suppose he needs judgment in this specific case. At least he is willing to contribute to the Factory, despite the slight errors he made.
