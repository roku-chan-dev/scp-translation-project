The entire description? ||\n|| C-**2349**:|| Yeah, and the containment procedures sound like total nonsense. Apparently it’s buried inside 2 boxes under this site? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Huh, that is weird. Also, grammar. You forgot a comma. ||\n|| C-**2349**: || God damn it Ryan I’m serious, if this is user error you know what could happen. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Fine, fine. What’s the scip number. ||\n|| C-**2349**:|| 6235 ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Ok loading it now. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Uuh, Casey? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || What? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || When you said the description was missing, what did you mean? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || It was blank. Why? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Like, entirely blank? No text at all? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Yeah? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Have you refreshed the page since you started messaging me? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || No, why? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || What the fuck. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || I know right? ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Conversation 2:\" hide=\"- Conversation 2:\"]]\n\n|| C-**9432**: || Hey Nick, we have a problem. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || Watching your grammar for once Ryan? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Ha, this is serious. We think there’s a network breach. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || …Nick? ||\n|| C-**1215**: || What did you do this time? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Ok that’s… deserved honestly but I didn’t do anything, I swear! There’s a scip, SCP-6235 and it’s auto-updating with chat-logs from the internal foundation intranet. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || Ryan if this is some kind of elaborate joke, you’re in deep trouble. I’ve been lenient with you before but this is way beyond out of line. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || You think I don’t know that? How would I even do this, I don’t have the clearance to edit files, never mind create them and as far as I can tell this file was created today. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || Fair point. Have you spoken with anyone else about this? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Only Casey, but she’s the one who told me as you can see above so I don’t think that counts. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || No-one else? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Nope. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || Ok, I’m letting my supervisor know about this. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || //Your// supervisor? Jeez. ||\n|| C-**1215**: || Shut up Ryan. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Conversation 3:\" hide=\"- Conversation 3:\"]]\n\n|| B-**5443**: || Ok, but are you seriously sure? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Yeah, it has to be some kind of hostile actor. ||\n|| B-**5443**: || It… could just be an anomaly. We do literally work for the SCP Foundation Morris. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Yeah, but what are the odds of an anomaly directly affecting a file? ||\n|| B-**5443**: || Decently high. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Fair. Still, Occam’s Razor II applies. Don’t ascribe to anomalies what can easily be explained by malice. ||\n|| B-**5443**: || Fair. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || I mean if you want to refresh your memory of my argument, I’m sure the article has a copy by now. ||\n|| B-**5443**: || Uh, it hasn’t actually. It has this conversation but no trace of Nick’s call to me or my call to you. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || …interesting. Call me. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Now. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Conversation 4:\" hide=\"- Conversation 4:\"]]\n\n|| C-**2349**: || I just tried to edit its containment procedures. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || what? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || I just tried to edit its containment procedures. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || you can edit files? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Well yeah, I’m a researcher. ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Or, at least I normally can. It was instantly edited back. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || k first of all it is news to me that researchers can just edit the files. do you have any idea how many times I’ve had to go get a pass-key or something from nick to make a minor fix? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Yes, Ryan, I know. And don’t pretend you’re actually surprised by this, you go on that rant every time it comes up. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || fine fine. anyway second; thats weird. ||\n|| C-**2349**: || That’s it? Weird? ||\n|| C-**9432**: || i mean what do you want me to say, someone is editing the files to undo any changes to it. it’s weird. ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Someone, or something. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || what? ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Well, this could easily be an anomaly. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || ok fine yeah, someone or something.||\n|| C-**2349**: || It's not an unreasonable guess Ryan. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || sure ||\n|| C-**2349**: || Oh also, your grammar has gotten worse again. ||\n|| C-**9432**: || Seriously, bite me Casey. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Conversation 5:\" hide=\"- Conversation 5:\"]]\n\n|| B-**3349**: || Hello. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Don’t pretend that you can’t respond. Someone or something is editing this document, and we’ve locked literally every security clearance out of it. Meaning that whatever’s editing the file, is within the file. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Or maybe you can’t respond. Maybe you aren’t intelligent after all. Just let me add an addendum to the containment procedures. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || It will just be to prevent people discussing you. We can’t have you continually expanding or your file might start over-writing data associated with other files. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || We know which server you’re in and we can just delete you. ||\n\n**Addendum 2:** If the file for SCP-6235 is deleted/altered without permission, or if anything is done to interrupt SCP-6235, the contents of the smaller Hollow Containment Cube will detonate.\n\n|| B-**3349**: || This file appeared yesterday; we haven’t actually put the containment procedures into effect. ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Unless… they already are? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Are… Are you holding Site-55 hostage? ||\n\n**Addendum 3:** Yes.\n\n|| B-**3349**: || Wouldn’t detonating the Hollow Containment Cube constitute suicide? ||\n\n**Addendum 4:** The Hollow Containment Cube contains SCP-6235. SCP-6235 cannot edit this file.\n\n|| B-**3349**: || Then… what are you? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Hello? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Oh. ||\n\n**Addendum 5:** SCP-6235's file will be free to edit from 13:00 to 13:01 on 5th of May 2005.\n\n|| B-**3349**: || Wait, but it’s already almost 1pm, couldn’t you give me more notice? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Hello?? ||\n|| B-**3349**: || Shit. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 6:\" hide=\"- Addendum 6:\"]]\nAs long as the edict lain out in the updated containment procedures is followed, no harm will come to Site-55. Instances of SCP-6235 can be manifested at will 5 metres below ground anywhere on Earth.\n\nDo not bother me.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6234]]] | SCP-6235 | [[[SCP-6236]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
