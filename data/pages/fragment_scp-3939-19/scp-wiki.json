A researcher is to be assigned to classify it as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** None yet available.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYou pack your things, leave the Site, head to the car park, drive out of the gate and make your way home. Traffic is very light — after all, it's still pretty early in the morning and rush hour is long gone — so you get home in a very timely manner.\n\nYou sit down in your lounge with a cup of coffee and a book. It's a pretty warm day, and the coffee fumes are intoxicating. You fall asleep before you've even taken a sip.\n\nBy the time you wake up, the coffee is cold and the book is on the floor several metres away from the sofa. You check the time — hours have passed. You'll have to be very careful in repairing your sleep schedule.\n\nIn the evening, you head to bed when you normally would. It takes you much longer to fall asleep than it normally would — no doubt due to your accidental nap.\n\nYou wake up in the morning like the worst hangover you've ever had. Groggy, dead, can't think. You estimate you've managed to get about an hour of sleep. You check the time and see that you must be wrong — you've overslept by two hours.\n\nYour insides go cold. You need to get to work, now. You get dressed and out of your house as fast as you can, inwardly berating yourself for your stupidity. Traffic is light again on the way there — you're going to work at about the same time you left yesterday. You drive through the security checkpoint, get let in, park your car, and head to your office.\n\nBefore you even get there, Sally Hawthorne bumps into you in the corridor.\n\n\"Dr. ████████.\" she says. You continue walking towards your office, and she falls into step alongside you.\n\n\"Sally.\" you reply. \"Are you trying to get in my way?\"\n\n\"No-no, sir, of course not. I mean, there was something I was wanting to ask. But I can see you're busy.\"\n\n\"Hit me.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Dr. Rodriguez today?\"\n\nYou both arrive at your office.\n\n\"Carlos?\" You think back, but your mind is foggy and clouded. It takes you a few seconds to remember who he is, or what relation he has to you. \"No, I've actually not seen him at all. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"He was supposed to be here early this morning.\" She steps into your office after you, and pulls the door shut behind her. \"We had some work that needs doing. I've not been able to contact him at all.\"\n\n\"I've not heard from him, no.\" you reply, a little absentmindedly. Your attention has already moved away from her and into the space above her head.\n\n\"Okay. Thank you, doc... ████.\" Sally says, as she backs out of your office and into the corridor, closing the door behind her.\n\nYou take a seat at your desk, and wonder what she needed to meet with him for. It takes you a few minutes to remember what you're supposed to be doing today. You've got to take a closer look at SCP-3939 to see if you can work out what's actually anomalous about it. Your head sinks into your hands as the crushing thought of the sheer amount of work you've got to do towers over you.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/42 Take a closer look at the picture attached to the article.]\n\n[/scp-3939/offset/50 Check your messages.]\n\n[/scp-3939/offset/37 This can still wait until tomorrow.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
