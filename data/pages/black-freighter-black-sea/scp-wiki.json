The others, mostly people from school that she has fallen in with by chance, are huddled around a cluster of plastic candles beneath the docks, but she breaks off silently and makes her way along the shore until the artificial orange glow and the shapes against it are out of sight. She has a need to be alone that she cannot place.\n\nShe comes to a place where the light of the waxing crescent hits the sea just so, sits with her back to the docks and their buildings, and watches the waves lap on the sand. The water splashes her toes every so often; a plane passes silently overhead. In the distance, a lone freighter glides westward to ports unknown.\n\nThe moon scuttles behind a cloud, leaving her with nothing but sound: the sea sloshing in steady rhythm on the shore, a lone insect buzzing somewhere to her right, the jeers and hollers of the others growing distant. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, feels the wet air fill her nostrils, opens her eyes as she exhales, lays on her stomach, gazes into the black water, thinks that she can make out something staring back at her from the deep, leans forward in an effort to get a closer look, stands up, slips out of her sandals, rolls her pant legs up to her knees, wades into the water, pays no mind to the sound falling away from her, keeps her eyes fixed on a shape beneath the waves that becomes clearer to her by the second, stretches her arms out to it, feels an alien and familiar sensation creeping up her back, and snaps back to awareness when the moon emerges and throws its light on the surface once again. The freighter is out of her sight.\n\nShe glances around her in confusion, looks into the sea, sees nothing, turns back to the shore, and stumbles back to dry land as quickly as she can manage. She contemplates going back to find the others, but she decides to head straight home instead after glancing once more at the water. Her trek along the shore has taken her to a part of town that she is unfamiliar with, but she eventually finds a street name that she recognizes, jogs back to the house, and slides through the front door without waking up her parents.\n\nShe is exhausted, but the night's events keep her up; sleep comes to her in frenetic bursts of concepts and colors. She dreams that she is trudging through a vast desert, and the sun is always bearing down on the back of her neck; she dreams that a monster with gaping maws for eyes has crawled out of a crack in the crust of the earth to swallow her whole; she dreams that she is trapped in her room, and the roof is crashing down on top of her; she dreams that she is floating through a dark tunnel with pale hands grasping at her from all directions; she dreams that the world has become so quiet that she can hear the electricity running up and down her nerves. She dreams of the deep.\n----\nAmanda is thirty-five years old when she feels the pull of the deep for the final time.\n\nIt is July, and she is on temporary leave from the Foundation, where she studies anomalous ocean life, to visit her family back home after the death of one of her uncles. It is three days after the funeral and two days before she is scheduled to return to work when she decides to take a walk along the beach in the early hours of the morning. She has spent the week visiting an endless procession of dimly-lit homes and consoling an endless procession of grieving relatives who knew old Uncle Bobby far better than she did; she must be alone, if only for a little while.\n\nThe moon is new, and darkness hangs over the surface of the water. The globular lights on the dock, which she has gathered were installed by the city last summer for safety, are too dim to illuminate much of the beach; she keeps between the edge of their off-white glow and the edge of the sea. She eventually comes upon a place that feels right, and she sits with her back to the spheres. The waves stop just short of her feet as they lap on the shore.\n\nThe sounds of the beach gradually recede, and she feels the familiar pull begin to take hold, the same pull that she felt on this beach so many years ago, the same pull that she felt every time she passed by the sea in the months and years that followed, the same pull that she could never escape when she went out to sea with her parents and their friends, the same pull that she fought against every time she had to go out to the beach for field work in college, the same pull that she swore she could feel somewhere in the back of her mind when she saw projected images of the sea during conferences. She sees a shape beginning to form in the deep, and the urge to gaze overpowers her.\n\nShe knows what she must do. She stands up, slips out of her shoes and socks, rolls her pant legs up to her knees, looks out at the sea of pitch before her and the thing waiting for her underneath, closes her eyes, steels herself, and opens her eyes with newfound resolve. She strides into the water, pauses when she feels it reach past her knees and seep into her pants, glances up at the sky, looks down at the shape growing in clarity beneath the waves, feels its sensation wash over her like the waves, takes a deep breath, dives headfirst into the water, powers through the chill that pierces her skin, swims into the deep, keeps her gaze fixed on the shape that is reaching out to meet her, beholds its many limbs and its one shimmering eye, reaches out with a trembling hand, and watches it dissolve into the black. Suddenly aware of how long she has spent in the water, she surfaces as quickly as she can.\n\nShe gasps for air as she breaks the even surface of the water. As soon as she can make out the direction the shore is in, she begins pushing towards it with everything she has. She dreads that she has gone too far out, that the current will sweep her away from land and toward oblivion, but little by little, the beach draws closer. She uses the last of her energy to heave herself onto the sand and lies there on her side for some time, breathing near-silently. She eventually rises, her clothes completely soaked through, and looks back at the sea. The shape is nowhere to be seen; she no longer feels the pull, and the water seems to shine despite the lack of moonlight. She picks up her sandals and sets off for home.\n\nWhen she gets to sleep, she dreams of a freighter on the sea, its black frame cutting through deep blue water.",
