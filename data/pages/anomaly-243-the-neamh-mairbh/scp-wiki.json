[!-- Always start with AO- --]\n\n**Threat:** Enraged. [!-- None, Benign, Irascible, Enraged --]\n\n**Classifications:** Hominid, Nocturnal, Infective, Thaumaturgic, Transvection, Regenerative. [!-- Brief descriptions of anomaly --]\n\n**Stored:** //Anomaly remains unchecked.//[!-- Where is the anomaly kept or located --]\n\n**Identifiers:** Anomaly encompasses an entire theurgical augmented group of hominids native to Ireland. Near-human in appearance, the creatures share much of their physiology with those of the //[[[nx-03|Tuatha Dé Danann]]]//, with the exception of their teeth, which are jagged, and eyes, of which the sclera is of a black hue round the edges of the iris. Observation has determined their intelligence and sapience to be near, if not identical, to that of a human.[!-- How does the anomaly usually look --]\n\n**Abnormality:** The creatures possess a number of unusual qualities, both in their behaviour and biology. Their most notable quality is their regenerative capabilities, which grant them suspended age and recovery of almost all forms of physical damage, including conditions which would normally be deemed unrecoverable such as decapitation or severe mutilation. This quality also appears to dull their sense of pain and grant them an enhanced physique.\n\nThere are, however, exceptions. Wounds inflicted through weapons heavy in iron or silver do not recover as quickly. Sunlight also appears to impede their regenerative capabilities, resulting in their flesh quickly becoming rigid, blistered and gangrenous. Even with these exceptions, the creatures require continuous, prolonged exposure before they would be considered impossible for them to resurrect.\n\nInternally, the creatures possess a near-identical biology to those of humans and //Tuatha//. However, their blood is notably darker in hue and possess a high viscosity, closer to that of oil. The liquid is dilatant, thickening when strain is applied, giving them a sufficient defence against blunt or projectile damage. It also is much richer in proteins and testosterone, appearing to induce temporary hypertrophy when introduced to muscular or skeletal tissue. In addition, as well as having rather jagged teeth, the creatures possess twice the number of canines as an ordinary human. One set, found near the incisors, are especially jagged and large. The other set, found near the premolars, are thinner. The roots of these thin canines are not a not attached to the jaws, but rather to the muscles and ligament of the other thicker canines. When the creature's mouth encases an object, the additional ligaments will react, causing the thin canines to deploy, sinking deep into the objects structure. \n\nThe creatures also possess an unusual diet, as they do not require human food to survive. Rather, the creatures are hematophagous, consuming blood, primarily from other hominids. The death of the prey is not necessary, although the creatures typically do not leave their prey in a recoverable condition. However, it is noted that the nourishment the creatures gain doesn't just come from the blood itself but also through ritualistic theurgy. In a way, the act of hunting, harvesting, murder or battle is as nourishing as the consumption of blood, with both acting as a source of sustenance.\n\nThe creatures are believed to be sterile, although this claim has yet to be confirmed by observation. Whilst the creatures haven't been observed breeding, they are capable of performing a theurgic, xenogenesis metamorphosis, in which they endow their anomaly qualities into another individual. How this is achieved is not known and requires further research. As of this publication, only individuals of the //Tuatha// have been successful victims of this metamorphosis. It is unknown if this is due to some theurgic requirement or tradition on the creatures' part. It is also unknown whether the anomalous capabilities individual possessed prior to metamorphosis is retained when the transformation is complete.\n[!-- How does the anomaly usually behave and what makes this unusual --]\n\n**History:** Whilst the creatures' existence has only managed to live in folktales and legends for the human population of Ireland, those of the //Tuatha// have an extensive history with them //(as detailed in the accompanying piece by Lord Blackwood's conference with Hy-Brasil's reigning monarch, Nuada Airgetlám VII)//. The first case of the creatures' existence registered by Her Majesty's Foundation was during an investigation into a series of murders in Manchester. All the victims, as well as having been heavily beaten, had bite marks over their bodies and had undergone moderate exsanguination. The criminal, who'd arrived in England under the guise of a longshoremen named //Paule Byrne//, was eventually traced to a brothel where theurgists were, after he refused to be detained, exterminate him.[!-- How did the anomaly come under the control of HMFSCP --]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 243 (A) :** Lord Blackwood's envoy to Hy-Brasil\n\nA report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on the culture and history of //\"Hy-Brasil\"// and its inhibitors, the //\"Tuatha Dé Danann\"//. The report's writer, Lord Theodore Blackwood, was assisting Her Majesty's Foundation in establishing relations and possible intervention policies with the kingdom's rulers and governors. Information believed to be regarding AO-243 was noted in Blackwood's report.\n-----\n\n##navy|//After my stroll with the King, I was taken to the banqueting hall, where I was presented with the most delicious meal: fine claret, golden fish and sweet, silver apples. The King was delighted with my enjoyment, remarking how it pained him how closed his kingdom was to the world outside and how wonderful it was to have it appreciated.//##\n\n##navy|//Soon, we spoke of the land's history and I learnt of the people's brutal strife for survival. As he spoke, I saw a great sadness within the King. A regret, mixed with a longing and a weariness. In an attempt to lighten his heart, I asked him of his mages and builders, remarking how beautiful and ingenious his [[[SCP-7010|wards]]] were. My efforts worked and the King talked in great detail of his people's skills with magic and theurgy, allowing them to bend the elements and fates with little work.//##\n\n##navy|//However, when I asked about their military, the King remained silent for a moment, perturbed. Knowing I had once again touched on a subject of great sensitivity, I apologised. The King, however, raised a hand and sighed, saying it would be better to know rather than hide the story in shame. With that, we left the hall and I was taken to the chambers beneath the palace.//##\n\n##navy|//In the touch light, I saw the chamber lined with tapestries. All depicting various events. Battles, coronations, funerals, weddings and tragedies. I saw a tapestry of Nuada Airgetlám I, being crowned the first king to the cheers of thousands. Another tapestry showed Lugh III and Mal I in battle, waring against [[[SCP-6916|Arawn ap Carnonos]]] and his army of ghosts and giants. And one, newer than the others, depicted a [[[lte-0851-cetus|beast]]] rising from the sea, flames filling the skies.//##\n\n##navy|//The King woke me from my trace and pointed to a tapestry. In its cloth, I saw an image of horror. A field lined with bodies and blood. In the centre, two men fought, one of whom I recognised as the husband of Sadhbh II, Fionn, holding a sword with a wooden hilt. The other man was dwarfed and had hair of wild cinnabar, teeth as sharp as daggers and eyes filled with malice. Around them, in a frenzy of blood and fury, men and women were screaming and laughing. All shared the dwarf's abhorrent glare and maw. And in the sky, cutting through the dark, crimson clouds, stood a woman all in [[[SCP-179|black]]], showering Fionn in golden light.//##\n\n##navy|//As I took in the image, the King told me the dwarf's tale. With the fall of the [[[nx-02|Mabyn]]], the kingdom of the Tuatha, which had once spanned the highlands of Scotland as well as Ireland, was now vulnerable to the coming threats from the east. As they had depleted so much of their magic and weaponry from their war with Mabyn, the monarchy elected to abandon the highlands and retreated to Ireland.//##\n\n##navy|//As the years passed, Great Britain was invaded and colonised by several forces, but Ireland remained untouched and the Tuatha lived in quiet. Whilst many of the monarchy's people supported their ruler's choice, some remained bitter and vengeful. This bitterness was at its most potent within the Fianna, the theurgic warriors of the Tuatha. They had come to see their people as weak and lacking pride, with their leader, the dwarf knight, Abhartach, leading this shame.//##\n\n##navy|//Wishing to restore their honour, Abhartach eventually asked his Queen, Sadhbh, to lead a crusade against the foreign rulers of Britain and claim back their land. The Queen refused, concerned only for the safety of her people. Enraged, Abhartach and his men sought to overthrow the monarchy and searched for ways to equal their power. Eventually, he sought the wisdom of the Aos Sí, cruel beings with old magic and wings like glass. The Aos Sí agreed to grant Abhartach's boon, on the condition he would be an ally to them if they ever needed him. Reluctantly, Abhartach agreed.//##\n\n##navy|//Using their power, the Aos Sí granted Abhartach and his men's boon in the form of a new life. One free from the touches of death or time and rich in health and strength. They became the Neamh-Mairbh, men beyond death. But this boon would require blood to complete the promise. The blood of an enemy. Abhartach, now blinded by the power of his new shape and fuelled by his disgust for foreigners, choose a visiting Gaul priestess. One night, he and his men ambushed the priestess in her quarters, ripped her throat out and drank her blood, completing their contract with the Aos Sí.//##\n\n##navy|//With his army of immortals, Abhartach lead the Neamh-Mairbh in a nocturnal ambush, attacking his former home and people. In the bloodbath, the army claimed many lives, including their former Queen. Her husband tried in vain to fight the army, but as they were fuelled by magic, only iron or silver would harm the immortals, a substance no Tuatha could not touch. Try as he might, Fionn and his people could not win.//##\n\n##navy|//Then, as the dawn broke, a miracle occurred. As the clouds parted, the immortals began to scream in pain in the light of the Sun, their flesh decaying and blistering. For in his pride and greed, Abhartach had made one mistake. The priestess he and his army had killed had not been a follower of a earthly faith. She was a follower of the [[[second-hytoth-hub|Seven]]] and with her death, was granted apotheosis, becoming one with the heavens and Sun. With her assent, she banished Abhartach and his army form the light of the heavens, bringing them agony and weakness if they ever entered it.//##\n\n##navy|//With the heavens now on his side, Fionn and his men destroyed many of the Neamh-Mairbh and eventually won the battle. Victorious but vulnerable, Fionn wished to punish his wife's and people's killers with a fate worse than death. So his theurgists had Abhartach and his remaining army bound in chains of silver and sealed in caves in the north, trapping them in eternal pain. But even as the caves were closed, Abhartach vowed he would return to claim his right, one day. One day, the Neamh-Mairbh would return.//##\n\n##navy|//As he finished the tale, I asked the King if Abhartach ever fulfilled his promise. He claimed he did not know as years later, his people fled once again, rebuilding Hy-Brasil as their last home. For now, there was only tales and rumours of his return and he did not give in to fantasies easily. I thanked him for telling me his people's tale and proposed we return to the palace to continue our journey. Agreeing, we left the chambers and returned to the light of day.//##\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 243 (B) :** Suspect 230\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/George_chapman_illo.jpg |caption=Suspect 230, Lysander Agnew|width=280px]]\n**Subjects Name:** Lysander Ruthven Agnew\n\n**Nationality:** Irish\n\n**Occupation:** Trade Route manager at //Layton & Sons[[footnote]] A shipbuilding and shipping company based in Cork, Ireland. Specialised in Canadian Arctic, Atlantic and North Sea shipping routes. [[/footnote]]//\n\n**Perpetration:** After the successful disposal of an AO-243 entity, Her Majesty's Foundation began an investigation into his travels prior to arriving in Manchester. It was eventually discovered that the entity calling himself //Paule Byrne// had made several journeys with the shipping company //Layton & Sons//. When the company's passenger manifest was investigated further, it was found that 6 other individuals had also used the name, in various locations across Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, suggesting that the name //Paule Byrne// was a pseudonym used by multiple people.\n\nThe case's head investigator, Inspector Henry, later learnt through a contact in the American Secure Containment Initiative that the name was linked to a series of murders and kidnappings that had occurred in the Northeast United States and Eastern Canada. Furthermore, when the passenger manifests were compared with the cargo documentation, Henry found that in a majority of the //Paule Byrne// returning journeys, additional cargo had been assigned to them, all to be delivered to Cork, Ireland.\n\nWhen Henry contacted //Layton & Sons//, their archivists revealed that all the shipments had been approved by one of the company trade route managers, //Lysander Ruthven Agnew// and the cargo had supposedly contained medical supplies and biochemical materials, though no one could confirm this was the case. When Her Majesty's Foundation attempted to trace //Lysander Ruthven Agnew//, they found that several documents had been destroyed or lost. Further interviews with several //Layton & Sons// employees found that they possessed no information regarding their manager's whereabouts or associates. However, a few were able to provide a description of him, which illustrators were able to work into a sketch. Due to his connections to the inexplicable cargo, //Lysander Ruthven Agnew// has been assigned as a Suspect.\n\nBelieving the illicit trading, destruction of administrative documents and the involvement of AO-243 implied a criminal syndicate had infiltrated multiple Irish and British establishments, likely involving several AO-243 entities, Inspector Henry was assigned as the head of the AO-243 annulment project.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n**Proposal: Request the right to alert and establish entente with Tuatha in annulling the AO-243 threat.**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nMost esteemed gentlemen of the Operations Council,\n\nI regret to inform you of the death of Intelligence operatives, Jared Mint and Beiye Zhao. Both had been involved in the AO-243 annulment project and had been posted to investigate the financial trail of various 243 front businesses, like //Layton & Sons//. They were recovered yesterday at the //St Micheal's// workhouse in Ullapool, Scotland, having experienced heavy mutilation and exsanguination. Deep bite marks made up a majority of the wounds.\n\nWhilst this is indeed a tragedy, this proposal comes due to the discoveries we made at the workhouse during our recovery. Having been altered of the establishment via a telegram we'd received from Mint, five days prior to his murder, we stormed the workhouse last night after he or Zhao failed to make a further report. Expecting to find a functioning, staffed establishment, my operative and I were surprised to find the building empty. By the state of the rooms and grounds, it would appear that our operatives had inadvertently alerted the anomalies of our investigation and had fled, destroying as much evidence of their activities in the process. However, our initial assumption that the establishment had been abandoned was wrong.\n\nWe found operatives Mint and Beiye in the laundry rooms in the basements of the building. In adjacent rooms, we also found the remains of numerous cadavers and carcasses. Furthermore, we also discovered that the medical wings on the upper floors had been locked, with several inhuman sounds coming within. Upon entry, we discovered seven, imprisoned, near-human entities, heavily malnurished and aggressive. Believed to be AO-243 entities, we exterminated them. However, our accompanying Physician operative later revealed to us that despite matching 243's characteristics, the entities were of human biology, not //Tuatha//.\n\nFurther investigation of the workhouse led us to conclude the following. //St Micheal's// was not merely a feeding ground for the 243's entities, but a laboratory. From what we could gather from the remains of the destroyed records in the medical officer's chambers, it would appear that the anomalies were attempting to enforce a cross-species transmutation of their xenogenesis metamorphosis. From what we witnessed in the medical wings, it would appear they have partially succeeded, with the process now capable of working on basic humans, though not without the loss of sapience and higher reasoning.\n\nNot only have the deaths of two Intelligence operatives resulted in a depletion in manpower, but we have also underestimated the intelligence and governance of 243, specifically their ability to hide within our society for so long and abuse it to help further their cause, whatever that may be. It is for this reason I request that we reach out to the Hy-Brasil monarchy and government and alert them of the return of 243. The Tuatha are more knowledgeable of this anomaly's history and capabilities than us and their assistance in the project would provide substantial intelligence and workforce. Not only that, this would also strengthen our diplomatic relations with them.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\n[[>]]\n+++++ - Nathanial Henry\n++++++ Head Intelligence Operative\n++++++ United Kingdom Branch\n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 60%]]DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE, OFFICIAL USE ONLY.[[/size]]\n-----\n+++ //##navy|Proposal approved.##//\n+++ //- ##navy|Chamberlains 1, 2, 4, and 5.##//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Vampire.jpg\n> **Name:** George Chapman\n> **Author:** newspaper\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_chapman_illo.jpg\n=====\n> **Filename:** HMFSCP2.png\n> **Name:** HMFSCP2\n> **Author:** [[*user olympic-error]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/anomaly-243-the-neamh-mairbh/HMFSCP2.png\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
