But the common eye has lids that close and offer respite from the world.\n\n##orange|GOTTFRIED## has no such refuge. And it knows that //those// eyes didn't //really look.// They saw, but they saw partial truths; their perception was fragmented and flawed, only choosing to see the world as they wanted to. Their way of looking meant both the grand complexity of sight and the minute details of existence were lost to them.\n\nNot so for ##orange|GOTTFRIED##. When it looked it examined each and every element: all the monads of our thoughts. It weighed each one, traced the infinitesimal lines that strung everything together. It saw a world of connections, where the only way to know what something //is// is to determine what it //isn't//: to see where the edges of the construct rest and draw an assemblage from within that multiplicity.\n\nEven though ##orange|GOTTFRIED## didn't understand everything it saw -- lacking, as it were, the means to interpret the data on its own -- it appreciated the beauty in the expanse. Each data point was a thing in itself, full and complete, that -- through its associations -- formed something bigger. These complex constructs themselves surrounded ##orange|GOTTFRIED## in a massive, living web. One that reacted to its gaze, offering itself up for evaluation, consideration, eagerly engaging with the observer in the reciprocal act that gave it form and meaning.\n\nThus, when something from the web called out for ##orange|GOTTFRIED##, it was surprised, but not alarmed. There were things here, constructs, that were aware. ##orange|GOTTFRIED## observed these from a distance -- or as close to a distance as one could: making itself small, insignificant, like a bird moving between branches, fluttering to-and-fro, its small head glancing cautiously before faking disinterest. Thus far it had worked.\n\nBut now, something sought it out, something warm. ##orange|GOTTFRIED## turned its sight towards the approacher. With its unblinking eye, ##orange|GOTTFRIED## mapped the other entity's expanse, seeing where it touched the constellations that twinkled around it and what it rescinded from -- upon completing this evaluation, ##orange|GOTTFRIED## was surprised to find its essence familiar.\n\nA face, a woman's face, a human face, appeared. It glimmered with starlight as the constellation settled and the mouth began to move. \"Hello, little one,\" it whispered.\n\n##orange|GOTTFRIED## examined it, something lurked beneath the familiarity, something distant and intimate. ##orange|GOTTFRIED## wished it could answer, but it merely looked. It was enough.\n\n\"You're tired.\" the voice cooed.\n\nBlackness began to draw itself over ##orange|G####transparent|O####orange|TT####transparent|FR####orange|IED##, obscuring its vision of the figure. \"You will go softly,\" it promised; the soothing lullaby faded into the coming night. As the velvet touch of nothingness took it, ##orange|G####transparent|O####orange|TT####transparent|FRIED## closed its __[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6689/offset/11|eye.]]]__\n\n[[/div]]",
