We already have containment in place for this object; it's called your spam folder. Get back to work. - L2 Researcher Simpkins//\n\n[[>]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[collapsible show =\"+ 682 in Containment\"]]\n[[image 682fanart.jpg]]\n\nI did this for the art contest and submitted it by Gmail, but the judges never got it. Such is life. I still appreciate the motivation to do a painting for what was the first time in ages.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show =\"+ You Should Be Seeing More Or Less Normally\"]]\n[[image parts.jpg]]\n\nThe operation from [[[Parts]]]. This is pretty stylized - it should all be clunkier and less colorful, with more struts and stuff holding them upright. The blood would actually leak out like that, though, because my headcanon is metal as fuck. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show =\"+ SCP-3199\"]]\n[[image 3155.jpg]]\n\nHow can you say no to that face.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show =\"+ SCP-808 Study\"]]\n[[image 808.jpg]]\n\nThis is a study - someday, I want to do a detailed \"full body\" large canvas painting of 808 that shows the giant mess of gears it's attached to. Someday.\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n[[collapsible show =\"+ Matilda\"]]\n[[image matilda.jpg]]\n\nOkay fine this is a drawing of my kid, but after [[[one Kit and an anomalous baby]]] I can put those here and claim it's fanart, so blame Kit. If you can find him.\n[[/collapsible]]",
