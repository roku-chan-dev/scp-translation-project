Any testing involving SCP-5165 must be performed in an area suitably sized for the individual test.\n\n**UPDATE 07/24/2016:** SCP-5165-B is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. It is to be allowed access to any non-hazardous instances of SCP-5165-A, and a limit of one ream of paper every two weeks upon request.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5165 is a ream of printer paper produced by the company Botezatu Hârtie, based in Romania. The anomalous effects of SCP-5165 occur when any amount of SCP-5165 is folded into an origami figure. Once it has been folded, the portion of SCP-5165 will transform into the physical form of the folder's intended creation (henceforth referred to as SCP-5165-A). SCP-5165-A acquires the properties of the object it resembles, and is no longer composed of paper.\n\nIn some cases, however, the instance of SCP-5165-A will take the form of an item that appears to have very specific properties that are unrelated to what the folder intended to create. Many of these items have been dated to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. --There is no apparent relation between these items.-- //(See Addendum 5165.2)//\n\n**Addendum 5165.1:** To determine the true nature of SCP-5165, the following tests were performed.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Experiment Logs\" hide=\"- Hide Experiment Logs\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Experiment Log 5165.EL-01:**\n\n**Subjects:** SCP-5165, D-21957\n\n**Preface:** D-21957 was instructed to fold a paper boat out of an instance of SCP-5165.\n\n-----\n\n**Results:** The instance of SCP-5165 morphed into a full-sized sailboat.

The instance of SCP-5165-A was removed to Area-██ for safer storage. D-85297 was instantly killed by the growth of the object.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Experiment Log 5165.EL-21:**\n\n**Subjects:** SCP-5165, D-16179\n\n**Preface:** D-16179 was instructed to roll an instance of SCP-5165 as though it were a newspaper.\n-----\n\n**Results:** The instance of SCP-5165 morphed into a rolled-up newspaper. When it was unrolled, it revealed several faded headlines and articles from July of 1940. Legible portions of the faded text reveal details of a bombing, listing the names of many casualties. Contrasting the rest of the newspaper, three names are completely intact and are circled in red ink. The names are Theodor Gheorghe, Anamaria Gheorghe, and Silvia Gheorghe.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Experiment Log 5165.EL-23:**\n\n**Subjects:** SCP-5165, D-43586\n\n**Preface:** D-43586 was instructed to fold an instance of SCP-5165 into the shape of a shirt.\n-----\n\n**Results:** The instance of SCP-5165 morphed into an Eastern European school uniform.

May I have your name?\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** Marius Gheorghe. Who are you?\n\n**Moldovan:** That's not important.\n\n//SCP-5165-B nods, then scratches his throat, seemingly feeling for something, then coughs.//\n\n**Moldovan:** Is something the matter?\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** N-no, sir. May I have some water?\n\n//Dr. Moldovan gestures for an assistant to retrieve water.//\n\n**Moldovan:** So, Mr. Gheorghe, does origami or paper hold any importance to you?\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** Yes, sir. I... started folding origami in university, and kept doing it from then.\n\n**Moldovan:** Interesting. I have some objects for you to look at. Do you mind telling me if any of them remind you of something?\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** Of course, sir.\n\n//An assistant hands SCP-5165-B a glass of water.

I, um, used to love playing with it in the lake nearby. The... the knife, I used to carry it with me when I went hunting with my father.\n\n//Dr. Moldovan removes the items and replaces them with the poster and an image of the bomber. SCP-5165-B begins to seem very uncomfortable.//\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** That... poster. They put them all over my town. They said they were our friends. They said we would win the war. I saw that plane fly over, and there was something that came out of it. I don't remember what happened next. All I know is that it was scary.\n\n//Dr. Moldovan removes the items and replaces them with the cigar box and vase.//\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** M-my father used to smoke cigars all the time. He kept that box in case he ever ran out and was unable to get more. I never understood that.\n\n//SCP-5165-B pauses for a moment.//\n\n**Moldovan:** //(calmly)// Please continue.\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** The vase was my mother's favorite. She used to keep very pretty flowers in it. I remember it being clean, though.\n\n**Moldovan:** What happened to your parents?\n\n**SCP-5165-B:** The plane. When I saw that plane and woke up, there was nothing. My parents, my sister, my house, my town. There was nothing. I had to leave.

SCP-5165-B claims to be named Marius Gheorghe. It seems to enjoy origami, and commonly uses it as a means to pass time. SCP-5165-B possesses no anomalous properties.\n\nFurther study reveals that the town that SCP-5165-B originated from was completely destroyed in a Nazi bombing, and the site of the town was eventually used to construct the Botezatu Hârtie Paper Company.\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5164]]] | SCP-5165 | [[[SCP-5166]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
