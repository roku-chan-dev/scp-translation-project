However, Foundation personnel are called upon to monitor the presence of anomalous events related to it within the affected area, and to conceal its effects from the public; all monitoring and screening operations are coordinated by [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#toc10 Site Virtus] and handled by [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/squadre-speciali-mobili#toc11 SIR-I] (\"Aureæ Notitiæ\").\n\n**Description:** SCP-137-IT refers to a particular phenomenon involving certain objects brought into the area matching the administrative boundaries --of the municipality of Rome-- of the special local authority Roma Capitale. When brought into the aforementioned area, said objects risk undergoing an immediate dematerialization process, thus becoming irretrievable. Notably, however, this phenomenon acts on a probabilistic scale: every object at risk has a 0.0001% probability of being affected. These odds apply to all objects which may be used as back supports (e.g. beds, hammocks, sleeping bags, and so on). The percentage rises to 0.001% for all objects meant to be used as seats for multiple people, and to 0.01% when they are meant to be single seats.\n\n**Timeline:** The Italian Branch has been aware of SCP-137-IT since its founding. The exact point in time where it was first discovered is unknown, but it is known that the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#RIDIA Royal Institute of Italian Anomalies] (RIDIA) was aware of it, as well as the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#CCSG Confraternity of Saint George's Knights] (CCSG) and [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#OI Janus' Order] (OI), all groups historically present in Rome and related to the city.\n\nThe Foundation was able to better understand the reach of SCP-137-IT especially thanks to the latter's documentation. Among the most ancient records of the Order mentioning the anomaly, it was learnt how it seems to have originated in the founding myth of Rome, though in a slightly modified version. A letter reporting the above is attached below.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Letter to the SCP Foundation from Janus' Order, 194█\" hide=\"Close file \"]]\n[[div class=\"oi\"]]\n----\n[[=image http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-112-it/oilogo.png width=\"200px\"]]\n[[=]]\n01\nINGIRUMIMUSNOCTE\nETCONSUMIMURIGNI\n[[size smaller]]ΑΩ[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n _\n _\n@@        @@Salutem dicit plurimam[[footnote]]\"Cordial greetings\".[[/footnote]]\n\nWe heeded your request for explanations about what is happening in Rome.\nIt is a great, unsolved mystery, one our sacred Order was never able to fully comprehend, as murky as the waters it lies in are.

The historical validity of what was stated has been proven by several letters and complaints retrieved over the years, both from ancient history and the Middle Ages onward. In these documents, several members of the Roman and non-Roman populace complained about their goods disappearing, especially furniture such as chairs and armchairs, as soon as they crossed the boundaries of the city.[[footnote]]One of the latest cases involved a shipment of ██ armchairs, ordered by the cardinal T███████ B███████; this is the only documented case where all the seats disappeared, without taking into account the odds noted so far.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
