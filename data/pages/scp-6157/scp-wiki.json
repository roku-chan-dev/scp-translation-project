Dr. J. Everwood is to be automatically reassigned to the SCP-6157 file at that time.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6157 is a blanket term for a series of anomalous individuals resembling baseline human beings but composed entirely of compacted sodium polyacrylate. No point of origin has been fixed for any of the twelve instances thus far documented, and no instance has survived for a period exceeding twenty-four hours.\n\n**Discovery:** The first instance of SCP-6157 was discovered in the Prudential Centre shopping mall in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America on 14 December 2021 when a patron bumped into a Dolby Toys restocker, who promptly exploded into a pile of artificial snow. Due to the close proximity of Site-55, Dr. J. Everwood was dispatched to carry out the initial witness interviews.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Nathan Wallis, Dolby Toys stockroom manager\n----\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Can you tell me about Kris?\n\n**Wallis:** Can I. Well, only kind of? I've never met someone so one-dimensional. The guy just would //not// stop talking about Christmas, over and over. He grilled every single person who came in today about it.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Did you ask him to stop?\n\n**Wallis:** Way above my pay grade, but the manager definitely did. Three times. You know what Kris said?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Couldn't begin to guess.\n\n**Wallis:** \"You're not my real Navidad.\"\n\n//Dr. Everwood laughs.//\n\n**Wallis:** Right?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Sounds like a real comedian. Did he seem lonely?\n\n**Wallis:** Not really? Said he had a big family. Actually, he said \"I'm a big family.\" Weird phrasing.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Yeah, that's not good.\n\n**Wallis:** No? You come from a big family?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** That's… not what I meant.\n\n**Wallis:** //No// family, then?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Can we stick to the exploding guy?\n\n**Wallis:** Fair enough.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** It says here that Kris was a temp.\n\n**Wallis:** Yep. Even in a pandemic, gotta keep the Christmas traditions alive. Shit on the radio, shit on the shelves, shit in the stockings and shit on the workers. He probably would've been fired by tomorrow, I don't think he did a damn thing today.\n\n//Wallis pauses.//\n\n**Wallis:** Except explode.\n\n//Dr. Everwood nods.//\n\n**Wallis:** So, uh...\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Did he say where he came from? Provide any personal details?\n\n**Wallis:** Nope. We don't even know his last name, I think the manager was gonna pay him under the table. For all we know his name was Kris Kringle.\n\n//Wallis pauses.//\n\n**Wallis:** How much you wanna bet his name was Kris Kringle?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** You seem to be taking this unusual occurrence unusually well.\n\n**Wallis:** Look, I've been awake for forty hours. Nothing surprises me. And after getting yelled at by my boss and the customers for two straight shifts, honestly? I wish more people would explode.\n\n//Dr. Everwood nods.//\n\n**Wallis:** Anyway, he did say he was looking for someone. Maybe you wanna know about that?\n\n//Dr. Everwood prepares to take notes.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Absolutely. Any leads you can give us would be wonderful.\n\n**Wallis:** He was looking for someone named Everwood.\n\n//Dr. Everwood stares at him.//\n\n**Wallis:** So you probably wanna find whoever that is.\n[[/div]]\n\nWallis and the remaining witnesses were amnesticized and released. Examination of the temp worker's remains revealed a unique thaumic signature; development on a tracking mechanism began immediately due to the subject's reference to possessing 'a big family'.\n\nLacking any further attributes to focus on, Dr. Everwood's GOI Research Group was tasked with examining media reports and police band radio transmissions for individuals displaying unusual and problematic Christmas cheer. The following day, on the morning of 15 December, police were called to assess the sobriety of a mall Santa working at the Copley Place Mall in Boston. The police were intercepted, and Dr. Everwood made contact with the suspect instead.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Anonymous mall Santa, Copley Place Mall\n----\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Can you tell me your name?\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Santa1.jpg|\n    caption=Second recorded SCP-6157 instance. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n**Santa:** I can tell you //your// name, Dr. Everwood.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I already know my name. I don't know yours.\n\n**Santa:** Me either! But do you want to know what the true meaning of Christmas is?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I want to know how you know my name.\n\n**Santa:** Santa always knows. Santa was //made// with that information.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** You were made? Who made you?\n\n**Santa:** Someone who wants you to know the true meaning of Christmas. Do you want to know what the true meaning of Christmas is?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Heh, not really? Maybe later. So--\n\n**Santa:** Okay.\n\n//The entity explodes, coating Dr. Everwood in artificial snow.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** AAAUGH\n[[/div]]\n\nWitnesses were amnesticized.\n\nThe thaumic tracker was delivered to Site-55 the following day, 16 December, and a scan of the Boston Metropolitan Area revealed an SCP-6157 signature at The Corner Mall. Mall security were tasked with locating and detaining any suspicious individuals whilst Dr. Everwood was //en route.// A security guard met them in the mall parking lot to discuss the matter.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Security guard, The Corner Mall\n----\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Hey. You find anything?\n\n**Guard:** Not the true meaning of Christmas, I'll tell you that much.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Cute. Did you identify any suspects, though?\n\n**Guard:** You know, they say this is the most wonderful time of the year.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** They do say that.\n\n**Guard:** They say they're dreaming of a white Christmas.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Well. Only Bing Crosby says that, really. And it's more like sing--\n\n**Guard:** They say and then we were upsot. Oh, jingle bells.\n\n//Dr. Everwood stares at the guard.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** So, it's you then.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Guard.jpg|\n    caption=Third recorded SCP-6157 instance. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n**Guard:** What does 'upsot' mean? Could that be the true meaning of--\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** It means 'upset'. But not in the sense--\n\n**Guard:** Is being upset the true meaning of Christmas?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I'm beginning to feel that way.\n\n**Guard:** You're beginning to feel a lot like Christmas?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I'm beginning to feel a lot like upsetting your slei--\n\n//The guard explodes in a burst of artificial snow, and the wind blows it into Dr. Everwood's face.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** GOD DAMMIT.\n[[/div]]\n\nThere were no witnesses.\n\nThe next thaumic signature appeared on 17 December, at Wrentham Village Premium Outlets. Mall security were not involved on this occasion, and Dr. Everwood intended to alter their interview approach for this subject. Agents quietly depopulated the mall and commenced amnesticization; one clerk remained unresponsive until Dr. Everwood arrived.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Store clerk, Wrentham Village Premium Outlets\n----\n\n**Clerk:** Dr. Everwood. D--\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Clerk.jpg|\n    caption=Fourth recorded SCP-6157 instance. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I want to know the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n//The clerk blinks rapidly.//\n\n**Clerk:** Of course you do. Well, what if it's presents?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Come again?\n\n**Clerk:** What if it's presents? They seem like a big deal.\n\n//The entity gestures at the empty store.//\n\n**Clerk:** Look at all the presents. Everybody wants one. Everybody wants the true meaning of presents. Christmas.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** That's pretty reductive.\n\n**Clerk:** The true meaning of Christmas is pretty reductive.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** I mean… //yes,// but as far as morals go, 'maybe it's presents' doesn't really do much for me?\n\n**Clerk:** Is there a moral?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Of course there's a moral. You're all doing some weird //Christmas Carol// thing, and once I've had my epiphany the game will stop.\n\n**Clerk:** Have you ever gotten a bad present? I bet that would really suck.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Uh--\n\n**Clerk:** I bet the true meaning of Christmas is getting presents that don't really suck.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Have you never heard that it's the thought that counts?\n\n**Clerk:** No.\n\n//The clerk pitches forward, striking its head on the counter. Its head explodes, spilling onto Dr. Everwood's pants and shoes.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Better? I //guess.//\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-6157 manifestations on 18 and 19 December were not intercepted in time due to an alteration in the manifestation pattern. The first instance appeared to be travelling down the Charles River, until MTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\") punched through the ice and discovered that the entity had already particulated, presumably as a result of having drowned. The second instance was involved in a bus accident on Bridge Street; witnesses reported that it had walked into traffic, apparently seeking a closer look at the advertisements wrapped onto the side of each city bus, until it was struck by one and immediately exploded. Witnesses were amnesticized and the bus impounded for particle removal.\n\nOn 20 December, a new instance was detected at the Washington Park Mall. Dr. Everwood investigated.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Mall Santa, Washington Park Mall\n----\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Afternoon.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Santa2.jpg|\n    caption=Seventh recorded SCP-6157 instance. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n**Santa:** It's cold outside.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Please don't start singing.\n\n**Santa:** You were wrong. The true meaning of Christmas isn't outside. It has to be inside. It has to be inside the malls.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Why are you so fixated on this lesson?\n\n**Santa:** It's the reason for the season.\n\n//Dr. Everwood stares at the Santa.//\n\n**Santa:** Is the true meaning of Christmas the true meaning of Christmas?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Okay, do you guys not actually have an answer to thi--\n\n**Santa:** Is it about not knowing? Is it about finding out? Is it //trying// to find out? Is it about how I'm a good looking guy with a hole where my heart should be, and I just need the right woman to come along and thaw me?\n\n//Dr. Everwood attempts to formulate a reply for several seconds.//\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** …no? Definitely not.\n\n**Santa:** No? Definitely not?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Definitely not, because if you thaw someone out when they have a hole where their heart should be, then that someone will die.\n\n//The entity blinks rapidly.//\n\n**Santa:** Maybe it's about dying.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Beg pardon?\n\n**Santa:** Maybe the true meaning of Christmas is dying.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** It's not.\n\n**Santa:** Maybe it is for me.\n\n//The entity collapses into a pile of artificial snow on and around its chair.//\n[[/div]]\n\nAs the mall had already been closed due to a COVID-19 scare, there were no witnesses to amnesticize.\n\nThe manifestation for 21 December was not detected until late in the evening, due to its unusual choice of venue: Old South Church. After a perimeter was established and the clergy detained for amnesticization, Dr. Everwood discovered the entity snuffing and relighting candles by the main entrance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Priest, Russian Orthodox[[footnote]]Old South Church is not a place of Russian Orthodox worship.[[/footnote]]\n----\n\n**Priest:** Have you come to pray, child?\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Priest.jpg|\n    caption=Eighth recorded SCP-6157 instance. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Oh, brother. Drop the act.\n\n**Priest:** Father.\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** What?\n\n**Priest:** Father, child, not brother. Do your parents know you're up this late, child?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Uh.\n\n**Priest:** Is staying up late the true meaning of Christmas? Have you come to pray to Santa? Have you been a good little boys and girls?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** That doesn't make any sense.\n\n**Priest:** You either, huh.\n\n//The entity snuffs the remaining candles.//\n\n**Priest:** Is god the true meaning of Christmas?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** What do you think?\n\n//The entity re-lights each candle.//\n\n**Priest:** Nah.\n\n//The entity demanifests onto the candles, starting a small fire which consumes the guest book and badly scorches the table it was resting upon before Dr. Everwood locates a fire extinguisher.//\n[[/div]]\n\nWith the widening of the search parameters, and the acquisition of additional trackers, the instance for 22 December was quickly discovered. It had taken the guise of a homeless man sitting in a sleeping bag on a park bench in Boston Common.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Homeless man\n----\n\n//Dr. Everwood sits down on the bench.//\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Bench.jpg|\n    caption=Site of ninth recorded SCP-6157 instance manifestation, post-interview. |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** If there's a point to all this, you're running out of time to make it.\n\n**Homeless Man:** Isn't that the truth.\n\n//They watch as pedestrians are carefully maneuvered out of the park by MTF Gamma-5.//\n\n**Homeless Man:** Do you have a family?\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Not… not as such, no.\n\n**Homeless Man:** Me either.

The opening was postponed and the employees detained while Dr. Everwood confronted the SCP-6157 instance, once again occupying the mall's Santa Claus display. The Santa was sleeping in its chair, while an attendant in an elf costume attempted to wake him.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Subject:** Mall Santa\n----\n\n**Attendant:** Excuse m--\n\n**Dr. Everwood:** Run along.
