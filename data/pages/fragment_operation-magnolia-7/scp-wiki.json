A perfect retreat from the world: No television. No radio. No phone line. No people. Nothing but blue sky and clean air and the fish in the pond and the deer in the woods and God’s own Rocky Mountains. George could use the break: work has been a killer these last couple months.\n\nHe buys a roast beef sandwich on the way, leaves it wrapped up in paper. The radio is somewhere in the AM backwaters when he turns it on, and he gets a fragment of a fiery sermon-\n\n//“And the angel of the Lord Most High said ‘You are dust and to dust you shall return, but those who believe shall be **sanctified** by His blood!’ For without the blood of Christ there can be no salvation! He crushes the serpent under his foot, and-”//\n\n-before he switches over.\n\n//”This is// All Things Considered //, I’m Steve Curwood...”//\n\nHe rolls the window down, smokes one of his two daily cigarettes, and lets the October air wash over him.\n\nTwo and a half hours later, he reaches a two-story log cabin at the end of the long gravel driveway. Car off, radio off, he grabs the now-cold sandwich and heads for the front door.\n\nA burly Hispanic man sits on the porch in a white rocking chair, two and a half bottles of Tecate lined up on the railing, a tattered SUPER JUMBO CROSSWORDS in his hand, and a pen in his mouth. He nods wordlessly at George. George nods wordlessly back and lets himself into the cabin.\n\nThe main room smells like four men with little to do have been living here for a week. George ignores the campsite and goes on into the kitchen. Three men are sitting at a time-scarred kitchen table playing penny poker.\n\n“He won’t be giving you any trouble,” the greasy-blonde one says. “Hosed him down for you, too.”\n\n“Appreciated,” George says, before he pulls a key from his pocket and opens the door to the basement. He wrinkles his nose as he descends the creaking wooden stairs – old shit and stale piss still linger in the air.\n\nLeonard Dumlin, naked and dripping wet, is cuffed hand and foot to a pipe in the northwest corner. He hasn’t eaten or slept in three days. He didn’t register the crunch of tires on the gravel driveway. He didn’t register that the speakers in the corner have stopped looping all 42 minutes and 16 seconds of //Thriller// at variable volume for the first time in 76 hours. His head lolls, but some small awareness is still able to fight its way through the delirium and the hunger and the hurt – he raises his head a little and squints at George.\n\nThe guys upstairs smashed his glasses days ago.\n\nGeorge walks across the wet concrete floor, pulls over a folding chair, and sits down just out of arm’s reach.\n\n“Hello, Leonard. My name’s George, and I’m with the FBI.” He flashes a badge of the Unusual Incidents Unit. “I’m here to help you.”\n\n“Help…” Leo’s voice is a dehydrated rasp, slurred with the derealization of sleep deprivation.\n\n“That’s right. It’s high time we got you out of here. My boys are taking care of the guys upstairs. Nasty business you’ve gotten tangled up with.”\n\n“Please…” \n\n“We’ll get you out of here, Leo. I just need a bit of help from you to make that happen.”\n\n“Don’t know…”\n\n“Just a few questions, and we can get you out of here.”\n\n“Help...”\n\n“I know you’re not a bad guy, Leo, I’ve read your file. You’re not a monster, you’ve just fallen in with a bad crowd and can’t get out, hm? You don’t have a choice, right? Got to do what they say to keep your kid sister safe. I understand where you’re coming from, I really do. The world ain’t fuckin’ fair when you grow up poor. You don’t want to end up a deadbeat like your old man or a strung out psycho like you ma, but the rent is due and you can’t find a new gig and if you just get one lucky break you can get away from it all. I’ve been there, Leo. The world’s a fucking meatgrinder for people like you and me.”\n\nLeo mumbles something indistinct. The chain on his leg clinks.\n\n“We can get you out of all of that. All you have to do is answer a few questions and all this goes away like a bad dream.” He relaxes in his seat. “Where is Thomas Paul?”\n\n“I don’t know...”\n\n“There’s only so much I can do if you don’t cooperate, Leo. You’d be wasting your time and mine. Where is Thomas Paul?”\n\n“I don’t know…Thomas...”\n\n“Leo, I know you’ve been through a lot, but you have to stay with me. You knew Thomas Paul, you lived on the same street, right? He went to the same school as your sister. Where did you take him?”\n\nLeo is silent. He licks his lips with a dry tongue. George sighs and shrugs.\n\n“The higher ups will crucify me for this, so let’s just keep it between us poor bastards, hm? FBI special investigator has a lot of weight to throw around. The more you cooperate, the more I’ll be able to put my thumb on the scales of lady justice. Just a few answers, and I could probably argue them down to a lesser sentence. Where did you take Thomas Paul?”\nLeo swallows spittle dust.\n\n“The park. Yosemite…”\n\nGeorge smiles.\n\n“There we go, that wasn’t so bad. We can use that.” George looks down at his hands, like he forgot what he was holding. “Shit, Leo, I’m sorry. I was supposed to give this to you earlier.”\n\nHe tosses the paper-wrapped roast beef sandwich near Leo’s uncuffed hand, the one with the taped-up fingers. Leo fumbles with the wrapper for a moment before tearing it open with his teeth. George lets him finish before the next question.\n\n“We know you were just a go-between. Who did the pickup?”\n\nLeo seems to still be focused on the now-vanished sandwich, as if trying to resurrect the relief.\n\n“Mister Destiny,” he says at last.\n\nGeorge nods solemnly. He’s never heard that name before in his life.\n\n“We suspected he might be involved. He’s a bad man, Leo. Done horrible things. Always one step ahead of us. Can you confirm it was him? What did he look like?”\n\n“Big. Big beard. Long hair. Brown. Like Santa.” Leo scrunches his face up as sluggish, painful thoughts run crosswire across his brain. “No, he...dog head...dog mask? No, a beard...” \n\nGeorge nods sagely.\n\n“Mm, that sounds like him. You got yourself in very deep, Leo. We need more information if we’re going to help Thomas. What did Mr. Destiny say to you? Anything unusual?\n\n“No. Said good morning, good to see you, thank you. Friendly.”\n\n“Did he say anything else? Anything that might be a clue about where he took Thomas?”\n\n“No...maybe? Off to Arcadia...I think he said that. Off to Arcadia…”\n\nOver the next few hours, George pieces together a story. His pocket notebook fills with scribbled ciphers. He notes where Leo’s story changes, where he becomes uncertain, marks out all the potential leads and anything that can be cross-referenced later. The picture forming in his mind looks like this: \n@@ @@\n* **Point 1:** Leonard Dumlin learned about Mr. Destiny from someone he called Diamondback – nothing clear as to how they met, Leo keeps flipping between meeting at a library or while working the back rooms of a warehouse. Diamondback would occasionally give Leo work – selling weed, LSD, Ecstasy, mushrooms, occasionally some petty theft – and while they’d mentioned friends, Leo says he never met them face to face: Patches. Ysolde. Thoth. The Moose.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]This is a name George //has// heard before. He tags it for high-priority follow up.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n* **Point 2:** Leo never directly says who ordered the kidnapping of Thomas Paul. He wheels in circles with some non-answers for a while; when pressed, he claims that it was all his idea and that he asked Diamondback to set up the meeting with Mr. Destiny, only to immediately reverse course and say that it was //Thomas’// idea. [[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]George notes these as either lies or self-delusion.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n* **The sequence of events, as Leo describes it:** Thomas Paul is abducted on Saturday the 22nd, after which he drives out to Yosemite, hands Thomas over to Mr. Destiny, sleeps in his car overnight, and makes the biggest mistake of his life in returning to Sacramento.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Sloppy work, indicating lack of experience. George writes a question with a double underline: why did they send him?[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n* **The sequence of events, as Thomas Paul’s parents describe it:** Thomas leaves the house a little before 10, telling his parents he’s going to hang out with his friends for the day and call home if he was going to stay out later than 7. When his parents make calls around 8 pm, those friends all say that the plan was to meet at the park that morning, but Thomas never showed up. His parents call the police at 8:43pm, already blaming Leonard Dumlin.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Thomas’ parents confirmed that Thomas and Leo knew each other and were on friendly terms. They call him a “dope-head faggot” when speaking to the police. George does not find Leo’s denials of homosexuality convincing.[[/span]] The name pings a Foundation watchdog, and the case makes its way to Chi-45 by midnight.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Leo had been on the team’s watchlist since March, after he and three other individuals participated in the smash-and-grab of a rare book collector the Foundation had been using as a honeypot. The robbers had ignored the primary bait, a 15th century copy of the //Sworn Book of Honorius//, in favor of the much less financially valuable but much more //sub velamine// relevant fourth book of the //Hecatoncheires Cycle//.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n* **The sequence of events, as the Foundation describes it:** Leonard Dumlin is brought in for police questioning on Tuesday, October. Chi-45 presents Sacramento police with prefabricated justification for a transferral of custody. Leonard Dumlin is taken from the police station by two Chi-45 agents, and is interrupted in transit by other Chi-45 agents posing as hatchet men of whoever ordered the abduction coming to silence a potential leak.\n@@ @@\n* **Point 3:** Leo pleads total ignorance of the Serpent’s Hand, despite running in occultist circles for years.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]George believes him, for the most part: he knows how the compartmentalization game is played.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n* **Point 4:** Leo is adamant that Thomas was not harmed.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]George does not believe him.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n\nWhen it’s all done and George can get no more out of his guest, he thanks Leo for his time, says that a medic will be down to get him all squared away. He goes up the creaking wooden stairs, fixes up a mess plate from the contents of the fridge, and goes out on the porch. Night has fallen, cold and black. George lights up his second allotted cigarette.\n\nOut there, beyond the trees, so many thousands of Americans clutch their Bibles and their dogeared copies of //Michelle Remembers// in horror at the news swirling around McMartin Preschool and growing worse by the day. \n\nThe official story will be that Leonard Dumlin committed suicide while in police custody.\n\n> MTF Chi-45, which served as the Foundation’s primary anti-cult taskforce from 1980 to 1992, was a continuation of Blackout Era operations. It formed from the merger of over a dozen field cells with the Special Project Groups PETRONIUS, AGATHON, and EPIMARCHUS, and maintained a clandestine operational strategy for years after its founding. This resistance to centralization was justified by Chi-45’s commander ███████ ██████ as necessary to monitor and combat small and decentralized anomalous religious groups such as the Serpent’s Hand, schismatic Broken God sects, and remaining Fifthist infection strands.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The Hand’s initial classification as a religious GOI was colored by the association of some of its members with with //supra velamine// Satanist groups, and it has retained this classification despite not qualifying under the 2014 Revised GOI Classification Guidelines.[[/span]]\n> \n> ██████ would be appointed to the position of Overseer 6 in 1984; the commander vacancy would be filled by poached UIU veteran Matthew Kovac, who brought the task force under more normative operational guidelines. Kovac would remain as commander until Chi-45 was disbanded and replaced by Eta-77 in 1992.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/6| Previous Chapter]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/8| Next Chapter]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
