While unified behind these goals, achieving them requires a wide variety of approaches.

The Antimemetics Division exists to research and contain anomalous antimemes. These concepts, objects, and entities threaten normalcy and endanger human life, but are almost impossible to record or even remember.\n\nThrough careful observation, extensive training, and regular use of mind-altering mnestics, the Antimemetics Division is able to deal with the dangers that [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five| everyone else forgets]]].\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //antimemetics-division//, [/system:page-tags/tag/antimemetics-division click here].\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n,,[#toc Back to Top],,\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# aiad]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF;\"]]\n+ [[[*aiad-homescreen| Artificial Intelligence Applications Division ]]]\n[[f>image aiad.png width=\"100px\"]]\n\n**Overview:** The Artificial Intelligence Applications Division (AIAD) of the Foundation's IT Department was created to develop, study, and utilise Artificial Intelligence.

It is open to new additions, but they must meet the minimum requirements.\n\nTo avoid overlap, Departments listed on this page can't also be listed on the [[[Groups Of Interest]]] or [[[task-forces| Mobile Task Forces]]] pages.\nDepartments on this list must either have a Department-specific Hub page or have their own tag. The only requirement for the Hub page is that it has to be positively rated, so it's best to wait a few days after posting before adding it to this list. While the Department hub page could also serve as a canon or tale series hub, it can't also be a Secure Facility Dossier, since there's already a [[[secure-facilities-locations| page for listing Sites and Areas]]].\n\nIf you want a tag for your department, you'll need to post on the tag approval thread, currently [/forum/t-14227350/tag-suggestion-thread-4:an-approval-for-crows this thread]. The requirement for a Group tag is currently 5 articles by 3 authors minimum, with a recommendation that you have 10 articles by 5 authors.\n\nThis page is the responsibility of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/curation-main Curation Team]. If you have any questions about this page or about adding a new department to it, contact staff via the #help-desk channel on the [https://discord.com/invite/scp SCP Wiki Official Discord server], or via [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chat-guide IRC chat #site17], or by messaging a member of the Collaboration Pages subteam.\n[[/Collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[# related-pages]]\n++ Related Pages\n* [[[list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments| Internal Departments]]] - A list of Foundation Departments translated from the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ru-hub Russian Branch] of the SCP Foundation.\n* [[[departments-complete-list|A Semi Comprehensive List of Foundation Departments]]] - Listing more minor departments omitted from this list.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Jerden, MontagueETC]]\n=====\n=====\n[[<]]\n> With thanks to [[*user Stormbreath]] for the Antimemetics Division CSS, and to [[*user TopDownUnder]] and [[*user EstrellaYoshte]] for the Department of Abnormalities CSS.\n\n> **Filename:** aiad\n> **Name:** Infotech Department\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne\n\n> **Filename:** alchemy-department\n> **Author:** [[*user Jerden]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/jerden-insignia\n\n> **Filename:** antimemetics\n> **Name:** Antimemetics Division\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne\n\n> **Filename:** Decom.%20Dept.%20Logo.svg\n> **Name:** Decom.
