However, the nature of the occult threat faced by GOC Operatives means that some use of advanced (downstream) technology beyond current norms is required. The following is a brief overview of terminology used to refer to downstream technology.\n\n++ Generation Zero\nAlso known as Current Gen or Gen0. Refers to any technology that is readily available at the current level of technological advancement. Loss of Gen0 equipment is generally of minimal concern. The majority of equipment issued by Quartermaster Division is Generation Zero technology.\n\n++ Generation Plus One\nAlso known as Gen+ or +1Gen. Refers to any technology considered cutting edge or advanced given the current level of technological advancement, but could conceivably exist as a prototype or specially constructed item. Loss of Gen+1 technology may necessitate action by PSYCHE in order to minimize impact to Second Mission concerns, but is generally not a cause for undue alarm.\n\n++ Generation Plus Two\nAlso known as Gen++ or +2Gen. Refers to any technology clearly beyond the ability of the current level of technological advancement to produce. All Gen+2 technology issued to GOC Operatives must include a readily accessible self-destruct device to prevent downstream technology from falling into the hands of the public.\n\n++ Tangential\nAlso known as GenAlt or TanGenT. Tangential Technology is any technology that relies on principles other than those of science, such as magic or faith. Tangential Technology not in the possession of a GOC Operative may be considered a Known Threat Entity. Loss of Tangential Technology may require a Response Level 5 action to prevent the item from being discovered by the public.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Black Suit]]\n+ Mk VII Standard Field Dress (Black Suit)\n**GEN+1**\n\n++ History\nGOC Operatives are often required to operate in a variety of urban environments, in close proximity both to dangerous Threat Entities and the civilian population. In the interests of Second Mission (Concealment) concerns, Quartermaster's Division developed the Standard Field Dress in the early 1970s to act as a low-visibility defensive garment for agents in the field.\n\nEarly SFDs suffered from several weaknesses: they tended to be heavy, restricting in movement, uncomfortable in heat or cold, and could not be made in any color aside from their undyed black. This resulted in the early \"Black Suits\" paradoxically causing their wearers to become more visible than if they had worn normal tactical gear. Since then, advancements in materials technology have allowed for greater comfort and lesser visibility in the garments worn by modern field agents. However, these garments are still informally referred to as \"Black Suits\" for tradition's sake.\n\n++ Overview\nThe MkVII SFD is the current iteration of PHYSICS Division's standard duty garment. Modern Black Suits come in a variety of different fashions for various situations (ranging from high-society formalwear to thrift-store discards for blending in with transient populations). In light of changing threat conditions and advances in technology, this garment is constantly being revised and upgraded. The most recent official model incorporated the following characteristics:\n\n* A form-fitting ballistic-fiber undergarment worn next to the skin, made of +1 Generation nanofiber, rated to stop handgun rounds with standard powder load at point blank range.\n* +1 Generation nanofiber threads integrated into key points in outergarments to provide additional protection. Combined with undergarment, must be rated to stop rifle rounds with standard powder load at a distance of twenty meters.\n* Micronized communications gear located in the collar and cuffs of the garment, or integrated into jewelry.\n* Augmented Reality system and projector integrated into eyewear or disguised as a cosmetic accessory.\n* Personal Computing Device (PCD) integrated into a cellular phone, implanted as a cybernetic enhancement, or disguised as footwear, with satellite connection to GOC data network.\n* Emergency toolkits and weapons, miniaturized and disguised as necessary, are provided by Quartermaster's Division for specific missions upon request.\n\n> //Black Suits might not be the sexiest combat dress PHYSICS issues, but they've saved more lives than any other piece of tech we've developed. They're heavy, itchy, and smell funny until you break them in, but the first time one of them stops a bullet that should have killed you, you'll come to see them in a whole new light.//\n> \n> //Agent \"Madrigal.\"//\n> //Strike Team \"Noble Phantom.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Grey Suit]]\n+ Mk IV Infiltration Uniform (Grey Suit)\n**GEN+1**\n\n++ Overview\nThe Grey Suit is the current iteration of battledress issued in cases where stealth is prioritized over protection. Grey Suits consist of a full-coverage garment made of \"chameleon cloth,\" which incorporates minute chromatophores similar to those found in cuttlefish or chameleons. Hundreds of small cameras incorporated at strategic points take pictures of the surrounding environment and project them onto the opposite side of the garment.\n\nThe end result is an adaptive camouflage system which (unfortunately) falls far short of a true invisibility cloak: the low resolution of the surface causes the image to be blurry or distorted, and it cannot project light or reflections. In addition, the lag time of the system means that movement of the viewer or wearer will disrupt the image. However, its use of only +1 Generation technology, and the significant advantage it grants to stationary wearers, makes it a useful addition to an Assessment Team's arsenal.\n\nAdditional tarpaulins and cloaks made of chameleon cloth are often used in (and should be used in) combination with the Grey Suit when setting up stationary hides in the field.\n\n> //Here's something they don't tell you in the official documentation: talk to your quartermaster, maybe slip him a twenty or buy him a case of beer (the good stuff), and give him your weapon. He'll bring it back to you covered in chameleon cloth, with an interface that can hook into your greysuit. That way, your weapon can be invisible too. Technically, he's not supposed to do that in case you lose your weapon in the field, but everyone does it and High Command turns a blind eye. Besides, without the proper command signals, it just looks like a commercial aftermarket neoprene slipcover.//\n> \n> //Agent \"Madrigal.\"//\n> //Strike Team \"Noble Phantom.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab White Suit]]\n+ Mk II Combat Garment (White Suit)\n**GEN+2/TanGenT**\n\n++ Overview\nReserved strictly for use by Strike Teams, White Suits represent the epitome of PHYSICS Division's battledress technology. The suit comprises three components:\n\n1. A close-fitting undergarment, derived from the Black Suit, that provides last-ditch protection to the wearer's torso, as well as incorporating waste collection ports and a water-cooling system to prevent buildup of residual heat.\n2. A rigid suit of battle armor with pseudomyomer exomusculature and full hazardous environment protection, powered by a micronized fuel cell located in the lower back. A weak adhesive  is coated on the fingers and lower palm of the armor's hands to keep grip on weapons.\n3. An invisibility cloak generator, incorporating Tangential Technology to bend light around the subject, providing full invisibility.\n\nThe White Suit has a notable degree of modularity, in that it can be further specialized for missions in exotic environment through the use of additional components, such as the \"Zero Suit\" modification, which incorporates self contained breathing, reflective visors, and magnetic boots for use in low-gravity vacuum environments.\n\nAs White Suits employ a large amount of +2 Generation and Tangential Technology, all units are equipped with a self-destruct device to prevent them from being captured or discovered by outside personnel.\n\n> //Word of advice if you end up in Strike: get as much body hair removed as possible. I don't care how you do it: laser, electrolysis, whatever. Those damn White Suits fit so fucking tightly it's not uncommon for guys to get their pubes or leg hair stuck in the joints and ripped out when they bent their knee or hip the wrong way. Also: check, double check, and triple check that your skinsuit is fitting tightly, without wrinkles or bunching, before you climb into the hardsuit, unless you like blisters all over your chest, hips, shoulders, or groin. It wouldn't hurt to invest in a really good jock strap, either, if you're so endowed.//\n> \n> //Agent \"Madrigal.\"//\n> //Strike Team \"Noble Phantom.\"//\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Orange Suit]]\n+ Mk. III Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis (Orange Suit)\n**GEN+2/TanGenT**\n\n++ History\n\nThe Ultra-Heavy Engagement Chassis fulfills a niche role in PHYSICS Division operations: namely, engaging massive or heavily armed Threat Entities. In the past, encounters with such entities could be resolved only by evacuating the area and escalating to Response Level 5. Furthermore, in encounters against enemies armed with heavy weaponry or armor, Strike Operatives tended to fall short due to a lack of armored cavalry support. In light of this, a new system was developed to provide both the ability to engage massive KTEs, as well as provide rapid and mobile heavy armor support.\n\nMk. I and II U-HECs suffered from multiple drawbacks in their design: for instance, the ground pressure caused by a bipedal machine the size of a tank caused severe damage to paved roads, as well as resulting in the machine and operator bogging down or collapsing urban structures. Further problems included operator exhaustion, overheating, and balance issues. As time went on, however, advancements in the fields of nanotechnology and Tangential Technology allowed U-HECs to be built lighter, faster, and much more responsive. The modern U-HEC (the Mark III \"Orange Suit\") is a much more mobile and agile unit, although still requiring infantry support from Strike assets.\n\n++ Overview\n\nU-HECs are designed for situations in which a Threat Entity possesses extreme destructive potential, such as a large cryptid, Tier 5 or higher energy manipulators, or persons with access to heavy weaponry. As stealth is practically impossible due to the size of the unit and the noise caused by its operation, U-HECs are equipped with \"Banshee\" audio-visual cognitohazard generators to induce panic in non-inoculated personnel. Believing that the system is more effective if it has the full attention of the target, some U-HEC operators use bright colors or gaudy ornamentation to draw the attention of the enemy.\n\nThe exact construction and composition of the Mark III U-HEC is classified, but are known to include:\n\n* Buckypaper bilayered with dilatant gelatin in order to absorb shock from bullets and explosives.\n* Silicon nanofluid cooling system integrated into a bodysuit similar to that worn with the White Suit.\n* Pseudomyomer exomusculature similar to that used in the White Suit, but augmented with miniaturized high-torque electromechanical servos for greater strength at the cost of some response time.\n* Ceramic plating to reduce electrical conductivity.\n* Vaporizing liquid extinguisher for protection against flammable agents.\n* Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) outer shell.\n* Full environmental hazard protection, including toxin filters and rebreathers.\n* OCULUS sensor suite, including VERITAS imaging system.\n* Ram-Air Parachute system for aerial deployment.\n* \"Firestorm\" Antipersonnel Directional Explosive (ADE): scaled up version of the \"Roomsweeper\" hemispherical claymore mounted on the White Suit. This system was added to early U-HECs after an incident in which a U-HEC operator, cut off from infantry support, was overwhelmed and killed by multiple enemy infantry who climbed onto the suit and prised the operator out of the pilot compartment. The system consists of a series of directional mines mounted on the exterior of the unit which can be set to detonate at the command of the operator.\n\nAnything an infantry squad could carry or operate as a crew-served weapon, the U-HEC can mount.\nThis includes M2 Browning .50 caliber heavy machine guns, M134 Miniguns, Mk19 automatic grenade launchers, and various ATGMs (like the Javelin missile). The U-HEC can also mount lighter vehicle-mounted weapons, like the Bushmaster autocannon and TOW missile launcher.\n\nHowever, the GOC tends to deploy these weapon systems the way everyone else does: on vehicles, or as crew-served weapons. U-HECs get deployed when the GOC needs to get up close and personal with something incredibly nasty. There's a reason why Orange Suit pilots spend most of their time training, repairing their gear, and waiting to get deployed: those kinds of threats don't come up very often.\n\n> //I've operated with U-HECs six times, and each time, it's been fucking intense. Even if you're inoculated against the cognitos, it's fucking terrifying to see that huge thing smashing through small buildings and shrugging off small arms fire like rain. I can't imagine what it must be like for anyone who has to go up against that thing with the full force of the Banshee shrieking at them: shitting their pants and running screaming for the hills is the kindest thing I've seen happen.//\n> \n> //The downside is, it's easy to feel invincible with a giant fucking golem smashing everything in your wake, but that's when things get the most dangerous. Not everyone turns and runs. Some people respond to abject terror by going violently berserk. Plus, even when you're wearing a tank, there's plenty of things out there that kill tanks just fine. Some of them are out of Banshee range, too. So if you ever have the honor and privilege to wear an Orange Suit, remember: you're not invincible, even if everyone else acts like you are. And that thing you're wearing makes you the biggest target on the battlefield.//\n> \n> //Agent \"Madrigal.\"//\n> //Strike Team \"Noble Phantom.\"//\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Blue Suit]]\n\n+ Mk. IV Sub Aquatic-Low Pressure Environment Suit (Blue Suit)\n**GEN+1**\n\n++ History\n\nEarly GOC underwater operations utilized SCUBA gear and wetsuits no different than those used by military or civilian divers. The limits of this system soon became apparent: lack of protection from water-borne threats made it completely unsuitable for GOC mission objectives. As time has passed, SALPES has evolved as well: the modern variation is a far cry from the crude systems used in the post World War II era.\n\n++ Overview\n\nSALPES is utilized for underwater operations (both termination of KTEs and investigation of PTEs) when a full Atmospheric Diving Apparatus (hardsuit) is unavailable or inappropriate. The most recent version of SALPES includes:\n\n* Water electrolyzer for production of hydrogen and oxygen while underwater.\n* Hydrogen powered fuel cell for the SALPES electronic systems.\n* Form-fitting buckypaper garment bilayered with dilatant gelatin to provide ballistics protection, with Nichrome heating element.\n* Water-resistant \"Trident\" model OCULUS vision-enhancement equipment.\n* Rebreather system/SCUBA gear, depending on mission parameters.\n\nShould a mission possess additional risks, the Blue Suit may be augmented with additional technology to aid in the fulfillment of mission objectives, such as steel mail, at the discretion of the Assessment Team Captain, in coordination with the Quartermaster's Division.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Silver Suit]]\n\n+ Mk. V Heat and Fire Survival Garment (Silver Suit)\n**GEN 0**\n\n++ Overview\n\nHFSG is utilized in missions where encountering high temperatures, open flames, or smoke and other fumes is a probable risk. The base suit incorporates the following components:\n\n* Lightweight form-fitting undergarment.\n* Silicon crystal cooling system.\n* Advanced ceramic fiber padding for protection from heat and open flames.\n* Reflective overgarment for protection from heat radiation and molten metal\n* Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with protective goggles and face cover for protection from inhaling smoke and toxic chemicals.\n* Heat-resistant \"Forge\" model OCULUS vision-enhancement equipment.\n* Special purpose firefighting toolkit.\n\nThe Silver Suit is not designed for armed combat, due to its lack of ballistic protection.\n\nShould a mission possess additional risks, the Silver Suit may be augmented with additional technology to aid in the fulfillment of mission objectives, such as ballistic undergarment, at the discretion of the Assessment Team Captain, in coordination with the Quartermaster's Division.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Red Suit]]\n+ Mk. VII Hazardous Environment Survival Suit (Red Suit)\n**GEN+1**\n\nHESS is utilized in missions where encountering hazardous chemicals, pathogens, radiation, fallout, or undetonated explosives is a probable risk. The base suit incorporates the following components:\n\n* Lightweight form-fitting undergarment.\n* Silicon crystal cooling system.\n* Cushioning layer.\n* 1mmPb lined fullbody UHMWPE overgarment to shield the body from radiation.\n* Hooded UHMWPE poncho.\n* Multilayer steel polycarbonate elastomer-glass trauma armor for protection from concussive and ballistic force.\n* Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with protective goggles and face cover for protection from inhaling or making contact with chemical and biological agents. Communications gear and OCULUS system integrated for mission purposes.\n\nThe Red Suit by itself is not primarily designed for armed combat, due to its weight, but it excels in exploration, and in the recovery or liquidation of inanimate and unarmed anomalies in hazardous environments. \n\nShould a mission possess additional risks, the Red Suit may be augmented with additional technology to aid in the fulfillment of mission objectives, such as nichrome heating elements, chameleon cloth, or engraved bronze plating, at the discretion of the Assessment Team Captain, in coordination with the Quartermaster's Division.\n\n> //\"There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.\"//\n> //- Scandinavian proverb//\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Bronze Suit]]\n\n+ Mk X Occult Threat Confrontation System (Bronze Suit)\n**TanGenT**\n\n++ History\n\nDuring GOC's time as an organization, it has encountered many hundreds of unique threats to the safety and sanctity of the nations of earth. Most of them can be neutralized with conventional arms and armor, but some entities possess abilities of a nature such that the durability of armor is simply irrelevant in any combative engagement.\n\nOne attempt to level the playing field against occult threats was proposed early on, in the 1930s, in the form of the Occult Threat Confrontation System series of suits (OTCs).\n\nBy shielding the wearer from magical influence, it was believed that it would be easier to liquidate the source of the threat while lessening the risk to the operatives involved.\n\nEarly models of this suit were cumbersome and ineffective when it came to their intended purpose, leading to the OTC design to be retired for several years.\n\nIn the modern era, innovations in the defense against the occult have allowed for the return of the OTCS with several essential improvements, although it is now used in a more limited scope due to the GOC's improved understanding of distinct types of thaumaturgical and non-thaumaturgical phenomena.\n\nThe primary component that facilitated the creation of the original OTCS was the material presently designated LTE-0628-Kapalamorph-Blueproof, a large collection of jewelry including necklaces, rings, and bracelets, which were made from an as of then unknown alloy of bronze. This collection was discovered in a then newly discovered subterranean temple in the island of Donoussa. Translation of a cartouche located in the room that the alloy was discovered in indicated that the jewelry possessed the ability to \"rid [MISSING; likely the name of the region, or people] of daemons (spirits) and [prophets](?) in its [domain](?)\"\n\nThe jewelry in the tomb was collected and melted down into several hundred ingots for use in the construction of Coalition equipment.\n\nEarly suits constructed of this material proved ineffective in their advertised purpose. This was initially believed to be because of a lack of coverage of the body, leading to several iterations of armor being constructed much in the fashion of a diving suit. These early suits were cumbersome and provided virtually no benefit.\n\nIn 1929, it was discovered through more rigorous testing that the material was in fact ordinary Beryllium Copper, and only possessed a limited scope of defensive ability. In 1930 the OTCS would be retired due to a lack of efficacy.\n\nIt wouldn't be until the late 1960s that the GOC would catalogue and implement the knowledge required to understand why the OTCS had failed:\n\nProject GRIS (Glyph, Rune, Icon, Sigil), starting in 1968, tested several symbols and mediums in search of a tangible effect. It determined that the alloy was in fact an ideal medium for engraving occult symbols, specifically those of a warding nature. In 1975, the OTCS was brought back into circulation as part of the GOC's roster of equipment.\n\n++ Overview\n\nIn the latest Mk. X OTCS, Microscopic tesselated patterns of defensive symbols and wards are engraved into the surface of the bronze, which is plated over the standard GOC Black Suit (SFDs), or  other suits (IU, CG, U-HEC, SALPES) in the case of special mission requirements that require maximizing protection from thaumaturgical threats in addition of the existing conditions. The Mk. X OTC is rated to survive 10 kilocaspers of aetheric radiation. Damage to the pattern of the OTCS may limit its defensive abilities, and after each operation, an OTCS is to be destroyed and its material is recycled for the construction of future OTC Systems.\n\nA self-destruct device integrated into each suit of armor guarantees that should any operative wearing it become compromised in any way, due to its nature as an anomalous technology.\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab VERITAS]]\n+ Mark IV Vital Energy Radiation Imaging Tactical Awareness System (\"VERITAS\")\n**TanGenT**\n\n//Note: Because of the sensitive nature of this technology, all information regarding the true nature of Etheric Resonance Imagery (ERI) is classified Level Q by order of GOC High Command. This document will cover only the operation of the VERITAS device by GOC Field Operatives. The device itself is classified as \"Black Box\" technology and should not be repaired by anyone other than an authorized Coalition technician. ERI technology is to be considered Tangential Technology, and must be outfitted with a self-destruct device to prevent downstream technology from being released to the civilian population.//\n\n++ Overview\nThe VERITAS Resonance Imager is a fourth-generation device based on the principles of Etheric Resonance Imagery originally discovered by Semyon Kirlian in 1939. This is not to be confused with what is commonly known as \"Kirlian Photography,\" which is a simple corona discharge phenomenon. Prior versions of the system (including COLLICULUS), required a separate Resonance Imager and Viewer, making the system too bulky to be carried by a single person. Recent miniaturization advances have allowed the entire system to be incorporated into a single headpiece, most commonly combined with low-light, infrared, and ultraviolet imaging technology in the OCULUS vision enhancing headset.\n\nLike all ERI devices, VERITAS functions by detecting the distinctive Aetheric Energy Fields (AEF), or Elan Vital Energy (EVE) given off by living creatures during the course of normal life functions. By measuring the wavelengths and intensity of these energy fields, information regarding the nature of the life form, its mental and physical state, and any paranormal alterations can be determined.\n\nIn its simplest configuration, a single VERITAS unit can be used to detect the presence of higher life forms, even through a wall or other vision-obstructing obstacle. However, the device's true potential is only reached when two or more units function in tandem. By triangulating the position and nature of various AEFs, a three-dimensional map of the area (including the locations of all hostiles) can be provided to a mission commander or overwatch.\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab SLEEP]]\n+ Mark VII Sensory-Loop Alternative Ego Emplacement Projector (“SLEEP”)\n**TanGenT**\n\n//Note: The following information is restricted to Level-A personnel with the SPIRIT SAI caveat. Access to any records or repair operations for Mk II–VII renditions of SLEEP implants is Level-Q classified per the Tangential Black Box Classification Act of 1953. Embedding SLEEP into GOC agents requires integrated neurosurgery (integrated referring to the use of thaumaturgic and hypnotic incantations), whereas removal will lead to death. SLEEP is restricted to PNEUMA personnel and certain PHYSICS Assessment Teams.//\n\n++ Overview\nSLEEP is a set of thaumaneurological implants inserted into a subject's occipital and temporal lobes, which protrude into their insular lobe and thalamus. The specific locations of these implants are classified.\n\nIn 1978, Franz Mesmer, a German physician, performed the earliest account of legitimately fooling oneself into another identity via hypnosis. The practice involved using Projected Alter-Egos (PAEs), which were persona fronts embedded within the user’s consciousness and preconsciousness. In contrast, the subject’s true personality was suppressed into a lower state of thought, bordering the unconsciousness and subconsciousness. This effectively allowed two personalities to occupy the same physical body, with the alternative ego dominating motor function, conscious thought, and persona. However, in hypnosis, PAEs were uncontrollable and must be maintained under continued exposure to a certain hypnotic conjuration. PAEs in the 19th century were divined as one’s “revealed self,” which has since been --disproven.--\n\nIn the 1950s, a World Parahealth Organization project, codenamed “Anti-Schlaftiefe,” explored the use of PAEs upon the resurgence of the GOC on the paranormal and international stage. Deciding conventional espionage will soon no longer suffice, WPO neuroscientists and parapsychiatrists endeavored to modulate PAEs so PNEUMA and PHYSICS agents could flawlessly perform any given alibi with their true identity suppressed into their unconscious. The goal was to achieve the ability to “turn off” an agent’s conscious identity and replace it with a customized artificial persona. Its controls would be relegated to High Command personnel. EGO was the first attempt, which was a procedure similar to electroconvulsive therapy. It was immediately shut down after a test subject could not be returned to their original identity. They were amnestized and returned to society under occasional surveillance.\n\nEventually, Anti-Schlaftiefe discovered a revelation that led to <CLASSIFIED LEVEL-Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND> with the remaining researchers rendered permanently insomniac. The project inevitably created SLEEP.\n\nToday, PAEs embed themselves in the personas of several PNEUMA EXSEC sleeper agents and PHYSICS Assessment operatives, allowing an agent to perform their duties within their dreamlike subconsciousness while allowing a PAE to perform their alibi. In the event of a compromised agent, <CLASSIFIED LEVEL-Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND> and their memory databanks reclassified to Level-Z.\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Silver Bullets]]\n+ Mk I Monolithic Silver Ammunition (Silver Bullets)\n**GEN+0**\n\n++ History\n\nDeveloped very early in the history of the Coalition, silver bullets have needed minimal refinement in their time in service.\n\nThey have seen the most use by Strike Teams ST-0601 \"Proteus\" and ST-8364 \"Death Perception\".\n\n++ Overview\n\nThe round is composed of monolithic .995 silver (Ag) - a material known to possess highly deleterious effects against both the majority of Type Yellow shape-changing anomalies and several varieties of Type Gray reanimated entities.\n\nThe remaining .005 proportion is copper, alloyed with the silver on a nano-alloy scale, forming deformities which add additional durability and hardness to the metal.\n\nVariants of this ammunition include black osmium-core, incendiary tip, and hollow-point.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Blue Bullets]]\n+ Mk II High Explosive/Slow Tactical Incendiary Ammunition (Blue Bullets)\n**GEN+1**\n\n++ History\n\nHE/STIA ammunition exploits both the physical and psychological (antipathetic) vulnerabilities that many threat entities have to light, heat, and combustion. The most common threat entities to bear a vulnerability to fire are Type Red and Type Gray anomalies.\n\n++ Overview\n\nThese bullets are tipped with an advanced chemical incendiary tip, capable of burning at temperatures upwards of 4000 degrees Celsius, easily hot enough to melt most metals found in the field.\n\nThe basic chemical agent itself is a zirconium-copper nanothermate, the exact chemical composition and proportions of which are <CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>\n\nVariant chemical compounds that have high-explosive (HE) or long-burning properties (S) have been developed for special purpose use, but are rarely necessary. The same chemicals are also used in incendiary grenades for some missions. Due to the utilization of Gen+1 technology and the apparent Second Goal (Concealment) concerns with both HEA and STIA, the use of both must be approved by the Quartermaster Division prior to use. \n\n> //Why are TIAs called blue bullets? They burn bright fucking blue. Well, actually, it's more of a bright blueish-white. But regardless, if you're going into combat with those things, I'd look into securing a good pair of safety goggles. Doubly true with the grenades. Otherwise you'll end up with cataracts by the time you're 25. Eye protection is no joke.//\n> \n> //Agent \"Madrigal.\"//\n> //Strike Team \"Noble Phantom.\"//\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Black Bullets]]\n+ Mk III High-Density Osmium Cored Ammunition (Black Bullets)\n**GEN+1**\n\n++ History\nDespite what the threat entities you will encounter may claim, the vast majority of supernatural beings are susceptible to gunfire. But that doesn't mean that they are easy to liquidate; Many threat entities can withstand ordinary ammunition either due to high-density cybernetic components or organic structures, or to the presence of thaumaturgical wards, which can slow or neutralize incoming bullets.\n\nHistorically, many groups have strived to understand and overcome these unnatural defenses. Notably, KTO-1918-Scarlet-Dagger (GRU Psychotronics Division) in conjunction with LTO-1844-Scarlet-Scalpel (\"Progress\" Research Institute) undertook significant research in during the twilight years of the second World War. They discovered that heavier elements, owing their higher molecular weights, were exponentially more challenging to manipulate through thaumaturgical means.\n \nIn the 1970s, as the Soviet Union made strides in armor plating technology, the US Department of Defense responded by developing armor-piercing rounds that incorporated depleted uranium. However, even depleted uranium was not enough. As thaumaturgic theory and technique evolved, the GOC initially developed its own ammunition with an osmium core. Osmium's molecular density surpasses even that of depleted uranium, making it a highly effective material for bullet construction.\n\n++ Overview\n\nThe current model of HDOCA is composed of a copper jacket, black osmium (Bo) core, and copper plug.\n\nThe Black Osmium used in Black Bullets is composed in an irregular DHCP crystal structure, which comes out to an impressive 24 grams per cubic centimeter. This is, as of yet, the densest conventional material the Coalition has developed in-house; however, the development of a denser general material is still ongoing by the Alchemists' Guild in conjunction with The Ancient Noble Order of the Gormogons.\n//(See: PTOLEMY Division Scientific Journal 18 for more information regarding this project.)//\n\nThe black osmium, due to being mainly processed by raw osmium, a platinum group metal, comes at a significant cost. The prices range of HDOCA from approximately 90 USD per 7.62x51mm round to over 4,500 dollars for a 30x173mm round. Given this high cost, the use of these specialized munitions is limited to operations where their deployment is deemed necessary by each Strike Team's Captain, in consultation with the Chief Assessor and Quartermaster. This practice ensures efficient utilization of resources and avoids unnecessary expenditure on threats that simply don't warrant it.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Ochre Bullets]]\n+ Mk VII Frangible Cold Iron Ammunition (Ochre Bullets)\n**GEN+1/TanGenT**\n\n++ History\nIn accordance with trade agreement with the kingdom of Hy-Brasil (ACT-1992-Avalon), the Global Occult Coalition is granted 1000 kilograms of cold iron (Ci) annually in exchange for the defense of the Kingdom of Hy-Brasil in the event of <CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>\n\n++ Overview\n\nOchre bullets are formed by room-temperature compression of powdered cold iron, as cold iron lacks a melting point and cannot be forged through traditional methods.\n\nDue to the frangible nature of the bullets, they will pulverize on impact, spreading small pieces of cold iron into the tissue and bloodstream.\n\nAs a metal, cold iron is highly toxic, in that the body cannot distinguish it, and will integrate it in the creation of new blood cells in a meta-stable biological process. Blood cells that contain even a single atom of cold iron are not capable of clotting, and cannot transport oxygen or nutrients to the body. This leads to induced hemophilia, loss of oxygen to the brain and other vital organs, and rapid cellular necrosis.\n\nThe Mk VII FCIA is considered the most effective munition available in the termination of Type Red threat entities, but due to the exclusive nature of the resource, it must be used sparingly. The use of these specialized munitions is limited to operations where their deployment is deemed necessary by each Strike Team's Captain, in consultation with the Chief Assessor and Quartermaster. \n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Fuchsia Bullets]]\n+ Mk IV Thaumatological Working Equipped Ammunition (Fuchsia Bullets)\n**GEN+0/TanGenT**\n++ History\nTWEA technology has come a long way since its origins in thaumatologists within Renaissance-era line infantry divisions. Most etched runes used on bullets as far back as the 1400s have been used to simply subdue an opponent, though their full potential has been realized in modern times along with the development of manufacturing. With assistance from an allied thaumatologist, nearly any (small enough) working and its effects are possible to contain within a single bullet or artillery shell.\n++ Overview\nTWEA is made from a standard piece of ammunition that is then etched with a series of runes, glyphs, or sigils, potentially any combination of the three, that set up a thaumatic working. With the help of a nearby thaumatologist or simply from the bullet hitting its target, the working is set into motion, and practically any effect is achieved.\n\nTruly, any type of bullet, or any type of propelled ammunition really, can be used to create TWEA, though problems arise from using certain types of bullets to create TWEA. Hollow point ammunition may destroy the runes on the bullet as the bullet expands, which can fully nullify the effects of the inscribed working. This problem of runes being destroyed after impact also might arise with HE ammunition.\n\nThe two most common methods of creating TWEA are: \nA) Installing a small metal cube on the back of the projectile with all runes required in the working inscribed on the cube with the requirement for the activation of the working (or the shaper of the working) being the projectile making contact with what it was aiming to hit (the source being the firing of the gun itself). Though this method may hinder the distance a bullet can travel, it can still be effective for closer ranges.\nB) Inscribing runes on the projectile itself, having the activation (or the shaper) of the working be the destruction or penetration of the front of the bullet. It is less reliable than method A, though it does not hinder the travel distance of TWEA made using this method. This method uses the same source for the working as method A. \n\nDepending on the working inscribed into the ammunition or a metal cube attached to the ammunition, TWEA can be effective against anything, as long as the thaumatologist inscribing the ammunition is skilled enough and understands the current threats facing active PHYSICS division members and create an apt target for the working.\n\n> //The wizards can take one bullet and do whatever the worst thing you can come up with is cranked to 11.
