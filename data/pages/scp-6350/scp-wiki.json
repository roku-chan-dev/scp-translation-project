Although civilian incursion into SCP-6350's area of effect has shown to be uncommon, individuals are to be deterred from diving near the former location of Judson's mines. Suppression of information regarding Judson's past as a mining town is ongoing and has been largely successful thus far. Falsified information from fake travel blogs created by Foundation agents have been widely circulated online, making it difficult for researchers to find more accurate accounts. With the aid of the United States Fish & Wildlife Service as well as local fishermen, fish populations within Fontana Lake are to be monitored for signs of SCP-6350 infection.\n\nNo confirmed SCP-6350 infections have occurred since the completion of the Fontana Dam and subsequent submerging of Judson on November 7th, 1944. Reassignment of containment class to \"Neutralized\" pending O5 approval.\n\n+ Description\n\nSCP-6350 is an anomalous airborne disease affecting individuals within the coal mines located near Judson, North Carolina. Initial symptoms of SCP-6350 are difficult to distinguish from other diseases or health hazards that arise due to coal mining, including severe coughing fits, strained respiration, chronic exhaustion, and darkening of produced phlegm. Over a period of two to four weeks[[footnote]]Variable depending on how long individuals have been exposed to the source of SCP-6350 and whether or not exposure has ceased.[[/footnote]], individuals suffering from SCP-6350 will find it progressively difficult to breathe due to hardening of the lungs, inhibiting them from performing strenuous activities. This process culminates in respiratory failure and subsequent death when the lungs have become too rigid to expand. Autopsies of individuals affected by SCP-6350 have revealed formation of crystals within the chest cavity from the necrotized remains of the lungs. Analysis of the remains of the tissue has found a marked lack of carbon atoms from within cells. It is currently theorized that SCP-6350 operates by stripping carbon from molecules it comes into contact with, causing structural failure of the cell membrane. Freed carbon atoms are then arranged into the crystals found in the chests of individuals affected by SCP-6350.\n\n+ Original ASCI Documents\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\"]]\n[[image flooded_mine.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\nInterior of Judson coal mines, circa 2020.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Courier;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nCASE SERIAL:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\nO-350;NC-SWA-JUD\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nDATE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n19TH JULY, 1851\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nFILE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nOutgoing document intercepted by ASCI personnel embedded in Postal Service.

He couldn't even stand upright for how hard the cough was wracking his body. I myself saw him hacking up sputum that, for the life of me, I thought could have been coal tar. Fearing an outbreak of the consumption[[footnote]]An antiquated term for the disease caused by //Myobacterium tuberculosis// infection.[[/footnote]], I had him banished from the town. I confess that it may seem a mite cruel, but I was not want for other options. We've no asylum nearby I could send someone with his illness, so the only place that could take him in was the wilderness. I just hope to God that people won't be too up in arms about this. I had an awful tough decision to make, and the burden of sending him off weighs heavy on my mind.\n\nThe fact that this comes just following us ending the use of canaries is troubling. They couldn't seem to handle the atmosphere down there. Something about it just wasn't right with them, so the miners couldn't use them to keep an eye on conditions. They would drop almost as soon as they got too far down in the mine. What's more, they still haven't gotten back to singing. I don't quite know how those boys in the mines taught the canaries to play dead so long, but it's frustrating to no end to know those layabouts are spending more time convincing the canaries to go along with their scheme than they are working the coal I hired them for. It's not like anything I've seen previously. \n\nI don't know how familiar you are with the practice, but the canaries don't ordinarily take to mines this poorly even during a crisis. Ordinarily, they would revive after you got them into the fresh air, but that wasn't the case for these poor critters. It became terribly disheartening to the miners and endlessly frustrating on my part, so we had to ban their use in Judson. I'm not happy that if there's some foul miasma down there, we'd have no way of knowing now, but I did what I had to do.\n\nYou know well I've no memory for addresses or things of that matter. I need you to send word to your eldest brother, Marvin, and see if he or someone he knows can come down and lend us his aid. He's far more familiar with medical matters than I, what with all the time he spent at university. This seems something he's more equipped to handle, and having his aid would free me up to continue my work with the business side of things.\n\nSigned,\nTheodore Dacier\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Courier;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nCASE SERIAL:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\nO-350;NC-SWA-JUD\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nDATE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n7TH AUGUST, 1851\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nFILE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nStatement from miner under employ of Judson Coal Co., Thaddeus Fletcher, taken on 5th August, 1851.

Investigation into Mr. Benner's background found him to have little formal training in medicine, though he spent two years abroad in London that he claimed were spent studying anatomy at Oxford. No records of him having formally attended exist, though some staff claim to have seen him sneaking into classes on occasion.\n\nMr. Benner initially stated to be ignorant of the disappearance of Thaddeus Fletcher's corpse or why such a thing would have occurred. After being informed that ASCI agents had also exhumed Scott Ogilvie's grave and found it similarly lacking a corpse, Mr. Benner became irate and insisted agents depart from his practice.\n\nFollowing detainment of Marvin Benner on 10th January, 1852, and after several hours of interrogation, Mr. Benner confessed to having been involved in the disappearance of the corpses of both Scott Ogilvie and Thaddeus Fletcher. The autopsy report of Thaddeus Fletcher was found within Marvin Benner's medical practice later that day, hidden away in a safe beneath the floorboards. Report stated that Mr. Fletcher's lungs had been \"reduced to naut[sic] greatre[sic] than a bloody pulp resting atop his stomach, from which the esteemed Doctre[sic] produced a numbre[sic] of small diamonds\". It is assumed that the \"stomach\" referenced is actually the diaphragm, not the stomach itself.\n\nMarvin Benner went on to allege the involvement of Theodore Dacier in the scheme, insisting that it was Theodore's idea and he was merely an unwitting participant who had \"no other choice\". According to ASCI agents involved in the interrogation, when asked why he kept the autopsy report at all instead of destroying it, Mr. Benner looked shocked and mumbled that he had not even considered doing so, and that he had assumed nobody would be suspicious of him at all.\n\nTheodore Dacier was subsequently brought in for questioning, and, once shown the autopsy report, immediately complied with ASCI investigations. He asserted that diamonds had also been found in Scott Ogilvie's corpse, and that he had sold the diamonds in a neighboring town. The profits from this sale were used to pay for the lavish residences of himself and Mr. Benner. ASCI agents are currently investigating the sale in order to track down the diamonds in question.\n\nMarvin Benner and Theodore Dacier were released from ASCI custody on the morning of 11th January, 1852; no charges are being filed against either one due to the clandestine nature of ASCI operations and knowledge of happenings under ASCI jurisdiction.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\"]]\n[[image hollywood_home.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\nHome and office of Judson Coal Co. physician Marvin Benner, circa 1854.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Courier;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nCASE SERIAL:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\nO-350;NC-SWA-JUD\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nDATE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n21st September, 1852\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nFILE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nReport from ASCI agent Merriam Hastings on the state of Judson.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nNOTES:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nContact with the ASCI was made by Southern Railway officials on 8th September 1852, alleging a sudden and marked decrease in coal from Judson. Agent Merriam Hastings was sent to investigate, having been made familiar with the case prior to his departure. After arriving on 11th September 1852, Hastings sent a letter detailing growing unrest among the population, noting a \"palpable\" distrust of Judson Coal Co. by residents.\n\nAgent Hastings found that since the previous report on 11th January, 1852, some 73 additional persons had passed away. Reports by Marvin Benner have indicated the manner of death for 66 of these individuals, all of which were employed within the Judson coal mine, to be identical to those of Scott Ogilvie and Thaddeus Fletcher. As per conditions of his release from ASCI custody, he had kept one diamond recovered from each of the bodies before giving the remainder to Theodore Dacier for sale and presented them to Agent Hastings in three mason jars; only 59 diamonds were found to be contained within.\n\nTheodore Dacier evaded contact by Hastings for a period of five days before finally being cornered in his home on 17th September, 1852. When confronted, Mr. Dacier began to weep uncontrollably, expressing that he had been under an immense amount of stress as of recently. He went on to explain that the source of his dismay was rumblings among the people of Judson departing for neighboring towns. Despite the fact that they would not have any funds or even homes without Judson Coal Co. employment, people had grown so fearful of the mines that many refused to go down at all. Theodore had resorted to purchasing slaves from nearby plantation owners, which was significantly cutting into his profits due to the high cost and increasing turnover rate of all persons sent into the mines. While only 66 miners had been reported deceased due to the Judson affliction, these slaves were not included in that number; if they were, the deaths would be well into the hundreds. Both Mr. Benner and Mr. Dacier begged for ASCI intervention to stem the tide of the affliction. Hastings promised he would return as soon as he found a manner of controlling it.\n\nAs there is no known means of controlling the Judson affliction, ASCI efforts are to focus on finding new sources of coal with which to supply Southern Railways. The continued operation of Southern Railways train lines has been deemed far more vital to the economic success of the United States of America than that of Judson Coal Co., and Southern Railways is therefore to take priority when considering courses of action.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\"]]\n[[image miners.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\nMiners of Judson Coal Co., circa September, 1852.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Courier;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nCASE SERIAL:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\nO-350;NC-SWA-JUD\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nDATE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n7th April, 1855\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nFILE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nReport from ASCI agent Merriam Hastings on the state of Judson.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nNOTES:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nJudson Coal Co. filed for bankruptcy on 23rd November, 1854, stating difficulty in profiting from Judson coal mine as the underlying cause. As the ASCI had succeeded in establishing other mines within the southern United States in order to ensure Southern Railways maintained a steady coal supply, Southern Railways became less willing to purchase from Judson Coal Co., electing instead to turn to the new mines for their cheaper coal. Upon returning to Judson, Agent Hastings found no remaining residents; as all stores within Judson had been established by and remained under the operation of Judson Coal Co., they were closed upon the dissolution of the company. With no resources remaining in town, residents were forced to seek other methods and locations to make a living.\n\nAt present, it has been determined that ASCI case O-350;NC-SWA-JUD is unlikely to pose great issue, as there is no reason to go into the Judson coal mine any longer.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Courier;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nCASE SERIAL:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\nO-350;NC-SWA-JUD\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nDATE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n17th July, 1888\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nFILE:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nReport from ASCI agent Thomas Lasserty on the state of Judson.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nNOTES:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nRoutine inspection of the Judson coal mine and surrounding area discovered no less than 12 corpses believed to be related to ASCI case O-350;NC-SWA-JUD. Corpses were in varying states; the majority were nothing more than skeletal remains accompanied by a small pile of diamonds situated beneath the ribcage, four of which bore the tattered remains of uniforms of Confederate soldiers. Only three of the deceased are believed to have succumbed to the Judson affliction within the previous year, two of which may have been in the mine together at the time of death. None of the deceased have been identified, but investigation has revealed rumors of unclaimed riches within Judson among residents of surrounding areas.

Construction of a hydroelectric dam on the Little Tennessee River has already been proposed by other United States government agencies both state and federal; it has been proposed that water from the Little Tennessee River could be redirected such that Judson is within the bounds of the resultant lake.\n\nConstruction on Fontana Dam is to begin 1st January, 1942. Upon completion of the dam and successful submerging of Judson, ASCI case O-350;NC-SWA-JUD will be officially closed.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6349]]] | SCP-6350 | [[[SCP-6351]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** fontana_lake_2.jpg\n> **Name:** Lake behind Fontana Dam\n> **Author:** jatdoll\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/12407269@N07/2517015112\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** underwater_church.jpg\n> **Name:** underwater church\n> **Author:** JunCTionS\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/17333088@N00/2937692939\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** underwater_building.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Mostly submerged building in Thistle, Utah, Jul 15\n> **Author:** An Errant Knight\n> **License:** CC BY 4.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=59747730\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** apartment_building.jpg\n> **Name:** Apartment Building\n> **Author:** anyjazz65\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/49024304@N00/2123060817\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** flooded_mine.jpg\n> **Name:** Flooded coal mine\n> **Author:** Gerry T\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/99326392@N00/7975424619\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** hollywood_home.jpg\n> **Name:** Exterior view of Paul deLongpre residence and garden, Hollywood Boulevard and Cahuenga Avenue, Hollywood, ca.1910 (CHS-5041)\n> **Author:** Fæ\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/50398299@N08/15999878484\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** miners.jpg\n> **Name:** Owd miners 19th century\n> **Author:** b3tarev3\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/28310050@N02/5048542288\n=====\n=====\n> **Filename:** fontana_dam.jpg\n> **Name:** Fontana Dam\n> **Author:** Tennessee Valley Authority\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0.\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/48020599@N04/9258163692\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
