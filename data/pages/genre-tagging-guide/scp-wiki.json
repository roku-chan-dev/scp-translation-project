  "content": "[[f>toc]]\n\nIf you are reading this, you are likely interested in helping to apply Genre tags to fiction on the site. There are Genre and Setting tags that can be applied to [[[scp-series| SCPs]]], [[[foundation-tales| Tales]]] or [[[GoI formats]]], as well as Style tags that are only applicable to tales. Additionally, [[[series-archive| Series Hubs]]], which have the hidden [/system:page-tags/tag/_tale-hub _tale-hub tag], may be given the genre and setting tags that best describe the series as a whole.\n\n+ The Rules to Follow\n\nUnlike other tags, which are an objective description of an article, the genre of a work is inherently subjective. To remedy this, we take the author's word as the final source of authority on an article.\n\n++* The Golden Rule: The author has the final word on what genre and theme tags apply to an article.\n\nThe second key thing to understand is that genre and theme tags are fundamentally for navigation and discovery. Thus, in case of uncertainty:\n\n++* The Secondary Rule: If you are uncertain about if a tag should be applied, ask if someone who was searching specifically for that tag would be interested in that article. \n\nWhen tagging for genre and themes, the aim is to apply the most relevant tags for describing the work, not necessarily everything that could apply. Subtags require the parent tag, so tales will be tagged with both //horror// and //body-horror// or //comedy// and //black-comedy// when appropriate.\n\n++* You don't need to tag everything that could apply, just whatever you see based on your best judgement.\n\nFinally, when it comes to new articles, you can tag for genre and themes. However, the objective components (characters, groups, series, and canons) are best left to the tagging team; we identify untagged articles by a lack of these top level tags.\n\n++* If you are tagging a new article, please don't add the //scp//, //tale// or //goi-format// tags specifically, and let tagging do that part.\n\nPlease see the [[[a-laymen-s-guide-to-tagging| tagging guide]]] for details on these other types of tags.\n\n+ Who can tag articles\n\nWhile we do limit the number of people who can tag articles, this list is very broad and applies to most people who have interacted with the site in any meaningful capacity.\n\nThe following users can tag articles:\n\n* Any user with one successful page on the site.\n* Any user who has had an idea fully greenlit (two greenlights).\n* Any user who has passed a crit flight or has greenlight permissions for some other reason.\n* Site Staff.\n* Former staff in good standing.\n* Any user a member of site staff deems capable of doing so (see https://05command.wikidot.com/staff-list for a list of all staff).\n\n+ Where to start\n\nIf you are an author, we recommend that you start with your own articles. If all of your articles are all tagged, or if you are not an author, please check [[[workbench:tale-tagging|here]]] for a list of untagged tales, and [[[workbench:goi-format-tagging|here]]] for a list of untagged GoI Formats.\n\nIf an article you want to tag is locked, please contact a site moderator as seen in [[[system:members]]]. The best way to do this is to make a request on the official SCP discord (https://discord.com/invite/scp) or the official SCP staff discord (https://discord.gg/efrnKZxVZB). Alternatively, sending a wikidot PM to a moderator with a list of tags for an article is allowed.\n\n+ Tags and their definitions\n\n++ Genre\n\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/absurdism absurdism]** -- Absurdist fiction depicts events lacking any rational explanation or meaning, for the purpose of shock or comedy.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/action action]** -- Focuses on exciting events and spectacular violence.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/adventure adventure]** -- Focuses on the exploration of unfamiliar environments.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/bittersweet bittersweet]** -- Intended to evoke both positive and negative emotions. \n * This is intended for articles that mix elements of both the bleak and heartwarming tags, and generally only one of them should be applied to a work.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/bleak bleak]** -- Intended to evoke negative emotions, focusing on anguish, distress and suffering.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/breakout breakout]** -- Focuses on containment breaches and escaping from imprisonment, both attempted and successful.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/comedy comedy]** -- Intended to be funny.\n * **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/black-comedy black-comedy]** -- Depicts shocking or unpleasant situations for the purpose of humour.\n  * Applying this tag requires the \"comedy\" tag.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/chase chase]** -- Focuses on pursuit or escape.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/crime-fiction crime-fiction]** -- Focuses on criminals and law enforcement.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/fantasy fantasy]** -- Depicts magic and the supernatural, inspired by myth, legend and folklore.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/heartwarming heartwarming]** -- Intended to evoke positive emotions, focusing on pleasant experiences and supportive relationships.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/horror horror]** -- Intended to evoke fear, shock or disgust in the reader.\n * **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/body-horror body-horror]** -- Focuses on physical mutilation or transformation.\n * **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/cosmic-horror cosmic-horror]** -- focuses on human insignificance and irrelevance, with emphasis on the unknowable and incomprehensible.\n * **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/psychological-horror psychological-horror]** -- focuses on psychological distress and emotional vulnerability.\n  * Applying any of these tags requires the \"horror\" tag.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/metafiction metafiction]** -- Fiction about fiction, referencing the work's fictional nature. May feature fiction affecting reality, characters entering or leaving works of fiction, and characters being aware that they are fictional or are influenced by narrative tropes.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/military-fiction military-fiction]** -- Focuses on soldiers, field agents or mercenaries.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/mystery mystery]** -- Focuses on investigation of unanswered questions.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/romance romance]** -- Focuses on romantic relationships between characters.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/science-fiction science-fiction]** -- Depicts advanced science and technology. May feature scientific analysis of phenomena currently thought to be impossible.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/slice-of-life slice-of-life]** -- Offers a look into the everyday lives of characters, with a focus on the mundane.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/spy-fiction spy-fiction]** -- Focuses on espionage, counter-intelligence, double agents or assassination.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/surrealism surrealism]** -- Surrealist fiction creates a dream-like story by juxtaposing the mundane with the impossible and irrational, with emphasis on subconscious associations between them.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/xenofiction xenofiction]** -- Told from a non-human perspective, such as an alien, an animal, a monster or a machine.\n * The emphasis is on the perspective being inhuman - [[[scp-1867| Lord Blackwood]]] doesn't count, he has a [[[new| surprisingly human perspective]]] for a sea slug, but stories from the point of view of [[[exhibitionist-fantasising| SCP-173]]] or [[[jot-it-down| Josie the Half-Cat]]] are examples of this genre.\n\n++ Themes\n\nDescribes the major themes of an article. Articles may have multiple themes, but they should all play an important role in the story, rather than just being briefly mentioned.\n\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/artificial-intelligence artificial-intelligence]** -- Focuses on artificial intelligence, and on anomalies that have AI or affect AIs.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/bureaucracy bureaucracy]** -- Focuses on the administration, management and official procedures of an organisation.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/ghost ghost]** -- Focuses on ghosts, also known as spectral entities.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/historical historical]** -- Focuses on historical events, or on anomalies with historical significance.\n * This may overlap with 'period-piece' if an article is set in the past, although many historical works are instead set in the present or an unspecified time period, but still describe notable events that occured in the past.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/legal legal]** -- Focuses on law, legal proceedings, and legal documents.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/lgbtq lgbtq]** -- Focuses on LGBTQ+ themes, culture or history. Possible examples include portrayal of gay and lesbian relationships, depiction of asexuality and bisexuality, and exploration of trans, queer and agender identities.\n * If an article has an incidental gay couple or a character who goes by neopronouns, but the story does not explore those concepts, it likely should not be tagged LGBTQ (except by the story's author).\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/murder-monster murder-monster]** -- Focuses on an inhuman anomaly that is hostile to human life.\n * This term typically refers to classic Series I monsters like [[[SCP-173]]], [[[SCP-682]]] and [[[SCP-939]]], but it can be applied to any SCP, tale or GoI Format that focuses on a monster that attacks and kills people.\n * //Often used with 'horror'// \n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/mythological mythological]** -- Focuses on creatures, events and practices drawn from mythology and folklore, outside of structured religious practice.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/political political]** -- Focuses on politicians, diplomats or the political process.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/religious-fiction religious-fiction]** -- Focuses on religion, faith and belief. Includes depictions of real-world religions, as well as worship of anomalous entities.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/superhero superhero]** -- Focuses on superheroes or supervillains. These characters typically have secret identities, costumes and supernatural powers.\n\n++ Setting\nThe following tags describe settings associated with particular genres. Additional genre tags from the list above will likely apply as well.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/afterlife afterlife]** -- Describes or is otherwise related to what happens to consciousness after death.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/alternate-history alternate-history]** -- Depicts historical events that diverge from how they happened in real life. This tag only applies for when there is a divergence in history as known to the general public - otherwise this would apply to all tales on the Wiki, given that there is not a massive global conspiracy to hide the supernatural in real life. Additionally, any events occurring in the future are not alternative history. To give some specific examples:\n  * [/system:page-tags/tag/7th-occult-war The Seventh Occult War] does not count as Alternate History, as World War II still looks normal to most people, despite the use of anomalous weapons.\n  * [[[broken-masquerade-hub| Broken Masquerade]]] is alternative history, as things do look dramatically different once the Foundation is unveiled. \n  * [[[unfounded-hub|Unfounded]]], in which the Foundation never existed, does not usually get the alternate history tag, as the premise is that the world largely looks the same.\n  * [[[ad-astra-per-aspera-hub| Ad Astra Per Aspera]]] is set in the future, and so does not count as alternate history.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/apocalyptic apocalyptic]** -- Takes place during or shortly before a catastrophic event.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/post-apocalyptic post-apocalyptic]** -- Takes place after a catastrophic event.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/christmas christmas]** -- Set during or influenced by the holiday of Christmas.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/corporate corporate]** -- Focuses on the operations of a business or corporation.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/dystopian dystopian]** -- Imagines a non-existent society or culture, portrayed as being much worse than our current one.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/halloween halloween]** -- Set during or influenced by the holiday of Halloween.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/otherworldly otherworldly]** -- Set in another world, reality, or universe. Includes works that are entirely set somewhere other than Earth, as well as portal fantasy fiction featuring travel to another world.\n * When used on SCPs or in reference to specific SCPs, they will often either be [https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/extradimensional extradimensional] or [https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/extraterrestrial extraterrestrial].\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/period-piece period-piece]** -- Set during a specific period in the past.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/school school]** -- Focuses on a school, college or university, or on the education system more broadly.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/space-opera space-opera]** -- Depicts a futuristic society in outer space or on other planets, focusing on dramatic events and adventures.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/utopian utopian]** -- Imagines a non-existent society or culture, portrayed as being much better than our current one.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/western western]** -- Set in the American Frontier, during the time period known as the Wild West.\n\n++ Major Page Tags\nThe following tags are not genre tags, but may also be applied to articles when appropriate.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/comic comic]** -- For stories that are primarily told via sequential art.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/illustrated illustrated]** -- Features an original artwork specifically made for the article. This includes photobashes and other forms of photo manipulation. This tag should be replaced by comic if the illustration takes the form of a comic.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/poetry poetry]** -- Applicable if the page consists significantly of a form of poetry, with elements such as meter and rhyme.\n\n++ Style\nThe following tags describe how the tale is conveyed. Note that these tags are only applicable to tales, unlike the earlier genre and setting tags.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/first-person first-person]** -- Told from a //first-person// perspective (\"I did\").\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/second-person second-person]** -- Told from a //second-person// perspective (\"you did\").\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/no-dialogue no-dialogue]** -- Contains no spoken dialogue.\n* **[https://scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/correspondence correspondence]** -- Told in large part though written communications between characters, including letters, emails, text messages or social media posts.

Used to identify which articles need to be tagged, versus those that are not taggable. Apply this tag if none of the definitions listed above apply to the article.\n\n+ FAQ\n\n++ I don't want genre tags on my work\n\nIf this is the case, apply the _genreless tag, as this indicates to our taggers that you do not want your work genre tagged.",
