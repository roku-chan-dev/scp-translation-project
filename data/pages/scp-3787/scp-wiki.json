This measure exists to ensure:\n\n# That horse breeding continues as a controlled element.\n# That further progression of the anomaly can be mitigated.\n\nAnalysts are to track domesticated horse populations for anomalous behaviours such as uncharacteristic or unprovoked aggression, deviance from feeding habits, and deviance from natural breeding cycles. Known feral horse populations are to be monitored for abnormal activity.\n\nTo maintain the well-being of baseline horses, personnel are to avoid sterilization efforts within current populations and any restrictive actions taken to manage overpopulation. Instead, personnel are to disperse hormonal agent 762988-16-7 within horse populations. 762988-16-7 targets horse endocrine systems to promote docility and extend breeding cycles.\n\nNo known means of containing SCP-3787-ε exist at present.

Within affected mares, the baseline gestation period of 11–12 months shortens to 30–45 days from conception to birth. As a result, up to 10 times as many foals are born. Growth rates of this size are unsustainable and constitute a significant risk to the equine industry's ability to maintain control.\n\nThis breeding cycle does not adversely affect pregnant mares or resultant newborn foals. Newborn foals exhibit physiological properties similar to their non-anomalous counterparts. Foals also develop within pregnant mares despite lacking the necessary sustenance over the accelerated developmental period.\n\n**SCP-3787-1** is an anomalous increase in horse aggression in free-roaming horse populations. Examples of aggression include:\n\n* Unprovoked hostilities toward horses outside a constituent pack.\n* The active killing of most or all members of a feral horse pack by that pack's dominant stallion.\n* The cannibalization of foals as a show of dominance.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=wild-horses.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Horses displaying SCP-3787-1 behaviour while hunting for prey. Image captured remotely. _\n _\n(Hover to enlarge.)\n]]\n\nIncrease in horse hostility has also extended into normal horse feeding patterns. Feral horse packs affected by this anomaly perform organized attacks on other wildlife, escalating to a point in which affected horses ignore herbivorous feeding habits. These attacks occur even though horse jaw structures and digestive systems are biologically unsuited for meat consumption. This manner of aggression has contributed to the advancement of horses to the top of the food chain in many areas.\n\nSCP-3787-1 began in newborn foals affected by SCP-3787. It has since transferred to an unknown number of horse populations of various ages, according to a geometric infection model. In addition, this anomaly has developed in the same period and area as a memetic form of equinophobia, designated SCP-3787-ε.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] **equinophobia:** An irrational fear of horses. [[/span]]\n\n**SCP-3787-ε** is an intense fear of horses in humans without previous basis to do so. Researchers hypothesize SCP-3787-ε manifested because of a marked increase of horse population numbers, which caused an increase of equine concepts in the human consciousness. Persons may be unaware they have been affected by this anomaly until their re-exposure to the concept of horses through forms of media or personal conversations that reference horses.\n\nSCP-3787-ε occurs in suburban areas, urban centres, and within populations far from rural communities. More specifically, SCP-3787-ε occurs within populations with little access to the equine.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Domesticated stud farms are an example of a resource unreachable to populations in these kinds of communities. Populations interested in thoroughbred horseracing remain unaffected [[/span]]\n\nAn estimated 750 000 persons within the continental United States have contracted this anomaly.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++* ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n= **I.

In the 2 months since detecting the anomaly, more than 450 000 new horses were born in the United States alone.\n\nOn 12 July, Parazoology Division personnel observed what they hypothesized was an anomalous illness spreading throughout domesticated horse populations. Horses affected by this illness experienced a period of acute stress and entered a comatose state. In 18% of instances, affected horses later expired. An estimated 37% of horses in the Southern and Southwestern United States have been afflicted with this illness.\n\nAs of 29 August, research efforts into a vaccine have proved ineffective.\n----\n@@ @@\n= **II. Project: DIRE HORSE**\n@@ @@\n\nThe accelerated spread of this illness has caused the death of ~1.1 million horses in the United States. In response, [[[scp-4758|Site-82]]] — in conjunction with the Scientific Department — has published two reports on Project: DIRE HORSE to the IntSCPFN network.\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"centered\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Project: DIRE HORSE ◁\" hide=\"△ Close △\"]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n+++ SUMMARY OF PROJECT: DIRE HORSE\n----\n[[div class=\"justified\"]]\n[[f<image https://i.postimg.cc/rcM7YdDC/deptsci.png style=\"width: 8em;\"]]\n\nProject: DIRE HORSE outlines the production of a significant horse population and the dissemination of this new population across the United States. This is to be conducted to mitigate the ongoing loss of horse populations and produce a phenotype resistant to the effects of the anomalous illness.\n\nTo achieve this goal, DIRE HORSE has employed the use of Ashleigh's Fields: A cattle farm in Newton News, Montana. Ashleigh's Fields has been working under the Foundation front company Stratford Cattle Productions since 2010. Ashleigh's Fields uses an industrial farming facility responsible for the mass production of synthetic livestock in place of modern farming techniques.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=factory-farm.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Ashleigh's Fields factory farm. _\n _\n(Hover to enlarge.)\n]]\n\nDIRE HORSE will use the Rimmer–Lister Hippological Simulacrum (or RLHS) prototype. The RLHS can produce 500 artificially grown adult horses (or 1 000 foals) per 6-hr period, within 99.91% genetic similarity of their natural counterparts. Horses produced by the RLHS undergo behavioural engineering and memetic hardening to reduce the potential effects of an SCP-3787-1 spread into its population.\n\nIn a runaway equine extinction event, the RLHS and its sentinel facility at Ashleigh's Fields can store up to 100 000 stable horses in cryogenic storage for up to a decade.\n\nTo reduce general awareness of the full spread of the equine illness, DIRE HORSE is to promptly begin replacing horse populations in 35 U.S. states.

Each 3787-//N// instance is composed of malleable cartilage integrated with groupings of musculature typical of horses. One defining feature is its horse-like cranium, which consists of a muzzle capable of equine vocalizations. Naturally occurring braided horsehair is present in the form of a mane and tail. Each strand of hair is autonomous; 3787-//N// efforts to control hair movement often appear laboured, and seem unsuccessful.\n\nThough 3787-//N// possesses dull, rounded teeth, it has been observed to engage in carnivorous activities and consume humans -- albeit rarely. Instead of feeding for sustenance, instances choose to hunt for recreation.\n\nAll 3787-//N// appendages are capable of contorting, elongating, and wrapping around themselves. In acts of defence, 3787-//N// will balloon its body outward. Instances will also mount one another, combining in tandem with the formation of wheel-like anatomical structures to use their collective body mass as a moving vehicle. When this occurs, velocities of up to 150 km/hr have been observed.\n\nSightings of 3787-//N// occur in nocturnal settings. 3787-//N// is a pack predator, appearing in groups ranging between five and 50 instances. These groups typically manifest near domestic or thoroughbred horse farms and feral horse packs.\n\n3787-//N// display a strong revulsion to most forms of visible light and experience physical damage on exposure. The Task Forces Commander at Site-82 advises any personnel in the vicinity of 3787-//N// instances to carry any form of light-based weaponry available.\n\nNo other means of damaging 3787-//N// have been observed at present.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\nContainment analysts at Site-82 have come to infer a complex relationship among the appearances of 3787-//N// and previous equine anomalies. Analysts conclude that the emergence of increased equine aggression and accelerated birth rates was, in part, a widespread anomalous defence mechanism tailored toward the repulsion of 3787-//N//.\n\nCurrent reports show that this behaviour has almost reversed, in part because of the emergence and influence of 3787-//N// -- which horses now act subservient toward.\n\nResearch Director Elliot Alces has approved the reclassification of SCP-3787 to an ARCHON-Class anomaly.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] **ARCHON-Class:** Designates anomalies that can be contained but ought not to, because of the damage that would be caused by doing so.

Contact by any non-equine populations has led to confrontational behaviour on the part of 3787-//N//.\n\nFoundation personnel managing the effects of SCP-3787 also face aggression.
