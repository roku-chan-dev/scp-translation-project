He found the Chair on a couch, under a blanket, facing a television. The Chair of Research and Experimentation was under the blanket with him. She was blowing on his ear and saying \"make it stop,\" or perhaps she was mouthing it; either way, McInnis couldn't hear her, because there were bizarre grunts and groans coming from the television. He wondered if they were watching a documentary about vomiting bears.\n\n\"Hey,\" Harold Blank waved. He raised the remote, and thumbed the pause button.\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" McInnis smiled. He hefted a pair of boxes. \"Where should I put these?\"\n\nMelissa Bradbury pointed. \"Merry Christmas. In front of the speakers, please. Cover them up as best you can.\"\n\n\"On the side table is fine,\" Harry grinned. \"Yours is under the tree, as usual. What's up with the special delivery?\"\n\nMcInnis set the presents down and strolled over to get a better look at the television. It was displaying some footage that looked like it came from the seventies, very badly preserved, a cheap sitcom set populated entirely by walking heaps of seaweed. \"Going for the personal touch this year,\" he said. \"Change of pace.\"\n\nBradbury scooched aside, squashing Harry against his arm rest. She patted the newly vacated cushion. \"Watch this garbage with us.

In any case, of all his personnel, he trusted her the most to make the right decisions for herself.\n\nHe left her gift under the tree.

There were three women sitting on it, legs draped over each other so that they formed a sort of chittering duodecipus with three distinct heads. They were all wearing the same ugly Christmas sweater. It hung loosely off Rozálie Astrauskas; it was under such strain on Delfina Ibanez that McInnis could see the colour of the undershirt she was wearing through the separated threads.\n\nIbanez raised a pair of lemon yellow video game controllers in his direction. \"Mario Kart?\"\n\nTheir faces were flushed with excitement and, no doubt, the contents of the bottles neatly stacked beside the couch. Howard Yancy was managing both internal and external security today; he'd divorced his wife that year, and didn't feel much like making merry. Applied Occultism was taking the day off, because pagan holidays almost always interfered with their experimental results. These three spent most of their free time together, even slept in the same room most days, but they rarely got long stretches where all were off duty simultaneously. They were making the most of this one.\n\nIt reminded him of failure, nevertheless, because the fact that they were sitting here getting drunk and playing video games was related to the fact that they were the youngest members of his senior staff.\n\nAnd they were in their mid-forties.\n\n//I'll do better, Vivian,// he thought. //I __am__ doing better.//\n\n\"I'd only slow you down,\" he smiled, setting down the three neatly-wrapped presents on the dining nook table.\n\n\"That's not how racing games work.\" Ibanez stretched. \"It's competitive.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" He ambled back to the door. \"I'm not very competitive.\"\n\n\"Neither are these two,\" Ibanez crowed.

He was alone in the little lab in AAF-A where the direct link to SCP-5520 was kept under lock and key, a secret to everyone but his most trusted staff and the Overseers who allowed the old reality bender to remain alone and dissociated in his vast refinery beneath their feet. Most of Vroom's technicians weren't working today, since most of the Site's computers were either switched off or performing the kind of work that didn't need much, if any, human intervention. McInnis therefore had this entire wing of the facility to himself, and that made the visceral strangeness of finding Rydderech so uncharacteristically lucid hit even harder.\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nHow do you know my name, sir?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke wynn\"]]\nI know all your names.

Did Reynders have loved ones? She'd certainly been close with the chief technician, and she was presently squeezing him under his Christmas sweater, and the man's own nose and cheeks were rosy without the apparent application of any makeup. McInnis had always been--\n\nReynders had seen him at the door, swung Vroom around, detached from him, and catapulted herself into the Director's waiting arms. She threw hers around his neck -- they were neither of them very tall -- and gave him a squeeze so tight he could feel his windpipe constricting.\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Allan,\" she said directly into his ear. She had the presence of mind to lower her voice.\n\n\"Merry Christmas.\" He felt he would not easily become tired of seeing her happy, surrounded by other people in close proximity. She had earned it a thousandfold, and needed it even more. She was unlikely to leave the party until it broke up early the next morning.\n\nVroom smiled apologetically at him over her shoulder. He smiled back, as warmly as he was able, and returned the immortal polymath's embrace.\n\nIn the end he was only able to extricate himself by telling her to retrieve her present from his jumper pocket.

He wouldn't be the only one to make the connection, and she would have had a steady stream of visitors from amongst the senior staff as the afternoon wore on. He told himself there was nothing sad about the fact that she was spending her Christmas alone in the Administration and Oversight offices. Obviously someone had to do it. Someone needed to be responsible, be on call in case anything happened. She was essentially Site Director for the day.\n\nUnder different circumstances, he might have thought about retiring and giving her a go at the job for real.\n\nBut duty was duty, and all he could give her instead, today, was the benefit of his presence and presents. Considering the year she'd had, he figured she could use one extra. Karmic compensation.\n\nShe came down from the daïs to talk to him. She wouldn't have been able to see him comfortably over the top of her desk. \"Doing the rounds?\"\n\nHe handed her the gifts. \"Yes. Everything in order?\"\n\nShe shrugged, accepting the packages and standing on the tips of her fancy shoes to slide them onto her elevated desktop. \"Dead as a doornail. Nothing internal, nothing external. Nothing so much as a peep out of law enforcement or national defence. The whole world's taking the day off, apparently.\"\n\n\"That's good.\" She was meeting his gaze, so he noticed when hers flickered. \"Isn't it?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, of course it's good. We don't need any disturbances today.\"\n\nHe could almost have believed her, if he'd wanted to.\n\nHe checked his watch. \"You know, I've seen a lot of our people already. I could use a break. What say I mind the store for an hour? You could check in at the party.\"\n\nShe arched a brow. \"And do what?\"\n\n\"And do what...?\" He chuckled. \"Whatever people do at parties, I suppose.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Go on.\"\n\nHe blinked.\n\nShe didn't. \"Go on, Allan,\" she repeated. \"What do people do at parties?\"\n\nHe suddenly wished, in the space of an instant, that he'd been singing and dancing and swinging a partner through the lobby. It would have given him an excuse to stumble into an embrace with her -- simply that, an embrace, nothing more. He had never wanted more, would never want more, but for an instant he wanted precisely that very much indeed. But he was not dancing. He did not dance. And neither did she. And neither of them ever would, because that was not who either of them were.\n\nShe reached out with both hands, took his shoulders, and squeezed them once each. \"Merry Christmas, Allan.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Karen,\" he said to her back as she returned to her desk.

For some of the staff, this was something of a shock; the last thing they'd heard was that she'd been sent away for some sort of act of treason, the kind of thing many senior staff members ran afoul of after too many years of doings in the dark. People didn't usually come back from that. But the people who did tended to come back bigger and better, as Veiksaar did, so that somewhat softened the blow of seeing her again. She had been graduated from the Site's chief technical officer to the Ethics Committee Liaison, and that meant she could wear something other than an antistatic jumper and keep hours defined by the shift schedule and not the network downtime schema. The change suited her.\n\nBut Veiksaar's break with protocol had given the Council cause to doubt her commitment to the cause, and it seemed like her old co-workers could sense the cloud of suspicion that encircled her now. She was one of the first cracks in Site-43's façade of compliance with the Foundation's more pragmatic methodology. In short, Allan was worried that after nine months in her new post, she was still isolated. She had never been the most social of creatures to begin with, and after all, the last thing that had happened in the previous stage of her career was one of her oldest friends tidily entrapping and neutralizing her. The adjustment could not have been easy, and might still be ongoing.\n\nHe found her dormitory door ajar, but knocked anyway. There was no response, but the door did slide open just a little further. There were sounds of struggle from within.\n\nThere were not, on reflection, sounds of struggle, precisely, from within.\n\nHe looked down, instinctively, and saw a note on the welcome mat next to a hideous bright green neck tie.\n\nIt read:\n\n> Leave it on the floor. Leave mine, too, if you brought it.\n> Yours is in your office.\n> Merry Christmas!\n> D.S.\n\nMcInnis had locked his office.

They made an unusual pair; Kuroki looked haggard and worn on his best days, while Du had never visibly aged past somewhere around thirty. The security chief was taciturn, soft-spoken and slow-burning, while the Chair of Quantum Supermechanics was a caricature of excitability. Right now they were both subdued, however, because there was apparently a formal dinner happening in the next room.\n\n\"So that's an entire branch of my family that will never speak to me again,\" Du was telling him happily. \"Nanjing was namedropped at the dinner table. My uncle says I've shamed every man in my family tree. Do people really think that's leverage? Extended relations are basically just walking obligations. I didn't want to have to RSVP their stupid weddings anyway.\"\n\nKuroki was obviously stifling laughter. It looked strange on him, but not bad. When Du stopped talking for an moment, probably to take a breath, he cut in. \"Nine of those twelve people,\" and he jerked a thumb at the closed door in the sumptuously appointed bedroom, \"are his family. I've got my mother and two sisters. We left them alone in there.\"\n\nMcInnis smiled sympathetically. \"Give my regards, should they survive.\" Du guffawed. \"Did your presents arrive?\"\n\nKuroki nodded. \"The Dus were furious. They're traditional. They think Christmas is just western commercialism.\"\n\n\"Which it is,\" Du added. \"One of my cousins works in a Walmart export warehouse in Guangdong. I said the word 'Christmas' in her presence, //once,// and she almost slapped me.\"\n\n\"So that's the situation,\" Kuroki said. He didn't smile -- ever, really -- but the corners of his eyes did crinkle up a bit. \"We're still waiting to find out which one's homophobic. Right now they're all tripped up on being racist or anti-capitalist, but the afternoon's still young.\"\n\n\"They might all be homophobic,\" Du mused. \"Do you want to bet?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Kuroki rummaged below the camera view, and came up with a bulging sack. \"Let's wager apples. Every god damn person I've talked to today has given me an apple. I have no use for all these apples.\"\n\n\"I'll leave you to your crass commercialism, then.\" McInnis smiled at them each in turn. \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" they responded in unison.

Assorted well-wishers, and one notification: a package left for her under the cafeteria tree.\n\nShe smiled. It was sweet, but he needn't have bothered with the reminder.\n\nOf course she was headed there anyway.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n+ ##red|12##\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nHarry wasn't at all surprised to find, when he and his wife waltzed into the cafeteria just after midnight, that very nearly the entirety of Site-43's senior staff was already assembled. A dozen warm, embarrassed smiles passed between friends as they mixed and mingled, trading gifts. \n\nAllan's gifts, which in redelivery, kept on giving.\n\nMelissa slipped away to approach Sokolsky, so he headed to the table where Lillian and Zwist had been sitting for most of the evening. She was now lying on top of it, softly snoring. He fastened his fingers over her face, and shook it roughly until she started spluttering into his palm.\n\n\"Whguh,\" she spat. \"Hrhunh. What.\"\n\n\"Merry Christmas,\" he said, and he bent down and gave her the most awkward hug of all time. When it was done, he presented her with the gift Allan had dropped off earlier in the day, which Harry had just finished unwrapping: a true atomic watch in stainless steel, Temporal Anomalies special issue, with a tag attached. Lillian blearily squinted at it, then wordlessly passed it back for him to read.\n\nHe read, \"For Lillian, who is precise to the picosecond: a mirror.\"\n\nHer eyes watered as she snatched it from him, and laboriously affixed it to her wrist. It wasn't the right wrist, but try telling her anything. She reached behind her head and pulled out another unwrapped box. \"Who's mine for?\" she burbled. \"Can't read.\"\n\nIt was a tiny little portable video game machine from a company called Togenkyo, Game and Watch style, with a name in Japanese and 90s-looking art depicting ants on a motor car track. The tag dedicated it to \"Hashiro, with whom I ran my only race.\"\n\nKuroki was in China still, with Du, so that would have to wait. He resolved to lie instead, in the spirit of the gift's intention. He cast his eyes over the crowd, and noticed just by chance the little grey-haired man standing alone on the hallway side of the main entrance, arms crossed over his jumper, watching the little engagements with obvious pleasure. Melissa was laughing at something Sokolsky had said, or perhaps at how silly he looked in the high-tech glasses she'd been given to give to him. Yancy was holding a book, obviously holding back tears, and Noor Zaman was clapping him on the back, wearing mittens that looked at least two sizes too big. The All-Sections Chief (who had passed them on the way, saying he could only stop by for a moment) was admiring a tie clip that caught the light just //so,// made from the stuff of dreams and worth perhaps a medium fortune. Karen was admiring it too, as she cinched a vest around her chest that Harry recognized from the days when McInnis had managed Procurement and Liquidation. He wasn't sure what he wanted to see first: her reaction when she found out what it did, or the Director's excuse for giving it to her.\n\nBut the latter would be easier, because he turned back to Lillian and said \"Yours is for Allan. I'll go grab him.\"\n\nIt was a near thing, but he got to the door before spooking his target. Unable to withdraw gracefully, the faintest hint of gratefulness in his eyes, Allan McInnis allowed himself to be drawn into the heart of the party he had started.\n\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-tomorrow-hub | Wrong Tomorrow]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadlined-hub The Breach Goes On: Deadlined]** >>\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Everything!\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
