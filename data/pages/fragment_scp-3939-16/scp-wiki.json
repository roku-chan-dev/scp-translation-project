A researcher is to be assigned to classify it as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** None yet available.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nWhatever this thing is, it needs a description, and you'll be damned if you're going to write it yourself. You're a Class 4 Senior Researcher, damn it! There's no such thing as a Class 3 Senior Researcher.\n\nYou grab your communicator from your pocket and dial in Carlos' ID.\n\n> **3939-Alpha:** Dr. Rodriguez, are you there?\n> \n> **3939-Gamma:** Dr. ████████. I'm here.\n> \n> **3939-Alpha:** I need you to get down here and log a description for 3939.\n\nYou begin walking back to your office.\n\n> **3939-Gamma:** Got it. Is there anything else?\n> \n> **3939-Alpha:** Give me some basic containment procedures while you're at it.\n> \n> **3939-Alpha:** Now, please.\n> \n> **3939-Gamma:** Heading down there now. It'll be on your desk first thing in the morning.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/61 Thanks, Carlos.
