If new personnel are found to be SCP-6821-H instances, they are to be warned of the potential risks of catching SCP-6821-V and, if applicable, are to be offered relocation from a Central American facility to one in a different region.--\n\n--SCP-6821-H instances found to be infected with SCP-6821-V are to be immediately relocated to the closest Foundation facility for immediate treatment. Financial compensation is to be offered to the infected instance.--\n\n--The Department of Anomalous Weapons Development, in collaboration with the Medicinal Department, is currently working on developing potential cures and vaccines for SCP-6821-H.-- SCP-6821 is currently under the jurisdiction of the Global Occult Coalition and Manna Charitable Foundation.

[[/footnote]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-6821 referred to a subspecies of fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe elicere//) found in the Central American region. SCP-6821 was most prevalent in the nations of Costa Rica, Panama, and Nicaragua, where concentrations of their populations could be found. SCP-6821 instances were humanoid in shape, but were capable of some limited polymorphism. Regardless of sex, SCP-6821 instances generally appeared similar to a human female, only differing in appearance by having a head that resembles that of a decomposing equine.\n\nSCP-6821 is considered extinct as of November of 2021, as a direct result of SCP-6821-V. It is unknown if any instances of SCP-6821 are still living, but none have been spotted since September 2021.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/cegua/hugo.jpg\n|caption= Hugo Berganza, the first known SCP-6821-H instance.\n|width=300px\n]]\n\nSCP-6821-H refers to the crossbreed between SCP-6821 instances and baseline humans. Aside from a natural adeptness with thaumaturgy and limited polymorphism in some cases, SCP-6821-H instances display no apparent differences from baseline humans. It is believed SCP-6821-H first came into existence shortly after colonial officials in Central America stopped using SCP-6821 instances in the 17th Century. Due to their descendence from SCP-6821, SCP-6821-H instances are vulnerable to infection by SCP-6821-V.\n\nSCP-6821-V is a genetically engineered virus constructed by AWD. SCP-6821-V was designed specifically to cull or outright exterminate the SCP-6821 population in Central America. The virus would accomplish this by converting an infectee's hemocyte into pure iron, which is lethal to fae creatures. While still lethal in SCP-6821-H instances, SCP-6821-V works at a much slower rate in them.\n\n**Addendum 6821.9:** Discovery of SCP-6821-H\n\nSCP-6821-H was first discovered after the release of SCP-6821-V. In December of 2020, INCA contacted Area-34, requesting aid with sickly personnel. After the transfer request was accepted and the infected personnel were transported to Area-34, it was revealed that they were suffering from symptoms that were similar to those in SCP-6821 instances infected with SCP-6821-V. Among these infected personnel was Hugo Berganza, a long-time representative to the Foundation. A DNA test was conducted on Berganza and several other of the INCA personnel, revealing their shared ancestry with SCP-6821.\n\nUnfortunately, as no cure or treatment had been developed at the time, all of the INCA personnel succumbed to SCP-6821-V. An analysis of DNA collected from Central America revealed more individuals with ancestry linking them to SCP-6821. Approximately 10-15% of all individuals with mestizo heritage within the areas previously inhabited by SCP-6821 contain some genetic data from SCP-6821, with 5% of these having a genome made up of 20% or more of SCP-6821.\n\nResearch for a cure to SCP-6821-V is currently being conducted, although very little progress has been made since 2020. An antidote based on the ferritin present in an infectee's blood has been suggested, but clinical trials have yet to yield any results.\n\n**Addendum 6821.10:** GOC-MCF-INCA Involvement\n\nIn October of 2021, the following message was received by Area-34 from the Global Occult Coalition:\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/graves2/gock.png) top right no-repeat #fcfcfc; float: center; border: solid 3px #275495; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n###6EA0E8|@@beabugh@command.goc.int@@##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n###6EA0E8|@@ezeverest@area34.scp.int@@##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRelief to Anomalous Entities in Central America\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n15/10/21\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:solid 2px #275495; background:#275495; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nDear Ezra Everest,\n\nIt has come to the attention of the Global Occult Coalition that, as a direct result of Foundation activities, a group of anomalous entities and humans are at risk of contracting a highly lethal disease. This information was given to the Coalition by an informant from INCA who would otherwise like to stay anonymous.\n\nAfter a review of the nature of the virus you aided in creating, its effects on those it infects, and the large number of people at risk of contracting this disease, the Council of 108 has decided to offer to step in and provide aid to affected communities. The Manna Charitable Foundation as well has offered to provide aid alongside the Coalition.\n\nHowever, the Council of 108 has also decided to include some conditions to their aid, which are:\n\n# All research conducted into a potential cure or other treatments for the virus made by the Foundation are to be handed over to Coalition officials.\n# The Foundation is to cease all aid being given to those affected by the virus and turn over all relief efforts to the Coalition and Charitable Foundation.\n# An internal disciplinary investigation is to be conducted on those responsible for the creation of this virus at the Foundation.\n\nWe look forward to a timely response.\n \n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:solid 2px #275495; background:#275495; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px\"]]\n[[/div]]\nWith regards,\nOfficer Beatrice Bugh, GOC External Operations Chief\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\nUpon the above email being forwarded to the Ethics Committee, a disciplinary hearing was organized for the Department of Anomalous Weapons Development.\n\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* 2020 AWD Discplinary Hearing\n\n**Parties Present:**\n* **Dr. Meredith Rivers** - Ethics Committee Representative\n* **Dr. Patrick Trevors** - Ethics Committee Representative\n* **Dr. Ezra Everest** - Director of AWD, Area-34\n* **Dr. Christiane Hedegaard** - AWD Virologist\n* **Dr. Andreas Moser** - AWD Virologist\n----\n**Dr. Patrick Trevors:** We are here today for the disciplinary hearing of AWD for the creation of SCP-6821-V and the mass death of SCP-6821 and SCP-6821-H instances. They are represented by Doctors Everest, Hedegaard, and Moser.\n\n**Dr. Meredith Rivers:** To begin, I would like to review the Design Dossier AWD released for SCP-6821-V, or Weapon-6821-2, as it was referred to in the document. Before I continue, who wrote this dossier?\n\n**Dr. Ezra Everest:** I wrote it with information from Hedegaard and Moser.\n\n**Dr. Trevors:** Can the two of you confirm that?\n\n**Dr. Christiane Hedegaard:** Yes.\n\n**Dr. Andreas Moser:** Yep.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** Understood. Within this document, you mention that the virus, SCP-6821-V, was created with \"high transmission rate\", a long incubation period, and a highly lethal effect. What was your reasoning for creating a virus that could quickly and stealthily spread through a population like this?\n\n**Dr. Everest:** AWD deemed them a threat to Area-34 and the Foundation's operations in Central America at large. They needed to be exterminated as soon as possible.\n\n**Dr. Trevors:** Were there other ways to deal with this \"threat\" that weren't so... painful.\n\n**Dr. Everest:** Maybe. We didn't bother looking into other potential neutralization methods when we landed on that idea.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** Were you aware that SCP-6821 are sapient entities, and that you were purposefully inflicting mass pain and death on a group of sapient beings?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Dr. Everest:** Yes.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** So you acknowledge that you were partaking in the genocide of a whole race of people, found only here in Central America?\n\n**Dr. Everest:** It was in the best interests of the Foundation.\n\n**Dr. Trevors:** And what was your justification for this belief?\n\n**Dr. Everest:** SCP-6821 instances, since our first encounter with them, have continued to attack and steal away our security staff here at Area-34 and at other Foundation facilities throughout Central America.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** ... Dr. Everest, tell me. In the 15 years we have known of SCP-6821, how many encounters have we had with them.\n\n**Dr. Moser:** 474 encounters.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** And how many of these have resulted in the loss of personnel?\n\n**Dr. Hedegaard:** About 14 of those.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** And that's... about 5% of all recorded encounters. If an encounter has less than 5% of a chance to result in a casualty, do you think it warrants a response of this scale?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Dr. Everest:** No. It doesn't.\n\n**Dr. Trevors:** //[Sigh]// How does AWD plead?\n\n**Dr. Everest:** Guilty.\n\n**Dr. Hedegaard:** Guilty.\n\n**Dr. Moser:** Guilty.\n\n**Dr. Rivers:** Thank you. The Ethics Committee will deliberate on this matter, then you will be notified of our decision. Until then, to placate requests from the Coalition, the three of you - and any other AWD personnel involved in the creation of SCP-6821-V, will be held at Area-06-3. Is this understood?\n\n**Dr. Everest:** Yes.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this hearing, it was decided that AWD was indeed guilty of violating several Foundation guidelines involving the treatment of sapient entities. The virologists and bioengineers involved in the manufacture of SCP-6821-V were permanently suspended from their positions and, in some cases, transferred to Area-06-3. Dr. Ezra Everest was temporially suspended from his role as Director for 1 year, during which he was also held at Area-06-3. He returned to his role as Director in 2021, albeit under strict supervision from the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe GOC and MCF fully agreed to aid SCP-6821 and SCP-6821-H in treating SCP-6821-V following this hearing. It is unknown how much progress has been made by the GOC in making a cure for SCP-6821-V, although it has been noted that SCP-6821-H instances previously marked as infected by the Foundation have since shown signs of recovery.",
