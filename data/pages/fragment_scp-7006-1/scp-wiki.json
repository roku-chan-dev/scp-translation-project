It is presumed that the bond's presence is responsible for propelling the Foundation to the grandiose logistical successes it knows today.\n\nIf Ritual-7006 is not performed during a given year, or fails, SCP-7006's positive effects will begin to diminish; this progresses on an annual basis for an unknown duration, presumably ending with the bond's total severance.

This is accomplished through a series of rites which involve several 'lucky' or 'unlucky' items, events, sigils, signifiers, and superstitions. Among these are as follows:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block \n|name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/ritual.png\n|caption=Ritual-7006, as expressed via recursive iconographic notation.\n|width=200px \n|align=right\n]]\n\n* The conduction of a lottery among select Foundation staff; the winner is awarded a cash prize, and the winning ticket is torn into sevenths.\n\n\n* The burning of forty four-leafed clovers atop a ritual pyre, which uses 1/7th of the aforementioned lottery ticket as fuel.\n\n\n* Flipping a gold coin until it comes up heads ten times in a row, and then biting down on the coin so that it bends in half.\n\n\n* The temporary retirement of a member of the O5 Council, so that the Council numbers twelve instead of thirteen.\n\n\n* Conducting no work on Friday the 13th.\n\n\n* Rolling dice fashioned from magical materials such as human bone and meteorites, and the destruction of such dice that roll below their median more than 50% of the allotted time.\n\n* Performance of Ritual-7006-Warden.\n\n------\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]WARDEN:[[/span]] Ritual-7006-Warden is a unique rite in which the conditions of each //Absolute// are allegorically appeased inside of a constructed fictional environment. The performance of Ritual-7006-Warden is by far the most difficult and variable part of Ritual-7006, as for it to be effective there must be a non-negligible possibility of failure.\n\nRitual-7006-Warden makes use of a role-playing framework recovered by the Foundation from an anomalous \"wargames\" society operating in England during the late 19th century. Lightly changed by Foundation thaumatologists to suit the needs of Ritual-7006, this framework has proven immensely effective at fulfilling the symbological and ritualistic needs of the //Triad// in an environment with an efficiently low level of immediate physical consequences.\n\nThrough 7006-Warden, ritualists play the roles of Avatars, together forming a fantastical \"party\" collectively representing the Foundation, embarking on three missions representing the qualities of each //Absolute//. Succeeding in these missions (henceforth called \"modules\") contributes to Ritual-7006's efficiency; if one or more are failed, this likely causes Ritual-7006 as a whole to fail, or to be massively weakened.\n\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/sigil.jpg|\n    caption=Performances of Ritual-7006-Warden take place atop a Foundation sigil.|\n    width=100%|\n    align=center|\n]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"fancyhr\"]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/green-texture.png); margin: auto; border: groove 6px var(--accentColor); border-radius: 20px;\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]RULESET:[[/span]] A condensed form of Ritual-7006-Warden's rules have been provided below; for a full version, personnel may consult [[[https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/ |this document]]].\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"font-size: 150%;\"]]7006-Warden[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"font-size: 125%; display: inline-block; margin-top: -22px; z-index: 10000;\"]]OFFICIAL HANDBOOK[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"font-size: 112.5%;\"]]ABILITIES:[[/span]]\n**STR:** Physicality, brawn & toughness.\n**DEX:** Speed, sneaking & precision.\n**CTRL:**  Willpower, charm & the weird.\n\n------\n\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"font-size: 112.5%;\"]]SAVES:[[/span]]\nRoll d20 equal to or under target **Ability**.

Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to an Avatar's inventory. **Fatigue** takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times.\n\n------\n\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"font-size: 112.5%;\"]]INVENTORY:[[/span]]\nAvatars each have 10 inventory slots.

It is random or is a copy of one from the previous day. Spells take up one item slot. Spells cost one action to cast. One may attempt a CTRL save to retain the spell.

Attackers roll their **Stress** or **Damage** die, subtract any protections from **Armor** (Damage) or **Stability** (Stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent's HP. Excess Damage is dealt to STR and excess Stress is dealt to CTRL.\n\nIf there are **Multiple attackers**, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.\n\n**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 Damage. **Impaired** attacks (position of weakness) reduce Damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. **Enhanced** attacks (position of advantage) increase Damage die to 1d12. **Blast** affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.\n\n------\n\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"font-size: 112.5%;\"]]DAMAGE:[[/span]]\nDamage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR.

His father was a museum curator, and he was always told to follow in his footsteps and keep the family tradition alive. However, in the process of growing his collection, he ran afoul of a certain organization.\n\nAn artifact brought to him from the far east was found to be trafficked by an insurgent organization working against the Foundation. The artifact, a small piece of jade shaped like a pill, let off an aura that beckoned whoever was near it to consume it. Orville kept it locked under glass, which seemed to abate the effect. However, the artifact’s properties were known to the Foundation, who soon came knocking.\n\nOrville was reluctant to part with it, but part with it he did — or he attempted to, at any rate. Instead, he found himself absently stuffing the pill down his throat while explaining its anomalous properties. From that day, a single command overrode his psyche: Collect. He did not know what to Collect, or why. But when the Foundation saw this change, they offered him either surgery and amnesticization, or a position.\n\nHe took the position.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Study\" hide=\"Study\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\" style=\"background: var(--bgColor); margin: auto; border: solid 2px var(--fgColor);\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"color: white;\"]]Avatar[[/span]]\n++++++ [[size 270%]]Dr. Imani Monroe[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"max-width: 200px; margin: auto;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/study-portrait.png style=\"border-radius: 50px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-evenly; font-family: 'Macondo', var(--body-font); font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--accentColor); padding: 0 1rem 0 1rem; text-align: center;\"]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nHP **2**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nSTR **12**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nDEX **11**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nCTRL **16**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n= [[span class=\"bt\"]]Special Features[[/span]]\n* **Well-Studied**\n * Once in each Combat, this Avatar may roll an opposed CTRL Save.

From a young age, she was plagued with all sorts of afflictions, and no matter how much medicine her mother gave her, none of it seemed to work. This was because Imani’s affliction was spiritual — she was being haunted by a creature that none could see.\n\nThat was until a fateful day, when she was still a teenager. Imani suffered a horrible acute headache: a swelling. The best course of action the doctors could think of was to cut open her skull to relieve the pressure. When she awoke, she could see the thing haunting her in all its detail. It was not long before she set about trying to kill it.\n\nWhen she read that charms of bone can repel evil, she carved a charm using a piece of her own skull (since replaced by metal plates) and managed to destroy her tormentor. In doing so, her health vastly improved — so vastly, in fact, that the Foundation came calling soon after.\n\nToday she is known for her immense dedication to the parascientific method, a master of both normative and anormative fields.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Wonder\" hide=\"Wonder\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\" style=\"background: var(--bgColor); margin: auto; border: solid 2px var(--fgColor);\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"color: white;\"]]Avatar[[/span]]\n++++++ [[size 270%]]Bayan Novak[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"max-width: 200px; margin: auto;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/wonder-portrait.png style=\"border-radius: 50px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-evenly; font-family: 'Macondo', var(--body-font); font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--accentColor); padding: 0 1rem 0 1rem; text-align: center;\"]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nHP **3**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nSTR **11**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nDEX **10**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nCTRL **13**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n= [[span class=\"bt\"]]Special Features[[/span]]\n* **Eager**\n * This Avatar takes ½ Stress damage, rounded down.\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"font-family: 'Macondo', var(--header-font);\"]]Wonder[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-style: italic; margin: auto; width: 90%; font-size: 1rem;\"]]\n\"Despite all the evils in this world, I still find endless beauty in it.

Not necessarily a writer, but someone who catalogs stories and chronicles of all eras, and helps proliferate them back into the world. He collected first editions of novels, went on digs in ancient archaeological sites, and worked tirelessly to make sure that the best and oldest stories stayed in circulation.\n\nBayan’s story involves a book full of names, one he’s had since childhood. It was given to him by a woman with vibrant green eyes -- an old guardian -- who gave him his mission to be a storyteller. His name is inside the book, but it is transient, travelling from page to page, cover to cover. There are seven-hundred and seventy-six other names in the book, storytellers all; he often finds the names crossed out, and the storytellers dead, vanished, or somehow corrupted.\n\nHe discovered the Foundation after investigating a name linked to them, and was abruptly exposed to the wider world of the anomalous. Bayan accepted the supernatural with open arms, for he knows that the only way to unravel the secret of his book is to find the woman who gave it to him, and to do that, he must become familiar with this new world.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Defense\" hide=\"Defense\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\" style=\"background: var(--bgColor); margin: auto; border: solid 2px var(--fgColor);\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"bt\" style=\"color: white;\"]]Avatar[[/span]]\n++++++ [[size 270%]]Etzli Montenegro[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"max-width: 200px; margin: auto;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/defense-portrait.png style=\"border-radius: 50px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-evenly; font-family: 'Macondo', var(--body-font); font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem; color: var(--accentColor); padding: 0 1rem 0 1rem; text-align: center;\"]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nHP **5**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nSTR **13**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nDEX **12**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 0 15px 0 15px;\"]]\nCTRL **12**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n= [[span class=\"bt\"]]Special Features[[/span]]\n* **Til' My Last Breath**\n * If this Avatar receives Critical Damage, they may make a CTRL Save.

The second, they let die on an operating table after they heard the patient laughing, gloating about how they had the ability to make their war last for an eternity, and consume the continent. The patient demonstrated this by causing two other patients in the same tent -- who had been recovering --  to keel over in a pool of their own blood.\n\nThis thing, not a human, was being targeted by the Foundation for containment, and when they learned Etzli was responsible for its death, the Foundation delivered an ultimatum: join us, or never work as a medic again.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"fancyhr\"]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\" style=\"background: #0f5717; margin: auto; border-left-style: groove; border-right-style: groove; padding: 10px 2rem 10px 2rem; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 27px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\"]]\n\n= [[span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: var(--accentColor); user-select: none;\"]][[size 130%]]@@*@@[[/size]] [[size 200%]]@@*@@[[/size]] [[size 130%]]@@*@@[[/size]][[/span]]\n\n@@ @@ @@ @@ @@ @@ [[size 120%]]//\"We have everything to lose, but everything to gain.
