Further testing of SCP-6541 is pending Ethics Committee Review.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6541 is an antique bear trap, typical in design of devices produced in the late 19th century, that occasionally displays autonomous behavior, most commonly when in line of sight of a sentient observer. \n\nSCP-6541 will engage in violent behavior towards any female human, typically attacking and maiming the individual until the victim either flees or dies. Following this, if there are no other individuals satisfying SCP-6541's criteria for aggression, it will revert to a docile or inanimate state.\n\nThe degree of sentience possessed by SCP-6541 is unknown.\n\n\n**Notes:** \n\n> I must remind personnel that spreading rumors regarding re-assignment of staff from an anomaly warrants disciplinary measures for unprofessional conduct. It is frankly none of your business how or why someone is re-assigned. Focus on your job, and less on rumors. All of our words have impact, so be mindful of your prejudices and how they are externalized. Bigotry towards your fellow coworkers will not be tolerated. Thanks. \n> \n> -Director Oliver Barren\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+You have 8 Unread messages from <marirod1989@scipnet.fou>\"hide=\"-Close Inbox\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**To:** baronoli19@scipnet.fou\n\n**Subject:** Company Policy\n\nI know that we have a strict dress code but I was wondering if you would let me incorporate like, some kind of mini-skirt into my outfit?
