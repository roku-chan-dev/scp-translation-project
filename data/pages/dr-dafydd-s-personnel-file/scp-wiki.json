Stationed at Site-12, the good doctor is usually seen either drinking rum-spiked tea, studying the latest papers on oneiric therapy, monitoring SCPs' behaviour, or drawing crude pictures of Sidhe in painful positions. **###304529|Addressing the Sidhe or related topics around Dr. Dafydd is not recommended.##**\n\nA number of rumours surround Dr. Dafydd. These include his past with the Serpent's Hand, his ability to speak ###6A5EFF|**Indigo**##[[footnote]] A psionic implantation technique, applied using auditory command.

[[/footnote]], his affair with the Mayor of Three Portland and his grand collection of stuffed toys, his favourite being a rabbit called Blackberry. The one rumour that is circulated the most, however, is the origin of his theriomorphism. Many a time has Dr. Dafydd been asked the reason for his rabbit form and many a time has he provided a possible answer. The most popular answer being, \"I really like carrots\", followed by a twitch of the nose.\n\n@@ @@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6879 SCP-6879]: **Mr. Kaboom**\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-6879\"]]\n[%%created_at%%] [###304529|+%%rating%%##] (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\n> Whilst at Site-██, SCP-6879 continued to behave erratically.

One of the most important stories of Welsh heritage, and a favourite of mine, are the tales of the Mabinogi, a four-part story that involves magical afterlives, proud kings and monsters like giants, fairies and dragons. Some scholars believe that prior to Britain's Christianisation, the characters in the stories were considered gods.\n\nMixed with a sense of pride and admiration, I decided to try and write something both close to my heritage and something that could provide influential material to the wiki.
