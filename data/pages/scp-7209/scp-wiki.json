Originally constructed for usage in [REDACTED], Site-Gamma become the containment location of SCP-7209 after the anomaly was discovered nearby.\n\nSCP-7209-1 is built in 3 distinct wings; RESIDENCE, RESEARCH, and CONTAINMENT. The RESIDENCE wing is non-anomalous and encompasses the perimeter of the facility.\n\nThe CONTAINMENT wing, composed of the central storage room for SCP-7209 and the surrounding observation booths, is located at the center of Site-Gamma. All structures in CONTAINMENT are made from an alloy of beryllium bronze and SCP-148, with the intent of counteracting any physical, mental, or thaumaturgical harm posed by the anomaly. 6 restabilized SRA Devices[[footnote]]Reality Anchors which have been deactivated, reactivated, and overclocked to form an ontokinetic bond with the surrounding localized reality.[[/footnote]] are located in the perimeter of CONTAINMENT, and have been restabilized into conjoining objectively with the surrounding materials.\n\nMore information regarding SCP-7209 will be available upon your transfer to Site-Gamma.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n------\n**Present Staff:**\n\n* Ethel Kursh, HR Liaison.\n* Dr. Anton Radu, Archaeology.\n* Agent John Gardner, Level 4 MTF Captain.\n* Dr. Murph Teckler, General Research.\n* Site-18 Director Iovianus Neer.\n* Dr. Ryoto Hishikaku, Analogue Intelligence.\n* Agent B. ██████, Espionage.\n* Petra Baldwin, RAISA.\n\n**FORWARD:** Meeting held within the front lobby of Site-Gamma 15 minutes after the arrival of all summoned Level 4 Personnel.\n\n------\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**E.

NEER (22 Years)\n**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 Site Director\n**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-18\n\nIf you asked for a definition of eloquence and leadership, most of the Foundation who knows him would probably point toward Iovanius Neer. He's not a Foundation baby by birth -- Parents were eventual defectors from the Serpent's Hand. Iovanius, or Ivy as his coworkers have taken to calling him (as will this report, for the sake of being succinct), didn't get the thaumaturgy though. Nor did he get the wonders of the library. He got dirt and rations, but that makes it more impressive to watch him rise like he did.\n\nSite-18 has always been a tricky Site to manage. Shoved number-wise between the Foundation's greatest accomplishment and the ongoing biggest mistake, people often forget about 18, despite the facility being one of our largest. Directors in the past have done their best to try and fight the under-budgeting and take the reins of such a disorganized place. But Ivy was the first to do it right. He single-handedly took 18 from a cluttered mess to a place of utmost efficiency -- and unlike some other facilities, the efficiency didn't come at the cost of humanity.\n\nA strong leader, an intelligent mind, a caring coworker, and someone loyal to the Foundation for the reciprocal benefits given between him and us. Iovanius Neer is probably the most qualified for PROJECT ROYALE -- although the sort of archetype given by him is filled, and he's perceived as a valuable asset in his position. So we'll see.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG** (CENTREMOST RESEARCH LAB)\n\n------\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n//The north door to the lab slowly opens.

It's a strange and distinct difference between his old job as co-Director of the Artificial Intelligence Department, a job he lost due to quite several ethics violations against him. There's the issue with people like Hishikaku; he's incredibly qualified at his job. He's responsible for the current understanding we have of digital (or analog, whatever that entails) intelligence, and he'd be an insanely respected figure in the Foundation if he just wasn't so cruel to his coworkers. Days off are lacking, and emotions rarely show beyond the negatives.\n\nWhen we write about ethics issues, we're talking about really big ethics issues. Hishikaku's been suspected of betraying the Foundation for our less-moral enemies in at least 2 different instances. He's been cleared each time, but there's still the lingering wonder if he's still loyal to what's better: The Foundation.\n\nPROJECT ROYALE will be an excellent test of this character.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n\n------\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n//The west rooms of the RESIDENTIAL wing are seen.

All we know about \"Barry\" (as he calls himself) is that he was part of an old Foundation espionage initiative to reduce the risk when it came to our spies getting captured. Everything about ██████ was erased from his mind, and likely anyone that knew him before that. He agreed to it -- allegedly -- but it still does place him at odds with the more modern \"just be better at getting out of it\" mentality. More humane. Kind of.\n\nHe's certainly an interesting character. The lack of identity led to him forming his own, and the result is very... pataphysics calls him \"narratively convenient\". A faux-charmer with a loud mouth that can slither out of situations like the sleaze-ball they are. That kind of spy. At the very least, ██████ is great at his job. Supposedly. It's always difficult to document these constant moving forces within the Foundation -- how do you \"Human Resources\" someone who lost most of what made them human?\n\nHe's a very unique case for PROJECT ROYALE.

Baldwin:** My kids, man... god, I hope they're alright.\n\n**J. Gardner:** Foundation puts families of the endangered under special protection, in circumstances like this. You'll see 'em soon.\n\n**P. Baldwin:** If anything happened to them, I don't know what I'd do.\n\n**A. Radu (yelling):** Guys!\n\n**P. Baldwin:** Oh, sorry, yeah Anton?\n\n**J. Gardner:** You see what our ticket out of here is?\n\n**A. Radu:** Look.\n\n//The dust from the chamber settles. There is a metal podium in the center of the chamber, with a fluorescent ring light in the ceiling. Atop the podium is a 20 x 20 x 20 cm crystal, bearing resemblance to quartz. The personnel are silent.//\n\n**M. Teckler:** Well. Interesting. A rock.\n\n**P. Baldwin:** A... rock.\n\n**J. Gardner:** You're fucking kidding.\n\n//Baldwin walks over to the supposed SCP-7209. Her hands are shaking and she has a look of desperation on her face.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** Well, I'm sure this is- This is fine, it was important enough to be kept here. They built a whole facility just for one anomaly.\n\n//Baldwin starts frantically examining the object, careful to not make contact. Gardner places his head in his hands and sighs. Teckler sits on the ground and leans against the steel walls of the antechamber.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** It has to do something. Anton, Anton, you read the file, what's the deal with this thing?\n\n//Radu is silent. He looks down at the floor.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** Anton, I- we need this thing to get out of here. What the hell does the rock do?\n\n//Radu sighs. Tears are welling in Baldwin's eyes.//\n\n**A. Radu:** It... it doesn't do anything.\n\n//Gardner and Teckler wince. Baldwin begins to slowly step towards Radu. There are more tears in her eyes.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** The fuck are you talking about? It's- It's SCP-7209, that rock is the whole reason we're here! What does it //do//?\n\n//Baldwin keeps stepping forward. Gardner takes a step back while Teckler shuffles closer to the antechamber doorway.//\n\n**A. Radu:** I told you, it doesn't do anything. The document- it was just a placeholder or something. I think SCP-7209 was too? The document wasn't even finished when I got to it, there's no proper description at all beyond-\n\n//Radu points at the supposed SCP-7209.//\n\n**A. Radu:** Beyond that. It doesn't even have anomalous properties, I don't think. Keter class but... it said something about \"the show\"? We're in a game, right? Did the Insurgency plant this?\n\n//Baldwin takes another step. She is no longer standing in the antechamber, and she slowly starts reaching toward her pocket. Gardner increases the grip on the firearm he's holding.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** I don't care about whatever your theory is, Anton, I just- I just need this to do anything. You're a goddamn archaeologist, can't you- I don't know, do something?\n\n**A. Radu:** That's not what archaeology is, I don't deal with just crystals or whatever. It's just a rock, Petra, I'm sorry.\n\n//The room goes silent. Baldwin starts to hyperventilate and reaches deeper into her pocket. Gardner takes another step back. Teckler is now seated in the doorway to the antechamber. Radu places his hand in his lab coat pocket. Baldwin begins to sob.//\n\n**P. Baldwin:** God fucking damn it, man.\n\n**A. Radu:** I'm sorry Petra, but there's another way out of-\n\n**P. Baldwin:** Another way out? What, is Big and Buff going to run into the walls until they fall over? Teckler slithering out like the worm he is? This was our last fucking shot, Anton, and it's- it's over.\n\n**J. Gardner:** Soldier, it ain't over 'till it's over. Now, I suggest you don't do what I think you're about to, because-\n\n**P. Baldwin:** My kids, Anton. I'll never get to see them again. My wife, my coworkers, my friends, everyone I've ever loved. Gone.\n\n**A. Radu:** Don't think like that, Petra, it's not-\n\n**P. Baldwin:** You have family, archaeologist?\n\n//Radu steps back. His hand grasps something inside his lab coat pocket.//\n\n**A. Radu:** No.\n\n**P. Baldwin:** Then you don't understand what it's like. None of you do.\n\n**J. Gardner:** What?\n\n//Suddenly, Baldwin screams and pulls the revolver out of her pocket, running towards Radu and pointing at his head. Gardner attempts to shoot at her, but his firearm jams. As Baldwin runs forward, Radu pulls out his revolver. His hands are shaking. He looks at Baldwin and Gardner. Gardner is trying to unjam the firearm, and Teckler has already run away from the antechamber. With a tear welling in his eye, Radu pulls out the revolver Baldwin gave him initially and fires two shots. One makes contact with Baldwin's chest, terminating her instantly. The other makes contact with the supposed SCP-7209. The crystal shatters. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, only half the crystal shards are remaining on the ground. Baldwin's body is gone. Gardener and Radu breathe heavily from exhaustion, before sitting on the ground and dropping their weapons. They look at each other. Tears begin to well in Radu's eyes. Teckler walks back into the room slowly and sits next to Radu. He winces upon noticing the gun next to Radu. Radu leans his head back and begins to cry.//\n\n[END]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"petra.hr.file\" hide=\"CLOSE\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT\n[[/=]]\n------\n**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** PETRA M.

Kind of similar to us in Human Resources, you're not dealing with active anomalies or research -- unless it's an infoallergenic anomaly, in which case, that's a full day of chaos. RAISA is about composure, about writing and containing your thoughts as you go to archive hundreds of years of paperwork. It's also an old department. Rumors say they were the third to come, after the Overseers and Ethics Committee. Of course, that's just speculation from the mythologists among us. The point is, the people are old. So a Level 4 Deputy Chief is unexpected.\n\nPetra is a go-getter. She's responsible. She cares about her coworkers, and even more about the people she handles the archival of. She cares a lot about her family -- 2 children -- and hates spending time away from them. But she has a dedication to the Foundation, just like her mother beforehand. 33 years old, and 11 years as one of RAISA's best, has made her the leader of the modern department. Second only to Maria Jones, of course.\n\nNobody likes moving her so far away from her family so an extended period, but we know she'll do it. The stress of the distance might even help. She's the RAISA candidate for PROJECT ROYALE.

O. GARDNER (41 YEARS)\n**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 MTF Captain, MTF Charlie-99 (\"Ballistic Boomers\")\n**CURRENT LOCATION:** Varies.\n\nJohn Gardner is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Gardners are Foundation legacy. His family, 6 generations back, have worked here, almost all as MTF Agents. There’s good reason for it too — natural talent is what some people call it. Strong, quick thinkers who can tactically deal with almost any situation thrown at them. John is the most recent and debatably best example of this. Been leading Charlie-99 since his father died, and the “Ballistic Boomers” are no joke. A powerhouse strike team called in for heavy-duty, sometimes military, anomalous combat requires a leader fit high-stress scenarios. John Gardner fits like a leather-back glove.\n\nOn the other hand, the stress of being this kind of necessary leader can get to him. He’s become more gruff, more aggressive over the past couple of years. It’s a pattern of behavior that’s unsurprising after the ways his father acted, but it’s led to 3 HR Reports against him for aggravated behavior. His team respects him — he’s a 6’4 powerhouse of a man — but can he call them friends? His closest companion is his second-in-command Chase McDougall. They’ve been best friends since childhood. At least, that’s what we’ve been told.\n\nAll and all, John Gardner is the best choice for an agent in PROJECT ROYALE. His skills supersede the emotions — at least, theoretically.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG** (SOUTH CONTAINMENT WING HALLWAY)\n\n------\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n//Anton Radu and Murph Teckler sit next to each other, leaning against the wall.

Please. So stop talking.\n\n###5384D5|**O5-4:**## Sorry, boss.\n\n**O5-1:** Right. Anyway. Dr. Anton Radu, do you, with all the power of the Foundation, and swearing the oath of Security, Containment, and Protection, accept this promotion?\n\n###FF00D9|**O5-5:**## Why do you even ask 'em that, he's obviously going to say-\n\n**A. Radu:** Uh. No?\n\n###FF00D9|**O5-5:**## -yes. Sorry, what?\n\n###FF7400|**O5-7:**## Kid, that's.... No isn't an option.\n\n###AA00FF|**O5-8:**## First time for everything.\n\n**O5-1:** Dr. Radu, you mean to tell me you decline the promotion to a member of the O5 Council?\n\n**A. Radu:** Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry, I know this is a big deal and everything, but I don't see myself as that kind of... I don't know. I'm not suited towards this? I'm an Archaeologist, I'm not a bureaucrat. Or anomalous, which seems to be... a common theme.\n\n###FF00D9|**O5-5:**## 6 isn't anomalous. He's just stupid.\n\n##yellow|**O5-6:**## Stupidly PATRIOTIC.\n\n**A. Radu:** But yeah.

Regular mechanical maintenance is required by a rotating schedule of amnectisized level 1 mechanics and janitorial staff, who will be terminated and replaced in 1-month cycles. All individuals responsible for the construction of SCP-7209 will remain under close watch of the O5 Council if critical changes must be made.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg |\n    caption=SG-SE, Wing Alpha. |\n    align=center |\n    width=100%\n]]\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7209 is the SWEENEY-GREENE SIMULACRUM ENGINE, a Class-4 Simulation Development, and Procedural Generation Mechanism, produced for the express purpose of PROJECT ROYALE.\n\nSCP-7209 differs from most anomalous simulation mechanisms in that it receives inputs both from standard input code, as well as information stored in the simulation user's conscious and subconscious memory. This specific ability allows for the creation of 82.6% more believable simulations and is used proactively within PROJECT ROYALE to create a realistic environment in which O5 Candidates are unaware of their status inside the simulation.\n\nSCP-7209 also contains a highly adaptive AIC complex (designed SCP-7209-Γ), which has been connected to all 13 members of the O5 Council. Activatable through remote passphrase entry, the AIC complex can receive mental inputs from the O5 Council to influence behavior within the simulation; the AIC is also programmed to act out the necessary steps of PROJECT ROYALE in conjunction with the environment generated by SCP-7209. This has been used to create \"antagonists\" to O5 Candidates during the thus far 7 iterations of PROJECT ROYALE, which have included: High Priest Robert Bumaro (Iteration 2, \"AMONI-RAM\"), P. Hudson Gock (Iteration 4, \"GAME OVER\") and The Engineer (Iteration 7, \"CHAOS TAKEOVER\").\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nBy executive order of O5-12, with approval from a simple majority of the O5 Council, SCP-7209 has been decommissioned. Mechanical elements and materials are to be salvaged for future SIMULACRUM projects.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]] {{« [[[/ever-turning|LIFE IS EVER TURNING]]] »}} [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7208]]] | SCP-7209 | [[[SCP-7210]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Tryton supercomputer Gdansk University of Technology 2015.jpg\n> **Author:** Tomasz Ziółkowski\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
