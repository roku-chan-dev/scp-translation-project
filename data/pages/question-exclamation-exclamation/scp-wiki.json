No identification was available except for a name tag hanging on the bed. The subject actively attempted to communicate, but nobody in the Foundation was able to understand him. Written conversation was impossible, as both of his arms were cut off by SCP-████-KO long time ago.\n> \n> @@@@\n> @@@@\n> ----\n> [[=]]\n> **<Start of log>**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> **Researcher Hariuchi:**\n> -- Nice to meet you.

His tongue seemed fine but was actually fixed to his jaw, rendering him incapable of normal speech.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=thd-glasses, translated by fluxman]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
