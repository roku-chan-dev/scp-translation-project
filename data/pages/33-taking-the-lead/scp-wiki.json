STF Alpha-43 is now MTF Alpha-1. I have been named sole authority over this organization.\"\n\nFalkirk turned to face Ibanez. He pointed at McInnis. \"Shoot him.\"\n\n\"Would you like me to speak the words to disable your pacemaker, Edwin?\" McInnis asked softly.\n\nThe old man turned, one hand clenched into a fist, the other pointing in accusation, shaking, jaw wagging soundlessly. They stared each other down. Between Falkirk's hunch and McInnis' diminutive stature, they were standing about even.\n\n\"It will be a simple matter to confirm my credentials,\" the putative Administrator offered. \"If a demonstration is desired, Chief Ibanez is equipped to instigate it. Chief?\"\n\nIbanez swallowed hard. \"Are you sure?\"\n\nFalkirk spun again to wag his pointing finger at her. \"Don't do it.\"\n\n\"Quite certain,\" McInnis nodded.\n\nShe nodded back, and said in a voice so serious McInnis was sure he'd never heard her use it before: \"Does the black moon howl?\"\n\n\"In subjective disagreement,\" he responded.\n\nThey fell to their knees.\n\nAll of them. Nascimbeni shouted in pain. Falkirk screeched in agony. Most of them exclaimed in shock.\n\nOnly McInnis remained standing. \"I apologize, but that was necessary. It's very important that you understand the gravity of this moment.\"\n\n\"Fucking gravity,\" Harry grunted.\n\n\"You're just a man,\" Falkirk gasped. \"Just a man with a code book. We don't need more men, especially not ones like //you.//\"\n\n\"How would you know what we need?\" McInnis towered over the Director. \"You've made no effort whatsoever to address the situation. You've allowed humanity's brightest hope to dwindle away in the dark.\"\n\n\"I will //not// be lectured.\" Falkirk's voice was nothing but a guttural growl now, animalistic and raw. \"What wonderful things have you been up to all these months, //Administrator?//\"\n\nThey slowly rose to their feet, one by one, as it occurred to them that they could. Falkirk remained on the floor. McInnis wondered if he was even capable of rising, or if his thin knees had been shattered.\n\n\"I have been monitoring the collapse of our organization, and in rapid succession, the civilizations of the Earth.\" There could be no doubting the sincerity of his devastating calm. \"I believe I possess a clear picture of what has occurred, and what is to be done about it. My predecessors lacked both the resources and the opportunity to effectuate a solution. I am uniquely equipped with both, in the persons of my staff at Site-43.\"\n\n\"//My// staff.\" Falkirk was shaking all over, his white hands turning red as he clenched them into fists. \"I'm the Director.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"So long as you fulfill my directives, I have no interest in usurping your position.\"\n\nThe old man was suddenly still. \"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, what?\" Ibanez stepped forward. \"You know this sack of shit. He isn't fit to manage a gas station.\"\n\n\"You have been a profound disappointment, woman,\" Falkirk spat over his shoulder. \"I thought you understood what had to be done. I valued your understanding.\"\n\nShe presented him with her middle finger. \"I never met the woman who understood you, and if she exists, I have nothing in common with her.\"\n\n\"Director Falkirk remains qualified to perform his administrative duties, in the absence of a sufficiently experienced substitute.\" McInnis looked down his nose at the miserable specimen of a man. \"He has, despite his considerable shortcomings and moral failings, succeeded in preserving the majority of our staff for this moment.\"\n\n\"I don't think he knew that was what he was doing, Allan,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer agreed. \"Sorry to burst your bubble, Al--\"\n\n\"Did you just call the Administrator 'Al'?\" Okorie boggled.\n\n\"It //is// my name, in part,\" he murmured.\n\n\"--but I don't think you're going to want to keep this snake around once you've heard what he's guilty of. You might have the big picture topside, but there's things gone on below you didn't see.\"\n\nMcInnis inclined his head. \"Do tell.\"\n\nLillihammer looked behind her as Karen Elstrom approached from the barricades. \"Who wants the pleasure?\"\n\n\"We can tag-team,\" the secretary smiled grimly.\n\n\"Group effort,\" Okorie agreed.\n\n\"I was in the control room when Falkirk sent the civilians down the tunnel to AAF-A.\" Lillihammer walked down the hall to stand between the Director and Administrator. \"I saw him in contact with the boots on the ground, on his private terminal.

The climate control was all fucked up; someone was repeatedly hacking the systems remotely, and they'd turned the air conditioners up to max. Eileen was working on it, but for now everyone was wearing sweaters — just like the personnel making homes in the I&T server hall, for safety's sake. The alternative, Eileen had said, was turning off the systems entirely and suffocating to death.\n\nAfter a week of Falkirk's Directorship, this kind of gallows humour was beginning to feel like a legitimately acceptable alternative to Lillian.\n\n\"The peasants are revolting.\" Falkirk was leaning over the main console, Eileen at a station beside him. \"Are the sprinklers working in that sector?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the I&T Chief nodded.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking, and it's no good.\" Ibanez was standing on the far aisle, boot up against the wall, arms crossed. \"There's not enough oxygen in there right now with everyone screaming and yelling and packing in tight. We gas these folks, they die.\"\n\n\"That would certainly solve our civilian problem,\" the Director mused.\n\nLillian made a low noise in the back of her throat. \"You're not serious.\"\n\nFalkirk glanced over the shoulder of his sweatervest at her. \"No, Lyle, of course I'm not serious. I took the same vows you did, to protect these people. But they're certainly making apostasy look tempting.\"\n\nFalkirk had inherited a subway full of angry civilians, and he wasn't dealing with the responsibility well. There were MTF agents managing the refugee camp where the trains had stopped at H&P, but it wasn't a situation that was manageable indefinitely. The Director had refused to rehouse the refugees in H&S, and so they'd been stuck in cramped and close quarters for eight days. Something was going to give.\n\n\"Chief, we're losing crowd control here. \" It was Ibrahim Msuya, Deputy Chief of the Emergency Psychiatric and Amnestics Unit. He'd been charged with controlling the chaos. \"I've already lost sight of a few targets.\"\n\nLillian looked at the big screen on the farthest wall. It showed a subway station jam-packed with tents, bedrolls, and angry people with their arms in the air. The number of uniforms, S&C, MTF and EPAU, wasn't nearly enough to make a difference.\n\nEileen glanced at Ibanez, who nodded. \"Reinforcements are on the way,\" she said into the mic.\n\n\"Reinforcements won't help.\" Msuya's voice was strained, and the electronic noise filter was having a very hard time cutting out all the shouting around him. \"It's standing room only here. We need to calm these people down.\"\n\n\"We're human beings!\" someone successfully hollered through the filter.\n\nFalkirk mashed another button, and leaned toward a free mic. \"Then behave like it!\"\n\n\"We're human beings!\" the same voice shouted back, and in seconds it had become a group chant. \"We're human beings! We're human beings!\"\n\n\"What sparked this?\" Lillian asked.\n\n\"Rationing.\" Ibanez sounded nonspecifically disgusted. \"They've been getting pissy about accommodations, but the rationing set them off.\"\n\n\"They're being fed,\" Falkirk sighed. \"They're being watered. We're even disposing of their //filth// for them. You'd think a little gratitude would be in order.\"\n\nLillian gestured at the monitor. \"Are you going to send someone to talk to them?\"\n\n\"Of course not. We're not the government, we're the Foundation. We don't owe them explanations. We certainly don't //negotiate.// They're living under my roof, they follow my rules. If they don't like it, they can leave.\"\n\n\"Maybe we could take a few of them topside,\" Ibanez suggested. \"Show them what they're missing.\"\n\n\"Maybe we could send the lot of them topside,\" he retorted.\n\n\"We're human beings!\"\n\nThe old man shoved his mic away. \"Someone shoot that b--\"\n\nThe air filled with shrieking static, and the camera view cut out.\n\n\"REPORT!\" Falkirk shouted.\n\nIbanez had darted forward in the time it took Lillian to realize anything had happened. She was tapping on a console. \"Something's wrong in H&P. Feeds aren't responding. Ibrahim?\"\n\n\"Oh god,\" said Msuya over the radio.\n\n\"Ibrahim? What's going on down there? I've lost H&P.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" A trained physician, Msuya would have diagnosed shock from his own tone. \"Yeah, you have.\"\n\n\"Chief!\" Ibanez barked at him. \"Report!\"\n\n\"It's gone. H&P is gone. Something blew. They're panicking now. He's here.\"\n\nFalkirk's legs were shaking. \"Meaning what?\"\n\n\"We've lost--\"\n\nIt happened again. The audio compensators handled it better this time, but there was no mistaking the flash on the screen or the random hiss on the line.\n\n\"It's all going up!\" Msuya was screaming. \"We've got to get these people out of here!\"\n\n\"Are we being attacked?\" Falkirk's hands were balled into deformed fists. \"Are they //terrorists// now?\"\n\n\"It's Ambrogi! He's in H&P, oh god—\"\n\n\"Every camera in H&P is non-functional,\" Ibanez interrupted. \"I can't raise anyone. I think… I think he hit the shaped charges.\"\n\nLillian put a hand on her shoulder. \"The what?\"\n\nIbanez looked back, and up. \"You shouldn't be here.\"\n\nFalkirk shoved them both out of the way. Lillian was surprised he had the strength. He grabbed at Ibanez's mic. \"Chief, are you still there? Can you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I think I'm wounded. My armour—\"\n\n\"I am issuing orders,\" said Falkirk. His voice was steady. \"Listen closely. Get the civilians back on the trains.\"\n\n\"That's not going to be--\"\n\n\"GET THEM BACK ON THE TRAINS. Shoot a few if you have to.\"\n\nAs one, they all turned to stare at him.\n\n\"Sir?\" Msuya sounded dazed, and Lillian thought it wasn't all from his injuries.\n\nThe Director crossed his arms. \"They're leaving.\"\n\nLillian's body tensed up, and she shouted at the back of his sweater vest: \"What do you mean, they're leaving?\"\n\n\"They've shown their true colours. I won't have them near our operational zone again.\"\n\nOn the one hand, he was moving them out of Ambrogi's warpath. On the other hand, he'd somehow done the mental arithmetic allowing him to blame them for their own predicament. She found herself making an obscene gesture behind his back. \"So you're just going to, what? Put them on a slow train to Auschwitz?\"\n\nHe actually had the gall to chuckle. \"It would serve them right. But no. Chief Veiksaar, are the trains still operational?\"\n\nEileen had been waiting to respond to his query. \"They're ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Once they're fully loaded, or near enough,\" he continued, \"I want you to send them on an automated run to AAF-A.\"\n\nEileen nodded slowly. \"Should I notify Chief Van Rompay to expect arrivals?\"\n\n\"No. They won't be arriving. Lock the train up tight, then stop it at the third bulkhead door. Is the response team still on standby?\"\n\n\"I thought you weren't going to respond,\" said Lillian.\n\nHe waved her off. \"Leadership is being prepared to do things you don't intend to do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Eileen. She was still nodding, still slowly. \"They're ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Then send them along. Have their train stop before the second door.\"\n\nA new sound came over Msuya's open line, and for a moment Lillian thought another of the explosions had occurred, or else Ambrogi had been attracted by the sounds of screaming meat. But this kept going, over and over, and she suddenly recognized it as automatic rifle fire.\n\n\"Oh, god,\" she whispered.\n\nThis time Ibanez shoved Falkirk aside. The old man nearly tottered over; nobody moved to help him. \"Report!\"\n\n\"They're resisting.\" Msuya's voice was even flatter, more distant than before. \"They... they //were// resisting. They're moving into the trains now. They're running away from us.\"\n\n\"As they should.\" Falkirk looked satisfied.\n\n\"Can we get medical...\"\n\nHe overrode the channel. \"You know the answer to that. They removed medical help from the equation themselves. Let me know when the trains are full, and under no circumstances allow any civilian to walk back out of that train.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nLillian slid into his line of sight, leaning up against the console. \"You're not even going to try saving those people?\"\n\n\"That's correct.\" He didn't look at her. \"They're examples now.\"\n\n\"Response train is inbound.\" Eileen couldn't see Falkirk anymore with Lillian in the way, and she was using this as an excuse not to try. She looked devastated; Lillian had never seen a look on her face like that which she herself had not been responsible for putting there. \"Going to stop it at F-D until it's needed.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" the Director nodded.\n\n\"They're in, sir. Most of them.\" Msuya paused meaningfully. \"There's not enough room for everyone. Even with... even with.\"\n\n\"Can you control the ones who are left?\" Falkirk demanded.\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I think we can. They're pretty scared, sir, and we still don't have eye on Ambrogi.\"\n\n\"Execute, Chief Veiksaar.\"\n\n\"Great choice of words,\" Lillian growled, shoving his hand away.\n\n\"We have control of the platform, sir. Ready to begin negotiations.\"\n\nFalkirk looked up at the ceiling, and a look of such sudden and unrestrained glee spread across his withered features that Lillian looked up to see if there was something fantastic on the ceiling. \"You're trained for give-and-take, Dr. Msuya, is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHis horrible grin just kept getting wider. \"There will be no give today.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ 13 October\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\"I wasn't aware of any of that,\" McInnis mused. \"Why wasn't it in the records?\"\n\n\"We'll get to that,\" Ibanez promised him darkly.\n\n\"My record is clean.\" Falkirk was staring sullenly into the middle distance. \"I have nothing to hide. I did my level //best// with the mess you left in my lap, traitor.\"\n\nMcInnis hunched down to look him in the eye. Neither of them shied away, though Falkirk's eyes were bleary with slow-forming cataracts. \"I had attempted to evacuate the nearby locales well before that point. You reported me to Overwatch Command, and they threatened to send Hammer Down to bring us back into line if I did.\"\n\n\"As was my duty,\" Falkirk spat. Still McInnis didn't flinch. \"They sent me here to keep an eye on you, just like your sainted predecessor. And just like him, I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar.\"\n\nHarry knelt beside them. \"Is that what you call trying to help people in need? You can honestly only understand that sort of thing as... selfishness? Grasping for personal gain?\"\n\nFalkirk turned his withering gaze on the archivist. \"Absolutely. Absolutely I can. There's nothing else there. You're fooling yourself if you think it's //nobility,// the things you people do. You're so full of what you //need// to feel //good// about yourselves,\" and he shot a meaningful glance at Lillihammer -- who, apparently expecting it, immediately stuck out her tongue -- \"that you completely lose sight of what we're supposed to be doing here. Protecting people. Protecting //everyone.//\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillian sneered. \"Yeah, you really did a bang-up job of that on Canada Day, didn't you?

What's he asking for?\"\n\nMsuya's reply was bone weary, but Lillian thought she detected an undercurrent of contempt for Falkirk in there as well. Then again, she could have been projecting. Very easily. Or she could have been reading the mood of the room, which had not improved in the three days since the first incident. \"It's not really clear to me. Seems like he's not much of a spokesperson. All the people in that camp want something different.\"\n\nThe tunnel-trapped refugees had reluctantly set up camp where Eileen had stopped them. There were S&C guards keeping them out of a southern bulkhead partition, where Msuya and his team were camped out in a second train. It had been a long, painful standoff to get this far, one highlight of which had been the relief train being bisected by what everyone assumed to have been Ambrogi standing on the tracks, just for shits and giggles.\n\n\"Give me the least boring examples,\" Falkirk yawned.\n\n\"Dormitory accommodation.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A say in Site affairs.\"\n\n\"I asked for interesting examples, not absurd ones.\"\n\n\"Some of them would apparently like to join the security team.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" He turned to his security chief. \"Fancy a few hundred cheap bullet shields?\"\n\n\"I know you're not being serious right now,\" she sighed.\n\n\"In all honesty, there aren't many things they could suggest which I would consider seriously. In your opinion, Chief Msuya, would they be willing to settle down permanently in that tunnel?\"\n\nAnother pregnant pause. \"At present, I would say not. They're nearly as agitated as they were back at H&P.\"\n\nIt wasn't the right thing to say. Falkirk was still hyperactively antsy about that disastrous breach of security. Lillian saw him tense up, even more than his norm,\n\nIbanez saw it too. \"Well, there's nothing they can damage where they are now, so let them stew a little.\"\n\n\"I think I'd rather //stir// the stew, actually,\" the old man purred. \"Here's what you're going to tell them.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"They are required to submit to a full strip search today, in preparation for being pressed into a work detail tomorrow.\"\n\nThe longest pause yet followed, as Msuya weighed what he had just been told and the Operations Control crowd followed suit. \"I don't think--\"\n\n\"A work detail for what?\" Lillian interrupted.\n\n\"Clearing the rubble at H&P. Helping to clean up the mess they created.\"\n\nOn the radio, in the background, someone laughed. It was a desperate, humourless, cynical sound. It probably crackled even without the help of the comms line. \"That isn't going to play well, sir. What can I offer them in return?\"\n\n\"My continued forbearance.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Msuya pressed.\n\n\"You can't keep pulling this shit,\" Lillian interceded. \"They don't know you. They don't know what you're capable of.\"\n\nHe looked her in the eye. He didn't do it often, and when he did, he feigned disgust. Now there was only a vengeful gleam in his irises, a cruel twist to his lip. \"Precisely. I'm going to show them.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath, regretting that it was composed entirely of his air. \"Listen to me. The rest of us are fully aware what a miserable sack of shit you are.\"\n\n\"Doctor--\" Ibanez half-shouted.\n\nFalkirk waved her off. \"No, by all means, let him finish.\"\n\nShe would never get to the point where she didn't hear his little digs, but she would also never get to the point where they meant anything coming from him. She ignored it, as she always did. \"We know when you're at your snapping point. They don't. They think they're dealing with someone reasonable. You're about to take that away from them. You're going to make them really, truly panic if you do this.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"I'm the mind expert around here,\" she reminded him.\n\nHe glanced down at her chest, then back up. \"You don't even know your own mind.\" He turned to the console again. \"Chief Msuya?\"\n\nEileen and Ibanez were both trying to catch Lillian's eye, presumably to offer moral support. She didn't need it. Not against Falkirk. Moral superiority was assured from the start.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" Msuya fairly groaned.\n\n\"Proceed as instructed.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ 13 October\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\"This is how you want to spend the day?\" Still the old man wouldn't get up from his knees.

They could hear the EPAU Chief trying, and failing, to get a word in edgewise. \"He's not happy.\"\n\n\"I don't want them happy,\" Falkirk snapped. \"I want them //compliant.//\"\n\nIt felt pointless to say anything, but Lillian knew she had to. She couldn't just be a bystander while one man with too much power and not enough conscience committed his special crime. \"That crowd is ready to blow.\"\n\nHe rolled his eyes. \"We live in a fallout shelter. Let them blow.\"\n\nIt was a well-timed statement. The harangue was suddenly drowned out by a series of low //boom// sounds, and the granular rattle of cracking stone, and the groans of heavy metal under stress.\n\n\"Shit,\" said Ibanez automatically as she scanned the console. She thumbed the mic, and told Msuya's honour detail: \"Move in!\"\n\n\"God dammit.\" Lillian was also cursing randomly by habit at this point. All of them were, except for Falkirk, who almost seemed to be enjoying himself.\n\n\"Get our people out of there!\" Ibanez restrained herself from shouting, as it wouldn't help to bellow in her people's ears, but only just.\n\n\"What //was// that?\" Falkirk demanded.\n\n\"Detonation in the tunnel,\" Eileen droned.

My console only. Now.\"\n\nShe shrugged weakly. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe walked to the back of the room, where there was a partitioned area and a single podium for use of the Director or the officer of the watch. Lillian saw his eyes racing over the information on his screen, saw his face twitching every which way, and it went on like that for several tedious minutes. They were all left waiting for his judgement, with only the sound of the very old man sucking in air through his perfect teeth to keep them awake.\n\nFinally, he spoke. \"Are our people out?\"\n\n\"They're out,\" Ibanez said. \"They're holding the campers back, but only barely.\"\n\n\"Tell them to use the gas rounds.\"\n\nIbanez's jaw dropped. \"Sir?\"\n\nFalkirk reached down and stabbed at his controls. \"Use gas rounds, Msuya! Push them way past the doors, but //do not enter.//\"\n\nMsuya opened his mic by way of responding. They could hear equipment being readied, but also a low clattering in the distant background, like an endless echo of the rumbling from before.\n\n\"Where is that //coming from,// Chief?\" Falkirk asked.\n\nThe first Chief with an answer was Eileen. \"Best guess, the bedrock. Might be Ambrogi again.\"\n\nLillian's stomach overturned itself, and she fought to keep her lunch down.\n\n\"They're pushing through!\" Msuya suddenly shouted.\n\nFalkirk had been waiting for this moment, apparently, because as soon as the words were out he provided his own: \"Seal the bulkheads.\"\n\n\"Which ones?\" Eileen called back.\n\n\"All of them.\"\n\nAll three women said the same thing at the same time: \"What?\"\n\n\"Do it!\" He gripped the edges of the podium so tightly that colour actually returned to his hands.

Man up! Do your job!\"\n\n\"I'm trying, sir.\" Msuya sounded weaker than before, and Karen wondered if his injuries were beginning to trouble him again. Though his people did excellent patch-up work -- EPAU mostly did psych assessments, as the name suggested, but they were trained paramedics too -- there was no substitute for rest, and that was precisely what he wasn't going to get.\n\n\"Try harder.\" The old man was shaking with rage, his voice cracking with every word. She'd been his personal secretary for only a week, so it didn't mean much, but she completely failed to recognize the specific meaning behind his tone. He sounded tired, too. Was that it? Mere exhaustion?\n\nMsuya yawned on the line. \"I think the crowd is calming down a little, so that's good.\"\n\nFalkirk nodded, wavy grey and white hair bobbing up and down. \"I thought... it might.\"\n\n\"There's still a lot of commotion.\" Msuya sounded speculative, a little confused perhaps. \"It's getting kind of warm in here?\"\n\n\"Don't talk.\" She'd definitely never heard //gentleness// in Falkirk's voice before. \"Conserve your energy.\"\n\nShe wondered if she ought to announce herself, but she didn't want to interrupt.\n\n\"Sir,\" Msuya said with a sudden clarity that startled them both, \"I can't hear the air exchangers.\"\n\nFalkirk nodded, but said nothing.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"The air exchangers are silent, agent.\"\n\nA moment of silence, and then: \"That's not... that's not true.

Bad taste in the mental mouth.\"\n\n\"Good riddance to bad rubbish,\" Nascimbeni agreed.\n\nIt was time to intercede. \"I think I should prefer a more nuanced approach.\"\n\n\"Of course you should,\" Lillihammer murmured.\n\nMcInnis reached down and gently raised the old man's head to face him. \"Edwin Falkirk, I hereby relieve you of the Directorship of Site-43 under my authority as Administrator of the SCP Foundation. Your security clearance credentials will be revoked in full, and all privileges appertaining to your position are rescinded.\"\n\nAll he received in response was \"You'll get what you deserve some day.\"\n\n\"I daresay.\" McInnis walked toward the bulwarks, and the crowd. \"Chief Veiksaar, please contact the Occult and Supernatural Activities Taskforce.

It was cramped quarters, not unlike the senior researcher VIP in Archives and Revision, but it would get the job done until they could re-secure more commodious accommodations. One of McInnis' first acts the previous night had been to release the secondary server hall for general occupation. He had no need to lord his authority over a personal staff, unlike his predecessor — who was presently cooling his heels under guard in the infirmary.\n\n\"Because I'm always the highest-ranking person in any meeting you've seen me at.\"\n\n\"Right.\" Harry scooted his chair in so the rest of the attendees could squeeze past. \"Those are the people who show up last.\"\n\n\"And why do you suppose that is?\"\n\n\"I dunno.

A pair of overlapping red rectangles were fading into existence on his forehead. \"I didn't do anything in 2003.\"\n\n\"Because I ran into you,\" said Ibanez.\n\nThe memeticist gestured at her in support of this assertion. \"And he therefore didn't run into your agents, Del.

Why are they so screwed up, if we stopped the breach? Shouldn't they be normal?\"\n\n\"Best guess?\" Lillihammer shrugged. \"Something cosmological changed in their nature when the breach killed them. Something that makes them different now, something that doesn't change just because the rest of the universe did.\"\n\n\"They've been empowered by something,\" the ASC intoned.\n\nMcInnis caught their eyes, one by one, and asked: \"But what?\"\n\nLillihammer leaned back, banging her head on the server stacks and cursing under her breath. \"It would have to be something intrinsic to reality itself, existing beyond timeline considerations. Something built into the fabric of spacetime.\"\n\nNascimbeni had shifted into what he called Expert Mode, the rarest of his three social selves. He preferred to be either paternal or awkward in his interactions with others, but deep down he was a consummate professional. \"That mix of materials was unprecedented. F-D was turned upside down, inside out, eighth-dimensional and worse. Tessellated and inverted and fractalized and crystallized and converted to raw vacuum, a different bit of lunacy every few feet. It could easily have been that combination of forces. Nobody on Earth is qualified to do the math required to explain what happened. You'd need an entire math universe to work out that problem.\"\n\n\"Or we could get Willie to run a replication study on it.\" Harry punched the shoulder of his colleague's fresh blue labcoat.\n\nWettle punched him back, limply. \"Tried that in Austria, remember? Didn't go well.\"\n\nHarry put his arm around the other man's shoulders, and hugged him sideways. \"I'm so proud of you for finally remembering it was Austria.\"\n\nWettle squirmed out of the hold. \"I get fooled once automatically, so I only really try the second time.\"\n\n\"Saves us the shame, leaves it on you where it belongs.\"\n\nIt was strange, McInnis reflected, how little the idea of being trapped in a bad future seemed to bother the two of them. Then again, very little got through to Wettle. But Harry, Harry was so very sensitive…\n\nIbanez cleared her throat. \"So you figure we're stuck with this mess, then.\"\n\nLillihammer shrugged again. \"I mean, who knows? Like Noè said, it's a hot clusterfuck. But I honestly don't see a way out.\"\n\nThe ASC stood up and placed both palms on the table, the thump audible enough to attract all of their attention. McInnis knew, not that he'd had any doubts, that he'd chosen wisely in trusting his longtime deputy. \"Then we need to engage in spot treatment. Make the best of a bad situation.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" McInnis agreed. \"There is an obvious place to begin: our opposite numbers.\"\n\nWettle looked from person to person yet again. \"I don't have a partner.\"\n\n\"I'm referring to those individuals we've been calling 'the Victims'. I see no reason to update the title; clearly they remain victimized by some force beyond their control. It is our duty to ease their suffering.\"\n\n\"Dibs,\" said Ibanez.\n\nHarry blinked. \"On?\"\n\n\"Just in general.\"\n\nAn uncomfortable silence followed, unbroken even by Wettle. The ASC sat down.\n\nIbanez finally followed up herself. \"Look, we all know how this is going to go. None of you are any use in combat.\"\n\nOkorie tossed her bag of reagents on the table. \"Objection.\"\n\n\"//Almost// none of you are any use in combat, and all of you are //soft.// Ever killed anyone, Udo?\"\n\nOkorie looked away. \"No.\"\n\n\"I would've said yes,\" said Harry. \"Just to mess with her.\" When Okorie didn't look at him, his mood visibly darkened.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I could kill someone,\" Lillihammer reflected.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure you'd cause collateral damage,\" Ibanez said, \"and we've had more than enough of that already. For all we know there aren't the supplies topside to repair this place. As for replacing //people,// that's probably going to be even tougher.\"\n\n\"Memetics are targeted by their nature,\" Lillihammer grumbled.\n\n\"Still not worth it. You're too valuable to risk in combat, and I don't want to look the wrong way and get a faceful of hazard. I'm going to be the bagman, no two ways about it.\"\n\nNascimbeni was pale. \"We're not even going to explore non-fatal solutions?\"\n\nIbanez was adamant. \"That's correct.\"\n\nMcInnis raised a hand. \"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Chief Ibanez, but Chief Nascimbeni has a point. These people did not choose their present stations, and if we could restore them to their former selves...\"\n\n\"Anybody have any bright ideas how to do that?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Again,\" said Lillihammer, \"memetics.\"\n\n\"Forsythe tried that already with Mukami,\" Harry reminded her. \"Didn't take.\"\n\n\"We don't know that was the real Mukami. And forgive me for assuming I'd have more success than a medical nurse at my chosen profession.\"\n\n\"It's not practical,\" Ibanez insisted. \"You want to get up close with Ambrogi or Markey? End up as a flesh stick in some cave somewhere?\"\n\n\"They can still //speak,//\" Nascimbeni protested. \"There's still something in there.\"\n\nThe ASC regarded him with a stern but empathetic countenance. \"Do you have reason to believe that what's in there is //them?//\"\n\n\"She seemed...\" He sighed heavily. \"She didn't seem completely like herself, but it wasn't so far from what I remembered that she seemed completely //alien.// More...\"\n\n\"Attenuated?\" suggested Lillihammer.\n\n\"Attenuated works.\"\n\n\"Attenuated //means...?//\" Wettle asked.\n\n\"Maybe you were too eager to dip your wick to see the obvious facts,\" Ibanez told Nascimbeni, eyes flashing.\n\nHarry did a double-take. \"Okay.\"\n\nWettle broke the awkward silence first. \"I bet Alis could figure something out.\"\n\nIbanez rolled her eyes. \"I still think we should execute Alis.\"\n\n\"We will address Dr. Naylor shortly,\" McInnis assured her. \"At this time I am interested in termination procedures for the Victims.\" Nascimbeni began to protest again, and McInnis held up a hand to silence him. \"//If// we are able to cure them of their possession, should they indeed be possessed, I promise you that will become our main priority. For now we must assume they died on the eighth of last September, and we face only cruel mockeries of the people they once were.\"\n\n\"Let's proceed alphabetically,\" the ASC suggested. \"Propose solutions as they occur to you. Ambrogi?\"\n\n\"Shoot him with a gun,\" said Ibanez.\n\nNascimbeni looked stricken. \"Delfina.\"\n\n\"I met this guy.\" Harry shook his head. \"Molten metal didn't faze him.\"\n\n\"A big gun, then. If we can get into R&E, Bremmel has this absolute monstrosity socked away--\"\n\n\"//Did// have,\" Lillihammer corrected once again. \"I snatched it while escaping, stashed it in a dorm room. Told Allan, didn't have time to tell you yet.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just bring it here?\" Harry asked her.\n\n\"Because I heard fucking //Falkirk// was the Director.\"\n\n\"So,\" the ASC nodded, \"you propose attacking Ambrogi with this weapon, Chief Ibanez?\"\n\n\"That's insane.\" Nascimbeni pulled off his ballcap, and scratched at his hair. The cap, McInnis noticed, was also not his usual beaten-down version. Thereon hung a story. \"He's hiding in a honeycomb network of caves. You'll never find him.\"\n\n\"He wasn't shy,\" Harry argued. \"Last I saw.\"\n\n\"He will be if he knows you can kill him. I haven't seen anything to suggest that they've gone stupid, or suicidal.\"\n\nIbanez was sighing repeatedly now, over and over on loop. \"So I'll go on the hunt. Won't be the first time.\"\n\nThe ASC gestured at Nascimbeni. \"I understand that J&M conducted searches of the caves in the early days of the conflict, Chief. You likely have some files you can share with Chief Ibanez, to aid in her search.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he's thrilled,\" she snorted.\n\n\"You think I don't want this to be over?! I just…\"\n\n\"We know, Chief.\" McInnis raised his hand yet again. He was beginning to feel like a school teacher. \"Trust me. There will be other consultations before I approve any aggressive action. All possible avenues of approach will be considered. You have my word on that.\"\n\n\"So,\" the ASC continued. \"Del Olmo?\"\n\n\"Is likely not at Site-43.\" McInnis glanced at Lillihammer, who twitched. \"Nothing has been heard from him for a long, long time. We must assume he's either dead, or in hiding.\"\n\"Gwilherm?\"\n\n\"I'm going to want to talk to Brenda about that,\" Okorie began.\n\n\"Bet you are.\"\n\n\"Fuck off, Harry.\"\n\nMcInnis was considering leaving his hand in the air at this point. \"Please.\"\n\n\"Gwilherm is best considered a deific threat.\" Okorie fixed Harry with a glare that dared him to interrupt again. \"Radcliffe certainly thinks so. She's displayed easily the most extreme capabilities of each Victim. Hopefully we can conduct our other… operations, quietly enough that she isn't contacted. She ought to be the last one we tackle. The longer we can keep her away from 43, the better.\"\n\n\"Aw.\" Wettle looked like a scolded puppy.\n\nThe ASC nodded at him. \"Something to add?\"\n\n\"She and I were getting to know each other when the big switcheroo happened.\"\n\nHarry frowned. \"Getting to know each other how?\"\n\nThe other man suddenly grinned. \"Getting to know each other //and// how.\"\n\nLillihammer began to choke. She hadn't been eating or drinking.\n\n\"What?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Pardon?\" said Okorie.\n\n\"I can't breathe!\" Lillihammer protested.\n\n\"Are you insinuating,\" McInnis said slowly, \"that you indulged in sexual activities with Janet Gwilherm, Dr. Wettle?\"\n\n\"She was the indulging one. I just kinda lay back, and let her go at it.\"\n\nHarry placed his face on the table. \"Yeah, no, I can't be hearing this. I just can't.\"\n\n\"Grow up,\" Okorie snapped.\n\nHis head snapped back up. \"Fucking //picture it,// would you?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Lillihammer interrupted, her voice now scratchy and awkward, \"as revolting as this is, it might provide an angle.\"\n\n\"If she did him once,\" Harry muttered, \"she's bound not to do it again.\"\n\nWettle poked him in the shoulder. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Let me mull this one over.\" Lillihammer had obviously only asked for permission as a formality; her expression was already distant, and growing more so. \"I'll figure something out.\"\n\n\"Technician Markey?\" the ASC continued.\n\nIbanez flexed her fingers. \"He'll be with Ambrogi, more or less. Two birds, one gun.\"\n\n\"If it comes to that.\"\n\n\"Yes, Noè, if it doesn't come to shooting them, I will not shoot them, because //causality.//\"\n\nThe ASC gently tapped the table. \"Agent Mukami?\"\n\nMcInnis answered before anyone else had the chance. \"I'm not sure what the mechanism will be, but I suspect my involvement will be necessary.\"\n\nHis deputy was obviously taken aback. \"That is a terrible idea, sir, with respect.\"\n\n\"It certainly is. But Agent Mukami is behaving like the tyrant of Site-43, and has engaged in frequent dialogues with members of my staff. She clearly wishes to converse, proselytize, spread her ideology. With sufficiently bolstered cognitohealth, I believe I could resist her temptations.\"\n\nIbanez harrumphed. \"Nice to see a man who's willing to try.\"\n\n\"You want to have this conversation here?\" Nascimbeni nearly shouted at her. \"In the boardroom? With them?\" He gestured at the others.\n\n\"Stay on topic, please,\" the ASC entreated them. \"If the Administrator can lure Mukami into a conversation — which I remain unconvinced is the safest course of action — how might we use that to our advantage?\"\n\nLillihammer drifted back to Earth, reluctantly, after Harry gently shook her shoulders. \"We need to figure out what kinds of effect work on her.\"\n\n\"Oh, good.\" Nascimbeni picked up his hat again, and slapped it onto his scalp. \"Now you're going to suggest we torture the one we have in custody.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that.\" Lillihammer pointed at him, and pulled an imaginary trigger. \"Thanks for being the one to say it.\"\n\n\"And we're the good guys,\" he spat.\n\n\"Hey,\" said Harry, \"don't know if you've been to the auditorium lately, but there's a lot of body bags full of people who'd say yes, definitely, we're the good guys in this situation.\"\n\nThe ASC straightened in his chair, casting a blinkenlight shadow over them. \"I think we can table this until further investigation is done into Agent Mukami's cognition, however we want to approach that. Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" McInnis nodded. \"The less we discuss divisive options at this point, the better. We all need to remain on roughly the same page, if not line and verse.\"\n\n\"Radcliffe, then.\"\n\nIbanez rolled her eyes again. \"Nobody's seen hide nor hair, but he never shuts the fuck up.\"\n\n\"Possible he's in the command centre?\" Harry suggested.\n\n\"I didn't see him,\" said Lillihammer. \"Everyone talked like he was long, long gone. Far away.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" McInnis tapped each of the fingers of his right hand on the table, in sequence, once. \"We could engage Chief Veiksaar in a test of his signal strength. Determine the likely distance of his transmission station.\"\n\n\"What if he doesn't have one?\" Wettle flinched, as though expecting to be laughed at or struck with a piece of cardboard. When that didn't immediately happen, he continued: \"What if his magic power is ventriloquism?\"\n\n\"That is a legitimate consideration,\" McInnis acknowledged.\n\n\"Yay.\" Wettle smiled contentedly. He would likely check out for the remainder of the meeting, now.\n\n\"I think we will conduct the test anyway, however. Narrow down the possibilities.\"\n\n\"And if we find him?\" Harry asked. \"What then?\"\n\n\"An entirely new threat assessment will be made. We know the least about what he is capable of.\"\n\n\"Fun times,\" Lillihammer yawned.\n\n\"That leaves Dr. Wirth,\" the ASC concluded.\n\n\"And you can leave that one to me,\" the memeticist half-sang. All traces of boredom drained out of her expression and posture.\n\nMcInnis shook his head. \"I would prefer to explore all possible alternatives, rather than—\"\n\n\"I could kill him today.\"\n\nEveryone, Wettle included, stared at her.\n\n\"Oh, what, nobody can top that? Colour me surprised.\"\n\n\"I…\" McInnis found his frown dissipating into a smile. \"…will take your word for it at the moment, Dr. Lillihammer, though I expect a thorough explanation of your plan before I approve it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that'll take all of a minute. Could do it now if you want.\"\n\n\"There's no need. Killing Dr. Wirth would signal to the others that we are moving against them, and capable of doing so. It can only be done when we are prepared to put the remaining plans in operation as well.\"\n\n\"Cool. It does have to be first, though. Can't so much as walk around out there without him poking in your skull, so Del wouldn't make it halfway to the caverns.\"\n\n\"Why is it,\" Harry asked, \"that he didn't go after me or Melissa?\"\n\n\"That's a very good question,\" Ibanez nodded.\n\n\"Come to think of it...\" Lillihammer started tugging on her long orange locks. \"It's strange I had so much control over my faculties while he was in //my// head.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" the ASC asked, \"that the lot of you are protected from the effect, in some sense?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Nascimbeni. \"Fuck.\"\n\nMcInnis gestured at him. \"Chief?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. OSAT.\"\n\n\"What about OSAT?\"\n\n\"That's why I thought... that's why they thought she wasn't the same as the rest.\" He reached up to slap his forehead, and instead struck the brim of his hat. It flew backward off his head. \"She //was// trying to control me, because of course she was. She just //couldn't.// And that got everyone killed.\"\n\nMcInnis lowered his voice to a tone more soothing than commanding. \"That misunderstanding, if indeed it's the case, had little to no effect on what transpired next.\"\n\n\"They gave us more leeway because they thought I might be right. I was wrong. And now they're all dead.\"\n\n\"There was no way for you to have known.\"\n\nThe old technician was sinking lower and lower in his seat. \"I just didn't want to believe she was bad. It's my fault.\"\n\n\"Yeah, a bit.\" Ibanez made a rolling motion with both hands. \"Now get over yourself and help us fix our shit.\"\n\nThe ASC looked to McInnis. \"I take it there will be further meetings in this vein?\"\n\n\"Yes. I intend to add to this inner circle. Individuals we can trust with the facts of our true nature. I am open to suggestions.\"\n\n\"Melissa,\" said Harry.\n\n\"Brenda,\" said Okorie.\n\n\"Alis,\" said Wettle.\n\n\"No!\" said Lillihammer. \"Moron!\"\n\n\"I had also considered Dr. Reynders, Chief Veiksaar and Dr. Elstrom,\" said McInnis. \"If and when they are freed from the grasp of our enemies, Dr. Ngo, Dr. Du, Dr. Sokolsky and Dr. Euler would also be vital allies.\"\n\nLillihammer guffawed. \"You just said 'Sokolsky' in the context of 'trust'.\"\n\n\"It was a very specific context of trust. I trust him not to reveal our secret to the rest of our staff.\"\n\n\"And what's our endgame?\" Harry asked. \"If we manage to take out all seven of these obstacles, one way or another?\"\n\n\"Then, Dr. Blank, we rebuild. We attempt to restore some equilibrium to this world. We correct the catastrophe, so far as we are capable.\"\n\nThere was a meaningful glint in the archivist's eye, now. \"It might be helpful if we actually knew the extent of said catastrophe.\"\n\nLillihammer put an arm around his shoulder. \"That sounds like a you job.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"I shall make my files available to you, Dr. Blank.\"\n\n\"Huzzah.\" He raised his hands in mock victory. \"I've always wanted to write the history of an alternate world. Never expected it to come to me, though.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/32-executive-dysfunction| previous-title=Executive Dysfunction\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/34-the-cruelest-fight | next-title=The Cruelest Fight\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-tomorrow-hub | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Wrong Tomorrow\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** Everything!\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
