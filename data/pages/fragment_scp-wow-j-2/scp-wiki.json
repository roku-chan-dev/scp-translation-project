Should object containment be compromised, MTF Episilon-69 \"Sweet Boys\" are authorized to attempt to attempt to recover any personnel suspected of infection via dissemination of counter-memetics imagery inscribed on lead tablets introduced directly to the affected personnel's brainstem.\n\nUnder no circumstances should this document be deleted from the Foundation databanks.\n\n**Description:** SCP-WOW-J is to be considered a 5 km by 5 km by 5km cube. SCP-WOW-J's almost random description errors are assumed to be due to its anomalous nature. SCP-WOW-J cannot be intentionally observed. SCP-WOW-J also causes any personnel to indirectly see it as a different anomalous object. Foundation researchers are sure that SCP-WOW-J harbours a memetic effect. We're not sure what it is, but there definitely is one. If you figure it out, send it to scp.wow.j.research@gmail.com, thanks. Foundation researchers are also encouraged to submit their SCP-WOW-J forms to their Site head.\n\n**Addendum 01:** \n##white| **Inigo Montoya:** My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.  \n//Inigo Montoya charges into battle, his mechanical dragon body unleashing a literally supernova onto the battlefield as various weapons fold in and out of various orifices.// - Dr. Fynegan##\n\nIn the event of SCP-WOW-J continuing, all parties who participated in the creation of SCP-WOW-J are to be terminated for what they have done. They know what they did, they know they deserve it, monsters.\n\n**Addendum 02:**\nThe author of this SCP, Dr. Fynegan, was allowed to monitor and make minor edits (provided that they are clearly Dr. Fynegan’s) to submitted SCP-WOW-Js under O5 orders.\n\n+++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-wow-j/offset/0 « BACK]",
