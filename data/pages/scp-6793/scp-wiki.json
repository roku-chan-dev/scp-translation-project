Inherent logistical and practical limitations involved hamper Foundation testing and research efforts. \n\nProposed containment strategies for SCP-6793 include:\n\n* Creating permanent overcast weather conditions, either through dynamic rendering of weather patterns over impacted regions or for the entirety of Earth itself\n\n* Building an artificial sky around the planet and assuming control of all flight operations on Earth\n\n* Building a Dyson sphere around the Sun and harvesting majority of Mercury for use in creating a containment area/separating panel large enough to obscure the view of SCP-6793 from Earth\n\n* Utilizing various possible strategies to increase light pollution in the solar system such that observing SCP-6793 is impossible\n\n//Testing with SCP-6793 is no longer permitted. As of 10/23/2040, SCP-6793 is classified Cernunnos-Numen.//[[footnote]]Containment of anomaly pertaining to a demiurge is possible, albeit logistically difficult to the point of being impractical.

This tangent, hypothesized to be an atypical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_string cosmic string], exists on an angle that briefly intercepts interplanetary space, on the far side of the asteroid belt. SCP-6793 is only visible due to its perceived brightness, although measurements taken imply the anomaly emits no photons, radiation, or energy/particles of any known type and thus lacks luminance altogether. \n\nSCP-6793 is not tangible and cannot be \"deactivated\"; intersecting portions of the anomaly does not discretely extinguish it. This is presumed homogenous for the entirety of SCP-6793's length but has yet to be confirmed. \n\nIf a living creature's brain intersects with SCP-6793, varying sensory phenomena occurs. This is shown to be dependent on which part of the brain is receiving \"stimuli\", though experimentation has concluded that optimal results occur when SCP-6793 is intersecting a human subject's temporal and right parietal lobe simultaneously. The anomaly contains information that is conveyed via an unknown medium, despite no outward emission of detectable forces. Experimentation has revealed SCP-6793 is capable of causing atrophy and lesions in certain brain structures due to prolonged exposure and/or application to other parts of the brain, however, no maximum exposure duration or risk factors have been identified. \n\nOccasionally, SCP-6793 will flicker and dim for a variable amount of time. The anomaly will then cease for roughly eight hours and thirty minutes, resuming shortly thereafter. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ADDENDUM 6793-1A: DISCOVERY [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n//In March of 2035, the Foundation's Astrophysical Anomalies Department proposed the construction of Research Contact Station TYCHO, a long-term observatory and rendezvous point orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres.// \n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=300\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=50%\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/thebillith/CERES\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Inner solar system, including SCP-6793, Ceres, and RCS TYCHO.
