Access to the Foundation observation post in Antuco is restricted to Foundation personnel with 5/5227 clearance.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=fog.png|\n    caption=Foliage in Antuco.\n]]\n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-5227 was an anomalous weather formation centered around Antuco, an abandoned Chilean village, and lasted from June 8th to 10th, 1976. SCP-5227 manifested as a fog descending on Antuco and completely covered the village, drastically reducing visibility and communications. The anomaly was originally identified as such due to its observational anomaly and rapid formation-- weather sensors at Facility 57, 23km from Antuco, depicted SCP-5227 as a static blur during its three-minute formation (1:07AM - 1:10AM local time). Attempts to hail the Foundation observation post in Antuco through radio resulted in failure. Further testing confirmed SCP-5227 had the anomalous capability to block radio transmissions.\n\nA 3-man expedition from MTF PI-3 \"Garcas Oligarcas\" was planned to ascertain the status of Antuco. Several hours before departure, another agent was added to the expedition. The thick forest surrounding Antuco and the exceedingly low visibility made vehicular and aerial travel infeasible. The team departed Facility 57 on foot at T+6 hours.\n\n\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ ADDENDUM 5227.1\n+++ {{EXPEDITION LOGS -- 6.8.1976}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Click to confirm credentials ▼\" hide=\"▲ Hide Addendum ▲\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ EXPEDITION LOG EXCERPTS\n+  CHILEAN INTERIOR\n-----\n[[/=]]\n**MTF PI-3 \"GARCAS OLIGARCAS\"**\n* π3-ALPHA - VALENTINO SCIPIONI //(SOURCE)//\n* π3-BETA - PEDRO CASEROS\n* π3-GAMMA - ALEJANDRO PETROCCHI\n* π3-DELTA - DAMIÁN GARLÉS\n----\n= **<<BEGIN EXCERPT>>**\n----\n//[Team is hiking through the jungle.

All you need to know is that people much higher up than you have very specific instructions about what is going to happen here. You are obligated to help me stop this mess.\n\n**PETROCCHI:** We saw the fog's source, it was coming from the center of town. Why are we all the way out here?\n\n**GARLÉS:** This is the best spot to get a signal out. A minor weakness in the anomaly's structural integrity, exploited using paratechnology.\n\n//[GARLÉS reaches into his bag and pulls out a small spherical device with a blue light.]//\n\n**SCIPIONI:** What is that?\n\n**GARLÉS:** It is a radio signaller, amplified using thamaturgy. Just enough to punch through SCP-5227.\n\n**PETROCCHI:** Who are you signalling to?\n\n**GARLÉS:** Fifty-seven. More specifically to an air squadron stationed there on standby. Once they get the signal, they'll give us a small delay and then bomb this hellhole to kingdom come.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Why? What are you trying to destroy?\n\n**GARLÉS:** That's classified.\n\n//[GARLÉS turns away to the table to begin setting up the device.]//\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Okay. All I know is that suddenly the greenhorn is claiming to be a Level 5 secret agent, one of my team members is dead in the dust by your hand, you won't let us even investigate what's causing this. Our job. I don't know //who// you are, but\n\n**GARLÉS:** I'm afraid this is a matter of internal Foundati-\n\n//[Gunshot. GARLÉS' calf spurts blood and he crashes to the floor, dropping the device.]//\n\n**GARLÉS:** FUCK!\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Sorry... sir, but you've killed a Foundation operator and are hindering the proper investigation of the anomaly. I am hereby relieving you of command. We're finding out what's causing this. The wound's not lethal, and there's a first aid kit in the locker.\n\n//[PETROCCHI advances and takes the transmitter from the floor.]//\n\n**PETROCCHI:** And we're taking this.\n\n**GARLÉS:** You... you two don't know what you're doing. You're going to ruin everything. I'm ordering you to stop-\n\n**SCIPIONI:** I'm sorry, Damian. We'll be back.\n\n//[SCIPIONI and PETROCCHI exit the hut, closing the door behind them.]//\n-----\n= **<<END EXCERPT>>**\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ ADDENDUM 5227.3\n+++ {{SEALED TO CLEARANCE 5/5227 }}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Click to confirm credentials ▼\" hide=\"▲ Welcome, Overseer ▲\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ EXPLORATION LOG\n+ SATELLITE FACILITY 57**β**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n**MTF ALPHA-1 \"RED RIGHT HAND\"**\n* α1-ALPHA - DAMIÁN GARLÉS \n\n**MTF PI-3 \"GARCAS OLIGARCAS\"**\n* π3-ALPHA - VALENTINO SCIPIONI //(SOURCE)//\n* π3-GAMMA - ALEJANDRO PETROCCHI\n----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n[!-- //[GARLÉS walks through SCP-5227, limping. His face is clothed in a gas mask. His flashlight illuminates the immediate path. After several minutes of walking, he stops in front of a small wooden shack near the center of Antuco. The door is open and the doorknob has been torn out. He enters, revealing a spartan living space with a bed and table. The fog is thick inside the room. A rug on the floor has been thrown aside to reveal an open metal trapdoor set into the ground. The hatchway, wide enough for one man, contains a small iron ladder and fog obscures the bottom. GARLÉS sighs through his mask and fits his flashlight to a shoulder holster before entering the trapdoor and descending the small ladder.]//\n\n//[After several seconds of descending, GARLÉS reaches the bottom of the ladder. He turns in the tight space to face a steel door. The electronic lock has been smashed, and the door hangs ajar. He pushes through, but the dense fog obscures vision. He runs his hand along the wall near the doorway until his hands find a a switch that he pulls. A loud rumbling is heard, along with masculine voices conversing. Industrial fans set into the grilled floor begin turning, quickly sucking away the fog.]//\n\n//[In a few seconds, the majority of the fog has been removed. GARLÉS is in a large, high industrial area, with several metal walkways overhead. Pipes and computer displays cover the walls, focusing in the center of the room around a large industrial vat set into the floor. The vat is filled with a greyish-green liquid and fog rises from its surface steadily. SCIPIONI and PETROCCHI are standing around the vat, facing GARLÉS. Their faces are obscured by scarves tied around their noses and mouths.]// --]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image lab.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nFacility\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n**SCIPIONI:** What the hell?

Somewhere.\n\n//[The two feel their way around the facility for a few minutes, inspecting the industrial equipment.  The fog impairs visibility to only a few meters. They stop in front of a wall of computer equipment.]//\n\n**PETROCCHI:** Valentino. Look here.\n\n//[One of the monitors is still powered on. Its screen displays a slowly rotating Foundation logo. A prompt to enter Foundation credentials is present.]//\n\n**SCIPIONI:** ... Shit.\n\n**PETROCCHI:** That's where I've seen this before. The science wing at 57 is loaded with these kinds of pipes and electronics. I don't think that shack on the edge of town was the outpost, Valentino.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Yeah. But... why? Why would they build this?\n\n//[Both look at the monitor.]//\n\n**SCIPIONI:** In for a penny, in for a pound.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]] __SATELLITE FACILITY 57-BETA__[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@------@@\nWelcome, **VALENTINO SCIPIONI**\n@@------@@\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n> Disk wipe failed at 99.4% completion. **2** deleted missives flagged in local memory.\n| view list\n> 1.

In a few seconds, the majority of the fog has been removed and the facility is visible in its whole. Pipes and computer displays cover the walls, focusing in the center of the room around a large industrial vat set into the floor. The vat is filled with a greyish-green liquid and fog rises from its surface steadily. A massive metal cross is suspended above it, upside down and coated in a brown fluid, which slowly drips into the vat. GARLÉS is in the doorway, wearing a gas mask and clutching his thigh.]//\n\n**GARLÉS:** Damn. I was hoping you'd have missed it.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** You all did a good job hiding the place.\n\n**GARLÉS:** Hiding things from the rest of the Foundation is my job, Valentino.\n\n**PETROCCHI:** You're all fucking insane.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Alejandro-\n\n**PETROCCHI:** No, really. I don't believe in God, but I know that you don't play with things you don't understand. People stationed at this outpost have the highest turnover rate in the sector. I always thought it was because of the isolation, but no, it's because you buried a fucking monster underneath them! How many people have ended up like Pedro?!\n\n**GARLÉS:** Look. I'm sorry about Pedro, I am. He was a casualty, and it was my fault. But I didn't make the thing that did that to him.\n\n**PETROCCHI:** And where is it, huh?

None are able to reach the facility. Inside, the vat bubbles.]// \n\n**SCIPIONI:** It's... protecting itself.\n\n**GARLÉS:** Then it's sentient.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** And intelligent. It knows what bombs are. You might've left an infant down here then, but... it's not a baby anymore.\n\n//[The bombs suspended in the air suddenly flip, before rocketing back up through the sky and colliding with one of the bombers. The plane violently fulminates in a burst of flame. The other bombs in the air also flip, but do not ascend.]//\n\n**GARLÉS:** Fuck! Jesus Christ, it's murderous! \n\n**SCIPIONI:** We attacked it with planes and bombs, Damián! What is it supposed to do!?\n\n//[GARLÉS cocks his pistol. SCIPIONI does the same.]//\n\n**GARLÉS:** Move, Valentino! That's an order!\n\n**SCIPIONI:** You're not actually trying to kill it, are you? Are you //insane?// What makes you think you can kill a god?\n\n**GARLÉS:** Why on Earth are you //protecting it//? You saw what it did to Pedro, to the observers, to the flight crew! Suppressing things like these is your job!\n\n**SCIPIONI:** Creating them isn't. And //you// killed Pedro, you son of a bitch.\n\n//[GARLÉS advances as SCIPIONI backs up towards the vat.]//\n\n**GARLÉS:** You're compromised. Just like he was. Protecting it against all odds. Now move.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** You made a god, Damián. You can't just put a bullet in its head and expect it to die.\n\n**GARLÉS:** Let me fix it, goddammit!\n\n**SCIPIONI:** You're just afraid. You brought a god into this world, you did experiments on it, you left it in a vat for //years//, and now you're afraid that it's violent? You cannot weaponize a tool that you're expecting to be stabbed in the back with! And you sure as hell can't get rid of it this easy.\n\n**GARLÉS:** For all we know it's not even a fucking god. Just some fucked up //thing// that we brewed in a vat and decided to deify.\n\n**SCIPIONI:** It doesn't matter if it's actually a god or not. You- the entire Council fears this thing like a god. It doesn't matter what it is, it might as well be a god. You all gave it this kind of power. You can't control what it does with it anymore. Symbols have power, you know that.\n\n**GARLÉS:** Then what the fuck are we supposed to do? Just not be scared of it?\n\n//[SCIPIONI's heel reaches the rim of the vat.]//\n\n**SCIPIONI:** You can't have a god with just fear. You need faith. Trust me.\n\n//[SCIPIONI spins backward, raising his pistol and emptying the magazine at the chain suspending the inverted cross above the vat. The chain breaks, dropping the cross into the vat where it begins sinking. An infantile screeching rings out as the bombs suspended in the sky begin detonating one by one. The fluid in the vat, displaced by the cross, begins flooding into the chamber. Camera feed abruptly cuts out at the same time as the shrieking.]//\n-----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\nFollowing the termination of the camera feed, all bombs suspended in the air above Antuco simultaneously detonated at low altitude, out of range of aircraft. The exterior facade of Satellite Facility 57-Beta collapsed, and ground troops conducted an excavation operation to breach into the building.\n\nThe body of Supervisory Agent Damián Garlés was discovered; the cause of death was determined to have been respiration of the vat amniotic fluid. The vat itself was completely drained. Captain Valentino Scipioni was found at the bottom  in a state of shock, sitting next to an unidentified desiccated corpse crushed by the large metal cross. Captain Scipioni has been amnesticized following a full medical recovery.\n\nProject Divinidad is considered **##red|closed.##**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5226]]] | SCP-5227 | [[[SCP-5228]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** antucobush.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Forest Bush Bushes\n> **Author:** UH\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [http://needpix.com/photo/107475 Needpix]\n\n> **Filename:** antucoheader.png\n> **Author:** [[*user almarduk]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** antucojungle.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Talaku Karen village peacefully located in the jungle.jpg\n> **Author:** Palukiwa\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/file:talaku_Karen_village_peacefully_located_in_the_jungle.jpg Wikipedia]\n\n> **Filename:** antucowater.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Jungle Village Rural Primitive\n> **Author:** Unknown Author\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [http://pxhere.com/en/photo/721 Pxhere]\n\n> **Filename:** camp.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Diamond cross pendant\n> **Author:** Lorraine Hughes\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://flickr.com/142911002@N05/27286154085 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** fog.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Starr-180312-0687-Bocconia frutescens-habit in mist fog-Kahikinui-Maui (41240400921).jpg\n> **Author:** [http://starrenvironmental.com Forest & Kim Starr]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:starr-180312-0687-Bocconia_frutescens-habit_in_mist_fog-Kahikinui-Maui_(41240400921).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** lab.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** VIEW OF MASH TUNS\n> **Author:** Ireland’s Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [http://vinepair.com/articles/a-collection-of-century-old-photos-of-guinnesss-brewery-allow-you-to-walk-through-history VINEPAIR]\n\n> **Filename:** rounderfog.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** 20161002124536 - Foggy rainforest on the Mt Bartle Frere descent\n> **Author:** Felix Dance\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://flickr.com/felixdance/29963544392 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** vat.png\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-5227 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Aleppo soap - vat.jpg\n> **Author:** Bernard Gagnon\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:aleppo_soap_-_vat.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
