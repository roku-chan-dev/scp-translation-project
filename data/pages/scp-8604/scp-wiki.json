  "content": "Object class: Euclid\n\nSpecial Containment procedures:\nScp-8604 is to be kept in a 4 meter x 6 meter steel chamber in Cell 49A at Site-59. An IV bag of hallucinogenic drugs is to be hooked up to Scp-8604 at all times to keep him in a dormant state. Only D-Class personnel are permitted to change Scp-8604's IV, and are required to wear a hazmat suit whilst doing so to prevent infection. The change is to be done every 4 days.\n\nDescription:\nScp-8604 is a french mime that appears to be a severely malnourished male aged 21-26. He has black and white painted skin reminiscent of a 1920's mime, but it appears to be a direct attribute of Scp-8604's skin. His white stripes have a medium-yellowish hue, and he is fully covered in a viscous soapy fluid, titled Scp-8604-1. A verbal conversation with Scp-8604 has proven to be impossible, because he is mute. Any attempts to kill Scp-8604 have been unfruitful, as he appears to have healing powers similar to those given by Scp-006. However, the healing powers seem to be 100s of times more powerful than those given by Scp-006.\n\nUpon coming into contact with Scp-8604's skin, more specifically Scp-8604-1, the person will contract a terrible liver infection similar to Hepatitis B. Every case, 6 to be exact, has proven 100% fatal. Upon someone dying of Scp-8604's disease, Scp-8604 will begin to fold his body into a singularity, before the victim's body begins to mutate into Scp-8604, thus giving him life again. When Scp-8604 walks, The Entertainer by Scott Joplin plays from an unidentifiable source. Scp-8604 is very aggressive and short-tempered, although he heavily lowers his hostility when in contact with people who are polite to him.\n\nScp-8604 was discovered and captured in an abandoned apartment building in Lyon, France by Site-59's Task Force Whiskey on November 5th, 2019. Scp-8604 appeared to be confused by 21st century technology, but has managed to become accustomed to it. Scp-8604 has appeared to show interest when shown images from the early 20th Century.\n\nAdditional Notes: The drug used to put Scp-8604 at ease are a mix of 10% Y-909, 40% AMN-C227, and 50% Black Tar Heroin.",
