She wasn't a spy, or a psychologist, or a lawyer, but she had spent two decades in information technology so she knew a great deal about lying. She knew that nobody had ever directly admitted to stepping, or sitting, or falling on a company laptop or tablet. She knew that everybody who'd ever been issued a desktop computer with internet access had used it for personal browsing. She knew that no software was bug-free, no hardware ever performed to spec, and no instruction manual for software //or// hardware perfectly reflected the shipped product.\n\nHer cynicism about technology had become a general cynicism, since technology essentially defined her life as Chief of Identity and Technocryptography at Site-43. So when Daniil Sokolsky woke her up in the middle of the night and said he was flying her to ETTRA headquarters, Area-09 in the Great Basin Desert, she suspected it might be a lie. When she saw they were taking a jet instead of a helicopter, she decided it was //likely// a lie. When she discovered that the jet's windows were opaqued, she knew with the absolute certainty of a woman who had replaced dozens of cellphones which had absolutely, positively not been dropped into toilets that Sokolsky wasn't taking her to Nevada.\n\nShe kept a straight face for the entire ride over, the two of them casually ignoring each other. Sokolsky pretended he wasn't trying to deceive her, and she pretended to be deceived. But when the plane finally shuddered to a stop, and the pilot announced that they'd arrived, she looked Sokolsky square in the eyes and said \"So, where are we?\"\n\nHe looked pleased by the question, and made no effort to dissimulate. \"Poland.\"\n\nShe arched an eyebrow at him. \"What's in Poland?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"So //that's// why you never tell me anything.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe front-facing superstructure of Site-120 was unprepossessing even by Foundation standards: a gigantic disused factory, all rust and concrete and obscured glass, towering over the broad embankments of a river. Once they moved past the facade, however, Veiksaar and Sokolsky found themselves in a fairly standard set of offices, archives and cafeterias. A pair of agents escorted them into the lower levels, past the containment wings and laboratories, past the vast anomalous library, down to where the Site's more technical apparatus was stored.\n\nThey emerged from the elevator to find themselves in a long tiled tunnel lined with pipes, electrical conduits and exposed wires. Some of them looked new, zip-tied together or spliced with electrical tape. They could hear arguing in the distance, and it was getting closer.\n\n\"Please stop,\" was the first thing Veiksaar heard clearly. The voice was young, tired, and vaguely accented; Polish, she guessed.\n\n\"Just //listen,//\" said a second voice, high, strident, excited. \"He's telling me we can increase energy efficiency elevenfold, and all we have to do is consume a few more moulderin—\"\n\n\"There's no more time!\" The first man appeared around a bend in the tunnel, the second a purple blur bouncing up and down at his heels. \"They'll be here any...\" He noticed Veiksaar, Sokolsky and their escorts waiting at the elevator, and waved weakly. \"They're here.\"\n\nThe second man waved both hands at them, the absurd multicoloured flair on his violent violet labcoat sparkling under the fluorescent light. \"Hello! It's ready! Well //yes I know, it's ALMOST ready, there's no point disappointing them.//\" He delivered this aside to the empty air over the first man's shoulders. The first man clutched at his spiked black hair with his thick white gloves, and groaned.\n\nSokolsky pointed at him. \"Director Daniel Asheworth, Ontokinetics.\" Veiksaar nodded. //Reality-bending.// \n\nSokolsky pointed to the second man, and Veiksaar nodded pre-emptively. \"I know that guy, he was at 43 last month under an assumed name.\"\n\nAsheworth and his giddy compatriot reached them just as she said this, and the latter stuck out his hand for her to shake. \"That's me,\" he said. \"But I didn't //assume// my name the way you //presume.// Placeholder McDoctorate, at your service.\"\n\nVeiksaar shook his hand; his hand was trembling. \"You under deep cover, or something?\"\n\nHe shook his shaggy head. \"No, I'm under a curse. If I told you my real name, //no, obviously I'm not going to tell her,// you'd forget it in an instant. Pataphysics is a dangerous game, and I wasn't always such a skilled player.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Who are you talking to? When you're not talking to the people I can see.\"\n\n\"He's talking to himself,\" Asheworth sighed. \"From 2034.\"\n\nShe nodded again. \"If you don't want to tell me...\"\n\n\"It's the truth,\" said Sokolsky. \"These gentlemen have been working very hard to enable our activities today, and they've had to work some unusual angles.\"\n\n\"And what might those activities be?\" she asked.\n\n\"They're going to make me more copies of the password.\"\n\nShe stretched her mouth out in a gesture of exasperation. \"How?\"\n\nSokolsky grinned. \"They're going to make more copies of //me.//\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"That's not quite right, of course,\" said Asheworth as he led them deeper into the facility.\n\n\"It's not //remotely// right,\" Placeholder muttered. \"And it won't get righter if you get your explanations from Dr. Magic, here.\"\n\n\"At least my magic makes sense,\" Asheworth retorted. \"And I like to think I've spent enough time on this project that I could explain it to a layman.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have to SHUT THE FUCK UP!\" McDoctorate suddenly hammered his palm into his forehead. \"SHUT THE FUCK UP! I can't talk to these idiots while you're filling up our brain with…\" He blinked. \"Thank you.\" He opened his eyes, and looked at them each in turn. They'd stopped walking to stare at him. \"Sorry. He won't leave until we're sure the device works.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" Veiksaar asked.\n\n\"Future me,\" said Placeholder, scratching at several five o'clocks worth of stubble. \"He designed the device, and told me how to IS STILL TELLING ME how to make it EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALREADY MADE.\" He looked, just for a moment, like he wanted to cry. \"It's been a hard month.\"\n\n\"The device //will// work, though,\" Asheworth emphasized. He made eye contact with Sokolsky. \"It will.\"\n\n\"What device?\" Veiksaar asked, almost certain the answer wouldn't clear anything up.\n\nThey'd reached a heavy, old-fashioned looking iron door. Asheworth tapped its mis-matched keycard reader with a key — an actual key, ornate brass filigree — and swung it open to reveal... something.\n\n\"Our baby,\" said Asheworth proudly. \"Th—\"\n\n\"MY baby,\" Placeholder interrupted. He paused, and nodded. \"OUR baby, yes, but not HIS baby.\"\n\nAsheworth sighed yet again, and gestured at the massive piece of jumbled machinery standing before them. It looked like a jet engine from a flying time machine by Doc Brown. \"The Recursive Entity Identity Stability Normalization/Oscillation Cannon.\"\n\nPlaceholder prodded Asheworth in the shoulder. \"That's not what it stands for. At //all.//\"\n\nAsheworth glared at him, and then slowly, deliberately, prodded him back. \"You showed up with the cannon fully-built and an acronym already in hand, you can't give me this one little thing?\"\n\n\"Not if you're going to do //that// with it. Acronyms are the music of the spheres, Asheworth, you can't just bang away at them.\" He drew himself up proudly, and gestured at the device with more flourish than Asheworth had. \"This is the Retrocausally-Engineered Intertemporal Synchronization of Noetic Ordinality Cannon.\"\n\n\"REISNOC,\" said Veiksaar, who had been paying attention.\n\nBoth Asheworth and Placeholder shook their heads. \"REISNO,\" said Asheworth.\n\n\"The REISNO Cannon,\" said Placeholder.\n\nVeiksaar shrugged.\n\n\"Say it fast,\" Placeholder suggested.\n\nShe said it fast. She grimaced.\n\nPlaceholder laughed. \"You were right! She //did// grimace.\" He grimaced too. \"Of course, of //course// you were right, you saw her do it, didn't you? I'm surprised you remembered a grimace all those years later.\" He paused. \"I won't tell her you said that.\"\n\nShe prodded him in the shoulder. \"Explain this thing, please.\"\n\nHe grew visibly excited. \"Oh, it's fantastic. We're really slipping the bounds of surly canon with this one, hence the name.\" He was beaming. \"It lets you be yourselves.\"\n\nVeiksaar nodded. \"As opposed to.\"\n\n\"As opposed to being //yourself.// Yourselves is plural. It lets you be more than one you!\"\n\n\"It syncs your mind with your previous minds,\" Asheworth interjected.\n\n\"However many you need,\" Placeholder agreed. \"You can access the combined knowledge of your entire prior life, if you want!\" He swung his arms in the air theatrically, thwacking a thick bundle of cables off the wall in the process. Asheworth scrambled to reattach them.\n\n\"Why //would// I want?\" Veiksaar shook her head. \"What does past me know that present me doesn't?\"\n\n\"Well, that's not the link I had in mind, really. I was more thinking of passing on information to the past.\" Placeholder was nodding so hard she thought his head might fall off.\n\n\"Doesn't that create a time paradox?\"\n\nNow he was shaking his head with equal vigour. \"No, because it //can't.// You can only use the cannon to contact your past self, //ergo// you can only use the cannon when you //did// use the cannon. To complete the call you already know you must have made.\"\n\nShe considered this insanity for longer than it deserved. \"You're saying... if I remember talking to my future self, I have to make a call on your cannonphone at some point in the future, to... complete the time loop?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And if I //haven't// ever talked to my future self, I //can't// make a call on your cannonphone?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"And what happens if I do? Or if I don't make a call I'm supposed to make?\"\n\n\"Oh, the world ends, probably.\" Placeholder shrugged.\n\nShe stared at him. \"The Earth-world, or the universe-world?\"\n\n\"Seems academic, really,\" said Placeholder. Asheworth rolled his eyes.\n\nShe looked at Sokolsky. \"Wait a minute. Is this... wait a minute.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Say it.\"\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"You've known the password in the past.\"\n\nHe nodded again.\n\n\"You're going to call yourself... in the past... which has already happened... and you're going to access multiple... temporal... versions of the password. At once. That's how you can have more than one copy.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"And your head didn't even explode! Well done.\"\n\nHer head //was// swimming. \"How many versions of yourself are you calling at once?\"\n\n\"Fourteen.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Placeholder. \"That's a terrible—\"\n\n\"Fourteen,\" Sokolsky repeated. \"And it's already happened, remember?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Veiksaar. \"Wait. Wait. //Wait.// Fourteen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sokolsky. \"I'm calling seven former selves immediately, so I can send everyone their first copies before they head on out, and seven more to send them their seconds.\"\n\nVeiksaar felt faint. \"You're doing, oh god. You're doing every one of these operations on the //same fucking day.//\"\n\nPlaceholder rubbed his temples. \"You're going to lose your mind.\"\n\nVeiksaar fought the urge to rub her own temples. \"That, also, has already happened.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe procedure was stunning in its abject simplicity. First, McDoctorate deactivated the cannon. The light in the aperture winked out, the aperture closed, and the omnipresent whirring sound in the jury-rigged operation room mercifully ceased. This appeared to cause him no end of relief; he nearly collapsed, as though a tremendous weight had been lifted from his mind and the suddenly empty space had been replaced with cold air. He rallied magnificently, however, and proceeded swiftly to the second step: sitting Sokolsky down on a simple plastic chair in front of the cannon's aperture, and pressing Asheworth's gloved hands against a pair of electrified touchplates embedded into the wall.\n\n\"We need to give it a jolt every time we make the initial call,\" Asheworth explained. \"I'm going to channel the latent thaumaturgical overflow from the library below the Site — which is going to piss off the Keeper something fierce, by the way — and then I'm going to channel it through myself, into the generators in the walls, and into the Cannon.\"\n\nVeiksaar couldn't hide her cynicism. \"This thing draws a //lot// of power.\"\n\nAsheworth nodded. \"Yep.\"\n\n\"And you're going to pull that much power through your own body, without ill effect?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I'm grounded.\" He pointed at the floor; he was standing on a rubber mat.\n\n\"Wait,\" she said. \"No. No. Rubber doesn't ground you. Rubber //prevents// you from being grounded, which is a //good thing.//\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he agreed, \"but this is magic grounding. It's different.\"\n\n\"His magic is very grounded,\" added Placeholder. He giggled softly.\n\nShe looked at Sokolsky, wide-eyed. Sokolsky smiled at her.\n\nShe sighed, and left the room.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOne hour later, the REISNO Cannon spun down and Sokolsky began to spin up. \"Ho //boy,//\" he said, his eyes completely glazed over. \"This is... okay, but... okay but it's //my turn,// because I'm the //present// me. Yes I know it looks that way to //you,// but... okay, fine, I'm the //future// me. The future //us.// SHUT UP.\" He grinned manically at Veiksaar. \"We're fine.\"\n\nShe escorted him to the comms center on the top sublevel, linking their arms together when he showed every sign of falling over. She didn't try to engage him in conversation; there didn't seem to be much point, since he was perpetually engaged in seven conversations all at once.\n\nHe managed to keep his shit together long enough to deliver each password to each agent; none of them suspected a thing, so far as she could tell, though they were all surprised to learn that he was not presently at Site-43. She'd prepared the comms devices and her noise-cancelling headphones ahead of time (Nhung Ngo would use a similar setup for her pantomime at Site-55) and it didn't take long, or too many technicians, to get everything up and running. The full process still took several hours, since each agent was departing for their targets at a different time to disguise their comings and goings from each other. No-one outside of Site-120 was to know that these operations were all happening simultaneously. Sokolsky obviously didn't want word getting out; if any of his target Groups of Interest happened to be on friendly terms, they might compare notes and realize they were being set up.\n\nWhen all seven passwords were away, Sokolsky slumped down in his chair. She told him he should get some sleep; instead, he stood back up and shakily made his way to the door.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To get the next seven.\"\n\nShe followed him, which was how she barely managed to catch him as he fell. She shoved him back to his feet. \"After ditching your present guests, one hopes.\"\n\n\"Nope! Can't ditch them until they get their passwords back. Gotta do all fourteen Sokolskys at once!\"\n\nShe gawped for a full ten seconds as he stumbled down the corridor before rushing to link arms with him again.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhen Okorie called for her second copy of the password, she sounded cool and confident. \"Everything's going like clockwork.\"\n\n\"That's...\" said Sokolsky.

The first time, it didn't even work; the second time was the charm.\n\n\"Talk slower,\" Veiksaar warned him. \"And get some Gatorade, or something.

It wasn't that the place was big; it was impressive, as manorial collections went, but it wasn't exactly the Bodleian Library. Any amount of truly esoteric knowledge was a lot, however, and the row after row of dark oak bookcases now confronting her was more than more than a lot.\n\nFirst, she disabled the wards on the stacks. Then she grabbed a few tomes she knew from prior visits she'd want and stacked them carefully on the central desk. Then she went hunting, a few keywords rattling around in her head. Books she knew existed, and suspected might be here. Books she knew the Library wanted. Books she knew the Hand wanted. One by one, she made her selections. //Lévi's Tome of Passage. The Ley Almanac. The Book of the Turning Falcon.// There was no reason for her to hurry — nobody capable of bringing down the ward she'd put on the doors would be able to get here before the Way opened, and she was gone — but she was hurrying nevertheless. Her hands were shaking. Her resolve...\n\n//I am not stealing this knowledge.// She hammered the palms of both hands into her forehead. //I am setting it free.// It hardly felt like an accomplishment. Her clearance level had made disabling the Site's thaumaturgic countermeasures a breeze. Her long years of service had made the acceptance of her application to use the password a foregone conclusion. Everyone trusted her, and almost nobody much cared for her; they'd practically fast-tracked her betrayal, and it made her feel... she wasn't sure how it made her feel.\n\nShe grabbed one final tome, glanced at the doors with a longing she couldn't justify, and completed the incantation which would link this library to a far greater one. She waved her hand through the empty space in front of her, and as  the Way materialized in front of her...\n\n...there was a faint fizzling sound from behind her, and she turned to watch the doors swing silently open on well-oiled hinges.\n\nThe books were out of reach. She dropped to a crouch behind the desk, and crept around the corner. Three figures entered the room: Okorie, the unassuming woman who'd brought her the password; Varga, the Site Director; and...\n\n//Fahd.//\n\nShe felt like screaming. It was like a bad joke. She was in the final stage of the greatest heist in the Hand's history, and it was all about to go pear-shaped, and the thing which pained her the most was missing her date to watch //Léon// with Fahd Naaji, the only person she'd become close with in her fifteen years at Site-91. Was it a coincidence, or was this the final test of her resolve?\n\nIt didn't matter. She stood up.\n\n\"Zavia?\" Fahd was the only one who spoke. He was pointing his pistol at her; she saw with yet another pang of guilt that he almost lowered it before a wordless glance from Varga stiffened him back up. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"What does it look like she's doing?\" Varga snapped. \"Take her into custody.\"\n\nMorse pointed at the Way. \"I'm one step away from freedom, and I move faster than he does.\"\n\n\"You're not leaving without the books,\" said Varga. \"//Ergo,// you're not leaving.\"\n\n\"But why?\" The look on Fahd's face was //don't look at his face.// \"I thought we...\"\n\n\"Don't beat yourself up about it,\" Zavia spat, putting in all the venom she could muster, trying to push him away without touching him. \"I'm a better thaumic than anyone in my unit was. You were always out of your league with me.\" She didn't like the way that came out, but she forced herself not to correct it. She inched towards the desk, towards the books. Fahd's pistol was quivering in the air.\n\n\"If you try to cast anything, I'll shoot,\" Fahd half-whispered. \"If you go for the books... I'll shoot.\" She knew he didn't mean it. \"Come quietly, and we can talk this over.\" He was walking towards her, and glancing back over his shoulder; Zavia realized he was keeping tabs on Varga and Okorie, positioning himself between them and the traitor.\n\n//He thinks he can save me. He thinks there's a chance we all leave here together as friends.//\n\n\"Idiot,\" she said. \"Get out of here while you still can.\" She reached out for the nearest set of tomes, and flinched when his first bullet impacted on the surface of the desk.\n\n\"I said,\" he rasped, \"Don't move.\" He was almost upon her now. She didn't know what she was going to do.\n\n\"I can't take you with me,\" she said, so softly that only he could hear her. \"But I have to go.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"You're in control here. You decide how this plays out. You tell me what to do, how you want this to end, and I'll help you.\"\n\nShe looked into his deep, trusting brown eyes, and for a moment, just a moment, she thought about telling him to turn around and put a bullet in his Site Director's leg. Not enough to kill her, but certainly enough to put her out of commission. She glanced past his broad shoulders; Varga was still behind him, but Okorie was creeping around the edge of the room. In a few moments, Zavia would be flanked.\n\nShe reached for the books again, and this time he let her take them. The Way was just a few meters behind her.\n\n\"I have to go,\" she repeated. She blinked away tears. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nHis face hardened. \"I understand,\" he said.\n\nHe turned back towards the doors, and a single shot rang out, and he fell to the floor in a heap.\n\nZavia dropped the books, and fell on top of him. He was bleeding; he'd been shot in the shoulder. She looked up to see Varga standing in the doorway, pistol still smoking. She advanced, and Okorie moved in from the side...\n\n...and Zavia raised both hands in front of her, and put everything she had (and the one-time password) into finishing the emergency barrier she'd never expected to use. The air between her and her pursuers clouded, and they stopped in their tracks. It would only last a moment. Okorie put both hands against it, probing it as if checking for weaknesses.\n\n\"I can't...\" Zavia swallowed. \"I can't send more than one person through the Way. There isn't enough power. It was only meant for me.\"\n\nFahd nodded. \n\nThe aphorisms resurfaced in her mind, one last time. //Knowledge is an act of love. We learn, that we might understand. We understand, that we might protect.//\n\nShe cupped his face in her hand, and nearly wept.\n\nThere wasn't enough time to weep, however. There //was// enough time to haul him to his feet, to ignore his protestations, to turn her back on the woman with the gun and the woman with the Coke-bottle glasses, and shove the only person at Site-91 who still didn't hate her into the open Way. It snapped shut behind him before he struck the polished oaken floor of the Wanderers' Library.\n\nShe still didn't turn around, not even when she heard the barrier drop several seconds too soon. \"They'll take care of him,\" she said. \"They saw what he did, they know he's not one of you anymore.\"\n\n\"Turn around,\" Varga snapped. Zavia turned around. Okorie was already picking the fallen books up off the floor, and examining their spines. The Director had already lowered her pistol.\n\n\"How did you get past the door?\" Zavia asked. \"And the barrier? Even if you knew the password, every thaumaturge in the Site is locked in the barracks right now.\"\n\n\"Every thaumaturge you know about,\" Varga responded.\n\nZavia blinked. She stared at Varga. She stared at... Okorie.\n\n\"Site Directors are a special breed,\" Okorie grinned. \"They always think two steps ahead.\" Almost as an afterthought, she traced a few thin lines in the air and restored the wards on the stacks.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 1 January\n**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120]: Częstochowa, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nAmelia Torosyan called in early for her second copy, or rather Site-77 Director Shirley Gillespie did, which freed Sokolsky's schedule up considerably.

She had detonated a thinking, //literally// thinking bomb by quoting poetry at it. She had melted a magical sword by temporarily converting to Zoroastrianism. She had killed a demon by forcing it to eat communion wafers. The Global Occult Coalition had considered her one of its most flexible, creative, effective agents.\n\nShe had, however, never destroyed a festering, cancerous wound on a national psyche by sitting in an office and waiting for an internet connection to dial in. It was an appropriately absurd capstone on a thoroughly chequered career.\n\n\"You're sure this will be enough?\" the man in the immaculate grey and white suit demanded for the third time. He was sweating, even in the climate-controlled office he'd borrowed from the state governor for this special occasion; the Minister of Home Affairs had weathered security challenges before, of course, but this was something entirely outside of his experience. Misra almost expected his glasses to fog up.\n\n\"It will take them at least ten more minutes to reboot the system,\" she said. She kept her hands folded neatly in her lap, and maintained confident eye contact. \"You'll have your data in five, enough to bury them ten times over.\"\n\nAmit Shah frowned. \"You're willingly implicating yourself, if what you say is true. If they're really doing what you say they're doing.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I'll be gone before you make your report, and you'll never find me.\" She'd done it before. She hoped she was about to do it for the final time.\n\nShah looked down at the laptop computer she'd supplied. She knew there was nothing so cinematic as a progress bar, just a constantly refreshing connection-seeking dialogue. The Foundation had such tight cybersecurity that India's best experts had never managed to crack it; five minutes wasn't a long time to wait, considering the miracles Misra's hacked subroutines were about to manage.\n\nThe screen died — she saw it in his glasses — and Shah nearly jumped. \"What in...\"\n\nThe screen flashed back on, and a familiar prompt appeared on the screen. //Someone's calling.// Even in miniature, even in reverse, she could see who it was. As her world fell apart, she watched Shah decide whether he really wanted to talk to Azad Banerjee, Director of Site-36...\n\n...before the call went through anyway.\n\n\"Minister Shah, good afternoon. Are you alone?\"\n\nShah nodded, keeping his eyes on the screen. \"Of course. What's this regarding?\"\n\n\"We've had an attempted security breach. A rogue GOC agent is attempting to access our network from off-Site; she powered down our systems and rebooted them with administrator privileges.\"\n\nShah was really sweating, now. \"Your lights appear to be on, Director.\"\n\nBanerjee nodded. \"We have alternate sources of power.\"\n\nMisra suddenly realized why he seemed out of breath. //The Everhart Generator.// There was enough energy in that thing to power the Site's non-thaumaturgic systems ten times over, and he was an accomplished technician. //Oh, Azad, if only you'd developed your heart while you were developing your brain.//\n\nA second voice, the voice of the agent who'd inadvertently supplied the password to Misra, chimed in. She, too, sounded out of breath, and there was a loud roar behind her. \"She also toasted the Site's interface and comms network, but luckily I kept my security team off the grid. It was a simple matter to remote-call the hacked network, feed in the password and disable the transmission.\"\n\nShah swallowed. \"Transmission?\"\n\nMisra's head was spinning. //How do you have the password? __I__ have the password.//\n\n\"Yeah, the rogue agent was trying to send you our files. Probably thinks there's something incriminating in there, though who knows what that might be.\"\n\nAs Misra edged towards the door — Shah was no danger to her, but she hoped to make a neat exit — three loud raps from the other side nearly stopped her heart.\n\nShah looked at her. He looked back at the screen. He sighed. \"Your team,\" he said. \"I'm assuming you're mobile?\"\n\nThe door opened, and Delfina Ibanez strolled in. \"Helicopter!\" she declared, all smiles. \"Going somewhere, Nita?\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 1 January\n**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120]: Częstochowa, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n\"Is there any chance of this causing permanent damage?\"\n\nPlaceholder shrugged. \"Absolutely.

Wettle had gotten his moment in the spotlight, and now he was in the big leagues.

When Kuroki input the password and deactivated the game, and the façade fell away, they found each agent, researcher and administrator milling in the halls and offices and crawlspaces, addled and bemused. Most of all they were piled at the bottom of the elevator, none the worse for wear. There didn't seem to have been a single fatality, and the Site psychologists expected a complete recovery in every single case. Nobody remembered the events of the past few days, which McInnis and Kuroki assured them was a good thing.\n\nWhether Shinoda himself would remember, well, they might never know the answer to that. The IJAMEA agent was found in the comms centre, prone on the floor, dressed only in a simple Foundation detainee jumpsuit. Just as his prisoner profile indicated, he was comatose.\n\n\"Project //Kotodama// let him walk again,\" Kuroki marvelled. \"It let him shape the world in his image. We took that away from him, and we took //everything// away from him.\"\n\n\"Not everything.\" McInnis smiled. \"Daniel Dunn is still a Person of Interest. I'm sure you'll catch him some day.\"\n\nKuroki shook his head. \"Not me. I'm transferring out of here. Today, if possible.\"\n\nMcInnis arched an eyebrow. \"Why? And to where?\"\n\n\"Because I have something to tell you,\" said Kuroki. \"About your Site, which is the answer to the second question.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image WWS.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 1 January\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub Clackamas County]: Oregon, United States of America**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nIt felt good to be back. The Shelter needed her. She'd secured a few vital concessions by playing along at Site-55; the Foundation would lighten some of the financial load, she'd been promised an able-bodied and strong-willed new employee, and she'd probably secured a permanent ally in the person of Justine Everwood. But Faeowynn Wilson belonged at Wilson's Wildlife, and she felt like the homecoming queen as she chewed up the asphalt between the airport and the City of Boring.\n\nShe checked her mirrors and watched the road carefully, so it certainly wasn't her fault that she didn't notice the tiny red lights on the side of the road, or in the sky above her, or behind the tinted windshields of her fellow motorists, how they tracked her every movement, how they followed her all the way to the gates of WWS, and beyond.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 1 January\n**[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120]: Częstochowa, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nSokolsky told Veiksaar that he needed to stay at 120 until he had all the passwords back in their proper times; if he tried to de-sync without them, all of reality would be destroyed, yada yada yada. He sent her on ahead, and promised to meet her back at 43. She clearly didn't see the point in leaving without him, but he did a little song and dance with the voices he was pretending to hear in his head, and that was enough to drive her up the ramp.\n\n\"Do you think it fooled her?\" Asheworth asked, as they watched the jet take off.\n\n\"Nope,\" said Sokolsky. He yawned. \"So that part of the plan is working.\"\n\n\"Do you think the tablet part of the plan fooled her, at least? I really resent your painting me as some sort of technological incompetent, by the way.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Placeholder, \"you're more of a social incompetent.\"\n\n\"What does that even mean?\"\n\n\"I think she fell for the tablet part, yes.\" Sokolsky smiled. \"And she'll write down the REISNO Cannon cover story in her report to O5, which will form the official record. That's all I needed from you gentlemen, so, well done.\"\n\n\"I //hate// how you mischaracterized the Cannon,\" Placeholder sighed. \"You'd never be able to sync up with fourteen selves at once. Never mind the threat to reality, your brain would simply implode.\"\n\n\"Well, we're lucky the Cannon's not real, then,\" Asheworth grinned.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Placeholder. \"It's real. It works.\"\n\nThey both stared at him.\n\n\"What? My future self explained the whole thing to me, just like I said. If we actually plug it in, and feed it enough thaumic current, it'll do [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5956 precisely what it's meant to].\"\n\nThey were still staring at him.\n\n\"//What?// There's a fine line between sounding plausible and //being// plausible, so why would I stop just short of brilliance? Besides, I never lie about science.\" He cocked his head to one side. \"Oh, and the world would've ended if I didn't make the thing, because, you know, time paradox.\"\n\nThey were still staring at him, so he decided to change the subject. \"Where //did// you get fourteen copies of that password, anyway?\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image 120A.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nVeiksaar waited until the jet was in the air before taking out her tablet and reading the email message she'd secretly snagged from Asheworth.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Daniel Asheworth, Site-120; Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate, Site-87; Dr. Daniil Sokolsky, Site-43; Dr. Dan, Area-09\n**From:** O5 Command\n**Date:** 12/26/2020\n**Subject:** Re: Project PASSOVER\n[[/div]]\n----\nEnact the cover story on 1 January 2021, as discussed.
