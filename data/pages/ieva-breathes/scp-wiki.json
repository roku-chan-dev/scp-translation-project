When you mention mountains she builds a mound of bodies. I can see the beauty in death, but she sees neither. She desires neither — she only kills. The Path of Strength cannot be rid of her. She will not leave. She cannot leave, chained to the will of the six. Death has banished her, and so...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//Stars fall. They must.//\n//I am no star. I am the star's guiding servant.//\n//Forgive me, Orok, but I must feed that which must die.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Aye, I remember Layla. Terrifying employer. Got crippled on me first day 'cause of the bloody bitch. Me tootsies are gone, see? Did it to all of us. She does it personally. Gave us all these weird slithers and nobs instead. Said it made us stronger, united us in our weakness. Always thought it was a load of horseshit. Only thing she united us in was hating her scaly ass. Was glad when you suits arrested us, honestly. Yeah, nah, keep an eye open. She'll be back. First thing we learned under her. Don't matter what color your science boys make your fire...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//I remember a river of blood. My blood.//\n//[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-say-this-that-you-suffer Subandhu robbed me of that river.]//\n//I was a fool of a girl. I believed that I would save women like myself.//\n//I believed I was different.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"We know of the Subversion. We remember her. Our bane. We fight empires. We fight that which can be toppled. She cannot. She will not allow it. She believes in power. She has turned that belief into reality. We fight that which cares for their siblings. We fight that which cares for its citizens. She is neither. She is a plague. Our apologies, seeker. We cannot accept an impossible task. We cannot succeed so long as...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//They curse me. I feel it.//\n//Please, curse me. Show me what I have become.//\n//Prove to me that my path is wrong.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"So many teeth. So many limbs. So many whispers. You call that thing a \"she?\" It's as much of a woman as my cock's the Freedom Tower. That thing has no mind of its own anymore. It devours, it wants more to add to itself. Fucking tentacle head-ass, fucking... toe freak. Why the fuck does it have to be toes? How the fuck do I explain to my therapist that some wizard came back from the dead and tried to cut off my feet? You want me to calm down? I'll calm the fuck down when I'm sure I'll never again hear the words...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//One by one they fall. A star that burns brightly dies first.//\n//I have not forgotten your dream, Ozi̮rmok.//\n//Kill so that they may be sated. I fatten the beast so that it may slaughter itself.//\n//Glut for glut.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"The Scourge returns. She walks, she harvests. Her //halkost// marches, stirring up nightmares long thought sealed. Every time we set her back, she returns, faster. We need to reevaluate how we approach her, sir. She is no witless beast; like us, she learns. Your Foundation is clever, but you treat her like she is an item. She is a wave. Bound by laws we don't understand, she must return. We were wrong, I'm afraid. I'm not quite sure she can even die, unless you can explain how despite everything...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//He despises me. I know it. All of them do.//\n//Let them. It will serve them well when the time comes.//\n//The road of nettles lies before us.//\n//Vengeance, not forgiveness. Conquest, not love.//\n//You taught me power. I will teach you hate.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Whore of the gods. Mother-merchant of pride. You ask of her? Your security is too lax to be seeking such knowledge, gentlemen. Even the strong have ears. What mewling peasant irates their mother?  How do you barter with a goddess that executes even the customs of her people? Call off your investigation and return to your bottles. She may have many bodies to go through, but she will succeed so long as...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n{{//I wished to snuff out the stars. I cavort with that which I wish to kill.//\n//They say I am a perversion of his ideals.//\n//Build your nations. When you mold the first brick from the dead clay,//\n//When you no longer dread the shepherds, use my blood.//\n//Let my spilt blood be the glue that allowed civilization to continue.//\n//I ask for nothing more.//}}\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\"...[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/mother-who-demands-ones-toes Ieva] breathes.\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
