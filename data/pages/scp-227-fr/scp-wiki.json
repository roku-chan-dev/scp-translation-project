Given the lengthy onset time of the anomaly's effects on test subjects (four weeks before attaining critical synchronization, followed by an indefinite period of continued testing as per Protocol 227-T), D-Class used in tests are exempt from monthly termination. A stock of ancient one (1) franc coins must be available to researchers during testing.\n\n\n**Description :** SCP-227-FR designates a machine similar in appearance to a modified photo booth of the brand Photomaton, measuring 3.10 x 2.20 x 0.50 m and painted in black and navy blue.\n\nIts front is equipped with two slots : a slot for one franc coins permitting a \"horoscope séance\" and a slot on a small receptacle which dispenses a paper containing a written message at the end of the séance. \n\nSCP-227-FR is topped with a panel designating it a \"HOROSCO-MATON\" (sic) and a poster on which is written:\n\n[[=]]\n> [[size 110%]] **What future do THE STARS promise you?** [[/size]]\n> Unlucky in love ? Dreams of promotion ? Discover what the future has in store for you today thanks to the revolutionary Horoscomaton® !\n> [[size 80%]] Because apparently your destiny is dictated by balls of hydrogen in fusion thousands of light years from you, so why not let a machine extrapolate all this to give you even more rules for how you should live your life? [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\nThe inside of SCP-227-FR is painted white and equipped with a halogen light bulb in the roof, a white adjustable stool, a black velvet curtain at the entry and a cathode screen inset in the wall across from the stool.\n\nIt should also be noted that, despite being equipped with an electrical plug, SCP-227-FR does not seem to require being plugged-in in order to function.\n\nWhen any person (hereafter designated \"subject\") sits within the chamber after having inserted a one (1) franc coin, the screen will turn itself on and display a message asking the subject to place their hand on the screen and count to five, so that the machine can establish a \"palmistry appraisal\" which supposedly allows SCP-227-FR to obtain information utilized in its calculations[[footnote]] It has as of yet not been determined if the machine performs calculations in the traditional sense. Truthfully, we know nothing of its function, nor where it gets its information. [[/footnote]].\n\nOnce the subject has complied, the screen will briefly display a loading screen before showing a file containing multiple instances of specific information concerning the subject. This information is always rigorously exact and includes:\n\n* The date and time of the birth of the subject.\n* The geographic coordinates of the place of birth of the subject.\n* Their astrological sign.\n* Their rising sign.\n* Their dominant hand (left-handed, right-handed or ambidextrous).\n* A secret (too insignificant to be exploited by the Foundation).\n\nFollowing this, the screen will prompt the subject to orally confirm the information displayed by saying \"YES\" or \"NO\". The response seems to always be taken into consideration, despite the absence of a receiver within the booth. Once the subject has confirmed the displayed information, the screen will direct the subject towards the exterior receptacle where a strip of paper with the written prediction will be output.[[footnote]] Given that the information displayed is always correct, answering \"NO\" purposely will cause SCP-227-FR to instantly shut off. [[/footnote]]. Once the subject exits, the screen will turn itself off and a strip of paper will output.\n\nThe first strip of paper produced will display vague and common information relating to the subject's past. The subject will express disappointment, indifference or anger and will, in every case, experience a sensation of intense displeasure, believing themself to have fallen victim to a prank. Over the course of the week following the subject's interaction with SCP-227-FR, the subject will feel an increasing desire to reuse the booth, under the pretext of verifying if the machine is in working order or if the result remains the same. This marks the habit forming phase.\n\nThe habit forming phase lasts about twenty-five days. Each time the subject returns to use SCP-227-FR, the information output will be increasingly precise and relate to the increasingly recent past.\n\nThe habit forming phase will finish with the \"critical synchronization\" moment during which the machine will no no longer predict the past but instead the present.Critical synchronization  will occur between the twenty-first and twenty-eighth days. The output message is invariably:\n\n[[=]]\n> You are currently reading this paper.\n[[/=]]\n\nFollowing critical synchronization, the subject's addiction to SCP-227-FR is considered incurable, and the subject will have a pathological need to try SCP-227-FR at least once per day[[footnote]]if the subject is unable to regularly reach the cabinet, they will experience symptoms ranging from nausea or anxiety attacks to seizures or becoming comatose.[[/footnote]]. This signifies the beginning of the anticipation phase.\n\nOnce the critical prediction has passed, SCP-227-FR will begin to generate legitimate predictions concerning the future of the subject. This begins with extremely specific predictions concerning the near future, in the following hours, before increasingly moving towards more general predictions concerning the increasingly distant future.\n\nThese predictions are consistently accurate. Unfortunately, the predictions concern the D-Class subjects, too useless and too vague, displaying no information relevant to the Foundation.\n\nProblems caused by the onset addiction prevents any usage of SCP-227-FR by researcher or security personnel. Any personnel found attempting to make use of the anomaly will be amnesticized. \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Level 2/277 Access Required\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n**Item # :** SCP-227-FR\n\n**Object Class :** Euclid\n\n**Threat Level:** --Yellow [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]●[[/span]]-- Orange [[span style=\"color:orange\"]]●[[/span]]\n\n**Updated Containment Procedures :** All D-Class test subjects must be executed upon conclusion of the testing period. D-Class in the advanced transformation phase must be placed in separate cells. A medical team composed of morphology specialists and a psychologist must inspect the subjects after each séance. Security personnel must be reinforced by at least six additional personnel so as to avoid attacks or escape attempts by subjects.\n\n**Anticipation phase :** The anticipation phase of SCP-227-FR does not predict the future of subjects. Rather, it dictates their future and subjects follow these predictions. Predictions will increasingly define the actions of subjects around a pre-established behavioral model which the subject will progressively adopt. The longer a subject is exposed to SCP-227-FR the more extreme this behavior will become, and the subject's mental health will irreversibly degrade.  \n\n\nAfter ten to fifteen days in the anticipation phase, these effects will be followed by physical transformations, discreet at first, but but which become further pronounced and dangerous to the subject's morphology after this time. When these physical and mental modifications begin, the subject becomes an instance of SCP-227-FR-2\n\n\nExerts of test logs are available below for a more precise illustration of the effects of SCP-227-FR. The logs in their entirety are available at the Department of Archives. \n\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 25 :**\n> **Subject :** D-8992\n> **Date of birth** 18/08/1976\n> \n> Séance 26 : Critical synchronization occurred yesterday. Subject is in good shape. SCP-227-FR has predicted he will stub his big toe against the wall while exiting the room, prediction confirmed.\n> \n> Séance 28 : D-8992, habitually imprisoned, begins showing increased empathy. SCP-227-FR has predicted that he will \"be more sociable this week without having to leave home\" \n> \n> Séance 35 : D-8992 is presently largely extroverted. Two guards have been reassigned as they were becoming too attached and lost their objectivity.\n> \n> Séance 40 :Female personnel are temporarily disallowed, at least concerning D-8992. You'd think he's at home here, and that we are his guests. A strict diminishing of communications between the subject and researcher personnel. Abnormal augmentation of body hair growth in the subject. D-8992 has presently become an instance of SCP-227-FR-2\n> \n> Séance 54 : SCP-227-FR-2 has become increasingly aggressive towards personnel. Very prideful. Subject's diet now composed entirely of meat. Length of claws : 2.6 cm. Spine deformed, strength and agility greatly increased. Request that SCP-227-FR-2 be gagged to prevent speaking. Extreme influence over all personnel, myself included. \n> \n> Séance 56 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 38 :**\n> **Subjet :** D-2256\n> **Date of Birth :** 24/10/1972\n> \n> Séance 24 : Critical synchronization accomplished yesterday. D-2256's addiction seems particularly pronounced. SCP-227-FR predicts that the subject would \"anger himself with someone better armed than he\". Fatally, D-2256 began hostilities with a guard. Medical aid was correctly administered.\n> \n> Séance 29 : SCP-227-FR has told D-2256 to \"beware malevolent persons of his entourage that will seek to use him\". This has considerably increased the subject's paranoia, who was already psychologically unstable.\n> \n> Séance 36 : D-2256 is increasingly agitated, aggressive and impulsive. Modification of his dermis has rendered his skin particularly dry. I request that he be immediately classified as an instance of SCP-227-FR-2.\n> \n> Séance 39 : The body of SCP-227-FR-2 is currently partially covered by brown scales. Tissue samples sent to lab for analysis. Extremities seem to retract within themselves. SCP-227-FR-2 instance difficult to control. His aggressiveness and his excitement largely compensate for his clumsiness. \n> \n> Séance 45 : SCP-227-FR-2 grievously injured two guards since beginning testing. Noting a start of fusion of his metacarpals and an abnormal deformation in the pelvic region. An abnormal toxic substance has also been revealed in his cells. Analyses are in progress. Testing has been temporarily delayed.\n> \n> Séance 47 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n**Test Journal n^^o^^ 44 :**\n> **Subjet :** D-6317\n> **Date of Birth :** 12/09/1981\n> \n> Séance 21 : Critical synchronization accomplished yesterday. SCP-227-FR predicted that D-6317 will drop his glass during lunch. Prediction verified, gesture doubtless unconscious and influenced by message.\n> \n> Séance 29 : SCP-227-FR predicted that \"your critiques will aid others to improve\". It seems that D-6317 feels obligated to follow this indication and constantly critique each of our acts over the course of testing.\n> \n> Séance 34 : D-6317 is increasingly calm, and seems constantly concentrated, absent. This makes things easier. No physical changes apparent for the moment. Slow onset of OCD, it seems, without counting his criticisms which, if they continue, at least have the upside of being calm.\n> \n> Séance 40 : It seems that D-6317 is tempted to attempt escape tonight. Well, to tell the truth, he //did// escape. Video logs indicate shockingly accurate timing and precision, combined with a memory and observation sense much higher than average, as shown in testing. Whatever the case: addiction has pushed D-6317 to return less than 5 hours later. Caution recommended. A physical exam has proved that certain scars of D-6317, under the chin and on the right thigh, have vanished. Instance classified as SCP-227-FR-2\n> \n> Séance 46 : SCP-227-FR-2 has indicated urinary problems, lab tests in progress. Outside of this, he is strangely silent and seems less sensitive to external stimuli. His visual acuity seems to have greatly ameliorated. His OCD has pushed him to remark on a stain upon the floor of Test Chamber 29-B //at the other end of the hall.// \n> \n> Séance 49 : General atrophy of SCP-227-FR-2's genitals. Does not seem to be in pain. All traces of physical sequelae seem to have vanished. Tests show that inflicted injuries heal within the following hour.\n> \n> Séance 50 : [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-227-FR-2 instance terminated.\n\n**Incident 227-01 :** ██/██/19██, Seeing as how scans of the mechanism within the cabinet have given no results, if has been decided to present SCP-227-FR to the Department of Engineering and Technical Services (DE&TS) so as to disassemble the machine and learn more about its internal function. While Chief Engineer Girouard began to unscrew the rear panel of the machine, an asteroid of 2 cm in diameter ( size calculated post-impact) broke through the roof of Containment Hangar-03 and [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\nFollowing this, SCP-227-FR produced a different message from its regular predictions.\nThe message read:\n\n> Be reasonable. Stars, future and death are all one. Penetrating the secret would only ruin the magic. Quit your naivety and take your destiny for what it is. Inevitable. Leave the cabinet to the fools.\n\nAll research into the internal mechanisms of SCP-227-FR have been suspended by order of the Site Director. \n\n> **Notice from the Site Director:** This incident proves that, contrary to what numerous researchers have thought, the sphere of influence of SCP-227-FR //far// exceeds the minds of the test subjects that use it. If we add this \"astronomical\" incident to the fourteen agents injured by SCP-227-FR-2 instances, I believe that SCP-227-FR represents a menace far greater than we thought. I'm ordering an increase in its threat level, as well as a stop to all tests for an indefinite period of time. Kybian is not equipped to deal with these fucking hybrids, and even less to stop the sky from falling on us!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-226-FR]]] | SCP-227-FR | [[[SCP-228-FR]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
