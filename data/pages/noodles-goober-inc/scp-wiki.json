So, this page is meant to act as an ever expanding catalogue for you to find and [[size 2%]] --upvote-- [[/size]] read your goober of choice. \n\n[[size 150%]] **That's it, that's the purpose of this page. If you don't like it or the theme, sue me.** [[/size]]\n\n[[size 30%]] do not actually sue me, I am too broke to handle the attorney fees. [[/size]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ \"Goober List\"\n\n//These are the SCP articles that I'd consider containing at minimum one, (if not multiple!) goobers.//\n\n\n\n\n\n[[[SCP-8185]]]: **Raccaccoonie** - The one that started them all. It's odd to look back at this article knowing I didn't want Frank to actually talk, which caused me to rip my hair out for quite some time. So I gave him a silly accent and made him act tough and all my problems were solved. A story about finding family and friends in the most unlikely of places, which drive us all to pursue the best version of ourselves.\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-8385]]]: **AirDodo** - Based on [[*User Mister_toasty]]'s July Writing Prompt. Originally inspired by my thoughts of budget airlines' potential struggles to pay out EU-Compensations. This article quickly spiraled into my issues and complaints with customer service I've gotten from airlines, alongside a healthy sprinkle of stupidity and absurdity. Craig wrote himself.\n\n------\n\n**Piss Off** - I was taking the piss. Rest in Piss my beloved…\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-8485]]]: **Noise Complaint** - Wanted to try my hand at something that one could maybe consider horror, fridge horror or whatever, and if I am going to be the goober guy, I may as well kill my goobers sometimes… thought about the idea of the Foundation just neglecting to take care of an incessantly annoying (but scared) creature.\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-8785]]]: **(IN)EDIBLE HELLFIRE FOR TRUE CHALLENGERS** - I had a weird experience with suddenly not being able to handle my spice with some million scoville hot sauce challenge bullshit when celebrating a birthday with my friends. Thereafter, I've always gotten shit for it. So, this is that experience, just hammed up a ton. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ Other SCP Articles\n\n//These are the SCP articles that people tell me to delete, because I am horrible at writing anything that doesn't involve whimsy, goofy or silly. But check them out and pretend they were written by another author, maybe you'll enjoy them then!// - A guy certainly not upset about being pigeonholed as the \"**goober guy**\".\n\n[[[SCP-8285]]]: **Strike Him Down** - I wanted to write an article where the Foundation is essentially an unreliable narrator, leading to the question of whether or not the guy was ever anomalous to begin with. Based on the extensive damage a false report [[size 80%]] --(amogus)-- [[/size]] can have.\n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-8685]]]: **Sign Today To Have Your Grandpa's Organs Harvested!** - A short skip raising the question about organ donation post-death. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n++++ Tales (It's year of the tale, right guys???)\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[[i'm sorry]]] - A piece about my personal struggles with aphantasia, and the temporality of everything and how that clashes with the loss of my grandmother.\n\n------\n\n[[[A Clean Slate]]] - What if someone brought their family to an SCP-Site? A piece dealing with mixing career and family.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ Fan Art\n\n[[image Fan_Art_1.jpg size=\"square\"]] - By [[*User WinkWonkBoi]]: Portrait of me\n\n------\n\n[[image Fan_art_2.jpg size=\"small\"]] - By [[*User ProblemPal]]: It is certainly something. Self-titled \"magnum opus\".\n\n------\n\n[[image Rolf.png size=\"small\"]] - By [[*User Gelbsucht_IE]]: Awesome portrait of SCP-8285! Check out their Sciptember Art Page: https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:gelb-s-very-cool-sciptember-art\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n++ Author Will\n\nIf anything were to ever happen to me and I disappear (for at least 5 years with absolutely no explanation, notice or whatever), I propose there to be a \"goober-off\". All authors may submit a gooby article under 3k words (if I ever write an article over 3k words, it was not me and I was hacked.). Whoever gets the most upvotes within 24 hours is declared the winner and receives custodianship over my work. This entitles them to make minor edits, as long as they'd fit the style of the article and are genuinely gooby and silly. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n**Filename:** Fan_art_1.jpg\n**Author:** [[*User WinkWonkBoi]]\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n------\n\n**Filename:** Fan_art_2.jpg\n**Author:** [[*User ProblemPal]]\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n------\n\n**Filename:** Rolf.png\n**Author:** [[*User Gelbsucht_IE]]\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
