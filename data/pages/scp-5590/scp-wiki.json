Changes in SCP-5590's behavior and damage to SCP-5590's containment cell are to be reported to SCP-5590's Head Researcher before any actions are to be taken.\n\nAs per the request of Head Researcher Arelli, SCP-5590's cell must contain 1 modified Rubik's cube at all times.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5590 is a 15cm tall sentient humanoid robot. SCP-5590 will attempt, to the best of its ability, to be as much of a non-violent nuisance as possible. This may entail the following:\n* Removing or switching labels on items.\n* Minor to moderate damage to structures. This damage is not severe enough to put structural integrity at risk.\n* Moderate to severe damage to objects. This may cause objects to break when used.\n* Providing excessive sensory stimulation to personnel around SCP-5590. This often includes producing loud and constant noises or reflecting light into the eyes of personnel, but may involve touch, taste, smell, or a combination of senses.\nSCP-5590's arms can retract into its body and reappear as an appendage with a variety of tools at the end instead of a hand. Tools that have been observed at the end of SCP-5590's appendages include: a circular saw, a drill, a nozzle full of glue, and a lighter.\n\n**Incident Log 5590-1:** SCP-5590 cut a small piece of debris from the wall of its cell. SCP-5590 repeatedly threw this debris at a camera that was monitoring it, cracking the lens. The camera lens was replaced and the debris was removed from the cell. 6 hours later, SCP-5590 used another piece of debris to crack the camera lens again.\n> **Note from Head Researcher Arelli:** Leave it. We can still see SCP-5590 through the cracked lens, and it isn’t worth constantly replacing.\n\n[[div class=\"testseries noword\"]]\n**Test Series 1:** Object Familiarity & Recognition\n**Purpose:** Determine SCP-5590's intelligence.\n[[table class=\"testlogs\"]]\n[[row]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nPROTOCOL\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nRESULT\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nA wooden chair was placed in SCP-5590’s containment cell.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-5590 used its circular saw appendage to shorten one of the chair’s legs by 1.5 cm, causing it to rock.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\n[[=]]\nN/A\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe wooden chair from the previous test was removed from SCP-5590's containment cell.

Head Researcher Arelli was repeatedly unable to calm SCP-5590. After 23 minutes, Researcher Coleman successfully calmed SCP-5590. Neither researcher was able to identify a cause for SCP-5590's distress.\n\n**Incident Log 5590-3:** On 3/18/1986, SCP-5590 began using its circular saw appendage to make small cuts into the floor and walls of its cell. This creates a constant high-pitched cutting noise that persists throughout the day.\n>  **Note From Head Researcher Arelli:** We can't stop the noise. I talked to a couple of the technicians, and the system the cameras run on don't allow volume control for the individual camera feeds. Our only option is to have sound coming in from all of the feeds or none. The Site Directors won't allow me to turn it off for all of them because some of the SCPs on other camera feeds need to be listened to.\n>\n> \n> I've decided to change the risk class from \"Notice\" to \"Caution\" before the thing gives me tinnitus.\n\n[[div class=\"testseries noword\"]]\n**Test Series 2:** Hobbies\n**Purpose:** Determine if occupying SCP-5590 with a task prevents it from damaging its containment cell.\n[[table class=\"testlogs\"]]\n[[row]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nPROTOCOL\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nRESULT\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nHead Researcher Arelli lightly tossed a ping-pong ball towards SCP-5590.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-5590 caught the ball and used its lighter appendage to ignite the ball.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nHead Researcher Arelli extinguished the fire.

It should be noted, however, that SCP-5590 will blatantly lie about not hating Head Researcher Arelli whenever possible.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Incident Log 5590-4:** Using its circular saw appendage, SCP-5590 removed a piece of concrete from the wall of its containment cell. SCP-5590 threw the piece of concrete at the camera, shattering the lens and making remote footage of SCP-5590's cell impossible. When staff arrived to replace the lens, they found that SCP-5590 had dug a small tunnel in the Southern wall of its cell[[footnote]]The appendage used for this is unknown, but is presumed to be a drill.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5590 was found standing inside the tunnel, which was only 30 cm deep and did not lead anywhere. When found, SCP-5590 waved at staff and exited the tunnel cooperatively.\n\n**Addendum 5590-2:** SCP-5590 has been moved to a new small entity containment cell. This cell is similar to SCP-5590's previous cell, the exception being that the camera monitoring SCP-5590 is now behind a plexiglass window, preventing SCP-5590 from damaging it.\n> **Note:** Site Director Hoff has reminded Head Researcher Arelli that SCP-5590's containment has been significantly more expensive than initially expected. This was said despite not being Arelli's fault that he was assigned a robot that has dedicated itself to making everything frustrating.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"INPUT CREDENTIALS FOR HEAD RESEARCHER ARELLI\"hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Omer.Arelli@scip.net\n**From:** Richard.Hoff@scip.net\n**Subject:** Re: request for transfer\n[[/div]]\n-----\nAfter reviewing your request for transfer and all documentation on SCP-5590, your request for transfer has been denied. Keep in mind that staff may only be transferred if one or more of the following conditions are met:\n* [[[SCP-5171|Personal affiliation]]] with the SCP that would [[[l-appel-du-vide|influence one's work]]].\n* Risk of harm to oneself that is more severe and/or prevalent than for other staff members in one's position.\n* Injury (physical, psychological, etc.) which severely limits one's ability to work.\n* Perpetrating, being the victim of, or being affiliated with a severe disciplinary infraction (see \"Coworkers: The Thaumiels Around Us\").\nYour claim that SCP-5590 attempting to elicit a negative emotional reaction from you (please refrain from using crude language in emails to faculty) does not appear to hinder your ability to work in such a way that would necessitate a transfer.\n\nBefore I was a site director, I was the head researcher for a few SCPs. For that reason, I'd like to leave you with the following advice: being a head researcher is hard. Due to their positions and duties (extensively monitoring their SCP, conducting or supervising tests involving their SCP, etc.) head researchers tend to become much more familiar with their SCPs than other staff members. For that reason, head researchers may feel that the SCP they were assigned to has some personal connection to them. Head researchers may see an SCP as being much more sentient, cognizant, or mentally capable of liking and disliking certain people than they actually are. SCP-5590 doesn't lie about hating you. Chances are it doesn't even know who you are. Your belief that the SCP you were assigned to dislikes you is common amongst new head researchers, and I would hate to see you throw in the towel because you fell victim to such a common misconception.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"testseries noword\"]]\n**Test Series 5:** Stop Making Noise\n**Purpose:**\n**Foreword:** Arelli did all of these tests.\n[[table class=\"testlogs\"]]\n[[row]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nPROTOCOL\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nRESULT\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-5590's arms were tied to its body.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-5590 pressed its body up against the wall of its cell, allowing it to cut into the wall using its circular saw appendage.\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\n[[=]]\nN/A\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-5590's arms were tied to its body.
