Any changes in the condition of SCP-5099 are to be immediately reported to Site Director, Dr. Katelyn Morgenthau.\n\nResearch staff assigned to Site-24 are to have a minimum CRV[[footnote]]Cognitohazardous Resistance Value.[[/footnote]] of 100 so as to mitigate the anomalous effects of SCP-5099-1. \n\nResearch staff at Site-24 are to be regularly tested for cognitohazardous imagery which is caused as a byproduct of SCP-5099-1's anomalous effects. Cognitohazardous imagery related to SCP-5099-1's anomalous effects include the following: Seeing hand-prints (of various sizes) on surfaces, nightmares involving apocalyptic imagery, mass paranoia and suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe primary objective of Site-24 is to ascertain a valid way of neutralising SCP-5099-1.\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Description**__\n[[/div]]\n SCP-5099 is the designation given to a 112.5m double-helical object resembling a lance of unknown origin found buried inside of the Patomskiy Crater. Current estimations place the age of the object as 5 billion years old, whilst its arrival on Earth is dated to approximated 3.5 billion years ago.\n\nThe majority of the object remains buried underneath the surface of Site-24. Current excavation efforts have uncovered 63m of the object. Excavation has been halted and an exclusion zone has been constructed surrounding SCP-5099-1.\n\nThe object is composed of a black metallic substance of ##blue|terrestrial## origin constructed into a double-helical shape that winds closer together as it narrows. At the end that is lodged into ##blue|SCP-5099-1##, the two strands are unwound to form two long tines measuring 10m in length each. The object is approximately 10m wide and progressively narrows as it reaches the head of the object.\n\nSeveral fragments were uncovered by staff at Site-24 prior to Incident 5099 which had broken away from the main body of SCP-5099. ##blue|It is now understood that this is due to the natural degradation of SCP-5099, which by 20██ will have fully collapsed and will no longer be a viable method of containing SCP-5099-1.##\n\nSCP-5099-1 is the designation given to an immense reality bending entity of unknown size with a Hume rating far in excess of 300. It is currently located directly underneath Site-24 with SCP-5099-1 impaled directly into the entity.\n\nThe capabilities of SCP-5099-1 are not understood but indications from Incident 5099 as well as historical evidence inscribed into SCP-5099 suggest that it is capable of wide-ranging manipulation of local space typically taking the form of gigantic hand prints removing localised space. It is also capable of projecting anomalous cognitohazards into the brains of susceptible human subjects.\n\nThese cognitohazards are capable of subjugating the subject into working towards excavating SCP-5099 and removing the object from the entity. In addition, the entity, although initially thought to be deceased remains alive on another dimensional level above our own.\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Incident 5099**__\n[[/div]]\nIncident 5099 occurred on 25/3/2010 and resulted in a complete breakdown of Site-24's chain of command and a major containment breach that could have, unknown to the Foundation at the time, constituted a HK-class Deific Subjugation scenario. \n\n> **Opening Statement**: Site-24 was declared lost on 25/3/2010 at 0800 hours, and was further upgraded as having a Containment Breach at 0900 hours and as such, MTF Sigma-29 (\"Lance of Longinus\") was assembled and mobilised, consisting of personnel who displayed CRV in excess of 150. In addition, they had previously operated in various anomalous hot zones and most had served under MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") at some point. \n> \n> They had two objectives: Primary Objective: Contain Site-24 and SCP-5099. Secondary Objective: Extract PoI Dr. Katelyn Morgenthau, if she remains alive.\n> \n> **Personnel**: MTF Sigma-29 (\"Lance of Longinus\"), consisting of:\n> \n> * Captain Seamus MacKenzie; Formerly Platoon Commander of Nu-7 before his promotion to Captain of the newly formed MTF, highly experienced at navigating breached Sites.\n> \n> * Lieutenant Luke Briggs; Formerly MI666 before joining the Foundation, was recruited to the Foundation in the aftermath of Operation Sleipnir[[footnote]]Operation Sleipnir was a covert operation performed by MI666 in 1997.[[/footnote]] .\n> \n> * Sergeant Kyle Winslow; Formerly Sgt. in Nu-7, was requested by MacKenzie to join Sigma-29.\n> \n> * Private Henry Sinclair; Formerly Pvt. in Nu-7, earned particular distinction during Nu-7's containment of Site-██.\n> \n> [[collapsible show =\"Display Log 5099.1\" hide =\"[Beginning Log 5099.1]\"]]\n> \n> //All members' cameras display their descent towards the entrance of Site-24 from grapnel lines. They touch down to the floor and flick their NV goggles down whilst their headlights blink on. Sinclair takes point at the reinforced blast door of Site-24, affixing an exothermic breaching device onto the bulkhead before retreating back to his team.//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Lads, mark up. Once those doors are open, we're on our own. I've got about as much a clue as to what's behind that as you do, alright? So any slackin' and you're going on the report.\n> \n> **Winslow**: Casualty report or the write-up report, Sir?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: You bloody know whi-\n> \n> //MacKenzie is interrupted by the exothermic charge detonating, knocking the doors roughly 5m inwards. A loud crunch can be heard as they collide with something inside of Site-24.//\n> \n> **Briggs**: Shite Sinclair, you were only supposed to blow the bloody door off.\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Enough out of you too Briggs. Form up.\n> \n> //MTF Sigma-29 move into the facility, headlight beams scanning from roof to floor with nothing in sight except the now broken blast door which lays crumpled against the wall.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Clear Sir, no hostiles, and no staff neither.\n> \n> //All four squad members proceed through the facility, no resistance is encountered and they come upon a junction. The right passage is labelled as \"Fragment Containment\" whilst the left passage is labelled as \"Staff Quarters\".//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Sinclair, you're with me. We'll head to Fragment Containment which seems to be a standard series of Containment Chambers from the map. Briggs, Winslow, you'll check Staff Quarters. Lethal force is authorised, but try not to make this a field day.\n> \n> **Winslow**: Captain, if I might. Can you give us any actionable intel whatsoever?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: It's above my pay grade Winslow, but I do know that those tests they performed at Central are what the boys and girls of Eta-10 go through. So any money says that we're dealing with a cognitohazard.\n> \n> **Briggs**: You read the brief, right Winslow? This place has turned into a loony bin and we're playing clean up down here.\n> \n> **Winslow**: Just shut up Briggs and move your sorry arse over here with me.\n> \n> //The two teams split apart and head their separate ways.//\n> [[/collapsible]]\n> [[collapsible show =\"Display Log 5099.2\" hide =\"[Beginning Log 5099.2]\"]]\n> \n> //MacKenzie and Sinclair are traversing through a series of water-logged Containment Chambers. Sinclair's camera pans upwards to reveal a burst water pipe that's been ruptured by a hand print shaped hole.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Captain, check this out, there's a hand print shaped hole in this water pipe. Didn't the PoI report seeing handprints?\n> \n> //MacKenzie glances upwards too and gestures for Sinclair to boost him up so he can reach the hole. He takes out a Hume counter and taps the side gently.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Sir, there's no need to do that with those things.\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Lad, when the meter says 200 Humes, I think I have a right to smack the damn thing. The stuff around this hole is so real that it's becoming unreal.\n> \n> //Sinclair shifts his weight as MacKenzie descends. As he turns his head, more hand prints of various sizes cluster the walls. A creaking on the wall behind them sends them spinning behind, both men raising their rifles at the sound.//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Sinclair, you look rough, you need a moment son?\n> \n> //The wall behind them has several twitching bodies embedded deep within it. The bodies seem to have atrophied away with hand prints covering  what remains of the skin.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: No s-sir, want me to check for the PoI?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: If any of those gits are her, there's not gonna be a need to.\n> \n> //The two continue onward, passing various hand prints imprinted into the walls, floor and ceilings. They pass a Containment Chamber with a large fragment of SCP-5099 contained within.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Sir, it's not just me is it, you don't think it looks like...?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Aye, it looks like someone left an ice-cream sandwich on the pavement for a whole day. Thing's melting to pieces. Command'll want a sample though so I have to indulge 'em that.\n> \n> //MacKenzie produces a vial and deposits the liquid into the bottle before turning to inspect the fragment. It appears to be what remains of SCP-5099-F.//\n> [[/collapsible]]\n> [[collapsible show =\"Display Log 5099.3\" hide =\"[Beginning Log 5099.3]\"]]\n> \n> //Feed cuts to Winslow and Briggs navigating the Staff Quarters. Winslow has point whilst Briggs is bringing up the rear.//\n> \n> **Briggs**: Don't reckon we'll run into any live ones, do you Lieutenant?\n> \n> **Winslow**: Every member of staff so far has either been deceased or entombed within the walls Briggs, so far, I'd say we're bloody lucky, wouldn't you?\n> \n> **Briggs**: Fair point, don't suppose you think the doc is still alive?\n> \n> **Winslow**: If I was a betting man, I'd say no. Check the staff bog and we can move on, can't we? Report back to MacKenzie and then move onto the dig site and finish the PO.\n> \n> //Briggs slowly rounds the corner of the Staff Toilet and raises his rifle to line. Hand prints line the floor leading up to the first stall.//\n> \n> **Briggs**: You can wait til last..\n> \n> //Briggs kicks the last stall open. Nothing is inside.//\n> \n> //Briggs moves to the next door and kicks it open. Inside is a series of hand prints encircling the rim of the toilet.//\n> \n> **Briggs**: Grim..\n> \n> //Briggs moves back to the first stall. The camera pans down as he inspects the hand prints that disappear as they pass under the stall door. He kicks it open and finds nothing as well.//\n> \n> **Winslow**: Shit yourself Briggs?\n> \n> **Briggs**: Very funny Winslow.. you sodding git.\n> [[/collapsible]]\n> [[collapsible show =\"Display Log 5099.4\" hide =\"[Beginning Log 5099.4]\"]]\n> \n> //The feed cuts once again. Briggs' camera pans upwards as they meet back with MacKenzie and Sinclair.//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Well, did you two find her?\n> \n> **Winslow**: Negative. Found the rest of the staff.\n> \n> **Briggs**: What's left anyways.. what the hell happened here?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Second verse same as the first, above my pay grade lads. That's for the researchers and the like to figure out. Not for us grunts.\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Captain, there's a chance she may be located deeper inside the facility.\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: The closer we get to the object, the stronger it's effects will be. So if you start feeling like you're part of a wall, try not to walk that direction. Hume meter is around 250 here.\n> \n> **Briggs**: So how are we still here? I mean, I ain't the smartest field agent but I know that big Hume equals bad.\n> \n> **Winslow**: My guess is that its partly thanks to our CRVs. Command did seem to handpick us due to those alone.\n> \n> //The four men continue in silence for five minutes as they descend further into the facility. SCP-5099 can be seen spanning the entire passageway, sealed behind glass windows.//\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Sir, it's displaying the same qualities as the fragment. It looks like its weeping, y'know like when a wound goes rotten and pussy.\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Gigantic rotten alien lance's from 5 billion years ago, just bloody wonderful ain't it.\n> \n> //The feed cuts again and they're now at the base of the digsite, the glass windows sealing away SCP-5099 are covered in hand print holes and some limbs can be seen twitching in the space between them. MacKenzie has point as they come across another fragment of SCP-5099.//\n> \n> **Winslow**: This is the fragment analysed by Dr. Katelyn Morgenthau, or one of them at least.\n> \n> **Briggs**: What the hell is that thing? It's got hands for a- Shit.\n> \n> //The four men turn to face Briggs and MacKenzie's camera shows Dr. Katelyn Morgenthau, curled up against the wall surrounded by hand prints.//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Don't anyone move. I swear to God, I mean it.\n> \n> //MacKenzie slowly edges forward, each foot forward shifting debris, SCP-5099 material and human remains aside as he reaches toward her. MacKenzie grabs hold of her and pulls her away as a gigantic hand print appears where Morgenthau was rested.//\n> \n> **Winslow**: SO achieved Captain, now how the hell do we fulfil the PO?\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: SO became our PO, containment is impossible at this time. We're out.\n> \n> //The four men move back upwards, Briggs is carrying Morgenthau in his arms and so the camera shifts from side to side, obscuring the view.//\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: Sinclair! Sinclair, what in God's name are you doing!\n> \n> **Sinclair**: Sir, you're gonna want to see this, I promise.\n> \n> **MacKenzie**: [REDACTED]\n> \n> //MacKenzie and Sinclair's camera angle shift focus to the base of the dig site where they found Morgenthau. The hand print hole had cracked open the rock to reveal a gigantic white humanoid approximately 100m tall with SCP-5099 impaled into its chest. Its face is two gigantic hands clasped together whilst liquid from SCP-5099 flows down onto its body. The entity's body is surrounded by multiple human bodies, twitching and writhing. Dr. Hans Higgs is suspended from the ceiling of the antechamber, his face twisted into a smile.//\n> [[/collapsible]]",
