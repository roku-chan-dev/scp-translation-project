These stories range from deep examinations of how these mythic inspirations change and grow over the ages as time and technology marches forward, personal stories about love and growth and finding companionship in the world, and big, bombastic set-piece adventures. \n\nThis is not a canon, but a tale series set within a larger setting. The main plotline of this series is closed to contribution without previous permission, but [[*user DrBleep]] is more than willing to hear out ideas for new pieces. \n\nThe current starting point of the series is On the Rails, though this is not the true starting point of the story. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Characters]]\n\n+ The Core Cast\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n+ Carissa Decimus\n-----\n**Divine Authority:** Teleportation/Portals, The Hunt, Healing/Disease, Moonlight.\n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/swallowed-by-a-prideful-lesbian-sea/Carissa.jpg style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//\"We're going to drag Jason from his fucking palace and skin him alive.\"//\n-----\n//Her eyes were wild, yellow, and slit like a cat's. Dangerous. Indiscriminate and violent, filled with the fire of a life lived surviving by the skin of one's teeth. Ears, pert and twisting this way and that, fluffy and feline, emerged from the wilderness of her thick maroon curls. The thing that was tilting her head drew away, a long tail ending in a tuft of fur.//\n\nLesbian and powerful archer of legend, Carissa is a force of nature on the battlefield with her ability to teleport herself and most projectiles anywhere she or they need to be. Angry, constantly embittered and furious at her past. An incredible polymath with the patience of a saint in the field, but the temperament of a honey badger and patience of a goldfish in social situations. She will do anything to secure a better life for Medea, her one and truest love. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n+ Medea of Colchis\n-----\n**Divine Authority:** Magic, Witchcraft, Sorcery, Borders and Liminal Spaces.\n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/medea-filicidium/Medea.jpg style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//\"You never loved me. You loved the idea of the power I brought you.\"//\n-----\n//A woman with sylvan ears, brown hair with purple tips, and bright lilac eyes. Arcane robes flow around her, glimmering with fading symbols.//\n\nThe sorceress of legend who brought Jason of Argos to glory and fame, and then snatched it all away again when he betrayed her. Cunning, brilliantly intelligent and aloof, Medea's strategems and plans are infamous for their multi-layered contingencies. Viciously sadistic, bloodthirsty, and murderous. Medea measures no end to the lengths and cruelty she will go to in order to secure her goals. History has taught her that a light hand ends in death. Yet in the midst of this jagged blade is a woman madly in love with her huntress, deeply curious about the world and magic. A woman who would do anything to secure their future together, and go to the ends of the universe in pursuit of greater knowledge.\n\nForbidden from the deepest sections of the Library for a crime no one quite understood, she seeks new and darker ways to secure a solution to a condition left behind by her traitorous former husband.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n+ Artemis\n----\n**Divine Authority:** Nature, The Hunt, Healing/Disease, Moonlight.\n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/seas-of-orcadia-hub/Artemis.png style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//\"Is that really all you wanted, kitten? There are so many interesting combinations you could have tried. Oh wait, here’s something fun.\"//\n----\n//Her hair flames green, a crown of deer antlers rising around her skull, framed by a wreath of flowers decorated with slivers of half-moons. Pink eyes with silver and green sheens look upon the target. Dressed in very finely tanned skins and leathers, skin kissed by the sun and the moon into a beautiful shade of olive.//\n\nGoddess of the hunt, of childbirth, and mistress of the Moon. Artemis was once known as a lone wolf, a solitary divinity who preferred the bounds of the forests, the twilight of crescent moons and fireflies. Aloof, distant, and anti-social, near the end of the Age of Gods she sacrificed nearly everything to secure a future and legacy in a rapidly changing world. Now she exists as but a shadow of herself... but with time and companionship, she has grown mischievous and teasing within her host.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n+ Abigail Im-Immaru\n----\n**Divine Authority:** Light, The Heavens, Justice, Mobile War, and Lustful Love.\n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/medea-filicidium/Abigail.jpg style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//\"Would you walk through the front door, fill out thirty forms, and screw around for a month while some pissant behind a desk stamped your forms in triplicate?\"//\n----\n//A woman with deeply olive-toned skin and mahogany eyes watches him. A pair of aviator sunglasses perch atop the brown strands of hair. Jeans and chunky sneakers, and a muscle shirt. Her skin constantly shifts with strands of curving light, moving and twirling in the form of intricate tattoos. Her jaw and cheeks are all sharp angles, sculpted.//\n\nThe Beast of Nature Inanna in the flesh. \n\nCharismatic, intensely flirty, good natured and extraverted, Abigail is a menace in social situations, always quick to banter and crack jokes at the expense of serious situations to raise the mood. Slow to anger, but quick to escalate. Abigail is easily bored, and even more so in the modern mundanity of the greater world; where there are few opportunities to really flex her muscles. Extremely protective of her family, especially her slightly younger sibling, morally righteous, and yet silver tongued. Abigail defaults to diplomacy but backs it up with indiscriminate force when the need arises. \n\nBearer of titles, and a Beast of Nature, should she so wish, Abigail could bring the world to heel. It is primarily boredom, and a disinterest in upending the good life she and her sibling have built that she remains content with current circumstances. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n+ Aleah Im-Immaru\n-----\n**Divine Authority:** Light, The Sun, Justice, Defensive War, Romantic Love.\n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/medea-filicidium/Aleah.jpg style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//\"It's ok to cry. It's ok to cry about what you've lost, who you've lost, what you've missed, and what you'll have going forward.\"//\n-----\n//Standing before his gaze is a doppelganger, a near identical being to Abigail, but with fewer lines on their face, and a denser build. His eyes scan them, the skirt, the lace top and wedge boots.//\n\nThe Beast of Nature Ishtar incarnate. \n\nShy, quiet, and keeps to herself. At the same time, charismatic in a gentler, more subtle way than her sister. Friendly, and fiercely loyal, morally righteous and deeply committed to protecting people and especially her family. Down to earth, and extremely close with her sister. \n\nAleah is driven to causes in ways that her sister is often not. In lieu of Abigail's preference to play with any potential opposition, Aleah brings to bear incredible force, seeking quick resolution to conflict at the expense of anything being left of her opponents. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n+ Dr. Emily Kurr\n-----\n**Divine Authority:** The Dead, Darkness, The Earth, Nightmares.\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/medea-filicidium/Emily.png style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[/>]]\n//One of many names, but a blip in a life longer than one can truly remember.//\n-----\n\n//Her hair gleams in the ambient light, maroon and dripping down her frame like blood, contrasting the piercing blue of her flame-like eyes. She wears gleaming golden armor that covers most of her upper body, and leg-guards that protect much of her legs.//\n\n//The right arm is severed at the shoulder joint, replaced with a prosthetic of blackened human arm bones.//\n\nDr. Kurr is quiet and distant, solitary and almost insistent on setting the board of machinations by herself. Deeply compassionate and concerned about the people of Valencia, she is an incredibly serious woman who brooks no nonsense except from those who she's closest to. Simultaneously a guardian and a reaper of reckoning, the path she follows is one that is not often brought into the light but impacts all around her. Though she will never admit it to anyone but Dr. Sarkis, she takes a deep pleasure in inspiring fear in those who stand against her, and sometimes even those who stand with her. \n\nThe Beast of Nature Ereshkigal. Unmatched on the field. \n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Setting]]\n\nWith the Old Gods takes place within the greater setting of the canon [[[Seas of Orcadia Hub | Seas of Orcadia Hub]]]. Locations, mechanics, rules, and lore are all in line with established plot-threads from that setting. \n\nThe world is changing, the great seals that keep the worst nightmares of the universe at bay are failing. Gods who once dwelt in the twilight of mortal society beneath the veil are awaking to a looming calamity. \n\nWar is coming. Opportunities are arising. Gods, Celestials, Demons, and Beasts of Nature are collectively beginning to emerge from the shelters of mortal society they were residing in. \n\n\nIn the morn and hours before war, the world shall rise to once more to face the Impasse. \n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab How to Contribute]]\n\nIf you wish to contribute to this closed series, please contact [[*user DrBleep]] with your concept.
