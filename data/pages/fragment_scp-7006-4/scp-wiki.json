However, due to the nature of the spinning cylinders, the grinder-door is one-way only.

It feels like the inside of a freezer. Dense frost smothers the walls, and cold, blue lighting from above illuminates the opposite door and an ornate pedestal in the middle of the room. The opposite door appears to be built of gold, and features an intricate eye design with red painted streaks to accent. The pedestal is made of the same gold, but has a repeated mouth pattern along its stem. Atop the pedestal is an indent where there rests a small dark orb, roughly pill sized, made of some smooth but organic material.//\n\nThe orb responds to human touch, and glows faintly red wherever skin contact is made. Notably, the pupil of the eye on the door responds in kind whenever the orb is touched, though all the glowing is very faint. If the orb is covered completely, such as being cupped by both hands, it will glow the brightest the party has seen it thus far; this will still not be enough to make the door open. More warmth is needed.\n\nPlacing the orb in someone’s mouth (it is sized to fit) will cause it glow even brighter. The red paint on the door will begin to glow faintly -- though nothing more will occur. It is only when a party member fully swallows the orb that the door will begin to open. However, the party member will quickly feel nauseous, and convulse, before erupting into red, ribbony lights from all their orifices.\n\nThe party member suffers no direct Damage, but will face immense trouble standing upright and moving towards the exit, requiring the help of the rest of the party.\n\nOnce the party member is through the door, they will cease to emit light, but will then suffer horrible pain as their left eye gets pushed out of their head, and then is replaced by the orb!\n\nThough the process is painful, the **Orb Eye** gifts its beholder with the ability to better visualize important things. Essentially, the gifted sees objects important to progression as glowing vibrantly orange through their left \"eye.\" However, there are no real specifications as to what \"important\" means (so that the game master has flexibility in the types of hints they would like to give).\n\n------\n\n= **Room 10: Keys**\n\n//You enter a room with a steep set of downward stairs.

He is able to deduce that he must be in some form of time loop, which the party is unable to escape from, and determines that a ritual he cast to escape his death by explosion once must have failed. He decides to use the party members as a sacrifice to correct the ritual, so that he may escape the loop, and will attempt to attack and kill the party.\n\nThe spell that Nicto cast on the door will dissipate after his death.
