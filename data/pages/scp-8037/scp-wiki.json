Routine feeding and plant care is performed by Containment Technicians when SCP-8037 is not involved in active testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8037 is an instance of the Venus flytrap[[footnote]]Dionaea muscipula[[/footnote]] plant. It is significantly larger than typical examples of the species, and exceeds the natural limits of energy and movement for flora of its kind. It has four of the distinct leaves, in addition to several vine-like tendrils which it controls with exceptional strength and precision. SCP-8037 is capable of autonomous movement, utilizing its features to manipulate objects and move itself around in its environment. It is rooted in soil held by a planter pot made of alumina ceramic. \n\nSCP-8037 is capable of speech. The leaves move in sync with the expressed vocalizations, despite impossibility of the floral physiology producing such sounds. SCP-8037 primarily speaks in a distinct manner characterised by lyrical verse and vocal harmonies of barbershop music.\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n__**Addedum-01: Discovery**__ \n\n> **Foreword:** //Routine Foundation Normalcy Monitoring Systems detected a potential disturbance at the premises of Green Al's Garden Kingdom in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

It's a hobby shop on a Wednesday afternoon, of course it wouldn't be busy.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** But I haven't seen any employees around either.\n> \n> **Agent Polk:** Huh. Good point.\n> \n> **Agent Rodney:** Aha! Here we go... Are you close to the greenhouse yet?

Merely a scheduling conflict between overworked staff, in a facility with equipment which is behind on maintenance...\n> \n> **Dr. Reed:** Remind me to omit that later. Keep such discussions between you and the appropriate channels, not on SCP documents. \n> \n> **Researcher Humphrey:** I'm just saying.\n> \n> **Dr. Reed:** Never mind.
