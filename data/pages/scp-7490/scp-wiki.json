Scranton Reality Anchor devices have been installed in each corner of the containment chamber to regulate fluctuations of SCP-7490's property. No personnel is permitted to enter the containment chamber or the 15-meter exclusion zone that encompasses SCP-7490's area of effect. Interviews conducted with SCP-7490 are to be held with Dr. Tony Carmichael and Assistant Researcher Dr. Jessica Millar through a video conference from the secure observation room. This applies to the weekly sessions with psychologist Dr. Connor Quinn. SCP-7490 is to be provided three Grade-B meals daily.[[/span]] \n\n= [[span class=\"mediumtext\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 100%; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0rem !important; max-width: 53rem; margin: auto; opacity: 95%;\"]] When SCP-7490 is to be brought for testing, a Scranton Reality Anchor on a flat dolly with three armed on-site guards are to transport the subject to Testing-Block 6 in Sub-Level 3.[[/span]] \n\n\n-------\n\n= [[span class=\"mediumtext\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 100%; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0rem !important; max-width: 53rem; margin: auto; opacity: 95%;\"]] **Description:** SCP-7490 is a 27-year-old humanoid caucasian female, formerly known as \"Agt. Felicia Mallory\" who was a Tactical Response Officer stationed with Gamma-9. Originally, it was thought that SCP-7490 anomalous capabilities can cause events harmful to human life in its surrounding area. The range and severity of these events can change drastically[[footnote]] Ranging from minor malfunctions within paraphernalia to tragic events.[[/footnote]]  and without warning.[[/span]] \n\n= [[span class=\"mediumtext\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 100%; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0rem !important; max-width: 53rem; margin: auto; opacity: 95%;\"]] The distance of SCP-7490's anomalous properties fluctuates from a typical 5-meter radius to site-wide, perhaps greater if not cautious (See Test 7490.3 by Dr. Carmichael). The effects of SCP-7490 typically take within a 24- hour time frame and has not exceeded that. Currently, there are no feasible methods of undoing, delaying, and preventing these effects.[[/span]] \n\n= [[span class=\"mediumtext\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 100%; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0rem !important; max-width: 53rem; margin: auto; opacity: 95%;\"]] As of 08/28/2013, SCP-7490 can cause favorable outcomes to anyone within its surrounding area (See Incidents 7490.3 in Addendum-4). SCP-7490 is not able to control the condition of said effects or the moment when they occur. SCP-7490 is also not impervious to its anomaly, regardless if it were harmful or beneficial. The condition of SCP-7490, be it physical, mental, or emotional dictates and alter its effects.[[/span]] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ **Addendum-1: Inciting Incidents** \n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n= [[span class=\"mediumtext\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 100%; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.0rem !important; max-width: 53rem; margin: auto; opacity: 95%;\"]] On 07/12/2013, Mobile Task Force Gamma-9 (“Fire Eaters”) was deployed as part of Operation Daisy Cutter[[footnote]] Operation Daisy Cutter was a mission to search and destroy nearby active Chaos Insurgency checkpoints.

However, we must remember that it is only because of its state of mind and not because it wills it so. Because of that, SCP-7490 can either make Site-39 fall or continue to keep it standing. For the sake of our stability, we will continue with its containment along with these sessions. Please schedule a one-on-one meeting with me if anyone has any concerns or suggestions regarding its containment. \n\n= I have also heard rumors that SCP-7490 will be used to develop Site-39's prominence. I am here to disclose that we will do no such thing. Not only will we be painting a target on our backs, but the notion of utilizing an SCP that thinks and feels like us is unethical. I will no longer hear such nonsense going forward.\n\n= Other than that, we will see what SCP-7490 has in store for us in the future. In the meantime, be cautious and treat SCP-7490 with the utmost sensitivity. SCP-7490 was, and still is, one of us. And so, SCP-7490 is our responsibility. \n\n= We will Secure. We will Contain. We will Protect.\n\n= Good luck to all. And stay safe.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7489]]] | SCP-7490 | [[[SCP-7491]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
