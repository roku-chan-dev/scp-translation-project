[[/footnote]], governments affiliated with the Foundation have enacted an indefinite ban on the hunting and consumption of //cervidaes// species. Rothenberg has been taken into Foundation custody, and is receiving intensive care.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to the ecological niche SCP-5523 facilitates, removal of SCP-5523-1 specimens from forested areas is prohibited.  Regions containing significant SCP-5523-1 populations have been cordoned from the public, with low-level security fences established around the perimeter of SCP-5523 affected areas. \n\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name= 800px-Starr-100901-8979-Wikstroemia_monticola-habitat_and_goat_skeleton-Kanaio_Natural_Area_Reserve-Maui_(24755353650).jpg |\n    caption= Skeletal remains associated with SCP-5523.|\n    width=300px\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5523 is a Terminal[[footnote]] Originally referring to an entity or anomaly that incorporates human beings into it following death. Following the discovery of SCP-5523, it has been determined that animal specimens can be incorporated into Terminal anomalies. [[/footnote]]-Class group of environmental changes, consisting of behavioral modifications and biological mutations affecting members of the Cervidaes family.[[footnote]] A biological group consisting of Deers. [[/footnote]] SCP-5523 events have been observed to occur after periods of severe environmental damage, such as forest fires or times of drought.  SCP-5523 does not affect all individual Cervidaes specimens within a given area. Elderly populations or specific individuals experiencing sickness are more susceptible to developing SCP-5523 then young and healthy populations. SCP-5523 consists of the ingestion of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//[[footnote]] Variously known as lingonberry, partridgeberry, mountain cranberry or cowberry. [[/footnote]] berries. //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// are typically not eaten by Cervidaes specimens, due to the individual berries containing toxic substances.\n\nSCP-5523 affected individuals[[footnote]] Designated as SCP-5523-1 instances. [[/footnote]] ingest great quantities of //Vaccinium vitis-idaea//, in which the poisonous materials will accumulate within the individual's bloodstream. After a period of approximately fourty-two hours, the SCP-5523-1 instance will die, leading to rapid decomposition occuring, without assistance from maggots or other decomposer organisms. Skeletal remains will develop //Vaccinium vitis-idaea// saplings, along with spear-heading the growth of boreal plants, including Greenbrier, Poison Ivy, and Buckweed, all specimens of plants favored by Cervidaes. Following continued research, it has been determined that over ██ percent of forest growth worldwide has developed due to SCP-5523.\n\n**Addendum No. 1:** Rothenberg Incident\n\nSid Rothenberg, a Canadian civilian, outdoorsman and biologist, experienced a period of confusion and delirium following ingestion of venison harvested from an SCP-5523-1 specimen. An outdoor journal, kept during the period of delirium, was recovered. The following is an excerpt.\n\n> I am sick. There is a sickness within my body, I feel it inside me. The simple explanation is maggots, improperly cooked meat. But I feel as if there is something more, something that can explain why my mind is repeating words to me. '//Greenbrier.//' '//Poison Ivy.//' '//Buckweed.//' Why are these words repeated to me? All speculation, at this point.\n>[[size 0%]]...[[/size]]\n>\n> I'm resting by the fire, waiting for rescue. I'm looking at the forest around me, hearing the rutting of elk, the cawing of crow. The howl of a wolf. Something is clear to me. The Earth is dying, and we do not notice. \n> [[size 0%]]...[[/size]]\n>\n> I fell asleep by the light of the moon, and I dreamt of my death, my skeleton, my bones, growing across the forest, like the roots of a tree. My death will bring the forest green, and the earth as brown as the first people.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5522]]] | SCP-5523 | [[[SCP-5524]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
