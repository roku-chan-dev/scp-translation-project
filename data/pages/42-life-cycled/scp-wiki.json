She wouldn't have ranked highly on a theoretical list of everyone who had ever been jolly; she was, she felt, most likely in the bottom percentile. But she couldn't shake the phrase, like it was burned into her brain. //I am the jolliest of all possible jollies. I am the jolliest of all possible jollies.// And it wasn't just the words. She had many techniques for calming herself down, for resetting her brain, but she kept falling into one in particular now. It wasn't the best one. It wasn't even a very good one. But she kept doing it anyway.\n\nShe kept counting to ten.\n\nWell, nine. She kept counting to nine, in her head. //1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...// Actually, she could never get past seven. She kept starting over. It was like the metre to a song, and she didn't know the words...\n\nWell, okay. She knew the words. //I am the jolliest of all possible jollies.// Was this a song she'd heard somewhere? It was driving her crazy. It couldn't be a cognitohazard, because it had been bouncing around in her head since yesterday, and there had been no further ill effects. She knew this for a fact. She'd been tested.\n\nShe'd been tested because in a series of events too embarrassing to even think about, she'd staggered out of her dorm room with the flu during the 5243 lockdown, nearly walked into AAF-D, and ended up in a pool of her own vomit in Archives and Revision. Sokolsky had found her there, had taken her to H&P himself, had administered memetic tests and confirmed nothing was wrong with her. No compulsions. No possession. Nothing was wrong with her brain. The tests were never wrong.\n\nShe sat up in bed, picked up her work tablet, and put the call through. Sokolsky picked up almost immediately; if he'd been asleep, he gave no sign of it. \"Ayo.\"\n\n\"I'm having intrusive thoughts.\"\n\n\"Is that a pickup line?\"\n\nShe smirked. \"I keep hearing a phrase in my head. //I am the jolliest of all possible jollies.// Does that mean anything to you?\"\n\n\"It means you lack self-knowledge.\" He yawned. \"Doesn't sound like you at all.

Well, how about this.\" He sounded bored. \"If you can't stop focusing on it in a week, we'll consider it a cognitohazard. If I don't hear back from you about it, I'll assume it's probably just that you bumped your pretty head. There's a ton of minor cognitive anomalies going around, thanks to the breach, and most of them are innocuous. I'll make a report, but don't expect anything to come of it.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" She flicked off the call. \"Asshole.\"\n\nShe was certain it would still be there in a week.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n+ ##990011|2009##\n++ 8 May\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nShe tapped the big green button which had appeared at the bottom of her terminal. \"Elstrom.\"\n\n\"Hello, Dr. Elstrom.\" The technician on the other end of the line, one Winston Barkley according to the call log, sounded a little tense. //Good.

It's not that I'm not listening, we just need the codes repeated once. It's a memetic thing.\"\n\n\"Sure. Continue.\" She paged through her emails, multitasking. It wasn't enough multitasking for her tastes, because one of the tasks was from someone else's daily schedule. She hoped there weren't too many more questions.\n\n\"Last one. Can you tell me your 43NET password?\"\n\nShe rattled it off more easily than she had her own birthday. \"i1am2the3jolliest4of5all6possible7jollies.\"\n\n\"Thanks.

She said: \"I, um.\"\n\nThe technician sounded confused. \"Just need you to repeat it for me, doc. Just the way you did a second ago.\"\n\n\"I realize that,\" she snapped. Her fear reaction was irritation. \"I... could you repeat it back to //me?//\"\n\nThe pause made her angry. She knew what it meant. \"Uh... I can't really do that. Protocol. You know.\"\n\nKaren did know protocol. Nobody knew protocol like Karen. But that didn't matter. \"It's just a temporary blip,\" she said. \"I've got... I don't know.

This is above your pay grade.\"\n\nThe relief was palpable. \"Yes ma'am. I'll contact Chief Veiksaar.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she said hurriedly. \"Could you contact Dr. Sokolsky instead?

Using it as a high-security password makes sense; nothing's more secure than something you literally can't make a copy of. And it's been months, so if there were loopholes to abuse we'd have found them by now. No, from a technical standpoint, it's a sound plan.\"\n\n\"Do you have non-technical concerns?\" Harry asked.\n\nShe squirmed. \"I don't know. It feels too similar to those overlays you guys were talking about, but... that's not it, actually. I just don't like making use of anomalies like this. It isn't standard practice, and I'm afraid it might be a slippery slope.\"\n\nSokolsky slung an arm around her shoulder. \"We'll take care of it together.

He could afford to turn his head a few degrees, and see what he saw.\n\nWas there a flicker of recognition in the other man's perpetually young face as he darted to Nascimbeni's side? Did he remember, somehow, that he'd done this before eight times over? Or was he just surprised to see the man who was charged with the safe operation of AAF-D standing in front of its electric light orchestra and not doing a damn thing about it except gaping like an idiot?\n\nHe managed to catch Wirth's eye in the moment before the tentacle broke his back, this time.\n\nHe didn't manage to decode the oscillating pupil size into an accurate emotional measurement. What governed this last moment of the young researcher's life? Fear? Confusion? Pain?\n\nHe managed to stay on his feet this time, as he waited for the agents to rush over. He ran through the script, as he always did, and watched them race bravely to their peculiar ends. Was it sweet how Radcliffe shot after Gwilherm when she plunged into the airlock, his protective instinct driving him to death after death after death, or given what they'd learned in the first alternate timeline, was it sad? Pathetic? Perhaps even revolting?\n\nWhat was Mukami thinking as she watched him seal her in?\n\nWhat was //he// thinking?

She could have upgraded to something better by now, no longer a mere junior researcher, no longer lacking a doctoral degree, but they'd all become so accustomed to the space, its comfortable closeness, that she simply didn't bother. She spent most of her time in Harry's spacious accommodations anyway.\n\nLillian was leaning back in something resembling satisfaction, chair creaking under not very much weight. \"Another year, another... nothing's suggesting itself.

She'd deleted it on her end.\n\nHe turned off the device, took a deep breath of strange desert air, and got up to face the rest of his long life.\n\nIt didn't matter.\n\nHe hadn't lost anything.\n\nIt had only been a dream, after all.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nBy common consensus, they were to meet in McInnis' office at six o'clock sharp. That left them an entire day at loose ends. Harry looked over his sketchbook, comparing the latest images to the earliest. He'd certainly improved since the first breach, particularly towards the tail end of 2003 when he'd gotten a little more frantic and hurried, and some genuine flourish had snuck into his otherwise mannered and cartoonish style. There hadn't been so much progress since, but he resolved to make the next set better still. He hoped he'd have fewer ghoulish scenes to render. \n\nPerhaps he could make that wish become their reality.\n\nHe crossed paths with most of the others over the course of the day. McInnis was observing the repair efforts, listening with calm interest to damage reports and casualty complaints. Everyone he spoke to seemed to share at least some of his cool by the time he moved on. Lillian sat in her office and memorized everything in the M&C filespace. She said she was building up a library for later use. He didn't have the courage to ask what uses she projected for it. Ibanez went to check on her Foundation-provided home in Grand Bend, which she paid a housekeeper to look after since she'd never actually visited. Pensak went with her. They took all afternoon. Nascimbeni drove to Grand Cove to visit his son and granddaughter, on the Director's suggestion. He found their truck missing from the driveway; a quick call to Gallo's landline confirmed that they'd gone on vacation to the CÃ´te d'Azur and wouldn't be back for a week. He drove back to the Site and spent the rest of the day trying to get as far ahead on the fixes as he could. Wettle went back to H&P and refused to leave the ward until the appointed hour. He'd had enough injuries for one day, he said.\n\nHarry had no idea where Udo spent her spare time, but RozÃ¡lie Astrauskas said she'd seen her former friend headed for Theology and Teleology around lunch time. She seemed upset about it. \n\nFor some reason, he was too.\n\nAt six o'clock they congregated, every one distracted and nervous for slightly different reasons. \n\nAll except McInnis. \"Whatever else happens,\" he promised them, \"we'll find each other again.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling the pull,\" said Lillian. \"Maybe this is where we're supposed to be?\"\n\n\"That'd be lucky. We're never lucky,\" Wettle observed sulkily.\n\n\"You're looking lively,\" Udo remarked. Del was rocking back and forth on her heels and humming. \"Housewarming go well?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she smiled. \"Very warm.\"\n\nAnd so on, and so forth, until the moment of truth.\n\nIt hit each of them equally, the nausea and disorientation, but nobody threw up, and nobody fell over. Apparently Lillian had been correct. Their other selves had met here, too.\n\nThe office was unchanged. Del put one hand on her service weapon, and opened the door to Zulfikar's office.\n\nThe secretary was at his desk. He smiled at her, then peeked around the doorframe and beckoned to the rest of them. \"Come on out!\"\n\nThey filed into the A&O offices. Skellicorne was sitting on his daÃ¯s, reading a newspaper. Karen was taking a call. Outside the glass partition, people were going about their tasks either personal or professional in the northern dorms.\n\nHarry headed into Operations Control, and they followed him wordlessly. The All-Sections Chief was standing in front of a bank of monitors, the stations all occupied by techs with cups of coffee and boxes of donuts, calmly paging through system reports. On the big board, all lights were green.\n\nIt was business as usual at Site-43.\n\nThe ASC turned around, and smiled at them in evident relief. \"Well done as always, friends.\" \n\n\"Welcome back to baseline.\"\n\n[[=image DLteaser.jpg]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/41-the-world-wide-web| previous-title=The World Wide Web\n| next-url=/ | next-title=Fin\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-tomorrow-hub | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Wrong Tomorrow\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** Everything!\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
