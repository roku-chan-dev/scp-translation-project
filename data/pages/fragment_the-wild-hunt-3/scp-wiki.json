  "content": "##green|Shout awoke to the weight of Fades’ arm brushing against  him. He felt fresh, as though he caught up on sleep he hadn’t known he missed out on. Fades was sitting next to him on the couch, flipping through TV channels in search of something fun to watch. He was back at the dorm he had seen himself open for Fades. But it all had to be a dream. It //had// to be. He was fine. As long as Fades was here, he was alright.##\n\n“...the Mayor is urging citizens to comply with the Shelter-in-Place order, as elements of the unnamed paramilitary group are still at large in the city and highly dangerous. She declined to comment on whether the US military planned to conduct airstrikes within the Boston metropolitan area…”\n\n\t“...mental health epidemic is sure to stick around even if the crisis ends, with an estimated two hundred and eighty thousand fathers, mothers, and siblings of the lost….”\n\t\n\t“...represents the longest period of time between waves of disappearances, indicating a possible end to the ongoing tragedy that has gripped America for almost a year now. Though the White House or other federal agencies have yet to issue any official statement…we’re sorry to interrupt, but we have breaking news: fleeing civilians are flooding into Boston from outlying suburbs after a series of skirmishes between national guard troops and paramilitaries…”\n\t\n\t“What college student in 2024 has cable instead of just getting a smart TV?” Fades said, tossing the remote aside. “Deadass, what do you even watch? Am I squatting in the one retiree’s dorm room on campus?” \n\t\n\tShout heard a pop, and the clicking of something metal falling to the ground. He tried to crane his neck, only for pain to shoot up the entire left side of his body. He saw Fades’ had popped the cap off a beer bottle with the buckle of her own belt, which for convenience’s sake she had wrapped around her left arm. “You’re missing out, Shout,” she said, “World’s going to shit in really cool ways. You’d love it.” She lifted the beer bottle to his lips, “It’s your favorite,” she said, “Guess retirees dig Miller High Life.”\n\t\n“Don’t mind if I do,” Shout said, grabbing the bottle. \n\nFades screamed, and her hand yanked the bottle; Shout instinctively tightened his grip, and the liquid left the bottle behind on its way up, then down. The suds and amber liquid splashed them both.\n\nShout relished the way her eyes went wild and the way her voice stuttered into a staccato “OH.” Her slack-jawed mouth revealed her dimples, and her heavy breathing staggered into outright laughter. Solar eclipses, blue moons, decade perennials, and Fades’ being surprised had a lot in common.\n“Hey,” he said. He stood up,  shaking the blanket off himself, and realized Fades had stripped off his shirt, and pulled off his pants. He smiled, rolled his eyes, and reached for something to try to dry his chest, when he noticed an oddly textured, bloody mass out the corner of his eye. His mouth went dry when he realized those were his clothes. His shirt has been cut open by Fades’ trembling hands and was glazed with ruddy amber, smeared with flower petals, and covered in odd,  sponge-textured tree branches. His pants were more conventionally caked with dried blood and grass sod. \nHe felt Fades’ hand on his cheek draw his face towards her. “I got you,” Fades said, and, without breaking her eye contact with him, peeled off her own shirt.\n\nIt was splattered with the dried contents of his mouth and lungs from when she tried to breathe him back to life, but Shout didn’t mind when she used it soak the dampness of his skin, letting her warm breath tickle his neck and jaw until Shout could only hear his heart beat in his ears and her breathy chuckle. She dropped her shirt and idly let her finger drag along a path between the many animal tattoos on Shout’s chest, her nail pressing briefly into a red sparrow’s beak on Shout’s upper pectorals, and then dragging a soft path along the small black cat near Shout’s heart and eventually circling just under the butterfly next to his belly.\n\n“Shower?” Shout and Fades both said.\n…\n\nThey didn’t make it to the shower, let alone the bedroom. Eventually, Fades laughingly pushed Shout away and climbed  off the kitchen counter before letting Shout drag her back to the couch. They didn’t so much stop as burn out. The fun actually gave  Fades’ brain the space to race faster than usual, and by the time she felt Shout begin to snore under her, she had made a list and decided she didn’t need the gun. \n\n\tOne: Take a shower.\n\t\n\tTwo: Get some clothes.\n\t\nAfter a hot shower, she was too single-minded on gathering fresh clothes for herself and Shout to care that the bedroom smelled peculiar, of dust, wet cardboard and oil paint. She turned it upside down finding clothes for herself, lucking into some gray denim shorts, a purple and lavender hooded t-shirt, and black sneakers for herself.  She couldn’t find anything for Shout in the bedroom, but she remembered the neat pile of clothes in the main hallway just outside the unit’s door. The first time she came across it, she’d found the apartment key in the pocket of a skirt. This time she found a slightly-too-large pink dress shirt and a pair of checkerboard pattern shorts .) She made a mental note to find some discrete way of destroying their Foundation issued uniforms. Fire, too conspicuous; garbage, too public; wash the uniforms and stash them between vintage trench coats at the Garment District, inconveniently across the Charles River, but under consideration.\n\nThree: Tuck the truck\n\nThe humvee was still there, the bumper a few inches from the flagpole. She spent an hour stalking the campus, first looking for evidence of police activity, then evidence of prying eyes, and then evidence of anyone, and found none of the above. Eventually, Fades gathered the nerve to walk over to the Humvee. She pulled open the driver’s side door, climbed onto the passenger’s seat, grabbed the lighter and remaining blunts from the still open glove compartment, pocketing them for later.  She checked the skies for buzzing helicopters and dancing fighter-bombers and took a moment to sort through her racing thoughts. \n\nMaybe the police were keeping civilians from getting in the way of an imminent sting operation. That possibility didn’t interest Fades, because there was little she could do about it. \n\n\tOccam’s razor: she couldn’t find anyone on campus because there wasn’t anyone on campus and there hadn’t been for some time. Colleges had already seen a sharp decline in applications  around the time the Foundation took charge of sheltering its staff’s children, and that was eight months ago.\n\t\nThat satisfied her curiosity about the empty campus, but another question came to mind: whose Humvee was this? A ridiculous question - it belonged to the scared driver, who lent it to-, lent it to-, lent it to-Fades closed her eyes out of frustration. She’d never run into a hole in her thoughts before.\n\nWhat was her husband last night?\n\nWhat was her husband last night?\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nIt’s still Shout. \n\n“It’s Shout,” She muttered, “It’s Shout.” She searched the rest of the truck and  found a satchel filled with groceries, including ground beef, eggplant, cucumber, and corn. Just what she had been looking for. Shout enjoyed cooking for her. He’d told her  it was the closest thing he had to reliable stress management. She added a few more useful items she found to the satchel and he drove the humvee into a nearby garage. After scurrying back inside the building and up the stairs, she stopped for breath just outside the apartment door. Mission accomplished, she thought, as she reached for the doorknob.\n\n...\n\nShout was both a heavy sleeper, but extremely sensitive to loud noises. That’s why, when the door walloped the frame, and he felt Fades’ absence on his chest, around forty five percent of his brain accepted that Fades had gone out to run some errands, and had just come back. Unfortunately, his body was only listening to the traumatized fifty five percent. He tumbled off the couch, and scrambled to his feet, instinctually screaming his wife’s name. \n\nHis voice felt dry and raspy. He closed his eyes again and breathed the panic out, using the exercise his Foundation-approved therapist had taught him, so he could pleasantly tell Fades, “Good morning, you scared me,” instead of “What the fuck, Fades.”He opened his eyes.\n\nThat was not Fades.\n\nHe saw ##purple| Robert Lapin## standing at the door. He was not happy to have the traumatized part of his brain be vindicated like this. ##purple| It is okay, for his trauma will not haunt him for long. I am here, and his narrative shall become mine. ##\n\n“W-who are you?” Shout asked. His face felt damp. He looked at where he’d just slept and saw a head-sized red colored patch on the teal polyester. He felt his face, and saw blood on his finger-tips, and a set of clothes neatly laid out for him on the floor, and finally, the lack of clothes actually on his person. He stumbled backwards.\n\n“I would hope that’s self-evident.” ##purple| Private Robert Lapin ## said, “I am a member of the US Navy Seals. You are a runaway and an imposter.” ##purple|Robert Lapin## walked over to the stove and turned on an electric kettle. “When you’ve made yourself decent, do join me for a cup of tea. Or would you rather I call in back-up now?”\n\n“Just a second, I’ve got to find my…”\n\n“Take your time,” ##purple|Robert Lapin## said, “I will, however, suggest you take too much of mine. What are you doing now?”\n\n“I’m…I’m just trying to wipe my…”\n\n“Your bloody hands? On furniture that doesn’t belong to you? I think your clothes will suffice.”\n\n“Can I quickly pop into the bathroom?”\n\nSilence. “Guess not,” Shout thought.\n\nShout tried to restore some order to his hair, forgetting the state of his hands. His scalp felt somewhat sticky to the touch - likely from whatever…whatever happened to him back at Site-46. \n“Pardon my…didn’t take a show-”\n\n“I know. Are we expecting any other guests for tea?”\n\n“No,” Shout replied, and immediately felt a migraine blossom, though he did his best to keep a straight face throughout the pain.What was he going to do when Fades returned from…wherever she was? What if ##purple|Robert Lapin## had reached her first? What if something or someone took her? What would Shout do? What could he do? \n\n##purple|Shout had learned that lies are very expensive in this new life of his, and that he must do his best to remain courteous with the visitor without actually telling him anything valuable. He shouldn’t lie, he shouldn’t be abrupt or defensive, and he should never, ever, ever name things.##\n\n“You appear to have had a nasty spill.” The tea kettle whistled, and seemingly seconds afterwards, he was passed a cup of strong smelling tea, and the billowing aroma of crisp-leafed trees in autumn lifted into his nostrils. \n\n“I could call the police,” Robert Lapin said, “I suggest you try to make my patience worthwhile. Where are you coming from?”\n\n“Lived at the Pru.”\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n“What’s yours?” Shout asked, somehow already knowing the answer.\n\n##purple|“Immaterial. You’re bleeding all over, it seems. Why? Whence?”##\n\n##purple|“I…nosebleed, I guess?”##\n\n“So what is your name?” ##purple|Robert Lapin## asked. \n\nTruth be told, he didn’t know. ##purple|And Shout doesn’t. What he calls himself, and what his wife is allowed to say to refer to him are conveniences, not identities. ##\n\n“I was mistaken. Watching the police have their way with you will be far more entertaining.” \n\nThere was a click. Shout noticed the door knob begin to twist. If it wasn’t Fades, he was screwed anyways. In the event that it was, he needed to keep ##purple|Robert Lapin’s## attention on him.\n\n“Samwell Tarly,” ##purple|the fucking idiot## said, and suddenly his hands felt like something was peeling the skin off their bones. He almost threw up then and there. He saw the door bump open just a bit.\n\n“Okay, Samwell Tarly,” ##purple|Robert Lapin## said, “Fascinating. Your name and your flesh are a unity. An abomination, to be sure, but a delicious one. I must applaud you for rewarding my habit of suffering fools gently. Pardon me for asking, but what do you make of what I’ve done to your finger?”\n\n“What…what?” Shout asked, and looked down to see that the five year old stump on his ring-finger had opened once more. He saw something that looked like a tree branch puncture its way through the bone. \n\nThe blood is now flowing out of Shout’s ear. ##purple|Shout was experiencing a neural hemorrhage, but he shouldn’t be concerned. His cognition had ceased to be neurological a week ago. The best parts of his soul transcend his failing body.##\n\nThe door swung open, and Shout used his one good hand to splash ##purple|Robert Lapin with the boiling tea, and Robert Lapin’s long ears quivered as Robert Lapin stumbled backwards, visibly in pain. Then, Shout heard a sickening crack, and Robert Lapin slumped over the kitchen counter. ##\n\n##purple|When Shout finally saw Fades, she’d already slammed the blade of the E-Tool on the back of Robert Lapin’s head a second, and then a third time. Before Robert Lapin could bring himself up to his full height of eight feet, Shout screamed the pain out of his body, and threw himself against Robert Lapin’s legs as hard as he could, propelling the giant rabbit-person off the counter and onto the floor. Fades aimed a final strike directly at Robert Lapin’s left eye.##\n\nAt that moment, Shout saw one of Robert Lapin’s legs swing upwards and make contact with Fades’ chest, throwing her backwards across the room. He heard a bang that must have been her slamming into the door, and then a deeper thud as her body hit the ground. Shout screamed his wife’s name, then heard a ‘pop’ before feeling something tighten around his neck, and then he felt himself get yanked into the air, windpipe squeezed shut by tight, furry fingers. ##purple| --Shout-- realized Robert Lapin had grabbed him by the neck with one hand and had lifted him a foot or so above the ground. ##\n\n“I’ve never eaten a Name before.” Robert Lapin said, “This will be rather novel for me.”\n\n“##purple|I have##,” ##purple|O5-06## said. \n\nThen, with two quick piercing movements with her wooden digit, she punctured --Robert Lapin’s-- eyeballs, and then exhaled heavily into --Robert Lapin’s-- bleeding sockets, which burned and shriveled in response\n\n--Robert Lapin-- dropped O5-06 and covered his eye-sockets with his hands as he roared in pain and terror. O5-06’s human nose barely recognized the scent of --Robert Lapin’s-- singed attributes. Her human eyes could not detect the conceptual decay of --Robert Lapin’s-- Name as it exhausted its half-life and its radiance became hers. \n\nOn the other hand, her human hands and human mouth were perfectly adequate to the task that remained to her. \n\nShe heard Fades’s moan of pain, and walked over to the helpless girl, using fingers that resembled human digits to check her pulse. With an ethically appropriate amount of force, O5-06 slapped Fades into consciousness, and then looked at her eyes for signs of a concussion.  Fades mumbled something, presumably her husband’s name, but by then, O5-06 was preoccupied with running her harsh fingers over Fades’ body in search of broken bones. Not even a cracked rib. Nothing more dramatic than a week or two of uncomfortable breathing. She tapped the wife’s left shoulder, and winced when Fades’ screamed. O5-06 assessed the deformation, and arrived at what to do next.\nShe could see the pupils of Fades’ eyes dilate properly. “Shout, what are you…what are you laughing at?” Fades stammered.\n\nO5-06 got that a lot from people, even when she really wasn’t. She was pleased to see Fades. All things considered, it had been awhile. Fades hadn’t even invited her to the wedding.\n\n“Are you ready?” O5-06 said.\n\nFades’ eyes widened. Her face stretched in a silent scream, but instead she mouthed a barely voiced “Mom.” Then O5-06 grit her teeth, and Fades screamed as her shoulder popped back into place.\n\nO5-06 left Fades’ to her usual routine of trying too hard to be tough. She turned her attention to the second person of interest in that room, and walked towards Robert Lapin. She knelt next to it and whispered: “All things considered, my furry friend, I hope this will be novel for both of us.” She began to do what came natural to her, only pausing to mark the moment Fades’ passed out from either pain or shock. When the furry friend could no longer scream, it shook instead, all the way until the end.\n…\n\tFades felt Shout’s fingers graze her cheek. Then, a slap opened her eyes with a jolt. She saw O5-06’s face inches from hers. Her thrill-quickened breath splashed her face. O5-06’s face-splitting grin and wolf-like gaze made her husband’s features altogether alien. She switched gears, telling herself it was not Shout’s hand that struck her, but she couldn’t help but think Shout smiled a lot too. Laughter came easier to him than it did Fades, and she’d feel furthest from him in these moments., watching Shout find joy she could never understand, but in this gap between them she ached to fall. She didn’t want him to settle for her dead heart, not when he could make hers flush with blood with a glance or a touch. The sting of O5-06’s blow lingered. “You look like shit,” O5-06 said.\n\t\n\tThe intrusive thought was stubborn: Shout was a lot like Mom. They shared that same hunger for joy. The difference was Shout dreamed of filling the world with music and O5-06 longed to make it howl.\n\t\nBehind O5-06, the apartment looked spotless. No trace of the fight or the anomaly that had attacked them.\n\n“What are you waiting for?” O5-06 said, “Want me to carry your fat ass?”\n\nFades tasted copper and spat something scarlet on the ground. “I don’t care whose nose that is, I’m gonna hit you. Enough with the fucking bullshit.”\n\nO5-06’s smirk widened. “Yellow card.” Fades felt a chill and stiffened in spite of herself. “Oh, don’t be such a stereotype. I’ve never hit you.”\n\n\t“You just did.” Fades tried moving the arm O5-06 popped into place and kept her face steady as the arm bit back.\n\t\n“That was your husband.” O5-06 chuckled, “See? I can play with semantics as well.” Her voice resembled Shout’s in pitch and timbre-all the ways her trachea enforced-but her clipped speech, enunciated syllables, and recurring bouts of stifled laughter sounded as if someone was doing a camp parody of Shout. “That was medical necessity, not fun. And it’s never fun watching you hurt.”\n\n\t“What happened to my husband?” Fades said.\n\t\n\tFor the first time today, her hands shook.\n…\n\tShout woke to a splash of cold water. Where am I? He thought. He heard the boom and crash of a fierce wave crashing against rock. He heard the breaker thunder. As before, his sight was slow to return to him, but he felt something warm and soft pillow his head, and heard someone softly hum something just above his ears. \n\t\n\tIt was a note and pitch perfect rendition of the violin to Schubert’s Fantasia. He instinctively started humming the piano’s part. No amount of injury could completely kill the eager ivory-artist in him. He thought he heard the hummer slide a four beat chuckle in a whole rest, and he hummed slightly louder before his counterpart seamlessly rejoined on tempo. He felt more cold water land on his forehead, and as he felt the drops slide down his forehead and sting his eyes, the tar black fog melted away. He could see again.\n\t\n\tHis humming stopped. Cheeks streaked with crimson tears, face cowled by a rabbit’s severed head, deep gashes where eyes would normally be, O5-06’s beaming face loomed, and Shout realized his head was propped on her knees. She let her right hand rest on Shout’s forehead, and all at once her ghastly chimera stare felt more familiar and comforting than horrifying. O5-06’s hand cupped another splash of water-it seemed a small estuary had formed near them-and let it trickle on Shout’s forehead again. She hadn’t stopped smiling.\n\t\nShout's voice lost all of its weakness and got loud. “Where’s my wife?”\n\n“She’s safe.” O5-06 splashed his forehead again.\n\t\n“Ok, but where.”\n\n“Ontically, three inches from you. Ontologically, worlds away.”\n\n“What difference is that?”\n\nEven outdoors, he felt nervous about raising his voice about a whisper. He felt some fear towards aggravating O5-06, but he weirdly felt watched by others, even on the flat shadowless meadow next to the endless ocean. Something hid somewhere.\n\nO5-06 scratched his cheek with a long nail. “You grew up in a world with a clear delineation between ideas and material. Naturally, ideas would seem less real to you than the material. Your meaning of the world was built on facts about it. A stop sign has color, shape, location; a lover’s touch, an electric tickling rush of pleasure. You were in a cave. Those facts are but shadows. This,” She gestured around her, \"is what lies outside the cave, with nothing between you and the sun. Ontology is the fundamental definition of the world that gives it meaning. Now, your existence is both ontic-substance-and ontological-an aspect of that definition.”\n\n“I’m only interested in the world she’s in.”\n\n“Do you honestly expect me to believe that? And you can’t return just yet. You broke again, and I am putting you back together.”\n\n“Are you doubting I love her?”\n\n\"Perish the thought. I’m doubting you’re indifferent to other things.”\n\nO5-06 patted Shout’s cheek. \n\n“Now, on your feet. I’d love to talk, but I’d like you to humor me.”\n\nShout initially tried to lift his head from O5-06’s lap, but the moment the intention passed through his head, his body rose of its own accord and lifted him upright. He staggered backwards. He felt weightless, but the nausea from the whiplash was still very real.\n\nShout's body felt an unease and dysphoria that was beginning to fixate his mind. A single question asked a thousand times: What's happening to me? \n\nO5-06 seemingly bounced to her feet as though a rope pulled her there. She snapped her fingers, and a table covered with red cloth, an iridescent turquoise tea kettle, and twin white ivory cups and an alder wood sugar bowl popped into existence next to them. Shout saw her purse her lips. \n\n“Pity.\" She stamped her feet in mock outrage. \"Missed again.” \n\nShe snapped her fingers a second time, and two wicker wood seats with straight backs and fluffy checkered pillows joined the table. The seats were opposite each other. O5-06 walked towards the seat on the left, sat down, poured herself a cup and dropped six sugar cubes in the hot liquid. She looked at Shout and gestured towards the other seat.\n\n“How about a cuppa?”\n\n\t…\n\t\n\t“Mom, don’t play me. Where’s Shout?” Fades shoved O5-06 out of her face and got to her feet. “I’m done playing with you.” \n\t\n“Au contraire.” O5-06 let out another chuckle and walked with a skip to the kitchen. “You’re still trying too hard.” \n\nFades ignored O5-06 and tried to meditate on the anomalous cleanliness of the room, gauged the metaphysical implications. “That…furry friend…it doesn’t have fundamental ontology, does it?”\n“Getting warmer,” O5-06 walked over to the kitchen. Fades heard a clang and a slamming of cabinet doors. “I’m making tea. You still take yours black?”\n\n“Ye-what?” Fades did a double-take, “So furry friend can’t be named, consists entirely of attributes, looks goofy…are we talking…?” Fades tapped her foot thinking of how to finish that sentence, then brought two hands together, hooked her thumbs, and curled her fingers inward. O5-06 started laughing.\n\n“You even remembered the hand-sign workaround to refer to them! Been a while since I taught you that. Yes, correct. And so are you and your husband are also entities  no names. Well, almost. Those goofy-ass labels you keep calling each other are a care package from me. Consider it a belated wedding gift.” Her smile flickered for an instant. “The wedding you didn’t invite me to.” The kettle whined as steam squeezed its way out the spout.\n\n“Mom.” Fades said, “Please.”\n\n“That’s the spirit!” O5-06 touched the kettle, exhaled with a surprised “Ha,” and turned it off to stop the boil, “Not so hard after all. This is your first lesson in caring for your dying husband, by the way. Manners.” \n\n“Back up, Mom.” Fades suddenly felt numb. “Mom. Mom, what are you saying-” \n\nShe saw O5-06 carry on, seemingly paying her no mind, while her own lips tried to form words her brain stopped supplying her. O5-06 produced two coffee mugs, and placed them on the countertop where Shout and the furry friend had sat. She took the kettle and a sugar bowl and placed them between the cups, then filled both mugs with tea. She dropped six sugar cubes in her own mug, then sat in the stool where Shout had been. She pulled out a smart phone-she must have raided the apartment bedroom while Fades’ had been unconscious-dialed some numbers, and waited until a voice barked from the phone, “Who the fuck is this?”\n\n“Said I’d see you in hell, didn’t I?” O5-06 replied. “Guess who. Actually, don’t.”\n\n“Oh, fuck.”\n\nO5-06 counted fifteen seconds, “That should be enough to trace my current location. Contain the breach. No, don't bitch to me. It's just three Marine battalions. Now come and get us.” She hung up. Fades opened her mouth to yell at her.\n\n\tThen O5-06 slammed the phone onto the counter’s edge. She smashed it again, and again, and again, until the phone broke in half. Then she crushed the half into small pieces and threw them into the sink, then stomped on the other half repeatedly until it too was nothing but a plastic-silicone crumble. She adjusted the lapel of the open dress shirt like it was a suit, then sat in her stool again as though nothing had transpired. \n\t\nFades didn’t feel like talking anymore.\n\n“Oh Fades,” O5-06 yawned with a brief howl. Fades wanted to scream looking at her. She was still smiling. She smiled through all of it. She gestured at the other stool, and then indicated the tea setting with a flourish.\n\n “How about a game?”\n\n…\n\n\"Do you make a hobby of trying to intimidate your own reflection, Shout?\" O5-06 said. She had already taken a strong sip of her tea and smacked her lips with the taste. Shout tried not to confirm whether she was bleeding into the cup.\n\nShout was too tense to relax, and instead leaned against the back of his chair like the table was on fire, and knowing the nature of this place, he figured it could very well have been. He tried instead to waft the steam in the direction of his nose. \"It smells like lettuce. And almonds.\"\n\nO5-06 leaned across the table, bracing her elbows on its surface, and rested her chin on her palms. The seeping open wounds soaking through her mask glinted in the sunlight and seem to wink at him. The blood spilled from her face onto her palms and splashed onto the table cloth. Shout saw a few drops would only actually stain the cloth at a time before vanishing, as though making way for the next few. She wrinkled her lips in a jocular pout. \"Are you accusing me of trying to poison you?\"\n\nShout crossed his arms. \"The thought crosses my mind, yeah. You //are// the reason I agreed to this. You are the reason for all of it.\"\n\nO5-06 looked confused, and pointed at herself. \"Me? I was just a sacrifice.\" She traced a picture frame in the air with her finger around the grotesque mangle her face had become. \"You were presented with a choice. I was there to help you think about that choice. Nothing more.\"\n\n\"You pretended to be a therapist.\"\n\n\"To save the world. And you're no different, pretending to be ordinary.\"\n\n\"I'm not pretending to be anything. I'm me.\"\n\n \"You're a hero, Shout.\"\n\nHe felt weak and warm all of a sudden. He looked down at his feet, hoping O5-06 wouldn't notice what saying that did to him. \"What's the tea made of?\"\n\nO5-06 groaned and lay back in her chair. \"Stop screwing around and just drink already. Or was your dad right about you being delicate?\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\n\"Yellow card.\"\n\n...\n\n\"What are the table stakes.\" Fades asked.\n\n\"Your fingers.\"\n\n\"If I win, you relinquish your Name to Shout and never bother us again. What happens if I lose?\"\n\n\"Something novel.\" O5-06 crossed her legs and leaned on the counter, her bent elbow on the surface and her chin nestled in the palm of her hand. \"It won't kill or maim either of you, if that's what you're worried ab-\" As O5-06 spoke, Fades charged over to the silverware drawer and pulled out a knife.\n\n\"Fades...\" For the first time in a long while, Fades noticed O5-06's smile die. \"Maybe think for a...\"\n\nThen Fades stabbed her right hand with the knife, traced a triangle in her palm without so much as a twitch, slid the blade and drew a crimson line through her palm, then spun the bloody knife and offered it handle-first to O5-06. \"Well?\"\n\nO5-06 glared at Fades. \"You really hate me, don't you?\"\n\n\"I don't hate you,\" Fades said, \"I just want you gone.\"\n\nO5-06 took the knife and tore the shape into her own hand and then slammed the knife into the counter with such force that the blade sunk an inch into the rock. O5-06 turned to Fades.\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n...\n\n\"Game variants?\" Shout asked.\n\n\"For god's sakes, Shout, the tea isn't hexed.\" O5-06 shouted. \"Drink!\"\n\nShout took a brief sip. \"If this is poisoned, you've done a great job at making me want a lot of it.\"\n\n\"I get that a lot, Shout, \"O5-06 said, \"And to answer your question, when peers play it's some version of first to zero. When an elder is playing with a babe or a human, it is usually until the tea grows cold.\"\n\n\"So how exactly do you lose?\"\n\n\"They call it discourtesy. We call it taboo.\"\n\n...\n\nOn Fades carved up hand, the streams of blood spreading over her skin and pooling on the table hardened, then browned. Fades felt the sting of rose thorns piercing skin and blotted out the pain by focusing on the memory of the last time Shout's lips were on her neck. She saw the streaks of blood lift off the table and the rivers on her hands skitter towards her fingers like ants, then twirl around her fingers. Her wedding and engagement ring disappeared under the tangle. She looked at O5-06, where the same phenomena had occurred with her corresponding hand.\n\n\"Each breach will take a finger. If you are unable to pick up your tea cup with your dominant hand before the tea grows cold, you lose.\"\n\n\"Seemed to have ruled out me beating you before then.\"\n\nO5-06 scoffled and sat up straight in her seat. \"At least you inherited my sense of humor, bitch.\"\n\nFades slammed her fist onto the table, \"I-\"\n\nWhen Fades was six, and O5-06 was still a Site Director, her mother took to home-schooling her at work, often handling Foundation business in between lessons on what O5-06 considered the 'optimized curriculum'. One day, Fades saw her mother in a scary-looking discussion with the person who was the O5-06 at the time. She didn't know what they were talking about, but she saw the then O5-06 backhand her mother. Her mother seemed to laugh it off and walked back to the office. Fades had tried to ask her what was wrong, but her mother instead made a bee line for her bathroom, turning the water as hot as she could. She remembered the way the water roiled and steamed as it scoured her mother's hand, the blank look in her mother's gaze, the single tear passing down her cheek. Later, Fades had tried to do the same thing. Screaming, sobbing, Fades would not give up. Fades could not break. Her mother had told her nothing less would do to serve humanity. Her mother seemed so proud of her for lasting as long as she did.\n\nThe skin twisting agony of that scolding water was nothing compared to impaling, shredding, crushing maceration tearing her pinky to shreds as the lint-thin vines destroyed it. The blood and bone splattered on the table, but the mess only lingered a minute before vanishing. A single yelp left Fades lips until she bit her tongue and writhed in her seat. She struck her afflicted hand into the table again and again and again as though she could kill the pain with the blows.\n\n\"Breathe Fades,\" O5-06 whispered, \"Breathe. Just let it go.\"\n\n...\n\"Second cup already? The water is still so hot!\" O5-06 said. \"Is your tongue made of cobalt?\"\n\n\"I'm just really dehydrated, I think.\" Shout said. \"Haven't had anything to eat or drink in a day or two...\" O5-06 snapped her fingers again, and a plate of scones popped up with a rattle next to Shout. \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"So let's say they confront you and you are obligated to duel one of them. It will never take the form of an ambush. They will have something you want, or will threaten something you care for, or even fool you into thinking they want to chat over tea. Hey,\" She snapped her fingers in Shout's face. \"You listening to me? These are your new facts of life.\n\n\"Y-yeah,\" Shout said. He really wasn't. His eyes had drifted from the roiling sea they were facing to the emerald horizon stretching boundlessly behind them. He had given up on intimidating the six foot five inch grotesque with her tales of weaponized tea parties, and he instead looked for invisible doors, hidden walls, possible skyboxes. He had tried to look at O5-06's body language for weaknesses, a glass jaw, a bad leg, something, but that was Fades' bag, not his. His eyes drifted to his stump of a ring finger. Sometimes he wondered why Fades had walked away from her mother as completely as she did. No, not wondered. He understood immediately seeing her expression every time he asked about her that Fades was from a hell adjacent to the one she rescued him from. Part of him envied her, guiltily or not. He wanted to become a pianist, spent his childhood and adolescence chasing that dream, only for his dad to brutally extinguish that dream. It was not too late for him to change directions or even persist with his plan A, but his spirit and body felt useless to either that task or any other. He was clumsy and helpless. Fades was seemingly tailor made for war, both physically fit and mentally insurmountable. Intact, unflappable, and incapable of distraction or despair, she had a clear path to glory with her mother, and she chose him. He felt loved, but confused. Why would someone ditch a clear answer to the question of their purpose for the infinite mundanity she surely saw in him?\n\nFuck, Shout thought, this is the piece of shit Fades was running from, and I'm having tea with her.\n\n\"Do the math,\" Shout said, and filled his cup.\n\n\"You didn't finish your second c-\" O5-06 tried to say before Shout splashed her with the tea and threw himself over the table at her.\n...\n\n\"The good news is that the next finger is taken at random, so it's one in four odds. That's almost as good as Russian roulette...Fades, there isn't a literally a tempo but stone-walling is an impropriety.\"\n\nFades continued doodling an invisible heart and her and Shout's initials in the faux-marble counter, somehow feeling the blood and bone powder patina that should have covered it even though it had been whisked away. She wondered if it was a trauma response, magic, or shock. Could you suffer phantom viscera? Had she just discovered a new SCP?\n\n\"Very good. Reminder in case you're dissociating, any statement where I'm address you with anything ought be ignored. The tea is still rather hot, and I'd like this game to be somewhat competitive. Now, facts of life. Ask me a question.\"\n\n\"How were you able to address me as...with a swear word? I thought verbal injury triggered a breach.\"\n\n\"My dear Fades, you know better than anyone that 'bitch' means something entirely different to me than most. Do you think your husband considers you a bitch, in either sense of the word?\"\n\nScrape. Scrape. Scrape. Her finger squeezed the wood encasing it until flecks of dirt and particulate green matter traced the shape and the S and F, only for the mess to vanish seconds after appearing.\n\"I believe there is cake in the fridge.\" O5-06 said, \"ask me something more substantive, please.\"\n\n\"W-what...\" Fades bit her lip to stop its trembling, \"What's happening to...to...to him...?\"\n\n\"Exactly what happened to the rest of the [Fae]. We took his name. Ungrounded him.\" She pulled a plate of leftover Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake. \"How stale do you think this cake is by now? Or edible? Waste not,\" She slid the table onto the counter, and pulled the blood stained knife from the counter and stuck it into the cake. \"Want not. A good thing tangents aren't considered rude by [Fae] standards, eh? We ungrounded him, and found a way of protecting him from the narrative vaccuum...at least as long as he needed to change.\"\n\n\"Change into what?\"\n\n\"A weapon of mass destruction,\" O5-06 said, \"May I interest you in some cake?\"\n\nOh, fuck. Fades thought, staring at the molding loaf. \"I...\"\n\n...\n\nInitially, Shout's desperate lunge at O5-06 made him feel reckless, courageous, and stupid. He closed his eyes as his body crashed against O5-06 and the two crashed into the ground. He felt O5-06's body briefly slacken with the shock, and then felt it tense and before O5-06 could do anything more, Shout swung his head into the air and brought his forehead colliding at force until it plunged into a soft, squishy membrane and an explosion of blood and pink matter filled the air and covered Shout's vision.\n\nThen he felt the sensation of rushing bramble thickets and fluttering leaves and a lurch in his stomach, and he briefly wondered if O5-06 had thrown him into a tree before the fog of organic matter snapped taut and he felt something crush his chest tight, wrap around his neck, and yank him in the air in front of O5-06.\n\n\"Idiotically reckless,\" O5-06 said, \"but I like the fight in you. Tell me, were you always capable of something like this, or did Fades make you the man your father was convinced you weren't?\"\n\n\"T-th-that-,\" Shout gagged, \"That-\"\n\n\"Stop acting like you need air to breathe, Shout. Your lungs collapsed five minutes ago.\"\n\n\"That...\" Shout stopped trying to breathe and suddenly the words issued fluidly from his mouth, \"Fades never told me that you were this fucking TERFy.\"\n\n\"Cute,\" O5-06 said. \"Did she ever tell you she shot your father?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nAt that moment, Shout lost all sensation in one of his fingers.\n\n...\n\n\"Mmm...\" O5-06 chewed slowly and thoughtfully, \"This is an exquisite work of culinary terrorism. I don't think I've ever bit into anything this awful since Kabul in '03. Glad it's not my stomach it's ending up in, at least. So,\" O5-06 lifted her thumb to her mouth and bit the tip, \"What's it going to be then, eh?\"\n\nFades heard those words and then smelled melted butter and popcorn at the Somerville theater. Every Saturday, every week, from as far back as memory took her to as recently as four years ago, O5-06 would take Fades to the movies and they watch her favorites (and Fades favorites, but there was such an overlap in their tastes). Each time, she would let Fades choose, saying \"What's it going to be then, eh?\". Her stomach churned as the scent memory collided with the sour odor from the cake. O5-06 picked up the plate and lifted it towards Fades, the rubbery crust wriggling like gelatin with the movement.\n\nFades thought quickly-was this a physical gift since the cake was barely edible-in which case, she should accept it with both hands and then place in a deliberate way by her side to signify the gift was accepted and treasured. Or, was O5-06 taking a bite more than a taunt? Maybe the cake really was food. It's food, Fades thought. O5-06's toothy smugness with her husband's mouth tickled a nerve, she pulled the plate from O5-06's unresisting fingers, grabbed the handle of the knife stained with their blood.\n\nShe peeled a slice of cake and pulled it into her mouth. O5-06 grin disappeared.\n\n\"Whose kid are you?\" She asked, \"You //never// eat the food, babe!\" \n\nFades eyes widened as she realized the mistake she made out of spite. \"Mom-\"\n\nThis time Fades let herself scream. A pair of rings bounced a few times as they flew from the ruin of her hand.\n\n...\n\nShout hated violence. Confrontation and physical harm or threats of same could make his stomach roil and his lungs feel heavy and his ribs stiff. It was not cowardice, and the exception to this rule was when Fades was involved. He felt all kinds of partial towards hitting O5-06 with every appendage he had if she didn't show him proof his wife wasn't lying dead on that kitchen floor, or continued to keep him from helping her.\n\nO5-06 stood below the thorny cocoon she'd restrained Shout in. \"What'd I ever do to you?\" O5-06 asked. \"Nothing but answered your questions and offered you tea!\"\n\n\"How can you sit there and have a tea party when Fades could be...could be...\" Shout writhed, and with a scream that sounded like it was accompanied by a woodwind instrument, he ripped his left arm out of his confinement. To his horror, his ring finger was missing, and his engagement ring with it. A second later, the shredded vegetation and wood flying away from Shout's arm changed course and like converging bees on a shattered hive, slammed into his arm and bound it again. \"Where's Fades?\" He screamed, \"What's happening to us?\"\n\n\"Fades is playing a game,\" O5-06 said. \"A game that she agreed to. She is safe. She is losing nothing that she hadn't put on the table. And you are only losing what she won.\"\n\n\"What...you mean a duel? Who's she dueling?\"\n\n\"You. Me. The distinction is purely academic.\"\n\n...\n\nFades started sobbing into the ersatz marble, banging her head again and again into the flat space where her blood had yet again splashed before vanishing again. O5-06's face was twisted with rage and disgust. The smile was gone. Her shoulders were tensed, her hands were clenched into knuckle popping tight fists. Fades could feel the coiled energy of O5-06's posture and breathing. Her combat instincts plied her brain with intrusive thoughts of O5-06 leaping on the table and crashing into Fades to beat her skull in. Fades knew that would never happen. O5-06 would never let Fades win so big.\n\nDid she feel this way when Fades sent her the letter begging her to stay out of her life, Fades wondered? Fades kept sobbing, and softly small whispers mewled through trembling lips.\n\"What was that? What was that? Stop it!\" O5-06 slammed the table. \"Stop your fucking pity party or I'll...I...\"\n\n\"Mom,\" Fades said, \"Please, please...stop hurting me, please-\"\n\n\"What did I tell you about begging? What did I tell you about begging you weak, sniveling, manipulative-\" O5-06 stopped as the quick snap and crunch of O5-06's left ring finger cut her off, the price of dignifying the name 'Mom' with a response. Fades sobbing stopped instantly, but her chest continued its ragged and rapid double breaths and fits and her breathing grew high pitched and staccato.\n\nO5-06 mouth was still frozen in surprise, her eyes locked where her finger used to be. Fades found the look on O5-06's face so funny. She was surprised, Fades thought, the arrogant, vicious, superior, needy piece of shit was surprised. Fades had done it. Her manic breathing finally gave up the pretense and Fades lifted her head and leaned back on her chair and laughed and laughed and laughed.\n\n...\n\n\"She wagered her fingers against my fingers-which is to say, your fingers. How do you feel about that?\" O5-06 tightened her fist and the cocoon tightened around Shout's body, and he screamed.\n\n \"She thought it was worth it to see me gone. Me, who has saved you so many times, who has saved both of you so many times. I'm your-\"\n\n\"Stop wasting your breath, O5-06, she could have shot me in the head and I'd go to hell to keep it from the angels.\" Shout felt something about the wood wrapping his arm grow strangely fluid, and he began to feel a prickling sensation along his skin, a breathing sensation, a healthy sensation.\n\n\"Do you know what happens when she loses?\"\n\n\"Just means next time we flip you off we'll get creative.\"\n\n...\n\nFades' keening laughter wailed and hooped and yelled. She cried genuine tears now, just from the sheer amusement she felt at triggering O5-06 by pretending to cry. Of course those weren't real tears earlier, of course the weeping was perfectly simulated. The last and possibly only time Fades remembered crying was at her wedding to Shout. Even then, she wasn't sure why she had.\n\nO5-06 slowly smiled as Fades looked at her and said \"You dumb //bitch//,\" Fades said, \"You really couldn't just sit there and watch me cry? Big bad mama sadist over here gets triggered watching a grown woman cry. The irony! The //motherfucking// irony!\" O5-06 burst out laughing too, then pushed herself out of her chair and walked over to Fades. She reached behind Fades' neck and touched Fades forehead to hers, and the two manically laughed while staring at each other, while O5-06's hand wrapped around Fades' two remaining fingers, while the tea in the electric kettle steamed with patient heat.\n\nO5-06 said, \"You went out good, sweetheart.\"\n\nShe grit her teeth, and Fades crumpled to the ground, limp and forfeit. The blood lingered this time.\n\n\n\n...\n\nShout felt the cocoon give way and he collided with the earth noiselessly, though not painlessly. His legs felt rubbery all of a sudden, and shooting pains crawled up and down his arms and his feet.\n\"The game is up.\" O5-06 said, \"Fades forfeit...as did you, after a fashion.\"\n\n\"Fades? Give up?\" Shout laughed and spat, \"Get the fuck out of here.\"\n\n\"Well, it was not entirely her choice. And technically, it won't just be her paying a price for it. Although I can't really call it a price if it's something I need to have happen. On a related note, Shout,\" O5-06 walked over and touched Shout's shoulder, \"I'd clench my teeth for the next five seconds if I were you.\"\n\nShout wanted to argue with O5-06, but that part of him that was all too receptive to those standing over him cajoled him into listening. He clenched his teeth together, hating himself for his submission.\n\nSince his father had shot his finger off, Shout retained a private, personal metric for suffering, and would privately tell himself //at least it's not that bad// to muffle future blows to his body and heart. Fades hated when he'd do this, had always told him, \"You are worth the mess you make, don't ever think otherwise.\" Yet Fades //never// cried, ever. How could he let that standard down?\n\nAnd ever since his father had shot his finger off, he had never felt pain like what now consumed the part of his body that used to be his hand before what looked like a fist sized wedge of thorns and branches tore its way out and shredded the limb into chunks of sap, blood and bone. Shout screamed until his throat hurt. O5-06 sat next to him and grabbed his other hand. Shout initially resisted her, but soon his hand folded in hers and held it tight.\n\n\"Breathe, Shout.\" O5-06 said, \"Just breathe. Just let it go. Let it go.\"\n\n...\n\n//The last time O5-06 carried her, Fades had been twelve years old.//\n\nO5-06 was months from formally ascending to O5 status, after her predecessor's body was found distributed throughout the city of Boston. Fades herself was proud of her. O5-06 asked her if she wanted the same for herself, and Fades couldn't imagine saying no to such an opportunity. Fades said yes when O5-06 asked if she wanted to accompany her to 'the more secret layers of her work'. When she had a meeting announcing that Fades would be her special helper, Fades noticed something a little forced about the smiles, and something a little synchronized about the clapping.\n\nAt one point, Fades made a friend among the orange shirted ones who did the risky work with the actual testing of the anomalies. Her name was Samantha. It was dangerous stuff, and occasionally they would get hurt or killed, but O5-06 explained that they had done very bad things on the other side and they were earning a second chance, redeeming themselves through either toil or blood. Samantha wouldn't tell her her last name because, no offense, she didn't want to see any of them ever again.\n\nFades liked her style, that Samantha had killed her husband in cold blood was trivia.\n\nWhen Fades found out what was actually going to happen to Samantha and her cell mates, Fades ran over to their cell to warn them. Fades knew damn well the gesture was meaningless, but she felt if she were in that situation, she'd rather look her destiny in the eyes and retain some dignity than cling to hope like a lamb led to slaughter.\n\nBy the time Fades made it to the cell, O5-06 was already there, having just told one of her many, many jokes and had the whole cell up in hysterics. O5-06 invited her to join them, and asked who wanted a smoke. Of course everyone said yes, and O5-06 passed out cigarettes to everyone, lighting them with their own personal lighter. She asked Fades if she wanted one. When Fades shook her head, she asked Fades what was on her mind.\n\n\"I...I...uh...\" Fades stammered.\n\nO5-06 shook her head, \"I didn't raise a coward. Spit it out.\"\n\nFades shook her head.\n\n\"Fades,\" O5-06's voice sounded like iron suddenly, and a few of the prisoners stepped back from them, \"Are you really that mundane?\"\n\nFades remembered those oft-repeated words hit her like a slap, grit her teeth and said \"Samantha, they're going to wipe your minds in three weeks. You've probably been here for months by now. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!\"\n\nO5-06 giggled, \"Crazy, right? What do you think of that, Samantha?\"\n\nSamantha sighed, \"Not gonna lie, boss, your daughter tells all sorts of crazy stories. It's really helped pass the time around here. Don't believe one in ten of them, but I like the novelty, I guess.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course.\" O5-06 said. She turned her head and looked at Fades. \n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\nFades, confused, was about to ask \"Ready for what-\" when she heard six loud pops damn near burst her eardrums, a soft clinging, and then Samantha and her six cell mates collapsed to the floor. She looked up at her mother, who had already ejected the magazine on her side-arm and was pulling a fresh one from her pocket and popping it into the gun. She pulled the slide back on the pistol to load a fresh round into the chamber. Samantha moaned and heaved what sounded like something between a sigh and a cow's moo before O5-06 shot her again and the noise stopped. O5-06 did some more things, then holstered her pistol. She turned around and looked at Fades.\n\nFades heard herself say \"If you're gonna tell me some bullshit about how I actually killed those people, Mom, spare me.\" Her ears hurts and her own voice sounded muffled. She felt O5-06's move to her neck, and two fingers gently press against the vein there.\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" O5-06 sounded excited and out of breath, like she were a normal parent and Fades had just gotten the honor roll or gotten into the varsity sports team, \"Heart-rate's within the standard deviation, your hands aren't shaking at all, and //goodness// you're a smiler just like me! Where //did// you get your sangfroid from, girl?\" She playfully tapped the shoulder of Fades, \"Oh there it is! Shock's worn off. Breathe! Breathe girl!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Her lips felt numb. All number of impassioned speeches about Samantha's life or murder being wrong or whatever all flushed away by the beaming toothy glee on her mother's face.\n\n\"Shhh...\" O5-06 said, \"now yes, this is gonna be a bit of housecleaning for me, but...twelve years old and //so// unflappable! Girl, what //was// the lion in your closet all your life that made you have to get this hard?\"\n\nFades said the same thing she always said whenever O5-06 asked her that question, \"You.\" Fades felt like sitting down all of a sudden.\n\n\"And you're my sweet savage cub-shh, breathe, just let it go...let it go...ooop //there// it goes!\" Fades vision blurred and she felt dizzy, and then next felt O5-06's strong arms on her back. She'd passed out and O5-06 had caught her. Fades felt weightless cradled in O5-06's arms, like a bundled jacket. Part of Fades felt like screaming or striking O5-06 or anything, but she felt overpoweringly safe just being the way she was then. \n\nFades face was inches from Samantha's head, and she almost touched her hair when she felt herself lifted away, leaving the bodies and the floor of the room behind. O5-06 stood to her full six feet five inches of height and carried her away. Fades looked behind them and saw black visored security officers rush to the cell, acting like the two them weren't there.\n\n\"Where do you want to go tonight, chickadee?\" O5-06 said, \"The Ritz? Harvey's? McDonald's? Trust, you'll be ravenous soon enough.\n\n...\n\nWhen she came to, Fades recognized from the pattern and luminescence of the light fixtures that she was in a Foundation infirmary. She moved each of her limbs to make sure she was still mobile, still intact. Other than a weird ticklish sensation in her left hand, everything seemed present and accounted for.\n\nIncluding her fingers. \n\nThat math didn't quite work, she thought. She tensed each of the fingers she had and counted to ten. She lifted both hands in front of her eyes and counted them. Still ten. Her eyes widened with shock and horror.\n\nHer rings were missing.\n\nRight then and there, she was ready to kill someone. She wanted to scream, and find someone she could maim until they could unfuck that problem. She was ready to hijack a car, drive it back down to the apartment and ransack it until she got those rings back. She wanted to find Shout and tell him that she'd get those rings back or die trying. He'd probably tell her it was all alright, that the rings were just accessories, and she'd probably nod while quietly figuring out who she had to harm to get a ride back to the university. Her-\n\nHer left hand did not have skin. Or veins. It was white as bone, with three arrows in a triangle on the palm. She had ten fingers, but only five she was born with. She had two hands, but one was a Foundation prototype. All she cared about was that the ring finger on the new hand was now too big for the rings she'd worn, uninterrupted, since the moment Shout had given them to her.\n\nShe heard an EKG flatline in the bed next to hers.\n\n...\n\nShout awoke to the sound of a pleasant keening from a nearby device. He lay on a hospital table surrounded by tall figures with gas-masks and bloody knives. He heard the sound of a struggle in the background and a wild and savage voice roar “LET GO OF ME!” to captors. He heard something expensive crash into the ground and scatter clanging components on the cement floor. He heard the voice again, realizing it was Fades’, “LET ME SEE HIM-” \n\nHe heard someone grunt as though the wind left their lungs and then one of the figures just behind him was jerked backwards, seemed to crumple at an angle as though someone slammed their foot perpendicular to their knee, and then was thrown to the floor. Fades appeared in his place, and her eyes shifted from wild to weak when she saw him alert and staring at her. The hood of her shirt was ripped off, her neck had a thick friction burn as though someone had tried to put her in a headlock, and her wrists were bruised. Fades was only one hundred twenty pounds soaking wet. Shout gave up doing the math; few people knew what Fades was capable of when she decided something was going to happen. \n\nThe only sound for a while was the EKG insisting that Shout’s heart had stopped. \n\nShout reached forward to touch Fades' hand when he noticed that his stumpy ring finger-and the ring with it-was gone. \n\nHe gasped and closed his eyes, and prayed like hell the mirage in front of him would vanish when they opened. It didn't. \n\nInstead he saw a digit like all the other ones-bits of tree that somewhat resembled human fingers and shared their length and dexterity, but also looked inhuman. The rest of his hand similarly looked as though it had been carved from a mossy tree, with bark-like texture and a sound like snapping twigs as his joints moved. The mouth of Fades lingered open and wordlessly, she took his hand and laced her fingers through his.\n\nTo his shock, her fingers were pearlescent, the nails a cold titanium white. He pulled her closer to him and saw her entire dark brown hand had been replaced by some mechanical prosthetic. \n\nFades hands grabbed Shout’s face and was about to lean down to kiss him, and Shout about to rise to kiss her, and then she stiffened, and he confusingly searched her eyes, startled, new-moon dilated eyes, for what he saw there. He didn't have to search for long.\n\n\"Shout...\" She covered her mouth with her hands, \"...you look so much like her.\"\n\n[!--\nShout had a sinking feeling in his stomach.\n\n“What…what did I tell you…” His tongue suddenly felt uncooperative.\n\n“Enough.” Fades said. Her voice had instantly diminished to a slender monotone. “What I needed to hear.”\n\n“What did she tell you?” \n\n“Enough.” Fades said. “Are you okay?” She turned to one of the figures in gas masks. “Is he okay?” The figures remained motionless. “I’m talking. Is he okay?”\n\n“Am I okay?!” Shout asked.\n\n“We don’t know.” Someone finally said.\n\n“He’s okay” O5-06 said. “Now stop complaining, you stupid girl.”\n\nShout spent the rest of the day trying to talk to Fades, but Fades would often deflect or demure. “I’m sorry, my brain is just not there today, and I can’t afford to fuck up. Not with you. We can talk tomorrow, hon-” She punched the door to their room, and took a deep breath, “We can talk tomorrow. Good night.”\n\n“I…Fades, please..” Shout said. He felt desolate, cold, lonely. He reached out to hug her, but she neatly weaved out of his way. She slid under their bedcovers, curled up at the far side of the bed, facing the wall.\n\n“Fades…” he said, feeling wretched. He wanted to feel rage or betrayal at that moment, but tried to see the bright side of things. Fades was doing this to keep him alive. Perhaps this was still love, just another, darker, colder form of it.\n\nShout climbed into bed, but didn’t bother trying to get under the covers. He slept hugging the edge of the bed facing the room. He tried falling asleep facing Fades’ back, but soon turned away from her.\n--]",
