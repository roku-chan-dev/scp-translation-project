No personnel are permitted onto the stage or near SCP-4355.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4355 is a humanoid entity seated in the center of the performance stage of the Rachimi Memorial Concert Hall, located in Los Angeles, USA. SCP-4355 wears a black tuxedo, white gloves, and a tie. Since its discovery, SCP-4355 has neither moved nor responded to any stimuli. SCP-4355's face is only possible to view directly — photographs or drawings result in anomalous distortions. Viewers have universally described its face as \"attractive\", but fail to provide any further detail.\n\nIndividuals who come within ten meters of SCP-4355 are subject to a complex memetic phenomenon. Those affected collapse to the ground before slowly crawling away from SCP-4355. Afterwards, any such individuals will only be able to focus on conversations about an unidentified individual, who is most often described as \"the most important acting phenom of the twenty-first century\". If conversation on another topic is initiated, they will invariably attempt to bring up the individual. Focused amnestic therapy has proved effective in reversing this phenomenon.\n\nIt is currently theorized that an anomalous event occurred in the Rachimi Memorial Concert Hall which resulted in the creation of SCP-4355. Due to the lack of records mentioning the Hall and general lack of public awareness of its existence, this event is believed to be under the effect of an antimemetic anomaly.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 4355.1\n+++ {{CCTV RECORDING}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n> During initial exploration, the security room of the hall was discovered in a state of disarray, with extreme heat damage across the walls and floor. The computer system was similarly damaged, with only the currently recording drive able to be salvaged. The drive contained a file, transcript attached. This video appears to be from a CCTV camera recording the main stage during SCP-4355. No audio is available.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **[BEGIN TRACK]**\n----\n\n**00:15:** A man in a tuxedo walks onto the stage as the lights dim. The audience is seen applauding.\n\n**00:23:** The man takes position in front of the mic, and removes an envelope from his breast pocket. He coughs into his hand before speaking into the microphone. \n\n**00:34:** The audience is seen roaring in laughter for several seconds.\n\n**00:40:** The man continues speaking before gesturing to the screen behind him, which begins playing an award nomination reel. Despite being portrayed as well-known actors and actresses, none of the individuals on screen have been identified by researchers or Foundation databases.\n\n**01:37:** The reel suddenly cuts to black. The man and audience are visibly confused.\n\n**02:13:** The lights in the theater begin to flicker. Through the intermittent light, the audience is visibly panicking, with several individuals leaving their seats and moving toward the exits. The man on stage is attempting to calm them, to little success.\n\n**03:51:** The power returns temporarily. Several individuals are crowded around each exit attempting to open the doors, which appear to be barred from the other side. Hysteria rapidly spreads through the crowd, with several individuals visibly panicked. Of note, the individuals screaming are in close proximity to the stage, which is distorted by a hazy glow.\n\n**04:05:** All screaming individuals collapse to the ground. Once again, the power cuts out.\n\n**04:13:** The darkness is broken by a massive corona of light on the stage, around a dark, spherical void. It casts light across the theater, temporarily distracting everyone. After two seconds, the man on stage who is closest to the circle is pulled in as if in a vacuum. Within seconds, all individuals in the theater are being drawn in towards the dark circle, several clutching onto chairs or other inanimate objects. Notably, no inanimate objects are drawn towards the circle. \n\n**04:29:** Over the course of the next one minute and twenty-four seconds, every individual in the theater is sucked into the circle. As more people are drawn in, the corona of light increases in intensity, until it is obscuring the lens of the camera.\n\n**05:53:** The camera lens has been damaged by overexposure, and only a portion of the screen is clearly visible. The light in this area rapidly lessens, indicating the corona is disappearing. The theater returns to darkness. No further activity is recorded.\n----\n\n= **[END OF TRACK]**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 4355.2\n+++ {{INVESTIGATION}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n> Within two months of the discovery of SCP-4355, a suspected probabilistic anomaly came to Foundation attention. Homes in high-income neighborhoods in the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills region were being discovered empty and unowned in abnormally high densities. Investigation revealed local banks were inspecting properties they had offered mortgages on, only to discover the homes were not legally owned by anyone, despite displaying signs of being lived in.\n\n> Among the homes identified as part of this pattern was a small 52 m^^2^^ studio apartment, notable due to its contrast from the other homes in the pattern. It was sparsely furnished with only basic necessities. Several documents were found in the apartment, presumably belonging to the previous owner. Notably, distortions were found on all documents, obscuring the recipient's name.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\nTo [[span class=\"antimeme\"]]Victor S.

I'm not sure what happened.\n\n**TRAVIS:** You must've gotten dehydrated and passed out. You'll be fine. \n\n**D-19873:** Mhm, probably. Still, worth it for a chance to meet //him.//\n\n**TRAVIS:** Who's him?\n\n**D-19873:** Only the greatest acting phenom of the 21st century! He's //stunning.// Like, some people just have that aura around them, y'know?\n\n**TRAVIS:** Right. Tell me more about this person. Where did you first notice their work?\n\n**D-19873:** God, I couldn't tell you. He's been in like... everything. Every hit movie I can think of in the past couple of years. 'Course, they were probably hits //because// he was in 'em, but whatever. \n\n**TRAVIS:** Mhm. An-\n\n**D-19873:** Some people are just born for a creative life, I think. Your Kubricks, your Welles, those kinds of folks. He's one of them. Just an absolute star at everything he does. \n\n**TRAVIS:** So, what did you say this person's name was?\n\n**D-19873:** Um... oh god. I have it.
