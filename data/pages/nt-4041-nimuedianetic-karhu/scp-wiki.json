Both //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// and its inhabitants are subject to a nomenclative phenomenon that makes repeated use of any kind of name, title or designation impossible without suffering some kind of nomenclative retribution. For thaumaturgic purposes, anything inflicted with this phenomenon has no \"True Name\". //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// can either be entered through a portal, currently monitored by Foundation Site-118, or with an invitation.\n\n//[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// was originally part of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subject's[[/span]]// ontological legal system or the \"[[[cycle-of-seasons-hub|Cycle of Seasons]]]\". This cycle consists of four courts:\n* The Summer Court, which handles all matters of abiding existence. Its location and status are currently unknown.\n* {{[[[SCP-6401 |ERROR: FIELD CAN'T BE NULL]]]}}\n* [[[they-had-names |The Winter Court]]], which handles matters of non-existence or anything close to it. The Court itself is, for the most part, superimposed over our world and can only be entered under specific conditions\n* //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// was the ground used for the Court concerning anything on the uprise or becoming more.\n\n//[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// was not able to function as a court anymore after an event reduced the population of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// by approximately 98%. This event is often referred to as the [[[ralliston-s-proposal |Third Great Diaspora]]]. It is to note that the Coalition as the human upholder of the Arthurian Charter has no knowledge about any participants of this event.\n\nWithout most of its Court functions //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// turned into a haven for //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// without Name. The exact dynamic of this system is unknown, but the presence of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subject's Tormenter[[/span]]//, commonly known as \"##red|Queen Mab##\" made a return to normal function impossible. It is however known that //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subject's Tormenter[[/span]]// was at no point considered the ruler of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]//.\n\nHowever, in September of 2003 her presence [[[the-lands-nobody-returns-from |vanished almost completely]]] from //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]//, making a return to the seasonal Court system possible. As of this point, the ruling position remains vacant, but several parties have made their claim to the crown and are currently in conflict over deciding the new ruler.\n\n\n[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]\n\nAs per the [[[goc-tale-sequence-assessment |Arthurian Charter]]] //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// can never pose a threat to upholding the first, second or third Mission, as long as the Coalition upholds the Charter as well on part of humanity. Since the Third Great Diaspora, //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady[[/span]]// is the only confirmed Upholder left on the other side. It is therefore unlikely that the Charter will fail as long as the Coalition exists. Therefore no other Engagement with //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// is to be considered other than that outlined in the charter.\n\n//[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// should, if possible, not be engaged with at all.\n\n> **Rules of Referral:**\n>\n> The Arthurian charter graciously provides protection from phenomena that would be hazardous to name by permitting the Coalition to extend //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's[[/span]]// name. Any phenomena related to //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// must only be referred to  by GOC operatives in a way related to //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady[[/span]]//. Any new designation created in this way must then be brought before //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady[[/span]]// for confirmation. //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady[[/span]]// is free to deny the designation in favour of another of her own choosing.\n>\n> For the purpose of clarity, the names of some entities have been added to this entry by outside parties with special access. These names are provided in ##red|red## and should not be used by the GOC operatives.\n>\n> It is noted that only GOC operatives are allowed to use these naming conventions and that they should be avoided when talking to civilians of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]//  as they might show negative reactions when being put into relation to //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady[[/span]]//. In cases where the naming conventions aren't suitable, nameless entities should instead be paraphrased.\n\nFor ease of referral, the Coalition has started a database outlining the relationships between all of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]//. GOC Operatives may engage with //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// for the purpose of completing this database. This is deemed acceptable behaviour by the Arthurian Charter.\n\nHowever, as //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// are and always will only be a non-threat, the Coalition can and will not intervene or observe any conflict, neither internal nor with Outside-Organizations like the Foundation, of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]//.\n\n----\n\n+ PSYCHE RECORDS\n\n||~ Paragroup Evaluation||\n\n __**Ambassador:**__ Charlie Goodwind\n \n __**Overview:**__  Information of all major contestants for the position of the Climbing Monarch has been obtained.

Other sources about the function of the courts suggest that it would be impossible for any member of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's pitiful Deniers[[/span]]//  to become the Climbing Monarch as this would maintain the status quo, a state that is antithetical to //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Thorn[[/span]]// when functioning as a seasonal court.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Designations:** //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Refuge[[/span]]//, commonly known as \"##red|The Wild Hunt##\"\n\n**Description:** A group consisting of //[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular'\"]]Her Lady's Subjects[[/span]]// and/or Type-Cyan[[footnote]] Spectral Entities.[[/footnote]] entities.

She climbed and climbed, but she never got closer to the top. After a time she reached a plateau. On the plateau sat a bear surrounded by honey.\n\nThe Fool asked the bear: \"How do I reach the crown?\"\n\nOn that, the bear laughed. \"You are truly a Fool. Why would you want to reach the crown? It is windy and unpleasant up ahead. Just stay here where there is honey.\"\n\nThe Fool didn't listen and made herself a coat to withstand the wind and continued climbing. Still, she couldn't reach the top. After a time she reached a cave carved into the tree. In the cave sat a woodpecker pecking at the tree.\n\nThe Fool asked the woodpecker: \"How do I reach the crown?\"\n\nOn that, the woodpecker answered: \"Hack away at the tree until everything falls down.\"\n\n\"But the crown will break if it falls so far.\" said the Fool.\n\n\"You are a Fool. How else could you reach the crown? There are hornets up ahead and they all want it too\" came the woodpecker's answer.\n\nThe Fool didn't listen and made herself a cap to keep the hornets from stinging her head and continued climbing. Still, the crown was as far away as at the start. After a time the squirrel caught up to the Fool.\n\n\"You lied to me. I can't reach the crown by climbing.\" said the Fool.\n\n\"Oh, but you have already.\" answered the squirrel. \"Is that not a ruler's mantle around your shoulders?
