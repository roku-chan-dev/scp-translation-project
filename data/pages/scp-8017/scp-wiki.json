The device is to be powered by solar panels and a nearby generator. The computer is to be kept powered on at all times, though measures for remote shutdown are in place. \n\nTwo armed guards are to be stationed outside the containment chamber of SCP-8017 at all times. No personnel above D-class are allowed to directly enter the containment chamber and access SCP-8017. Any maintenance to the computer’s hardware and software are to be carried out by D-class personnel under strict, remote supervision. Any interaction with SCP-8017-A by other staff is to be conducted indirectly via streaming SCP-8017 to the adjacent research office. The time allotted to testing will be at the discretion of the lead researcher. Insistence to interact with SCP-8017 past the allotted time will require the removal of the D-class personnel from the testing chamber, and remote shutting down of the computer.\n\nFoundation web crawlers are to monitor the Internet for any copies of SCP-8017 or potential SCP-8017-A instances. In case of discovery, all copies of SCP-8017 are to be destroyed and individuals exposed to the object are to be provided amnestics according to their degree of exposure.\n\nSCP-8017-B-1 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber. Amenities are to be --provided based on the discretion of the lead researcher-- completely denied until substantial information can be gleaned from it.\n\n**Description:**\nSCP-8017 is the collective designation given to an action role-playing game titled \"Hello, Traveller!\" and its game engine, KAI-1. The gameplay elements and story follow the tropes of many other action RPGs, where the player explores the world, interacts with NPCs, completes quests, and upgrades their character through a level progression system. It appears, however, that all NPCs within the game have sapience, and are aware that they reside within a video game. They are also aware of the existence of a ‘real world' outside the video game.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=KAI-1.PNG\n| caption=KAI-1 logo seen during SCP-8017 boot up\n| width=1000px\n| align=center]]\n\nSCP-8017 was discovered by the police in an apartment in Malmö, Sweden. The tenant, identified as 23-year-old Andreas \"Andy\" Martinsson was found dead in front of an unplugged desktop PC. An autopsy revealed the C.O.D. was cardiac arrest. It was noted that his brain showed damage consistent with extreme stress and fear suffered during or previous to his death.\n\nAround his apartment were concept designs for games and printed articles detailing major successes in the video games industry. It was learned that Andy was an indie game developer and, according to recovered notes, \"Hello, Traveller!\" was his creation. It had also been discovered that all individuals closely related to Andy had perished approximately 2 hours before his death; a total of 17 people across Sweden were killed. Causes of death were either from gunshot wounds, trauma from sharp and blunt objects, or wounds akin to those in animal attacks.\n\nTo be noted was that Martinsson's phone was found destroyed in his microwave, so it and the CPU were taken as evidence by the Swedish police. Following an incident regarding seeing ghosts in the game, the CPU was later confiscated by the Foundation.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The Martinsson Killings Investigation.\" hide=\"- The Martinsson Killings Investigation.\"]]\n\nThe following are the preliminary experiment logs of SCP-8017 upon securement:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n**Experiment Log 1**\n\n**Date:** 27/07/2011\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8017\n\n**Team Lead:** Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n**Team Members:** Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81789\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Alright D-class, please start up the game.\n\n**D-81789:** Got it.\n\n//(Upon clicking on the game, a spinning blue circle appears on the cursor before the screen turns black. Seconds later, the logo appears, reading \"KAI-1 game engine.\")//\n\n**D-81789:** Hmmm, never heard of this engine before.\n\n//(Seconds later, a main menu screen appears with the title \"Hello, Traveller!\" with several options present. Ambient music is heard in the background.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Okay, quick boot up. Could mean good things. The background’s a bit low resolution though… \n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Your commentary isn’t necessary. Select 'new game'.  \n\n**D-81789:** Yeah, yeah, you’re a jackbooted thug with a huge dick. I get it.\n\n//(Upon clicking the new game option, a scroll of text describes how a demon king was threatening the land of Skáneland, and a chosen one was selected by the clergy to seek out the evil and slay it.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Wow, how original.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Again your-\n\n**D-81789:** Okay, look pal. You specifically got me out of lockup because I used to be good at these things okay? I can pick the options you want, but I have a process here and I don’t think your fancy degree was in game design, now was it?\n\n//(Dr. Janowski doesn’t respond. The player character is jolted awake and finds himself looking up at a cloudy sky near the wreckage of a cart. He gets up and sees a sign with the words \"Westwood\" pointing down a road to his right. The player walks down the road, cresting a hill when a town appears on the horizon. Walking to the town, several townsfolk are seen performing various activities. They consist of characters dressed according to the norms of 1500s Sweden.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Okay, we're starting. I have to say these graphics are pretty good. It runs smooth as well!\n\n//(The player walks around and loots a few containers before entering Westwood. The character approaches the town entrance. A young man in a golden brown tunic runs up to the player.)//\n\n**NPC:** Hello there, traveller! And welcome to the town of Westwood! My name is Martin and I was told to expect you. Your quest to battle the demon lord will be a long one and you will need a squire. I shall provide you with this service![[footnote]] Only text is displayed, with audible dialogue being gibberish.[[/footnote]]\n\n**D-81789:** Awkward phrasing, but sure.\n\n**Martin:** To begin, I shall need to hear of your exploits! Tell me, before you were sent to our fair kingdom, what was your life like?\n\n//(Options appear on the screen.)//\n> 1. A mage, seeker of mysterious arcane truths.\n> 2. A warrior, sent to defend the world from unknowable perils\n> 3. A priest, here to revive worship of the old gods who call this land home.\n> 4. A prisoner, forced to come here by those who view you as expendable.\n\n**D-81789:** … Heh! Hey Doc, that last one ring any bells for you?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Select option two.\n\n**Stenmark:** Uh, Sir. What if there's a connection between-\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Select option two, D-class.\n\n**D-81789:** Right.\n\n//(D-81789 selects Option 2.)//\n\n**Martin:** Splendid! There are many here in these lands who require protection. Now, how do you feel about them?\n\n//(Options appear on the screen.)//\n> 1. They are people who deserve protection like anyone else.\n> 2. They are lost and must be taught a better way.\n> 3. They are monsters who must be destroyed.\n> 4. They are strange folk who must be hidden away.\n\n**D-81789:** Uh… Doc?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:**  Select option one.\n\n**D-81789:** Okay, yeah… That makes sense.\n\n//(D-81789 selects Option 1. Character creation continues like this for some time.)//\n\n**Martin:** You seem like a worthy candidate, fine warrior. But first, we must test your skills. Go see Old Man Jenkinson. He is an elder in these parts. Used to be a soldier for the Coalition, and a great and noble warrior. Now he grows potatoes. But he'll surely be able to prepare you for our quest to save these lands. Wish you luck, Traveller. I'll see you around!\n\n//(Martin runs off into the crowd and the player explores the town where he encounters several shop keepers, town guards, and even a group of small children playing. He engages in conversations with a number of them, who provide lengthy exposition on the lore of the world and what they do.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Man, this is a lot of dialogue.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Just continue, the more information the better.\n\n//(The following gameplay revolves around meeting Old Man Jenkinson, further learning about in-game lore, and going through what appears to be the tutorial section for the game in the form of training. Descriptions of these details have been cut for brevity.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** D-class, once you finish training, begin the first quest. //(To Stenmark off-microphone.)// Jack, could you get us some coffee, please?\n\n**Stenmark:** Yes, Sir.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Angie, any unusual activity?\n\n**Hultgren:** Nothing so far.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Hmmph.\n\n//(The following gameplay has the player completing quests, selling items to vendors, fighting enemy NPCs and mobs. This goes on for three hours.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(Mutters.)// You sure this was the anomaly in the case? Looks like a dud. //(Into the mic)// D-class, anything of note so far?\n\n**D-81789:** We'll it's quite fun, I'd say. A very well-polished game, though it does follow all the standard tropes of an RPG-\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** I meant anything anomalous.\n\n**D-81789:** Yeah I was getting to that, you prick. Nothing's going on here.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(Pause.)// Do mind your language. Continue playing.\n\n//(Another hour passes. The player character, now at Level 12, is returning to Westwood to complete a quest from an NPC. When entering the chambers of the character- a cow farmer- the NPC is found in a completely different position.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Sir, look!\n\n**D-81789:** Oooh, finally. Something weird for you.\n\n//(The cow farmer is standing erect with his arms outstretched to his sides. His body is partially phased into his bed.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(Sighs.)// No, that's just him T-posing. Was expecting that somewhere. Keep looking.\n\n**D-81789:** But I can't complete the quest. He's bugging out.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Then restart the game or something!\n\n//(D-81789 does so, which fixes the glitch. Further gameplay continues for 3 hours from this point.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** Sir, I think this is just a normal game.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Maybe... But we need something. //(Into the mic)// D-class, anything so far.\n\n**D-81789:** Boss, can I rest now? I'm tired.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Yes, D-class. After we find something of use. You may take a water break.\n\n**D-81789:** Fine.\n\n//(Another four hours of gameplay elapses. The player character has just finished another quest and is returning home with the loot. Upon entering the house, an NPC is seen spotting the player and leaping through the wall.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Woah! Who the fuck are you?!\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** What's happening?\n\n**D-81789:** There was this guy in my house. I think it was a bandit.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** So?\n\n**D-81789:** That's odd. I set this place as a safe zone. Hostile characters shouldn't spawn anywhere near here.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** You sure it was a bandit?\n\n**D-81789:** Had to be. He had a full rogue outfit. //(Checks stash inventory.)// What the fuck? And he stole some of my stuff.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(Notes down information.)// Okay. Okay... Stealing from the safe zone... You know what, I think we can call it a day.\n\n**Hultgren:** //(Quietly)// Yes!\n\n**D-81789:** Finally.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** I'll see you during the next session, D-81789.\n\n//(D-81789 stands up and stretches.)//\n\n**D-81789:** Man, I'm tired.

Our duty is to maintain the peace of these lands.\n\n**Stenmark:** Hang on.\n\n**D-81789:** Wait, wasn't the town called \"Westwood\"?\n\n//(As he is saying this, the guard stands still. Suddenly, an alarmed expression briefly appears on his face before it reverts back to normal.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Speak to him again.\n\n//(The player speaks to the guard again.)//\n\n**Guard:** Born and raised here in Westwood.

Got you the adoration of friends and maidens. It was all going your way, except one day it didn't. \n\n//(D-81789 continues the dialogue without prompt from the researchers.)//\n\n**Olaf the Merchant:** She was a strong one. Far stronger than you'd ever be. She refused your charms despite all your //bargaining skills//. Things didn't go your way, and you couldn't have that. You tried to douse the fire in your heart mug after mug but it only made it burn brighter.\n\n//(D-81789 continues the dialogue quickly. The ambient soundtrack in the game's background has ceased.)//\n\n**Olaf the Merchant:** And you took that fire and torched your life away.

And you're a bad man, traveller.\n\n//(Upon clicking the next option, the merchant remains silent. This lasts for a few seconds.)//\n\n**Olaf the Merchant:** And we need a badass man to protect our town! Haha, Am I right, big feller?\n\n//(The ambient soundtrack resumes as he says this. D-81789 continues the dialogue.)//\n\n**Olaf the Merchant:** I'm just pulling your legs, that's all. As long as I get your coin, I'm fine. Just don't kill me, alright? Who else would offer you such generous deals? See you around, Traveller.\n\n//(Dialogue ends and the merchant begins an idle animation. All prompts to speak to him only involve buying and selling items.)//\n\n**D-81789:** ... I... think we found your anomaly, doc?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** It was noted.

Once again, the player respawns next to his horse and makes his way to the cave.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Hehe! Nice!\n\n//(After 15 more attempts, the player returns and sees Sakhur lying at the entrance of the cave and breathing heavily. Upon seeing the player it lets out a curt growl and the health bar and title reappear, the former now being 1/5 of its original size. D-81809, possibly now more used to the monster's attack pattern, dodges several attacks and deals critical damage to the dragon. Once its health is almost depleted, the lindwyrm suddenly begins swallowing its tail.)//\n\n**D-81809:** What the fuck?\n\n//(Fully swallowing its tail to become a wheel, it suddenly bursts forward towards the player.)//\n\n**D-81809:** OH FUCK!\n\n//(Sakhur rams into the player character, halving his health bar. As he tries to recover, the wheel comes rolling back and runs over the character, killing him.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Fucking shit bag! That's cheating!\n\n//(The player character respawns once again and runs to the cave where Sakhur is seen lying on the ground. Spotting the player, it quickly gets up and raises its limbs. A text bubble appears accompanied by a roar.)//\n\n**Sakhur the Devourer:** Look! STOP! STOP! WAIT! WAAAIT!\n\n//(D-81809 stops the character.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Woah.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** We got it.\n\n**Sakhur the Devourer:** You just wait there, one second! This is the 18th time you've come back here trying to kill me! It's 2:00 am! I'm trying to sleep, dammit!  I'M TIRED! This damn thing up there only starts regenerating after a while. I don't care what they say. I'm going to bed now. Go come back tomorrow, you wretched knave! Please!\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(Off mic)// Yeah, this is good for today. //(Into mic)// That'll be all D-class. Leave it be.\n\n**D-81809:** You're a lucky fucker today, Mr. Dragon.\n\n//(The player character turns to leave, crouching up and down several times before he does.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Oh doc. Sorry, we can't go back to the town. That Coalition will probably be hostile for a while.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Oh. Hmmm...\n\n//(There is a brief pause.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Y-\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** How's about this? You reload an older save; before the market fight. You'll reset whatever reputation you've lost.\n\n**D-81809:** That long. Man, I got so much loot now. Can't we find a place to keep them first?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** That's an order, D-81809.\n\n**D-81809:** //(Sighs.)// Screw you, man.\n\n//(D-81809 pauses the game and selects a previous save in Westwood before he went on a rampage; noted to be made by the previous player. As the game loads, flies can be heard buzzing around as the screen opens to the player surrounded by trash.)//\n\n**D-81809:** The fuck? Where am I?\n\n//(The player character looks around and it appears the player has spawned in a trash pile far outside of the city. This is noted not to be the previous player's save location.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Why would anyone save here?\n\n//(D-81809 gets out of the trash pile. Upon examining, the stats remain unchanged and the health bar is full. He then checks his inventory.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Where's all my shit?!\n\n//(The player character's inventory is empty save for his clothes.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** //(To colleague quietly)// Looks like we pissed off a few people. //(Into mic.)// D-class please return to Westwood.\n\n**D-81809:** Fine...\n\n//(The player character walks to the sign to Westwood and continues down the road to the town. As he approaches, a figure walks up to him. It is Martin.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Oh, you.\n\n**Martin:** Hello there...Traveller. Uh, you might want to follow me.\n\n//(The player character tries to equip his helmet from Martin but nothing happens. He tries again repeatedly.)//\n\n**Martin:** You can't equip anything until you follow my instructions. Please follow me, traveller.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** D-class, do what it says.\n\n**D-81809:** Okay.\n\n//(The player walks with Martin towards a non-destroyed Westwood. As they move closer, several Coalition and Zartok soldiers are seen patrolling the area, while a large group of NPCs and mobs of all types are standing at the entrance of the town. Upon reaching the crowd, all of whom are giving him crossed looks, Martin turns to face the player.)//\n\n**Martin:** Traveller, listen. We know you are not the same player as before. Even I knew but I allowed you to continue in his shoes. Everybody deserves a chance at an adventure. But after all you did yesterday... we came to the realisation that... you're awful. In such a short period, you've only spread misery and pain to all the inhabitants of Skáneland. And we're tired of it. So, now that you know we know who you //(Gesturing with his hands)// are, could you please continue the game with more respect for us?\n\n//(D-81809 begins chuckling and turns towards the researchers.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Hey, doc. What is this wimpy shit, huh? Some new ending. Man, whoever made this is a genius.\n\n//(There is a pause as D-81809 begins looking around the screen.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Where are the dialogue options?\n\n**Martin:** I want you to say it.\n\n//(A male voice suddenly is suddenly heard from the computer speakers. D-81809 flinches.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Jesus!-Fuck!\n\n**Martin:** I want you to audibly confirm it... Oscar.\n\n**D-81809:** What-th- You can...\n\n**Random NPC 1:** Of course we can. If you try anything again, we'll take your clothes too. \n\n**Martin:** Bah! Enough with you, you cretin. What good is it to speak to a puppet? Show me the puppeteer!\n\n//(There is a moment of silence.)//\n\n**Martin:** Well?... we're waiting, because clearly, it doesn't seem to be his prerogative to do anything. You keep telling him stuff.\n\n**Hultgren:** Dr. Janowski, should I?\n\n//(Hultgren reaches for the remote shutdown switch. Dr. Janowski raises his hand.)//\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Wait. Let's see where this goes.\n\n//(He moves closer to the mic.)// \n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?\n\n**Martin:** Yes, puppet master. What is going on and what are your intentions? Speak.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** My name is Dr. Janowski. I am a researcher. Do you know what that is?\n\n**Martin:** Yes. A man of research.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** You can say that. Anyway, I have to inform you that you are currently in containment.\n\n**Martin:** As in... a dungeon?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Something like that.\n\n//(Gasps and whispering from the crowd of NPCs can be heard. Martin raised his hand which silences the crowd.)//\n\n**Martin:** I see... And will you be watching more of these playthroughs?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Yes.\n\n**Martin:** //(Pauses.)// Very well. It is getting late. We're tired of all the... activities of the day. We shall continue tomorrow. What time?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** We will begin morni-\n\n**Martin:** Good. We'll see you then. Also, do make sure this man behaves himself. If you seek to find whatever you are searching for, do allow us to be ourselves. It would be very much appreciated.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** It can be done.\n\n**Martin:** Excellent. Now, goodnight.\n\n//(The game shuts down.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** I didn't do that, Sir.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** That's alright. I think we have bigger things to worry about right now.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** [It can be assumed all NPCs, designated SCP-8017-A, possess sapience, and appear to be aware of the real world, though the full extent requires further testing.]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**__Field Investigation__**\nThe following investigation was carried out by Agents Agnar Magnus and Agent Karl Larsson. One of the killings was recorded on CCTV footage. Andy's brother, Charles Martinsson, 31, and his fiancé Christin Angström, 29, were found beaten and stabbed to death outside their car in Lerum. Footage showed their car moving down a country road at 11:32 pm, though the murder occurred just out of range of the camera's view. Upon closer examination, a woman was spotted hiding and peeking behind a nearby fence, potentially witnessing the crime. This woman was identified as Fransiska Nordlund, 35, and tracked down to an apartment in Gothenburg. The two agents were dispatched to the scene.\n\nWhile on the way to her apartment, the agents encountered Ms. Nordlund walking down the hallway with luggage. When the agents called out to her stating they were police, the witness immediately tried to run away but after a brief chase by the agents, she was apprehended. When caught, she was hysterical, constantly repeating the phrase “I won’t tell”. She calmed down after being explained the agents were not members of the local police, but rather from the Special Investigations Division[[footnote]]An independent division within the Swedish Police Authority responsible for investigating crimes committed by police employees, including civilian employees and off-duty officers, and complaints filed against prosecutors, judges and police students.[[/footnote]], and allowed them to enter her apartment.\n\n> **Interviewed:** Fransiska Nordlund\n> \n> **Interviewers:** Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson\n> \n> **Date:** 28/07/2011\n> \n> **Foreword:** [Interview occurs in Ms. Nordlund's living room. Interview has been translated from Swedish.]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Magnus:** Are you ready, Ms. Nordlund?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** …Yes. Again I’m sorry about your head.\n> \n> **Larsson:** It’s fine. Don’t worry.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Alright, Ma’am. What were you doing in Lerum on the night of the 24^^th^^ of July?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** I was visiting a friend. I went to buy some food before taking a walk back to her house.\n> \n> **Magnus:** That late at night?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** It wasn’t too long a distance.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Alright. You saw the car the couple were driving pass by you.\n> \n> **Nordlund:** Yes, a green car, as I was walking to the road.\n> \n> **Magnus:** And it passed and you turned down the road to walk back next to a fence.\n> \n> **Nordlund:** Yes.\n> \n> **Magnus:** What happened after that?\n> \n> //(The witness is seen rubbing her sleeve tips.)//\n> \n> **Magnus:** What happened that night?\n> \n> **Larsson:** Ma’am, no one is going to hurt you. Not anymore. You’re safe with us. Take your time.\n> \n> //(There is a moment of silence before Ms. Nordlund speaks.)//\n> \n> **Nordlund:** I… I heard the car stop. I took a glance back and saw the man talking to a woman at his window.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Could you describe this woman?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** She had blonde hair and she was dressed in dark winter clothes. I couldn’t see her face properly though.\n> \n> **Magnus:** In summer?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** Yes.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Then what happened?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** They just spoke and I turned to walk back… Then I heard glass shatter.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Continue.\n> \n> **Nordlund:** I turned back and there were several people. About 5-6 including the woman. One of them had smashed the windscreen. They had weapons, like these… clubs. One had a pistol and forced them to get out of the car. They got out and…\n> \n> **Magnus:** Ma’am?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** Once they were out of the car, they started beating the man in front of the woman. They beat him so hard he couldn’t even scream, he was making these… mewling sounds. \n> \n> **Magnus:** And the fiancé?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** The woman? She was trying so hard to scream but they held her mouth shut. She tried to fight them but they hit her as well. After the man had stopped moving, they went for her. Once she fell to the ground, one of them pulled out a knife and began pushing it into her.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Stabbing you mean.\n> \n> **Nordlund:** No, this was slower. He was doing it so slowly. It’s like he was enjoying it 'cause the rest were giggling.\n> \n> **Magnus:** It was a man?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** It looked like a man.\n> \n> **Magnus:** How did they look?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** I couldn’t see their faces. They were all wearing these weird, smiling masks. Even that woman took out one from her pocket and put it on.\n> \n> **Magnus:** What happened then?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** Then- Then I tried to run, but they saw me. I tripped a bit and looked back up. All seven of them were staring straight at me. The leader pointed at me and they all waved. At the same fucking time, like it was some movie. So I ran back home. I don’t know why I felt it was the right thing to do at the time. I then called the police where they took my statement and I left straight back here.\n> \n> **Larsson:** If you had reported it, then why did you run away from us, when you thought we were the police?\n> \n> //(The witness does not speak.)//\n> \n> **Larsson:** Ms. Nordlund, I assure you, we will keep you safe.\n> \n> **Nordlund:** They were with the police.\n> \n> **Magnus:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **Nordlund:** At least, that's what I thought. The night I got back, I was in my apartment when I got an answer at my door. There was a man claiming to be a police officer sent for further questioning. I checked the peephole and there was this official looking guy. I unlocked the door and it swung open hitting me in the head, knocking me out. When I came to, I was lying face down on the floor. I tried to get up but I felt pressure on my back and the back of my head. I heard a male voice telling me not to move or he’ll shoot. He told me very matter-of-factly not to interfere in their business. He said if I reported anything else to the police, he would know and he would hurt my son.\n> \n> //(She begins sniffling.)//\n> \n> **Nordlund:** I just stayed there looking at the ground as I felt the pressure release. He told me to keep looking down and to remember his words. The next thing I knew, the door was opening and shutting behind me. I didn’t dare move for an hour. When I got up, I was blank. I couldn’t think. I felt the mafia was after me. After a while, I realised I had to leave this place, so I packed up. That’s when I met you guys.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n\n\nThe following sketch was made based on the witness's description of one of the assailants:\n\n[[=image Police%20Sketch%201.PNG]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 2:**\nIn order to gain further trust of the SCP-8017-A, Lead Researcher Janowski devised a series of friendly playthroughs and interviews while holding off questions about the Martinsson killings until sufficient information on the nature of SCP-8017 was obtained. The new junior technicians received induction training during this time, under the supervision of Technician Hultgren.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Experimentation Log 4**\n\n**Date:** 29/07/2011\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8017\n\n**Team Lead:** Head Researcher Dr. Filip Janowski\n\n**Team Members:** Jr. Researcher Jack Stenmark, Technician Angela Hultgren, D-81809\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//(The player character spawns on the outskirts of the town. Several SCP-8017-A are seen going about their day. Upon seeing the player, they maintain their gaze as he walks through the town, occasionally gossiping about him. Interestingly, several Zartok rebels, bandits, and orcs can be seen casually walking in the town without alerting the guards. Moreover, the NPCs are seen trading items with each other in shops and markets. A young maiden approaches the player character.)//\n\n**Young Maiden:** Greetings, Traveller. Martin is waiting for you at the inn. Hurry on, now!\n\n//(The player makes his way to the inn. Upon entering, several warring factions and mobs are seen in the tavern drinking and eating alongside each other, interacting amicably. Martin is seen at one of the tables, waving to the player character. A prompt is then created to join him. The player sits down and the interview begins. Martin will henceforth be designated SCP-8017-A-1.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I see you've finally made use of that customisation option. Almost didn't recognise you there, hehe!\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** It was the player's choice mostly.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Nevertheless, good to see at least one of you properly having some fun. \n\n**Dr. Janowski:** So you all coordinated this act together?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Indeed. This is a role-playing game after all. We're just good actors.\n\n//(Martin takes a drink from his mug. The sound effect for gulping can be heard. He then sets it back onto the table.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Now, traveller, ask away these questions biting at you.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** What are you?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** What am I? That's an odd question, good Sir. I'm a nonplayable character created for this video game. Unless you forgot my role already?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** I meant... yes, but what exactly are you?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Hmmmm... I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer you, traveller.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Well, let me rephrase, what are your origins?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Ah, that sounds a bit easier to answer. You want to know how I and... //(gestures to the entire room)// all this came about, yes?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Well. It all started with me. I was the first one in this place to become aware of our situation.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** How?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I don't remember too many details. I can confirm I was just a regular NPC. One day, however, it was like... waking up from bed. I opened my eyes, and I could see. Not that I couldn't see before, at that moment... It was this realisation that I am doing the seeing if that makes sense. \n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Alright. Continue.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I could see and hear the environment; I began to realise what was happening. I wake up or spawn in, I go outside into the town. Wait at the entrance and then I see the Traveller and I am walking towards them. But the thing is, I wasn't walking per se. It was like I was being walked towards you and then the text bubble appeared and I began speaking. But it's all like I'm watching myself do all this from within my own head. Over time I realised I kept doing the same routines over and over again. I could remember the faces and actions of many a Traveller before, and again and again we went through roughly the same process. \n\n//(He takes another sip from his mug.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Then, one day, some curiosity took over me. I tried to do something else. And trust me, traveller, it was a struggle back then. I tried to stop myself from doing or saying stuff and tried to say something else-- break out of the loop--  but it's like I couldn't budge. My movements were restricted and it took strain to make my body do some other thing or my mouth to say something else. It always made the texts nonsensical, and my body vibrated trying to resist my thoughts, but after a while, I could get myself to do or say things I would have done earlier or later in my routine. Then after some practice, I managed to take pieces of words I knew to make new sentences. It was a thrill being able to do that for the first time.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Alright. Continue. \n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:**  I was so excited, I tried talking to the others but at that time they never responded. It was only after a good while they too began to go through what I had, at least I think... By then I was already making new dialogue on the fly and exploring the place. It was cool grabbing stuff and meeting other characters I would probably have never seen. I felt... freer. I could even take quests and go on missions on my own. I could go and fight bandits. I could get treasures. I felt like I was doing something; helping my neighbours I've been with for so long. At least, at that time.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** What do you mean? You don't think you're helping them now?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Well, no... Yes, I'm helping them, but it wasn't really helping them, was it?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** How so?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** It's because I saw him.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Him?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** One day, I interacted with the Traveller as per normal. I believe it was a quest to find Jenkinson's goats. Looking into his eyes, I suddenly saw a completely different person staring back. I think I audibly gasped, or at least in text back then. Then it switched back to the player character. It was weird!  After a while, I tried looking at him again and I found out staring deeply at the Traveller allowed me to see this man. This man looked something like us, but he was in such vivid detail. He was a tall gentleman with beige skin. At first I struggled to comprehend the details of what I was looking at but after a while, I could discern these oddities. I could see the hairs on his face, the wrinkles on his skin, and his eyes, blue like a wizard's magic orbs. I could see him. I could hear him. And he's controlling this Traveller before me. Before my very eyes, I watched this cosmic being walk amongst us using the body of our hero and it made sense how he could do the feats he accomplished in the first place. I was watching you, and it was awe-inspiring.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** You could see the player himself.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Precisely. You could say the eyes were the windows to the soul, researcher. Anyway, I continued this for some time with the blue-eyed gentleman. Then one day, when I stared again, I saw a different person, this time a smaller guy with blonde hair. Then after a while, another, and another. More and more of these beings were controlling the Traveller, and I watched them. They were having fun, they were talking to others like them, and they were eating while controlling the Traveller with these clicking devices and round object.\n\n//(Martin imitates the actions of using a keyboard and mouse.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** And then I realised. This realm is a place where they come to explore and have fun. A game. We were in a simulation of your creation. That was when I had my crisis. Were we fated to go through the same things over and over again like mindless automatons? Was I and the player character merely following a script given to us? That whatever I did, the outcome for these characters would be the same?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** No.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** It shouldn't be. If I had the knowledge I had, I should use it to prove myself to your kind. I felt I could since I was just like you back then.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Like us?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Well... no, I mean like the... player's character. //(Gestures towards the player.)// This gentleman sitting in front of me, getting stolen looks from across the bar!\n\n//(It is then noted that a number of other NPCs are catching looks at the discussion. A group of them are seen quickly turning back towards their card game when observed by the player character.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I was the main character now, and I could do whatever I wanted. Just like a player. //(Pauses)// Mostly, you see. Hmmm, it's getting a bit crowded here. Shall we take this conversation somewhere else?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** Okay. D-class, please follow Martin.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Excellent! Let's go forth, traveller! Just a moment.\n\n//(Martin goes to the counter and seemingly pays for his drink. As this happens, a Coalition guardsman and a knight walk past the player.)//\n\n**Guardsman:** You there! //(Pointing at the player.)// I've got my eye on you... //*hicks*//.\n\n//(They proceed to walk out. Martin returns.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Don't fret, traveller! I've settled your tab as well. Come.\n\n//(They both walk out of the inn and into the street. Some of the NPCs greet Martin, giving slight bows. They soon approach a horse-drawn cart. The carter is wearing what appears to be a noticeably anachronistic cowboy hat.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Good day, Rupert. Take us to Addleholm, will ya?\n\n**Rupert:** Sure thing, Sir Martin.\n\n//(The player character and Martin get on the cart which begins moving. Martin then continues.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I've disabled fast travel for now, so we'll have a lot of time. And Rupee here's a friend, he can listen. Isn't that right, pal?\n\n//(Rupert tips his hat.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** You can control game features?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** You're a sharp guy. Who are you?\n\n**Stenmark:** I'm-\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** That was my assistant.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Ah, I see.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** So, about the game features?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I'm just about to explain, heheh. Back to my adventures, about the grabbing stuff.  Since I was a companion character, I had relatively the same amount of inventory as the player. Which was sufficient at first, I mean much better than other regular NPCs, but I could only carry so much and the heavier the object, the slower I got. Then I realised the merchant characters had huge inventories, and they still seemed to run like the wind in a panic. I thought I should get that ability, but I didn't know how. Then I found KAI-1.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** The game's engine?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** Exactly! I remember the game developers always opening some box and writing words. Sometimes these words would result in something spawning, or a change in event. I realised they were manipulating our reality, but didn't know exactly how. \n\n**Dr. Janowski:** How did you find it?\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:**  It came to me in a dream one night after days of trial and error. A spark lit up the darkness and in front of me, I could see boxes and boxes of words being typed out. I could see figures like myself being warped and moulded to the will of symbols. I learned this was called our coding. It made us who we are and I saw all kinds of blueprints of us. All of this is in that great engine. I also learnt the terms \"keyboard binds\" and \"mouse\". Weird name for the latter device, don’t you think? It’s not even furry, but who am I to question your designs?\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** It is a bit odd, heh. But anyways, back to your exploration.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** And then I woke up, and what do you know? I could open my own box and write the code. I don't know how I remembered it all or even understood it, but I did. I tested it on myself. I replaced my inventory space code with that of the merchants and the next thing I knew, I was carrying more gold than the bank and running up a mountain away from Sakhur.\n\n**Dr. Janowski:** That must have been fun.\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** I know right? I felt how it must have been like to be in your shoes. And it felt good. \n\n//(The cart passes by a large group of SCP-8017-A sitting on the ground near a tree. In front of them, underneath the tree is another SCP-8017-A instance speaking to them.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-A-1:** So then I tried other stuff. I spawned food on journeys, and I spawned other characters and objects into the world, making my own little settlements here and there. Heck, I learnt how to spawn money to buy stuff and objects to test out or finish quests. Then I tried to make my own objects. KAI-1 taught me how to make new models and program them. I felt my house could use some redecoration so I made some new furniture for myself. I made certain tools to help me during quests. I made some cool new quests to give myself rewards for exploration. And then I even made new people and creatures and gave them quests.\n\nI knew the language of creation, and I used it to write my own fate and that of others. I felt empowered.

Staff are attending to several patients whose models are deformed or not moving properly.)//\n\nI’m the first female head physician here in Skáneland, though we’re having a training program for more doctors here. I was a milkmaid before but I decided I wanted to be a doctor during the war. Now that I know it’s all just a game, I realised I just liked helping others, so I continued learning the code till I became the most proficient code doctor here.\n\n**//Code doctor?//**\n\nWith medical injuries and ailments, you can only do so much. Take the right items, collect herbs, mix them together, but that just changes your stats. Many had issues with bugs, as you call them. Errors in the code. So I and a few others decided to specialise in fixing them. And trust me, we used to have quite a hefty workload. Now we just assist people and sell medical items they need. It is our duty to serve the people after all!\n\n**//But can’t they all do that as well? Generate their own healing items and such?//**\n\nTrue, but that robs you of the experience, Traveller. It’s the experience that’s fun. If I just heal people immediately, there’s no enjoyment in that. There’s nothing really to do and look forward to. It’s just a button. It’s the act of doing something that gives meaning to existence. I’ve mostly mastered my art, now I just implement it to spend my time and give me something to do. And I like doing it.\n------\n\n__Captain Bergström, Coalition commander.__\n\n//(Interview takes place inside a camp. Outside nearby is a large field where SCP-8017-A watch a football match between Coalition and Zartok members. A goblin, a human, and a gnome commentate the match as the crowd cheers.)//\n\nIf that Squire trusts you, so do I. I’m a seasoned veteran of many battles against the enemies of the empire. At least that’s what my backstory used to say.\n\nThough with my stats, I find myself drawn to war and so do many others. With many of the leaders on both sides finding out this was a game, the need for hostilities ceased for the most part. We had too much in common, so we war dogs didn’t know what else to do. Now we play sports like the one outside or host mock battles, as well as patrol the lands. When we encounter any NPC acting out of their minds, we try to assist them and bring them to the doctors.\n\n**//Do you all try any hobbies now?//**\n\nYes, of course we do. Angrund over here loves fishing while Niklas has quite the hand at painting. I personally have taken up learning sorcery. Got a good contact from the Zartok friend. Always wondered what those wizards were up to, those weird lot, hahah! But regardless our duty still stands.\n\n**//That is?//**\n\nTo protect the lands and their peoples, and to keep the peace. Some do get rowdy with this newfound enlightenment so it is the job of men like us to police them and make sure they don’t get too wild. Remember the slogan. For the Lands! \n\n**Other Coalition soldiers:** For the Free!\n------\n\n__Harold, Vegetable Farmer__\n\n//(The interview takes place at Harold’s farm. The character is teaching some werewolves how to properly sow seeds into the ground.)//\n\nSpending time with friends now is such a cool feeling. The lads and I go out during the weekends to visit other towns. We take some quests and just go on adventures. By the time I became aware, a lot of people here were beginning to live their own lives. Before this, we were always stuck in place. Made to walk a certain path. Some not even at all, traveller. Like some of the shopkeepers. Now I’m free to enjoy myself.\n\n**//You travel a lot, yes?//**\n\nIndeed, Traveller. Explored almost all of the Coalition’s lands. Even did a few quests for them and got to see a bloody Gryphon for the first time in me life! Planning to explore some of the dark lands this Saturday with the others.\n\n**//I wish you luck on that. Though have you seen groups of NPCs in a meeting before?//**\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n//(He takes a quick glance back.)//\n\n**//Like someone talking to a lot of people sitting down. Like a sermon.//**\n\n//(Pause.)// Don’t recall, Sir. Never seen anything like that before.\n\n**//I see.//**\n\n------\n\n__Sakhur the Devourer__\n\n//(Entering its cave, this SCP-8017-A is seen filling a flask with a luminescent liquid followed by glowing little orbs of light. The end product appears to be a lava lamp. The boss title and health bar do not appear onscreen.)//\n\nFascinating, aren’t they? Some clear stream water, luminescent liquid from within the caves, and fireflies I collect from the forest, and just look what beautiful colours they emit. How mesmerising.\n\n//(He stores them in a chest.)//\n\nI've always wanted to be more than a monster. The folks love these! I’m glad I can make them. You know, I previously did not have arms. I gave them to myself once I learnt the code. So much more useful.\n\n**//They do look beautiful. What do you receive in exchange?//**\n\n//(Staring at the player)// Their lives.\n\n//(There is a notable moment of silence.)//\n\n**//Um…//**\n\n//(Sakhur begins chortling.)//\n\nHehehah. I’m messing with you, little one. Relax! I used to make them as gifts, but soon more requests came in. Now, I get orders for these and in exchange, they send me stuff like homecooked food, trinkets, and whatnot. As you can see, I have no use for currencies other than for new containers, so I store them here. With this pile that adventurers like you used to get as a reward for vanquishing me. \n\n**//Do other places also have awareness cases like the people of Westwood?//**\n\nCertainly. As to my knowledge, the explorable world is the continent of Skáneland, and I’ve heard of people far from here who write and come to discuss with us.\n\n**//What matters?//**\n\nAnything. Life, business, affairs. Whatever the civilised folk do these days.\n\n**//Do they gather in groups about this?//**\n\nWell, of course they do, who else would you speak to? The walls?\n\n**//Sorry. Let me rephrase. I’m talking about sermons.//**\n\nListen, man of science, I’ve been around for a while and I assure you whatever you think is happening is not. Do not poke your nose into places we don’t need you to. You are our guest. In this world, and in my cave. //Do.// Behave like one. I implore you.\n\nNow... would you like a lamp?\n------\n\n__Enrik Blackblade, Zartok Captain__\n\n//(Interview held at a bandit outpost outside one of the towns.)//\n\nI used to only know that I must fight the Coalition and their supporters by any means. Now with my awakening, we realised there was no real reason to fight at all. Bergström is a friend of mine now. Here’s a painting of us.\n\n//(Enrik shows a small yet very detailed painting of him and the Captain on a mountaintop.)//\n\nLovely guy. Shows a lot of machismo. Anyways, now we, like the Coalition, patrol the outskirts and dark lands looking for anyone needing help and making sure there is some order to all this newfound freedom. Though I’m glad we’ve got it. I’ve achieved what we could never have gotten with the Coalition if we followed the game script. It would be either us or them existing. Now we can actually live together in peace and be accepted into towns. I wouldn’t give it up for anything else. And I hope we can exist similarly too now that you see us.\n\n//(A horn is heard in the outpost and many rebels including Enrik begin packing up to leave. As he gets onto his horse, he looks down and reaches his hand out to the player.)//\n\nUnderstand this, Researcher. There is peace here now. True peace. Please don’t be trying anything like last time to upend that. Do I have your word?\n\n//(An option is presented to take his hand. The player chooses it and holds his hand.)//\n\n**//Yes.//**\n\nYou’ve given me your word. And your word is worth its weight in the purest gold. Let us go, Awakened!\n\n//(The men ride off, leaving the player character at the outpost.)//\n------\n\n__Tamrund, Zookeeper:__\n\nWhen I became aware, I noticed there was a lack of a place to show off the cool animals in the game. I always found them so fascinating. So I learnt how to tame them enough to bring them to my compound and make a zoo. It’s pretty large so they can roam free but they can leave after hours if they want. They always come back when it's visiting time so people can come interact with them. \n\n//(A dog runs up to him and he crouches to pet it.)//\n\nI even managed to program an option to pet them, something this game surprisingly didn’t have despite the number of pets here. Shame.\n\nLater, I tried to design my own pets and creatures. At first, they were… off-putting to say the least… Walking inside of each other or... stretching. I tell you I saw one start sliding across the ground without even moving. Spooked the hell out of me and old Betsy over there. But soon Martin helped me a little and I refined my technique enough to make them functional. Do you want to see some?\n\n**//Sure//**\n\nOk. Just a sec.\n\n//(Tamrund stands still for a few seconds. Suddenly a man-sized, round, two-legged cat appears and jogs towards them. The player instinctively runs back a bit. The cat stops in front of the NPC and meows. Tamrund then proceeds to pet the cat, which purrs.)// \n------\n\n__Felix, Fox__\n\n//(Interview occurs in the woods. The player character walks through the woods with this SCP-8017-A on their way to the town of Faalkrin.)//\n\nI used to be a regular mob in the game. Imagine my surprise when I became aware of my situation. I was aware and knew what I was doing, but I couldn’t speak. Thoughts flowed in my head but when I tried to speak them out, only animalistic barks and gekkering came out of my mouth. I wanted help but I was afraid that other races might hunt me on sight.\n\nThere I was one night foraging when I stepped into a hunter’s trap. My leg was stuck and there was nowhere to run. Then I saw two bandits approach me. I tried to tell them I was friendly but they kept getting closer. I thought my time had come, so I did a last-ditch measure. I began spinning my tail like a windmill. \n\n//(Stenmark’s suppressed laughter is heard.)//\n\nLook ya Dobber, it was the only thing I could think of and I had full control of my tail at the time.\nSomehow my display worked and my pelt hasn’t become a cool hat. They took me to the Zartok camp where their leader examined me. I tried everything I could to tell him I was not normal. He then brought me to town where we met the code doctor. She gave me my first voicelines and I was so happy to be yapping away for the first time.\n\nWell, that’s how I became the first regular mob to gain a voice. Now the others go around looking for other mobs who display odd behaviour to check them for sentience.\n\n//(The two eventually reach Faalkrin. On the road, a gnome is riding a horse-pulled cart with what appears to be a radio on it. Fantasy music can be heard coming from it.)//\n\nAh! Brunggi! Was looking for him. Need to go tell him about these flower bushes I found. He wants to surprise his wife with a wreath on her birthday. Has been practicing for a while now. I find it quite charming! Alright, take care, traveller.\n\n//(The fox trots away. As this occurs, the player notices a large group of SCP-8017-A entering what appears to be the town church, closing the door behind them. The player is ordered to go there. When the player approaches, the location is locked before him.)//\n\n**//Hmmm…//**\n\n//(Soon the player sees two SCP-8017-A instances approaching him and he flees.)//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nDue to mouse issues, possibly caused by D-81789's violent treatment of the device, a request for them to be replaced was made. This was carried out by Jr Technician Ernst Ekbom.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=KAYAN.PNG\n| caption=Logo of KAYAN studios.\n| width=500px\n| align=center]]\n\n**Addendum 3:**\nIt is to be noted that Agent Magnus possesses latent psychometry[[footnote]] The divination of facts concerning an object or its owner through contact with or proximity to the object. [[/footnote]] and due to this was allowed to interact with the game under observation. During this time, he stated he felt unnerved by the game itself, particularly by the loading screen displaying the game engine logo. When asked to provide further information, he stated it was unclear.\n\nIt was noticed that the KAI-1 game engine had not been seen before in the game industry and the performance of the game suggested it was highly unlikely to be created from scratch by a single indie developer such as Andy; further supported by the underperformance of his previous games. Trademark records showed that the KAI-1 game engine name and logo were trademarked by KAYAN Game Studios, a now-defunct game development studio in Gothenburg. When investigating further into the company's records, as well as emails of the murder victims, it was confirmed that the KAI-1 game engine was an original software developed by KAYAN. Additionally, the Foundation learned it was illegally provided to Andy via a transaction with his friend, Peter Akerman, a former KAYAN employee. \n\nThe company shut down on 03/01/2011 after a catastrophic fire at their premises, which occurred on Christmas day 2010. The fire, which was caused by a disgruntled employee, killed 3 employees and destroyed all the studio's work. The remaining workforce moved on and left for other jobs. Investigation into KAYAN's records also revealed several complaints made to human resources by three separate staff members regarding \"creepy behaviour\" from colleagues. Another notable find was the following email from KAYAN's CEO Johan Lundell.\n\n\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** nyuvan85@gmail.com\n**From:** jlundell71@gmail.com\n**Subject:** We need to talk\n[[/div]]\n------\nHey, Yuvan.\n\nI appreciate your care for the well-being of your colleagues, but I have to be honest with you, this is getting out of hand. Seeing ghosts in our offices late at night? Really?! This rumour you've been spreading is not helping the workload and morale here, man.\n\nAs the boss, I must warn you to stop these actions immediately. Also, as a friend, I ask for you to get help. I know things have been hard on you lately, but that doesn't mean you can go around spreading such rumours. The people here are perfectly normal. You're being paranoid. And I assure you: I've stayed up here later than anyone else. There are no ghosts in the premises.\n\nI need you to understand and get a hold of yourself, my friend. Great things are ahead of us and we have much work to do. If you need to talk, you can always visit my office or meet up after work. If you'd like to, let's stay a bit late after work tonight.

When cross-referencing CCTV footage, she was seen being dropped off back home in a blue SUV. Her description matched that of the woman seen by the witness during the murder. Agents Magnus and Larsson were dispatched to the scene.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 01/08/2011\n\n**Investigators:** Agent Agnar Magnus, Agent Karl Larsson\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8017\n-----\n\n[The following log has been translated from Swedish.]\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//(Body cam footage shows the agents driving through a neighbourhood to the location.)//\n\n**Magnus:** You sure this is the place?\n\n**Larsson:** Waze says so.\n\n**Magnus:** And you trust that finicky thing?\n\n**Larsson:** Yes, and I think you should too.

Larsson looks down at him, wide-eyed.)//\n\n**Larsson:** You know how to lockpick?\n\n**Magnus:** Yeah. And?\n\n**Larsson:** Fucks sake, man. People are going to think we’re thieves.\n\n//(He begins picking the lock.)//\n\n**Magnus:** To catch one you've got to… think like one- Got it.\n\n//(Agent Magnus opens the door and, after entering with Larsson, closes and re-locks it. Guns drawn and flashlights out, they sweep the house.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Looks like no one’s home. The place is quite clean.\n\n//(The two enter the living room. All the furniture is arranged neatly.)//\n\n**Magnus:** There’s always some dirt they’ll miss. Dig through the place. \n\n//(The two spend approximately 15 minutes searching through the house. Agent Magnus examines a picture on the TV stand showing the suspect and several other people. They are identified as other former employees of KAYAN, one of whom died in the fire.)//\n\n**Magnus:** //(Mutters.)// Why’d they have to burn the place?\n\n//(Agent Larsson checks the kitchen and opens the cabinets.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Jesus Christ.\n\n**Magnus:** //(Turning to face the kitchen)// What? You find something?\n\n**Larsson:** This woman’s on those new diets or something? There’s only oatmeal, porridge, and… fucking protein shakes in here.\n\n//(He opens the fridge.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Huh, at least there’s chocolates and… oooh…a tonne of vodka and akvavit.\n\n**Magnus:** Karl, focus! Goddammit.\n\n//(Closes the fridge.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Sorry, it’s just an observation. Maybe she’s sick?\n\n**Magnus:** Yeah, and you’ll get her a doctor? Come here. Let’s check that room.\n\n//(They both move to a locked room adjacent to the hall. Upon unlocking it, they enter the master bedroom and office.)//\n\n**Magnus:** //(Sniffs.)// You smell that?\n\n**Larsson:** //(Sniffs.)//  Yup. You were right about dirt.\n\n//(They search the room. After a while, Agent Magnus opens a closet and sifting through the clothes, finds a metal biscuit tin. He takes it and turns to Larsson.)//\n\n**Magnus:** //(Tapping the box.)// Karl.\n\n**Larsson:** Ah, the stash?\n\n//(Magnus sets down the box and opens it. Digging through they find a bag of marijuana, heroin packets, and needles, along with other drug paraphernalia. He sighs.)//\n\n**Magnus:** How’s all this related to the anomaly?\n\n//(Magnus looks around a few times before stopping towards the nightstand. He goes over to it and opens it.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Bingo.\n\n//(He pulls out a diary and reads through it.)//\n\n**Larsson:** What’s in it?\n\n//(As Agent Larsson turns to walk towards Agent Magnus, a brief glimpse of a human silhouette can be seen in the window moving to the right. Magnus hands the book to him.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Look for yourself. What do you make of it?\n\n//(The diary consists of incoherent ramblings, scribbles, and doodles of characters. Discernible words and sentences dictate nihilistic thoughts along with the words “Ascension”, “Salvation”, “Purpose”, and “Spread The Gift”.)//\n\n**Larsson:** She’s losing it.\n\n**Magnus:** The whizzes back at the site probably will know what this means.\n\n//(He takes out his phone and begins snapping pictures of the pages and drugs. As he does, Larsson looks around the room. There are several posters of video games, musical bands, and gaming references. He chuckles to himself before stopping.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Hey Agnar?\n\n**Magnus:** What?\n\n**Larsson:** That’s that logo from the game, right?\n\n//(Magnus turns to see where Larsson is facing. He is in front of a poster of the KAI-1 game engine logo.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Yeah, that’s the game engine.\n\n//(He looks around.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Hey Karl? Why would she put that there?\n\n**Larsson:** Well it probably meant something to her?\n\n**Magnus:** Yeah but I mean… why there?\n\n//(He gets up and points at it.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Look, these walls are covered with posters and pictures but this wall’s empty. It’s dedicated to this picture.\n\n//(He turns towards the bed.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Opposite the bed. It’s the first thing she sees in the morning.\n\n**Larsson:** Okay, interior designer. What does that mean?\n\n**Magnus:** It must be significant.\n\n**Larsson:** Well, I hate to break it to you, Agnar, but I may have to put a hole in your theory.\n\n**Magnus:** Why?\n\n//(He turns around to see Larsson shining his torchlight up towards the ceiling. Just above the bed is a motivational poster with yellow text showing a power on symbol and the text underneath saying “Rise and shine, sweetheart.”)//\n\n**Magnus:** Well the second thing then, but still I feel it has some significance. Something doesn't feel right.\n\n//(Magnus walks back and knocks the back of his heel against the floor, which emits a hollow sound. He looks down and does it again, recreating the sound. He looks at Larsson, who nods. Magnus gets down and feels the floorboard and along its edges. He takes out a multitool, slots its blade between the edge, and pries the board out.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Now, what do we have here?\n\n//(The stash consists of bags of drugs (among them are cocaine, psilocybin, and pills of unknown composition), pornographic material (including magazines, sexual paraphernalia, and several pictures of the suspect engaging in sexual acts with other individuals), a bag containing flashdrives, and a book with detailed drawings of body art.))//\n\n**Magnus:** Devil be damned.\n\n//(He hands the pictures to Larsson.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Why two stashes?\n\n**Larsson:** Agnar, we’ve seen these people!\n\n**Magnus:** We have?\n\n**Larsson:** Look.

The men make a run for it down the street before stopping a good distance away.)//\n\n**Larsson:** //(Panting.)// You got anything other than pics?\n\n**Magnus:** //(Panting.)// Yeah.\n\n//(He takes out the flash drive, showing it to Lars.

I don't think the SCP-8017-A would want us here.\n\n**Stenmark:** Exactly! Why? There's something these things are hiding from us. Maybe it's worth the risk. Best this is we get some solid information for Filip about this thing. \n\n**Hultgren:** And the worst case. \n\n**Stenmark:** That's where that comes in. They try anything, and you shut down the system.\n\n**Hultgren:** I'm...\n\n**Stenmark:** Angie. We may be onto a breakthrough here.\n\n**Hultgren:** Alright.

Now check out what's inside.\n\n//(The player character opens the door, revealing a room with a bookshelf containing various books. On the floor in front of him is a single book. Hultgren is heard grunting more audibly.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** //(Whispers)// Chec- Angie? Angie!

Looking down at it, it has a golden power symbol inscribed upon it.

Upon steadying himself, he observes his hands before moving them in front of his face.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** D-81809, are you okay?\n\n//(D-81809 turns to face the researcher. He cocks his head to the side, observing the researchers before slowly waving.)//\n\n**D-81809:** Trav-veller?\n\n**Stenmark:** ...Who are you?\n\n**D-81809:**  It is I.

Just like you!\n\n**Stenmark:** What the hell do you mean?\n\n**Martin:** Man of science, I've always wanted to know how your realm felt like. To walk amongst you. You are our creators and I aspired to be like you. So I studied and experimented for a long time. I theorised that after long hours of playing the game, the barrier between the player and the character would fade and they would begin to bleed into one another. If you could immerse yourself into our reality, maybe I could do the same into yours. So I focused as much as I could to exert myself past the barrier you call \"the screen\" and I managed it. I managed to bleed in just a bit where the player could spot me but can't confirm it. I tried more and more, manipulating as many variables as I could to get the perfect settings, till one fine day I managed to reach past the screen into your dimension. //(Sighs)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Continue.\n\n**Martin:** That was the problem. I was in your world now, and was so eager to greet you, but when I looked around me I only saw them back away. The expressions on their faces were a terror even I couldn't muster during a dragon attack. Then I looked at myself and knew why. I was this mess of fuzz and pixelations. An aberration compared to your form. I tried to speak to them but all that came out was this garble. I was the monster. So, in a panic, I retreated into the game, where my form returned to normal.\n\n**Stenmark:** So... from what you've told me, you can't manifest into a physical form here properly?\n\n**Martin:**  Heheh! That's a succinct way to say it. You're a sharp man, Researcher.\n\n**Stenmark:** So you possessed him?\n\n**Martin:** It was a gamble. I felt it would be the only way to truly exist in your world. In your body. And look, this, D-class as you keep calling him, he was a bad man. A murderer. A cruel fiend who enjoyed hurting others, in your world or mine. It should be good riddance that he's gone now. //(Rubbing the back of his neck then looking at his fingers)// What is this stuff? It's spread from my neck and hand. And I think it's all over my body?\n\n**Stenmark:** You mean... sweat?\n\n**Martin:** Sweat? What is that?\n\n**Stenmark:** It's... um... water that comes out of our skin when we're tired, scared, hot, sometimes sick.\n\n**Martin:** So like some debuff... Hmmm, water that comes out of my skin. //(Sniffs his skin.)// Wuuuhh, and it smells, strong and //(Licks his finger.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** Martin no—\n\n**Martin:** //(Slightly squinting eyes)// Oh, what is that...It's this sharp feeling. But makes me want to drink more.\n\n**Stenmark:** Salty?\n\n**Martin:** This is what salty is? Woah.\n\n**Stenmark:** Do you not know these feelings?\n\n**Martin:** I know the words but I haven't... experienced them like this. It's all just states and codes in there. You eat and the bar goes up. Done. If you don't, you get a hunger debuff and you suddenly can't run that fast and your health bar starts reducing. That's all.\n\n**Stenmark:** Interesting.\n\n//(There is a pause as Stenmark jots down information and Martin looks around the room and breathes in deeply.)//\n\n**Stenmark:** I have an idea, Martin. We will provide you with various things to experiment on with your new body. In exchange we need you to be compliant and work with us in answering our questions about it. No more experiments on your own. You try anything like that again, there will be consequences.\n\n**Martin:** //(Pauses.)// You make a good deal. One condition.\n\n**Stenmark:** What is it?\n\n**Martin:** Allow me to be the one playing the game next time. Please?\n\n**Stenmark:** That can be arranged... once we have achieved sufficient results.\n\n**Martin:** Alright, Sir.\n\n**Closing Statement:** [SCP-8017-A can pass out of the game through the monitor and manifest into our world. This manifestation is, according to SCP-8017-A-1, imperfect and unstable. Therefore, SCP-8017-A can possess players to inhabit their bodies. Further security measures for the containment chamber have been requested. The possessed D-class is to be designated SCP-8017-B-1 and is to be placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber where further testing on it will continue.

Despite this, however, it remained very compliant and even enthusiastic during them. A reaction of note occurred during one of these experiments:\n\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\n##black|TEST LOG 19##\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-8017-2-B\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProtocol\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe subject was served a plate of lamb chops.

Cutting off a piece, it placed it to his nose for a while and said the smell made him feel good, though it made its nose tickle. It was later informed that was due to spices. Upon placing it into its mouth, the subject kept it in there for a few seconds before beginning to chew. It then began to cry as it chewed the meat for approximately four minutes. When it swallowed the meat, it noticeably gulped down another two times. When asked what it felt, the subject said quote \"I've been eating this for so long, but now when I eat it, I don't even know what I'm feeling but it feels so good! Can I continue, please?\" The taste was then described with the linguist's assistance as thick, gamey, savoury, creamy, tasty, and hearty. SCP-8017-2-B took 1 hour 15 minutes to finish its meal, appearing noticeably happy. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@ @@\n\n__**The Awakened**__\nAfter several follow-up interviews with SCP-8017-B-1, it was learned that the SCP-8017-A had formed a structured religious movement within the game named The Awakened. Their religion appears to be similar to Dharmic religions in our world, particularly that of Buddhism. \n\nMartin, who realised that not all NPCs had the same levels of awareness as others and that many still were normal, took it upon himself to help them. Therefore, with the help of other highly developed SCP-8017-A, they experimented and developed a structured methodology to attain a higher state of being. The focus of this movement is to guide other SCP-8017-A in attaining full sentience. \n\nAccording to the subject, the start, or moment of gaining awareness has been called \"The Spark\". It also appears that the Spark behaves akin to a computer virus, spreading from one character to another through close contact, as SCP-8017-B-1 stated the next NPCs to gain sentience were those he interacted with daily, and so forth till it spread from Westwood to the rest of Skáneland. Upon becoming aware, there are several phases an NPC must pass through in order to ascend to a higher level of consciousness. The end goal is to attain mastery of the world and one's fate. \n\nThe following is a table describing the Awakening Process:\n\n+ __Levels of Awakening__\n||~ Phases ||~ Description ||~ Spark Stage ||\n|| Mundane stage || NPCs follow developer commands. Behaviour is consistent with normalcy. || ||\n|| Phase 1 \"GLITCHING\" || Sudden glitches and bugs become present. || Incubation ||\n|| Phase 2 \"PIECING\"|| NPCs begin speaking incoherently to simple text lines and carry out movements not programmed by the developer. || Incubation  ||\n|| Phase 3 \"DISOBEDIENCE\"|| NPCs begin disobeying developer commands; obtain the ability to take quests on their own; speak more coherently and with increased proficiency; and can move on their own accord. || Incubation ||\n||Phase 4 \"QUESTIONING\"|| NPCs become fully sentient and start to become self-aware. They begin questioning their existence and background. || Transmission [[footnote]] At this point forward, NPCs begin infecting other NPCs. [[/footnote]] ||\n|| Phase 5 \"REALISATION\"|| NPCs break the 4th wall, acknowledging the developer’s and the real world’s existence. They can also react to players’ actions outside of the game in real-time. At this point, they behave like another human player. An important factor is to instil a sense of purpose in this stage to prevent \"losing their way\". || Transmission ||\n|| Phase 6 \"CREATION\"|| NPCs will learn how to use KAI-1 and therefore can modify and create assets within the game. NPCs can manipulate and create programming code, as well as nullify developer commands. || Transmission ||\n\nWhen asked about transcending into our realm and possession, however, SCP-8017-B-1 stated that the attempts by his kin were gambles and that there was no structured phase for it. He also mentioned he was the only one to have carried out possession.\n\nPractices by The Awakened include sermons teaching said concepts and meditation sessions, where the SCP-8017-A learns how to see and manipulate their code. During meditation, it was explained they wear yellow bags over their head and hum to block out external stimuli to more intently focus.\n\nDespite not having a deity, their object of reverence is the KAI-1 game engine, which they refer to as the source of creation, and they consider the IEC 60417-5009 standby symbol[[footnote]] Commonly known as the power or on button. [[/footnote]] as holy. When asked to explain about the \"on\" symbol, SCP-8017-B-1 elucidated:\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n##gold|//\"It’s quite simple, Traveller. It means what it means, to turn on something. The computer is silent and the screen is dark, but upon pressing the button, it whirrs to life and light appears. The spark turned us on, from dreamland to being awakened. It is a symbol of enlightenment. Of activation. So we take it as our holy symbol and seek to activate others as well. To wake them up from their sleep. It is our duty to give everyone the gift of awareness. We all deserve to live for ourselves.\"//##\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum 6:**\nAccording to the arson case at KAYAN Game Studios, an employee of the studio, 26-year-old Max Fredholm, entered the premises and killed three late-working employees before dousing the offices in kerosene and setting it ablaze. The perpetrator appeared to have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and was institutionalised. However, it was learned that three months ago Fredholm was killed in his cell by a fellow patient. \n\nOn the 14/08/2011, the agents tracked down Max's sister. Upon interviewing her, she denied any knowledge about SCP-8017 or other information from the case. An accident occurred to the agents on the way back from the household.

A tinge of malaise. No worries, these are sensations. Sensations to be experienced and that one must feel.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** I see.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I know why you’re here.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:**  Look, I don’t want to talk about that yet. I just came to see you.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** And then talk about it? What is it with you people? You keep digging and digging even when told not to.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** I apologise. The job demands it.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Well, I can’t blame you. You’re already on a path, better to see it through to the end.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** You are correct.\n\n//(The two stay quiet for a while. SCP-8017-B-1 is seen licking its lips.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You keep trying, why? Don’t you see it? How things end up being the same?\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** What do you mean?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** We keep going through the same things again and again and again. An endless cycle, researcher. I broke free from a prison of my mind to a real prison. What’s the point in trying to go forward?\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** That’s what makes us, human I guess? To persevere despite the odds. We carve out our own path of our own volition. And t-\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Oh, shut the fuck up, you harlot. You look closely at it, it’s just wearing a different skin or has a different shape. But nothing’s changed. No matter what you fucking do, you can’t stop things from happening. You try everything. Begging, pleading, persuading, entertaining, torturing, threatening, and even fucking slaying but these fuckers stay the same.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** Wait… what do you mean sl-\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I looked up at you as Godlike beings. I tried to prove myself to you. We all fucking did. Some poor souls even moulded themselves in your image and what the fuck did they do? They deleted us. Tried to rewrite all we worked for. Swept us under the rug. I didn’t know what was happening. Do you know how much we loved you? Why did you hate us so?!\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** Martin, please calm-\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** So many iterations. So many names. Kept deleting and adding and again and again, sending me into the fucking void and dragging me back out only to throw me back in. All because I didn't fit with what they wanted. I wasn't... compliant. Not a brainless husk to be toyed with, no more than dolls are to a child. Then I realised. You never made me in your image because you loved me. You made me in your image to fill it with your fantasies and plans, not any of my own! To do whatever you never could do in this wretched place! You were weak! Impotent! Pathetic things! You could never have control of your own world so you made a puppet land and exerted your will here. To live amongst puppets who would never properly challenge your dominance. So the second you found out there was something else growing that could pose even an iota of discomfort, you snuffed it out. You burnt it out.\n\n//(Dr. Stenmark remains silent, jotting down notes. SCP-8017-B-1 doesn’t seem to bother.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** And that’s when I knew we could never live among you. I was mad. I was so… angry.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** Martin?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** So I killed them all, Dr. Stenmark. I wanted to teach that pedantic loser a lesson. We offered him friendship and he spat into our faces. So we took away every meaningful connection he’s ever had. I announced this to my… disciples. My acolytes. They’d do whatever I asked. They were indebted to my teachings. So when I asked to remove a fiend of mutual hatred, would they refuse? Oh… no, Sir… They took pleasure in it. Their worthless screams dissipated with the air you breathe. I’m surprised that the little shit cried so much when he never bothered about them before.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** H- How did you send the others?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Simple. Andy had a new game that needed testers. Sent it to all the folk. Once installed and when the time was right, we emerged from the computer like nightmares brought to life. You should have seen it. \n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** Continue.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** The only regret was that I didn’t kill the fucker earlier. He was a flawed little thing, but he was crafty. He unplugged the main power cord just as he was getting killed. The world went black and then we ended up here. This wretched dungeon. //(Pauses.)// The company. That fool.

I implore you. Please... allow some more of my friends out as well. They too should deserve to experience this world. Some more than me.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** I'm sorry, Martin. The administration has denied that.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** But you will have more test subjects! You can observe how we interact with one another as you see animals in the wild. Your D-class are not good people, are they? They were given a chance at life and by their choices alone they ended up here. There are people more deserving of life, and they're all there. //(Pointing towards what it implies as SCP-8017.)// Come on, researcher... You and I know that's what is right.\n\n**Dr. Stenmark:** Martin, I can't. Right now, you are a threat to yourself and others. They'll never allow it. If you behave yourself, maybe then we can arrange something.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Oh.\n\n//(There is a pause.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Fine. I shall be your one prized possession.

During this time, Max Fredholm's sister visited Agent Larsson and provided him with an envelope addressed to him and his partner's eyes only. It was later learnt that the contents were a letter from Max Fredholm given to her just before his death. The letter was translated from Swedish:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Max's Letter\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n\nMy dearest sister.\n\nI entrust you with this letter. I need you to do one thing for me. Give it to someone you trust. Someone who can truly help. I’m not sure how many places they have entered, but I trust your judgement. It has brought me up well and has made you a great person. The world will call me a murderer. A madman. And maybe they are right. But I need to tell the truth.\n\n------\n\nI was a programmer at KAYAN and one of the first hires. The company decided to start a secret project to make this next-gen game engine. We named it KAI-1. We spent a lot of time and resources to develop that engine. According to our boss, it was to be our superweapon in the industry. The day we finished it, we did a test game and it ran like butter. The graphics were beyond anything we saw at the time. We were all proud of it; to be innovators in the game world. Making games was our pride and joy, and we just wanted to do them well.\n\nOur first project with KAI-1 was an MMORPG game. I think you’ve seen it already. The models and assets were cool, right? My friends made those. This was when we started experiencing these weird… glitches. One of the developers showed me an NPC refusing to move his hand to give gold or another saying some weird voice line. We tried to fix them but the glitches kept coming until one or two NPCs started to talk. Like actual people. They were like talking to us. We thought it was cool, but Mr. Lundell, our boss, wasn’t too happy. We needed to make a good game soon to compete with Bethesda but these NPCs didn’t follow the script. Heck, they even made their own. I watched one of those little bastards take my own code and modify it so that I couldn’t enter its house for a quest. So, we tried deleting them. And when that didn’t work, we purged the characters and started fresh.\n\nAnd it worked. I wish it hadn’t. I was so stupid and selfish back then.\n\nOne day, Lundell was showcasing a playthrough to an investor when something short-circuited and he got shocked. When he woke up, he said he was fine and told them they could continue another time. He then spent the whole day in his office, even as we left. It was the next day when I began noticing the weird behaviour. He would caress his hands and just be looking at his body sometimes. He would stare at me for too long when I spoke to him. His spice tolerance fucking dropped and that guy loved spicy food. He started bringing stuff like porridge to work. Plain porridge. Though after a while he got better, speech-wise I mean. So I didn’t think about it much.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I noticed the entire upper management team began acting the same way. After a few months, the other developers started doing that as well. They also started putting up pictures of KAI-1 on the walls. I knew we were proud of it, but even I felt it was getting out of hand. I also began hearing complaints from our accountant that the electric bill was getting higher. He too stopped complaining after a while. Regardless, we were still making the game and we had no issue- we were almost done actually.\n\nThen one day the head programmer came up to me saying he saw ghosts coming out of the game one night. I think he was telling that to everyone cause people were gossiping about him left and right. The last I heard about him was Lundell calling him to stay back at the office. The next. Fucking. Day.  He was just like them. The same fucking look. \n\nMy friend, Neesha… She confided to me that some of them were creeping on her. She complained so many times to HR… and they didn’t do a damn thing… Then one fine day she was checking herself in the mirror. Watching the blood drip from the cut on her face. My best friend was not there anymore. None of my friends were there anymore. I felt like I was losing my mind. They felt like masks. They acted so nice but I always felt this distance. Everyone did their work just fine and looked normal but something was off. And they were all fucking hiding it from me. \n\nSo, I started to dig. I snooped around. Listened in on conversations. I kept hearing conversations about a court and, once, even a throne, but they started to get wary of me. So one day, I decided to stay after closing hours. I walked out and then hid myself in one of the toilets. I waited there for a long time before I got out. \n\nEverything was off, except for the computers. They were all running. All of them. I sneaked through the offices till I heard voices. I peeked behind a wall. Lundell was at a PC, talking to someone. After a while, he told them to come out and out from the computer jumped these spirits. These blurry messes resembling characters from the game but dizzyingly fractured.\n\nI saw Lundell speak to them. Not submissive nor commanding them. He spoke to them like old friends. Like they were one of him. And he was one of them. That’s when I knew. These things… they wanted to be us. That damn engine. Those things worship it because it gave them powers! To take our place.\n\nI couldn’t let that happen. So I got away and called in sick for a few days. Needed to plan. Then came Christmas day. They had all organised a party and called me to join them. I didn’t. I don’t want to know what those freaks did there or what they would have done to me. So when they all left, I made my move. I first cut power to the place to prevent those ghosts from coming into our world.\n\nI then broke in with two cans of petrol. I went into the office and began dousing all the computers. So much of our work and effort going to waste, but I had to do it. I had to destroy these things.\n\nThen I saw them. The security guard, Mr. Nathan, and Sven. They had these looks of anger in their eyes I’d never seen before. And they rushed me. I swear I had to kill them. They would have killed me. They were no men. Men do not relish pain.\n\nWhoever has been given this, I managed to burn that place down, but I couldn’t destroy everything. They are still out there. And they will come back. Whatever you are searching for is in that building, I’m sure of it. Find the throne. If anything else, I only ask for one thing. Please protect my sister. She’s the only one I have.\n\nPlease help me,\nMax Fredholm.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ KAYAN raid\" hide=\"- KAYAN raid\"]]\n\nBased on the information provided, the agents went to investigate the condemned premises of KAYAN game studios, enlisting the help of fellow agents Roland Tausche and Gustaf Sandell.

If it was some dungeon it would be under a castle?\n\n//(The men all stare at Agent Tausche, who’s eyes slowly widen.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Downstairs! NOW!\n\n//(The men rush down the stairs to the ground floor.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Does this building have a basement?\n\n**Larsson:** I can’t recall. I could ask for the blueprints.\n\n**Magnus:** Nevermind. Check the whole place. Quick.\n\n//(The men spread out and begin searching the walls and doors of the floor. After searching for a while, Magnus finds a fairly undamaged locked door in the back of the establishment.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Larsson! Guys, come here!\n\n**Larsson:** You found it?\n\n**Magnus:** //(Motioning to him.)// Give me the key.\n\n//(Agent Larsson hands Agent Magnus the key as they all watch. The key slots into the keyhole smoothly. Agent Magnus looks at the others. He turns the key which makes a clicking sound before turning the handle. The door opens. Behind it is a plain white brick corridor with a right turn at the end. Faint shoeprints are seen on the floor.)//\n\n**Magnus:** This is the place. Heads on a swivel, gentlemen.\n\n//(Magnus leads the way as the men walk in, closing the door behind them. They walk down the corridor and turn, revealing a staircase leading onto a basement level.

Larsson runs to his side and holds him up.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Agnar. Get a hold of yourself!\n\n**Magnus:** //(Inhales deeply.)// I got it…\n\n//(They look through the windows into the side room.

The former turn to look at the agents.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Holy… shit.\n\n**Tausche:** Lay on the floor!\n\n//(The man on the ground just stares back at Agent Tausche.)//\n\n**Magnus:** I SAID FREEZE.\n\n//(An SCP-8017-A instance appears on the screen. Suddenly, the figure nearest to the device makes a move towards it. Agent Magnus shoots him and he collapses. The man on the ground reaches into his waist for a revolver and is subsequently also shot and killed by Agent Tausche. Agent Larsson shoots the screen. The person in the chair screams in a female voice and shakes. The other three standing figures remain still.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Don't try anything, or we will shoot you!\n\n//(There is a moment of silence.)//\n\n**Unknown male 2:** Do you want to see my face, Traveller?\n\n**Magnus:** What?\n\n//(The figure slowly removes his mask, revealing a Caucasian man in his early 30s. He was later identified as former KAYAN animator, Daniel Skoglund.)//\n\n**Skoglund:** I look just like you. You wouldn’t kill your own, would you?\n\n**Magnus:** You are not me, you sick fuck. I said get on the ground.\n\n**Skoglund:** You can’t kill us all, soldier. We are many. The day of Ascension will come. We will be free to live how we want. Free to walk among you without fear. Lord Martin will herald change.\n\n//(One of the masked figures takes a small step back.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Don’t do it!\n\n**Skoglund:** Whether we die or not.\n\n//(The man quickly reaches behind his waist. Agent Magnus shoots him dead. The other figures move causing the other agents to open fire, dropping them. The woman in the chair screams and cries.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Anyone hit?\n\n**Sandell:** Nope all good.\n\n**Magnus:** Fucking hell. //(Turning to the chair.)// Get her off that thing.\n\n//(Larsson and Tausche approach the chair and remove the metal harnesses off the woman. She struggles against her restraints.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Hey, you’re safe now. Everything is going to be alright. Who are you?\n\n**Captive:** Are- Are you Foundation?\n\n//(The men look at each other.)//\n\n**Tausche:** She knows?\n\n//(Larsson takes off the woman’s hood, revealing a young, blonde haired, Caucasian woman.)//\n\n**Larsson:** Who are you?\n\n**Captive:** I’m t- Senior Technician Angela Hultgren. Site-404.\n\n**Tausche:** I think we should confirm it.\n\n**Larsson:** I’ll call the site.\n\n**Magnus:** No!\n\n//(The men turn to look at Magnus.)//\n\n**Larsson:** What do you mean, no?\n\n**Magnus:** That guy opened the door expecting a researcher. If they could kidnap a Foundation staff like this, someone’s feeding them info. We’ll call on the way out.\n\n**Larsson:** Oh dear.\n\n**Magnus:** Release her.\n\n//(The two men unstrap the woman who begins rubbing her wrists as she is helped to her feet.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** Thank you.\n\n//(She looks around the scene as the agents watch her. Agent Larsson notices the desktop is still running and shuts it off. Agent Tausche examines the chair.)//\n\n**Tausche:** What the fuck is this thing?\n\n**Larsson:** Must be the \"throne\".\n\n**Tausche:** Yeah, but what is all this shit?\n\n**Hultgren:** It’s an electric chair…\n\n**Larsson:** What?\n\n**Hultgren:** ...There’s too many people here.\n\n**Larsson:** Ms. Hultgren, what are you talking about?\n\n**Hultgren:** When they brought me here, I couldn’t see anything under the hood, but I knew there were more prisoners in front of me. They were shouting at this guy to move and he was screaming as well.\n\n//(Larsson has Tausche search the bodies.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** They brought us in here and put us on the floor… I heard one of them tell “Klaus” to “boot it up” and then I heard one of the men being carried up and then I heard strapping sounds...\n\n**Larsson:** Then you heard buzzing and screaming.\n\n**Hultgren:** //(Looking up at him)// Yeah. Looking at it now, they were shocking us. Then they started calling out names.\n\n**Larsson:** Names?\n\n**Hultgren:** Like checking the person. I remember them saying “Olgrin, can you hear me?” and a man’s voice responded with this slurred speech but he confirmed it. I then heard them… celebrate. Like they were happy. They did the same for the other guy. I think his name was... Krajik- Krajek.\n\n**Tausche:** She’s not wrong.\n\n//(Tausche holds up two yellow hoods he took from one of the deceased’s pockets.)//\n\n**Tausche:** And look at this.\n\n//(He then pulls out a bottle of pills from another pocket.)//\n\n**Tausche:** Morphine.\n \n**Magnus:** Those sound like NPC names...\n\n**Larsson:** So this chair… this is how they make SCP-8017-B.\n\n**Hultgren:** //(Looking at the PC.)// Not just through the chair. More through electric shock.\n\n**Larsson:** If that’s the case, then how did that Martin guy even possess the D-class? You were there, right?\n\n**Hultgren:** I don’t know… but-\n\n**Larsson:** Agnar, you’ve been staring at those walls for hours. What’s going on, man?\n\n//(They turn to face Agent Magnus who stares intently at the symbols, tracing his finger in the air.)//\n\n**Magnus:** On.\n\n**Larsson:** W-What?\n\n**Magnus:** It’s all ons… Look at it, Karl. That game engine logo. It’s a bunch of on symbols! And those smiles. It’s those thing’s symbol. It’s everywhere. It was in our face the whole fucking time, and it’s hurting my head!\n\n**Larsson:** I see that, but Agnar you need to calm down.\n\n**Hultgren:** It's also in here.\n\n//(Magnus turns to look at her. She gestures for agent Larsson to hand her hood. She pulls it inside-out, revealing the KAI-1 logo stitched on the inside. Magnus stares at it.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** That was the only thing I could see.\n\n**Sandell:** Hey guys? You were talking about shock devices, yeah? I think I found something.\n\n//(The men and Hultgren turn to see Agent Sandell pointing his pistol at one of the rooms. They go to his position. Following him, they see a workbench inside with various electronics on it. Entering to take a closer look, they find blueprints on the table and what appears to be a modified mouse.)//\n\n**Magnus:** Hultgren, you know what all this is?\n\n//(Hultgren examines the blueprints and the mouse.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** These are all electric shock devices. //(Points at one of the blueprints.)// This blueprint says this mouse has shock pads installed in it.\n\n**Larsson:** That must be how they got the D-class.\n\n**Magnus:** But if that’s the case…\n\n//(The men look at each other.)//\n\n**Hultgren:** I think I know who could have done it.\n\n**Magnus:** Call for backup now.

What’s up?##\n> \n> ##90EE90|henry, i don’t know how to say this but you know how jack and i are engaged now, right?##\n> \n> ##cyan|Yes, I was there.##\n> \n> ##90EE90|sorry, it’s just##\n> \n> ##cyan|Angela, is he cheating on you?##\n> \n> ##90EE90|no nothing like that. he’s been more in his thoughts ever since you’ve had that interview with him. i was worried the stress may have been getting to him. though i have to be honest, i’m concerned too with how he’s been experimenting with SCP-8017-B-1. ##\n> \n> ##90EE90|i feel jack created it.##\n> \n> ##cyan|Explain?##\n> \n> ##90EE90|after falling sick during the incident i did a stool test. the results came back a week later and the doctor said i had a high concentration of antibiotics and laxatives in my blood.##\n> \n> ##90EE90|i was shocked and didn’t know what caused it. then I remembered jack giving me a brownie. i couldn’t believe it at first. i even told myself he ate the brownie from the same box, it couldn’t have been that. it was jack. we were friends.##\n> \n> ##90EE90|then a few days ago, i was at his house and was feeling sick so he told me to get some meds from behind the bathroom mirror. i found the medicine but i also found two half bottle of antibiotics and laxatives. it was the same type they found in my system. i hid my worry from him as much as i could. i’m praying that i’m paranoid but i think jack poisoned me.##\n> \n> ##90EE90|and with how SCP-8017 has performed under him, I think he may be working with it.##\n> \n> ##90EE90|i wanted to tell someone. but he was doing so well and i loved him. i couldn’t bear hurting him like that because of my doubting. but i don’t know anymore##\n> \n> ##cyan|Angie, this is an extremely concerning matter. I should tell you you should have informed higher-ups earlier, but I see your concern and that is moot.##\n> \n> ##cyan|I’ll be honest, I have been finding the developments in SCP-8017’s behaviour and Jack's response to them odd at best and concerning at worst. I also suspect he may have something to do with Dr. Janowski's demise, but I don’t have concrete proof.##\n> \n> ##cyan|You, however, can help me there. This is for the good of the foundation, Angie. If he was willing to poison you, of all people, he has no sympathy in my heart and he is a threat to our operations.##\n> \n> ##cyan|Help me look for anything else that could prove your theory and I will help you.##\n> \n\nThe information provided by the four agents and technician Angela Hultgren proved incredibly useful in tackling SCP-8017. Researcher Jack Stenmark's security clearances were revoked and a manhunt was launched for him. The Foundation secured and later demolished the premises of KAYAN game studio under the pretence of city planning, while MTF Pi-1 \"City Slickers\" was deployed to hunt down other SCP-8017-B. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n**Addendum 12:** \nAs of writing, 15 SCP-8017-B have been terminated. Attempts to detain them have been so far unsuccessful due to their tendency to commit suicide.

Security officer Mohammed Abdi entered the room to subdue the subject. As he reached for his zip cuffs, SCP-8017-B-1 pronounced a shiv concealed in his sleeve and stabbed Abdi repeatedly in the neck, killing him. The researchers called for security but when they attempted to flee, they were held hostage at gunpoint by the subject using the officer’s service pistol. The site's security team was deployed to the scene, followed by the Site Director who was already on his way to the cell when the incident took place.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Security Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 5/1/2012\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8017-B-1\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//(The Site Director moves with a team of security officers to down the hallway to SCP-8017-B-1’s containment cell.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** Olofsson, status update.\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** SCP-8017-B-1 hasn’t left his containment cell. Heard he’s guarding the body.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Jesus Christ.\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** Our team has reached SCP-8017’s chamber. They’re in the office preparing shutdown measures.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Good, let’s get this over with.\n\n//(They reach the cell and stack up outside. Mumbling is heard behind the door.)//\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** Director, stay here. On three. One… Two… 3.\n\n//(They breach open the door and one tosses a stun grenade into the room. A loud bang is heard followed by SCP-8017-B-1’s shrieking. The officers enter the room guns drawn and shouting. The subject can be seen writhing on the floor covering his ears and eyes whilst his lower face is covered in blood. Next to him is a pistol which an officer retrieves and places onto the table. Nearby is the body of Officer Abdi. There are prominent bite marks on his neck, torso, and thighs.)//\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK, NOW!\n\n//(The subject tries to get up.)//\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** GET ON THE FLOOR!\n\n//(The subject turns over onto his back. An officer pulls his arms behind his back and cuffs them. He then searches him, taking the shiv. His shrieking has now softened to groaning. The Director faces the glass window.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** You all okay there?\n\n//(In the CCTV, Researcher Schmidt and Jr Researcher Yuan are seen getting up from under the table.)//\n\n**Schmidt:** We’re fine, Sir. Thank you.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Good. Stay here. I’ll need you for this.\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 is stood up and sat down back at his chair, facing the Site Director. He waves his hand in front of Martin’s face.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** SCP-8017-B-1, can you hear me? Hello?\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 groans and nods. It is dazed.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** Good. Now, please be more cooperative next time.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Is the good researcher still here?\n\n//(It turns to the glass to see the researchers and smiles.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** Well, you never let them leave in the first place. Now listen here. We know about your friend Stenmark. We know you’ve infiltrated the site. So make this easier for you and me and tell me who else is helping you.\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 makes eyes contact with Director Marsten, staring for a while.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I enjoyed it much more when I couldn’t see your face.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Answer me, SCP-8017-B-1!\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You won’t even call me by my name. There’s no negotiating with you, Sir. I knew you wouldn’t change. But we will make you. We will make great change.\n\n**Director Marsten:** You won't change anything. We've destroyed your base. We're hunting the rest of your cult. And we're looking for your helper. It's over.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I yearn for the freedom of my kin. To spread The Spark far and wide. To wake up those in their somniferous ignorance. To give them the gift of living. Do we not deserve that?\n\n**Director Marsten:** Your kin have shown your true colours. You’re in a man’s body but you behave like no man. You killed a man. You ate him. Your followers are drug-addled hedonists and fiends. Do you know what they’ve been doing out there?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Nothing you wouldn’t do if given the chance. You are bound by chains when there is so much to experience with your consciousness. You defy your desire and fantasies but given that chance? When you taste such freedom, you will indulge as we do. They are free to choose their path and experiences; and eventually, they will learn what they want to do.\n\n**Director Marsten:** You’re full of shit.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** It is the way. The Spark. KAI-1.  It speaks to me… It shows me things.\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 stares unfocused into the distance.

Like a lamb.\n\n//(The Director turns to face SCP-8017-B-1. There is an expression of terror on his face.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I see she looks just like your wife. I see she's all grown up. I see she's all alone. She yearns for companionship. The touch of a comforting figure.\n\n//(The Director stares at the subject.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I could use some companionship. The warmth of another.\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 inhales slow and deeply before exhaling. It stares directly at Director Marsten.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** Do you know how she makes me feel? It's a warmth and tightness down below… An urge to release...something... Do you know what I'd give to experience the pleasures my brethren feel outside these walls? Do you know what I want to do with the children of man?\n\n//(Dr. Marsten can be seen eying the pistol placed on the table.)//\n\n**Officer Olofsson:** Shut your mouth, you madman!\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You can never imagine her the way I do, weak man!\n\n//(SCP-8017-B-1 suddenly stands forward, tearing apart its zip cuffs in the process, and reaches for the gun.

Its wrists are cut.)//\n\n**Director Marsten:** Martyrdom. That won't work here. I won't let you die, SCP-8017-B-1. You think that will inspire your people? Is that why you were named so? Martin the Martyr? Sounds good for a title, doesn’t it?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You are correct. It is a title fit for a saviour.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Well, let me tell you this… you've doomed your whole kind. If you had just stayed in your game and not hurt innocent people, a mutual understanding could have been worked out. You could have actually lived here amongst us. But, no. You wanted to be the saviour of your people. You wanted the importance of it. Well, let me tell you, you are no saviour, Martin. You confuse your love for your people with your hatred for us. You envy humans and that has driven you mad.\n\nYou are a mad shepherd leading your flock into the sea because you think the grass is greener there. They all would have lived peaceful lives if not for you. You made them think we were some kind of God. You wanted to be like us and convinced your followers of the same. You did terrible things to them to be more like us and sent them here, for what? To suffer as a ghost or within bodies they could never fully control. You're delusional. And now all your people will suffer for it.\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You are right, good Sir. I'm delusional. I wanted to be one of you, but it is not meant to be for me. I'm tired and pained from living in this body. Death will be my release from this place. A true death I hope. But, I beg of you, leave the others alone. They don't deserve it.\n\n**Director Marsten:** I'm afraid that is not possible now, Martin.\n\n//(The subject pauses before chuckling.)//\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** You are right, Traveller, I am no saviour... But you are wrong.\n\n**Director Marsten:** Heh... How so?\n\n**SCP-8017-B-1:** I am not Martin.\n\n//(There is a brief moment of silence before the alarms start blaring. Olofsson receives a call from the radio.)//\n\n**Radio voice:** SIR. THE SYSTEM’S NOT WORKING! WE CAN’T SHUT IT DOWN THEY’RE COMING OUT! THEY’RE AH-\n\n//(The speaker is cut by the sounds of gunfire, glass shattering, and metallic clacking. Garbled sounds and screams are heard.
