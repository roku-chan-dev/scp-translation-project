On request, PoI-9224 is to perform Protocol-SPINAL-TAP upon SCP-5104-1.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5104 is the collective designation for an anomalous relationship between two entities: SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224.\n\nSCP-5104-1 is a serpentine entity of unknown origin. SCP-5104-1's physical appearance consists of a raised crest attached to a protracted, segmented vertebral column. Pairs of curved appendages are attached to this column, decreasing in length as the sets are arranged along SCP-5104-1's body. The biological composition of SCP-5104-1 is unknown.\n\nSCP-5104-1 is capable of flight, elevating itself at an estimated 6 meters from the ground, and gliding forward at a gradual pace.\n\nPoI-9224 is David R. Shaffer, a resident of Easttown Township, Pennsylvania, and owner of \"Shaffer Chiropractic\". PoI-9224 does not possess any apparent anomalous knowledge or ability aside from their relationship with SCP-5104-1.\n\nSCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 are instinctively aware of each other's physical locations, no matter the distance. While SCP-5104-1 is not capable of vocalization, the entity chooses to communicate with PoI-9224 telepathically at a short range distance. Prior to containment, SCP-5104-1 pursued PoI-9224 in an attempt to interact with them.\n\n**Addendum 5104.1:** Discovery\n\nOn 07/19/2020, at 17:38, Easttown Township law enforcement received a phone call from PoI-9224, who reported SCP-5104-1's presence, and claimed the entity was pursuing him. Within the next hour, multiple calls and reports from various witnesses were received as SCP-5104-1 moved through Easttown Township. Foundation agents intercepted the calls, and containment specialists were dispatched.  Both SCP-5104-1 and PoI-9224 were successfully contained and transferred to Area-179. Witnesses were amnesticized as deemed appropriate.\n\n**Addendum 5104.2:** Interview\n\nFor informational and contextual purposes, an interview with PoI-9224 was conducted. An excerpt can be found below.\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n---------\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n **PoI-9224:** That's what I'm telling you! I was watching TV, then I blacked out. When I got up, I could see, no, //feel// that thing. It was on 4th street, and I knew it was coming for me next. Can't explain it. Just knew.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Interesting. And you don't have //any// idea what could've caused this, hm? No playing around with things you shouldn't have? You're sure this hasn't happened before? Keeping secrets isn't helping anyone, Mr. Shaffer.\n\n**PoI-9224:** I have no clue what you're talking about, honest. I'm a tax payer! I'm a chiropractor! I don't do that pagan shit, if that's what you're saying.\n\n **Dr. Trenton:** Well Mr. Shaffer, it's not every day something like this happens. I hope you can understand my concern.\n\n **PoI-9224:** Look, I love my country. I'll do anything to help you guys out, but I —\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** (//Laughs//) Relax, I'm screwing with you. Hold.\n\n //Trenton holds his hand to his ear, listening to a communication feed. After 20 seconds, he resumes.//\n\n **Dr. Trenton:** That was my colleague. We just finished your check. Upstanding member of the community, huh? Almost ran for mayor a couple times. Very impressive. On Yelp, Mr. Shaffer?\n\n **PoI-9224:** (//Pauses//) What?\n\n **Dr. Trenton:** Your business. Do you have a Yelp page?\n \n **PoI-9224:** Oh, Yelp. I think my son set something up awhile back. Why?\n \n **Dr. Trenton:** Check it often?\n \n **PoI-9224:** Never.\n \n **Dr. Trenton:** Figures. We checked it for you. This ring any bells?\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=50%\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5104/yelp%20review.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Review taken from Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp page (hover to enlarge)\n]]\n\n //Trenton slides a tablet across the table. A screenshot of a Yelp review is displayed on the screen. PoI-9224 examines the tablet.//\n\n **PoI-9224:** The hell's this?\n\n **Dr. Trenton:** Review from your page, seemed suspect. Most recent one, posted minutes before the entity manifested itself in the middle of town. We were hoping you'd be able to provide context.\n\n **PoI-9224:** Yeah, sorry. No clue.\n \n**Dr. Trenton:** Understandable. Still feel the anomaly's presence?\n \n **PoI-9224:** Uh, it's in a cell a few hallways down. He's a freaky bastard, that thing.\n \n **Dr. Trenton:** What do you say we pay it a visit, huh? See what it wants.\n \n**PoI-9224:** Absolutely not.\n\n **<END LOG>**\n\n-------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 5104.3:** Contact\n\nAfter a minor altercation, PoI-9224 was brought near SCP-5104-1's containment cell. Incident is transcribed below.\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n---------\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n//PoI-9224 stands in front of SCP-5104-1's containment cell.//\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Go inside, Mr. Shaffer.\n\n**PoI-9224:** It's going to kill me! No way in hell I'm going in there.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Actually, it was quite docile during containment. Didn't lash out, showed no signs of aggression, what have you. As far as we can tell, the entity poses no physical threat.\n\n**PoI-9224:** God.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** We could //put// you there, Mr. Shaffer.\n\n**PoI-9224:** Alright, calm down. Just so you know, I get my arm bitten off, I'm not afraid to file a lawsuit.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** I'm sure.\n\n//PoI-9224 enters the containment cell. SCP-5104-1 is suspended in the air, its segmented body curled in the corner. Upon noticing PoI-9224, SCP-5104-1 unfurls itself and approaches Shaffer. PoI-9224 expresses distress.//\n\n**PoI-9224:** W — What do I do? It's coming towards me.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Communicate! Talk to it!\n\n**PoI-9224:** H — Hey! I'm not sure what I'm supposed to, uh, oh. //Oh.//\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Yes?\n\n**PoI-9224:** Christ, It's talking to me in my head. W —\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** What's it saying?\n\n**PoI-9224:** (//Pauses//) Wait... I see. It's, uh, telling me it's heard of my... praises? It wants me to work my.... healing treatment on it. The hell?\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** If I hadn't been paying attention to context clues, that might've been a fun twist.\n\n**PoI-9224:** Sir, I think this thing wants me to crack its... back. It keeps saying that it's hurt.\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** That is what you do, Mr. Shaffer.\n\n**PoI-9224:** You want me to give it chiropractic treatment?\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Crack the entity's back, Mr. Shaffer.\n\n**PoI-9224:** (//Distressed//) It's a goddamn flying spine! Where do I even start?\n\n**Dr. Trenton:** Just go for it. Should be relatively easy.\n\n**PoI-9224:** (//Sighs//) I've cracked worse.\n\n**<END LOG>**\n\n--------\n\n**Researcher's Note:** //PoI-9224 enacted a two hour chiropractic session on SCP-5104-1. The entity displayed clear affection towards PoI-9224 and satisfaction with its treatment. SCP-5104-1 remarked to PoI-9224 that the treatment 'freed all pain' and '[it] gives 5 red shapes'.//\n\n//A more thorough examination of the entity has been conducted using anomalous symbology, imagery, and various threat-assessment protocols. It is almost certain that SCP-5104-1 is a non-malicious entity, and poses no immediate threat to the world or The Foundation at large.//\n\n//Considering this and due to PoI-9224's ability to perceive SCP-5104-1's presence at all times, a decision has been made to employ David R. Shaffer on-site as a practicing chiropractor and aide to SCP-5104-1 if need be. PoI-9224 has been granted Level 1 security clearances.//\n\n//SCP-5104-1 remains in containment, and is approved to receive treatment from PoI-9224 upon request.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 5104.4:** Update\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=50%\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5104/yelp2.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Review taken from Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp page (hover to enlarge)\n]]\n\nOn 07/27/2020, the following review was posted on Shaffer Chiropractic's Yelp Page.\n\nPoI-9224 was asked to communicate with SCP-5104-1. The entity informed PoI-9224 to 'prepare for healing', and refused to elaborate on this statement.\n\nAt 13:56, a massive portal manifested in Easttown Township, Pennsylvania. Several hundred entities similar in appearance to SCP-5104-1 emerged from the portal before its closure. Foundation personnel responded immediately, succeeding in containing the entities and preserving the Veil.\n\nFollowing transportation to Area-179, PoI-9224 performed chiropractic treatment on the entities, the duration of the session lasting three days in total. Further information on SCP-5104-1's species remains pending.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-5103]]] | SCP-5104 | [[[SCP-5105]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\nauthor=J Dune]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** kite.jpg\n> **Name:** kite\n> **Author:** [https://www.instagram.com/supposedly_spooky/  M8_Ball]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** own work\n> **Derivative of:** NA\n> **Additional Notes:** Using with explicit permission.
