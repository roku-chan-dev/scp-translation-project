Thank you for your cooperation.\n\n> [OPENING FILE]\n-----------------\n\n**Item #:** SCP-M0053\n\n**Object Class:** --Keter-- --Safe-- Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-M0053 is to be contained within a level-3 ecological containment chamber, with foliage provided based on Nutrition Chart M0053-1.\n\n**Description:** SCP-M0053 is a member of the species //Alces alces shirasi//, or the North American moose. Although there do not appear to be any physical anomalies surrounding SCP-M0053, it possesses the peculiar memetic effect of causing subjects who view it to believe it is highly dangerous. Further research is required into this phenomenon.\n\n> [END OF UNKNOWN FILE]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n------------\n\nDr. Tilda David Moose is not a real moose. She is, however, a real doctor.\n\nDr. Moose is the Site Director of Site-19 (and co-Director of Site-17). She inherited the positions from a string of previous Directors. It remains to be seen how long she will last in these positions. Psychological evaluation states that Dr. Moose is obsessive and prone to anxiety, and recommends a medication regimen.\n\n------------------\n\n**CLEARANCE 4/M REQUIRED FOR FOLLOWING SECTION** \n\n[[collapsible show=\"Please enter credentials.\" hide=\"Welcome, Researcher.\"]]\n\nDr. Moose was formerly one of the Foundation's primary K-Class scenario researchers. She is notably associated with major incidents regarding [[[SCP-003]]], [[[SCP-1000]]], [[[SCP-1985]]], and [[[Serpent's Hand Hub|the Serpent's Hand.]]]\n\nShe has worked closely with MTF Tau-9 (\"Bookworms\") and MTF Sigma-3 (\"Bibliographers\"), but is a member of neither. She has been closely associated with Agent Troy Lament on a number of classified projects, much to Lament's chagrin. Like Lament, she is an ex-protege of Dr. Gears. Considered possible risk factor due to former association with the Serpent's Hand, her (non-public but increasingly known) Type Blue status, and due to the stresses of her positions.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----------------\n\n**Original SCPs**\n\nDr. Moose has primary responsibility for the following projects.\n\n* [[[SCP-1000]]] - Bigfoot\n* [DATA EXPUNGED]\n* [[[SCP-1985]]] - Recovered K-Class Scenario Research Device\n* [[[SCP-2975]]] - Another Sun\n* [[[SCP-3591]]] - A Fallen Giant\n\n**Adopted SCPs (Total Rewrite)**\n\nDr. Moose has overseen continued research on the following projects.\n* [[[SCP-003]]] - Biological Motherboard\n* [DATA EXPUNGED]\n* [[[SCP-472]]] - The Bloodstone\n\n**Updated SCPs (Cleanup)**\n\nDr. Moose corrected integral documentation on the following projects.\n* [[[SCP-303]]] - The Doorman\n* [[[SCP-571]]] - Self-Propagating Infectious Pattern\n* [DATA EXPUNGED]\n* [[[SCP-113]]] - Gender Switcher\n* [[[SCP-105]]] - \"Iris\"\n\n**Tales**\n\n* [[[O5 Command Dossier]]] (primary writer)\n* [[[Personnel and Character Dossier]]] (wrote \"classic\" avatar bios)\n\n* Introduction to the Serpent's Hand on the [[[Serpent's Hand Hub]]].\n* [[[The Second Child]]] — Envy's beacon.
