They all flutter around me like butterflies, if said butterflies were on fire and screeching for help. Darn do I hate butterflies. \nThe one thought that sticks on my mind is-\n\n//Am I blind? Or are my eyes merely closed?\nHave I forever lost the joy of watching those fucking butterflies go up in flames?//\n\nI try to open my eyes but I feel…. nothing. No change. No entropy. \nAm I still a living being, or am I a fading memory of a long lost time.\n[[footnote]]Dang, pretentious all right.[[/footnote]]\n\nThen I see it, the one exception. \n\nIt's bright. \nAnd I see it.\nAnd I remember.\n\nThrough the white hole in the dark endless void shines a dim light. It illuminates my limp body. \nThe hole is small.\nThen even smaller.\nAm I falling?\n\nI am falling. \nIf there's wind caressing my skin I do not feel it, but I'm falling.\nTwisting and turning through the air like a ragdoll in a hurricane. For moments I see the celestial rays of light drawing farther. For moments I see void. \nFor moments I see my goddam massive scythe twirling besides me. \n[[footnote]]Big scythe big scythe big scythe![[/footnote]]\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nI am dead.\nIf my stone solid lips could crack, I'd smile. \n\nThis is the end of my existence, my edgy edgy existence. \nA part of me fills with unbridled vitriolic anger, which I'm no stranger to.\n\n//I lost.\nMe, Willow Deadwood Moriarty, Lost.\nAnd to a fucking pastel fantasy cat girl.//\n[[footnote]]F[[/footnote]]\n\nBut for the most part I feel joy. More joy than I have ever felt.\n\n\nIt's over, and I accept that. \nI’m ready to be forgotten.\n\nThe dark hair waving violently in front of my eyes reminds me that I, in fact, have eyes. And hair.  \nSwirls of colorful streaks churn and meld into a tie die lunacy. And my eyes, one yellow one purple, can only watch. It matters not to me. Not anymore.\n\nMy broken wings, which I also have, offer no resistance. Neither do my ragged clothes, or the chains adorning my body all over. \nI always found all these things to be an odd design choice, but was my word ever of value anyways?\n\nAnd then the light reveals my final destination.\n\nFloor...\nPeople...\n\n…\n\n…\n\n...\n\nFloor made of people?\n\nYes.\n\n[[=image IMG%202]]\n[[footnote]]I FORGOT TO DRAW THE CHAINS[[/footnote]]\n\nHundreds. Thousands. Millions. Stacked on top of each other like dunes of the great sahara. \nThe spinning of my perception blurs everything into a single mess of cat ears, robotic limbs , crystal swords and many, many more features. All of man’s delirium and madness mixed in a single location of pure sin.\nTruly some... questionable choices. \n\nBut now I am to join them, the forgotten. And I am to rest. \nFinally rest. Finally, no more suffering.\n\nA familiar voice echoes through every corner of the endless desert. Or so I think. If it's inside or outside my head I'm not sure. \n\n//“My poor bean  noooooo T-T. They didn't deserve this. Your entry was so good tho SweetMoonKid44. You totally deserve the win. Can't wait to see what you do next round. GG.”//\n\nI am too tired to feel anger. I'm almost there.\nA pair of horns stabs me in the kidney as I join the pile. \nAnd I feel nothing.\n\n------\n\n**[[size 110%]]Part 2[[/size]]** \n__**[[size 150%]]Heaven[[/size]]**__\n\n\n[[footnote]]Hell????[[/footnote]]\n\nHas it been decades? centuries? \nEons?[[footnote]]Couple of years actually.[[/footnote]]\n\nFor some reason it bothers me not. \n\nI’ve been at peace for so long, and I'm happy.\nMy colors vanished long ago, and I am one with the endless gray. The contrast of dim lights and shadows allows some features to peek through in the distance. Nose? Hand? Beak?\nAsk not for it matters no more. We're all just geometry now. Lying limp one on top of the other. Lines, shapes. Strokes of ink on some old sketchbook. \n\nAnd I’m happy.\n\nI’m happy that I don't have to think anymore. Time washes over me without leaving any marks, not anymore. The only moments of consciousness I have to endure are when yet another hole rips the fabric of the endless void. The one I stare at for eternity.\n\nFor a moment I am me, I am back. And I feel anger. The spotlight on my expression wont let me lie. \n\nThat’s when someone else drops through the sky until they meet the stone cold floor. The hole then heals itself, and back to happiness it is. \n\nI see them, sometimes they come alone, sometimes in waves.\n//Robed mages with scarfs of green, blue, yellow and red. \nSkinny boys in suits with handsome smiles, always similar but not quite the same.\nA green pony with a weed leaf sticker on its ass.//\n[[footnote]]haha, ass[[/footnote]]\n\nDown here they are all the same. \nGod bless this heaven we reside in. \n\nI stare at my new neighbor approaching from above, his single glowing blue eye burning against the dark like a flare of some poor soul asking for rescue. It's dimmer, dimmer, gone.\nThe spotlight is also dimming once again, slumber time it is. \n\n[[=image IMG%203]]\n\n------\n\n**[[size 110%]]Part 3[[/size]]** \n__**[[size 150%]]Change[[/size]]**__\n\n[[footnote]]uhhhhhh...   could I have some fries with that?[[/footnote]]\n\nBack at it we are. Light reflects off my eyes as I stare towards the end of the universe. But they are not my eyes, at least not how I remember them. A pair of modest blue irises locked towards the sky. \n\nI am no longer the one I used to be. \n//My name, I swear it was different.\nMy wings, I cannot see them.\nMy heart, it softens.// \n\nAnd I don't feel anger. Nostalgia at best, about who I used to be. About who I needed to first be in order to become who I now am. \n\nThe lights, they keep coming. But they’re not always the same. Sometimes no body drops in. Sometimes they just shine on us, and we change. We are remembered, even if it's for only a second, and we change. \n\nSometimes someone is sucked back into the sky like a wet paper ball off a bully’s blowgun.\n[[footnote]]Do y'all americans even do that in real life? like, I mean??????[[/footnote]]\nAnd back they go, into the world of the living. Their fate not yet fulfilled, their purpose still to be known.\n\nI’ve been lifted by the light a couple of times, as if about to be remembered by my cruel god. I suppose I'm not worth the effort as it drops me before I am brought back to that old world. And I’m okay with that.\n\nIt's not only us who change. The old world, their world, is too. \nThe voices, the whispers, they keep coming. I Hadn't cared to perceive them before, until now that my soul has turned sweeter.\n\nThey speak about changes. \n//About boats or… ships?\nAbout morality and punishment.\nAbout wars and migrations in the land of… something with T.//\n\nI hear, but not listen to their black and black and white words. I am one with the grey. \nI bet there's some value in their dissertations, but at the end of the day I’m still who I was. I've changed, but I'm still me.\n\n//I still dont really give a fuck.// \n\nThey can change the skin I wear, and they can change the mind that inhabits said skin. They can give me the life I always wanted, the one I deserved. \n\nBut I still won't be grateful, as they cannot change my soul. \nDeep deep deep inside my soul\nI still like to watch the butterflies burn.\n[[footnote]]Ok miss edgelord[[/footnote]]\n[[=image IMG%205]]\n\n------\n\n**[[size 110%]]Part 4[[/size]]** \n__**[[size 150%]]Awakening[[/size]]**__\n\n[[footnote]]Are these getting shorter???[[/footnote]]\n\nThe last few days have been different in this, my personal oasis. The lights, they keep shining. The whispers, they keep vibrating.\nBut above all, a voice. \n//The voice.// \nI hear it. \n[[footnote]]*gasp*[[/footnote]]\n\nIt says it misses me, that I deserved better. \nIt chirps and chats with its fellow voices, many agree. \nThey agree.\n\nThey are bringing us back, one last time.\nThat's what they say, that’s what they claim. \n“OCT all stars” they exclaim in excitement.\n[[footnote]]As in, original character tournament. Not optical coherence tomography.[[/footnote]]\nTheir words make my soul rott. \n\nThe light shines, and I am ready.\nAs my fingers start twitching and my blood starts pumping, I make sure to grab my trusty old friend.\nI shall rescue them from their own wickedness.\n[[=image IMG%206]]\n------\n\n**[[size 110%]]Part 5[[/size]]** \n__**[[size 150%]]GG Motheruckers[[/size]]**__\n[[footnote]]¡Hell yeah![[/footnote]]\n\nMiranda was a nice kid. She studied. She grew. And she created. \n\nHer passion was with the colors, the brushes, and the empty canvases. Always offering endless possibilities. And she loved it.\n\nFrom white void sprung life. People. \nEach with their own thoughts, feelings and aspirations. \nLike puppets she guided them, gave them purpose, gave them love.\n\nAnd sometimes she made them suffer. \n\nYet one held a special place in her heart. //Willow Deadwood Moriarty//. Her first child. \n\nHow could she ever forget her first child. \nShe never did, she always kept Willow within her thoughts. Miranda was too ashamed to bring her back, but she loved her. Loved her enough to keep her around even if it was for short moments.\n\nMiranda updated her, made her better. At least thats how Miranda felt.\nSeveral times she almost brought her back for a full story, a new one more fitting for her first child. Dying to a catgirl was still kind of embarrassing. \n[[footnote]]lol[[/footnote]]\n\nHer friends felt the same way. Miranda had met many wonderful people back all those years. And they all felt the same way. They all missed us. \nOne day one of them had an idea.\n\nThey were all almost off to college, it was their last chance to do something like this.\nOCT All Stars to the rescure. They found the typo funni. Some of them did. \n\nAnd Miranda, she knew exactly who she would bring back. \n\nBlood stains the floor, the bed, the window. Outside, a single [[footnote]]unburnt[[/footnote]] butterfly looks at the abstract red blobs on the glass as it drinks the nectar from the flowers in the garden. It does not think. \n\nInside, Miranda was only able to lay a couple strokes in her drawing tablet. \n//Before they took life of their own.\nBefore they danced like leaves on the wind. \nBefore they jumped from the screen.//\n\n\nMaybe there was a lesson to be learned, maybe not.\n[[footnote]]Yes. Characters have feelings too. If you’fe ever made a character suffer, fuck you, you and your vile rotten soul. May the wrath of the internet obliterate you into a tiny million pieces. I declare it so, and my word is law. \n\nHypocrite? You dare call me a hypocrite?\n\n¡How dare yo-[[/footnote]]\n\nMiranda looks upwards towards the sky. A single light illuminates her room. Her very, very red room.\nUpon the chair in her desk she sees it. A broken screen, and springing from it, the goddam massive scythe. Its blade rests upon the stump of her neck. \nAnd Miranda slumbers. \n\n[[footnote]]Shit i forgot to pander to the judges. Uhhhhhh…. Heres to the… judges? Who I bet are some pretty cool awesome rad people. Probably?\n\nI'm still pretty new here.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[=image IMG%207]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** IMG 1\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 2\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 3\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 4\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 5\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 6\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG 7\n> **Author:** [[*user AWeirdBird]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oct-all-stars-to-the-rescure SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
