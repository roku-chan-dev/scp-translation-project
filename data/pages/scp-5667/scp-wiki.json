I am not life yet. \n\n(//The hook wraps around a chair leg, pulling it backwards. Marlow yelps.//) \n\n{{**THE MONSTER:**}} Form without feature, poreless skin, hairless fur, teethless maws, sightless sockets. I forgot; everyone forgets. I, which everyone forgets, that which nobody recalls; reimbued with form. Form without feature, features I must attain. \n\n(//The hook scrapes towards the front of Marlow, the greenlight sickening the color of his skin as it halts.

Marlow wheezes.//) \n\n{{**THE MONSTER:**}} A hook, a hook to catch, to take, to entice. Monster, monster.

Vivid memories become vague, too long ago to muster. Ripped apart, insipid fragments tossed to the floor. The chair creaks, cracks, the chair, the chair, go to the chair Marlow. Go to the chair Marlow and think about what you've done -- Here's your wedding gift, don't you remember it? The chair, oh, the chair. Why you're welcome, I know how much you loved it -- Marlow, why'd you take his last name? How could you -- Go to the chair Marlow.
