I have studied intelligence and espionage fairly extensively throughout university, writing my senior thesis on intelligence analysis. This tale is essentially an attempt to write up a good spy story in the world of the SCP Foundation.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed it!\n\n> **__Conspiracy__:**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Prologue | Prologue]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part I| Part I]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part II| Part II]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part III| Part III]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part IV| Part IV]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part V| Part V]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part VI| Part VI]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part VII| Part VII]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part VIII| Part VIII]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part IX| Part IX]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part X| Part X]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part XI| Part XI]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Part XII| Part XII]]]**\n> * **[[[Conspiracy, Epilogue| Epilogue]]]**",
