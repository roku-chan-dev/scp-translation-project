I trail just behind him, guarding our rear. We only have to kill a half-dozen guards before we're out. The plane is waiting for us, and we hurry up the steps. The door swings shut behind us.\n> \n> There are eleven people waiting inside—plus Kronos and I, that's an even 13. An appropriate number. Another person would give a speech, inspire their followers to greatness; I just nod to them, and slide into the cockpit. Kronos takes the copilot's seat.\n> \n> \"So. Where are we going?\"\n> \n> I give the voice a moment to tell me, but it's silent. I shrug. We'll figure it out once we're in the air. As we take off, I activate the explosives, and the site below us goes up in flames. The Chaos Insurgency is born.\n\n[[span style=\"font-size:75%\"]]////[[/span]]\n\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Table of Contents]]\n\n= **Prime Sequence**\n= //There's a hole in my head.
