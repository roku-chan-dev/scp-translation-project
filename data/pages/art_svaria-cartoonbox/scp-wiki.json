The last log elevates it to a whole other level -- it's atmospheric, it has amazing imagery and talent put behind its visuals, and it stands as probably the best I've ever read. I absolutely //had// to draw it for myself.\n\nA lot of what I drew here is very informed by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-pastarasta1-art-page-experience-rise-of-the-revenge-of-r|pastarasta's art]]]. It's unabashedly cartoony: stretched-out ovals for eyes and heads, and highly exaggerated perspective and colors. I thought it was a perfect fit to create a disorienting mood for the piece. [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch|Munch's art]]], and a lot of other expressionists, also had their hand in inspiring this work. I absolutely admire their messy yet attentive approach to textures (have for some time) and employed some of that in this work. \n\nI had a lot of fun with this! Really loved tackling pastarasta's style here; it's really neat and fun and I'm glad I got to do it. Thanks to Pasta as well as Clay and Jackal for writing 6080!\n\n(You can find my very old stuff [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/barredowl-s-kick-ass-art-page|here]]].
