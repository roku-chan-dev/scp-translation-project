Okay, you two have fun!

Ah, so, the central concept at play here is the vast difference between those who make media and those who consume it.  Authors design the content, audiences consume it.  Easy right?  Well, there’s more to it.  If you want to consume media intelligently – or create media with the intent of it being consumed intelligently – the art is important.  What do I mean by art?  I mean the coding and implanting of meaning in your media, of course.  It can get messy.}}\n\n//[Lillihammer raises her hand.]//\n\n**Presenter-Alpha**: {{What?

She introduces herself as Herbacious Willoughby.]//\n\n**Presenter-Beta**: Meaning is easy: what the author intends the media to say, and how it could be interpreted. We don’t really need to belabor that point I think.  Now, the important thing to understand about messages is that the medium matters. What form is your media taking? A novel, a radio show, a dark ritual of Saranür, a podcast, a film – each has its own positives and negatives regarding the communication of the meaning you as media providers will intend.\n\n//[Wettle clears his throat and just starts speaking at a loud volume.]//\n\n**Wettle**: What was that middle one you mentioned?\n\n**Presenter-Beta**: Radio show.

During this period the images on entity's screens depict war, disease, poverty, and common violence.]//\n\n**Wettle**: Jeez, someone get him a lozenge.\n\n**Lillihammer**: Where would you put it?\n\n**Presenter-Gamma**: EXCUSE ME, MY ALLERGIES HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE ALL WEEK.

What, you think the Marvel movies are reinforcing the military industrial complex and making heroes outta billionaires because the source material says so?  Media is there to communicate ideas, and the best way for someone to do that is to encode that media with a forced compulsion to the audience to do what they want.\n\n//[Willoughby takes a sip of water and gargles for thirty seconds.]//\n\n**Presenter-Beta**: You gotta be on your guard when you’re checking out the competition. You don’t want that memetic cluster you spent weeks – and literal pints of blood – on for that Viagra commercial to get mixed up with Warner’s new compulsion to start a cannibalistic cell of Randian philosophy just because you weren’t paying attention.
