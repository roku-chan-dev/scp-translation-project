Quintopolis Magazine gave the track three stars out of four and praised its \"East Coast-style, stripped down production\" by DJ QuInn and the lyrics by TK StarLyte, but wasn't thrilled with the unusual numbers of bars in each verse, saying the layout was \"a violation\" and \"lacked the highest transcendence\" expected from \"true Five Cities rap\".//||\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 58%; padding: 0 2%; border: 2px dashed\"]]\n[Intro: Gospodin]\n\nTake mind and worldview and adjust\nTake heed that starstuff is above us\nuh, come on\nStarLyte, bring it in, man\n\n[Verse 1: TK StarLyte]\n\nJust rebuff the inimitable and despicable\ncynical and traditional, Biblical and unlivable\nwicked world governmental and digital individuals\nspitting full mythic mythical lyrics of unthinkable\nbigots and biggest bullshit distributors on this spherical\npinnacle of people making themselves miserable; it's a\nmirror realm of a horror show; fictions dwell all among us though\nfearful of human predators needing to feel full control\nfearful of people preaching to reach the top of the totem pole\nfearful of lethal keepers, machinists eager to take the soul\nfearful of fearsome criminal elements up in sterile developments\nup in underground cellars and it's difficult quelling distress\namong all the spirits that miss people defending it\ninstead of doctor vultures experimenting and rending it\ninstead of directors attempting bidding, buying and selling it\ninstead of the heretics bending, blending and ending it\ninstead of the rebels recruiting, wasting, expending it\ninstead of isolationist Meccans pretending penitence\nAccept befriending the spirit and transcending\na mending of five descended directions I'm recommending so --\n\n[Hook]\n\nTake mind and worldview and then adjust\nTake heed that starstuff is above us\nDismiss the visible physical, put the lyrical syllable\nin your geopolitical, and become dust\n\nTake mind and worldview and then adjust\nDo not breathe, our brothers are still among us\nBelie the pitiful mimics inside of hidden positions\nIgnore the timidest critics, and become dust\ndust, dust, dust\n\n[Verse 2: Gospodin]\n\nFifthist visions can christen the spirit fearless\nand squish the predispositions to seek the angels and villains\nand witness the living divisions riddling men and women\nand form the kind of religion needed to free from prison\nthe part of the spirit that listens; do not feel forgiven\nif forgiveness is the precondition already written; if\nthe crime committed is thinking and acting without supervision \nand submission is the only disposition that helps\nFind a prophet with a message and no product to sell\nGive a minute of commitment while a messenger tells\nof the stellar body dwellers with celestial shells\nand the protection that they offer from the curse in our cells\nYou cannot wake up; this is the world as it exists\nYou can't look away in dismay when the orbitals twist\nAs the planet turns and swivels, dunking into the mist\nLet your body turn to vapor, let the spirit persist\n\n[Hook: TK StarLyte and Gospodin]\n\nTake mind and worldview and then adjust\nTake heed that starstuff is above us\nDismiss the visible physical, put the lyrical syllable\nin your geopolitical, and become dust\n\nTake mind and worldview and then adjust\nDo not breathe, our brothers are still among us\nBelie the pitiful mimics inside of hidden positions\nIgnore the timidest critics, and become dust\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 31%; padding: 0 2%; border: 2px dashed\"]]\n\n//The hook relates to traditional Five Cities themes of transcendence from the horrors of the streets into celestial harmony.//\n\n _\n _\n\n> Biblical and unlivable\n//Lyricist TK StarLyte was asked whether the track laid down here was supposed to be anti-Christian in particular, given the reference to the Bible. StarLyte responded \"Base texts, baby. Ain't level to be spoken about. No tucks.\"//\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n> directors attempting bidding, buying and selling it\n//TK StarLyte's stance on companies profiting from natural miracles in this world is well documented, given his 1999 arrest for conspiracy to commit arson along with four other Five Cities enthusiasts at Darke Plaza in New York.//\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n> squish the predispositions to seek the angels and villains\n//Fifth Family's emcee Gospodin wrote this shortly after becoming the director of the Lower East Side Five Cities Truth Center in Manhattan. His philosophy on Fifthism was particularly targeted towards a \"moral gray zone\", with no clearly defined good or evil in the world. Even the Celestial Ascendance supported by Five Cities advocates wasn't immune in Gospodin's eyes, who described it as \"one journey among many, all beings once smoke must burn high, but feel no love for the road.\"//\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
