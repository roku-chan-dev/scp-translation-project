All other written material in relation to the project was lost or destroyed.  The remaining records are presented in chronological order.\n\n> **Subject No.:** 139\n> \n> **Name:** Stephen Moore\n> \n> **Administered:** RS-Amrita A.16 - standard dosage. Delivery: intravenous. Action: anti-apoptotic.\n> \n> **Time elapsed:** 174 days\n> \n> **Observations:** Skin samples indicate thickening of cell membranes and accelerated production of corneocytes. Keratin filament network appears to be based on a recombinant keratin variant, with increased strength and resilience and reduced elasticity. Rate of desquamation reduced to 20% of normal levels.\n\n> **Subject No.:** 188\n> \n> **Name:** Susan Parker\n> \n> **Time elapsed:** 235 days\n> \n> **Observations:** Metabolism has decreased to extremely low levels. Red blood cells exhibit greatly increased oxygen storage capacity, resulting in slower blood flow and increased muscle endurance.\n\n> **Subject No.:** 127\n> \n> **Name:** Michael Taubman\n> \n> **Time elapsed:** 282 days\n> \n> **Observations:** Genetic sequencing shows evidence of reduction in telomere shortening. No observable symptoms or health benefits.  Subject reports RS-Amrita \"tastes like blood\".\n\n> **Subject No.:** 85\n> \n> **Name:** <//illegible//>\n> \n> **Time elapsed:** 301 days\n> \n> **Observations:** Subject rendered spontaneously immobile and non-responsive. No observable respiration or heart rate. Body unable to be moved or manipulated. Cause unclear.\n\n> **Subject No.:** 71\n> \n> **Name:** Captain Raymond Lewis\n> \n> **Administered:** RS-Amrita B.21 - standard dosage. Delivery: intravenous. Action: <//paper torn//>\n> \n> **Time elapsed:** 370 days\n> \n> **Observations:** Subject's health remains stable. Blood results clear. Subject reports increased alertness, vigor and sense of well-being.\n> \n> Abnormal bone growth in mandible, maxillary and zygomatic regions appears to have stabilised, and remains typical for B.21 patients. Subject reports no major discomfort.\n> \n> Results of physical testing are attached.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Interview transcript]]\n\n**Project Amrita - Interview 071-005**\n \n__Date:__ 26 April 1947\n\n__Present:__ \n* O5-1\n* Amrita Test Subject 71 (Raymond Lewis)\n* Lt. Charles Taylor (MTF Alpha-1)\n\n> **O5-1:** Morning, Ray.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Good morning, sir - ha, sorry.  Taylor, good to see you.\n> \n> **Taylor:** Good morning, sir.\n> \n> **O5-1:** You can wait outside if you wish, Taylor.\n> \n> **Taylor:** I'm afraid not, sir.  Protocol for interaction with test subjects.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Even him?  Okay.  Scotch, Ray?\n> \n> **Lewis:** I don't think they'll allow it, unfortunately.\n> \n> **O5-1:** They don't have to know.  No?  All right then.  So how are you feeling?  The team tell me that the latest course is going well.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Sure is.  Since your last visit, they've changed the formula slightly, and I swear I can feel it.  No side effects, other than a bit of an ache in my jaw.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I can see the bruising.  Do they know what that is?\n> \n> **Lewis:** Something about bone density or cartilage elasticity - they don't tell me much.  Surprised you can't enlighten me.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Sometimes I think they don't want to disappoint me with any bad news.  It's why I keep coming to talk to you, to see for myself.  That, and the pleasure of your company, of course.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Ha.  Charming as always.  Well my company should be pleasant - I'm feeling pretty great.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Really?  You're sure?\n> \n> **Lewis:** Absolutely.  I'm sleeping soundly, the scores on my physicals are up, and I haven't run five miles this quick since I was thirty-five.  They've let me train with some of the Alpha-1 boys, and I'm not far off the pace - at my age!  \n> \n> **O5-1:** You'll show those kids who's boss yet.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Well, whatever they've got me on, it's working.\n> \n> **O5-1:** You might have a couple less grey hairs, too.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Might be.  So, what's keeping you busy?\n> \n> **O5-1:** Oh, you know, the usual worries.  All memetics at the moment.  Nothing on the K-scale, but we just lost two good researchers to mercury poisoning.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Sorry to hear that.\n> \n> **O5-1:** What?  Oh, that's okay.  It's just the work seems to get more and more dangerous.\n> \n> **Lewis:** We're doing the right thing though.  We are achieving greatness.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I know, but - I shouldn't have asked you to do this.  It's too risky.\n> \n> **Lewis:** We knew that when we started.  It will be worth it.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I'm not sure.  Look, I shouldn't really tell you this, but - there's been an issue with one of the other Amrita subjects.  He - \n> \n> **Lewis:** His name was Thomson, right?  Yes, I've heard about it.  \n> \n> **O5-1:** <//exhales//> Then you'll ask to drop out of the project?\n> \n> **Lewis:** No!  Sorry sir, but I signed up for this, and I want to see it through.\n> \n> **O5-1:** But you've seen him - what it did.\n> \n> **Lewis:** That's a different batch, though.\n> \n> **O5-1:** On the same project, the same theories.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Theories that I'm proving!  Don't tell me you've ceased to believe in them?\n> \n> **O5-1:** It's not that.  But I have doubts -\n> \n> **Lewis:** Doubts?  Another word for cowardice!  Maybe I should -\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ray, you know that's not - \n> \n> **Lewis:** - that's easy for you to say when -\n> \n> <//cross talk, unintelliglble//>\n> \n> **Lewis:** - better off dying!\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ray!  That's exactly what - exactly ...\n> \n> <//silence//>\n> \n> **Taylor:** Sir?  Are you all right, sir?\n> \n> **Lewis:** I'm sorry.  You and me, we'll figure it out.  That's what we do.  That's why we're here.  Sir, you know - <//silence, 3 seconds//> - you know they would want you to keep going.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I hope so.  Yes.  You're right, of course.  Thanks for reminding me.  I just worry - I guess I'm getting old.\n> \n> **Lewis:** Well, someone has to.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ha.  Thanks, Ray.  See you next time?\n> \n> **Lewis:** I'll be here.\n> \n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Incomplete medical records - 1947 (continued)]]\n\n**Medical Records - Site 19 - Project Amrita**\n\n[[=image scan4.PDF width=650px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan12.PDF width=650px]]\n@@@@\n[[=image scan3.PDF width=650px]]\n@@@@\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/psul-001/offset/7 |Open next file ...]]]\n[[/>]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[module css]]\n.computed {\nborder: 1px black solid;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.computed:before {\ncontent:\"Computed Code\";\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.rawcode {\nborder: black solid 1px;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.rawcode:before{\ncontent:\"Raw Code\";\ntext-align: center;\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.codebox {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nwidth: 100%;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a em,  .yui-navset .yui-nav a em{\npadding: 0.25em .75em; \ntop: 0px;\nmargin-bottom: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected {\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:focus, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:hover, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a, .yui-navset .yui-navset-top .yui-nav a {\nbackground-color: none;\nbackground-image: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a {\nbackground: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav li{\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-content {\nbackground-color: #FDFCF9; \n}\n[[/module]]",
