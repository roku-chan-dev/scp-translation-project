For the preservation of normalcy, Jones is to observe extra vigilance regarding romantic occasions, family dinners, and moderate social gatherings of 3-7 people.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7951 is the designation for the spontaneous physical manifestation of two coffee mugs within the personal home of Researcher Paul Jones.\n\nSCP-7951-1 is a nondescript ceramic mug invariably filled with a black tea beverage at or below 23 degrees Celsius. Subjects who perceive SCP-7951-1 believe that the liquid inside is \"not how they like their tea\" and upon tasting the beverage will note that it is \"too cold\" in addition to a series of other subjective qualitative notes. The exception to this is Researcher Paul Jones, who says that the liquid inside is \"exactly how [he likes] it.\"\n\nSCP-7951-2 is empty.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7951 was discovered in the home of Researcher Paul Jones shortly after the finalization of inheritance proceedings on 10/15/2023.
