Be it alchemical, thaumaturgic or memetic, these vessels of meaning lay at the edge of normalcy and the anomalous.//\n//Anyone can draw an image, but creating one that can peer beyond the Veil would barely take more than an accident. Suffice to say, [[[scp-3007|it has probably happened before]]].//\n\n//That's is why we're here: to control this aspect of humanity that has always been, and will continue to be, a part of our reality.//\n//Welcome to the Division - we still have about 100,000 years' worth of backlog to draw from.//\n\n[[=]]\n//Secure.
