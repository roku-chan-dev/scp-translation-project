The Greatest Journey\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n**NARRATOR:**\nHere begins a tale\nAbout a journey towards salvation\nNot by mercy or ascetism\nBut through earthly liberation\nIt starts in a great town\nWhere a young man did dwell\nHis people in enslaved\nToiling day after day\n\nHe, himself was a servant\nBorn from a sick and dying mother\nCleaning great halls all day\nNever even knowing his father\n\n**ION:**\nOh, what do they mean?\nThese tales of forests, mountains, rivers and borders?\nWhat lies beyond this city's quarters?\nWhat lies beyond these great walls?\nWhat is this \"freedom\" other slaves speak of?\n\n**NARRATOR:**\nAnd so the young man awoke, in the dead of night\nLooking at the guard of his cell, asleep in the moonlight\nHis key was just within the reach\nThen did, his cell, the young man breach!\n\n**ION:**\nRunning through the halls\nPast all these other souls\nSome asleep or broken and wrought\nBut none of them dare to make a sound\nIt's time to scale up these walls and become unbound!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"2. From the Urals, Towards the World\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n**ION:**\nOut in the wilderness is my new home\nWithout priestesses or masters, alone\nBut soul cries black \nMy eyes weep red\nFor my kin's still enslaved,\nIn the deva's pit\nForlorn my hope, at an end my wit\nI need assistance, from above\nTo give my people their peace and love\n\n\n**NARRATOR:**\nWith spirits high and his hopes higher\nThe young man ascended up a mountain's side\nIn search of a being of infinite might\nFor he knew the highest god couldn't dwell down below\nOtherwise, he would have already defeated his foe\n\n**ION:** \nI call on to thee, tell me what will suffice\nWhat kind of devotion and what sacrifice?\nFor you to come down from the celestial abode\nTo free my people and bring them hope\n\n**NARRATOR:** \nAnd as he called, so did the skies split\nAnd from a rift, appeared a great beast\nWith thousands of eyes, in which was not love\nWith a body of a snake and maw of a lion\n\n**VAŽJUMA:**\nWho is thy, who calls for my name?\nTell me, human, for what do you aim? \nLooking for mercy, from the sky\nYou do this-why?\n\nKnow, that this world was arranged\nWhat it is, won't change\nNo matter what pieces you exchange\nTell my, why is your request so strange?\n\n**ION:**\nI cannot believe my ears \nYou made this world, as it is?\nThe suffering, hierarchy and ills\nWas designed just like beautiful hills\nTell me, oh, what is the reason\nFor a society full of death and treason?\n\n**VAŽJUMA:**\nKnow, I am the sum of all\nWhich was created, man or god\nThe one who made the limits so this order will not fall!\nThis world, static, is right\nA class must always rise\nWhile others are pulverised!\nThis is the will of me\nThe highest divinity\nFrom now unto infinity\n\n**NARRATOR:**\nBut the young man stood defiant, looking straight at its face\nHis lips parted, and with confidence, he said\n\n**ION:**\nThen I reject this space!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"3.
