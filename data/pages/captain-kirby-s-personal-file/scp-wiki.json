hide=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nWriting this a few years after having posted SCP-5552 feels weird, I haven't updated my commentary though since 2018 so I figured 5 years late is better than never.\n\nI work in academia — I wrote this article while I was at the tail end of my undergraduate degree about to start a master's and now I am doing my PhD. This is all to say, I have had a lot of experience with the process of writing papers. You take months and months of work that you put into something and condense it down into 12 incredibly technical pages, and its this capsule that represents the past 6 months or so of your life. It's this very personal thing. It shows that you, not only invented something new, but you understand it at a very deep level. \n\nIn addition to this though, I have been writing for a long time. And when I write, I tend to write pieces where the point is the message/theme/character arc that I am portraying. I don't write a ton of world building or lore for my works, and instead focus on character dynamics and having engaging emotional beats. However, this often results in readers looking at a piece of mine and trying to pick a part literal meanings and concrete details where I have explicitly left them unexplained, because unlike in a research paper, the explanation isn't important. \n\nSCP-5552 to me lives at the cross section of explaining these two ideas — that there is joy and pride to be taken in creating and inventing something all on your own, and that not everything you don't understand needs to be understood. People love figuring things out, it makes them feel smart and clever, but sometimes the pursuit of the \"right answer\" means you're missing the forest for the trees. SCP-5552 is about getting so up close and personal, inspecting the bark, taking sap samples, that you get lost in the forest, and never find your way out.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3393\" hide=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nYes, I did beat everyone to using \"[[[SCP-3393|You are the anomaly]]]\" as an opener. And yes it did work. \n\nComing up with this idea was weird. It was like 3am and I was just about to fall asleep when this skip struck me. Just the idea of using documentation as bait was what I started with. I wrote like the first few paragraphs right then. \n\nThe next morning I finished the skip and started shipping it around for crit. Posted it three days later.\n\nThe neat part about this is that it allows me to break the fourth wall, without //really// breaking the fourth wall. This article is addressed to the reader, but the in-universe reader. That's more-or-less how I was able to get away with such a heavily meta article. It's really hard to hold suspension of disbelief when you tell the reader they are an anomaly, but that's because in-universe it makes sense.\n\nAlso, this format screw is deceivingly simple. Usually, I find that containment procedures are really hard to write because most SCPs that I write about don't require anything too fancy. They have to be practical, yet interesting or short. But instead of using the procedures as the hook here, I can use them as a climax, which just about no other article does (that I know of). So yeah... I'm pretty proud of it. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3511\" hide=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nAll she wants is a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3511 hug].\n\nSo, IRL I tend to shy away from physical contact. Hugs feel unnatural, kisses just don't happen for me. Even when I've had an SO I'm very non-physical. That was my main inspiration for this skip though - what people would feel like if they //never// had physical contact.\n\nOriginally this skip was about a girl who teleported to a random place whenever someone got close to her, but that didn't give me as much room to work with. I felt like this simpler anomaly (credit to DarkStuff for helping me come up with it) is more relatable. \n\nAlso, at first this was supposed to be a sad article all throughout. No happy ending, just a girl who would never be hugged again. But then I realized that if I give this a happy ending, I could turn this into a very high quality fake-out. I'm a big believer in the idea that \"Every Skip Needs A Twist\", and by setting my audience up to think this was going to be a sad skip where the girl dies at the end, I could turn the trope on its head and have a happy ending \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-016-J\" hide=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nIt's a [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-016-j dick joke]. What else is there to say?\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3123\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nWelcome to [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3123 Towin], the town where insults cut deep. Literally.\n\nIt will take me a long time to out do this one. I had an idea for a novel a number of years back of a variant of this idea. When I realized it'd work well as a skip, I immediately jumped on it. I think that rationalizing the murder of children is terrifying, and I'm happy I made it work. I have other head canon for exactly how the anomaly works, and other details, but I think keeping this relatively short is important.\n\nThis went through about 20 beta-reads. Each one was invaluable.\n\nSo, I guess a story from this is that its hard to get too much crit. But also be wary that at some point, you're at the point of diminishing returns, and you just gotta trust yourself.\n\nAlso, I'll let you in on a little secret... I didn't know what \"fridge horror\" was until //after// I posted this. Learn something new with every article!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3203\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nI tried to do a format screw, and I ended up with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3203 A Swiss Bank Account].\n\nThis one I have found is a great experiment in #NoCanon. You can read this article in so many different ways depending on your view of the world. I have my own personal answer to \"What's in production\", but I like the idea of letting the reader come up with something on their own. \n\nFun fact: This went from concept to mainlist in just over 30 hours. Now... this has not made for the //best// story I've written, but I'm still happy enough with it to keep it up.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3305\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nThe story of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3305 The Father, The Son, and The Holy Toast]\n\nThis is by far the stupidest thing I've ever written. And it is also one of my favorites. It was originally inspired by /r/BreadStapledToTrees and it turned into an excuse to write a christian allegory about bread. This is also proof that, stupid can totally work on this site. Because that's what this is: gloriously stupid.\n\nAlso fun fact: the first picture I used for this site was given to me by someone who claimed to have taken the picture himself, but about an hour later I was told he just found it online. So I had to call up a friend of mine with a stapler at 10 at night to go staple some bread to a tree so I could get a CC picture.\n\n**A Note About Comedy SCPs:** Just because the SCP itself attempts to be silly or funny does not mean that it does not belong on the main list. It is of my //personal// opinion that any type of SCP works as long as it is well written and entertaining (baring some exceptions). If I made you smile or laugh while reading this SCP, then I've done my job, and the same goes for any comedic SCP like [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3740 3740] or [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3304 3304]. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3650\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3650 Wanderlust] is one of my favorite serious SCPs I've written.\n\nI came up with the idea when I was listening to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no1fTRaCkeM Wanderlust Reprise by Renard]. I don't listen to much of his music, but I like this song, and it gave me the idea for an SCP based on the idea of getting people to go places. Then I looked through some old vacation photos and found some suitably creepy ones when I turned on enough filters. The rest of it just kinda happened.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Spoilers/My Headcanon for Wanderlust\" close=\"Close Headcanon\"]]\n\nI know that there is some speculation on what actually is going on, so while I believe the only canon that matters is your personal headcanon, I'm still going to share mine with you. Because I wrote it. \n\nThe photos were originally taken of Rem Z. while she was on her honey moon with Earnest Glint, and Rem wrote the haikus to go with the photos so she could remember the moment clearer. When Earnest killed Rem, she disappeared from the photos, and began to haunt those who'd look at them, asking them to bring her things. She feels like she had been cheated out of life, and doesn't like being alone with the pictures.\n\n# [The Dog] Rem missed her dog from being alive\n# [The Clock] Rem wanted more time to be alive. The D-Class represented time with a clock. Yeah, top tier symbolism. ikr?\n# [The Lovely Bones] Earnest was a writer, and she loved his stories. Also, the book is about a girl who is murdered, but still wanders the earth.\n# [The Suicide] Rem wanted someone to join her in the afterlife.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-3481\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3481 Glorious Sounds] is the first SCP I wrote.\n\nThe story wasn't very well fleshed out and I'm not going to try to explain it. Although I do want to keep it around because I'm pretty happy with the way I did the Interviews. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Tales\n\n[[collapsible show=\"A Eulogy in 11/8 Time\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nWhile this tale is based off the characters in UraniumEmpire's Trashfire canon, ultimately the story here is just using the characters and the setting to ground a story about self-acceptance. In general, people in our lives have expectations for us, and often times those expectations become the ones we have for ourselves. Eulogy in 11/8 time explores what happens when someone fails to live up to their own expectations, and how they come to that place. The moments in life that lead someone to both having high expectations for themselves, and failing to meet them.\n\nHowever, if you have read this tale you well know, this is not just a story of failure. Because ultimately, expectations are just that: what people expect. And not living up to expectations all the time is not an indictment on a person. This is something I have to remind myself quite often, and something I feel others need to remember too. That sometimes you are not set up to succeed. That failure can be an option. And that the people we have in our lives are with us not because of who they expect us to be, but because of who we are.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Fuck Metric\" close=\"Close Commentary\"]]\n\nThis one is deleted now, for two reasons:\n# In retrospect it wasn't as clever as I thought it was\n# I was worried that one lazy piece would reduce my reputation as an author more than it was worth to keep it.\n\nSure, it was funny enough to survive but... I want to do this joke justice, and 69 words wasn't doing it. Especially at the risk of being a detriment to people's opinion on my other, much more serious work. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab About Me]]\n\n+ Captain Kirby IRL\n\n//Disclaimer: Identifying Personal Information has been redacted for privacy and security concerns.//\n\nMy name is [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED] and I am a PhD student studying robotics at [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED]. I've been writing just stuff for years, and I've even self-published a novel (and will at some point self-publish a second one). My first collection of horror stories that I enjoyed were by H.P.

I was part of a FIRST Robotics Team when I was in high school called [PERSONAL INFORMATION REDACTED]. I write entirely as a hobby, because I would like to build and program robots for a living. Sure, that may sound like a first grader's answer to \"what do you want to be when you grow up\", but robots are still the goal.\n\nAlright... that's all I'm going to tell strangers on the internet. I hope you like reading my stuff! It's kinda flattering that anyone would even click on this part of my author page in the first place.\n\nThanks again for be at all interested in what I have to say.
