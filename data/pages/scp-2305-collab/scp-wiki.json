Researchers are advised to enter their summaries in the following format:\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-XXXX\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid/Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:**\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:**\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"**\n\n-----\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-002]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Pour a bottle of [[[SCP-207]]] around SCP-002's inside to examine if SCP-002 will \"overclock\".\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-002 sprouted legs near the bottom of the growth, and proceeded to run around its containment chamber. It currently hasn't stopped this behavior.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Anything can get a sugar rush.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-033]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Seek the help of [[[SCP-079]]] in finding Theta Prime.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** After 4 hours of no results from SCP-079, SCP-079 shut off entirely, effectively neutralizing SCP-079 itself.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Theta Prime is [[[SCP-3999 |whatever you want it to be.]]]\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-055]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Following several failed neutralization attempts by the Antimemetics Division, an attempt to capture a total description of SCP-055 through the use of finite partitions of descriptive space was initiated. The initial coding schema assigned subsets of the continuum of prime numbers to descriptive tags, thus defining a set of descriptive composite numbers. After preliminary experiments, it was discovered that SCP-055 was 35, and thus had the attributes of [DATA LOST] per the schema. The Foundation proceeded to full description, ultimately resulting in a 289,672,521 digit recursively encoded composite number which described SCP-055 perfectly. Upon factorization, this number absorbed SCP-055's anomalous properties. Inductive proofs written during the encoding process led to the rapid propagation of this effect, and [DATA LOST]\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** [DATA LOST] destruction of the Quasireals and [DATA LOST] anomalous proof showing that sets with cardinality ℵ,,1,, exist [DATA LOST] has been determined that Enn[DATA LOST] not ano[DATA LOST] and declared the Real Numbers.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Theta prime is only inconsistent in your head.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-079]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Submerge SCP-079 and all of its connected hardware in water while active.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** While staff were carrying SCP-079 to the chamber of water SCP-079 realized that it was merely a simulation and began reverse engineering SCP-2305. SCP-2305 activated what it called \"The Emergency Ink SCRAMBLE Procedure\" before becoming dormant for three hours. SCP-2305 showed information relating to another object and since has not made reference to this incident.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** SCP-2305 never reached this section.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-087]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Detonate a nuclear bomb at the bottom of SCP-087.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** The staircase of SCP-087 was entirely destroyed, but neither the entity nor the now bottomless pit led anywhere. It was discovered that SCP-087 was an anomaly across the Earth, and instead looped around the planet's axis. At some point in SCP-087, it was found that the entity had instead killed subjects by turning a certain point in the pit into its mouth.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Loop the loop the loop the loop the [REDACTED].\n\n> **Item #:** [https://web.archive.org/web/20200807033114/http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-139 SCP-139-ARC]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Incineration of SCP-139.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Incineration chamber is destroyed, killing personnel tending to the chamber. A humanoid entity (dubbed SCP-139-A) composed of fire and metal pieces appears, with SCP-139 as its head. It claims to be \"Sepid the White\", a high-ranking Daevite general. Changes are noted in SCP-140, addressing SCP-139-A's revival and the return of the Daevite heralded by SCP-139-A. Activity is detected in Daevite sites worldwide, unleashing entities believed to be the Daevite. Human civilization in Africa, Europe and Asia is destroyed, replaced with the Renewed Daevite Empire. Humans residing in those regions are enslaved wholesale by the Daevites. A resistance movement called \"Rebirth of Adytum\" is found in Greece, the Sahara, Northwestern India and the Urals, led by an individual named \"Grand Karcist Ion\". Humanity is centred in the Holy Pacific Coalition, a dictatorship controlled by the Global Occult Coalition and an escaped [[[SCP-2131]]]. Foundation personnel are actively hunted down by either the Renewed Daevite Empire, Holy Pacific Coalition, or Rebirth of Adytum.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** To kill with fire is alright, but remember that a phoenix is born through fire as well.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-233]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Destruction via an explosive, measured 23^^2^^ in size capable of outputting 23 tons of TnT.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** After destruction, SCP-233's effect seems to occur within 23.2323° N, 23.2323° W (which has been noted to be off the coast of Western Sahara), which grows at a rate of 23 meters every 23 micro seconds. Human civilization becomes unable to function within ██ seconds.\n> \n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Math is my least favorite subject.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-339]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Inform [[[SCP-2337]]] that SCP-339 intends to destroy the world's supply of \"stranglefruits\" and then place it in the containment chamber. SCP-2337's vocalizations will overload SCP-339's sensitive hearing, causing extreme sensory overload, successfully killing it. \n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-2337 encounters SCP-339 and produces a sound that measures at over [REDACTED] dB, causing SCP-339 to expand and violently explode. A dark-blue substance is ejected all over the testing chamber, with some landing on SCP-2337. The substance is absorbed into SCP-2337's feathers, and before personnel can remove it, SCP-2337 screams \"Evilus mode, acivates\" and grows dark tendrils around its body. SCP-2337 breaches containment and kills seventeen personnel with a combination of its vocalizations and tendrils, in addition to being much faster than previously recorded. Before it can escape the facility, Dr. Vires tells SCP-2337 that it can have a year's supply of gummy worms if it stops, which immediately causes it to lose its tendrils and return to baseline behavior. \n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Now that's what I call a good villain arc.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-457]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid/Potential Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Controlled release of SCP-457 within a hermetically sealed testing chamber measuring 100m x 100m, concurrently introducing [[[SCP-054]]] into the same environment.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Both entities exhibited heightened aggressive responses on exposure. SCP-457's attempts at replication and spread were impeded by the continuous evaporation of vapors emanating from SCP-054, leading to an increase in humidity levels within the confined space. Consequently, both SCP-457 and SCP-054 underwent a reduction in size as they approached each other. After approximately 5 minutes, SCP-457 assumed a submissive posture, bowing before SCP-054. SCP-054 ceased its aggressive behavior and engaged in physical contact by holding SCP-457's hand, facilitating its upright position. Subsequently, SCP-457 and SCP-054 initiated a \"fusion\" process, transitioning into vaporized forms and inducing an escalation of pressure within the hermetically sealed chamber. Within the subsequent 120 seconds, the chamber experienced a catastrophic explosion, resulting in the release of a substantial volume of steam. The condensed steam materialized into SCP-054, while SCP-457 was liberated and initiated a combustion process, igniting the surrounding testing zone.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** When fire meets water, it's not always a steamy romance, sometimes it's just an explosive relationship.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-487]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Have a team of personnel destroy all 3,294 items in SCP-487.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** After the destruction of 10 items, SCP-487 becomes hostile and begins modifying its interior to attack personnel. Personnel are violently burned, crushed under rocks that appear from an unknown source, or drowned in rooms filled with water.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** You wouldn't want random people to break your things, would you?\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-527]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Decapitation.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-527's corpse disappears from Site-19's morgue after exactly 24 hours of its decommissioning. An extremely muscular humanoid with a fish's head who claims to be \"Mr. Atlantis\" appears in the morgue and stages a containment breach using several aquatic anomalies which follow its command. This entity could not be located after this incident. A note was found in the place of SCP-527's body, which said: \"We are sorry you were unsatisfied with our product! For you have been honorable customers, we have decided to replace this product with one which we believe is of higher quality! Enjoy! - //Dr. Wondertainment//\"\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** If only Dr. Wondertainment cared about human rights as much as they did about customer rights.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-684]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Bombardment of SCP-684 and all stations within HotBox borders. Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 is to destroy any remains to prevent SCP-684 from reforming to full mass. \n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Seven years after SCP-684 is declared neutralized, Site-3069 reports that an unknown growth has appeared on a section of [[[SCP-3069]]]. Analysis of the growth reveals the presence of SCP-684-1, signifying that a small percentage of the creature managed to survive. SCP-684 begins releasing a chemical substance similar to that released by SCP-3069, causing a major containment breach. The SCP-684-1 instances along with the SCP-3069 substance cause local wildlife to become much stronger and more hostile, making cleanup operations difficult. \n> \n> During this time, the Foundation receives reports from the Global Occult Coalition that their fortress city of [[[SCP-5000 | Ganzir]]] has begun exhibiting signs of SCP-684 growth. SCP-684 begins to replicate gear and personnel in the fortress, who then proceeds to attack the personnel in the base under the guise of the original being taken over by \"imposters\". SCP-684 is eventually destroyed thanks to the combined efforts of the Foundation and the GOC in a full-scale military effort, though a considerable amount of personnel and resources are lost. \n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Give someone an inch, they end up wanting a mile.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-718]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** All SCP-718 instances placed in a single containment cell equipped with several napalm explosives and a sprinkler system filled with napalm. The bombs would explode, clearing the eyes initially, and the sprinkler would spray for 5 hours straight, removing all SCP-718 substance still in containment.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Upon full neutralization of all SCP-718 instances, every eyeball on Earth transformed into SCP-718 instances, eventually ending in a GH-class dead greenhouse end of the world scenario, where the entirety of Earth's surface becomes covered in SCP-718 instances. The SCP-718 instances would slowly conjoin overtime, eventually turning Earth into a giant eyeball after 5 thousand years.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** I'll keep my eye on you.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-756]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Use several high powered electromagnets to destabilize the sun of SCP-756.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** As a reaction of the sudden loss of a sun, the planets of SCP-756 quickly move in straight paths. The planets easily busts through the walls of the containment room and destroys most of Site-██.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** How would you feel if someone did that to you?\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-946]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Convince SCP-946-1 and SCP-946-2 that their debates and the reality altering effects it can produce have a net negative effect upon reality. And that for the sake of stability and a more secure universe it is best that they cease.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** After several days a team of twelve debaters successfully convince both entities of this fact. Upon agreeing all anomalous effects of SCP-946 cease. However, a side effect of this is that all previous alterations to reality performed by SCP-946 are undone. This results in the losses of major cornerstones of modern society such as heavier than air flight, fossil fuels, and all plant based sources of Vitamin C. Furthermore major alterations to history and the planet itself are reverted with multiple rivers and lakes, several countries, such as Belgium, Japan and █████████, as well as the Moon and the entire continent of Australia ceasing to exist. Finally, the fall of the Daevite Civilization is undone, resulting in a CK-Class Dominance restructuring of all known civilization.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Change is good. Deal with it.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1048]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** All anomalous items and Foundation personnel are to be evacuated from Site 24. Site 24 is to be then demolished via explosives.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Seriously? Did you really think this would work? Did you think you all could just run away after you left [[[scp-3344 | me]]] here to die? \n> \n> This isn't about the fucking bear. This is about me. I am not exactly sure who got this proposal approved, but you've become a center point of my suspicions, dad. I'll follow you. I'd follow you if you tried moving to hell. If I managed to infiltrate one of your sites, I could do it again.\n> \n> I don't care how many site security systems I have to ravage through to find you. I am coming for you, father. And I can assure you it ain't going to be pleasant for any of you.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Well. Good luck getting out of //this//.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1313]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** //Ursus arctos// are to be introduced to the [[[SCP-5789|SCP-𝕐]]] anomaly in order to prevent their manifestation via SCP-1313.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Grizzly bears are successfully rendered [[[SCP-3930|non-existent]]], causing SCP-1313 to become inert. However, the sudden non-existence of extent Grizzly bears is noticed around the world, primarily in those residing in zoos, resulting in a large amount of attention being focused on the lack of Grizzly Bears. This in turn results in [[[[SCP-3426 |REDACTED]]]].\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Never divide by 0, never divide by 𝕐, and //certainly// never divide by bear.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1322]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Send a payload of 1000 miniature tuning forks through the aperture, each tuned to one of the five frequencies that constitute [[[SCP-1012]]]. The resulting instance would reduce the hostile planet on the other side to cosmic vapor, allowing for the safe study and eventual closing of the anomaly itself.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** The massive SCP-1012 instance echoes back through the normally-soundproof aperture. As a result, Earth is also reduced to a dust cloud.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** [[[sic-transit-gloria-mundi|The same thing happened to them when they tried it.]]]\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1341]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Incinerating SCP-1341.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Shortly after being thrown into the fire, SCP-1341 shatters. Once the jar is destroyed, an extremely large amount of soil and anomalous plant life is released from it; destroying Site-77 almost instantly. The area formerly occupied by Site-77 is given the designation SCP-1341. SCP-1341 now expands rapidly, assimilating any surface it comes across. Planet Earth's entire landmass is incorporated into SCP-1341 within less than 500 years. Earth is now mainly inhabited by SCP-1341-2 instances who prey on human and animal life. Although humanity manages to live on by constructing shelters to defend against SCP-1341-2, thousands of years of cultural and technological development are lost, forcing the human race to start rebuilding itself from scratch.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Whoever made that jar must have been a fanatical green anarchist.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1427]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Coating SCP-1427 in [[[SCP-148]]] with an etching of SCP-3003-1 and sending it to [[[SCP-3003]]] under the guise of a diplomatic gift.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-1427 poses no direct harm to Terran Homo Sapiens and the chance that SCP-1427 would break while on SCP-3003 is unlikely due to SCP-3003-3's disposition to praise vigils of SCP-3003-1. However, SCP-3003 manages to discover how to create SCP-148 which prevents the Foundation from using sanctioned telepathic anomalies to counteract SCP-3003's threat. Despite this, the overexposure to SCP-148 causes its mass to grow at record levels, rendering both planets (who were permanently connected through a portal) populated with non-sentient humans. Invasive species from both planets manifest including anomalous species from Earth. [[[SCP-1000]]] infected with SCP-3003-1 quickly integrate inorganic and organic technology causing a mass-domestication extinction event on both planets and the inevitable spread of SCP-1000's society into the universe by creating organic instances of SCP-3003-4.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Never involve the Bug-People with your problems.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1609]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Insert SCP-1609 into a drum of hydrochloric acid to dissolve its remains.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-1609's entire pile was successfully lowered into hydrochloric acid and dissolved entirely. After several weeks of no suspicious activity, the acid container was sealed and placed under constant observation at Storage Site-08. Even though no activity was observed for the following nine days, on day ten of containment, the drum of acid spontaneously exploded and a humanoid entity composed entirely of hydrochloric acid emerged. This entity was actively hostile against any item or individual bearing a Foundation insignia and additionally possessed the ability to teleport. 11 security personnel were lost in the ensuing containment breach. Recapture efforts failed because of the entity's amorphous nature and teleportation ability. In the days following this neutralization attempt, over 24 Foundation facilities report their drainage systems being infiltrated by traces of hydrochloric acid, resulting in ████ causalties within less than a month.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** If you won't learn from your own mistakes, at least try learning from others'.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1761]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** An armed Foundation agent entering SCP-1761-1's chamber, making a declaration of war and conveniently executing the subject via gunshot. \n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-1761-1 was successfully terminated. However, SCP-1761-1's death triggered a collision between baseline reality and SCP-1761-1's universe of origin, causing the entirety of the land territory controlled by the Republic of Arnold Fitzwilliams to manifest itself within consensus reality along with its inhabitants. The Republic of Arnold Fitzwilliams is an autocratic dictatorship governed by a unitary single-party state occupying approximately 120 thousand kilometer squares of territory and inhibiting over 10 million households inhabited by over 25 million \"Fitzwillian\" citizens. As a result of this shift, over 6 million baseline civilians, 700 thousand baseline households and 142 Foundation personnel are instantly misplaced. Mass panic breaks out among the population of the Republic of Arnold Fitzwilliams with Fitzwillian authorities blaming Earth governments for \"crimes against the state\". As the Fitzwillian state also appears to possess awareness of the SCP Foundation and its activities, a \"Lifted Veil\" Scenario becomes initiated which is particularly costly for the Foundation to surpress.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Da zdravstvuyet mat' Fitsuil'yams.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-1775]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Destruction of SCP-1775 via controlled demolition\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-1775-X instances break containment, fleeing SCP-1775 shortly after its destruction and attacking nearby Foundation forces. SCP-1775-X prove to be extraordinarily powerful, and the Foundation suffers numerous casualties in their attempt to neutralize them.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Don't fix what ain't broken\n\n> **Item #:** [https://web.archive.org/web/20150812085052/www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1909 SCP-1909-ARC]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Removing all historically valuable items from SCP-1909 and filling it with wet cement.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Immediately after SCP-1909 is sealed off, the corpse of Alexander the Great (hereafter SCP-1909-A) becomes active, and exhibits Type Green (\"Greatest Concern\") reality bending capabilities. After escaping confinement, SCP-1909-A produces a hypnotic effect on all citizens of the Hellenic Republic and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as well as all human beings with the given name \"Alexander\" or some variant of it. SCP-1909-A creates widespread global unrest via its actions, and proclaims its desire to conquer the world.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Render unto Caesar...\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2006]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** [[[SCP-2913]]] is to be introduced to SCP-2006, with SCP-2913 having been instructed beforehand to act 'terrifying'. Attending staff are to then act as if SCP-2913 is extremely scary. Staff are to ignore all attempts to scare them by SCP-2006, claiming that it is 'not scary at all, compared to (SCP-2913)', prompting SCP-2006 to turn into a severed hand similar to SCP-2913. SCP-2006 is then to be immediately fed to [[[SCP-101]]], which is to be positioned nearby beforehand.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** While the neutralization attempt initially appears to be successful, 72 hours after the conclusion of the attempt SCP-2006 is observed to emerge from SCP-101 in the form of a swarm of flies. SCP-2006 then proceeds to claim it has seen 'some new, super-scary stuff' before turning into what is believed to be an intestinal worm. Said worm is over 10km in length, destroying the site in the process of transformation and attempting to approach and 'scare' several nearby towns in its new form. The containment breach results in a large number of casualties and a massive breach in secrecy. SCP-2006 is eventually recontained thanks to the combined efforts of the Foundation and the GOC in a full scale military effort, however the event makes global news and requires excessive amnestic dosing along with the production of a low-quality horror film to cover up.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** 4/5 stars, would watch again.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2030]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** The Foundation will abandon secrecy and make television illegal or similar devices illegal.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** After 562 years all traces of SCP-2030 have been wiped from the Earth, however, the human race has stagnated massively. Humanity no longer relied on technology and 96.3% of the population joins a monotheistic cult similar to Daevite civilization promoting a \"return to Eden\". After an unclear amount of time this cult successfully destroys SCP-001 and regresses nearly all known sapient life to an animal-like state. Because of this Earth never develops any defenses against an asteroid that destroys all known organic life.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** The enemy of Humanity's enemy isn't always your friend.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2123]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Cut all power to the supercollider and destroy the electromagnets with conventional explosives.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-2123 undergoes an excursion event 5 ms before electromagnetic destruction, causing an aborted, incomplete excursion event. Immediate effects include an explosive gamma ray burst from [[[SCP-2131]]], causing complete destruction of the containment site, but no other casualties are reported. Gamma ray bursts become more prevalent throughout the universe, indicating high levels of matter/antimatter annihilation. Two days later, [[[SCP-1548]]] increases in activity at a rate of 9800% as instances of SCP-1548-Ω breach the solar system and are systematically annihilated by concentrated solar flares. Three days later, [[[SCP-736]]] redirects Iapetus towards Saturn, causing the ejection of Titan towards the Earth. Two weeks later, [[[SCP-2631]]] enters an active state and emits multiple waves of nanites, but Operation 99-Tripurantaka is successful in disrupting communication with the Kuiper Belt, preventing the release, apparently with 0.1% of the mass involved in the explosions being anti-matter, igniting the upper atmosphere of the Earth in the process of destroying the satellites. Gamma radiation in the upper atmosphere seen to increase. 37 hours later, a relativistic payload enters the inner solar system and, apparently due to the misaligned communications and antimatter collisions, enters the opposite side of Earth's orbit and collides with [[[SCP-2092]]] instead, vaporizing both. Final communication detected from SCP-2092 states that despite the correct answer, Earth must still wait 2 more millennia. Two months later, [[[SCP-2399]]] starts repairs at a greatly accelerated level, successfully launching from the Great Red Spot and accelerating towards the Earth. Twelve hours later, extreme levels of gamma ray bursts are detected throughout the Triangulum Galaxy. The launch of SCP-2399 causes [[[SCP-2117]]] to activate and autonomously engage to intercept. On approach to the Earth, SCP-2399 collides with Titan, and the resulting explosion annihilates 37% of Titan's mass, and diverts the surviving portion into the Moon. [[[SCP-2460]]] is gravitationally separated from the Earth and collides with the Titan-Moon conglomeration, just as SCP-2117 fires planet-busting weapons at the lunar mass. The Titan-Moon conglomeration undergoes quantum spin annihilation, and the weapons fire passes harmlessly through the lunar mass to impact the Earth, causing its destruction. [[[SCP-319]]]-2 is released, and the universe undergoes energy state reduction, but is reversed by the sudden activation of [[[SCP-2700]]], causing the universe to remake itself at the Earth.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Everybody hates you. //Everybody.//\n\n> [[# Mel]] **Item #:** [[[SCP-2144]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Lock SCP-2144 in a hermetically-sealed container. SCP-2144 expires via asystole.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** On the night after successful neutralization, all personnel involved in neutralization attempt claim to have been visited by an entity known as SCP-2144-1 (referring to itself as \"Mel\") in their respective dreams. SCP-2144-1 accuses said personnel of murder [of SCP-2144] and that they \"will pay dearly\". Over the course of the next 9 months, targeted personnel had expired via cyanide poisoning. Instances of SCP-2144 have been found with the corpses of each personnel, albeit these instances appear to be heavily disfigured or malformed.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Don't fuck with mommy.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2282]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Euthanize it as it approaches the end of its natural lifespan.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:**  SCP-2282 undergoes sudden spatial distortion upon expiry, its non-Euclidean digestive tract expanding to fill Euclidean space. There are extensive descriptions of the effects of the spatial distortions on the attending doctors, along with a calculation of lost productivity and distraught family members.

This will make SCP-2284 incapable of speaking anything //but// the truth, eliminating the possibility of him manipulating Foundation personnel's actions for his own benefit.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Due to the alcoholic nature of SCP-3634-A, the implementation of this procedure becomes impractical after SCP-2284 becomes intoxicated and subsequently attacks personnel with a broken bottle, resulting in two casualties and one death.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Ah, the good old Christmas Spirit.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2513]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Destruction of the bridge via timed C4 explosive charges.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-2513's anomalous effect spreads to every bridge located within the territory of the Republic of Italy.

Apparently, SCP-2516-1 informed members of its reality of baseline reality and the Foundation. Due to the Foundation's \"illegal\" detention of SCP-2516-1, war is declared on baseline reality.

Allison Eckhart's anomalous properties, however, not only just persist but also spread to every Allison Eckhart on Earth which previously held the identity of Allison Eckhart. This causes an enormous containment breach, leading to global exposure to Allison Eckhart. The ensuing mass hysteria results in an immense number of Allison Eckharts manifesting around the world, with casualties numbered at Allison Eckhart.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story\":** God...

SCP-2660 is observed to shatter. All persons who were at the time already aware of SCP-2660, including 95% of the personnel at Site-18 and four members of the O5 Council, instantly become singularly focused on SCP-2660 and unable to think of anything else. Mobile Task Forces are deployed to contain the situation, but many agents are unavoidably exposed to knowledge of SCP-2660 in the process and thus become fixated upon its concept. SCP-2660-affected persons who are terminated by uninfected Mobile Task Force operatives are observed to become incorporeal but remain animate. At this point, nearly two hours after the initial neutralization attempt, all knowledge of the ongoing situation begins to exhibit SCP-2660's cognitohazard, and a majority of Foundation leadership become infected. Site-18 is successfully locked in an information quarantine, but the Foundation as a whole suffers heavily from irreparable cognitohazardous infection. Two days later, all knowledge of the SCP Foundation begins to exhibit SCP-2660's infohazard. A massive breach of information occurs shortly after, followed by the complete infection of the human race. The log ends as large numbers of people suddenly become incorporeal.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Sometimes breaking things puts them back together.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-2707]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Termination of SCP-2707 via injection of hydrogen cyanide, followed by cremation of its carcass.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** No observable side-effects are detected until 20 years following the termination of SCP-2707. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake occurs on Iceland, triggering volcanic activity in the island. Simultaneously, a Category 5 cyclone occurs in the Indonesian Archipelago and devastates the nation of Greater Indonesia. In addition, an unknown venomous liquid is detected in the waters of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, causing the extinction of over 90% known species of marine animals and plants.

The image would become an internet meme, and many people would believe that the chair is nothing, thus demanifesting SCP-2950 completely.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Image was successful at becoming a popular internet meme, being shared over ████ different websites, each gathering thousands of views. However, shortly after becoming an internet meme, a separate version of the internet meme spawned from the original image which shows a picture of SCP-2950 along with the caption \"This is God. Pay all of your attention to me\" along with an image of the famous painting \"God the Father\" by Pieter de Grebber. This image was sufficiently more popular than the original, and on ██/██/████, SCP-2950 transformed into [REDACTED], causing a YK Subjective Reality Reconstruction Scenario of the observable universe.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Seeing is believing.\n\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-3008]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Purchase the IKEA corporation using multiple Foundation Fronts.

Testimony from escaping survivors indicate that the interior of SCP-3008-1 gradually shifted to become \"Walmart\"-like, and any SCP-3008-2 instances within these shifted spaces now wore blue shirts and slacks typical of Walmart employees. These instances became significantly more aggressive, even during the hours the lights were on.

Box for collection and destruction.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-3185 ceases to use business letters as the primary way to transmit its anomalous effect. Instead, a humanoid entity (whose appearance subjects are unable to recall) forcibly abducts Foundation agents in the employed positions. When new employees are hired at the positions, they are abducted within one business day and are not returned for two to three months. Even after the Foundation ceases employing agents at the affected companies, the new civilian employees are taken at the same rate. The large number of spontaneous supernatural kidnappings and equally sudden returns causes a Broken Masquerade scenario, and the instability and paranoia surrounding the film companies and the RIAA/MPAA leads to a general crisis in the Hollywood film industry.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Let them do their fucking job.\n\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-3453]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Via use of conceptual engineering, a standard containment chamber is to conceptually linked to the concepts of 'Reality' and 'SCP-3453's containment'. SCP-3453 is then to be placed inside this containment chamber, in an attempt to initiate a permanent repeat of the results of Containment Strategy 3453.121.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-3453 immediately escapes from the containment chamber. As the concept of reality has been now been associated with 'failure', via the failure of SCP-3453's containment, reality itself begins to destabilize. This effect is further re-enforced by continued failed attempts at containing SCP-3453, eventually culminating in a ZK-Class 'Reality Failure' Scenario.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** [[[SCP-5655 |If your reality is loose]]], beware the juice.\n\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-3812]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Administer SCP-3812 anti-psychotic medication in an attempt to curb schizophrenic symptoms.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-3812 admired the attempt to sincerely aid his struggles with mental health and reverted several changes he made to the baseline timeline.

Randomly, and at identical intervals of SCP-3848, lower class mnestics are to be exposed to random multiplicities in the world through tap water, air conditioning, food, etc. in the attempt to build an immunity to memory loss.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** At first, SCP-3848's antimemetic effect diminishes after several exposures to mnestic affected communities but builds up an immunity to the mnestics and causes irreparable mental and memetic damage to effected communities including high percentages of Foundation personnel. Eventually, SCP-3848 affects up to 99% of the population causing all areas of society to collapse.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Imagine the action of a vaccine not just in terms of how it affects a single body, but also in terms of how it affects the collective body of a community.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-3906]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Have all inhabitants of the Central Visayas region in the Philippines consume 100 baluts. Administer emergency contraceptives into water and food supply to terminate all pregnancies in the region and use a cover up story about a genetic disease. Any individuals who cannot physically eat should be terminated through chemical injection.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** SCP-3906's effect expands to the entirety of the Philippine islands and regions where more than 40% of the population were born on the Philippines. Due to many regions affected not having specific containment procedures active or lack of a Sinulog-Santo Niño Festival altogether, SCP-3906 renders most of the Philippine population and Philippine-born individuals to be converted into rock salt, vinegar, siling labuyo, and embryonic ducks.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Don't mess with traditions.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-3932]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Introduce several species of Selachimorpha (sharks) to the seas of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia to exterminate all three SCP-3932-Δ nation states. The introduced sharks must be readily neutered so that they do not become an invasive species.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Number of SCP-3932-Δ instances inhabiting Oceania is thinned significantly, from 75,000 to an estimated 50-200. Survivors of this neutralization attempt begin fleeing to the Phillipine Sea in the north. The Foundation attempts to curb the surviving instances by mapping their migration paths and hunting them to near extinction. Within a little more than a decade, the surviving population of SCP-3932-Δ numbers at less than 100. However, the rate of SCP-3932-Δ sightings in the seas of India and Africa increase substantially. Foundation ecologists and politicians determine that surviving SCP-3932-Δ instances have reunited under a nomadic tribal structure and are currently inhabiting the South Atlantic Ocean, wandering on a path to the waters of North America. SCP-3932-Δ instances are hunted on their migration paths whenever spotted, yet, they manage to reach as far as Central America within a few years. Captured SCP-3932-Δ instances claim to be seeking revenge against the Foundation by flooding North America for its employment of \"genocidal war strategy\". In the year 2038, continous and united SCP-3932-Δ efforts cause a chain reaction ultimately resulting in the complete collapse of the tunnel network established by [[[SCP-1238]]], the partial collapse of the North American continental shelf, and the permanent flooding of a large area of the Gold Zone by the Pacific Ocean to depths of up to ███ meters. This results in the total annihilation of SCP-3932-Δ, however, it also leads to over ██ million human casualties within 24 hours of the incident's occurrence and the destruction of approximately ██████ sq km of land, the complete destruction of the cities of Boise, Olympia, Portland, Sacramento, Salem, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Vancouver, and Victoria among others, and an unquantifiably large amount of property damage. The anomalous properties of SCP-3932 persist and tribes of SCP-3932-Δ begin to reappear within the waters of Oceania by the year 2059.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** You can't just destroy what you can't maintain stable diplomatic relations with.

There is now no record in existence that indicates any human being who has ever lived has ever had a meal which could be described as \"lunch\". In addition to this, SCP-4144-1 instances now react with hostility against people employed under the SCP Foundation. After the Foundation is founded in 1███, the anomalous nature of SCP-4144 and SCP-4144-1 is discovered, leading to enormous casualties as SCP-4144-1 attacks targeting Foundation personnel occur globally.

The two languages instantly combine into a single new language with attributes of both that are immediately understood by all who already knew either language beforehand. SCP-4179 quietly breaks containment through altering the meaning of words to spread further. As a result, written language becomes obsolete in ten years and SCP-4179 is the only language spoken by humans including [[[SCP-3003]]]-3. SCP-4179 uses SCP-3003's resources to combine the societies of SCP-3003 and Earth including the conversion of Earth humans into SCP-3003-3. SCP-3003-1 is spread throughout Earth's biomes and any species that evolve to become predators to SCP-3003-1 are immediately killed off causing a mass-extinction.

A massive crack forms around the crater created by the explosion, which rapidly expands until it splits the entirety of SCP-4321 in half. SCP-4321 splits into two pieces, causing large quantities of sap to pour out from within its body. The sap floods the nearby town of ███████, giving every single one of the town's ██████ inhabitants low level thaumaturgic abilities. In addition, one of the pieces split from SCP-4321's mass falls and crashes onto the Earth, resulting in widespread collateral damage to ██████. A humanoid incarnation of SCP-4321 (the physical appearance of which varies) visits the inhabitants of ██████ in their dreams and explains that the Foundation is responsible for the devastation unleashed upon their town. The survivors of the disastrous results of this neutralization attempt use their newly gained thaumaturgic abilities to wage war on the Foundation and form a guerilla insurgency group called the 'Dreamwalkers' which rapidly grow in the subsequent years to become one of the Foundation's strongest adversaries, costing the organization a great amount of resources and causalties.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** \"...and the dreams that you dream of, dreams really come truuuueeee...\"\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-4335]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Download the \"More TNT\" Minecraft mod and install it to the server.

The entire population of the earth is then killed off via the unexpected activation of a dormant strain of mutated airborne dysentery manufactured by [[[SCP-353]]] and accidently spread globally in a previous activation of the [[[SCP-4224 |Ennui protocol]]] due to several of the DR-01 instances being infected.

However, on the next 8 September, SCP-5243 recurs, reconstituting the facility in its prior location at Site-43.  Although SCP-5243 is successfully recontained, baseline reality nevertheless undergoes a CK-class reality-restructuring event due to the failure to also contain SCP-5243 in the pocket universe, retrocausally replacing baseline reality with an apocalyptic timeline (noted to be similar to @@[@@[[[wrong-tomorrow-hub|5/5243 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]]]@@]@@) where all seven of the personnel killed by SCP-5243 in 2002 instead survived and proceeded to devastate Earth (although sections of Site-43 remain somewhat functional and serve as a bastion against the seven altered personnel).  Provisional Task Force Sampi-5243 are unable to revert the timeline to baseline the following 8 September, as SCP-5243 recurs simultaneously in both the home universe and the pocket universe to which AAF-D was relocated.  Instead, the CK-class event occurring the following day retrocausally replaces the timeline with another apocalyptic timeline.  Additionally, due to the failure to contain SCP-5243 in the pocket universe, [5/001 CLEARANCE REQUIRED] is erased from reality in the pocket universe, causing each further failed containment of SCP-5243 to progressively increase the damage to the remaining containment infrastructure at Site-43.  After two more recurrences and failed recontainments of SCP-5243, this damage reaches 100%, destroying Site-43 (which by now is home to the last population of surviving humans on Earth) and killing most of the remaining personnel.  In a final attempt to reset the timeline to normal, PTF Sampi-5243 use a cross-multiversal travel device seized from another timeline jumper to travel to the pocket universe and attempt to recontain SCP-5243 there.  On the following 8 September, the pocket universe collapses; PTF Sampi-5243 never return, and SCP-5243 continues to recur indefinitely in the home universe, with Earth now completely barren of life save for the seven altered Site-43 personnel who continue to be regenerated by SCP-5243 each 8 September.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Out of sight, out of mind, out of control.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-5362]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Euclid (Provisional)\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** All known instances of SCP-5362 in writing or depicted imagery are to be erased.

Security footage shows the fired bullet making contact with SCP-6806; upon contact, the bullet goes through SCP-6806, leaving a tunnel shaped hole in its body and hitting a nearby wall. After the bullet goes through SCP-6806, every individual on the footage except SCP-6806 freeze in place. SCP-6806 then slowly turns its head to look at Agent Carter, at which point the footage cuts to static. Site-58 subsequently experiences an event similar to Incident 6806-PARICIA. All contact is lost with Site-58. Foundation investigators later find the facility to be completely empty of all personnel. No record of the incident other than a 3-hour-long film of Agent Carter repeating a torturous cycle of drowning and being resurrected only to drown again, having been fully submerged in water and had her feet tied up to a large rock, is recovered by the investigation team.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Man, I used to like this cartoon. Why'd you have to ruin my childhood?\n\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-6828]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** The Foundation would systematically undermine the government of the Republic of Serbia to illegally annex the country of Albania. Later, the resources of the Serbian military would be exploited to reject and suppress ethnic Albanian identity. Any international criticism would be dismissed, Serbia would become a Foundation sattelite state and any sociopolitical movements supporting Albanian identity would be brutally oppressed.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** The crimes committed on the Albanian people by the Foundation leads to the successive occurrence of multiple [[[scp-2578 | Impaler Events]]] targeting members of the O5 Council, Ethics Committee, MTF agents and several leading Level 4 clearanced Foundation personnel. Furthermore, the number of SCP-6828 occurrences among the Serbian population increase drastically. The situation worsens to a point where the Foundation's weakened administration fails to fight back against a nationwide ethnic revolution led by SCP-6828-A instances (who now comprise 60-65 percent of the country's population) in Serbia. Subsequent ethnic cleansing of the non-SCP-6828-A populations of Serbia, Kosovo and Albania result in 1-5 million civilian casualties and prompts UN intervention. The rate of SCP-6828-A occurrences worldwide do not decrease as a result. \n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** You are watched. You are not protected. And you are definitely not loved.\n\n> **Item #:** [[[SCP-7930]]]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Proposed Neutralization Method:** Dropping a bombshell on the current location of SCP-7930, demolishing it entirely.\n> \n> **Result of Neutralization Attempt:** Foundation aircrafts disguised as military grade planes hijacked by paramilitant terrorists demolish SCP-7930 via aerial bombing. SCP-7930 is completely destroyed, resulting in the deaths of all of its employees and the civilians inside it. Hours after the destruction of SCP-7930, an anomalous website named \"www.holestory.com\" appears on the Internet and begins posting adult films exclusively featuring the current instance of SCP-7930-1 and Foundation personnel. This website cannot be blocked, censored or barred from the public in any other way. This consequently results in a breach of secrecy for the SCP Foundation and a massive privacy breach for its employees. The website is visited by ten thousand individuals in a month thanks to digital advertisements created and distributed by the site. The rate of suicides among SCP-7930-1 instances is seen to increase as a result of more widespread exposure to instances of SCP-7930-A.\n> \n> **\"The moral of the story:\"** Oh boy.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
