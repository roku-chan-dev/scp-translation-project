This turned out more of a bizarre anomalous country ballad, but they liked it, so...\n[[/collapsible]]\n _\n\n+ THE BALLAD OF THE [[[scp-6802|SOUP DOG]]]\n _\n \nThose in the know, allegedly, say:\nA long time ago, in a Site far away\nWe contained a peculiar golden and friendly old mutt.\nHe lived in a cell; ate kibble; and to\nThe average well-wisher's innocent view\nAppeared to be totally unremarkable.\n \nBut!\n \nA few times a week, it burned in his chest:\nThe urge to soup-seek! And when on this quest\nAny who saw him felt strongly compelled by his yelps.\nAnd on one such day, one distant July\nHe headed away. And we still don't know why,\nSave that the Soup Dog was bound and determined to help.\n \nSoon followed around (as staff adhered to\nThe guidance that's found in [[[SCP-6802|Skip Six Eight Oh-Two]]]),\nThe canine displayed some unusual seeking behavior.\nFor example, he strode past huge barrels of gloop\n(More precisely, a vast cache of canned Campbell's soup)\nEven though all of it was his time-tested favorite flavor!\n \nInstead, with his usual handler in tow\nOur delusional-acting pup wanted to go\nTo the Site's other wing, where the vehicle pool could be found.\nBemused by all this, but also compelled\nTo follow each wish of the pupper they held\nOur faithful attendant decided to drive him around.\n \nTurned out, when the car left the Site's main garage\nIt didn't get far before Soup Dog took charge:\nHe barked, whined, and pointed to show which directions to choose.\nAnd after a trip past the few nearby towns\nAnd into the sticks of their rural surrounds,\nAn ominous series of buildings rose up into view.\n \n\"Well, Soup Dog: why here?\" groaned the pup's human friend\nBut then, as they peered at the sign near the end\nOf the road, they read: REGIONAL CAMPBELL'S SOUP BULK HOLDING POOL.\n\"Oh, come on! Not even you'll drink all of THAT —\"\nA metal-stress screaming! Abruptly, a vat\nBursts wide open! A soup-nami heads for the quaint local school!\n \n\"…You're shitting me, man!\" But Soup Dog was not!\nHe broke from his leash, ran - and inhaled the lot:\nAll ten thousand liters. (We still don't know how it's digested.)\nThen, as the steam cleared from the site of the fray\nThe witnesses cheered: \"Soup Dog! Hip, hooray!!\"\n(Don't worry: we tracked them all down to give them their amnestics.)\n \nAnd later, when all the excitement died down\nOur soup hero, sated, and wearing a crown\nThat said \"BEST DOG EVER\" the schoolkids had all made for him,\nAllowed the Foundation to drive him right back\nTo his usual location, and then, as he tracked\nSoup behind him, he entered his cell again.\n \n...Was that a grin?\n \nCan dogs show emotion that way? It sure seemed,\nAs Soup Dog went back to his bay to be cleaned,\nThat he was amused at the chaos that had just transpired.\nJust one final thing: next day, a curt note\nWent to Dr. 'Zim. Their Director wrote:\n\"A [[[SCP-6802|one-twenty liter top limit?]]] I think not. You're fired.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n _\n _\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n _\n _",
