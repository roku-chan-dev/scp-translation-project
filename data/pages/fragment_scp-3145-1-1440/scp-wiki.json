  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-3145\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3145 is currently uncontained. Its location is currently unknown. Due to SCP-3145's related effects, the Foundation may be unable to fully contain it without unacceptable loss of resources and personnel. Until suitable containment procedures are devised, focus must be on location and surveillance of SCP-3145, and analysis of its pattern of travel, to minimize civilian exposure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3145 appears to be a male human of unknown ethnicity. Though it appears to be elderly, it has not shown signs of aging in the 50 years the Foundation has been aware of its existence.\n\nSCP-3145 has an adverse affect on anything created by humanity. Exposure longer than a few days will instigate increasingly destructive events in its vicinity until all such materials are destroyed and any nearby humans deceased. The only exceptions to this effect are SCP-3145 itself and its belongings.\n\nSCP-3145 travels in a highly complex pattern that invariably leads it into contact with human population. The exact nature of this pattern has yet to be determined. SCP-3145 is actively hostile, and previous attempts to contain it have failed, resulting in catastrophic losses.\n\n**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Falzon\n> \n> **Foreword:** During the fourth effort to contain SCP-3145, Dr. Falzon approached the entity and recorded their conversation.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 15:34>**\n> \n> **Falzon:** SCP-3145, how are you enjoying your accommodations?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Oh, it's great, just great! I've never dreamed of this much destruction and death before!\n> \n> **Falzon:** You do seem to be enjoying yourself. \n> \n> **SCP-3145:** You bet! I'm having so much fun, I don't even care that those guys get all the credit! //[points behind Dr. Falzon]//\n> \n> **Falzon:** Guys?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** You know, the, uh... Oh, I think the tall one's giving me the stink eye. Nevermind. Forget I said anything!\n> \n> **Falzon:** Can you comment on the nature of the pattern in which you travel?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Ah, you know, go where the wind takes me and all that. If I wait long enough, I always find some new place to trash. //[laughs]// Speaking of which, those guys are telling me it's about to get a little nuclear in here. Adios!\n> \n> **<End Log, 15:38>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Falzon, previously in excellent health, suffered a stroke at this moment, allowing SCP-3145 to escape. The on-site nuclear warhead detonated two minutes later, resulting in a complete loss of the containment site and personnel. How this recording made it into the offsite backup database is unknown. Efforts to devise a workable containment for SCP-3145 are ongoing.",
