She --wears-- no longer wears a green tinted visor at all times. The visor is of her own design, and --its purpose is unknown-- its purpose is to look cool.\n\n**History:** Krona Midaeus was recruited as part of a personnel exchange with the British Occult Service, where she formerly held the position of Internal Security Agent. In 20██, Krona Midaeus was reassigned to the Scientific Department by request, and was assigned as a Junior Researcher working at Site-34. After two years diligent work, initially as part of the SCP-████ project and later assisting MTF Lambda-14 (\"One Star Reviewers\"), Krona Midaeus was promoted to a full Researcher. Krona Midaeus has since worked at this level on various minor projects. \n\nKrona Midaeus has a notable interest in SCP-914, and has proposed and executed a number of unusual tests regarding it. These can be found in [http://www.scpwiki.com/experiment-log-914/offset/1 Experiment Log 914]\n\n**Profile:** Researcher Midaeus is well known for an unusual approach, her unique style of testing often revealing important information that could not be revealed through standard testing procedure. Due to the variety of tests, as well as a background with the B.O.S, she has a large variety of memetic inoculations. She is equally well known for her sarcastic attitude, convoluted insults, and for being the most overtly British Foundation researcher in the nearest thousand miles.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n**Note:** //No, I did **NOT** work for the sodding Gocks, those wankers can't know their arse from their face for the amount of shite they spew from both.

That's not to say anything's done especially well however, so I've got a long way to go. My brief time here has been characterised by two things: A restaurant of anomalous dishes, and a consistent and uncanny ability to rope highly respected writers into my projects. \n\nLet's have a look at what I've written, eh?\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Dining Out]]]:** My first post on the website was this tale, created for Halloween 2018. Doesn't really fit the theme, but I was really just looking for an excuse to plumb in this new GoI idea I had...\n\nPerhaps that's why it took two weeks to breach +10?\n\n-----\n\n**[[[SCP-4554]]]:** [[*user DrChandra]] wrote an [[[Oh, I Wouldn't Worry About Flaky-Os |excellent tale]]] regarding my new Group, and I just had to use an idea I saw there. How had there not been a liquid sunshine skip before now? Truly, the mainlist boggles the mind.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Ambrose Fair|The Ambrose Fair]]]:** Following me starting to talk about Ambrose a lot, I received the very good point that Ambrose probably isn't the first in the anomalous food market. So I decided to do a good bit of world building. \n\nI also took the opportunity to lay down the groundwork for a few characters I can use later.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Ambrose Temecula]]]:** \"I'll be taking a break from Ambrose...\" Yeah, that was a lie. Ah well, my first GoI format, as well as the Ambrose Restaurant's first format. This thing took three or four attempts to get presentable, and a bit over a month. I nicked code from one lad, and ideas from another, but damn if it didn't pay off?\n\nEveryone gets baffled by their name appearing down there, don't worry. You're not alone.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Ambrose Restaurant Hub]]]:** I can hardly believe that happened. A new GoI, with my name plastered all over it. Feels good, man. This was probably my fourth attempt at making a hub, and I had help from ya boy Nicolini. He really has a knack for making me describe Ambrose. I also spent more time than I care to admit on the lackluster guide. I'm not good at self-analysis.\n\nI swear, at some point I'm going to do something that isn't Ambrose.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Three Thousand to One]]]:** Sound the sodding alarm, it's a posted work that has absolutely, positively, 100% //nothing// to do with the Ambrose Restaurant. Who am I, and what have I done with the real Proasek?\n\nBut yes, trying to start some sort of canon around here eventually, and this will be the first official tale written for it. Wowee.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[SCP-4684]]]:** And then it happened again! Although to be fair, this was part of IntCon, and thus couldn't easily be about Ambrose. But still! Wizard Cops! Also by far the quickest I've banged out an article thus far, with less than two days between initial concept and posting. Call it training for JamCon, shall we?\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Canine Communication]]]:** \"Shaggy Dog\" is a type of joke telling where the buildup is long and often convoluted, all for the payoff of not actually having a satisfying punchline. This is something I only learned half way through writing this article about an old english sheepdog. I did manage to put a shaggy dog joke in there, but it's not really the focus of the article.\n\nI decided that I'm using Jamcon to establish my author insert, as well as the \"Fully Functional Foundation Facility\" series / canon. No idea if I'll actually make it a canon.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Open War at Site-34]]]:** Since North based a tale around //my// author insert, I had to base a tale around //their// author insert. Fair's fair, and all. The phase two theme made the phase one theme look like a piece of cake. \"Pulp Fiction,\" seriously do they want the printing medium or the film?\n\nAh well, I managed to come up with something, even if it didn't have too much to do with the actual theme. Looks like nobody's noticed yet.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[What You See is (Not) What You Get]]]:** Oysh, pumping this tale out killed me for a bit. Three in a row was a mistake, perhaps it would've been better to pace myself and only do the first day? Fah. After finishing Jamcon, I hit the largest hiatus of my writing career. Probably. Not sure. Certainly the first one I was actively aware of. \n\n-----\n\n**[[[SCP-3684]]]:** We don't talk of this one.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[SCP-4871]]]:** All cards on the table, I just wrote this because I wanted to make a cosplay based on my character in a freeform RP I'm doing, and it made more sense for it to be a skip than an original character. Slightly, at least.\n\nPlus, multiverse shenanigans and another work for my author avatar to appear in! That's always worth writing something. If nothing else, I had a lot of fun writing the project proposals for this, I feel I nailed the tone and realism on these. I'll stop tooting my own horn now.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[Wizard Cops (in color)]]]:*** This tale took me a solid year to produce after JamCon2019 murdered me to death. You can probably see the difference at some point.\n\n-----\n\n**[[[He Picked Up The Gun]]]:*** My contribution for the Canon Renaissance Contest, wherein I decided to take a vague understanding of \"what if SCP but yeehaw?\", and plumbed some narrative abstraction in there a-la Cuil Theory. As seems to be common for me, was more popular during the drafting phase.\n\n-----\n\n**What's Next?:** I want to write something in my own style, the last two things I did (that stuck around) were trying to emulate another style and I think I missed the mark on both fronts. It'll probably be Ambrose related, especially now I've found out there's a whole Discord server of people writing Ambrose stuff. \n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Sandbox]]\n\nStalk away, I do things on my [http://firedawnfolder.wikidot.com/proasek-does-stuff Firedawn Folder Sandbox], in which mad drafts of various stages of completion and complexity lie forever dormant until I actually decide to finish them off. It's also capped by an entirely unrelated rhapsody, if you're into that.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Fanart]]\n\n--I lied, I have no fanart. If you'd like to make some though, I'd be very happy, and you can have a cookie! Not that I can stop you from having a cookie if you don't, but you wouldn't //deserve// one nearly as much. Not from me anyway.--\n\nNevermind lads, I got some through!\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/krona-midaeus-personnel-file/RockefellerArt|align=center|caption=Researcher Midaeus Conducting a Test on SCP-914, by [[*user Hercules Rockefeller]]|width=800px]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/krona-midaeus-personnel-file/QuestArt|align=center|caption=Krona Midaeus looking tired, by [[*user forbiddenquest]]|width=400px]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/krona-midaeus-personnel-file/ProasekArt|align=center|caption=SCP-4871 before getting a new bed, by [[*user Proasek]], the massive nerd.|width=800px]]\n= [[size 20%]] Yes this is the official appearance of -4871.
