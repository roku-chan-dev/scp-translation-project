She got along with men much better, once the ground rules had been established.\n\nHer time doing ridealongs with Van Rompay had helped a great deal in that regard. She'd only had to punch one person in the balls since taking the old soldier's job, and she was pretty sure the recipient understood that he'd had it coming.\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nMost Mobile Task Forces are stationed at a single facility. Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\"), a battalion tasked almost excusively with regaining control over lost or rogue facilities, deploys out of Armed Bio-Containment Area-14. Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\") are the bodyguards of the O5 Council, and therefore operate primarily at Site-01, though squadrons can be found wherever the Overseers roam. Some MTFs leapfrog from station to station, going where they're needed most, and very few are explicitly tied to the organizational hierarchy of the place where they hang their helmets. As it so often is, Site-43 is an exception to this rule.\n\nThe majority of the Mobile Task Forces operating out of Site-43 are stationed there long-term, and rarely travel far from their point of origin. This is due to the facility's role as a hub of Foundation authority in Canada and the northernmost United States; relying on units stationed southward presents all manner of difficulties, from the sheer logistics of flying up to Lake Huron to the awkwardness of black helicopters crossing the American border. Deviation from the standard name-and-numbering rules is used to indicate this peculiarity: most forces tied to Site-43 are numbered to indicate as much, with a solid proportion of the range between Alpha- and Omega-43 already covered. \n\nThis long-term residency arrangement, coupled with the fact that most of the MTFs operate out of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-A's upper levels and are therefore isolated from the rest of the Site's staff, has made the agents and researchers under Chief Ibanez's command particularly tight-knit. Contrary to Foundation policy for fraternization between researchers, of which Site-43 has always been in flagrant violation, this is generally considered to be a good thing. Morale is morale.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThat was all well and good, but the fact remained that Ibanez was not yet properly a member of the family whose matriarch she now was. It had been a patriarchy before, which was a problem, and it had operated according to a discipline specific to Van Rompay's personal style, which was another.\n\nAs Chief of Security and Containment, she'd been able to flit between only three nerve centres and hang out with the staff on-duty, getting to know them and observing their work. The MTFs had no dedicated central socializing space, because each of them had their own unique tasks, personnel makeup and equipment, and so she found herself spending most of each shift wandering from room to room, spending a few minutes max with each agent, then moving on. She was going to be a cipher to most of them for months, and there really wasn't anything she could do about it but put in the work.\n\nThe other Survivors were her friends, but there were some things best kept among colleagues, and she felt that the rougher kinds of socialization fell firmly into that category. So when her body and brain started to ache from too many days spent solely on filling the old man's big combat boots, it was natural, if not precisely admirable, that she'd call on her former associates to fill the need.\n\nWhich was how she found out that Howard Yancy's wife had been in an automobile accident, and he was out of the facility on indefinite leave.\n\nOrdinarily, she would have gone on down the list of potential drinking buddies until she found someone available.\n\nThe problem was that somehow, in between Breaches and survival training and executing hapless thaumaturges and chasing //gift// and //geistschreiber// and shifting career paths, she'd never actually extended that list beyond a single item.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 24 February\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nNo doubt he'd heard it a thousand times before, but never from her, so she had plausible deniability. Imrich had his own office now -- probably had for years -- and he'd left the door open, so Udo walked in brazenly and declared: \"I'll bet you knew I was coming.\"\n\n\"No.\" He didn't look up from his desk. This wasn't anything new, and didn't necessarily signify anything.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No.\" He stopped scribbling in his notepad; she saw a stack of them behind him on the squat filing cabinet, and realized with dull surprise that all of them were used. He finally looked up. \"What do you want?\"\n\nShe got right into it. Imrich hated preambles. \"Du was talking about how predictive thaumaturgy doesn't work right anymore. I was wondering if he was talking about you.\"\n\nHe didn't sigh, but his eyes did. \"I didn't know you were coming because I don't spend my time predicting what you'll do. I've got more important things to waste my time with.\"\n\n\"So, it //hasn't// affected you?\" she nudged.\n\n\"Of course it's affected me. It's affected me since F-D blew up for the first time. I've been accounting for it, but.\" His jaw jutted out, and he seethed for a moment.\n\nShe didn't like to pry, but she didn't see a choice. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"But it's like suddenly I need glasses, and I don't have any. Relatable?\"\n\n\"Not particularly.\" She tilted down the lenses of her enormous round spectacles. \"I don't need glasses.\"\n\nHe looked legitimately surprised, which was a true rarity. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She pushed them back up the bridge of her nose. \"It's a stupid affectation. Thanks for not considering that possibility.\" She moved to take the door in one hand, \"Can we talk? We don't really talk anymore.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Why not, as in yes, or why not, as in--\"\n\n\"Not why not as in why don't we talk anymore. We don't talk anymore because we stopped being friends, and it was too pointless and embarrassing to start again, and you've only needed my help on the seldomest of occasions since then.

I know it drives Reynders up the window, having to see all that alternate reality stuff. Is it the same with you?\"\n\n\"No.\" The way he poured it all out, she was sure her question had accorded precisely with his most keen frustrations. \"With me it's like I used to have the world's most accurate roadmap, written in a language I don't read but can cross-translate, and now it's like someone printed a whole other map on top of that one, in the same ink, at a slight angle, and it's //almost fucking impossible// to tell which is which. And that's happened three times now. And also the world is falling apart, a little bit, so actually even the baseline map underneath is a little bit wrong in all the wrong places. So all in all it's going just //fantastic.//\" He picked up the notepad and flung it into the trashbin, which fell over. There were other notepads in there, she saw.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe knew so many people who liked to make eye contact. \"Scuttlebutt is you're the only one with no reason to be. Everyone else has fucked up the conprocs, but you don't even really //do// anything, so how can you?\"\n\nShe was an old hand at not taking offence at Imrich's bluntness. In a way, it had prepared her for friendship with Lillian Lillihammer. \"I meant I was sorry you're dealing with that. But...\" It was like a light going on in the back of her head. \"You've given me an idea.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I wonder if you could use your Talent to map my actions during 5243, and get a little more evidence of what exactly is //happening.// The security feeds are unreadable. My memories are irretrievable. But maybe...?\"\n\n\"No.\" And there it was again.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No. I'm still working on Wettle's replications. We're trying to map the fractures, predict where they'll happen next. That's more important.\" He pulled a fresh notepad out of a box on the fake windowsill.\n\n\"Is it? Because from where I'm standing, 5243 is the cause of all of this, and the more we know about why and how it happens, the closer we'll get to stopping these fractures from even existing.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" he said, still with his back to her, \"it all comes down to you, and how important you are.\"\n\n\"I never said I was important,\" she said.\n\n\"No,\" he shook his head, \"you never do.\"\n\n\"But Du and Reynders said that the Breach is definitely what's causing this. Every little hint about how it works could be invaluable.\"\n\n\"I suppose.\"\n\n\"Will you at least think about it?\"\n\nHe spun back around, notepad in hand. \"Sure. I'll think about it.

The lazy old tech had never much cared for Ambrogi's moonshine, and had gotten his fix in loud, sloppy fashion with the rest of the hard cases who didn't mind the optics of drinking during the day. Ibanez hadn't liked the man very much, but she'd liked the ambience he provided just fine.\n\nSitting at the bar with Udo Okorie almost felt //respectable,// which was not at all the vibe that she was looking for.\n\nNo respectable establishment would have entertained Udo's taste for girly cocktails, but the saloon was a serve-yourself model, so she sat there primly sipping at a Piña Colada while Ibanez pounded back bottle after bottle of the Site's private reserve. Forsythe had often marvelled that someone so small could metabolize so much alcohol. Udo was visibly admiring it now.\n\nOr was that fear? //Works for me, either way.//\n\nThere was nobody else in the room, and it was particularly well-soundproofed for fairly obvious reasons, so there was no reason for them not to talk shop. Udo was doing most of the talking, while Ibanez grunted agreement or dissent.\n\n\"Lillian remembered something interesting today,\" the thaumaturge remarked.\n\nIbanez grunted through her beer.\n\n\"She first met Wheeler, Marion Wheeler, at Site...\" Udo furrowed her brow for a second. \"Site-41, where Antimemetics is based -- I think. She was there on Del Olmo's trail, after he dropped clean out of the record. She was tracking down anybody who might be able to give her a new perspective on why he'd disappeared.\"\n\nIbanez wiped the foam from her lip. \"You say Lillian //remembered// this, today? I didn't think Lillian could forget things.\"\n\nUdo nodded. \"Yeah, but that's not the same as thinking about everything at once, right? She'd go nuts.\" She smirked. \"Nutser. She can still dismiss thoughts she doesn't want to have right now.\"\n\n\"Ought to teach that to Phil Deering,\" Ibanez remarked. \"Or Harry.\"\n\nUdo nodded. \"So, because it was tied up with Antimemetics, it was harder for her to focus on it. Didn't occur to her to bring it up until today, because I was telling her we were gonna have this little meeting,\" and she playfully nudged Ibanez's ribs with her shoe, \"and she'd just gotten off the phone telling Wheeler some random thing she didn't feel like telling //me.//\"\n\nIbanez took another pull, and wiped the residue away again. \"What's the short version of why this matters?\"\n\n\"Wheeler told her Del Olmo was tracking down a global cult, and that Antimemetics had an interest. He was doing spot treatments. Busting people, getting them contained, amnesticized, whatever.\"\n\n\"Secret agent shit.\"\n\n\"Apparently. Now, you'd think this was the //giftschreiber,// right? It wasn't.\"\n\n\"Not the new guys, either?\"\n\n\"No. Neither side. Wheeler said it was unrelated to any of that. Del Olmo was handling a global memetic crisis, but not the one //we're// handling. Lillian says that's how she got saddled with whatever //her// thing with Antimem is about.\"\n\nIbanez tried to take another gulp, but the bottle was almost empty. All she got were a few bitter dregs. \"Ngh. Okay. What's that information get us?\"\n\n\"I think it cuts down on the number of angles we need to pursue. If Del Olmo was working on something unrelated to the cryptomancers, that just leaves Zlatá and Deering to figure out.

Couch looked not the slightest bit ridiculous in her casual shirt and slacks, blending into the Tim Hortons atmosphere far more effectively than did Udo herself. \n\nBut seeing the Chief Superintendent of OSAT out of uniform nevertheless reminded her powerfully of those candid shots of Hitler in his short pants and knee-high socks. \n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/50-turning-and-turning/DL_50_03_Couch_Casual.jpg]]\n\n\"So,\" said Udo. \"What are we going to talk about?\"\n\n\"How sad it is that you're wasting your talents?\" Couch sipped at her mocha latte. \"Or rather, that they're being wasted for you? It was my understanding that you're some kind of wizard-woman. Why would they send you on a diplomacy mission?\"\n\nUdo stirred her tea, and smiled. \"Do you think you're being clever? Framing it that way?\" She leaned in. \"You want to know why they only sent a researcher to talk with you. You think you're so much more important than that.\"\n\nThe other woman's face split apart in a wide grin. \"I like you! You don't take any shit. Like the short one.\" Couch idly rotated the sleeve on her cardboard cup, in tune with Udo's spoon. \"But seriously, I would think they could find something more entertaining for you to get up to. I certainly could.\"\n\nUdo laughed. \"Wow. Yeah, consider me flattered and intrigued. I can't wait to hear the amazing pitch you give me, about how I should come work for your hobbled X-Files unit as opposed to the world-renowned research and containment initiative that //fucking raised me.//\"\n\nCouch lifted both hands in a gesture of surrender, which of course meant that she hadn't really cared if the implied offer made an impact. \"Fair play. It was worth a try. You want to get down to business, that's fine by me. Are you familiar with the Québec insomnia case?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She certainly was. It had begun when the Foundation had decommissioned SCP-5281, at the behest of OSAT and the Global Occult Coalition. She'd read a heavily redacted version of the file -- the real one was rated at Clearance Level 4, meaning only the Director and a few of his senior Chairs and Chiefs could get the entire story -- and it had struck her as a situation with no good possible outcome. 5281 had been a French-Canadian phantasm known as //Bonhomme Sept-Heures,// the Seven O'Clock Gentleman, with the unsettling abilities to teleport anywhere within the Province of Québec, induce sleep with a fine red powder, and consume more than his own body weight in victims in a single night, if he so chose. And he chose quite whimsically.\n\nOnly in terms of the quantity of his meals, however. The quality was firmly fixed.\n\n//Bonhomme Sept-Heures// had exclusively eaten children.\n\nThey'd tried containing him. They'd tried reasoning with him. They'd tried disabling him. Nothing worked. And so, finally, they'd turned to their final option. The Decommissioning Department had executed him via lethal injection in April of 1996.\n\nAt which point, children across Québec had begun exhibiting signs of chronic insomnia.\n\nIt soon became clear that the gentleman cannibal had performed some sort of soporific function in addition to his irregular feeding patterns, which had gone unnoticed by either the Foundation or OSAT. As this new difficulty was anomalous in nature, and too close scrutiny by agencies outside the Veil risked exposing the whole sordid story -- in which absolutely nobody came off very well -- the Foundation had stepped in to ameliorate. Medical treatments with paranatural origins were administered to the affected children, and fatalities were kept to a minimum. The most effective treatment of all involved the use of the red dust 5281 had used to sedate his victims; the same red dust which Udo used in all her thaumaturgic rites, having found it a uniquely comfortable fit.\n\nIf this was what Couch wanted to talk about, well, that explained why Udo had been sent to listen. She wasn't about to tell the Chief Superintendent any of that, of course, so she left it at that brief affirmation.\n\n\"Bad business,\" Couch remarked. \"None of us covered ourselves in glory. Of course, it was before my time. And yours.\" She pretended to look concerned. It was an unnatural look on her arch features. \"Well, the business with the boogeyman was. The children, not so much. It's been getting worse every year, despite all that bizarre red medicine your people have been passing along. I thought you might learn something from the fellow's //vestments,// but apparently you didn't get anything valuable from that trade. Teach me to be generous with my resources, I suppose.\"\n\nThat was a laugh. Couch had traded 5281's clothes, granted to OSAT as a reward for its participation in the debacle, for a comatose //loup-garou// in Site-43's possession. The tradeoff had been handled so poorly, thanks to the bungling of Edwin Falkirk (and, though nobody said as much in public, Karen Elstrom), that a handful of Site personnel had been killed. And the threadbare Victorian attire had produced, after weeks of careful study, not a single appreciable benefit.\n\nUdo didn't say anything about that, either, offering not even a lukewarm defence. She simply nodded.\n\nCouch continued. \"Fact is, the Prime Minister's pissed. He's taking this out on me and mine. You lot gave OSAT the mandate for handling the crisis on the ground, and we fought you for that right. Well, it's proving a right pain in our asses now, and we've reached the limits of what we can do. Your people, on the other hand... well.\" Couch took another sip, watching Udo closely over the rim. She spent a moment savouring the coffee before concluding. \"That worldwide reach you were just bragging about. All those big brains. All those wonderful things you've got in containment. Surely you can think of a way to help us poor government employees out?\"\n\nUdo frowned. \"You're passing the insomnia case back to us?\"\n\nThe cop shook her head. \"No. I'm asking for your //assistance.// On behalf of the good little boys and girls of Canada's secondmost populous province. I'm always hearing about how the Foundation tries so hard to help the whole of mankind. This seems a great opportunity to put your money where your mouths are.\"\n\nUdo's tea was cold. She'd spent twenty minutes stirring it, waiting for Couch to arrive. There was no point trying to drink it now. She stood up. \"Send us whatever files you've got, and I'll see what I can do. For the children. Not for you.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Couch grinned. \"Oh, and say hello to Karen for me, would you? Assuming she hasn't taken the honourable way out already.

She read what she could of the file again; Harry was working with the Records and Archives Information Security Administration and Project CLIO to determine how much of the full file could be declassified for her eyes; he was also collating as much textual material on //Bonhomme Sept-Heures// as existed in his prodigious databases. While she waited, Udo decided to seek out an expert consultation on the matter.\n\nWhen it came to myth figures, she had an inside woman.\n\nOr at least, she'd thought she did. Brenda Corbin refused to take her calls. She left three messages on the woman's phone, and tried contacting her through the Site's direct messaging system; no dice. The messages didn't go undelivered, they simply went unanswered.\n\nPossibly, just //possibly,// that might have had something to do with the fact that Udo had only begrudgingly assisted Corbin in her research on the Victims and their manifestations of something larger.

Mataxas dropped the riding cloak in first, and closed the lid. \"Polly!\" he called out.\n\nHis daughter, Polyxeni Mataxas, emerged from the connected monitoring room. If the partition between the two spaces had been removed, the whole thing would have been the size of a comfortably spacious personal washroom. \"Hey, dad. Hey, Dr. Okorie.\"\n\nUdo waved.

No, it's just that your thaumic signature might interfere with the reading, and I'm such a true believer, my brainwaves might do the same.

Polly grinned. \"I'm a scientific believer. Late-season Scully. No Mulders allowed in here.\"\n\nUdo got the reference; Harry had showed her a few episodes of The X-Files during their latest and final attempt to make a go of it.

Some of it is merely undergoing further study before destruction, vacuum-tubed to the labs above in AAF-B, -C and -D or Applied Occultism, then sucked back down through gratings in the exam room floors. Some is stored indefinitely, because it has a practical use; the best example is the five square metre cistern on the fourth sublevel of AAF-D, unaffected by the cataclysm of 2002, which contains the //vim harenae// used by Dr. Udo Okorie to enable her acts of micamancy. It was once the soporofic sand SCP-5281 used to sedate his victims, before an out-of-control act of thaumaturgic prodigism turned the entire vat merely magical, instead of malefic.

If he was simply pretending, as everyone else did, well. He was much more convincing than them. \"This looks excellent, Dr. Wettle. Thank you.\"\n\nWettle's chest would normally have puffed out with pride at this affirmation, but the breath got caught somewhere beneath his ribs this time, and he sighed it back out instead. \"Okay. Good. Thanks.\"\n\nMcInnis cocked his head to one side. \"Something the matter?\"\n\n\"No.\" Wettle reached down to organize the papers back into a single pile. Naturally this only disorganized them further. \"No, it's good. I'm good. Alllll good.\"\n\nMcInnis reached out and neatly formatted the reports into a monolithic block. \"William, you can tell me. I won't judge. Perhaps I can help.\"\n\nThe Director almost never called him William. Virtually nobody besides his mother did. He grimaced. \"Am I useless?\"\n\nMcInnis tapped the papers. \"I have objective evidence to the contrary.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean. Am I... are you just keeping me here because of the Breach? Because I have to be here for it anyway, so you're just... stringing me along?\" It wasn't the right phrasing to convey the meaning he wanted, but no amount of searching for words ever helped, so he left it at that instead of stammering out a clarification. McInnis wouldn't care.\n\nThe other man's eyes crinkled at the corners. He looked very kind. \"I can promise you, with complete and total honesty, that this is not the case. I don't know where you got that idea from, but it is wildly incorrect. You were chosen for your post for a variety of reasons, and while I'm not at liberty to divulge them all at this time, you may consider yourself assured that your presence at Site-43 in the long-term is one of the most important elements of our ongoing projects of research, containment, and protection.\"\n\nThis time the swelling did come, and Wettle felt suddenly three inches taller. \"Thanks, sir.

Pensak was leaning on the wall next to the water cooler, in the spot that had once been hers. She was sitting on one of the desks, cross-legged, to compensate for the height difference.\n\n\"Back me up here, Roger,\" she sighed. \"For fuck's sake. Udo's cleared to know all kinds of crazy shit. She's been through hell and back with us, meaning you and me, Allan, three times already. And we know it's going to happen again. Are you concerned with how well that's going to go?

She has largely put Dr. Deering behind her. I can see no benefit to dredging up the past.\"\n\n\"The past dredges itself up! It keeps coming back! It's not //settled.//\"\n\n\"Again, without going into specifics, Dr. Ngo does not concur.\"\n\n\"You're treating her like a //child.//\" Ibanez regretted taking a seat, even if it put her eyes at Pensak's chest level instead of his belly button, because of how her position interacted with that statement. \"She deserves to get over this herself. You can't just erase people's trauma.\"\n\n\"We do it every day,\" Pensak rumbled.\n\n\"Oh, now you talk,\" she almost hissed at him.\n\nHe blinked at her. slowly. \"Sorry, was there a break in that rant where I could have said something?\"\n\n\"Delfina.\" McInnis leaned forward, hands on one knee. \"Dr. Deering's resurrection is one of the most closely-guarded secrets pertaining to SCP-5243. We don't understand it.\"\n\n\"You haven't //tried// to understand it. You need to //ask him!//\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Out of the question. It would engender possible multiversal instability to allow him to survive even a few hours past the occurrence of the Breach. I'm already very concerned that we took so long to act the first time.\"\n\nShe scoffed. \"He was dead within an hour. You decided to //murder him,// or rather, make //me// murder him, within an //hour.//\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the Director agreed. \"It should have been done immediately. But these matters are complex, and I could not get hold of our temporal experts that quickly. Dr. Deering must die in the six minutes constituting the Breach, each year, or very soon thereafter. There is no room for debate on this topic. What would it benefit Dr. Okorie to know that her former lover is still alive for those six minutes, six and change at the most?\"\n\n\"I don't have an answer for that. But if you give me more than six minutes, I'm sure I'll think of something. And you can keep the fucking change.\"\n\nPensak snorted.\n\n\"Consider Dr. Laiken,\" McInnis sighed. \"Did you think it strange how quickly that nascent relationship collapsed?\"\n\n\"They're back together again.\"\n\n\"Yes, but... you understand why Dr. Okorie involved herself with Dr. Blank in the first place, do you not?\"\n\nShe didn't feel she could answer that question without betraying her friend. She didn't say anything.\n\n\"I believe that recidivism proves my point. There is nothing shameful in allowing a close relationship to colour your outlook on life. We all heal at different rates, and perhaps Dr. Okorie heals most slowly of all, just as she ages almost imperceptibly.\" There was something in McInnis' eyes as he said that, something Pensak wouldn't recognize. Ibanez did. \"I concur with her psychologist, and even if I did not, the orders from Overwatch are clear. Only a minimum necessary number of personnel are cleared to know that Dr. Deering rejoins us briefly each year, on the anniversary of his death. I am afraid there is nothing further to discuss on the matter.\"\n\n\"Great.\" Ibanez slid off the desk, and stalked for the door. \"Thanks for the help, Rog.\"\n\nPensak's voice was almost sleepily louche. \"Don't know what you expected, honestly.

She could see it in the strange way he walked, like he was used to carrying around a lot more weight. He was walking now, to the refrigerator. \"Get you anything?\n\nShe shook her head, and smiled. \"No, sir, thank you.\"\n\nThe retired Chief Superintendent of OSAT, Couch's immediate precedessor, made a small but expressive sound of humour. \"Nobody's called me 'sir' in ages. Not my grandkids, even. Never anybody from the Foundation.\"\n\nShe was glad he'd said that. She didn't want to give him the honourific, and now she had a reason to drop it. \"I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. Where did your family go?\"\n\nHe returned from the kitchen with a bottle of beer, and twisted off the cap with rough, calloused hands. He put the cap in his pocket, and the whole neck of the bottle down his throat, and when he was done, half the bottle was already gone. Meaning its contents. She'd had her doubts until she saw the neck come back out. \"Sent them away. I don't get to do that every often, since this isn't my house. But I tell them it's government work, and they scatter. It's funny.\"\n\n\"Funny?\"\n\nHe sat down gingerly in his recliner. He had to be pushing eighty. \"If they knew anything about where I worked, they'd know not to respect it. Nobody ever did. Least of all your people.\" He frowned, as though remembering something unpleasant. \"Then again... I say 'OSAT', and they head for the hills. Just like all the ghosts and ghoulies used to do.\" He winked at her. \"Obviously they were afraid of us.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" she smiled. She hadn't expected him to have a sense of humour about OSAT's low success rate. She very much doubted Morwen Couch did. \"Chief Superintendent--\"\n\n\"Only one of those at a time, and it's Morrie Couch right now. Call me Benny.\"\n\n\"Benny.\" He did look like more of a Benny than a Benoit. He had the faintest trace of a Québecois accent, though. \"I came to talk to you about one of your cases. Something you worked on with the Foundation.\"\n\n\"Doesn't fit very many bills.\"\n\n\"And the GOC.\"\n\nHe sucked in his teeth. They looked real. \"And that can be only one. //Bonhomme Sept-Heures.//\" It was a subtle change, but the way his bearing shifted, the way his expression closed off, the way his eyes unfocused, now she wondered if he was more like ninety years old.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Bad business.\" That was the same term Couch had used. \"Still gives me nightmares.\"\n\n\"I've seen footage of him,\" Udo agreed. \"I understand.\"\n\n\"Not what I mean.\" Gauthier pulled down the rest of his bottle, and placed it on a coaster on the coffee table. \"I'm a cop. I've seen worse, if you can believe it. Even in Montréal.\"\n\nShe nodded gravely. Cops always expected this. They loved to tell you they'd seen unspecified horrors, though typically as a prelude to calling the present one worse than all the rest. At least, that was how it went on television.\n\n\"No,\" he continued, keeping eye contact with her, \"what bothers me is what //we// did. What we did to those children.\"\n\n\"You couldn't have known.\"\n\n\"Couldn't we?\" He shook his head. \"I don't know. I think we saw what we thought was the right course of action, and we took it without looking too closely. We had a destination in mind, and one path seemed to get us there fast. Preconceptions. The worst thing you can bring to any investigation.\"\n\n\"Well.\" She felt hot in the sweater she was wearing; somehow she'd expected Gauthier's home to be some greasy dive, and that he would greet her in a stained tank top and shorts, so she'd opted for clothes she could take off again when she got back to the car. But instead she'd found a middle-aged man in relatively good hygeine, in a middle-class home well-kept by its occupants. //Preconceptions indeed.// But she wasn't going to take the sweater off. In her experience, that was a good way to stop all the eye contact. \"I'm fact-finding right now, because the insomnia is still a problem, and I'd like to see if there's a way to correct that.\"\n\nHe raised his eyebrows and lowered his lids in the universal expression for //I am not impressed.// \"Since when are you folks in the problem correction business? Children dying doesn't faze you. At one time we had a dossier on what we were convinced was a Foundation-run child sacrifice ring.\"\n\n//'Get thee behind me, Moloch'.//\n\n\"I can't speak to that.\" She was grateful that this was mostly true. \"But I assure you, I want to get to the bottom of this. I want to know why it's still happening, if there's something out there hurting these children, or, I don't know, something missing from the environment that we can restore. It's our blunder, Benny. The Foundation's, and OSAT's. It's up to us to make it right.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"What do you think I can tell you, to help?\"\n\n\"You examined the files we released to you. You were in contact with the GOC. You were involved in the //Bonhomme//'s initial capture. You know as much about him as anyone else alive, I think. At least outside of Site-43. Can you think of any reason why his influence hasn't faded?\"\n\nGauthier closed his eyes, and sank back into the cushions. From the way the recliner practically consumed him, this was probably something he'd done thousands of times before. \"Mm,\" he said. \"You know, I spent an entire career chasing phantoms, and like I said, I didn't catch many. But you learn something from the chase, even if it never pans out. You follow in their wake...\" He winced, for some reason, before continuing. \"You catch a glimpse, a whiff, a flutter. You see the evidence they leave behind. The things they cause to happen. This one, he wasn't any ghost. He was a beast that walked like a man. But there was something in his eyes.\"\n\n\"You met him?\"\n\n\"I was there when they put the needle in.\" Gauthier's haunted eyes snapped open. \"He didn't understand. Didn't understand why we were doing this. From his perspective, he was just... living his life. Following his instincts. I know for a fact that he didn't need to be in that room on the day that he died. He could have vanished into thin air. But he didn't.\"\n\n\"Why? Why do you think that is?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I don't know. But after all those years on the ghost trail, even though they amounted to nothing much...\" His mouth twisted into a bitter line. \"The one thing I can tell you for certain, is that these things want to be chased. They want to be followed. They want you to //understand// them. But they want you to work for it, Dr. Okorie. They expected you to //sacrifice// for it. He could have told us what would happen when he died. He could have warned us what we were doing to those children. And I'm convinced, absolutely //convinced,//\" and he pounded the arm of his chair for emphasis, the tendons and knuckles on his hand standing out in white contrast under his ruddy skin, \"that he could have done something to stop it.

The closest to it was Elstrom, who posed in the chair like she was having her picture taken.\n\n\"I suspect that's essentially it,\" the Director told her with a closed-mouth smile. They'd only been talking for twenty minutes, and he'd managed to turn the conversation back to her and the things she was working on for well over half that time. \"There really isn't that much to say, particularly when we're running on a streak of successes between each Breach.\"\n\nNgo smiled up at him from behind her desk. She couldn't ever tell if he meant what he was saying. Perhaps he always did. Perhaps never, though it seemed less likely. \"Well, I still think it's worthwhile that we keep the appointments monthly.

There are bound to be peaks and troughs, but the general trends are what matters the most.\"\n\nHe nodded amiably. His hands were in his pockets, and he was making eye contact; it was reminiscent of a stereotypical 'friendly boss' giving directives, which was not at all the usual vibe of a psych consult. \"If you think it's best, I defer to your good judgement. I take it you'll be seeing the other Survivors soon?\" He raised a hand to forestall her reply. \"No, of course you can't tell me that. Confidentiality. I understand.\"\n\nShe had been about to tell him the answer was yes, actually. Confidentiality was entirely subordinate to security clearance levels, and anyway she'd had an... unusual relationship with the concept, for a long while now. But she didn't argue. \"I appreciate your understanding, sir, as always.\"\n\nHe nodded again. \"As I said, I trust your judgement. If you feel you need the information, we will continue to provide it. And I've no doubt you will put it to good use.\"\n\nShe felt something catch in her throat, \"I... appreciate that, as well, sir.

And you fear to think you might owe it all to me.\" And now he was more than a man; black and billowing, he was a vast, dark stormcloud. \n\nBut she was the desert.\n\n\"What are you?\" she demanded. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Just a man,\" the beast lied, \"with a hunger, and the means to feed.\"\n\n\"It can't be only that.\" She was the wind that lashed him. \"What are you to //me?//\"\n\n\"It goes the other way.\" She no longed sounded so certain. \"You are my legacy.\"\n\n\"I don't accept that. Your dust is a tool. My tool. I've shaped it to my own needs.\" She was shaping it now. It ran through her sand like veins. \"What do you think would happen if I abated it all? Would it erase you from this prison?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He was a grinning death's head. He was a featureless, unknowable force of nature. \"Perhaps you should try, if you feel that's the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"I've never known a living creature so blasé about its own life.\"\n\n\"I have died before.\" His voice was thunder.\n\n\"And you were no more concerned than you are now.\" Her voice was the wind.\n\n\"I had died before that, too.\"\n\nThe moment crystallized. They were man and woman, standing in the wastes, a city on the horizon, and the sky was grey.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked him, and he told her:\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"What's the first thing you remember?\"\n\n\"The sands.\"\n\n\"Your sand? Or these sands?\" She stamped her feet, and thrilled at the sensation on her skin as it rippled. \"A desert?\"\n\n\"A desert,\" he agreed. \"This desert. Vast and black.\" And so it was. \"I was called forth.\"\n\n\"By who?\" she demanded.\n\n\"If I did not know better, I might have said by //you.//\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Those burning eyes. I would know them anywhere.\"\n\nShe could see them reflected in the hollow pools at the back of his sunken sockets. \"I didn't create you.\"\n\n\"But you have seen the desert.\"\n\n\"Are you corrupting me?\" She raised her hands, and the earth rose up behind her. \"Making me see what you want me to see?\"\n\n\"I am a prisoner.\" He looked up at the towering wave she was posed to send crashing down over him. \"Nothing else. Once I was more. Once, I was... //so much more.// But I was broken, and then again, and now I am but a shadow on the sand.\"\n\n\"There has to be more to it than that.\"\n\n\"There is not.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you!\" She was trembling. He was casting no shadow. She had blotted out the sun, wherever it hid in the tattered fabric of the sky. \"What did you do to the children?!\"\n\n\"I existed,\" he whispered. \"Everything bends around everything else. Nothing moves without stirring its neighbour. That is the lesson of the dunes. My advent formed a niche in my mirror image, and I filled it. Now it is empty, and things fall into the gap.\"\n\n\"You're saying...\" She hesitated, and the glint in his eye said he knew it. \"You're saying they can't sleep because... you need to put them to sleep, and that's not something you caused, but reality bending around the //fact// of you? Accounting for your existence?\"\n\n\"That sounds right.\" He nodded.\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I never gave it much thought. I never gave anything much thought.\" He sneered. \"That's what you people are for.\"\n\n\"You know what?\" She lowered her arms, and the sand came crashing back down. Behind her. \"You're right.\"\n\nAnd she turned over her hands, and she reached out.\n\nBut not to touch him.\n\nHe looked down at himself, as though he could feel her probing the space within. Could sense that she knew the shape of what was inside. That she had taken it for herself. That she had owned it.\n\nThat she owned it still.\n\nShe suspected he knew and could sense these things, because for the first time -- perhaps the very first time, if the tapes were anything to go by -- //Bonhomme Sept-Heures// looked sad.\n\n\"Will you tell Noor something for me?\" he asked.\n\nShe was ready. \"No.\"\n\n\"Tell him I'm sorry.\"\n\nShe paused. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"Not in the slightest.\" The beast smiled, gently. \"But it might ease his mind to hear.\" \n\nWith a flick of her wrist, she compacted his skeleton into a handful of pulverized white meal. The remainder of him melted around it, and was carried away by the gale.

He'd been doing it for hours. Harry wished Lillian was here; she'd have dropped a heavy book on them already, and somehow gotten away with it. \"We could... get him a really good friend, right? Somebody who hangs around him all day, every day. Maybe the monster needs time to take a shine to somebody.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't help,\" Harry sighed. \"Because we wouldn't know if it worked until Phil dies, at which point whatever we're doing //has// to work.\"\n\nThey were sitting on opposite ends of a long lab counter. Harry had his notes in front of him. Wettle's notes were in one of the sinks; he hadn't put them there on purpose.\n\n\"We could do it anyway,\" Wettle suggested. \"As a backup. You get enough backups, one of them is bound to work, and you don't need to know which one before it happens.\"\n\nHarry shook his head. \"Ngo's basically already tried this. They've been making people go on dates with Phil. Never any chemistry, so he's still single.\"\n\nWettle stared at him. \"They're setting him up with dates?

It wouldn't end well. \"Maybe we could loop Imrich Sykora in on the thing.\" The thing in question, Project SARGENT, was a longstanding initiative to prepare for the worst in the event of Phil Deering's death. Nobody know what was going to happen when his mirror monster was untethered. Would it disappear? Would it latch onto someone new? Would it stay in the last reflective space it jumped into before being deprived of its constant companion, and issue that ear-splitting screech it made whenever they were separated, forever? It was a serious problem, and so far no serious solution had been proposed. Everyone outside of senior staff who participated in the brainstorming sessions was amnesticized afterward, ostensibly because it was a high security issue, but really because the official story was that multiple solutions had already been found, and they were just looking for backups now. It wouldn't do to have everyone thinking there was no game plan.\n\nAlone of the Project SARGENT staff, Harry and Wettle got to keep their sinking feeling that there would still have been no progress made when the issue went critical. Not that it seemed to bother Wettle any. He was probably used to getting pulled down.\n\nWettle waited for Harry to finish his musing -- they knew each other well enough by now to recognize muse-faces -- before saying \"I don't know who that is.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Skikora. Stickora. Nicholas Picholas. Whatever it was you just said.\"\n\n\"Imrich Sykora? You do too know him. Thaumaturge.

She wondered whether this was standard practice, to lower anyone meeting with Couch to below her stature, or if it was intended to accentuate Ibanez's own lack of verticality. It didn't matter. She knew fully well, whether the other woman showed it or not, that //she// knew where the power in the room presently resided. \"But since you mention it: the thing with the insomnia is pretty well handled, now.\"\n\nCouch raised an eyebrow. \"That so?

His eyes were crystal, and he was wearing a complex rebreather. It was the result of having had a misunderstanding with an anomalous medical system, and it gave him an otherworldly, menacing appearance. \n\nBut underneath it, he was just an average guy. \n\nThere was probably something metaphorically pertinent about that, too.\n\n\"So.\" Calvin Bold stroked his mask as though it were a goatee. \"You decommissioned 5281... again.\"\n\nUdo nodded, but it was more of a diagonal shaking of the head. \"I think of it as an acroamatic abatement, really.\"\n\nBold nodded. \"That's good. I like that. That means you're not in trouble. Except now you're going to leap to that every time you don't want to call the DeD before you neutralize an anomaly.\"\n\nShe wondered who'd called Bold's department the DeD. Probably whoever had named the D-class department 'HARMA'. \"Only we won't,\" she told him, \"because that's not something we do here anyway.\"\n\n\"Director.\" Noor Zaman was sitting on her side of the boardroom table. \"The DeD already authorized this decommissioning. It's just that it wasn't carried out correctly in the first place. Double jeopardy.\"\n\nBold made a sound like Darth Vader grunting. Possibly it was just a grunt. \"Double jeopardy is actually the thing where you can't be punished twice for the same crime. Totally the opposite of what you meant.\" He paused. \"But I take your meaning. We really screwed that one up, didn't we?\"\n\n\"We did,\" Zaman agreed. \n\n\"At this point, I think we can say that the primary anomaly here was the insomnia cases in Québec.\" Bold looked back and forth between them. \"Where are we on that? Did banishing the boogeyman help all those kids get back to sleep?\"\n\nUdo shook her head. \"No, sir. I did.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"When I neutralized the //Bonhomme,// it was basically a more elaborate version of the abatement I performed around the turn of the century. The one that created my //vim harenae.//\"\n\n\"I'm not familiar with that term. You mean the dust you sourced from 5281's corpse?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Ever since I did that, I've had a tremendously improved affinity with my Talent. I can do things now I never dreamed of before. It's become clear to me that I somehow internalized the power that was in that sand. The power that came from //him.//\"\n\nBold managed to look startled even with half of his face covered. \"You're saying you took a part of the anomaly into you? Into your body?\"\n\nZaman looked ill.\n\n\"That's right.\" She looked him right in the glass eyes. \"I don't know why, but I always had an affinity for him, and the things he left behind. I still do.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It meant that I could commune with his spirit. It meant that I could destroy him. And it means--\"\n\n\"Hold up,\" Zaman interrupted. \"Are you about to say that when you killed him for the second time, you took even more of his power?\"\n\n\"That's what I believed at the time, yes.\" Udo felt her heart racing to beat the band. \"And I now have experimental proof that this is the case.\"\n\n\"Meaning...?\" Zaman still looked stricken. \n\n\"Meaning that I went to Québec, and could almost immediately sense the location of the affected children. The ones who are experiencing some sort of withdrawal from the spiritual service the //Bonhomme// used to provide.\"\n\n\"Like, a homing instinct?\" Bold asked. \n\n\"Pretty much,\" she agreed. \n\n\"And what did you do with this instinct? Please don't tell me you...\" Bold shook his head. \"I actually don't know what I don't want you to tell me you did. So just...\" He spread his hands in defeat. \"Tell me, I guess.\"\n\n\"What do you think, sir?\" She could almost tell herself she was enjoying this. \"I put on my Halloween costume, engaged in a little B&E, and blew some sand into some tired faces.\"\n\n\"You did //what,//\" Zaman asked flatly. \n\nBold didn't look all that surprised. But then, his means of expressing that particular emotion were obviously limited. In any case, he asked the only question that mattered. \"And did it work?\"\n\nShe smiled at him in response.\n\n\"So, they're cured?\"\n\n\"I don't know about //cured.// For now, I believe I've addressed all of the active cases. They might need more spot treatments later. It might be a gradual weaning. Or it might end up needing to be a long-term solution.\" She smiled, a little nervously. \"So I might need a little more vacation than was already scheduled, in the interim.\"\n\n\"Well.\" Bold glanced at Zaman, then back at her. \"I suspect that can be handled without too much difficulty.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zaman said. He sounded stunned.\n\n\"I understand your thaumaturgy already paints a little outside the known lines,\" Bold continued. \"But this seems like a whole new paradigm.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I've been fundamentally changed by an SCP object. There's really no getting around that.\" She'd known she was going to have to say this eventually, but it made her heart sink to do it anyway.\n\nBold, however, contrived to look amused. \"Oh,\" he said. \"You get used to it.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nBold told her he would smooth things out with the DeD, and also make sure his colleagues in the Integration Program ensured she'd be able to retain her position and station despite her new anomalous augmentation. \"Least I could do,\" he told her, \"for the woman who corrected one of my worst mistakes.\"\n\nFrom the Site-43 point of view, it did also require a note on her HR file. \n\nZaman made very much the same comment when he filled it out for her. By the time she left his office, she felt almost certain the crying man had been about to try and hug her. \n\nRelief at the end of a long road was a strange drug. \n\nShe was looking forward to trying it out someday.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 18 May\n\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nIn addition to its posts at three corners of the third sublevel, Security and Containment has the entire first floor all to itself. This is where the containment chambers for Site-43's inventory of animate SCP objects and Nexus critters is kept, whether pending evaluation or serving out their non-negotiable life sentences in the name of the Foundation's protection initiative. There are considerably fewer of them now than once there were, and more empty chambers than the facility's designers ever expected. Once it was projected that space for a new row of rooms would need to be excavated by the mid-2020s; now so many chambers have been mothballed that there's been talk of turning them into extra dormitory space for the upstairs agents. This depopulation does not reflect a new policy of catch and release, but rather the practical reality of life after SCP-5243. With the annual drop in containment integrity, it is no longer safe to keep dangerous creatures locked up on the shores of Lake Huron.\n\nThese anomalies are simply being remanded to the care of other facilities, rather than achieving their freedom. In this they are luckier than the personnel who have left Site-43's employ in the wake of the Breach that Keeps On Breaching, some of whom return annually for a ghoulish display, some of whom have gone where no force pantomime can touch them, and some of whom have simply decided to stay away.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe sent the excerpt, and waited.\n\nThe response came a few minutes later.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**M_Bradbury**\nHaven't you written this bit up before?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe frowned.
