The proper origin of the poem contained in this file is unknown. \n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= Upon this dreary night he strode\n= A traveller towards his goal.\n= The snow of the end crumbled beneath his boots.\n\n= His breath slammed against his skin.\n= The breeze tried to fight him.\n= But the traveller was determined ever still.\n\n= He sighed and stared up at the monstrous tower in front of him.\n= It stood out in the wasteland they had once called \"America\".\n= Watching over the dead land,\n= The only remaining visage of a long dead council.\n\n= The traveller kicked down the steel wall that was once a door.\n= It crashed to the ground.\n= The sound echoed across the dead world.\n\n= He trudged through the reddened halls.\n= Blood still dripped from the ceiling,\n= Hundreds of years after the end of the world.\n= Hundreds of years after the extinction.\n\n= The traveller ran his hands through his white hair.\n= The seemed to creak upon touch.\n= He groaned.\n= He was an anomaly.\n\n= The traveller entered the ballroom.\n= The chandelier shuddered with each step.\n= Threatening to fall.\n= Threatening to fail.\n= Threatening to kill.\n\n= The traveller grunted as he pushed away the rubble.\n= The area was desolate.\n= The grey sterile walls barely holding up.\n= He ran his hand along the floor.\n= He knew what he was looking for,\n= And he knew he was close.\n\n= He jumped down.\n= His feet landed on the only grass that remained.\n= The bottom of the once mighty site was jarringly untouched.\n= It was filled with grass and trees. \n= It was filled with artificial life.\n= It was filled with falsehoods.\n\n= The traveller wandered to the spire that was the central database. \n= He typed manically into the system.\n= Within seconds the site was aflush with purple light.\n= The traveller smiled as the memories came flooding back.\n\n= Every order,\n= Every death,\n= Every failure,\n= Every mission,\n= Every meeting,\n= Every friend,\n= Every sacrifice,\n= Every time they called out for him.\n\n= O5-1 lay on the ground as the alarm blared.\n= He had done it.\n= The world was resetting.\n= He would soon cease to exist.\n= He sighed with as much pain as relief.\n= He looked into the fa√ßade of a sky.\n= The traveller smiled.\n\n= And as the world turned to white,\n= O5-1 closed his eyes with a smile.\n= He could finally rest.\n= He could finally die.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=vilsolad]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
