The exact length of SCP-8000 is unknown, as its tail has never been located; however, estimates range upwards to 150 meters. Instead of bounding, sliding, or swimming, SCP-8000 is capable of self-propelled flight along with phasing through solid objects, and precognition.\n\nSCP-8000 is sapient, capable of speech, and highly intelligent. Additionally, SCP-8000 can create temporary dimensional gateways at will. It is hypothesized that SCP-8000 has been connected to baseline reality from an unknown, extradimensional location. The method or reason SCP-8000 exists in present reality has not been discovered.\n\nAs of documentation, SCP-8000 is one of two living beings on Earth.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"ooo\"]]\n\n//Director Paul Lague barges into a Site-322 meeting space.

I wish I had seen it sooner.\n\n**Cimmerian:** You have the chance to fix that now.\n\n**Lague:** I know. I know I'll never be able to get rid of that feeling; I've had it my entire life, and it's brought me to heights I never could have imagined.
