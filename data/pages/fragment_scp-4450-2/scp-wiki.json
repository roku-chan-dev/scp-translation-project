Initial parathreat information was recovered from a captured agent of the Chicago Spirit, and suggests the potential of a high level type green entity; capable of creating and maintaining a potentially infinite space.\n\nOnce the entry method was recovered, strike team \"Broken Dagger\" was deployed to clear remaining Chicago Spirit and Marshall, Carter & Dark assets from the location.  Observation and attempted destruction of the locked door remains the primary point of concern regarding Extraspatial Location-0161.\n\n\n> ||||||||~ Quartermasters Division-AOD||\n> ||~ Item||~ Designation||~ Title||~ Qty||\n> ||1||AltGen-TEBC||Thaumatologically Enhanced Breaching Charges||2||\n> ||||||||**Notes:** Thaumatological means utilized to maximize destructive potential of explosives.

I don't care how tight you say that door is shut, this sonuvabitch will crack it.  Of course, it might also crack the entire dimensional structure, so I recommend removing all non-essential persons from the premises.  Just make sure you put a few dozen doors between you and the charge before you set it off. ||\n\n||||||||~ __PTOLEMY Division Weapons Research Correspondence__||\n||~ Sender||Chris Gambol||~ Recipient||Sebastian Striker||\n||||||~ Date|| 04/23/1990||\n||||||~ Subject|| ProtGen-ATsNBC||\n|||||||| This thing is a lot bigger than I pictured.  My brother and I are going to remain behind while the charge goes off, everyone else is busy getting the place cleared out.  Though, between you and me, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this bad boy takes out not just the door, but whatever's behind it too. ||",
