A cover story detailing a nuclear meltdown having occurred on 1/18/20 has been disseminated, and all former inhabitants of Site-5076-1 legally declared dead. For a complete operational purview of Veil-keeping regarding Site-5076-1, see Document-5076-V-1.\n\nMTF Lambda-8 \"Ape Mode\" is to be stationed along the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1. All online activity originating from Site-5076-1 is to be monitored. If Site-5076-1's Veil is at risk due to the online activities of an SCP-5076-A instance, all internet connection to Site-5076-1 is to be cut off for a duration of 5 hours, and the offending SCP-5076-A instance reprimanded.\n\nEntrance to Site-5076-1 outside of a Veil-restoring operation or as a member of the 5076 Cultural Exchange Liaison is forbidden without the express permission of Area-179's director, and a unanimous vote by the Ethics Committee.\n\nEntities entering or exiting Site-5076-1 without authorization are to be neutralized.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5076 refers to an anomalous event in which the inhabitants of a moderately sized human population center spontaneously disappear, followed by the appearance of sapient members of the //Pongo// genus.\n\nAs of ██/██/████, SCP-5076 has only occurred once- in Cressona, Pennsylvania- a northeastern borough formerly holding a human population of around 1500. Cressona has since been designated Site-5076-1.\n\nThe orangutan specimens inhabiting Site-5076-1- labeled SCP-5076-A, demonstrate intelligence and vocal capabilities comparable to humans as well as a ██-class technological proficiency. Human art, religion, and culture seem to be major topics of interest to SCP-5076-A.\n\nDue to the nature of their appearance at Site-5076-1, SCP-5076-A claims regarding the history and culture of their species cannot be verified. Notable claims include:\n\n* SCP-5076-A vocalize using a 'universal communication field', and are capable of speech with any biological life\n* SCP-5076-A have no connection to non-anomalous members of the //Pongo// genus existing on earth- referring to them as 'crude effigies'\n* SCP-5076-A are a race of inter-dimensional nomads known as the //Obobans//\n* SCP-5076-A have existed long before humanity\n\nSCP-5076-A have constructed what appears to be a religious shrine at the center of Site-5076-1; a random assortment of machinery- including wires, cables, automobile and computing components- arranged and modified in a way that serves no apparent purpose or function. All SCP-5076-A instances have been observed to gather around this structure at 20:00 daily, appearing to meditate as a group for hours on end. SCP-5076-A have refused to disclose the meaning of this ritual.\n\nA number of religious artifacts written in an unknown language have been recovered from Site-5076-1-         seemingly having materialized alongside SCP-5076-A- partly validating claims regarding a history. A translation of these texts- made possible through the assistance of orangutan priests- is pending.\n\nIn order to gain a more holistic understanding of //Oboban// society and beliefs, the 5076 Cultural Liaison was established. For documentation of information gained through this program, see files under 5076-CL-EP. As this exchange is still underway, 5076-CL-EP files will be updated routinely.\n\n**Addendum 5076.1:** Discovery\n[[size 0%]]@[[/size]]\nOn 1/18/2020, a staggering amount of emergency calls- mostly regarding missing persons from Cressona, Pennsylvania- came to the Foundation's attention. A large-scale amnestics program was enacted, and the perimeter surrounding Site-5076-1 was secured. A misinformation campaign regarding a nuclear meltdown was disseminated into media and law enforcement channels.\n \nHours later, a website operating under the name '//OBOBAN NATION//' was discovered, hosted from servers in Cressona. The entire website, sans the title, was written in an unknown text. The page depicted images and videos of SCP-5076-A instances engaging in routine activities at Site-5076-1. Scenes depicted //Oboban// families caring for their offspring, a recording depicting a ritual revolving around the site's makeshift shrine, and a recorded message from SCP-5076-A-402- the apparent leader of //Oboban// society, addressing the viewer in what is assumed to be the same language the website was written in. Notably, SCP-5076-A-402 does not resemble an adult orangutan.\n \n'//OBOBAN NATION//' was put under immediate digital quarantine.\n\n**Addendum 5076.2:** Engagement Log Transcripts\n\nEngagement of SCP-5076-A occurred on 5/19/2020. Because of his experience with dangerous anomalies, as well as his [DATA EXPUNGED], Area-179 senior researcher Dr. Edward Dune was chosen to initiate contact with SCP-5076-A. Researcher Angela Starse kept in contact with Dune via radio.\n\nA body camera was attached to Dr. Dune's person for documentation purposes. Transcripts of the engagement mission are listed below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Access File: Engagement Mission-5076.1-1, Codename: First Contact \" hide=\"▼ Close Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**<Begin Recording>**\n \n**Researcher Starse:** You on?\n\n**Dr. Dune:** Check.\n\n**Researcher Starse:** Be nice.\n\n //<A makeshift barricade of automobiles surrounds the immediate perimeter of Site-5076-1. Several SCP-5076-A instances- possessing firearms seized from a local gun shop- stand guard. Dr. Dune stops before the barricade.

Doctor, we mean you no harm. Our appearance here will not be permanent. It is best that you leave.\n\n **Dr. Dune:** //<shouting>// Can't. Sentient monkeys appear out of the sky and now fifteen-hundred people are missing? Oh, ape-man, you don't know the Foundation.\n\n**Researcher Starse:** Sapient.\n\n**SCP-5076-A-328:** You will be of no assistance to us. Guards, hold position. You are denied entrance to //Sao'tab//.\n\n **Dr. Dune:** Are you serious right now? Do you see what you're up against? Look behind me.

We shall escort you, doctor.\n\n//<SCP-5076-A instances guarding Site-5076-1 leave their posts and approach Dune>//\n\n**Researcher Starse:** Edward, that was terrible-\n\n**Dr. Dune:** We don't know what we're dealing with.\n\n**Researcher Starse:** You know damn well they're not a threat!\n\n**Dr. Dune:** Fifteen hundred people died, Ang. They're not a threat?\n\n**Researcher Starse:** This is a first contact engagement mission!\n\n**Dr. Dune:** This is also an DK-Class Reality Invasion scenario, with potential to lead into an SK-Class Dominance Shift.

Where are they?\n\n**SCP-5076-A-402:** Collateral damage. Not a conscious choice.\n\n**Dr. Dune:** Shitty answer.\n\n**SCP-5076-A-402:** It's the only one you're going to get.\n\n//<pause>//\n\n**Dr. Dune:** What do you want?\n\n**SCP-5076-A-402:** Six months.\n\n**Dr. Dune:** And then?\n\n**SCP-5076-A-402:** We'll be gone.\n\n**Dr. Dune:** Why? Why here?\n\n**SCP-5076-A-402:** We're nomads, doctor. It's how we live.\n\n**Dr. Dune:** No home planet?

Even I cannot explain the specifics behind our means of travel.

I corrected a few SPaG errors. Nothing major, really- except, oh- it seems that you've misspelled orangutan in every goddamn instance of the word.\n\n36! 36 fucking times you used the word 'orangutang'. 36 times I had to correct a middle-school level mistake in what's going to be an official Foundation document. What the hell, Ang? Just because you're hanging around a bunch of primates doesn't give you the excuse to start spelling like one. Get your shit together.\n\nAnyways, I had another question: why are you writing as if this wasn't just a one-time thing? SCP-5076 should be designated Cressona, not the event of monkeys appearing out of thin air, yeah? It's ultimately your call, but it's something to consider. I doubt Roman's going to approve of those conprocs just because there's a //slight// chance it'll happen again. Maybe I'm missing something, though. It's late. Get back to me soon.\n\nRegards,\nDr. Edward T.

This is why you're a frequent topic of discussion for Site Administration.\n\nOnto business- yes, you have every right to question my judgement on the SCP-5076 denotation. In fact, I was midway through the first draft when I got news from the Liaison team. Those translations they were working on with //Bo'naub// are done. He was reluctant to translate this particular book, but felt he was 'doing the right thing'- apparently against the wishes of //Gabo'an//.\n\nI took a look at them, and- well, I think it's best for you to see for yourself.\n\nPet theory: that thing they're building in the center of town? It's not a shrine. It's a communications tower, and every night they're sending a distress signal to whatever is left of their race.\n \nI've attached the addendum below. You'll see what I mean. We should be cautious, Edward.\n\nI'm not sure what we've gotten ourselves into.\n\nBest Wishes,\nAngelina Starse, Senior Researcher, Area-179\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n\n> **Addendum 5076.3:** Recovered and Translated Artifact from Site-5076-1\n>\n> The following is a translated portion from the SCP-5076-A religious text- //On Creation, and its End//- supposedly written by a great Oboban prophet-king, foretelling the 'death of life', and the last days of SCP-5076-A society:\n \n\n> //We, great Progenitors of Life,//\n> //Universe, sing to us//\n> //Our Creations bear Creations,//\n> //Images of us//\n> //Eons, this will be so//\n> //I say, this will be so//\n> //All 13 Houses of Bo-Too'a//\n> //United, creating, traveling//\n> //We, nomad Gods of Life//\n> //Creations, vast and without end//\n> //Will one day fall//\n> //In the Millennia of the Damned//\n> //He will come//\n> //The Tribes Shall Be Split//\n> //on the Black Night of His arrival//\n> //Our Canvas shall cry out and soon be silenced//\n> //By the Jaws of His Presence//\n> //We shall run, endlessly throughout our Creation//\n> //He will pursue//\n> //We will scatter, to the depths and cracks of Our Canvas//\n> //Each time, He will find us//\n> //Brothers and Sisters lost, awaiting contact//\n> //He has already found them//\n> //Wherever our House be built//\n> //He will dismantle it//\n> //I say to you, listen//\n> //His coming is swift- His pursuit endless//\n> //Dread Devourer of Stars, He is inescapable//\n> //The Prison of Glass cannot stand//\n> //The Chains of String cannot hold//\n> //The Blaspheme of Order cannot continue//\n> //Wherever we roam//\n> //The Death of Life follows//\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n\n{{.}}\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5075]]] | SCP-5076 | [[[SCP-5077]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=J Dune]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 18388472240_fd1f7743b1_b.jpg\n> **Name:** Chester Zoo\n> **Author:** Nigel Swales\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/28946988@N07/18388342938 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** GcdlP5H.png\n> **Author:** [[*user J Dune]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5076 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
