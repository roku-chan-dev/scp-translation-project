Due to these issues, site staff had to lock it down to where an article could not take its place. Following this occurrence, four more SCP slots fell victim to this glitch. From this point forward, these slots became known as **\"Slot Goblins\".**\n\nWell, these glitches have subsided and the slots are now officially free to be used. To celebrate, we're holding GoblinCon as a competition to fill these five slot goblins! To do so, each slot will be given its own theme and you will have seven days to write an SCP article for exactly //one// of those themes of your choice. Let GoblinCon commence!\n\nSo what's the gimmick here? Well, in honor of deletions being the cause of slot goblins -- there can only be one! Any article that fails to win the contest (and be granted one of the formerly goblined slots) will be wiped away from the wiki! It's a battle royale, and only the last article standing will survive!\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n...\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nWell, okay, when we say \"wiped away from the wiki\", we mean **unlisted for two weeks**. We won't actually be deleting the articles (unless an author asks), but we'll be hiding them to get the ambiance as if we had and preserve upvotes/comments. At the end of the two week period, talk to a staff member and we'll relist your article into an open SCP slot.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Slot Goblins, Themes, and Winners:\n++++ 3775 - Class of '76: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3775  A Wild Party]\n++++ 5257 - Glitches: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5257  A Crappy Idea]\n++++ 6467 - Fantasy Goblins: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6467  Boblin the Goblin]\n++++ 6109 - Battle Royale: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6109  Melitzah]\n++++ 6183 - Deletions: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6183  B L A C K B O X]\n[[/=]]\n\n+ Important Dates:\n\n**Announcement:** May 12^^th^^, 2023, 12:01 AM Eastern Time\n**Posting Opens:** May 19^^th^^, 2023, 12:01 AM Eastern Time\n**Posting Closes:** May 25^^th^^, 2023, 11:59 PM Eastern Time\n**Results Decided:** June 2^^nd^^, 2023, 12:01 AM Eastern Time\n**Articles Relisted:** June 16^^th^^, 2023\n\n[[iframe https://scpwiki.github.io/timer/timer.html?lang=en&time=2023-06-02T04%3A00%3A35.100Z&progress=Voting+ends+in style=\"width: 750px; height: 200px; border: 0; text-align: center;\"]]\n+ Entries:\n\n[[=]]\nEntries will appear here after the posting period begins on May 19^^th^^, 2022, 12:01 AM Eastern Time\n[[/=]]\n\n++ SCP-3775 - Class of '76\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 +_goblin-76\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n\n++ SCP-5257 - Glitch\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 +_goblin-glitch\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n++ SCP-6467 - Fantasy Goblin\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 +_goblin-goblin\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n++ SCP-6109 - Battle Royale\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 +_goblin-royale\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n++ SCP-6183 - Deletions\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 +_goblin-deletions\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n+ Final Results\n[[/=]]\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default adult\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+goblincon2023 -hub -donotshowupinmodule\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"rating desc\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n[[=]]\nCongratulations to [[*user Billith]] for winning Goblincon with their entry, [[[SCP-6183]]]!\n\n[[/=]]\n\n+ Entry Instructions:\n\n**This contest is a little bit different, so read carefully!**\n\n\n**1.** Post your entry to the site with the url {{'goblincon-XXXX-[yourusername]'}} with the slot you are entering for in place of {{XXXX}} and your site user name in place of {{[yourusername]}}. You should give the article a title in the format of {{'SCP-XXXX - YOUR TITLE'}}.\n\nFor example, if I (stormbreath) was submitting my article \"Kirk Lonwood Community College\" to the Class of '76 theme, my article would have the url {{'goblincon-3775-stormbreath'}} and the title {{'SCP-3775 - Kirk Lonwood Community College'}}.\n\n**2.** Add the tag \"{{goblincon2023}}\" to your entry so it shows up on this page.\n\n**3.** Add the corresponding theme tag for whichever theme you are interested in. The following are the available theme tags:\n\n\"{{_goblin-76}}\" for SCP-3775\n\"{{_goblin-glitch}}\" for SCP-5257\n\"{{_goblin-goblin}}\" for SCP-6467\n\"{{_goblin-royale}}\" for SCP-6109\n\"{{_goblin-deletions}}\" for SCP-6183\n\n\n[[=]]\n-- **Do not post before posting opens; this will result in a disqualification!** --\n[[/=]]\n\n+ Tagging:\n\nAs previously stated, adding the tag \"{{goblincon2023}}\" to your entry will cause it to show up on this page and you will need to add your theme tag so we know which theme you are theme you wish to enter. We encourage you to also //tag your entries yourself// if you feel comfortable with doing so.  To make the whole process smoother, we have [[[a-laymen-s-guide-to-tagging|Laymen's Tagging Guide]]] and a [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list list of all current tags]. Please make sure to consult these when self-tagging, they're great resources!\n\n[[=]]\n-- **Do not add the \"{{scp}}\" tag yourself! This must be performed by a member of the tagging team!** --\n[[/=]]\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask anyone in the [http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main#toc8 tagging subteam] for assistance, either via Wikidot PM or on [https://discord.gg/G8WypMXYNQ MAST's official Discord server].\n\n+ Rules:\n\n* Be kind to others. Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated and can lead to disqualification of your own entry.\n\n* Only one entry is allowed per user and __you are only allowed to choose one of the five themes.__ **Collaborations are allowed,** but that will count as the one entry for all collaborators. Collaborations must be under a single theme.\n\n* Pre-existing drafts are not allowed. All entries should be brand new in origin.\n\n* Edits are allowed while the posting period is ongoing. After the posting period is closed, edits that change the article's content significantly will no longer be permitted. SPaG edits are allowed, as are cases approved by the contest marshalls.\n\n* Articles can not be submitted anonymously for this contest due to time constraints regarding the short posting period.\n\n* Winners will be determined by vote count. There will be first-place winners for each theme, as well as a Grand Prize Winner for the entry with the highest overall vote count. The first-place winners will have their articles moved to their corresponding \"slot-goblin\" slots as their prize. The Grand Prize Winner will have an article of their choice featured on the front page.\n\n* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.\n\n* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests with the possibility of further disciplinary action being taken depending upon the act in question. Examples of shenanigans include, but are not limited to:\n * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of posting.\n * Spamming other users with messages concerning your work.\n * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's.\n\n* The contest marshals for this contest are [[*user stormbreath]], [[*user Modulum]], [[*user Naepic]] and [[*user WhiteGuard]]. As stated above, if you have questions concerning the contest, feel free to reach out to them or another [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/community-outreach-main|Community Outreach team member]]]. The contest marshals will have the ability to disqualify entries for violations of the above-listed rules, egregiously poor sportsmanship not otherwise enumerated, or failure to fit the theme. All decisions are appealable to the contest marshals.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n^^Special thanks to [[*user Modulum]] for the banner design created in preparation for this contest!^^\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** banner.png\n> **Author:** [[*user modulum]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/goblincon SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Goblin illustration from 19th century.jpg\n> **Author:** John Dickson Batten\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:goblin_illustration_from_19th_century.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
