This module is temperature- and moisture-controlled, protected by padlock, and located in Area-518 beneath Simcoe County, ON, Canada.\n\nSCP-6705 experimentation may only occur with express permission from the interceding Ethics liaison, under the direction of newly appointed Project Leader Dr. Cassandra Báthory. Under no circumstances is testing to occur otherwise. Foundation agents stationed within North American hospital networks are to be given a list of individuals in the region with the capacity to give birth, who have also had multiple amnestic regimens. These individuals are liable to trigger a Brynner Event, and under no circumstances are these individuals to be admitted to the hospitals. Agents are given free reign under Protocol-23-Gallikers to invent any potential cover story effaceable at denying these individuals the right to give birth, as the ability to avoid Brynner Events is the most effective at containing the creation of SCP-6705.\n----\n**Description:** SCP-6705 is a psychotropic drug that induces effects extending an as-yet-uncertain range beyond its user.\n\nEach vial of SCP-6705 is located within a small, vacuum-sealed package alongside a medical syringe. Each package is labelled on the front with the name “ATTAKASHIC™,” and on the back with instructions for administering injections behind the head. These instructions mimic FDA “Supplement Facts” labels on foodstuffs but contain no information regarding the chemical makeup of SCP-6705 beyond “milk.” The injected drug is of white colouration, high luminosity (~1 500 lumens), and has been observed creating anomalous neurological patterns within the brain.\n\nAfter injection, the drug binds with synaptic terminals in neurons of the corpus callosum using an as of yet unidentified neurotransmitter with a similar structure to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This decreases functions within the corpus callosum, effectively splitting function between the right and left brain. Then, it exposes the affected human's remaining cranial lobes to higher-dimensional constructs through unknown means. Neural imaging of a subject injected with SCP-6705 shows chemicals similar to those found in opioids binding with neurons across both remaining hemispheres, but the apparently non-anomalous nature of these chemicals [[[scp-3966|does not demonstrate how this dimensional exposure could take place]]].\n\nFollowing initial binding within the brain, all humans injected with SCP-6705 go through identical phases of the “high.” At first, affected subjects all experience similar decreases in cognitive ability for the first few hours after injection, displaying a lack of metaconsciousness, an inability to access their autobiographical memory, and an inability to think abstractly regarding certain topics or behaviors. Subjects instead describe many of these functions subsumed by their connection with the higher dimension, whose nature apparently performs these functions for the subject. When subjects are asked to describe themselves thinking, they become confused or hostile, and verbalize aloud questions to an entity that is not present, asking for advice. Following 10 hours of this behavior, at which time the subject is otherwise able to function in a normal manner, biologically and socially, all affected humans enter a comatose state. This is preceded by thirty minutes of increasing heart rate and blood pressure, as well as a building rush of oxytocin and other endorphins. During the comatose state, the brain of each affected subject displays unexpectedly elevated levels of neural activity. MRI scans taken throughout the duration of each coma show physiological processes that closely mirror the formation and structuring of interstellar nebulae, albeit on an accelerated time frame.\n\nAccording to retrieved documents (designated **SCP-6705-A**), the drug operates on the conjecture that humanity formed an additional, incorporeal layer of psyche ~11 000 years before present, in the early Holocene.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Holocene:** The current developmental epoch. Described by an increase in global warmth and the emergence and advancement of modern humanity.[[/span]] This was confirmed by a joint archeological and psychological study conducted between Foundation anthropologist Nadezda Lim and consciousness-imprint artificial intelligence Jaynes.aic, which was based on civilian psychological researcher and Foundation–Yale University liaison Dr. Julian Jaynes. This study involved demonstrating that the interior structure of the skulls of humans, in the range between ~11 000 and 3 000 years ago, displayed a brain structure similar to those in SCP-6705 patients. This structure is discussed extensively in Jaynes' book //The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind//, which argues that the state that SCP-6705 induces began as the norm for cognition in the human species, but that access to this layer of psyche probably decreased as an evolutionary benefit, possibly in relation to the [[[scp-4540|Bronze Age]]] [[[scp-2095|collapse]]].\n\nDuring verification of these claims, researchers administered SCP-6705 on willing participants. Affected humans experienced the exchange of large memetic payloads between noospheric connection points inside their brains and another, external location. Such connections have been previously identified in Project PROKAREYEOTA (which studied deep consciousness scans of anatomically modern humans and memome[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Memome:** The complete set of memes stored in the mind of a person.[[/span]] maps of artificially selected human clones).\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n= **I.

Teodora was a former D-Class volunteer during hir prison service, as part of the Winnipeg Agreement between the Foundation and the government of Canadian Prime Minister Andrew Scheer. During that time, xe received a regular [[[updated-amnestics-guide|Class-C amnestic regimen]]], as per standard protocol.

Teodora and hir boyfriend, Lalo Adefope, meeting a [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere, Inc.[[/span]] recruitment operative, the American former cult member [[[uiu-file-2014-014|Jack Skaldir]]], at a party. Nine months exactly hence from that event, nearly to the minute, on-duty hospital ER workers enrolled Mx. Teodora into the Maternity Ward with an attending physician.\n\nHospital staff later reported an unexplained amnestic event occurring over the next half-hour, centred on the Maternity Ward. Copious amounts of luminescent white fluid soaked a bed and covered the floor of one vacant room, extending past the threshold and into the hall. A hallway-posted information packet indicated the room was assigned to one “Camilla Teodora, Our Nebulaic Progenitor and Emissary.” Mx. Teodora hirself could not be located.\n\nOn 08 August, hospital staff discovered the 3 000 vials of SCP-6705 in a supply storage room. Luminescent fluid inside the room led into the hall for 15 m before terminating. Per the 2024 Foundation–UNGOC Anomalous Handling Agreement, Section 5.11.1, hospital workers contacted the Foundation to extract the materials.\n\nThis was the first recorded Brynner Event.\n----\n@@ @@\n= **II.

Researchers accessed existing computer simulations of the human brain -- created to explain //déjà vu// and //presque vu// -- that identify how the brain might respond to specifically constructed anomalous memeplexes. In these simulations, the human brain processed the memeplexes in a location beyond its physical extents, in a structure then designated the Quadratural Lobe.\n\nResearchers, believing testing with SCP-6705 had supplied the first tangible demonstration of the lobe's existence, replicated antimemetic perception imaging in a control batch without SCP-6705, and could not locate the lobe.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"card-block\"]]\n= **== UPDATE ==**\n\nPlans on fabricating a diluted form of SCP-6705 for conscious experimentation have been proposed and are undergoing further Ethics review.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"card-block\"]]\n= **== UPDATE ==**\n\nAs of 08 August 2025, representatives of [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere, Inc.[[/span]] worked out a deal with the Iraqi government to build a new, large-scale production facility in the approximate location of the UNESCO World Heritage Site for the City of Uruk.
