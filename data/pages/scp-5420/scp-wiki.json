A temporary alliance between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Foundation has been created in order to suppress public knowledge of as well as to explore SCP-5420. Through this agreement:\n# SCP-5420 containment is to be put under the jurisdiction of Site-196, Foundation Home Base (FHB).\n# SCP-5420-A is to be constantly observed by NASA-Foundation Probe 7-B.\n# Foundation web-crawlers are to monitor any information regarding SCP-5420.\n# The LANCER Project is to be established in order to determine the source of SCP-5420-A.\n\nProbe 7-B is to be in geosynchronous orbit with SCP-5420-B in order to take scans of SCP-5420 every ten minutes; these scans are to be compiled into a video feed and archived in storage at FHB. FHB and NASA Central Command (CenCom) are to have joint control over the LANCER Project.\n\n----\n\n[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]\n\nSCP-5420 is an asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter, in the outer region of the Asteroid Belt. An analysis of SCP-5420 revealed that its orbit is slightly decaying - it has been theorized that SCP-5420 may have originated from the Kuiper Belt. The apogee of SCP-5420's orbit occurs approximately every 13 years; the One-Way Radio Time (OWRT) at this point is 5.1 minutes. However, SCP-5420's main purpose appears to be a vessel for SCP-5420-A. SCP-5420-A is a high-frequency radio signal which has yet to be meaningfully deciphered and has no auditory effect on humans.\n\nScans from Probe 7-B revealed a structure resembling a double-tiered mortuary temple from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom era, designated SCP-5420-B. SCP-5420-B appears to have been relief carved into a hill on SCP-5420, and a flight of stairs from the surface leads to the second tier. It also appears to continue subterraneously, although that cannot be confirmed at the present time.\n\nThe official NASA designations for SCP-5420 and related objects are below:\n* SCP-5420: 1737 Meta\n* SCP-5420-A: Meta Signal\n* SCP-5420-B: Surface Anomaly 114-Y6\n* Probe 7-B: Meta Probe Four\nFoundation documentation will use the prior designations; NASA ones will use the latter.\n\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5420/signal-scan.png|width=200px|caption=ABOVE: Plasma scan of Meta, 08 Aug. 2019.  \nBELOW: Plasma scan of Meta, 13 Sep. 2019.]]\n\n[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]\n\nSCP-5420 and SCP-5420-B was discovered in early 1966 during primary surveying of Mars and surrounding bodies. It was originally designated Meta, the 1737th minor planet discovered. Meta's other anomalous properties (SCP-5420-A) were not known at that time.\n\nSCP-5420-A was discovered during the tenure of the SETI program in the late 1970s; the Arecibo Observatory radio-telescope in particular.\n\nIn 1980, a Foundation-NASA joint mission attempted to reach SCP-5420, but it was concluded that neither party had the expendable technology at that time to complete a round trip[[footnote]] The trip, according to the calculations performed, would have been approximately a four-month one-way trip; neither the technology nor information allowed for an accurate landing on SCP-5420 within an acceptable margin of error.[[/footnote]].\n\nProbe 7-B was launched in 1992 and became fully operational in 1993. It was also at this time that long-range telescopic imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope was used to enhance the quality and confirm the presence of SCP-5420-B.\n\n----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; background-color: #fffdf0; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ADDENDA ARE LEVEL 3/5420 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THESE ADDENDA WITHOUT LEVEL 3/5420 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n----\n[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** LANCER Project Proposal[[/size]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#f9efc2; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; font-family: \"Courier New\", monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 130%]]\n[[collapsible show=\"« NASA Proposal »\" hide=\"» NASA Proposal «\"]]\n[[/size]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#fffdf0; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left; font-family: var(--body-font);\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5420/header-image.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[size 200%]] **LANCER PROJECT** [[/size]]\n------\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n+++ **1 - OBJECTIVE**\nThe purpose of the joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Foundation project  LANCER is to reach 1737 Meta using currently viable and replicable technology. The target date to land on Meta is on 13 September 2019, the apogee of its orbit. Meta Probe Four, the first probe launched to reach geosynchronous orbit over Surface Anomaly 114-Y6, can be used for both video monitoring of the Lancer landing as well as a radio projector. Although the failure of Lancer I in 1967 was in no part due to an untrained crew, a three-man crew of Foundation-affiliated NASA astronauts have been prepared.\n@@ @@\n+++ **2.a - LANCER PERSONNEL**\nThe crew will consist of the following:\n* Paul Catani [Italy] - Commander\n* Edward Yates [UK] - Meta Module Pilot\n* Alan Milner [US] - Command Module Pilot\nAll three astronauts have varying level of specialties pertinent to landing on Meta. Cmdr. Catani is a trained module pilot and geology expert. Meta Mod. Pilot Yates is a biomedical technician and history/archaeology expert. Cmnd. Mod. Pilot Milner is a communications and engineering expert. Requisite training - including water egress - has been completed by all three. The Lancer crew will be armed with Foundation-produced MBA Gyrojets in case of defense purposes. A standard survival kit will be provided. Per NASA requirement, the Lancer crew will also be given a penetrometer and instructed to take soil samples. Crew will be fitted with Suit HR5, yellow-orange color scheme and smoked visors.

Despite the stray from flight pattern deviations, the pilot capsule landed in an easily retrievable area. However, upon Foundation recovery crews arrival at the scene, the capsule was found to be mostly submerged. Medical and recovery teams acted quickly, but they were unable to save the lives of NASA/Foundation astronauts Paul Catani, Edward Yates, and Alan Milner. An investigation into the capsule's submergence revealed the capsule hatch had been opened from the inside; possibly a result of the astronauts' lack of water egress training.\n\nLancer II's recovery failure has been attributed to panic from the water submersion and possible 'psychological imbalance' leading to the immediate opening of the hatch - causing the drowning of the three crew members. This is corroborated by a signal from the capsule received seven minutes after impact[[footnote]] Cmdr. Catani and Yates pleading to \"get us out of here\" and that they \"were trapped\".[[/footnote]]. Fault has also been found in the radio logs sent/transferred by Meta Probe Four. A lack of an imaging system on the probe also contributed to misleading logs of Meta. Even in light of the unfortunate deaths of the Lancer crew, the \"Mission to Meta\" was overall a resounding success and provided fruitful in gaining invaluable data on SCP-5420.\n\nAn autopsy of the three astronauts was attempted, but due to the impossibility of removing the  corpses from the spacesuits, the official cause of death has been listed as drowning. The reason for the difficulties with the spacesuits is currently unknown. The spacesuit material was unable to be penetrated and the suit's seals could not be released. In accordance to the last wishes of the crew, the corpses of all three will be cremated and their ashes scattered into the ocean.\n\nA proposal for another Lancer flight will not be attempted.\n[[>]]\n-- Prepared by O5-9\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5419]]] | SCP-5420 | [[[SCP-5421]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
