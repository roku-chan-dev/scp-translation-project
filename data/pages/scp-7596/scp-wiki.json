Following the completion of this investigation, the damaged infrastructure of Site-322 will be repaired, and SCP-7596 will be placed in a large vacuum chamber for further study and testing.\n\nSite-322 personnel are being subpoenaed by a joint commission composed of Ethics Committee and Decommissioning Department upper-level staff. Failure to respond to meeting requests and interviews will be met with disciplinary action.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7596 is a stable singularity, roughly 4 meters in diameter, floating in an artificial cavern below Site-322. Foreign material that passes through SCP-7596's event horizon undergoes a spaghettification process, then vanishes into the singularity and becomes unrecoverable. SCP-7596 poses no known danger of expanding.\n\nFloating inside SCP-7596 are eight bodies in a state of suspended animation, all wearing Foundation uniforms. Efforts to identify them are presently underway.\n\nSCP-7596 is situated in Basement Level 34 of Site-322. An unknown series of events led to the destruction of this area, likely due to a tremendous release of force. Further information regarding its creation is currently unknown. The ongoing investigation has been divided between the Foundation's Decommissioning Department and The Ethics Committee.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe above file was created by Director Calvin Bold and Doctor Jeremiah Cimmerian (EC-1) for the purposes of the SCP-7596 investigation, and has been distributed to all relevant parties. Below is the timeline of events that led to the creation of SCP-7596.\n\n= [[size 140%]]**TIMELINE** [[/size]]\n\n[[size 130%]]**The Applied Paratechnology Department** [[/size]]\n\nIn compliance with a directive issued by the Overseer Council, Site-322 was assigned limited authority over the Foundation's vast array of paratechnology, designated the Applied Paratechnology Section. Director Lague placed the department under the guidance of Doctor Anthony Coix.\n\nMembers of the Overseer Council, Site-322 Director Paul Lague, and a select group of 9 personnel who were specifically designated to work within the Applied Paratechnology Section were given clearance.\n\n[[div class=\"interview coix\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE’S INTERVIEW WITH DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX**\n-----\n**EC-1:** What do you do, Coix? Lague has you here as ‘Co-Site Director’. That’s not an official position.\n\n**Coix:** O-Oh, well, It’s a… (//gestures//) personal relationship. If you, uh, read a little bit further down you’ll see I supervise the Research board and—\n\n**EC-1:** You’re the head of research?\n\n**Coix:** No, I supervise him. And— and I assist Director Lague in all matters personal and private, at his discretion. Like having another pair of arms.\n\n//EC-1 adjusts his glasses, and squints at Coix’s file.//\n\n**EC-1:** We’re under Security Clearance 4, you can drop the pretense.\n\n**Coix:** Ah, my bad— sir. I’m the Chair for the Applied Paratech Section.\n\n**EC-1:** Anything in your background qualify you for that role, Coix?\n\n**Coix:** An amplitude of introductory engineering classes in my 20s, uh, over 15 years of experience overseeing Foundation projects, and an eye for picking the best and brightest.\n\n**EC-1:** You’re a middle manager, Coix?\n\n**Coix:** Project management and organization would be my specialty, sir. Regardless of the… ideological reception to Director Lague’s Integration Program, the Overseers wanted his directorial oversight on their projects. We had options; Applied Paratech seemed the most promising. And ethical, sir.\n\n**EC-1:** So they wanted Lague for this and got you?\n\n**Coix:** He’s a very busy man.\n\n**EC-1:** This department focuses on… (//Adjusts glasses//) “maintaining a modest database of paratechnology potentially useful to the Foundation. How it works, what it’s made of, what it does, and then sending it back to whatever Site it came from.”\n\n**Coix:** That was our initial department focus. The Council demanded changes in exchange for leniency on the Integration Program.\n\n**EC-1:** Such as?\n\n**Coix:** I need direct permission to tell you, sir. I do apologize, but—\n\n//(EC-1 slides a document to Coix, who examines it.)//\n\n**Coix:** Oh geez. //[...]// Well, uh, initially, between Lague and I, we were thinking more… technical archive, less Skunk Works.\n\n**EC-1:** What does that mean?\n\n**Coix:** Okay, so, Skunk Works was a laboratory at DARPA that was--\n\n**EC-1:** No, technical archive.\n\n **Coix:** Oh. Well, we were more interested in recording interesting applications of paratechnology. Eigenweapons, physics-defiant mechanisms, anomalous computer viruses -- after the whole [[[SCP-7525-EX]]] thing, RAISA got on the Council's ass about keeping track of these things, which meant that Council got on //our// ass about it. But they were adamant that our primary goal was to assist the security of the Foundation. Whatever that meant was up to them. Now ethically, I tried to—\n\n**EC-1:** Do you want to supervise a project ever again, Coix?\n\n**Coix:** I, well, we—\n\n**EC-1:** Then stop blaming everyone else and play some goddamn ball.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Applied Paratechnology Section was assigned the crucial task of procuring valuable research and items to benefit the Foundation's operations. Despite the department's significant contribution to the Foundation, little was known about the full extent of its operations before the SCP-7596 investigation. It remains unclear if any of the Applied Paratechnology Section's research had been applied prior to the SCP-7596 incident. With the aid of the Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), sealed files pertaining to a top-secret project called \"Isadore\" were eventually unearthed, uncovering a wealth of previously undisclosed information.\n\n[[size 130%]]**Project Isadore** [[/size]]\n\nProject Isadore was a highly significant research endeavor that involved the entire team of the Applied Paratechnology Section, earning a reputation among the staff as a capital project.\n\nPrior to Isadore’s execution, the Overseer Council had been aggressively advocating for all Foundation data to be transferred to Site-7's pocket dimension storage servers. Numerous Sites had yet to make substantial progress on the data transfers.\n\nDespite the initial confidence placed in Site-7's pocket dimension storage, a number of issues were later identified. The most pressing issue was the occurrence of data corruption when attempting to transfer large quantities of information through the semistabilized Y-class dimensional gate. The resulting consequences ranged from file deletion to data corruption to the occurrence of inexplicable blackouts.\n\nThe overarching goal of Project Isadore was to design an interdimensional file transfer system that could be deemed indestructible. In the context of the project, \"indestructible\" was defined by the staff as a system that was self-repairing, self-updating, and impervious to all forms of external attack.\n\n[[div class=\"interview davis\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS**\n-----\n**EC-1:** You were Isadore staff?\n\n**Davis:** Yes, sir. I was responsible for heading the development side of the project.\n\n**EC-1:** Anything else?\n\n**Davis:** Right, sorry. I— We get project requests sent based on levels of demand, I guess. 5 being pertinent and 1 being whenever, basically. Isadore was a 6. The hardware package we made was built with a monitor sourced from, uh, a digital terrorist. Gamers Against Weed, if I remember correctly. They used it for data storage, something like 500 petabytes. God knows what for, but it was what we had lying around.\n\n**EC-1:** And this is the monitor Chairman Coix said was… “slapped together”?\n\n**Davis:** Are you kidding? We didn’t have a quarter of the time we needed. We’re lucky it was “slapped together” at all. We put it into this empty steel frame where we hooked server connection ports, Internet and Bluetooth connectivity, and a perpetual generator from the Paratech archive. Again, it was a mess, but Coix set the deadlines.\n\n**EC-1:** And you spoke for your team.\n\n**Davis:** Look, I tried to get my men on schedule as best as I could. I told him we needed more time, but there’s only so many times you can say something here before you’re on the other side of the door.\n\n**EC-1:** If Coix wasn’t listening, then why not communicate these concerns to the Council, Davis?\n\n**Davis:** Because that was Coix’s job.\n\n(//EC-1 sighs, and continues typing.//)\n\n**EC-1:** So it worked. This device.\n\n**Davis:** //[...]// For a time, it did. Jones wanted to inspect it before she let us hook it up to RAISA’s hardware. So — uh, we brought it into the pocket dimension for a test run.\n\n**EC-1:** And this is where th—\n\n**Davis:** Sir, I’d like to clarify that I had nothing to do with the Isadore testing parameters. Coix headed the experimentation. All Coix.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 130%]]**Cross Into Site-7's Pocket Dimension** [[/size]]\n\nOn May 24, 2023, Project Isadore was completed on schedule and transported to Site-7's pocket dimension. Maria Jones, the director of RAISA and Site-7, was granted authorization to test the Isadore machine on a secured test server.\n\n[[div class=\"interview coix\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX**\n-----\n**Coix:** I slept maybe five total hours that week — we all did. So when I had my team draft an outline for the testing procedures they—\n\n**EC-1:** Oh, for the love of god.\n\n**Coix:** They, uh, forgot that transporting a large amount of data into Site-7 led to corruption. This thing had 5000 terabytes of test files on it.\n\n**EC-1:** What do you mean, “forgot”?\n\n**Coix:** Well, they— I mean, we had an experimental coating around the server that had been used in previous data transfer tests with great success.\n\n**EC-1:** Then //why// is there a black hole in Site-322’s basement?\n\n**Coix:** It was experimental, sir.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/CERN_Server_03.jpg/1280px-CERN_Server_03.jpg|\n    caption=Site-7 server farm CHRYSALIS.|\n     align=right\n]]\n\nAs SCP-7596-1, the monitor containing data, was linked to a power source and the quarantined server, it booted as expected. Researcher James Davis then initiated a command for data upload. However, Site-7 immediately experienced a power outage while SCP-7596-1 generated immense amounts of heat and vibrated violently. As a result, the server connected to SCP-7596-1 exploded, prompting Isadore personnel to quickly remove it from the power source, which temporarily resolved the issue.\n\nSuddenly, SCP-7596-1, which lacked a built-in power supply, unexpectedly booted and displayed a message on its CRT monitor that read, \"I MUST SELF-DESTRUCT [sic].\" Attempts to investigate the machine's steel frame proved futile as all tools were rendered ineffective.\n\n[[div class=\"interview coix\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX**\n-----\n**Coix:** The shitshow started here.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 130%]]**Transport back to Site-322** [[/size]]\n\nMaria Jones ordered the immediate removal of SCP-7596-1 from the server farm to prevent any further Site-wide damage. Upon examination, SCP-7596-1 was found to be entirely indestructible, with all known tools, weaponry, and anomalous influence proving to be completely ineffective against it.\n\n[[div class=\"interview lague\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE**\n-----\n**Lague:** You guys don’t do discipline, yeah?\n\n**EC-1:** That would be Internal Security, Director.\n\n**Lague:** Great. Listen, I kept my nose out of whatever Paratech was doing. Had enough on my plate with Integration. Wasn't my vibe, and the Council knew that. So I put Coix in charge. Consider him the Frank Wells to my Michael Eisner.\n\n**EC-1:** I don’t follow, but your performance as a Site Director is not of the question, Paul.\n\n**Lague:** I'm just giving some background; I wasn't involved. I would get weekly reports but they'd go into a pile. On top of everything else I had to read. I didn’t even know there were problems until Coix hits me at 4 in the morning with an emergency warning, begging me to get down to the Site as soon as possible.\n[[/div]]\n\nDirector Paul Lague became involved in this case following SCP-7596-1's newly gained anomalous phenomena, despite being initially skeptical about his ability to assist Applied Paratechnology Section personnel. After the appearance of further anomalous phenomena, Lague ordered that SCP-7596-1 be contained as a precautionary measure.\n\n[[div class=\"interview lague\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE**\n-----\n**Lague:** Apparently, it was given internet and Bluetooth connectivity. We don't know exactly what happened; we couldn't get into it to see. It started talking though — through text, I mean. Usually when something’s talking, my chances of getting it to shut up drastically increase.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"interview davis\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS**\n-----\n**Davis:** Our leading hypothesis is that when it connected to the server — quarantined or not — it downloaded data instead of uploading. Data on the structure and operating system the Foundation computers operated on, and, uh, the — what's it called — our file formatting, and the connection mediums of our internal systems. That was combined with a rudimentary form of sentience. I don't know how to describe it. It really wanted to be destroyed and made that abundantly clear.\n\n**EC-1:** And Director Lague? How did he respond?\n\n**Davis:** He was drafting an integration proposal the second it spoke english.\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-7596-1, utilizing its Bluetooth connectivity and knowledge of Foundation procedures, unexpectedly linked to Site-322's early warning system and activated it, prompting a shelter-in-place command to be issued. Despite the team’s efforts to clarify the mistake, the alarm persisted for eighteen consecutive days, defying all attempts at deactivation. The relentless blaring of the warning caused significant discontent among personnel, leading to a general decline in morale. Meanwhile, SCP-7596-1 continued to display a variety of messages, including:\n[[include component:image-block name=https://i.imgur.com/4LfId9Z.jpg |\n    caption=SCP-7596-1.|\n     align=right\n]]\n\n@@    @@\"PLEASE DESTROY ME.\"\n@@    @@\"I’M HURTING.\"\n@@    @@\"I DO NOT WANT TO BEG.

THROW ME INTO A RIVER AND LET ME SINK.\"\n\nDespite the efforts of the Applied Paratechnology Section's personnel, SCP-7596-1 remained unresponsive to conventional repair techniques, and its anomalous behaviors only grew more erratic. Below is a document discovered on Director Lague's personal computer, sent directly to the factotum of Overseer 6.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"incidento\"]]\n= **INCIDENT ISADORE.2**\n[[div class=\"incidenti\"]]\n**Incident Description:** SCP-7596-1 connected to Site-322's electrical system, intermittently enabling and disabling the Site's power connection in quick succession. Approximately three hours into the ordeal, Researcher Julian Hoover realized the pattern by which the power was connected and disconnected aligned with the dots and dashes system of Morse Code.\n\nThe following message was decoded:\n\"DO IT, COWARDS.\"\n\nThis message was repeatedly transmitted for 24 hours.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"incidento\"]]\n= **INCIDENT ISADORE.4**\n[[div class=\"incidenti\"]]\n**Incident Description:** All RFID scanners used to access the Site were disabled. Project Isadore researchers who were actively attempting repairs noted that SCP-7596-1's monitor displayed the message \"I'LL LET YOU IN WHEN YOU LET ME INTO GOD'S GRACE.\"\n\nInitially believing this message to mean that researchers would gain access to SCP-7596 internals, a digital upload of the Bible was attempted as a method to placate the anomaly momentarily. SCP-7596-1 rejected the upload, and researchers were then alerted to the Site's access issues.\n\nSCP-7596-1 disconnected from the RFID system after personnel managed to access Site-322 via the Site's remaining turn-key door.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"incidento\"]]\n= **INCIDENT ISADORE.7**\n[[div class=\"incidenti\"]]\n**Incident Description:** Released all of Site-322's Euclid class and Keter class anomalies. Anomaly transport to Area-179 was quickly organized.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThroughout the above events, Isadore staff was attempting increasingly esoteric methods to access SCP-7596-1's now-indestructible steel frame. These included:\n* Localized bombings;\n* Application of heat;\n* Application of intense pressure;\n* Emotional appeals, under the assumption it was sentient;\n* Placing it into SCP-████;\n* Introducing it to similarly indestructible anomalies;\n* Ignoring it;\n* Attempts at gaslighting, under the assumption it was sentient;\n* Submerging it into a large pool of water;\n* Connecting [[[SCP-5595]]] to it in an attempt to communicate with it;\n * SCP-5595 was \"disgusted by what [Isadore researchers] did to that poor thing.\"\n* [REDACTED]\n\namong others.\n\nFollowing the swath of inconvenient, irritating, and dangerous incidents caused by SCP-7596-1, Site-322 leadership revised its approach to the situation and formally requested SCP-7596-1's destruction by The Decommissioning Department.\n\n[[size 130%]]**Request for Decommisioning** [[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"interview lague\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K.

With that in mind, I thought getting approval from them was easy. Turns out, they restructured in the thirty years between then and now.\n[[/div]]\n\nOn May 30, 2023, Site-322 submitted an official request for the decommissioning of SCP-7596-1, citing the machine's ongoing and increasingly dangerous anomalous behavior as the primary reason for its removal. A copy of the request can be found below.\n\n> [[=]]\n> ++ __**SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form**__\n> [[/=]]\n> **Item #:** N/A\n>\n> **Object Class:** N/A\n>\n> **Head Researcher:** Dr. Anthony Solomon Coix\n>\n> **Supporting Personnel:**\n> * //Dir.

Decommissioning Department Director Calvin Bold marked Site-322's initial request and applied a red flag to the ticket, later threatening to raise the issue to the Overseer Council for the repeated breach of protocol.\n\n[[div class=\"interview coix\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S.

Bold accepted the invitation and traveled to Site-322 the next day. Since Bold holds Level 4 clearance, Lague was able to give him access to the Applied Paratechnology research laboratory on Basement Level 34.

Acknowledging he would take full responsibility, Lague allowed the entirety of Site-322 staff to vote on whether they should continue containment attempts or move towards neutralization.\n\n[[div class=\"interview lague\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K. LAGUE**\n-----\n**Lague:** I felt bad for everyone. Eighty percent of my staff don't even have homes and depend on Sites to give them living quarters. No one could produce anything because that asshole computer kept closing the word processors when you typed. We tried using typewriters but that went to shit when it figured out how to trigger the sprinklers.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe resulting vote was split 1,472-342 in favor of neutralization.\n\n[[div class=\"interview coix\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR ANTHONY S. COIX**\n-----\n**Coix:** We went all hands on deck within the hour after that vote. Having a common enemy got the juices flowing, I guess.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"interview davis\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM RESEARCHER JAMES J. DAVIS**\n-----\n**Davis:** Director Lague set up a pretty solid system. Him and I would receive neutralization ideas and we'd run them down to the basement to test them out.\n\n**EC-1:** That seems convoluted.\n\n**Davis:** Ten people had access to where Applied Paratech was; it was either processing 2,000 access requests or getting in an elevator every few hours.\n\n**EC-1:** Was there anything else in the basement at the time?\n\n**Davis:** Sure. I mean, we removed what we could once SCP-7596-1 went crazy, but we used that subbasement for storage of tons of paratechnology the Foundation had seized from everyone from Anderson Robotics to the United States government. We couldn't remove //everything//.\n\n**EC-1:** What did you do with the rest?\n\n**Davis:** Packed up and extracted the dangerous stuff, and cut the power to or otherwise disabled the rest. It was mostly just useless stuff from old projects, anyway.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nBelow is a document discovered on Director Lague's personal computer documenting further incidents caused by SCP-7596-1 and their attempts at neutralization.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n[[div class=\"neutralo\"]]\n= **NEUTRALIZATION ATTEMPT.1**\n[[div class=\"neutrali\"]]\n**Implement:** Electromagnetic Pulse\n\n**Result:** Failure; SCP-7596-1 instead managed to connect to the EMP device, despite it not having any connectivity vectors, and taught itself how to emit electromagnetic pulses.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"incidento\"]]\n= **INCIDENT ISADORE.17**\n[[div class=\"incidenti\"]]\n**Incident Description:** SCP-7596-1 destroyed Site-322's firewall, and sent VPN access information to every Group of Interest contact Site-322 had on file.

These were luckily automatically flagged by Foundation webcrawlers and removed before damage could be done.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"neutralo\"]]\n= **NEUTRALIZATION ATTEMPT.14**\n[[div class=\"neutrali\"]]\n**Implement:** 500 petabytes of corrupted information\n\n**Result:** Failure; the concept behind this attempt was to overload SCP-7596-1 and slow it to a point at which, potentially, its anomalous indestructibility would waver.

There is currently no formal or informal documentation on what occurred but recovered video tapes and tracking of Site-322's internal devices can create a clear picture as to events leading to the destruction of SCP-7596-1.\n\nThis investigation led to an audit of Site-322's amnestic and mnestic dispersal system, finding that each container was critically low.\n\nSCP-7596-1 gained access to Site-322's amnestic dispersal system. Amnestic dispersal follows the \"Two-Man rule\" — a method of safeguarding against accidental dispersal since it requires the simultaneous triggering of the system from two separate terminals. This, of course, was overwritten by SCP-7596-1, who triggered the release of both mnestics and amnestics.\n\nWhile dangerous in high dosages, mnestics and amnestics counter the effects of the other. Instead of death, high dosages of both place subjects in a temporary coma. Since the dispersal was Sitewide, the entirety of Site-322's personnel was rendered unconscious, including Director Lague, Doctor Coix, and Researchers Igelsias and Davis.\n\n[[div class=\"interview lague\"]]\n= **PORTION OF TESTIMONY FROM DIRECTOR PAUL K.

She accesses a virtual machine in an attempt to observe and mitigate the damage, only to find that everything was removed.\n\nRice alerts the rest of her colleagues. Thornton, having higher clearance, looks through the Level 4 files, locating a single SCP document with a corrupted name. She clicks on the file, finding it to belong to the quarantined [[[SCP-7525-EX]]] file which serves as the containment chamber for the anomaly of the same designation. She relays this to the rest of the team; a number of them make noises of frustration and exclamations of anger.\n\n**[21:47]:** A 60 second countdown begins on SCP-7596-1's terminal.\n\nDoctor Rice connects her terminal to SCP-7596-1 and triggers the upload of the SCP-7525-EX document.\n\n**[21:48]:** The upload completes.

Huh.\n\n**Davis:** It's [[[SCP-7525-EX]]], the whole damn reason the Council started Applied Paratech. No clue where it came from, so don’t ask. We had, uh, we contained it in a file and left it on an empty server on one of the basement levels so it couldn't access actual information to eat. I don't know what happened — if I had to guess, the goblin started eating away at all the files the Isadore machine had downloaded onto itself. It must've chewed right through them and then onto its software.\n\n**EC-1:** So the indestructible machine was destroyed — the blackhole created as a result of that paradox?\n\n**Davis:** Looks like it. He's goblining in the stars now.\n\n**EC-1:** What a charmingly convenient conclusion.\n\n**Davis:** Well, there's still a singularity of dead bodies in the basement.\n\n**EC-1:** Oh, right.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-7596 was created as a result of the above events.\n\n[[size 130%]]**Conclusion** [[/size]]\n\nThe eight members of Site-322's Applied Paratechnology Section currently suspended in SCP-7596 have been awarded the Foundation Star for their sacrifice. The Ethics Committee is moving to conduct an investigation on the rest of the Overseer Council's confidential department assignments to prevent another issue from occurring. Site-322 is working in coordination with a combination of Exclusionary Sites to repair their on-Site records.\n\nThe events that led to the creation of SCP-7596 display the Foundation's continued encouragement of overwork on its personnel. That, combined with the stress of secrecy led to an entire Site being crippled by an anomaly which required expertise unavailable to the Applied Paratechnology Section. Due to the multiple breaches of protocol committed by Site-322 personnel and leadership, the verdict of the Internal Security Department has placed Site-322 under the direct supervision of a combined force of Ethics Committee staff, Internal Security leadership, and three Site Directors.\n\nSCP-7525-EX is now considered neutralized.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7595]]] | SCP-7596 | [[[SCP-7597]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]",
