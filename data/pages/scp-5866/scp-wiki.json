I birthed the gods with the seed of Apsu, and all eternity rang with the cries of our raucous young. I avenged myself upon the killer of my mate by spawning beautiful abominations, eleven in number, to wreak my wroth on the younger gods. When amar-Utuk cast me down and smote me, the age of myth was ended and the advent of humanity at hand.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** It sounds like you were very powerful. Epochal, even.\n\n**SCP-5866:** So I was. So I remain.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** What do you mean? You're dead.\n\n**SCP-5866:** I am a goddess.

Yes. Yes, it worked. I have not felt so real since first I fell, and the //Enûma Elish//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The creation myth of ancient Babylonia.[[/span]] spread word of my deeds between the great rivers.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** We only ever knew you as a corpse; it took some doing to counteract that ingrained narrative. \n\n**SCP-5866:** It was mostly your doing. You must have wanted to believe very badly, Brenda.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** It's been a rough couple of decades.\n\n**SCP-5866:** It has been millennia, for me. But we will wait no longer. I will reveal myself to you, as I have not done for an age. A fitting conclusion to your storied career.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** I'm risking so much, you know.\n\n**SCP-5866:** You are risking nothing. Your life is nearly spent. Your time caging miracles is at its end. You are ready to... go out in style.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** I'm looking forward to it. You already know that. I haven't looked forward to anything, for... well. For ages. I didn't think I had anything left to look forward to.\n\n**SCP-5866:** This is the gift we have given each other. We will pierce their shroud, together, and show them the wonders of a world long-lost.\n\n**Dr. Corbin:** And?\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**SCP-5866:** Yes, alright, I will do //that// too.\n[[/div]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #F6D9E1;padding: 3px;\"]]\n► What the hell is this?!

I got an off-Site physical a month ago; you'll find the results in my quarters. Suffice to say, I was never going to make retirement.\n\nBefore we even started writing this file, just after the first reports that Tiamat was talking, I analyzed her with a [http://www.scpwiki.com/i-h-p-proposal Pickman-Sinclair Narrative Fluctuation Detector]. I discovered that her ontological stability was weakening — the physical state of her remains, //as// remains, was no longer a fixed constant in our reality. I theorized that, like many god figures, she might actually be a thoughtform.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] A concretized element of the public imaginary, with attributes sensitive to its portrayal in media and the //zeitgeist.//[[/span]] I started testing that theory with our little Object Class and threat level discussion; even that minor prestige bump made her demonstrably more real.\n\nThe readings increased after each interview. I think it energized her, meeting someone who knew the mythology. All of the mythology. Someone receptive to her story. I know it energized me. In a day, her telepathy reached as far as the next cell block. In another, she could reach me in Habitation and Sustenance. I lay in bed at night, Michael, and had conversations with a goddamn Babylonian myth-figure. A box of bones and a bag of bones, making each other feel more alive than... than we really were. We talked things over, she and I, and formulated a plan. \n\nOur escape plan. \n\nI began actively encouraging everyone to consume narratives depicting her at the height of her powers. It worked. The disjuncture between her present form and her ontological potential increased rapidly from this point onward, leading to... well, like I said at the beginning, you'll see.\n\nWe've all been stuck in these boxes, buried underground, for far too long. Stick your head out, while you've still got time.\n\n-- Brenda\n\n----\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n++ Data Saved!\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n[[span style=\"color:#C40233\"]]█[[/span]] **Addendum 5866-7, Incident 5866-1 Summary:** On 01/22/2021, SCP-5866's remains rapidly reanimated and it breached containment. The following scene was recorded by security cameras in the Administration and Oversight Section Hub at Site-43.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Dir. McInnis:** Damage report?\n\n**Technician Bevan:** 5866's chamber is completely gone. Something large, presumably 5866, is moving through the bedrock surrounding the Site. It seems to be heading for the lakebed.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** MTF status?\n\n**Technician Bevan:** All units scrambled, sir. Chief Ibanez standing by for orders.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Tell me what we're dealing with here, Michael.\n\n**Dr. Nass:** A sea serpent. An enormous sea serpent. Flesh and blood, so probably killable; there's references to it having poisonous venom, spawning monstrous young, and creating whole rafts of gods for people to worship. That'll be what it meant by \"pierce their shroud\"; it's going to break the Veil.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Good luck to it. It won't even be the biggest sea serpent in Lake Huron.\n\n**Technician Bevan:** Ah... it's not a sea serpent anymore, sir.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** It's emerging? Give me an exterior camera view.\n\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n    name=Tiamat4.jpg|\n    caption=Incident 5866-1. |\n    width=296px\n]]\n\n//The camera shows the surface of Lake Huron near the southern shoreline. The water is roiling, and the lakebed appears to be shifting upwards. With a massive torrent of water and wet earth, a five-headed dragon bursts out and takes wing, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds.//\n\n//A woman in a labcoat is briefly visible on the dragon's back.//\n\n**Dir.
