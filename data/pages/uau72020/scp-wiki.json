What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[donatello-s-sculpting-tools-circa-1409|Donatello's Sculpting Tools, Circa 1409]]] and the Medicea Accademia Dell'Arte Occulta\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[australian-rules|Australian Rules Drag Racing]]] and the Speed Demon series\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe first rule of witches: they're all bitches.\n\nThe //second// rule of witches: mix 'em with the [[[third-law-hub|Third Law]]] canon and they make for a [[[speed-demon-hub|killer tale series]]].\n\nSpeed Demon chronicles the exploits of Rookie, a veritable disaster of a woman who commits flagrant, drug-fueled acts of chaos as part of the two-person Chicago Specter. Originally a demonology nerd from a world without a veil, Rookie's college girlfriend introduces her to the wonderful world of unlicensed witchcraft. Of course, they proceed to have a nasty break-up that causes Rookie to flee to another universe, but ce la vie.\n\nThat's only the start, of course. What follows is a high-octane story of revenge, violence, and vehicular pursuits.\n\nFasten your seatbelts.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Two words: //car chase//.\n* **For artists:** See writing prompt.",
