[!-- Brief descriptions of anomaly --]\n\n**Stored:** Dome-01, Hall-03, Site-Red. Wild cases are under monthly observation. [!-- Where is the anomaly kept or located --]\n\n**Identifiers:** Anomaly, henceforth referred to as the plant, presents itself as a moderately sized Camellia Sinensis, its broad, glossy leaves of a rich green hue. The plant though familiar, possesses roots that protrude out of the ground at a distance of about two feet away from the plant. The plant does not bear any dissimilarities to Camellia Sinensis outside of this peculiarity. [!-- How does the anomaly usually look --]\n\n**Abnormality:** The plant exhibits a most unnatural and constant heat, the like of which cannot be accounted for by any known principles of natural science. The temperature surrounding its roots and leaves is of such intensity as to cause painful burns upon contact with the skin. The plant is reported by natives so as to have remedial properties when brewed into a tea that can heal even the worst of injuries, up to gaping cuts upon an individual. The plant's irregular heat permits itself to boil itself when introduced to water and requires no kindling of any sort.[!-- How does the anomaly usually behave and what makes this unusual --]\n\n**History:** The plant was discovered by Sir Frederick Hawke during a 1858 expedition to the Raj. Initially on a mission to gather samples of local plant life, Sir Frederick stumbled upon this plant. Its unusual characteristics became evident when, in an attempt to collect it, he suffered severe burns to his left hand when making contact. This incident prompted further investigation, leading to the plant's classification and subsequent observation. Discussion with the natives revealed that the plant is referred to as 'Aag Patta', or 'Ember Leaf'. The locals, aware of its dangerous heat, employ the use of cloth to handle the plant, using it to distribute the heat away from their skin. Despite the risks, they also described the plant’s remarkable healing properties, when brewed into a tea. Recognizing the potential value of the plant both for its medicinal properties and its unique characteristics, Sir Frederick secured a sample, which was carefully transported back to Britain.[!-- How did the anomaly come under the control of HMFSCP --]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 123 (A) :** Sir Frederick Hawke's Account. Dated May 5th, 1858.\n\nA report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on the culture and history of AO-123 according to local societies and its abnormal properties.\n-----\n\nIt was the fifth of May, and my crew and I had found ourselves amidst the dense jungles of the Raj, on a mission both perilous and of significant importance. My expedition had initially aimed to gather samples of ordinary plants, to determine the ecological necessities of the region, but fate had other plans. As we ventured deeper into the foliage, I stumbled upon a plant unlike any I had encountered before, the leaves were broad, the glossy green shining beneath the sun, reminiscent of Tea Plant. But it was the roots that caught my attention, stretching out about an arms length away from the plant, protruding from the soil in an unnatural manner. It was an anomaly. My curiosity overcame me, and I leaned closer to inspect the strange vegetation. I foolishly touched one of the roots. A searing pain shot through my hand as it was burned upon contact, and I withdrew it, cursing my oversight. The heat was unbearable, far more intense than any other source I have ever encountered. \n\nThe indigenous people of the area had long known of this plant, but they had given it a name I had never heard before, 'Aag Patta', or 'Ember Leaf' in the Queens English. According to them, the plant was lauded for its remarkable healing properties. They claimed that when brewed, its volatile heat would be transformed into a healing warmth that could close wounds, ease pain, and promote rapid recovery, even from the most grievous of injuries. The natives claimed the plant was a source of life, ridiculous to an English man such as myself, but intriguing nonetheless. Upon prodding them for further information they insisted they have seen it work in person.\n\nEager to learn more, I reluctantly arranged for a local healer to demonstrate the brewing process. With great care, the healer selected several leaves, placed them in a small pot of water, and set the pot upon a stone. The water, which had previously been at room temperature, began to boil almost instantly. The liquid within the pot quickly boiled over, rising without the need for any kindling or fire starting. Though hesitant at first, I could not resist the allure of the plant’s promise. I took the cup from the healer, still warm to the touch, and brought it to my lips. The first sip was like nothing I had ever tasted. It was soothing, not just physically but on my mind and soul as well. It alleviated all the stress and aches of this journey. As I prepared to leave the Raj and return to Britain, I ensured that I had gathered sufficient samples of the plant, though transporting it would prove to be a challenge. With the help of the natives, I devised a method of securing the plant, wrapping the roots and leaves in thick, heat-resistant cloth and carefully packing it for the journey. I assured the natives that we would respect the plant with all due reverence beforehand of course.\n\n[[>]]\n-  **Sir Frederick A.

Dated May 9th, 1859.\n\nA report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on behalf of the British Army 1st Esoteric Regiment.\n-----\nAt precisely ten hundred thirty four on the May the forth of this year, the 1st Esoteric Regiment of the British Army, under the command of Sir Frederick Hawke, embarked into the dense jungle of the royal colony of the Raj. The regiment had orders to secure the region in which a plant, labelled as AO-123 to Her Majesty's Foundation, was known to grow within. The thickness of the jungle prevented a large scale search for the plant and only half of the regiment's personnel were able to traverse the terrain. The trek lasted three days before the regiment encountered a local village that cultivated the plant. The regiment approached the chief of the village and Sir Frederick Hawke informed them of their purpose in the region and that the plant would hereby be seized in the name of the Queen.\n\nThe village chief refused to hand over control of the plant. The regiment offered a compensation in gold which was refused. Following that the regiment threatened the village chief with imprisonment if he continued to refuse the orders of the Queen. The village chief still refused to follow simple orders. In response, the regiment seized the chief, accusing him of treason for his refusal. The chief was bound and brought to the village square, where a cannon, that had been transported through the jungle with great effort, was prepared for the execution. The chief was tied to the front of the cannon and promptly executed, his death meant to serve as a lesson to the villagers. The village chief's execution sparked an immediate and intense backlash from the local population. The regiment was forced to retreat to the outskirts of the village nearby the farms that the plants were grown within. While preparations were made to fend off an assault by the native savages, the gunpowder used for the rifles and cannon lit ablaze, presumptuously from the intense heat originating from the nearby plants. What followed was a inferno the likes of which have never been seen, within seconds the entire field was engulfed in flames. Sir Frederick Hawke ordered the regiment to attempt to salvage as much of the plant as possible however that soon proved futile as the men were consumed by flame. What little samples were collected were severely burnt and deemed to be of no use to the crown and tossed away.\n\nAn estimated thirty percent of the regiment died in the fire, though attempts were made to control it, it quickly spread out into the surrounding wilderness, decimating everything in its path.  Attempts to halt the destruction were unsuccessful, and the fire's devastation remained beyond the control of the regiment for several days. In the wake of this disaster, the regiment was forced to abandon its mission, retreating to the outskirts of the jungle to regroup and recover. The fate of the plant remains unknown, however it is likely that all specimens were destroyed, as the fire devastated much of the surrounding area where it grew.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** hmfscp2.png\n> **Name:** hmfscp2\n> **Author:** [[*user olympic-error]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/anomaly-243-the-neamh-mairbh/HMFSCP2.png\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
