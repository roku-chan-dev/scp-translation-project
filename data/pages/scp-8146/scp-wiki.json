When found, content is to be summarily deleted when possible. When not possible, low-level Foundation antiperceptive cognitohazards are to be implanted within the relevant webpages to discourage web traffic.\n\nIn addition, a variant of Cover Story RTV-985 has been and will continue to be disseminated in relevant areas, insinuating that SCP-8146 is an elaborate act of online performance art using special effects, with all involved persons being especially committed to maintaining character. False interviews using Foundation personnel have been integrated into the cover story, as well as fabricated \"behind-the-scenes\" footage.\n\nEfforts to locate the origin of SCP-8146 are underway. SCP-8146 is currently believed to originate from an unknown location in/around Los Angeles county in California, United States. Any witnesses to public appearances of SCP-8146 entities are to be interviewed and subsequently amnesticized following standard procedure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8146 is the collective designation for the Twitch.tv channel \"BoldMissionOfInternetStreamingToHonorOurMaster\",[[footnote]]Frequently shortened to BMOISTHOM by fans of the channel, pronounced 'Be-Moist-Home'.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]It is currently unknown how the anomalies overrode the 25-character limit imposed on Twitch channel names.[[/footnote]] the entities upholding it, and any extant phenomenon resulting from such. The channel itself is largely non-anomalous, however all attempts at preventing and/or tracking uploads to the channel or blocking web traffic from reaching it have been met with failure. SCP-8146 follows an approximately-weekly upload schedule, with streams usually beginning Fridays at 5-8 PM PST and lasting for an average of 4 hours.\n\nSCP-8146's streams (and it is assumed the channel itself) are run by several humanoid entities of unknown origin, which are divided into four SCP-8146-1 instances and one SCP-8146-2 instance. The streams usually consist of the SCP-8146-1 entities collaboratively attempting to engage in activities similar to other popular streaming channels,[[footnote]]Notable examples include gaming, discussion, media viewing, cooking, musical performances, ritual combat and liveblogging.[[/footnote]] while being observed by SCP-8146-2.\n\nSCP-8146-1 are four identical humanoid entities dressed in simple black robes and bearing white masks with four openings, assumed to be for vision.[[footnote]]None of the entities have been seen without their robes and mask, and have on multiple occasions worn other clothes over their garments. It is speculated that the robes and mask are actually part of the creature's bodies, although this cannot currently be confirmed.[[/footnote]] Each instance stands approximately 1.3 meters tall. All SCP-8146-1 entities are excitable and appear to have little sense of individuality, as they insist upon collaborating with each other on almost all tasks regardless of how many persons the task at hand actually requires. The entities also display a near-universal level of general ineptitude and low intelligence. The instances converse in english, and refer to each other only as \"brother\" or \"brothers\".\n\nSCP-8146-2 is a 2 meter tall humanoid entity dressed in elaborate black robes with ornamental shoulderpads and long boots. Its head structure consists of several rows of intricate horn-like protrusions wrapping around a central glowing core, which is shielded from view by several veils. On occasions where the entity has removed its garments, it has shown a heavily-muscled humanoid body with pitch-black skin. SCP-8146-2 has demonstrated multiple potent anomalous abilities including advanced thaumaturgy, short-range telekinesis, extreme strength and endurance, gravity manipulation and selective immunity to the third law of Newtonian motion. It communicates via hand gestures and by emitting loud sonic shockwaves or \"bellows\" from its entire head structure. The entity demonstrates a primarily relaxed personality, normally sitting motionless on a couch or other seat to observe the SCP-8146-1 entities and only occasionally intervening. The SCP-8146-1 instances refer to SCP-8146-2 as \"Master\" or \"the Master\".\n\n**Archived Stream Logs:**\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Show Video Log 8146-V-S07\" hide=\"- Hide Log\"]]\n> = **Stream 8146-V-S07**\n> ----\n> **Original Stream Date:** Aug. 5th 2019, 4:30 PM PST\n> **Original Stream Title:** Earth-Delving and Assemblage of Goods for the Glory of the Master!\n> **Peak Viewers:** 188\n> ----\n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> //The stream begins showing the title menu of the popular video game Minecraft.

The entity does not appear aware of this. Another SCP-8146-1 instance is holding a sports water bottle and attempting to 'swim' through the air towards SCP-8146-2, which is remaining perfectly rigid in the air with its legs straight and arms crossed, facing downwards. The remaining SCP-8146-1 instances can be seen pinwheeling wildly through the air close by.// \n> \n> //After speaking for several seconds the instance holding the camera points towards one of the idle SCP-8146-1 instances, which waves as it unsuccessfully attempts to stop spinning.

The instance holding the book has remained in the fetal position with its eyes covered for 6 minutes. The cameraman points the camera downwards as the entities begin rapidly approaching the ground, where a large writhing pale-green mass can be seen.[[footnote]]Judging by the estimated altitude of the SCP-8146 entities, the mass would have needed to measure at least 226 meters across in order to be visible.[[/footnote]] Several seconds later, all five entities hit the ground and the camera feed cuts out. Frame-by-frame analysis reveals SCP-8146-2 throwing a downwards punch immediately before impact, striking the green mass.//\n> \n> [END LOG]\n> ----\n> **Note:** The landing site of the anomalies was successfully triangulated to ██████, Chile 2 hours after the stream concluded, and Foundation agents arrived after an additional 1 hour and 54 minutes.

The matter did not match any known species when tested, but did demonstrate slightly elevated levels of Akiva radiation, which dissipated over the course of 4 hours.

The thaumaturges stagger backwards, breaking their focus on the invocations. It then pulls Weng out of the van through the empty windshield space. Weng looks back towards Esckelson.//\n>> \n>> **Weng:** I'm—evacuate the civvies!\n>> \n>> //SCP-8146-2 dismounts the van, still holding Weng aloft in one hand.

What does that mean?\n> \n> //SCP-8146-2 waves a hand dismissively, and picks up its controller again. SCP-8146-K does the same. SCP-8146-1 instance 1-B moves around the backside of the couch and places another controller on top of the canned beverage in Weng's hand. It then quickly returns to its seat on the couch.//\n> \n> **urmometofglail:** yoooooooo we can do even teams now\n> \n> //SCP-8146-L hisses as its serpents look towards Weng.//\n> \n>> **Stantopotis:** [Through radio] You're doing great, Round got a perception filter up around the chariot and we've started amnesticizing.

Translation.\n>> \n>> //The eye of SCP-8146-K floats towards Agent Weng, leaving its position between the entity's pincers.

It's, like, my job.\n>> \n>> //A thin beam of light shines from the iris of the eye onto Agent Weng's forehead area for several seconds. Weng stiffens, and remains motionless for the duration. The eye ends the beam, and returns to its original position.

The revised containment procedures are as follows:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All SCP-8146 entities are to be contained in a shared secure habitation unit in Site-102, located in Southern California, United States. The entities have been permitted to furnish the unit with their belongings from their former apartment in Burbank, California, provided said belongings do not pose a risk towards the operations and other personnel of the site. SCP-8146-1 instances must at all times be accompanied by either SCP-8146-2 or Foundation personnel.\n\nWith aid from the Department of Informational Technologies, the SCP-8146 channel has been migrated to an isolated network accessible only by Foundation personnel. SCP-8146 is permitted to continue streaming within this network, but is forbidden from broadcasting material that poses a risk towards Foundation operations and personnel. Streams involving the usage of or travel to objects, entities and locations outside of Site-102 must be negotiated between SCP-8146-2, designated SCP-8146 liaison/translator Agent Weng, and the Site-102 Head of Containment. Negotiations must be undertaken at least one week prior to the actual date of the stream, and in the event the stream is permitted all SCP-8146 entities must be accompanied by undercover Foundation personnel carrying at least 20 doses of Class-A Amnestics.\n\nTo ensure compliance from SCP-8146 entities, Foundation personnel are encouraged to recreationally view SCP-8146 streams.\n \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n< [[[SCP-8145]]] | SCP-8146 | [[[SCP-8147]]] >\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** \n> **Author:**\n> **License:**\n> **Source Link:**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
