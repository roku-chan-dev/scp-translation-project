The entrance to the containment chamber consists of a BSL-4[[footnote]]BioSafety Level 4[[/footnote]] hermetically sealed airlock and biological decontamination chamber. Personnel are to inspect the containment chamber regularly for signs of damage or leaks in the airlock seals. SCP-6357 is not allowed direct contact with living organisms.\n\nStandard human meals are to be provided to SCP-6357 four times a day with nutrition supplements prescribed by an on-site nutritionist, however once a week a fresh large animal carcass is to be provided.\n\n@@ @@\n**Revised Containment Procedures -25/6/2019**\nSCP-6357 is currently uncontained and its exact location unknown.\n\nFoundation affiliates in the healthcare and biomedical fields are to propagate and later maintain the paradigm that advancements in medical science will lead to the increase of life and health spans, as well as immunity of humanity, in the future. A large-scale disinformation campaign will be carried out to reinforce mainstream awareness of this paradigm.\n\nField operatives are to investigate incidents of attacks on livestock and witness accounts of SCP-6357 to determine its location. These cases are to be attributed to other causes and footage is to be confiscated or declared as hoaxes, and amnestics provided to the witnesses.\n\nStandard biohazard procedures are to be used when dealing with SCP-6357-1A. Destruction of the material is advised.\n\nIf encountered, personnel are ordered to avoid all contact with SCP-6357 and report its location.\n\nThe Narendran test will be implemented in the blood test as part of Foundation mandatory pre-employment screening.\n\n**Description:**\nSCP-6357 is a shape-shifting entity consisting of cells similar to normal animal cells, with little to no presence of senescence[[footnote]]The condition or process of deterioration with age.[[/footnote]]; and enhanced regenerative properties. The entity is also immune to all known diseases.\n\nThese traits come at the cost of SCP-6357 needing a disproportionately high level of sustenance compared to the size of its form. SCP-6357 can obtain sustenance through the consumption of prepared food, but also has a tendency to hunt and scavenge when food is not available.\n\nSCP-6357 will deviate from its form to become a red mist-like mass to hunt or scavenge. In this form, SCP-6357 can pass through any barrier with openings or pores more than 1Î¼m in diameter.\n\nOnce the mass is in contact with the prey, it encompasses the body and strips organic tissue and nutrients from the host leaving behind only a husk of bone and hair. The entity has also been witnessed producing tendrils to aid in the feeding process. This can be done to multiple prey simultaneously. Once sated, SCP-6357 reverts to its original form.\n\n**Addendum 1: Discovery**\nThe Foundation had been alerted to anomalous activity in South Asia[[footnote]]The southern region of Asia, which is defined in both geographical and ethno-cultural terms. The region consists of the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka.[[/footnote]] through the Anomalous Signature Recognition Program (A.S.R.P) in 1995. Multiple livestock killings, as well as body-snatching[[footnote]]The secret removal of corpses from burial sites.[[/footnote]] incidents in burial grounds and mortuaries throughout the region, were reported. The skeletons and hair were the only remains recovered in all cases.\n\nWitnesses of incidents in rural areas have described a red mist similar to an insect swarm approaching the animals before disappearing from the scene after some time. Based on the widespread yet endemic nature of and the time frame between the cases, the entity appears to live a nomadic lifestyle.\n\nIn 2007, reports of anomalous activity in North Korea were brought to the Foundation's attention, providing significant insight into the origin and behavior of SCP-6357. These reports described a large canid creature, dubbed the Hellhound, attacking Korean People's Army troops in forest regions. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6360 MTF Eta-3 \"Night Phantoms\"] were deployed in response.\n\nWhile investigating these reports, Eta-3 narrowed down SCP-6357's location to the forests of North Hamgyong, before it evaded capture. At the scene of their last encounter with SCP-6357, a tattered dog collar was left behind and later identified as one used for Military Working Dogs of the K.P.A.\n\nLater, Eta-6 learned of an ongoing manhunt for two dog handlers who had supposedly deserted. Upon deliberation by MTF headquarters, Eta-3 was ordered to locate these deserters before the North Korean Government could.\n\nOn 6/2/2007, the two soldiers were located in a small village and taken into custody. The following is the interrogation of the men at a Foundation safe house:\n\n> **Interviewed:** [Detainee A and B, names withheld]\n> \n> **Interviewer:** [Agent Jeon]\n> \n> **Foreword:** [The soldiers were escorted to an MTF safehouse. The interview was conducted in Korean, translated for convenience]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n>   \n> **Detainee A:** I would like to say, thank you. May I ask whom do you work for?\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Doesn't matter. All you have to know is that we will provide you safe passage to South Korea, in exchange for information.\n> \n> **Detainee B:** How do we trust you?\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Well we could easily hand you over to the authorities, but we did not. You are a potential asset for us, so just answer these questions and we will help you seek asylum. Am I clear?\n> \n> //(Detainee B remains silent for a moment before nodding.)//\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Good! Do you know anything about the Hellhound?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** Of course! That monster has been killing our men like it's nothing. We make sure we're not in the forest every chance we get.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** When our team attacked the creature, it dropped this.\n> \n> (//Agent Jeon places an evidence bag with a torn dog collar in it on the table.//)\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Recognise this?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** //(Examines the collar then turns to Detainee A)// Dal?!â¦It.. no...It makes sense...he...\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** What makes sense?\n> \n> **Detainee A:** //(Silence, then turns to interviewer)// We were dog handlers, along with our colleague. Dal was the name of his dog. One day, Dal started acting weirdly, like he was mad. Lt. Kang, our colleague...he tried to control Dal. Thing is, the dog bit him and ran off. We tried to chase him but he disappeared into the forest.\n>   \n>**Detainee B:** He must have become the monster after that.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** When was this?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** Two...three months ago.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** How are you so sure that it became the Hellhound?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** Dal would never turn on his owner, and Kang... he got treatment and seemed fine. Then the three of us went on holiday. We stayed at an inn at Kaesong. That's where the problem started.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Problem?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** That night, we woke up to some groaning coming from the bathroom. We saw that he was not in his bed.\n> \n> **Detainee A:** I thought it was something to do with the dog bite, so we went to check on him. He sounded bad so we tried opening the door. It was locked, so we bashed it down. Then we saw him.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Continue.\n> \n> //(The two men exchanged looks and remained silent.)//\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** What happened in that bathroom?\n> \n> **Detainee A:** He...he was...\n> \n> **Detainee B:** He was very...wrong.\n>  \n> **Agent Jeon:** What do you mean by \"very wrong\"?\n> \n> **Detainee B:** I have seen sick people sir, but not that sick! He was contorted on the floor and had these bumps growing on his chest. And his face was....was...\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** You mean disfigured?\n> \n> **Detainee A:** No, Sir. It was not his face! It was like his face was being replaced by another face, growing from one side to the other.\n> \n> **Agent Jeon:** Then what happened?\n> \n> **Detainee A:** He saw us and jumped out the window. We looked out to see him scramble into the forest. After some time, we reported to our superiors.\n> \n> **Detainee B:** Now we are being hunted. That damn dog gave him something! And they know it!\n>  \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** [The two soldiers were administered Class C amnestics and arrangements were made to send them to Hanawon[[footnote]]The Settlement Support Center for North Korean Refugees, a South Korean facility for the re-education of North Korean defectors.[[/footnote]].]\n\nSuspecting an infectious agent was at play, the Foundation began to investigate further.\n\nThe Foundation would later receive a file from an anonymous source within the KPA. The file contained information detailing a bioweapons development program that took place at an underground research facility at 41.2780Â° N, 129.0874Â° E. Among the information was a log intercepted by Bureau 121[[footnote]]Bureau 121 is a North Korean cyberwarfare agency, part of the Reconnaissance General Bureau of North Korea's military.[[/footnote]] which was sent to an unidentified receiver. It is unknown how the informant came to know about the Foundation.\n\nThe events have been classified Incident 6357-1. The following has been translated from Korean.\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n\n| 0210200601:26Z\n| PRIORITY TRAFFIC\n| TO: jinji\n| FROM: qilin\n| RE: HELP\n\nI hope you receive this. Please read it and do something.\n\nMy name is Dr Cho Myong-Nok. I am a researcher at Punggye-ri Biological Research Site. For the past 6 months, we have been researching potential bioweaponry as well as ways to improve the effectiveness and survivability of our soldiers in combat.\n\nThe nexus of the experiments was a detainee sent here. We discovered his unprecedented regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to spread out into a swarm of what we found out, were his cells to strip organic matter in seconds. We thought we could use him as an asset. We were stupid.\n\nDuring one of the procedures, we attempted to extract cells from the subject. Suddenly he began behaving aggressively and assaulted one of the researchers. Previously we've been using toxin sprays to make him submissive in cases like this, to great effect. But that day...it did not work.\n\nIn a panic, one of the soldiers fired upon the subject, who attacked him. This made the others open fire causing it to swarm out.\n\nI watched that thing kill everyone in his testing chamber and simply move out the door. We tried to stop it.... believe me we did... but he was uncontrollable, he...he kept re-growing no matter what we did.  We were tricked! The toxins only made it angrier.\n\nWherever the swarm went, it reduced every living thing to bones.\n\nThe whole site has been locked down. It has been 2...maybe 3 days. Few survivors along with myself have locked ourselves in the South-West wing. I think we are the only ones left.\n\nWe are running on emergency power and rations are low. We are deep underground and the exit is on the other side so I don't think anyone is coming.\n\nI am so sorry for what we have done. I am sorry.\n\nIf this message gets intercepted...which it probably will...Comrade please, we need to destroy this thing.\n\nIf it escapes, this country and the world will be like those skeletons.\n\nForgive me.\n[[/div]]\n\n\nRealising the threat, government officials elected to destroy the research site with a nuclear device, providing a cover story claiming the detonation was a result of a nuclear weapons test.\n\nThe description of the bioweapon's effects coincided with the cases of livestock killings in South Asia and thus was concluded to be related.\n\nIt was also noted that the time of Lt. Kang's transformation coincided with the detonation of the bomb, suggesting that the entity had managed to take over the soldier's body, via its cells transmitted from Dal, upon its death; and that the Hellhound was a mutated Dal.\n\nThe Hellhound was later successfully terminated by Eta-3 on 12/6/2007. However, the entity, disguised as Lt. Kang, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-night-shift had escaped into South Korea] and had become untraceable by the time the MTF landed in North Korea.\n\n**Addendum 2: Capture**\nIn 2012, the entity was located in Bangalore, India when local police detained a suspicious man found roaming near a local burial ground. An Inspector recognised the man as a family friend whose body went missing in a case 30 years prior. After a fingerprint check was ordered and confirmed the Inspectorâs suspicions, a Foundation mole assigned to the station took notice and reported the incident.\n\nField agents disguised as Central Bureau of Investigation (C.B.I)[[footnote]]The premier investigating agency of India.[[/footnote]] officers were sent to the station to retrieve the entity.\n\nAll those with knowledge of the entity were amnesticised and evidence of its arrest was destroyed. The entity was cooperative while being detained.\n\nSCP-6357 was transferred to Area-12, taking the appearance of the deceased man: a South-Indian male in his mid-twenties, 1.83m in height. The SCP has been observed to be very curious and has a profound interest and understanding of biology.\n\nInteractions between personnel and the entity have generally been affable. However, it tends to become distressed when ignored.\n\nLevel 4 researcher, Dr. Harish Narendran was placed in charge of SCP-6357.\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+  INTERVIEW LOGS\" hide=\"- INTERVIEW LOGS\"]]\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-6357\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Narendran\n> \n> **Foreword:** [Interview was performed from outside of SCP-6357's living chamber with hermetically sealed bulletproof glass in between as a barrier.

I got them from the dead.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Do you keep all the identities you take?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Yes...Would you like to see an example?\n> \n> **Dr Narendran:** //(cocks head)// Sure.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** //(Appearance slowly alters into middle-aged man of Pashtun descent)// See.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Interesting!\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** I can do more. //(Proceeds to transform into a young woman approximately in her 20's of Nepalese descent)//\n> \n> **Dr Narendran:** //(Writes in notebook)//\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** You want more.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** I think that wou.... //(Sighs)// Fine.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Alright //(Turns into a striped hyena and growls)//\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** OH GOD! //(Falls off chair)//\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Don't be scared, it is I.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** //(Gets back on the chair)// I think that would be enough.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Alright. //(Turns back into a South Indian man)//\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** I want to clarify a few things.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Go ahead.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Most of your sightings have been occurring in South Asia. How did you end up in North Korea?\n>  \n> **SCP-6357:** Well doctor, as a human I work in jobs that allow me to travel across the subcontinent. I prefer not to stay in one place. One of those jobs was at a shipping firm in India at the time.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Continue.\n>  \n> **SCP-6357:** One of our trips was to South Korea. It was supposed to be only a three-week trip and I had prepared adequately. Besides, I had travelled across water before, so why not? //(Sigh)//\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Let me guessâ¦\n>  \n> **SCP-6357:** //(Chuckles)// Yeahâ¦on the way back, a storm hit and we lost our bearings. The ship turned straight in North Korean waters. We only knew when suddenly we were being bombarded with shells. All I remember from then is being blown off the ship, then waking upâ¦. more accurately woken up by soldiers on the beach.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** What happened after that?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Well, I was detained along with a few other survivors and sent to a detention camp. There, they interrogated me. I did not understand anything they said but they really didn't like me. Then they realised I was different, presumably because I did not stay a bloody pulp, and the next thing I knew, I was being sent to some underground lab. Something like this place, actually. The rest I presume you already know.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Yes, we know about the incident at the research facility, but talking to you now, I would not have expected you to do it if I did not have prior knowledge.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** I'll take that as a compliment. It is mostly thanks to you....your higher level of prudence.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Hmmm..what do you mean?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** You did your homework and learned about my hunger, therefore you provided me an adequate amount of food. Those fools didn't. Again something like this place, only less competent, but I digress. I became more and more agitated, and the fact I did not like the things being done to me did not help. Then one day the situation escalated and I hit one of them. Then they began firing at me and the rest is history.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** What were the things they did to incur such a response?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Well doctor, I heal quickly, but that does not mean I do not feel pain!\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Alright, but did you feel any guilt?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Slightly. //(ponders)// We initially did it purely out of hunger //(pauses)// but it soon became self defence. When I left the chamber the first thing they did was shoot at me and spray toxins on me. I know that would be an absolutely natural reaction to a \"monster\", but in hindsight, they were only making it worse. You see, they wanted to use me to cause harm, and did not really have my best interests in mind. I did what I thought was best at the time.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** I see. May we go to the next question?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Sure.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Could you clear up how you infected the soldier? The one you took over after the blast.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** //(Eyes widen)// Infected? How did you know it was an infection?\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Well with the information we obtained, it was the most logical answer. The dog bit the man. His condition in the inn coincided with the nuclear blast. We... or more so I theorised that based on your description as a swarm of cells, you managed to infect the dog which transferred the cells to the man. Then upon your //(quote-unquote)// \"death\", your cells somehow took over the man, thus reviving you.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** //(Chuckles)// Wow! I see why you are quite the big shot here!\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Thank you, but one question. How did you get the dog?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Come on doctor, it's simple. Before sending me to the facility, I was kept at a dreary-old detention camp. Think. What could have happened?\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** //(Ponders for a while)// You infected something there.....A rat, probably?\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Correct.\n> \n> **Dr. Narendran:** Then the rat left and got eaten by the dog.\n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Exactly! Rat gets eaten by dog. Dog bites man. Man becomes host. I am now the man.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** [Learned that if SCP-6357 sustains severe injury, it starts producing cells rapidly to heal. This results in the entity requiring a lot of energy soon after, which it mitigates by consuming large amounts of food or, in the case of Incident 6357-1, assimilating any creature in its vicinity. SCP-6357 is most volatile in this state, therefore food must be provided to avoid loss of life.]\n\n@@ @@\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-6357\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Narendran\n> \n> \n> **<Begin Log: 2/6/2012>**\n> \n> \n> **SCP-6357:** Good morning doctor.

According to what has been researched, the entity cannot take over a host unless it is destroyed. Therefore, non-lethal containment will still be pursued.\n\nResearch into methods of containment along with ways to identify SCP-6357-1B is of utmost priority.\n\nCurrently, Researcher Dr. Harish Narendran and his family are to be kept in Foundation custody and monitored.\n\nSince the entity has possibly compromised our human manpower, we have authorised the mass production and further development of the Research Assistance Androids (RAAND) project using already available plans and prototypes from Prometheus Labs.\n\nIn an effort to further reduce the risk of biological compromise, a neural scan of Dr. Narendran is to be integrated with the RAAND Artificial Intelligence. Using Narendran's memories, knowledge, and experience with the entity, the AI will be tasked with research into an effective means of recapture and containment. RAANDs along with regular robots will carry out the required experiments and testing deemed too risky for flesh-based personnel.\n\nIn addition, the creation of a Mobile Task Force consisting of a more tactical variant of these androids is underway.

Some SCP-6357-1A become neurons to access their hostâs memories and receive input from the hostâs sensory organs. This information is relayed telepathically to SCP-6357, effectively making SCP-6357-1B a biological surveillance device.||\n||  **\"ACTIVE\"**   || SCP-6357-1Aâs replication rate increases and they fully infect the brain, taking full control of the host.

At the age of 106, Raji Narendran suffered a high-voltage electric shock after stepping on an exposed live power line. Despite surviving what should have been a fatal injury with only total paralysis of her right leg, Raji suddenly began suffering a rapid onset of senescence over the next 6 months, at which point she succumbed to the common flu.\n\nIt hypothesised that if she was a host as the entity proclaimed, the electricity killed the SCP-6357-1A in her body, causing her to lose her anomalous immunity. Therefore, a less powerful shock could incapacitate the entity to make containment easier.\n\nSubsequent testing revealed that a current of 2mA causes SCP-6357-1A to act erratically and prevents them from forming, therefore rendering them unable to swarm. It was also discovered that passing the current through an infected blood sample would cause the anomalous cells to noticeably vibrate thus identifying SCP-6357-1B.\n\nThe test has been named the Narendran Test in honour of its inventor, and sweeping tests will be carried across all Foundation facilities.\n\n**Addendum 7.1: 16/6/2018**\nThe first successful batch of tactical androids, named Tactical Operative Androids (TOA),  for Tau-15 has been produced.

Tau-15 approaches the farmhouse. Outside the structure is a goat pen where a wake of vultures are feeding on a goat carcass, which are promptly chased away. The team enters and finds SCP-6357 calmly sitting at a dining table. The team surrounds the entity whilst aiming their CHAACs.//\n\n**SCP-6357:** Hello there. I must say you are very persistent.\n\n**T-15-1:** SCP-6357 you are to be taken back into Foundation custody. We possess weapons capable of your incapacitation. Compliance is advised.\n\n**SCP-6357:** Well I already saw that. May I ask for your name?\n\n**T-15-1:** SCP-6357, you are to be de-\n\n**SCP-6357:** Your name. Sir.\n\n**T-15-1:** T-15-1. Pl-\n\n**SCP-6357:** Do they also only refer to you by a barcode number, buddy?\n\n**T-15-1:** //(Pauses)//T-15-1. Alias \"Harold\". Now slowly stand up and refrain from making any sudden movements. Any attempt to escape will result in force being used.\n\n//SCP-6357 slowly stands up//\n\n**SCP-6357:** I understand, Harold. However, I would like to do something. (//Reacts to Agents preparing to fire//) Now!...now...hear me out first! Cool! Cool!\n\n//Personnel keep their weapons trained on the entity.//\n\n**T-15-1:** SCP-6357 we have been authorised to capture you. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n**SCP-6357:** So... you would rather get me, a relatively affable being, than a bunch of terrorists with bioweapons?\n\n**T-15-1:** Are you referring to the Chaos Insurgents?\n\n**SCP-6357:** Yes...I killed those soldiers outside the facility, but the disease samples were transported by another team. Thanks to me, I know where your quarry is. With that, I want to make a bargain.\n\n**T-15-1:** Command, the SCP appears to have important information. Advise.\n\n//HQ gives T-15-1 the order to let the entity lay out the terms.//\n\n**T-15-1:** Affirmative. Proceed.\n\n**SCP-6357:** Let me go. Let me be free like before, and I will bring no harm to you. In exchange, I will give you the location of the samples. Also, do not punish Dr. Narendran. There is no point in doing so. You are just like him.\n\n//SCP-6357 stares directly at T-15-1//\n\n**SCP-6357:** You all are.\n\n**T-15-1:** How can we confirm the validity of your proposal?\n\n**SCP-6357:** If you think about it, you have the high ground here when it comes to me. Whether I tell the truth or lie, you can still eventually catch me...although the latter will make you more inclined to shock me. But Chaos Insurgency, however, are dangerous fellows! You and I would not want these diseases to be used as weapons, would we?\n\n//Pauses while looking around//\n\n**SCP-6357:** Also, I know the location now but the more time goes by the weapons might change hands, then even I might not be able to find them. So, let's make this deal quick, would you kindly?\n\n//T-15-1 reports the terms to the HQ. Desperate to secure the samples, the order was given. T-15-1 looks at the entity.//\n\n**T-15-1:** Deal accepted.\n\n**SCP-6357:** Excellent!\n\n//SCP-6357 sits back down and writes something on a nearby piece of paper. Seemingly finished, it hands over the paper to T-15-1. However just as he is about to take the letter, the entity redraws its hand, looking at T-15-1.//\n\n**SCP-6357:** This is more important than me. I am merely an animal, no different from those vultures.\n\n//SCP-6357 provides the paper to T-15-1. The paper contains GPS coordinates and an address, along with other intel regarding the site.//\n\n//T-15-1 relays the information which is then confirmed to be the location of a large compound. Satellite imagery identified multiple armed men with the C.I logo patrolling the area.//\n\n//Satisfied with this, HQ orders the entity to be captured as quickly as possible.//\n\n**T-15-1:** Affirmative. Thank you, SCP-6357. However, our mission is still to capture you. Please do not resist.\n\n**SCP-6357:** //Stares at T-15-1 and sighs// You know, I expected something like this to occur. //Pauses before snorting// Farewell then.\n\n//SCP-6357 sits still. Suddenly, it begins heavily bleeding and twitching.//\n\n**T-15-1:** Move back. Now.\n\n//Within several seconds the entity disintegrates completely, leaving only its clothes behind.//\n\n**T-15-1:** //Speaks into radio//. Target is gone. I repeat. SCP-6357 has disappeared.\n\n//Sometime later, the MTFs receive a report of an elderly man in a nearby village absconding into the forest after locking himself in his room and not responding to his family.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nIt has been confirmed that SCP-6357 can initiate an advanced form of apoptosis in order to manually start the **âREVIVALâ** process, making containment exceedingly difficult.\n\nThe following is a quote from Researcher Narendran after learning of the incident during a meeting with the O-5:\n\n [//\"We underestimated him. The more we try to contain him, the more and more people we will inadvertently kill! Leave it, Sir. He won, and he made sure we can't play the game again.\"//]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Addendum 10:**\n A raid was carried out and the compound was secured, where the stolen samples were discovered and retrieved.\n\nResearcher Dr. Harish Narendran has been reinstated back to Class B.\n\n**Addendum 11:**\nBody snatching incidents in urban areas with the hallmarks of SCP-6357 have ceased.\n\nAll RAANDs are to be integrated into other Foundation research projects.\n\nMTF Tau-15 will be utilised to carry out missions involving direct contact with anomalies that can compromise organic matter.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+EXECUTIVE ORDER\" hide=\"- CLOSE\"]]\n**Addendum 12:**\nEstimates show that SCP-6357-1A will be present in every flesh-based organism by 2040.
