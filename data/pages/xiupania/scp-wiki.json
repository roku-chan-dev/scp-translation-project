Jason Graham is the capitol. Xiu Pan is the largest city. \n\n     Xiu Pan and all other states of Xiupania are derivative states of ##purple|**Jason Graham**##, each in essence identical to the capitol Jason Graham. Roughly 60 derivative Xiupanian states are known to exist across 60 different hosts. Xiupanian states are 1,212 mi² in area and adhere to a continuum, looping into themselves. The geography of a Xiupanian state consists of a floating, temperate archipelago. Day and night cycles are largely erratic, and depend on government discretion. There is no light source in the Xiupania, but a ##purple|**terran**## approximation of a starlit sky that increases in brightness depending on time of day. This archipelago floats and rests over and under 35m of void space.\n\n     Xiupania is a ##purple|**concrete low fantasy**##.  An individual’s powers within Xiupania are semi-mundane. The modifying of one's physical appearance, object creation, and mobility are inhibited. Corporeal entities require government authorization to wake, and are often treated as indentured servants or second-class citizens.\n\n     Xiupania maintains low literacy, life expectancy, education levels and is one of the least visited nations. The origin state of Qi Shao is grounded in a mentally unstable host and as such causes new Xiupanian hosts to experience similar problems. ##purple|**Nightmares**## and ##purple|**Terrors**## frequently plague Xiupania, and in some extreme cases Xiupanian states have caused the death of their hosts due to infighting and violence occurring during parasomnic events. Difficulties in the capitol are irritated even further due to the fact that the nation’s host is aware of its presence, and frequently attempts to conquer the region during lucid dreams.\n\n     Emperor Qi Shao, while corporeal, was suffering from brain cancer, and during the end of her life was researching the Oneiroi joining technique. Although denied by Qi Shao, the act of inhabiting Jason Graham is considered an act of desperation. Not much else is known about Qi Shao, as shortly after initial contact with Oneiroi West, access to Xiupania was restricted. Oneiroi-West beings attempting to access Xiupania are met with lethal force. While capital punishment is illegal in Xiupania, corporeal criminals and invalids are often deported without properly separating from their hosts, causing their host subconscious to emulate Xiupanian states and thus propagating their spread.\n [[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div float: right; border: none; width: 150px; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n\n[[span style=\"margin-top: 10px; color: #black; background-color: white; border: grey; width: 2px; padding: 0px 5px;\" text-allign: center;]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:center; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\n[[/span]]\n\n[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n^^**All Being’s Collective of Xiupania**^^\n\n^^**Capitol**^^\nJason Graham\n\n^^**Largest City**^^\nXiu Pan\n\n^^**Official Languages**^^\nOpening\nEnglish\nChinese\n\n^^**Ethnic Groups (2014):**^^\n48.4% Noncon\n32.7% Free Consciousness\n14.6% Corporeal\n4.3% Transitory\n\n^^**Demonym:**^^\nXiupanians\n\n^^**Government:**^^\nMonarchy\nGrand Emperor Qi Shao\n\n^^**Time Economy:**^^\n1 Solar Year = 2000 Xiupanian years\n\n^^**Reality:**^^\nLow Fantasy\n\n^^**Psychology:**^^\nPsychotic\n\n ^^**Privilege Status:**^^\nSemi-Mundane\n\n^^**Immigration Status:**^^\nClosed\n\n^^**Emmigration Status:**^^\nClosed\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:left; weight: semibold; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; color: black; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\nLast Edited 1:22PM OWST by Jessica Thompson\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; color: purple; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\n[VIEW EDITS] [**HISTORY**] [**COMMENTS**] \n[[/span]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n------\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(/local--files/experimental-2-no-tocar/archivelogobackground.png) center top no-repeat ; float: left; width: 400px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n^^Excerpt from “One Thousand Years in Xiupania”. Author Unknown, 2016^^\n\n   I have taken tea with the Grand Emperor Qi Shao, and she is truly a sight to behold; massive golden wings the size of a small cottage, rows upon rows of curved teeth, and black pitted eyes in which rest the tiny diamonds that are her pupils. Her tendrils lazily flop about the table during my interview with her, and she seems disinterested while she recounts the history of Xiupania.\n\n//Yes, my kingdom is small by the standards of the Oneiroi, as I have but only 60 hosts. This is a small network, not like the sprawling, globe-spanning nodes of the Oneiroi Collective, or the incoherent brooks and streams that are Oneiroi West. No, I have but very little territory, but within my territory is a population rivaling all of oneiroikind,//\n\nHer remarks are bold, but empty. She recounts the atrocities that take place in her nation while the silvery white needle of her tongue descends to siphon her tea.\n\n//Just yesterday, I may have created five additional states. I found corporeals wandering around the marble terraces of the southern archipelago - relayed to me by one of my subjects. They were doing a bit of sightseeing. My kingdom -Jason- is very handsome, you see. I was not warned of this ‘tourism’, nor do I allow it, so, I went to them.//\n\nThe many rows of Qi Shao’s teeth began to rotate in spirals - from her lips to deep within her throat - as she describes their punishment to me.\n\n//It is only a dream. I cannot be bothered with this. What real crime am I committing on corporeals? People wake up, and they live their lives. So what if they’re part of my network? People do not want their subconscious - their shadows. People do not want to accept who they truly are.// \n\n//...But I know what you are going to ask me: What about beings without bodies to return to? Am I not killing them? Surely, I am ending their lives? Of course.//\n\n,,This page is copyright Oneiroi-West department of Tourism, 2016,,\n [[/div]]\n\n[[div float: right; border: none; width: 150px; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 5px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n\n[[span style=\"margin-top: 10px; color: #black; background-color: white; border: grey; width: 2px; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;\" text-allign: center;]]\n\n[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n> **One Thousand Years\n>  in Xiupania**\n> ,,Buy it now!,,\n> \n> “I was stranded for **one thousand years** in Xiupania.

Xiupanian drones are seen cutting into the abstract multitude, all the while piercing through the retreating stare of OW.\n\n##gray|5 hour(s) ago##\nAbstract is \"unknowable\". Speculations that it is the Oneiroi Collective. An intrusion of OC into OW or XP territories would be unprecedented.\n\n##gray|4 hour(s) ago##\nXiupanians do not seem to be retreating. The majority of OW save for ethologics have vacated the area.  Xiupanian death counts are estimated to be in the thousands, but few have died.\n\n##gray|4 hour(s) ago##\n> This is why we can't //really// fight Xiupania. There is no imagination in Xiupania, they're drones. They can fight the abstracts because they do not even recognize it as such. We see the Collective and we lose our minds. They don't have \"eyes\".\n##gray|,,/o/pestilence,,##\n\n##gray|4 hour(s) ago##\nThe abstract continues to flood in. An exploratory mission is underway to learn where the abstract is coming from for the postmortem. A group of unidentified corporeal Shadows are seen retreating on the opposite end of the abstract floodmouth.\n\n##gray|3 hour(s) ago##\nBilly Burns went to sleep next to someone we're not aware of. A structuralist has gathered that the encounter took place in a motel and was purely sexual in nature. The unknown partner was a carrier, not knowledgeable of Oneiroi. Although he didn't use protection, he didn't contract any STIs. Sadly, this will matter little after the battle is over as the region will be surely uninhabitable by anything but Xiupanians.\n\n##gray|2 hour(s) ago##\nBilly Burn's Shadow, Gumdrop Sunshine, is unavailable for interview.\n\n##gray|2 hour(s) ago##\nAbstract is no longer flooding in. Possible there is none left, or the invading host has left relay proximity. Abstract begins to take shape as the Xiupanians cut down the remainder.\n\n##gray|2 hour(s) ago##\nAbstract confirmed to be Oneiroi Collective - //Singular// Oneiroi entities begin to take shape as they separate from the abstract:\n\n> There are human forms and concepts, but mostly confused human shapes. They're appearing as they're split in two by the XP reapers. I cannot calibrate with them... I can, but it is disgusting, painful. These are tortured people, to join with them would be to infect my mind.\n\n> Some of them fight: One-Thousand Skulls appeared suddenly from its abstract shell. The Xiupanians... Maybe they do not know fear.\n\n> The eyes of the reborn construct flooded with white, and a black mist reached out over the shattered void above. When it hit the Xiupanians, they shrank into nothing.\n##gray|,,/o/bruisedelbow,,##\n\n##gray|2 hour(s) ago##\nMassive belts of dead Xiupanians form an orbit around One-Thousand Skulls. Xiupanian drones continue to assault the entity.\n\nAn empath relays the following:\n\n> Many sisters make their sacrifice for me. Their corpses gently caress my carapace as I move toward the towering victim. It is one-thousand miles tall, one-thousand Oneiroi strong, and their skulls all cry out for death as I draw near to them. They vomit their black smoke and sing in warped voices as sisters to my left and right shrink. \n> \n> The sky is full of dying sisters, and their gray blood. All of the blue and green is gone now - the void is all white. This provides me functional, clear contrast. I hurdle into the mouth of a crying skull, my four arms and their four nails slice the target in a toppled cross. My mission is complete, this skull is done protesting. Satisfied, I die quietly with my prey, and my sisters follow behind me.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n\n\n##purple|You'll be awake soon, corporeal.
