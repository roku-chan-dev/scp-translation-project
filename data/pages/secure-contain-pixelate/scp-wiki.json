Therefore, it is speculated that the subjects themselves are not directly affected, but carry a memetic anomaly (refer to document [REDACTED]). It was there. Affected subjects do not act in a suspicious manner, making it difficult to judge whether or not the subject is under the influence of the anomaly after passing through the first stage of exposure.
