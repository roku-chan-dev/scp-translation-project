And for centuries, mankind's greatest philosophers have struggled to determine its nature. The legends of Terra Australis claim that the Great Whale Selachian that defines our reality was unjustly slain, trapping us in a broken world. Bathyeologians of the Boatswains of the Cog of God assert that this reality is a proving ground, meant to separate the righteous from the impure through glorious tribulation. And the Sharkics of the Global Ocean claim that there is no mistake; that this world is one where the strong rule -- as they deserve.\n\nOnly recently have the Centre's Patafisticians found the true origin of our reality. We have always assumed that the presence of various \"SCP\" organizations throughout the local multiverse were part of a natural multiversal variation.

The major differences concern the Global Ocean. In the Sharkest Timeline, the Global Ocean is the birthplace of the Abyssal Sharkicist civilization. Most of the seafloor is mapped, and developed settlements are spread across underwater regions. Because of Sharkic policies, the effects of anthropogenic climate change are much less pronounced, and the oceans have more biodiversity.\n\nRemember that the nation-state is a concept that arose from modernity, and whose interpretation is contingent on a long genealogy of sociohistorical developments. We should not expect the understandings of persons and groups in the Sharkest Timeline to map 1:1 onto our own modern understandings, and vice versa.\n\nThis is true also of the current global order inherent to the Sharkest Timeline. It is largely dependent on Abyssal Sharkicist hegemony, which controls 70% of the Earth's surface and singularly governs the international oceans. But it is also, to a lesser extent, shaped by their agreements with the Global Organization of Countries, who collectively govern most of the international lands. It is an order shaped by the realities of an oceanic imperialism, and the different tendencies inherent to different generations of Sharkicist elites, who have had great influence on how today's territories were conceived.\n\nNevertheless, these are the countries and territories of the Sharkest Timeline. Most of these map onto modern countries (where noted) whereas others do not.

Many Abyssal Sharkicists incorporate biology from other marine life, such as octopi, anglerfish, and other terrors of the deep.\n\nWhile Abyssal Sharkicists as a whole possess a shared goal, Sharkic substates have formed over the course of the centuries.\n\nKnown CYAN ABYSS substates and their locations are as follows:\n\n* Atlantos, North Atlantic Ocean\n* Sargassomari, Sargasso Sea (Atlantic Ocean)\n* Time Kingdom of Lemuria, Indian Ocean\n* Varuna State, Indian Ocean\n* Great Realm of Mu, Northeast Pacific Ocean\n* Confederation of Adytum's Lakes, Lakes of Central Asia\n* Salmonari Kingdoms of Pannonia, Eastern Europe\n\n= **__The Marianas Treaty__**\n\nThe Marianas Treaty of 1968 was established at the end of the Second Benthic War, and dictates the terms of interaction between Abyssal Sharkic societies and terrestrial societies. Roughly 95% of all terrestrial nation-states and an unquantified majority of Sharkic states are signatories as well. The Centre is not a signatory of the treaty and as such does not need to adhere to its points; however, several other NGOs with a significant oceanic presence accepted the terms.\n\nThe most significant points of the treaty are as follows.\n\n* A ban on baseline human military and scientific use of deep-ocean waters, defined as 100 km beyond the end of the continental shelf, unless previously approved by the CYAN ABYSS government of the relevant area. Recreational expeditions are exempted.\n* A cessation of CYAN ABYSS attacks and abductions from signatory terrestrial states. Vessels in deep-ocean waters are not protected.\n * License for Navigations Unseen (NU) inspectors to enter Sharkic waters to ensure adherence to the above.\n* A CYAN ABYSS representative at any organization with an oceanic presence, possessing full voting rights and veto power over any action involving naval deployment.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Liberated Cetacean Union\n----\nSee [[[SPC-1258]]]. Basically, they're dolphin and whale people. Many of them have joined the Centre as full-on agents, as seen in [[[SPC-507]]] and [[[SPC-179]]].\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Marshall, Carter, and Shark Ltd\n----\nMarshall, Carter, and Dark, but since this is the Centreverse, Mr. Dark is an evil shark from beyond nature instead of being an evil humanoid from beyond nature. They don't show up a lot, but it's fairly consistent that Mr. Shark was overthrown in a coup that was //totally// not backed by the Centre. The company is currently trying to rebrand as \"Marshall and Carter Ltd.\"\n\nWhereabouts of Mr. Shark are unknown.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Boatswains of the Cog of God (BotCoG)\n----\nA widespread and orthodox religion. Boatswains believe that the Planet Earth is a ship (specifically a Cog) sailing on a celestial ocean (some more literally than others), and that God (the captain) has chosen them as the petty officers entrusted with keeping good order among His crew (humanity).\n\nAccording to Boatswain bathyeology, when the long ages are inscribed onto the tapestry of history, God dots them with hardships designed to test the resolve of His crew. As morale and camaraderie become exhausted amongst the crew, it is then that God orders His commanders (prohpets) onto the naval theatre (the world) to inspire confidence. Though these commanders are but Men, the might of God flows through them.\n\n* The first commander, Moshe the manta ray shepherd, could move boats with the stretch of his hand. It is said that he parted the seas by ramming a gigantic ship through the waters. His faithful lead the Mosaic Way.\n\n* The second commander, Yeshua the fisher, had a miraculous catch rate. He flooded the seafood market with his catch; for this, the Seven Seas Empire ordered his hooxicution.[[footnote]]**Hooxicution:** Execution by being strung up with line and fishhooks and fastened to an anchor that is then moored at sea.[[/footnote]] It is said that he punched clean through the Devil's bathysphere and returned three days later from the bottom of the ocean. His faithful lead the Messianic Way.\n\n* The third commander, Mahomet the entrepreneur, knew the gift of gab. He divined God's revelations as they carried on the trade winds, learned of them, and directed them towards worldly matters. It is said that he brought stability to the tides: first, the social fabric of the masses; and then, the very movement of the ocean currents. His faithful lead the Qur'ānic Way.\n\nThese Faithful are united in their devotion to keeping watch over the Cog, in many confraternities and consororities across the world. Adherents of the three denominations each carry the duty of First Watch as it vacillates to a new sect every four years, on Feburary 30th (leap day).\n\nBut what could be said of the Arc of the Boatswains, the city-sized mothercraft that crests the Global Ocean?\n\n= **__The Johnson Heresy__**\n\nThe Johnson Heresy, or the Johnsonists, are an American heresy based in the state of Deseret. They believe that God's true name is YAT, and that he is akin to the admiral of a fleet. Those who have lived virtuous lives of service are rewarded with great wealth, a doctrine known as the \"Commission Gospel\". High-ranking members of the Johnsonists are known for their elaborate luxury recreational craft.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Great American Watchmen\n----\nAn association of individuals dedicated to the preservation of American fine arts and cultural purity, the GAW encounters an abnormally high amount of Deviant art. Founded as a secret society in the early days of the UAS and dissolving and reforming countless times since, the GAW's current headquarters are in California. The Centre believes that some members of the GAW produce Deviant art as a form of appreciation of American culture and history.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Navigations Unseen (NU)\n----\nThe esoteric arm of the Global Organization of Countries, the Navigations Unseen's mission is to use and understand Deviant phenomena for the betterment of humanity. Founded during the First Benthic War, the NU was crucial in preventing the extinction of baseline humanity at the hands of the Sharkic Empires. Under the stipulations of the Marianas Treaty, the NU is one of the few organizations with the power to conduct expeditions in deep-sea locations without unilateral approval from the GOC.\n\nWhile not opposed to the Centre's mission, the NU does not consider SPC-001 a major priority and is primarily oriented around the preservation and improvement of human lives. As a naval and scientific enterprise under the auspices of the GOC, the NU's view on Selachian threats is fundamentally one of documentation.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Poseidon Laboratories\n----\nA Deviant technology conglomerate, Poseidon Laboratories is involved in Deviant technology trade worldwide since the 1900s. Many Centre researchers have approached Poseidon Laboratories to produce Deviant technology devices that the Centre refuses to fund, essentially becoming the unofficial R&D branch of the Centre.\n\nAlthough Poseidon Laboratories was proposed to be merged with the Centre, all such propositions were denied. This was believed to ensure the status quo, and to prevent the loss of an unofficial R&D branch that ultimately aided the Centre's interests.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ The SCP Foundation\n----\nAn extra-dimensional organisation focused on the containment of all Deviant technologies; it has notably interfered with Centre operations on multiple occasions. Most notably, the SCP Foundation's **Department of Extra-Universal Affairs** has funded a schism within the Centre – causing sceptical personnel to oppose the Centre under the banner of **Containment Initiative**.\n\nUltimately, the extra-dimensional origins of the SCP Foundation have caused most dissenters to return and re-pledge their loyalty to the Centre. Despite that, the \"SCP Foundation\" is speculated to be dangerous and will be dealt with harshly.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ World Wildlife Foundation\n----\nA mysterious organization, possibly funded by the Global Coalition of Countries, dedicated to speciating, conserving, and preserving wildlife. The WWF is known for having \"Species Conservation Preserves\", in which they house wildlife. They are believed to be responsible for preventing the beginning of a fifth mass extinction event. Their public fronts are concerned primarily with the preservation of all wildlife, but rumors suggest that they have a special interest in collecting Deviant wildlife, possibly for weaponization purposes. While uncanny similarities exist between the WWF and the SCP Foundation, reliable intelligence indicates that the two organizations do not collude.\n\nThe presence of the WWF, the SCP Foundation, and the Centre in this timeline is almost certainly a result of SPC-001 interference.\n\nThough if I'm being honest, it's funnier if Fae and Tim Wilson are the shadowy controllers of an all-powerful wildlife conservation organization, so I've started using Wilson's Wildlife Foundation recently.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ Union of American States' Center for Institutionalized Impacting (UASCII)\n----\nA proto-Centre organization existing in the Union of American States before the Second Benthic War. Not much information exists beyond black-boxes or pieces of paper pummelled into pulp. It is known, however, that the UASCII engaged in highly controversial Deviant experiments, as funded by the Union to protect humans against all Sharkic threats, real or imagined.\n\nThere is some scant evidence that suggests their reasons for engaging in selachian pugilism are drastically different from those of the modern Centre.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n++ The Serpent's Hand\n----\nThe Serpent's Hand is multiversal, so here, they're literally just the Serpent's Hand. Except they know that most universes aren't farces based on a pun.\n[[/div]]\n\n  [[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"meta-title\"]]\nCanon Information\n[[/div]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n  [[tab Clarification]]\n+ What is the Sharkest Timeline?\n++ Some Historical Context, and a Tuna Salad Sandwich\n----\n= //**The Sharkest Timeline** is a writing project aimed at reconstructing and resurrecting the original \"central storyline\" of the [[[spc-hub|Shark Punching Centre]]].//\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe Sharkest Timeline finds its earliest inspirational roots in [[[SCP-1449]]] and [[[It Always Has Been, It Always Has Not Been]]], both written by [[*user Djoric]]. In broad strokes, these stories envision a divergence from the Foundationverse into something we will call (for the sake of comparison) the Centreverse. The divergence is caused by a universal reality-altering event, but it was not a one-time event -- it can happen again. The present state of the Centreverse depends on the relationship that relevant parties have to the punching of sharks. When this relationship changes, the entire universe forces a transformation into a different version of itself: One in which the relationship to punching sharks remains, at the expense of reality. Thus, in these articles we see two radically different Centreverses emerge:\n\n* A less-developed world in which Selachiosk Pungix Combin, a loose collection of fraternal nomads, engages in shark-punching purely for their own survival.\n* A hyper-advanced world in which The Center, a global superpower, has mastered the art of shark-punching, and whose society and social customs are incomprehensible.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, writers [[*user MrWrong]] and [[*user sirpudding]] came around and established something new: What matters is whether the act of shark-punching remains __funny__. When the Powers That Be (AKA The Mistaken Beast, which represents the real-world contributors of the SCP Wiki, S. Andrew Swann's \"Horror Writers\") no longer consider shark-punching \"funny\", the universe course-corrects and transforms itself into something far more absurd and ridiculous. In other words, whenever the Centre stops punching sharks, or when their means of punching sharks are no longer considered funny, their universe course-corrects so that it remains funny; so that it was //always// funny. The inherent tension that comes with maintaining the humour in Selachian pugilism is a driving theme in this canon and the universe in which it resides.\n\n+ What are some of its absurd features?\n----\n= //When writing for **The Sharkest Timeline**, think less grim//dark //and more grim//__shark__.\n\n@@ @@\n\nThousands of years ago, a universe similar to the Foundationverse underwent a massive shift in reality, and the Centreverse emerged from its ashes. So began the Sharkest Timeline.\n\nThis is not a world where neoliberal global capitalism reigns supreme. It is a world run by an underwater cabal of power- and flesh-hungry human-shark-octopus abominations known as the Sharkic cults.\n\nThis is not a world where the Anomalous is secured, contained, and protected. In fact, there is no Veil to speak of. It is a world in which various groups use and abuse the Deviant (AKA the Anomalous) to manage and maintain the Global Ocean, power their technology, and help them punch sharks better than other groups.\n\nIt is a world where the Daeva died in a boating accident, and the Centre continually resurrects them via the Chronicle of Daeva so as to learn their increasingly advanced techniques for punching sharks.\n\n+ How does the Sharkest Timeline differ from standard SPC?\n----\nStandard SPC is less constrained: It does not necessarily need to adhere to these principles. The Sharkest Timeline, however, is anything that:\n# Adheres to these principles,\n# Exists in a shared universe with other articles that adhere to these principles, and\n# Does not contradict other articles in the Sharkest Timeline in a way that cannot be explained in-universe.\n\nSee the \"On SPC-001\" tab for more details on the one unbreakable rule.\n\n  [[/tab]]\n  [[tab On SPC-001]]\n\n+ SPC-001: The Mistaken Beast\n----\nThe original intent of the ideas that were the antecedents of the Sharkest Timeline was that there was only one SPC-001 -- the Mistaken Beast, a Pataphysical flaw in the universe. The typo SPC led to the spawning of an entire universe around the idea.\n\nThat ship has sailed. The originators of that idea are no longer around, and it would feel wrong to write an SPC-001 that is the //entirety// of the Mistaken Beast without them. However, that should not preclude SPC-001s that are proposals for //how// to deal with the Mistaken Beast.\n\nIn a way, this is more true to the spirit of SPC. There is one Deviance/Anomaly driving all the action, and every proposal is a way to take it down.\n\nFor an SPC-001 to be in the Sharkest Timeline, it must follow one of the following criteria:\n# It must treat the Mistaken Beast as the \"true\" SPC-001.\n# It must be about the Mistaken Beast; the Mistaken Beast is the 001 being described in the SPC.\n# It must reveal some aspect or interpretation of the Mistaken Beast, or otherwise be some way of dealing with it.\nWe can't technically stop you from declaring your stuff as part of The Sharkest Timeline if it doesn't follow these rules, but we ask that you don't.\n  [[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote table2\" style=\"width: fit-content; margin: auto\"]]\n++ [*https://discord.gg/ZAyqDSpZ4Y Join the Metafoundation Discord Server!]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"notation table2\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=LORDXVNV, Lt Flops, Crow-Cat, and ThisIsNalkan]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Filename:** [*https://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-sharkest-timeline/the-sharkest-map-by-thisisnalkan.png the-sharkest-map-by-thisisnalkan.png]\n**Author:** [[*user ThisIsNalkan]]\n**License:** [*http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 3.0)]\n**Source Link:** Self\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Filename:** Hammerhead_silhouette.jpg\n**Author:** istolethetv\n**License:** [*https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/ Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)]\n**Source Link:** [*https://flic.kr/p/6rm7Pu Flickr]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n/* == COMMON == */\n\n :root {\n\t--header-title: \"The Sharkest Timeline\";\n\t--header-subtitle: \"SEARCH, PUNCH, CONQUER\";\n\t--link-txt-color: hsl(191, 100%, 25%);\n\n\t--abyssal: hsl(221, 100%, 25%);\n\t--terrestrial: hsl(101, 100%, 25%);\n\t--non-abyssal: hsl(181, 50%, 25%);\n\t--celestial: hsl(201, 100%, 50%);\n}\n\n\n div#extra-div-1 {\n\tbackground-size: 150px;\n}\n\n #header h1 {\n\tfont-variant: small-caps;\n}\n\n\n/* == FORMATTING | [GENERAL] == */\n\n .meta-title {\n\tpadding: 0;\n\n\tfont-family: var(--head-font), sans-serif;\n\tfont-variant: small-caps;\n}\n\n #page-content :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {\n\tdisplay: flex;\n\tjustify-content: center;\n\n\tfont-family: var(--ui-font), sans-serif;\n\tfont-variant: small-caps;\n\n\tline-height: 1.2;\n\ttext-align: center;\n\ttext-underline-offset: 25%;\n}\n\n li, p {\n\tline-height: 1.5 !important;\n}\n\n ol li,\n ul li {\n\tmargin: 1rem 0;\n}\n\n/* == FORMATTING | [SPECIAL] == */\n\n .abyssal :is(h1, h2, h3) {\n\tcolor: var(--abyssal);\n}\n\n .terrestrial :is(h1, h2, h3) {\n\tcolor: var(--terrestrial);\n}\n\n .non-abyssal :is(h1, h2, h3) {\n\tcolor: var(--non-abyssal);\n}\n\n .col_box, .spec_col_box { /* = COLORFUL BOX = */\n\t--hex: transparent;\n\t--hex2: transparent;\n\tposition: relative;\n\tdisplay: inline-block;\n\twidth: 1.2rem;\n\theight: 1.2rem;\n\tmargin-bottom: .2rem;\n\tvertical-align: middle;\n\n\tbackground: var(--hex);\n\tborder: medium solid var(--hex2);\n\n\tfont-size: 0;\n}\n\n .spec_col_box { /* = COLORFUL BOX ADD-ON = */\n\twidth: calc(1.2rem + 3px);\n\theight: calc(1.2rem + 3px);\n}\n\n .spec_col_box:before { /* = COLORFUL BOX ADD-ON = */\n\tposition: absolute;\n\tinset: 0;\n\tpadding: 3px;\n\tcontent: \"\";\n\n\tbackground: \n\t   repeating-conic-gradient(#c7b187 0 25%, #815eba 0 50%)\n\t\t0 0/12px 12px round;\n\t-webkit-mask:\n\t   linear-gradient(#000 0 0) content-box,\n\t   linear-gradient(#000 0 0);\n\t-webkit-mask-composite: xor;\n\tmask-composite: exclude;\n}\n\n/* == DIV BLOCKS == */\n\n div a {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n\n @media (max-width: 575.9px) {\n\t .modal, .jotting, .paper, .notation {\n\t\tmargin: 1rem 0;\n\t}\n}\n\n/* == TABLES == */\n\n .special table {\n\tdisplay: block !important;\n\tmax-height: 85vh;\n\toverflow: auto;\n\tcounter-reset: line-number;\n}\n\n .special table a {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n\n .special th {\n\ttext-align: center;\n}\n\n .special td:first-child:before {\n\tcontent: counter(line-number) \".\";\n\tcounter-increment: line-number;\n\tpadding-right: .3rem;\n}\n\n .special td:nth-child(3) {\n\tmin-width: 25%;\n\n\tline-height: 1.5;\n}\n\n .special td:nth-child(4) {\n\tmin-width: 20%;\n\n\tfont: 1rem monospace;\n\ttext-align: right;\n}\n\n/* == YUI TABS == */\n\n .yui-navset .yui-nav a {\n\tfont-size: 1.25rem;\n\tfont-weight: 600;\n\tfont-family: var(--ui-font), sans-serif;\n}\n[[/module]]",
