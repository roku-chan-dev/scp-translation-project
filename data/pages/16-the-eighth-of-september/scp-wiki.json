He had long suspected today would be a difficult day at Site-43, had put the psychologists and EPAU on conditional alert ahead of time. Ibanez's agents would be on the lookout for depression or suicidal behaviour, and every Section was on reduced duty for the duration. He'd even considered giving a speech, guidelines be damned, but felt there'd been enough of those already. They'd been talking about memory and moving on for weeks by now, and that seemed a fair enough note on which to greet this dread anniversary.\n\nBut when the call came in, McInnis was still taken by surprise. A failure of the Site's single most valuable asset, on today of all days, was not something he'd been prepared to countenance.\n\nIlse Reynders was pacing back and forth within the ADDC, a sheet of something copper clutched in one hand, blood streaming down her face. She must have pulled out a lock of her own hair; it would regrow within the next few hours, and the blood would gradually disappear. She was muttering frantically to herself, blue eyes wild. He couldn't hear what she was saying. The pencil was on the sill.\n\nThe guards nodded as he walked up to the glass, and knocked. \"Ilse? Ilse!\"\n\nHe wasn't sure she heard him, but she certainly noticed the change in the light. She darted to the window, snatched up her lifeline, and said: \"It's today again.\"\n\nHe couldn't dispute that. He didn't patronize her, however; even half-mad, she had twice the mind he did. At least. \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It's today again. All over again. It's been this year twice already, and I can see more coming, Allan, I can… I can see it.\" She tended to slot in moments of silence where others would curse; she had, after all, come of age in the very early twentieth century. \"I've seen it all year, but it keeps getting… worse, and I can't… I can't handle it anymore.\" She laughed, unhinged. \"You have to fix it.\" She turned those deep, sad wells of cerulean on him, and repeated herself. \"You //have// to fix it, Allan.\"\n\n\"Please calm down.\" He put one hand on the glass, as he'd seen Scout do countless times, to still her nerves. She was the most emotionally mature person he'd ever met -- she'd had decades to become accustomed to her situation, and its consequences -- but decades of entrapment took their toll, whether time stood still or not. \"Focus on the facts. Tell me what's going on.\"\n\nShe shook her head, and started to walk deeper into the chamber. When the pencil nearly separated from the string, she staggered back and struck her head on the window. An ugly smear of blood was left behind, and she tapped her forehead against it again. \"I'm not crazy. It's back, Allan. It's back. It's boiling up, and you have to stop it. I'm not crazy. Hyperbolic.\"\n\nHis veins froze over as she pressed both hands to the glass, and repeated the word: \n\n\"Hyperbolic.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Where'd he go?\"\n\n\"AAF-A.\" McInnis' secretary looked very concerned. \"Checking on Dr. Reynders.\"\n\n\"What?\" Harry worked out his jaw until it popped. \"Something's wrong with Ilse?\"\n\nHe had a sudden urge to dart out of the office; he liked Ilse Reynders. Nobody didn't, except for maybe Lillian. But he didn't get the chance, because the outer door slammed open hard enough for the knob to strike the wall, and Imrich Sýkora burst in. \"I need to speak to the Director, right now!\"\n\nHarry held up both hands. \"He's out. Can I help you?\"\n\nSýkora's always-composed face was frantic as he looked Harry up and down. \"Where's the All-Sections Chief?\"\n\n\"On the res. Annual negotiations. What's up?\"\n\nSýkora pointed at him. \"You're the Director //de facto// right now. Right? Don't wheedle, I know I'm right.\" The occultist actually seized Blank by his labcoat lapels, and very clearly attempting not to scream, he said: \"You need to flush AAF-D. You need to flush it //right this minute.//\"\n\nHarry recoiled from the other man's manic brown eyes. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nSýkora produced his notepad, and waved it in Harry's face. \"You've been briefed on me. You know my deal. I'm telling you right now--\"\n\nHarry headed for the inner door. He did know Sýkora's deal. \"Buzz the lock.\"\n\nZulfikar pressed the button beneath his desktop, and Harry flung the door wide. A few long strides took him to the redline, and he dialled it up.\n\n\"Monitoring room,\" a bored voice responded. There was suddenly shouting in the background. //Fuck. I'm too late!//\n\n\"Activate the vacuum flush. Activate it //now.//\"\n\n\"Uhhh… board shows green, sir, but alright.\" The voice didn't actually sound bored, Harry realized. It sounded disoriented. \"Uh… vacuum flush? How… do I do that?\"\n\n\"The breach alarm! Hit the damn breach alarm button!\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Harry could actually hear the click, and then the klaxons crying out in the distant corridors. \"You should've just said that. Who is this, anyway?\"\n\n\"This is Dr. Blank.\" //And when this is all over, your name is going to be __mud__, buddy.// \"Who am I talking to?\"\n\n\"I'll get back to you on that.\" The voice was sly, if still more than a little dazed. \"Oh. Oh! We, we, we have multiple…\" The voice broke off into messy tears. Harry felt a knot in his stomach as he waited for the words to resume, and when they did the knot tightened so hard and so fast he almost vomited into the receiver. \"Hyperbolic. Hyperbolic. All of F-D is going up, sir. All at once.\"\n\n//Oh, no. No. No no no no no--//\n\nHe hung up, reached over the edge of McInnis' desk to thumb the button he found there, then plucked the phone back off its cradle as the breach alarms wailed. \"Get me Nascimbeni and Ibanez. Conference call.\" He nearly fell over as his vision abruptly doubled. //Christ, not __again__...//\n\nThe line went dead. Zulfikar knew what was what, and didn't waste time with affirmations. There was a moment's pause, then the old man's croaking voice came through: \"Nascimbeni.\" A second later: \"Ibanez.\"\n\n\"Hyperbolic in F-D.\" The words were hot lead on his tongue. \"I ordered a vacuum flush, but the duty tech says it's still happening.\"\n\nHe heard a clattering sound, and two sets of heavy footfalls, and as one of them receded and the other remained steady he realized one of them had dropped their phone while the other stayed on the line.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n//This is impossible.//\n\nIt //was// impossible. AAF-D was in a holding pattern. Nothing new was being processed. There were no staff in there today, minus Deering mopping the floors. The kid didn't take days off anymore, since his 'supervisor' didn't. As for Code Hyperbolic, well, that was a thing of the past. Any system approaching critical recondicity could be instantly vacuum-flushed into the Inter-Sectional Subway System with the press of a button; Nascimbeni would be astounded if any of the pipes had even burst, much less the tanks or vats.\n\n//Maybe it was the beer bottles,// he thought deliriously as he entered the airlock at a nimble jog. He'd been working out with Ibanez -- in more ways than one -- so where he'd been huffing and puffing last year, now the only tightness in his chest came from the inexplicable circumstances. His palate, however, was dry as a bone.\n\nIt was a straight shot to the monitoring room -- it had taken weeks to shore up the floor where the impermeable void had formed -- and he had plenty of time to examine the pipes. There was certainly recondite material where it shouldn't have been, but it was moving through the system at triple speed thanks to the order Harry had given, pulled into collectors and dumped through the magnetic oscillation pumps via a tremendous suction force originating outside of AAF-D the minute the alarm had been triggered. Nothing was overloading, whatever the tech might have said. The possibility that this was some sort of prank occurred to him, but he dismissed it just as quickly. Only a J&M tech could have dialled up the redline…\n\nHe blew past Phil, who was standing in the final doorway with a mop in his hand and a look of total bafflement on his face. \"Chief!\" He shouted. \"What the fuck?!\"\n\nNascimbeni ignored him, skidding out of the doorway, heading for the monitoring room //what the fuck WHAT THE FUCK// \"WHAT THE FUCK!\" he shouted, nearly falling to the floor in disbelief.\n\n//Everything is wrong.// The halls were wrong, the floors and ceilings were wrong, the pipes along the walls were wrong and had been since he'd entered. None of the repairs and refurbishments he and his team had laboured over for the better part of a year were visible.\n\n//The better part of a year.// He saw it, even as he scrambled back into a run, heading past the monitoring room windows for the door.\n\nHe was in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D, circa 2002.\n\nHe rounded the last corner at speed, threw his weight into the door, and crashed through. He saw two flashes of orange, and he wondered why anyone would be wearing their uniforms when nobody was meant to be on duty…\n\n…and then he realized they were the wrong uniforms, jackets instead of jumpsuits, and baseball caps. Only he still wore his baseball cap…\n\n…and then he realized who was //in// the uniforms, and the tightness in his chest changed its nature abruptly, and his muscles cried out in sudden agony.\n\n\"Boss?!\" Romolo Ambrogi darted forward as the old man fell to the floor. \"Boss, what's… Dave! Call H&P! Right now!\"\n\nAs David Markey made the call, Nascimbeni had a heart attack.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIbanez hadn't felt this wired in months, and she couldn't figure out why.

S&C, he thought, and he knew it was the right decision. //Tell the guards.// If he'd been really on his game, he would have realized he was running away at this very moment from the Chief of Security and Containment, but that was rather a lot to ask.\n\nIt wasn't a long run, as Replication Studies practically backed onto Ibanez's angry stomping ground, though it certainly felt long enough.

Miss Astrauskas is flying back from Area-21 at this moment, and will be on-hand to identify the auras of the ones she knew personally by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. In the meantime we need to learn as much as we can, and make certain the… situation, in AAF-D, is resolved.\"\n\n\"It's a good damn thing we based the suction systems //outside,//\" Nascimbeni said. \"If they'd been inside, they would've disappeared, and the whole fucking facility would have blown up.

He might have blinked both eyes, actually, but it was impossible to tell -- what with the big black patch over his left orbit. Nobody could explain where that had come from; he'd somehow picked it up while the guards weren't looking.\n\n\"We watched you make that appointment in S&C, talk to yourself for a while, and then run -- unsuccessfully -- away from a cascade containment failure. It swallowed you whole, and dissolved you.\"\n\n\"Huh.\" He shook his head. \"Can't say as I remember being swallowed whole and dissolved.

They'll remain Class E, but they'll have their relative freedom. Within the bounds of 43, we can watch them. Monitor them. Make sure there's nothing further anomalous about their failure to remain deceased.\"\n\n\"And after that?\" Nascimbeni asked.
