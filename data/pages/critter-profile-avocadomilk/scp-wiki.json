We barely know anything about him, heck we don't even know if it's alive. He's an avocado. That's pretty much it. I also think he's really handsome.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThe Superiors gave us Avocado a few months ago, for who knows what reason. Anyways, they were terrified of him. Absolutely terrified. Petrified even. Sometimes we wonder why. Avocado is, just a regular avocado. We might just end up putting him in the kitchen. Or just eat him. I haven't had guac in a hot minute.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nAvocado does not need to be cared for. He cares for himself. He just sits there. Surprised he hasn't rotted yet.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Avocado!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nAnother thing, Avocado was dropped off here at Wilson's by some gal. Red hair, about 2 metres tall. Pretty sure she said her name was, Avery Cado. Weird. She was oddly sad to see him go. not like she's an empath or anything like that, but she was acting strange. Anyways, she was in a rush and I think she dropped a note, since I found it in the parking lot.
