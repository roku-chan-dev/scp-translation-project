The process involves showing the target personnel affection and positive affirmations while ensuring to downplay their negative emotions as fruitless. This results in the target personnel feeling more pleased with life in 60% of cases.\n\n38% of further cases require a combination of more intense therapeutic efforts as well as medication. The Fire Suppression Department utilizes a unique drug to further rehabilitate personnel who fall into this bracket of LUCKY HARE protocol.\n\nThe final 2% of personnel who fall into LUCKY HARE protocol require more direct measures. They will often require overwhelming evidence of their good fortune, and as such, the use of anomalies has been approved to improve morale. Anomalies approved for use in LUCKY HARE protocol's 2% procedures are typically unassuming in appearance and can be mistaken for non-anomalous objects, which lends the project credibility. \n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"READ MORE\" hide=\"READ MORE\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish, I guess.\n\n- //Jay Everwood//\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#DFFFF3 url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/life-insurance-policy/fsd.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n\n= __FIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT CASE ID-7726XP__\n@@ @@\n= __UPDATE__\n@@ @@\nEverwood was found in their office by a passing guard at approximately 0000 hrs on 26/07/2022 after hearing shots coming from the direction.
