Testing of SCP-6598 was overseen by Researcher H. Hartwell and Dr. J. Dune.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6598 is an American quarter dated to 1983. When a subject makes a verbal statement and then flips SCP-6598, the object will land on a face corresponding to the statement's relation to objective fact. A result of \"heads\" denotes the truth, and \"tails\" denotes a falsehood. Questions and statements that are not yes-or-no questions will not lead to answers from SCP-6598. The accuracy of the statements presented by SCP-6598 is presently under investigation.\n\n**Addendum 6598.1:** Experiment log\n\n||~ Statement ||~ Result ||\n|| Grass is green. (Dune) || Heads. ||\n|| SCP-6598 understands what I'm saying. (Dune) || Heads. ||\n|| SCP-6598 is having a good day today. (Hartwell) || Tails. //Note: SCP-6598 was noted to have landed with unusual force.// ||\n|| The first number of the winning lottery numbers for tomorrow is 1. (Hartwell) || Tails. ||\n||||= //[25 tests omitted]// ||\n|| The final number of the winning lottery numbers for tomorrow is 7. (Hartwell) || Heads. //Winnings seized. Using anomalies for further personal gain will lead to disciplinary action -- Dir. Paul Lague//||\n|| Dr. Dune ate a sandwich for lunch this afternoon. (Hartwell) ||Heads. //Thing’s a smartass. A hot dog is not a sandwich -- J. Dune// ||\n|| Extraterrerestial life exists. (Dune) || Tails. The test was repeated with several variations of the question, specifying life in the entire universe, etc. Result remained tails. ||\n|| Baseball is a boring sport. (Hartwell)|| SCP-6598 flipped itself between heads and tails until the next statement was made. ||\n|| //Star Wars: Episode 8: The Last Jedi// is a bad film. (Hartwell) || Same result as in the previous test. Upon repetition of the statement, SCP-6598 drastically increased in temperature to the point where it could not be safely handled. It returned to baseline temperature after fifteen minutes.||\n|| SCP-6598 likes Dr. Dune more than Researcher Hartwell. (Dune)|| Same result as in the previous test. Hesitation was observed in SCP-6598 every time it flipped to its heads side. ||\n|| God can create a burrito so hot that he can't eat it. (Hartwell)|| SCP-6598 burned Researcher Hartwell's hand. ||\n|| SCP-6598 dislikes paradoxes. (Hartwell)|| Heads. Considerable force was observed upon its landing, enough to dent the testing table. ||\n|| SCP-6598 enjoys being flipped. (Hartwell)|| Tails. Same result as in the previous test. SCP-6598 managed to punch though the table upon its landing.||\n|| SCP-6598 will breach containment in the future. (Hartwell)|| Heads. ||\n|| [[[SCP-682]]] is indestructible. (Hartwell)|| Tails. //Researcher Hartwell's lottery winnings have been budgeted for further decommissioning tests -- Dir. Paul Lague//||\n|| [[[SCP-4182 | Site-5]]] does not exist. (Dune)|| Heads. Following the repetition of this test, SCP-6598 reversed its decision. Subsequent tests have not delivered conclusive results.||\n|| I will be with my girlfriend in five years. (Hartwell)|| Tails. ||\n|| Everything dies. (Hartwell)|| Heads. The Department of Tactical Theology immediately called a symposium to discuss the ramifications of this result. ||\n|| I will die in the next ten years. (Hartwell)|| Heads. ||\n|| SCP-6598 is upset with me. (Hartwell)|| SCP-6598 hung stationary in the air. It began to violently vibrate before accelerating to approximately 1100 km/h and exiting Site-322 through Researcher Hartwell's skull (with a minor course correction to avoid striking Dr. Dune). ||\n\nSCP-6598 was recovered in an empty parking lot approximately 30 kilometers from Site-322, laying on its head side. A small impact crater was observed in the asphalt surrounding it. Following the final test, SCP-6598 has remained facing heads up, despite all attempts to rotate it or supply additional prompts. Testing halted.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6597]]] | SCP-6598 | [[[SCP-6599]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=PlaguePJP, HarryBlank, Cremo, & J Dune]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** coin.png\n> **Author:** Arun Kumar Singh\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Quarter.jpg]\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
