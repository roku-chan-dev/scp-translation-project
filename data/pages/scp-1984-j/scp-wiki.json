After this, publication of SCP-1984-J will be halted indefinitely. Copies of SCP-1984-J will be gathered by MTF-Î´-9184 (\"The Overspecifics\"), whereafter they are to be incinerated.\n\nSimultaneously with these efforts, latent C-Class amnestics are to be released by air throughout the planet. Once all copies of SCP-1984-J have been destroyed, these amnestics are to be activated, permanently eliminating any memory of SCP-1984-J from human consciousness.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1984-J is the novel //Nineteen Eighty-Four//, by English author George Orwell. SCP-1984-J tells the story of a hypothetical dystopia in which independent thought is criminalized and an unseen character called \"Big Brother\" is worshipped as a dictator.\n\nSCP-1984-J compels people who are aware of it to compare any use of control or power to the dystopia portrayed in Orwell's work, no matter how absurd of a comparison this may be. Consult Addendum 1 for more information. \n\nWhile no individual appears entirely immune to this effect, individuals who have actually read SCP-1984-J seem much less susceptible. \n\n**Addendum 1:**\nThe following is an incomplete list of concepts compared to SCP-1984-J by Foundation Staff:\n* The use of amnestics to maintain the Veil;\n* The SCP Foundation's numerous misinformation campaigns;\n* The containment of humanoid anomalies;\n* Being requested not to defecate in a personal trashcan;\n* The termination of a Portuguese tribal community;\n* The implementation of ACS across the SCP Foundation;\n* Site-4214's dress code policies, specifically the wearing of safety goggles during experiments;\n* \"Project: Whack-A-Mole\";\n* The United States Government doing anything, ever, for any reason;\n* The Dictionary;\n* Redaction and expungement of non-info/cognitohazards;\n* The existence of gay people;\n* The implementation of stringent countermeasures to control dangerous thought across the non-anomalous world through introduction of alternative facts so as to maintain a safe normalcy;\n* Any political ideology except for Neoliberalism;\n* Neoliberalism;\n* \"Every religion that has ever existed, I swear\";\n* Internet Moderation.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"You have one(1) new message\" hide=\"Hide message\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Jamie van Petrol (Site-4214 Researcher) <{{vanpetrol@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Gummi Johnson (Site-4214 Director) <{{gjohnson@scp.foundation}}>\n\nThe special containment procedures for SCP-1984-J concern me. As an anomaly, SCP-1984-J poses no real threat to the Veil, or to humanity. And yet, we are going out of our way to eliminate an iconic work of literature from the public consciousness? This feels wrong. I get SCP-1984-J can be annoying at times, but surely there are better ways of handling it than this. Right now, it just all feels a bit Fahrenheit 451.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
