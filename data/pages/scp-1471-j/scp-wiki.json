OWNER INFORMATION:**\n> \n> **Name of owner:**\n> \n> **Phone model and year:**\n> \n> **Operating system/platform:**\n> \n> **Date SCP-1471-J file was discovered:**\n\n> **2. APPLICATION INFORMATION:**\n> \n> **Profile present in application database:** yes | no | unsure\n> \n> **Log any messages received below, along with the name of the sender:**\n> \n> **Owner comments:**\n\nAs SCP-1471-J manifests and downloads itself from an unknown source without displaying any notifications on the phone in question, complete tracking, identification, and containment of the application is not possible at this point. Affected personnel should regularly check their phone's list of currently running applications and close SCP-1471-J if it is active. Following safe deletion of the application, affected persons should search the installed application list on their mobile device at least thrice weekly in order to ensure the application has not been re-downloaded without their knowledge.\n\nGiven the known inaccuracy of the application's portrayal of Foundation employees, as well as the presence of material not suitable for a work environment, affected persons may request their names and related information be redacted in this document at their discretion.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1471-J is an anomalously manifesting iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and GNU/Linux application file which, upon launch, will display the title \"Sensual Containment Procedures\" with the subtitle \"The Foundation's one and only dating and hookup app.\"\n\n[[include component:image-block name=rights.png|caption=Dr. Rights' profile, as seen displayed on Dr. ███████'s phone|width=300px]]\n\nSCP-1471-J has three functions:\n\n* a messaging feature, which is accessible from the navigation bar at the top of the interface\n* a profile viewing and creation feature, which allows customization of name, age, location, interests, etc. (but often changes back to its original format regardless of user customization) as well as a section devoted to the profile owner's timestamped status updates\n* a home page, accessible by tapping the logo in the top left, which displays the most recent status updates by users\n\nSCP-1471-J can be safely removed from a mobile device through the operating system's typical deletion method(s), but often reappears at a time ranging from one to seven weeks afterward. The application contains no malicious programs or viruses and does not affect the device unless the program is running. Of note is the fact that it almost always deletes any edited personal information after several hours, replacing it with its original content.\n\n**Addendum I:** Examples of SCP-1471-J's function and behavior are logged below; any names shown are shown with the permission of the person in question. Any messages shown are the last conversation before deletion of the program; any additional messages can be found by contacting Dr. Blanchard, if doing so is necessary, or by viewing the attached supplement log.\n\n**Recorded instance #42, documented 03.27.15:**\n\n> **1.
