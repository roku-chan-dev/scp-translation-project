Access to SCP-7911 is to be granted only to individuals with Level 2 security clearance and must be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel.\n\nSCP-7911-1 and SCP-7911-2 are not to be used for medical treatment under any circumstances. Due to its hazardous nature, caution is advised when handling SCP-7911. To minimize the risk of exposure, personnel must use protective equipment such as gloves when handling instances of SCP-7911. Any hospitals or medical facilities found to have received SCP-7911 instances are to be monitored and any instances of SCP-7911 are to be replaced with non-anomalous bandages and pills of similar appearance. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7911-1 and SCP-7911-2 (collectively referred to as SCP-7911), are medical equipment labeled \"ProMed Solutions\".[[footnote]] Medical Supply company was investigated and shown to have no direct connection to SCP-7911. Additionally, while said brand does produce bandages similar to SCP-7911-1, no productions of pills matching SCP-7911-2 have been found. [[/footnote]] SCP-7911-1 is a set of bandages that cause any wounds previously located under them to reopen and rapidly worsen, leading to severe injury or death. This is regardless of the timeframe at which the wounds were originally received. SCP-7911-2 consists of a bottle containing 35 pills which cause ███ ████████ ██████ ██ █ ███████ ██ ██████ [[footnote]]See: Incident Log 3215-1 for more information on effects. (Security Level 3 Required)[[/footnote]] simultaneously, leading to severe injury and death.\n\nSCP-7911's anomalous properties only become apparent after a certain amount of time has elapsed. The exact amount of time is variable, but subjects have reported experiencing symptoms within a time frame of seconds to several hours of being treated with SCP-7911-1 or ingesting SCP-7911-2.\n\nSCP-7911-1 (bandages) were discovered after a patient at St. Vincent's Medical Center, (located in Bridgeport, Pennsylvania) reported sharp pain under their bandages following treatment for a broken tibia. Upon removal, severe abrasions on the patient's knee were discovered, which quickly became infected, leading to amputation. A second patient received deep lacerations to their wrists and a third patient died due to inexplicable severe head trauma after a delicate surgery, both following treatment with SCP-7911-1.\n\nFoundation personnel were alerted to the existence of SCP-7911 after intercepting phone calls detailing the seemingly anomalous worsening of several patients' conditions. The Foundation swiftly replaced all instances of SCP-7911 with non-anomalous medical equipment. Efforts to determine the source of SCP-7911 initially proved inconclusive, as records showed no shipment of medical equipment due to arrive at the hospital on the day it was discovered. The rest of the medical equipment on the shipment performed as expected with no signs of anomalous activity. Further testing of SCP-7911 is ongoing.\n\n-----\n\n**Testing Logs:**\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nTest A - 2023-02-09\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-9123\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProcedure\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7911-1 is applied to the subject's shoulder and upper arm.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nResults\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nAfter 2 hours, the subject reported sharp pain in their shoulder. Upon examination, a bullet wound on the shoulder had opened, approximately one centimeter in diameter, with jagged edges and signs of inflammation on the skin and underlying tissue. It was found that the wound was consistent with the gun and ammunition used in a shooting D-9123 had been previously involved in before being taken into Foundation custody.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nAnalysis\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThe reopened wound is consistent with a previous injury that the subject had sustained suggesting that SCP-7911-1 may have some form of memory or recognition of past injuries, the exact mechanism by which it is able to determine past wounds is unknown.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nTest B - 2023-02-09\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-8335\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProcedure\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nA gunshot wound is inflicted on the subject's shoulder using a Foundation-standard handgun.

The object was removed after five minutes. Upon examination, the bullet wound had become infected with dermal tissue experiencing severe necrosis, consistent with what would be expected of an unattended gunshot during the course of several days.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nAnalysis\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nThis test suggests that the object may directly interfere with cellular degeneration, causing cellular death on a microscopic level, despite this, the object is molecularly identical to regular bandages.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nTest C - 2023-02-13\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-5692\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProcedure\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nA long laceration is inflicted on the subject’s left leg using a Foundation-standard knife.

The condition of reformed wounds is similarly proportional to the amount of time SCP-7911 is allowed to be kept in the subject.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nTest D - 2023-02-13\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-5692\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProcedure\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nA long laceration is inflicted on the subject’s right leg using a Foundation-standard knife.

This could prove beneficial in Foundation forensic tactics in order to determine the approximate time at which specific wounds were first received, but the side effects may prove too damaging for any extended use.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum:** //As part of the ongoing investigation on the origins of SCP-7911-1, researchers were led to an abandoned medical supply factory on the outskirts of Bridgeport, Pennsylvania. Retroactive monitoring of the site via city-owned security cameras showed an unplated truck coming from the inside of the facility on the day the bandages first made their appearance in St. Vincent's Medical Center, the driver of which remains unidentified.//\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF SITE-18\n\nBased on the recent findings regarding the possible origins of SCP-7911, I strongly urge the Foundation to dispatch a Mobile Task Force to conduct a thorough investigation of the abandoned medical supply factory in Bridgeport, Pennsylvania. Given the potential danger posed by the anomalous properties of SCP-7911, it is imperative that the source of the bandages be located and secured to prevent any further incidents. I recommend that this be given the highest priority to ensure the safety of the general public and the containment of the anomaly.\n\n--Dr. Upkins, Researcher, Site-18\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+See: Post Operation Report - 7911- A\" hide=\"- Access Granted\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**-Post Operation Report - 7911- A**\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023/01/15/ 14:25 pm\n\n**Location:** Abandoned Medical Supply Manufacturing Facility\n\n**Mobile Task Force:** MTF Gamma-12 \"Revenant Wrappers\"\n\n**Foreword:** Area was secured ahead of time, MTF-Gamma-12 arrived at the front facility at 14:06 and after a preliminary assessment, with the site showing no unusual activity, entered 14 minutes later through the front entrance. Upon arrival, the perimeter fence was found partially collapsed and overgrown with weeds. The building itself was in a state of disrepair, with many window panes broken and large holes in the side.\n\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN REPORT]\n\n//After gaining entry through the boarded-up main entrance, the MTF team entered a lobby area filled with debris and missing floor tiles. They encountered a circular reception desk with a sign that read \"Welcome to ProMed Solutions\" alongside a faded green armchair, dark wood shelves lining the back wall, and scattered books on the floor. The team then proceeded to the main factory plant through a security door labeled \"Staff only\".//\n\n//Inside the plant, the team came across a sprawling expanse of heavy machinery and equipment, showing signs of wear and deterioration. The team searched each section of the main factory floor, coming across fallen machinery that was cleared to reveal a set of stairs leading to a hallway on the second level. The hallway featured doors and access to catwalks and elevated rooms overlooking the factory floor. They carefully made their way across the platform, where they had a  panoramic view of the factory floor. Piles of boxes and crates, along with dismantled assembly lines, conveyor belts, rusted pipes, and large gears were scattered throughout the space. While preparing to explore the rooms, a team member observed a faint light coming from under a door.//\n\n//Upon opening the door, the team was met by a pharmaceutical laboratory. In stark contrast with the rest of the facility, the lab was brightly lit, with white walls and gleaming metal counter tops. There were several workstations with computers and lab equipment, all fully functional and operational. [[footnote]] Examination of the computer equipment showed the removal of all digital storage mediums from all computers with one exception.[[/footnote]] In the desks, there is medical research equipment. The lab appeared to have been meticulously maintained, even after the rest of the facility had fallen into disrepair. At the back of the room in the main desk the team found several SCP-7911-1 instances carefully laid out in a stack, and alongside them, labeled identically to the bandages, a single bottle of pills, designated SCP-7911-2. They recovered, alongside the SCP-7911 instances, mechanical hard drives, a plethora of medical research equipment, as well as swipe samples of surfaces in the lab.[[footnote]] Swipe samples were later confirmed to be almost perfectly sterile. Recovered medical equipment was confirmed to be non-anomalous and standard for regular pharmaceutical use.[[/footnote]] After carefully exploring the upper level, with the rest of the rooms showing no unusual activity, the team returned to the main floor of the factory and left the facility with no further obstructions.//\n\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n**Recovered Materials**\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"See: SCP-7911 - Recovered Materials Log\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\nNote: //The following conversation was extracted from the wiped hard drives found within the laboratory discovered by the MTF Gamma-12 \"Revenant Wrappers\" expedition following data recovery procedures.//\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ████████@gmail.com\n**From:** ███@gmail.com\n**Subject:** Just a friendly Email.\n[[/div]]\n------\nHey, bud!

First of all, let me just wish you the best of luck with your operation, I heard St. Vincents is a really nice place. I am certain that they will patch you right up.\n\nYou know, The recent closure of the company was heartbreaking for me, and I’m sure it must’ve been difficult for you to hear of it as well. It's just hard for me to let it go. I was just thinking about all those times we spent together, those restless nights, those fun memories. Working at that factory changed my life. I often find myself lost in thought, reminiscing about the past and the moments we shared, the challenges we overcame, and the laughs we shared. I cherish those memories dearly.\n\nIt’s funny isn’t it, how a wound can heal but it never truly goes away, forever leaving a scar reminding you of what once was there. How memories can fade, but the repercussions of the actions surrounding them stay. But as I reflect on the past, I can’t help but also contemplate the future. It’s all so uncertain, isn’t it? We strive to make sense of it all, to find meaning and purpose, but the truth is that life is ever-changing and always evolving. You know, we're all just wandering through life, trying to make sense of it all, trying to leave our mark on the world before our time is up. But what does it all mean, really? Sometimes it feels like everything is just a cycle, repeating itself over and over again, It seems like no matter how hard we try, everything we hold dear will eventually slip through our fingers. \n\nEvery relationship, every accomplishment, every moment of happiness - they all inevitably crumble to dust. And what do we have left? Memories that haunt us with the pain of what once was. It's like we're all just prisoners of this endless cycle, doomed to experience the same joys and sorrows over and over again, with no escape. The same patterns, the same mistakes, the same pain, it all stays the same, and yet… everything changes. Sometimes the changes are little and seemingly insignificant, to where they are barely perceptible. Sometimes the changes are big and consequential. Sometimes, they amount to **nothing**.\n\nI guess that's the nature of the universe. Nothing is permanent, but everything sort of is, in its own beautiful way. Everything is constantly in flux, but somehow, everything still manages to hold onto its own unique identity. Even as things change, they still retain some essence of what they once were. It’s almost like a paradox, how something can be both fleeting and eternal at the same time. It's a bittersweet realization, but in a way, it's freeing. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough. I can only hope to be able to set you free as well.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n\n**Incident Logs**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ See: Incident Log 216 - 2023 - WARNING: Level 3 Security Clearance is required. \" hide=\"- Access Granted\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Incident 216 - 2023: Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023/02/16 13:00\n\n**Location:** Fairview General Hospital, Bridgeport, Pennsylvania.\n\n**Civilians Involved:** William Harrington, Jennifer García, Dr. Allan\n\n**Mobile Task Force:** MTF Gamma-12 \"Revenant Wrappers\"\n\n**Foreword:**  //On 12/20/2023, Telecommunication Monitoring Office Foundation agents intercepted an emergency call originating from Fairview General Hospital. MTF Agents were dispatched to investigate and contain the situation, arriving at the hospital approximately 5 minutes later. Once there, MTF Gamma-12 evacuated all civilians, secured the perimeter, and recovered several items. A Specialized Foundation Biohazardous Materials Cleanup team was then dispatched with the hospital reopening 4 hours later following the completion of decontamination and removal of biohazardous material on site.//\n\n//All witnesses, including hospital staff and visitors, were amnestized by Foundation personnel in accordance with standard protocol. In the aftermath of the incident, the Foundation provided a cover story to local authorities to support an explanation that would minimize public exposure, with local media outlets reporting that the hospital had been evacuated due to a gas leak.//\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Video taken from a hospital security camera. William Harrington is escorted into the room by a nurse. The subject is seen sitting down on a hospital bed. He can be seen texting on his phone and scrolling through social media. Fifteen minutes, Dr. Allan Grant walks into the room.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** Good morning Mr. Harrington, hope you're doing well.\n\n**William Harrington**: Well, I'm alive, if that's what you're asking, so I suppose that's something. How are you today, doc?\n\n**Dr. Grant:** I'm doing good, but let's just skip the formalities, shall we? I suspect you might be impatient for the results.\n\n**William Harrington**: Right, so then?\n\n**Dr. Grant:** The lab test results are all within the norm.\n\n**William Harrington**: That's great to hear, Dr. Grant. Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Grant**: However, we want to monitor your recovery closely and ensure that you're healing properly. You'll need to stay here for at least another week or so before we can consider releasing you.\n\n**William Harrington**: Another week? That's longer than I was expecting.\n\n**Dr. Grant**: I understand it's not ideal, Mr. Harrington. But please know that we're doing this for your own safety and well-being. You underwent major surgery, and we want to make sure you're fully healed before we send you home.\n\n**William Harrington**: I appreciate that, doc. What can I expect?\n\n**Dr. Grant**: We'll continue to monitor your vital signs and check for any signs of infection or complications. You'll also receive physical therapy to help you regain your strength and mobility. And of course, you'll continue to receive pain management medication as needed.\n\n**Mr. Harrington**: Alright, I understand. I just want to get back home as soon as possible.\n\n**Dr. Grant**: I understand, Mr. Harrington. We'll do everything we can to make your stay as comfortable as possible, and we'll work with you to develop a discharge plan once you're ready to go home.\n\n**Mr. Harrington**: Right, thanks.\n\n//Dr. Grant nods and proceeds to exit the room, closing the door behind him. Mr. Harrington continues texting then lies down on the bed and begins watching TV.//\n\n-----\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023/02/16 14: 35\n\n//Patient falls asleep.//\n\n-----\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023/02/16 16:45\n\n//Patient wakes from sleep. Mr. Harrington appears to look blankly at a wall for an extended amount of time, then stands up and begins pacing back and forth. He activates the call nurse button, and a nurse enters the room//\n\n**Nurse:** You shouldn't be standing, Is something wrong? \n\n//The nurse motions for the patient to lie down on the bed. Mr. Harrington sits back down, then holds himself tightly against the bed.//\n\n**Nurse:** What is it?\n\n**William Harrington** (//Beginning to hyperventilate//) I don't feel so well. And my finger hurts.\n\n//Subject shows the finger to the nurse. A small cut can be observed.//\n\n**Nurse:** I don't see any-\n\n//Cut starts to extend at a rapid pace while tearing through skin and muscular tissue. Mr. Harrington clutches his chest and vocalizes loudly, followed by the appearance of scars and open wounds covering the subject's entire body, ranging from small cuts to large gashes. Serosanguineous drainage emerges from the open wounds as he begins showing signs of severe distress.//\n\n**Nurse:** What the-  SOMEONE HELP! I need a doctor in here, NOW!\n\n//The nurse quickly activates the emergency response system and cries out for help. Several doctors and nurses, alerted by the screaming, rush back into the room and attempt to stabilize the patient. Once the medical team arrives, they quickly wheel Mr. Harrington to the Intensive Care unit for further treatment and monitoring. Despite this, the manifestation continues to progress as the wounds on the patient's body begin to bleed profusely, with severe hemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock. Still, intact portions of skin begin to pale as the cuts deepen and widen. Large, gaping wounds appear on Mr. Harrington's limbs and torso as his breathing becomes ragged and strained, with vocalizations turning into agonized screams. He falls onto the ground on his hands and knees writhing in pain as blood and serosanguineous fluid pool around him.//\n\n//MTF Gamma-12 \"Revenant Wrappers\" arrive at the site and enter the room, then direct the medical staff to leave the room, while evacuating all civilians to a safe distance from the incident//\n\n//The subject's face begins to bleed uncontrollably as he experiences immense swelling, causing significant damage to the skull as sections of the cranium tear through the scalp and fall off, breaking into several pieces. Mr. Harrington appears to be conscious despite the severe damage to vital organs and systems usually needed for survival. As the manifestation progresses, the subject's bare eyes begin to exhibit direct lacerations, with punctures appearing to penetrate eye sockets. Brain tissue is now visible and cerebrospinal fluid is seen leaking from the wounds and exposed tissue in the subject's head. Subjects' mouth experiences rapid decay and the rotting of teeth, as well as severe inflammation of all mucus membranes. Limbs begin to separate and fall to the ground. Vocalizations, now unintelligible, continue as muscular tissue undergoes severe necrosis.//\n\n-----\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023/02/16 17:35\n\n//Vocalizations stop.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n-----\n\n//Addendum: Manifestation appears to have been caused via ingestion of SCP-7911-2, which caused the physical manifestation of all wounds and injuries experienced by the subject before the test in rapid succession and simultaneously. Any testing of SCP-7911-2 has been postponed indefinitely via request of the Ethics Committee. Members involved are to report to Researcher Upkins for approval of psychological therapy and may request approval for usage of Class-B amnestics.//\n\n//William Harrington was officially pronounced dead by Foundation Disinformation Teams two days later, attributed to complications stemming from the progression of his pancreatic cancer despite the success of previous surgeries and treatments.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nNote: //The following message was recovered at Fairview General Hospital.//\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nHey, bud. I heard you were transferred to a new hospital for your procedure. Probably for the best. They better be treating you well. Heard you are almost fully recovered and the surgery came out great, which is just amazing news. I've been dedicating my time to some personal projects of mine, they haven't quite worked out yet but I'm certain they will. As a celebration, I decided to use some of that time to come and visit you personally. You were asleep, so the nurses didn’t let me stay, but I was able to sneak in this gift basket, just for you. I wanted to show my appreciation for all the things you’ve done ya know? And don’t forget to take your meds bud, I know firsthand just how easy it is for you to forget. \nMay all your past wounds heal soon so you may soon be free, not bound, just like me.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7910]]] | SCP-7911 | [[[SCP-7912]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author= JorgeMtzb]]\nImage Source: https://pixabay.com/es/photos/vendaje-gasa-cura-2671512/\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
