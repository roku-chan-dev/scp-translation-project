It was a cornerstone of the American economy for many years.\n\nThe wireless power transmission of the tower was weaponized during World War II, when the energy of the tower was transmitted and concentrated above the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in retaliation to the surprise military strike at Pearl Harbor. The resulting arc flash (and blast) caused widespread destruction. \n\nThe resulting weapon was a global, instantaneous, and impossible to detect weapon of mass destruction. The Overseer Council deemed the Wardenclyffe Tower to be a breach of consensus reality and it was dismantled. Due to the growing distress of the American people that the lack of the Tower caused massive GDP decline, the Ennui Protocol was activated to prevent the creation of additional towers.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[table style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nEvent\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell]]\nDescription\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_Conspiracy Bielefeld]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\n[[span class=\"a\"]]@@[The Bielefeld Conspiracy is an inside joke]@@[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"d\"]]@@[The city of Bielefeld possesses mild cognitohazardous effects]@@[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\nThe city of Bielefeld (Germany) possesses a mild cognitohazardous effect where individuals acknowledging the town's existence may temporarily experience accessibility failure in memory, resulting in the individual believing the town doesn't exist.\n\nBy reducing the effects to merely an inside joke, when the cognitohazardous effects cease the brain will automatically jump to the conclusion retroactively that they were just joking, and not that they forgot that Bielefeld existed.\n\nThe Ennui Protocol was utilized due to frequent errors in containment due to the anomalous effect.\n@@ @@ \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[table style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nEvent\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell]]\nDescription\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality Augmented Reality Headpieces]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\n[[span class=\"a\"]]@@[Augmented Reality failed to become a popular consumer product]@@[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"d\"]]@@[Augmented Reality became a worldwide sensation]@@[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\nPortable Augmented Reality Headpieces became a major concern to the SCP Foundation since their inception.
