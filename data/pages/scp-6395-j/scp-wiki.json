All SCP Foundation personnel transformed into SCP-6395-J-A instances will not be contained and instead be allowed to roam free. Research into how to halt the spread of SCP-6395-J has become the Foundation's top priority. This file is to be freely distributed among the public to help --those stupid fucks-- [[footnote]]Who let Dr. Clef have editing access? OFish-1[[/footnote]] the civilian population become aware of SCP-6395-J.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6395-J is the designation for an ongoing event that has turned all sapient beings in Foundation employment and custody into anthropomorphic creatures bearing resemblance to aquatic mammals, typically fish (designated SCP-SCP-6395-J-A). SCP-6395-J is also a nomiclative hazard that changes the name of SCP-6395-J-A instances into \"play on word\" puns related to fish or aquatic animals. This also affects the name of organizations and items associated with SCP-6395-J-A instances. \n\nSome examples of SCP-6395-J-A include:\n\n* Dr. Bass Clef, MTF Lambda-2 Lead [[footnote]]Co-Lead! - Andrea Angler[[/footnote]]\n* Dr. Jackfish Bright, [[[SCP-963]]]\n* the Overfish Council\n* Site Director Tilda Mackerel [[footnote]]Personally, I would have found Minnow to be a better pun - Dir. Tilda Mackerel[[/footnote]]\n* Yossi Lingcod, Dept. of Tactical Theology Abrahamics Sublead\n* Decomfishioning Department Director Clownfish Bold\n* Dr. Lungfish Veritas\n* The Ethfishcommite\n* Dr. Everett Mannette, 0Fish-█\n\n**Discovery:** On 4/1/2022 at 00:00 UTC, Foundation Sites 01, 17, 19, 23, 69, 237, and 420 were all infected with SCP-6395-J, which quickly spread to all Foundation personnel and sites by 6:30, including transforming the SCiP database into a \"fish\" theme. \n\n**UPDATE:** As of 11:00 UTC, SCP-6395-J infection has begun spreading out of Foundation sites and infecting civilian populations. As a result, the clearance for SCP-6395-J's file has become public and distributed to the public. SCP-6395-J is spreading at a rate of approximately ███████ kilometers per second and is expected to have infected all of humanity by 23:59 UTC. [[footnote]]Dear Cod. - OFish-11[[/footnote]].\n\n[[=]]\n**TO ALL CIVILIANS**\n> Hello. You may be wondering what is happening right now.
