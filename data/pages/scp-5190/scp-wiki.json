The strength of this filter, however, reduces to almost zero whenever the instance is engaging in acts that would be considered criminal or otherwise socially inappropriate[[footnote]] Note, however, that the prospect of performing these kinds of actions provokes severe anxiety in most SCP-5190 instances. [[/footnote]].\n\nDespite what most SCP-5190 instances believe, the majority of their personal relationships reach the level of acquaintance at best — when pressed, most individuals who know SCP-5190 instances have described them as vaguely pleasant but ultimately insubstantial. In 80% of interviews conducted with individuals acquainted with SCP-5190 instances, they have had significant difficulty fully recalling details such as the instance's name and features; in the remaining 20%, they have failed to remember these details altogether.\n\nFollowing death, memories of the SCP-5190 instance will rapidly fade from the minds of all individuals who have encountered them. All observed cases have resulted in a complete loss of memories pertaining to the instance after a period of three days, save for a vague notion that the subject in question has forgotten something of little importance.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum 5190-1:** Due to lack of Foundation interest, further information on this anomaly is not available.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5189]]] | SCP-5190 | [[[SCP-5191]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
