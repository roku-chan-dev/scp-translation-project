Items recovered from said manifestations are to be archived in Low-Yield Storage Facility 1 at [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]. Affected individuals are to be amnesticized.\n \nKappa-43 is to attempt all means at its disposal to occupy SCP-5379 during its brief manifestation periods. Until such time as this is achieved, or GoI-5889 is neutralized, it will remain uncontained.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5379 is \"VK Technical Media Solutions,\" a photography and film stock storefront operated by [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub Vikander-Kneed Technical Media] (GoI-5889). SCP-5379 appears seemingly at random within existing storefronts, displacing their original occupants to parts unknown for the duration of its manifestation. SCP-5379 functions as a typical facility of its kind, offering a variety of blank film to its customers and also offering film development and tape transfer services. However, anything recorded on film purchased from SCP-5379 is dramatically altered, frequently in ways which should not be possible. Examples include:\n\n* Uncropped photographs;\n* Untrimmed film;\n* The inclusion of new media elements of unclear provenance;\n* The inclusion of references to information known only to the owner;\n* The substitution of entirely new pieces of media.\n[[div]]\nPersonnel employed at the displaced facilities are left with hazy recollections of \"a vacation\" to explain their disappearance; mnestic treatment has recovered only partial, apparently true memories of attending a corporate training retreat during their absence with the theme of \"Keeping Your Premises Actually Yours in the Future.\" While participants are unable to recall the curricula of this retreat, it is apparently effective, as no storefront has been co-opted by SCP-5379 more than once.\n\nSCP-5379 only alters the interior of the structures it occupies, and its manifestation is therefore exceedingly difficult to track. Foundation operatives typically only become aware of manifestations when the items they produce result in attempted law enforcement action. In every case, SCP-5379 has disappeared before such action can be taken, and well before Foundation operatives can gain access.\n\nSCP-5379 engages in periodic memetically-effective advertising campaigns to promote its services, as seen in the flyer depicted above and the commercial transcribed below.\n\n**Addendum 5379-1, Discovery and Instance Log:** On 05/18/1979, the following television commercial was broadcast on all commercial stations in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//A haze of orange and yellow, presumably smeared on the film negative, swims across the screen. The scene appears to be the back rooms of a butcher shop; a large piece of unidentifiable meat hangs from a hook suspended from the ceiling. A man in a t-shirt is visible in a mirror on the wall, seated on a toilet. He breathes deeply and speaks in a monotone. He does not look into the camera.//\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5379/Orientation.jpg|\n    caption=VK Technical Media Solutions commercial.|\n    width=500px|\n    align=center|\n]]\n\n**Man:** I don't even know.\n\n//Five seconds of silence.//\n\n**Man:** Take my wife.\n\n**Man:** VK Technical Media Solutions.\n\n**Man:** All your film needs.\n\n//Three seconds of sobbing in the background, abruptly cut off.//\n\n**Man:** Fishing with the boys.

Forensic personnel confirmed that the photographs had been developed directly from the negatives, which nevertheless do not feature the accompanying scrawl.\n\nThe forensic examiners were pressed by Foundation agents to reverse their conclusions under duress, then amnesticized. A notice was placed in local newspapers correcting the earlier police report and confirming that an act of vandalism had taken place.\n\nThe executor withdrew his complaint, and his amnesticization was deemed unnecessary. The incident was investigated and logged, but as anomalous interference could not be confirmed, no subsequent action was taken.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nThe SCP-5379 file was officially opened after the discovery of the next instance of altered media, whose anomalous nature was irrefutable.

Walker's best man is similarly engaged in extramarital acts. Upon reviewing the film, Walker's wife attacked him with a wine bottle and several fireplace implements before a family friend convinced her to leave the house. The couple have since divorced.\n\nNo police report was filed, but an anonymous informant telephoned Site-43 to connect the event to SCP-5379.

It had no producer, no hotel room scene, and no sex scene.\n\nBedfield checked himself into a mental health facility after reviewing the altered film; embedded Foundation operatives amnesticized him. A notice was placed in the local newspapers on behalf of the local film community, wishing him well and attributing his breakdown to stress and overwork.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n**Addendum 5379-2, Incident Report:** On 07/02/1979 the Director of Site-43, Dr. V.L. Scout, received a redline telephone call from a man claiming to be privy to sensitive information about both GoI-5889 and the SCP Foundation. Agents detained Little Rock resident Dr. Allan J. McInnis at Site-73 in Texas, and Dr. Scout traveled from Canada to question him. A partial transcript of their conversation can be found below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 07/02/1979\n\n**Investigating Agent:** Site Director Dr. V.L. Scout\n\n----\n\n//[Excerpt begins.]//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Forgive the cliché, but you're obviously not from around here.\n\n**McInnis:** Clichés are the building blocks of communication, doctor. But yes, I'm from England. My people are from England. Most of us stayed there, but a few left for Canada and one, only one, left for America. My uncle, Morris Brown.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** The recently-deceased Morris Brown. Is that why you're here?\n\n**McInnis:** Yes. You mentioned clichés? I received a letter from a lawyer a few months back, stating that I had been appointed the executor of my uncle's estate.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** That's how you discovered the photographs.\n\n**McInnis:** Quite so. I knew there was something wrong the instant I saw them. My uncle couldn't have scribbled those notes.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** You two were close?\n\n**McInnis:** I'd never met the man.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Then how...?\n\n**McInnis:** I met his //house.// It was immaculate. Spotless. Everything in its place. He wasn't the sort to drive invective into a photograph, is my point here. He was the sort, if my parents are to believed, to let it fester in his heart until no-one could stand to share a room with him. He was also a diarist, and I had copious examples of his handwriting to compare with that angry scrawl. It //was// his hand, but it wasn't his... style.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** So, you suspected vandalism.\n\n**McInnis:** No.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** No? It's what you told the police.\n\n**McInnis:** There were no signs of forced entry, and as I said, the house was in order. I filed the incident away for later.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** You have a very orderly mind.\n\n**McInnis:** Thank you. In any case, my uncle had also left behind a roll of blank camera film and a few blank video cassette tapes, all VKTM-branded. I decided I would use the film, in my uncle's camera, to document his possessions as his executor.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Oh.\n\n**McInnis:** Yes. I'll spare you all the gory details, but one example should suffice. When I had the film developed, the photograph I'd taken of a lovely wicker basket my mother had once made for my uncle was covered with a few choice sentences in my own neat handwriting: \"Mother loved him better. Father never knew.\"\n\n**Dr. Scout:** ...well. Ah, this is going to be a delicate—\n\n**McInnis:** I'd had my suspicions. There was a reason my uncle moved to America, and families talk. I naturally developed — no pun intended — the hypothesis that the film carried anomalous properties.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** ...you //do// have an orderly mind.\n\n**McInnis:** It was the only sensible conclusion. I did want to know if the police had seen any other evidence of this paranormal activity, so I submitted the photograph to them as evidence of vandalism. I was astonished at how quickly what should have been a shocking story was swallowed up by red tape. I take it that was your doing?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** No comment.\n\n**McInnis:** It was your doing. I assumed I was being watched, so I quietly dropped the matter and returned to work.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** The inventory.\n\n**McInnis:** No, actual work. My uncle left precious little money behind, and I needed to get a job. My background is in communications, you understand, so I attached myself to a local public relations firm connected with film and television productions.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** For no reason specifically, I'm sure.\n\n**McInnis:** I'll admit I was hoping to have my suspicions confirmed, but I was surprised how easily it happened. Within a week I'd met a local affiliate who had run that absurd commercial without remembering ever agreeing to it, and a filmmaker who claimed his amateur film had been somehow vandalized by his tape recorder. I was fascinated.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Not afraid?\n\n**McInnis:** I fear mundanity, not absurdity. Now, in my time at the firm I'd befriended a fellow HR specialist, a woman named Sarah Walker. She was married to a truly boorish idiot... I'm sure you know his name.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** I'm beginning to think I know it thanks to //you.//\n\n**McInnis:** Quite so. I knew enough about this... magical? Media, to imagine that if I loaned the boor one of my uncle's VKTM tapes, and asked him to record his wedding video onto it for me...\n\n**Dr. Scout:** You used him as an experiment.\n\n**McInnis:** It couldn't have happened to a nicer man, I assure you. He made that video tape, and played it back for his wife and I to make sure it was working correctly... I'm glad I was there. I'd made //sure// to be there. She very nearly killed him. At any rate, I called you up to make sure you noticed. Thought you could use the help.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** None of this explains how you got our number.\n\n**McInnis:** Ah, well. The second round of commercials came on the television set one day, and I decided to avail myself of the service on offer. I found the local VKTM store, and purchased...\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Yes?\n\n**McInnis:** I told you I suspected I was being watched? I'm a newspaper reader, Dr. Scout, and I saw those pieces you posted on behalf of Mr. Bedfield. Having heard the real story from the man himself, I knew it was you, whoever you were, and not him. So I cut one of them out, and I took it to the VKTM store, and I asked them to blow it up to poster size for me.\n\n//Dr. Scout nods, and gestures at a large cardboard tube on the table.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** The agents who brought you in said you were carrying this. May I?\n\n**McInnis:** Please.\n\n//Dr. Scout pulls out the poster, and lays it on the table. He reads it carefully, then considers it for a moment.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Can you break your contract with the PR firm, by any chance?\n\n//[Excerpt ends]//\n[[/div]]\n\nThe poster contained the Item Number, Object Class, Special Containment Procedures and Description for SCP-5379, including the telephone number and code phrase required to reach MTF Kappa-43 in the case of a sudden manifestation of an SCP-5379 location. (This information was subsequently removed from the file.) It also contained the number of Dr. Scout's redline telephone, which had not been included in SCP-5379's documentation.\n\n**Addendum 5379-3, Attempted Observation:** On 07/03/1979, Dr. Scout offered Dr. McInnis a position at the SCP Foundation if he would assist in the continued surveillance of GoI-5889. Dr. McInnis agreed to these terms, and underwent extensive training over the following three weeks at Site-73. In the meantime, Dr. Scout monitored communications in Little Rock for a recurrence of the SCP-5379 phenomenon. When a third round of commercials was finally aired, Dr. McInnis was summoned back to Little Rock; he was sent to the new VKTM store on 07/28/1979 and instructed to purchase as many different varieties of media as could be found on offer.\n\nWhen Dr. McInnis arrived, however, he found the store completely empty save for a single VHS tape sitting on the reception counter. A complete transcript of the tape's contents follows.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Waves of sharp white smoke are radiating off the motionless figure of a man standing in a tiled shower stall.

The stores have periodically re-manifested, always in a new urban location, always with a new topical focus and advertising slogan. Examples have included \"You earned your trust fund!\" (New York City, New York), \"Go ahead, say it anyway!\" (Boston, Massachusetts) and \"Slogans are a valid substitute for morality!\" (Las Vegas, Nevada).\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[/scp-5281 SCP-5281-D]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[SCP-5734]]]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5378]]] | SCP-5379 | [[[SCP-5380]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=HarryBlank]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 5379.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Album.jpg\n> **Name:** Old Family Photo\n> **Author:** Lee Cannon\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/leecannon/5694023539 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Walker.jpg\n> **Name:** kissing\n> **Author:** kainr\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/8e291152-e336-45c6-a056-cd12e22f1264 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Bedfield1.jpg\n> **Name:** Sunny face \n> **Author:** pedrosimoes7\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/a1b5e3ae-a6e2-4020-81ca-0e1ed11a89f5 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Bedfield2.jpg\n> **Name:** A woman with personnality\n> **Author:** pedrosimoes7\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/8222f483-b5dd-4175-8307-a3d26d021f5d flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Orientation.jpg\n> **Name:** Man in the Mirror\n> **Author:** Georgie Pauwels\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/ba356aa3-a1cc-4d27-a0ff-22439a288f8f flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Response.jpg\n> **Name:** Showering\n> **Author:** Silke Remmery\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/silkeremmery/15952923171 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** VKTMS.jpg\n> **Name:** Camera Store Mannequin\n> **Author:** Phillip Pessar\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/southbeachcars/9358507980 flickr]\n\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
