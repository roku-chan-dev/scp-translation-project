All associated commercial products are to be discontinued and physical copies must be destroyed.[[footnote]]Some digital and physical copies may be exempt from the destruction for archival purposes.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-5864 must be kept in a humanoid containment cell at Site-17, furnished and decorated in accordance with its accommodations depicted in //The Adventures of the Esteemed Sir Reginald.//[[footnote]] A children's television show that aired its first episode on 14-11-1986.[[/footnote]]\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-5864 is the designation for a male humanoid, manifested as a result of an ontokinetic event. The manifestation is correlated with humanityâ€™s collective memetic belief concerning the fictional entity.\n\nSCP-5864's features are identical to a character named \"Sir Reginald\" in the children's show //The Adventures of the Esteemed Sir Reginald//, and to the description of the character on the show's official Wiki before it was taken down. SCP-5864 is of English and Scottish descent and in its mid-thirties. SCP-5864 is 185 cm tall and weighs 83 kg, with brown eyes and hair. The entity manifested wearing a bowler hat, trench coat, and attire similar to formal wear worn in London, c. 1890s.\n\nSCP-5864 exhibits mannerisms similar to a resident of 1890s London, but speaks perfect modern English, along with 28 other languages.[[footnote]]The languages it has shown proficiency in are the same as the different translations that its show airs.[[/footnote]] SCP-5864 is diagnosed with multiple mental disorders, often experiencing delusions, hallucinations, mental breakdowns, and mood swings. Whilst SCP-5864 is normally amicable and cooperative with the Foundation, it has occasionally exhibited aggressive behavior towards personnel.\n\nSCP-5864 has exhibited anomalous deductive and observational skills, able to come to logical conclusions based on seemingly unconnected pieces of evidence. SCP-5864 has shown its mental acuity by escaping containment on numerous occasions but has always been subsequently captured without conflict. \n\n------\n\n**Discovery and Containment:** SCP-5864 was discovered wandering a residential area in Cary, North Carolina by local law enforcement; it was subsequently detained within the local police station for questioning under suspicion of performing illegal activities. During the interview a police officer addressed SCP-5864 as its alias in //The Adventures of the Esteemed Sir Reginald//, resulting in a mental breakdown and attempted escape. SCP-5864 was later moved to a mental hospital for assessment. The entity escaped captivity into a nearby metropolitan area, where it was later found. After an investigation of the hospital and police station's records, SCP-5864 was transferred into Foundation custody and given an entry due to its anomalous deductive and observational skills. \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:4px; margin-bottom: 7px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n\nAs of 13-1-1990, SCP-5864's Special Containment Procedures and Description are out of date.

The following are excerpts from its journals.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**18-12-1989**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Who// am I? //Where// am I? \n\nIt was as if a million voices called to me from the primordial void, urging me to materialize into existence. The cacophony of a trillion trillion voices whispering, //Exist, exist, exist// was deafening, all-encompassing. A million hands grasped at my mind, pulling it in seemingly infinite directions. My mind warped, manipulated by those millions of invisible fingers as if they were shaping clay into a finite form. The mist, billowing out from this center of infinite darkness, coalesced into a single thought. \n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\nThe last thing I remember was darkness, and then some uniformed fellow forced me into his vehicle, and drove me to a blank, white room, devoid of any and all decoration. \n\nHe asked me some questions from across the table we were seated at, and I answered to the [Unintelligible scribbles]- asked me my name, and for the life of me I couldn't quite recall. He then mention //that// name. Why did he have to say //that// name, the name to name all names? It was as if he had hit a chord through my body, reverberating, as the world converged upon my mortal form, sitting ever so quietly in that office chair. Many images and memories seemed to flash before my eyes. How did he know //that// name, of all names? How could he have known? \n\nHow could I have known?\n _\n _\n[Unintelligible scribbling]\n\nThe uniformed man then brought me to another white room [Unintelligible scribbles]- explained to me that this was where I was to stay. I saw the dark glass that didn't quite conceal the glint of the camera lenses, the metal bars on the windows, and the various armed people on the way to my \"room\", and somehow knew that this was a prison.\n\nI could tell where the prison's cameras couldn't see by looking at the angles they were poised in, where the men weren't stationed from the dust on the floor, where the doors weren't locked from the state of the handles. I made a map of the building in my mind and planned my great escape at midnight.\n\n-and swiftly set off on the road to the nearest settlement, which direction I could discern from the state of the road I walked upon. I passed through the town, marveling at the world I found myself in.   It was in that moment where I saw //it//. I saw a strange mockery of me, looking back through a television screen. He, no //I//, was talking to someone. I was asking if a certain Samuel could hand him a magnifying glass. Samuel? Yes, I know a Samuel! Or was it //him// that knew a Samuel? \n\n//Who// am I?\n\nOn this day, November 14th, may it be known that my assistant, Samuel, has saved my life once again. I was investigating a murder when a lone assassin snuck up behind me. He was armed with a revolver, which surely would have been fatal at close range if not for my loyal assistant tackling me to the ground, thereby saving me from a grievous wound. We quickly apprehended the assassin, who turns out to have been hired by-\n\n[Words are scribbled over]\n\n//Who// am I?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**20-12-1989**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOh god, the voices!

I remember! \n\n[Unintelligible scribbling]\n\n//Mr. Hiri! The audacity!// I hadn't heard from him in years, until suddenly one day, he demanded I meet him in a back alley in Piccadilly, where he promptly asked me to join his crime syndicate. I had refused of course, but I should have known he would have sent a hitman after me!\n\nWhy was I having flashbacks? Why am I remembering //his// memories? Or are they mine? \n\n//Who// am I?\n\nA doctor, Dr. Kannan, entered my cell and asked me a couple of questions, such as who I was. I wasn't sure if even //I// knew who I was, so I told him that. He asked me a couple more questions, but I didn't know the answers to any of them. \n\nHe then explained to me where I was. He told me that he was part of an organization called the \"Foundation\" and that they were tasked with containing the strange and the dangerous. \n\n[Words are crossed out and smudged]\n\nLater that day, Dr. Kannan entered my cell again and asked me to take multiple tests, to which I refused. What did they expect? I refuse to indulge my jailers.  \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**I want to be back-1989**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[Unintelligible scribbling]\n\nI want to be back\n\n--I first met Samuel when I w@@-@@--\n\n--The doctor came back in m@@-@@--\n\n--That bastard!

They whisper incessantly, an orchestra of shrills and yells and warbles. They talk on and on and on. They tell me all sorts of things, that I made their childhood, that I was their hero, that they always wanted to be like me. It is so exasperating, yet it may be the only thing that kept me sane. It keeps me anchored, helps keep me in this world and not the next. \n\nAnd yet there is this one voice, from the darkest crack in my mind, crooning dark thoughts. //You are beneath us. You are not human.// It whispers, slowly, as it poisons my mind and the mind of others. Whenever I close my eyes, I can almost see the voice's dark tendrils, worming their way into every part of me. I am afraid it will not rest until I am a broken man. \n\nThe dark voice grows louder when the doctors come near me. I do not think I can endure it for much longer. The doctors ask me to take a test, //Abomination!//, the voice shrieks. Once you are told something for long enough, you find it harder to //not// believe it. Maybe they are right? I- I do not know. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**9-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nMaybe he is right. \n\nWhat should I do?\n\nWhat would //I// do?\n\nWho am I to say?\n\nHow do I know what I shall do, when I do not even know who I am? \n\n**//What would he do?//**\n\n**Can I even call myself him?**\n\n**//Does that matter?

Prey can escape even the stealthiest predator if the predator steps on a single leaf, and the Foundation were not stealthy predators by any means. They searched for me like bumbling idiots, making such a ruckus that a man both blind and deaf could have sensed them coming from a mile away.\n\nFor all their advanced technologies, for all of their big men with big guns, they failed to notice the little details, little details a detective is trained to recognize. They know no subtlety - and hence I remained undetected.\n\nBut for all of my clever little tricks, all of the times I hid in plain sight, I keep on coming back to the same thought. \n\nI am lost. I do not know what to do. \n\nI was never given an identity in the show. I was never allowed to grow organically, to progress, my entire being was altered at the whim of the high and mighty gods, the lords of all creation. I never got to choose, it was always, \"go over there, you have to say this, you have to do this.\" Now I am given a chance to choose, yet I cannot. How can I know what I want when I do not know what rules I have to follow? I do not know who I am, how do I abide by my personality when I make decisions, follow my own identity? \n\nI am standing at a great crossroads, both paths stretching towards the ends of the Earth, yet I am unable to stick a foot forwards, and take that first step. \n\nWhy me?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**12-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nI had a close call today. I was getting too cocky, overconfident that those fools could never catch me. The Foundation has some sort of advanced scanning system, and I had forgotten the vast array of technology they had at their disposal. Luckily, my quick thinking led me to dive into a ditch. They came over, almost within a foot of where I was lying, but they quickly resumed their search as I had carefully concealed myself. They must have thought it was a malfunction. The fools and their short attention spans! I shall be more careful in the future. \n\nAs they passed over me, I heard one of them talk about an \"anti-memetic agent.\" Scientists and their vocabulary! The term must be important, so I will have to figure out what it means soon enough. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**14-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nJust as the voices reached an almost staggering crescendo, they stopped. In an instance, the millions upon millions of whispers simply vanished, purged from my mind. I do not know whether to be elated or concerned. The voices were bewilderingly loud, yes, but they kept me anchored to this world. They were the only constant in my ever-changing situation, and now they are gone, forever lost to the void. \n\nI do not know what their silence means. \n\nThe silence is deafening, all-knowing, all-present. \n\nI feel as if the silence had rent a piece from my chest. In the absence of the voices, I feel empty. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**15-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nI do not know what drives me to keep going. Maybe I do not want to keep going, yet here I am, writing on these pages I keep in my coat.\n\nI arrived on the outskirts of a large city early in the morning, with buildings embracing heaven's grasp, so tall that I could not see their tops. I knew that the Foundation would find me easier in the city, yet something strange drew me into the city, to her people. //I// would be in there. \n\nI looked through each and every window, so desperately yearning to catch a glimpse of that show. He would have answers for me. As daylight waned, I searched in vain for even a glimpse of him. \n\nIn a panic, I grabbed a passerby and shook him, asking him where I could find him, where I could find Sir Reginald. He looked confused and told me that he had never heard of a \"fellow named Sir Reginald.\" \n\nIt hit me then.\n\nThe silence, the deafening silence. The world had forgotten him. The Foundation had wiped all knowledge of him off the face of the Earth. \n\nWhat does that make me then? The last vestige of an idea, forever lost?  He- He would have had answers for me. Now- Now I do not know what to do. \n\nI am lost, finally alone. Lost lost lost\n\n[Unintelligible scribbling]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**16-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nI could see the light at the end of the tunnel, so tantalizing close, the hope for a better future. I could see his hand, outstretched, reaching for mine. Straining, I extended my arm, yearning to be saved from this madness. In all of my giddy foolishness, I thought that this nightmare would be over. \n\nThe hand is gone now gone. It is all gone. Swallowed by this cruel, uncaring world. And I am alone, in this endless tunnel, with no way out. No way out.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**18-1-1990**\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nThe last couple of days have been a blur. I am lost, and yet I still continue. I continue to evade the cameras, the drones, the men. It is almost instinctual, as if I have been on the run my entire life, and perhaps I have.\n\nIt was during one of the moments when I was carefully traversing out of sight of a patrol team when the voices came back. At first, I was ecstatic, shocked even. Maybe the Foundation had not been as successful as I once thought when they wiped him from existence, but I later recognized those poisonous whispers, louder than ever, spoken with even more vehemence and malice. //You are an abomination. You are beneath us. You are//-\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Ward Park Footage\" hide=\"- Close Ward Park Footage\"]]\n\nThe following footage was retrieved from a security camera located in Ward Park, Chicago. \n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 16-1-1990\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #888;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Footage shows a park, near dusk.
