Some constantly evade capture, some can outsmart even the smartest at the Foundation, and others can't be contained for legal, moral, or logistical reasons. Many of these individuals are given the Person of Interest designation.\n\nPersons of Interest (or PoIs) are individuals who are related to the anomalous in some way or another. PoIs can be important members of GoIs, creators of the anomalous, or anomalous in their own right. No matter the nature of their relation, in all cases they have done something to warrant the attention of the Foundation. Many of them are under constant surveillance or face constant threats of containment.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n+++++ This is an open, collaborative project. If you discover a Person of Interest which is absent or has been improperly catalogued, feel free to add it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n+ HOW TO CONTRIBUTE\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SHOW INSTRUCTIONS\" hide=\"HIDE INSTRUCTIONS\"]]\nSo, you wanna add to this page?\n\nGood! There's no automatic way of updating this page, so the more people who add to it the better. That way, we have a better chance of covering everything and leaving no stone unturned! But, how does a PoI qualify for addition to this page? Well,\n\n* **The Person of Interest has appeared in at least one successful article.**\n* **The Person of Interest has explicitly been referred to as one.**\n\nAnd that's it! Basically, if it exists on one or more articles with a rating above 0, you can add it here. Now that we know which PoIs can and can't be added here, how do we actually add them in?\n----\n+++ Adding New PoIs\n\nFirst, find where it fits in both lists. Including your entry in both lists is very important, as it makes searching for a specific PoI a whole lot easier.\n\nThen inject this code:\n[[code]]\n|| [DESIGNATION(S)] || [OTHER NAMES] || [DESCRIPTION] || [APPEARANCES] ||\n[[/code]]\n\nFor appearances, there is no limit to how many you may add. However, I ask that you try to prioritize a PoI's more major appearances. **The only exception to this is PoIs with their own tag or hub.** If they have a tag/hub, just link that for Appearances.\n\nIf you see any characters that lack a description and you think you can make a good one for them, add it! However, I ask that you keep descriptions short. 1-2 sentences at most.\n\nIf you make any changes to this page, make sure to leave a summary of them in the \"Short description of changes\" section in the edit screen!\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n+++ Related Pages\n\nThere are other pages on the Wiki just like this one.
