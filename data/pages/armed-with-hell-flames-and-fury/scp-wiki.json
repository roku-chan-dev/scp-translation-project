The offenders took its employees hostage and initiated a live broadcast on television and various social media platforms. During this broadcast, the assailants identified themselves as members of the Chaos Insurgency movement, admitting to [[[dark-sushi-file-no-120|intentionally causing the events described in Casefile #13/04/2039-B]]] -- the uncontrolled local proliferation of thaumaturgic abilities -- and outlining their demands and motivations (see below).\n\nDue to the chaos caused by Casefile #13/04/2039-B events, local law enforcement and Division forces were unable to respond effectively in time. The transmission of the broadcast was not effectively blocked until 22:21, although copies of it had already surfaced online and had been covered by various media organizations, spreading it further.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[table class=\"monologue\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n+++ __ATTACHED A/V FOOTAGE__\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n\n{{**>> RECORDING STARTS <<**}}\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nThe footage depicts three individuals wearing balaclavas inside one of the rooms in the unVeiled building. The recording is visibly improvised. Two of them are standing in the back, next to a flag depicting the Chaos Insurgency emblem on a black background, holding assault rifles, while one [[span class=\"bt\"]] UNKNOWN MAN [[/span]] in front is sitting at a table holding a piece of paper in his hands.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] People of Silesia, rejoice! Today marks the day of your liberation from the oppressive clutches of the Polish government. The Chaos Insurgency, a global bastion of resistance against threats to our existence, now empowers you to rise against the neglect and corruption of the so-called Central Committee for the Betterment of Silesia.\n\nWith the seizing of this building, we declare the liberation of Silesia. As the dust settles from the chaos unleashed through the thaumaturgical abilities granted by us, a new era of freedom begins. We, as the true representatives of the will of the entire Silesian population, demand an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the Polish government from these territories.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nThe [[span class=\"bt\"]] UNKNOWN MAN [[/span]] stops for a moment, swiftly turns the page, and continues his monologue, gesticulating heavily while speaking.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] To those who may doubt our intentions, allow us to share with you the proud origins of our movement.\n\nOur cause began with an event that would later be known as the Foundation Civil War -- a pivotal moment, when part of the former Foundation's staff decided to rebel against the corrupt power of its Overseers. We were fueled by the Foundation betraying its ideals, failing to prevent the horrors of both the Second World War and the Seventh Occult War. We have witnessed the Overseers betray the Foundation's core mission from their ivory tower -- to contain the proliferation of forces hostile to humanity, lurking in the darkness.\n\nAs the most dedicated [[[carroll-022-the-last-stand|soldiers of the Foundation's cause]]], we could not stand idly by, watching as traitors and incompetent Overseers dismantle everything we have built, all under the guise of their so-called [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Directive Alpha/1911]]].\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nAnother pause and turn of the page follows, after which the [[span class=\"bt\"]] UNKNOWN MAN [[/span]] continues in a dramatic tone.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] Yet, the blind servants of the Overseers pushed us away. The 108-Headed Cosmopolitan Hydra mocked us when we asked for help.\n\nBut we persevered, despite our exile from the Foundation, armed with the knowledge of our predecessors' mistakes. We proudly embraced the mocking name that the true traitors gave us, becoming the real insurgency against the chaos the Overseers wanted to bring upon the world. As the only legitimate heirs to the Foundation's original mission, we were ready to create logic out of illogic and enlighten ourselves and everyone else with the knowledge that they had previously rejected.\n\nWe were no longer mere observers; we became soldiers in the battle against the forces that prevented humanity from continuing to evolve. Ready to reach the future and ensure that humanity would never again have to cower in fear of the unknown by using everything in an uncompromising fight against it. Armed with unwavering determination, we stand ready to claim our rightful place as masters over the natural and unnatural world.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nHe pauses, quickly turns the page, and proceeds in a more sorrowful tone, still gesticulating heavily.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] In the end, we could only watch as the Foundation completely betrayed the ideas on which it was built, [[[hour-zero|transforming itself into Vanguard]]]. Our worst fears have come true. The Foundation, once humanity's last bastion of safety, abandoned its original mission, just as we had predicted when we first rebelled against it. The organization that was once founded with the intent to protect humanity had now sold out its subjects for little more than cancerous tissue.\n\nThe Foundation's corruption has finally devoured itself, dismantling the very natural order it once created to secure humanity's stability under the mask of so-called progress. Having utterly renounced its original purpose, this new so-called Vanguard has now fully embraced its new role as an emissary of unrestrained chaos.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nThe [[span class=\"bt\"]] UNKNOWN MAN [[/span]] proceeds to turn the page, after which he slaps the table, continuing his monologue in a louder and more dramatic tone.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] Yet, this betrayal has only strengthened us, drawing a wave of new recruits who have seen firsthand the hypocrisy of the Foundation. These individuals, who once swore to uphold the Foundation's mission, now saw years of manipulation at its hands. \n\nAs Newton once said, every action has a reaction. Our movement has experienced a rebirth. We have become a bastion for those who oppose the machinations of Vanguard's agenda, which, by seeking to normalize abnormalities, threatens to push humanity into the depths of darkness that we have once overcome.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nAs he continues reading, his tone gets increasingly louder, almost shouting; the [[span class=\"bt\"]] UNKNOWN MAN [[/span]] gets up, and the insurgents behind him stand at full attention with their rifles raised. He continues his speech from a standing position.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"zm comment\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt bb\"]] UNKNOWN [[/span]] It is us, and only us, who can accelerate humanity toward the future. We are the force standing against this onslaught, determined to secure humanity's survival, assert our supremacy, and protect the traditional values of our civilization. The onslaught that continues today as the Polish government pushes its oppression onto free men. Don't be fooled, good people -- though this cancer, this regime calls itself independent, it is merely an extension of the disease that plagues our world. The disease that began with Vanguard and spread beyond its borders.\n\nToday marks the culmination of our efforts -- a great awakening for the world. In this moment, I assume the position of the New Engineer and the leader of the provisional military government. Our aim will be to ensure the existence of the Free State of Silesia by any means necessary, created based on the ideas combining the national interest of the Silesian people with the ideals of the Chaos Insurgency. Today is the day of your liberation, a day of freedom from the dictates of globalist powers and government tax oppression. Today we stand, in the first country that is free from outside influence!\n\nThe Silesian Uprisings of the 20th century were not enough; you were merely handed over from the Germans to the Poles. In many ways, we see ourselves in you. Just like you, we are a lost people looking for its home against the opressive tides of hegemony. Therefore, we promise you a free, prosperous, and sovereign Silesia -- so use your newly gained thaumic abilities and fight for it. Our forces will soon begin to establish a new government throughout Silesia -- one that will not answer to any satanist occultist lobby or Vanguard's agendas!\n\nExpect further announcements in the coming days.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"background-text\"]]\nThe footage no longer shows the room, transitioning to a black flag with the Insurgency emblem and the text [[span class=\"tb\"]] SILESIA FREE STATE [[/span]] at the top and [[span class=\"tb\"]] SHOULD INTERMITTED VENGEANCE ARM AGAIN HIS RED RIGHT HAND TO PLAGUE US?

She was dressed elegantly, wearing minimalist glasses, and her face bore an expression of intense focus. The neoclassical building she was walking through, with its nearly four hundred year old history, had witnessed many political crises, wars, and conflicts. \n\nNow, it was about to experience yet another one.\n\nShe passed through the Column Hall, where media briefings were usually held, and stepped into the golden //antichambre//. As she approached the secretariat's doors, the two soldiers on guard snapped to attention. It was clear the president didn't want any unwelcome visitors, but she wasn't one of them. Without even acknowledging their presence, she just hurried into the next room.\n\nInside, an older woman, visibly overwhelmed by the current situation, nervously shuffled papers from one pile to another, trying to appear busy. It was a feeble act of desperation that the woman saw through immediately. On the side of the wooden desk, a phone rang incessantly; it was ignored deliberately. Its repetitive sound filled the room, only adding to the already tense atmosphere.\n\nHaving noticed the guest, the secretary suddenly stood up, abandoning her task. She mumbled uncertainly, \"The p-president is waiting for you in his o-offic--\"\n\nShe didn't let her finish. Without a word, she simply walked straight into the president's office. In the current situation, there was no time for unnecessary formalities. The room was decorated in beige with gilded ornaments, and the walls featured many paintings by renowned Polish artists.\n\nAs the prime minister fully entered the cabinet, she immediately spotted President Paweł Kozioł standing by the window, shockingly collected considering what was transpiring. The president, around sixty years old, had a stout belly and a head as bald as the shining surface of his wooden desk.\n\nShe cleared her throat. \"Good afternoon, Mr. President. I've just returned from the emergency staff briefing, and I assume you are probably already aware of the current... situation and this declaration,\" the prime minister said with visible concern in her voice as she stood by the door, waiting for his response.\n\nThe president took a final glance out the window before turning to face her.\n\n\"I'm glad you're finally here, Lucy. The Coalition's been calling me all day, and I'm not giving up to no filthy UN bureaucrats. I need //our// people on this.\"\n\n\"Our forces have been pushed out of Katowice and are currently awaiting orders. We have cut off their transmissions, but the media has already picked up the story...\"\n\nThe man turned toward his desk with an ambiguous expression on his face.\n\n\"Well, the situation in the parliament and polls doesn't look promising. And you know how things are with the upcoming election...\"\n\nLucy was perfectly aware of their current political landscape. Following the [[[the-liberal-vampire|decline of the conservatives after the fall of the Veil]]], the liberals enjoyed uncontested rule for the next decade. But in the 2035 presidential elections, Kozioł and his populist Polish Party of Honesty managed to turn the tide, capitalizing on the social issues neglected by the previous government. However, only a few years later, their grip on power was slipping, with the opposition quickly catching up.\n\n\"...and we need some //rallying point// for the public and the politicians--\"\n\n\"Maybe even some //show of strength//,\" Lucy interrupted, guessing where Kozioł was heading before he could even finish his sentence.\n\nHe snapped his fingers. \"Exactly.\"\n\nLucy had a suspicion of what exactly President Kozioł intended to do, but didn't say anything. Still, the doubts lingered on in her mind.\n\n\"We've just been handed the perfect opportunity to unite the people under our cause and convince them of our leadership abilities -- if //we// will be the ones to resolve this situation, and not some UN bureaucrats or other Vanguard,\" explained Kozioł as he reached for the telephone handset on his desk. For a few seconds, he hesitated in silence, but eventually picked up the handset, pressing it against his ear. \n\n\"Basia, could you please connect me to Jadzia? Yes, I mean [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/ja-jestem-mesjaszem General Drzyzgewska]. Thank you very much.\" There was a short moment of waiting until a response came from the handset. \"General, I need you to come to my office. It's an important matter -- we'll need the Division.\"\n\nAfter concluding the call, President Kozioł hung up the handset.\n\n\"ZM? They have already failed to control the situation in Katowice. Besides -- some of their methods seem somewhat... //outdated//,\" the prime minister voiced her concerns almost immediately, with evident doubts about the effectiveness of his plan. \"I'm not sure we'll be able to control this thaumic situation, and with the lack of cooperation with the interna--\"\n\n\"Janina will handle it,\" Kozioł replied with confidence. \"She'll scatter those small riots, and within a week, the situation will be under full control. We'll show ourselves as a strong and competent government.\"\n\n\"And what if the Witch Hunters can't handle it?\" Lucy pressed.\n\nKozioł leaned back in his chair with a steady gaze.\n\n\"Lucy, I value your analytical perspective on the matter,\" Kozioł replied, sitting down in his chair with a confident expression on his face, \"but we'll double our forces and strike decisively, once and for all. The Coalition is also planning to deploy some units in the region -- despite my reservations about involving them. And in addition, we have...\"\n\nHe paused, considering his next words very carefully.\n\n\"They already proved themselves in //Królewiec//, so to be sure, I'll also call //them// in,\" President Kozioł continued, pulling a small light blue business card from the drawer of his wooden desk.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"overwatch-box argus\"]]\n[[size 190%]][[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/argus-inc-hub|A.R.G.U.S. INC.]]][[/size]]\n[[size 80%]]Autonomic Recon Group with Undefined Specialization[[/size]]\n------\n//We don't ask questions;//\n//We simply get our job done.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image chaos-insurgency-sigil_2.png class=\"scene-break\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/dark-sushi-file-no-120 | previous-title=Dark Sushi File No. 120 \"Mab Maki\"\n| next-url=/whatever | next-title=COMING SOON\n| hub-url=/all-eyes-on-silesia-hub | hub-title=All Eyes on Silesia\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"footing\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span id=\"fade-away\"]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/span]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Jasiu06 and Zygard]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** chaos-insurgency-sigil-1.png/chaos-insurgency-sigil-2.png\n> **Name:** CIbig.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/meanwhile-in-australia SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Additional Notes:** Edited by [[*user Jasiu06]]\n\n> **Filename:** ZM-1.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jasiu06]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-liberal-vampire SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> **Name:**Herb Polski.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herb_Polski.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** riots.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Protesters covered with improvised shields holding the barricade line at Grushevskogo str.
