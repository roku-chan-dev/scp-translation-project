  "content": "The trio has already noticed you snooping, you might as well ask them for some information about the department. They pretend to not notice you as you walk over to them, but it’s fairly obvious. You walk up to them and, trying to be as polite and friendly as possible, ask what it is they do in the Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation of Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs. The trio all stop what they’re doing and, glancing between each other and then at you, answer almost simultaneously.\n\n“We deal with Explained SCPs,” says the first.\n“We deal with Neutralized SCPs,” says the second.\n“We deal with Decommissioned SCPs,” says the third, who then tosses you a crumpled up piece of paper. You catch it, but before you can ask anymore questions, the trio have erupted into an argument about what category of SCP they actually deal with. Since it seems you won’t be able to ask any more questions, you uncrumple the piece of paper that was thrown to you. It looks like a crude drawing of some double doors with a stop sign sketched on top of them. Before you can begin to puzzle out what that could mean, you feel a tap on your shoulder, and turn around to see Greg holding your clipboard. “Here,” he says, handing it to you. You thank him in a somewhat worried voice and then look through the data he’s written in. It all looks fairly normal: A large amount spent on paper and ink (no surprise there), a moderate amount spent on instant coffee (more than they should, just like every other department in the Foundation), a request for funds going toward better computers and scanners (we’ll see), and…\n\nUpkeep costs for 8 Scranton Reality Anchors? So far you haven’t seen anything in this department that would require a single Reality Anchor, let alone 8. The thought that someone might be embezzling those funds crosses your mind, which would be completely unacceptable for any Foundation department! Then again, this seems to be a strange department, and you can always just note that oddity in your auditing report. They may get investigated by the Auditing Department for it anyways. You could just leave and be done with it, or you could try to interrupt the loud argument behind you and ask. You decide to…\n\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/14 Leave without asking about the Reality Anchors.]||= 13||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/15 Ask about the Reality Anchors.]||\n\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _",
