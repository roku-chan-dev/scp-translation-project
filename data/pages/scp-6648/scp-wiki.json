Level 4 or higher clearance is required to access all research materials regarding SCP-6648. Only the selected team of researchers appointed by O5 command are allowed to access SCP-6648-1 and participate in the translation of text inscribed on SCP-6648-1.\n\nSCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 are not allowed in close proximity with each other under any circumstances. All Foundation personnel who directly approach SCP-6648-2 or SCP-6648-3 must always remain under civilian disguise. SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 are monitored by MTF Phi-6 (“Breakup Artists”) at all times. If SCP-6648-2 or SCP-6648-3 relocate, hidden video and audio surveillance devices must be installed within their new area of residence. To avoid triggering the reality-altering effects of SCP-6648-2 or SCP-6648-3, both entities are allowed to carry out daily activities without interference. If SCP-6648-2 or SCP-6648-3 are involved in a highly stressful or uncomfortable situation, a suitable number of MTF Phi-6 members must approach the entities with believable excuses and provide assistance.\n\nDuring the occurrence of a Rendezvous Event, MTF Phi-6 members are divided into Team 1 and Team 2 to handle SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 respectively. At least one MTF Phi-6 member must be assigned to approach the entities respectively. The assigned members must obtain the entities’ trust and attempt to participate in their journey as civilian travel partners. If the above method fails, MTF Phi-6 may request additional resources to monitor the entities. The transportation systems, lodging services and administrative procedures around or involved with SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 can be sabotaged with minimal civilian casualties to delay the travelling entities. After a Rendezvous Event concludes, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 will subconsciously begin to move away from each other, and no further interference is required. If SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 display any abnormal behaviour, especially when the entities fail to resume antipodal distance or continue to approach each other, the O5 command must be notified immediately.\n\nAll efforts to interrupt the activities of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 must be designed as reasonable coincidences or accidents, believable to both entities and the public. Amnestics are to be administered to any civilian who witnessed the anomalous effects of the entities. All digital or physical evidence regarding the anomalous effects of the entities is to be located, stopped from circulating and destroyed. All attempts to take SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 into custody are currently postponed (see Addendum 02).\n\nResearch on the possibility of specific occult organizations and rituals triggering a Rendezvous Event is ongoing.\n\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-6648 consists of three objects: an extradimensional stele designated SCP-6648-1, and two humanoid entities with reality-bending capabilities designated SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 respectively. \n\nSCP-6648-1 is a 5 m x 2 m x 18 m stele with the visual and texture characteristics of Calacatta marble. SCP-6648-1 displays an abnormally high resistance towards physical damage, chemical corrosion, and extreme temperatures. The chemical composition of SCP-6648-1 remains largely unknown; the only substances identifiable through spectral analysis are iron, selenium, calcium phosphate and silicon. Further analysis on the residuals of comet dust and cosmic radiation found on SCP-6648-1 indicates that the object originates from another dimension.\n\nThe surface of SCP-6648-1 is covered with inscriptions of ancient Celtic symbols. 65% of the text inscribed on SCP-6648-1 has been successfully translated, with many indecipherable symbols and phrases remaining (see Addendum 05). The content of the text on SCP-6648-1 revolves around SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3, referring to the two entities as \"the lovers\". However, both entities show no prior knowledge of SCP-6648-1 despite their anomalous behaviours involving SCP-6648-1.\n\nSCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 appear as humans in their twenties of inconsistent gender (often opposite to each other) and unidentifiable ethnicity. Both entities display the physical and mental capacity, sustenance consumption and daily activities similar to non-anomalous human beings of their visual age, but whether these actions are actually required for their survival remains unknown. Hume values exponentially rise above 0 near SCP-6648-2, while Hume values exponentially fall towards 0 near SCP-6648-3, despite no observable effects on their surroundings. Both SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 display neither knowledge nor control over their anomalous capabilities, as well as the inability to acknowledge any changes caused by their effects.\n\nSCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 subconsciously maintain an antipodal distance from each other, except when an anomalous event designated \"Rendezvous Event\" occurs. During a Rendezvous Event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 will be subconsciously driven to travel and meet each other at the location of SCP-6648-1. As the distance between SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 becomes shorter, a variety of temporal and spatial distortions will increasingly manifest around both entities. Things return to normal once the entities resume antipodal distance. A tolerance threshold of 20 – 30 km below the antipodal distance between SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 was recorded before anomalous phenomena began to manifest. Based on past Rendezvous Events, advanced scenario modelling predicted a ZK Class Collapse of Reality Scenario if the distance between SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 falls below 2 m.\n\nDocumented anomalous phenomena during past Rendezvous Events include:\n# Chronological gap of 2 seconds to 8 minutes between the entities’ location and the rest of the world\n# Spatial expansion and compression of roads and buildings\n# Accelerating or reversed aging process in living beings\n# Anomalous changes in state of matter (Example: water freezing at 35 °C)\n\nOutside of the Rendezvous Event, the anomalous effects of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 mainly play the role of self-defence, triggered even when the entities are unaware of the situation. When SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 are directly involved in highly stressful or uncomfortable events, or when any harm is imminent, the entities will subconsciously bend the reality around them to undo the event. All physical objects involved in the previous event will be reverted to an earlier spatio-temporal state. All living beings within the affected radius, including SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3, will lose all memories regarding the previous event, often warped to different locations within the affected radius to engage in a different activity from before without the previous event occurring again. The full process of reality-warping can still be observed and remembered by living beings or documented by equipment outside the affected radius.\n\n**Addendum 01: Discovery**\n\n[[collapsible]]\nSCP-6648-1 was first discovered on 15/08/2002 in Zagora, Morocco. Agent Amir Mustapha, a Foundation agent stationed at the local police department, reported multiple eyewitness accounts of \"a rectangular meteor burning in white flames falling into the desert\". Fifteen Foundation field agents were dispatched from Site-306 to investigate the area and discovered SCP-6648-1 at the centre of a crater measuring 20 m in diameter. Due to unknown reasons, SCP-6648-1 managed to land on Earth in a perfectly vertical orientation.\n\nSCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 were discovered 3 months after the discovery of SCP-6648-1, when multiple reports of anomalous temporal and spatial phenomena were filed in both Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria and Tauranga, New Zealand. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-5 MTF Lambda-5 (\"White Rabbits\")] was dispatched and divided into two teams to investigate the affected areas, where they discovered SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 respectively by pinpointing the location with the most unstable Hume readings. The initial attempt to take the entities into custody failed (see Addendum 02). Upon discovering more information about the entities through SCP-6648-1, MTF Phi-6 (“Breakup Artists”) was formed to handle SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 02: MTF Lambda-5 Mission Report**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Involved Unit:** [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-5 MTF Lambda-5 (\"White Rabbits\")]\n**Involved Item:** SCP-6648\n**Report Title:** Securing SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 for Containment (Attempt 1)\n**Date:** 15/11/2002\n\nDuring the initial discovery of SCP-6648-2 in Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria and SCP-6648-3 in Tauranga, New Zealand, MTF Lambda-5 divided its members into Team 1 and Team 2, in an attempt to approach the entities respectively and take them into Foundation custody.\n\nTeam 1 initiated the attempt to take SCP-6648-2 into custody, in hopes of providing reference for the later actions of Team 2. After Team 1 set up a perimeter around Hotel ███████, Agent Teal, Agent Rim and Agent Castor proceeded to Room 204 where SCP-6648-2 was residing. Agent Rim and Agent Castor took cover at nearby blind spots, while Agent Teal convinced SCP-6648-2 to open the door by claiming to be a room service cleaner. However, SCP-6648-2 immediately retreated into the room and demanded to know the true identity of Agent Teal, stating that it identified the calluses on the hands of Agent Teal as a result of firearms training. Agent Teal attempted to calm SCP-6648-2, but the entity demanded them to leave. The reality-bending effect of SCP-6648-2 was then activated, warping all three agents to an earlier spatio-temporal state right before entering Room 204. Agent Teal, Agent Rim and Agent Castor lost all memories of the previous encounter with SCP-6648-2 and entered Room 204 after getting no response from its occupant, but SCP-6648-2 was not inside. Further investigation of the area found SCP-6648-2 residing in ████ Lounge, 500 m away from Hotel ███████. The entity displayed no memory of the previous encounter with Team 1. Further plans to apprehend SCP-6648-2 were suspended, and Team 2 was informed of the situation.\n\nAfter receiving reports from Team 1, Team 2 decided to avoid direct confrontation with SCP-6648-3. After Team 2 set up a perimeter around █████ Villa, Agent Novel was stationed at an abandoned construction site 400m away with a clear view of Room 8’s balcony, where SCP-6648-3 was cooking at a makeshift kitchen. Agent Novel was armed with a sniper rifle and tranquilizer shots, and was instructed to subdue the entity without being noticed. After the rest of Team 2 reported no possible eyewitness and SCP-6648-3 showed no sign of suspicion, Agent Novel fired a single shot at the entity’s forearm. Right before the tranquilizer struck SCP-6648-3, The reality-bending effect of SCP-6648-3 activated, warping Agent Novel to an earlier spatio-temporal state right before firing the shot. SCP-6648-3 was also warped out of sight. Agent Novel lost memories of the previous encounter with SCP-6648-3, and instead began questioning Team 2 for stationing her to watch an empty balcony. Further investigation of the area revealed SCP-6648-3 residing in ████ Motel, 500 m away from █████ Villa. The entity displayed no memory of the previous encounter with Team 2. Further plans to apprehend SCP-6648-3 were suspended, and Team 1 was informed of the situation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe operation provided evidence that SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 possess powerful reality-warping abilities which protects them from harm, regardless of the entities’ awareness of the situation. Although SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 pose great danger in severely altering space and time, the entities showed no hostility without being provoked and retained no memories of a harmful encounter. It is suggested that future Foundation operatives only approach SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 under civilian disguise and convincing cover story, as well as refrain from any activity that would induce harm or stress to both entities. Future attempts to take SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 into custody are suspended until feasible proposals are made. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 03: SCP-6648-2 Interview Log**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6648-2 (Currently appearing as a 22-year-old male)\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Kara Lane (Level 4 researcher, experienced psychologist and covert interviewer)\n\n**Foreword:**\nFoundation researchers assigned to SCP-6648 devised a plan to interview SCP-6648-2 under the guise of university students gathering data for assignments, which was executed successfully on 12/06/2003.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Thank you so much for being here, Mr. Zachary[[footnote]] The name used by SCP-6648-2 changes every time it is detached from its previous social circle, but the entity itself does not seem to acknowledge this change as abnormal.[[/footnote]]. I’ve been looking all afternoon for someone kind enough to help.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Chuckle) You’re welcome, Cindy. Also, please call me Zack.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Sure, Zack. I promise you I’ll buy you a meal after this.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** That is unnecessary, really. I’m glad to help. By the way, just to confirm, you’re interviewing for your psychology paper, right?\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Yeah?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** I’m curious about the exact title. Nothing else, just curious. You can keep it to yourself if it’s important to do so.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Um, yes! Sorry, it’s rare to see someone so interested in my paper. They just thought I’m a nerd trying to guess what people think.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Anyway, sorry about that. The title for my paper is “The Application of Personality Profiling in Romantic Matchmaking”.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Chuckles)\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Yeah, I know. It sounds funny. I don’t blame you.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** No, you misunderstood. I just thought it was interesting and unexpected. I’m ready to answer your questions.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Thanks for being so nice, Zack.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Alright, let’s cut to the chase and get started! First question: How would you describe your own personality?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Silent for 5 seconds) Logic-reliant, calm, careful, cautiously polite? My classmates tend to call me boring. But I do have a soft spot for animals and people in distress.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** I see. I can definitely feel the last point… Alright, second question: Do you have any hobbies? If yes, please tell me if you feel comfortable about them.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** Mainly build and program small robotics. I also do gardening, read novels and watch all kinds of documentaries.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** I see. You make robots during your free time? That sounds cool. I can’t understand all the electronics and math, obviously, but they’re still cool. Third question: What do you like the most about your hometown?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Silent for 3 seconds) Hmm, you didn’t ask where my hometown is in the form you gave me just now. Is this important?\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** (Awkward fidget) Ah, sorry about that… Guess I forgot to put in the form. Stupid me. I’m sorry. It’s… It’s used to help profiling my interview subject based on their sentiment towards the environment they grew up in. You don’t have to answer that if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** No, no, it’s alright. I understand your point now. Well, technically I don’t have a hometown since I don’t know where I was born. I grew up in ███ ███████ Orphanage in Tumaco, so I believe it’s the best reference point for the question.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** I haven’t returned to Colombia in years, but I have many good memories there. I was too young to remember names back then, but I remember playing for hours at the local arcade and the joy of saving up money to buy a Walkman from the nearby electronics store. Are my answers fit for you?\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Yes, yes, that is nice. Thank you. I’m sorry if I –\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Interrupts) No, it’s perfectly fine, I assure you. I would not have told you if I was uncomfortable. Believe me, no one can force me to talk when I don’t feel like it.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Great, great! Good to hear that, so, um… Fourth question, how would you describe your experiences during each stage of your education?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Silent for 5 seconds) Thinking about it, my entire school life was mild and uneventful. I was lucky to not catch the attention of bullies, but I also never had any lasting friends. I joined the robotics club and basketball team in high school and university, which I did not spend too much time on. That was rather ideal for me, actually, since I got to delve into intensive personal studies on programming and electronic engineering.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** Overall, I believe I had a good studying experience.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** I see. Thanks for the info. Now, um…\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Chuckles) Are we going into the “romantic matchmaking” part of the questions?\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** (Laughs) You guessed it! Yes, we are. There are only two questions for this part, so you don’t have to wait much longer.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** I would not have helped you if I minded. Please, ask away. I’ll answer as best as I can.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Thanks, Zack. You’re my hero. Alright then, fifth question, how do you feel about seeking a romantic partner in your current stage of life?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Silent for 10 seconds) Well, to be honest, this question never crossed my mind. Now that I think about it, it was strange, but I never had any crush on anyone, even during adolescence. I do like certain people in different stages of my life, but nothing felt romantic. It is hard to explain why, pardon me, but it felt like I already missed the right person for me since the beginning.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** Well, I believe my answer is no. I do not feel like seeking a romantic partner in my current stage of life. At least for now.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** Well… Thanks for being so open about your feelings, Zack. It’s alright! Things work differently for all of us. I’m sure you’ll get the feeling right someday.\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** No worries, Zack. Alright, final question of our interview. This is actually the question I spent the most amount of time on… It’s supposed to give the best analysis on the one I’m interviewing. You ready?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** Yes, I’m ready.\n\n**Dr. Kara Lane:** How do you feel about someone who is as dramatic and arrogant as they are graceful and passionate? Someone who is also fond of cooking and hunting?\n\n**SCP-6648-2:** (Silent for 5 seconds) Well, that sounds like the love of my dreams!\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:**\nFurther verification showed that ███ ███████ Orphanage does not exist in Tumaco, neither in the past nor present. Interviews were conducted with residents of Tumaco who have lived there since the year 1981, but none of the interviewees appeared to know SCP-6648-2. The educational institutions which SCP-6648-2 filled into the education section of the pre-interview form, as well as the clubs SCP-6648-2 claimed to have joined, do not possess any enrolment records of anyone resembling SCP-6648-2.\n\nNote from Dr. Kara Lane:\nPlease do not make me act like that again. Ever.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 04: SCP-6648-3 Interview Log**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6648-3 (Currently appearing as a 25-year-old female)\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Monroe Idris (Level 4 researcher, experienced psychologist and philologist)\n\n**Foreword:**\nFoundation researchers assigned to SCP-6648 devised a plan to interview SCP-6648-3 under the guise of a friendly conversation between hunters, which was executed successfully on 21/09/2003.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** Tough day, Alex[[footnote]] The name used by SCP-6648-3 changes every time it is detached from its previous social circle, but the entity itself does not seem to acknowledge this change as abnormal.[[/footnote]]?\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Drops wild boar corpse from shoulder) Damn right, Lewis! This son of a gun nearly rammed me into a tree. (Chuckles) Too bad I’m still faster than him.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Chuckles) I never doubted it.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** You better not, Lewis. You better not! Ah, speaking of that, I also never doubted that you got us a nice wild chicken. Please tell me I’m right.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Holds up wild chicken corpse) Your trust is well placed, Alex. We’re gonna have a nice grill tonight.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Laughs) And what? We gobble up some protein and talk about our lives?\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** I wouldn’t mind that.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Processes both animal corpses) Sure, why not? I’m curious about what brings you into hunting. You know, despite all the ‘taking away the mommies from baby animals’ thing going on.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Prepares bonfire) For one thing, I’m pretty sure you already know that we both hunt invasive species only. Besides, it’s hard to shake the habit that your dad passed on to you.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Fair point.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** What about you? No disrespect intended, but it’s really rare to see ladies on the hunt. Especially someone as veteran as you!\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Well, my story is like yours! A hunter adopted me when I was 6, and I grew up in a literal jungle in Indonesia. Like, a real goddamn jungle. Full of snakes and boars and all the stuff that wants to kill you.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Then it just became natural, I guess. He taught me well.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** Now that’s interesting. He’s gotta be famous in the area, right? Or it won’t explain how good you are with a rifle.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Laughs) Please don’t tell me you are going to my hometown.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** Why not? Sounds like a wild place. I love wild places.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** Ah, just to make it clear, I’m not gonna ambush your dad’s house or something. You don’t have to tell me where it is if you don’t want to. I just thought Indonesia sounded like a good place to add to my travel list.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Huh.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** I’m sorry, I –\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Interrupts) Nah, it’s fine. I don’t live there anyway. Sigh, and you asked me too late, man. That old man died last winter.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Silent for 5 seconds) I’m sorry to hear that.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Well, at least he died in peace, Lewis. He died in peace.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Anyway, if you’re really that interested, the name’s Murfati Izwan, “hero of Mentawai, slayer of the mad beast” – as he would like to call himself when I was a kid. (Chuckles)\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Pokes bonfire) Sounds like a man of spirit. I’m sure you had a pretty cool childhood.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Seasons meat) Well, yeah! It was pretty cool, I think. Learned lots of things about the plants and beasts. You can throw me in any of those god-forsaken jungles, and you bet, I’ll walk out alive to get you. \n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Well, at least my school days aren’t cool. The kids back in █████ ██ called me a butcher. They said I smelled like dead meat, but really? I shower every day with soap! When those brats really threw dead meat into my bag, though, (Laughs) I beat them so badly that they didn’t even dare to tell their mama.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Silent for 3 seconds) Wow. That was actually cool as well.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** Sigh, not so cool when those bastards from ██ █████ High gave me the same nickname again. But I don’t wanna waste my time on those idiots anymore. I quit, I became a ranger, and then a cook, and then a hunter. I guess everything went back to how it started.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Roasts meat) Not that I’m complaining, though. At least I’m proud that I’m a much better cook than my old man!\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Laughs) I can see that. Or, hmm, I can smell that.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Laughs) Not so fast, hungry man! Not so fast. Five more minutes, Lewis, and you’ll get the best roast chicken of a lifetime!\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Chuckles) Oh boy. A man would be so lucky to have you as a wife.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Silent for 3 seconds) You’re not trying to flirt with me, aren’t you? If you are, that’s a pretty lame way to do it.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** No, no, no, that’s not what I mean. I was just curious, you know, because luck wasn’t exactly on my side. 80 percent of the girls ran off like I’m some children’s storybook villain when they know I hunt, and the other 20 percent never stayed more than a month.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** I sure hope that’s not the case for you, Alex.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Silent for 10 seconds) Sigh, well, sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but your luck is as good as mine. I’m a good cook, sure, but I’m far from a fucking housewife. For some god-forsaken reason, every guy that had something for me wanted a housewife. That just won’t do, you know? I still wanna fire a gun and shoot some bastards.\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** It just never felt right, Lewis. It never felt right. I’m probably gonna stay like this for a long, long time.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** (Silent for 5 seconds) I see.\n\n**Dr. Monroe Idris:** Maybe you can start looking instead of waiting, like, do you have an ideal type? Maybe someone who is smart, calm, well-studied and knows how to respect someone? Someone who is nerdy but likes to help?\n\n**SCP-6648-3:** (Silent for 5 seconds) Well, that sounds like the love of my dreams!\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** \nFurther verification showed that a person with the name of Murfati Izwan does not exist in the Mentawai Islands, neither in the past nor present. Interviews were conducted with residents of Mentawai Islands who have lived there since the year 1978, but none of the interviewees appeared to know SCP-6648-3. █████ ████ and ██ █████ High which SCP-6648-3 claimed to have studied in do not possess any enrolment record of anyone resembling SCP-6648-3.\n\nNote from Dr. Monroe Idris:\nI know what SCP-6648-3 told me was not real, but --she-- it did not show any signs of lying. Perhaps this is also some form of self-defence mechanism?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 05: Translation of the Text Inscribed on SCP-6648-1**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Document Title:** Translation of the Text Inscribed on SCP-6648-1 (Paragraph 1 – 8)\n**Version:** 4.6\n**Progress:** 65%\n**Last Updated On:** 08/10/2004\n**Last Edited By:** Dr. Monroe Idris\n\n**Foreword:**\n\nThe text inscribed on SCP-6648-1 consists of a combination of 63 different ancient Celtic symbols. Among all the catalogued symbols, 12 are Anatolian, 5 are Gaelic, 23 are Proto-Celtic, and the remaining symbols have no traceable origin. The text was divided into 12 paragraphs, with 6 paragraphs inscribed on the front and back side of SCP-6648-1 respectively.

They are as [INDECIPHERABLE] as they [INDECIPHERABLE]. It is paramount for you to know them and help them suffer, as it might avoid your demise.\n\nThe first in love was [INDECIPHERABLE], clad in azure [INDECIPHERABLE] and glistening [INDECIPHERABLE]. He was the mighty wheel, the mighty light, the one who breathed lightning into minds. The second in love was [INDECIPHERABLE], adorned with scarlet [INDECIPHERABLE] and harrowing [INDECIPHERABLE]. She was the valiant sword, the valiant flare, the one who spilled blood into the oblivion. \n\nWhen ice met fire, all should be scorched or frozen, but they saw each other. When flesh met metal, all should be gouged or shredded, but they dreamed together. When the dark pit met the shining crown, all should be ruined, but they loved each other. It was not meant to be, but it was. The lovers watched the [INDECIPHERABLE] and [INDECIPHERABLE]. Then their children became, blessed by him in mind and gifted by her in form. Fangs against silk, it was difficult, but it went on. The children danced, and their gods sang.\n\nAs gifted and cursed as it is, the courtesy of [INDECIPHERABLE], nothing truly changed, yet nothing truly lasted. The lovers held each other dearly, but their children did not. Their children decided that two gods were too many: only one shall be supreme. Their children made different choices and learned to hate each other, drawing power from their makers to harm the other. As powerful as they can be, they were no match for their children's hatred. They could [INDECIPHERABLE] it all, yes, but they could not. When a god learns to love their children, they have a weakness.\n\nThe ordeal was over, and none was left. The warm, the cold, the living, the dead, all was gone into the eternal [INDECIPHERABLE]. The lovers are not bound to one world, so with a broken heart they seek. They were many, they were in all worlds, they were all among the earliest ones to be, yet they were all different. Same in forms and names but different in spirit, like fruits from the same tree. Of all their different manifestations, they were the only pair in love. The hateful loathing, selfish love and desire to reign supreme above the other fused into a horrible plague, seeping deep into their counterparts and children of other worlds. The lovers were spared from the plague, yet they suffered by watching, another curse from [INDECIPHERABLE]. Branches wilted, fruits rotted, and the stars dimmed.\n\nWeeping and howling into the [INDECIPHERABLE], the lovers could no longer sing and embrace without sorrow. All other worlds had a different them, they had no clean [INDECIPHERABLE] to start all over again. Perhaps they could save one of the worlds, just one, to preserve a fruit of hope from the dying tree. Perhaps they were the real plague, but they were too heartbroken to care. One last farewell, and the deed was done. Their godly compositions and memories polished off like worthless scrap, leaving a tiny piece behind only so they could survive. Their love for each other was shattered and ground to dust, scattered among their counterparts and children in that one world to delay the inevitable. In a crude image of their children, they now walk among them – among you. Cursed by their resistance towards [INDECIPHERABLE], they grace your land.\n\nBe aware, watchers of this world. This letter was a courtesy from the stars, a sister, a [INDECIPHERABLE] of the lovers. The lovers shall never meet, or worlds shall fall. Like the dark [INDECIPHERABLE] and bright [INDECIPHERABLE], they held each other in place, prisoners of their love for the other, even if they can no longer love each other. The lovers nailed the fabric of existence in place, remaining apart to muffle the screams and struggles of their counterparts and broken selves, even if they have forgotten such purpose. \n\nBe aware, watchers of this world, if the lovers were discovered by those plagued by [INDECIPHERABLE] hate, what is remained of them shall crumble and melt into their counterparts, who shall rise again to shattering worlds and great peril. Be aware, when the corrupted children of their counterparts sing the songs of hatred and make offerings of twisted love, the lovers will be hexed by their fervent wishes to meet under the white star and [REMAINING PARAGRAPH UNTRANSLATED].\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 06: Rendezvous Event 02 Incident Log**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Incident Log:** Rendezvous Event 02\n\n**Foreword:**\nThe initial location of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 was Siddi Bel Abbes, Algeria and Tauranga, New Zealand respectively.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\nOn 19/05/2003, 6 months after initial discovery, SCP-6648-2 resigned from its position as a quality control manager at ███████ Electronics and purchased an air ticket to Casablanca, Morocco online. 6 hours later, SCP-6648-3 applied for a 1-month leave from its position as a ranger at ████ ███████ Estates and booked a North America cruising trip online, with Morocco as the final destination. This marked the start of Rendezvous Event 02 and MTF Phi-6 (\"Breakup Artists\") was mobilized.\n\n12 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 started driving to Algiers International Airport. At the same time, SCP-6648-3 boarded a taxi to Mt. Maunganui Port. As the distance between the entities reached 24 km below antipodal distance, plant life within a 5 km radius of SCP-6648-2 started to display reversed growth at a rate of 2 months per minute, and the weather elements within a 10 km radius of SCP-6648-3 entered an isolated static state. \n\n12 hours 15 minutes into the event, Team 1 and Team 2 coordinated with Foundation operatives in the local police department to set up roadblocks under the cover story of prison break investigation. To avoid inducing excessive stress for the entities and triggering their anomalous effects, the roadblocks only delayed SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 for 1 hour 5 minutes and 1 hour 30 minutes respectively.\n\n12 hours 13 minutes into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 simultaneously abandoned their travel plans, returning to their local residence in Sidi Bel Abbes and Tauranga respectively.\n\n14 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 resumed antipodal distance. 15 hours 2 minutes into the event, all anomalous phenomena caused by the entities ceased completely. The plant life affected by SCP-6648-2 resumed natural growth without regaining their reversed growth progress. The weather elements affected by SCP-6648-3 resumed natural behaviours.\n\nRendezvous Event 02 concluded. No casualties were recorded.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:**\nMTF Phi-6 was instructed to propose several feasible procedures for delaying SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 involving all conventional transportations.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 07: Rendezvous Event 05 Incident Log**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Log:** Rendezvous Event 05\n\n**Foreword:**\nThe initial location of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 was Siddi Bel Abbes, Algeria and Tauranga, New Zealand respectively.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\nOn 28/09/2003 4 months after Rendezvous Event 04, SCP-6648-2 temporarily halted its Electrical Design Consultant services on a freelancing website. Internet browsing history of SCP-6648-2 indicated that the entity planned a self-driving trip to Morocco. 8 hours later, SCP-6648-3 applied for a 2-month leave from its position as a ranger at ████ ███████ Estates and purchased an air ticket to Fez, Morocco online. This marked the start of Rendezvous Event 05 and MTF Phi-6 (\"Breakup Artists\") was mobilized.\n\n8 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 started driving to Figuig, Algeria. At the same time, SCP-6648-3 started driving to Auckland Airport. As the distance between the entities reached 28 km below antipodal distance, environmental water within a 9 km radius of SCP-6648-2 started to freeze despite the local temperature of 26 – 28 °C, and the confined spaces inside buildings within a 4 km radius of SCP-6648-3 started to expand into 1.25 times their original size. \n\n8 hours 15 minutes into the event, Team 1 sabotaged the exhaust system of SCP-6648-2’s car during a refuelling stop, breaking down the vehicle 20 minutes later. However, the breakdown caused a small traffic accident, which led to two civilian drivers assaulting SCP-6648-2 despite the entity politely offering financial compensation, triggering the entities’ reality-bending effects before Team 1 could intervene. All objects and living beings within a 500 m radius of SCP-6648-2 were warped to a spatio-temporal state 5 minutes prior to the traffic accident, while SCP-6648-2 and its vehicle were warped to an alternative route. \n\nSimultaneous with the attempt of Team 1, Team 2 added temporary syncope-inducing and paralytic compounds into food ingested by the only ranger available for replacing SCP-6648-3. After the ranger was hospitalized under intensive care, Richard ███████, the owner of ████ ███████ Estates called SCP-6648-3 and demanded the entity to resume its post. SCP-6648-3 sternly refused, resulting in a heated argument between Richard ███████ and the entity. SCP-6648-3 was highly stressed when Richard ███████ threatened to fire both SCP-6648-3 and the hospitalized ranger, triggering the entities’ reality-bending effects. All objects and living beings within a 20 km radius of SCP-6648-2 were warped to a spatio-temporal state 10 minutes prior to the replacement ranger’s hospitalization, including Richard ███████. Agent Yang from Team 2 inquired the replacement ranger under civilian disguise, revealing that the ranger only remembered eating in a different restaurant from where Team 2 poisoned his food.\n\n10 hours 22 minutes into the event, the radius of SCP-6648-2’s effects expanded to 15 km, water molecules in the blood of humans and animals within the affected radius started to freeze alongside environmental water despite the local temperature of 27 – 31 °C. The radius of SCP-6648-3’s effects also expanded to 12 km, the confined spaces inside buildings within a 4 km radius of SCP-6648-3 started drastically expanding into 3.5 – 5 times their original size.\n\n10 hours 50 minutes into the event, before MTF Phi-6 could execute further procedures to delay the entities, SCP-6648-2 abandoned its travels and started driving to Algiers International Airport instead. Simultaneously, SCP-6648-3 stopped at a roadside restaurant and purchased a new air ticket to Singapore online. After arriving at Algiers International Airport, SCP-6648-2 purchased a new air ticket to Ecuador. Internet browsing history of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 indicated that their new destinations were River Valley, Singapore and Ambato, Ecuador respectively. Team 1 and Team 2 coordinated with Foundation operatives within ███████ Airlines and ████ ██████ Airlines to reschedule and reroute the flights of both entities, ensuring the distance between the entities deviate minimally from antipodal distance.\n\n25 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 resumed antipodal distance. 25 hours 10 minutes into the event, all anomalous phenomena caused by the entities ceased completely. The water frozen by SCP-6648-2 resumed natural state of matter in accordance to surrounding temperature. The confined space in buildings expanded by SCP-6648-3 resumed original size.\n\nRendezvous Event 05 concluded. 520 casualties were recorded as a direct result of SCP-6648-2’s anomalous effects. 199 casualties were recorded as an indirect result of SCP-6648-3’s anomalous effects.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:**\nMTF Phi-6 was reprimanded for their failure to properly account for public safety during the attempt to sabotage SCP-6648-2’s vehicle, as well as underestimating the severity of the situation when SCP-6648-3 and Richard ███████ engaged in verbal conflict. Dr. Marin Flint Jr., the Ethics Committee representative stationed at Site-306, expressed her disapproval of MTF Phi-6 sabotaging the health of a civilian to delay SCP-6648-3 despite possibilities of alternative methods.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 08: Rendezvous Event 13 Incident Log**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Log:** Rendezvous Event 13\n\n**Foreword:**\nThe initial location of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 was River Valley, Singapore and Ambato, Ecuador respectively.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\nOn 17/06/2004, 9 months after Rendezvous Event 12, SCP-6648-2 applied for a 3-month leave from its position as Electrical Designer at ███ █████ Planning and purchased an air ticket to Casablanca, Morocco online. 30 minutes later, SCP-6648-3 resigned from its position as a bouncer at ████████ Bar and purchased an air ticket to Marrakech, Morocco online. This marked the start of Rendezvous Event 13 and MTF Phi-6 (\"Breakup Artists\") was mobilized.\n\n3 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 started driving to Singapore Changi Airport and Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport respectively. As the distance between the entities reached 25 km below antipodal distance, a chronological gap of 2.6 seconds started to occur between an 8 km radius of SCP-6648-2 and the rest of the world, and all metallic objects containing over 50 percent of iron within a 6 km radius of SCP-6648-3 started to melt without being exposed to any temperature above their normal melting point.\n\n3 hours 15 minutes into the event, Team 1 and Team 2 infiltrated and manipulated the traffic light control system around SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 respectively, successfully delaying the entities for 35 minutes and 48 minutes respectively.\n\n4 hours 20 minutes into the event, SCP-6648-2 arrived at Singapore Changi Airport. 5 hours into the event, SCP-6648-3 arrived at Mariscal Sucre Quito International Airport. 20 minutes before the boarding time of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3, Team 1 sabotaged the fuel regulation electronics of the plane’s left engine, while Team 2 sabotaged the plane’s landing gear. This forced both planes to stop halfway while taxiing towards the entities’ respective boarding gate, resulting in a 36-hour delay on SCP-6648-2’s flight and an indefinite delay on SCP-6648-3’s flight. However, SCP-6648-2 purchased two new air tickets, planning a flight transit from Malaysia to Morocco instead. SCP-6648-3 also purchased a new ticket to Morocco from Cotopaxi International Airport. \n\nFollowing this new development, Team 1 and Team 2 proposed to further sabotage SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3’s flights. After a discussion between Agent Weiss, team leader of MTF Phi-6 and Shaik Ibrahim, director of Site-306, the proposal was rejected to avoid causing suspicion and overly disrupting civilian transport. MTF Phi-6 proceeded to reroute the new flights of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 under the cover story of weather issues, further delaying the entities for 28 minutes and 30 minutes respectively.\n\n8 hours 50 minutes into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and El Dorado International Airport. As the distance between the entities reached 352 km below antipodal distance, the radius of SCP-6648-2’s effects expanded to 30 km, the chronological gap drastically expanding to 7 minutes 20 seconds. The radius of SCP-6648-3’s effects expanded to 39 km, all iron within objects and living beings of over 80 kg starting to evaporate without being exposed to any temperature above their normal melting point. This caused public panic and a massive number of casualties unprecedented by previous Rendezvous Events.\n\n9 hours into the event, to prevent further casualties Agent Weiss and Director Ibrahim obtained approval from the O5 command to deploy Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA). Agent Rime from Team 1 and Agent Imp from Team 2 disguised as airport hotel cleaners, each carrying three SRAs concealed within specialized housing containers disguised as a cleaning trolley. Agent Rime and Agent Imp were positioned in front of the hotel room where SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 were residing respectively, where Agent Rime was instructed to activate his batch of SRAs first. The anomalous effects around SCP-6648-2 did not subside, but the radius of SCP-6648-3’s effects started to expand drastically at a rate of 100 m/s. Agent Imp immediately activated her batch of SRAs, which stopped the expansion of SCP-6648-3’s effects. 1 minute later, all SRAs around the entities began to overheat and output malfunction alerts, their installed Kant counters displaying radical Hume fluctuations between 0.0001 and 8000. 1 minute 10 seconds later, all SRAs near the entities exploded into flames alongside all electrical appliances within the hotel corridors outside the rooms where the entities were residing. Agent Rime took cover in time, but Agent Imp was caught in the explosion and suffered from second-degree burns.\n\nBefore MTF Phi-6 could retrieve both agents and salvage the situation, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 noticed the power failure and exited their hotel room to assess the situation, discovering Agent Rime and Agent Imp respectively. SCP-6648-2 helped Agent Rime up, addressing its concern on his wellbeing before theorizing that the electrical system must have short-circuited. Agent Rime quickly agreed. SCP-6648-2 proceeded to help Agent Rime extinguish the flames caused by the small explosion, when a portion of the ceiling damaged by the exploded power lines crumbled down on Agent Rime. SCP-6648-2 lunged at Agent Rime, pushing both itself and Agent Rime out of danger. After helping Agent Rime up again, SCP-6648-2 stated that it \"would not want the agent's wife and daughters to lose their loved one as it did\". Agent Rime immediately questioned SCP-6648-2 on its knowledge about his family, but the entity only expressed confusion and claimed to have no memory on the statement it previously made.\n\nSimultaneous to SCP-6648-2’s interactions with Agent Rime, SCP-6648-3 returned to its hotel room to call the local emergency services after quickly accessing Agent Imp’s injuries. MTF Phi-6 rerouted the call to Agent Swift, who acted the role of emergency call operative. SCP-6648-3 later exited its room with a first aid kit and started to crudely wrap bandages around Agent Imp’s wounds. SCP-6648-3 kept speaking to Agent Imp to make sure she stayed conscious until Foundation medical personnel arrived at the scene. SCP-6648-3 insisted on accompanying Agent Imp to the hospital, which MTF Phi-6 instructed the medical personnel to agree. SCP-6648-3 and Agent Imp were transported to the nearest civilian medical facility under Foundation control. While refusing all offers of health examinations, SCP-6648-3 accompanied Agent Imp for 1 hour before she was scheduled for surgery. During that time, SCP-6648-3 stated that Agent Imp looked \"as lost as a lone lovebird just like her\". Agent Imp asked SCP-6648-3 to elaborate on that statement, but the entity did not acknowledge her question and behaved like it had no memory on the statement it previously made.\n\n12 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 both abandoned their journey to Morocco, purchasing an air ticket back to Singapore and Ecuador online respectively. 28 hours into the event, SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 resumed antipodal distance. 28 hours 14 minutes into the event, all anomalous phenomena caused by the entities ceased completely. The chronological gap between the surrounding of SCP-6648-2 and the rest of the world dissipated. The iron melted or evaporated by SCP-6648-3 returned to their normal states.\n\nRendezvous Event 13 concluded. 1314 casualties were recorded as an indirect result of SCP-6648-2’s anomalous effects. 5035 casualties were recorded as a direct result of SCP-6648-3’s anomalous effects.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:**\nUnder O5 command, more resources were allocated to the research team of SCP-6648 with an emphasis of devising practical plans to contain SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 as soon as possible. MTF Phi-6 was instructed to investigate notable occult activities occurring near SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 for any patterns related to the Rendezvous Event. Due to the disastrous possibilities of SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3’s effects and current lack of effective countermeasures, Agent Weiss, team leader of MTF Phi-6 and Shaik Ibrahim, director of Site-306 submitted a request for long-term support from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#gamma-5 MTF Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\")] during future Rendezvous Events. Researcher Kara Lane and Monroe Idris proposed to relocate SCP-6648-1 to a new site, as SCP-6648-2 and SCP-6648-3 will become suspicious if their travel attempts to Morocco constantly fails.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Addendum 09: Research Note of Dr. Monroe Idris**\n\n[[collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nMonday, 21/06/2004\n\nLast week was disastrous for everyone – on the surface level, but we have learned to see beyond the surface level long ago. It’s what we researchers are for, eh? I feel sorry for Phi-6 for having to deal with -2 and -3, and oh god, the casualties… I do hope it will not get worse in the future, but we can only focus on the present.\n\nWe finally got a viable theory. A new viable theory.\n\nThroughout our experience on anomalies research, we learn that we cannot always trust the records we found on them. The stone might not be telling us the whole truth about -2 and -3, but maybe – just maybe – it is doing more than passing down their tragedy. \n\nWe all see how -2 and -3 always try to move closer to each other during an R-Event, and how shit can go wrong because of that, but what about the stone? We lost focus on the stone because of the damages caused by the R-Event. We got distracted. The stone is much more important than what we thought it was.\n\nYou see – after the SRA incident, I couldn’t help but connect the entities to the SRA itself. Why do -2 and -3 have to meet at the stone during an R-Event, instead of anywhere else on our planet? Why does -2 or -3’s effects become worse when only one of them is exposed to an SRA? Because they **are** an SRA.\n\nTo be precise, the stone, -2 and -3 are like different components of an SRA. We all know that a properly functioning SRA needs a reference point to baseline reality, the Hume level of 1. An SRA also needs an anode and a cathode, access points to refill missing reality and drain off excess reality. It all fits in now, doesn’t it! How the Humes skyrocketed near -2 and plummeted near -3. -2 is the anode, -3 is the cathode, and the stone is their baseline reality reference point. \n\nThat’s exactly why -2 and -3 try to get close to the stone during an R-Event: they are trying to recalibrate their reality. Just like how an SRA regulates its anode and cathode through the baseline reality reference point when the calibration is off. \n\nWe understand so little about this anomaly, but we know that -2 and -3 are stable if left alone. This anomaly is, well, keeping itself in a very fragile balance. Something is periodically throwing them off, but we don’t know what yet. We **need** to know as soon as possible.\n\nMonroe Idris\n _\n _\n _\nP.S.: Maybe, just maybe… After we figure this out, we can try to contain -2 and -3 by recruiting them into purposely set-up Foundation sites. \n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n _\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Extraterrestrial_Stele_2.png\n> **Name:** Photo of SCP-6648-1\n> **Author:** tingfeng1999\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6648/Extraterrestrial_Stele_2.png\n> **Derivative of:**  https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-man-on-the-dessert-during-daylight-774835/\n> **Additional Notes:** Modified using filters and digital painting software\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6647]]] | SCP-6648 | [[[SCP-6649]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
