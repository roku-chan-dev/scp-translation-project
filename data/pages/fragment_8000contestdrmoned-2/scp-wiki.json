Living SCP-8125-B entities are to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, though for entities with sufficient intelligence, D-Class designation is recommended. Periodic checks of towns near existing SCP-8125-B manifestations are to be performed in an attempt to catch escaped SCP-8125-B entities.\n\nPreemptive containment and any observation protocols around SCP-8125-A Ways are to remain in effect until SCP-8125-A is confirmed to be fully halted. However, decreasing the containment perimeter for areas particularly close to civilian activity is recommended.\n\nBi-weekly check-ups on the state of SCP-8125-A are to be performed by Site-12 Chronology division staff until the abatement centre pipes have been successfully rerouted. Following that, monthly checks are to continue until the timeline fully halts, and the abatement centre has been fully relocated.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nSCP-8125-A is the designation for a halted [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5235|parasitic timeline]]] containing an extremely unstable extradimensional space that exhibits characteristics of numerous fictional works. SCP-8125 was created following the passage of numerous anomalous substances through a physical space also occupied by a new wing of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-12|Site-12's expanding library]]]. The space inside SCP-8125-A is prone to rapid unexpected reality shifts in which one or more narratives are substituted for a different work, often altering the space's terrain and the appearance of entities within.\n\nParasitic timelines such as SCP-8125-A are often created by an inadequate hume level[[footnote]]Meaning a sparsity of reality and extreme malleability of matter[[/footnote]] in an existing timeline to sustain its natural progression. This extremely low hume level causes it to latch onto a nearby timeline that acts as a host. The parasitic timeline then attempts to utilise reality from the host timeline to sustain itself, creating enclaves of its own space within the host. As a side effect of this process, the physical space from the parasitic timeline given form in the enclave imprints itself onto the host, causing phenomena such as that of SCP-8125-B.\n\nSCP-8125-B is the collective designation of anomalous phenomena resulting from SCP-8125-A imprinting onto our reality[[footnote]]This designation technically includes SCP-8125-C following his manifestation within SCP-8125-A, though due to his prior existence as a Foundation researcher and a lack of harmful anomalous effects, he has been given a separate designation.[[/footnote]]. The majority of contained SCP-8125-B instances are stationary, non-living phenomena contained in-situ. It is unknown if this is due to a lack of entities within the imprinted area, or if numerous entities have successfully evaded Foundation capture in nearby populated areas.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum 1: Recovered Logs__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nThe pages attached below are excerpts from Dr Michaels' research notebook that he used as a diary whilst within SCP-8125-A. Initially, these notes were hypothesised to have ended up in an SCP-8125-A Way during the events of the 18th of May, 2008, and were believed to only contain Dr Michaels' research notes prior to his death. However, it was discovered that it also contained logs of his time within Nx-23, despite numerous sources confirming his death in 2008.\n\nAdditionally, descriptions of several photos recovered on Dr Michaels' personal phone have been appended below certain entries to give context to his writing. Due to poor camera quality, the photos themselves have not been attached; please see RAISA staff for access to the related SD card if required.\n\nTesting by a joint RTF[[footnote]]Research Task Force, an abbreviation for a group composed of various departments and subject specialists used to investigate anomalous phenomena with no clear required department, or no nearby relevant department.[[/footnote]] within Site-12 corroborated the theories presented by Dr Michaels within these logs. It is unknown whether these notes were somehow created as part of an SCP-8125-A narrative, or if Dr Michaels is somehow alive within SCP-8125-A.\n\nUntil it is deemed safe to halt, anomalous waste is being carried through the overlap to maintain SCP-8125-A stability. A plan for moving the entire abatement facility to Site-12's Southern Facility is ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nThe first few photos show an extremely mountainous region with sparse vegetation and snow. Several small huts can be noticed on cliffs in the distance. The final two images exhibit extreme downward motion blur, though appear to show large amounts of foliage obscuring the view.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nI hesitate to write unnecessary notes in this, but I suppose my current situation could be considered useful for an exploration log or incident write-up. If I'm where I think I am that is (other than in a large woodland on a particularly nicely shaped rock).\n\nI'll assume you know who I am. If not, then check the front of this notebook, it's there in big bold letters.\n\nNow for an explanation. What? Where? When? How? Why? All of that junk. Let's start with \"where?\" I've been in this space, which I believe to be Nx-23 (aha, there's the \"what?\" mostly covered too), for a while now, though constantly demanifesting makes it hard to check the exact duration. It was the 18th of May when I arrived though, that I'm fairly certain of. I won't write the year because then I'd have to contend with the possibility of being stuck in here for over a year and I'd rather not.\n\nThe \"how?\" is slightly more complex. I remember running into the abatement centre whilst checking recent library expansions and hearing a rather alarming creaking noise behind me, before being rather forcefully hurled off of the gantry. Past that? Not much honestly. I assume I ended up in one of the waste pipes, but that's pure speculation on my part.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nI realise I've not written much about my situation in here. I'd likely be more concerned for my wellbeing if, at the start of this misadventure, I hadn't fallen approximately 15 meters down a cliff, into a bush, and walked away with only light scratches. Any injury sustained after that didn't really phase me. I assume this means I'm considered a Prime entity by whatever dictates this space's rules, which also explains the food I keep finding in random campsites and stashes.\n\nIn other news, it seems that my phone somehow returned to me. I remember dropping it right at the start and thought it lost for good after the first shift happened.\n\nIt hasn't got that much charge so I'll try to save it for recording anything that may be of relevance to how this place operates. I'll also probably use it to document narrative changes, though that's more for personal interest and cataloguing my time spent here.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nTwo photos depict what appears to be a dilapidated underground station, though numerous tents are spread across the platforms. Small cardboard boxes appear to be utilised as tables and chairs. Entities with guns blend into the corners of the station, surveying surrounding platforms. A dim light can be seen emanating from a distant graffiti-covered train cart, with people holding unidentified objects exiting the structure.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nSomething I forgot to mention in my previous entry is that this place is incredibly unstable, shifting constantly. Nothing here stays around for long, me included. No idea where I go, and I'm not sure I really want to know, just in case it falls apart from me looking too close.\n\nMoving back to the source of all this business. I hypothesise that somehow anomalous waste is leaking into the Site-12 library. Anomalous waste anywhere except very tightly sealed pipes is always dangerous, but interacting with a space formerly linked to the Wanderer's library and very anomalous in its own right? That's a whole new level of bad.\n\nThis has by no means been proven. I just happened to find a document linked in the original Nx-23 file that showed the proposed expansion of the site in 1994, including a new Chronology division sector and crucially, the new abatement centre. The engineers and designers weren't stupid, they knew about the library's expansion and placed the new centre fairly far to the left of the library. This would've worked perfectly if the library never expanded horizontally.\n\nIn a completely unrelated matter, I happened to find Archival Department records showing an addition of three new wings of the library from 1995 to 1998.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nI really should be sticking to documentation, but there's something fascinating about having a crossbow bolt fly towards me only to be diverted by someone tripping and throwing a crate in the way. I'd love to walk into the middle of the large fight over there and see what happens. Though part of me worries that the nexus can only take so much mischief and that'd shift me right out of here.\n\nBeing able to live through these stories really is fascinating.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nA photo, framed by a large wagon and several wooden boxes, looks across a wide field. Atop a nearby hill, a large line of men in armour with short shields depicting a roaring lion stand, holding the elevated ground. Slightly below, a group of approximately one hundred archers are running back up towards and through the shield line, a significant mass of soldiers with pikes and crossbows chasing them.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\n\nContinuing with my hypothesis, I presume that the library functions the same as SCP-8125's little enclaves. The library itself is still an extradimensional space, it has just manifested itself into our reality. But what happens when something already exists in the space it wishes to manifest into?\n\nWe've never tested this, partially because making the library angry is an incredibly poor idea, given how useful it is, but also, why would we check? If scans show that it exists in our reality, we have no reason to doubt that it'll just replace any existing matter when it expands.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the extra section does imprint on our reality. However, this reality is also then being used to manifest parts of the base timeline (abatement pipes in this case). This should lead to instability and low hume levels in both spaces, which we could've detected, but reality from the extradimensional pocket initially containing the library likely makes up for this deficit.\n\nTo simplify my rambling above, I believe that both spaces occupy the same physical space, overlapping with each other, rather than just one taking precedence.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\n\nNow, there would normally be no issues with two places existing in the same space, as strange as that sounds. We've got plenty of anomalies like that, that are relatively stable.\n\nUnfortunately, when one of these spaces holds volatile, reality-heavy anomalous waste and the other is a self-sufficient extradimensional space? Something is bound to pop into existence. It's probably the reason that Nx-23 formed in the first place. Or, well, the timeline containing it.\n\nWhy the imprinting onto our reality happens and when it started? Unfortunately, I'm stumped there. Without accessing more info on the library and abatement centre, any conclusion I draw will be wildly extrapolated and likely incorrect.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nA single photo depicts the inside of a tepee, numerous different animal pelts hang up around the small space. A fire burns in the middle of the tent, slowly roasting a large piece of meat. The grassland outside stretches off into the distance entities similar to bison grazing on the long grass, though upon closer inspection, they all sport six legs and an extra horn.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nThe shifting seems to always place me a decent distance from any action. Unsure if this is just because I'm near the edge of the space, or if it's letting me come along for the ride.\n\nEither way, it's rather nice to be able to wander through hallways, fields, caves, discovering various detailed spaces given life by this place. Sometimes these places have books in as well. It does feel rather strange to be reading a book whilst seemingly within one, but it helps pass the time.\n\nI probably should go and see what's happening down there, but I'm not particularly inclined to run away from jellyfish aliens or cause another shift. Staying up here and watching from the window is enough. Besides, it's not a fun feeling when I reappear after a shift whilst mid-movement. Makes the stomach churn.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nThe photo shows the view from a small, grimy window. The window looks out across a ruined cityscape towards a giant, floating metallic ship. Lines of bodies lead to and from the base of the structure, watched by entities resembling giant metallic jellyfish. Eyes covered the upper section of these beings, with the tentacles below ending in a large metal spike.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nHmn, it would seem that being rather high up in a building prior to a shift is also rather... interesting, for the bowels. Fortunately, this place seems calm, if a bit noisy.\n\nI'm tempted to get on one of those boats, they seem to leave fairly regularly, coming back with a haul of fish, slaves, and various treasures. However, I am unsure what would happen if I were to reach the border whilst on a ship.\n\nOne thing I still haven't gotten used to is the shift itself. As the narratives don't all shift in sync, it's very strange watching a large, metallic jellyfish creature slowly shrink and grow a beard. Watching the hair sprout from a half-human, half-metal dome head was rather unnerving to be perfectly honest.\n\nThe terrain is no better; houses slowly melting inwards becoming pieces of rock, a tunnel, or a horse in one strange case. Though that might've been the inhabitants. I do wonder if a cat got morphed. Or, can the humans here morph into animals? I remember reading a book on that when I was a kid.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nSeveral photos are taken from under a thatch roof, a large wooden pier with several ships moored in front. Another ship appeared to be coming into a berth, though a unique triangle sail and an immense crossbow dwarfing most of the entities on board set it apart from the rest of the ships. A boy with a white streak in his hair and webbed feet can be seen running into the frame.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nLuckily, I've only run into hostile entities once; bandits of some kind, though they were swiftly dispatched by a group of knights on horseback that arrived. They offered me a ride to the nearest town, but I declined. I did, however, help myself to some coins from the bandit's body, just to see what would happen to them on the next shift.\n\nPart of me hoped the knights would sweep me off my feet and bring me to a castle, but perhaps I'm getting too into the story. I suspect I'm not princess/prince material anyway, unfortunately. But a man can dream.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nThree photos were taken depicting a group of heavily armoured knights on horseback, standing over the corpses of several leather-clad bodies. Their heads sport large red feathered plumes and they wield large bloodstained swords. Their horses are similarly clad in shining metal armour, though several at the back only appear to be carrying saddlebags. Another photo depicts currency in the palm of a hand, bearing similarities to coins used in Victorian England.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\n\nThe coins are gone, unfortunately. Seems like I can't bring anything with me between shifts; unless it was on my body originally, that is.\n\nI also realised I didn't explain why I refused the knight's help. This space, timeline, pocket dimension or whatever, seems like it has an edge, it doesn't go on forever. Much of the grassland (or whatever else manifests) here starts to fade out into an indistinct blur, much like when a shift happens.\n\nI'm hoping that it's these spaces, near the edge of this timeline, that are being transported to our reality. Fingers crossed it'll take me back sometime soon too.\n\nThough, if I'm being perfectly honest, I'm enjoying this impromptu holiday. --Not like I have anyone to come back to.--\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nNumerous photos, taken from the phone being stabilised on a tree log, show the forest trailing off into a grey misty haze, the tree trunks becoming more and more indistinct and appearing to meld into the ground and sky.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum 2: Dr Michaels__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n3rd of August, 2011, STF Rho-9 (\"Greeting Party) were investigating reports of a second SCP-8125 manifestation in the Peak District National Park. STF Rho-9 reported immediately spotting an unmoving entity resting against a rock wall, at the border of a large brick tower. Upon moving to contain the entity, the Rho-9 team leader reported that the subject was wearing a foundation uniform bearing the credentials of the late Dr Michaels.\n\nDNA testing of the recovered body shows it to be completely identical to the corpse discovered in the abatement facility. Further tests primarily corroborated these results, though an above-average recovery rate for any injuries was noted. Data gathered from the recovered body shows no physical abnormalities, leading medical staff to suggest that the entity is currently in a suspended state due to mental exhaustion.\n\nThis entity has been assigned the designation of SCP-8125-C. Given the findings present in the notebook, SCP-8125-C is believed to have been created following the events of the 18th of May. These events involve Dr Michaels' fall into Site-12's abatement facility and the subsequent passage of his near-dead body into the anomalous waste pipe that intersected with the library, where it was stuck until the abatement retrofit was started. Similarly to the book narratives utilised by SCP-8125-A, Dr Michaels was then periodically inserted into Nx-23, acting as the Prime entity within his own narrative, explaining the demanifestations mentioned in the log.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum 3: Further Investigation__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nDr Michaels awoke on the 15th of August, 2011. Following extensive testing, regular checks for anomalous properties, and a thorough briefing of newly discovered information, Dr Michaels was reinstated as project lead for SCP-8125.\n\nUnder Dr Michaels' lead, an investigation into the historical records of Site-12 and SCP-8125 was completed. This resulted in a report showing that after the retrofit of Site-12's abatement centre in 2008, the rate of SCP-8125-B manifestations increased drastically. Further research led to a series of tests involving repeatedly passing large packets of anomalous, reality-dense material through the library-abatement overlap in an attempt to stabilize SCP-8125-A. A marked lack of SCP-8125-B manifestations were reported in the weeks following the experiments.\n\nThese tests led the SCP-8125 research team to suggest that the increased SCP-8125-B manifestations from 2008 onwards were likely due to an improvement in waste management abatement efficiency. This drastically decreased the amount of anomalous waste reality that was passing through the pipe, degrading the stability of SCP-8125-A and requiring it to initiate SCP-8125-B events more often.\n\nUpon the conclusion of these experiments, no anomalous matter is to pass through the overlap in an attempt to fully halt SCP-8125-3. Current findings show that whilst this halt will cease all SCP-8125-A activity, it will not remove any of SCP-8125-A's Ways or cause SCP-8125-B phenomena to demanifest. If this halt is successful, SCP-8125 will be reclassified as Draugr[[footnote]]\"Item is considered Neutralised or Decommissioned, but ongoing anomalous phenomena originates from them.\" - [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/esoteric-classes-complete-list|Classification Committee internal documents]]][[/footnote]] following a proposal from the Classification Committee.\n\n[[/div]]",
