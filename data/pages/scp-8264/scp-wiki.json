Under no circumstances should 8264 be removed from its warehouse at Site-83. No extra containment is necessary.--\n\nBy order of the O5 Council, it has been determined that SCP-8264 be returned to its natural environment to preserve normalcy and economic stability in the New York Metropolitan Area, and that instances of this SCP instead be closely monitored, logged, and secured so that no civilians may accidentally enter or use 8264. \n\nAgents must be dispatched to each station along every line under NJT’s purview, providing constant watch for instances of SCP-8264, and preventing any passenger from boarding when doing so. Disgruntled/confused passengers are to be instructed that the train is undergoing a “mechanical malfunction”, and will need to take an alternate route for maintenance. Upon witnessing the return of the train, any citizens that may be aboard must be administered a Class G amnestic, then guided to their next proper train under the guise of an NJT employee.\n\nUnder **no circumstances** should any Foundation employee board this train. Research and expeditions of 8264 have been placed on an indefinite hold.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8264 resembles a GE Arrow III passenger train, bearing the “New Jersey Transit” logo on both sides across multiple cars, as well as the number “3399”. Although the number observes standard New Jersey Transit identification protocol, there is no train listed officially under this number.\n\nIt has been observed to arrive randomly at various stops along the New Jersey Transit lines in the New York metropolitan area. Though stops at other rail lines in the past have been discovered, every reported instance of SCP-8264 from the past 40 years has taken place on NJT lines: Main, Pascack Valley, Montclair-Boonton, Morristown, Gladstone, Raritan Valley, Northeast Corridor, and North Jersey Coast. It is currently unknown why 8264 only operates at these stops, but it has never once been observed to run outside of the United States.\n\nUpon investigation of the internal components in the train cars, no anomalous properties were found. The machinery was identical to that of an average GE Arrow III, and removing integral components resulted in a total loss of function (although it was later determined that this method of containment was ineffective).\n\nThose who choose to board the train do not appear compelled to do so by any anomalous force, instead simply mistaking it for a normally operating train. Once aboard, they are then transported to an unknown location, believed to resemble an outdoor train station. There are said to be lampposts to provide dim light for the station itself, but none of it reaches past the roughly 50m long station. There is nothing visible beyond the station except a black void.\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=3399 | caption=A photograph of SCP-8264 arriving at the //Hawthorne Station// along the //Main Line//. | width=WIDTH-GOES-HERE]]\n\nIt is unknown how SCP-8264 is able to reach this location, as its behavior is indistinguishable from that of a normal train when observed from the outside. Once it can no longer be seen by the human eye, it can no longer be located. All attempts to videotape, audiotape, or track the train’s journey have failed, and communication is consistently cut off when the train disappears from view or reaches its vanishing point.\n\nAlways present at the station is SCP-8264-A, a humanoid creature wearing the outfit of a conductor, but bearing absolutely no facial features. On every visit, SCP-8264-A will hold out its hand and request a “Fare” from every passenger. It is unknown how it explicitly communicates this to passengers, with accounts differing on its speech and demeanor. \n\nIf the passenger cannot present the Fare, they will not be permitted to board the “Departing Train”, taking them back to the NJT station they began in. It is unclear what occurs to those who cannot pay, or how they are prevented from entering the Departing Train. The Fare must be paid in physical American currency and becomes increasingly more expensive with each expedition. \n\n[[include component:image-block | name=TheFareCollector | caption=An artistic rendition of SCP-8264-A. | width=250px | align=left]]\n\nUpon return, those who were able to pay the fare exit the train unaffected by the goings-on at the station. They retain full memory of their intentions of boarding the train, but ██ ██████ ██ █████ ███ ███ ███ ██████ ████ ████. Only vague recollections are present of the “station” they arrived at. The only consistent memory is that of SCP-8264-A and their ability to pay the “fare” (though unable to remember the precise amount).\n\nIn addition, ███ ██████ ██ █████ ███ ███ ███ ██████ ██ ██████ ████ █████ █████ ████ ███ ████ ████ ████, although physical evidence still remains.\n\n**Discovery:** Originally discovered in 1981 by a small team of researchers investigating further into a series of reports conveniently placed along the (then newly-built) New Jersey Transit lines. These reports consisted of documentation proving the existence of people they do not claim to remember. After bringing the information to their superiors and consulting the O5 Council, the researchers were permitted to use Class D personnel to begin investigation and expeditions. \n\nHowever, after repeated failed attempts to utilize or understand 8264, the researchers decided to participate directly in the expeditions. Large amounts of resources were lost each trip, and eventually, █████ ███████████, ██ ████. Due to the nature of the SCP, ██ ███████ ████ ████ ██ ███████ ██ ███████ ███ ██████ ██ ███ █████. Their findings remained within Site-333, despite purview falling to Site-83 after its foundation in ████.\n\nIn 2010, a low-level Foundation researcher at Site-333, in an effort to standardize and clean out the many documents left behind by those who were let go, discovered an entire folder containing expedition reports and personnel files that no other Foundation personnel had ever heard of. This information was brought to Director Vincent Bohart's attention, but was summarily dismissed as \"flat-fucking stupid\". Despite this, the file was transferred to Director Ruth Bernhart of Site-83, where it was officially catalogued and investigated.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 8264.A: Table of Known Fare Pricing\" hide=\"-Hide Fare Pricing\"]]\n\n\n|| Date of Expedition || Fare Price ||\n|| 3-18-███2 || $0.25 ||\n|| 9-22-███2 || $0.50 ||\n|| 5-01-███3 || >$1.50 ||\n|| 6-30-2010 || $35.50 ||\n|| 8-13-2010 || $39.00 ||\n|| 9-26-2010 || $42.25 ||\n|| 2-14-2011 || $78.60 ||\n|| 3-20-2011 || $85.05 ||\n|| 4-09-2011 || $90.55 ||\n|| 12-12-2011 || $105.00 ||\n|| 1-05-2012* || $143.80 ||\n\n//*Further expeditions forbidden after concerns about civilians not carrying enough cash to pay.

We even have photos of his wedding, but we never put them up.\n\n**Mr. ████████:** There's gr- some kids of his in some photos too. It looks like...Well, it's clearly some practical joke, and it's sick.\n\n**Officer █████:** What makes you say that?\n\n**Mrs. ████████:** Well, uh...we had always...talked about trying for a child. But we just...never got around to it.\n\n**Mr. ████████:** Not to mention that it's damn impossible! //Every// photo changed in a night? Someone must be having a laugh at us!\n\n**Officer █████:** Right...Listen, we don’t really have time-\n\n**Officer █████████:** -Have you noticed any signs of a break-in?\n\n**Mr. ████████:** Nope. House has been locked up tight. Always is.\n\n**Officer █████████:** And did you bring one of these photos with you?\n\n**Mrs. ████████:** Y-yes. I've got one right here.\n\n= //Mrs. ████████ hands Officer █████████ the photograph.//\n\n**Officer █████████:** Well this...certainly looks...real.\n\n**Officer █████:** Let me see that.\n\n**Mr. ████████:** There's tons of 'em. They're everywhere. Took us a couple days to find 'em all and get 'em all down.\n\n**Officer █████:** Look, we'll uh...have this verified by our guys and send an officer over to your place to look around. I'm afraid we can't do much more than that.\n\n**Officer █████████:** I'll personally see to it. We'll get to the bottom of this.\n\n**Mrs. ████████:** Thank you both so much. That's all we could ask for.\n\n= //The couple can be heard standing from their chairs and exiting the room.//\n\n**Officer █████:** Why the hell would you volunteer for this? Sounds like they're just senile.\n\n**Officer █████████:** No...I’ve got a feeling about this.\n\n= //End of interview.//\n\n----\n\n//The photos were later verified as undoctored by the department, and were taken into Foundation possession shortly afterward.//\n\n//One day later, Officer █████████ visited their home at ████ █████████ ████, Watsessing, NJ. He verified the presence of other photographs of the man mentioned in the interview, as well as made sure that there were no signs of forced entry.//\n\n//He additionally asked the couple if he could search for other indications that this man knew them or lived in this house. Among other memorabilia, Officer █████████ discovered childhood art projects, high school basketball trophies, and even a birth certificate with the name ██████ █████████ ████████ printed on it. The couple asserted their position that they had never met this man before, though they did recognize his apparent wife and children.//\n\n//Upon leaving the residence, Officer █████████ visited the supposed \"family\" of Mr. ████████ at ███ ████ ██████, Watsessing, NJ. The family, seemingly undisturbed by the disappearance of the \"father\", asserted that they didn't recognize the man in the photos either, even though they did recognize his parents. The children identified them as \"grandma and grandpa\", while Mr. ████████ remained unknown, as does the true identity of their father.//\n\n//The wife of Mr. ████████ claimed not to remember how her children were conceived, stating that she believed it to be the result of a night of heavy drinking, after which she couldn't remember the encounter. When asked about her children's grandparents, she became notably confused, unsure of how they were tangibly related to her children, but entirely positive that they were, in fact, blood relatives.//\n\n//After these interviews, Officer █████████ inputted his findings into the district's system, where it was intercepted by the Foundation and subsequently investigated further. Two agents were dispatched to every known location related to Mr. ████████, confiscating any physical evidence of the man, and administering a Class-G Amnestic to those who had been affected by the investigation, including Officers █████████ and █████.//\n\n//It is recommended that other unexplained reports resembling this be investigated and properly contained by Foundation staff with at least Level 2 Clearance.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]] _\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 8264.D: Message From O5 Council - 12/31/2010\" hide=\"-Message From O5 Council\"]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Ruth Bernhart\n**From:** The O5 Council's Office\n**Subject:** SCP-8264's Return **Urgent**\n[[/div]]\n**Ruth,**\n\nThis notice is being delivered to inform you that SCP-8264 will be returned to its original location on the NJT rail lines effective Monday, 1/3/2011. While we understand that this decision may be distressing, it has been determined that the resultant issues with the public transit system due to the removal of SCP-8264 are too severe a disruption to be ignored. Efforts to coordinate with NJT have evidently failed, and the destruction of this integral piece of public transit has greatly affected American economic interests.\n\nIt has been decided that this SCP be instead closely monitored to prevent any contact with the general populus.

The only common link between these people was consistent use of the New Jersey Transit system. After dispatching agents to analyze train patterns, a train was located bearing a number not in the NJT official train catalogue: #3399.\n\n//Description of Anomaly:// Resembles a typical NJT train, save for the incorrect number on its cars. The car itself is physical, can be touched, heard, and perceived by the naked eye.\n\n//Effect of Anomaly:// Anomaly seemingly transports passengers to an alternate dimension, as it is consistently empty upon returning to the original station. Passengers are effectively \"removed\" from existence, as all memories of them are wiped from those that knew them. Despite this, they still seem to exist in physical evidence.\n\n//Containment Suggestions:// Could attempt to remove train from track, but would need to be able to predict what station it will appear at first. For now, Anomaly will be monitored and logged.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab First Expedition Log]]\n**//Expedition Log 8264.82.1 from Agent Jo Soon-Bok on January 8th, 1982//**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Expedition Form**\n\n----\n\n= __Reporting Agent: Jo Soon-Bok__\n\n//Preparation:// 2 D-Class Personnel were given hazmat suits and stationed at a single train station on the NJT Main Line. They were told to only board the NJT train with #3399 on its side. The personnel were waiting for several days before witnessing the Anomaly.\n\n//Execution:// Personnel boarded the train as instructed and were observed leaving the station. Upon return of the Anomaly, no \"personnel\" were aboard, and Site-333 staff asserted none had been approved for any expedition. This document was the only reference for their existence within the Foundation.\n\n//Conclusion:// It is still unknown where passengers of this Anomaly are transported or whether or not they can return under any means.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Email from Jo Soon-Bok (Subject: \"This is It\")]]\n**//Email from Agent Jo Soon-Bok to Dr. Leslie Page on March 15th, 1982//**\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Leslie Page\n**From:** Jo Soon-Bok\n**Subject:** This is It\n[[/div]]\nLeslie,\n\nThis is it. \n\nI'm going aboard myself. We don't have time to flounder around with these...whatever we call them now. Even after 6 expeditions, not one of them has come back. The council keeps cutting our budget, Bohart's a joke, their faith in the Site is diminishing every //minute//...\n\nIf we don't prove something, we'll be cut like the rest of them. I've spent my life working for this. I'm not letting it go because of the ridiculous Boy's Club around here that gives us all a bad reputation.\n\nThere's no way we'll learn **anything** if we don't take the plunge ourselves. Science takes risk. We all knew that when we took this job. It's why any of us are here, in the first place.\n\nBut apparently, I'm the only one around here who's willing to actually follow through and take that risk on.\n\nI //won't// let them get in my way.\n\n-Jo\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Expedition Log 03.18.82 ]]\n**//Expedition Log 8264.82.5 from Agent Jo Soon-Bok on March 18th, 1982//**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Expedition Form**\n\n----\n\n= __Reporting Agent: Dr. Leslie Page__\n\n//Preparation:// Agent Jo Soon-Bok entered the Anomaly alone, outfitted with the items on her person: keys, wallet, ID, and pager.\n\n//Execution:// Agent Jo Soon-Bok departed the station on the Anomaly at approximately 12:53 P.M. EST. The train returned at 12:57 P.M., with the Agent still aboard.\n\n//Conclusion:// Agent Soon-Bok recollects paying a \"Fare\" to be able to return, but was unsure about the exact amount of the Fare. Upon examination of her wallet, $0.25 were missing. The agent is able to describe a small train platform, wherein a conductor requested that she pay to return to the station she arrived from.\n\n//Additional Findings:// The following is a transcript of the interview immediately following Agent Soon-Bok's initial venture into SCP-8264 by Researcher Leslie Page. Upon initial examination, Agent Soon-Bok exhibited an elevated heart rate and was tripping over her own words in excitement. It was later determined that she was not under the effects of any anomalous force, save for the obscured memories of the Anomaly itself. \n\n----\n\n**Agent Soon-Bok**: Leslie, this...this is incredible. We're going to- This could save us.\n\n**Researcher Page**: Jo, please. We need to log this properly.\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just- ...Go ahead. Ask me the questions.\n\n**Page**: 1. Do you currently feel any anomalous effects from your experience on the expedition?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: No. None at all. I feel...relatively normal.\n\n**Page**: Relatively?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: I mean...I'm a bit foggy, but- yeah. Normal.\n\n**Page**: 2. Did you bring anything back from where you traveled?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: No. There wasn't anything there to bring. \n\n**Page**: 3. Please describe your experience inside the Anomaly to the best of your ability.\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Alright. Well we- We left the station and...I guess eventually we arrived at this other one? It all felt very...smooth. Very natural. Hard to tell where exactly we were going. When we stopped, I stepped out onto another station. I...think it was outside.\n\n**Page**: Could you identify anything that told you where you were? Any landmarks? Flora, fauna?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Well, there wasn't much besides the platform itself. Just some lights to keep everything visible. The rest was only...black.\n\n**Page**: Really? There was just...nothing?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: I'm telling you. Empty. And then, after about…5 minutes, the train sounded its horn, I paid the Fare, and came back.\n\n**Page**: The Fare? What Fare?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Oh, well...I uh...I had to pay to get on the train back.\n\n**Page**: Pay who?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: There was a...guy there. A conductor. He made me give him money before I could leave.\n\n**Page**: What did he look like?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: He...was wearing a hat. Uh...\n\n**Page**: That's it?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Well- He didn't really have any facial features. It was...off-putting, to say the least.\n\n**Page**: What did he sound like?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Well, he...Honestly, the voice was like my old C.O. Very harsh, rigid…powerful.\n\n= //A short pause.//\n\n**Soon-Bok**: I hadn’t heard that voice in a long time…\n\n**Page**: So he spoke English?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Seemed to, yeah.\n\n**Page**: And how much did you pay him?\n\n**Soon-Bok**: I think it was...Hm. It was uh...\n\n= //Agent Soon-Bok takes a long pause, attempting to remember.//\n\n**Soon-Bok**: Damn. I really feel like I just had it in my head.\n\n**Page**: Very odd.\n\n**Soon-Bok**: I'm telling you, Leslie. Everything about this anomaly is just…strange. There's so much more here than we can even comprehend right now. I- We need to conduct more expeditions immediately. This- This is going to change everything for 333.\n\n**Page**: God, I hope so.
