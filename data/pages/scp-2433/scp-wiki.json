Printed versions of this file are believed to be safe, and is available to all personnel with sufficient clearance. All edits to this file are recorded and sent to RAISA as precaution. \n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include component:image-block name=original.jpg|caption=SCP-2433 (BRI of 0)]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2433\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All identified copies of SCP-2433-1 are currently saved on a designated hard drive found in Wing C on Site-17. Each saved instance of SCP-2433-1 should be accompanied by a text file detailing recovered site, estimated people affected, and other relevant information, including discovery location, estimated exposure, and calculated BRI. Testing regarding SCP-2433 is open to all Site-17 staff with Security Clearance 2 or higher, as long as the experiment does not involve the usage of an Internet connection; all testing conducted that seeks to use the Internet in any setting require the permission of Site Director Putnam. SCP-2433-1 instances created for the sake of testing must be recorded.\n\nFoundation web crawlers in tandem with image recognition software are to search for images that bear similarities to SCP-2433. Facial recognition software is not to be used as previous protocol revealed large amounts of false-positives. Confirmed instances of SCP-2433-1 need to be removed immediately from public view if possible. Site Director Putnam should be notified if an instance is calculated to have a BRI of higher than 40. \n\nCurrently, there are 73 confirmed instances of SCP-2433-1; the associated MD5 hashes of these images are grounds for instant removal of the image. Social media websites and image sharing sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, 4chan, Twitter, and Pinterest are given priority due to the large userbase and potential accumulation of SCP-2433-μ events. \n\nMembers of MTF Lambda-84 (\"Sample Text\") have joined the security detail of the United States Senate as well as the city of Burlington to monitor for any increase of SCP-2433-μ events, as well as collection of μ-A instances if possible. Due to the large amount of μ-A instances collected each day, as well as its non-anomalous properties, MTF Lambda-84 has been given permission to dispose μ-A instances at their own discretion unless otherwise notified. \n\nAs per request of Foundation Records and Information Security Administration (RAISA), it is strictly forbidden to download this file, as precaution against this file possibly being considered an instance of SCP-2433-1. \n\n[[include component:image-block name=55.png|caption=SCP-2433-1-53, a highly elaborate example of SCP-2433-1 that may display common motifs of the \"vaporwave\" subculture (BRI of 63.8)]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-2433 is an image of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders giving a speech, taken around August 2015 during a campaign event in Florida. \n\nSCP-2433-1 are a collection of images that are altered forms of SCP-2433 through conventional image editing software. Testing has shown that the primary effect of SCP-2433 persists no matter the degree of alteration or the amount it resembles the original image. The majority of SCP-2433-1 instances (52 instances, or 71% of all current confirmed instance) are merely watermarked, resized, or filtered instances of other SCP-2433-1 instances, however, several are believed to have originated from the same origin as the anomalous qualities of SCP-2433. \n\n\nTesting has confirmed that the images yield no anomalous memetic qualities when viewed. The primary anomalous effect occurs when the image is shared, discussed or otherwise interacted with online, triggering a SCP-2433-μ event. Simply viewing a SCP-2433 or SCP-2433-1 instance does not trigger a SCP-2433-μ event, and show no anomalous qualities when printed or taken offline. \"Interaction\" has been confirmed to include: \n\n* Indicating interest or other feelings, such as \"liking\" on Facebook, Tumblr and Twitter\n* Sharing with others, such as forwarding through email or retweeting on Twitter\n* Downloading and reuploading \n* Leaving a comment or post about the image; referencing the image without the image being present on the website does not seem to trigger a SCP-2433-μ event\n\nWhen an SCP-2433-μ event occurs, American quarters (designated as item μ-A) materialize in a 50 meter radius around Senator Sanders. No instance of μ-A has been observed to materialize in solid or liquid matter. Based on material, year minted, scratches, general wear and tear, as well as trace amount of biological matter from fingerprints left on μ-A instances indicate that the origin of the coin is different each time, likely from random sources across the United States each time a SCP-2433-μ event occurs. \n\n\n\nWhen SCP-2433-μ events occur due to the unaltered SCP-2433, μ-A instances materialize in close proximity to Senator Sanders, and usually on surfaces such as tabletops and desk drawers, and may be within visual range of Senator Sanders.[[footnote]]Senator Sanders either never directly witnessed a SCP-2433-μ event, or chose not to acknowledge it. Over a 15 month period, there are 86 recorded instances of Senator Sanders making physical contact with μ-A after a manifestation event; no anomaly has been recorded and there is currently no need to prohibit this from happening. A total of $82.75 have been collected for personal use by Senator Sanders and other staffers, and none towards campaign functions.[[/footnote]] However, the degree of alteration present in SCP-2433-1 increases the possible furthest point of manifestation and becomes less predictable as the Balkin Resemblance Index (BRI) increases. [[footnote]]The BRI of SCP-2433-1 does not change with number of SCP-2433-μ events or amount of people exposed, but has been confirmed to be correlated to brightness, saturation, size, and presence of external visual and textual elements as detailed in //Cultural Software: A Theory of Ideology// (Balkin, 1988).[[/footnote]] \n\nThe base BRI has been defined to be 0 for the original SCP-2433 only in the context of this report and related research. It is hypothesized that a maximum BRI to which would trigger SCP-2433-μ events exist; however, testing is inconclusive to the maximum value of BRI[[footnote]]Current confirmed highest functional BRI at around 600, using a 40 pixel sample[[/footnote]], as it is also hypothesized that the manifestation field would increase with BRI. \n\n\nCurrently, SCP-2433-μ events average at 14 manifestations every hour; before containment procedures were put in place, it was estimated to average at 90 manifestations every hour. The amount of manifestations increases from 1600 hours to 2400 hours EST, then gradually slows down. Manifestation amounts also increase usually on weekends. \n\nSenator Sanders has displayed no knowledge or control over SCP-2433 and SCP-2433-μ events. \n\n\n**Addendum 2433-A:** The origins of SCP-2433 were unclear until a raid on the headquarters of GoI-5869 on 11/16/16. No persons of interest have been found. \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+September 2nd, 2015\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n\n> **kkrule:** anyone wanna talk politics\n> **TrainerDP:** no\n> **talman_corvett:** no\n> **opossum:** no\n> **harmpit:** no\n> **kkrule:** :(\n> **kkrule:** anyone like bernie\n> **talman_corvett:** no\n> **lesbian_gengar:** yes\n> **DonDeLillo:** I like him \n> **tiedyeduck:** he's ok I guess\n> **bones:** Who are we talking about?\n> **opossum:** not a fan of him\n> **opossum:** I have great contempt for anti-establishment candidates no matter their political leanings and Sanders does not seem to have run any of his plans past anyone who got a passing grade in a high school economics class\n> **tiedyeduck:** shut up opossum\n> **DonDeLillo:** I like him\n> **DonDeLillo:** I know @hetcopogg does too\n> **kkrule:** I was at a rally yesterday and i want him to win \n> **hetcopogg:** I do like him but I'm not going to go crazy for him\n> **kkrule:** even got to shake his hand and take a pic with him\n> **DonDeLillo:** I'm really quite impressed at how far he has gone\n> **DonDeLillo:** kkrule: pics \n> **kkrule:** it's on my facebook[[footnote]]Currently not found[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+September 15th, 2015\" hide=\"hide\"]]\n\n> **kkrule:** guys\n> **kkrule:** I have an idea how to help bernie get more supprot\n> **kkrule:** *support\n> **kkrule:** @@http://i.imgur.com/█████@@[[footnote]]Contains 1 instances of SCP-2433-1; estimated 50 people exposed and may correlate to 21 μ-A manifestations between 9/15/2016 to 9/16/2016[[/footnote]]\n> **kkrule:** guys I made this\n> **kkrule:** what do you guys think\n> **harmpit:** lol \n> **lesbian_gengar:** lol\n> **opossum:** it's just a photoshop and not even a good one\n> **opossum:** what's so funny\n> **opossum:** I hate memes so much\n> **kkrule:** :(\n> **TrainerDP:** kek\n> **DonDeLillo:** kkrule: was it you that posted that on /r/██████[[footnote]]A political subreddit supporting Sen.
