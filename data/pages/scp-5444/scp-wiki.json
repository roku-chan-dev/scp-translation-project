Furthermore, all information relating to SCP-5444-4 is to be backed-up through at least two network-inaccessible mediums.\n\nInstances of SCP-5444-1 are to be stored, unpowered, in an electromagnetically-shielded storage locker. Experimentation, when applicable, is to be conducted under similar conditions, and instances may not be connected to the Site-56 intranet without approval and supervision from the IT Department.\n\nSeveral instances of SCP-5444-2 are uncontained; Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") has been tasked with locating and disabling rogue instances of SCP-5444-2.\n\nSCP-5444-3 is to be kept disassembled and stored in the High Value Containment Wing of Site-56.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5444 is a series of malware programmed in the Yashagorō paralanguage. Metadata analysis has returned largely inconclusive results; it is known that SCP-5444 is 1.32//i// GB in size at most, although metadata relating to its creation and ownership has been extensively obfuscated. The most recent iteration of SCP-5444 was last modified on January 9th, 2018 at 16:15 EST.\n\nThree variations of SCP-5444 are known to exist, each of which is associated with a specific hardware environment.\n\n* SCP-5444-1 are a series of miniature computers of custom make, upon which SCP-5444 has been installed as firmware. All run a bare-metal hypervisor in order to simulate a variety of operating systems, while allowing SCP-5444 to run several iterations at once. A high-end web camera has been installed into the chassis of a single instance, designated SCP-5444-1-Prime.\n* SCP-5444-2 is a hypervisor-level rootkit, commonly installed across insecure network connections by SCP-5444-1. Instances otherwise function identically to SCP-5444-1.\n* SCP-5444-3 is a humanoid automaton with an artificial intelligence governed by SCP-5444. Unlike -1 and -2, SCP-5444-3 cannot directly interface with a network, and must employ HIDs[[footnote]] Human Interface Devices. [[/footnote]] to perform its intended functions. SCP-5444-3 was powered by an esoteric engine drawing from SCP-████.\n\nWhen connected to either a database or computer network, SCP-5444 functions as an effectively sapient user. SCP-5444's primary activities are initially limited to accessing and analyzing as much data as possible; upon the confirmation of data referenced in SCP-5444-4, SCP-5444 will attempt to remove such data through any means necessary.\n\nAll variations of SCP-5444 reference SCP-5444-4 through a series of anomalous pointer variables[[footnote]] One of the technical advantages of the Yashagorō paralanguage over nonanomalous languages is the ability to reference variables stored and defined on remote/isolated machines. [[/footnote]]. SCP-5444-4 is a file stored on SCP-5444-1-Prime with a .rysh extension, serving as the primary method of setting SCP-5444's censorship parameters. Modification of SCP-5444-4 first requires the user to undergo a three-factor authentication process to confirm they are PoI-9522-D.\n\nPoI-9522-D was [[[wwydftltimd-hub|Sara Miriam Yarkoni]]], a 29-year-old Iranian-American freelance programmer with connections to GoI-1285 (\"The King of Hearts Collective\")[[footnote]] An independent record label managed by a collective of anartists. [[/footnote]]. According to data recovered from SCP-5444-1-Prime, PoI-9522-D was the sole programmer of SCP-5444-1.\n\nAt present, SCP-5444-4 directs SCP-5444 to erase all evidence of PoI-9522-D's existence.\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-5444's existence was brought to the attention of the Foundation on January 10th, 2018, following a string of attacks targeting several individuals of various backgrounds. Although coordinated in such a manner as to suggest a botnet, several attacks displayed unusual complexity. Attacks included, but were not limited to:\n* Mass DMCA claims against videos featuring PoI-9522-D and her music.\n* Extensive vandalism to several online wikis.\n* Specific behavior intended to exploit streaming algorithms in order to sabotage PoI-9522-D's music's chances of discovery.\n* Blackmail intended to coerce the recipient into deleting files depicting PoI-9522-D from their devices.\n\nShortly thereafter, Senior Researcher Yehezkel Yarkoni received an email, purportedly from his daughter Sara. Attached was a PDF, ostensibly a handwritten letter, infected with an SCP-5444-2 installer.[[footnote]] The resulting SCP-5444-2 instance has been designated SCP-5444-2-1. [[/footnote]]\n\nFollowing its installation, SCP-5444-2-1 launched a series of attacks directed at personnel assigned to the GoI-1285 project, as well as Researcher Yarkoni and his wife, [[[SCP-4947|Dr. Rivka Yarkoni]]]. Mobile Task Force Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") was directed to identify, combat, and isolate the threat.\n\nSCP-5444-2-1 was subsequently isolated and neutralized by MTF-κ10 after two hours and fourteen minutes. Researcher Yarkoni was reprimanded for his carelessness and reassigned to [[[SCP-1769|Area-56]]] duty.\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**DOCUMENT 5444-A**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nIn accordance with the 1966 SoHo Accord, the Foundation required a warrant to raid the residences of PoI-9522-D, on account of her fiance's registration as a Frequent Resident of BackDoor SoHo. Furthermore, action on part of the Foundation was limited to assisting attendant Unusual Incidents Unit operatives.\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\nFollowing the acquisition of SCP-5444-3 and all four instances of SCP-5444-1, each of their drives were isolated and imaged, as standard for computer anomalies. According to imaging software, all files pertaining to PoI-9522-D had been deleted at 16:15:54 EST on 10/01/2018, 24 hours after the last modification to SCP-5444-4; as no action had been taken to wipe the associated data, files were successfully restored with minimal effort.\n\nOf interest to the Foundation were several video files recorded on SCP-5444-1-Prime, in which PoI-9522-D discusses the function and background of SCP-5444, as well as updates as appropriate. The last of such videos was recorded at 16:17 EST on 09/01/2018, 19 minutes prior to her estimated time of death.\n\nExcerpted video logs have been provided below. The original files, as well as full transcripts, may be accessed with permission from RAISA; personnel are to be advised of their sexually explicit nature.\n\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Excerpt of bonus.wmv, recorded 30/12/2010\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **bonus.wmv**\n[[/=]]\n**Date:** 30/12/2010\n\n**Length** 0:28:19\n------\n{{[BEGIN LOG 2.1]}}\n\n**PoI-9522-D:** Heya!

Again, darling, I'll know.\n\n**PoI-9522-D:** So, let me be one hundred percent transparent: those files are a bit of an //experiment//.
