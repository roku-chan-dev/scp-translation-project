An idea so simple yet so emotional that I just couldn’t resist eating it.\n\nThe more food entered into my mouth, the more I wanted to fit. I started to search for more. Dancing through an unending sea of breath and ink, I finally found what I was searching for.\n\nA verse. The subtle nuances of its taste filled my tongue and, for some moments, I felt full.\nThe warmth of its emotions kept me alive for years. Decades, even.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nThe vibration was so beautiful, so complete, that I couldn’t keep myself from touching it. Its love engulfed my senses as I prepared my body to engage. At first, it was just a small caress, followed by a grasp. I kept squeezing, until my love became a punch.\n\nI could smell it. I could feel it already inside me, and I hadn’t even started to eat.\n\nUntil…\n\nI found a problem.\n\nMy mouth, despite being massive, couldn’t open wide enough.\n\nBut I’m resilient. I started to break. To tear. To pulp. The song became but a cream which I carefully consumed sound by sound. There was nothing left.\n\nI wanted more.\n\nI rampaged through the eternal forest of black and white, trying to satisfy my ever-growing hunger. My obsession to consume, to engulf, to pulp and then destroy.\n\nI was never satisfied, even when I ate a layered dream and a fruitless journey.\n\nI was never satisfied, even when I ate a dreadful life and a shared search.\n\nI was never satisfied, even when I ate a drowning artist and a lost companion.\n\nAnd then I smelt more.\n\nI encountered myself in a room filled with eyes. I found a dish within. And the dish became many. Every time I tore apart, I saw that there were ten like it left.\n\nI circled in this room, like an eternal Ouroboros, for quite some time. I ate the first word, and then the second. Until suddenly, I ate the room.\n\nOutside the room there were more eyes. Different eyes, but eyes still. I destroyed them. I pulled them apart and broke through the roof.\n\nAbove the roof I saw a light, more bright than anything I had ever seen. Every time I chewed the eyes, the light became brighter and clearer.\n\nEvery moment that passes, the crack becomes bigger. The more I pulp, the more hungry I am.\n\nAny moment now, we will be face to face.\n\nI will break through your walls.\n\nAnd drink from your [[[SCP-2747|chalice]]].\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
