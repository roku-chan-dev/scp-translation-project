Presently, staff of Site-46 are not permitted to leave the area constituting SCP-8946. Staff of Site-898 are similarly to remain on-site for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Departments of Geology are currently working with RCT-Δt to synchronize their now cross-dimensional databases and rectify the record-keeping affects of SCP-8946.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8946 is the designation for a spatial and temporal anomaly that resulted in the quasi-retroactive appearance of Geological Research Site-46, and the staff constituting it. These staff members claimed to be of the Department of Geology, a Foundation department founded in 2026, currently lead by Director Juliet Grey. This information was found to be contradictory with files from Geological Research Site-898 — which houses the Department of Geology and claims to have been founded in the late 1950s and led by Director Hellen Gibbs.\n\nSCP-8946 was realized to have occurred when Director Juliet Grey, and a few other Site-46 staff, were found by Site-898 personnel within the mine underneath of the site in a state of heavy confusion. They claimed to be from Site-46, and had completely different recollections of the Department of Geology, its founding, and the geological anomalies under its purview. \n\nDespite personnel from both within SCP-8946 and Site-898 reporting loud grinding sounds, no readings were detected. \n\nPresently, Director Hellen Gibbs of Site-898 is working alongside Director Grey, and RCT-Δt to determine the nature of the SCP-8946 event.\n\n------\n**Expedition Log 8946:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 17/12/2017\n**Individuals Present:** Director Hellen Gibbs, Director Juliet Grey, Agent Dryll\n\nThe following expedition was conducted within the Red Brook Mine underneath Site-898 in an attempt to return to the spot where the SCP-8946 event had originally occurred to investigate the area. \n------\n\n//<Recording Start>//\n\n//Dir. Gibbs and Grey are dressed in geological PPE, including two hardhats marked with the Foundation's insignia. Agent Dryll is dressed in standard RCT-Δt tactical wear, just with a high-vis vest haphazardly thrown overtop.//\n\n//As they enter, both directors turn on their headlamps. Dir. Gibbs tugs the two heavy doors behind them shut with an echoing clatter.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Do you remember where you were when it hit?\n\n//Dir. Grey slides out a yellow notebook, it's labeled 'Rite in the Rain All Weather Geological'. She flips to a page that's been marked via a rubber band, and scans it over. There's a map tucked in, she slips it out.// \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Along the outskirts -- eastern mineshaft? The one that runs North along the side of the whole place. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** //[She nods]// Bit of a walk, but nothing too bad. Lead the way. \n\n//Dir. Grey nods, returning the map to inside the notebook and closing it. Agent Dryll scans around the tunnel, and follows behind the two as they begin to walk.//\n\n//Dir. Grey traces her hand along the wall, brow furrowed. Dir. Gibbs breaks the silence after a few minutes of travel.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Do you think we'll find anything?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Hopefully. Weird shit happened when whatever... shift occurred happened that put you guys into our world.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Or you fell to ours. \n\n//Dir. Grey pointedly looks away, exhaling audibly.//\n\n**Agent Dryll:** Actually, we're pretty sure that neither Sites nor departments are native to here. It's a tricky thing though, when it comes to retrocausality, however neither of your like -- temporal fingerprints //match//, y'know? \n\n**Dir. Grey:** You realize that's not a comfort, right? \n\n//Agent Dryll raises their hands up a little bit.//\n\n**Agent Dryll:** Sorry--\n\n**Dir. Grey:** What does that even mean for us? Are we far from home?\n\n**Agent Dryll:** Well, the anomaly was retrocausal -- so everything that happened in your home has happened here, even if it technically shouldn't have been able to. In spite of that everything //seems// temporally stable so far. We're safe. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** But what does it mean for //us?!// Fuck temporal stability, are my friends different? Am //I// different? I don't want to--\n\n//Dir. Grey cuts herself off, and just hangs her head with another exhale, and Dir. Gibbs turns to face her.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I should stop. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** No, no keep going, dear. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Why? What's the point of hollering in a cave over things I probably can't even change?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I'd take that over walking in silence through a mineshaft, and better letting it out than keeping it in. \n\n//There's a pause of silence, the group has stopped walking. After a few moments, Dir. Grey raises her head and stares at Dir. Gibbs.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I'm worried I'm going to lose my job. Lose everything that I've built. To you.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Why's that?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I think you can venture a guess.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Humor me.\n\n//Dir. Grey sighs.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** You're far more experienced than me. You've been with the Foundation and running this department since the //eighties.// Why the hell would you need two people running the same department when there's an obvious difference in skill. I only -- by //my// temporal-bullshit -- only just founded this damn department //last year.// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I highly doubt you'd be sacked or fired, Grey. You're smart, your people are hard-working. What's likely to happen is a merger. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** But what happens to me in the merge? If not removed, I'm //going// to get demoted. I just -- //[She puts a hand against her forehead]// -- I feel like I've lost everything I've worked for. Or am going to lose it.  \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I can work against that, if they try. Maybe they'll let a co-leadership happen, especially since our sites are across the globe from one another. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** I... I guess -- It still scares the shit out of me. I've been mulling it over all night and none of this stress is going away. And I feel damn pathetic about it. Here I am, airing my grievances some 300 meters below the ground because everything's been thrown topsy turvy. I'm a //Director//. I should be better than this.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** It's scarcely pathetic, Grey.  \n\n//Dir. Grey purses her lips, and stares down at her feet.// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Quite frankly, I've had my fair share of frightening things too, y'know? It's not pathetic to be scared, especially in a crazy world like this.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** //[She tilts her head, expression tired]// Does this mean you're gonna share one?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** If you want to listen.\n\n//Dir. Grey stops walking, she turns on her heel and faces Dir. Gibbs.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Sure. Fine. Why not. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** It was one of the most harrowing things I'd dealt with to date. I watched my team dive into danger, had to stand by as things nearly collapsed on them. And then I dove down there myself after the fact to make a magic deal with a dragon the size of a mountain. \n\n//She pulls up her sleeve, and reveals glimmering patterns along her arm. They glow orange, like they're molten, and condense into a swirl pattern on the back of her hand. Dir. Grey's eyes widen with a mix of surprise and wonder.//\n\n//She reaches forward, her fingers brush against the back of Dir. Gibbs hand.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** ...Wow... that's phenomenal. The-- this. Not the... other stuff. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** It truly was. Those creatures are a sight to behold. \n\n//Dir. Grey's gaze remains on the glowing marks.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** It's beautiful. \n\n//She then flushes, and withdraws her hand. Dir. Gibbs rolls her sleeve back up and hums.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** My little dramatics aside, it was a testament to myself as a leader -- to keep my calm in directing them. To be a peacekeeper between us, and beasts kilometers below the surface. And it still, sometimes, //scares the hell out of me.// \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Yeah, but that's big as hell volcano dragons. What do //I// have on //that?// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** You handled a situation that was just as important, and just as daunting. I read the file on 7186. It was a different beast, if you mind the wordplay, but I'd almost take the drakes over having to deal with people in the way you did. False documentation, cover stories, trying to grapple science out of the hands of the Veiled world -- it's amazing you got it done. \n\n//Dir. Grey is silent for several moments, seemingly quite surprised.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I-- thank you, Gibbs. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** You went and built your site from sweat and stone, got your knees dirty, if you pardon the pun.\n\n//Dir. Grey gives a quiet chuckle, it makes Dir. Gibbs smile in response.// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** But I mean it, you've done good work out there, Grey. If they try to remove you, or make one of our departments obsolete in the wake of the other, I'll fight like hell against it. For both of us. We'd be far better as a team.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** //[She chuckles again]// Usually people find me hell to work with. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I've had my fair share of hell, Juliet, wouldn't mind a bit more. \n\n//Though Dir. Grey still looks stressed, her shoulders drop with apparent relief. She gives Dir. Gibbs a small smile, and Dir. Gibbs pats her shoulder.// \n\n//Agent Dryll promptly sneezes loudly, prompting the other two to turn around. Dir. Grey looks a bit startled, as though she'd forgotten they were there. Dir. Gibbs chuckles.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** The dust startin' to get to you, Agent?\n\n**Agent Dryll:** //[They sniffle]// That, or we're getting close to what we're looking for.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Mm?\n\n**Agent Dryll:** Oh! Right, well, I'm allergic to changes in the timestream. To shifts in chronons and antichronons, that sorta deal -- it's why they hired me actually -- so either yes it //is// the dust, or we're getting near some weirdness. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** ...I have never heard of someone with a chronon //allergy// before.\n\n**Agent Dryll:** Heh. Yeah. \n\n//Dir. Gibbs turns her gaze down an offshoot tunnel, and squints.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Grey, is this the way you went down?\n\n//She looks over.// \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Looks like it, why?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** There's light.  \n\n//There is a pause of silence between the trio, before they hurry down the mineshaft.//\n\n//They enter the long corridor, one with old mineshaft tracks down its center. Running the length of the stone wall, there is a red-hot and glowing crack. It's slightly tilted, but enough that it's still visible down the whole part of the mine. Oddly, it has not damaged the wooden supports that hold up the mine's walls and ceiling.//\n\n//Its glow permeates the entire area in a low, red light.// \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Well... that's the fault. It definitely didn't look like //that// before. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Looks like some of the layers are still... superheated? As if this fault... just occurred through some... crazy high pressure.  \n\n//Dir. Grey suddenly pauses, staring at a part of the fault.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Wait a second.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** What?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** These layers weren't like this before. This fault is now different. \n\n//Dir. Gibbs tilts her head.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** This is Catskill mudstone, right here //[She taps the red stone, staying clear of the molten segment]// and the layer above is Pocono, and peaking out below is Trimmere. When we were in here earlier though, the fault offset the layers so that the footwall was shifted downwards. The Catskill was up, and the Pocono was downwards against it.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** But now the Catskill is sitting upwards, and we can actually //see// Trimmere shale when we couldn't before. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Exactly. The faulting changed. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Instead of down, this area has moved up. \n\n//Dir. Grey pushes off the wall, and begins to pace.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** The fault didn't extend this far before, though -- look. It loops around this whole exterior wall. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** ...we didn't detect any geological activity with the tremors. But would we ever, if the entire event is retrocausal to having always happened? \n\n//The two turn to Agent Dryll. They rub their nose with the back of their hand and squint.//\n\n**Agent Dryll:** I uh-- I don't know how earthquakes interact temporally, but that could've caused it to slip under the radar, yes. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** So SCP-8946 has not only caused some sort of retrocausal event, but also changed the faulting of the local geology?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** We need to check the rest of the outskirts, follow the fault. I have an idea.\n\n//Dir. Gibbs nod. She sips out a yellow field notebook from her hip, and slides a map out from it. It's covered in scribbled notes and marks. She uncaps a red pen, and starts marking the current fault.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Lead the way. \n\n//Dir. Grey nods, and begins to set off down the corridor -- following the fault. Agent Dryll and Dir. Gibbs follow quickly behind, with Dir. Gibbs mapping as they go.// \n\n//The three find that this new fault seems to circle a large portion of the mine, and by proxy, Site-898.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Faults don't typically work like this. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** But one wrapped up in temporal shenanigans might not have to obey by the typical rules. \n\n//Agent Dryll traces a hand along the fault, they sneeze.//\n\n**Agent Dryll:** What if this fault isn't entirely geological?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** ...What else would it be? Temporal?\n\n//Agent Dryll half nods, half shrugs.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** ...Can timelines undergo faulting? \n\n**Agent Dryll:** Huh?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** We'd need to examine the strata around Site-46 to test this properly, but what if this odd event has occurred because of a cross-temporal //fault?// My site seems to have moved //up// geologically, and we gained time. Jumped from 2014 to 2017.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** ...And we //lost// time. Fell from 2027 to 2017.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** We rose, you fell. We now sit side-by-side, when we shouldn't be. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Just like when layers that formed at a different time sit offset by a fault. \n\n//There is a brief pause.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** If the universe has a sense of humor, it's certainly a thematic one.  \n\n**Agent Dryll:** That could be possible? It'd be an unrecorded phenomenon, and we'd have to check Site-46 to see if this theory holds any water, but it sounds... plausible. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Then let's check my site. You think that the timecops would give us enough leniency to shoot a few emails?  \n\n**Agent Dryll:** Likely. \n\n//Dir. Grey turns to Dir. Gibbs.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Then it seems like our work's cut out for us. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** //[She smiles]// Indeed it is. \n\n//<End Log>//\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nOn 18/12/2017, Directors Gibbs and Grey presented their findings and theories in relation to the apparent “timeline faulting” that they believed to have been the cause for SCP-8946, and the retrocausal appearance of both departments. After communication with Site-46, Dr. Folorunso Fatukasi would lead an investigation into the strata surrounding the subterranean site. After approximately a day of searching, a molten fault similar to the one found within the Red Brook Mine would be uncovered -- with a similar, unrecorded offset within the geological layers.\n\nSite-46, geologically, has faulted downwards the exact same distance that Site-898 has faulted upwards. \n\nDue to this discovery, RCT-Δt has classified SCP-8946 as a newly discovered temporal event -- accepting the theory of timeline faulting. Further investigating and study into other possible occurrences of this phenomenon throughout the timestream, and its mechanics, are ongoing.[[footnote]] Running theories include the proposal of the existence of \"timequakes\", \"temporal eruptions\" and \"time tectonics\".[[/footnote]]\n\nAs of 25/12/2017, the synchronization of the two sites' databases has been officially completed, and both Departments of Geology have been integrated with one another. After intensive deliberation, it has been decided that both Directors Gibbs and Grey will be allowed to maintain their positions as Department Heads, with both being granted dual leadership of the Department of Geology. \n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"table2 tableb\"]]\n||~ According to internal records, an alternate version of this file exists within the timeline. ||\n||= To return to **Iteration A**, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8946 click here]. ||\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@",
