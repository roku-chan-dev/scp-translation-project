When practicing or performing, he is to keep a recording device on hand to facilitate quick and accurate documentation of any accessed memories. He is to spend no fewer than two hours each workday practicing guitar with SCP-8775, to ensure that previously discovered memories remain accessible, discover any additional memories, and become skilled enough to unlock the known but currently inaccessible ones.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8775 is a black and white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar manufactured in 1976. There is a large scratch on the bottom edge of the guitar's body, but it has no other unusual physical characteristics. \n\nSCP-8775 previously belonged to Dr. Conrad Scott, a memetics researcher at [[[secure-facility-dossier-area-14 |Armed Bio-Containment Area-14]]]. Director Thomas MacLean took possession of the instrument in 2009, after Dr. Scott [[[the-drooling-path |disappeared]]] and left no next of kin. The following year, he gave it to his stepson, Researcher Lee Roy Carlson, as a gift. Researcher Carlson discovered the object's anomalous properties the first time he played it.\n\nWhen certain songs are played on SCP-8775, the performer will relive one of Dr. Scott's memories of performing the same song. The exact criteria required to trigger this effect are unclear and inconsistent, but activation seems to become likelier the more completely and accurately a song is played. Even if full activation does not occur, the user will still experience a strong sense of //deja vu// when attempting to perform a song that has an associated memory. Regardless of the memory's subjective duration, it is always relived near-instantaneously. Most such memories originally took place in 1976, which included the latter half of Dr. Scott's senior year of high school and his first semester of college.\n\nFor unknown reasons, only Researcher Carlson has been able to induce this effect. Through extensive trial and error of 1970s rock songs, guided by the contents of Dr. Scott's record collection, he has thus far managed to identify eleven songs that produce clear memories. He reports that \"[https://youtu.be/hzpDOB2JYKc?si=JdMjCoCy7zAyFtXE 2112 Overture]\" by Rush and \"[https://youtu.be/ORnvO1VyYMk?si=wQzzvrA-u1ZMGwS2 Man on the Silver Mountain]\" by Rainbow also have associated memories, but he is not yet able to play either song well enough to access them.\n\n**Addendum 1:** List of Songs and Associated Memories\n\nThese memories have been placed in approximate chronological order based on their content and the known details of Dr. Scott's life. The description of the memory is a summary of Researcher Carlon's recollection; where appropriate, direct quotations of his audio recordings have been provided for additional context.\n\n||~ Song ||~ Associated Memory ||~ Notes ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/3pVQj2v7tBI?si=E53tTGpmiIzKI3XD Smoke on the Water],\" Deep Purple || Scott is in a music shop. He picks up SCP-8775, one of the display guitars, and plays the first three chords before an employee shouts at him to stop. The employee points at a sign above the counter, which reads \"NO SMOKE ON THE WATER, NO STAIRWAY\". || \"Yeah, of course this is the first song he played on it. That's what I did.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/wIE5wwvicew?si=tp2XvHS1nLnhLXF8 The Boys Are Back in Town],\" Thin Lizzy || Scott is practicing in his bedroom, which is decorated with posters and other memorabilia for various hard rock and heavy metal bands of the 60s and 70s. Scott's father barges in and begins to shout at him for missing football practice. || \"These memories are sort of like those dreams where you just kind of //know// something even though it obviously isn't true. The guy in this one is definitely Dr. Scott's dad, but at the time, I recognized him as mine. It's...jarring.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/F01UTYg79KY?si=jm5yiSA2wx5yiHmC Iron Man],\" Black Sabbath || Once again, Scott is practicing in his bedroom. When he finishes the song, his mother knocks on the door and enters. She compliments his playing but warns him that she will sell the guitar if he does not score an A on his next Calculus test. || \"I think our moms would have gotten along.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/0gjWcnJLIZ0?si=CZmFh0QBqGy7Adzq Baby, I Love Your Way],\" Peter Frampton || Scott stands in front of a large house, playing this song with a small amplifier connected to a jury-rigged car battery. Flowers arranged on the grass in front of Scott read \"Prom?\" A dark-haired girl stands in an open second-story window, blushing and giggling. || \"I think I speak for a lot of guitarists when I say that I first picked up this instrument in hopes of doing some dumb romantic stunt like that. And Conrad, that legend, he pulled it off.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/xxqCEPBDZxk?si=m9cAZBALzzoQ5-Ut Rock 'n' Roll Singer],\" AC/DC || Scott performs in his garage with two other teenagers, a bassist and a drummer. He replaces the lyric \"I hear it pays well\" with \"right here in [[[scp-6976 |Tazewell]]],\"[[footnote]]The name of his hometown.[[/footnote]] to his friends' amusement. || \"His friends called him 'Rad,' like 'radical,' I think. Sometimes they called him 'Connie,' just to get on his nerves.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/f-S3X2saSwM?si=ILD1g_slBzcWEL7l Rock and Roll All Night],\" Kiss || Scott and his bandmates from the previous memory perform beside an in-ground swimming pool at [[[scp-3775 |a house party]]]. The performance ends early when an {{unrecognizable}} teenager starts a drunken altercation with the drummer. || \"There's something...wrong with this one.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/lqSo85W10w4?si=v5tgnmB0obKLqqDV Victim of Changes],\" Judas Priest || Scott sits in his garage, playing quietly. Much of the equipment present in earlier memories, including the drum kit, is now absent. || \"I didn't notice it until afterward, but I cried during this one. I really can't remember why.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/6QjehSa_zDY?si=jDRRgKx09T8MUCjt Electric Phase],\" UFO || Scott sits on his bed in a college dorm, practicing. He continues replaying the record (//Lights Out//), trying to imitate the guitar solo, but is unsuccessful. When his roommate enters, Scott stops playing. || \"He didn't ask me to stop or anything. I just felt...embarrassed?\" ||  \n|| \"[https://youtu.be/Dy4HA3vUv2c?si=VwM3Q4V_J5EoCeAP (Don't Fear) The Reaper],\" Blue Oyster Cult || In his dorm, Scott is attempting to play this song while a blonde woman watches, smiling politely but uncomfortably. He continues to miss notes and eventually gives up entirely upon reaching the solo. He flushes with embarrassment and apologizes repeatedly. || \"Ouch. Been there.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/YXcYZsqkZ-g?si=5IJ9eDwVDB_Mi1se Summertime Blues],\" Blue Cheer || Scott sits on a couch in a small apartment, surrounded by partially unpacked moving boxes. He practices for roughly 20 minutes, until he grows frustrated and stops. || \"He shouldn't have been so hard on himself.\" ||\n|| \"[https://youtu.be/QkF3oxziUI4?si=K8EP8w5kAy5p0vQ- Stairway to Heaven],\" Led Zeppelin || A much older Scott sits in the same apartment, which is now dark and dirty. He struggles to play most of the song and has apparently forgotten the guitar solo, which he spends several minutes unsuccessfully attempting to recall. Eventually, he cries out in frustration and flings the guitar away. It strikes the edge of the coffee table with an unpleasant sound. || None. ||\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Kothardarastrix]]\n> **Filename:** guitar\n> **Name:** guitar\n> **Author:** Kothardarastrix\n> **License:** CC-by-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** Own Work\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
