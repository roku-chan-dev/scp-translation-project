This has always been your name.\n\nYou will now read the following document in its entirety. Press any key to continue.\n\n~$: [[span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"]]a[[/span]]\n\nLoading file...\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Item №:** SCP-5856\n\n**Anomaly Class:** [[span class=\"s\"]]Robertson-Jackal[[/span]]\n\n**Threat Level:** [[span class=\"s\"]]Saddlebrown ##saddlebrown|●##[[/span]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5856 is currently contained by the combined efforts of Containment Team CT-5856 (\"[[span class=\"s\"]]Unfettered Mares[[/span]]\"), of which you are the newest member. You find this normal. It is contained within Containment Complex 5856, which consists of the following main components:\n* R5856/1: [[span class=\"s\"]]The boardroom[[span class=\"s\"]][[/span]][[/span]]. This is the room within which SCP-5856 is contained. It is outfitted with decor and furniture in a style which is considered by some to be socially normal. You find the style to be [[span class=\"s\"]]a tad gaudy[[/span]]. For [[span class=\"s\"]]religious reasons[[/span]], it is located at the centre of the complex, with barred windows to all other rooms and a balcony overlooking [[span class=\"s\"]]washroom  #4[[/span]].\n* R5856/2: [[span class=\"s\"]]The scullery[[/span]]. The purpose of this room is [[span class=\"s\"]]known to every person except yourself[[/span]].\n* R5856/3: [[span class=\"s\"]]Desmond's bedroom[[/span]]. This is the room within which [[span class=\"s\"]]Desmond sleeps[[/span]]. You must never enter this room unless [[span class=\"s\"]]Desmond contacts you via telegram[[/span]]. The room houses a variety of [[span class=\"s\"]]Oriental mannequins[[/span]] and [[span class=\"s\"]]scented candles[[/span]]. The former of these is considered normal to you. You have never witnessed the latter before, and find the concept scary and bewildering. The possession of one or more of the latter objects is [[span class=\"s\"]]punishable by death in your homeland[[/span]]. You will never meet the occupant of this room, as they are currently [[span class=\"s\"]]on an expedition to Peru[[/span]] -- an event to which you were initially invited, but rejected from at the last moment.\n* R5856/4: [[span class=\"s\"]]Bulwark Street Station[[/span]]. This is a shared common area, where you may mingle with the other members of CT-5856. It is outfitted with a [[span class=\"s\"]]coal scuttle[[/span]] and [[span class=\"s\"]]tanning salon[[/span]]. There are complimentary supplies of [[span class=\"s\"]]powdered milk[[/span]], your favourite food. You dislike others eating your favourite food, and [[span class=\"s\"]]often make this known[[/span]].\n* R5856/5: [[span class=\"s\"]]The parlour[[/span]]. This is your private residence, and decorated in a way you find entirely normal and appealing. [[span class=\"s\"]]One[[/span]] of the other members of CT-5856 find(s) your decor to be [[span class=\"s\"]]in poor taste[[/span]], while [[span class=\"s\"]]two[[/span]] others feel it is mildly [[span class=\"s\"]]blasphemous[[/span]]. You care about the opinions of at least two of these people.\nR5856/6 through 12 are the private residences of the other members of CT-5856, whom you are [[span class=\"s\"]]eager to meet[[/span]]. There are also numerous supplementary rooms and installations throughout the complex, the functions of which will likely become clear. The exception to this is [[span class=\"s\"]]the menagerie[[/span]], which has been locked. You wish very much to gain entry, and know that another member of the containment team has the key.\n\nAt the end of your week-long stay in [[span class=\"s\"]]the parlour[[/span]], you will be amnesticised. This is morally and ethically acceptable to you. You may then be administered another course of hypnotic suggestives, re-educated regarding social norms, and reintroduced to an altered version of the complex, alongside multiple people who you may or may not have met before. This is also morally and ethically acceptable to you.\n\nCurrently, the only members of CT-5856 who you have pre-formed opinions of are:\n* [[span class=\"s\"]]Langley deBaucher[[/span]], whom you [[span class=\"s\"]]despise[[/span]] due to [[span class=\"s\"]]your differences in opinion regarding dogs[[/span]].\n* [[span class=\"s\"]]Viscount Charles[[/span]], whom you [[span class=\"s\"]]regard ambivalently[[/span]] due to [[span class=\"s\"]]unspoken sexual tension[[/span]].\n* [[span class=\"s\"]]Zachary F. Callahan[[/span]], whom you [[span class=\"s\"]]wish to marry[[/span]] due to [[span class=\"s\"]]her fabulous antique eggs[[/span]].\nOf those you haven't yet formed opinions of, [[span class=\"s\"]]exactly three[[/span]] have already formed opinions of you.\n\nIn order to contain SCP-5856, you must attempt to [[span class=\"s\"]]befriend Dr. Leopold Franc-Polio[[/span]] and [[span class=\"s\"]]set Langley deBaucher up with a romantic partner[[/span]]. Do not let [[span class=\"s\"]]Li Richter[[/span]] reveal that you are secretly [[span class=\"s\"]]racist[[/span]]. Avoid all contact with [[span class=\"s\"]]the complex's several-hundred gargoyles[[/span]] and deduce the [[span class=\"s\"]]blood type[[/span]] of every person more popular than yourself.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5856 is a sociokinetic and tele-empathic humanoid entity, kept in a state of permanent disorientation within [[span class=\"s\"]]the boardroom[[/span]]. It is capable of manipulating any and all coherent social bonds with entities who know of its existence in any form, which renders it incredibly dangerous and nigh-uncontainable in normal situations. In casual conversation, SCP-5856 may be referred to by you as [[span class=\"s\"]]the secret George[[/span]]. You find this normal. It will remain a non-threat so long as the Special Containment Procedures above are upheld.\n\nThe SCP Foundation thanks you for your part in these procedures. Please now return to your quarters. The remainder of CT-5856 will join you for dinner at [[span class=\"s\"]]1800 hours[[/span]]. Your [[span class=\"s\"]]ceremonial sceptre[[/span]] and [[span class=\"s\"]]Auckland 2004 Yellow Pages telephone directory[[/span]] will arrive shortly. They are familiar items to you, and your first instinct regarding their use is entirely correct.\n\n----\n\n**{{End of file.}}**\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5855]]] | SCP-5856 | [[[SCP-5857]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
