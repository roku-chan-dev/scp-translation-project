Guides have been chosen by the Staff as either required reading for applicants, or useful enough to be on a short list of recommended reading.  Essays are all of the documents of this type that have not been chosen as Guides.\n\n**Q:** Does that mean Essays are not as good or useful as Guides?\n**A:** Not necessarily.  The list of required/recommended reading is intentionally kept manageably short, so there is lots of good information here that is not \"official.\"\n\n**Q:** Can anyone write an Essay?\n**A:** Sure, but it will have a Rating Module on it, and is subject to the same voting rules as other pages.  If the membership doesn't like it, it will be deleted.\n\n**Q:** What do I do if I think my Essay should really be a Guide?\n**A:** Ask a member of the Senior Staff/Mods/Admins.  They will raise it for Staff discussion.\n\n**Q:** So if these are the Essays, where are the Guides?\n**A:**  Here: http://www.scp-wiki.net/guide-hub There are also some on the drop-down menu and the sidebar on all the site pages.\n\n**Unofficial Tips for Writing SCPs**\n\nSome of these are general advice, while others are intended to help you write a specific kind of SCP.\n\n[[[rules-of-thumb | Rules of Thumb]]] – Various tips that experienced SCP writers have found usually work out well.\n\n[[[random-but-useful | Random But Useful]]] – Miscellaneous tips on SCP writing from Quikngruvn.\n\n[[[mackenzie-tips | Dr. Mackenzie's Documentation Tips]]] – Tips on SCP writing from Raven MacKenzie a.k.a.
