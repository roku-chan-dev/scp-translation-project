The current District Council Member is Mr. Tang Wing-man.\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/new-cha-ling/NCL-flag.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThe flag of New Cha Ling before the takeover of the British Hong Kong government.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n||||~ New Cha Ling||\n||||~ [wikipedia:Kwun_Tong_District_Council Constituency of Kwun Tong District Council]||\n||~ Code: ||J0||\n||~ Scope: ||Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen and Ha Cha Ling Tsuen||\n||~ Population: ||1569||\n||~ No. of Electors: ||654||\n||~ District Council Member:||TANG Wing-man||\n||~ Political Affiliation: ||[[[http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/concern-group-for-cha-ling-people-s-livelihood|Concern Group For Cha Ling People's Livelihood]]]||\n||~ Polling Station: ||Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen Office, Ha Cha Ling Tsuen Office||\n||~ Area: ||1.25 km^^2^^||\n\n\n+ Scope, Traffic, and Geography\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\nThe constituency consists of Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen and Ha Cha Ling Tsuen. The three portals are located in Cha Kwo Ling. As of 2011, to pass through one of these portals, an individual must meet at least one of the following criteria:\n\n> # Resident of Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen or Ha Cha Ling Tsuen\n> # Member or former member of Zero Team, Royal Hong Kong Police\n> # Member of NCL Police Station\n\nThere are other paranormal methods to enter New Cha Ling, but they are classified under the Veil Protocol. According to this protocol, as New Cha Ling is designated as a Free Port, anomaly-associated persons (AAPs) will not be prevented from using alternative methods to enter New Cha Ling.\n\nMost of the structures in Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen and Ha Cha Ling Tsuen are two-storey village houses, and some are still squatters.\n\nAs a pocket dimension, its weather and time are synchronised to Cha Kwo Ling. The portals are guarded by three to four patrolmen, only prohibiting known criminals from entering.\n\nThe main road, linking all parts of New Cha Ling, is known as the \"New Cha Ling Road\". There is a local private company \"Lukluk\" running the A05 [wikipedia:Public_light_bus minibus] route as the transportation.\n\nThe construction of this dimension is considered related to the paratech mentioned in [[[wong-magical-book|DOC-E0579]]]. For relevant information, you can refer to the electronic copy of that file.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ History\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\nThe history of New Cha Ling began in the mid-1940s. At that time, due to a large influx of refugees into Hong Kong, they decided to build squatters in the foothills. The quarrying industry had been developed in Cha Kwo Ling since 1922, primarily producing kaolin clay. Therefore, some AAPs chose to create New Cha Ling as a place to live. With limited time, the construction of New Cha Ling was very crude and kept to a minimum. As a result, the weather and time of New Cha Ling are still synchronised to Cha Kwo Ling.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation period, the Japanese army did not discover the existence of New Cha Ling and it became the base of the guerrilla forces. The main force was the \"Cha Ling Guard\", organised by the New Cha Ling residents. These partisans were the predecessors of the \"People's Congress of New Cha Ling\".\n\nDuring the 1940s and 50s, New Cha Ling was in a state of anarchy, similar to the situation of the Kowloon Walled City in the 70s, there was a resident-formed committee called the \"People's Congress of New Cha Ling\". Though the committee's name references the Chinese Government, it actually had no connection to the Chinese Government, and the area remained ungoverned.\n\nIn 1955, a conflict occurred between the recently-arrived New Cha Ling residents (Shanghai Gang) and other residents (Yuet Dong Gang). At the time, most of the Shanghai Gang lived in newly built squatters (later Ha Cha Ling Tsuen), while the Yuet Dong Gang lived in Cha Ling Tsuen (later Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen). In the end, some radical Shanghai Gang members committed an arson attack on Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen. Since abnormal ignition devices were used, the fire spread quickly. The situation was eventually controlled by the People's Congress of New Cha Ling who possessed firearms and better mobility. As a result, the Shanghai Gang was expelled from New Cha Ling. Relocating to the Kowloon Walled City, they became one of the major paranormal forces there at that time. This caused a poor relationship between the gangs in Kowloon Walled City and New Cha Ling, especially the residents of Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen. This also provoked the establishment of New Cha Ling Fire Station, which remains in service in the present day.\n\nIn 1961, two abnormal suspects fled into New Cha Ling to evade capture by the Royal Hong Kong Police Zero Team (known as the Hong Kong Police Zero Team at the time). Members of Zero Team pursuing them used alternative methods to enter the area and discovered the existence of New Cha Ling. Subsequently, following orders from the Governor of Hong Kong and MI666, New Cha Ling was officially placed under the jurisdiction of British Hong Kong. Zero Team became responsible for maintaining law and order within the area, and most members of the People's Congress of New Cha Ling joined Zero Team. Notably, the takeover was relatively peaceful, without any resistance from the locals, and the Chinese government at the time also agreed to this action.\n\n[[# toc1]]\n\nFrom 1975 onward, Vietnamese refugees began sneaking into Hong Kong by boat, with some of them being members of Vietnamese anomalous groups. A portion of these people were then relocated to New Cha Ling, reaching a peak of 146 people in 1979. Due to the language barrier and the influx of population, conflict arose between the refugees and the residents. Consequently, an application was submitted to MI666 by Zero Team to establish the \"New Cha Ling Detention Centre\" (now rebuilt as New Cha Ling Community Centre) to accommodate the Vietnamese boat people. However, in 1992, a riot known as the New Cha Ling Refugee Camp Fire broke out, resulting in the arrest of 28 refugees, as well as 5 fatalities and 37 injuries requiring hospitalisation. This event was the largest paranormal crime to occur in Hong Kong during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1997, with the Handover of Hong Kong, the jurisdiction of New Cha Ling was also transferred. According to the usual practice of the People's Republic of China for managing anomalous regions, they would be under the control of the \"Investigation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China\". However, with the implementation of \"One Country, Two Systems\", Zero Team was restructured into New Cha Ling Police Station, with its responsibilities shifting from containing and overseeing abnormal affairs in Hong Kong to maintaining law and order in New Cha Ling.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ History of Election\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\nNew Cha Ling was one of the first batch of district council constituencies and is also the smallest constituency in Hong Kong. The number of electors in the district is actually not sufficient to be designated as a separate constituency. However, considering the anomalous nature of the district, the British Hong Kong government granted special permission to designate it as an independent constituency in 1982.\n\nDue to the Veil Protocol, this constituency would not appear on the regular constituency map. Abnormal humanoids cannot be candidates except for those designated as low-risk Type Blue. Additionally, the elected District Council Member would join the District Council as an //ex officio// member, falsely identified as the chairman of the \"Cha Kwo Ling Rural Committee\".\n\nIn the Legislative Council election, the vote of New Cha Ling would be counted under the Kowloon East constituency. The polling stations are located at Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen Office and Ha Cha Ling Tsuen Office. Three New Cha Ling residents have stood for election in the Legislative Council elections, but none were elected.\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ Infrastructure and Communications\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\nThe network of New Cha Ling is fully and mutually connected to external networks, including the Internet, and is provided by an independent Internet service provider, Cha Ling Network Inc. However, all information related to the anomalous, including related to New Cha Ling, is blocked in compliance with the Veil Protocol.\n\nCha Ling Post Office is located at 72 New Cha Ling. The office originally is a private organisation and transformed into a public-private partnership in 1998. Its main service is to deliver letters and packages from other anomalous regions, as there is no official postal service from the mundane world to New Cha Ling. Mail such as water bills, electricity bills, and tax bills are sent to Kwun Tong Post Office first and then passed on to New Cha Ling Police Station to be distributed by station members.\n\nAlthough both water and electricity are supplied to New Cha Ling from the external world, it has its own independent electrical substation. The cable and pipes were laid and connected by the NCL Police Station, cooperating with local paratechnicians to address the anomalous properties of the location. Therefore, electricity and water charges are the same as those outside and are paid directly to the respective departments.\n\nPak Chai Hospital opened in 2000 is the first public hospital in New Cha Ling. Though it is the smallest among the public hospitals, it is the only hospital that provides Elan-Vital Energy Treatment. \n[[/collapsible]]\n+ Law & Order\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n[[size large]]**Police**[[/size]]\n\nDespite the small size and low population of New Cha Ling, it is still a separate police district. Currently, **N**ew **C**ha **L**ing District (**NCL**) is under the Kowloon East Regional of Hong Kong Police Force, responsible for maintaining law and order in New Cha Ling.\n||||~ New Cha Ling District||\n||~ Establishment: ||25/8/1997||\n||~ Scale: ||68 people||\n||~ Answer to: ||[wikipedia:Structure_of_the_Hong_Kong_Police_Force Kowloon East Region]||\n||~ Headquarters: ||55 Sheung Cha Ling Tsuen||\n||~ Commander: ||WONG Hoi-sek||\n\nNew Cha Ling is currently the smallest and least populous police district in Hong Kong, earning it the nickname \"Mini District\" among the residents. However, due to its exceptional effectiveness in dealing with paracrimes, it has also been praised as \"compact yet powerful\".[[footnote]]Three Portlands Post, 5/9/2005.[[/footnote]] Its involvement in the infamous \"Orient Spirit Case\" remains its most renowned accomplishment. Two suspects, the final members of the organised crime known as \"the Chicago Spirit\", were apprehended by local police officers upon fleeing to New Cha Ling and subsequently extradited to Three Portland.\n\n[[size large]]**District Court**[[/size]]\n\nNew Cha Ling District Court, formerly the Paranormal Affairs Court, was established in 1926 and was once the largest tribunal for paranormal cases in Hong Kong. However, after the handover and subsequent changes in the related department, the court has been transformed into a district court primarily responsible for handling civil and criminal litigation cases related to New Cha Ling, including supernatural and non-supernatural matters.\n\n[[size large]]**New Cha Ling Fire Station**[[/size]]\n\nNew Cha Ling Fire Station was a civic firefighting organisation that was initially established by the \"People's Congress of New Cha Ling\" in 1956. It was later incorporated into the government and became the current New Cha Ling Fire Station. All members of the station are locals. As of 2015, there were 40 recorded firemen on file.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ Economy\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\nCurrently, the main sector of the economy is focused on services and handicrafts. These handicrafts would be exported to other anomalous regions, with the major export markets being Taixi, Three Portlands and Hy-Brasil.\n\n[[size large]]**Hong Kong Glaze Ceramics**[[/size]]\n\nNew Cha Ling previously produced and exported ceramics intended for everyday use on a large scale. However, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this light industry faced tough competition from manufacturers in mainland China. Consequently, most ceramics workshops shifted towards a high-end market, promoting \"characteristic hand-painted ceramics\" as their signature product, which proved to be highly successful. Currently, the ceramic manufacturing industry sells its products as far away as Three Portland and has also collaborated with Lofia Inc.\n\nSince very few locations in the area produce food, the food is mainly imported from other anomalous regions. However, in order to provide a stable food source, the District Council member initiated the \"Rooftop Farming\" campaign, which involved using simple methods to cultivate fruits and vegetables. The harvested crops are then sold at New Cha Ling Wholesale Vegetable Market. The campaign has been significantly effective, with local vegetable production now accounting for 24.3% of the total supply in New Cha Ling.\n\nHong Kong Dollars are the major currency.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ Education\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\nThere is one secondary school and one primary school, New Cha Ling Secondary School and New Sze Shan Primary School, operating in the district. All local students study in these schools.\n\n[[size large]]**New Cha Ling Secondary School**[[/size]]\n\nNew Cha Ling Secondary School, built in 1985, was an ordinary English-Medium-of-Instruction School, subsequently switched to Chinese-Medium-of-Instruction in 1999. It now mainly recruits school-aged students from New Cha Ling and offers a night school program for part-time students. There are also boarding students from other anomalous regions. New Cha Ling Secondary School is one of the few aided schools in Hong Kong that includes the additional subject of Paranormal Science in the basic science curriculum, and Fundamental Religious and Occult Studies in the arts stream.\n\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/new-cha-ling/yearbook.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThe picture of the second graduation class dated in the Sze Shan Primary School yearbook, some of them later became teachers at New Sze Shan Primary School.\nUpper text: The picture of the second graduation class\nLower text: (The pictures of the first, third and fourth graduation classes are missing.)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[size large]]**New Sze Shan Primary School**[[/size]]\n\nSze Shan Primary School established in 1951, was originally located in Cha Kwo Ling. It closed down in the 1980s due to under-enrollment. Subsequently, some of the teachers and alumni established New Sze Shan Primary School in New Cha Ling. In addition to upholding the educational vision and mission of the original school, the curriculum incorporates paranormal knowledge into subjects such as Visual Arts, Information Technology and General Studies. It is the first batch of primary schools that use paranormal resources in teaching.\n\nIt is noteworthy that although the local School-sponsoring Bodies are deeply connected to the paranormal, the curriculum generally still follows the Education Bureau's instruction with some extension.\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ Famous Attractions and Architecture\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[size large]]**New Cha Ling Police Station**[[/size]]\n\nNew Cha Ling Police Station is the former office of Zero Team, the paranormal law enforcement agency under the Royal Hong Kong Police, in the British Hong Kong era. While Zero Team was dismissed in 1995, the HKSAR reorganised it into Cha Ling District. Zero Team's office was renovated into New Cha Ling Police Station which started operation on 30th November 1997. Witnessing Hong Kong's supernatural history, it was officially designated as a \"declared monument\" by the Antiquities and Monuments Office in 2001.\n\n[[size large]]**Hoi Yuen Grocery Store**[[/size]]\n\nHoi Yuen Grocery Store opened in 1947 and now mainly sells groceries. It is known for its old-fashioned decoration and goods, and some of its non-anomalous tools and sundries were donated to the Hong Kong Museum of History as collections.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+ Related Article\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"name\" tags=\" +new-cha-ling \" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=minmasterqw, translated by Mang Gwan and Jerden]]\n> **Filename:** Regional_Emblem_of_Hong_Kong.svg\n> **Author:** Mike Rohsopht\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Regional_Emblem_of_Hong_Kong.svg Wikipedia]\n\n> **Filename:** yearbook.jpg\n> **Author:** [[user minmasterqw]]\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://minmasterqwtest2.wikidot.com/tea 張道士的私人沙盒]\n> **Additional Notes:** The author claimed the image is a retake of the Sze Shan Primary School yearbook.\n\n> **Filename:** NCL-flag.png\n> **Author:** [[user Miziquan]]\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://minmasterqwtest2.wikidot.com/tea 張道士的私人沙盒]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
