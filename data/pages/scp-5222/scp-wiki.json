Despite this transitory period taking roughly three days, and the relative location of the teams to the baseline world being traversable in only 20 minutes, both teams were lost. All 264 members are considered lost and have been awarded the Foundation Silver Star for Distinguished Service.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5221]]] | SCP-5222 | [[[SCP-5223]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
