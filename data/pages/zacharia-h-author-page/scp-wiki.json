While typically a first responder in his capacity as a covert operative, the agent has been called on to conduct forensic investigations after clearing of potentially high-risk anomalous hazards by specialised response teams.\n\nAgent \"H\" answers to FIA coordinators at Site-151 [[footnote]]Refer to Secure Facility Dossier: Site-151 for additional information.[[/footnote]], to which he reports in person following the initial containment of an SCP item with which he has been involved. He has been highly active in the field since his recruitment and has a Cartwright clearance rate [[footnote]]Ratio of total reports of distinct anomalies investigated to total distinct anomalous items contained as a result of said investigations. Used as a rough grade of overall competency for FIA operatives.[[/footnote]] of approximately 60%.\n\n/> {{search scpnet database (tags: scp, zacharia-h)__}}\n\n/> {{Loading...}}\n\n**Displaying list of items tagged: __scp, zacharia-h__:**\n\n> [[[SCP-2194]]] **- Filth**\n> \n> //\"Do you think there's more of that stuff, doctor?
