I just wanted to put in a bit of quick info regarding using the content of Demasqed outside of... well, Demasqed. As with everything else I have ever put on this site, fan-art is always always always super appreciated! In fact, if there is any fan-art made, I'll add a section to this hub specifically for fan-art (with permission of the artists of course). Regarding using the characters or original creations from the series, I'd prefer you asked me before doing anything (I will almost 100% say yes), and my only hard no is that I don't want anyone to write an SCP for the Narrator Hornets. Other than that, yeah, please do what you want, and please let me know if you do make something for the series because I absolutely love seeing that stuff! Okay, enough of this, on to the actual hub!\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[size 200%]]Synopsis[[/size]]\nSet at the top of the Broken Masquerade canon, Demasqed follows the stories of two researchers trying to solve the mystery of a project gone awry, and a team of ill-equipped scientists struggling to handle the unfamiliar openness of the Foundation and make a good first impression with the public.\n\n[[size 200%]]Storyline[[/size]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ **Act I**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[pineapple-cognitohazard| Scene I]]]\n+++++ \"Pineapple Cognitohazard\"\n\n//He pours the drink out of the shaker - a frothy yellow sludge that fills Evelyn's glass to the brim.//\n\nRelease Date: May 27th, 2020\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[shuffle-puppies| Scene II]]]\n+++++ \"Shuffle Puppies\"\n\n//Chandler looked through the cabinets, but he could not find the delicious mixture of berries and assorted nuts that the Hornets so desperately craved.//\n\nRelease Date: June 3rd, 2020\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[therapy-tacos| Scene III]]]\n+++++ \"Therapy Tacos\"\n\n//They're not called \"talk-Os\" for nothing.//\n\nRelease Date: June 10th, 2020\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[fluffy-little-kitty| Scene IV]]]\n+++++ \"Fluffy Little Kitty\"\n\n//Jesus, sometimes I forget how human you are.//\n\nRelease Date: June 17th, 2020\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[sci-fi-shenanigans| Scene V]]]\n+++++ \"Sci-Fi Shenanigans\"\n\n//The people want answers, and you need to be prepared to give them.//\n\nRelease Date: June 24th, 2020\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[partition| Scene VI]]]\n+++++ \"Glass Partition\"\n\n//I know what you're doing, Dana.//\n\nRelease Date: July 1st, 2020\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ **Act II**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"scene-block\"]]\n+++ [[[safety-reasons| Scene I]]]\n+++++ \"Safety Reasons\"\n\n//It's all for the greater good!

The show ran at the beginning of December 2022 at the Merrick Theatre in Waltham, Massachusetts, and was a huge success! As soon as we get our recording of the show edited, I'll be posting it as a tale and uploading it here, but thank you to everyone who helped it get this far!\n-----\n[[size 200%]] 2023 Mini Update [[/size]]\nSoonâ„¢\n-----\n[[size 200%]] 2024 Update [[/size]]\n[[collapsible show=\"So let's talk about audio for a second.\" hide=\"So let's talk about audio for a second.\"]]\n\nAudio is arguably more important than visuals. The average person would be perfectly happy watching a video with crisp, clean audio in 240p, but would be a lot less happy to watch something with crappy audio in 4k 1080p.\n\nUnfortunately, that's sort of the situation we've been dealing with when it comes to the Demasqed recordings. Our mic packs didn't record properly, so the only audio we have comes from the video cameras themselves.\n\nI have the recordings. I have messed around with the audio hundreds of times over the past year and a half. But no matter what I do, the audio doesn't sound good. It's incredibly frustrating, and quite disheartening as well.\n\nI am not giving up. I WILL turn this footage into a high quality, watchable, edited video. But I can no longer promise that it will happen soon.\n\nThat's all for now. Thanks again for all your care and support on this series.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n**Image 1**\n> **Filename:** //coverhalf//\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user Henzoid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://www.scpwiki.com/local--files/demasqed/coverhalf The SCP Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
