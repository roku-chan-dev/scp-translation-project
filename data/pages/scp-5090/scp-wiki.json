A Faraday cage hardwired to the Foundation intranet is to be positioned around the enclosure to restrict public access to SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C. Disinformation campaigns regarding the sites are to be launched to settle any possible sightings of SCP-5090 before Foundation intervention. SCP-5090-1 is to be fed one loggerhead turtle egg daily, and supplied a dish of saltwater, to be exchanged for fresh saltwater every two weeks.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5090 is a Wide Area Network server. No evidence of external hardware which operates SCP-5090 exists; instead, SCP-5090 is entirely operated by SCP-5090-1. It has been concluded that SCP-5090 and SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C operate based on the daily actions of SCP-5090-1.\n\nSCP-5090-1 is a colony of Atlantic ghost crabs (//Ocypodinae quadrata//) which previously resided on Scotch Beach, Block Island, Rhode Island (see addendum 1). SCP-5090-1 appears to be sapient; it is concluded that SCP-5090-1 collectively has the equivalent intelligence of a seven-year-old human child. SCP-5090's exact method of creation is unknown, although enough evidence has led to the conclusion that SCP-5090-1 created it through telecommunication. SCP-5090-1 will interact with users of SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C, appearing to perceive users as other animals in the area. \n\nSCP-5090-A, SCP-5090-B, and SCP-5090-C are websites created by SCP-5090-1. One or more of these websites will appear in a user's browser history and/or bookmarks before the user had accessed these websites in the first place. Visiting SCP-5090-A through SCP-5090-C will automatically connect the user to SCP-5090.\n\nSCP-5090-A is a blog-style website accessible by the domain www.turtleeggtime.crab, mainly consisting of posts about the daily lives of SCP-5090-1.\n\nSCP-5090-B is a video sharing website accessible by the domain www.digfromdanger.crab. Despite its intended purpose, SCP-5090-B contains few videos posted by SCP-5090-1. SCP-5090-1 mainly interacts with users through the community tab, and commenting on works uploaded by other users.\n\nSCP-5090-C is an educational webpage consisting of interactive media with the purpose of educating school age children that is accessible by the domain www.sand.crab.\n\n**Addendum 1.1: SCP-5090-1 Interaction Pre Containment**\n\nOn 07/06/2019 Dr. Marigold and Researcher Crane accessed SCP-5090-A and SCP-5090-B to interact with SCP-5090-1 before containment. Dr. Marigold went under the alias //\"Crabgirl19\"//, and Researcher Crane went under the alias //\"Puzzledhearts\"//.\n\n> **ghostysandgvhbj**\n> \n> turtle egg or bug\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **egg4lyfe**\n> \n> egg\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> \n> Eggs sound healthy.\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **burrowsfromdangerssss**\n> \n> Why does a ross goose say egg eating good you a goose\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> \n> They're not my eggs.\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **egg4lyfe**\n> \n> weird goose\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **Licorice_0_3_0**\n> \n> what animal am I\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **dancecrabsand**\n> \n> stupid butterfish dont know what it is\n> haha\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> \n> where do you guys live\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> \n> A bit on the nose, crab girl.\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **ghostysandgvhbj**\n> \n> habitat\n> block\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> \n> you didn't block me\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **ghostysandgvhbj**\n> \n> block\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> \n> okay\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> \n> nosey box crab\n> \n> stand by your crab brethren\n> no nose\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> \n> what the fuck how do you know the word brethren\n>  \n> ------\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> \n> what does that mean\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> \n> I love you all\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **theportraitjudges**\n> \n> I know they're so cute right\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **burrowsfromdangerssss**\n> \n> I am not cute catbird\n> \n> fierce crab\n\nClosing statement: the animals mentioned in the log by SCP-5090-1 led to the conclusion that it resided in Rhode Island. SCP-5090-1 mentioning \"block\" appears to be a reference to Block Island, Rhode island.\n\n**Addendum 1.2: SCP-5090-1 Interaction Post Containment**\n\nThe following is the comment section of a video uploaded to SCP-5090-B titled \"life\". The video depicts two members of SCP-5090-1 sitting in containment for fifteen minutes.\n\n> //Uploaded by ocean-survival on 08/12/2019//\n> \n> **Video description:**\n> \n> today life update\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Crabgirl19**##\n> cool\n> \n> **egg4lyfe**\n> //Response to Crabgirl19:// thanks I was in it\n> \n> ------\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> Do you two have any hobbies?\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> //Response to Puzzledhearts:// yes I like hunting for eggs but I cant do it a lot anymore because I am in cage thing but it is okay I have friends\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> //Response to ocean-survival:// Cage? what do you mean, lad?\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> //Response to Puzzledhearts:// I was at the sea with my friends but then I wasnt\n> I am not sure what happened but now I am not in the sea\n> I still have my friends though\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> //Response to ocean-survival:// [[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/messaging-crustaceans | How are you all adjusting to the change?]]]\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> //Response to Puzzledhearts:// adjusting?\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> //Response to ocean-survival:// how are you taking the change, in short.\n> \n> **ocean-survival**\n> //Response to Puzzledhearts:// nosy ross goose\n> but you nice\n> most okay with it\n> Mossy is very confused though\n> she doesnt like change but we try to tell her it okay cause were all together\n> \n> ##blue|**Puzzledhearts**##\n> //Response to ocean-survival:// I see.
