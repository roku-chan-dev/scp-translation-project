Mice (He/She)[[footnote]]John or Max are also appropriate, //Kingsley// is really more of a character.[[/footnote]]\n**Object Class:** Keter [[footnote]]breaking containment right fucking now!!![[/footnote]]\n**Description:** Dr. Kingsley Mice is a weird little bug or perhaps a rodent that, via jumping on random keys of a keyboard, has coincidentally produced vaguely readable material. While he will escape any containment cell she's put in, he can be easily swayed back into containment by promises of food and chicken themed memorabilia.\n\nIn all seriousness, I got into SCP around 2022(? I'm not good with dates but I know it's been a while.) I went to one of those High Schools that gave out tablets to everyone (Gen Z babyyyy), and I became fascinated with the worlds and characters. I hope to leave my own little mark on the wiki :3\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=BirdShelf|\n    caption=BEHOLD\n]]\nI also collect chicken figures this is very important for you to know about me!\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 1.5em]]**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/no-love-hub No Love For A Dead Man]**[[/size]]\nMy overly ambitious 4 Act white whale project.
