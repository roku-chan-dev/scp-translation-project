It is characterized by the proliferation of a figure likely drawn with chalk and commonly understood to represent a \"stickman\", referred to as SCP-369-FR-1 from now on.\n\nSCP-369-FR-1 instances seem to be able to appear on all types of surface, such as rock, glass or skin, even though it would normally be impossible to use chalk on this surface.\n\nIt is impossible to interact with SCP-369-FR-1 instances, as they seem to be inanimate and proliferate randomly by replicating on nearby available surfaces; they are able to overlap. It is also impossible to erase them --or isolate them--.\n\nThe SCP-369-FR phenomenon has never been observed in our universe, and the several information obtained on its behaviour come from expeditions and observations done on reduced windows of universe BC-98247-Z.\nThis universe, to which the Foundation gained an access following event [REDACTED], is characterized by a temporal speed relatively faster than the one of our world, that is to say one second in our universe corresponds to approximately half a day in BC-98247-Z. Thanks to that, observation of SCP-369-FR was made possible during two (2) milleniums, two thousand, two hundreds ans seventy-eight (2278) days to be precise, which corresponds to about twenty (20) days in our universe. However, observations and expeditions were limited to approximately ten seconds because of the equipment used.\n\nSCP-369-FR was observed for the first time during an expedition in universe BC-98247-Z that was initialy carried to estimate the number of divergence chains. Agent Solveig noticed a SCP-369-FR-1 instance on a brick wall in the municipality of [DATA EXPUNGED], France, and saw its first duplication approximately thirty-seven (37) seconds later. During the following expedition, which occured one hundred and fifty (150) years later (that is to say seven (7) hours in our universe), it was confirmed that the whole town was covered in SCP-369-FR-1 instances.\n\nDuring the last expedition, two thousand, two hundreds and seventy-eight (2278) years after the initial discovery, SCP-369-FR was covering 75% of Earth's surface, including all of emerged lands. Universe BC-98247-Z was then populated with only a hundred humans still alive, all grouped on a boat drifting in the middle of the Indian Ocean[[footnote]]As no mean for SCP-369-FR to kill people has ever been observed yet, the way human population was brought to extinction following the spreading of the phenomenon is still unknown.[[/footnote]]. As several instances of SCP-369-FR-1 were present in the wedge, it is estimated that to this day the boat is probably covered in instances and that Mankind has become extinct in universe BC-98247-Z.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Note from Dr. Martin following the 12/07/2018 investigations\" hide=\"Note from Dr. Martin following the 12/07/2018 investigations\"]]\n> Due to the urgency of the situation if SCP-369-FR was to appear in our universe, the first SCP-369-FR-1 instance was searched in this house in [DATA EXPUNGED].\n> It was there, on the adjacent wall where it was found in universe BC-98247-Z.\n> A way to contain it was tried: we circled it with a chalk circle. I don't know who had the idea, but it seemed to be the most obvious solution.\n> The thing is, it worked: the instance did not replicate. We've been watching it for two months, and nothing indicates it can spread.\n> There is //a priori// no reason to find a SCP-369-FR instance elsewhere. It seems we've put this universe out of danger.\n> [[>]]\n> - Dr. Martin\n> [[/>]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: 350px; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 25%; TOP: 150px;\"]]\n> **//I are complete creature, just like you, and we am not limited to physical surfaces.//**\n> **//Thanks for freeing us from this cursed circle.//**\n> **//As a gesture of my gratitude, and to be assured that you will not tell where we am hiding, we will spare you.//**\n> **//Now, please close that.//**\n> **//And forget us.//**\n> **//You will see me again soon enough.//**\n> **//I are not going to forget you.//**\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 80%; TOP: 190px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 20%; TOP: 190px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 10%; TOP: 350px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 85%; TOP: 210px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 90%; TOP: 100px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 5%; TOP: 55px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 25%; TOP: 85px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 12%; TOP: 450px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 3%; TOP: 550px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 5%; TOP: 560px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 15%; TOP: 650px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 75%; TOP: 530px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 85%; TOP: 600px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 15%; TOP: 10px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 20%; TOP: 630px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 60%; TOP: 5px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 40%; TOP: 500px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 55%; TOP: 250px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 50%; TOP: 100px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"height: auto; width: auto; overflow-y:auto; z-index: 99; position: fixed; left: 40%; TOP: 30px;\"]]\n[[image stickman.png width=\"150px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include component:license-box\n|author=Aloices]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** stickman_mur_c.png\n> **Name:** rock-wood-texture-wall-soil-brick-material-concrete-geology-brickwork-lake-dusia-the-background-1179872.jpg\n> **Author:** Unknown/edited by [[*user Al_W0onder]]\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** [https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1179872 PxHere]\n\n> **Filename:** stickman.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Al_W0onder]]\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/scp-369-fr Fondation SCP]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
