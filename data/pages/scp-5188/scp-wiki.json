While the danger to civilians presented by SCP-5188 is negligible, public acknowledgement of its anomalous qualities would lead to a potential Lifted Veil scenario.\n\nFor research purposes, one television at Site-59 is to receive and record uninhibited broadcasts of SCP-5188. Transcription efforts by research staff are ongoing.\n\n[[[SCP-2803]]]-A is not to be made aware of Foundation suppression efforts for SCP-5188 under any circumstances. In addition, SCP-2803-A is to receive a monthly supply of forged fan mail for SCP-5188 and a \"royalty payment\" consisting two kilograms of a 50/50 blend of sand and pink glitter. [[footnote]] Due to misinformation protocols, SCP-2803-A is under the belief that this substance is called \"royal sturple\" and is the most precious form of human currency, reserved only for a handful of social elites. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5188 is \"Fronglyfoot Street\", an animated[[footnote]] It should be noted that the \"true\" iteration, SCP-5188-Gamma, is live-action. [[/footnote]] situation comedy produced by TotleighSoft corporation. Episodes are 22 minutes long; at time of writing, 108 episodes and nine seasons have been recorded at Site-59.\n\nSCP-5188 makes use of TotleighSoft's signature \"Snoflak-o-Vizhon\", a perception-altering technique that tailors the show's content to match each viewer's personal preferences for entertainment.  Despite the claim that \"no two [people] will see the [same show]\",[[footnote]] Approximation from a //TV Guide// advertisement; original text was spelled too poorly to be precisely identified. [[/footnote]] identical transcriptions of SCP-5188 between similarly-minded researchers have been noted. Currently, the highest number of recorded variants to an individual episode (including SCP-5188-Gamma) is 57. \n\nThe show centers around the Fronglyfoots, a family consisting of the male protagonist, his wife, their precocious two-year-old daughter, and a dog. All other factors (such as the characters' names, occupations, location, financial class, supporting characters, and whether or not the dog is capable of speech) depend on the individual iteration.\n\nIn addition, viewers who possess a nerve bundle [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2998 previously identified] as a \"Rosetta cluster\" will be immune to the perception-altering effects; the resulting show will be SCP-5188-Gamma.\n\n+++ Addendum: Transcription Excerpt from Season 4, Episode 11, Scene 1\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-5188-12]]\n**Transcriber:** Junior Researcher N.
