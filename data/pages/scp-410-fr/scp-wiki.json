A copy of SCP-410-FR, as well as the entire bibliography of PoI-410, is however available to Level 3 and above personnel in the context of research for purposes of containment; please contact the Site-Kybian Documentary Archives for more information.\n\nAny outside mention of the places and people mentioned in the first part of SCP-410-FR in the Foundation's documentation should be reported to Prof. Camille Fournier. For this purpose, a Foundation webcrawler (I/O-MANDELA) is in charge of monitoring the database, especially the documentation concerning the research of the Department of Extra-Universal Affairs (Multi-U). Similarly, a copy of SCP-410-FR is available exclusively to its members for comparison with extra-dimensional findings.\n\nThe events potentially described in the second part of SCP-410-FR are to be identified and catalogued by the Department of History. Their cover-up is unnecessary, since the French government has taken care to cover up the remaining traces of the various cases during the application of the Veil Protocol. SCP-410-FR allows, if necessary, to discredit them by making them appear to be fictions written by Person of Interest #410.\n\nBecause of its current state and non-anomalous nature, PoI-410 does not require containment. He is currently buried in the Parisian cemetery of Bagneux.\n\n**Description:** SCP-410-FR is the collective designation of a collection of texts published posthumously in 1911 under the title __//Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician, neo-scientific novel//, followed by //Speculations//__. SCP-410-FR is the work of PoI-410, a French writer and poet of the 19^^th^^ century named Alfred Henri Jarry.\n\nThe first part of SCP-410-FR is a novelistic work, notably foundational to the 'Pataphysics [//sic//] movement[[footnote]] Note for personnel affiliated with narrative anomaly research: 'Pataphysics here has a different meaning than pataphysics as defined within the Foundation. [[/footnote]], absurdist philosophical current [[footnote]] Defined in SCP-410-FR as \"the science of imaginary solutions, which symbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their virtuality, to their lineaments\". [[/footnote]] mixing poetry, wordplay and pseudo-scientific demonstrations.\n\nThe particularity of at least ██ of the 70 texts in the second part of SCP-410-FR, //Speculations//, is that they seem to refer to various anomalous events that occurred between 1886 and 1907. PoI-410 is therefore suspected of having been involved in a large amount of anomalous activity during its lifetime.\n\nSCP-410-FR was considered non-anomalous until ██/██/1987, when the Foundation's Department of History initiated the assimilation of a significant portion of the [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/gendastrerie-centre French Gendastrerie] archives. During the operation, it became apparent that a relatively large number of anomalous events had taken place over a period of about twenty years in northwestern France.\n\nInitially thought to be solely the result of a breakdown in local normality[[footnote]] Refer to Dr. Jacob Sertannet's work regarding [[[SCP-236-FR]]] for more information about reality rates. [[/footnote]], it became apparent that these events were remarkably similar to those found in SCP-410-FR. Subsequent analysis led to the theory that PoI-410 was partly responsible for these phenomena and had mastered anomalous writing methods.\n\nHowever, on ██/██/2002, extensive research led by Prof. Fournier following the discovery of a document written by PoI-410 determined that Alfred Jarry had in fact participated in the destruction of the anomalies mentioned in SCP-410-FR, by the written transcription of them. The anomalous nature of SCP-410-FR thus lies in the fact that the anomalous phenomena to which the work may have referred have lost their anomalous aspects.\n\nDespite these discoveries, the abilities of SCP-410-FR are still poorly understood today, and it is likely that only the author had the ability to make the anomalies he described disappear. Analysis of the writing style of SCP-410-FR and more generally that of PoI-410 to improve the containment of certain anomalous phenomena is under evaluation. In addition, research is still in progress concerning potential anomalies described in PoI-410's other works.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondationscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-410-fr/gidouille.jpg|caption=Depiction of the Gidouille on the cover of the issue zero of //Subsidia Pataphysica//.]]\n\nThe first part of SCP-410-FR, //Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician, neo-scientific novel//, deals in particular in its Books III and VI with various places identified as [DATA EXPUNGED], of which, according to the Multi-U, no trace remains today. It is likely that, like the anomalous events described in //Speculations//, [[[paradigm-shift|these have ceased to exist]]]. In the same way, it is suspected that the entities initially present in these places were at the origin of the breakdown of normality mentioned before, and thus of the anomalous phenomenon which PoI-410 partially witnessed.\n\nAccording to the analysis of the parapsychologist Elias Lockwood, the symbol of the Gidouille[[footnote]] Spiral present on the belly of Father Ubu, central character within the bibliography of the PoI-410.

It soon became apparent that the victims had all taken the B line of the Overall Omnibus Company, which connected the Trocadero Square to the East Station. _\n _\nAfter questioning the OOC administration and the line's drivers, various investigators disappeared in turn, prompting the Central Gendastrerie of Paris to take up the case. Inspector Aurélien Juve then had all the cars of the line requisitioned for examination. A mixture of [DATA EXPUNGED] was found in the engine, most likely belonging to the various missing persons. In addition, the different vehicles, although built on the same model, were not quite the same size. _\n _\nOn March 12, the cars escaped from the shed where they had been stored and returned to the B line after causing panic in the streets of the capital. The Gendastrerie closed the line and blocked the vehicles. After this unsuccessful attempt due to the weight and power of the machines, it was decided to bait the omnibuses by placing gendastres disguised as civilians at various stops, then to quickly immobilize the vehicle by sabotaging the wheels thanks to the gendastres who were ambushed while the baits were entering the vehicle, before quickly forcing them out of the vehicle. _\n[[f>image omnibus.jpg size=\"small\"]] _\nIt was later determined that the B line omnibuses had acquired the consciousness and capabilities of a predatory animal species, and that they digested their victims once they had boarded the bus to retrieve the metal parts. The drivers, unaware of the maneuver, played a role of decoy and allowed according to the predatory logic of the omnibuses to reassure the victims. _\n _\nAs a result of these events, all OOC vehicles were requisitioned and examined one after the other. However, the day after the requisition order (March 15, 1893), the predatory omnibuses all broke down due to the contents of their engines. After examination by the thaumaturgical forces of the Gendastrerie, it appeared that the vehicles had lost their anomalous capacities. The complete requisition was abandoned, but a certified thaumaturgist was assigned to examine the OOC vehicles weekly for one year. No additional anomalous activities were noted.||\n@@@@\n||~ Text: ||SCP-410-FR-9||~ Title:||Some Habits of the Drowned||\n||||||||~ Excerpt:||\n|||||||| //We had the opportunity to establish some quite intimate relations with these interesting dead-drunk aquatists. According to our observations, a drowned person is not a man who died by submersion, despite the common opinion that tends to accredit it: he is a being apart, with special habits and who would, we believe, adapt wonderfully to his environment if one wanted to let him stay there a suitable time. It is remarkable that they keep better in water than in the open air.//||\n||||||||~ Event:||\n||||||||Between 1901 and 1903, various testimonies concerning bodies carried by the Loire river were collected in several communes located near the river. Due to the frequency of these reports and the fact that no mass disappearances had been reported for a long time, the decision was made to leave the matter to the Gendastrerie. The drowned persons who had given the testimony were indeed found several times along the river, but it was impossible to remove them. They sank at the slightest approach, and it was impossible to find them once under the surface. Moreover, the few people who dived into the river to retrieve the bodies could not be pulled out, and drowned in turn, whether they knew how to swim or not. _\n[[f>image amerlok.jpg size=\"small\"]] _\nBecause of the seriousness of the threat -- with estimates ranging from 200 to 1,500 drowned -- and the inability of the Gendastrerie forces to respond, a delegation from the American Secure Containment Initiative took up the case. They had dealt with similar problems in the past with a similar invasion of drowning people in Louisiana on the Mississippi River. The creatures looked exactly like drowning people to better attract their victims. They would then absorb their energy and heat by using the water as a conductive medium, like a lightning rod and a web that would prevent them from escaping. _\n _\nAlthough collaboration between French and US forces proved difficult, the invasion could still be contained. Several barges equipped with tin nets with a high-voltage thaumic current flowing through them raked the Loire for a month to attract and capture the creatures. Nearly ███ bodies were recovered. However, once the operation was over, it turned out that they had become perfectly normal corpses. The ACSI delegation was allowed to leave with some of the corpses for their own research.||\n@@@@\n||~ Text: ||SCP-410-FR-31||~ Title:||About the \"Damage\"||\n||||||||~ Excerpt:||\n||||||||//Mr. Couyba, if we have heard correctly, claimed the abolition of censorship and even, carried away by his ardor, that, by a law, of syphilis.

Although they did not say much about their motives, it is known that they manipulated anomalous information and advocated a so-called \"healthy\" distribution of knowledge for a humanitarian purpose, which included the concealment of certain information. _\n[[f>image mspaint.jpg size=\"small\"]] _\nThe Mediators of Le Havre originated in 1892 a curative device capable of curing any infection by synthesizing a memetic agent from its germs. The infectious agent was immersed in a special solution, which was then processed in an alchemical synthesis circuit, before its information was converted by the machine into a memetic agent -- usually a sequence of characters drawn in ink by a complex mechanism - which came out of the machine, ready to be used. A person exposed to these sequences of characters would automatically forget all information about the disease in question, so that they were unable to hear the name of the disease. At the same time, their body would heal and become immune to the disease almost immediately. _\n _\nThe anomalous memes produced in Le Havre were traded for almost 10 years, the machine having been produced in several copies and then sold to several humanitarian associations. The regulatory authorities of the time were not particularly concerned about the phenomenon, as it was safe and widely considered to be a form of alternative medicine, attracting a niche audience as a result. However, around 1906, the curative memes of the Mediators of the Silence and the Word were abandoned, having suddenly lost all effectiveness. _\n _\nThe machines were sent back to Le Havre, before being requisitioned by the Gendastrerie. These, all broken down, were clogged with a mixture of black ink and an extremely infectious organic pathogen slurry, which cost the lives of several men of the Departmental Gendastrerie of the Seine-Inférieure. The machines were consequently burned and destroyed, and the activity of the Mediators of the Silence and the Word in Le Havre ceased.||\n@@@@\n||~ Text:||SCP-410-FR-38||~ Title:||Mr. Timbre's Ambush||\n||||||||~ Excerpt:||\n||||||||//Nevertheless, we[[footnote]] Here a \"we of modesty\" designating the author.

Identified as Urban Młynarczyk, a Polish citizen reported missing in 1897, he called himself \"Mr. Timbre\". _\n[[f>image fabric.jpg size=\"small\"]] _\nThe particularity of Mr. Timbre is that he used to store a very large quantity of blank postage stamps on his tongue. He was able to introduce himself as well as to hide the documents and objects he stole on the said stamps. The individual was arrested and imprisoned several times by the Gendastrerie, but he always managed to escape by using his anomalous abilities -- his stamps could never be completely removed from his mouth, even by hindering it with a muzzle, which he made disappear by slipping a stamp between it and his lips -- and he could never be arrested in his lifetime. _\n _\nOn January 3, 1907, the deceased body of Urban Młynarczyk from multiple fractures and internal bleeding was found embedded in the mailbox of a laundry in the town of Cholet. Due to lack of evidence and information, and noting the absence of recidivism, the Gendastrerie ceased the search for Mr. Timbre's known employer, whom he had mentioned during an interrogation.||\n@@@@\n||~ Text: ||SCP-410-FR-56||~ Title:||Pleasure Permitted||\n||||||||~ Excerpt:||\n||||||||//A measure that good gunsmiths are beginning to take is to sell lead-free cartridges.// _\n//Since no one makes their own cartridges anymore, the substitution goes unnoticed.// _\n//It provides, moreover, two considerable advantages: lightness for the bearer of weapons and safety for the neighbors.// _\n _\n//Lead in venison served at the table is a condiment that can be added after cooking.// _\n _\n//The suppression of lead, after that of smoke, is under study in weapons of war.//||\n||||||||~ Event:||\n||||||||During the month of February 1904 in the city of Rennes, the League of the Servants of the Nation (founded by Inspector Juve in 1899) was dispatched to respond to the threat of trafficking in paranormal weapons designed as part of an artistic gathering of \"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques ?\". _\n[[f>image pistol.jpg size=\"small\"]] _\nDesigned by the sculptor Jacques Villon, these weapons had the particularity of being cast in a single block before being painted and chiseled. Despite this, they were capable of wounding and killing like a weapon of the same caliber, although no ammunition or explosion was visible or audible. Initially conceived as a critique of the object and its function, the 22 sculptures were stolen and used by an organized gang of delinquent hemovores to create panic within the city and the demonstration. _\n _\nAfter a long battle that mobilized several regiments of the Departmental Gendastrerie of Ille-et-Vilaine to secure the city and the area of the SNDM demonstration, the group was apprehended and the weapons confiscated, notably thanks to the muscular intervention of Messrs Longuet and Sainte-Claire. However, three days after the incident, the sculptures lost their capacity. An interrogation of Mr. Villon did not allow any further clarification, as he claimed that the effect of his works -- inseparable from the rest and part of his intentions -- was not intended to be ephemeral.||\n@@@@\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 410FR2:** Project Phobetor and Program VIRIDIS CANDELA\n\nProject Phobetor is an attempt to replicate the effects of SCP-410-FR to counter containment breaches of some sensitive anomalies. The project involved a team from the [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/introduction-aux-theories-fondamentales-de-l-anormalite Department of Fundamental Theories of Abnormality] and several experts in anomalous literature. Officially, Project Phobetor has not led to the neutralization of any anomaly, and the research has not produced anything new since 2004. A small team is now in charge of the project.\n\nHowever, Project Phobetor advances may have provided a theory that several events described in SCP-410-FR may have been erased from our plane of reality, and therefore would not be identifiable. The research Program VIRIDIS CANDELA has therefore been set up with the support of the Department of History and Temporal Anomalies Department. The current goal of this program is to try to recover as much of the lost information as possible by studying SCP-410-FR. On a larger scale, Program VIRIDIS CANDELA would aim to protect the course of history from anomalous changes using DEEPWELL servers, whose data will be protected from changes in reality, and even to recover information about temporal changes potentially already made.\n\n**Addendum 410FR3:** Update of ██/██/2002 - Document PoI-410-71\n\nThe following text is the transcription of a document recovered by the Foundation at 51 A Volga Street, in Paris, during an operation of excavation of the locations of interest potentially sheltering documents concerning SCP-410-FR (in the present case, the head office of the Collège de 'Pataphysique). This was the starting point for the research conducted in 2002 on SCP-410-FR, which led to the current update of its description. It should be noted that although the handwriting matched that of PoI-410, the Foundation's linguists identified some inconsistencies in style, the most notable being the document's signature. According to Dr. Lockwood, it is likely that these are due to some psychic instability, the result of the interaction of PoI-410 with the anomalous entities described in the first part of SCP-410-FR.\n\nAfter expertise, it was determined that PoI-410 suffered from Filbuson Syndrome. Any membership in [[[saphir-centre|GoI-0051]]] was refuted given the period of its activity, despite the existence of certain texts such as //Pantaphysics and Catachimy// and //On the Surface of God//, taken from Book VIII of SCP-410-FR, or even from SCP-410-FR-51, //The Existence of the Pope//. Information concerning SCP-410-FR (and specifically this document) should therefore be kept out of the reach of the above-mentioned Group of Interest.\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"► Access Document PoI-410-71\" hide=\"▽ Close Document PoI-410-71\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++++ FRONTIER OF PHANTASM\n[[/=]]\n@@    @@From the questioning verve of Messrs.
