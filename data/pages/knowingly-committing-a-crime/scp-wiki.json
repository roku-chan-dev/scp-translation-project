Like other things, we both arise and perish. But as human beings, facing everything in the world, we know our own end, yet we have infinite desires and pursuits. Therefore:\n//**We survive, we resist, we explore.**//\nPerhaps heavenly principles do exist, but perhaps the struggle against them is the essence of 'humanity'. Even at the cost of death, we will not stop moving forward. Those supernatural things will never defeat the spirit, and in terrifying anomalies, they will eventually be imprisoned in a cage. I hope that when we all perish, we will rest in peace.\nAs an ordinary human, I am unable to make significant contributions to the world. In fact, I know that there are many seemingly useless fallacies in the world. Although they are not very useful, I still want to share some with others. The following theory was not written by me, it comes from a long forgotten notebook. I don't know who the author is, he only left his name \"Louis\" and nothing else.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Theory 1-\"Frames\"\" hide=\"-Theory 1-\"Frames\" \"]]\n**a.The existence of 'frames'**\nCountless events happen every day, and everything takes time. But some things don't actually require time, they just cross a boundary of no action. For example, from the moment a person lives to the moment they die, from the moment they 'possess life' to the moment they 'lose life', it actually doesn't take time. For example, the solidification of water, when the substance is still a mixture of ice and water, it is about to solidify into ice. The moment when ice goes from \"not formed\" to \"formed\" does not require time, but only crosses the boundary between the \"ice water mixture\" and \"ice\".A thing starts from nothing and only passes through one boundary; And things only pass through one boundary from existence to non existence. However, for the process of things, it takes a period of time, which is completely different from origin and extinction. However, the process of things can also be seen as countless origins and deaths: for example, from birth to death, a person's age changes every moment of their life, indicating the beginning and past of the age stage that each person will reach. The so-called age stage can be set infinitely small, so small that it hardly takes time. Therefore, assuming that humans will go through countless \"age stages\" in this process, every hour, minute, second, or even less time, humans will still go through countless stages, that is, countless origins and deaths. Although this is not the origin or extinction of life, it is still within the scope of life. Therefore, the process of things can also be seen as origin or extinction, but the so-called \"origin\" and \"extinction\" do not completely match the definition of human beings.\nBut according to this reasoning, assuming an object is falling at a constant speed in the air, from the beginning of the fall to the ground, the object is in motion at all times. Even if the timing unit is set very small - despite the small distance the object moves. Similarly, everything in the universe is the same: because the microscopic particles that make up objects are in an endless motion due to gravitational forces, the things in the universe move as a result. If we take the most central point in the universe as a reference, then objects that we perceive as \"moving\" are also in relative motion. And their motion is also the same as the above-mentioned objects: they are in motion at all times. Therefore, the motion of all things has a common characteristic: if an object continues to move over a period of time, there is no moment in the process that makes the object's position the same as the previous moment (or any other moment). And the so-called 'moment' is like distinguishing the boundaries of object positions, completely without the need for time. We will temporarily refer to it as a 'frame'. And no matter what, as long as it involves the so-called 'time', it must be composed of countless' frames'. Taking the falling object mentioned above as an example, regardless of how many years or seconds the object has been falling, following the previous conclusion about position changes, it can be concluded that the process of the object falling has gone through countless \"frames\". And the position of the object corresponding to each frame is different from other frames, and the difference is also different. If we take the center of the universe as a reference point, countless things in the universe are also in motion. And their movement process is also composed of countless frames - from birth to now. Therefore, the changes in the world are composed of countless frames.\n**b. Reasoning about \"frames\"**\nBecause the changes in the world are composed of frames, each frame corresponds to a different world at any given time, even if the changes are minimal. However, according to the theory that frames can be regarded as boundaries, each frame can also correspond to an intangible boundary. Therefore, if we want to freeze a changing object in a certain frame, then the object is relatively stationary. If the universe is stationary as a frame, everything in the universe is relatively stationary with the point at the center of the universe as a reference. And our world is constantly changing, and the corresponding frames are constantly changing. As things develop, although the world we live in has gone through many vicissitudes, reality can only correspond to one frame, and this corresponding frame of the real world is constantly changing. We will temporarily refer to this frame as the 'real frame'. The real frame is a constantly changing quantity, and there is only one. It represents our present, and also the present of the universe. And 'now' is constantly changing, like a small wooden block moving at a constant speed in a straight line in infinite space,with its position constantly changing.\nHowever, if the real frame is constantly changing, the so-called 'past' will also change due to its changes - then what has already happened in the past will have no real connection with the real frame; And what will happen in the future will also change with every moment of the present, and the so-called 'future' will continue to change without any connection to the reality frame. Simply put, a real frame can be viewed as a two-dimensional circular plane moving directionally within an infinitely long three-dimensional cylinder. We refer to the trajectory that has been moved as the 'past', and the part that will be moved to but has not yet been touched as the 'future'. However, no matter how short the time is considered, the circle always passes through the distance, so the past and future are constantly changing, so they do not have any relationship with the circle, that is, the real frame. Just like how the water rises and the boat rises, the boat will continue to rise with the water. No matter how high the water rises, the water at the bottom will never touch the boat, and the boat will always touch the surface of the water. If we consider the air on the ship as the 'future', when the ship arrives, which air will either be occupied by the ship or submerged by water. Therefore, we are in the frame of reality, and our world is constantly changing, so we cannot touch the 'past' and 'future' no matter what. Of course, the past cannot be touched. When we think we have reached the 'future', the so-called 'future' may become the 'present' or the 'past'. So, we only live in one frame. According to this reasoning - in a narrow sense, there is no such thing as \"past\" or \"future\" in the world, nor is there any such thing as \"time\".\nThe subjective consciousness of a person often determines their thinking. In the world, there are three types of events: inevitable events, random events, and impossible events. Random events refer to events that occur with probability, and humans cannot determine the outcome. Taking Schr รถ dinger's cat as an example, if a person does not open the box, the cat is in a state of superposition of death and life. However, there is a loophole in this process: no matter what the guess is, there is only one outcome in the end, and the cat cannot live and die again after the box is opened. Actually, it doesn't depend on the state of the radioactive atoms, because although the poison bottle has two possibilities of breaking or not breaking, it will only have one state in the end, which is just impossible for humans to judge. For example, in an unknown building, there may or may not be people inside. But in fact, there can only be one possible outcome inside, it's just that we can't judge. Based on the previous inference of \"past\" and \"future\", since both objectively do not exist, every \"random event\" can be seen as an event with a certain outcome. We can assume that the first time flipping a coin is positive - if there is a past, it can be said that 'if I had tossed it once, the result might have been different', but if there is no past, this statement does not hold true. Therefore, objectively speaking, there is no such thing as a \"random event\" in the world, and everything is bound to happen.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Theory 2: The Trend of Changes in Everything\" hide=\"-Theory 2: The Trend of Changes in Everything \"]]\n**a.  Limitations and Balance**\nWe live in an orderly world where everything is functioning normally. The real frame is constantly changing. Our world is orderly because the changes in reality frames have directionality. However, directionality still requires us to reason.\nFirstly, the development of things and even the changes in the world are limited by various factors. Firstly, the laws of physics, including the laws of conservation of energy and mass, indicate that energy or things do not appear out of thin air, leading to the inference that everything is finite. Things push each other forward. The gravitational force between microscopic particles drives the formation of celestial bodies and causes them to move. We are in three-dimensional space, so objects have length, width, and height. Because moving objects have inertia, many objects remain in relative motion even after being subjected to force. These physical laws are indispensable. If there were no laws of physics in the world, the world would lack limitations and could very well be destroyed. Besides, the occurrence of things has causes and effects. Although this does not belong to the laws of physics, if things are not limited by causality, that is, because The occurrence involves The law, so. Also, it has been previously argued that the occurrence of events is inevitable. Therefore, based on the laws of physics, this is the most important constraint and fundamental. These inevitable events can be inferred through the laws of physics.\nThe above restrictions are indispensable, and the absence of any one will lead to the destruction of the world. So the real frame is also relatively stable, which is its direction over a large range. However, if we further infer those laws, we will find that they have laid a more complex direction for the development of the world. The above physical laws promote the development and stability of the world, and according to Clausius' statement of the second law of thermodynamics, heat cannot automatically transfer from low-temperature objects to high-temperature objects. This indicates the directionality of heat transfer, where heat is always transferred from high-temperature objects to low-temperature objects. This is like a kind of balance, and many situations in physics are related to balance. For example, stars and planets in the universe are in equilibrium, and stationary objects are often in equilibrium. According to the law of conservation of energy, there is no perpetual motion machine in the world, and moving objects will eventually come to a standstill due to the depletion of energy, proving that everything has a beginning and an end. This also maintains the balance of the world. In addition to the laws of physics, there are many other practical factors that also promote balance. For example, in reality, the difference in different attributes of the same thing is not too large compared to that thing. For example, for the same type of apple, the fruit varies in size. But the largest apple is not thousands of times larger than a regular apple, and the smallest apple is not too small compared to a regular apple. In short, the fluctuation of differences will always be within a certain range, which is limited by genes. In addition, in some things that people do, such as building a building several thousand meters high, they will first face material shortages, insufficient manpower during construction, and the safety factor of the building will be very low after completion, which poses risks at any time. On the contrary, if a person wants to build a villa a few centimeters high for ants, there will also be technical difficulties. If we only build an ordinary house, it will be much easier. For example, in some probabilistic events, there must be many different situations after the occurrence of the event, and the higher the probability, the more times it occurs. I have said before that everything in the world is inevitable, but people cannot judge it. But this so-called 'probability' also promotes equilibrium without being influenced by the laws of physics. Therefore, not only physical laws, but also genes and other factors can limit the development of things. In reality, various other factors can also affect it. So, all factors in the universe will limit the development of things and keep everything in a relatively balanced state. This is probably the development direction of realistic frames.\n**b. Further inference**\nEverything in the universe is subject to limitations such as the above. However, there are always things in the world where the balance is disrupted. For example, among all humans, there are always some who have extremely high intelligence and have discovered or deduced physical laws. There are also some animals whose individual volumes far exceed or are much smaller than their counterparts, and some stable galaxies that have been swallowed by black holes, and so on. In short, balance cannot be absolute. If balance is absolute, the universe is likely to be in nothingness. So balance is relative and diverse. As mentioned above, the differences in different attributes of the same thing will be limited, and the greater the difference, the greater the limitation. However, there must be differences in the different attributes of the same thing, and all differences are due to their opposite existence. And the division of \"species\" here can be broader. For example, apples can have both relatively large and relatively small varieties of the same type. There are also metals, some with strong activity and some with weak activity. Moreover, because \"things\" and \"objects\" support and push each other, there will always be a phenomenon of breaking the balance in the process of any event, that is, breaking one's own balance or breaking the external balance. According to the theory of \"realistic frame\", everything cannot remain unchanged at once. Therefore, two conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n* If any attribute of an object undergoes almost zero long-term changes, the probability of significant changes occurring over a longer period of time also increases.\n* If an event has a significant impact on balance, the longer it lasts, the greater the likelihood that the impact will decrease.\nSo balance is very complex. If the balance of the world is too absolute, the world will not be able to develop. If the balance is too loose, the world will become chaotic and disordered again. In short, balance promotes world development and stability, which is the development direction of the reality framework. And the balance index will change with the changes of things and even the world. Therefore, it can be concluded that equilibrium is a theorem for a stable world, and its components are complex and diverse.\n**c. Regarding the laws of physics**\nPreviously, it was mentioned that maintaining world stability and balance involves a series of practical factors, including physical laws, genes, and others. Although those factors are completely different, their effects are the same. Without them, the harm would be the same. The role of physical laws is the most obvious and important among them, while other realities and factors seem to invisibly limit the development of things. So it is very likely that the world is developing towards relative stability and balance of all things (i.e. the development trend of each frame), and the so-called \"laws of physics\" are just more obvious, singular, and mandatory than other factors. That is to say, objectively speaking, physical laws are only a part of the equilibrium law, and there is no independent 'physical law'. Therefore, no physical law can be detrimental to the balance and stability of the world. Perhaps there is another 'universe' outside the universe, but its structure is vastly different from ours, so the physical laws there may also be different from ours.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Theory 3: Regarding Humans\" hide=\"-Theory 3: Regarding Humans \"]]\n**a. The uniqueness of humanity in the universe**\nIn the universe, the existence of life is a serious disruption to the balance within the universe. Therefore, compared to other substances in the universe, life is too special - they can carry on genes. This is a property that no other substance has. However, due to the certainty of the event and its adherence to the first conclusion about balance, the emergence of life is truly normal. Dan, among the many life forms on Earth, the emergence of humans has greatly disrupted the balance. Because human intelligence fundamentally surpasses other forms of life, humans not only create things that other forms of life cannot create, but even discover the laws of physics, the most obvious of which is the balance theorem. People have the ability of logical reasoning, by understanding the changes in things, they can infer the changes in other things, and they also discover many regular things, which are called theorems. And the most powerful thing is that people can also make mistakes - this indicates that human thinking is unique, not completely governed by physical laws, but influenced by genes. For example, many people often come to wrong conclusions before conducting physics experiments. Therefore, some of human genes are not completely influenced by physical laws, which is at least far beyond the countless celestial bodies in the universe.\n**b. Human limitations**\nAlthough humans are so special and powerful, they are still influenced by balance. Firstly, the vast majority of human genes are still influenced by the laws of physics, making it impossible for humans to speak freely. Human intelligence is high but not too high, which is influenced by genes, including greed and desire, making society full of competition. No matter what, humans have evolved from other forms of life, so all attributes are limited. So no matter how high a person's intelligence is or how large their brain capacity is, it is bound to be limited. And the universe is so vast and boundless, not to mention balance, even the laws of physics cannot be fully explored by humans. Moreover, humans make mistakes, which is both unique and limiting. Because all things have a beginning and an end, humanity will eventually perish due to the influence of balance. In addition, there is the most important limitation: humans have always been doing what they currently want to do, and it is impossible for them to do what they currently do not want to do. This may seem absurd, but listen to my analysis: if a person chooses to commit suicide due to various trivial matters in life, although he is unwilling, at the moment of suicide, it is what he wants to do. Assuming he chooses to jump off a building, when he regrets in the air, but he knows he can't turn the tide, so that's still what he wants to do. Because the changes in the world are made up of frames, everything we are willing to do in reality is something we want to do when it is done, and what we are forced to do reluctantly is something we still want to do when it is done. At the moment when something happens that we cannot control ourselves, we still want to do it. Therefore, humans cannot escape various limitations, so no matter how strong the foundation of humanity is or how advanced the technology is, it cannot escape balance.\nSo, as human beings, remember to live your life well, that is our common wish.\n[[/collapsible]]",
