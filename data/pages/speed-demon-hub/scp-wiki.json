She lured little kids into her home and ate them. Fuck her.\n \nThe Wicked Witch of the West? She used an army of flying monkeys to terrorize a little girl. Fuck her.\n \nStrega Nona? She had to have known that Big Anthony was watching her. Instead she let the poor bastard use the pot and nearly drown the town, getting himself crucified in the process. Fuck her.\n \nWitches are bitches. I'm no different, really -- just more high-tech about it. About the only thing I still do old-school is summon demons. I don't promise my soul to them, I harvest them. I don't ask for a fraction of their power, I turn them into drugs. And then I abuse the hell out of them. \n\nTogether with my best friend and partner in crime, the Inside Man, I break the law. I lie, cheat, steal, kill, and do whatever I need to make and break banks. I could do a lot of good with my powers, sure -- but I'm not that kind of gal. I'd much rather drink you under the table, smoke you out of your house, and rob it in the process. \n \nThey call me the Rookie. Strap in; it's gonna be a hell of a ride.\n\n@@ @@ \n\n= ##white|SINGLES:##\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"Australian Rules\"]]\n[##red|+%%rating%%##]   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmXWkMlKFkI ♬]] [[[australian-rules|Australian Rules Drag Racing]]]    [##grey|%%comments%% comments##]\n[[div style=\"margin: 0% 0% 0% 5%\"]]\n//And that was when the Rookie pulled out the rocket launcher.// [[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"Hypervelocity\"]]\n[##red|+%%rating%%##]   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30aGtXWo0SU ♬]] [[[hypervelocity|Hypervelocity]]]    [##grey|%%comments%% comments##]\n[[div style=\"margin: 0% 0% 0% 5%\"]]\n//In a fluid, practiced motion, she gently stabs the needle into the vein in her arm and injects herself with 100 CCs of pure demon.// [[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"Terminal Velocity\"]]\n[##red|+%%rating%%##]   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtNx3QYtsXs ♬]] [[[terminal-velocity|Terminal Velocity]]]    [##grey|%%comments%% comments##]\n[[div style=\"margin: 0% 0% 0% 5%\"]]\n//The engine howls as it mashes up and digests the cocktail of sex, drugs, and demons inside your brain.// [[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"Zeitgeist\"]]\n[##red|+%%rating%%##]   [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vibgbHa71Fk ♬]] [[[zeitgeist|Zeitgeist]]]    [##grey|%%comments%% comments##]\n[[div style=\"margin: 0% 0% 0% 5%\"]]\n//The old house rattles with the sounds of gunfire and spirits being violently put to rest.// [[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n\n@@ @@ \n\n= ##white|ALBUMS:##\n\n##red|ESCAPE VELOCITY## (COMPLETE):\nThe Rookie's broken more than a few hearts in her day.
