The regulation of the anomalous is a strain on all those involved, in all ways involved. Funds, personnel, our very humanity is taxed. However, it is of utmost importance that normalcy is maintained, as that has been, and continues to be, part of The Foundation's prime directive.\n\nDue to the importance of normalcy, containment of anomalies is generally undertaken by The Foundation, with little exception that is within our control. However, due to rising anomalous activity, we have been forced to examine our own resources, and while they are plentiful, they are not infinite. It is because of this inherent, undeniable limit to our influence, that we make this proposition.\n\nThe Boring Agreement is not just an outline of steps and regulations, or contractual legalization that allows Wilson's Wildlife Solutions to interact with anomalies. It is a pact. A pact that must be upheld, no matter the costs. The Boring Agreement is Wilson's Wildlife Solutions pledge to maintain normalcy, and to bear all burdens that the duty entails.\n\nSecure. Contain. Protect.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nIntroduction\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHello, pardner! It looks like you fine fellow have found yourself in Clackamas County and the town of Boring, Oregon, that can claim to have the least fitting name in all of the United States -- except maybe Hell over in Michigan. For those of you who grew up here, it sure may as well be boring as all boring can get, but we've recently run into some people who we affectionately refer to as the Supervisors, and through some conversations here and small talk there we know that we //apparently// live in what some call a \"nexus\". A nexus that gives us some weird animals 'round these parts.\n\nI, myself, am Tim Wilson, the founder of this wonderful community-funded organization that goes by the name Wilson's Wildlife Solutions! You have wildlife problems, and we solve them. Recently we've gotten some new sources of cash, so we're spreading our horizons all across Oregon, which is known (but not by most) as the world's greatest source of exotic fauna. The Amazon may have its parakeets and tigers or whatever lives down there, but up here we got big supposedly extinct birds, cleverly calming turtles, money-driven crows, time-hopping coyotes, and the like.\n\nWe've been operational since 1997, when I was but a wee lad of 42 years, and we have been under //official// supervision since 2008 upon the signing of the legendary Boring Agreement (which came about after the infamous [http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-ursus-maritimus-incident Ursus Maritimus Incident]). Since then, it has been much different, both in good and bad ways! Well, as of the time of writing. The world is a crazy place, and it's honestly a bit surprising just how well we have all been handling it. Let's hope that we stay that way.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nWhat We're All About\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nOur organizational structure is flimsy at best, but it works. I, Tim Wilson, am the founder, and some people are second in command, and some people are below them, and everyone does what they are best at and what they want to do. Officially, we can be called by anyone in Clackamas County to handle, say, a group of deer that consistently block the road or raccoons that keep getting into the trash. Unofficially, we can be called by anyone in Oregon and be expected to respond, for reasons much more esoteric than our website lists (we have a website, by the way). We're also officially a wildlife rehabilitation center. Get us some animals with broken legs or birds with clipped wings and we will get them back on their feet, guaranteed. It's what we do.\n\nAs a team, we're ecologists, zoologists, veterinarians, animal control specialists, environmentalists, passionate individuals, friends, and family. We're capable, we're innovative, and we're really, really nice most of the time. Come say hi!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\nReading Material\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSupervised Projects\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"wilsons-wildlife +scp\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Project||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nIndependent Projects\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"_wilsons-wildlife\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Project||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**Anecdotes From the Guys**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"wilsons-wildlife +tale\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Story||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nOther People Interacting w/ //Us//\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"wilsons-wildlife +goi-format -_wilsons-wildlife\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Story||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nWilson's Abroad\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n||~ Story ||~ Author ||~ Original _\nLanguage||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/perfil-de-la-criatura-marw Critter Profile: Marw!] || [[*user Riyer P]] || [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/perfil-de-la-criatura-marw Spanish] ||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/peligro-igniciervos Danger: Incinideer!] || [[*user dc_yerko]] || [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/peligro-igniciervos Spanish]||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/rescate-pozo-espantozo Rescue Mission: The Spooky Well!] || [[*user dc_yerko]]|| [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/rescate-pozo-espantozo Spanish] ||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/critter-profile-owen Critter Profile: Owen!] || [[*user usubaorigeki]] || [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/critter-profile-owen Japanese] ||\n||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/critter-profile-randy Critter Profile: Randy!] || [[*user usubaorigeki]] || [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/critter-profile-randy Japanese]||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/peligro-hipopotamos-de-medellin Danger: Medelin Hippos!] || [[*user uncle nicolini]] || [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/peligro-hipopotamos-de-medellin Spanish]||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/kreaturenprofil-eden Critter Profile: EDEN!] || [[*user einer von rabe]] || [http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/kreaturenprofil-eden German]||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/critter-profile-claycy Critter Profile: Claycy!] || [[*user santou]] || [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/critter-profile-claycy Japanese] ||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/perfil-de-la-criatura-thor Critter Profile: Thor!] || [[*user Doc slash]] || [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/perfil-de-la-criatura-thor Spanish] ||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/critter-profile-shigastan Critter Profile: Shigastan!] || [[*user stengan774]] || [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/critter-profile-shigastan Japanese] ||\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nMulti-Parters for Long Camping Trips\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"wilsons-wildlife +_tale-hub\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Story||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nEverything Else\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"wilsons-wildlife -goi-format -tale -scp -_tale-hub\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Story||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\nHow To Write\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nThemes\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nWilson's Wildlife Solutions is largely where the mundane intersects with the anomalous. These are ordinary people leading ordinary lives who are volunteers/employees (but mostly volunteers) of an extraordinary organization. Unlike the Foundation's \"hard men making hard decisions\" aspect, Wilson's is a much more relaxed and friendly bunch. They endear themselves to the animals. They give the critters nicknames and treats. They love, care for, and treat the critters humanely.\n\nIf this sounds very slice-of-life-y to you, that's because it is! Whereas the Foundation has research labs, Wilson's has a small library of veterinary care books. Whereas the Foundation has Mobile Task Forces, Wilson's has a few guys in a pickup with nets, cages, and leashes. Whereas the Foundation has an infinite budget and contains threats beyond human comprehension, Wilson's is community-funded (with some help from the Foundation) and only contains Safe to Euclid anomalies.\n\nSmall scale, personal stories are where Wilson's truly shines, so if that sounds good to you, feel free to run with it!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nOn Tim and Faeowynn Wilson\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nTim and Faeowynn Wilson are the two main driving forces behind Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, and are father and daughter.\n\nTim was born in San Diego, California and moved up to Boring, Oregon in his early 20s after separating from his wife Audrey and first child, Faeowynn. He remarried Alice in Boring and had two more children, Robin and Anders, and went on to fund Wilson's Wildlife Solutions in 1997 as Wilson's Wildlife Shelter where he, 'Old Al', and a few others began wrangling the strange wildlife that showed up in the town from time to time. \n\nHe led the Shelter up until it became the Center in 2008 following the Ursus Maritimus Incident and the Foundation's (who are known as \"The Supervisors\" to Wilson's staff) intervention in the event. He continued to lead it until his passing in July 2024, where it was taken over by Faeowynn. Tim much prefers being with the animals and neglects to do paperwork. He is often out in the field, catching critters and working with the in-house Foundation stationed MTF Beta-4 \"Castaways\".\n\nFaeowynn (born Felix; she is transgender) was also born in San Diego. She and Tim did not have the best of relationships after her mother passed away and Tim didn't come to the funeral because he was too busy dealing with the Center. She went away to university at NYU for accounting and graduated with a decent GPA, and decided to confront her father for abandoning her and her mother, only to be met with the anomalous at the Center. Faeowynn quickly became a part of it, serving as Chief Financial Officer and dealing with a lot of paperwork Tim had outright neglected. \n\nFae is a complicated character. She is filled with resentment towards her father for justifiable reasons, but still loves him. She likes her work and what she does, but distrusts the Foundation. She sympathizes with members of other GoIs that are oppressed by the Foundation, and even has her own secrets against the Supervisors. She is overall a highly capable person, but very emotionally withdrawn. Despite this, she is dating fellow Center employee Alex Molina, who is very understanding of her idiosyncrasies and supports her like no other.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\nWriting Material\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nLoosely Followed Format(s)\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nFormat! How would us geo-eyes even have identities without unique //formats//? Well we got just the darnedest, most clean format one can ever possibly hope for (so bland, in fact, that we've been silently hoping that some kind of graphic designers comes and helps us out some time soon). It's functional and the colors are pleasant, so we keep it around.\n\nWhile we have plenty of different //formats// for all types of occasions, here are the divs we use to let us stand out and feel fresh (and minty). Note that these divs, by default, only work when using either the Wilson's  Wildlife Solutions or Wilderness themes!
