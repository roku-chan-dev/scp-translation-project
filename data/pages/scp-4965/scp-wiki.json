The Foundation has also updated the words and phrases it monitors in global news channels to include descriptions of SCP-4965's effects.\n\nUpon discovery of an outbreak, the Foundation is to liaise with local governments to initiate protocol Whiskey-Hotel-Oscar, rendering the effected town quarantined under the premise of an anthrax outbreak. All residents are screened for SCP-4965's influence. Infected humans are designated as SCP-4965-1. All surrounding localities and transit sites are to be monitored for 72 hours post containment to minimise the risk of a breach.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1080/537103907_cff96d9cbb_b.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=An aerial shot indicating site T-4965-11, concealed as a construction site in London, England.\n]]\n\nWith a single exception [[footnote]]See Event-4965-C2.[[/footnote]] there have been no observed cases of SCP-4965 spreading outside of instanced outbreaks, during which between 10 and 50 people within a 2km radius are infected simultaneously. However, in light of this exception, Foundation personnel are no longer permitted direct contact with SCP-4965-1 without direct orders from Director Blackwood. Any D-class personnel making contact should typically wear Type-B HazMat suits, D-class who make direct contact without the use of a HazMat suit are to be contained or terminated post-testing.\n\nContainment sites should provide relative comfort. Suggested dimensions for containment cells are 8m x 8m x 3m and all cells must be constructed and maintained adhering to level-2 biohazard containment protocols. Cells will typically contain various entertainment media negotiable based on the occupant’s requests. SCP-4965-1s who were previously involved romantically will typically be permitted to cohabit unless currently involved in research. All details are adjustable at the discretion of Foundation facilities management staff.\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=300px\n|url=https://imgur.com/Zak3qMk.jpgurl.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A still taken from a video feed of an SCP-4965-1 at site T-4965-██ frozen in an unusual position.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-4965 is a sentient, parasitic entity which typically infects a cluster of between 10 and 50 people in bursts, usually contained to a single city or town. Use of antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, amnestics and all other attempted medical approaches have proven ineffective in removing SCP-4965's control over instances of SCP-4965-1.\n\nThe primary anomalous property of SCP-4965 is its ability to control human hosts provided they are not being visually observed by another being with a score higher than 0.2 on the Foundation’s Extended Intelligence Test (EIT) [[footnote]]The approximate intelligence of a large canine or a typically developing human around 18 months old.[[/footnote]]. Observation through any non-direct means such as video cameras has no effect on SCP-4965.\n\nThe control SCP-4965 exerts over a host varies with time since infection. Initially, unobserved SCP-4965-1 instances simply remain static when unobserved. The dexterity of the instance of SCP-4965-1's movement then increases at a roughly linear rate over the course of approximately one month at which time the SCP-4965-1's movements will be indistinguishable from their typical movements, in some cases even displaying improved facility of movement.\n\nSCP-4965 possesses a clear personality, though it has been observed to be extremely inconsistent over time. Since containment, the entity has demonstrated benevolence, cordiality, levity and often a seemed sense of gratification in the mockery of Foundation staff. It is theorised that the entity's personality is partially affected by the personalities of the SCP-4965-1s under its control.\n\n-----\n**Addendum:**\nResearch into SCP-4965 has been approved by Director Blackwood and executed by Dr. Grierson et al at site T-4965-14. Results of Dr. Grierson's research, as well as relevant observations and supplementary documents, are logged in file SCP-4965-E, accessible to those with Level 2/4965 authorisation.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]] \n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 2/4965 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 2/4965 AUTHORISATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-sandbox-3:component:login-module |id=B422073|pw=<HI MUM>|disc=true]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Log In\" hide=\"Logout\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[=]]\n+ SCP-4965-E\n[[/=]]\n++++ Foreword from Dr. Grierson:\nThanks to Director Blackwood, we can finally study this thing in such a way as to ascertain more than just 'people stay still when not being looked at', or 'people make stuff up'.\n\nThis research is going to mean something. We aim to discover SCP-4965's origins, how it works, how to truly contain it. Others who have studied SCP-4965 have become unnerved by its 'personality'. We shall not share their weak-mindedness.\n\nJust as Director Blackwood has told us from the start: //Nil satis nisi optimum//.

IT is to be left unobserved in a standing position and observed via video feed for movement. The test will be terminated subject to Dr. Grierson discretion as to whether collected data is sufficient.\n\n**Results:** IT was left standing in the middle of the room. After 12 seconds of stillness, he began to move approximately 4 feet to the nearest seat. This movement, including sitting down, took 53 seconds.\n \nFor the next 28 minutes and 5 seconds, no changes occurred. Dr. Grierson temporarily ceased the test for a coffee break. After returning sometime later, Dr. Grierson called for Doctors Shields and Nguyen to return immediately.\n \nIT was sitting in the same chair which had been moved to the centre of the room facing the camera which IT stared at, unblinking for at least 1 minute and 47 seconds. The lens of the camera had been scratched from inside the cell in backwards letters so the camera feed reads the words 'Always Watching. Never Seeing.'.\n\n-----\n\n//The following is a transcript of Dr. Grierson’s proceeding interview with IT.//\n\n> [[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n> **TRANSCRIPT 1**\n> [[/div]]\n>\n> **IT:** Hey doc-\n> \n> **Grierson:** What the hell was that?\n> \n> **IT:** You gonna have to let me in the loop here.\n> \n> **Grierson:** What you just did, with the camera.\n> \n> **IT:** Huh?

IT scratching a camera lens a few feet off the ground is impressive but fairly plausible. Somehow deleting the recording for the whole session?

The test will be terminated subject to Dr. Grierson discretion as to whether collected data is sufficient.\n \n**Results:** For 4 minutes and 8 seconds of being observed no notable activity occurs. At this point, IT begins to hum the supposed melody of 'In the Air Tonight' by Phil Collins. Approximately 12 seconds later IT is joined by WA, TC and HES who all 'air drum' the signature drum fill of the song at the appropriate time to match IT's humming. They then continue hum in sync whilst going about mundane business: IT writes a letter, WA reads a book, TC plays a video game and HES watches television.\n \n12 minutes and 12 seconds after the test began, all individuals move to the centre of their rooms and face their respective camera. They all stop humming at the same time and adopt the poses of 'The Beatles' on the cover of the album 'Help!' in such an order that the 4 monitors display the poses in the correct order.\n\nDr. Grierson becomes visibly annoyed. He instructs the junior researchers to observe as he visits IT to see how the others react.\n \n46 seconds later, IT's camera cuts out for 8.5 seconds. When the video feed returns, IT is no longer in containment and the door to the cell is visibly open. Dr. Shields immediately activates containment breach protocol.\n \nDuring this time, WA, TC and HES all take a seat, cross-legged and feign sleeping but bearing a smile.\n \nAnother 4 minutes and 23 seconds pass and on-site security escort a disoriented IT back into his containment cell.\n\n-----\n\n//The following is a transcript of Dr. Grierson’s proceeding interview with IT.//\n\n> [[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n> **TRANSCRIPT SCP-4965-E4**\n> [[/div]]\n> \n> //Dr. Grierson enters the room.//\n> \n> **IT:** Now doc I am sorry I-\n> \n> **Grierson:** Don't give me that shit.

Thankfully, prior to his release Dr. Nguyen made the suggestion of switching Grierson's Foundation standard recorder with an older, magnetic strip recorder. This suggestion has proven instrumental in proving Dr. Grierson's involvement with SCP-4965's site-wide containment breach now designated as Event-4965-C2, as he destroyed his recorder before the attempted escape.\n\nBased on the recovered audio, Grierson displayed extremely erratic behaviour before intentionally initiating the site-wide breach responsible for the escape of 4 instances of SCP-4965-1, during which the SCP-4965-1 population at large began presenting symptoms again. It is believed that Event-4965-C was engineered by SCP-4965 to manipulate Foundation staff. Containment procedures have been updated. Breach response teams are currently searching for the emancipated SCP-4965-1s.\n\nDue to the lack of a physical manifestation of SCP-4965, we are unable to determine the nature of Grierson's betrayal. His mental condition was demonstrably unstable throughout containment and could have informed such behaviour. Though his perceived condition may have been another of SCP-4965's manipulations, using Grierson as a puppet to facilitate its escape.\n\nMyself (Dr. Shields) and Dr. Nguyen attempted to leave T-4965-14 following the containment breach alarm as per protocol; however, we encountered a disoriented and erratic Grierson standing motionless at the exit of the facility.\n\nGrierson looked up at us for a brief moment before turning a stolen security sidearm on himself.\n\nHe was declared dead on-site by medical personnel.\n\nIf I may tarnish the official record with an ounce of sentiment for a once dear friend... let it be known that I hope Dr. Grierson rests peacefully.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4964]]] | SCP-4965 | [[[SCP-4966]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
