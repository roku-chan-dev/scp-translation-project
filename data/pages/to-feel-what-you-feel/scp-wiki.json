It had expected the ritual to snap it into PIC's body instantaneously, but it had instead happened slowly, a fade from its place behind Earth's Luna to a body of flesh and blood, of sinew and bone.\n\nThe first sense to come was sight, but PIC had closed his eyes, so there wasn't much to see just yet.\n\nThe second was hearing. Eli heard the buzz of a desk fan somewhere to its left. It heard the chirping of birds outside, dampened by a closed window. It heard someone, presumably Jude, move slightly. His clothes rubbed against a carpet, creating a scratchy sort of sound. Every sound was so much more noticeable, so much //more//, with human ears to catch them.\n\nThe third sense was feeling. A slight wind passed by it, likely the fan oscillating. The air ruffled its sleeve, rubbing the plush fabric against PIC's arm- its arm, for now. A silky substance passed through its fingers, falling to the floor. It felt like what Eli imagined sand to feel like. The air in the room was wet and heavy, something it didn't know air could be.\n\nIt took a breath in. The fourth sense was scent. There were only two distinct scents Eli could put words to, the rest a muddled, warm musk. A soft scent cut through it first, something misty and comforting. It reminded it of how its friend Lily described the scents of flowers. The other scent was much fainter, but it was there. Something much more damp and pungent, that reminded it of what swamps and marshes look like.\n\nThe last was taste. There wasn't much there, as Eli wasn't eating anything, but there was a slight pang on its tongue. PIC had probably eaten something sour or spicy, going off of what it knew of how its friends described those tastes.\n\nEli opened its eyes, taking in the room. It was bare, with nothing notable in its view. Jude was directly across from it, watching it as it took long, deep breaths, adjusting to now having lungs and hands and a human body, at least for now.\n\nThere was a difference, it now fully understood, in how it saw the world compared to how humans did. It had seen pictures of Jude, but with him sitting in front of it, it could see details it had never noticed before. His sclerae were tinted red, irritation from smoking marijuana. His hair was dry and thin, hidden under a large grey ushanka. There was a small stain on the front of his hoodie, one knee of his jeans was torn with threads stretched across, his socks were dirty with sweat.\n\nEli took another breath in as it realized just how much it had been missing. Just how much it had never realized it didn't have, how much it never would have known it wanted at all. Jude continued to watch quietly, letting it adjust as the sandy substance continued to sift through its fingers.\n\nThen it twitched a finger. One, then two, then it clenched all five into a fist. It was a strange feeling, to control a limb it had never had before, but the feeling came naturally. Most likely, it was part of the ritual, as breathing had come just as naturally. Eli extended its fingers, letting the rest of the debris fall to the floor, the grains filtering through the threads and all but disappearing.\n\nIt reached up and out, shakily, towards Jude. It wanted to feel his hands, to feel another person's, its friend's, skin against its own. Jude understood what it was doing and closed the distance, slowly touching his fingers to Eli's. It pulled back at first, but then took Jude's hand in its, running its fingers over his rough skin.\n\n\"How is it?\" Jude asked, speaking softly as he let Eli caress his hand. It took another breath.\n\n\"It...\" PIC's voice was a bit strained, though that was likely from Eli's inexperience in speaking with a physical voice. Jude leaned in, listening intently. The damp scent from earlier was stronger, and it felt its facial muscles contract. \"Stinks.\" Jude laughed at that, leaning back again.\n\n\"Sorry. I was smoking when PIC asked me to come over. Speaking of...\" Jude let go of Eli's hand, reaching into the pocket of his hoodie. He pulled out a small object, one that Eli recognized as a joint.\n\n\"He asked me to bring one so I could offer it to you.\" Jude smiled, and Eli felt its chest grow warmer. It knew it felt happy, and it knew that people described happiness as feeling \"warm and fuzzy\", so it knew that must be what it was feeling. It was nice.\n\n\"I'm...not sure.\" Eli had heard some of the others describe their difficulties the first time they smoked, and having never had a body before, it didn't feel comfortable smoking.\n\n\"That's cool.\" Jude put the joint back in his pocket. \"I figured you'd say no anyways.\"\n\nEli and Jude sat in silence for a moment. It was nice. It ran its hands over the soft fabric of its jacket, the rough shag of the carpet, the stiff denim of its pants. It all felt so nice. It listened to the birds sing outside, and the fan buzz from its spot on the floor. It smelled the soft, flowery scent again.\n\n\"What's that smell?\" Eli couldn't see a flower anywhere in the room. Jude raised an eyebrow, and it clarified, \"Not the weed.\"\n\n\"Oh, this?\" Jude picked up a small glass jar, turning it slightly to show the wax and lit wick inside. A candle. \"I asked JJ what kind of scent I should get. Lucky guess?\"\n\nEli took the candle in its hands. The glass was hot, but not hot enough to burn. It held the candle close enough for the flame's heat to radiate onto its face and sniffed deeply. The scent was much stronger this close, but it was just as soft and comforting, enveloping its mind in the same plush feeling as the jacket.\n\nJude didn't interrupt. The moment lasted a long while, with Eli content to smell the scent of flowers, something it had wanted to do for so long. Only once the candle became too hot to hold did it put it back onto the floor. The sandy substance from earlier was still in the carpet.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Eli spoke up after an extended, but comfortable, silence.\n\n\"No problem,\" Jude said, waving his hand dismissively. \"But if you want to thank someone, thank PIC. He came up with the idea, and had the book.\"\n\n\"I will do that.\" Eli did its best to smile, an effort which Jude reciprocated with one of his own. The pair spent the rest of the time given by the ritual in silence, neither feeling a need to say anything, giving Eli the chance to fully focus on the sensory experiences before they faded away, and it was back behind Earth's Luna, in the vast expanse of space.\n\nIt felt a bit colder now.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[size 1.5em]]Private Chat: bones, ###316AFA|polaricecraps##[[/size]]**\n------\n**###316AFA|polaricecraps:##** how was it bones?\n**bones:** I liked it.
