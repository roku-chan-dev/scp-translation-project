Names in yellow are pinch-hitters!\n\n++ The Entries\n\n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"+exquisite-corpse2020 -hub\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"rating\"]]\n[[size 120%]]**%%title_linked%%**[[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// **%%created_by%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n++ The Contest\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, an exquisite corpse “is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule… or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.” In this case, we’re challenging you to write an exquisite SCorPse: you will enter an Object Class, then write Containment Procedures for someone else’s Object Class, and then write a Description for someone else’s Object Class bolted to yet someone else’s Containment Procedures.\nAnd you won’t know what you’re getting until you get it. \n\n++ The Rules\n\n+++ Phase 0\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n# To enter, post a comment in the discussion thread of this page with an Object Class. That’s it. The Object Class must be one of the Primary Classes listed on the [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/object-classes |Object Classes]]] page. Explained is also allowed. \n * Combinations of the six base classes are allowed, but you may only combine two classes and they cannot be two classes simultaneously.  \"Safe (Formerly Keter)\" or \"--Euclid-- Neutralized\" are allowed, but \"Keter/Thaumiel\" and \"--Safe-- --Euclid-- --Keter--\" are not.\n * Esoteric and Decommissioned classes are //not// allowed. The Risk & Disruption classes from the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-classification-system-guide |ACS]]] are also not allowed.\n * You may enter at any time after the entry deadline closes until the contest ends, but you will be considered a //pinch hitter//: you will not be assigned an object class or containment procedures unless someone else has to drop out, at which point you will be PMed with details to fill in for them. Normal deadlines will still apply. \n * Pinch hitters do not need to submit an object class or containment procedures. They will only be assigned for the second phase of the contest, completing descriptions for submitted containment procedures on a first-come, first-serve basis. \n# In the spirit of the contest, you must write something new. You may write an existing idea, but you may not use any material from a pre-existing draft. This includes multimedia. No exceptions.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ Phase 1\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n# In the first phase of the contest, after entering, you will be given someone else's Object Class to write Containment Procedures for. \n * For the first phase, entrants will see a Google spreadsheet, linked from the contest page, that contains every entrant and their assigned Object Class on May 14.\n * You can solicit critique for this phase, but you //cannot// use the critique forums.\n * The Object Class you receive cannot be changed. \n * You may include images and other multimedia in the Containment Procedures you submit. \n * Instead of localizing the image in the Containment Procedures, you should simply add a link to the image source. Your coauthor will localize the image. Creative Commons license requirements still apply.\n# In order to proceed to the second phase of the contest, you //must// submit your containment procedures! Failure to do so will result in disqualification from the contest.\n * Do not add an SCP number to your containment procedures submission. Use some variation of \"SCP-XXXX\" or \"SCP-#\" or some other placeholder. \n# To submit your Containment Procedures, send them to either ([[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user ProcyonLotor]]) in a Wikidot PM, with subject line “Exquisite Corpse Entry”. Before sending the PM, wrap your containment procedures in a code block like so. **Please include your Object Class in the Containment Procedures Submission!**\n[[code]] \n[[code]] \nraw text of object class & containment procedures (including any wikidot formatting) goes here. \n[[/code]] \n[[/code]]\n# You can //only// resubmit your containment procedures to fix spelling/grammar errors or change the image source. In that case, you can resubmit them to either ([[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user ProcyonLotor]]) in a Wikidot PM, with subject line “Exquisite Corpse Entry Resubmission: Reason for resubmission here”.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ Phase 2\n\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n# In the second phase of the contest, you will be given someone else's Object Class & Containment Procedures to write a Description for. \n * For the second phase, the Object Class & Containment Procedures will be distributed to entrants by Wikidot PM.\n * You can solicit critique for this phase, and you //can// use the critique forums. Bear in mind that if you have never written anything before, you will be required to go through the greenlight process.\n * You may include images and other multimedia in your description. Localize them as well as any images sent in the Containment Procedures.\n * Addendums are considered to be part of the Description.\n * You may edit the Containment Procedures you receive, subject to the following restrictions:\n  * You may edit the Containment Procedures freely for localizing images, adjusting Wikidot formatting and syntax, adding or removing CSS, and fixing spelling/grammar/punctuation. The Risk & Disruption classes from the [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-classification-system-guide |ACS]]] are still disallowed.\n  * If you receive an image that is not compliant with our site license, you may replace it with a compliant image or remove the image outright.\n  * If you wish to edit the Containment Procedures further, you must preserve the original contributor's intent. Removing extraneous bits and redundant information is okay, but the original contributor must be able to recognize the containment procedures as their own and they must still be able to receive coauthor credit.\n  * If you feel that you received Containment Procedures which would be unusable without completely rewriting them, please reach out to a contest runner with details and we will decide whether or not you are allowed to do so.\n * If you recognize your containment procedures in someone’s draft, //keep it a secret!// Don’t tell them, or you’ll be disqualified. This does not, of course, extend to plagiarism. If you suspect someone is not your coauthor and has plagiarized your contribution, please contact a contest runner.\n# To submit your Description, simply combine it with the containment procedures and post the entry as an SCP to the site. Upon posting, ask a contest runner for the name of your coauthor and have the author metadata updated accordingly.\n# In addition to submitting your entry as a regular or -EX article (object class permitting), you may submit it as a -J article or an 001 Proposal.\n# This is a //solo contest//. Although you will be coauthoring with someone, your contribution to the corpse must be done by //yourself//. No one entry will have more than 2 coauthors, and no one entrant will have no more than 2 coauthored entries.\n# Only minor edits to entries are allowed after posting: spelling, grammar, image localization, etc. Major edits are prohibited until the contest ends. \n * The rule of thumb is that if you would not do it to another author’s article without their permission, you must wait till after the contest to do it to yours.\n# If at any time you feel unable to finish your submission, please let the contest runners know ASAP so they can arrange a pinch hitter for your would-be coauthor!\n# You may still post an article with your assigned containment procedures after the posting period closes, but they will not be considered contest entries. \n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n \nIn summary:\n* To enter the contest, post in the discussion page with an object class. Safe, Euclid, Keter, Thaumiel, Explained, Neutralized only.\n* In about two weeks, you'll get someone's object class. You'll have two weeks to write containment procedures for it, which you will submit to [[*user A Random Day]] or [[*user ProcyonLotor]] directly via Wikidot PM.\n* After all the containment procedures are submitted, you'll get someone's object class and someone else's containment procedures. You'll have three weeks to write a description for that and post it on the site as an article.\n* You may still post an article with your assigned containment procedures after the posting period closes, but they will not be considered contest entries. \n\n\n++ Important Dates (all times in EDT):\nAgain, if at any time you feel unable to finish your submission before the deadline, please let the contest runners know ASAP so they can arrange a substitute for your would-be coauthor! \n\n* **May 1:** Contest is announced!
