I'm a queer (she/it) game designer and author, and I've been on and off the wiki since about 2017. \n\nIn regards to WHAT I write, I'm a huge fan of SCPs and tales that focus on the wonder and mystery of the SCP Canon, as well as those that focus on the people that live inside it, not just scary monsters or weird things. If it's gonna be weird, make it as weird as possible!\n\nMy favorite authors at the moment are\n\n* William Gibson\n* Porpentine Charity Heartscape\n* Terry Pratchett\n* Jeff Vandermeer\n\nI love to write queer narratives, New Weird fiction, and absolute bizzaro shit. \n\nCatch ya' on the flipside!\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab WRITING]]\n\n+ PRE-HISTORY (2017 to 2020)\n//Stuff from the Way Back When.//\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/what-if-people-were-bees What If People Were Bees?]\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4328 SCP-4328 - Sinew and Cellulose]\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/and-i-d-let-that-lonesome-whistle-blow-my-blues-away And I'd Let that Lonesome Whistle Blow My Blues Away]\n\n+ THE BIRTH AND CYCLE OF MOTHER (2023 to....)\n//\"Bark Bark, Little Doggie\"...//\n[[[SCP-7389 |SCP-7389 - SUN/MOON CYCLE]]]\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab MY LINKS]]\n\n[*https://ko-fi.com/f3arofthedark My Ko-Fi!
