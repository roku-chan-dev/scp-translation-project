Towering spires of glass and steel reflected golden light, casting long shadows across the bustling streets below. Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes moved through the streets, their claws tapping against polished stone roads. \n\nIn a secluded laboratory atop the tallest spire, Dr. Kaarn, a wiry dromaeosaur, hunched over his workstation. His clawed hands deftly manipulated a holographic interface, streams of data cascading across the air before him. The room was cluttered with half-assembled devices, glowing crystals, and the faint hum of energy fields. Kaarn was on the verge of a breakthrough—a way to pierce the veil of time and glimpse into the distant past.\n\n“Kaarn, you’ve been here for days,” came a soft voice from the entrance. Kaarn’s mate, Lyra, stood there, his normally stoic eyes full of concern. “The hatchlings miss you. They keep asking when you’ll come home.”\n\nKaarn sighed, barely looking up. “We’ve been over this Lyra. I’m close, so close. Do you understand what this means? If I can stabilize the temporal aperture, we could learn the secrets of our ancestors. We could find the missing link, get irrefutable evidence on the origin of life, answer literally all of life’s biggest mysteries. With this breakthrough, we could even discover where the [[[scp-3834 | traveler]]] came from!”\n\n“And at what cost?” Lyra’s voice was heavy with frustration. “Your family needs you now, the past will be fine, it’s not going anywhere.”\n\nKaarn sighed again, but didn’t respond. Lyra lingered for a moment before turning and walking away, his tail swishing with disappointment. Kaarn’s eyes flicked toward the door, but he quickly forced himself back to his work. There would be time to make amends later, he told himself. There was always time.\n\nHours turned into days as Kaarn experimented and puzzled over his console. Time was stubborn, and fancied itself immutable. His scanners had detected old weaknesses, likely [[[scp-4003 | distortions in time]]] from past, but he needed a distortion in the present, or else he wouldn’t be able to establish a connection. Right when he was about to give up, the resistance suddenly gave way. \n\nKaarn was stunned, this didn't make sense. He had spent hours looking for any kind of weakness, something he could work with, and encountered nothing but the same unchanging barrier. It was like he spent hours trying to jimmy open a locked door, only to have that door vanish without a trace.\n\nBut he didn't have time to dwell on this. The machine hummed to life, a swirling vortex of light and energy forming in the center of the room. He had to act fast, he couldn't waste this opportunity. Kaarn’s claws trembled as he adjusted the controls, stabilizing the aperture. The swirling chaos resolved into an image.\n\nKaarn’s breath caught in his throat. There, in the shimmering portal, was a humanoid figure. It stood alone on a barren plain, its pale, emaciated body devoid of feathers or scales. Its arms hung unnaturally long at its sides, and its face… its face was grotesque. Kaarn felt an involuntary shiver run down his spine.\n\nThe air in the room seemed to grow colder, and shadows in the corners of the laboratory almost seemed to stretch and writhe. He instinctively reached for the capture device, a crystalline recorder designed to preserve images from the temporal stream. With a press of a button, the image was frozen in the crystal. Kaarn leaned closer to examine the figure, his curiosity overriding his unease.\n\n“What are you?” he whispered.\n\nFar above the planet, in the cold void of space, something stirred. A pale hand twitched. Empty eyes turned towards a distant speck. \n\nThe next day, Kaarn stood before the High Council of Zarnix, his discovery projected onto a grand display. The chamber was filled with the most brilliant minds of their age, each one eager to witness Kaarn’s achievement. As the image of the creature appeared, a murmur of awe and confusion rippled through the room.\n\n“This creature,” Kaarn began, “is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. It predates our species, perhaps predates all known life. It’s a glimpse into the unknown.”\n\nBut as the council members stared at the image, the atmosphere began to shift. A sense of unease seeped into the room, a primal fear none could explain. The creature’s face seemed to draw them in, a black hole for their thoughts. Suddenly, alarms pierced through the silence. Technicians rushed into the chamber, their faces pale.\n\n“There’s… something approaching the planet,” one of them stammered. “An object, and it’s moving fast!”\n\nPanic erupted. Council members shouted over one another as the image of the creature flickered and distorted on the display. Kaarn’s heart sank.\n\nOver the next 24 hours, the inhabitants of Zarnix Prime panicked as information trickled out. Scientists scrambled to devise solutions, some were trying to set up weapons that could intercept it, some were trying to draft up plans to evacuate underground. But nothing could be done. The object’s trajectory was unerring, its intent clear.\n\nRumors spread like wildfire. Some claimed to hear faint wails emanating from the sky, an otherworldly sound that sent chills down spines. A few claimed it was a hoax, in utter disbelief that this could happen with no warning. Many tried to leave the city, the bustling streets being filled beyond capacity. A shadow seemed to hang over the city, an oppressive force that made the air itself feel heavier. The collective fear became a living thing, a suffocating presence that hung over the city like a storm cloud.\n\nAs the second day dawned, the ground began to tremble. Buildings swayed, cracks spiderwebbed across the polished stone streets, and chaos consumed the city. Kaarn fled the council chamber, his mind racing. He had to get home. He had to see his family.\n\nThe streets were a nightmare. Dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes ran in every direction, trampling smaller dinosaurs underfoot, their cries of fear echoing through the crumbling city. Kaarn pushed through the crowd, his claws scraping against the stone as he sprinted. The air was thick with smoke and dust, the acrid scent of destruction burning his nostrils. He could not tell if it was from the cataclysm, or from the citizens. The sky was wrong, the object's descent casting the world in an eerie twilight.\n\nThe sounds of the city were drowned out by an otherworldly wail, a sound so vast and mournful it seemed to come from the earth itself. Some dinosaurs collapsed to the ground, clutching their heads, trying to convince themselves this wasn’t real. Others ran blindly, their eyes wide with terror.\n\nWhen he finally reached his home, he found Lyra and their hatchlings huddled together, their eyes wide with fear.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Kaarn said, his voice breaking. “I should have been here. I should have…”\n\nLyra pulled him close, his warmth grounding him for a brief moment. But their reunion was short-lived. Above them, the sky burned as the creature slammed into their world, its descent creating a trail of fire and destruction. The sheer force of its arrival shook the planet to its core.\n\nKaarn held his family tightly as a blinding light engulfed the world. In his final moments, he thought not of his work, but of the time he had wasted—time he could never get back.\n\nWhen the dust settled, their age of civilization, technology, and wonders was over. The impact had unleashed a cataclysm, wiping out nearly all life on Earth. The instrument of this grim conclusion had embedded itself miles beneath the planet’s surface, its pale hands covering its face. It let out a mournful wail that echoed through the tectonic plates, then fell silent, hidden and waiting.\n\nLife would begin again, in time. But the memory of that [[[scp-096 | ancient, unknowable force]]] would remain buried, waiting to be uncovered by the next curious species to walk the Earth.\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[size 150%]]{{>LOADING...}}[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]{{>LOADING...}}[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]{{>LOADING...}}[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]{{[[[scp-7368 | >SK-CLASS DOMINANCE SHIFT SUCCESSFUL]]]}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Dr DeSanta]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
