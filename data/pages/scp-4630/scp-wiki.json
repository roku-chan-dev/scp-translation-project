The cell is to be partitioned to allow for private interviews with each of the objects, but have the ability to open to allow free communication when not conducting interviews.\n\nSCP-4630-2 is to be kept in a separate soundproof hydroponics containment cell. SCP-4630-2 is to have psychological evaluations on a biweekly basis, designed to investigate the extent of the object's knowledge. The attending psychologist is not allowed to bring pencil, paper, or any form of information storing devices with them to the evaluations. All meetings are to be recorded directly to encrypted drives set to Level-5 clearance only. After meeting with SCP-4630-2, the attending psychologist is to be treated with Class-C amnestics to remove all knowledge of their time spent with SCP-4630-2. Attending psychologists are to be rotated after every meeting.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4630 is a head of //Lactuca sativa//, more commonly known as Iceberg Lettuce, which has gained sapience and a method of spoken communication through currently unknown, although suspected genetic[[footnote]]It is speculated that the method of spoken communication relies on a thaumaturgical component embedded in the genetic sequence, although this has not been corroborated at this time.[[/footnote]], means. Analysis of SCP-4630's genome has revealed substantial differences between its genetic code and that of a typical individual of //L. sativa//, collectively designated SCP-4630-A.\n\nInterviews with SCP-4630 have revealed that it believes itself to be a human researcher working at the Foundation under the name Doctor John Cabbage, although no such person was ever employed by the Foundation.\n\nExperiments with implanting different parts of the SCP-4630-A ANA[[footnote]]Anomalous deoxyriboNucleic Acid[[/footnote]] in additional subjects in the plant kingdom have resulted in additional sapient vegetables, designated SCP-4630-1 and SCP-4630-2. Due to the creation of SCP-4630-2, in spite of not being able to isolate the sapience granting string of genetic code, further experiments using this method have been suspended.\n\nSCP-4630, SCP-4630-1 and SCP-4630-2 have very little in common, apart from the following:\n* All of the objects have sapience.\n* All of the objects believe that they are human.\n* All of the objects believe that they have worked at the Foundation, despite no records existing to corroborate this.\n* All of the objects have names relating to the vegetable in a direct, or at least commonly misunderstood[[footnote]]Such as cabbage, //Brassica oleracea//, being from a completely different genus from Iceberg Lettuce.[[/footnote]], manner.\n\nFurther investigations into a connection between SCP-4630 and GoIs which have access to genetic modification technology is ongoing.\n\n**Discovery Log:** SCP-4630 was discovered in the lower most drawer of the refrigerator inside the Site-09 break room, when the object exclaimed he was being assaulted by a Junior Researcher as they were attempting to construct a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n= **AUDIO LOG 4630-A**\n----\n**DATE:** 24 February 2017\n\n**NOTE:** Initial interview with SCP-4630. Dr. Chong presiding. \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Good morning, SCP-4630.\n\n**SCP-4630:** Good morning, Doctor... uh, Chong is it? I am Doctor Cabbage, and you may refer to me as such.\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Very well, Doctor... Cabbage. Would you mind answering a few questions regarding your current state?\n\n**SCP-4630:** Oh, is it that bad? I thought I might be coming down with a cold. I was hoping that taking the day off would clear it up, but I suppose not.\n\n**Dr. Chong:** I was referring to your current state of //(pause)// being a head of lettuce, Dr. Cabbage.\n\n**SCP-4630:** What? A head of lettuce?\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-4630:** What are you talking about, Sir? I have never for a moment in my life ceased being a human being.\n\n//(silence for approx. 15 seconds)//\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Dr. Cabbage, you describe yourself as a doctor, but would you mind telling me what you are a doctor of?\n\n**SCP-4630:** On my diploma it says Biological Sciences, but I was hired at the Foundation for my work on thaumaturgical biology.\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Like DNA augmentation?\n\n**SCP-4630:** Through thaumaturgic means? Don't be silly, boy, that'd be impossible! The DNA structure is much too fine for the thaumaturgic methods we have today.\n\n**Dr. Chong:** But you did work with DNA? Through non-thaumaturgic means?\n\n**SCP-4630:** I don't know where all this talk about DNA came from, I'm just a biologist, not a geneticist. I study the phenotypical traits of thaumaturgic creatures, fairies, unicorns, and the like. Classic stuff.\n\n**Dr. Chong:** Alright, well... Thank you for your time, Dr. Cabbage.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n> {{ By order of Site Directorship }}\n> {{ Re: __SCP-4630-1 Experiment__ }}\n> ----\n> \n> {{The experiment to extract a quantity of SCP-4630-A and implant it into another host, designated SCP-4630-1, is APPROVED.
