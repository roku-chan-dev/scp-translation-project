Attempts to catalog further information through the SONARK Collaboration Project[[footnote]] Focused Time-Jumps attempting to gain firsthand accounts of lost anomalous societies to better understand current SCPs.[[/footnote]] are paused due to the considerations above. SCP-8016 entered Foundation custody through POI-4242: James █, a former employee of Prometheus Labs. \n\n**Description:** SCP-8016-A is a loose-leaf journal containing documentation regarding a point of time estimated to be two thousand years in the future following an SK-Class Dominance Shift Scenario[[footnote]], An event where another species or civilization surpasses humanity as the dominant species.[[/footnote]]. \n\nSCP-8016-A consists of reports gathered by POI-4242 & documentation offered by a group of entities following their discovery as an \"offering\" to their deities. Several sections of the journal are documented below.  \n\nThe entities designated SCP-8016-B are a sophont species inhabiting the remnants of a destroyed Foundation Facility in what was once eastern Nevada.\n\nThe instances appear to have a complete understanding of both written and spoken English outside of neologisms present in their own cultural dialect. \n\nAccording to the reports by POI-4242, the entities refer to themselves as \"Embefs.\" According to the reports, the entities stand between 2.1 and 2.4 meters tall and were never seen outside of a set of metallic armor, excluding their glowing blue eyes. POI-4242 noted that the instances' helms were oblong, projecting forward from their necks and that their lower limbs were digitigrade in form. The rest of the instances' bodies appear to follow a humanoid analog. It is currently unknown how deeply integrated the armor is to the entity contained within it.\n\nSCP-8016-B's can use either a bipedal or quadrupedal stance for locomotion, preferring the latter when moving quickly.\n\nAccording to POI-4242's observations, the instances ate and drank in private and did not appear to require sleep.\n\nSCP-8016-B's are reported to be a martial people with signs of thaumic and telepathic abilities:\nNoted Examples Include: \n* Manifestation of flames upon weaponry.\n* Drawing items to their hands from several meters away. \n* Healing wounds by touch.\n* Limited telepathic communication.\n\nPOI-4242 noted that devotion to two entities, the \"Dation\" and \"Their Wards,\" are cornerstones of their culture, as revealed in the documentation below. \n\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**__THE PLEA__**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n//The first section of SCP-8016 is a direct written appeal for aid from one of the commanding SCP-8016-B entities.// \n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n##black|**You are the Dation.**##\n\n##black|**I am Embef, as are we all.**##\n\n##black|**Your angel, this Sonark, has told me my words will reach you.**##\n\n##black|**I hope beyond hope this is true.**##\n\n##black|**We have lived in your silence all our lives.**##\n\n##black|**But the old stories remain in our hearts.**##\n\n##black|**We still follow your orders.**##\n\n##black|**While your silence has ever been comfortable for us, now, we need you to answer our prayers.**##\n\n##black|**I beg, I plead: the Ascension Wars have reached our bastion, Bios’ Reclaim, and their Gods walk with them.**##\n\n##black|**Our Wards are in danger.

Well, if you think a scouting mission is fantastical anyway.\n\n**Dr. Proft:** I would prefer if you treated this project with the gravity it deserves. You are about to embark on a trial run that will make or break this initiative. I would like the longevity of this project to be everlasting. I do not understand why you must meet everything with levity and humor.\n\n**POI-4242:** Well, it comes with loving your job, boss. It's something you Foundation types are encouraged not to do, yeah? Cold, not cruel. Cynical and clinical, not suave and savvy.\n\n//He winks at Church, who returns a small grin, while Proft grows redder in the face.//\n\n**Dr. Proft:** Just don’t mess this up for us, James.

One of the simian entities presses its face to the glass, smiling at him with bloody teeth.//\n\n**POI-4242:** I am not letting you take me. \n\n//It turns and lunges at the armored figure,  pummeling it, other entities returning to join in, pieces of metal being pulled away as the entity struggles under the blows.

Their mindsets are the true deciding factor, for they seek to do little more than destroy and consume. Many are workers of powerful magic, and they use it to bend folk of all stripes to their causes, forming small warbands and cults that stalk the borderlands and forge petty kingdoms. Some find prominence amongst the other Enemy, but in the case of those within the New Children's hordes, they are subservient slaves and war beasts.\n\n**Obscure:** Delcas are savage and unpredictable, so there are no set patterns for hiding from them. Looking away from one can be salvation at one time and a death sentence at another. If you encounter one of the beasts stalking the surface unprepared, it is best to hunker down and pray to the Dation that it passes you by. \n\n**Condemn:** Our greatest weapons and most potent convictions must be brought to bear to slay Declas. Many return after death; others shrug off the wounds of sword, bow, and blazer like the bites of flies. Some are not even truly alive. Crippling blows are best, for slowing them down is often all that can be done without the sacred Ano-Melodies, and if one must die to ensure the safety of others, the Dation has willed it. Your sacrifice will be remembered.\n\n**Preserve:** The Wards are never to be exposed to the Declas, for the infernal beasts want nothing more to consume or twist them into their image. The Declas Cults are a constant thorn, and if it were not for the rumbles of the Ascension War, I would push for a crusade against any and all that dare to settle near the Reclaim.\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The Spirelings\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Scions of Flesh**\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=Spirelings.2.png | caption=Heraldry | width=300]]\n\n**Visage:** Spirelings are a small and erudite folk, though they turn their vast intelligence to the warping of the natural. They are birds of black or crimson feathers, with sharp pointed beaks and eager talons. The largest of their kind, their dreaded Carrion Priests, can stand to chest height, while most remain no bigger than a rabbit. Yet their magic is strong and primarily focused on warping flesh and feather. Ivory-bladed wings, chocking tendrils, and extending talons, they weaponize their own forms as easily as they warp others into adornments, houses & wandering food stores. \n\n**Obscure:** Their eyes are keen, always hunting for the glimmer of glass and metal beneath the sun, so when entering Spireling territory, camouflaging your second skin is paramount. Only the fleet of foot and the small of stature should attempt this passage, for their sentinels are everywhere, and their cries can echo for miles. The harder it is to be noticed, the better. \n\n**Condemn:** For all their magic, Spirelings are quite easy to kill. Our second skins gird well enough against their bone weapons, and for the weaker initiates of their faith, a single strike with a fist or blade can end them. A Spireling staying dead is another matter entirely, as their wounds knit close and their hearts can return to pumping if the body is left whole enough. Blazers are best, feather, flesh, and bone, reduced to ash. \n\n**Preserve:** The Spirelings wish to corrupt the Wards, believing that if they are bent and broken into twisted furniture or lumbering feed beasts, they will prove to all others they alone have a right to Ascend. This must never come to pass. If the Spirelings breach the walls of Reclaim, pray to Dation that never comes, ignite the Fire Within and deny them everything.\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The Rustless Conclave\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Scions of Metal**\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=Rustless.2.png | caption=Heraldry | width=300]]\n\n**Visage:** The Rustless are like us more than any other Folk. For they, too, are wrapped in second skins. Yet, where our traditions are passed from mother to child throughout the ages of our people, theirs are ever-changing, ever-gleaming. Constant noise proceeds them: the chorus of clicking gears and hissing steam. Their second skins dwarf us by several magnitudes, yet it is within that they differ most deeply. For where we are entirely flesh and bone beneath, they are water. Only at the very center of their beings is their true aquatic form visible, a pulsing mass of color-shifting flesh and tentacles. \n\n**Obscure:** The Rustless view the world through a single port at the front of their beings. This allows them to be flanked fairly easily. Our similar forms can allow careful and swift Embefs to disguise themselves in their ranks for a time. Still, if discovered, flight is better than fight, for their weapons can penetrate our second-skins with relative ease.\n\n**Condemn:** Melee is not encouraged when facing a Rustless; they are stronger and sturdier, and their clicking weapons seem tailor-made to dismantle us. Yet, one glaring weakness can be taken advantage of if forced into melee or from a distance—their cyclopean glass eye. A hard-headed spear or a direct shot can shatter it, causing its life-preserving fluids to seep freely into the soil. Most will retreat at this point, yet for the persistent, pushing further with the spear or another shot can silence them permanently if you are lucky. Of course, with the coming of war, many have taken to wearing braces and covers that better guard this weak point. \n\n**Preserve:** The Rustless do not seek to slay or consume our Wards. They seek to take them. They believe they can protect them better than us but wish to make them into their own image, locking the innocent beings within metal shells and parading them as examples of their prowess. This, they say, is the desire of their Assembling God. If the Reclaim is taken, it is better to flee with the Wards than allow them to be forced to confront forces so familiar to us they would trust them instinctually. \n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The Suntouched\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Curious Wanderers**\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=Suntouched.2.png| caption=Heraldry | width=300]]\n\n**Visage:** The Suntouched are the largest folk we have encountered. Even the smallest stands two meters taller than us. They have thick grey hide, often covered with artful swirls of color. Four thick legs ferry them across the Long Grasses, and a thick tendril that protrudes from their face is how they interact with most of the world. They are devout people, followers of the Sun Sister, and their team is mighty indeed, allowing them to call down pillars of flame, heal grievous wounds, and expedite the growth of plant life. Largely peaceful, they have stayed out of much of the Ascension War and are considered Enemy only for the fickle nature of their deity. Yet, when pressed to fight, little can stand in their way, such as wood, stone, or steel; it matters not. Their great strength and burning visages can surge through anything in their path.  \n\n**Obscure:** So far, we have been able to walk openly in the lands of the Suntouched, and they are willing to trade with us, offering food and medicine for our crafted armaments and gathered information. Of course, as the world grows increasingly strained, we must guard the trails from the Reclaim and muddy the paths that ferry us between our home and their nearest citadel. \n\n**Condemn:** Suntouched have yet to confirm they are truly our enemies. Yet, we still must prepare for that eventuality even if Ethek demands our grace. They are sturdy and mighty beings, but while surefooted on the open plains, it is increasingly apparent they are less confident in other terrains. Pitfalls and other leg-based traps would work wonders to bring them down to be finished off by blade and spear. Yet, their magic is a truly worrisome thing to consider. Searching for that of our own that can negate or lessen the effect of their fire on our second skins is paramount.\n\n**Preserve:** The Suntouched have so far shown little interest in our Wards. Worrisome, however, in comparison to the other Enemy, is their deep interest in the Ano-Melodies. Directed by their goddess, they attempt to open the Dation's sacred labyrinths, excavating entire complexes and attempting to reach the weapons hidden within. This must be curbed before they release something they cannot control, particularly because they do not seem to understand the difference between a Labyrinth and a Declas Den. \n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ The New Children\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Revenge Incarnate**\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=Children.2.png | caption=Heraldry | width=300]]\n\n**Visage:** These Folk share the closest resemblance to lost humanity. Their appearances can vary, some with elongated arms and lengthy red fur, others with conical heads and silvered pelts, but most are squat and well-muscled. They all have sharp fangs and dress in bones, furs, and skins of the things they slay. They live far above the ground in their forest homes, and all are capable climbers, their feet being more akin to hands. Compared to other Folk, they have little magic, relying on brute might and savage instinct. They are disarmingly strong and prefer weapons that wound and maim over flat-out kill, savoring the pain and battle over a clean death for their victims. Yet, their leader, the King, taller and bipedal compared to his kin, has the ability to tame Declas, like their horrid hunting packs proceeding his armies and the lumbering monstrosity that carries his throne. \n\n**Obscure:** To venture into the Children's Forest is to dance with death, no matter the attempts at stealth. If their scouts do not see you, their traps will snare you, and if you escape them, their King's pets will scent you. To enter the wood is to do so brazenly, enshroud in a third-skin and armed with every weapon you can carry. You cannot hide, so you must fight. To give them a reason to respect and fear you.\n\n**Condemn:** The New Children do not die easy, though it is not magic that keeps them from its doors, but pure, brutal determination. A dying Child can take at least three others if adequately armed, and even our second-skins are not enough to withstand a continual battering by a Child in its death throes. Any weapon will work; turning your kill into a message is key. Grievous wounds leave a required message, so let brutality lead you even if it flies in the face of Ethek's teaching. \n\n**Preserve:** The New Children seek our Wards for one reason, and one reason only: to slay and consume them. By gorging themselves on their flesh and blood, they will finally take revenge for a slight long forgotten by our people. They are willing to kill any of the other Enemy in their path to Ascension, yet their eyes are most securely locked on our Walls. I predict they will attack soon, bringing all their King has claimed to bear. Their scouts seek new Declas Dens as we speak. We must ensure they never return to the dark boughs of their homeland. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**__THE INTERIM__**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n//This section includes private correspondence from POI-4242 and SCP-8000-B's leadership and a recording of a conversation between the pair.//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **PROBLEMS**\n----\n**DATE:** 06/22/40--\n\n**NOTE:** A report recorded by POI-4242 upon his entrance to the SCP-8000-B stronghold.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//POI-4242's helmet camera turns on, looking out at a vacant courtyard, a bonfire burning at the center, around which several SCP-8000-B instances move.

I am but the messenger.\n\n**Embef Cali:** Respect is due, even for a messenger of the Dation, and please, your grace, call me Cali.\n\n**POI-4242:** Of course, what did you wish to discuss with me?\n\n//She turns back to the doors.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** That is a matter to be discussed in private.\n\n//She pushes the doors open, revealing what was once a medical amphitheater; she gestures for him to follow, descending into the center, five large murals covering the far wall, an altar at each of their bases.//\n\n**POI-4242:** What is this place?\n\n**Embef Cali:** The house of the Dation, I thought it would bring you comfort.\n\n**POI-4242:** It.... does.\n\n**Embef Cali:** Our people first found their purpose here.\n\n**POI-4242:** Really?\n\n//The instance turns to look at him, tilting her head.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You didn't know this?\n\n//He pauses, tapping the side of his helm.//\n\n**POI-4242:** What do I...right.\n\n//He composes himself and taps the button.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Sonark?\n\n**POI-4242:** Apologies.\n\n//She points towards his helmet, mimicking his gesture.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Do they speak to you?\n\n//She gestures to the statues.//\n\n**POI-4242:** No. I pause for guidance, but little is given, and I apologize, Cali. I do not recall the history of your people. I fear the wounds left by the Enemy that have left me scattered.\n\n//The Commander approaches, her hands glowing with energy.//\n\n**Ember Cali:** I would be honored to heal any wound, regardless if clarity returns with its patching or not. \n\n//POI-4242 steps back.//\n\n**POI-4242:** There is no need; I will heal in a short time. Save your… gifts for those who may be in dire need. \n\n**Embef Cali:**Very well.  I would gladly tell you about our history if you would like to hear it. \n\n**POI-4242:** Then please speak.\n\n//She nods and shifts around the room. The camera on POI-4242's shoulder spins around, revealing various murals and smaller shrines scattered amongst the decayed seats above them and the walls behind them; even the domed roof is scrawled with markings.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** This world was not always ours. Surely you know this.\n\n**POI-4242:** That is known to me, yes.\n\n**Embef Cali:** It was theirs.\n\n//She gestures to the murals.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Admathos Thousand-Words, the Faceless, God of Knowledge & Mysteries, he would make us and grant us understanding.\n\n//The mural depicts a looming cloaked figure, tendrils reaching from beneath, a singular eye in the center of its face.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Ovive of the High Table, the Everseeing, Goddess of Order & Readiness, she who guides our path.\n\n//The depiction is of a thirteen-headed serpent coiling around itself, all eyes gazing directly down at them.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Ethek Comte, the Gentle, God of Mercy & Caretakers, he who taught us the folly of cruelty.\n\n//The depiction is of a white, formless figure surrounded by blue flames.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Emtef Red-Hands, the Ascendant Army, God of War & Hunting, whose many arms gave us the means to defend ourselves and our Wards.\n\n//The depiction is of a trio of heavily armored figures, their right hands a vibrant red.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** And Bios Claim-Forger, the Defender, Goddess of Architecture & Craftsmanship, who forged our home and taught us how to maintain it.\n\n//The depiction is a humanoid feminine face with a soft smile and cracking solid green eyes.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** The Dation walked the surface of the lands known to us and those far across the bitter waters. Humanity was under their care, and the world was good. It was a time of paradise, and while many Gods sought humanity's devotion, only they truly earned it, for in their power, they could lock those other lesser divinities away.\n\n//She approaches him, her voice raising in pitch.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** They crafted the Ano-Melodies, great works of magic & edifices of tech that saw humanity benefit again and again. They locked away the dreaded Declas, removing their blighted existence from the world's surface. But then came the Fall.\n\n**POI-4242:** Apologies, but what is the Fall?\n\n//She tilts her head and takes a step back.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We don't know, but it was the end of humanity. A Declas that escaped the Dation's gaze? A jealous God reaping of their garden? A folly that humanity brought upon itself, ignoring their righteous advice? You would know better than the Embef, for they became the Dation's eternal enemy.\n\n//She backs into a guarded stance, staring him up and down.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You should know.\n\n//He raises his hands placatingly.//\n\n**POI-4242:** Calm yourself, dear Cali, but a test of your truthfulness. You impress me with your honesty. Please continue.\n\n//Embef Cali nods, though her stance remains guarded.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** In the final hours of that dreaded time, they made us, The Embef, and charged us with protecting the Wards, their last work on this world, before they left it to hunt the being that brought this calamity down upon their lost followers.\n\n//She turns, staring up at the murals.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We have remained devoted to this charge for centuries. We have faced numerous challenges: the Declas Siege, the Emergence of the Spirelings, and the Fall of Second Claim. Yet only recently have things become dire enough for us to seek the great weapons you left behind: the Ano-Melodies.\n\n**POI-4242:** Why do you seek them? For what purpose would you awaken the creations of the Dation?\n\n//She looks at him, her shoulders falling.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Have they truly gone so far from us that they can not see our plight?\n\n**POI-4242:** They are far from this place, yes, but you are not abandoned; why else would they send me?\n\n//She nods, shifting her stance.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** The Ascension War, the product of the other folk that have risen across the face of this world, though they are not the Dation's children, not like us or humanity before us. They are the children of the divinities they pushed aside.\n\n//Her hands curl into fists.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We are not numerous, and for so long, the Dation has been silent, yet the Enemy is innumerable, and their Gods stand with them; we have felt their presence.\n\n//She darts forward, wrapping her hands around POI-4242's shoulders.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** I beg your forgiveness and the Dation's; I had thought we had been forgotten. They release Declas and attempt to steal the Ano-Melodies, besmirching the Dation's legacy, and they are preparing to come for us. We need help; otherwise, they will slaughter us and all we have built and protected!\n\n**POI-4242:** It... you are forgiven, and I promise that help will come.\n\n//She releases him, pulling away.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Help already exists; we need to be given leave to open the labyrinths and retrieve the Ano-Melodies for ourselves. The keys have long been hidden; the Dation need simply reveal them to us.\n\n//She pauses, looking up beyond him; he turns to catch sight of a slight pale figure looking down at them from amongst the dilapidated chairs.//\n\n**POI-4242:** What-\n\n//The being bolts, rushing back out the doors. Cali shakes her head and makes a sound that sounds like a laugh.//\n\n**POI-4242:** What was that? Are we in danger?\n\n**Embef Cali:** Dation no! That was one of the Wards, allowing their curiosity to get the better of them.\n\n**POI-4242:** A Ward?\n\n//Embef Cali freezes, and her stance becomes immediately guarded once again.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You claim to forget them as well?\n\n**POI-4242:** I...\n\n//Embef Cali stalks towards him, her hand inching towards her blade.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You claim that your memory fails, then say you are simply testing me when it comes to knowledge you should know. You should know it! But I am willing to trust... desperate to trust that you are what you say.\n\n**POI-4242:** Cali, I-\n\n**Embef Cali:** No. Forgive me, Sonark, but for all my faith… no, because of it, I can not stomach the idea that the Dation would allow you to forget the reason for my people’s being. Is anything you have told me true? Or have I, as some of my people fear, been a fool and allowed a Declas into our midst?\n\n//She begins drawing her blade.//\n\n//POI-4242 falls to one knee, bowing his head low to the ground; Cali pauses, stepping back.//\n\n**POI-4242:** You’re right to doubt me, and I am sorry that your Gods have been silent for so long. I truly am, but if… you really want them to hear you and see what you need from them, then you can trust me. I am just an explorer… but I can also be a messenger if that is what you need. \n\n**Cali:** Are you even of the Dation?!\n\n//He bows his head lower.//\n\n**POI-4242:** I am, but… they are not as aware of what has transpired here as you hoped. Again, I am sorry that I thought it better to act the fool or the guide than be honest in my ignorance. I want to learn, and I want to help. \n\n//She stares at him silently. He looks up at her and continues.//\n\n**POI-4242:** I said that I had come seeking knowledge and that I would ferry your words to your gods, and I will once my machine is recovered.\n\n//She examines him, staring at his helmet.//\n\n**Cali:** Does that allow you to speak with them? Can they see what you see?\n\n**POI-4242:** It can, and they will. \n\n//She reaches for his helmet.//\n\n**Cali:** Then perhaps I’m unmasking you. I can find the answers I seek.\n\n//He pulls away.//\n\n**POI-4242:** No! Please, I need this. I can’t… be in your world without it. \n\n//She shakes her head and seems to laugh.//\n\n**Cali:** That is the most conviction you have spoken with yet, and it rings of the traditions the Dation gave us…. You honestly wish to help me, help my people?\n\n//POI-4242 nods.//\n\n**POI-4242:** Yes, but to do so, I need to learn. Allow me to catalog your knowledge, and I swear on my life it will reach them.\n\n//She is silent for several moments, looking at the camera on his shoulder.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Does that, too, allow the gods to see and hear us?\n\n//He detaches it from his suit and turns it over in his hands.//\n\n**POI-4242:** Yes, though they will not be able to respond to you immediately.\n\n**Embef Cali:** May I make use of it to speak to them alone?\n\n**POI-4242:** Yes, of course. \n\n//He hands it to her. She takes it and then reaches her other hand down.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Stand Explorer. \n\n//POI-4242 takes her hand and stands, and she holds the camera out to him.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You will show me how to use this?\n\n**POI-4242:** Of course.\n\n**Embef Cali:** Then we have an agreement. If you truly wish to catalog our world and grant this knowledge to the distant Dation, then I suggest starting with our maps. Come, I will show you to the Caretakers.\n\n//She turns, waving for him to follow him. He taps the side of his helmet the moment her back turns.//\n\n**POI-4242:** That... could have gone worse.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block | name=Dation.png | caption= Depictions of the Dation | width= 700px | align=center]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **SUSPICION**\n----\n**DATE:** 06/23/40--\n\n**NOTE:** An accidental recording of the SCP-8016-B's leadership following her confrontation with POI-4242.  \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//The camera turns on, catching the side of Embef Cali's legs.

He stands from the chair, staring at Dr. Proft with pure white eyes, more fire than flesh.//\n> \n> **POI-4242:** ##5ad6ff|**I became the Messenger Sonark.**##\n> \n> //He continues to burn for several moments, speaking to the doctor, but what he says is overpowered by the sound of the fire, and then he collapses, unconscious.//\n> \n> **<End Log.>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** POI-4242 is currently under observation. Following a week-long coma, he is lucid, with little memory of the event or his return to the Foundation, and shows no current signs of permanent anomalous capabilities.\n\nFollowing the cessation of the first viewing of the recording stored on POI-4242's camera, the computer it was playing on began to glitch before exploding, injuring two of the observing scientists. In its place was a small portal, a square of blue and green. The lab was immediately locked down, and personnel were evacuated from the room, allowing the Temporal Anomalies Department personnel to investigate. \n[[/div]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-8016-C is a one-meter-wide rectangular portal currently contained within former Lab-114 at Site 12. The portal is opaque when viewed from the sides. When looked at head-on, it transitions to reveal the room from the recording.\n\nThe object is a link between the site and SCP-8016-B's domicile, as instances have been seen moving about the room. Unlike Foundation personnel, the instances do not appear to be aware of the object's presence.\n\nHowever, sound can be transmitted, as muffled conversation from the other side of the portal has been recorded, and noise produced on the Foundation side of the object has been observed to cause a reaction from the -B instances on the other side. \n\nRegarding the events with POI-4242 upon their return, any testing regarding SCP-8016 is suspended as the O-5 Council deals with the ramifications of further interaction with the SCP-8016 instances through -C or the SONARK Project.\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**__THE HOPE__**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n//The final piece of the information given to the Foundation by SCP-8016-B instances was contained within the camera given to them by POI-4242. it had been covered in sigils believed to be sacred to the instances.//\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**A Hope: Yours and Ours**\n\n**Date:** 6/22/40██\n\n**Speaker:** Embef Cali, High Commander of Reclaim\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//The video opens with the commander seated at a metallic desk; behind them are standards and flags bearing symbols taken from Foundation iconography and those analogous to numerous current GOIs. The map presented as part of gifted documentation rests on the far wall, covered in notations, and a massive blade rests against the door frame. They begin speaking..// \n\n**Embef Cali:** I gladly greet you, My Dation. I am Embef Cali, leader of my people, but for all your…Sonark speaks of ignorance, I would hope you know this already.\n\n//She leans in, her glowing blue eyes staring intensely into the camera.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** But if, as part of me whispers, he is false, we have taken precautions to hide the whole truth from him. You once told our people that you had left things for us to use in the worst of circumstances. If we have been fooled- if I have been fooled- they stand ready.\n\n//She looks up at the ceiling.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** But I hope beyond hope that the messenger is true and will ferry this to you as swiftly as he can, even if he is not all I wish him to be. \n\n//She sighs and turns to the map.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** The Enemy, for all their fighting with each other, march ever closer to Reclaim. We are not strong enough to hold off them all. We need the Ano-Melodies to balance the scales.\n\n//She turns back to the camera.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Only you, oh Dation, can give them to us. You locked the knowledge away when you left and hid it from us until we could stand on our own.\n\n//She looks down, knitting her metallic fingers together.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** If I may be honest, it has felt as if we have been standing alone for quite some time. The Wards are ever with us, but they are not fighters. That is not their purpose. But you...\n\n//She pauses and composes herself for a moment.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** You were their guardians once, and when you gave that mission to us, we took it without question. We have followed, ever loyal, never straying. Yet, our enemies march with their Gods all around them; they hear their voices, they wear their faces, and some even walk alongside them!\n\n//She slams her fist down and stands. Behind her, the door to her room slowly creeps open.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We have not failed you, but you have been silent for.... for so long. I had worried that you had forgotten us in your hunt for the slayer of humanity. \n\n//She sits down and leans forward once again. A short figure is seen sneaking into the room behind her.// \n\n**Embef Cali:** Your other enemies have returned and forged new threats for us. They seek the Wards. They seek what you ordered us to protect since the creation of our race. Please help us defend the legacy you made for us. Grant us more than a messenger.\n\n//She pauses and puts her head in her hands, muttering to herself too softly for the camera to hear.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** I...\n\n//She pauses, glancing over. A small furred head rises into view beside the Embef, revealing a young human-like child between 3 and 5 years of age. The commander chuckles.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Hello, little Ward. May I help you?\n\n//The being grins up at her and holds up a flower, which she takes gently.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** How beautiful. Thank you.\n\n//The being peers above the table, staring at the camera.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** This is a wonder of Dation, little one, through which I speak an important message.\n\n//The being gasps and pulls itself higher, staring at the camera with awe. The commander reaches over and gently ruffles their hair.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** They still have their curiosity, joy, and kindness. They are beautiful beings and have changed little since you all went away.\n\n//She looks back at the camera.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We hope that at least you will find it heartening, oh Dation.\n\n//The being clambers further up onto the table, tilting their head slightly, and the commander gently picks them up, holding them close to her.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We have followed in the footsteps our Father Admathos set without wavering.\n\n//She places the child on her lap and reaches up for her helm, staring into the camera.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Our Ward: Humanity remains. \n\n//She begins pulling her helm free.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** What you asked of us came so naturally, and it still does.\n\n//She pulls the helm free, revealing a canid face closely resembling that of a Golden Retriever, though altered, shorter of muzzle, more humanoid in its panes.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** We are still, and always will be, Man’s Best Friend.\n\n//She smiles down at the child and they giggle.//\n\n**Embef Cali:** Will you help us?\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"The Bond\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[include component:image-block | name= Embef.png | caption= Of Ward & Guardian (Sketch by Dr. Church) | width= 700px | align=center]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8015]]] | SCP-8016 | [[[SCP-8017]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Map of the Known.4\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53489495348/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** Declas\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53486428477/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** Spirelings\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53487638734/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** Rustless\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53486428582/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** Suntouched\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53487638839/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** The Children\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53487750755/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** The Dation\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:**[https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/53522871172/in/dateposted-public/]\n\n> **Filename:** The Ward and The Guardian\n> **Author:** IllustradedMenagerie\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:**[https://www.deviantart.com/illustratedmenagerie/art/The-Ward-and-The-Guardian-1020234460]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
