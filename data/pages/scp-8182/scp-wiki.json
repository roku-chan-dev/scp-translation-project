SCP-8182 has demonstrated minor physical capabilities, being able to displace objects weighing up to 5kg. With the exception of D-8182, SCP-8182 can not be perceived without the aid of specialized ectological equipment. D-8182 is a 23 year old human female. Prior attempts at isolating SCP-8182 have resulted in severe psychological distress in both entities. Due to ease of containment and low priority no further attempts are to be made at this time. \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8182 was initially discovered and contained on October 21st, 2024. Please see addenda for associated logs. \n\n\n\n------\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 8182-1:\" hide=\"Addendum 8182-1:\"]]\n[[<]]\n \n> = **DISCOVERY LOG 8182-1**\n> ----\n> **DATE:** October 21st, 2024 5:23 pm\n> \n> **PREFACE:** On September 6th, 2024, D-8182 was placed on Foundation Watchlist E-8000-24 after foundation AI within the American Psychiatric System flagged their reported hallucinations as potentially anomalous in nature. D-8182’s personal electronic devices were subsequently implanted with standard foundation monitoring programs. Recorded audio and video logs have been filtered and enhanced by Site 12’s ectology department.\n> ----\n> **<BEGIN LOG>**\n> \n> //D-8182 is located at the bathroom sink in their apartment.

I mean how will you know if you never even give them a chance.\n> \n> **D-8182:** Don’t be a lech. I’m not dating girls just so you can get off.\n> \n> **SCP-8182:** I didn’t mean it like that.

You might as well try dating a cop.\n> \n> **D-8182:** Phft… what do you know. He seems empathetic enough.\n> \n> **SCP-8182:** But that’s what I’m saying. With these nerdy introvert types its hard to tell just over text if they have some fucked up worldview.\n> \n> **D-8182:** You were a nerdy introvert type.\n> \n> **SCP-8182:** Yeah but I changed for you.\n> \n> //D-8182 snorts and begins to apply makeup.//\n> \n> **D-8182:** Jokes aside I need you to promise me that you’ll at least try to be mature.\n> \n> //SCP-8182 rests their head on D-8182’s shoulder.//\n> \n> **SCP-8182:** I promise.\n> \n> **<END LOG>**\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 8182-2:\" hide=\"Addendum 8182-2:\"]]\n[[<]]\n> = **DISCOVERY LOG 8182-2**\n> ----\n> **DATE:** October 21st, 2024 6:32 pm\n> \n> **PREFACE:** The following log was retrieved from Granger’s Restaurant and Bar’s internal security camera feed.

But I was in band in high school and we would play the score for the school’s musicals. But uh, just between you and me, I was only in the band to get closer to the band girls. Y’know real overachiever nerdy types. I actually thought I had a chance. Ha! \n> \n> **Hostess:** Here are your drinks.\n> \n> **Civillian:** Oh thank you. But anyway, community theatre.
