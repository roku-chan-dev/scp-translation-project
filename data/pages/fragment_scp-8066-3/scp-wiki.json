I need to show you something.\"\n\nVerity barely glances up. \"Is it important? I need to get this finished before midnight.\"\n\n\"Come here,\" he repeats and drags himself into the office, visibly limping. Has he hurt his leg? Is he drunk? His speech has a slurred quality, like he's not sure how to form the syllables. In the gloom of her office she can barely make out his expression. \"I need to show you something.\"\n\n\"Dr. Owings?\" Verity asks, mouth going dry. He lurches forward, looming like a horrible monument, features slack. \"Randall? What's this about?\"\n\n\"Come here.\" Owings enters the lamplight and she finally sees -- //he doesn't have any eyes.// His sockets are empty pits. Looking into them, she feels a wave of a nausea and vertigo, like she's about to fall in. He grabs her by the arm, fingers digging in painfully. \"I need to show you something.\"\n\nOn sudden, terrified impulse, Verity takes the lamp with her other hand and slams it into the side of his head. There is barely any resistance; the left hemisphere of his head caves in like paper mache, like it's just skin with nothing inside it. //He's just skin.// Owings' grip does not loosen.\n\n\"Come here. I need to show you something.\"\n\nSuddenly, more people are flooding into the office. Agent Lugosi and Dr. Louef and Intern Zucco and others besides. Each eyeless and grasping, repeating the same horrible demand. When they force her to the ground and start the laborious process of hollowing her out, she can still hear it.\n\n//\"I need to show you something. I need to show you something. I need to show you something.\"//\n\n//\"Come here.

Her lungs burn, her legs ache.\n\nAs she runs, the walls change. Smooth beryllium bronze gives way to rusting iron, which turns to concrete, then unhewn stone. The walls close in, narrowing, and she is forced to press herself through thinner and thinner gaps,  scraping away layers of skin with each convolution. And still, she pushes forward. She has no other choice.\n\nThe corridors narrow yet further and now the crack of bone is heard as the researcher shoves herself through spaces that a human body should not be able to fill. Skin shreds and muscles rupture and Jo wishes, in vain, to scream.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-106\n\n**BOX:** A clean and lovely place.\n\n----\n\nThere is an elderly janitor. His back is stooped and his ashen skin is withered and his uniform is so filthy as to be nearly black. Dark, ichorous fluid drips from his nostrils to tarnish the pristine, white tiles beneath his frayed boots.\n\nThe Overseer says, \"Wipe that up,\" and he does. The Overseer says, \"Clean the bathrooms,\" and he obeys, even as his touch dissolves the pipes of the toilets, sending torrents of contaminated water across the floor. The Overseer says, \"Be happy,\" and he smiles. He is happy.\n\nThe clean place overflows with a pure, searing light that he can see even when he presses his palms over his eyes. There are a thousand rooms to tend to, and each room crowds with colorless people. They are loud and smiling with lacquered teeth and the light passes through them like cold wind.\n\nThe Overseer says, \"Be happy,\" and the old man bites clean through his lower lip with the force of his grin.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** Dr. Eugene Japers\n\n**BOX:** [[span class=\"rev-green\"]]The desecrated sanctuary[[/span]].\n\n----\n\nThe thing that calls itself Eugene Japers wakes up lashed to a long table in [[span class=\"rev-green\"]]the forest where singing is no longer heard[[/span]]. There are figures crowded around the table, chattering to one another excitedly and jostling for a space, like guests at a fantastic feast.\n\nEugene opens his mouth to -- //what? negotiate? beg for mercy?// -- but no words come out. Instead, a name crawls up his throat and out of his mouth, glistening and beetle-winged. The host of the party plucks the name from his swollen lips and bites down on it, chewing leisurely.\n\n[[span class=\"rev-blue\"]]\"How does it taste?\"[[/span]] asks a guest, visibly drooling.\n\n[[span class=\"rev-yellow\"]]\"It's tart,\"[[/span]] says the host. [[span class=\"rev-yellow\"]]\"Quite tart. I think I'll try another.\"[[/span]] It wipes its mouth with its sleeve, smearing name-juice. [[span class=\"rev-yellow\"]]\"Fetch me a blade.\"[[/span]]\n\nSomeone passes the host a chipped cleaver. Holding the dull blade up to the light, it meets Eugene's eyes for the first time and grins, like they're sharing a private joke. [[span class=\"rev-yellow\"]]\"What do you think the rest will taste like?\"[[/span]] it asks. Then it reaches down and it cuts off Eugene's left index finger.\n\nNames, one by one, begin to trickle out of the newly-formed stump. Eugene opens his mouth to cry out in pain, but no sound comes -- instead, even more names come scrabbling up his throat, fluttering and ink-stained. The guests take this as their cue to eat, each grasping for a name, as the host continues to cut away at Eugene's hand.\n\n//Thunk.// Middle finger.\n\n//Thunk.// Ring finger.\n\n//Thunk.// Pinky.\n\n//Thunk.// Thumb.\n\nEugene breathes heavily, sodden with sweat. Names dribble out of the corner of his mouth. Someone is saying something, but the words haze together. The pain is too much. He cannot bear it.\n\nThe host reaches for his right hand.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** Dr. Randall Owings\n\n**BOX:** Home\n\n----\n\nThere is a box at the center of the universe and it is full of meat.\n\nRandall Owings suspends from the ceiling like a butchered animal, dangling on his own glistening cords. His head lolls. The air swelters. Everything reeks of iron and bile.\n\nHuge veins that are corroded pipes that are filth-streaked glass tubes run along every possible surface, all coming to meet at some pulsating nexus above Randall's head, just beyond his range of vision. When he squints, he can see something moving beneath the skin of the vein-pipes, shapeless and terrible: fear, in its most undiluted form.\n\nSomething touches the crown of his skull and travels downward -- a pair of serpents that are hypodermic needles that are long, wormy tendrils. When they reach the edge of his brow, they turn and, rearing back, plunge into his eyes. Randall shivers and seizes like a man electrocuted, mouth gaping without sound. The things in his head caress his optical nerve and impossible colors flash across his non-vision. He feels as though magma is bubbling behind his temples, threatening to burst through.
