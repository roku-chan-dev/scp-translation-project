After the limited success of the original LANCER programs nearly eighty years ago and the recent establishments on other exoplanets like Tigaxia V, Solar Command Earth has decided to continue the trend of furthering humanity's reach into stable forms of living outside of our system.\n\nFrontios Program is headed by Peter Guryevich -- the current acting science director of Site-989 -- and assisted by the brilliant minds who worked on other notable Solar Command programs such as the IC943 De-Orbit. Guryevich states his intention for the Frontios Program is to create and cultivate a less environmentally harsh standard of living in order to improve the longevity of home planets for all creeds of life. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:95%; box-shadow:none; border: none;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7984/frontios.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%; background-color: #ADADAD; color: #000000;\"]]\nKG984 FRONTIOS\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-orange-light border-black text-black\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]] Excerpt from Guryevich's speech to SCP Council, FEB. '93[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n[...] as I'm sure you're completely aware of. The reason we -- me and my staff -- have chosen this exoplanet is simply because of its location and similar climate to our current home planet, despite its appearance. We are a particularly hardy species, and the current deviations of course will provide no problems in conjunction with the visuographic technologies to remedy that.\n\nOur discovery of Frontios was rather... accidental, but beneficial for our situation. It had originally been obscured to visual instruments by the Commorant. After the launch of the probes sent to ascertain the viability of life on our original target, PL0943 Minyos, we were rather surprised to learn of the almost sudden appearance of KG984 in previously-empty space.\n\nHowever, our plans adapted to the new information once we learned as well that Frontios was in a much better position to the system's sun in comparison to Minyos. As it is further away, the temperatures are in ranges that would be comparable to us here. In opposition was Minyos, which is still within our baselines but would require [...]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-grey-dark border-white text-white\" style=\"font-family: 'Terminus'; font-size: 1.3em;]]\n[[=]]\nREADOUT\\scientific research vessel 'Cogitari'\n[[/=]]\nlaunch date: JULY 05 / 2093\n\ncrew: Five\n\ncourse: KG-984 (\"FRONTIOS\")\n\n[[>]]\nlaunch: [[span class=\"blink\"]]##43ff00|CONFIRMED##[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-grey-light border-black text-black\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 1.75em; font-family: 'Terminus';\"]]SOLAR COMMAND PATROL[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n**RECOVERED FOOTAGE**\n[[/=]]\n//The Cogitari approaches the surface of Frontios.
