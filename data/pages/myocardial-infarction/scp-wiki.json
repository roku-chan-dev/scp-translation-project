But today was different. The Supervisors had eased up on him and Faeowynn a little bit. It was summer, so there were plenty of volunteers at the Center to take care of the critters. There weren't any events planned for the week. The sun was even smiling down on him when he went out to the back porch with his coffee that morning.\n\nSo he kissed Alice goodbye, sent Faeowynn a text to let her know he wouldn't be in today, strapped on his boots, filled his canteen with water, and got into his rinky-dink truck to drive down to Sandy. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n**Badum.**\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nAlice sent him a text telling him she was scheduling a doctor's appointment for herself.\n\nIt had been a long time since he had gone to the doctor. The Center's partnership with the Supervisors afforded him and the other employees a wonderful health insurance plan that had really been beneficial for the others, but Tim himself was never much for doctors. Not since he was little.\n\nWhat was the point? \n\nHe knew he was a little overweight. That's why he went hiking and kept his body busy with the critters. He knew he had bad vision. That's why he wore glasses. He knew he had heart troubles. That's why he avoided stressing himself. Or at least that's what he told himself. The Supervisors' takeover had probably been the single most stressful event of his life. Well, aside from the whole thing with the polar bear. \n\nTruth be told, Tim did his best to avoid the Supervisors. He let Faeowynn deal with them; she seemed to be better at it than he ever could be. The only part he liked about the Supervisors was Captain Esau and her team. They were really hands-on with the critters; both in capture and care, something he appreciated the help with. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++++ Badum dum dum.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nAfter finally arriving at Tickle Creek Trail, Tim parked his truck at the little dirt lot next to the sign. He got out and first performed some stretches, trying to get himself into the hiking mood. He found himself a little more tired than usual. \"You've got this, old boy,\" he pepped himself up with some little slaps to his cheeks and finally entered the mouth of the trail. The midday sun was high in the sky, and the heat was palpable, but the trees fortunately provided shade on his walk through the path. \n\nAs he continued, he spotted a family having a picnic underneath a tree in the distance. \n\nHe used to take Robin and Anders on hikes when they were little boys. Faeowynn too, but only when she came to visit him from San Diego. Those instances were few and far between, however, and they typically only happened on certain birthdays or holidays. He had fallen in love with Alice on a hike, taught Anders how to defend himself from bullies on a hike, taught Robin how to do birdcalls on a hike, and Faeowynn had come out to him on a hike. \n\nBut he hadn't been on hikes with Robin, Anders, or Faeowynn in years. Alice only occasionally joined him but would much rather practice her fencing. He feared losing his family. Maybe that was why he'd convinced Robin and Anders to volunteer at the Center (well, the Shelter back then) when he started it up. They were all going their own way, and he didn't want them to stray too far. Which, for now, they hadn't.\n\nFaeowynn eluded him, however. She'd lived in New York for most of the Shelter's existence, but he stayed in touch with her via letters and emails. He tried to get her to come and visit for years, but she stayed on the east coast for what seemed forever. He wondered if she had forgiven him for how he left Audrey all those years ago. He was scared to bring up the topic even now. But one of these days he was going to do it, no matter how uncomfortable it would be.\n\nFeeling a tingling in his chest, Tim shrugged it off and continued down the path.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+++ Badum dum dum dum dum dum dum.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nThere was a rustling in the bushes. \n\nTim's head instinctively turned to face the noise and he crouched slightly. Ignoring the stinging pain in his chest, he crept closer to the foliage where he had heard the sound originate from. He leaned forward, brushing the vegetation aside only to spot a deer chewing on some grass nearby. He grinned and observed the deer as it continued to eat.\n\nMemories of the first time he had encountered Boring's unnatural nature came flooding into his mind. It had been many years ago, on his first 'date' with Alice in the woods that he had seen a stag not too different from this one with its rack burning aflame. It was a sight to behold. It was what part of what inspired him to form the Shelter. He wanted to witness all of nature's beauty, mundane and unusual alike. \n\nThe Shelter had started small. At first, they only rounded up missing pets, but slowly graduated into trapping and sheltering unusual critters plaguing Boring. He recalled when it was just him and Old Al in a pickup truck, some cages, and some traps. He remembered picking up Nandini to be a veterinarian at some point along the line. He thought back to when Anders and Robin first joined him, and then even Faeowynn. Tim couldn't help but feel proud of how far the Shelter, now Center, had come.\n\nHe smiled, then staggered slightly as the pain in his chest contracted, causing him to step on a stick behind him. The deer perked its ears and head up, then bounced away further into the woods. Maybe he would schedule a doctor's appointment when he got back from his hike. He knew he had Cardiac Myxoma ever since he was a young boy, and maybe it was acting up. He had promised his mother he wouldn't overexert himself when he was diagnosed, and he mostly stayed true to his promise. The Supervisors were pushing his limits, however.\n\nOr maybe it was heartburn from the coffee this morning. Yeah, that was probably it.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++ Badum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nTim stopped at a small clearing near the shallow waters of Tickle Creek.\n\nHe was feeling a little worn out. More than usual. Maybe it was the heat getting to him, or maybe it was his age. He was getting up there, after all. Or maybe he was just winded because it had been about a year since his last hike. Tim took a deep breath and closed his eyes, walking towards the water. He stared at his reflection.\n\nA chubby man with windsor glasses and a scraggly salt-and-pepper beard stared back at him. When had he let himself get this old? Tim had never planned for old age. He didn’t have a retirement plan. Well that was only half true: he had a financial plan in the form of a 401k, thanks to the Supervisors. But he didn’t have a plan for the free time that came with retirement. Alice had been pestering him about it, but he always brushed her off. The Supervisors needed him, he thought.\n\nWould they even let him retire? They didn't seem like the kind to allow people to do that. Despite how much of a net positive they had been for the Center, they didn't seem too friendly. Captain Esau had insinuated a few times that she hoped to die in the field rather than retire with the Supervisors in charge of her. He always wondered why that was. Did she think they would keep her from her family?\n\nMaybe retiring would be the right move. Faeowynn had a good grasp on the Center's operations, and the employees and volunteers did a good enough job without him. If he retired, he would be able to spend more time with his family. He wanted to be a grandparent. Maybe he could convince Faeowynn and Alex into adopting so he could babysit for them and go on hikes with their child. Or maybe Robin or Anders would meet the right girl and settle down.\n\nHis future was brimming with opportunities!\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ Badum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nHe reached for his phone, starting to type up an email to Mr. Tarpan, his prime contact with the Supervisors.\n\nAs he typed, a smile slowly spread on his face.\n\nSoon he would be able to enjoy all the hikes he could want.\n\nSoon he would be able to visit the Center as a guest.\n\nSoon he would be able to read all the books Alice had recommended to him.\n\nBut something wasn't right.\n\nHe was sweating bullets.\n\nEverything was spinning around him.\n\nThere was a pain in his chest.\n\nThe phone fell atop a rock on the shore, its screen cracking.\n\nHe stumbled forward.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe clutched his chest.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe gasped in pain.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe fell face-first into the shallow water.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe writhed.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe twitched.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe struggled to move.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nHe struggled to breathe.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"I've never been much of a storyteller. Don't hear it from me... \" hide=\"Take it away, my darling.\"]]\nDad died on the 12th of July, 2024. It was a nice, warm day, and he had finally taken some time to himself to go on a hike down in Sandy. He found a trail by Tickle Creek, and took it. It's a flat path. Nothing strenuous in the slightest. But it doesn't matter. Whatever it was, it had already begun its cycle. He suffered a heart attack, and fell face first into the shallow water. Seems he never took time out of his schedule to get that surgery. He lived to be 68. Not a short life, but not a long one. He is survived by his wife, Alice, his sons, Anders and Robin, and his one remaining daughter, Faeowynn. I have no solid conclusion here. I have no good or bad ending. I have no crescendo, I have no epilogue. [[[tim-wilson|I have no closure.]]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n _\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
