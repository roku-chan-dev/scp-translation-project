It is believed Her influence is perhaps the strongest of all the Absolutes, for the simple fact that Securement is the Foundation's most prized, most enjoyed, value.\n\nSecurity is a critically essential factor in and amongst Foundation operations. If it was not a factor we were privileged with, our organization would likely have suffocated over a century ago.\n\nFor these reasons, plentiful amounts of valuable attention should be directed to //Scathia's// requests -- performances of Ritual-7006 currently prioritize rites surrounding Securement.\n\n= @@ @@\n[[div style=\"margin: auto; max-width: 400px;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7006/scathia.jpg style=\"border-radius: 1rem;\"]]\n\n------\n\n= //An Index of the Absolutes - R.M.

Following 7006-Warden's eventual movement towards settings of a more neutral, established nature (i.e. the \"//Pitted City//\", a proxy for Nx-18, Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin) Foundation staff retention has increased, as has the general morale of personnel.\n\nRitual-7006 failures predicated on poor performances of the Securement module in 2018 and 2020 possess a causal link to mass exoduses of Foundation personnel, with reasons for resigning including alleged \"incompetence among higher levels of personnel\", \"unacceptable losses\" and in one case, \"adherence to asinine rituals and regulations\". 2020's exodus was likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which does not have any known link to Ritual-7006.\n[[/div]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote lightweight;\" style=\"border: none;\"]]\n= [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7006#adventures |Return to menu]]]\n[[/div]] \n\n= @@ @@",
