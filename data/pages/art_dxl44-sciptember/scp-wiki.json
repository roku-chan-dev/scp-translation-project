[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sciptember-2022 SCiPTEMBER 2022] is a thing, and I'm throwing my hat into the ring. I'll be putting all of the stuff I draw for it here. Will that be all of the prompts? Probably not, but I'll do what I can. I'll be drawing the articles I read, and giving some thoughts on them alongside the art as well.\n-----\n\n\n+ Day 1: Factory\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/IOzGAjk.png width=\"400px\"]]\n= **__[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4876 SCP-4876: Dr. Wondertainment's Pixel Buddies!] by Baronjoe__**\n**Thoughts:** This article was pretty neat, loved the designs for the Pixel Buddies. I didn't really want to do a pixel art approach because I've literally never drawn pixel art before, so I tried my hand at some vector stuff in Inkscape. I think it turned out pretty neat, like a good translation of the designs.",
