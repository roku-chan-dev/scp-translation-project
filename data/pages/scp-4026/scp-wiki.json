In order to activate an SCP-4026 event, a single subject must approach an affected area with suicidal intent. Upon coming within 5 meters of the cliff's edge, SCP-4026-1 will manifest and engage the subject.\n\nSCP-4026-1 resembles a humanoid of indeterminate age and sex, which possesses minor cognitohazardous properties. Attempts to capture or describe any aspect of SCP-4026-1 (aside from its voice) have thus far resulted in failure. Survivors of SCP-4026 events claim to have no memory of interacting with SCP-4026-1, but are able to recall being dissuaded from ending their lives via unexplained means, typically citing an overabundance of negative emotion and disgust at their actions. SCP-4026-1 will demanifest when its target is no longer within 5 meters of it.\n\n93% of recorded SCP-4026 events result in the activating subject's survival.\n\n**Addendum 4026.01:** On 07/07/2019, one Elliot Schneider (Male, Age 32) approached a hidden SCP-4026 observation area and triggered the anomaly. Notably, this was the first instance in which an SCP-4026 event lasted longer than five minutes. Below is a transcribed log of Schneider's interaction with SCP-4026-1.\n\n> **<BEGIN LOG>**\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Lovely view, isn't it?\n> \n> **Schneider:** Bloody hell, where did you come from?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** I'm always round these parts. It's good fun, it is.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Yeah right.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** You thinking of jumping? That's why most people come here, you know.\n> \n> **Schneider:** So what, are you out here playing guardian angel? I appreciate the gesture but really, I uh, I'd rather not get into it. Just please leave.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Oh no, I'd rather stay. Have a chit-chat. What do you say?\n> \n> **Schneider:** No. Why do you care so much?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Don't worry about it. You married?\n> \n> **Schneider:** No, not since last February.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Any kids? Did she take them?\n> \n> **Schneider:** Yeah, full custody. Took the dog, too.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Wow. Even the dog. Sounds like she really did a number on you.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Jesus mate. Are you trying to get me to fucking jump?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Why, yes. It's why I'm here.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Holy shit.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** It's quite a lovely show, and it's a shame no one else is around to see it.\n> \n> **Schneider:** ... this is how you get your kicks, you sick fuck?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Are you planning on putting on a show or not?\n> \n> //[There is a silence for thirty seconds. Schneider's breathing becomes labored before vocalizing in frustration.]//\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Well?\n> \n> **Schneider:** I made up my mind.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Oh? Will you do it?\n> \n> **Schneider:** Only if you answer a question for me first.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** I typically would refuse, but... you look promising. Go for it.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Why do you like watching people jump off?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** No reason. It beats doing nothing.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Really? You just like watching people jump off these cliffs? Simple as that?\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Were you expecting some great, complicated answer? It really doesn't get any more complicated than that. Now go on then, I've waited long enough.\n> \n> **Schneider:** Fuck you.\n> \n> **SCP-4026-1:** Yes, yes fuck me and all that now g-\n> \n> //[There are sounds of a scuffle between the two for fifteen seconds until only Schneider's labored breathing is audible. SCP-4026-1 screams.]//\n> \n> //[There is a distant thud followed by silence, interrupted only by Schneider's breathing.]//\n> \n> **Schneider:** ... shit... shit! The police are going to fuckin' kill me!\n> \n> **<END LOG>**\n\nFoundation agents moved in to seize Schneider and search for SCP-4026-1. Despite the sound of an object impacting against the beach under the cliffside and Schneider's insinuations, no remains were found. No further SCP-4026 events have occurred since and is considered Neutralized.\n\nFollowing these events, Schneider was assigned a psychiatrist and therapist in London after standard relocation amnestic treatment.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4025]]] | SCP-4026 | [[[SCP-4027]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
