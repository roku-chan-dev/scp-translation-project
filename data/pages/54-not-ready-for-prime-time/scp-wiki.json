When she spoke, it was hoarse. Barely more than a whisper. \"Turns out it really isn't always about me. Or us. Or… the thing. Sometimes.\"\n\nHarry held her hand. Sokolsky gripped her shoulder. She didn't resist.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Wettle. \"What are we doing?\"\n\nMcInnis tapped the recorder. \"This is Dr. Ngo. We're recording a debriefing.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Wettle nodded. \"Why?\"\n\nIbanez sighed. \"Because odds are good we don't fix what's wrong with the superstructure before September, and we end up in a second deadline in a row. So we're getting our stories straight, on the record, and then Lillian can remember them. For later.\"\n\n\"I was wondering about that.\" Udo was holding Ibanez's hand. The MTF chief was treating it casually, like it was nothing. \"If Lillian's just going to memorize this anyway—\"\n\n\"Because,\" Lillian answered before the question was fully posed, \"either we'd all be pretending to talk to someone who isn't here //without// a prop to make it less nonsensical, or we'd be talking to //me,// or I guess we'd just be talking to //each other.//\"\n\n\"Would that be so bad?\" Harry asked.\n\nLillian shrugged. \"I like the structure. I… I like the structure. We're sticking with it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"And maybe we do fix the Breach in September, and nothing else happens between now and then, and we can just hand Nhung the tape and go back to our rooms and cry.\"\n\nHe squeezed her hand. \"Okay.\"\n\n[[div class=\"Ngo\"]]\n//<Recording begins.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** So. Adventures in the headacheverse.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I've never seen a dimension-hopping show where all the dimensions suck before. It's been very enlightening.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Where should we begin?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I'll take point. Feel free to interject with your meaningless humanistic ramblings as the mood strikes you, everyone else.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Count on it.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** So. All of the Site was, and most of the Site still is, wall-to-wall memetic nonsense. If there's an exposed panel, no matter where it is, it's got a fancy mind-virus painted on it.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** All the world a VW Microbus.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** If it hadn't been for the decon tunnel attached to my office, we'd have been properly fucked. It's literally impossible to have a creative thought in there.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** We call it the Wettle Tube.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Nobody calls it that.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I do.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** My point exactly.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** And mine.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Gentlemen, we only have the one tape.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Those paintings on the walls have a definite effect on people. A very specific definite effect, with wildly variable results. Would you call them de-inhibitors, Lillian?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I'd call them cognition divergence vectors. I've already got the paper half-written in my mind.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Explain it to us //froufrou// hard and social scientists.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm not //froufrou,// you're //froufrou.//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** The effect of these weird, artistic fractal-things, these lovely wall-mounted cognitohazards, is to completely transform the way people express themselves. They become incapable of directing their actions towards a specific, predetermined goal. Every problem becomes the branching-off point for a constellation of possible actions, none more attractive than any other. They became curious as cats, and creative as… I don't know.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Pr—\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Prodigies. Yeah. They became prodigies. Completely free of any inhibitions to their creative impulses. Like a hippie arts commune on every psychedelic substance known to humankind.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Have you ever had a day when you wanted to punch literally every person you met? Imagine a whole year of that.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I hope we're not forced to endure this for the entire year.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Depends on a lot of things.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** But surely the Foundation will respond soon? If an entire Site went offline…\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** It's a lot more complicated than that, Harry.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** The landscape outside the Site, topside, is one big cognitohazard. Something in the arrangement of the land, the trees, the structures. You saw.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I don't know what I saw.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Exactly. You couldn't even focus on it. It's all a garbled mess. Antimemetic. I was able to get a few glimpses of the last few uploads to SCiPnet that happened before we went under, and you know what the Foundation did? Right before forgetting we even existed?\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** They classified us as an SCP, I'll bet.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** And you'd get to keep your money. Lightning round: guess which number we got.\n\n//<Dr. Okorie stifles a laugh.>//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Yep.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** 5243?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** 5243. The final log entries suggest they were having trouble getting the Dep of Con officers to remember there was even a file. But before that, you can see the effects the topside contamination was having on everybody. Supplies stopped coming in. So did comms. We were noetically isolated from the rest of humanity. I'm assuming that was Bernie…\n\n<Silence on recording.>\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Fuck. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** It's okay.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Shut up. I'm assuming that was something Bernie did before he came down here for good, putting a cap on top of the bottle. Sealing it off. Setting up his little culture-culture.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** The Lake Huron Petri Dish.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** And it worked. It really, really worked. In ways that shouldn't even have been possible.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Such as?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** It was bad enough to work on electronic eyes. Foundation Mission Control tasked a satellite to fly over 43, and you know what happened? The satellite's OS became an AI and de-orbited itself, just to see what would happen.\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** It sent a single message of explanation before it burned up in atmo: \"TO FEEL THE FIRE.\"\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Jesus Christ.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Three MTF teams came in by helicopter, and immediately started playing tag in the forest.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I suspect the First Nations came into the Site at this point, to avoid them.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Another squad came in on foot, according to the security feeds that haven't been replaced with amateur art films. Anybody standing topside stood a good chance of hearing that orgy even a click underground, if they put their ear to the elevator.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** And that's not even starting on what they did with the subjects in containment.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Sorry, are we just ignoring the thing that happened outside? Are we not going to talk about that?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Let Lillian have a few—\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I don't need protecting, Harry. And I don't need to get a run up at it. I have no idea what happened out there. I'll be running it over and over in my mind for a long time, so for now, let's focus on the things we do understand.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Okay. Sorry.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** It's fine. It's fine.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** So, the skips. A lot of the dangerous ones, the ones we can never seem to dismantle or destroy… they dismantled, or destroyed, and then repurposed for their little projects. Maybe there really was something to that non-linear thinking. Some of what they did, I think we might be able to reproduce. I mean, back home. The dismantling, not the art.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Please, not the art.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I'm afraid the Decommissioning Department would never allow it anyway.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Sure. So anyway, far as I've been able to get out of the camera logs, the skips that had minds better than a cat's took one look at the fractals and became just as wonky as the general staff. I'm really looking forward to the death of this anomaly, but if it's given me one thing in my life, it's the image of a carnivorous tree spirit painting a pastoral landscape on its cell wall. With the door wide open.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** //<loudly>// You're absolutely sure I can't take another painkiller yet.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm surprised it affected him so badly. I haven't noticed any side-effects.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** He uses more of his brain than you do. And it wasn't the same thing anyway.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** You should have left me under.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** This is where we account for ourselves, Noè. Super looking forward to hearing how you do that.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** For the record, Chief Nascimbeni voluntarily placed himself into a memetic coma. Dr. Wettle, on the other hand, immediately looked at one of the murals when we arrived.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** We've had training for this, Willie.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Whatever. I got a few months off, and a lot of crazy dreams. Filled a whole sketchbook since I woke up, great stuff. Can we attach some of it to the report?\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** No.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Absolutely not.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Share it with your wife.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** I didn't have any dreams.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** You seem a lot less on-edge than before.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** He ought to. He didn't see half a spider come out of anybody.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** We should speak more about the memetic effects on the staff. It might be useful for handling the //giftschreiber,// going forward.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Sure. They weren't very dangerous, mostly.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Tell that to Melissa and Phil. If they ever…\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Hey.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** It's…\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Yeah, I know. It's fine.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Melissa could easily have done that to herself. She wouldn't be the only one engaging in self-harm for the artistic merit. A few folks got really radical ideas about gravity; we've got elevator shafts, geothermal shafts, just a lot of shafts in general perfectly suited to testing that shit out. Wheeeee!\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Splat.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** That's callous.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Who cares? By the time anyone hears this, they'll all be alive again.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** It was a lot like a carnival crowd hit with a truckload of aerosolized PCP. You wouldn't want to walk the halls without an escort.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** An escort with a fuckoff huge blaster gun.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** So the question is, what do we do now? Lillian and Dr. Sokolsky got PROJECT SCRAMBLE working—\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Thanks for getting that plug in there.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** So do we go topside? Get out of the exclusion zone, and warn the Foundation?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Given the whole red sky thing, I figure they probably know.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** We need to be very careful with our next steps. We may not possess any knowledge germane to the situation they're facing out there.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** It never occurred to me that there would be a worldwide issue that wasn't related to the Breach. Bernie… I don't know if this was what he meant, but it sounds like he was saying that the //giftschreiber// were trying to do their thing, and something worse beat them down. I…\n\n//<Dr. Lillihammer clears her throat.>//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I think I'll need a recharge before I tackle something worse than this.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** At the moment, it's possible we don't know anything the wider Foundation hasn't already figured out. They may be far ahead of us. And there is also the question of whether or not it matters.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** What do you mean?\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Whatever they're facing is likely unrelated to the question of the deadlines. It might be more prudent, if morally distasteful, for us to ride out the storm in our ready-made bunker.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Not so ready-made.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** What do //you// mean?\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** The hydroponics are trashed. A lot of our stores went into that weird army of tin can robots somebody—\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Bremmel.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Probably Bremmel—\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Definitely Bremmel.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** DEFINITELY BREMMEL, then, welded together. I don't think we have the supplies to keep all these people alive without getting in touch with the rest of the company.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Well, we're going to have a hell of a hard time fixing the topside problem if we need to get back out into the world.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Assuming there's still a world to get back into.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** They would've tried using SCRAMBLE to get into the compound, and it obviously didn't work. If we get out, don't tell them anything useful, don't get any supplies, and then afterwards can't get back in…\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** At least you'd be out.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** \"…and then couldn't get back in.\"\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** So? Why would you want to get back in?\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** TO CONTAIN 5243 AND STOP THE FUCKING WORLD FROM ENDING, YOU GODDAMN FUCKING —\n\n//<Recording ends.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"Ngo\"]]\n//<Recording resumes.>//\n\n**Dr. Blank:** I'm fine.

Sorry, the names are confusing.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** You were being unprofessional anyway.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** We're in an unprofessional setting. It looks to me like Del Olmo didn't offer the other people direction, precisely, but he was definitely urging them on, and even in the images that weren't made from memories he stole and splatted on the walls, the ones that were just pure expression, it looked like he was… conducting? Yeah. Like a conductor.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** More like a superconductor.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Sure. It was like they were trying to express something that was //his.// Like they could… see what he wanted, somehow, in their minds. He had a vision, but he was interested in multiple perspectives on it.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** But it never worked.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Apparently not. From the uncorrupted cam footage I've managed to scrounge, looks like half the time they ended up just grabbing their heads and passing out. Eventually he changed tack, and started just watching to see what they'd do on their own.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** I think he wanted to bring out the creativity in everyone. Whatever was inside of him, it was driving him to… express. Express himself. Help everyone else express themselves. Whatever that meant. It means music, to some of them.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** Sculpture.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Sex.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** But no-one's trying to express themselves in such a way as to inhibit the expression of others. There's something to that, I think.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** And it's a good thing, too, because if they'd been able to put their heads together, who knows what they could've built.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** I'm picturing a nuclear-grade paintball gun, myself.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** I wonder if there was any function to the work he was preparing in the geothermal shaft, or whether that was simply the last gasp of his own creativity.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** A cry for help, I thought.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Or a legacy.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Looks more like the gullet of a Picasso monster.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I can't believe you looked at it.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** I thought maybe it would help with the FUCKING HEADACHE.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Bernie must have done a lot of gore-scraping before he laid down the basecoat.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Not this again.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** His intentions seemed less malefic than the norm, did they not? Very different from the way the other aspects have behaved.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I think he ran out of hope.

They'd found him knee deep in a heap of computer parts dumped down the shaft of the DUAL Core, attempting to strangle Du himself. The latter had been badly injured, a serious blow to the side of his head, and it was obvious the two had been struggling over the choicer parts in the pile.\n\nLater analysis would show that not all of the mechanical constructions seen throughout the Site had actually been Bremmel's. As Lillian put it, dismay and amusement fighting for control in her tone, \"I think they were playing Extreme BattleBots?\"\n\n\"Buck up,\" Udo encouraged. Bremmel was lying on a cot in the middle of his lab, while Udo laboured over his workstation. \"The headaches will pass.\"\n\n\"Not for Xinyi,\" the old man sighed. \"That weak cranium of his.

Almost a schematic, but not quite.\n\nBremmel threw his arm across his eyes; he'd been in full-on drama queen mode since they woke him. \"Months,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Months what?\" Udo found the volume Bremmel had indicated; she found it on the third unit, fifth shelf. She didn't say anything about this, because she knew he'd simply blame it on his assistants. \"Months to finish this?\"\n\n\"At best.

Save for Del Olmo's frenzied passage through the foyer, the First Nations experience of the Site's collective insanity had been relatively benign. McInnis chalked that up to the fact that they hadn't come in until after the memeticist-in-chief had gone into hiding. His deputy quite agreed.\n\n\"We stayed topside as long as we could.\" The ASC was now walking with a cane; for reasons nobody could yet explain, his left leg had been paralyzed during Del Olmo's flight. His brain simply would not acknowledge the limb's existence, though it carried weight perfectly well. \"But people kept wandering into the res.\"\n\n\"People from the Site?\" They were walking the path to Intake Point-94, and the observation bubble. The ASC was hoping that enough activity would wake his errant limb, so they'd left the transportation at its dock.\n\n\"Some,\" the ASC nodded. \"They were wild. Crazed. Easy to avoid, easy to knock down. I'm afraid we had to kill some of them, though we tried not to.\"\n\n\"Why were you topside in the first place? Meaning you, yourself, Nim.\"\n\nHis deputy sighed. \"I was renewing our contract, as we always do annually, when Dr. Del Olmo returned to the Site. I lost communications almost immediately, and when we approached…\"\n\nHe reached up with his free hand, and clutched at his forehead. McInnis quite understood, and finished for him. \"You found that AAF-A was no longer a landscape you could comprehend, and Camp Ipperwash was much the same.\"\n\nThe big man nodded. \"Then there was the MTF squad the Foundation sent to make contact, or at least, the one we encountered. They were carving runes into the trees. One of them tried to eat his gun, literally, and it ended up happening metaphorically instead. By that time we knew things were seriously wrong, and not just at Site-43.\" His expression was grim. \"Later, it was worse. Much worse.

Something was moving at the bottom of the lake.\n\n\"We closed our eyes.\" The ASC opened them, and smiled. \"And the creatures brought us home.\"\n\nThe Mishepeshu had already returned to the tunnels around the Site, and the lakebed. Whatever had been roosting in the ruins of the elevator had also gone. The mischievous sprites, the shape-changers of various kinds, all had disappeared as soon as the immediate threat had passed. The //status quo// was gradually returning.\n\nBut the Chippewas of Kettle and Stony Point Reserve #44 had not yet vacated the space that had once sat beneath Stony Point Reserve #43, the home that had been stolen from them and never returned. From what the ASC had told McInnis so far, it was clear that he did not intend them to.\n\nIt was an easy enough request to fulfill. In the deadline.\n\nIn baseline, as always, things would be much more complicated.\n\nMcInnis thought of Vivian Scout, and wondered, not for the first time, whether that really ought to be the case.\n\n\"What about OSAT?\" he asked. \"Did you have any trouble with them?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" The ASC nodded. \"The Mounties attacked us in force as we were entering the barracks building, and filing into the elevator.

He was the shortest of Site-43's security guards, and she was the tallest; the fact that they were both dead back in baseline had lopped the scale at both ends. Holt's simple white wedding dress had been one of the first complex tests of the fashion fabbers, after Nascimbeni had brought them back online to produce the 'metric fuck-ton' of rags Lillian had requested for the cleanup process. She looked, if not beautiful, then quite handsome. Bosch looked like one of those little muscle men who went clubbing to assert their masculinity. It was an odd fit, but it did seem to be one.\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nSite-43's chapel doubles as an amateur theatre, because other than weddings — which happen here more often than elsewhere at the Foundation, but they hardly ever happen elsewhere at the Foundation, so that's not saying much — there is little call for religious proceedings among those who know more about which gods do and don't exist than the entire collective priesthood of mankind. It is decorated with symbols of generic faith selected by Michael Nass of Theology and Teleology to avoid invoking the wrath or even the attention of any attested deities, suggestive of the transformative power of the profound without actually weighing in on the oldest debate in human history. In this respect it resembles the chapel on Medina Station in The Expanse, the most apt comparison I can make without recourse to Star Trek.

Christianne Monette, a Jesuit priest in Nass's employ, carried out the ceremony while the Director watched benevolently from the side. When it came time for the happy couple to kiss, Holt grabbed Bosch under his armpits and lifted him up, to uproarious laughter and applause.\n\nNascimbeni suddenly felt sick.\n\nNass must have noticed, because he said: \"What's wrong?\"\n\nA glance to each side showed that everyone around them was engrossed in the kiss, which showed no sign of ending — though Holt's arms were trembling, as her well-built husband had heft to make up for his height — or else chatting with their neighbours, so it felt safe to respond. \"Just makes me sad,\" he grunted.\n\nNass nodded. He understood. They'd looped him and Corbin in on the situation, as they always did; they were dealing with gods, and getting a consult in each deadline seemed a good way to canvas for variable opinions. \"Because it won't last.\"\n\nThis confirmed nobody was listening to their hushed mutterings, because saying that at a wedding was a good way to get stared down. \"Yeah.\"\n\nNass smiled, and looked back at the stage where the bride was finally putting the groom back on his feet. \n\nThe laughter and cheers showed no sign of subsiding. \n\nThey'd needed something like this, very clearly. \n\n\"You want my professional opinion?\" Nass asked.\n\nNascimbeni shrugged.\n\nThe theologian took this as approval to continue. \"I believe positive energy can transcend worlds.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/54-not-ready-for-prime-time/DL_54_07_Nass.jpg]]\n\nAs the noise finally died down, Nascimbeni took the opportunity to ask: \"What about negative energy?\"\n\nThe other man inclined his head, acknowledging a scored point.\n\nNascimbeni would have preferred an actual answer.\n\n[!-- [[=image Holt_Bosch_Marry.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 16 June\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe topside elevator was repaired slowly, because nobody wanted to deal with whatever was going on up there until they had their house in order.

Veiksaar was manning the equipment, while Carter was monitoring the connections and making sure the exceedingly complex device had been set up correctly. Neither of them had ever seen it before, so they had to make doubly sure.\n\nThis was going to be a very important phone call, assuming somebody picked up this time.\n\nThe Sampis stood at what passed for attention as McInnis sat down beside Carter. It was protocol that the technician make the first overture; there was very little in the way of cognitohazard that could compromise the Director, particularly given his cross-dimensional augmentation, but security procedures were not pick-and-choose.

Nascimbeni had rewired the lockdown controls for F-D, S&C and AO to a panel beside the vault door — which was now closed, but they could still hear muffled screaming from the other side — so if need be they could cut off the entire complex from the rest of the Site and operate all the security features they'd need come September the eighth without leaving their makeshift bunker. Veiksaar had forwarded the redline in McInnis' office to his tablet, and set up remote speakers in the bullpen, the A&R workroom and the airlock approach so that Ibanez and Harry and Nascimbeni could at least attempt telepresence, if they couldn't be physically present. They'd even rigged up a pressure-controlled breakaway floor joist to trip the agents in lieu of Wettle's sprawl. Finally, Ibanez had used the Bremmelgun to bore an access tunnel through the salt to Applied Occultism; they'd need to blow the floor open to get at it when the shift came, since any damage done now would be repaired on September the eighth, but otherwise it was probably workable to get Udo where she needed to be to do whatever it was that she did. It was a positive thing, at least, that all of the actions they needed to take in regards to AAF-D involved systems residing outside of it, which could be preemptively modified without fear of reversion.\n\nWhich was good, because it was beginning to look like they were going to spend the next few months trapped in a cavernous box together.\n\nThe final preventative measure had been to set up a series of wall-mounted monitors hooked in to security camera control, so they could judge the safety of their surroundings if the shit hit the fan.\n\nIt was hitting the fan now.\n\nVeiksaar's half-baked .aic was running the camera feeds, and traced the path of destruction beginning in the workroom with brutal efficiency.

At the moment Carter snapped, a lunch break in J&M turned into a blood riot when half a dozen technicians dropped their snacks and began cannibalizing each other instead.

Men and women in MTF gear were executing researchers, technicians and each other without rhyme or reason.

The wails of the injured and the roars of the dead-on-the-march overwhelmed the tinny speakers in the cell, and they all watched as nearly one thousand people reduced themselves to a few frantic hundred in less than an hour, then settled into a sustained orgy of battery, rapine and rape with no end in sight but the total depopulation of the entire facility.\n\nIt was a long time before any of them spoke.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"What… is it?\" Harry finally asked. \"What's happening?\"\n\n\"What needs to happen,\" said Lillian.

Extremely powerful memetics. So, forecasting...\" She looked up at the strange ceiling. \"I'd say one or more of them don't get killed, and in the new timeline, they're the top dogs. If it's Ambrogi and Markey, or Mukami, Gwilherm and Radcliffe, it's a typical apocalypse. If it's Wirth, I dunno. Probably he makes us all kill ourselves.

A part of her files it away in the part of her brain reserved for unresolved questions which might, some day, converge on a single answer.\n\nThe rest of her sits down heavily, on the floor, and begins to laugh and cry in equal measure.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/54-not-ready-for-prime-time/DL_54_11_Reynders_Realize.jpg]]\n\nBecause there are so many of her, she can feel the absence more keenly than anyone.

There'd been disassembly lines set up. More were littered in the corridors, left to bleed out, or kicked to a pulp, or squashed like grapes in an old style winery. Some of the staff were not yet dead, but they were dying, and there weren't enough of their peers in any condition to help to arrest their inevitable decline.\n\nThe Survivors — the term had never felt more relevant — filtered out of A&R and into the vast well of carnage without. Del exited first, and disposed of the corpses of Eileen and Carter via a garbage chute connected to the sump. They couldn't do anything about the blood, for the time being. The comms equipment was smashed, which was honestly something of a relief.\n\nIt would be the only solace they experienced for a long, long time.\n\nBut in helping who they could, and helping who they couldn't in a different way entirely, they were able for a time to forget the even bigger problem on the horizon.

During the former, they worked in pairs, or small groups. To nobody's surprise, Sokolsky turned up alive and well; he'd apparently locked himself in the decon tunnel as soon as they'd gone to make the call. They'd thought about making the call from the tunnel, as with Lillian's periodic conferences with Wheeler, but if the protection hadn't been enough, they would never have been able to reach their appointed stations on the eighth, so they hadn't.\n\nDuring the latter, they congregated in the Director's Complex.\n\nAfter what they found in Udo's dorm, they wouldn't have felt very comfortable in there.\n\nLillian was curled up in an expensive old Victorian armchair. It didn't recline, but it was obviously more expensive than the rest of the furniture, so she liked it almost as well. \"Harry,\" she murmured, as though talking in her sleep.\n\nAcross the room, sitting at McInnis' writing desk, Harry twisted to look at her. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You remember //Myst?//\"\n\nHarry laughed. \"I was just thinking that!\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wettle.\n\nHarry ignored him. \"The chicken or egg thing?\"\n\nThis time Lillian laughed. \"Yeah!\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wettle.\n\n\"//Myst// is an old PC adventure game from the early nineties,\" Harry explained. \"Lil and I played it at university. It's about an island full of books with little picture panels you can touch, and they teleport you to the worlds you can see there.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wettle.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Udo muttered from a divan in the corner, \"I'm not seeing the relevance yet either.\"\n\n\"There's debate in the world of the game—\" Lillian began.\n\n\"More in the sequel,\" Harry interrupted, \"and the tie-in literature—\"\n\n\"—about whether or not creating the books creates the worlds, or if the worlds are preexisting and the books just link to them.\"\n\nMcInnis, standing at the doorway to his more private quarters, nodded. \"I see the connection now.\"\n\nNascimbeni, staring white-faced at a set of blueprints he'd tacked to the wall as though pouring his fear into them might produce a solution, shook his head and didn't look at any of them. \"I do not.\"\n\n\"You're asking whether the deadlines are created when we foul up the Breach,\" said Udo, \"or they're fully-fledged parallel universes or timelines or whatever.\"\n\nDel, cleaning her gun, looked either exhausted or exasperated. Perhaps both, actually. \"Why? What prompted that?\"\n\nLillian gestured, like a monarch granting permission to speak. \"Harry?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"for me it's about the content.\"\n\n\"The content of what?\" Del asked, not sounding like she particularly cared. They all liked to keep the conversation going anyway, no matter what it was about. If they chattered enough, they could almost imagine there were still plenty of people alive at Site-43.\n\n\"The world. In the first three deadlines, everything seemed to revolve around us. And the Victims. Our story was the world's story. It was easy to think that everything existed solely because of what we did.\"\n\n\"Double easy for me,\" Lillian yawned, \"since that's my default position.\"\n\nHarry pointed at her. \"But there's something happening here that isn't connected to what we did.\"\n\n\"Weirder than that. Our story made way for theirs. Our people focusing on our issue left everyone else vulnerable to an outside context problem.\"\n\nA light had dawned in Udo's eyes, quite literally. \"Doesn't that make this deadline make //more// sense, though? Just because 5243 created the Victims, doesn't mean they're the most dangerous things in existence. Even with the threat boost of whatever got ripped apart by the Breach, they should never have been the main event. The whole reason the Foundation has a Tactical Theology department is that universal threats are dime a dozen. This just feels like reality finally ensuing, after three false starts.\"\n\nLillian curled up tighter, in the fetal position she assumed on the edge of sleep. She'd acquired that quirk at university, where very few of the beds were long enough to properly accommodate her length. \"But no, that wasn't really what made me think of the //Myst// thing. I was more wondering if it even makes sense that our other selves are like… //vessels// we can inhabit, with personal histories and unique situations, and then we hijack them, like they were waiting to be hijacked, and then… nothing. All that energy comes out of the universe, and then goes right back in, or is lost in the transfer. You know how much energy it takes to create a whole universe? And what kind? I don't, but I know AAF-D wasn't carrying enough gunk to do it.\"\n\n\"I know the unit, and the value,\" said Udo, \"but neither would mean anything to you. You're right. It's a lot.\"\n\n\"In //Myst,//\" Harry mused, \"you can edit the book and edit the world. It doesn't prove anything in that setting, but it could in ours. That might be how we test this.\"\n\nNascimbeni glanced at him, briefly, then returned to his hopeless task. \"Meaning?\"\n\nUdo answered for him. \"Meaning we can find out if the deadlines predate our reality if we can edit them, by editing the Breach.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wettle.\n\n\"If I ever start a garage band,\" said Del, \"it's going to be called 'What' Said Wettle.\"\n\nHarry laughed. \"I was just thinking that!\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nDelfina Ibanez had received a Foundation doctoral degree in Civil and Esoteric Engineering one year after the events of Zevala. Whilst entombed in the hidden facility on the village's outskirts — no trace of which could subsequently be found — she'd entertained the whimsical idea of repairing the damage, all of it, from one end of the bay to the other, and restoring the survivors to their shacks. That had been before she'd emerged to find herself the only survivor, and embarked on a less constructive path.\n\nHer examiners had been flabbergasted. For someone so young, and from such a relative backwater, she was far better educated than she ought to have been. And she'd educated //herself.// Volume on volume in the facility's library had taught her first the basics, then the deeper secrets of construction, maintenance and repair. She knew about stresses — more than most. She knew about tension, and torque, and resonance. By the time she emerged in a suit of futuristic armour and laid waste to the Insurgents who had laid waste to her home, she'd even begun regulating her emotions on those same principles. She had become a machine for carrying out a task.\n\nShe now turned that machine to the task at hand.\n\nThe only doctor who had survived the purge was Billie Forsythe, who was able to provide relief to the wounded only after they subjected her to a painful course of amnestics that wiped the past few months from her memory. It was a risk, and odds were she'd endured permanent brain damage from it, but did that really matter? None of these people would even exist soon. They only needed that existence to be a little more comfortable while Nascimbeni and Ibanez worked to erase their reality.\n\nThere wasn't much they could get done with just the two of them, plus the others to help with heavy lifting. The others weren't really very good at heavy lifting, except for Wettle, who was a problematic helper because he always dropped anything over a certain weight on his feet. The steel toes in his boots were getting dangerously close to his actual toes from the repeated impacts. Even McInnis pitched in, and the two engineers did their best to rearrange the components and circuitry and most important of all, the pipes, with a little help from Udo's micamancy when they needed more force than their bodies could provide.\n\nA final run through the whole system with the red dust suggested that everything was as close to settled as it could be by early September, so McInnis made the decision they'd all been waiting for.\n\nThey would make no attempt to contact the Foundation again.\n\nIf this world persisted past the eighth of September, it would be a world with no Site-43. Its few remaining residents would live out what remained of their lives in a black, twice-compromised pit underground.\n\nThat possibility had been clearly outlined in all the recruitment materials. It was just that nobody had ever believed it would happen to them.\n\nAnd certainly not here.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 8 September\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was good not to have to test their backup systems. None of them had articulated it out loud at the time, since there hadn't seemed a point, but each had held their own suspicions that it wouldn't have been enough. The ghosts were on autopilot, to be sure, but they were still to a certain extent responding to external stimuli.\n\nIt felt particularly ghoulish going through the motions this year, however.\n\nAs McInnis answered the redline, he mused that Ambrogi's shout of \"Hyperbolic!\" in response to the Breach was itself a case of hyperbole, compared to the disasters which had preceded it.\n\nAs Harry sent Wirth to his doom, his guilt over all the previous repetitions seemed quaint in light of the recent body count.\n\nAs Ibanez gave her orders, the sense of futility was stronger than ever.\n\nAs Wettle hit the floor, and the footfalls struck him, the enormity of it all came in a solid third place for the most unwelcome impact.\n\nAs Nascimbeni resealed five fates in a few hectic minutes, he was keenly aware that the dead already far outnumbered the living.\n\nAs Lillian sealed the bulkheads and watched her mentor tumble into the failing refinery, for the very first time she realized he was already dead to her before the carpet of roiling fluid consumed him.\n\nAs Udo reached the hall, she didn't know whether seeing Dougall Deering alive or dead would have comforted her more.\n\nAs they all filed into the dorm room, settling into their respective places, none of them dared to ask the question on all of their minds.\n\nHad it been enough?\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/53-those-who-cant | previous-title=Those Who Can't\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/55-wonders-of-my-hand | next-title=Wonders of My Hand\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadlined-hub  | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Deadlined\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\nIllustrations in this series use reference material created with DAZ studio.
