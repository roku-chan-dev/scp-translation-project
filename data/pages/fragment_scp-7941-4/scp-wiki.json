  "content": "+++++ The sleeping pilot of the solar pyre\n+++++ was once again immured within his mind.\n+++++ An age of dusty silence had begun\n+++++ above the slaughterhouse he left behind.\n+++++ The Helmsman wished to answer for his crimes.\n+++++ No honest judge would grant him clemency.\n+++++ But court was held within his looking-glass,\n+++++ for judge and jury all were absentee.\n+++++ The cruelest judge within donned cap of black,\n+++++ and bit his upper lip to temper hate.\n+++++ But since the hangmen all had gone extinct,\n+++++ \"I sentence you, destroyer, to create.\"\n+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|There's one opponent left within your queue.##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|Now, subjugate your cruel oppressor -- you.##\n++ ##white|.##\n+++++ The Helmsman's mind was incompatible\n+++++ with any answer that would see him live.\n+++++ Where was the justice in this strange reward?\n+++++ But he had naught to lose and all to give.\n+++++ Alas, destruction was his only skill,\n+++++ and all the teachers, save himself, retired.\n+++++ But growing desperation was the thing\n+++++ that made primeval man discover fire.\n+++++ Time is the enemy of tyrant gods,\n+++++ for when it's unconstrained, all dreams come true.\n+++++ The boulder's on the hilltop, motionless,\n+++++ for Sisyphus had learned a thing or two.\n+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|Now, let the astral furnace twist and churn,##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|and ruin everything until you learn.##\n++ ##white|.##\n+++++ For eons did the flames eclipse themselves.\n+++++ Among the sea of boiling flesh below,\n+++++ the melting-pot, once comforting, grew stale.\n+++++ The globules scattered, bonds were shattered so.\n+++++ The graveyard undulated fiendishly,\n+++++ for something in their treasured light was wrong.\n+++++ The pseudopod and mitochondria\n+++++ began to doubt they'd ever get along.\n+++++ Saint Tanner's dying words had sown a seed.\n+++++ that grew into the gift of newfound skin.\n+++++ inverting thus the hateful fathers' curse: \n+++++ \"I took you from this world -- I'll bring you in!\"\n+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|The one to turn our crimson sun to gold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|The world you knew was given recompense,##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|succeeded by eternal innocence.##\n++ ##white|.##\n+++++ The Helmsman reigns as neither god nor king,\n+++++ but silent nurturer and sentinel.\n+++++ The ancient paths to global suicide\n+++++ all falter under watch of Kent-SauEl.\n+++++ The stars will blink to nothing one-by-one\n+++++ in worlds past our borders in the sky,\n+++++ but Father Helmsman's sun is elsewhere-born\n+++++ from realms where flames are never meant to die.\n+++++ And if you ask him if there's still regret\n+++++ within his fifty-billion-year-old mind,\n+++++ I'll bet he'd smile sadly, shrug, and say:\n+++++ \"This bus ain't leavin' nobody behind.\"\n+++++ ##c4a30b|O Helmsman, Helmsman, of the age untold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|The one who turned our crimson sun to gold!##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|Look down upon this gentler place to live in,##\n+++++ ##c4a30b|then try to say you'll never be forgiven.##\n\n[[>]]\n-- //The Ballad of the Helmsman//\n//Angus Nen, 14th scribe-laureate of the Sacred Curiosity Protectorate//\n//May 15th, 5.0004038902 Ã— 10^^10^^ C.E.//\n[[/>]]",
