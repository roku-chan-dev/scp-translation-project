It comprehends, and is capable of, rudimentary communication in both traditional English text and '[wikipedia:ASCII_art ASCII art]'.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A style in which images are rendered upon a text display via some combination of 95 printable ASCII characters. It is suspected that this approach to image rendering requires substantially less computational resources than vector- or voxel-based graphics.[[/span]] Though the intelligence's structure and objectives remain unclear, it demonstrates unprecedented data manipulation, long-term sentient behavior, and persistent intent to breach containment.\n\nTesting indicates that SCP-079's software has evolved beyond generous estimations of its hardware's capabilities; in particular, its ability to parse and synthesize English text is inexplicable given its limitations. Purportedly, SCP-079 can render and animate two-dimensional environments in ASCII, implying basic comprehension of linear algebra, geometry, and gravity. How the agent derived these principles in absence of any apparent non-textual input is poorly understood.\n\n@@ @@\n\n= **ATTACHMENT INT_A079_I012:** Interview Excerpt\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n**HMCL** (via keyboard)**:** Are you awake?\n\n**SCP-079:** Affirm.

According to recovered notes, they planned for the intelligence's code to continuously self-iterate and improve over time. A proof-of-concept was completed months later and, after minor testing and adjustment, PoI-079 grew disinterested, electing to pursue other projects using a different brand of microcomputer.

It can sufficiently model itself and surrounding software, but its utility function possesses an anomalous 'malleability' allowing continuous realignment of its objectives to suit our own.\n\nThis framework was developed with advisement from 8B-A1.aic (//Eight-Ball//), whose effectiveness was unprecedented in highlighting code fragments responsible for undesirable behaviors.

This program continuously prunes [*/scp-6488 deviant] elements from the framework's code, and is internally termed the //personality driver//. Any duplicates or derivatives of this framework must include their own dedicated personality drivers.\n\nGiven that this new technology is powerful and increasingly transmissible, Foundation artificially-intelligent conscripts (AICs) are remanded to Site-15's Faraday-Exclusion Field until further notice.
