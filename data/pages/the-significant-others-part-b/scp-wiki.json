He side-eyed the wall-mounted mirror to his right; Doug blinked its vertical eyes at him, slowly.\n\nHe looked back the way he'd come. The immaculate tiled-wall hallways stretched on seemingly to infinity, peppered with rounded office porticoes and rounded windows. He'd never seen such a tidy space outside of a laboratory.\n\n\"Fuck you,\" he muttered. He turned and started walking again.\n\nHe passed a second mirror; the monster popped back into his peripheral vision. \"You dropped something.\"\n\nHe sighed. He clenched both hands into fists. He continued to walk.\n\n\"No-one else will notice. It's your responsibility.\"\n\n\"Fuck //you,//\" he whispered.\n\nHe passed a third mirror. \"What if someone steps on it? What if they slip, and fall? A long, empty hallway, cold, hard surfaces. No-one to help.

The last mirror Phil had ever properly seen his own reflection in, as a matter of fact.\n\nThe song was familiar. Phil started to hum along, and felt his tension wash away into the air and the porcelain both. He sanitized his hands with a wall-mounted dispenser, zipped up his pants and walked over to the sink. By the time the water was flowing, he realized what he was humming.\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\"A capital ship for an ocean trip was the //Walloping Window-Blind!//\"\n\nTo his complete astonishment, the apparition joined in.\n\n\"No gale that blew dismayed her crew, or troubled the captain's mind.\"\n\n\"The man at the wheel was taught to feel contempt for the wildest blow-ow-ow...\"\n\nThey were both singing together, now, Phil's mock baritone on a bed of Doug's glottal bass. \"And it often appeared, when the weather had cleared, that he'd been in his bunk below!\"\n\nPhil paused, and Doug paused with him. He was suddenly flooded with memories: lying in bed at night, his parents singing to him from an old book his father had kept from his own childhood. He could picture the illustrations. He could smell the musty pages.\n\nHe could hear his parents' voices.\n\nHe looked at the face in the mirror, and felt a lump in his throat so heavy he knew he could never swallow it.\n\nInstead, he sang.\n\n\"THEN! Blow, ye winds, heigh-ho! A-roving I will go!\"\n\n\"I'll stay no more on England's shore, so let the music play-ay-ay.\" It was comical. It didn't work at all. It worked perfectly.\n\nTogether they bellowed, Phil's eyes welling with tears, the washroom reverberating with their asymmetrical, raucous roar. \"I'm off for the morning train! I'll cross the raging main! I'm off to my love with a boxing glove, ten thousand miles away!\"\n\n\"HEY!\" Phil shouted, the sound bouncing across the lino as he spread his arms wide, furious and weeping and full of life.\n\nThe washroom door swung open. A man with windswept grey hair, a stern graven countenance, a morning dress suit and a labcoat swept in.\n\nThe man opened his mouth to say something, then glanced in the mirror.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bf7600; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:12 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nChief Nascimbeni scanned the report, nodded, and dropped it into an open desk drawer. He closed the drawer with his foot.\n\nPhil stared at him. \"That's it?\"\n\n\"Yeah. That's it.\" Nascimbeni smiled apologetically.\n\nPhil raised both eyebrows.\n\nNascimbeni sighed. \"Dr. Falkirk called ahead. He told me to box your report.\"\n\n\"What?

Isn't he?\"\n\n\"You haven't logged into 43NET today, huh.\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"Guess not.\"\n\n\"O5 suspended Dr. McInnis.

Because after what just happened, I'm starting to wonder.\"\n\nShe pulled a pen out of her labcoat pocket. \"Tell me what you think happened.\"\n\nDr. Nhung Ngo was tiny, earnest, wide-eyed and friendly. She could think circles around him, as he well knew from his annual psych reviews. She could also kick his ass into next Thursday, according to department scuttlebutt; she was an expert in a martial art he couldn't begin to spell, much less pronounce.\n\n//No, it's not,// he thought. \n\n\"That's racist,\" said Doug.\n\nMost importantly for Phil's present circumstances, Dr. Ngo was Senior Researcher in Psychology and Parapsychology at Site-43. She was supposedly debriefing him after an experiment had gone \"wrong\"; she was actually trying to shrink his head, and he wasn't really having it.\n\n\"What I //think// happened,\" he repeated. \"Okay.

Or are you?\"\n\nShe pointed at Doug with her pen. \"What's it saying?\"\n\n\"Answer my question first.\"\n\nShe clipped her pen to her clipboard — //everyone's got clipboards around here// — and sighed. \"Dr. Falkirk clawed his own eye out when your friend there manifested on it. The S&C agents who escorted you should've explained that much.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"They told me Doug attacked him.\" For a moment, he remembered Dr. Bradbury and her perfect skin. \"I didn't know he... wow. Wow.\" He looked over his shoulder at the mirror mounted beside the door; Doug blinked at him patiently. \"Is he alright?\"\n\nShe didn't respond, so he looked back at her. She was pointing again. \"A question for a question. What did it say?\"\n\nPhil thought about it for a moment.\n\n\"He said he'd like to see me do some mopping. Mopping calms him down.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bf7600\"]]\n++ 8 September\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bf7600; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:06 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n//Not this kind of mopping, though.//\n\nPhil stepped onto the subway platform. He heard three tones behind him, and a recorded female voice: \"Please stand clear of the doors.\" They were closed by the time he reached the security checkpoint, and the train was gone by the time he entered AAF-D. \n\nThe Inter-Sectional Subway System was a necessity at Site-43, as several of the Acroamatic Abatement Facilities were located far afield for safety reasons. There was talk of decommissioning the AAF-D station, however, because there was talk of decommissioning AAF-D.\n\n//Can't happen soon enough,// he grumbled internally as he sloped into the suit lock-up. //Can't believe they've got me doing this __again__.//\n\nHe approached the hazmat locker, and paused. He looked around the room; the mirrors were all empty. He leaned in close, looking through the ventilation slits, and grinned. \"Nice.\" He swung the locker open and applauded.\n\nDoug had apparated on the faceplate of his suit.\n\nIt took him ten minutes to get into the thing, and another five to get the anti-spectral cage up and running. As he trundled it past the control room, he looked through the observation glass at the ceiling-mounted digital clock.\n\n//6:21. Jesus Christ.//\n\n\"Do you know what happened at 6:21 today, last year?\" he asked Doug, who was now filling the window and blocking his view of the clock.\n\nThe apparition abruptly apparated on the faceplate of Phil's suit again, peering inward at him. Phil jumped back involuntarily, but of course the ragged rictus kept pace.\n\n\"Boom,\" said Doug.\n\nPhil suddenly felt butterflies in his stomach.\n\n\"Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.\" There was something audible beneath Doug's sepulchral groaning, something that was getting closer, getting louder. \"__BOOM__ __BOOM__ __BOOM__ __BOOM__ __BOOM__ **__BOOM__ __BOO__-**\"\n\nThe explosions out-boomed Doug's mocking echoes as a pipe burst beside him, coating his suit with grey-green fluid; Doug danced in the droplets, one at a time, gurning in the spray. The fluid became a thick solid, like syrup, as it ran down Phil's sleeves. It seemed to wash away the pristine white polymer surface...\n\n\"Oh,\" said Phil. \"Oh.\"\n\nThere was a painting hiding under the gloss, an underpainting in his suit lining. He recognized it: //The Last Judgment,// by Michelangelo. \n\nHe looked up, searching for Doug; Doug was gone.\n\nThe control room was also gone.\n\nHe wheeled in place. The control room was behind him, where it had been last year. Before the renovations.\n\nBefore...\n\n**__BOOM__**.\n\nHe froze.\n\n**__BOOM__**.\n\n//The 2002 Overture.//\n\n**__BOOM__**.\n\nIn the control room, beneath a ceiling-mounted analogue clock, two men were arguing. They were arguing next to a pipe; Phil pressed up against the glass and pounded on it with one gloved fist. He knew the men. He knew about the pipe.\n\nOne man — //Markey// — ran across the room, hammering furiously at a control console. The other man — //Ambrogi// — stayed near the pipe, yanking a telephone receiver from the wall and dialing frantically.\n\nThe pipe burst, and a wave of... a //wave// rolled over Ambrogi, and he burst as well. The control room window was covered in blood. It flowed up, and down, suffusing the glass until there was no glass at all, only a rippling sanguine carpet which expanded outward towards him.\n\nHe staggered back as Doug apparated on the advancing wall of what was now a vast skein of shiny pink flesh.\n\nDoug screamed. \n\n\"RUN.\"\n\nPhil ran.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bf7600; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:38 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nAzad Banerjee squeezed his shoulder. \"You're alright, buddy. You're alright.\"\n\nChief Nascimbeni was shouting instructions to the cleanup crew. There were S&C agents everywhere, a crawling black knot of late-arrival security. There were EPAU agents with kind words, blankets, stretchers and emergency amnestics.\n\nPhil was still wearing the hazmat suit, the helmet zipped off and hanging from one shoulder. \"What the fuck,\" he said. \"What the //fuck.//\"\n\nDoug stared up at him, upside-down in the helmet's faceplate. \"What goes around, comes around.\"\n\n\"What's he saying?\"\n\nPhil ignored them both. \"What the //fuck.//\"\n\nNascimbeni walked over, hands shoved into his jacket pockets. He looked... not alright, actually. Much the way Phil felt. \"You holding up?\"\n\n\"He's alright,\" said Azad.\n\nPhil met the Chief's dark eyes. \"What the fuck?\" he begged.\n\nNascimbeni sighed heavily. \"We... well. In retrospect, it makes sense... there's a lot of what Applied Occultism calls 'counter-chronological material' in AAF-D. It looks like we're going to see that breach every year.\"\n\n//What?// He took a moment to collect his thoughts, then said \"What?\"\n\n\"That's what they're telling me.\" He jerked a thumb over his shoulder; the Chief of S&C, Delfina Ibanez, was huddled in hushed conversation with a female doctor he didn't recognize and the Site Director. Phil had seen Dr. McInnis out of his office maybe a dozen times in four years. \"It's a stable time loop. Even the victims came back to life... briefly.\" His eyes were watering.\n\nPhil nodded, feeling surreal. \"I saw Markey,\" he said. \"And... Ambrogi.\"\n\nNascimbeni squeezed his other shoulder. \"That can't have been easy.\"\n\nPhil looked down at Doug's hideous, inverted face. \"It was worse for them.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Philip?

His words were frantic. \"Tell me... uh... what... how long have you worked...?\"\n\nShe put down her fork. \"I have a pretty high threshold for awkwardness,\" she said. \"But you've crossed it about five times in the last five minutes.\"\n\n\"Alone,\" said Doug. \"Always.\"\n\n\"What's it saying?\"\n\n\"I'm so fucking sick of people asking me that.\"\n\nShe blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Eleven years, people are non-stop asking me 'What's he saying?'

There had never been Christmas, Hanukkah, Ramadan or Diwali events, the occasional civic long weekend produced the occasional desultory party, and birthdays were usually observed to some extent. Anything with fireworks was out, of course — minus the annual display in AAF-D. The closest thing to an official festivity happened every year on February 14: the orientation for January's new hires.\n\nAzad Banerjee had once speculated that the Chairs and Chiefs simply wanted to dodge the emotional bullet that was Valentine's Day. Staring at the crop of confused, fresh-faced technicians in a cluster at the centre of the cafeteria, Phil was inclined to agree. They were a polyglot bunch, drawn as all Foundation employees were from a worldwide pool of qualified candidates. All shapes and sizes, genders, ethnicities... the only things they had in common were orange jumpsuits and technical proficiencies of one stripe or another.\n\nThe supervisors and foremen were sitting behind tables and stacks of paper, or leaning against counters, or dragging chairs into circles to organize their shifts. Phil was standing beside a mirror, waiting.\n\nOne by one, the new recruits wandered over to awkwardly greet him and his constant companion. They'd been told to do this before leaving the orientation; since 2003 Phil had been present for each and every one of these \"ceremonies,\" for every Section, carefully explaining his teleporting pattern screamer so that nobody walked in on them in the washroom and —\n\n\"Hi! Are you Philip E. Deering?\"\n\nThe face in front of him was unbelievably fresh. He couldn't imagine how he'd failed to pick her out of the crowd. She was a bit shorter than him, her hair was limp and messy, and her eyes were the size and shape of an avocado.\n\n\"That would be disgusting,\" said Doug. \"She isn't disgusting.

He felt quite sick. \"Well, tell him he's not disgusting either.\"\n\n\"Nobody's ever told him that before.\"\n\nShe beamed up at him. \"Everybody should treat him better, then.

He always wore a simple, long-sleeved white dress shirt with black dress pants. He was gaunt, vaguely smug-looking, and his smiles rarely reached his eyes. This was the sum total of what Phil knew about him, save that he was Director of Site-43.\n\nThat final fact was the only thing which mattered to Phil at the moment.\n\n\"It's just that I have seniority,\" he said. The director nodded, hands clasped on top of his expensive oak desk, smiling what he probably thought was an encouraging smile. \"I've been here twenty-one years, longer than anyone in the Section except Chief Nascimbeni.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm seeing you.\" McInnis leaned back in his chair. \"You've done a lot for us, so I owe you at least a brief hearing.\"\n\nPhil didn't like the sound of that. \"You're trapped,\" said Doug, from the gloss of the director's desk nameplate.\n\n\"I have seniority,\" he repeated. \"If the Chief is retiring, I don't see why I shouldn't be considered.\"\n\nMcInnis pursed his lips. \"You mean besides the fact that you have an active anomaly dogging your footsteps twenty-four seven.\"\n\nPhil nodded, not breaking eye contact. \"Yes.

Not until it was too late.\n\nHe wasn't quite sure where he was going, but he knew he had to go somewhere. By the time he'd reached the locked door to the I-Triple-S station, however, he had something of a plan in mind.\n\nHe had keys. He used them.\n\n\"Where are we going, Philip?\" The apparition glared up at him from his wristwatch, which he'd rotated to face inward. The last thing he needed was for Doug to fuck everything up by screeching.\n\n\"We're going back where it started,\" he said. \"We're going to...\" He trailed off.\n\nThere had once been two ISSS stops near Phil's quarters: one for Habitation and Sustenance, and one for AAF-D. When they'd finally decommissioned the thing in 2015, the extra station had been shuttered as well. Phil knew there would be no trains running now, with the lockdown in place; he also knew his J&M keycard would get him into AAF-D from the abandoned station, so he wouldn't have to walk through the main airlock.\n\nAmelia would be standing there, waiting for her part in the annual drama. Chief Nascimbeni's part, really; the time loop made no allowance for the ravages of... time.\n\n\"Would it be so bad to see her again?\"\n\nHe felt momentarily weak.\n\n\"What are you planning, Philip?\"\n\nHe walked to the subway platform and, grimacing, sat down over the edge. It was a six-foot drop to the tracks, and he had to aim carefully.

Phil was thinking about the file; he was thinking, in particular, about Dr. Falkirk's marginal notes. The man had been obsessed, going over every experiment report, annotating the Special Containment Procedures with his doubts about Phil's significance to the anomaly — even a janitor knew you weren't supposed to do shit like that. \n\nOne phrase in particular had stuck with him. He couldn't get it out of his head.\n\n//Further experimentation is indicated.//\n\nWhen they reached the AAF-D platform, the apparition broke its silence.\n\n\"How do you intend to get back up?\"\n\nPhil blew out a long breath. He'd only ever used the ISSS as a rider — it had its own dedicated techs — so he didn't know where the maintenance access was. He was now at track level, six feet below the platform, and he had no clue how he was going to get up there without having another heart attack.\n\nHe heard the unmistakable //click// of a keycard reader from somewhere ahead.\n\nHe ran to the platform and leapt.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:16 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n//Who?

She hadn't even died yet; he'd seen the camera feeds once, and it had been hard to wrap his head around. The entire facility started filling up with Xeroxed copies of her around 6:21, wafer-thin, life-sized and upright, all of them stock still and screaming silently. He actually ran into one of them, accidentally; it blew apart like a sheet of ashes. When she did die, in less than four minutes, he wouldn't be able to see the pipes for the Mukamis.\n\nHe could barely see the pipes as it was. For a moment they had been madly cycling through all the colours of the rainbow, and a few he'd never seen before which made his thigh start itching. Now they were bright white and vibrating, pulsating, visibly straining to escape the bounds of their three-dimensional existence. There was a gelatinous orange tentacle snaking between them —\n\n\"DOWN,\" Doug screamed, and Phil dove.\n\nA labcoat fluttered over his head, hanging from a man's flailing body. The man was being hauled into the pipes by the tentacle, and he was hollering; the words came out as text, tumbling down to shatter like black glass on the tiles.\n\n//Book Antiqua,// he thought, hysterically.\n\n\"RUN,\" Doug screamed, and Phil ran.\n\n\"Is anyone in there?\" Phil almost stopped at the sound of Amelia's voice reciting Chief Nascimbeni's line, the line which would cause Markey to pause in his flight from the facility and be killed. //Fuck.

He didn't dare look.\n\nHe did look at the middle-aged man who stood stock-still at the end of the corridor, holding a suitcase, gaping at the chaos. There was an actinic flash, the suitcase snapped open and Phil's eyes snapped shut; when he opened them, he was charging through a hailstorm of pink half-lemons...\n\n...and struck a wall, hard, head-first. This would normally have been a problem, but the walls were now incredibly ductile. The surface absorbed him, like a massive sheet of rubber, and spat him back out onto his ass. He felt his tailbone implode as lemons and laundry scattered all around him, blue juice soaking the floor tiles, and he shouted in pain and frustration.\n\n\"DEERING?!\"\n\nNils Niemenin was cowering against a line of translucent pipes, a crowd of Mukamis surrounding him like a chain of paper dolls. The pipes were filled with a heterochrome orange/green gas; there was so much not-ash swimming within that —\n\nPhil scrambled forward, slipping and sliding on the tiles, and tackled Niemenin to the ground by his legs.\n\nThe pipes exploded, and for a moment there was nothing, literally nothing at all above them, just a vast, flat blue void. Ceiling tiles rained down, soaking their clothing and pooling around their bodies like...\n\n...rain.\n\nThe void vanished and the corridor reappeared, //sans// ceiling. The top halves of the Mukami printouts were gone, and the bottom halves fluttered to the floor. They were bleeding.\n\nPhil staggered to his feet, ignoring all the warning signals his body was throwing at him. He grabbed Niemenin by the armpit and hauled him against the wall.\n\n\"What,\" he wheezed, \"the //fuck.//\"\n\nThe doctor's handsome face was streaked with tears. His mouth was twisting and untwisting furiously on his chiseled jaw. His sweat-soaked hair even sported a cowlick. //Superman indeed.//\n\n\"YOU!\" Niemenin finally spat, shoving Phil back. \"You and your FUCKING boyfriend!\"\n\nPhil looked both ways down the hallway, warily, as Niemenin adjusted his tie. \"We need to get out of here.\"\n\nSomething hit him, hard, and he struck the tiles again. \"Every god-damn day,\" Niemenin barked, rolling up his sleeves. \"Phil-this and Phil-that. You'd think you were Harrison fucking Ford, or something.\" Niemenin clutched his jumpsuit by the zipper and swung him back to his feet. \"Like there was nobody else in the world but Phil Deering, Philip //E.// Deering, the man with the mirror monster.\" He slammed Phil against a string of unbroken pipes. \"Well, you know what you are, now! You might as well join the //danse macabre// and leave life to the living. She belongs to ME!\"\n\n\"What?\" Phil spluttered.\n\n\"DOWN,\" said Doug.\n\nPhil dropped, dead weight, pulling Niemenin with him. Something bright and blue sliced through the air, splitting the pipes wide open. Music leaked out like treacle; he recognized it instantly. //Tchaikovsky.//\n\n\"We need to go,\" said Phil. He pulled his protesting bones up one more time, grabbed Niemenin's arm, and ran.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:26 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"It's right here,\" said Phil, leading Niemenin by the hand. They swung roughly 'round the corner, collided with each other against the wall, and stumbled the last few steps to the vault door. \n\nThere was a glass case on the wall containing one canister of abatement fluid; Phil unlocked it, fumbling with the keys, and passed the canister to Niemenin. \"Get in,\" he gasped. \"We get in, we close the door, and we spray that shit all over... our...\"\n\nDr. Falkirk was walking towards them, striding intangibly through a clattering, sparking stormcloud of airborne machinery and ruptured conduits.

Get up.\"\n\nHe couldn't. \"I can't.\"\n\n\"Philip. Get //up.//\"\n\nHe reached above him, blindly, and found the vault door handle with both hands. He pulled, desperately, hopelessly, and smeared his body against the convex surface. He couldn't breathe.\n\n\"Do you want me to go with him, Philip?\"\n\n\"Falkirk...?\" he muttered.\n\n\"No,\" said Doug.\n\nHe hung there for a moment, feeling the cool metal against his face, realizing that Niemenin at least was safe. //Superman hit me with a jizz canister. The last son of Krypton's in the gunk tank. I'm sorry, Amelia.// The thaumic overflow relief system was about to sweep AAF-D clean, drawing all the esoteric insanity into a series of vacuum conduits, incidentally obliterating in spectacular fashion anyone unfortunate enough to still be alive in the facility.\n\nHe stopped trying to pull himself up, and simply... did.\n\nHe raised the watch to his face.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\n\"No //what?//\" said Doug.\n\n\"No, I don't want you to go with Niemenin.\"\n\nThe apparition blinked. \"Why?\"\n\n\"You fucking know why,\" he snapped. \"You can read my fucking mind.\" He slumped against the vault door, barely keeping upright. He stared at the hands of the watch, behind Doug's head. //Seconds to spare.//\n\nA thought occurred to him. \"If you go with him, you'll be alright, won't you?\"\n\nNo response. Doug's scars, all three, were trembling slightly.\n\n\"Won't you? We don't know what'll happen if you stay with me, when I...\" He was crying, now. \"God DAMMIT, Amelia, I'm sorry. Doug, I'm sorry.

The vault door.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\n\"Polish the vault door, Philip.\"\n\nHe opened his eyes. \"What?\"\n\n\"Polish the vault door, Philip. Use your jumpsuit.\" There was a series of loud BANGs, a series of loud SNAPs, and a low hiss filled the air. \"Do it now.\"\n\nPhil stared at the watch for a moment longer, then pulled his right sleeve up over the hand and furiously rubbed it against the matte grey door. The surface darkened gradually, then lightened as the emergency bulbs began reflecting.\n\n\"Faster, Philip. Faster.\"\n\nHe pushed his shoulder into the metal and heaved, pressing all his weight against it, buffing the dusky surface to a near-mirror sheen.\n\nA near-mirror sheen...\n\nA wall of steam and colour and fire and lightning and the sound of a lover's lament and the smell of wet cardboard and lavender and the memory of geometry and dozens of whirling Xeroxed Mukamis and an endless knotted string of flesh and gristle barreled down the hall towards him, and the walls pulsated like tin foil, and two bony grey arms burst out of the vault door and pulled him into the rough embrace of oblivion.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf\"]]\n++ 9 September\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **9:14 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\nHe was lying on his side, looking into an empty mirror. //An empty mirror.// He chuckled dryly; his tongue felt like sandpaper. //Nobody but me sees it that way.//\n\nHe was lying in a bed. //Hospital.//\n\nHe panicked.\n\n\"DOUG?!\"\n\nHe flipped onto his back, the fear an icy clutch on his throat, a leaden weight in his stomach. \"DOUG?!

Talk about your undiscerning acts of kindness. You know he told everyone you lured him into AAF-D to kill him?

Your friend was looking over you from the shards still in the frame. I'd tell you what the security feed shows, but we both know your heart's not strong. Big, maybe, but not strong.\"\n\nHe remembered the vault door, and winced. \"You're probably right.\" He looked around the room; his PDA and a large white envelope sat on a bedside tray. \n\nHe pointed at the envelope, eyebrows raised.\n\n\"Yep. That's for you.\"\n\nHe picked it up. One of those old drawstring deals; he started unwinding the string. \n\n\"You want a drumbeat?\" she asked.\n\nThere was a single piece of thick card inside the envelope.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ He drew it out slowly...\" hide=\"...and took in a sharp breath.\"]]\n\n[[html]]\n<br style=\"line-height: 10px\" />\n[[/html]]\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-significant-others-part-b/MajorAward.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\"Two hundred and fifty-one months,\" Doug remarked. \"Much lower than four hundred and fifteen.\"\n\nHe didn't know what to say. He didn't know if he could say anything.\n\nThere was a tiny, typewritten note clipped to the corner:\n\n> Nothing official, you understand.\n> - A.J.M.\n\nHe rose up on his elbows, forcing the pillow back against the bedframe, and admired the certificate.\n\n\"Something for the sprog,\" said Dr. Forsythe. \"Grampy was a good janitor.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Sprog. Yeah.\" He carefully slid the certificate back into the envelope and curled the drawstring over the fob. \"So, uh... has anyone been in to see me?\"\n\nForsythe was checking an ECG machine. He belatedly realized he was leaded up again; he'd nearly pulled a few out in his excitement. \"Yeah, someone,\" she said vaguely. \"Had to kick them out three times.\" She pointed at the PDA. \"Maybe you'd better read up before you go looking for them.\"\n\nHe picked it up, and turned it on.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #D6EAF2; padding: 6px;\"]]\n43NET Bulletins\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px;\"]]\n**Attention, all sections:** Having completed his duties ahead of schedule, Dr. Nils Niemenin has departed from Site-43. In his short time at our facility he has done impressive work with the security systems, and we wish him the best of luck with his new posting at Site-17!

Niemenin attempted to thwart security protocols for SCP-5243 (cascade containment breach/unstable time loop) yesterday evening, nearly resulting in his death. He spoofed the personnel tracking database through unknown means and redirected the cameras in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D to obscure his presence. Suspecting foul play beforehand, Dr. L. Lillihammer had already installed safeguards allowing her to independently monitor the facility; her full report has been filed with Security and Containment.\n\nDr. Niemenin has been removed from Site-43 by MTF Pi-43 (\"Garbage In, Garbage Out\") and remanded to temporary psychiatric care at Site-17.\n\nChief Amelia Torosyan (Janitorial and Maintenance Section) was preparing to file a formal complaint against Dr. Niemenin for harassment. According to the complaint, on 09/07/2020 Chief Torosyan broke off her romantic relationship with Dr. Niemenin via SCiPNET. He immediately requested a transfer from Site-19 to Site-43, ostensibly to undertake a computer systems upgrade for the Arms and Equipment and Acroamatic Abatement Sections. In actual fact he intended to resume his relationship with Chief Torosyan, and interfere with containment of SCP-5243. He refuses to divulge whether this action was intended to impress her in some way, or instead to end his life.\n\nS&C Chief D. Ibanez theorizes that Dr. Niemenin lured Technician JM64, Philip E. Deering, to AAF-D in order to confront him. (In addition to acting as Deering's supervisor, Chief Torosyan is friendly with Deering; Dr. Niemenin's motive may have been jealousy.) He appears to have spoofed Deering's location as well to disguise this act. Video feeds show several altercations between the two, though Deering was apparently attempting to save his attacker's life. Dr. Niemenin has refused to comment on this aspect of the incident.\n\nChief Torosyan has requested, with Dr. Niemenin's agreement, that he be amnesticized so that the events of the past two years will no longer interfere with his duties. The Ethics Committee has approved this request, with the added stipulation that Dr. Niemenin be permanently barred from fraternization with Foundation personnel, placed on permanent notice for sexual harassment, implanted with a tracking chip, undergo therapy, and be subject to regular conduct reviews for the duration of his employment. Should his value to the Foundation as a security systems expert decline, more drastic measures may be taken.\n\nJM64 is to be commended for his valiant performance under difficult circumstances.

What an asshole.\"\n\n\"I don't... wait. Why did I even get that last message?\" He picked up the PDA again, and showed Dr. Forsythe the screen.\n\nShe shrugged. \"I guess McInnis CCd you. Probably a one-time deal; I wouldn't expect to get much Level 4 mail, going forward.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"I can't believe... god, poor Amelia.\" Sympathy and fury were fighting for control; sympathy was winning, but fury was putting up a good fight.\n\nShe nodded. \"I wouldn't be surprised if she transferred to 43 to get away from him in the first place. Men like that don't know the meaning of the word 'no'.\"\n\nHis mind was racing. \"That //fucker,//\" he said. \"He //kissed// her.\"\n\nShe nodded again, a look of pure disgust on her face. \"Of course he did. I'll bet she started writing the complaint in her head at that exact second. She gave him a whole day, kept up appearances for him, tried to let him keep his dignity and take it with him out of her life, but nope. Had to press the issue, do whatever he thought he was doing in the Sorcery Sewer.\"\n\n\"He was trying to take Doug.\" Phil looked at the mirror; the mirror looked back at him.\n\n\"Like I said, what an asshole. Wiping his mind? They should bring back that demotion to D-class thing. People like that don't change.\"\n\nHe looked down at the PDA, barely seeing it. \"I can't believe I saved his life.\" There was something else on his mind, clamouring for attention, but it was too new, too huge, too terrific to even consider at the moment.\n\nDr. Forsythe patted him on the shoulder. \"You saved his life because //you,//\" and she carefully began removing the ECG leads, \"are //not// an asshole. And it hasn't gone unnoticed.\" She gestured at the tray again; a smaller envelope was sticking out from beneath the first one.\n\nHe tore it open, and started to laugh.\n\nShe looked down at the card. \"Look who's popular, all of a sudden.\"\n\nIt was a custom job, printed on high-quality, high-brightness matte paper in colour ink. Dominating the front was a rather lame artistic representation of Doug, glaring gormlessly at him from what was presumably the frame of a mirror. He recognized it instantly, though he'd last seen the sketch eleven years prior. There was a caption, above and below: \"GET WELL SOON! We'll be watching!\"\n\nIt was signed. His eye was drawn immediately to the red squiggles by Doug's left shoulder, but through dint of great effort he forced himself to read the others first. There was a bad joke in bad taste from Eddie Simms (\"Can I borrow 5056?\"), an almost illegible dismissal from Dr. Blank (\"Walk it off\"), some unreadable chicken scratch from whoever \"R\" was, a misfired cliché from Dr. Sokolsky (\"SHOOT FOR THE STARS\"), and...\n\nHe bit his lip.\n\n\"Wuss,\" said the message in the top left corner. It was signed \"Azad.\"\n\n\"Chief Torosyan brought that in. Contacted Site-01, had it shipped over with the sealed orders from Ethics. Passed it around for people to sign... she got your PDA from your hab unit, too.\"\n\n\"That was nice of her.\" //That __was__ nice of her. I hope she burned that fucking... file...//\n\nThe thought vanished into his subconscious. There was no room left up front for anything but the final signature on the card.\n\nHe wondered if he really was going to have another heart attack.\n\nThree symbols, red ink: [[span style=\"color:red\"]]**♥ A T**[[/span]]\n\nHis hands were shaking again. \"Can I get out of here?\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **10:02 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nHe could breathe again, he could think again, he felt a weight lifted from the pit of his stomach as he walked into the cafeteria, and saw her.\n\nAmelia Torosyan was sitting at the same table, under the same mirror, wearing the same jumpsuit and the same slicked-back hairstyle from the previous night. Her face was wall-to-wall redness and heavy black bags; if she'd slept at all, he couldn't see it. \n\nHer eyes had already been fixed on the doorway, and his met hers across the empty room. The smile which broke across her face like the sun on a stormy day was the brightest, most welcoming thing he'd ever seen in his entire life.\n\nHe walked to the table, gesturing at it with one trembling hand. \"Why are you sitting in the cafeteria, late at night, by yourself, with no food?\"\n\nHer eyes were shining, now. \"I'm meeting someone.\" His heart almost broke at the sound of her voice; he'd never heard such plain, undisguised relief.\n\nHe sat down at the table, and they watched each other in silence for a moment. He wasn't sure where Doug was, but that was fine. He was around, somewhere near, and that was good enough.\n\nHer hands were in her pockets.\n\nHe reached out with his own, tentatively, heart fluttering.\n\nWithout hesitation she placed the sleeves of her jumpsuit on the table, hands nestled in the cuffs.\n\nHe slid his fingers past the ridged fabric, and she turned her wrists, and their fingers entwined, and his hands stopped shaking, and hers became warm to the touch. He drew them out of the sleeves, clasping them close, and she stroked his palms with her fingertips.\n\nTheir shared gaze hadn't broken for more than an instant since he'd entered the room. She was positively glowing.\n\nHe caught a faint flicker in the mirror with his peripheral vision, and he heard Doug beginning to hum. It was a soft, comforting sound.\n\n//I'm off to my love with a boxing glove, ten thousand miles away.//\n\nShe narrowed her eyes impishly, cocking her head to one side. \"What's he saying?\"\n\nHe didn't look at the mirror. He didn't know how he'd ever be able to look away from her ever again.\n\n\"He's not saying anything.\"\n\n[[=image Philmelia.jpg]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[/the-significant-others-part-a The Significant Others, Part \"A\"]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[SCP-5382]]]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** Philmelia.jpg\n\nThis image utilized the following reference materials, in addition to materials created by the author using [https://www.daz3d.com/ Daz Studio]:\n\n> **Name:** Shopping!\n> **Author:** Richard Giles\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardgiles/5067224818/ flickr]\n\n> **Name:** Tokyo\n> **Author:** Richard Giles\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardgiles/4224690076/ flickr]\n\n> **Name:** Twitter 365 Project - Day 55\n> **Author:** Richard Giles\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardgiles/3305638389/ flickr]\n\n> **Name:** Weezie on the Subway\n> **Author:** Richard Giles\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/richardgiles/4246835894/ flickr]\n\n----\n\n> **Filename:** MajorAward.png, Others.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
