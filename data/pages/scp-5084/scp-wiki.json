All Foundation personnel with level 2 clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-5084 at the discretion of the site director.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5084 is the collective sum of 40 cherry tomatoes (//Lycopersicon lycopersicum var. cerasiforme//) invulnerable to decomposition. SCP-5084's anomalous capabilities manifest when an individual is made aware of the presence of SCP-5084 in their immediate vicinity. The individual will firmly believe that all instances of SCP-5084 are sentient. Individuals have experienced auditory hallucinations in which they report hearing SCP-5084 produce human-like vocalizations. Individuals describe SCP-5084 instances as \"scared, nervous, and untrusting\" due to their vocalizations being described as childlike. SCP-5084's anomalous properties do not manifest when exposed to Foundation personnel.[[footnote]]Any individual who has been employed by the SCP Foundation for a period of more than one month[[/footnote]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5084 was discovered in a hotel located in Las Vegas, Nevada. SCP-5084 was housed in a terrarium residing in the entrance of the hotel. All guests were extremely protective of SCP-5084, physically berating any individuals who harmed SCP-5084 specimens. The Foundation was contacted when nearby businesses and local residents entered the hotel and were detained by local authorities. Foundation operatives observed attempts to plant SCP-5084 instances in an effort of preserving SCP-5084 through their offspring before acquiring SCP-5084.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 5084-A: Test Log 2020/02/01\" hide=\"- Addendum 5084-A: Test Log 2020/02/01\"]]\n\n||~ Subject ||~ Foreword ||~ Experiment ||~ Results ||\n|| D-38291 || Subject framed for murder, put on death row. || D-38291 is instructed to make eye contact with SCP-5084 and transcribe SCP-5084's statements.

They just don't know why the men in coats can't hear them. They're talking about you, aren't they?\n> \n> **Test Overseer:** We told you 38291, they aren't sentient.

You've sliced them, crushed them, diced them. What's next? Am I going to eat one of them or something?\n> \n> **Test Overseer:** Actually, yes. You are to consume an SCP-5084 specimen.\n> \n> **D-38291:** ...I'm not going to do that.\n> \n> **Test Overseer:** We'll give you one more chance 38291.
