The Purple Witch is an inherently mysterious character so creating artwork for her was a great exercise in character design. Since the SCP Foundation knows little about her, but the stories about Ms. Mirabilis show her clearly, I wanted to make that aspect clear in the design.\n\nPlease let me know either in the discussion or PM if you'd like to see more character designs or if you have an article that you may want me to design a human or humanoid for. I also make a variety of art, but once I get a good base of humanoid designs, I'll go ahead and begin to consider drawing further out of my comfort zone. Thanks for checking out my art!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false| last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/art:the-pale-lady | previous-title=art: The Pale Lady\n| next-url=/ | next-title=Coming soon!\n| hub-url=/art:ms-mirabilis | hub-title=art: Ms. Mirabilis\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Ms-Mirabilis.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user MissBirdy]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:ms-mirabilis SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
