OTF Delta-7 has a two nautical mile restricted waters perimeter, sustained under the guise of military-funded scientific research.\n\nAquatic-Research Facility-98C is located in the SCP-4778 breeding grounds in the Northern Pacific Ocean. Facility-98C is responsible for the safety of SCP-4778  instances during the breeding season. All newly reported instances of SCP-4778 are to be safely escorted to this facility; after evaluation, new instances are to be introduced to the SCP-4778 pod.\n\nThe MTF Epsilon-31 (\"Harpoon-Hunters\") is currently seeking out and dismantling illegal whaling operations in areas of suspected SCP-4778 habitation. \n> \n**Description:** SCP-4778 are an anomalous subspecies of North-Pacific humpback whales (//Megaptera novaeangliae//). Instances are nearly identical to baseline humpback whales but possess bioluminescent stripes not found in any other currently known species of whale.\n\nUnlike non-anomalous humpback whales, whose diet consists of krill and small fish, SCP-4778's diet consists of human waste byproducts and oceanic pollutants. This has caused a deviation from normal humpback migration routes. SCP-4778 pods frequently traverse the \"Great Pacific Garbage Patch\"[[footnote]] A build-up of aquatic debris, trash, and other pollutants approximately 800,000 square kilometers. Created by man-made pollution and the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.[[/footnote]] before returning south to warmer waters for the breeding season. \n\nThe pollutants consumed by SCP-4778 instances are processed into a biological slurry consisting of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and previously undiscovered compounds. This bio-waste slurry is documented as SCP-4778-1. SCP-4778-1 has shown the ability to help support new aquatic sea life, repairing damage caused by the pollutants removed from the local ecosystem.  The organ or system directly responsible for this process is currently unknown. \n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Summary of SCP-4778-1 Test Results\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\nAfter SCP-4778-1 was determined safe, the following tests were done to evaluate its impact on aquatic ecology.\n\n[[table style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nDate\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nTest\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nEffects\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n1984/16/3\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[=]]\nSCP-4778-1 is introduced into a tank of plankton.\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n Within four days, the plankton multiplied approximately three times faster than the natural rate.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n1985/9/7\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[=]]\nSCP-4778-1 is introduced into a tank containing various subspecies of coral (//Acropora//)\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nWithin two weeks, coral showed a 26% increase in growth rates compared to control sample.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n1985/20/12\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[=]]\nSCP-4778-1 is introduced into a tank containing two adult Pacific halibut (//Hippoglossus stenolepis//) \n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nOver a week, both subjects showed increased vitality and previously noted damage began repairing on a cellular level at an increased rate of 2-5%.

Extensive research into the exact nature and origin of this mutagenic cluster has been made, but no conclusive explanation has been reached. The time necessary for this evolutionary deviation does not correlate with the availability of the species' food supply. \n\nSCP-4778-A shares key features found in man-made mutagens, though the methods for producing SCP-4778-A were not developed at the time of discovery; current technology has proved incapable of duplicating the results. \n\n>\n**Discovery:** On 12/13/1967 the following VHF radio communications were intercepted by a Foundation listening post in Hawaii.

By 1968, further investigation estimated a total species population of approximately 35,000 in the Pacific ocean alone.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION PARAZOOLOGY DIVISION \n\nDue to the increase in whaling operations since the time of discovery, as of 2019, the current global SCP-4778 population is estimated to be under 500 instances, with only 153 currently under Foundation observation. Due to the beneficial impact SCP-4778 has on the environment and the low disruption caused by its anomalous nature, it is the stated position of the Parazoology Division that drastic Foundation intervention is necessary and warranted to repopulate and preserve the species. SCP-4778 have the ability to help mitigate the immediate threat posed by oceanic pollution which outweighs the necessity for normalcy in this situation. \n\n-- Dr. Kyle Suttler, Director, Parazoology Division\n>\n##green|**[ETHICS COMMITTEE APPROVED]**##\n##red|**[PENDING O5 APPROVAL]**## \n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4777]]] | SCP-4778 | [[[SCP-4779]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
