Self-described as \"The only real person in chat right now\", they are known for their midwestern emo, goth rock, and DIY punk influences. Despite not really understanding what post-punk is, the nature of their underwhelming body of work encompasses the mostly sincere belief in \"being based\", and \"hanging out\" through the use of heavy synthetic beats and groundbreaking post-processing techniques that would become commonplace by the 22nd century. [[footnote]] Most notably, Garageband for iOS. [[/footnote]]\n\n+ EARLY CAREER (2021 – 2022)\n\nThe music ensemble has released a total of 5 albums throughout their existence, with their debut album //skip all of these songs please i didn't get it yet// (2021) serving as an inspiration for the subsequent rise in industrialization at the time. Their sophomore album, //this is not a joke these are the darkest of times// (2022), saw the duo's take on their contemporaries' greatest hits, such as [[[Fishishpage | DONTLOOKATME]]], [[[Fishishpage | The Cogs]]], and [[[Fishishpage | FiveFiveFiveFiveFive]]]. This atmospheric blend of genres was received to critical acclaim, and the album's extended edition, which featured collaborations with the bands whose songs were referenced, sold over 500 million copies.\n\n Following the infamous 2022 //departmentcon apology tour// tour, as well as years of rumours of internal strife between all members involved in the project, the band split up in 2022 citing \"who even cares, man\", and announcing that their subsequent album, //the donut shaped object// (2022), would be their last.\n\n+ REUNION (2022 – PRESENT)\n\nFor a period of about 12 days, the band remained out of the spotlight, occasionally appearing separately in sporadic interviews in newspapers, radio shows, and television talk shows. The band made only one joint appearance at the anniversary of //this is not a joke these are the darkest of times//, where they performed a set containing material from all of their previous albums, including the lesser-known //Commercial Jingles for Depression// (2021) and //Iced Coffee in a Godzilla-Themed McDonald's Cup// (2022).\n\nIn March of 2022, the band announced their return as a single individual, vowing to perform new material that had secretly been in the works for the past couple of days. The announcement was met with moderate interest, mainly due to the fact that no one really noticed the band had even stopped playing for any discernible amount of time.\n\n\n+ DISCOGRAPHY\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++ //skip all of these songs please i didn't get it yet// (2021)\n\n//i saw you intern at a desk job// – [[[SCP-5724 | PLAY]]]\n\n//plague before i met plague (pjp)// – [[[SCP-6049 | PLAY]]]\n\n//writing on the walls.// –  [[[SCP-6724 | PLAY]]]\n\n//wonderwall// – [[[fishish-s-proposal-j | PLAY]]]\n\n\n\n+++ //this is not a joke these were the darkest of times// (2022)\n\n//i am a scary ghost// (feat.
