SCP-616 may only be performed by --Grand Warlocks-- personnel of Level 4 or higher, and only in accordance with standard monthly Class D personnel budgets with prior O5 approval.\n\n**Description:** SCP-616 is --an arcane ritual born from the darkest depths of the Nether domain-- a ritualistic process --written in human blood-- created by --Grand Warlock-- --Master Ritualist-- Senior Researcher Dr. █████████. Upon completion, up to twelve (12) living human subjects are --summoned-- generated, which are suitable for induction as Class D personnel. SCP-616 was created to address the directive by the SCP Foundation Ethics Committee in response to increasing demand for Class D personnel for testing purposes, which threatened to exceed the number that could be safely inducted from standard channels.\n\nTo perform SCP-616, a --circle of the damned-- ritual circle must be inscribed into a flat smooth stone floor of at least 3 m x 3 m, which must match Illustration 616-1 exactly. The --soul-name of the chosen damned-- numeric designation of the Class D personnel must be inscribed into Circle 3 using Roman numerals, and a list of their --mortal sins-- convicted crimes and personality traits must be inscribed using Latin into Circles 4 and 5, respectively. Once the inscription has been double checked by at least two (2) other --Grand Warlocks-- attending personnel, all personnel must immediately [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED] therefore cleaning staff must be kept on standby throughout the entire duration of SCP-616.\n\n**Addendum 616-01:** Illustration 616-1\n\n[DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Addendum 616-02:** Dr. █████████ has been removed from SCP-616 duty, and is no longer allowed to personally alter Foundation documentation. Furthermore, Dr. █████████ is not to be referred to as \"Grand Warlock Darkfyre\".\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
