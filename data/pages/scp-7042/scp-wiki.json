Instances created by SCP-7042 are to be held within the on-site Wilderness Observation Chamber, with created instances being monitored for a period of 30 days. The Chambers are to be kept under observation by two security personnel armed with tranquilizers. After that period, nonthreatening anomalous instances are to be transferred to GOI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions), while nonanomalous entities are to be donated to local zoos alongside additional funding[[footnote]]However, transfers are currently suspended following Incident 7042-3.[[/footnote]]. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7042 consists of two constituent parts. SCP-7042-1 is a worn sketchbook with a heavily scarred leather-bound cover. SCP-7042-2 is a pencil, the body resembling birch bark in texture and pattern, which never grows dull no matter how often it is used. The first page of SCP-7042-1 displays a worn sketch of a fist within a heart wreathed in vines. All other pages will be blank outside of the faintest erasure marks. \n\nIf the name of an animal, whether it be the common parlance or scientific denomination, is entered into SCP-7042-1 using SCP-7042-2, the pencil will animate. Sliding from the hand of the subject, it will begin to sketch a drawing of the aforementioned animal. Within 30 seconds of the sketch being finished, a living version of that animal will appear within 20 feet of SCP-7042. The number of animals produced from one sketch is randomized, though numbers have yet to exceed --six individual instances-- 142 individual instances. Notably, these animals might directly correlate to the name entered, or they could differ in various ways, as discovered in testing. Genetic ancestors, cousins, and descendants have been produced by SCP-7042, as well as baseline species created with anomalous abilities. Many also show signs of increased fertility. This is further expounded upon in the Testing Logs.\n\n[[include component:image-block | name= HeartofGaea.png | caption=Imagery found within the \"Gaia's Fortune\" Hideout. | width=300]]\n\nSCP-7042 was recovered by MTF Beta-4 \"Castaways\" with additional aid from MTF Gamma-4 \"Green Stags\" after an attempted raid on Wilson's Wildlife Solutions by Serpent's Hand forces. Beta-4 tracked the fleeing cell members back to their hideout and immediately came under fire. Complicating matters was the intervention of SCP-7042-A1, which injured seven members of Beta-4 before being neutralized with high-grade tranquilizers.\n\nUpon entering the compound's interior, Beta-4 discovered documents detailing the creation of \"Gaia's Fortune,\" a mixture of Serpent's Hand members and former GoI-466 personnel. The cell’s leader willingly submitted himself into Foundation custody after Beta-4 found him in the middle of writing within SCP-7042.\n\n@@ @@\n\n= **Addendum 7042-1: Interview with PoI-8842**\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** PoI-8842\n\n**Interviewer:** Agent Marks\n\n**Foreword:** Initial interview with PoI-8842 regarding their actions and SCP-7042.\n\n**<Begin Log, 11:42, 5/1/202█>**\n\n**Agent Marks:** State your name for the record.\n\n**PoI-8842:** Come on, Marks, you know me.\n\n**Agent Marks:** Name. \n\n**PoI-8842:** Finn Mallory.

Not a conversation goes by without SCP-7042 coming up at least once.

News reached us recently from GoI-466 that both female Northern White Rhinos SCP-7042 created are pregnant with twins. \n\nMany of my fellow researchers were conservationists in a former life, and I can not lie that even amongst the Foundation, bitterness over the current trajectory of the world is widely felt, at least here at Site-84. Even I must admit that the reality that the object has possibly quadrupled the number of extant specimens is a stroke of good fortune. However, I care very little for 'luck.' I wish to know if we could control precisely what SCP-7042 produces. As of yet, it has all been random, from number to ability. It can reach back and forward in time and bring specimens to our doorstep; the opportunities there also go without saying. \n\nThe object is clearly intelligent, with keen situational awareness, and if I can rely upon the reports of my colleagues and subordinates, a personality echoing that of a young child. Perhaps this period of dormancy is little more than a momentary rebellion or a tantrum. I have been told that PoI-8842 often asks after the object and its status. I suppose it is time I finally pay him a visit. \n\nI refuse to commit to the giddy spirit that has overcome Site-84. SCP-7042 is not a harbinger of good fortune.

See, that's the problem with you Foundation types. You think that with enough poking and prodding, eventually, everything will fall perfectly in line with how you view the world. I heard you folks were turning over new leaves or something, letting bygones be bygones, not meddling where you aren't needed, but it's too tempting, right?\n\n**Dr. Erende:** What is?\n\n**PoI-8842:** The sketchbook. You know what she can do now, don't you? All those possibilities floating through your brain.\n\n**Dr. Erende:** She?\n\n**PoI-8842:** She, he, it, whatever, there's a mind in that little book. A mischievous, optimistic spirit that just wants to create. To bring life, and what is better, it likes fixing mistakes. Our mistakes. When I found her in the Yucatan...that book was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me. \n\n**Dr. Erende:** Many of my colleagues feel the same way. \n\n**PoI-8842:** But you don't?\n\n**Dr. Erende:** I will not lie and say that I do not see the opportunities SCP-7042 could provide, but that is all I see. Opportunity.\n\n**PoI-8842:** Some would say that's just another way to say 'good luck.' But come on, tell me why you actually wanted to come to talk to me. Cause if it was to \"control\" what the sketchbook makes, I got bad news. The final product, whatever it might be, it's always up to her.\n\n**Dr. Erende:** What if it stops writing?\n\n**PoI-8842:** That means you've gone and made her upset. She'll come around, but I'd be cautious. Mischievous is just one step from devious. It might take a while for things to smooth over, but if you want, Doc, maybe I can be of some actual help. I can talk to her, convince her you messed up, that she'll be running the show the way she wants to from now on. \n\n **Dr. Erende:** No.\n\n//Dr. Erende stands up, heading for the door.//\n\n**PoI-8842:** Feh, don't come crying to me when you realize that trying to dictate Nature never goes the way Humans want it to. Though, I feel you should be well aware of not repeating that mistake, eh?\n\n//Dr. Erende stops, turning around.//\n\n **Dr. Erende:** Me?\n\n//Two guards move past him, grasping PoI-8842 on both arms//\n\n**PoI-8842:** Give me a sec, Gents. Not claiming to know about your personal failings, Doc. Just those of the Foundation. Turn every leaf you like. You'll never be able to undo some of the things you people have done. Entire peoples, entire species, wiped out due to your actions, your inaction!\n\n//PoI-8842 surges against his bonds, lunging for Dr. Erende//\n\n**PoI-8842:** I remember what you took away! But you can make it right! You have the key. You just need to take the chance. She is good luck. She is. She has to be. She never did wrong by me, long as I did right be her! Just treat her right, you hear me?! You treat her right! She is us, and we are her!\n\n//PoI-8842 begins ferally snarling for several moments after this before being forcibly sedated//\n\n**<End Log, 6:40>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Under Dr. Erende's orders, PoI-8842's cell was searched, and several pieces of paper covered in rambling writing were discovered and are documented below.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:doc-transcript-swapper start=--\n|image= Rambling.png\n|totrans= Show Transcribed Document\n|toimage= Show Original Document]]\nNot a day goes by I do not thank her.\n\nShe has many Faces.

Initially, all D-Class personnel and Researchers that had used SCP-7042 do not appear to be under the effects of a cognitohazard.

These tests were performed solely by Dr. Erende in an attempt to forge a bond with SCP-7042 that would turn it toward the Foundation's aims. This testing series led to a number of instances being created that hemmed closely to what Dr. Erende asked for.\n\n= **Addendum 7042-5: Testing Logs II**\n----\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nSCP-7042 Test A15\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nDr. Erende\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProtocol\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nDr. Erende's tests attempt to study the limits of SCP-7042's ability, starting with whether it can produce life forms using terminology not tied to fauna.

The instance was a rusty-colored amphibian with a body plan analogous to //Kaprosuchus saharicus// [[footnote]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprosuchus Kaprosuchus][[/footnote]] that showed a great deal of aggression towards Dr. Erende. Genetic testing discovered that the entity had a basal connection to microbial life discovered on the surface of Mars. It is uncertain if the instance is an example of prehistoric or futuristic life.

I was originally skeptical of my colleague's insistence that the object could prove to be a boon for conservation efforts. Still, it appears I must accept a helping of humble pie. I've even heard rumblings across Site-84 that they desire to see the object's class changed to Thaumiel and to shift part of our directives and those of Biological Research Site-104 to the long-term conservation of nonanomalous endangered species, citing the Foundation's purpose to \"Protect.\" She's apparently been reaching out to staff at Site-44 as well, seeking further backers for this ploy.

Falling from the tree, the instances were shown to have grown a foot taller, had increased claw length, and oversized canines. Security Staff intervened, but the staff member was maimed, losing their right arm in the process, and two of the instances, had to be put down with lethal force after refusing to release the staff member.

FOR US!\n\n**<End Log, 13:26>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Erende immediately submitted himself for a cognitohazard screening following the conversation. SCP-7042 was found to have latent cognitohazardous abilities. Initial testing was found to have been faulty. During periods of dormancy, the influences recede to a point where it appears the afflicted are still acting in their normal functioning states. Furthermore, the cognitohazard only affects individuals whose careers involve the care, breeding, and conservation of animals of any kind. SCP-7042 will shift their perceptions to consider it an object of providence and form a protective, pseudo-familial bond with the object the longer it remains in their possession. At the moment, it is not known if the SCP is aware of its influence or if it is a latent property of the object. If several individuals are infected, they will seek each other out, grouping together into a cult-like organization whose goal is to learn more about SCP-7042 and how to control her powers in the name of conservation, experimentation, and revitalization. The beginning of said occurrence was found within the staff of Site-84, using the pseudonym Gaia's Forty-Two, under the purview of Dr. Waller. All afflicted staff were administered Class C Amnestics, though Dr. Waller is currently under close administrative observation after speaking to the on-site therapist about a sourceless feeling of loss. Site-84's Director has suspended all testing with SCP-7042. SCP-7042 has been sequestered in the Archives. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7041]]] | SCP-7042 | [[[SCP-7043]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** HoG.2\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/52228635424/in/dateposted-public/ Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** SCP.1\n> **Author:** Lucas VerBeek\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/196078346@N05/52228363056/in/dateposted-public/ Flickr]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
