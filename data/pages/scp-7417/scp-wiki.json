Request for entertainment amenities such as books, board games, or video games is to be approved, with supervision from her current research head(s), presently --Dr. Sebastian Lennox and-- Dr. Windsor Gladwyn.\n----\n**Description:** SCP-7417 is the designation given to Kristen Claudia, a white human adolescent female of British descent, currently 166 centimeters in height and possessing green eyes and long brown hair. Prior to containment, SCP-7417 was employed as a local kindergarten school teacher in Newcastle, Northern Ireland.\n\nSCP-7417 possesses a unique form of functional precognition where, upon visually perceiving any object (including living entities), she is capable of viewing their physical appearance as how they are approximately one (1) year later. For example, upon looking at an apple (red delicious variant), SCP-7417 reported seeing it as merely being a pile of assorted fertilized soil.\n\nTesting on how of it's possible to alter the \"fate\" of perceived objects is still ongoing.\n----\n**Addendum 7417-1:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log**\n\n**Date:** 12/09/2018\n**Present:** Dr. Sebastian Lennox\n----\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n//Dr. Lennox enters the interview room.//\n\n**Dr. Lennox:** Hello, 7417.
