  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-8887\n\n**Object Class:** Uncontained\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Both SCP-8887 and SCP-8887-1 are currently uncontained, due to a lack of understanding of the mechanics behind the anomaly. In an attempt to locate the anomaly, Foundation Dream Monitoring Technology is to continue being utilized to monitor the dreams of Researcher Valentina Gonzalez. Researcher Gonzalez is to continue her efforts to record her dreams in as much detail as possible. Research efforts to identify SCP-8887-1 are still ongoing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8887 is an anomalous pocket dimension, colloquially called 'Dreamspace'. SCP-8887 is a non-topological dimension, consisting of predominantly an unknown anomalous substance. These materials have no known chemical comparisons, nor can they be identified based on any techniques currently known to the Foundation. SCP-8887 has no known limits and seems to be able to be changed and modified at will. Access to SCP-8887 is currently only poorly understood and is a major area of focus for ongoing research.\n\nSCP-8887-1 is an anomalous humanoid identity, resembling a human, exclusively seen wearing a pair of pastel sleep pants, a sleep shirt, and a sleeping cap. SCP-8887-1 seems to be able to exert anomalous control over the appearance, physics, and reality of SCP-8887. It is the current understanding of the Foundation that SCP-8887-1 represents a previously unidentified reality bender, with a currently unknown capacity for ontokinetics.\n\n**Addendum-1-Initial-Exploration:** Exploratory attempts were undergone in an attempt to identify a pattern of when SCP-8887 was able to be accessed. Exploratory attempts can only be led by Researcher Gonzalez entering REM sleep. Currently, it appears no other individuals have been able to enter SCP-8887. The conditions that determine whether or not Researcher Gonzalez is able to access SCP-8887 are not currently understood. In an attempt to determine a pattern of entry, multiple different avenues of testing (totaling >100 separate tests) have been explored. Relevant excerpts from the full testing logs have been included below.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **Exploration Attempt Logs - Relevant Excerpts** \n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #4**\n\n------\n\nI tried to enter SCP-8887 again at the same time I did last night, since I made it in last night. Today? Nothing. Maybe it's not a set pattern? I should try randomized times during the day.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #11**\n\n------\n\nWell random times are about as successful at entering SCP-8887 as trying the same time over and over again. Maybe it's tied to a standard human sleep cycle?\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #15**\n\n------\n\nI'm giving up on it being tied to anything human, the sleep cycles just don't match up. Sometimes I can access SCP-8887, but other times it's like there's a brick wall stopping me.\n\nSupervising Researcher Chan says he has an idea of what to try next - his guess is as good as mine.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #27**\n\n------\n\nTurns out Supervising Researcher Chan's guess was worse than mine. I'm exhausted. He decided that we should test in 15 minute intervals every night, every hour, for the entire night. Chan thinks that the window of access is tied to when the sun is down, so between dusk and dawn, all I do is test. It's been over a week of this, and it's just as successful as my testing was.\n\nThe worst part is that if I don't make it into SCP-8887, they wake me up. If I make it into SCP-8887, they wake me up. Chan says that we're focused on 'identifying the access mechanics' and doesn't seem to want to explore the anomaly yet. He suggested we try and get other researchers who can take some of the workload. Problem is, nobody else seems to be able to enter the dream, so it's just me.\n\nI haven't slept more than 5 minutes, 4 times an hour, in over a week. Even Foundation stimulants can't keep me running like this much longer.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #28**\n\n------\n\nWell I was right.\n\nNot about the anomaly, but about me not being able to keep doing this. Even after taking my dosage and having an espresso, I fell asleep on my couch at home, in the middle of the day.\n\nAnd I woke up in SCP-8887.\n\nNobody was observing me since it was an accidental exploration, but still! This is definite progress!\n\nAt least we know that Supervising Researcher Chan's theory was wrong. He's not going to be happy about that, but I'm excited to actually get a good night's rest from now on.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #41**\n\n------\n\nWe've been trying random times throughout the day, clustered around where we've had success entering SCP-8887 before. It's not working. I don't think it's consistent at all, I feel like it has to be random!\n\nBut this is the Foundation, so there has to be a pattern. Right? Maybe a specialist can figure it out - note to self, reach out to AIAD or Applied Statistics to see if they have anything that could help us figure this out.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Attempt #87**\n\n------\n\nI keep writing these logs every time I try and enter SCP-8887. Over 80% of our attempts end in failure, no matter what we try.\n\nWe asked a couple of different AICs to analyze the attempt history to try and identify a pattern. One came back and said that it was tied to the shifts of power balance in an anomalous war in the Wanderer's Library. How we would track that, I have no idea. Another came back and said that there was no pattern, but if you changed the times to notes, it played a discordant melody.\n\nI think when we make something to find a pattern, it's going to find a pattern.\n\nSo we asked some thaumaturges if they had any idea; no clue. We checked with friendly reality benders to see if they could detect anything. All they could tell us was that there was definitely an anomaly, sometimes.\n\nWe asked Metaphysics, Replication Studies, Surrealistics, all came back with the same answer of not knowing what the pattern was.\n\nFuck, we even asked Pataphysics! You know what they said? Here, I'll fucking quote it.\n\n//Hi Researcher Gonzalez,//\n\n//We took a look at the logs for SCP-8887, and have determined that there is a significant pattern that we have 99% confidence in. It appears to us, that the authors are just fucking with you.//\n\nI'm done. I'm convinced that there is no pattern, it'll just be the luck of the draw for if I wake up in there or not.\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Log #113**\n\n------\n\nI can't believe I'm **still writing logs**. Chan decided that the other departments didn't know anything and we should keep trying with his new theories.\n\nEvery day, a new theory of how he was right about this all along.\n\nI'm trying to appeal this to the site council - maybe I could argue this is a pointless waste of resources?\n\n------\n\n= **Exploration Log #114**\n\n------\n\nToday is the last attempt at 'finding a pattern'. The council came back and told us to just 'give up'.\n\nChan had just //one// more idea. Guess what? It didn't work. I'm so glad we're done with this and I can actually start trying to explore SCP-8887 more.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing Exploration Attempt #114, all further exploratory testing to determine a pattern was halted. It is assumed that any pattern is indeterminate given our current understanding of the anomaly, and research is to focus on expanded exploration of SCP-8887.\n\nTo that end, Temporary Research Site-8887-BR has been established within Researcher Gonzalez's apartment unit. Temporary equipment used to capture video log 1 was replaced with state of the art Foundation Dream Monitoring and Recording Technology(**DreaRy**), to enable the capture of what Researcher Gonzalez is visually perceiving while asleep. Testing is to continue with Researcher Gonzalez as the only individual entering SCP-8887.\n\n**Addendum-2-Exploration Logs**\n\nUnder continued Foundation supervision, Researcher Gonzalez began recording each attempt she made to enter SCP-8887. The excepts included below highlight the most relevant information gathered from the videos - contact project administrators for access to the other logs.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG 2** \n----\n**DATE:** 05/20/2023\n\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n-----\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez is on a pastel-colored beach. Fish are swimming in the air above the water. Researcher Gonzalez looks up to the sky.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I can't believe how beautiful this is. How long can I just... sit here?\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez remains seated on the sand for several minutes before standing up. She walks down to the water line but hesitates before going in. We are able to see Researcher Gonzalez on the feed, captured through her reflection.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** If somebody in the Foundation is watching all of these, you should know that I was sitting down to, uhhh, better acclimate to the environs. Yeah, that's good. But right, I'm actually here for a reason today. Your goal is to find SCP-8887-1, Valentina. \n\n//Researcher Gonzalez begins to walk across the beach. Distantly, a figure can be seen.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Is that? Did I really just find it?\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez squints. The pink sun bounces off of the auburn sands, a glare obscuring her view. She begins to move towards the figure. After some time, Researcher Gonzalez is able to positively identify the figure as SCP-8887-1. SCP-8887-1 turns its head in surprise, gasping. It stands up, beginning to run.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Wait!\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez begins to sprint after SCP-8887-1. The sand slowly gives away to the stone and grass, the ecosystems shifting along a nonsensical pattern. Eventually, the two are no longer on the beach. They have entered the periwinkle field.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Please! I don't want to hurt you!\n\n//SCP-8887-1 stops, summoning a large crescent-moon-shaped shield.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** What do you want then?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** We don't need to bring weapons into this - I'm not trying to attack you. I do have to say though, that shield looks pretty cool. How did you make it?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Um, thank you? I just-\n\n//SCP-8887-1 shakes its head.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Whatever! I didn't create you, you don't belong here.  Who are you?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Create me? Are you saying that you created this?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Of course I did. I can control anything I want in here- so I made this. It's aesthetically perfect, and without ailments, pain, or anything else that comes with being human. But I made this place so that I could be alone. Not to share it with... strangers.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Being alone must suck. Don't you get bored?\n\n//SCP-8887-1 scoffs.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** You wouldn't get it. It's not about boredom or having nothing to do, it's about peace. I want to be at peace here. I get to control everything so that I can finally relax. But, I can't be at peace with you bothering me.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I'm not trying to bother you - I'm not really sure how I keep ending up here. But what you've made is really breathtaking.\n\n//The shield SCP-8887-1 is holding de-manifests. A blush appears on SCP-8887-1's cheeks.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Thanks. I've always liked fish. But I've never been able to take care of any pets.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Are... are you human?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Not as long as I'm here. I'm whatever I want to be. \n\n//SCP-8887-1 yawns.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Nothing good can last I guess. I can feel it coming, I can't stop it. \n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Feel what coming? I’m sure you can stop whatever it is. \n\n**SCP-8887-1:** It doesn't matter. And no, I can’t. I’ve tried. \n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Have you asked anyone to help you? \n\n//SCP-8887-1 yawns again.// \n\n**SCP-8887-1:** It’s pointless. No one can help me. I just… I wish I could stay in my dreams.\n\n\n\n//The feed suddenly cuts to black.//\n\n------\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAt the moment that the feed was cut, Researcher Gonzalez did not wake up immediately as with previous testing, instead remaining asleep for another 5 hours. At the end of her slumber, Gonzalez was questioned about what happened once the feed cut out.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **POST-CONSCIOUSNESS DEBRIEF**\n----\n**DATE:** 05/20/2023\n\n**NOTE:** Irrelevant information has been removed, the relevant except is below.\n----\n\n[BEGIN Interview]\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I mean yeah, I didn't feel like I was in danger when talking with her.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** By her, you mean SCP-8887-1, correct?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Correct. Sorry, it's tough to keep my thoughts straight after coming out.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** I understand, but I expect more professionalism from you. Tell me what happened at the end; the feed cut out on the monitor. What happened next?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Right - so I was talking with SCP-8887-1 when she said that she could feel it coming. Right after she said that, in a blink, everything went black.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** And then you passed out and lost consciousness?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** No. That's just it. It didn't end for me.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Are you sure you didn't pass out?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Yeah, I'm sure.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** //Researcher Gonzalez was unable to determine whether or not they lost consciousness.// So you were able to stay in SCP-8887 without SCP-8887-1?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Are you listening to anything I'm saying? I said it went black. It did. Everything just disappeared, in an instant. I couldn't feel anything, my body was gone. I couldn't see, smell or taste anything. It was like my consciousness was just floating in a dark void, with nothing tethering me to reality.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Okay, and then what happened in this 'void' you //experienced?//\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez pauses to take a large yawn - she seems abnormally tired.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Nothing.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Nothing? How insightful of you.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Seriously? It was just nothingness. It felt like hours, almost a full day even, but I had no sense of time in there. It was just me, my thoughts, and nothing else. And then I woke up. How long was I out for?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** You slept for 5 hours post losing the feed.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Really? I feel so tired. Like I could go right back to sleep. The hours in there, just stuck by myself; I think I'm more tired than I was before I fell asleep.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Perhaps we further explore allowing other individuals to attempt to enter SCP-8887? I already have proposals drafte-\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I can do this. We don't need to bring more people in.\n\n-----\n\n[END OF EXCERPT]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter the debrief, under the advisement of Supervising Researcher Chan, testing was suspended due to suspicions that Researcher Gonzalez had been exposed to an anomalous influence as a result of prolonged exposure to SCP-8887. After testing failed to identify any long-term anomalous effects on Researcher Gonzalez, testing was authorized to continue. Extraneous logs have been omitted from the document.\n\nThe next relevant log occurred within a week of resuming testing.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG 5** \n----\n**DATE:** 05/29/2023\n\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n-----\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez is inside of a pink structure.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Huh? Where am I? This is... unfamiliar.\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez looks around.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** How do... how do I get out of here?\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez begins to walk through the structure, wandering between non-descript walkways for several minutes. Researcher Gonzalez pauses, appearing to hear something. No noise was identified on Foundation Dream Imaging feeds. Out of nowhere, the ground starts to shake, shifting and crumbling beneath her.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Ahh!\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez attempts to keep herself stable, but her ankle twists and she falls to the ground. The floor has split apart fully now, craning further and further open. Research Gonzalez begins to slide, falling down further and further. Looking down, she can see the open sky and a cloud below. Researcher Gonzalez screams again, as the last remnant of the structure slips out of their fingers.//\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez drops, hurtling towards the cloud. They collide with it - but instead of continuing through, they are instead cushioned by the softness of the cloud.  A disoriented Gonzalez looks around before spotting SCP-8887-1 sitting on a floating cloud beside hers. SCP-8887-1 yawns and then waves at Researcher Gonzalez.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** These structures can be a bit unstable sometimes. They were made to vibe with me, so I think it was trying to come see where I was. I guess they're not really used to strangers yet.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Oh um, thank you then. For saving me.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** It-It was just the right thing to do! You haven't done anything to me yet. You seemed almost... curious the last time I watched you. But I don't think it would have mattered though, it's just a dream.\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez begins to panic, realizing that SCP-8887-1 does not face the threat of mortality in SCP-8887 as she does. She takes a breath and tries to center herself to not show fear.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** O-Oh. You saw that, huh? I was just wondering how many types of fish were down there. But I'm glad that you're starting to trust me. Believe it or not, I was just as confused as you were when we first met. I'd never seen anybody else here.\n\n//SCP-8887-1 is silent for approximately four minutes. During this time, Researcher Gonzalez does not move to speak, instead observing the sky around them.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Sorry for pushing you away back then. It's just well, I mean, I've been alone my whole life. Spending time with others is a rarity for me; now I'm used to being alone. \n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Speaking frankly, I can't disagree. People don't really care about me at work, I'm barely still in contact with my family, I don't go anywhere other than work and home. You're the first person I've met in months, maybe a year? This is by far the most exciting thing to happen to me in a long time.\n\n//SCP-8887-1 laughs.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Glad I can give you some variety. As for me, I mean... I'm still learning to trust other people. I don't even trust you yet. I'm just being nice to you because you were nice to me.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Nah, I don't buy it.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** You don't buy what?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** You definitely trust me. At least a little bit.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** What are you talking about? Why would I trust you?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I'll be honest again; I don't really know, I guess I was just saying that. Sorry, guess it's been long enough that I don't remember how to talk to people.\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez pauses.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Would you show me around?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Why should I?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** It'll be good for both of us. You can learn to trust others more, and I can remember how to be a person with strangers! Come on, don't you think it would be fun?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I don't know, you've probably seen most of it by now. It's not really distinct, it's mostly just the same repetitive thing over and over.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Okay, well, what if you introduced me to the fish? Do you have an aquarium around here?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** They don't have names. And no. They're free to roam, coming and going as they please. Even if I can't, they can.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hit a sensitive topic. I was just trying to think of things we could do.\n\n//Both figures sit on their respective clouds in silence, as their clouds begin drifting to the ground. As they approach, nearing close to the ground, both clouds de-manifest, dropping SCP-8887-1 and Researcher Gonzalez into the periwinkle field.

After that, you get to learn about me.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Hm. Fine.\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez sits next to SCP-8887-1. SCP-8887-1 looks like it might shift further away, but they pause for a second and then don't.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** What to share. Hmmm. I like... cats.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I do too.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I have a cat. His name is Muffin.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Why did you name him Muffin?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Oh that? It's because he's just a chunky little muffin man!\n\n//SCP-8887-1 laughs.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I don't have any pets. But I save a lot of pictures of cat memes.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Meme cats? You mean like, I can haz cheeseburger?\n\n//SCP-8887-1 rolls its eyes.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Not like those, ugh. More like, do you know the one cat in the grape suit. And the picture of the one stealing the chicken wing making the weird face. You know, kind of like this!\n\n//SCP-8887-1 sticks its tongue out and scrunches its eyes. Research Gonzalez laughs.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I... I don't think I've seen those ones before.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Jesus, really? I mean, you don't look that old, but are you secretly a grandma? When did you get your first cellphone?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Hey! I'm only thirty. I'm just so busy with work that I don't really have the time to casually scroll through social media.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Well if it keeps you so busy, tell me about it! Where do you work?\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez pauses, hesitating while they consider their reply.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I do research. In a laboratory.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Oh. I always found science pretty boring. What do you do at the lab, are you a doctor or what? Should I be calling you Dr. Valentina?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I'm just a researcher, you can just call me Valentina. Anyways, I'm sure the details of what I do there would bore you. It's pretty boring to me too.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** That's fine, I don't really care about science anyways. But you still owe me another answer. Oh, okay, yeah! What's your favorite aesthetic?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I've... never thought much about it. I guess I like blue?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** That's not an aesthetic! That's a color! I'm talking dreamcore, webcore, yume kawaii, kidcore, cottagecore! So which do you like best? For some reason, and I have no idea why, but you're stuck in my dreams. What if you were like me though, if you could make your own. What would it look like?\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez visibly reacts to SCP-8887-1's admission that SCP-8887 is directly related to their dreams. They stutter, unsure of what to say.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I... I don't know. I've never thought about it that much I guess.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** You're telling me you've never dreamed of an escape from your life? A place to get away from everything that's ever bothered you? You haven't had those times where all you wanted was to just escape someplace magical and stop feeling... everything? Sleep is the only place I can get away from the pain. And it's never here for long enough.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** When you put it like that, I'll admit... it would be nice. To have an escape like this. To just... be free for a little bit.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Maybe that's why you're here. To escape. \n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Maybe.\n\n------\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nResearcher Gonzalez slept for four more hours after exiting SCP-8887, then awoke in their apartment. \n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG 11** \n----\n**DATE:** 06/14/2023\n\n**NOTE:** At this point, Researcher Gonzalez had established significant trust between themselves and SCP-8887-1.

How long did it take you to change this?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Not that long, I just changed it before you showed up! You told me that you liked cats, and I like cats, and if you're going to keep showing up here, I figured I'd make something for the both of us. I know you can't access your own dream world, so I wanted to make some parts of mine that we could share.\n\n//Researcher Gonzalez pulls her hand to her chest - the same one that is holding SCP-8887-1's hand. SCP-8887-1 is pulled towards Researcher Gonzalez, leaning away in fear at first, before relaxing. SCP-8887-1 blushes as they are pulled together. Researcher Gonzalez does not notice, continuing to stare at the clouds.//\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** That's so sweet, Dreamy. I haven't been given a gift in a really long time. It's beautiful. And adorable. Like... really cute! I wish I had my phone to take a picture!\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I know right? Now about that cat meme! So it's this group of cats, that are all in a kitchen, and the text reads, 'The council will now decide your fate'. I laughed about that for a while. At least, until I got too tired to keep feeling happy.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Right. Is that like... a thing kids are saying these days?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I think I've heard it before. Tell me about Muffin! How is he? Is he sleeping with you right now?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Unfortunately not right now. Sometimes I have to shut my door at night, or else he'll knock everything off my shelves and I won't get any rest.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Oh yikes, that sounds annoying. I'm used to sleeping through disruptions anyway, so honestly, I think I could put up with it. Nothing can really wake me up anymore. I just kind of... wake up when I wake up.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:**  I think an animal could be good for you. You seem to like them.

I'm joking, but, you'll never know if you don't try. I'm sure there are a lot of things you're capable of that you haven't given yourself a chance to succeed at.\n\n//SCP-8887-1 frowns, looking away from Researcher Gonzalez.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** You don't know what my life is like.  A chance to succeed? I don't even get the chance to try! There is //so// much that limits me in the real world. At least here, even if I'm forced to be here so often, then I better make the most out of it.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Forced to be here? Dreamy, is somebody hurting or threatening you?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** No, it's not that. Nobody is making me sleep. Nobody except for myself... I don't tell a lot of people this, but I think I trust you, so I want to tell you this. I have to sleep a lot because-\n\n//SCP-8887-1 cuts itself off.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** I-In the distance.

Both Agent Zane and Researcher Gonzalez were reprimanded for their conduct; Zane was put on disciplinary leave for falling asleep while on duty, and Researcher Gonzalez was suspended for a week and removed from the SCP-8887 research project.\n\n**Addendum-2-Internal-Memorandum:** In the wake of changes following Video Log 11, Supervising Researcher Chan sent an email to all remaining members of the research team. The memorandum, detailing the changes in containment strategy, is included below:\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** SCP-8887 Research Team\n**From:** Supervising Researcher Chan\n**Subject:** Updated Procedures Regarding SCP-8887\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello team,\n\nBy now I assume that you have all been informed regarding the incident that occurred last week resulting in the removal of Researcher Gonzalez from the project. I understand that there is some discontentment regarding this, however, I would like to remind you all that Researcher Gonzalez allowed themselves to become compromised by this anomaly.\n\nResearcher Gonzalez failed to maintain an unbiased perspective and further failed to report additional instances of her entering SCP-8887 between planned testing dates. This failure to maintain the chain of communication resulting in a potential danger to two Foundation personnel, as well as exposing the Foundation to SCP-8887-1.\n\nAs a result, I have taken over full control of the project with authorization from Site Command, and have drafted the following updates to testing procedures to ensure that there are no additional mistakes made while we try and locate SCP-8887-1.\n\n# Any instances of entering SCP-8887 are to be reported immediately to myself, or the supervisor on duty. Any personnel found failing to convey this information are to be removed from the team.\n# Testing is to be carried out daily by a rotating selection of Researchers and MTF Agents; teams are to, if possible, create a Foundation base within SCP-8887, to better organize our efforts in the future. Due to SCP-8887-1's assumed omniscience within the realm, Foundation specialists are attempting to develop cloaking technology that can operate within a dreamscape.\n# During testing, there must be at least two individuals observing the monitors showing the video feed. Under **no** circumstances can any personnel enter SCP-8887 without prior authorization (that means no napping on the job, got it?)\n# Researcher Valentina Gonzalez is to **not** be informed of any of these changes or any discoveries made by the research team. Any individuals found doing so are to be removed from the team and reassigned to the worst duty I can find.\n# **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES** are any personnel to communicate with SCP-8887-1.\n\nIt is the current belief of the research leadership that SCP-8887-1 is an unknown reality bender with a large ontokinetic potential. We believe that SCP-8887-1 has the ability to exert the same reality-warping control over baseline reality that they demonstrate within SCP-8887. It is of utmost importance that under no circumstances is SCP-8887-1 to be told about its abilities, for fear of what could happen. Current models show that if SCP-8887-1 were to realize its powers and begin manipulating baseline reality, within 72 hours there would be a ZK-Class End of Reality Scenario. Thankfully, I have devised a theory for how to contain SCP-8887-1 - it appears that its power comes from sleeping and dreaming. If we were to contain the anomaly in such a way that we prevent it from sleeping, I believe that SCP-8887-1 would lose all reality bending capabilities.\n\nAs such, our current research priorities are to identify SCP-8887-1 in the real world, by gathering any identifying information that may be present in SCP-8887. It is critical that the Foundation capture and contain SCP-8887-1 before it is able to do any damage to reality. Any and all information learned regarding SCP-8887-1's whereabouts are to be reported directly to me.\n\nI expect that there will be no problems with any of the above, and new testing procedures will be followed to the letter. We almost lost control of this, and I am going to make sure it does not happen again.\n\n- Supervising Researcher Chan\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n\n**Addendum-3-Personal Notes:** Despite her removal from the project, due to the proximity of her apartment to the presumed spatial boundaries of access to SCP-8887, Researcher Valentina Gonzalez continued to maintain a dream journal and her private notes on the anomaly. Below are relevant excerpts detailing Researcher Gonzalez's continued efforts to contact SCP-8887-1 against Foundation orders.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Dream Diary Transcript #3**\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN EXCERPT]\n\nI can't believe they took me off of the project. Zane fucks up, and suddenly I'm the one being punished and pushed out? They told me that I had to quit testing or trying to enter SCP-8887. Maybe they don't understand that yet, but I'm //not trying// to enter SCP-8887, I can't avoid it!\n\nI've been trying to stop going back, but every time I fall asleep, I keep finding myself back there. I need to keep sense of all of this, so I'm writing it all down again. My sleep schedule has been even more erratic than normal. It was bad during the testing and, if anything, being suspended has made it worse.\n\nI've just been in the periwinkle fields.\n\nWatching the fish swim by in the sky. They seem to like the clouds. The clouds aren't cats anymore.\n\nI guess Dreamy changed that back.\n\nI found a beach next to one of the fields. It was peaceful. \n\nI haven't seen her since the incident. Since they kicked me off of the project.\n\nShe said this is her dream world. One she created to be at peace in. An escape. She asked me what my dream world would look like.\n\nI still don't know.\n\n[END EXCERPT]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Dream Diary Transcript #4**\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN EXCERPT]\n\nI think figured it out. Figured it all out.\n\nIt sounds like a joke, but it started with a dream. Well, not just a dream, but SCP-8887. I can't seem to have any dreams if they're not in SCP-8887 anymore.\n\nI was in the fields again. Walking through the grass, feeling it brush across my legs as if I was really there. And that's because I was. I walked, and I walked, and I walked. The world drifted around me, and all of a sudden, I found myself walking in the middle of the shape-structures. I don't remember walking here, or the world changing around me, but that's where I was.\n\nBack in the tunnels, just like that first time I saw Dreamy. By the end of it, I found myself in that hallway again. That strange, familiar, dream of a hallway. And again, facing me down, all the way at the end of the hallway, there was a door.\n\nI put my hand on the knob. It feels cold under my touch. I twist it, gripping it in my hand tight, terrified of letting go and the dream disappearing. But then I'm back in my apartment, and I'm awake.\n\nSomething is tugging at me - I need to go outside. I need to leave my apartment, something is telling me to just... get out of here.\n\nSo I do. I get dressed, washed up and ready to leave, rushing to keep the feeling from the dream with me. I rush out of my apartment into the hallway and I'm struck by something for the first time. The hallway in my apartment matched the one from my dream. Exactly, down to the carpet.\n\nI get knocked out of my daze when a door opens, and a girl comes out of her apartment. I think I've seen her maybe once or twice before in the building, but she seems strangely familiar to me. I don't know her name, or anything about her really. She's carrying a load of laundry, struggling to carry it with her. She looks exhausted. I follow my instincts; I offer to help her.\n\n\"No. I'm fine. Thank you though.\" \n\nBut that voice.\n\nI recognized that voice. The facial structure is the same, she's the same height, exact same pale skin tone. The same way of carrying herself - gracefully, but in a perpetual state of exhaustion.\n\nHow didn't I realize it sooner?\n\nI apologize for bothering her, and head back into my apartment.\n\nI think she's SCP-8887-1. I think I just met Dreamy, again.\n\nShe has to be.\n\n[END EXCERPT]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nAt the time of discovery of these documents, the events of incident SCP-8887-I had already occurred.
