These elements are both featured on the shield. The background of the shield further enhances the chess theme. As a supporter I have chosen a white knight, or a white guard one could say.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** The knight/guard supporter has a helmet. Up until yesterday I had this one planned out with a different, harder to realise prompt. But then I decided it was a good idea to swap those around and leave the more difficult prompt to something else.\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-14-tick| Day 14: Tick]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-16-compass| Day 16: Compass]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** WhiteGuard.png\n> **Name:** WhiteGuard\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nWhiteGuard.png is a composite.
