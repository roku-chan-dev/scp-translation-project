Hansarp, was pulled from the Menagerie's upcoming exhibition. Following its removal, the general public at-large condemned the move; as the largest Mekhanite civil rights group in the Linuxsphere, the Mekhanite Self-Advocacy Network was thus obligated to respond to the event in question.\n\nThe MSAN has reviewed the case at large, and has come to the following conclusion:\n\nThis email is to inform you that you have been nominated for condemnation by the MSAN, following the arbitrary censorship of Mxr. Hansarp's act of self-expression. The MSAN accepts that //I Heart My Prophet//'s core content might have been risque; however, it is the opinion of the MSAN the performance itself would be no more obscene than pieces such as //Quin preu és la virtut?// and //The Book of Tamlin//, both of which had been exhibited in the past by the Menagerie. It is therefore the conclusion of the MSAN that the removal of Mxr. Hansarp's piece was motivated primarily by mekhanophobic intentions.\n\nShould you choose to reinstate //I Heart My Prophet// in the exhibition itinerary, condemnation proceedings will cease. It is the opinion of Reverend Technician Pandora Ellis that this is the preferred option in regards to the financial future of the Menagerie.\n\nWe hope to hear from you soon.\n\n[[>]]\n//Reverend Technician Pandora Ellis//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[size 125%]]\n{{To whom it may concern,}}\n@@@@\n{{On behalf of the SoHo Temple Ironworks, we strongly condemn your inclusion of one Mxr.

Do you?\n\nGet me out of this //now//.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**From:** nobodysacritic@torchmail.drk\n**To:** curatorthe@torchmail.drk\n**Subject:** Possible solution.\n**Date:** February 9th, 2018 at 14:28:59\n\nRight so, first of all sorry for trying to save the Menagerie from mediocrity. Second, I've talked a lot of people on this, so bear with me:\n\nHansarp's willing to compromise; Mekhanites hate making enemies, you know how it goes. Basically instead of using a chocolate Bumaro, he uses Fauxcolate (kosher Mekhanite \"chocolate\" made from synthetics like oil) to craft the likeness of Mekhane, then polishes off //that//. I've spoken to people from all three of the main branches, and it's completely kosher. It's even in line with the Orthodox thing about \"Divine Submission\". Whaddya say?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**From:** curatorthe@torchmail.drk\n**To:** nobodysacritic@torchmail.drk\n**Subject:** Re: Possible solution.\n**Date:** February 9th, 2018 at 14:39:59\n\nI am begging you to give me literally any other option.

The Critic might've told you about me.\n\nI heard you were looking for help regarding the mess revolving around that one Mekh's piece. Personally I thought it was hilarious, but I guess other people can't appreciate a good piece of sacrilege when they see it.\n\nI'm proposing an alternative, complete with a way out. See, I'm an up and coming artist. I'm also an unapologetic Nälkän. It would make sense that, if you were trying to promote the little guy, you'd exclude the kinds of people who wouldn't take well to xeir leanings. No harm, no foul, just... it's me or him, and he's got enough awards already.\n\nI've actually got a piece ready! It's a fleshcraft so I //do// need to feed it now and then, and I'll also probably need the +18 room you had reserved for Hansarp's, but //Ion Tames The Scarlet Archon// is sure to be a hit (don't ask me how much research I had to do on squid penises lmao)!\n\nCritic tells me you already pre-approved this, so I'll spare you the abstract. Thanks in advance! :D\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**From:** curatorthe@torchmail.drk\n**To:** nobodysacritic@torchmail.drk\n**Subject:** [no subject]\n**Date:** February 10th, 2018 at 18:55:59\n\nI give up.\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**From:** curatorthe@torchmail.drk\n**To:** nobodysacritic@torchmail.drk\n**Subject:** A message.\n**Date:** February 19th, 2018 at 23:59:00\n\nYesterday I woke up, put on my suit, and went to the show I spent weeks organizing. This show had to **__//BE//__** perfect, and I wish with all my heart there was a way to emphasize that \"be\" more. I had to have the perfect line-up, with the perfect crowd, and everything had to run absolutely perfectly.\n\nSo let's flash back to one week prior.\n\nLet me set the scene: just, say, five days prior, my mentor, the teacher I trusted most in the whole goddamn world, the //absolute authority// on East Coast anart, snuck a story into the TTTB about how I pulled a //vulgar sex act// from an itinerary //that never included it in the first place//, and somehow that was a bad thing. I became the knuckle-dragging moral panic bogeyman over fake news. For five //excruciating days//, I was the most hated man in America. It was as if Karl Marx lived in a nation of McCarthies, and he had just bombed a bus of mixed Vietnamese-Korean orphans of the incorrect latitude.\n\nI would have lived //one hundred// of those days than experience //another singular second// of the week that followed the \"\"\"re\"\"\"incorporation of Hansarp's living obscenity into my perfect show.\n\nDo you know how many people pulled out over your libelous garbage? Me neither. I stopped counting once it hit the double digits. Do you know how many pulled back in when I let myself sully my perfect show? __All of them__. One //hundred// percent. This was all they cared about. Do you know how it feels to know your star artists, your past and present peers care less about you than some cum-brained dullard?\n\nI can't even hate him. When I called him up to tell him I'd surrendered, I was finished, he didn't even care. I was not admonished, chastised, nor was I praised. He thanked me and hung up.\n\nFate wouldn't even dignify me with righteous anger.\n\nFor seven days, I didn't leave my apartment. I cried, screamed, lied perfectly still with a weight in my stomach; like something had pumped lead into my appendix until it burst. But I never left. How could I ever show my face again? I sold out. I failed you and I failed Melanie. I wasn't Cool.\n\nAs I'm typing this, I look to my fingers. These are the fingers of a fraud, a hack, a garbage human. Can I still ask, with a straight face, if I'm Cool Yet, knowing the answer will never be affirmative? When I punch the dirty bathroom mirror, am I still fighting the reflection of a man?\n\nI don't even know if I still grieve for the ideal, unblemished past that could have been. I just want to feel genuine again.\n\nSo let's get back to the not-so-distant past of yesterday. I vomited twice, thinking of the show. Only a week before, the horror of getting pasted by Mekhanite cannon fire felt so viscerally real, but now, now it wasn't even horror: it was the ideal. Every minute instant was colored by the desire to be reduced to fine cinders on the way to that rotten show. If I had disintegrated in a single, joyous second, that would have been enough.\n\nYou can't know what it felt like, walking inside. Seeing the years of my hard work, everything in perfect working order, sandwiching the absolute most attractive, most //repugnantly beautiful// depiction of the Broken God ever crafted of synthetic chocolate. You want to know what wasn't Broken, Critic? Take a guess.\n\nI'll give you a hint: //Ten. Whole. Inches//.\n\nI need to reiterate: it was //beautiful//. //Divine//. In that horrid span of time it took my brain to register the Gnosis and its glorious stick-shift, it was as if the air had been stolen from my lungs by a fey vacuum. I knew then that Hansarp had been genuine, completely and utterly genuine: this was devotion at its purest, a magnum opus fueled by love in less than a fortnight. In that brief, intoxicating wet-nightmare, even //I// wanted to drop to my knees in reverence and suck off the Broken One.\n\nCan I still call myself The Curator? I feel as a ghost, an empty imprint of a broken man blown away by a divine wind.\n\nI can't remember much between then and The Main Show. Lindholm's botany was beautiful as usual, Zapata played the violin with inhuman grace to an applause of a dozen dead tenants past, Amador and Burg's performance... perhaps in another life, it'd have roused a righteous anger in me. Now, I can only say that I was faintly amused.\n\nAnd then... then came //I Heart My Prophet//. Then came //Hansarp//.\n\nAll at once, as if a million black flies dove from the vents to skin me alive, to strip me of my muscles until only a skeleton remained, I simultaneously stood stunned in silence and, deep in the fractured recesses of my psyche, screamed with a searing, seething fury. I knew then I could stop it, tackle the wretched louse as he sauntered towards that chocolate Mekhane, stop this farce once and for all... if only my feet hadn't been weighted down by the unseen force of my compounded despair.\n\nHansarp began, and lord help me but I //watched//.\n\nSilently, for that scant eternity, I looked on in a then-unimaginable horror. By some horrid force, some horrid //farce//, my attention remained firmly on that contemptible copper twink sucking his blackened heart out, the conductor to the Menagerie's ruin. His technique was impeccable, Critic. Take solace knowing that my ruin was performed with skill.\n\nThen, Hansarp went off script.\n\nI hesitate to recall the specifics; the imprint left in my mind is one of pathos, of the shapes and colors of Hansarp blending with Mekhane, who looked to be moving in time with its partner. \"You had to be there\". I wish you were, instead of I.\n\nWhen, finally, Hansarp took his bow, I checked my watch to find that my mental clock had been frozen in time, two hours short of the one on my wrist. I rubbed my eyes, and only then did I realize I had begun to cry at some indistinct point in the painfully recent past. Of beauty? Of sorrow? Of sheer existential despair? I don't think I care to know.\n\nDid you know I forgot to disinvite Kivelä? Me neither. I have nothing to say of xeir piece: the effigy of Ion, deep in the effigy of the Scarlet King, might have once moved me, towards disgust or awe.\n\nThe Menagerie made bank and everyone loved it.\n\nFuck you.\n\n-//The Curator//\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Uncle Nicolini and UraniumEmpire]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
