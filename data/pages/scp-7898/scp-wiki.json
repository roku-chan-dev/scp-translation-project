Upper atrium windows of SCP-7898’s containment are to be uncovered for a minimum of 5 hours per day, adjusted on overcast days to provide SCP-7898 sufficient sunlight. Atrium windows are to be covered and the containment area filled with aerosol sedative during Blood Sun cycles. Any new instances of SCP-7898 and SCP-7898-1 are to be incinerated. The town of Fields Spring has been demolished and its existence expunged from public record.\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://i.imgur.com/eY8nGjV.png | caption=SCP-7898-1 instance while dormant]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7898 is an arachnoid parasitic creature that inhabits human bodies for locomotive and reproductive purposes. SCP-7898 nest in dark, dry, enclosed spaces, most commonly inside the walls and crawlspaces of houses, and subsist on sunlight [[footnote]] Non-predatory UV light [[/footnote]] in a process similar to photosynthesis. \n\nSCP-7898-1 instances are the full human bodies used by SCP-7898 for locomotion. SCP-7898-1 instances retain the ability to move and speak similarly to non-anomalous humans, but lack many bodily functions including eating, drinking, and waste expulsion. SCP-7898-1 instances also seem incapable of experiencing or expressing negative emotions, even in response to physical pain or megadental events. \n\nSCP-7898 themselves measure between 15-25cm in length and typically weigh between 4-6kg [[footnote]] Non-sentient kilograms [[/footnote]], depending on the age of the host, with six legs visually similar to a spider [[footnote]] Observers specifically mentioned similarities to the non-anomalous horseeater spider [[/footnote]]. While any of SCP-7898’s original sensory organs are not visible outside the carapace, observation suggests that SCP-7898 navigates using smell and hearing when not attached to an SCP-7898-1 instance. \n\nSCP-7898 was originally discovered in the town of Fields Spring[[footnote]] Located in the area formerly West Virginia [[/footnote]]. There were no survivors.\n _\n\n**Addendum 1 - Life Cycle of SCP-7898**\n\nBased on discoveries from both Field Springs and Foundation experimentation, the observed life cycle of SCP-7898 is as follows. \n\n**Phase 1:** A mature instance of SCP-7898 will hide within the hollow walls of a building, most frequently a house, where it waits for a suitable host.\n\n**Phase 2:** The instance will break through the drywall from within, grab the head of the host, and use a sharp appendage to implant an egg in the host's ear.\n\n**Phase 3:** The host experiences mental fog, manic episodes, head/neck pain, and neck muscle weakness.\n\n**Phase 4:** The host feels compelled to keep their head inside small, dark places, such as under blankets or in containers.\n\n**Phase 5:** The host will force their own head through a wall, life signs cease.\n\n**Phase 6:** The host's head rips off at the neck and arachnoid appendages of a fully mature SCP-7898 instance emerge from the mouth, ears, and throat.\n _\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://i.imgur.com/5NhrdXG.jpg | caption=SCP-7898 instance]]\n**Experiment Log**\n\n|| **Experiment** || **Result** ||\n|| Extracting SCP-7898 egg from host after implantation || Failure, host subject experienced immediate brain death ||\n|| Denial of a suitable nesting space to a growing SCP-7898 instance || Subject attempts to break head through concrete wall, dies ||\n|| Consumption of SCP-7898-1 instance || Subject becomes severely ill and expires, SCP-7898 reclassified to Class W74 Inedible Corpse ||\n|| SCP-7898-1 instance taken outside during a Rending event || SCP-7898-1 instance increases dramatically in physical strength, infects 2 accompanying personnel before being terminated.
