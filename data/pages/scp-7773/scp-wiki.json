SCP-7773 has been active since at least 500 AD and is responsible for numerous, high-profile thefts of artworks, jewelry, items of religious and occult significance, and various other goods from then until the present day.\n\nPrior to their failed attempted burglary of Foundation Site-666, no individual entity associated with SCP-7773 had been successfully identified or detained; it is unclear if this successful record is itself anomalous or a byproduct of the group's methods of operation. \n\nNotable items illegally acquired by SCP-7773 include:\n* 120,000 toothpicks (later sold to buyers as \"Splinters of the True Cross\");\n* The Collar Bone of St. Joan of Arc (Inauthentic);\n* The Holy Prepuce, formerly belonging to Jesus Christ of Nazareth (Authentic);\n* Leonardo da Vinci's //Mona Lisa//, recovered in 1965;\n* Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar, Best Actor - //The Revenant,// recovered 2018;\n* Between 3,000 and 68,000 NFTs of --varying-- insignificant value.\n\nOn August 13th, 2022, members associated with SCP-7773 infiltrated Site-666 with the presumed aim of acquiring the //Liber Nominum//, held in the on-site reference library. This tome allegedly contains the true name of all Tarteran Entities, provided the reader rearranges the letters a bit. \n\nThe attempted heist failed when an on-site general intrusion alarm was triggered; 4 members of SCP-7773 were apprehended and detained by Site Security. \n\nNotably, during the Site lockdown, the corpse of Junior Researcher Eva Takács -- a specialist in anomalous films and visual media -- was discovered in a hallway adjacent to the library. Takács was found deceased within a thaumaturgical circle consisting of an array of seven chalk rings surrounding a pentagon of salt. The body had been significantly burned and two lacerations running parallel to the spine were noted on the individual's back. Identification was determined via a keycard recovered from nearby the victim. \n\nThe violent nature of this homicide was notable, as previous heists conducted by SCP-7773 had only resulted in negligible harm to present persons. In response, the captured entities were not exorcized initially and Detective Anthony Calmet, a notable expert in occult criminology, was assigned to investigate further.\n\n**__Addendum 7773.01:__**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@ @@\n= **{{Interview with SCP-7773-1: \"Groalf\"}}**\n-----\n//The demonic, serpentine entity sits coiled on the provided bed within the containment cell.

The best part is you can securely exchange souls, providing the underworld's first, revolutionary digital currency -- neat huh?\n\n**Calmet:** I-- wait.\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** I know, it's pretty cutting-edge stuff. We're a growth-orientated company, with room for entrance-level positions if you're interested! But the competition is sharp, lots of crypto-bros on their way to hell. \n\n**Calmet:** Aren't souls already unique? Isn't the whole premise of a soul -- and a large portion of their value for you folk -- its individuality? Something intrinsically associated with a distinct notion of 'self,' that's truly individual and distinguishable from other matter?\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** I mean, yeah. If you want to get all Cartesian about it. \n\n**Calmet:** And you're brokering the digital authentication of the soul, not the soul itself?\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Look, I-- what you gotta understand here is the potential. \n\n//SCP-7773-2 looks around the empty room, before seizing the previously half-eaten fish.//\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Take this fish, delicious right? But only //I// can have it. Now imagine it's a soul, and you want it. Well tough luck, it's mine, //unless// we figure out a way that we can //both// have it. With NFQs, we both get a unique authentication saying we possess the soul, problem solved.\n\n**Calmet:** So what happens to the fish-- the soul itself? \n\n**SCP-7773-2:** We keep it, for you know, safety. \n\n**Calmet:** Let me guess, you took out a loan for those souls -- went through this whole process, and now you can't pay it back?\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** I //can// pay it back -- just once things take off.\n\n**Calmet:** Okay, let's get back to the important bit. Who was--\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Paris Hilton.\n\n**Calmet:** --going to pay you for the job. You know, the whole reason you're here. \n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Oh, that wasn't Paris Hilton. I don't know them personally, found them online. They were willing to pay top dollar for that book though and even offered a handsome investment when we got the job done. \n\n**Calmet** Does this benefactor have a name? \n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Went by \"The_Kaiser\" -- like the roll, I think. \n\n**Calmet:** They say why they wanted the book?\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Didn't ask, didn't care. Could be any reason: demon binding, demon summoning, demon prank calling -- maybe they wanted a word search. Could have asked them once we had it in hand, but hard to say now given that loudmouth setting off the alarm. \n\n**Calmet:** So as much as I enjoy the conversation, there's still an elephant in the room--\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Oh, I know a guy who does elephant removal, we can set you up with our digital currency and--\n\n**Calmet:** I'm talking about our person, the one who got fried. Do you have anything to say about that? I'd choose your words carefully unless you want me to go get the cinderblock I've got on a chain. \n\n**SCP-7773-2:** Look, if anyone's got the answers you want, it's Pluum. I was packed into that airduct like sardines in a can -- sorry, that's an underworld expression -- like two demons squeezed in a fucking tight airduct. Pluum was meant to keep watch outside the library and deal with any snoops though.

Calmet, this is your show. Want to get it running?\n\n//Calmet begins pacing around the exterior of the room as he speaks. Faint ethereal chains fastening the entities to one another and the circle itself apparate and dissipate with the cadence of his voice.//\n\n**Calmet:** One thing you learn in this line of work: you don't put all the subjects in the same room -- even when you're in there with them. Goes double when they have a history; even if it's one as disorderly as the ones assembled here. \n\n**7773-1:** This is an unlawful detainment, I want my lawyer.\n\n**7773-2:** Yeah, get him his lawyer\n\n**7773-4:** Would you both kindly shut the hell up!\n\n**7773-2:** No one cares about your Ayn Rand fanfiction, Xy. \n\n**7773-4:** It's a political satire, you media-illiterate dumbbell. \n\n//Detective Calmet whistles loudly through his fingers, and the assembled entities stop chattering.//\n\n**Calmet:** Getting back on track. We're making an exception to that rule given the situation, because I know something they don't. Far as I gather, they truly think the murder wasn't related to the theft, and I'm inclined to believe they think that.\n\n//Detective Calmet reaches into his jacket pocket, withdrawing a large silver feather, an unmarked DVD, and a small vial of mercury.//\n\n**Calmet:** Thing is, they're wrong.\n\n//Detective Calmet tosses the assembled items towards the centre of the thaumaturgical circle. The room is blinded by a flash of bright light. As it dims, white lines glow on the circle inscription, suspended in the air are ethereal traces of opalescent chains, wrapping around the four demons positioned around the circle, tethering them to one another and a figure in the centre of the circle. The appearing entity is humanoid, kneeling and bent forward; its bare back is visible, with a pair of gossamer, opaque feathered wings emerging from behind its shoulder blades. The entity stands -- a wrap of white linen covering its chest and lower body -- and faces Dir. House and Detective Calmet.//\n\n**Unkown:** Wait is this -- oh shit. Uh, hey boss. \n\n//The individual appears to resemble the presumed-deceased Site-666 employee, Junior Researcher Eva Takács.//\n\n**HOUSE:** Hey there Takács, been a moment. How have you been? \n\n**Takács:** I uh, I can't complain. \n\n**Calmet:** Well, how about you explain instead? \n\n**Takács:** //[sighs.]// Okay, I want to preface this by saying it's not as bad as it looks.\n\n**HOUSE:** Noted. \n\n**Takács:** Okay, well I've been a little burned out the last while, so I was kind of skirting work and going through the old video archives in the library. There's quite a collection of films in the back there if you know where to look.\n\n**HOUSE:** I thought we got rid of those. \n\n**Takács:** No-- I... Do you know that thing about angels and bells? \n\n**HOUSE:** Heard something along those lines. Go on. \n\n**Takács:** Well, surprise! Turns out there's some merit to it. Found footage from 1921 of a ritual and figured 'that doesn't look too hard.' Essentially, if the right church bells ring, the \"angel\" does get his -- or her -- \"wings.\" The thing is finding the right church bell. \n\n**Calmet:** The church in this case being? \n\n**HOUSE:** Keep up Calmet. They may not offer 1-hour weddings, but what are the biggest houses of worship in Vegas? \n\n**Takács:** And the closest thing to a bell being...\n\n**Calmet:** An alarm you tripped, before you faked your own death for cover, with the smokescreen of this assembly of walking distractions.\n\n**Takács:** Wasn't hard to get them to go along with it, I expected a little more scrutiny to be honest. But, you know, \"the greatest trick the devil ever pulled...\"\n\n**SCP-7773-1:** Needing a license to drive a car?\n\n**SCP-7773-2:** That whole thing with the fruit?\n\n**SCP-7773-4:** It's \"convincing the world that he did not exist.\"\n\n**HOUSE:** You're all wrong. Bastard's greatest trick was getting some Frenchman's game into my casino. So, Takács, things play out how you had in mind?\n\n**Takács:** Not going to lie, not entirely. It was worth a shot though, they were bumping up my rent anyway.\n\n**Calmet:** Maybe it's bad taste, but I got to ask. Did it work? What was it like?\n\n= {{[Audio cuts out for 2:30 mins]}}\n\n**HOUSE:** That's not even remotely correct -- and I mean that objectively. Are you sure you watched the right movie?\n\n**Takács:** I mean, there may have been some odd cuts, and parts were pretty hard to make out, but I think I got the gist of it.\n\n**Calmet:** I am truly baffled by how you aren't dead-dead or a pillar of salt. But that aside, are we hanging onto the four stooges here or do you want me to deal with them? \n\n**HOUSE:** I got a thought about that. Takács, I respect the ambition to con heaven and hell for a vacation.  \n\n**Takács:** Thank you, sir, ill-- \n\n**HOUSE:** Follow-through's a little disappointing though. Regardless, you're getting a promotion to a new task force.\n\n//Dir. House strides forwards and grasps one of the faintly illuminated chains binding the entities within the circle to one another.// \n\n**HOUSE:** Listen up you lot, normally folks who try to steal from me don't get so lucky. Now, you've racked up quite a debt to society over the millennium, and you're going to be paying it back, with interest. Don't like it, tough luck. \n\n//As Dir. House holds the thaumaturgical binding, the energy dissipates and the chain briefly vanishes to a near-indistinguishable hue. The circle is broken; freed from their confines the SCP-7773 entities stumble onto the floor. After a moment, SCP-7773-3 approaches Dir. House.//\n\n//SCP-7773-3's circular body splits along the midsection, as its upper segment flips backwards. The opening within reveals a dark void of indeterminate size. Appearing to float within this space is a pair of decorative silver cufflinks, featuring a stylized roulette wheel, the Site-666 insignia, and a monogrammed \"H\".// \n\n**HOUSE:** Not quite the debt I was talking about. And how did you -- I wasn't even wearing these today.\n\n//Dir. House scoops up the items and beings to fasten the cuffs of his dress shirt.//\n\n**Takács:** Thank you sir, this won't happen again. I'm fully committed to Site-666. \n\n**HOUSE:** Oh no you're not. You aren't off the hook that easy, Takács. We have enough demons running around Vegas without getting dollar-store 'angels' in the mix. No, you're off somewhere else. Call it a transfer. \n\n**HOUSE:** Calmet, get them out of that circle, and book the cheapest greyhound to **[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-333 Atlantic City, call it the Site-333 express]**. \n\n//Overlapping sound of the entities and Takács objecting.//\n\n**HOUSE:** I can already tell this was a great idea.\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7772]]] | SCP-7773 | [[[SCP-7774]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Calling2.png\n> **Name:** Groteske vlakdecoratie met koppen van dieren\n> **Author:**  Daniel Hopfer (I)\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Link:** http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.386689\n\n> **Filename:** -2.jpg\n> **Name:** H.
