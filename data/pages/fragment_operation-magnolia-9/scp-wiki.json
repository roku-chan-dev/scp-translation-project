An actor stands at a podium, in front of ripples of pale plasticky blue. There is a patina of grime and glistening sweat, sticky and half-dried, coating his face, his hands, the podium, the curtain, the pallid faces sitting politely in two rows behind him. But all old film looks like that. \n\nA long cut opens up on his right cheekbone, like someone drew a line on his greasy skin with a thin red sharpie. He winces, and resumes speaking.\n\n“Yes, let us pray for the salvation of that totalitarian darkness – pray that they will discover the joy of knowing God, the God that we know, the God who is like a worm in carrion, who is lord of flesh, whose word is a flensing knife. A powerful God.”\n\nLesions appear in a trailing line from the corner of his lips down his chin.\n\n“There you go again!”\n\nThere is laughter from the crowd. He smiles, and three teeth fall out of his gums.\n\n“Good Christian men passed their sons through fire in the jungles outside Jerusalem. The Assyrians put their skulls on sticks along the Ho Chih Min trail. Hallelujah! Flesh and more flesh. No vegetarian option for me, no sir. Keep the center raw. I like it when it bleeds.” \n\nThe fingernails of his right hand crack open. Pus seeps onto his fingertips.\n\n“Let us be aware. The sages preach the supremacy of the Red State omnipotent. They predict the eventual domination of all peoples on the earth. They are ignorant of history; It is already here. It has already happened.”\n\nFaint crosshatched incisions curve across his forehead.\n\n“You know what to do. Youth is wasted on the young. I have fed myself to the beast, ha-ha, he lives in the gulags next door. By my seven hands I hold the scourge and the red bough.”\n\nHis left ear is cut off by an unseen blade and bounces off his shoulder as it falls to the floor.\n\n“Abomination? Abomination! Only semen retention can prevent forest fires. This world is nothing; let our agonies be exquisite. Ten, twenty thousand men died for no damn reason today. Let’s keep those rookie numbers up! Do a combo meal! Big number! Biiiiiiiiiig number!”\n\nHe grimaces, clutches at his stomach, coughs twice, and vomits up a black mass of hair and milk teeth.\n\n“We stand here at Thermopylae against the Kievan Rus, three hundred pederasts with no meaningful career options. They will build a theme park for us. Don’t worry, the helots will pay for it. Christopher Columbus knew the value of a person in gold, and that’s why he was the first real American.”\n\nHe motions with his right hand, the loose spiral of peeled skin flopping about.\n\n“We hold these truths to be self-evident; you can rape your human property and they’ll still put you on money. I look to our founding fathers for guidance. They told me that real patriots, they eat plastic with every meal. The beatings will continue until Henry Kissinger cums.”\n\nHis right eye bursts like an overripe grape. Vitreous humor flows down his cheekbone.\n\n“Sredni Vashtar...Sredni Vashtar...nope! Sorry, bucko, you’ve got the wrong number. Try another universe, Conradin! There you go again!”\n\nWith three rough sawing wounds, his nose is removed from his face. Blood and phlegm mix and ooze. He sputters his next lines, blowing bubbles in the leaking fluid.\n\n“There are tunnels and Doors, and tunnels between doors, knock knock knock it’s Old Scratch’s information superhighway. Auto-immune disorders, they are a gift from God; at last our bodies hate us as much as He does.” \n\nSilent tears open up on his suit; the dark stains of unseen stab wounds turn blue to black.\n\n“Stanislav Petrov is an enemy of the United States. Shomash udal vadukkat.” \n\nHis left arm is cut off just below the shoulder. Blood spills like a soda fountain. He slams his right hand on the podium to emphasize the words.\n\n“It just works. It. Just. Works.”\n\nSkin sloughs off his face in slick sheets.\n\n“Shomash, shomash, shomash udal anam.”\n\nHe shudders and sways. His hair falls out in bloody chunks.\n\n“Red is my favorite color.”\n\nHe is motionless for a moment. A faceless figure all in black – when did it get there? - now stands behind him. It pats him affectionately on the shoulder, once-twice.\n\nThe scene fades to a field of static-studded black. Letter-by-letter, bright red majuscule appears.\n\nTHERE WILL NOW BE A BRIEF INTERMISSION\n\n> Discovery of the first SCP-1981 tape seemed to confirm longstanding but unproven suspicions that Ronald Reagan had been compromised by an unknown anomalous vector during or before his presidency. This came too late to serve as a warning: the overwhelming success of Operation JUBILEE[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A comprehensive Hail-Mary plan to rebuild the Foundation by re-directing the Reagan administration’s support away from PENTAGRAM, CIA-PARADIV, and the Unusual Incidents Unit.[[/span]] had both saved the Foundation from total dissolution and completely transformed its relationship to state power and //sub velamine// groups.\n> \n> The official investigation, while unable to identify the source or nature of the SCP-1981 vector, judged that the comprehensive amnestic treatment and memetic conditioning used on Reagan and his administration throughout his terms in office was sufficient to render it a non-threat and contain its potential spread.\n> \n> As of present, 9 copies of \"RONALD REGAN CUT UP WHILE TALKING\"(sic), 4 copies of “RONALD REAGAN DIES OF ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME-RELATED COMPLICATIONS”, and 2 copies of “HENRY KISSGER GOES TO HELL”(sic) are contained.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/8| Previous]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/10| Next]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
