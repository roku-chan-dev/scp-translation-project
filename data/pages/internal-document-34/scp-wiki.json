We were here, in New England, since the very beginning. Our forefather's saw the potential of this land, this fertile soil and quickly developing society, and we knew what we had to do. Because we know that Adytum will return one day, that's been prophesied for centuries. And when the Ozi̮rmok steps back on earth, how are we going to greet him? As peasants without land or power to help him in his conquests? Of course not. That is what our goal is, if I have to say. We swim in the waters of this world, as the descendants of our immortal founder. And when Ion returns, we'll take on the world together.\"\n\n-//Karcist Vataarin//\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Order of the White Worm]]\n\n**Order Name:** Esoteric Order of the White Worm\n\n**Leading Figure(s):** Karcist József Vörös\n\n**Active in:** Eastern Europe\n\n**In their own words:**\n\"As the last descendants of the Solomonari, save for a few rural families, we find ourselves blessed with the burden of keeping our traditions alive.\"\n\n-//Volutaar Croÿ//\n\n\"There's nothing in the Grand Karcist's teachings that actually posits the existence of an evil creator, or dismisses the local beliefs of Eastern Europe. At most, the Solomonari Valkzaron describes the Važjuma as \"ignorant\" and an \"idiot\", not a hostile force. The Archons, who are the ones who gifted the Ozi̮rmok his powers, are said to wear countless faces in the same chronicle. Because of this, I see no reason to reject the practices of the Hungarian shamans or the slavic tribes of old.\"\n\n-//Karcist-Táltos József Vörös//\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Black Lodge]]\n\n**Order Name:** Hunter's Black Lodge\n\n**Leading Figure(s):** //Anonymous//[[footnote]] The current leadership of the Hunter's Black Lodge would like to stay anonymous due to the risks associated with putting their real names on official papers.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Active in:** Russia, Eastern Europe\n\n**In their own words:**\n\"Listen, the Lodge is... well, we're all brothers here. That's why we call it //Bratva//, eh? Sure, we get into skirmishes, but we're all one. Orok told us, right? \"Betrayal and loyalty are two sides of the same coin\". That's what Orok was about. Compassion and restraint are traps of our foes. Make you weak. Stop you from being wild. And either you are tough or you are a cop, an eunuch or a cow.

The methods and words of the Grand Karcist and his most loyal of all Klavigaar, Saarn. They showed us how to seize power, how to take the world away from the gods and kings to rule as ours.
