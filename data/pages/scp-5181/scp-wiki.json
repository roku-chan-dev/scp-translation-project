Each chamber has been modified to allow for a continuous audio-visual feed of the other two chambers. At no point should this feed be interrupted, nor should the 5181-entities be prevented from viewing it at any time.\n\nThe 5181-entities are restricted to a vegetarian diet. At no point are they to be supplied with any dietary supplements that are not included on Meal Plan V-102.\n\nAs per ECOM.ord.00187, testing on SCP-5181 has been permanently suspended. Inquiries and proposed testing procedures are to be submitted in writing to the Site-12 Ethics Committee representative.\n\nDue to the complexity of operations during recovery of SCP-5181, attempts to completely remove references to the 5181-entities had mixed results. While the propaganda and disinformation campaigns in Europe were largely successful, references to SCP-5181 in the US media and common knowledge were already so wide-spread that complete removal of such were deemed detrimental to overall Foundation operations and were ultimately discarded.\n\nIn lieu of complete erasure, the attempts to spread the \"Teufelshunde\" or \"Devil Dogs\" moniker across the entirety of the US Marine Corps has seen significant success, while references to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines Cheyenne Company have largely been eradicated.\n-----\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ __**Description**__\n[[/div]]\nSCP-5181 refers collectively to a group of biologically and thaumaturgically enhanced humanoids recovered from the Belleau Wood area north and west of Château-Thierry, France. Originally contained by Foundation assets embedded within the United States 2^^nd^^ Infantry Division in July, 1918.\n\nDespite the length of their containment, the three surviving members of the SCP-5181 group have shown no signs of advanced age. While testing on the matter has proven inconclusive, it is believed that the 5181-entities are all biologically immortal, and have shown no degeneration in their physical and cognitive capabilities.\n\n5181-entities all display significantly enhanced physical characteristics, each showcasing dexterity, endurance, and physical strength far superior to that of a baseline human. Additionally, each subject presents with advanced cases of terminal hypertrichosis[[footnote]]Terminal hypertrichosis is characterized by the presence of fully pigmented terminal hair that covers the entire body.[[/footnote]] as well as multiple musculoskeletal abnormalities. While a majority of these abnormalities are subcutaneous and not readily apparent, all of the 5181-entities exhibit extensive reformations of the skull and facial structures.\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n+++ **Attached Addenda**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Discovery**\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:image-block name=belleauwood.jpg|caption=SCP-5181 Discovery Location, C. 1918|width=300px]]\nIn March, 1918, the German Army pushed an offensive west into Allied territories in an attempt to win the war on the Western Front before the United States armed forces had an opportunity to fully deploy. By May of that year, the German offensive had reached the north bank of the Marne River at the small village of Château-Thierry where they encountered the US 3^^rd^^ Army Division. This forced the German advance to turn west towards the commune of Vaux.\n\nThat evening the Germans defeated elements of the French armed forces, which allowed them to move into position to flank the US military. In response, the 1^^st^^ Battalion, 5^^th^^ Marines, including the highly decorated Cheyenne Company, moved to intercept along the Paris-Metz highway. After having conducted an all-night forced march to achieve their position, the 1^^st^^ Batt. Marines were exhausted and ill-prepared to fend off an all-out assault by the German offensive.\n\nDespite this, the Marines were able to hold the position and eventually launch sufficient counter attacks that drove the Germans into entrenched defenses in the Belleau Woods. After several days of intense fighting, the Germans were pushed out of the Belleau Woods with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nIn the aftermath of these engagements, the Foundation received a request from US High Command requesting assistance in retrieving elements of the 1^^st^^ Battalion that had \"gone rogue\" and were continuing to engage any forces that entered Belleau Woods, regardless of allegiance. Lt. Major Jeremy Stevens, a Foundation field operative embedded with the 1^^st^^ Battalion took command of a retrieval operation, which resulted in the deaths of 15 Foundation agents and the acquisition of SCP-5181.\n\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Additional Research**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px; font-family: 'Share Tech Mono', monospace;\"]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; background-color: #c9c9c9; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[size 130%]]Cheyenne Company, 1^^st^^ Battalion, 5^^th^^ Marines, USMC[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 60%\"]]\nCheyenne Company is a disavowed company that was originally part of the 1^^st^^ Battalion, 5^^th^^ Marines in the United States Marine Corps based out of Camp Pendleton, California. Originally designated as a special field operations company, it was made up of special forces marines, occult sciences division operatives, and various paramilitary units.\n\n++++ __Relevant History__\nAs the United States watched World War 1, US High Command recognized both that the US would ultimately be drawn into the conflict as well as the need for highly specialized elements to counter occult and fringe science units within the Imperial German Army. Reports of highly capable paranormal units operating on the Western Front was concerning to US High Command, and which began to covertly prepare paranormal elements of their own.\n\nInitially sanctioned by elements within the Foundation's administration, Cheyenne Company was formed in July, 1914 as a test vehicle for the Special Sciences Division, a product of the SCPF/USAF joint sciences agreement.\n\nThe US military's insistence on weaponizing certain components of the Foundation's growing inventory of anomalous artifacts drew it into direct conflict with the Foundation's Charter. In December of 1914, the Foundation withdrew from the joint sciences agreement with the United States, and the US officially disbanded the Special Sciences Division in February of 1915.\n\nIn May, 1917, Cheyenne Company was reactivated and deployed to France as part of the US deployment strategy to halt the German advance along the Western Front.\n\n++++ __Purpose__\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid #666; width: 40%; vertical-align: top\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[image devildogs.jpg width=\"250px\"]]\n[[size 75%]]//Members of Alpha Squad, Cheyenne Company, USMC in 1918//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**Active:**\n@@ @@ 13 July 1914 – 24 December 1914\n@@ @@ 25 May 1917 – 13 August 1919\n**Country:**\n@@ @@ United States of America\n**Branch:**\n@@ @@ United States Marine Corps\n**Type:**\n@@ @@ Light Infantry/Special Operations\n**Role:**\n@@ @@ Locate, close with, and destroy the enemy by any means necessary.\n**Commanders:**\n@@ @@ Captain John Fitzgerald\n@@ @@ Captain Fyoder Kovalenko, Ph.D. (Adjunct)\n@@ @@ 1st.

Little is known about Dr. Kovalenko, though what intelligence that does exists suggests that he was involved in a variety of para-occult and fringe science experiments, and may have had ties with the nascent Neo-Sarkic cult known as The Hunter's Black Lodge.\n\nThe stated purpose of Cheyenne Company was to combat their counterparts within the German Imperial Army, though this was quickly subverted by Dr. Kovalenko's personal projects into achieving personal apotheosis by utilizing a fusion of parascientific experimentation with \"traditional\" Neo-Sarkic ritual.\n\nWhile instrumental in the battle of Belleau Wood, US High Command was forced to disavow Cheyenne Company in the aftermath of that engagement, and the USMC purged all records of Cheyenne Company from their archives. This, and the Foundation's own efforts to discredit and erase all knowledge of their existence resulted in the near-total loss of all records relating to Dr. Kovalenko and his research.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Attached Addenda**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**SCPF Internal Memorandum**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**FROM:** Dr. Marie Gilburn, Ethics Committee\n**TO:** Dr. Guillome Ribière, Site-12 Director\n**DATE:** 18 May 1940\n**RE:** SCP-5181\n----\nI want to make myself very clear.
