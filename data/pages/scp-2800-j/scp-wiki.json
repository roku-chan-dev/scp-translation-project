Contact with the CORKSCREW Array is to be maintained from Site-21, and any major gravitational or seismic changes detected by the Array are to be reported to Site Command immediately. Upon suspicion of a possible //Melchizedek Event//, Sabre-Team is to be contacted directly for execution of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage.\n\nSabre-Team is to consist of three Overseer Personnel,[[footnote]] With the exception of O5-1. [[/footnote]] in four rotating shifts lasting no more than six months. With Shift 1 consisting of O5-2, -3, and -4, and rotating up to Shift 4, consisting of O5-11, -12, and -13. Upon conclusion of a shift, all Sabre-Team members are to reset and generate new passwords and keyphrases. These passwords are to then be printed out and delivered to the next Sabre Shift, who are to memorize and burn them. Upon conclusion of this process, the former team is to undergo Class-C amnestization.\n \nUpon activation of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage, the designated Sabre-Overseers are to immediately report to Site-21 and unlock Chamber Alpha. Chamber Alpha can only be unlocked via password during a confirmed Melchizedek Event. As further precaution, each Sabre-Team member is to memorize only one-third of this password. Once unlocked, Sabre-Team is to utilize device //Pantabeta// and //2800-J-Delta// in conjunction to execute the next stage of Protocol 5-28-Sabrage. \n\nUpon confirmation that tectonic events have ceased worldwide, the Pantabeta and 2800-J-Delta devices are to be disassembled and re-sealed inside Chamber Alpha. SCP-2800-J will sleep for an average of 7-10 years before another Melchizedek Event.\n\nProtocol 5-28-Sabrage is currently the only attainable way to prevent a full Melchizedek Event. Any failure in the execution of this procedure is certain to cause an XK-Class \"End of the World\" scenario. \n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 130%]]__**DESCRIPTION**__[[/size]] \n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold;\"]][[collapsible show=\"+ SABRE-TEAM ACCESS ONLY +\" hide=\"- INSUFFICIENT CLEARANCE-\"]][[/span]]\n\n[[size 150%]][[span style=\"color:red\"]]ACCESS DENIED\n[[/span]][[/size]] \n[[size 150%]][[span style=\"color:red\"]]OPENING CLEARED DOCUMENTATION...\n[[/span]][[/size]] \n\n[[include component:image-block name=Glyph.png|align=center|width=80%|caption=[REDACTED] canyons around Site-21.

But we couldn't //bring// them here!\n\n//(He glares at O5-5.)//\n\n**O5-5:** I proposed that act for good reason! We can't just let them in on everything! These are jobs for only //us//!\n\n**O5-7:** Gentlemen!\n\n**Phone:** {{You are number FIVE in line...}}\n\n//(A 6.1 magnitude earthquake hits the location. O5-7 is knocked off her feet while O5-5 and O5-6 stumble and struggle to keep balance. The sound of groaning metal is louder. Hold music continues to play over the phone.)//\n\n**O5-7:** //Ow! Sweet lord!//\n\n**O5-6:** How long is this going to take!?\n\n//(Director Kind is weakly attempting to wrap more of his clothing around his wounded leg.)//\n\n**Director Kind:** Can anyone, um... check on Commander Miles-\n\n**Phone:** {{Thank you for waiting. Your call is very important to us. You are number THREE in line...}}\n\n**O5-6:** //(Groans.)//\n\n**O5-5:** How much longer do we have before the Beast wakes up?\n\n**O5-7:** I'm not sure. We were supposed to be in that room ten minutes ago.\n\n**O5-6:** Thank you. Very helpful.\n\n**O5-7:** Yes, helpful! The opposite of what //you// are.\n\n**O5-6:** //Go to hell, Seven!//\n\n**O5-7:** The way this is going? I think we'll be there soon!\n\n//(O5-5 puts his fingers in his mouth and whistles again.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Damn it, Five!

Since it seems you two can't-\n\n**Phone:** {{Connecting...}}\n\n**O5-6:** Finally!\n\n//(A static shuffling sound is heard over the phone.)//\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Hello, my name is Shakti from Foundation Tech Support, to whom am I speaking?//\n\n//(The Overseers look up at each other and make several gestures at each other.)//\n\n**O5-6:** That's not important.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Unfortunately, sir, we do require proof of employment and rank for security purposes. May I get your name please?//\n\n**O5-6:** Um... Site Director Zulu Kind is in the room with us.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Can you put him on the phone please?//\n\n//(O5-6 sighs and hands the phone to Director Kind, who is sitting against the wall. He grabs the phone with a trembling hand.)//\n\n**Director Kind:** Hel- hello?\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Yes, Site Director Kind, can you give me your Foundation ID number please?//\n\n**Director Kind:** Uh... yeah... hang- hang on.\n\n//(Director Kind grabs his Foundation badge and lifts it up with his shaking hand. He spends the next minute slowly reading out his ID number.)//\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //ID is verified, thank you sir.//\n\n**Director Kind:** I'll hand the uh... phone back to the- the others. They're um... trusted employees.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Alright, sir. Have a good day.//\n\n//(Director Kind lifts up the phone. O5-6 snatches it.)//\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Now before we begin you must know this call may be recorded for training purposes.//\n\n//(O5-6 looks to O5-7, she shakes her head.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Let's forgo that.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Eh, I'm sorry sir, but it is Foundation policy that each call be recorded and cataloged-//\n\n**O5-6:** //(Interrupting.)// Well I'm telling you to make an exception-\n\n**O5-5:** For god's sake! //Yes! We're fine with it!//\n\n//(O5-6 looks at him with disdain.)//\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Eh, yes, okay. How may I help you then?//\n\n**O5-6:** We need to reset a password within Site-21.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Site-21, yes... (Keyboard tapping.) Let's see... Which PC?//\n\n**O5-6:** Chamber Alpha Access Computer.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Chamber Alpha... (Keyboard tapping.) That PC appears to be Level 5 security clearance, Overseer Access only.//\n\n//(O5-6 rubs his face. O5-5 looks to O5-7.)//\n\n**O5-5:** //(Whispering.)// We have to tell him.\n\n**O5-7:** //(Whispering.)// You tell him, then.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Are you still there, sir?//\n\n//(O5-5 sighs and grumbles something inaudible. He grabs the phone from O5-6.)//\n\n**O5-5:** This is O5-5, current Sabre-Team member. I am ordering you to reset this password.\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Oh, oh yes, um... (Keyboard tapping.) I believe I need to verify your ID as well.//\n\n**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)// Unfortunately, our ID's are not included in the system. Security thing, you know?\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Unfortunately, sir, it would be an unacceptable risk to the organization to allow you to-//\n\n//(O5-6 snatches the phone from O5-5.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Listen to me! Those earthquakes and tsunamis happening all over the world? That's because of us! We can't stop it because we can't get into Chamber Alpha! We can't get into Chamber Alpha because we don't have the password! //Now do your fucking job and help us reset it!//\n\n**Phone (Shakti):** //Sir, I am going to have to ask you to please calm down! We have never had an Overseer call Foundation Support, so we do not currently have any procedures in place. I will have to transfer you to my supervisor.//\n\n**O5-6:** Wait-\n\n**Phone:** //(Hold music.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Damn it!\n\n**O5-5:** So this is how the world ends?\n\n**O5-7:** I am //not// going to die while waiting on tech support!\n\n**Director Kind:** I would also... hate that... do any of you have an asprin?\n\n**O5-5:** No. Where is Miles!?\n\n**Phone:** {{Connecting...}}\n\n**O5-6:** Which pajeet are we getting now?\n\n**O5-5:** What the hell is wrong with you?\n\n**Phone (Supervisor):** //Pardon me?//\n\n**O5-5:** Hello?\n\n**Phone (Supervisor):** //What did you call me?//\n\n**O5-6:** Nothing.\n\n**Phone (Supervisor):** //Sir, I'll have you know my name is Amjad and the environment we cultivate is one of respect! I'll have to ask you to-//\n\n**O5-6:** //I'll// have you know I'm O5-fuckin'-Six and I don't-\n\n**O5-5:** Shut up!\n\n//(O5-5 yanks the phone from O5-6's hand.)//\n\n**O5-5:** I'm sorry, Mr. Amjad, for my associate's unacceptable behavior. But we are in a rush, and would appreciate your assistance.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes, I will be happy to provide. But first I demand an apology for your friend's insult!//\n\n//(O5-5 and O5-7 look to O5-6.)//\n\n**O5-6:** What!? The fate of the world is at stake!\n\n**O5-5:** Yes! So are you going to do it?\n\n**O5-7:** //(Sighs.)// Just do it, Six.\n\n//(O5-6 balls his fists and grits his teeth.)//\n\n**O5-6:** I apologize, Amjad, for the earlier comment. It was wrong and uncalled for.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Thank you.//\n\n**O5-6:** //(Whispering.) Now I// want //the world to end...//\n\n**O5-5:** So! Back to business.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes, yes. You called about resetting a password, correct?//\n\n**O5-5:** Chamber Alpha access, Site-21.\n\n**O5-7:** And please hurry! It will be the end of the world if we can't get access.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Of course, of course.//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //(Muttering in Hindi.) You're only the fifth person to tell me that today...//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //(Keyboard tapping.) Ah, here we go... do-do-do... Level 5 security clearance. Hm, that will make things difficult.//\n\n**O5-5:** Can you do it?\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes, I believe so. Though you must follow my instructions carefully. First, I will need an email address.//\n\n**O5-5:** Alright, but you'll need a pen for this, and listen //very// close. It's One-G-\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Hold on! Hold on, sir, I am still looking for a pen...//\n\n//(Silence. O5-6 shakes his head.)//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Okay, ready. Go ahead, sir.//\n\n**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)// It's One-G-W-Q-V-Three-E-Q-P-X-Zero-you'll want to put a cross through the zero-D-V-Two-Y at scp-dot-net.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes, okay. I have 1gwqv3eqpz0dv2y@scp.net.//\n\n**O5-5:** That's right, the numbers should add up to five.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Okay... (Keyboard tapping.) I am sending an encoded password reset function to your email. You must open it on the computer that you wish to reset.//\n\n**O5-6:** We can't get //into// that goddam computer! That's why we're here!\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //I believe there is a way, let's see... do-do-do... Ah, your system uses Windows 10, yes. You simply need to switch to administrator mode and make a new windows profile with your Microsoft account.//\n\n**O5-7:** //I'll// be doing that.\n\n**O5-6:** Excuse me? Why!?\n\n**O5-7:** Because Five won't get anywhere typing with a phone in one hand. And frankly I don't trust //you// to not make a mess.\n\n**O5-6:** You are, by far, the worst person for-\n\n//(A 6.7 magnitude earthquake hits the location. Groaning metal is heard below.)//\n\n**O5-5:** Just get on it!\n\n//(O5-7 stumbles to the computer.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Computer. Activate... what was it?\n\n**O5-5:** Administrator mode!\n\n**O5-7:** Activate Administrator mode.\n\n**Access Computer:** {{Director Identification Required. Submit Retinal Scan.}}\n\n**O5-7:** Overseer override.\n\n**Access Computer:** {{Unknown Command. Please consult your Level 3 handbook for a list of Command Phrases.}}\n\n**O5-7:** Oh dear //lord!// Kind! Get up!\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Groaning.) Can't...//\n\n//(O5-6 strides to Director Kind and grabs him by the chest. He lifts him up to the computer and pushes his head up to the scanner.)//\n\n**Director Kind:** Ah! Stop it!\n\n**Access Computer:** {{Retinal Scan accepted. Welcome, Director Kind. Activating Administrator mode.}}\n\n//(O5-6 drops Director Kind against the wall. Further groans of pain are heard.)//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Sir? Is everything okay?//\n\n**O5-5:** Yes. We have it in Administrator Mode, what now?\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //You must make a new windows profile with your Microsoft account.//\n\n**O5-5:** Do either of you have a Microsoft account?\n\n//(O5-6 and O5-7 exchange looks.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Overseers aren't supposed to use non-Foundation devices! You know as well as I do that none of us have touched a civilian operating system in years!\n\n**O5-5:** Well someone has to...\n\n//(O5-5 looks down to Director Kind, slumping against the wall. O5-6 and O5-7 follow his gaze and come to the same conclusion.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Kind, you're Level 4 and under forty. What's your login?\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Weakly.) I... can't...//\n\n**O5-7:** Let me help you.\n\n//(O5-7 reaches into a small pack on her belt. She pulls out a syringe, and jabs it into Director Kind's chest. His eyes fly open as he goes into a coughing fit.)//\n\n**O5-7:** That better?\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Coughing.)// What... the //fuck!//\n\n**O5-7:** Get up. //Now.// Before the adrenaline wears off and Six has to drag you back up.\n\n//(Director Kind struggles to get up and limp to the computer. He begins making a new profile.)//\n\n**O5-6:** //(Tapping his wrist.) Tik-tok//, comon!\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Muttering.) Asshole.//\n\n**O5-6:** That's where I'm going to stick that needle if you don't hurry up!\n\n//(Director Kind finishes inputting the information. He clicks 'Create Profile' just before slumping back down to his knees and crawling to the wall.)//\n\n**O5-7:** //(Stepping back to the keyboard.)// Thank you, Kind.\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Groans.)//\n\n**O5-6:** What now?\n\n**O5-7:** There's a bunch of dots moving in a circle. //(She clicks the mouse.)// I can't do anything.\n\n**O5-5:** //Don't// do anything. Let it load a minute.\n\n**O5-7:** Minutes are diamonds slipping through our fingers here!\n\n**O5-5:** //Just let it load a minute!//\n\n//(The computer finishes setting up the profile. Another screen appears.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Here we are... //(She leans in and squints.) \"Do you want to upgrade to Windows 11 for free?\"//\n\n**O5-6:** Tell it no.\n\n**O5-7:** I don't see an option for //no//.\n\n**O5-6:** What?\n\n**O5-7:** There's only //\"Upgrade Now\"// or //\"Schedule Upgrade\"//.\n\n**O5-6:** We're not upgrading anything!\n\n**O5-7:** How do I skip this!\n\n**O5-5:** Look in the bottom corner!\n\n**O5-7:** What do you... Oh. //\"Decline Upgrade\"// Yes.\n\n**O5-6:** How were we supposed to notice that button? It basically blends into the-\n\n**O5-7:** //\"You're missing out.

The computer loads up a fresh desktop.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Okay, what do I do now?\n\n**O5-5:** It's-\n\n**O5-7:** Wait. Something's coming up...\n\n**O5-6:** Seriously?\n\n**O5-7:** //\"Activate Microsoft 365 Subscription-\"//\n\n**O5-6:** //Decline. Decline. Decline!//\n\n**O5-7:** Will you quit napping at me! How do I close this? It's the 'X' in the corner, right?\n\n**O5-5:** Yes, that closes it.\n\n**O5-7:** Got it. Now I can- No, some blue box just came up... //\"We've got an update for you. Restart now or click OK to wait for your scheduled update at-\"//\n\n//(O5-6 grabs the mouse and clicks 'OK'.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Hey!

Click no!//\n\n**O5-5:** You need to get on the internet, Seven.\n\n**O5-7:** Which one is the internet?\n\n**O5-5:** Open internet explorer.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**O5-5:** The globe with the yellow stripe.\n\n**O5-7:** I don't see that on here.\n\n**Director Kind:** //(Groaning.)// Edge... Microsoft Edge...\n\n**O5-7:** Here it is.\n\n**O5-6:** //(To Five.)// When was the last time you used an actual desktop?\n\n**O5-5:** Not long ago... 1998 maybe?\n\n**O5-7:** It's open. It's on something called //'msn.com'//.\n\n**O5-5:** Go in the search bar. The white box in the middle.\n\n**O5-7:** Yeah I see it, it's- Something just covered it up. //\"What are you interested in?

What are you on?\n\n**O5-7:** It's just showing me news stories about the earthquakes. And other things...\n\n**O5-6:** Jesus Christ.\n\n**O5-7:** //\"10 Movies from the 60s You Need to Watch Now!\"// Hmm...\n\n**O5-5:** //Seven!//\n\n**O5-7:** Just tell me what to do!\n\n**O5-5:** Amjad?

I am here.//\n\n**O5-5:** How do we access the Foundation network?\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //You do not know? (Muffled laugher in the background.)//\n\n**O5-5:** No, Overseers are given our own setups that are preprogrammed and connected to every- Is somebody there with you?\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //No no. Only me. Now you must access a Foundation front website to enter the network.//\n\n**O5-7:** //(Muttering.) First time in my fifty-two years on the council that I've felt like a dunce.//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Let me have a look... do-do-do... ah, look up 'Spare Capital Pennies News' and go on their website.//\n\n**O5-7:** Right, I'll use Google, I've heard of that.\n\n//(O5-7 clicks the top bar and types \"Google\".)//\n\n**O5-5:** You don't have to-\n\n//(Bing's search results come up. She clicks 'Google' and is taken to Google.)//\n\n**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)// Okay...\n\n//(O5-7 proceeds to type \"Google search for 'Spare Capital Pennies News' website.\" into the search bar and clicks the 'search' button.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Even I know I'm watching a caveman-\n\n//(A 7.4 magnitude earthquake hits the region. The Three Overseers grab what they can in an effort to keep steady. Director Kind falls over on the floor, groaning in pain. Sounds of structural stress echo through the halls.)//\n\n**O5-6:** //God dammit! We get it!//\n\n**O5-5:** This is taking too long, Seven!\n\n**O5-7:** I'm working as quick as I can!

She finally closes it.)//\n\n**O5-5:** Now click the 'login' button at the top.\n\n**O5-7:** I see it.\n\n//(O5-7 goes to click the login button, but instead clicks a banner advertisement just as it appears.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Woah!

He attempts to click the login button but is stopped when the email signup box appears. He closes it, and goes to the login button again, on the way closing another side popup asking for donations. He moves the mouse over the login button. A banner advertisement for an AI Girlfriend appears. He waits through a five-second timer, then closes it, making sure to carefully hit the center of the 'X' button. Successfully clicking the login button, he is prompted to enter his credentials. He enters his Foundation credentials and presses the 'enter' key. After another minute of clicking images with motorcycles and solving small puzzles he is let into his Foundation email.)//\n\n**O5-6:** //'A simple three-step process.'//\n\n**O5-5:** //(Sighs.)// Cheers, internet, may I never have to use you again.\n\n**O5-7:** Cheers to that.\n\n//(O5-5 opens his email page. He scrolls through several alarmed messages from other O5 members dated to the last half hour.)//\n\n**O5-6:** Where is it?\n\n**O5-7:** It should be from tech support, right?\n\n**O5-5:** //Amjad?//\n\n//(Sounds of muttering and shuffling are heard over the phone.)//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Yes sir, I am here.//\n\n**O5-5:** Now that you and your friends have had your laugh at us, do me the pleasure of taking us off speaker and tell me where my password reset email is.\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //(Chuckling.)

O5-5 lets out a long sigh.)//\n\n**Phone (Amjad):** //Have I answered your questions in a timely and satisfactory manner?//\n\n//(O5-5 looks to O5-6, then to O5-7.)//\n\n**O5-5:** Yes, Amjad.

A window appears prompting him to run the password reset program. He enters his Overseer identification information and runs the program. The ground shakes more violently.)//\n\n**O5-5:** What should our new password be?\n\n**O5-7:** A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I\n\n**O5-5:** Sure, why not.\n\n//(O5-5 enters the new password into the box. Cracks appear in the ceiling as small pieces of concrete fall to the floor. The Site comes under immense structural stress. A SCP-2800-J hatching event is imminent.)//\n\n**O5-7:** Is everything ready?\n\n**O5-5:** Yes.
