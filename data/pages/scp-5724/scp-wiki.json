SCP-5724-A is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell, with access to a desk and office supplies. Due to the nature of SCP-5724-A, common humanoid containment procedures are unnecessary.\n\n**Description:**    SCP-5724 is a collection of office chairs that exhibit anomalous behavior when placed in proximity of a desk. All instances of SCP-5724 possess markings that generate an instance of SCP-5724-1 when viewed. The effects of SCP-5724 cease when it is taken away from a desk, with the maximum recorded distance between an instance of SCP-5724-1 and a desk being 1 meter.\n\nSCP-5724-1 is a projection that manifests by viewing the markings on an instance of SCP-5724. The markings on the chair alter the perception of all affected individuals to perceive a human being sitting on it. This projection of a human being is able to identify itself and give basic information about itself, primarily information that would be asked of it to complete paperwork. No instance of SCP-5724-1 has been able to give out data that matches their physical appearance, which matches no known individual. SCP-5724-1 is able to become tangible when interacting with other objects in its vicinity.\n\nAll instances of SCP-5724-1 have displayed basic knowledge of the organization they are employed in, although interviews with these projections have been hindered by the inability of SCP-5724-1 to discuss anything unrelated to office work. These projections have been able to accrue promotions within their own organizations, displaying an ability to follow orders and complete paperwork while being unambitious. The public nature of their positions hindered retrieval in some instances.\n\nSCP-5724-A is a leather recliner bearing similar markings to instances of SCP-5724, and it is believed to be an attempt to upgrade the design and capabilities of SCP-5724. SCP-5724-A is capable of displaying an instance of SCP-5724-2. \n\nSCP-5724-2 is a projection capable of independent thought that has claimed it was formerly a human. It has retained the appearance of its former body. The markings that would allow it to become tangible are incomplete, resulting in an inability to move objects. SCP-5724-2 has identified itself as the creator of all known instances of SCP-5724, albeit the method through which they gathered the necessary knowledge to create the objects or transfer their consciousness into another body is as of yet unknown.\n\n\n**Recovery:** During a routine inspection of several Foundation fronts in the ███████ area, an instance of SCP-5724 was flagged for memetic symbols and consequently retrieved by Foundation Agents. The address given by SCP-5724-1 when hired revealed SCP-5724-A under the same conditions. Subsequent instances of SCP-5724 were found by looking at other employees that had the same address listed in their employment record.\n\n\n\n**Addendum-5724-1:** Positions held by instances of SCP-5724-1\n\n||~ COMPANY  ||~ POSITION ||\n||= ███████ Investment Firm ||= Chief Investment Officer ||\n||= ███████ Department of Transportation ||= Accountant ||\n||= ███████ Pharmaceutical company ||= Quality Control Manager ||\n||= Safe Capital Projects LLC. ||= Managing Director ||\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-5724-2\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** [SCP-5724-1 instance]\n\n**Interviewer:** [Researcher Davis]\n\n**Foreword:** [The purpose of this interview is to determine whether or not SCP-5724-1 instances are able to divulge information about their previous jobs. The projection being interviewed worked at Safe Capital Projects LLC, a Foundation front, before recovery. Finding a potential information breach is crucial.]\n\n**<Begin Log, [21:25]>**\n\n**Researcher Davis:** Hello, SCP-5724. Do you mind if we start the interview right now?\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** Ah, hello! I’m honored to have the opportunity to apply to this position. Sorry for sitting down before you arrived.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** This isn’t a job interview, we just wanted to ask you some questions about your previous job at Safe Capital.\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** I am sure you will get nothing but glowing reviews. My time there was great and I have no doubt that if you are looking for a recommendation letter I can call them and see what they can do.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** Are you aware of how you got there? Where you came from? Who got your paychecks?\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** Of course, you definitely need my address. Please send the checks to [REDACTED]. \n\n**Researcher Davis:** Well, what were you trying to gain by working there? Did you relay any information to someone else? Just give me something to work with.\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** Everyone there was great. I really put in the work, and there’s something to be said about putting in the work and climbing the ranks. Not that I would overstep if I was offered a position here, don’t worry.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** Are you still talking about the job offer? No mention of anything else? I’m content with you acknowledging the plant in the corner of the room.\n[Researcher Davis gestures around the room.]\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** Before we get into the details, I will admit that I don’t have a lot of technical ability, but I can assure you that any paperwork that comes my way will get done immediately. I pride myself in my work ethic.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** This is going nowhere, is it? I am talking to the chair equivalent of a worker bee. I’ll end the interview here.\n\n**SCP-5724-1:** Great! When can I start?\n\n[Researcher Davis sighs.]\n\n\n**<End Log, [21:42]>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** [SCP-5724-1 instances appear to be unable to discuss details of previous jobs. There was some acknowledgement that they no longer worked there, but this caused the instance to mistake the interview for a job interview. SCP-5724 working at a Foundation front does not constitute an information breach, it seems as if it was placed there by accident.]\n[[/div]]\n\n [[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-5724-3\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Addendum-5724-3:** Interview with SCP-5724-2\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** [SCP-5724-2 instance]\n\n**Interviewer:** [Researcher Davis]\n\n**Foreword:** [The purpose of this interview is to gain insight into why this chair is more elaborate than the rest. The ability to communicate effectively with SCP-5724-2 makes this much easier.]\n\n**<Begin Log, [15:12]>**\n\n**Researcher Davis:** Hello SCP-5724-2, care to describe your condition?\n\n**SCP-5724-2:** I mean, I messed up. That is why I’m here, right? I’m no longer really a human.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** Well, as of right now we just want to gain some insight into your situation. Are you aware of what caused you to turn to your current condition?\n\n**SCP-5724-2:** This was all caused by those office chairs. Have you talked to one of them? They are mindless drones, and they still got to climb up the corporate ladder? When I made them I didn’t really think too much. Make a few chairs that can project blank humans, and send them into offices. At most it was a bit of extra cash. Next thing I know a chair is approving medical products? Unreal.\n\n**Researcher Davis:** So the chairs fell out of your control? Interesting. Is there anything you could",
