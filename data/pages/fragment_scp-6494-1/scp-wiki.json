Any amount of blood is sufficient. Upon utilizing the knife, they are not permitted to concurrently lose eye sight of Asgard-2 and Asgard-3. They are advised to coordinate blinking patterns as to avoid overlap.\n* **Asgard-6:** After Asgard-0 is utilized, Asgard-6 is to take Asgard-0 and deliver it to Asgard-7.\n* **Asgard-7:** Upon receiving Asgard-0, they are to notify Asgard-1, before claiming their own life utilizing Asgard-0.\n\nSixty seconds after Asgard-7 notifies Asgard-1 of the arrival of Asgard-0, Asgard-1 is to declare Procedure 411-Asgard complete.\n\nThe procedure cannot be varied.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6494 is the inevitable collapse of human cognition.\n\n--Hume levels readings indicate the collective subconscious of humanity is slowly deteriorating.--\n\n--Following cross-testing with another SCP object, researchers discovered SCP-6494.--\n\n--Discovered by Robert Scranton in 1991.--\n\n**Description:** SCP-6494 is the inevitable collapse of human cognition, currently estimated to take place on April 11 2028.

The box is capable of holding up to 100 sleeved cards and shows no anomalous properties when empty or when storing cards.\n\nHowever, if a sleeved ‘commander deck’ of cards is used^^##red|footnote missing##^^, the cards will show anomalous properties, and are able to create whatever the card depicts without flaw.

Junior Researcher Amity Thorn is to be informed of her failure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6494 refers to an anomalous entity first sighted in the rural town of Blackawton, Devon, in 2007, and has since been seen one-hundred-twenty-seven (127) times internationally. It is believed that SCP-6494 is some form of personified cognitohazard^^##red|footnote missing##^^, although further evidence into this is to be attempted. Those who hear SCP-6494 note it sounds like an influential but unfriendly figure in their life.\n\nSCP-6494 appears to provide some type of compulsive cognitohazard, causing obedience and/or ritualistic devotion towards itself to specific persons. Persons who witness SCP-6494 without meeting a list of criteria appear to be completely unaffected by SCP-6494 or its presence. The following criteria has been noted in all persons effected by the compulsive hazard.\n* Between the age range of twenty-two and thirty-three.\n* Has suffered from some type of mental health disorder at some point in their life, no matter how brief. People who still suffer from a given disorder do not seem to apply.\n* Could be considered 'lonely' (i.e., being an only child; introverted personality; lives in a secluded location, or guilt in interpersonal affairs).\nDue to Mobile Task Force protocols and standards^^##red|footnote missing##^^, no Mobile Task Force is to be assigned to SCP-6494 without psychological examination.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"   \" hide=\"Hmm...

SCP-6494's cognitohazardous abilities were capable of changing one's memories^^##red|footnote missing##^^.\n\nSCP-6494's initial containment squad and Class-D personnel who interacted with SCP-6494 showed an express interest in arguing for SCP-6494, as well as behaviors not commonly associated with them prior to exposure to SCP-6494^^##red|footnote missing##^^.

Junior Researcher Amity Thorn is to be informed of her failure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6494 refers to an anomalous entity created through unknown means that has manifested eight-hundred-eighty-eight (888) times internationally since 2007 on an approximately weekly basis. 6494-Events refer to manifestations of SCP-6494. SCP-6494's appearance is inconsistent, but primarily takes the appearance of a bipedal entity with no discernible features or traits.\n\nSCP-6494 is non-hostile unless engaged, but those in its presence are known to hear vocalizations akin to human speech. Those who hear SCP-6494 acknowledge that it sounds like an influential but unfriendly figure in their life. Additionally, SCP-6494 possesses an ability to demanifest instantaneously.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I don't get it.\" hide=\"What am I doing wrong?\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** amitythorn@site411.scip.net\n**From:** tianachord@site411.scip.net\n**Subject:** Re: In Regards To SCP-6494\n[[/div]]\n------\nDear J.

I need an ungodly amount of sugar, can't be healthy. Anyway, what did you want to talk about?\n\n**█████ █████:** To be honest, work sadly. We need to talk about your productiveness recently.\n\n**█████ █████:** Honestly, Tiana, just time, dedication, and stubbornness.\n\n**█████ █████:** It's kinda strange. You're extremely dedicated, it's clear, but you haven't actually handed anything in. How come?\n\n**█████ █████:** I think a lot of my inspiration comes from the weird things in my own life, so I know how to articulate things. Although, I've always been a fan of horror, so that's always going to come in handy.\n\n**█████ █████:** Being a perfectionist surely can't be it. You've stayed overnight here three nights in a row now. You need to talk a break or you're going to kill yourself.\n\n**█████ █████:** Plus, think about how much there is to draw from. I know what makes a good object, so I just need to find the words.\n\n**█████ █████:** SCP-6494? You're not on that though, unless? I mean, I could transfer it over to you, but I honestly don't think you'd be satisfied. We're pretty sure it's getting decommissioned anyways.\n\n**█████ █████:** From there, it all flows onto the canvas and things feel fine. Metaphorically, though, I type it. Obviously, though. Maybe a painting SCP?\n\n**█████ █████:** Amity, are you hearing yourself? This isn't good, you can say you're a \"dedicated worker\", but does sleeping in your cubicle and living off cafe coffee sound acceptable to you? If you don't get your act together, I'm gonna have to transfer your department.\n\n**█████ █████:** And see, that's how I get my ideas! One-off comments, painting words. Maybe some sort of cognitohazardous painting that has some sort of text. Maybe I could even make that pipe painting, you know? I've always hated it, but maybe I could do something with it. Do other people hate it?\n\n**█████ █████:** Don't worry, I'm not jumping to any definitive punishment. I'm probably just gonna give you a few days off, you've got your eye on that girl down in Logistics, don't you? Maybe take the week of Valentine's off, you could use it.\n\n**█████ █████:** Ah, I tend to ramble. But, yeah, Tiana. If you ever need a hand writing, just ask me, I'm always open to working with others. Well, not always, but I'm sure we could here or there. Maybe if I need you I could get a hand?\n\n**█████ █████:** I can tell you aren't happy, but it's for the better. Anyway...\n\n**█████ █████:** Yeah, I should get going too.
