SCP-5968 begins to manifest with advertisements reading “Have a stellar meal at the Starlight Diner. ████ Starseed way.”, hereby designated as SCP-5968-1. These advertisements originate by growing through the cracks of sidewalks, roads and brick walls and appear to be biological in makeup with the texture of copy paper. Once fully formed SCP-5968 will appear at the address of ████ Starseed Way.    \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\nThe interior of SCP-5968 is painted a washed beige on all walls, with a popcorn ceiling lit by fluorescent lights and a black and white checkered tile floor. Seating in SCP-5968 is provided by red and yellow wooden tables surrounded on their sides with cushion booths. The dimensions of the  building change constantly but usually fall between 5m-15m wide and 20m-170m long, with a constant height of 3.5m, SCP-5968 is always a hallway, possessing no kitchen or bathrooms, only a door at the end of the hallway with a plaque reading \"//Manager//\" in gold lettering. SCP-5968 is populated with humanoid entities, hereby designated SCP-5968-2, roughly two (2) meters tall with an absence of facial features with the exception of a painted-on smile. These entities are covered in dry, heavily dimpled skin and wear neon yellow jumpsuits that resemble nylon in material. In place of hands SCP-5968-2 instances possess large fleshy clam like appendages that regurgitate ordered items from SCP-5968's menu. SCP-5968's menu items range from regular items to the extraterrestrial and anomalous and change daily; said items do not have prices however tips are happily accepted in the form of solid matter. The menu appears in the reader's native tongue and in Braille for blind customers.   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\nPatrons of SCP-5968, hereby designated SCP-5968-3, include a variety of extraterrestrial and extra-dimensional creatures, many able to understand most human languages and none hostile.   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\n__**SCP-5968's menu:12/19/████**__   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n  \n\n||~ **Item Name** ||~ **Description** ||~ **Effect Upon Consumption** ||  \n|| Cuban Sandwich  || Item made in the stack order from bottom to top of: grilled Cuban bread, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, three (3) dill pickle chips and a dollop of honey mustard.  || D-33231 felt full. ||  \n|| Olokvidashi Flank  || Item tested near identical in genetic makeup to the //Homo denisovan// species of early human.

Fifteen (15) minutes after consumption D-61222 exploded, causing interior damage to his holding cell. Traces of uranium and plutonium were found post-analysis in D-61222's blood, leading researchers to believe the dish was a prepared instance of the [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5632 |SCP-5632]]] subspecies of lionfish. ||  \n|| Grilled Latabros Breast from Tau Ceti f || Subject served a portion of meat in a sirloin cut.
