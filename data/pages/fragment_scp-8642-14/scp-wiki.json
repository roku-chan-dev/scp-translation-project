  "content": "You decide that you really don’t need more information; you have everything you need for your auditing report, after all. You thank everyone in the Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation of Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs for their help and quickly walk back out the door you came in. You hear the door shut behind you, and suddenly you’re back in the familiar, sterile white hallways of the SCP Foundation. You make your way back to the Auditing Department with only one wrong turn along the way. Your boss berates you for taking so long, and tells you that you aren’t leaving until the report is done. You sit down at your desk and return to your normal routine, paying no attention to the mystery and wonder that slips out of your life day by day.\n\nCongratulations! You found the Boring Ending! You did your job and went back to your normal, boring life at the SCP Foundation!\n\n||= Page 14 - Boring Ending||\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/0 Try again to get all 7 endings!]||\n||= or||",
