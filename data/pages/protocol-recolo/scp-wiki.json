As dictated by the protocol, several personnel of either Level 3 or 4 were upgraded to Overseer and Liaison status due to a mix of continued excellence in work output, directing other personnel and ability to deal with high amounts of stress in short time frames. Due to changes in Foundation leadership, the document is open to all personnel. For convenience, Ethics Committee Liaisons are designated as EC-(their number).//\n> \n> * **O5-1**: OK, welcome everyone.\n> * **EC-1**: Yes, welcome everyone.\n> * **O5-10**: I’m still getting used to all this security.\n> * **EC-3**: Me too.\n> * **O5-1**: Don’t worry. Everybody’s guard numbers will decrease after this initial meeting. You all read the document detailing [[[Tanhony's Proposal|SCP-001]]], correct?\n> * **O5-7**: Yes. I know the Foundation isn’t above keeping anomalies unaware of where they are, but at least it was so they didn’t blow up the fucking world.\n> * **EC-16**: It’s still at this site, isn’t it?\n> * **O5-11**: In the infirmary, yes. The prosopagnosia procedure hadn’t gotten into the more advanced stages, so recovery is going to take a while.\n> * **EC-2**: We’re all in agreement about none of us using it again, right? I mean two councils and a team of liaisons died because they couldn’t stop messing with it.\n> * **O5-9**: We could just throw it in a standard humanoid containment unit.\n> * **EC-15**: That would get it out of our minds, but I think there’s more we can do.\n> * **EC-1**: Right. It’s in the state it is due to the Foundation’s abuse, something that we shouldn’t be doing to anomalies. This is our mistake and we need to fix it.\n> * **O5-1**: Are you suggesting…?\n> * **EC-1**: I propose that we release him into civilian life, without amnestic treatment.\n> \n> (Silence for 24 seconds)\n> \n> * **O5-4**: You can’t be serious.\n> * **EC-1**: I //am//. Despite its anomalous properties, the Foundation abused it for its own gain and we all agree that we can’t let ourselves fall into the habits of our predecessors. …And it deserves to know who did it to them.\n> * **O5-13**: And what if GoIs try to exert their own influence onto SCP-001?\n> * **EC-1**: That is why we will monitor it. Should any hostile powers try to capture it, or should it try to use its abilities in ways that could cause damage to civilians, we will take it into containment once again.\n> * **EC-19**: If we’re going to release SCP-001…, then there are other non-hostile sapient anomalies that we should as well. Though taking advantage of them did not result in as much damage as this one did to the Foundation, they were still thoroughly abused in ways that caused a great amount of physical and psychological stress to them.\n> * **O5-3**: You know that this will completely upend the way the Foundation operates, right? Releasing non-hostile sapient anomalies without amnestic treatment? If they threaten the Veil Protocol…\n> * **EC-1**: Which is why the Foundation will continually monitor them for any actions that threaten civilians or the Veil. If the need arises, we contain them, like an NDA. I still believe that the Veil is necessary for our operations to continue, but there’s no reason to cause any more unnecessary secrecy.\n> * **O5-7**: This would save the Foundation countless amounts of money spent on their living expenses. But are we sure this is what we want to do?\n> * **O5-1**: The Foundation has taken anomalies from their lives and thrown them into needlessly cruel experimentation. We have seen what this did to our predecessors. And the Foundation needs to be better if we want to continue operating without crazy shit like this. Besides, we’re lucky SCP-001 couldn’t fight back. What’s to stop the next anomaly someone tries to take advantage of from fighting back when it wants its freedom.\n> * **EC-23**: Say we did do this. What would we tell the anomalies?\n> * **EC-1**: We would inform them of the changes, return them to their families and help them readjust to civilian life.\n> * **O5-11**: There’s going to be plenty of lingering resentment.\n> * **EC-1**: Of course there is. But we can't just erase it. We need it to be a reminder of what we can’t allow to happen again.\n>\n> //Vote of O5 Council and Ethics Committee Liaisons on the release of non-hostile sapient anomalies that don’t immediately cause harm to civilians or the Veil.//\n>\n>\n> ||~ ||~ Yes ||~ No ||~ Abstain ||\n> || O5-1 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-2 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-3 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-4 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || O5-5 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || O5-6 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || O5-7 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-8 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || O5-9 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-10 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || O5-11 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || O5-12 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || O5-13 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || EC-1 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-2 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-3 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-4 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || EC-5 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-6 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-7 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || EC-8 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-9 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-10 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-11 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-12 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || EC-13 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-14 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || EC-15 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-16 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-17 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-18 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || EC-19 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-20 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-21 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-22 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || EC-23 ||  || X ||  ||\n> || EC-24 ||  ||  || X ||\n> || EC-25 || X ||  ||  ||\n> || EC-26 || X ||  ||  ||\n>\n> THE MOTION PASSES\n\n------\n\n+++ December 2, 2021\n\n[[[SCP-105|Iris]]] liked doing picture puzzles.\n\nWhether it was a small one or a puzzle with hundreds of pieces, Iris liked doing them to look at what they showed her. It gave her something to do in her cell. The Foundation didn’t want her to go insane after all — they could still make use of her gifts. Iris scoffed at that. Of course it had been over six years since anyone had asked her to help them, but what use was a gift it got you locked up for almost a decade? She knew it would be turning into her decade-anniversary of her stay with the Foundation — those psychiatrist appointments, useless as they were asking how their prisoner was feeling, helped her keep track of what day it was.\n\nThis puzzle was of the solar system. It was over 1,000 pieces and she had been working on it for the past three hours on the floor. Maybe when it was done, she could try to reach her hand into it, but it likely wouldn’t work. She had tried it with other puzzles, but it felt as though she was reaching into a wood chipper that was turned on. The pain was only temporary and the marks that should have been on her hand always disappeared when she stopped trying.\n\nThere was a knock on her cell door. “May I come in?” a soft feminine voice asked. That was unusual. She had previously been able to leave her cell freely during the day and talk to the other Site-17 residents and talk to the guards, or as much as one could call conversing with people who barely spoke more than one sentence and had orders to subdue you if you got too rowdy. But that hadn’t been the case for nearly three months. It was after the day her and Rainer had discussed SCP-001. It was a simple guessing game and they just thought that whatever it was was strong and the Foundation would definitely use it if they got the chance. What was so wrong about their guess? She hadn’t been able to come out of her cell unless it was for psychiatrist appointments and it wasn’t today, and they most certainly didn’t ever knock on her door and ask if they could come in.\n\n“Um… yeah” Iris hesitantly responded. This was all new territory for her. She hadn’t thought she did anything bad in her cell recently, or at least, she thought she hadn’t. She supposed she would just have to find out.\n\nThe door opened and a woman in a white lab coat with dirty-blonde hair stepped through. She had a pale face, brown eyes and small marks around her cheeks. Iris stood up. The woman was only slightly taller than Iris. She smiled.\n\n“Iris…” she began. Iris’s eyes widened, apart from her psychiatrist and the other anomalies no one ever called her by her name, always SCP-105 or 105. “I was wondering if you would like to go back to Arizona.”\n\nSuddenly the picture puzzle didn’t seem so important.\n\n= **[[[you want to go home?|You Want to Go Home? > > > > >]]]**",
