Welcome to my art hub!** Here is where I will post all my SCP related art.\nI hope to use this to draw more often and improve more, so I hope this shines through.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Fanart of singular SCPs]]\nThis is for all Fanart focussing on singular articles and/or my favourite aspects of them.\n\nI will try to do mostly newer SCP's/SCP's I have not seen a lot of fanart of, although I won't rule out the occasional \"classic\". Overall it is just based on my favourites though. :D\n\n**By the way**: If you have any suggestions for underappreciated SCPs or are an author that would like to have some art I'd be very happy to take a look at them and see what I can do! :D\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Taboo\" hide=\" Just repeat the last syllable of any name you use one additional time for everytime you use it! Tabooboo Taboobooboo Tabooboobooboo. \"]]\n\nTo start things off with number **1**, here is an SCP that I think about on an at least weekly basis: [[*user PeppersGhost]]'s [http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo Woods Beyond Name].\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/GKqTfOt.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"4104\" hide=\" What will be left after he did whatever it is he wants to do?\"]]\n\nNumber **2** is [[*user KrySalems]]' [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4104 \"Heâ€™s lying to you all.\"]. A cold and eerie story about nothing.\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/SPmasSr.gif width=\"600px\"]]\n\nThis is my first time really using a gif in an artistic way so I hope it came out well.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"4444\" hide=\" Tbh the only thing I knew about Gore before this was the Southpark depiction. \"]]\n\nAnd here goes number **3**!

This one was especially interesting to me because it was described as an optimistic, \"happy-end\"-kinda story when to me it only grew more and more uncomfortable and scary.\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/QWLNhd2.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Super Secret shit\" hide=\"What it actually is\"]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/6ZI3xpa.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n\n(screenshot is from me and my friend's server)\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"4051\" hide=\"Poor Rainer.\"]]\n\n\nNumber **6** is special to me because my first idea for an SCP, before joining the site, was: \"a guy that could produce anything out of the pockets of any coats he wore\". And this is basically that concept but realized in proportions and with a complexity, I would have never been able to. It is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4051 SCP-4051] by [[*user Nagiros]].\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/cjCPgLh.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"3165\" hide=\" Who needs foxy girls when you can have wolfy ones?\"]]\n\nNumber **7** took the scary murder monster and made it not only interesting but also kinda cute. I wanted to give her some (misshapen) lipstick but it only ever looked like blood. :( \nAnd yeah I can do colour too! :P This is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3165 Dog Teeth] by [[*user Dog Teeth]]!\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/NfICRgd.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"4377\" hide=\"People for the people god!\"]]\n\nNumber **8** is [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4377 Fight!
