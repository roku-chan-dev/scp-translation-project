A weapon forged to finally defeat the enemy; corruptors of mankind, wielders of flesh-crafting magics. The forces of Adytum, for that is what they call their cursed city, to which they dare give the name of the land of freedom. They are led by Ion the Mutineer, who dares to call himself the godslayer. He wields forbidden magics, but has forgotten that his sign is not the crown of power, but the rusted chains of a slave. He must not be allowed to enter Daevon and conclude his bloody insurrection, upheld by what he calls justice and vengeance.\n\nTo achieve such a weapon, a ritual will be required, its ingredients as follow:\n* The body of a barely-alive desert wyvern, its scales impossible to pierce by any blade or arrow;\n* A catalyst that will seize the soul of the beast from its body and leave it an empty shell, a vessel for the hatred of great Daeva warriors;\n* Seven candles made from the body fat of traitors;\n* Blood mixed with sulfur, used to close the ritual circle.\n\nThe most important step of the ritual is acquiring the vessel. The Thar desert is home to many such wyverns -- it is therefore the perfect place to hunt the creature. The being must be vastly superior to the other beasts in order to be able to massacre the hordes of the enemy. To defeat its claws and scales, which protect it from almost any attack, we will use the rite of entanglement and catch the creature. Once it has fallen to its knees, we will drag it to the Grand Temple, where the ritual will be performed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n[[=]]\n//{{Words of Priestess Ishaan, infused with Power}}//\n//{{Sing to the steps of a marching army, I-I-III}}//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**I.**\n\nFoes of\nDaeva\nshall soon find their graves\n\nWe shall\nwipe out\nunobedient slaves\n\nTheir four\nmages\nand the kin of Ion\n\nRebel\narmy\nfallen by our iron\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/na-bestyje-przepis-jeden-kranca-wdech/szkar%C5%82atny-kr%C3%B3l.png) center no-repeat ; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ **__THE ART OF WAR__**\n[[/=]]\n\nNo war should last four decades, but the conflict fought against the Mutineer seems to have no end. Since the first battle of his Uprising, fought in the dungeons of the Grand Temple, the Heretic seems to only grow stronger. No matter the might of the armies of the [[[tears-and-bone|stolen Scarlet]]] that are sent against the carnomancers at the Maharani's behest: the king of the godless always emerges victorious.\n\nHis control over the body rivals even the Fool's magic that binds Daevon's invincible armies. Both the Khanate and the Grand Court are left powerless when the Hundred-fathomed Colossus, the Fool's Mistress, the Condemned Scholar, and the Venomous Cloak throw themselves into battle alongside their mentor, for their march soon becomes unstoppable. The power of the platoons sent from under Daevon to their deaths is irrelevant, for all it takes is the snap of a finger and Adytum's servants turn their bodies to dead meat.\n\nTo succeed in the battle against them, an ideal being will be needed: one that moves beyond life and death. The Mutineered has declared his dominion over creatures of flesh -- the only chance to stop his impending siege of Daevon is an ungodly behemoth that would be able to resist his magic while decimating his people with a single sweep of its monstrous body.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n[[=]]\n**II.**\n\nMother's\nlegion\nfrom an ancient age\n\nLed by\nthe son\n[[[scp-076|let out of his cage]]]\n\nEver-\n-lasting\nin his battle fury\n\nHelots'\nrancor\nground into a slurry\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/na-bestyje-przepis-jeden-kranca-wdech/szkar%C5%82atny-kr%C3%B3l.png) center no-repeat ; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ **__HATRED TOWARDS THE ENEMY__**\n[[/=]]\n\nJust as the Maharani had resurrected one of the sons of Adam, Her power over life will once again show Daevon a path to victory over death. Once the wyvern's body has been hollowed out of its bestial soul, it will be filled with the rage and fury of a hundred of the most distinguished Daeva warriors. Using the stolen magic of the Forest and of the Night, their Anima will be molded into a soul-shaped hole, in the heart of which only a scream of fury will remain. A scream whose hatred will be directed against the Rebellion.\n\nOnce the soul has been transformed, the Maharani will close the ritual circle and decorate it with seven candles which will focus the Fool's attention solely on her. She will then proceed to slay the beast, resurrecting it shortly thereafter with the help of runes and signs carved into its scales. In this dance they will stand together for thirteen moons -- and with each repetition the beast will absorb more power onto itself, sucking it in like a blood-seeped bandage. This will continue until the essence of the beast finally leaves the circle of samsara and becomes a creature that exists beyond the Great Cycle of the universe.\n\nThen -- and only then -- from the animal instincts of the wyvern and human hatred will a true anger birth itself. Anger against all that lives under the boot of samsara; anger against all that is troubled by life; anger against all that dares to call itself human. The Mutineer prides himself on rejecting the title of a god, on living as a normal human being. If he truly wants to earn this title, however, he will have to face the single most human quality of them all: the hatred of his enemy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n[[=]]\n**III.**\n\nArm in\narm with\nbeast of desert blood\n\nFor the\nGoddess\nthey will be subdued\n\nMaha-\n-rani\nblessed be her word\n\nWith Her\nwe shall\nleave our rivals gored\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/na-bestyje-przepis-jeden-kranca-wdech/szkar%C5%82atny-kr%C3%B3l.png) center no-repeat ; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ __**BREATHING LIFE INTO FURY**__\n[[/=]]\n\nWe chained the exhausted wyvern to the floor with shackles of blood. It squirmed, fearing what was about to come. Little did it know that it would soon help Daevon reach a victory against peasants that did not know their place in this world. It tried to set itself free, but after many hours it ceased in its struggle; it finally surrendered and accepted its noble fate. A circle of sacrificial blood and sulfur was formed around its body, and candles were placed at the tops of the heptagram within.\n\nTo protect the weapon from Ion's manipulations, we pierced its skull with a dagger and immediately seized the fleeing soul directly into the catalyst, where it writhed and screamed, begging for freedom. We let it back in into its body, engraving runes within its scales, and then snatched it into the catalyst once more. This cycle continued until the beast finally stopped feeling the pain of its wounds. It became apathetic; it ignored the pain, which meant it was ready for its destined gift, the chalice filled with hatred.\n\nThe essence flowed through its veins, its arteries, its every single limb, until there was nothing but fury left inside the beast. Hatred suddenly snapped inside the creature as if it was being guided by the strings of something much bigger, something much more powerful. When it finally got to its feet, it let out a piercing roar that brought forward images of true terror. That display was a sign the ritual had succeeded and the weapon was ready for the arrival of the proudful enemy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\n[[=]]\n**IV.**\n\nUnder\nwalls of\nthe Immortal Fortress\n\nFalls the\nTraitor\nnow utterly hopeless\n\nTo the\narmies\nof the Endless Khanate\n\nProudly\nled by\nchildren of the Scarlet\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ //Under Daevon//\nKlavigar Nadox, //Lost Poems//\n\n@@ @@\n\nSilence\n\nBeyond the walls of the city, the world signed a contract\nfor words;\ntheir number minimal\n\nSilence\n\nAmongst the march of a million feet\nthat tear up the ground inside the city\nso ready to kill\n\nSilence\n\nAs we five enter inside\nseeing nothing\nbut a broken ruin\n\nSilence\n\nBetween palaces, temples\nhouses\nand granaries\n\nSilence\n\nOn the Square of Wernorad, in the heart of Daevon\nwhose sky thundered with the cries of battle\njust one day before\n\nSilence\n\nIn the heart of the [[[scp-682|beast, its body atop a hill of silent corpses]]]\nakin to a king beneath the capital of the Khanate;\nits eyes a cruel parody of equity\n\nSilence\n\nInside its soul, which in its silent hatred\nunderstands one thing, and one thing only:\nthe urge to kill its masters\n\nSilence\n\nWhen in its boundless rage, its eyes lock with that of Ion\nthe gesture is full of\nonly understanding.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=KubKac and Ralliston, translated by Draven Addams and Ralliston]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** szkarłatny-król.png\n> **Author:** [[*user SunnyClockwork]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cotsk-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
