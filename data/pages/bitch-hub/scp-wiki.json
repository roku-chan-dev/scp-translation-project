In that time she has proven a capable, level-headed member of administrative staff.\n\nNo wonder nobody likes her.\n\nThis is the story of how one woman overcame the odds to survive nearly three decades of paper-pushing, blame-soaking and flirtation-dodging to become utterly miserable while surrounded by shiny, happy people. She probably deserves it. Let's choose to believe she deserves it.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"brief\"]]\n++ ##white|**Bitch Pages**##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[The Forms]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nAn administrator is severed from their signature as expression of personal preference. We sign our names to stamp the imprimatur of authorities vested in us, not to issue moral judgement. Our hand and seal are moved by higher powers than ourselves, and we do not second-guess their motives.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[A Bitch]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nIt is possible, through a rough assemblage of varied documents from varied sources, to paint a sympathetic portrait of any human being. The careful curator can hint at deeper conflicts, ambivalence, even silent heroism. One must be wary of such potentially misleading assemblages.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[The Ship of Screams]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nIt is an unfortunate fact of chemistry that our bodies and their controlling intellects have needs beyond simple sustenance. Internal fraternization is also a fact of any large organization; the further fact that most workplace romances end in disaster has proven, regretfully, of little value as a deterrence.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Cross-reference: [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/interview-with-a-vampire-boat|What does B stand for?]]]//\n//by [[*user Crow-Cat]]//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[Transposthumousism]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nThe Foundation cannot support the Veil of Secrecy alone. We are required from time to time to interact with representatives of other normalcy-maintaining organizations, particularly when treading on their territory. Maintaining a neutral and noncommital posture is paramount on these occasions.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Cross-reference: [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-file-2024-092|The SAINT SEBASTIAN SLASHER]]]//\n//by [[*user Anorrack]]//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[Karen, Queen of the Monsters!]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nThere are other Foundations beyond our own, and together we help secure the future of the human race across a multitude of worlds. Some of these are distastefully divorced from the logical frameworks governing ours; under such circumstances, judicious departures from protocol may be acceptable.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[Act Your Age]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nThis organization will outlive us all, or we will live to witness the end of the Earth. Both possibilities weigh heavily on Foundation employees as they age to obsolescence, retirement and death. There is no staving off the reaper indefinitely; one must instead find such solace as one can, where one can.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[Fair Play]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nSetting rules and setting tasks can set you in your ways. It becomes difficult to see and seize opportunities, to live dynamically, really to live at all. We nevertheless must try, as new experiences can provide solutions to old problems. But remember this as well: there will always be new problems.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n\n++ **[[[/scp-7165 | The Faux Pas]]]**\nby [[*user HarryBlank]]\n\n**From the Desk of Dr. Elstrom:**\n\n[[<]]\nIn retrospect, personnel should not be encouraged in their fraternization efforts. The formation of permanent attachments is at best an obstacle to the smooth execution of our containment efforts, and at worst an invitation to anomalous disorder. Perhaps stricter guidelines should be laid down...\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[Harry Birthday]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/18-the-only-constant|The Breach Goes On: Wrong Tomorrow]]]** >>\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Bitch_Hub.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]] with personally owned reference material created using [https://www.daz3d.com DAZ Studio].\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
