Presently, staff of Site-898 are not permitted to leave the area constituting SCP-8946. Staff of Site-46 are similarly to remain on-site for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Departments of Geology are currently working with RCT-Δt to synchronize their now cross-dimensional databases and rectify the record-keeping effects of SCP-8946.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8946 is the designation of a currently unknown spatial and temporal event that has resulted in the appearance of Geological Research Site-898, and the staff constituting it. These staff members claim to be of the Department of Geology, a Foundation department founded in the late 1950s, currently led by Director Hellen Gibbs. This information was found to be contradictory with files from Research and Containment Site-46 -- which houses the Department of Geology and claims to have been founded by Director Juliet Grey in 2026.\n\n[[include component:image-block name= gibbs.jpg|caption= Photo of Director Hellen Gibbs, discovered in the Foundation employee database. |width=250px|align= right]]\n\nIn the following hours after SCP-8946's occurrence, several discrepancies within the Foundation database were found. Primarily, the existence of all individuals from SCP-8946 within the Foundation database as always having been members of the Department of Geology,[[footnote]] In-spite of dates not correlating.[[/footnote]] and the appearance and records of contained anomalies whose existence prior to the event is contested by the differing Departments. \n\nImmediately after the database errors were noted, RCT-Δt issued a lockdown on both Sites-898 and -46, and exerted executive control over the studying and processing of SCP-8946. Director Juliet Grey, as well as a few other members of Site-46 staff, were by proxy cordoned to Site-898 due to having made the initial discovery and contact.\n\nCurrently, the only conclusive information had is that SCP-8946 has resulted in two Departments of Geology, both with separate histories and personnel, that have no record nor memory of the other.\n\n**Discovery:** The arrival of SCP-8946 was recorded when a collection of Site-46 geology staff were investigating the Red Brook Mine, Pennsylvania, for possible anomalous activity after reports of disturbances. Due to a series of unknown errors, the data pertaining to the date and time at which this occurred was corrupted. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**SCP-8946 Occurrence Log**\n\nThe following log contains what is believed to be a recording of the initial SCP-8946 event.\n------\n//<The relevant footage begins roughly two hours into recording>//\n\n//The three geologists -- Dr. August Fenn, Junior Researcher Bea Gillie, and Director Juliet Grey -- stand within a low-ceiling portion of the mine. They are examining the cave wall  streaked by flowstone and, quite noticeably, a large crack-like formation that runs along the wall and onto the ceiling. Dr. Fenn tilts back xyr head to stare at it.//\n\n**Dr. Fenn:**  Is this the same fault from the other side of the borehole? \n\n**Rsr. Gillie:** Could be. \n\n//Dir. Grey has her gaze downturn to the map she is sketching -- it includes several scrawled-on notes about various rock layers and observations the group has made thus far.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** If it's the same, we're looking for where some Pocono siltstone meets the Catskill?[[footnote]] Regional geological formations.[[/footnote]] \n\n**Rsr. Gillie:** Seems the footwall of the unit is red -- wasn't Catskill red mudstones and sandstones?\n\n//Rsr. Gillie approaches the wall, she runs a hand along it.// \n\n**Dr. Fenn:** Yup, so it's likely the same fault. \n\n//There is a slight tremor. The three tense, and exchange confused glances.//\n \n**Dr. Fenn:** Never a good sign.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Typically, that's an //exit// sign. \n\n**Rsr. Gillie:** I thought this place was marked as safe by the Reclamation folks?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Doesn't mean shit if Mother Earth says otherwise, we should move. Not worth taking chanc--\n\n//The tremor re-occurs, with increased intensity. It causes Rsr. Gillie to stumble, and she braces herself against the mine wall. Shortly after, she yelps.//\n\n**Rsr. Gillie:** The hell? It's heated up--\n\n**Dir. Grey:** //What?//\n\n**Rsr. Gillie:** The wall-- it's warm, it wasn't warm a few moments ago--\n\n//Audio and visuals from Dir. Grey's bodycam suddenly distorts heavily, and a loud screeching sound is heard. Amongst the interference, the three individuals can be heard clamoring -- they are attempting to exit the tunnel and move towards the mine's exit.//\n\n//The tremors continue to worsen.//\n\n**Dr. Fenn:** //Keep going!//\n\n//The wall the team had been previously examining, and the wall along the entire stretch of which they are running, has turned red-hot and started to bubble. All voices from the team have since been drowned out by a grinding, scraping sound.//\n\n//There is a growing light from an unknown source opposite of the melting wall, and footage is lost when Dir. Grey loses her balance and collides with the floor -- camera smashing on the stone below.// \n\n//<End Log>//\n\n[[/div]]\n------\nAfter the conclusion of the event, Director Grey and the two members of her staff would be found by those of Site-898 within the Red Brook Mine, and taken into the site. Upon inspection, none of the three were harmed in the event recorded despite its apparent violence and the mine itself did not appear to reflect the damages within the video transcript. RCT-Δt agents would arrive shortly after, resulting in a full site lockdown. The Site-46 staff present would be separated from the Site-898 staff, and both Directors were detained without explanation.\n------\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Audio Log 8946:**\nThe following is a recording of a conversation between Director Juliet Grey and Director Hellen Gibbs, immediately after detention. \n\nRecording and supervising was done by Temporal Agent Serinus Dávalos. [[footnote]] Codenamed as \"Agent Dryll\". [[/footnote]]\n------\n\n//<Recording Start>//\n\n//The two are sitting in a blank holding cell, sitting next to one another in front of an empty table. Dir. Gibbs glances at the clock on the wall, the clock indicates that they've been sitting in silence for the past five minutes.//\n\n//Dir. Grey is staring at her feet, clenched hands resting in her lap. She is still dressed in field attire PPE. Dir. Gibbs turns and looks at her, almost curiously.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I don't think I caught your name, before the TAD folks barged in.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Juliet Grey. //Director// Juliet Grey. \n\n//Dir. Grey does not look up. Regardless of this, Dir. Gibbs nods.// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Hellen Gibbs. Now, I'm curio--\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I don't know what's going on. So I don't think I can answer anything right now. Are we under arrest? //Time// arrest? \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Hard to say. I caught something about retrocausality, which probably makes sense since the time cops are on my doorstep as opposed to usual Foundation forces about this... occurrence. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** //[She puts her head in her hands]// Great. That's great.\n\n//There is a pause. Dir. Gibbs watches Dir. Grey for a few moments as she regains her composure.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** One of people who found us under your site said this place was founded in the //50s?// Is that... is that true?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Is that different than your recollection?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Very. I founded the Department in 2026.\n\n//There is a pause of silence.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Oh my. That is... quite the extreme gap. I'm surprised it took so long, for your version that is. What set it off?\n\n//Dir. Grey heaves a sigh, and casts her gaze to the side. She looks on edge.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7186 A deposit of obsidian in Australia that shouldn't be there.] We classified it as 7186, and it was a hellish mess to cover it up scientifically. Me and my team fought tooth and nail to do so -- and we ended up with the Department formed as a result. We built our site on it.\n\n//Dir. Gibbs nods.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** ...Fascinating. We don't -- er, perhaps //didn't// -- have an anomaly that matches that under our purview. Either we didn't find it, or--\n\n**Dir. Grey:** --it didn't exist here. The mines under this site, are they anomalous? We were checking them for possible activity when the change hits. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Ehh, sorta? Used to be, was why this place was built back in the late 60s -- but the phenomenon started to petter out in the 70s, and now it's only once and a blue moon.[[footnote]] Relevant file not found, database synchronization still in progress. [[/footnote]] //[Dir. Gibbs chuckles]// We primarily use it for tours, now. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Okay, um... rapid-fire comparisons? [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8186 The feeling you get when you look at a pretty rock.]\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** That's an anomaly?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Theorized. 8186. \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8007 The Ring of Fire is made of dragons.]\n\n**Dir. Grey:** When the hell did you find that out?\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Back in the 80s when St. Helens blew. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Well, if we're getting crazy with mountains, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5140 Mount Everest is 45% corpses.]\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Foolish climbers?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** No. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8144 It's the limestone.]\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Hm... okay maybe something simpler -- do you know [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-113 113]?\n\n//Dir. Grey perks up, which prompts Dir. Gibbs to give her a look of surprise.// \n\n**Dir. Grey:** The red jasper? \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Yeah, yeah that's the one. So... there may be some geological anomalies we share, and some we don't. I wonder if the throughline between them are our separate involvements. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** But that's-- I dunno, it seems impossible. Almost arbitrary! Why us? Why are we the only thing that's been affected? \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** It's, at the least, a theory worth investigating. I wonder how this'll affect the databases.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** I think that's why the timecops are on the scene, //[She gestures to one of the room's cameras]// whatever this is has probably made a mess of things. I think the database will depend on just... who's supposed to be here and who isn't. \n\n//Dir. Gibbs tilts her head.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Supposed to be here?\n\n**Dir. Grey:** As in like -- who is the original. Like, who's native to this world-- or timeline, or whatever it's called -- and who isn't. \n\n//There's a pause of silence, Dir. Gibbs observes Dir. Grey as she suddenly jolts her gaze down to staring at the floor again.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Sorry I'm just--\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Stressed? It's understandable, in a situation like this. I'd be lying if I wasn't, too. Honestly, I'm surprised you were out this far to begin with -- since you said your site was based in Australia. \n\n**Dir. Grey:** ...we're stretched thin. I had time to lead the investigation. Needed to get out of the site before I went stir crazy or something, anyways. We're overworked, low on staff, still starting out and now //this?//\n\n**Dir Gibbs:** You're worried about being replaced.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Of //course// I am! I founded this Department last year, and now one that's been around for //decades// has just popped up! Why the hell wouldn't I be? \n\n//There is a pause of silence between the two. She seems to realize her outburst, and frowns. Dir. Grey drops down her head and sighs.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** Sorry, sorry-- this is unbecoming of me. I just... I want to know if this is //my// \n timeline or not. And I just don't know-- //[Her eyes widen]// wait. Wait, wait, wait--\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Mm? \n\n**Dir. Grey:** Wait. Maybe we're overcomplicating this whole thing. What year was it last you checked? For me it was 2027.\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** 2014. Which makes a bit of sense, none of our dates line up, so it'd make sense that we'd have different ones.\n\n**Dir. Grey:** But what year is it //actually?// \n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** I don't think we'd have a way to check from in here, we'd need--\n\n//The door on the side of the room opens, and Temporal Agent Dryll enters the room. They're squinting down at a clipboard, with a pair of reading glasses on.// \n\n**Agent Dryll:** Hey-- the boss wants to speak to you two. \n\n//The two Directors turn to face them.//\n\n**Dir. Gibbs:** Well, you have good timing.\n\n**Agent Dryll:** It's uh, a bit necessary in this line of work. \n\n//They give a terse laugh, then sniffles audibly. Dir. Grey leans forward in her chair.//\n\n**Dir. Grey:** What year is it. \n\n//Agent Dryll blinks, checks a device on their arm, then shrugs.//\n\n**Agent Dryll:** 2017. \n\n//Silence on recording. Dir. Gibbs tilts her head, and Dir. Grey grips her own arm tightly -- staring at Agent Dryll.//\n\n//<End Log>//\n[[/div]]\n------\nThe discovered discontinuity between recalled dates, and the apparent current date, was relayed to Captain Regina Watts.[[footnote]] Tactical Operations Command Team Lead, head supervisor of SCP-8946.[[/footnote]] These verbal accounts were consistent with that of the databases of both sites -- while the present date is 15/12/2017, Site-898’s database last contains data from 2014, and Site-46’s database has data pertaining to 2027.\n\nIn spite of this, all relevant files and anomalies have been found to be present within the world, even if their discovery has not actually occurred as depicted within their files. \n\nIt has been determined that SCP-8946 is likely some form of retrocausal anomaly, and has caused this apparent discontinuity within the Department of Geology.\n\nResearch into the cause and nature of SCP-8946, as well as its implications, is currently in progress.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"table2 tableb\"]]\n||~ According to internal records, an alternate version of this file exists within the timeline. ||\n||= To view **Iteration B**, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8946/offset/1 click here]. ||\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@",
