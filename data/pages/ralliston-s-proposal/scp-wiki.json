Being an only son, he was always meant to inherit the family fortune and their industrial empire consisting of numerous [[[SCP-6789|industrial plants]]] once the current holders -- his father and mother -- inevitably died. Highly interested in the history of Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) and [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]] (//Homo sapiens noctis//) ever since his childhood, Rollander had always shown an above-average intelligence, near-perfect memory, and skill in obtaining historical information otherwise thought to be undiscoverable.\n\nHowever, when a majority of his family died under unexplained circumstances in 1888 during a fatal shipboard incident (for which he was not present, but had personally financed), PoI-001-A donated all of his stocks and buildings to an unknown thaumaturgic cabal operating in the USA.\n\nThe next day James Rollander was seen leaving America with a ship headed for Great Britain, later traveling to (at that time occupied) Poland. Witnesses of the event reported the man acting highly paranoid and erratic, as if he were afraid someone was observing him, and holding an unidentified tome within his hands. Having disappeared for approximately 10 years following the conclusion of his travels, he reappeared in 1898 near Kraków, Poland, with the construction of SCP-001-A starting shortly after.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-001-A is an industrial megastructure located 25 kilometers south of Kraków, Poland, founded and overseen by James Rollander. Acting as the main provider of a plethora of services to the entire country and most of the continent, it currently houses approximately 30 000 laborers working and living within its confines. Atop its gates the following sentence, written in the Fae language, can be seen:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nThe Factory hungers, as the Queen’s move has become her last gambit. Do not leave it in famine.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-001-B is a room located within SCP-001-A, which can only be found once an individual expresses the wish to find it, be it willingly or subconsciously. So far, attempts to mark it in relation to any other rooms or landmarks within the structure have been unsuccessful; inevitably, all individuals coming into contact with it will describe drastically different details of the place and the path which led them to it.\n\nSCP-001-C is an entity located within SCP-001-B, fed by human sacrifices delivered to it by PoI-001-A. Further details regarding its nature are presently unavailable.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-001-A was constructed by a currently unidentified group of individuals or force between 1898-1902; no formal records regarding the process of construction exist. Created as the \"ultimate factory,\" it was meant to supply every single possible industrial need of the people.\n\nSCP-001-A gained Foundation attention in 1908 after exceedingly high levels of thaumaturgic energy were intercepted from it. This energy did not fade over time, instead remaining at a consistently high level. Now theorized to be the date of origin for SCP-001-B, this event sparked a visible period of the highest productivity to date, ultimately resulting in unprecedented profits and the expansion of Rollander's nascent empire.\n\nTo eliminate the possibility that the event was merely a coincidence precipitated by the building's potentially anomalous location, further research was approved. This resulted in the discovery of the ruins of numerous palaces and city structures in the caverns below the factory. Dated at approximately 200 000 years old, they were immediately identified as structures formed by the Fae Empire prior to its fall.[[footnote]] For a full briefing regarding the history of this group, refer to Addendum 001-2. [[/footnote]] Despite their anomalous properties, it was later discovered that they had been uninvolved with the event, which had instead been the result of some form of ritual conducted within SCP-001-A.\n\nFollowing these discoveries, the Foundation officially classified SCP-001-A as its first full high-priority project following the adoption of the 'SCP' classification, resulting in it acquiring the designation of SCP-001.\n\n**Addendum 001-1:** SCP-001-A Exploration\n\nIn light of the thaumaturgic energy's failure to fade, the O5 Council decided that more information regarding SCP-001-A was required. As no SCP-001-A personnel were noted leaving the factory within the previous month, a Foundation-organized exploration mission was orchestrated.\n\nHowever, upon entry into the factory, the Task Force immediately lost contact with the Foundation.\n\n**Addendum 001-2:** SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis\n\nFollowing the loss of contact with previous exploration missions, it was decided that further exploration attempts would inevitably end the same way. In order to still obtain further potential information regarding SCP-001, research into the nature and origin of the ruins underneath the factory was immediately approved. The following is a statement by the project's research head following numerous months of focused investigation, released on 14/12/1909. Prior to reading it, personnel are heavily advised to familiarize themselves with the documentation available in the sidebox next to it to understand its full context.\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n[[=]]\n**The Two Great Diasporas**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=o5-4.jpg|align=right|caption=O5-4, circa 1904.|width=250px]]\n\nThe following is a full timeline of the history of human, Fae, and Children of Night conflicts and all events leading to the Two Great Diasporas, as compiled by O5-4. As most of the historical records acting as evidence for these events are either extremely old or severely damaged, precise Gregorian Calendar dates cannot be traced. Approximate dates are given instead.\n\n* [UNKNOWN] -- consensus baseline reality achieves stability as the result of numerous religious faiths being simultaneously true (due to human belief bestowing power upon them). \"Old Gods\" and numerous other deific entities presumably responsible for the creation and destruction of the era fade away, leaving Earth to its own machinations -- no further outside influence on history is noted from this point forth.\n\n* 300 000 years BCE -- humans, Fae, and Children of the Night emerge as the three dominant species on the planet, evolving from one (currently unknown) common evolutionary predecessor. As humans live in the plains during the day, the Fae hide in the forests where nature reigns; the remaining Nightwalkers exist in caverns.\n\n* 280 000 years BCE -- Queen Mab and her sister (name unknown -- all references are anomalously expunged from the record, with similar energy markings to the **##green|removal of one's name##**) are born. Utilizing their nigh-limitless ontokinetic and thaumaturgic abilities, they establish a vast empire, connecting all Fae as one nation ruled by the two. Children of the Night create numerous underground cities, and humans remain as nomadic tribes.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=seal.png|align=right|caption=A tentative recreation of the seal of the Fae Empire.|width=250px]]\n\n* 275 000 years BCE -- as the two queens' control over their abilities grows to near full understanding, the Fae empire expands worldwide, taking control over both humans and Nightwalkers. The former are put into gigantic habitats, unaware of their situation and observed by Fae royalty as entertainment, whilst the latter's cities are destroyed and their inhabitants sent to the darkness of the mines to work as slaves. The divide between the Fae poor and the aristocrats grows exponentially as the royalty gains power through the exploitation of the working class, treated similarly to the prisoners.\n\n* 240 000 years BCE -- an all-out war between the two factions of the Fae empire breaks out, with Queen Mab and her sister standing on opposite sides, divided by moral issues. Utilizing her vastly greater power of ontokinetic abilities and the skill to take away Names, Mab swings the conflict in favor of the Fae royalty. Exploiting the chaos, Children of the Night break free, uniting with humanity and eventually bringing the conflict to the end by raiding the palaces of the royalty. [[[a-faerie-tale-of-twin-queens|Mab murders her sister]]], but temporarily loses her power in the process, allowing for the rebellion to eliminate her. The Fae empire falls, with its subjects scattering around the globe. Children of the Night become the dominant species, ending the First Great Diaspora.\n\n* 220 000 years BCE -- the Nightwalkers create vast, technologically advanced metropolises, coexisting harmoniously with nature. Humanity once again becomes a protected, zoo-like species. Through unknown means, Queen Mab survives between several afterlives, eventually gaining insight into baseline reality.\n\n* 210 000 years BCE -- Queen Mab persuades humanity to overthrow the Children of the Night, lending them some of her remaining power. Together with the remaining Fae, humanity and its newfound allies destroys the SCP-1000 civilization, eventually wiping their memories of the event. The Second Great Diaspora, also referred to as the Day of the Flowers, makes humanity the dominant species. The remaining Fae scatter across the globe, maintaining an extremely low population, hiding in the forests to not allow Mab to gain further control.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ SCP-001-A Ruins Analysis\n+++++ {{A paper by O5-4[[footnote]] Foundation history expert, specializing in the history of the anomalous. [[/footnote]]}}\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=caverns.png|align=right|caption=A section of the SCP-001-A Ruins.|width=350px]]\n\nWhen I first arrived at the dig site beneath SCP-001-A, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't expecting the usual findings -- that being yet another gigantic ruined palace of Mab, brought down by the furious First Diasporans desperately trying to find the monster behind their suffering. And, in a sense, I //was right//; the building //was// in fact yet another fortress of the devil Mab is, but this time it was... different. What we found was, frankly, shocking.\n\nOne room after another, we uncovered the secrets that place had held for so many millennia after the First Slaughter, and, well, after months of relentless work and making sure our interpretations were accurate, we have to come to one final conclusion that we are almost afraid to mutter: she still breathes somewhere outside our reality, biding her time. Just like her sibling.\n\nWe've always thought the other died, trying to stop her monstrous sister -- however, evidence recovered from the SCP-001-A ruins singlehandedly debunks this. We checked all our calculations and interpretations to make sure we're not wrong, for this could change //everything//.\n\nWhat's even more shocking is that the sister is not only alive, but also //active//; just like Mab has her own cults trying to find a ritual capable of resurrecting her, so does the sibling. We however discovered something even more alarming: the names of the sisters. Not true names, of course, for the second sister does not even own hers anymore -- but we //did// discover... half-names, would be the best way to put it. Words not fully describing the very being of a person, as true Fae names do, but descriptors of important parts of their personalities. For Mab, long associated with lies and deceit, it was \"shvygh\" and \"shfijifæ,\" meaning \"queen\" and \"starlight\" respectively, but for the sister, associated with creation and aid, \"nv̄nvŋ́nfat\" and \"pitfḿje,\" which, upon translation, meant \"inventor\" and... \"factory.\"\n\nWhat's even more alarming is the event that led to the thaumaturgic energy explosion within SCP-001-A. You see, upon further inspection, my teams discovered many truly bizarre signs: high Akiva radiation, as well as a single sentence woven into the rituals binding the room that would eventually become SCP-001-B into our reality:\n\n> Come, Inventor; come, our Factory. The Queen is ready. Do not leave her waiting.\n\nAnd so, it appears, Rollander quite literally called forth a factory. A factory to resurrect //the true// Factory through regular human sacrifice.\n\nIdentical ritual parts were detected in the magic which created the factory in the first place. What's more, my men report the feeling that these two rituals were merely two parts of a three-act performance. Whatever the hell Rollander did to bring his masterpiece and the room within to life was merely preparation for bringing a third thing, this time presumably an entity, from within it and into our reality.\n\nMab has been a danger lurking behind our backs for almost 40 years now, ever since we founded ourselves in those dark halls, swearing to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora that would bring us down again. We did everything we could to stop Mab's influence, but let's face it: our best magicians won't even form a fraction of the power that devil possesses. But the sister does. And we need to do everything in our power to use that to our advantage.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I believe SCP-001-B isn't merely a room -- it's a //throne// room, designed to host royalty. Whatever god resides there -- and let's call it SCP-001-C, for simplicity's sake -- I can feel its hatred for Mab pumping through the veins of the Factory, coming from the pounding heart seated within. And  I know only of one entity that hates Mab more than the Nightwalkers.\n\nWe must use this opportunity as best as we can, unless we wish for another genocide to hit, this time targetting //us//.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 001-3:** Further Research and Changes\n\nTwo months following the conclusion of the SCP-001-A ruins research, the news regarding it was apparently leaked by an unknown individual to the worldwide anomalous community. Numerous rumors resulted, and as a result, Fae militia organizations were seen taking interest in the factory. This news reached the ever-growing group supporting Mab's actions and planning her resurrection.\n\nIn the coming weeks, their squads were noted to patrol the outskirts of the factory, apparently seeking to gain access. Successfully doing so, they were then seen sabotaging SCP-001-A, resulting in significant damage to the building. To counteract this action, Rollander decided to double the sacrifice rate towards SCP-001-C, resulting in an extremely high disappearance rate among workers within Kraków and surrounding cities. This led to local authorities gaining interest in the case. To counteract a possible Veil-breaking event, on 03/02/1910, the Administrator sent the following urgent message to Rollander:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nHonorable James Rollander,\n\nWe are aware of your actions within your factory, and, whilst we realize and appreciate your intentions of keeping Mab at bay through the resurrection of the Inventor, we must ask for an immediate cessation of such activities. We realize that you are left with no other option than to increase your sacrifices following the attacks, but we simply cannot allow you to continue doing so; the only alternative you realistically have is to properly deal with the attacks and continue your work at a normal pace. We hope you will understand our concerns and express a wish to cooperate, for we //will// engage with force otherwise.\n\n[[>]]\nWith respect,\n//-- Kraków authorities//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTwo days later, the following reply was received by the O5 Council; how PoI-001-A was aware of the location of its members remains unknown.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSilence, foul creatures of darkness. My noble heart shan't listen to your laughable heresies -- I can hear the Queen speaking through your words. And, I want you to know one thing -- I am no Starlight's servant. I swore loyalty to only one Inventor, to one brilliant mind illuminating the skies with its genius like your Star had never had. I forgive your vengeful hearts serving Mab, for the creator forgives, unlike your Queen. Begone, whilst your armies can still walk.\n\nMy Masterpiece is almost done, and I shan't stop with its preparations -- if you wish for a war with our magic, then you shall have it. The Factory is almost ready to emerge, and once it does, her brilliance shall overpower the darkness your Empress wished for the entire world. You cannot stop the rituals feeding Her, for the Inventor can feel your every move. She whispers to my ear, illuminating my mind with a portion of its brilliance, and I know of all you do -- of your horrid servitude to the betrayer of the men of this Earth.\n\nMay the Skies above us have mercy on you.\n\nYou will not stop us.\n[[/div]]\n\nImmediately after, PoI-001-A took the following actions:\n* tripled the intake of workers to SCP-001-A, effectively resulting in the tripling of the ratio of the rituals feeding SCP-001-C;\n* neutralized numerous Mab-aligned Fae organizations, bringing their bodies into SCP-001-A for purposes unknown;\n* utilized numerous thaumaturgic rituals within SCP-001-A, disallowing entry into the building without his direct permission;\n* hastened the shipment of unknown thaumaturgic and theological apparatus into the factory.\n\nRealizing the only way to neutralize the threat of the breaking of the Veil due to Rollander's actions whilst still maintaining the protection from PoI-001-C was taking control of SCP-001-A, Overwatch Command had undertaken the following vote:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Proposal:** \"Utilize Foundation resources to seize SCP-001-C from James Rollander and establish a Site within. Effectively gain control over the protection from PoI-001-C offered by sacrifices to SCP-001-C whilst still maintaining the secretive nature of the SCP Foundation's operations.\"\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ ADMINISTRATOR'S NOTE[[footnote]] Added to the documentation as per his direct request. [[/footnote]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nWhen, all those years ago, I brought the thirteen talented mages and theologists that would eventually become my Council before myself, I swore one thing -- to never resort to meaningless violence. For all those 40 years we've operated together now, I stayed true to my promise -- even if I was among the few of us that //did// keep it, I kept it. Never have I approved an operation that would result in the deaths of people who didn't need to die for the world to become safe. But times have changed.\n\nIf you'd told me 40 years ago I would be approving, nay, even //suggesting// a military raid that would result in the deaths of factory workers to contain a single threat, I'd call you a madman. But it must be done. We simply cannot allow ourselves to lose the only known mechanism to defend against Mab in the entire universe. We must strike quickly and ruthlessly, because we need to keep Mab away from baseline reality, no matter what it takes. Such are the demands the greater good makes upon us, no matter our personal opinions.\n\nI'm truly sorry, but there is no other way.\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n= **Council Vote Summary:**\n\n||~ **YEA** ||~ **NAY** ||~ **ABS.** ||\n||= **O5-**1 || || ||\n||  ||= **O5-2** || ||\n||= **O5-3** || || ||\n||  || ||= **O5-4** ||\n||= **O5-5** || || ||\n||  ||= **O5-6** || ||\n|| ||= **O5-7** || ||\n||= **O5-8** || || ||\n||= **O5-9** || || ||\n||  ||= **O5-10** || ||\n||  || ||= **O5-11** ||\n|| ||= **O5-12** || ||\n||= **O5-13** || || ||\n@@ @@\n||||~ ADDITIONAL VOTE||\n|| **ADMINISTRATOR** || **YEA** ||\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| **##green|APPROVED##** (7-5-2) ||\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Result:** Following the vote, the operation was slated to take place as quickly as possible.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 001-4:** SCP-001-A Raid\n\nFollowing the mobilization of all available Foundation forces within the area of SCP-001-A, on 27/02/1910, the SCP Foundation officially began a military attack on SCP-001-A. The following is a transcript of [ERROR]'s only memory of the event, verified as safe for public viewing due to numerous memetic triggers present within his memory, as provided by a ritual conducted by Maria Jones.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=o5-8.png|align=right|caption=O5-8, circa 1903.|width=250px]]\n\n**Date:** 27/02/1910\n\n**Subject:** SCP-001-A\n\n**Present Parties:**\n* PoI-001-A;\n* [ERROR];[[footnote]] fatal terminal error: no Administrator name designation encountered **{{@[DATA LOST]}}** [[/footnote]]\n* O5-4;\n* O5-8.\n\n**Foreword:** Due to the protective field set-up within [ERROR]'s memories, the following was the only memetic-trigger-free memory of the event available for harvest without causing damage to its host.

Her hands are extended widely, just 5 centimeters away from the doors to the room, and she is visibly struggling in deep focus. She opens her deep and burning purple eyes[[footnote]] Natural sign of a fully-realized Class III or above reality bender. [[/footnote]] and, with a silent scream, tears the doors apart, revealing entry into the office. Panting, she nods towards the rest of the group, made up of [ERROR] and O5-4, and they enter into it.//\n\n//The room is extremely large and packed with numerous bookcases, chests, and containers, with magical items of unknown purpose scattered throughout. In the corner, behind a large wooden desk, Rollander is cowering. He is shivering, with a shadow formation akin to a crown forming above his head. Sobbing, in a panicked state, he attempts to hide from the intruders behind the chair.//\n\n**O5-8:** //<in a powerful tone:>// **JAMES JOSEPH ROLLANDER.**\n\n//PoI-001-A screams, falling to the ground. The shadows above him start to disappear; noticing this, Rollander panics. He attempts to grab the formation, but fails, eventually losing all of it. He starts to scour the floor around him, looking for something, frantically talking to himself but finding nothing.//\n\n//O5-8 comes closer, extending her hand. Rollander notices this, and widens his eyes.//\n\n**Rollander:** No no no no no, no no. No. No no, no!\n\n**O5-8:** **COME FORWARD, AND ANSWER FOR YOUR CRIMES.**\n\n//Rollander throws a book at Eight, who easily deflects it with ontokinesis. She comes closer yet again, and snaps her fingers. PoI-001-A starts to levitate, unable to move.//\n\n**Rollander:** No! //<weakly:>// She... she said... it will end... differently...\n\n//Eight smiles, clenching her fist. Rollander starts to choke, grabbing his throat in a panicked manner, but seconds later falls on the ground, his eyes burning with a bright green. He frees himself of the power holding him back through unknown means, moving towards O5-8.//\n\n**Rollander:** //<in a hoarse tone:>// THE LIGHT OF THE THOUSAND-DAWN EMPIRE SHALL NOT F-- AGH!\n\n//He blinks, suddenly falling to the ground again. When he reopens his eyes, they are normal, and he does not seem to realize what just happened. Eight groans, throwing him like a ragdoll onto the wall. Her nose starts to bleed profusely.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** Mary, I think that's eno--\n\n//Eight screams in anger as she throws PoI-001-A around the room, smashing him against any and all obstacles in her path.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** THAT'S ENOUGH!\n\n//The overseer suddenly stops, panting aggressively. She is bleeding from every orifice, but does not seem to notice nor care. Instead, with visible exhaustion in her eyes, she turns towards [ERROR].//\n\n**[ERROR]:** //<quietly:>// What the fuck was that? What the hell's gotten into you?! You were supposed to //not// kill him, for god's sake, we can't just murder people!\n\n**O5-8:** //You// can't murder people.\n\n//Eight grabs herself by the head, groaning silently.//\n\n**O5-8:** God, I... I don't know, I... //Something// here is... I... I...\n\n//They are suddenly interrupted by O5-4 grabbing the half-alive Rollander by his jacket, pulling his face close. Four spits on him. Rollander does not react, silently sobbing.//\n\n**O5-4:** You... disgust me.\n\n//Four heads for the exit, carrying the broken PoI-001-A with him. However, as he is about to reach the rest of the group, Rollander's body suddenly explodes with shadows and smoke, causing the Overseer to drop him. Four screams, backing off, as a singular, burning green eye blinks from within the expanding smoke.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** //<coming from within the smoke, in a hoarse tone:>// COME HOME, MY CHILD. COME HOME AND SUFFER NO MORE.\n\n//The smoke suddenly clears, revealing that PoI-001-A's body has disappeared; where it once laid, only his clothing remains to be seen. O5-4 inhales sharply, and turns towards the rest of the group.//\n\n**O5-4:** [ERROR]?\n\n**[ERROR]:** Yes?\n\n**O5-4:** Tell the people the factory has fallen.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n-----\n**Afterword:** Following the events described above, the SCP Foundation had officially taken control of the factory.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nTo fully discuss further actions following the above, a summit of the O5 Council was called. Further containment and research plans regarding SCP-001 were discussed, eventually landing on  the necessity of a Site within the anomaly's proximity to properly contain it. As a result, a proposal was put forward by O5-1 to, over a long period of time, transform the gigantic structure of SCP-001-A into a Foundation Site, acting as the main hub of operations for the Council and its most important project: SCP-001.\n\n**Addendum 001-5:** Further SCP-001 Research\n\n[[include component:image-block name=abandoned.jpg|align=right|caption=SCP-001-A, pictured midway through its transformation into Site-01.|width=325px]]\n\n\nFollowing the stabilization of the threat of potential civilian discovery of SCP-001-A due to Rollander's decisions and the finalization of Site-01's construction, the O5 Council decided that research into the true nature of SCP-001-B and SCP-001-C as well as the latter's protective nature against PoI-001-C was a priority. Despite previous studies showcasing the fact that SCP-001-C is most likely the half-dead entity referred to as 'The Inventor', further study conducted by O5-4 and his teams revealed that the entity was connected to numerous Fae seers and thaumaturgists in the world, still capable of communication.\n\nHowever, despite the aforementioned stabilization, attacks from local Queen Mab-affiliated militias did not stop, instead increasing in frequency; the Foundation attempted contact with said groups on numerous occasions, but the only answer ever received was the following:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nYou will //not// bring her back. Not after everything we've done to try to stop it.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nChatter picked up by Foundation moles situated within communities around the world suggested that a \"Fae army, like the world has never seen since the dawn of Mab\" was gathering to attack SCP-001-A. Initially dismissed as mere rumors, this eventually led to the Foundation tripling security measures around Site-01 after numerous previously stationary Fae groups went on the move. Further research into this phenomenon remained pending at the time.\n\nIn the meantime, research into SCP-001-C was officially approved. After months of analysis, it was officially confirmed that following sacrifices to SCP-001-C being done, the percent of Queen Mab's entire being existing in baseline reality did in fact seem to reduce from 5% to 4%, rendering all previous interpretations to be true.\n\nIn order to utilize the fact that SCP-001-C, presumed to be Queen Mab's sibling, was still alive and able to communicate, the following tests were undertaken.\n\n||~ INPUT ||~ OUTPUT||\n|| A singular red apple (//Malus domestica//), delivered to SCP-001-B through thaumaturgic rituals || No results ||\n|| A singular red apple (//Malus domestica//), delivered to SCP-001-B through a D-Class personnel || Three seconds following input, the following phrase was heard in the minds of all near Site-01 personnel: \"MORE\" ||\n|| A singular, already dead, dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//) || \"FRESH BLOOD\" ||\n|| A singular living dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//) || \"MORE\" ||\n|| A singular alive D-Class personnel || \"I AM THE CALL OF THE HEAVENS, BRINGING DOWN GIFTS OF INTELLECT TO THE MINDS OF THE WORTHY\" ||\n|| Repeat of the above || \"I FEND OFF THE EVILS OF DARKNESS AND FEAR, LURKING IN THE SHADOWS OF STARLIGHT\" ||\n|| Repeat of the above || \"I AM THE SENTRY, THE SHIELD AGAINST ALL THAT LIES WITHIN THE LAND OF DARKNESS\" ||\n|| Repeat of the above || No results ||\n|| Repeat of the above || No results ||\n|| Three alive D-Class personnel || \"MY POWER FADES LIKE STARLIGHT IN THE NIGHT MY SISTER IS, BUT IT STILL GRASPS INTO THIS REALM\" ||\n|| Repeat of the above ||  \"BUT IT SHAN'T FOR MUCH LONGER, FOR THE SERVANT OF DEATH IS STRONG.

The ritual was nearing completion, with the portal approximated to contain individuals numbering in the thousands; a 2-hour window to prepare for the army's arrival was projected. When evacuation was ordered, the area around the building was almost immediately cut off via a thaumaturgic barrier. Numerous anti-magic apparatus set up around the Site did not appear to slow the ritual.\n\nA Site-wide alert was immediately called, with the entire Council immediately evacuated to the lower levels and appropriate personnel called to duty. A distress call to other Foundation Sites was attempted, but due to no such facilities existing within Poland, no aid was possible within the given time span. Site-01 staff began to prepare for the incoming attack, attempting to eavesdrop on the teleporting army's conversations, yielding the below result.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Foreword:** Due to high ritual instability, most of the intercepted and translated Fae dialogue is heavily corrupted.\n\n-----\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**[UNKNOWN 1]:** //[unintelligible]// I'm trying to say is that we //[unintelligible]// cannot allow them to bring //[unintelligible]// back, no matter the co--\n\n**[UNKNOWN 2]:** I //know// that, //[unintelligible]//; that doesn't mean we //[unintelligible]// can disobey **##green|her##**; this //[unintelligible]// insanity.

He is no longer within the same space he'd occupied minutes ago, now lying on the cold floors of a short corridor ending in gigantic green doors, which stand open.

From within the room beyond, a silent whisper akin to that of an animal fills the air.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** COME.\n\n//[ERROR] is lifted from his sitting spot, suddenly starting to walk towards the room. Unconsciously he walks into it, and the entire feed becomes filled with the smoke, obscuring vision.

Wipe them out like the maggots they are, bringing back my dominion over them once again, like the-- I... I...\n\n//[ERROR] begins to sob again, grabbing his head. His face turns expressionless only seconds after.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** AND WHO ARE YOUR ENEMIES?\n\n**[ERROR]:** The servants of the Queen, the zealots of the Eternal Starlight upon the skies of the Endless Kingdom, wishing to bring their monster back from the dead.\n\n//The myriad eyes suddenly start to smile.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** THEN IT SHALL BE DONE.\n\n----\n= **[CORRUPTED MEMORIES REDACTED]**\n----\n\n//[ERROR] is suddenly standing on the balcony directly above SCP-001-A's entry,[[footnote]] SCP-001-A was, previously, not seen to have such a feature. [[/footnote]] with O5-2 and O5-8 beside him. His eyes are burning with a green light, and in his hands, a long stone similar in shape to a wand can be seen. He is pointing it at the open hills beneath him, upon which thousands of Fae are standing with various forms of weaponry in their hands. [ERROR] smiles, and starts to speak, his deafening voice filling the horizon.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** ARMY OF STARLIGHT, HARBINGERS OF MONARCHY, AND OMENS OF DOOM.

Animal-like cries can be heard as the countless vocalizing Fae fall on the ground, screaming in agony as their bodies start to transform into numerous animal-like humanoid beings, retaining their original clothing. In the middle of the vortex, a portal black as night appears, sucking those present into it as more and more of them sob in pain, their transformations continuing. Seconds later, a number greater than what was originally standing in the hills falls into the forming hole as the portal leading to an [[[taboo|unknown place]]] closes, leaving [[[they-had-names|no one standing in front of SCP-001-A]]]. A silent scream fills the local area as the sky smiles for a second, before blinking again into nonexistence.//\n\n//O5-2 looks at [ERROR], with a terrified expression filling his mechanical face.//\n\n**O5-2:** {{WHAT...

Further research into the consequences of this action as well as the true destination of the ritual is ongoing.\n[[/div]]\n\nTo discuss the consequences of the above, an emergency O5 Council meeting hosted at Site-01 was called two weeks later, following the finalization of the clean-up required by the results of the raid. The following is its record, as transcribed by Maria Jones.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 27/08/1911\n\n**Parties Present:**\n* [ERROR];\n* O5-2;\n* O5-4;\n* O5-5;\n* O5-11;\n* Maria Jones.\n\n**Foreword:** Due to the state of their health or their outright death following the Site-01 raid, a majority of the O5 Council was unable to attend the following meeting. At that time, potential replacements for the positions of O5-7, O5-9,[[footnote]] This position remained vacant for the longest time, with its replacement only being found on [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|02/04/1973]]]. [[/footnote]]O5-10, and O5-12, were being sought out.\n\n-----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//The transcript begins, showing Site-01's O5 Council meeting hall, adapted from Rollander's office to fit its new purpose. Of the fourteen seats around the gigantic table in the middle, only five are filled. Upon the table, now visibly damaged, rests a multitude of letters and documents. O5-4 is browsing them quickly, trying to read as much as he can. The other Council members and Maria Jones are visibly impatient, as if waiting for someone.//\n\n//Minutes later, the doors to the room open, revealing [ERROR]. He nods to the Council, corrects his suit, and checks his watch. O5-4 notices him, standing up from his chair and walking towards him angrily.//\n\n**O5-4:** What... What have you done?\n\n//[ERROR] does not respond, instead coming towards the table. He grabs one of the chairs and sits in it, looking at the documents around him. O5-4 comes closer, shaking [ERROR]'s shoulders.//\n\n**O5-4:** //What the fuck have you done?!//\n\n//[ERROR] sighs.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** Chosen the lesser evil.\n\n//O5-4 scoffs, slightly backing off.//\n\n**O5-4:** You're insane.

Four falls, spitting blood on the floor. [ERROR] turns his sight from the floor to the Overseer. His eyes glow with a faint green, and, above his head, for a brief second, a shadow formation reminiscent of a crown forms, only to disappear moments later. He comes closer to O5-4, grabbing him by his jacket and bringing their faces close together.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** Insult me one more time.\n\n//Four backs off, again attempting to strike [ERROR], but he is interrupted by O5-2 standing up slowly from the table and turning towards the two of them.//\n\n**O5-2:** {{GENTLEMEN, I DO NOT BELIEVE VIOLENCE IS PRODUCTIVE IN OUR SITUAT--}}\n\n//Four looks angrily at Two.

Present (from left to right): O5-3, O5-7, [/the-holiday-special General Joseph Armstrong], O5-9, O5-13, Prof. Crow Senior, O5-6, Archalchemist Weber, and O5-1.]]\n\nOriginally founded in 1870 following the conclusion of the Sixth Occult War as an evolution of a group researching thaumaturgy, theology, and the history of the Two Great Diasporas, created by some of the thirteen of the richest and most influential men and women of their time, led by one individual -- [ERROR]. The SCP Foundation was created with three goals in mind: to Secure the human population from Fae and SCP-1000 attacks, Contain the threat of Queen Mab and the gods of the ancient past, and Protect humanity from a Third Great Diaspora. The Foundation's motto would eventually be adapted from these goals.\n\nPrior to the 1870 summit, plans to integrate the numerous subgroups into one organization were passed among the leaders who would eventually comprise the original O5 Council. Only following that year's discovery that Queen Mab was still alive, however, prompted by research made due to the conclusion of the aforementioned war, was it officially signed. This single discovery proved that research alone wouldn't be enough to deal with the existential threats hanging above humanity, and that a containment policy limiting their spread would eventually become necessary.\n\nOn 29/12/1870, the SCP Foundation was officially created following approval from thirteen consenting parties, as proposed and later led by [ERROR], who gained the position of Administrator by unanimous decision.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n **O5-4:** We swore to protect humanity from a Third Diaspora when we banded together those forty years ago,[[footnote]] For full context regarding the founding of the SCP Foundation, refer to the summary available in the sidebox.

Espionage and betrayal amongst Foundation personnel has increased by almost 10%, with overall efficiency down by approximately 40% even two years after the event.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the post-Diaspora period a severe decrease in the mental stability of numerous Foundation staff, including Maria Jones and [ERROR], has been noted. The most notable case is the aforementioned Administrator, seen engaging in highly uncharacteristic behavior while denying any personal peculiarity. Examples included, but were not limited to:\n\n* erratic decisions without authorization from the rest of the Council;\n* visible obsession with the occult, despite little to no previous interest in such;\n* visible obsession with Fae history, despite little to no previous interest in such;\n* paranoia and trust issues;\n* patterns of talking to himself on seemingly nonsensical subjects.\n\nSaid behavior culminated on 30/12/1913 when [ERROR] disappeared, the only evidence left being the following note found on his desk:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n'It' had never been the Inventor. How could I have been so blind?\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe only contextual evidence Foundation thaumaturgists have found is an almost unnoticeable mark of magic leading towards SCP-001-B from [ERROR]'s office. The following is the only memory visualization available in the thaumaturgic thoughtspace near SCP-001-B that in any way references the event.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** Unknown\n\n**Subject:** Unknown\n\n**Foreword:** The truthfulness of the following is still pending approval from the rest of the O5 Council.\n\n-----\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[ERROR] is standing in a short and dimly lit corridor, panting.

The entire area is filled with fog and sounds of clockwork turning in the background, as well as voices similar to those of former SCP-001-A workers.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** You... m-monster!\n\n//He comes closer, opening the doors with visible difficulty. As he finishes doing so, powerful wind starts to blow from inside, making him back off. He points the item at the inside of the room, from which green fog is rolling into the area around him.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** We... we //fed// you!\n\n//The sound of something stirring within the room fills the air as [ERROR] grabs his head in his hands. He screams with pain, falling on the floor. [UNKNOWN] laughs.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** What... what even //are// you?!\n\n//[ERROR] loses his words, breaking down in tears. He loses hold of the stone, letting it fall on the ground as his entire body shivers.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** //<chuckles>// DOES THAT EVEN TRULY MATTER?\n\n//[ERROR] is suddenly lifted from the ground as green fills his eyes, making him scream. As he continues to do so, he is transported into SCP-001-B.//\n\n**[UNKNOWN]:** COME.\n\n//From underneath [ERROR]'s jacket, animal-like fur starts to explode, eventually filling his entire body. His face distorts, visibly deforming. His continued screaming eventually turns into the gurgling of a hog. He tries to reach for an exit, grabbing one of the doors, but his hands slip away as they turn into hooves. He eventually loses all voice, but the screaming continues as his now fully-converted body begins to twitch violently. The feed disconnects.//\n\n**[END LOG]**\n----\n**Afterword:** No such individual with the name \"[ERROR]\" was ever a part of the Foundation's personnel. Following a second appearance of such an error following the initial SCP-001-A exploration and the above event, it was decided that it was the effect of SCP-001-C and should be ignored to maintain documentation logic.\n\nDue to months of no contact with [ERROR] (likely the previous name for the Foundation's Administrator), as well as the nature of the above event, he was presumed dead.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 001-8:** Post-Incident Stabilization Attempts\n\nAs requested by the remaining members of Overwatch Command, now not limited by [ERROR]'s influence, further research into the consequences of the Third Diaspora revealed that despite the 85% of the previously existing Fae populace being murdered, the remaining 15% did not fade, instead forming communities within Nexuses and Free Ports around the globe. No contact with them was attempted at the time of discovery, for obvious reasons.\n\nFollowing the death of [ERROR] in unknown circumstances at the hands of SCP-001-C, the position of the Administrator remained vacant for a significant period of time; to properly deal with this problem as well as the consequences of the Third Diaspora following the death of its perpetrator, a meeting of the O5 Council was called. The following is its transcript, as provided by Maria Jones.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=o5-11.jpg|align=right|caption=O5-11, circa 1880.|width=280px]]\n\n**Date:** 25/07/1914\n\n**Parties Present:**\n* O5-1;\n* O5-2;\n* O5-3;\n* O5-4;\n* O5-5;\n* O5-8;\n* O5-11;\n* O5-13;\n* Maria Jones.\n\n**Foreword:** As, at the time of recording, the position of Administrator remained vacant, no supreme leadership over the Foundation was granted to any individual; despite this, the Council unanimously agreed a summit was necessary, without any outside pressure to attend.\n-----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//O5-11 enters into the now-fully renewed hall of the Council's meetings. Where once had been the damaged office of the now-deceased PoI-001-A is a room filled with Foundation maps, iconography, items of research, and contact apparatus. Among this can be seen a large wooden table with 13 seats, around which 8 visibly tired and saddened individuals are sitting. They are reading letters and other documents on the table. Eleven hurries to the table, clears his throat, and joins the remainder of the Council members in his seat.//\n\n**O5-11:** Apologies for the delay; Ontokinetics needed my assistance.

Jesus Christ have we fucked up. We need an Administrator and a way to fix all of this goddamned mess. And we need one //now//.\n\n//Dead silence fills the room as Eleven exhales loudly.//\n\n**O5-11:** So, uhm, any ideas?\n\n//The silence is broken by the quiet humming of O5-2's mechanisms as he stands up.

I'm an old man, Joseph. You can wage your little wars as much as you want -- but //I'm// only here to keep the destruction to a minimum.\n\n//Eleven tries to speak up, but decides against it.

And I don't think they have Fairies in there.\n\n**O5-4:** There's been... rumors of one here in Poland, mostly Fae operated. '[[[SCP-5373|Esterberg]]]', it's supposedly called. My teams recover more and more records of it being a safe heaven for the anomalous, something like that. And there's always [[[nx-03|Hy-Brasil]]].\n\n**O5-1:** Is this... confirmed?\n\n//Four scratches his chin.//\n\n**O5-4:** As close as we can get with a rumor, I suppose. But... establishing a Site wouldn't hurt anyone there. We needed one in Poland anyways. //<turning towards Eleven:>// Hasn't [[[SCP-5292|Hannah Rivera been keen on making one recently]]]?\n\n**O5-11:** She... She has, yes.\n\n**O5-4:**  So, what's the problem?\n\n**O5-2:** {{WE CANNOT JUST ALLOW THINGS TO CHANGE IMMEDIATELY. IT WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS, AND PERSONNEL WOULD REBEL. APPROVING OF HER REQUEST AFTER DENYING IT FOR SO LONG WOULD BE UNWISE.}}\n\n**O5-1:** Two's right. We need to take our time. Let's send her there, and if she finds something, only then let's allow her Site to happen. It would be... what, our one-hundred-twentieth?\n\n//Four smiles.//\n\n**O5-4:** And then, once she finds that Esterberg, let's start slowly, until we can fix things. But it will need time. We can't rush this. Sixty years at least.\n\n**O5-8:** Sixty years? Have you lost your mind? That's more than half a century--\n\n**O5-11:** [[[SCP-006|We have time]]].\n\n//One sighs.//\n\n**O5-1:** We can't just make this a one-time thing. We must change our directives, not the ways in which people perceive them.\n\n**O5-4:** Nobody can know this, aside from us. Not now, at least; people //will// resign if they learn of this now.

All Foundation resources are made available to ensure the procedure's proper maintenance.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the unanimous passing of the proposal, making amends with the Fae populace has officially started. However, to ensure the continued compliance of Foundation personnel and to not precipitate any resignations due to drastic policy changes, the full process was projected to take over 70 years to complete. Calculations by O5-2 determined that the best way to integrate Fae and SCP-1000 cultures into human societies and structures, allowing for [[[i-did-not-fade|peaceful and harmonious coexistence would be gradual and small changes, eventually leading to total integration]]] and, perhaps, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500/offset/11 removal of the Foundation as a factor altogether]. This process began with the founding of Site-120 to oversee Esterberg, the Free Port of Częstochowa.\n\nHowever, despite these changes being attempted and, over time, amplified, not all anomalous societies have shown support, with some going as far as violence to oppose them. The most active was and remains to this day GoI-120 (\"Triumviraté\"[[footnote]] A corruption of the root Fae word \"Træḿveraty,\" meaning \"we will prevail.\" [[/footnote]]), formed amongst the chaos that ensued following the Factory Purge -- as the Third Diaspora was later called -- by the followers of Mab which remained after their slaughter. On the day of its inception, theorized to be within two weeks of 13/08/1911, the original date of the Third Diaspora, the group sent out a message to all Site-01 personnel which resulted in their discovery. A transcript of the message, translated from Fae and without the memetic triggers the original possessed, is available below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt's quite funny, seeing your organization and the little Council managing it believing itself to be in control.\n\nWe've seen that attitude ever since we formed in the bowels of the Earths all those hundreds of thousands of years ago -- hubris, that's what we called it. Hubris was the downfall of everything you've built, and ever will build. We'd say we're the bringers of that exact same event, only in recent days, but that would only be half the truth -- as for you, we are also the harbingers of your inevitable and painful deaths.\n\nThere's a certain irony to your situation, but we'll let you figure it out yourselves; it will be quite fun to watch you realize the obvious truth before you. But even then, none of this truly matters -- we are growing in numbers, and we are growing fast. The Third Diaspora left more of us than you thought, and you'll soon find it out the hard way.\n\nUntil then, we will be patiently waiting.\n[[/div]]\n\nDespite the actions undertaken as a result of Directive Alpha/1911, the threat posed by Queen Mab remained extant. To counter this, a consensus between the Foundation and SCP-001-C was attempted. Despite [ERROR]'s (the entity's prior host) death, the lack of ease in contact with it as a result of the event, and ethical concerns, following numerous days of debate among the Council and approval from O5-11, it was decided that Procedure 001-Corpus needed to be maintained at all costs. As a result of that decision, it was agreed that exactly 13 live humans would be delivered to SCP-001-C on a weekly basis. To cause the least damage to the Foundation via this process, the usage of [[[SCP-2000|Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators (BZHR)]]] to form the individuals required for the procedure was unanimously authorized.\n\nHowever, despite this, numerous Foundation personnel were found dissatisfied over the ethics of this method as well as the overall ethics of working with a deity. In response, the following message was sent by O5-1 to all Foundation personnel with knowledge of the procedure:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIn recent days, my office and I have been approached by anonymous complaints regarding the... ethicality of Procedure 001-Corpus, going so far as to ask \"where was the Ethics Committee\" when we approved it. Whilst those complaints are of course understandable given the situation, I need to clear something up: we are not giving a god what it wants. We're merely making sure the sister of said god doesn't massacre us. And giving that bastard corpses is frankly the only thing we can do.\n\nWe can't fix the past. But we just might be able to make the future a little brighter. And to do that, we cannot allow Mab to repeat what we've done, slaughtering the world for the Fourth Time. And the only way to make sure that doesn't happen is Procedure 001-Corpus.\n\nKnow I say this with a heavy heart -- but the ritual remains as it is. It simply must.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- O5-1, current Administrator of the SCP Foundation//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith current information, it is believed that the total fulfillment of the Foundation's new subdirective will be possible by approximately 1980, with containment of PoI-001-C being indefinitely sustainable.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n++++++ **[END OF FILE]**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[=]]\n++++++  **ONE (1) FILE UPDATE AVAILABLE.

At the ending of his shift he entered into the room, despite claiming to have possessed no will to find it -- further research revealed that this was due to the cleanup crew's leadership forgetting to relay the anti-SCP-001-C influence pills which each team member is required to take daily.\n\nDespite successfully entering into SCP-001-B, Majer was able to escape the room due to a sudden awakening of previously dormant ontokinetic abilities, effectively becoming the first recorded person able to leave unaffected. He remained within the corridor through which he found entry into SCP-001-B for the remainder of his shift, only discovered two days later by Site-01 guards patrolling the area. Majer was extremely dehydrated, exhibiting signs of extreme paranoia, fear, and anxiety, and refused to answer any questions. Following numerous hours of the appliance of calming rituals and treatment, however, he began to respond to simple queries. The following is a transcript of the interview which subsequently took place.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 12/08/1918\n\n**Interviewed:** Anthony Majer\n\n**Interviewer:** [ERROR][[footnote]] fatal terminal error: no interviewer name designation encountered **{{@[DATA LOST]}}** [[/footnote]]\n\n**Foreword:** System Error: unidentified edit lock override detected!

Majer is shaking, paranoically looking around himself. His knees are close to his face, resulting in a fetal position on the bed. His eyes are swollen from hours of crying and two days of not sleeping. He is mumbling incoherently to himself. The interviewer is sitting on a chair near the previously mentioned bed. He is holding some sort of notebook, noting all reactions from Majer.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** What did you see?\n\n//Majer looks at him, panicked. His eyes are frantically moving, scanning [ERROR], as if attempting to discern if the figure before him is real.//\n\n**Majer:** I... I... I...\n\n//He starts to sob again, staring at the floor beneath him. He blocks his ears and begins to shiver, moving in an irregular pattern.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** Majer!\n\n//The interviewer grabs Majer by his arms, shaking him. He blinks twice, realizing he's with someone else in the room and starts to shake again, but this time is visibly more focused.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** What did you see down there? Anything?\n\n//Majer nods, swallowing saliva. He wipes tears away from his eyes, and starts to stare at the floor again.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** Yes?\n\n//He nods again.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** What was it?\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**[ERROR]:** What. Did. You.
