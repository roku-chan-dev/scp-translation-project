What happens to the input items when the machine is activated, what is done to them or where they go, is unknown. My hope is that by putting this camera through SCP-914 while it is recording, we might be able to get a possible glimpse. The SD card is fresh and clear for this experiment. -Dr. Nightingale.//\n\n**Input:** One Sony-brand HD video camcorder. Item was set to record before SCP-914 was activated.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One Panasonic-brand HD video Camcorder. Item was noted to still be recording upon retrieval from the output chamber. No anomalous properties observed. Upon review of the SD card’s contents, it was discovered that the memory had been filled to maximum capacity with numerous video files.\n\n//Note: Most of the files were blank or too corrupted to play properly. The ones that we were able to play have been summarized below. They are certainly… Interesting, to say the least. -Dr. Nightingale//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **File #006**\n@@ @@\n**SUMMARY:**\n@@ @@\nVideo shows a side view of Dr. Veritas at his desk and working through a large pile of paperwork in his office, seemingly not aware of the camera.

Camera pans around the chamber before being carefully placed onto the floor and pointed towards the doorway. Dr. Nightingale is seen crouching down in front of the camera lens and waving a hand in front of it, seemingly to confirm that it is working correctly, before exiting the input chamber. Approximately thirty seconds later, several shouts of confirmation can be heard before the input chamber closes and SCP-914 activates. The video image begins to develop a slight vibration as the audio picks up the typical noises made by SCP-914 during its refining process.\n\nVideo and audio remains unchanged for thirty minutes, upon which the image suddenly jolts and the audio cuts out for two seconds before returning. It is noted that the video after this point has a noticeable change in contrast in comparison to before, and that the positioning of the door in the video frame has changed slightly as well. It is believed that this is the point where the camcorder was “changed” from the input object to the output object.\n\nThe video continues on for another thirty minutes before the vibrations in the image cease, and the chamber door opens. Dr. Nightingale is seen approaching the chamber. After picking it up, he waves a hand in front of the camera lens again before seemingly spinning it around and examining it, shortly after which the video ends.

No discernible background details can be seen, with the area around the chess table and individuals seemingly being non-existent. No audio is present within the video as well. Dr. Nightingale appears to be conversing with the other figure, with the frequent pauses and body language displayed implying that the other figure is responding to his statements.\n\nCloser examination of the chess board seems to show that the game pieces have been modeled to resemble notable individuals from the SCP Foundation and various Groups Of Interest. Approximate runtime was noted to be thirty minutes, upon which the recording abruptly ends. Predictions of the chess game’s outcome appear to lean towards a stalemate.\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n**Test 914-1601**\n**Name:** Intern Beauvillier\n**Date:** 27/05/2020\n**Total items:** Five six-sided dice, five American 25¢ coins, five deck of playing cards.\n\n//Note: Determining how 914 reacts to probabilities. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One six-sided die\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A small pile of plastic pulp.\n\n**Input:** One 25¢ coin\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A small puddle of molten copper\n\n**Input:** A deck of playing cards\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A mass of cardboard pulp,  and a puddle of ink.\n\n//Note: Alright, nothing unusual from the Rough tests, as expected. Moving on to the Coarse ones. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One six-sided die\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A small plastic cube and a small vial of ink made out of plastic.\n\n**Input:** One 25¢ coin\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Twenty-five 1¢ coins. They were notably smaller than standard 1¢  coins, and thus were unusable as a viable currency.\n\n**Input:** One deck of playing cards, shuffled\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Four piles of cards, sorted by color, and a small cardboard box.\n\n//Note: Once again, nothing unusual. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One six-sided die\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A small twelve-sided die.\n\n**Input:** One 25¢ coin\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A 0.20€ coin, made out of copper. The usual 0.20€ coin is made out of \"Nordic Gold\".\n\n**Input:** One deck of playing cards\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A tarot deck. It is visibly smaller than an usual tarot deck.\n\n//Note: I must admit the previous tests weren't interesting. Now starting the Fine tests, hoping for something to happen. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One six-sided die\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A visibly unchanged die. However, whenever thrown, the dice will show the result wanted by the thrower, including numbers higher than 6.\n\n//Note: We start to have issues identifying the dots after 255. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One 25¢ coin\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A four-sided coin.\n\n**Input:** One deck of playing cards.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A deck of playing cards. If unobserved, a card will be randomly exchanged with another unobserved card. If only one card is unobserved, no changes are noted.\n\n**Input:** One six-sided die\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Six one-sided dice. No matter the point of view, it will still appear as one-sided. Whenever thrown, it will land one time out of 6, the remaining times an event will prevent the dice from touching the surface it was intended to land on.\n\n//Note: This is really dangerous. I launched it and it started a chain reaction, and kept unwillingly hitting the dice for 5 minutes before it finally fell. I don't recommend any tests involving a restrained thrower, and instead strongly suggest incinerating this. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One 25¢ coin\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A 25¢ coin. Whenever launched, it has a 50% chance of flying towards the sky.\n\n//Note: I would like to remind everyone that playing with items that could possibly fly out of the atmosphere outdoors is strongly discouraged. Especially when, for example, this item could find itself flying in space because SOMEONE thought it was a good idea to flip it in the yard. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One deck of cards\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A shuffled deck of cards. If observed, it will induce severe psychological distress in viewer, by causing them to \"witness every single possible event that could happen\" at the exact moment of the viewing. \n\n//Note: Requesting Class-A amnestics. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1602**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Y.

The gummy bears are capable of assembling into larger bodies and climbing walls. However, they were slow enough to be captured and put into containment shortly after they attempted to exit the output booth.\n\n**Input:** One hundred gummy bears\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One large animate entity possessing four short tentacle-like legs positioned in a radially symmetrical configuration around a central mass. A mouth-like orifice is present on the bottom of the central mass, allowing the entity to pick up and carry small items. When presented with a Haribo brand gummy bear, it will absorb it through the inside of its orifice, and it will attempt to attack all moving things nearby. Being presented with more gummy bears will intensify this behavior. After one or two hours, it will return to its docile state.\n\n//Note: Did you just create Gummy Shoggoth? And I thought I've seen everything.

Subjects of origin other than American and European perceive the coin as a standard 50¢ Mexican Peso coin.\n\n//Note: D-Class testing to determine if the output categorises someone as being of European/American descent, in relation to the descent of their family members, has been inconclusive. - Technician Sollem//\n\n**Input:** One USB drive containing 2014 Grammy Awards performance by Daft Punk\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One USB drive containing 2015 Coachella performance by Kaskade\n\n//Note: Catching up with recent events, I see. - Technician Akchote//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1604**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho, D-99326 (assisting)\n**Date:** 28/05/2020\n**Total Items:** Five brass hamster wheels\n\n**Input:** One hamster wheel\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Multiple small irregular metal flakes of various size and shape, ranging from 1mm to 20mm in diameter.\n\n**Input:** One hamster wheel\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** The individual metal elements making up brass has been separated into individual piles of dust.\n\n**Input:** One hamster wheel\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A brass model of a small hamster with movable spoked wheels instead of legs.\n\n**Input:** One hamster wheel\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A hamster wheel with four smaller hamster wheels attached to each corner of its base. The smaller hamster wheels in turn each have individual bases, connected to four proportionally smaller hamster wheels. This continues to a microscopic level.\n\n**Input:** One hamster wheel\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A deformed hamster wheel. When directly viewed by a human subject, they will be led to believe that the item bears resemblance to a strange or deformed elephant. The compulsion to comment on this has been proven to be non-anomalous.\n\n//Note: I only saw the photograph, after it had been scanned for cognitohazards and everything, and I still think it looks like a weird elephant. - Jane Cho//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1605**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Reil\n**Date:** 28/05/2020\n**Total Items:** A rabbit cage and two 3cm^^3^^ iron cubes\n\n**Input:** Above items\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One metal container which slowly shapes any non-organic item placed in it into an animate rabbit which looks identical to the rabbit which formerly inhabited the cage. The animate rabbit will still seek out food, despite it not needing to eat. \n\n//Note: It appears that 914 somehow managed to find out about that rabbit that once resided in that cage. - J.R. Reil//\n\n//Note: I hope these do not breed like normal rabbits because that will get out of control quickly. - T.R. Boelli//\n\n//Note: Reil, I don't know what you did (yet), but I had a very annoyed Sedna at my desk a few hours ago, saying he was attacked by three rabbits made out of cardboard, wood and metal. All of them were destroyed, but I recommend staying away from him for a while. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1606**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Garinet\n**Date:** 30/05/2020\n**Total Items:** One hand written note, three Styrofoam \"spinning tops.\" Tops are 30cm diameter x 8cm thick foam disks revolving on hard plastic pins.\n\n**Input:** One handwritten note, reading: \"Good evening. I'm new to this lab. Did you know that most of your outputs get incinerated?\"\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One sheet of paper containing a maintenance log for incinerator repairs that took place after test 914-1308\n\n//Note: Hopefully, some safe experiments on how 914 deals with angular momentum. - J. R. Garinet//\n\n**Input:** One spinning top (as specified) spun up to 600rpm.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One styrofoam top, 2cm thick and 60cm in diameter, spinning at 150rpm\n\n**Input:** One spinning top (as specified) spun up to 600rpm.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One styrofoam top, 32cm thick and 15cm in diameter, spinning at 2400rpm. Object could not withstand centripetal forces and disintegrated.\n\n//Note: Angular momentum was conserved. First test reduced kinetic energy, second one added it. Perhaps a small amount of chemical or thermal energy was converted? So... Where's the broom? - J. R. Garinet//\n\n**Input:** One spinning top (as specified) spun up to 600rpm.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A 3cm diameter hard plastic top rotating at 60,000 rpm. Slowed and fell after 10 minutes in the output booth. Appeared non-anomalous until touched with bare hands; object began to rotate slowly when handled.\n\n//Note: Object anomalously converts heat into rotation. I think it's spinning at the bottom of the incinerator.  - J. R. Garinet//\n\n//Note: Object also appears to be nonflammable. When the incinerator was shutdown for routine maintenance, we found a 3cm diameter hole in the bottom. Might want to be prepared to pay for the repairs.  - T.R. Boelli//\n\n//Note: So the researcher is forced to pay for these repairs? - J. R. Garinet//\n\n//Note: Call it ''idiot salary deduction''. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1607**\n**Name:** Intern Sora\n**Date:** 30/05/2020\n**Total Items:** One Amazon \"Alexa\" artificial intelligence, one Google \"Google Home\" artificial intelligence, one Apple \"Siri\" artificial intelligence, all in their respective devices. \n\n**Input:** \"Google home\" \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged device. Output was not able to perform any actions. Instead, it plays a related advertisement every time an instruction was given. \n\n**Input:** \"Siri\"\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged device. Output was not able to perform any actions. Inspection of internal records show that the AI was not able to comprehend speeches of any language, thus would only respond with the phrase \"I'm not sure I understand\". \n\n**Input:** \"Alexa\" \n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged device. When activated and tested, it was found that transactions were made from Intern Sora's personal bank account for every action performed. The prices of actions are proportional to their difficulty when performed by a human being. Some of the actions completed by the AI, their price in USD, and the results are displayed in the table below. \n\n||~ Action ||~ Cost ||~ Result ||\n|| Report the weather || 50¢ || AI proceeds to report weather of the next week ||\n|| Translation || 25¢ || AI was able to translate various phrases and words in several languages ||\n|| Online purchase || $20 || AI purchased various items using Intern Sora's address. ||\n|| Play music || $6 || AI cycled between songs such as \"Shape of You\", \"Despacito\" and \"Gangnam Style\" before instructed to stop, at which point proceeded to charge $1 extra for stopping. ||\n\n**Addendum:** Upon being questioned \"Who is my neighbour?\" by Intern Sora, the AI produced a comprehensive list of all intelligence personnel working within the FBI. System log files suggests that the AI had hacked into the database of the Pentagon in order to produce the list. \n\n//Note: So that's why he kept stalking me at night. - Sora//\n\n//Note: Sora, you might want to have this incinerated soon, for both security reasons and your own financial security. - T.R. Boelli//\n\n//Note: Oh for God's sake, Sora. I just got off a call with Hackett, who had to explain to [REDACTED] from the Pentagon why their database was ''accidentally compromised''. You're god damn lucky that we didn't have to resort to amnesticising the entire force there, because you would be in debt until after you died. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1608**\n**Name:** Technological Researcher Boelli\n**Date:** 30/05/2020\n**Total Items:** Five USB drives, five cups of water\n\n//Note: Let's see if we can get a USB drive that is waterproof. Water will be emptied into the input chamber. I have stand-alone laptops ready to test the outputs on.//\n\n**Input:** One USB drive, puddle of water\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One waterlogged USB drive\n\n**Input:** One USB drive, puddle of water\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One cup, made of the parts from the USB drive, filled with water. Extra water is on the floor.\n\n**Input:** One USB drive, puddle of water\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged USB drive-- Water was placed in circle around the drive. One USB drive that when plugged into a device will anomalously cause the device to develop water damage as if water were poured into it. Object incinerated. \n\n**Input:** One USB drive, puddle of water\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One USB drive surrounded by the water anomalously floating around it. A layer of air, presumably from the booth, is in between the water and the USB drive. Attempts made to move the USB drive all resulted in corresponding movements of the outer layer of water. Object stored in Anomalous Storage.\n\n//Note: Okay, getting closer. I placed the object in Anomalous Storage for now in case someone has a waterproof computer they would like to test it on. I'm including the glass in the next test as a barrier between the water and the USB. - T.R. Boelli//\n\n**Input:** One USB drive, one glass of water\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One drive of unknown make and model --surrounded by a glass cube.-- The D-class sent to retrieve the output dropped it which shattered on impact causing water and glass to scatter inside the output chamber. The drive inside was completely dry, however, the port that would connect to a device is unrecognizable. Placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n//Note: It looks like I got a waterproof drive, too bad it doesn't work with any of our computers. I will try to develop a converter that can connect to it in my spare time. - T.R. Boelli//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1609**\n**Name:** Technological Researcher Mikhail Strauß, D-95771\n**Date:** 05/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Five [REDACTED]-brand cameras with no batteries inserted, five Lithium-ion battery packs\n\n//Note: Getting tired of these cameras running out of power at the most inopportune moments. Let's see what we can do with these. - T.R. Strauß//\n\n**Input:** One camera, one battery pack\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Camera has been replaced with a [REDACTED]-brand model, released in the same year as the inputted model, and the battery pack inserted into the camera by SCP-914. No noticeable change in battery life when tested by D-95771.\n\n**Input:** One camera, one battery pack\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged camera and battery pack. D-95771 inserted the battery into the camera. When the battery was placed back in, the camera anomalously activated and began taking pictures at a rate of five photographs per second. Battery power ran out after two minutes.\n\n//Note: Not quite what I was looking for, but we're getting somewhere for sure. - T.R. Strauß//\n\n**Input:** One camera with one battery pack inserted\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged camera, battery assumed fused to the camera, as attempted removal by D-95771 resulted in a failure. The camera flash was rendered inoperable by SCP-914 and battery life was extended by around 100 photographs.\n\n**Input:** One camera with one battery pack inserted\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Camera has been replaced with a [REDACTED]-brand model, one of the newest models available on the market. D-95771 was ordered to take a photograph with the flash function enabled. The resulting flash was unusually bright and proceeded to temporarily blind D-95771 for approximately five minutes. The flash failed to function on all attempted photographs afterwards.\n\n//Note: Okay, definitely beginning to regret this idea now. - T.R. Strauß//\n\n**Input:** One camera, one battery pack\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Camera has again been replaced with a [REDACTED]-brand model, one of the newest models available on the market. The battery appeared unchanged upon retrieval. D-95771 was ordered to insert the battery into the camera and take a picture. The camera exploded upon the shutter closing and D-95771 was terminated by 3rd and 4th degree burn injuries to the face and upper chest regions. The battery was also destroyed, but remains recovered hinted at a currently unknown alloy in the battery pack. Tests into this alloy are ongoing.\n\n//Note: Guess I'll stick to just swapping the battery from now on, then. - T.R. Strauß//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 161X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 161X Test Logs\"]]\n----\n**Test 914-1610**\n**Name:** Dr. Cleveland\n**Date:** 08/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Three copies of a list of countries where the store Target has a presence, printed on A4 paper\n\n**Input:** List of countries with Target\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A list of countries with Jollibee\n\n**Input:** List of countries with Target\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A list of countries without Foundation presence\n\n//Note: Odd. Why would there still be five countries without our presence? - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** List of countries with Target\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An instruction manual, titled \"How to Teleport a [ILLEGIBLE]\". Despite the title, the content consists of the lyrics of //Let Me Live// by Target (a 1970s band from Memphis).\n\n//Note: Never heard of them, but it is a pun I guess. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1611**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher McLaif\n**Date:** 08/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Three sets of \"true wireless\" Bluetooth earbuds, including charging cases\n\n**Input:** A set of earbuds\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A damaged set of earbuds, displaying signs of having been smashed with a blunt object.\n\n**Input:** A set of earbuds\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A set of traditional over-the-ear wireless headphones, shrunken down to an unwearable size. The speakers on the headphones are of similar size to the input earbuds, and are fully functional.\n\n**Input:** A set of earbuds\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small plastic and metal cube measuring 5cm on each side. Connecting the cube to a Bluetooth-capable audio source causes anyone holding the cube to anomalously hear audio coming from the device. Disassembling the device shows that no electronics exist in the device.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1612**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher van den Berg\n**Date:** 10/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Four pairs of generic stainless steel scissors\n\n//Note: I wonder how 914 would react to everyday household objects? Surely it wouldn't cause much of a risk, right? - J. R. van den Berg//\n\n**Input:** One pair of stainless steel scissors\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One heavily-rusted, unusable pair of stainless steel scissors.\n\n**Input:** One pair of generic stainless steel scissors\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Disassembled parts that comprise the stainless steel scissors placed in Input booth prior to testing. All individual pieces lined up upon checking Output area.\n\n**Input:** One pair of generic stainless steel scissors\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One pair of generic garden shears. Noticeably, the garden shears are smaller as well as lighter than a standard pair of garden shears, which would account for the lack of mass with the output result.\n\n**Input:** One pair of generic stainless steel scissors\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --One unaltered pair of scissors.--  One pair of visually unaltered scissors that cannot cut any solid matter. However, when the blades are passed through a mass of liquid matter, the liquid anomalously separates into distinct pieces that cannot be rejoined no matter how much force is applied in attempt to rejoin the two parts back together. Further observation reveals that both separated liquid matter behaved similar to the properties of oil and water. The anomalous property of the scissors dissipated after approximately nine minutes and fourteen seconds.\n\n//Note: So the idea of surface tension doesn't seem to apply to this particular pair. Huh. - J. R. van den Berg//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1613**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Reimer\n**Date:** 10/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Two maps of Canada, three rectangular plane mirrors measuring 37 cm by 60 cm\n\n**Input:** One map of Canada\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One map of the Pacific Northwest. Notably, the Salt Lake Basin is labeled as part of the region despite being hydrologically part of the Great Basin. Only cities with a population above 30 thousand are shown.\n\n**Input:** One map of Canada\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A map of Canada, with Alaska and minor border irregularities with the United States included with it; and with Quebec and portions of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario excluded. Individuals who touch the map would identify themselves as Québécois nationalists for exactly 1976 seconds.\n\n//Note: The D-class who handled this output proceeded to quote Charles De Gaulle, shouted \"Vive le Québec Libre\", and annoyed us for the next 33 minutes. - JR Reimer//\n\n**Input:** One plane mirror\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One two-way mirror\n\n**Input:** One plane mirror\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A convex mirror which shows the property of a concave mirror. Placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n//Note: I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's surely disorienting for one. - JR Reimer//\n\n**Input:** One plane mirror\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A plane mirror which shows the viewer's equivalent from Universe Sierra286[REDACTED]. The name, date of birth, hometown, and (if applicable) date of death of the person also appears on the mirror. If shown to a person without an analogue from said universe, no reflection appears.\n\n//Note: And I thought the circumstances of my birth (thank ███████ for that) would mean that I wouldn't have a reflection in this mirror, but it turns out I do. Not sure whether I should be glad that I'm not alone, or be horrified that there are others who [REDACTED]. - JR Reimer//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1614**\n**Name:** Intern Singley\n**Date:** 10/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Three orange traffic cones\n\n//Note: Hey guys! I'm new here. Just got transferred from Facility-21. I thought for my first test I would start out relatively small, to stay safe. - Intern Singley//\n\n**Input:** One orange traffic cone\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One green traffic cone\n\n**Input:** One orange traffic cone\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One traffic cone which is surrounded by an invisible barrier that extends 15cm from the cone. Matter of organic composition is unable to pass this barrier. Object transferred to incinerator via robotic arm.\n\n**Input:** One orange traffic cone\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged traffic cone-- One traffic cone which affixes itself to the head of any person, who is performing an action that defies a set of rules. This set of rules is currently not known but is hypothesized to match basic rules of morality. When the cone is affixed onto a subject's head in this way, it causes them to immediately seize up, stand in place, and say the word \"cone\" repeatedly until it is removed from their head.

Autopsy confirmed death was caused by myocardial rupture induced by extreme tachycardia.\nThe liquid was analyzed as having a caffeine and cobalamin (B12) content approximately 5000 times higher than a regular can of Monster Ultra.\n\n//Note: Maybe 914 is trying to warn me to cut back on these. - Researcher Schwartz//\n\n//Note: Nah, just keep it to less than 5000.  Also, I hate to be that safety guy, but: **first** chemical analysis, **then** taste testing. - J. R.

The samples are contained within seperate 500mL beakers. \n\n**Input:** One sample\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** The same sample of petroleum undergoing combustion.\n\n**Input:** One sample \n**Setting:** Coarse \n**Output:** Several small puddles of oil-like substances, one pile of boron silicate dust. Testing shows oil-like substances to be hydrocarbons that constitutes the petroleum sample, sorted by molar mass.\n\n**Input:** One sample \n**Setting:** 1:1 \n**Output:** One lump of coal. The air inside the output booth was noted to have higher moisture content.\n\n**Input:** One sample\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One anomalously animated solidified mass of petroleum. The object regularly changed shape to resemble life forms that existed before the Carboniferous Era. Neutralised by incineration after output attempted to attack Researcher Richelieu's ankle while taking the shape of a miniature Pulmonoscorpius.\n\n**Input:** One sample\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --Identical to input--\n\n//Note: Something's a bit off with this one. I'm putting it in Anomalous Storage. - Richelieu//\n\n**Addendum:** During the afternoon of  ██/06/2020, approximately ██ humanoid entities manifested in the carpark of Facility 19-23. Security footage shows the entities to be dressed in military gear, similar to that of the US Marine Corps. Entities subdued the entire security team with non-lethal weaponry before breaking into Anomalous Storage. Upon locating the beaker of petroleum, the entities began to sing \"America, Fuck Yeah\" featured in the 2004 German-American co-produced film \"Team America: World Police\". Entities disappeared along with the sample of petroleum after the song ended. \n\n//Note: After going over the footage, we noticed that this didn't actually happen. Richelieu had a hallucinogenic episode and likely wrote this the above report during it. We checked over the security feed, and it seems he took the sample back out of Storage, ran out of the building, ignoring every coworker that attempted to communicate, tripped and spilled the sample on the parking lot. Then he stood back up, and remained still for about 8 minutes. Then, he slowly shuffled back inside to his living space. The sample has been deemed neutralised, and Richelieu is currently undergoing psychological screening. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1617**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka\n**Date:** 12/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Three //Worm on a String// toys\n\n**Input:** One //Worm on a String// toy\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One //Worm on a String// toy with the string attached to the tail end rather than the head.\n\n//Note: I’m going to call it String on a Worm. - JR Boneka//\n\n**Input:** One //Worm on a String// toy\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Five //Worm on a String// toys, each one-fifth the mass of the original.\n\n**Input:** One //Worm on a String// toy\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One detached string, one visually unchanged worm toy. When personnel were transporting it to another room to be examined, the output suddenly became animate and escaped neutralization attempts by anomalously phasing through the floor.\n\n**Addendum:** The next morning, the worm toy was discovered in the parking lot dragging a kitchen knife with its tail, attempting to slash the tires of JR Boneka’s car, though it was unable to cause any damage due to a lack of strength. Security personnel safely captured and incinerated the output, and the knife was returned to the facility kitchen.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1618**\n**Name:** Dr. Green\n**Date:** 15/06/2020\n**Total Items:** Five sheets of paper with the word \"3D\" printed on them.

However, the word \"3D\" now has the appearance of traditional 3 dimensional art. With the width of the word extending backwards towards the lower edge of the page. \n\n**Input:** One item mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A paper sculpture of the word 3D, roughly 15 cm tall and 5 cm thick. It began to levitate, and moved rapidly towards and away from the faces of anyone observing it, similar to the way early 3D film would emphasise the 3D aspect of the movie.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1619**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher E. Williams\n**Date:** 18/06/2020\n**Total Items:** One Foundation standard-issue gas mask.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned gas mask.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unaltered gas mask. A D-class subject was instructed to wear the mask; subject reported that the mask felt very easy to breathe in. After 15 minutes, subject had a seizure and collapsed. The mask was removed and subject was taken away by medical personnel.\n\n**Addendum:** Further testing revealed that the mask anomalously converts all fluids (D-81162 wore the mask underwater for five minutes with no ill effects) inhaled through its filter into pure oxygen. At standard atmospheric pressure, this is enough to cause oxygen poisoning within minutes. Object has been placed in Anomalous Storage pending permission for additional testing.\n\n//Note: While one probably wouldn't want to wear it for too long, there are probably circumstances where this would still be useful. - J.R.

The USB stick contains “It’s Been So Long” by The Living Tombstone, a fan-made song that hints at the lore of the FNAF series. An auditory cognitohazard is found in the song which induces a feeling of “disturbing” and “unsettling” in the listener that lasts for 83 seconds after exposure. \n\n**Input:** Copy of “PUBG”\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Identical USB stick. The USB stick contains a file named “吃鸡外挂”. When executed, a 3D printer in a nearby town’s stationery store was activated and produced various firearm parts, which assemble into a Kar98k rifle. The rifle appears to accept normal 8mm Mauser rounds and functions normally despite being built out of plastic parts. During testing, it was found that bullets exiting the barrel would anomalously home in and hit the user’s intended target, despite the direction which the barrel is pointed towards. \n\n//Note: Lucky the stationery shop was one of our front companies, so we didn’t need to amnesticise anyone. - Sora//\n\n**Input:** Copy of “Terraria”\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Identical USB stick. The USB stick contains a desktop pet that takes the shape of a slime enemy from the game. The user is able to interact with the slime in various ways, such as “feeding” it files and engaging in conversations, which will increase its “experience”. At different thresholds, the slime pet will change shape and colour into another variant from the game.\n\n//Note: Petition to keep this on my personal PC after it passes anomalous screening? - Sora// \n\n//Note: It's your head if Rosen finds out it creates anomalous viruses. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** Copy of “DDLC”\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Identical USB stick.

It shouldn’t be able to predict the future, and yet my previous tests have demonstrated it can. It might have been a coincidence, but perhaps in this same way, it can provide some knowledge on the past. - Researcher Connolly//\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pile of ash, one 32 GB USB drive. Contents of the USB drive are a copy of a book titled “Secrets, Control, and Power,” written by one Marcus Connolly, dated 180 “AG”. The book contains essays detailing Marcus’s experiences in an organization called “The League”, presumably an analogue to the Foundation. One essay details the discovery of SCP-914 in a silver mine in Hispania by Lucius Veritas and other legionnaires.\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One pile of ash, one 32 GB USB drive, one untitled book. The USB drive contains only a word document consisting of the sentence, “You asked for it.” The book is completely blank, with no text of any kind nor any symbols. D-45218 was ordered to open and read it. After no immediate effects, adverse or otherwise, occurred, Researcher Connolly opened the book as well. 15 minutes after opening and closing the book, both D-45218 and Researcher Connolly fell unconscious. After regaining consciousness, both were diagnosed by on-site medical personnel as having blindness. \n\n**Addendum:** This blindness was later revealed to be temporary. Approximately 24 hours after the diagnosis of the subjects, both independently reported their vision returning. \n\n//Note: The book appears to induce an effect remarkably similar to that of SCP-1230. When questioned on their unconscious experience, D-45218 reported entering a ''dreamscape composed of the ruins of modern-day New York City'', before being forcibly awoken. I saw some weird Steampunk version of London. Given the risk, the book has been (begrudgingly) incinerated. - Researcher Connolly//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1624**\n**Name:** Intern R.

The suit jacket is noticeably small and appears to be fitted for a child, possibly due to lack of materials. \n\n**Input:** One pair of khaki pants\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of khaki pants. The waistband anomalously fits to the waist of whomever wears them by adding or subtracting length to the pant legs. This makes the pants usually unwearable as they are too long or too short for the person wearing them.\n\n**Input:** One pair of khaki pants\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A fedora made of khaki fabric that anomalously makes the wearer appear to be clothed in formal wear commonly worn around the early 1900’s to all observers. The clothing appears to be made entirely from khaki fabric. Due to the lack of stiffness in the fabric, the hat lacks structure to be worn normally. \n\n//Note: Both pairs of pants have been placed in Anomalous Storage. All in all, not a bad first test.

Subsequent analysis reveals minor software and hardware improvements over most modern day smartphones. However, the device's backside appears to be entirely covered in a variety of lenses without any obvious use.\n\n**Input:** One Nokia 2.2 Android smartphone\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One thick bottomed shot glass with assorted electronics presumably inside the bottom.  Upon exiting SCP-914, test result immediately filled with water, presumed to have been extracted from the ambient moisture.  When Researcher Countac made contact with the glass, all water contained within immediately evaporated, and test result stated that \"this is a demo product, if you would like to purchase the full version, please ask one of our in store employees\".  \n\n**Input:** One Nokia 2.2 Android smartphone\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One smartphone of unknown make and model. Smartphone is approximately 3mm thick, with its exterior constructed entirely from fingerprint resistant reinforced glass. All modern day smartphone features, such as changing port and camera lens, are either entirely wireless, embedded beneath the glass, or non-existent. Attempts at operating smartphone are met with failure, as a brain-computer interface appears necessary.\n\n**Input:** One Nokia 2.2 Android smartphone\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One 12 cm^^3^^ cuboid constructed from an unknown, reflective material.  Analysis of test result revealed that said cuboid additionally possessed a variety of electronics, allowing it to collect, store, process, and even broadcast information.  Attempted communication with test result revealed it to be possibly sentient.  However, this is of minimal concern, as the cuboid appears to posses no internal memory, causing it to constantly emit a stream of incomprehensible information.\n\n**Input:** One Nokia 2.2 Android smartphone\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One Nokia 2.2 Android smartphone otherwise identical to the input, containing text from a sender called \"Rohith\". Researcher Countac, despite warnings from his assistant, immediately read the text, and upon finishing it, ceased all subsequent testing on SCP-914.  Analysis of test result revealed no abnormal properties.  \n\n//Note: I'm going to stop testing for now.  I'll send some of the outputs to the ETS and Manufacturing Departments for some analysis, but can I keep the last one? - Researcher Countac//\n\n//Note: Get it screened first. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1633**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Garinet\n**Date:** 08/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Four 60 mL bottles of hot sauce, pasteurized and filtered.

Garinet//\n\n**Input:** One bottle of hot sauce\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One rectangular bottle of dark liquid, labeled, \"№ 914 Fever Tonic,\" in the style of early 20th century patent remedies. Contains high concentrations of prosidol (an opioid) and droxypropine (a cough suppressant.) Notably, both have the same chemical formula (C,,18,,H,,27,,NO,,3,,) as capsaicin. Other components could not be readily identified.\n\n//Note: It still smells like hot sauce. I suspect it would do more harm than good if you drank it. The bottle might make a nice decoration. - J. R. Garinet//\n\n**Input:** One bottle of hot sauce\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One graduated cylinder of \"Hort Sauce,\" a viscous, pale green liquid. After initial hazard testing, output sent to Dr. Hort for analysis.\n\n//Note: This is almost exactly what I needed for a planned experiment! Somehow, it's got a bit of my DNA, so it will take some time to purify. - Dr. Hort//\n\n//Note: Keep us posted on any findings about your sauce. - J. R. Garinet//\n\n //Note: Am I the only one a little concerned about where and how it got a hold of Hort’s DNA? - Researcher Connolly// \n \n**Input:** One bottle of hot sauce\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One extremely sexy bottle of sauce-- A bottle of green chili sauce which anomalously causes observers to find it attractive.

I also have a slight aversion to disco. - Researcher Daris//\n\n**Input:** Five chocolate bunnies, one pocket watch, inputted by Researcher Darvis\n**Setting:** --1:1-- Fine\n**Output:** One extremely small, ornate metal jar with a glass bottom containing a small, black marble. The jar is extremely resistant to damage of all types.\n\n**Addendum:** Based on several external scans, it appears the marble is made of extremely condensed chocolate, and is kept such by high air pressure inside the jar.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1635**\n**Name:** Researcher Ken\n**Date:** 09/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Three DVD copies of the game //Fallout: New Vegas// for PC\n\n//Note: Greetings everyone, I've been recently transferred to this Facility. I've chosen games for my first experiment because I believe they're a much safer option than most experiments, but I will still be taking the necessary safety measures on Very Fine. - Researcher Ken//\n\n**Input:** One DVD copy of the aforementioned game\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One DVD copy of the game //The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind// for the original Xbox console\n\n//Note: Both are made by Bethesda and Morrowind is widely considered to be the best Elder Scrolls game. If anyone has an old Xbox available, I'm happy to let you keep the game once it passes testing. - Researcher Ken//\n\n**Input:** One DVD copy of the aforementioned game\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged DVD that when launched and played, was found to have all deleted content fit the game's story. The map has also been expanded to show different areas that were inaccessible in the original game.\n\n//Note: While this is certainly an improvement, it seems that all the expanded areas of the map only have generic NPCs and not any storyline quests, so it's not a big improvement. Request to donate this to the breakroom once it passes testing? - Researcher Ken//\n\n//Note: Since I understand the inherent risks of testing on the Very Fine setting, the output will be retrieved and examined by a D-class with the necessary safety measures. - Researcher Ken//\n\n**Input:** One DVD copy of the aforementioned game\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One miniature model of //The Courier// from the game along with a small dial on the right side of the model, entirely made from the materials of the inputted DVD. The model changes it's gender depending on the gender of the closest subject. No other anomalous effects were observed until the D-class was instructed to turn the dial of the model once. Upon doing so, the output anomalously reshaped itself into a model of //Doc Mitchell// from the same game, producing a cognitohazard that causes the subject holding it to believe that they are the character portrayed by the model. Further testing shows that the model can change to any character from the game by rotating the dial once.\n\n//Note: D-class was amnesticized and sent back to their cell. As well-made as the model is, there are too many risks involved in keeping it, we have enough cognitohazards laying around.

Noticeably, the output is larger than a standard-sized computer fan used to keep a setup's CPU unit operable. Output was tested and functioned similarly to a standard-sized computer fan.\n\n**Input:** One electric fan\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged fan-- One fan that does not have an electric cord to plug it into a wall socket. Anomalous property observed when the electric fan was switched on to the \"1\" setting, where it began exuding air similar to how a normal electric fan would function on the \"3\" setting. When the appliance was switched to the \"2\" setting, the protective cover of the fan came off and struck the D-class, resulting in various bruises and injuries. Further testing on the \"3\" setting placed on-hold.\n\n//Note: Okay, that was a bit wild. I was not expecting the cover to fly off with that setting. - J.R. van den Berg//\n\n**Input:** One electric fan\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged fan-- One fan that when turned on to any setting exudes a powerful blast of air with enough force to knock an individual off-balance.

The pile consists solely of components affected by 914-1592-1. During analysis, the device was bootable without the need to replace the missing electronic components. The output proceeded with regular start-up processes until prompting for R. Marcopus' passphrase. After submitting said password, the test result started to play //Lemon Tree// from //Fool's Garden// for exactly two minutes, before repeating the last line on loop indefinitely. The output was incinerated after eleven minutes of observation; the isolated pile of affected components was also destroyed after the analysis was complete.\n\n**Input:** An iPhone 8 (256GB), belonging to Junior Researcher Boneka\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An almost perfect grey sphere with tiny white dots, made out of the components from the input. The only imperfection observable without the use of visual aids is a camera lens. Touching the sphere causes an internal sensor to measure the change of capacitance and activate a portion of the former display, which lies directly under the lens. This projects a snake onto close surfaces. J.R. Boneka stated that she had drawn \"this snake as a doodle\" on her phone once.\n\n**Addendum:** The projected picture contains a minor cognitohazard that compels subjects to replace the operating systems of their personal devices with an open-source alternative and study the software excessively. The output was forcefully disassembled.\n\n**Input:** A Nokia 3310 3G (2017 version; Dual SIM; 128MB + 16GB microSDHC card), belonging to Junior Researcher Kai\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An object, resembling a counterfeit Nokia 3310 (2000 version). Turning on the device result in the phrases \"Basically\", \"Available\", \"Soft state\" and \"Eventual consistency\" listed on the screen. These attributes are the components of BASE, a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability. --Further study on the relation between the input, the output and the concept of BASE is needed.--\n\n//Note: The opposite of eventual consistency is ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability).

Output mass and form adjusts to the shape that D-class had moulded it to. Anomalous property observed that output would transform back to its previous shape after approximately 9 minutes if left undisturbed.\n\n**Input:** One pillow\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One identical pillow-- Testing D-class remarked that the output was most comfortable to use and proceeded to take a nap despite being warned against doing so. Approximately sixty seconds into the test, output attempted to smother the D-class. Output nearly succeeded in asphyxiating the D-class as security assistance was summoned to assist with removing the output from the D-class's face. Output was eventually retrieved with a robotic arm before being transferred to the incinerator.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1645**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 14/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One diamond pencil from a previous test.\n\n**Input:** Diamond pencil\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small animate model of a rabbit made from diamond, with a cavity inside containing graphite dust.

Upon opening, a loud horn sounded from the output booth. No other effects observed.\n\n//Note: Aside from that noise, this appears to be an output characteristic of 1:1, which strikes me as being very suspicious. Despite my misgivings, the object passed anomalous screening and seems to have no discernible properties whatsoever. It will continue to be monitored for further developments. - JR Boneka//\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 165X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 165X Test Logs\"]]\n----\n**Test 914-1650**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher van den Berg, D-61480\n**Date:** 16/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One generic writing pen, black ink\n\n//Note: I’ve heard about the strange things that happen when objects are passed through the “Fine” setting, so I’ll have a D-class assisting me for this test. - J.R. van den Berg//\n\n**Input:** One generic writing pen, black ink\n**Setting:** --Fine-- Very Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged pen-- One generic writing pen whose ink had changed from black to red. D-class that retrieved the pen reported that the output is working as intended when tested on a piece of blank paper. The pen was subjected through anomalous screening and passed without any abnormalities, and turned over to Junior Researcher van den Berg’s ownership.\n\n##red|**Addendum:** Approximately twenty-four hours after the test was conducted, the output broke open and began exhibiting anomalous properties that caused any writing implements within a meter circumference near the writing pen to change color from its natural hue to red. Further testing revealed the spread of the color-change to be contagious and cannot be controlled. Output and all affected objects incinerated; however, Junior Researcher van den Berg’s hands were stained with its ink when the output broke, rendering all the pens he handles red.##\n\n##red|//Note: How did the pen pass through anomalous screening without manifesting that? Now my hands are stained red because of the ink and it isn’t coming off even with a good scrubbing. - J.R. van den Berg//##\n\n##red|**Incident Report:** Reviewing the security footage at the time of this test showed that the D-class had moved the setting from “Fine” to “Very Fine” while Junior Researcher van den Berg was writing up the test particulars.##\n\n//Note: Offending D-class personnel has been terminated. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1651**\n**Name:** Intern Beauvillier\n**Date:** 16/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One 1-kg cube of rubber\n\n**Input:** The rubber cube\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A dozen small rubber frogs with seemingly perfect elasticity. Upon opening the booth, they ejected from Research Cell 109-B at a velocity of 50 km/h. The frogs bounced between the walls of the corridors, causing some structural damage, and destroying multiple windows and doors.\n\n//Note: Intern Beauvillier is to report to my office for a performance evaluation and for a discussion on workplace safety. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1652**\n**Name:** Researcher Connolly\n**Date:** 16/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Three copies of William Golding’s “Lord of the Flies”, three copies of an essay written by Researcher Connolly on human behaviour, three copies of the personnel record of Site-19 Facility 23\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of William Golding’s “Lord of the Gnats”, a copy of Researcher Connolly’s essay, and a copy of the personnel record. The contents of the three copies are unchanged from the originals, but with seemingly random words being replaced with the word “gnat”.\n\n**Input:** One of each of the initial items \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Upon opening the Output chamber, Research Cell 109-B was immediately flooded with a swarm of minuscule origami specks. Output neutralized by activating the fire sprinkler system. Further investigation concluded the origami creatures were in the shape of gnats. \n\n**Input:** One of each of the initial items \n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --A cloud of gnats.-- A pile of ash and a single piece of paper with the word “Scourge” written on it. Produces a memetic effect, causing the viewer to believe that they are being swarmed by insects. This effect spreads to anyone viewing the original victim. This resulted in a chain reaction that caused the majority of on-Site personnel to believe that the facility was being swarmed by gnats. Security Chief Sedna activated the on-Site quarantine blast doors and evacuated the rest of the facility. Effect lasted for two hours. Output incinerated.\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-1653**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Garinet\n**Date:** 16/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Four large cardboard boxes containing miscellaneous files\n\n//Note: These files were waiting to be shredded. - JR Garinet//\n\n**Input:** All of the aforementioned files\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A small amount of dried adhesive, an assortment of metal bits that appeared to have been staples, paperclips that have been straightened out, and the original files in a single stack.\n\n**Input:** Files from previous output\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Files, cut into 5cm^^2^^ pieces\n\n**Input:** Cut-up files from previous output\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Files, cut into 2.5cm^^2^^ pieces\n\n**Input:** Shredded files from previous output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A swarm of animate origami flies. Most were neutralized in the test chamber, but several thousand managed to escape into the rest of the facility through the ventilation system. They do not appear to be capable of causing any damage directly; however, they are disruptive and may present a fire hazard.\n\n//Note: Reminder that using 914 as a shredder or garbage disposal is generally frowned upon. - JR Boneka//\n\n//Note: Insecticides are a viable countermeasure. Junior Researcher Garinet is scheduled for evaluation in Dr. Veritas' office at my request. - Sedna//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-1654**\n**Name:** Weapons Researcher Markham\n**Date:** 16/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Two Beretta Px4 Storm pistols (loaded)\n\n**Input:** Beretta Px4 Storm pistol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A Welrod MkII pistol, lighter than a regular pistol of its make, and optimised for effective range. The pistol unexpectedly jammed during testing.\n\n//Note: Not a fan of this type of pistol anyways. I mean, bolt-action pistols? Why do they even exist? - WR Markham//\n\n**Input:** Beretta Px4 Storm pistol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Visibly unchanged pistol, but chambered in armor-piercing rounds. During testing, several personnel reported feeling unwell and were subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Analysis showed that the pistol anomalously mutates viral and bacterial agents to increase infectivity and promotes the buildup of toxins within a radius of 1.9 kilometres. Incinerated due to biohazard concerns.\n\n//Note: Our index case was a D-Class that was transferred to this facility eighteen days earlier. He was suspected to have contracted the virus from a security agent while transiting from Site-38 in Tennessee. Dr. Veritas has lodged an official complaint to the Director of Site-38, and both Site-38 and Facility-23 have been placed under quarantine. Nobody's leaving this facility for the next fourteen days, and both the Firing Range and the D-class quarters are under lockdown. We have contacted the Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale in case something goes wrong. - WR Markham//\n\n//Note: I have surgical masks but you need gloves to get them. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n//Note: How does one observe social distancing in a building with over a hundred people living in it? - JR Boneka//\n\n//Note: As long as the people infected get proper quarantine. That also includes any incoming and outgoing personnel since it came from another Site, which probably has a normal, non-914 strain I suppose. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n//Note: What Skye said. We had virologists analyze the 914 strain, and it's basically a mutated form of the strain from the Henderson Farm outbreak. While the process of mutation is anomalous, the mutated coronavirus exhibits no anomalous properties, so proper quarantine and personal hygiene should be sufficient. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: We've seen anomalous viruses before. The cafeteria will be closed until further notice. No personnel are to leave personal quarters for any reason not related to work. Risk groups will not leave their quarters at all, and are hereby on paid leave of absence. I'll arrange a team to deliver food and toiletries. Decontamination rooms are currently being installed. - Veritas//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-1655**\n**Name:** Researcher MacLean\n**Date:** 17/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One humidifier\n\n//Note: I accidentally bought a spare, so I thought I might as well use it for testing. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One humidifier\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A humidifier, appearance unaltered. When activated, it emits opaque steam that causes severe rashes or sores on contact with skin. Further testing showed that the rashes were caused by a unique strain of bacteria that appeared to thrive in the internal environment of the output. Affected personnel were quarantined, and released after symptoms abated. Object incinerated.\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-1656**\n**Name:** Intern Sora \n**Date:** 18/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One 5-kg bowling ball\n\n**Input:** Bowling ball\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged bowling ball. While the output was retrieved, security footage on the roof of the Facility captured the anomalous manifestation of several similar bowling balls in the sky, which proceeded to impact the building, causing minor structural damage. veral vibrations were detected on the facility roof. Outputted and retrieved bowling balls were all incinerated.\n\n//Note: The incinerator will be offline for the next couple of days due to serious physical impact sustained by the cooling units. If you want to get rid of something, the closest thing you can get to the incinerator will be the phosphorus grenades in the armoury. - Maintenance// \n\n//Note: Don’t forget to use a proper room to incinerate your items, such as the maintenance office. - Janitorial Manager [REDACTED]//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1657**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Date:** 19/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One wooden box, labelled with \"Schrodinger's cat\" in pencil, with a 50% chance of an image of a cat inside. “Randomness” was achieved by placing the image in one wooden box and given with another empty wooden box to Junior Researcher Kai to choose.\n\n//Note: Someone stole __every single leaf__ from the kat plant on my desk. Whoever you are, know that it’s now dead because of your addiction to anomalous paper-based stimulants. Here’s hoping I can get something similar to it from SCP-914. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** Above wooden box\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged box, now labelled with “Kai’s infestation”\n\n//Note: Incinerate it. Now. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Addendum:** En route to the incinerator room, the box crumbled away in the hands of the D-Class assigned to dispose of it, revealing a large carob pod. It was decided to temporarily store the pod in the high-security containment zone in Anomalous Storage, pending further research.\n\n//Note: Carobs are a member of the legume family, and they are commonly cultivated for their edible pods that resemble locu… oh dear. Locusts…// infestation. //- J.R. Kai//\n\n**Addendum:** Exactly nine minutes and fourteen seconds after the output was sealed in Anomalous Storage, security personnel were alerted to a containment breach in the high-security containment zone of “locust-like creatures”, which proved to be capable of anomalously “chewing” through metal and concrete (despite being made of paper). Site-19 Facility 23 was placed under lockdown while the locusts appeared to anomalously generate copies of themselves upon coming into contact with regular paper, with their projected trajectory appearing to have a final destination of SCP-914. Security personnel were armed with water hoses in an attempt to cut down the locust swarm and neutralisation efforts proved successful after half an hour. Minor injuries were sustained among personnel involved, but no deaths were logged.\n\n//Note: Never going to run duplicate tests ever again. And I’m going to run the soaked paper remains through on Rough. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** Seven kilograms of waterlogged paper locusts in a standard janitorial plastic bucket\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One highly-compressed brick of paper vaguely resembling SCP-914, several shards of the inputted plastic bucket, one large ice cube\n\n//Note: The rampant number of infestations in Facility 23 resulting from 914 lately is very concerning to me. What on Earth is happening? - JR Boneka//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1658**\n**Name:** Intern Rowan Skye, D-10548\n**Date:** 19/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One flashlight with a built-in hand crank\n\n**Input:** Hand-crank flashlight\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Visually smaller flashlight. D-Class was sent to retrieve the output and instructed to operate it. After three consecutive cranks of the flashlight, the D-Class reported the output as working as intended. The flashlight passed anomalous screening and was placed in Intern R. Skye's care.\n\n**Incident Report:** Twelve hours following the activation of the flashlight, both D-10548 and Intern R. Skye reported losing sight and feeling electric shocks on their right hands which dissipated an hour later. Twelve hours following the incident, a power surge was confirmed resulting in the loss of server connection and power outage. Intern R. Skye attempted to use the flashlight afterward to no avail. Anomalous re-screening showed a live wire located by the crank connected to an EMP charge and a tracking device. The tracking device was traced back to a Chaos Insurgency cell in [REDACTED]. Power has been restored and output is pending incineration.\n\n//Note: I got a scar on my hand today due to that live wire amongst the rashes. I hope I didn't lose any progress anyone made lately. The anomalous screening didn't even pick up the timed EMP charge. What's going on? - Intern R. Skye//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1659**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka\n**Date:** 20/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One 5-kg boulder\n\n//Note: I just found out what's happening. Somebody stop her! - Intern R. Skye//\n\n**Input:** One 5-kg boulder\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One stone statue of a gutted lamb carcass\n\n**Incident Report:** As the output booth door was opening, Intern R. Skye entered Research Cell 109-B and attempted to communicate something to JR Boneka. However, both personnel promptly collapsed. Simultaneously, ██ members of onsite personnel collapsed and subsequently entered a comatose state. The output was incinerated and all affected personnel were transferred to the facility’s infirmary, but extensive medical screening revealed no abnormalities. After investigation, the only connection found between all the affected personnel is that they are all the firstborn children of their respective households. Furthermore, the effect extended to immediate family members of onsite personnel, including older siblings and children. The comatose state was lifted after 72 hours, and all affected recovered without complications. Amnestics were administered to non-Foundation members.\n\n//Note: So it turns out that what R. Skye had figured out and was trying to tell me, was that the last test I performed somehow triggered the following ten tests to result in a 914-spurred parody of the Ten Deadly Plagues of Egypt. I think I can see that now: van den Berg’s red pen test resembles how the entire Nile river was turned to blood, and the power outage was an allusion to the darkness cast over Egypt. The incident that resulted from this test was a reference to the last plague, in which God culled the firstborn children in every Egyptian household. Looking back on it now, it was so obvious, but we didn’t connect the dots until it was too late. I suppose that I should be grateful that we were only temporarily comatose instead of killed. In any case, at least it’s over now. - JR Boneka//\n\n//Note: What worries me is if there is an \"Israelite\" here or if this is just one of 914's long-winded tricks… however, the event reminded me of my Sunday church preachings back in the Philippines on how the Plagues were a process of purification, so we must've learned something from all that. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n//Note: Do we have to start excluding religious texts from our inputs now? - R. Marcopus//\n\n//Note: Thankfully nothing serious happened this time. judging from the sheer number of apocalypses found in religious texts, it might be wise to do so to avoid an XK class scenario. - T.R. Boelli//\n\n//Note: The lockdown will last until Sedna gives me his word that everything is over.

The syringes are black except for a clear glass on the side of each syringe. Testing with D-class showed that the fluid in the syringe drastically increased the strength, speed, stamina, and pain tolerance of whoever has been injected with the fluid for approximately ten minutes. At the end of that period, the subject goes into immediate cardiac arrest. If the subject receives medical attention quickly enough and survives, no anomalous traits are observed to remain with the subject after revival. Four full syringes remained after testing. Two were sent to Research and Development to test if the solution could be diluted, while the others were placed into Anomalous Storage.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1661**\n**Name:** Intern Regal\n**Date:** 22/07/2020\n**Total items:** Three modified LEDs, several cables, three 9V batteries, one pair of standard Foundation visual protection goggles\n\n//Note: The LEDs have been modified to emit near-ultraviolet radiation outside the range where visible light is located in the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to the probable effects that such a test might cause, the D-Class handling the outputs will wear a pair of visual protection goggles with manual activation and deactivation on each lens. The LEDs will be connected to the batteries and turned on when placed inside 914. – Intern Regal//\n\n**Input:** One modified LED connected to a battery\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One electronic device with an integrated battery\n\n**Addendum:** It was determined that the device continuously emits the light of the same wavelength as the original LED. However, there appears to be no way to shut the device off.\n\n**Input:** One modified LED connected to a battery\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One LED connected to a battery. No anomalous effects were reported while observing it with visual protection. When observed by the naked eye, the light emitted by the LED shifts the observable portion of the electromagnetic spectrum of the observer, while not affecting the band of visible light. The alteration approximately lasts the number of seconds observed in hours. No lasting damage to the brain or the eyes have been recorded.\n\n//Note: Dr. Veritas, you're looking rather green... Hold on, why are the walls bright blue? - J.R. Kai//\n\n//Note: Since the next test will be performed on the Very Fine setting the D-Class has been instructed to only view the input and the output with his peripheral vision as to reduce the possible harm to him. – Intern Regal//\n\n**Input:** One modified LED connected to a battery\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One small circular device with an integrated LED in the centre with the anomalous effect of reversing the peripheral and focal vision clarity of anyone that views the light produce by the LED regardless of if it was observed through a direct or indirect medium. Output incinerated.\n\n**Addendum:**  The output’s effect caused distress to the D-Class, who reported difficulty walking and severely inhibited depth perception upon being interviewed. After a failed attempt to remotely retrieve the output, the output was covered and placed in the incinerator.\n\n//Note: After displaying sufficient levels of professionalism and work safety consideration, Lionel Regal will be hired as a Junior Researcher. Don’t make me regret this decision. - Dr. Arthur Hackett//\n\n//Note: Congratulations on the promotion, J.R. Regal. Once the lockdown is lifted, I'll throw you a party in the break room. - T.R.

Data unrecoverable.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned drives\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Several circuit boards along with several pieces of melted plastic. Data was corrupted and only a few words could be analyzed.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned drives\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One flash drive containing a copy of the video game 'World of Goo' \n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned drives\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Similar to input, but the amount of space the game's code took up on the flash drive is noticeably larger, taking up nearly all of the space on the drive. The game is now titled 'CARRION: Anniversary Edition' and is much longer than the original. Multiple new abilities, including three that were previously unused named 'Thermovision', 'Impregnation', and 'Acid Immunity' were introduced. Several new areas that utilize these mechanics were also added. A New Game Plus section is added, which appears after the player finishes the main game once. Playing this mode does not change the gameplay, but introduces various new enemy types and consumables.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned drives\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One flash drive. Anomalous screening revealed that the game, now titled 'CARRION: Augmented Reality Edition' contained a cognitohazard that activated as soon as the executable file is opened. The D-Class used for testing, once under its influence, perceived themselves as the carnivorous entity controlled by the player in the game and attempted to \"hunt\" and consume other personnel. However, since no actual physical change manifested, the subject was unable to cause any actual harm to others around them or damage to Facility 23 and was easily apprehended and amnesticized.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1663**\n**Name:** Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 26/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Five kg of modeling clay, one USB flash drive containing the entirety of the \"Madness Combat\" animation series by user \"Krinkels\" on the website Newgrounds.\n\n//Note: My transfer request finally pushed through, we're gonna test 914's cultural inclination. - R. Szymons//\n\n**Input:** The above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An inanimate clay figure standing 71.12 cm upright, resembling the \"Grunt\" entity from the aforementioned series. A small plaque lays positioned at the base with the words \"Rich\" made from pieces of the USB drive. \n\n//Note: I expected Hank, but at least 914 seems to understand my favorite character. Permission to keep the figure? - R. Szymons//\n\n//Note: Get it screened first. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1664**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Reimer\n**Date:** 28/07/2020\n**Total Items:** Three copies of //Jennifer Government//, three copies of //1984//\n\n**Input:** //Jennifer Government//, //1984//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A copy of //Industrial Society and Its Future//\n\n//Note: And of all possibilities, it's got to be Kaczynski. - JR Reimer//\n\n**Input:** //Jennifer Government//, //1984//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A manifiesto, titled //Будущее правительств и корпораций// (//The Future of Governments and Corporations//), written in Russian. The author was identified as ████ █████████ █████████.\n\n//Note: I had translated the manifesto, and it is concerning to say the least. By the author's definition of \"government\", the Foundation is on an equal level with the United Nations, which should be torn down for transhumanist ideals. Corporations are seen as a hallmark of neo-feudalism, and should also be eliminated. In particular, the papers named [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/marshall-carter-and-dark-hub Skitter Marshall, Iris Dark], Bill Gates, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3914 Tom Alberg, Patricia Stonesifer], [http://www.scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-wondertainment-hub Isabel Wondertainment], Jack Ma, and Ren Zhengfei as highest-priority subjects marked for immediate termination. - JR Reimer//\n\n**Input:** //Jennifer Government//, //1984//\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An object that can only be described as a cognitohazard. Any attempt to describe the object otherwise results in the manifestation of a lethal cognitohazard.\n\n//Note: We had three D-class personnel attempt to describe the object, and all they could describe was the cognitohazard that manifested. The cognitohazards appeared to be related to totalitarian governments and organizations. Object incinerated. - JR Reimer//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1665**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Boneka\n**Date:** 28/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One 0.5 kg block of dark chocolate, one 0.5 kg block of white chocolate, one 0.5 kg block of milk chocolate\n\n**Input:** One 0.5 kg block of dark chocolate, one 0.5 kg block of white chocolate\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One disassembled jigsaw puzzle made of chocolate. The image on the puzzle is a photo-realistic rendition of ''Jeff the Mug Cat'', created using dark and white chocolate.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5 kg block of milk chocolate\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One computer keyboard made entirely of milk chocolate. When plugged into a computer, the output functions as a normal keyboard, despite having no electronic components. However, it cannot be used for long periods of time, as the heat from the user’s fingers would cause the keys to start melting.\n\n//Note: Against command, the testing D-Class attempted to consume the keyboard, and was restrained. Fortunately, no other anomalous effects manifested, and what remained of the output was incinerated. D-Class reassigned. - JR Boneka//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1666**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 29/07/2020\n**Total Items:** One set of rubber gloves, three DVDs containing a single copy of a photograph of a teddy bear, two windshield wipers, 50 grams of ground up dried anchovies, 100 grams of ground up dried sunflower root, four 10cm by 10cm by 3mm panes of Pyrex glass, three 1m long bars of steel, one small brilliant cut diamond, three sets of safety scissors, one chainsaw, three stacks of A4 size copy paper each containing a copy of Shakespeare’s //Hamlet//\n\n**Input:** One set of rubber gloves, two DVDs, one copy of //Hamlet//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One DVD containing an unidentified recording of a performance of the play //Hamlet//, a set of small rigid plastic gloves, and a stack of American letter size paper with an irregularly shaped hole apparently burnt through the entire stack. The recording contained within the DVD features actors with the appearance and voice of several research personnel assigned to SCP-914. None of the researchers observed in the recording have a recollection of ever participating in such a performance. The plastic gloves appear to be made from the material from a DVD disk, and are too small to be worn by a human subject. The outputted stack of paper is noticeably thicker than the input, and is entirely blank. Despite its appearance, the stack of paper appears to retain its previous mass in solid form. The hole in the stack of paper was covered by an irregular pattern of rubber, with the appearance of having been splattered onto the paper from an uncertain origin and solidified.\n\n**Input:** One DVD, 30 grams of anchovy powder, two panes of Pyrex glass\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A small teddy bear roughly matching the appearance of the one in the original photograph made of Pyrex glass and a translucent plastic ball with what appears to be multiple identical small anchovies inside.\n\n**Input:** One windshield wiper, one diamond, one set of safety scissors\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A small toy car made from the materials of the windshield wiper, one small irregular chunk of graphite, and one large rectangular sheet of plastic with what appears to be a safety manual for scissors written on one side.\n\n//Note: It looks like they all changed independently of each other. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** 20 grams of anchovy powder, 20 grams of sunflower root powder, one bar of steel, one pane of pyrex glass, one copy of //Hamlet//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 40 grams of unidentified organic dust, a small steel model that appears to be a stylized depiction of a person stealing from a bar, an unlabelled beaker, and a stack of A4 size printing paper with the text of the SCP-914 document repeated 340 times in fine print. The steel model and the organic dust was stored inside the beaker at the time of output.\n\n**Input:** One windshield wiper, one pane of Pyrex glass, two sets of safety scissors, one chainsaw\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A small handheld machine of indeterminate purpose, with the words “THE GOOD VERY GREAT WAAIPERSLICER”(sic) written in large block letters on the outside of the handle. The handle is connected to a cylindrical body with a featureless plastic casing, and two different appendages protrude from each side. The longer appendage is a rectangular double sided saw blade, which rapidly vibrates vertically(in the direction perpendicular to the length of the blade and parallel to its flat surface) when a button on its side is pressed. The vibration will stop after the button is pressed again. The shorter appendage appears to be a plastic shaft that branches into three smaller shafts, each connected to a large plastic knife blade, a small squeegee, and a Pyrex glass monocle on a plastic chain, respectively. The shorter appendage --does not move-- starts rotating counterclockwise when Researcher Cho laughs audibly in its vicinity. The rotation will stop once she laughs again after a delay longer than five seconds.\n\n//Note: This was probably the most confusing output I’ve encountered yet. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** 60 grams of sunflower root powder, one bar of steel\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A small animate steel model of a sunflower plant’s root system, with a soft organic bulb-like appendage at the top. When in motion, the object will accumulate its “roots” into four limbs and proceed in a slow quadrupedal walking motion. When stationary, it will spread its “roots” back apart. The object is not hostile and appears to ignore attempts at interaction.\n\n//Note: The next test will be on Very Fine. I’ve taken necessary precautions to ensure whatever comes out doesn’t escape, especially since the inputs are so chaotic. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** One bar of steel, 20 grams of sunflower root powder, one copy of //Hamlet//\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A large, virtually indestructible white sphere capable of motion and speech, as well as visual and auditory perception of its surroundings. Upon leaving the output booth, the object interacted briefly with D-99823 and Researcher Cho before being captured and put into containment.

The watch no longer displays time but now displays the temperature and pressure of a random environment.\n\n**Input:** One digital watch\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Visually unchanged watch with the display no longer functioning. No anomalous effects were observed when held.\n\n//Note: Something seems... off. The D-Class will be restrained and will test the output. - Researcher Ken//\n\n//Addendum: During testing, the watch was strapped on to the restrained D-class. Security noted that the D-Class paced around the testing area, appearing to move in slow motion until the watch's effect wore off in 24 hours. No anomalous effects were recorded for the next 24 hours, after which the same effects manifested again.//\n\n//Note: Interesting, this watch effectively slows down the user's perception of time, thus causing everything except themselves to speed up. The D-class stated that 1 hour felt like 1 minute to him and everything around him was moving extremely fast. I don't think this has any practical purposes however.

The rifle has no missing parts due to the similarities of design between the inputted rifle and the output. \n\n**Input:** Aforementioned model\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate plastic model resembling the input, with the tank treads modified to provide enough traction for the output to move. The output displays limited signs of sentience, recognising personnel by blood, attempting to assault any person with Slavic, Dutch, French, English, or (sometimes) Italian nationality or heritage (Allied powers of WWII) by ''aiming'' its main cannon or hull-mounted machine gun and anomalously vocalising sounds of gunfire. Due to the lack of additional mass and propellant for ammunition, no projectiles were observed to be fired out of the output. The SS tank commander figurine in the commander’s hatch is animated and vocalises era-appropriate German whenever it orders the tank to assault an individual by hurling repeated insults at the victim until the \"attack\" ends. The output attempted to attack and insult Researcher Szymons due to his Polish heritage. Output was placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1675**\n**Name:** Dr. Green\n**Date:** 12/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Five sheets of paper with an illustration of the cat within [[[SCP-040-JP]]]\n\n//[Warning: The following experiment is prohibited for viewing without proper memetic countermeasures.]//\n\n//Note: Due to the potential of the refined outputs producing the effects of SCP-040-JP, all personnel except for those with Class-D classification were required to wear video-capturing goggles during testing. Subject D-300294 was instructed to only view the Output booth during the entirety of testing. This was done to see if the effects of SCP-040-JP will occur in the refined items. - Dr. Green//\n\n**Input:** One illustration\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of shredded paper with traces of ink \n\n**Input:** One illustration\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A sheet of paper and a puddle of ink \n\n**Input:** One illustration\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A sheet of paper with a crude drawing of a dog. The dog has human-like eyes, similar in appearance to the illustration of the cat within SCP-040-JP. D-300294 was suffering an alternate effect of SCP-040-JP. Constantly repeating the phrase \"There's a dog\" instead of a cat. D-300294 was administered proper amnestics and was given the same instructions as before. \n\n**Input:** One illustration\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A photorealistic sketch of the cat within SCP-040-JP. It produced the same effects as SCP-040-JP and D-300294 was given amnestics. \n\n**Input:** One illustration\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A paper cut-out of an illustration of the cat within SCP-040-JP. Upon the Output door opening, D-300294 vocalized the phrase \"There's a cat\" multiple times in a distressed tone, showing that it produces the effects of SCP-040-JP. The cat walked out of the booth in a erratic manner and attempted to leave Research Cell 109-B by sliding itself under the door. It was then neutralized via incineration to prevent personnel within Facility 23 from suffering its effects. All personnel exposed to the cat were administered amnestics shortly afterwards. \n\n//[End of Memetic Hazard.]//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1676**\n**Name:** Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 12/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One piece of college ruled paper\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned paper\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A Möbius strip made from the entire piece of paper. Output generates a cognitohazardous effect wherein whoever views it will attempt to orient the object on a single face. The output affected Researcher Szymons first. After approximately five minutes of trying to orient the object with one face up, R. Szymons became frustrated and attempted to incinerate the output. Object incinerated with a robotic arm.\n\n//Note: My head hurts more than that time when I blinded myself with the goggles. To whoever the strip affected, I’m immensely sorry for conducting this test. - R. Szymons//\n\n//Note: Not to worry, their treatment cost will come out of your salary, so consider it even. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1677**\n**Name:** Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 12/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One Velocity Systems “SCARAB” model plate carrier, one Gentex Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), two AR500 ceramic bulletproof plates\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned plate carrier\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One “Slickster” model plate carrier made by Ferro Concepts. No missing parts have been identified from the input.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned ACH\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** An M1916 Stahlhelm made of composite and high hardness rolled steel from the input. No anomalous effects have been observed when the output helmet is worn.\n\n**Input:** One AR500 plate\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A visually unchanged plate from the input. During testing at the onsite armory, D-32423 shot the plate with a .40 S&W round from a Jericho 943. The output shattered immediately and the bullet ricochet back towards D-32423 in an extremely precise trajectory, killing him instantly by impacting above the glabella.\n\n**Input:** One AR500 plate\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A visually unchanged plate from the input. When shot with conventional firearms, there was no visual difference from the input. An anomalous effect was observed when the plate was attached to a human being and shot with any caliber. Whenever a round impacts the plate, it will multiply the impact force via unknown means and by varying amounts. This effect causes differing damage to the body, from welts and bruises to broken bones and internal bruises. D-35672 has been admitted to the infirmary with a broken rib after being shot in the chest with a 7.62 x 39mm round. Object has been placed in Anomalous storage.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1678**\n**Name:** Researcher Bat, D-97993\n**Date:** 12/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One pill of Class-Y Mnestics\n\n**Input:** Class-Y Mnestic\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged pill. D-97993 was instructed to consume the pill and remain on standby in an isolated containment cell. After nine minutes, the subject abruptly pointed at the supervising Level-3 researcher, claiming that he would receive a gunshot wound to his leg in the near future. When asked how he knew this, the subject reported a newfound ability to see \"glimpses\" into the future when viewing another person, reciting events that have yet to unfold, most of them relevant to his future condition as a D-class personnel. After fourteen minutes, D-97993 began vocalising expletives, claiming that he now knew what would happen to him at the end of the month, and attempted to breach containment by breaking the observation panel. The subject was restrained by security personnel, but collapsed while being removed from the cell, mumbling and twitching uncontrollably before expiration. Autopsy results proved inconclusive regarding anomalous causes of expiration, discovering only the simultaneous presentation of multiple giant aneurysms of the three major coronary arteries, likely due to stress induced by anomalous effects of the output.\n\n//Addendum: Three days after the experiment, SCP-███ breached containment at Site-19. Level-3 researcher ████████ ████ was caught in the crossfire during recontainment efforts by on-site security, sustaining one gunshot wound to his leg, which was treated after recontainment was achieved.//\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1679**\n**Name:** Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 12/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Five AK-15 assault rifles (magazine removed)\n\n**Input:** One AK-15\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of metal scraps and melted plastic\n\n**Input:** One AK-15\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A perfectly disassembled AK-15, parts sorted neatly into groups\n\n**Input:** One AK-15\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** An M4 modular assault rifle, with a pile of extra composite in the output booth\n\n**Input:** One AK-15\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** An FB Radom Wz.96 Beryl assault rifle, with a small pile of composite materials left to the side of the output\n\n\n//Note: Using a D-Class as precaution for this next test. - R. Szymons//\n\n**Input:** One AK-15\n**Setting:** Very Fine \n**Output:** A fully animated statue of a Kamchatka Brown Bear made from materials of the input. When D-93927 attempted to retrieve the output, it attacked him by scratching at D-93927’s hands and throat. Due to its reduced size, the output was contained after Researcher Szymons led it into a lockbox. Lockbox with the output has been placed in Anomalous Storage, while D-93927 has been admitted to the infirmary with minor laceration wounds.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 168X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 168X Test Logs\"]]\n\n----\n**Test 914-1680**\n**Name:** Weapons Researcher Markham\n**Date:** 13/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Four CZ 75 variant pistols \n\n**Input:** One CZ 75 pistol (original, Czech variant)\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One NZ-75 (Chinese variant of CZ 75).

Object is currently being screened for anomalies, and will be returned to Junior Researcher Singley pending completion.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1687**\n**Name:** Researcher Zita Ni\n**Date:** 19/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One note (containing the Python code for the \"Hello, World!\" program, that would display \"Hello 914, I'm Zita.\" when run), three flash drives each containing a default Windows screensaver file\n\n//Note: Hello everyone, I've just been transferred from Site-64. - R. Zita//\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned note\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A note, containing the C++ code for a variant of the \"Hello, World!\" program. Running the program results in a schematic of the input booth of SCP-914.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A flash drive containing a screensaver file. When applied, it displays a \"Duckroll\" image.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A flash drive containing a program titled scr.exe. When run on a computer, the computer's screensaver would be replaced by a random image. No particular theme is noted.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A miniature holographic projector. When activated, a holographic projection appears. Pointing it at any computer would reveal the computer's hardware specifications, as well as the operating system it is using. However, no means of recharging the device is found.\n\n//Note: Placed in Anomalous Storage. - R. Zita//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1688**\n[DATA LOST]\n----\n**Test 914-1689**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Mikk Rästa\n**Date:** 19/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Three pieces of printing paper with a printed image of a hypercube.\n\n//Note: Testing to see if and how SCP-914 perceives the theory of the fourth dimension. Skipping Coarse and Rough because ordinary printing paper has already been put through it before. - J.R. Mikk//\n\n**Input:** One image\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Printing paper with an image of a fractal.\n\n//Note: The fractal seems to end at the fifth loop. A shame, an infinite fractal on a piece of paper could've been fascinating to see. - J.R. Mikk//\n\n**Input:** One image\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A piece of printing paper with a cube of ink drawn into it. The cube appears three-dimensional no matter what side the subject is observing it at. This phenomenon only works for the nearest person with a direct line of sight towards the paper.\n\n//Note: Very disorienting. It looks almost as if you could put your hand in the paper and grab the cube, but instead you just hit the paper and stain your hand in printer ink. Permission to frame it up in the break room? - J.R. Mikk//\n\n**Input:** One image\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --Ordinary cube-- Hypercube made of paper. It has the anomalous effect of making everyone that observes it perceive it as an ordinary cube of paper. The effect does not materialize when viewed through a digital screen, and viewers that are not actively attempting to ascertain its appearance see it as a cloud of ink. The item's properties made it extremely chemically unstable, and it decayed into carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas over the course of five hours. A Bunsen burner was activated in the testing room due to an unrelated experiment, causing a small explosion and a minor fire, which was extinguished by a custodian that was nearby.\n\n//Note: Junior Researcher Mikk Rästa later apologized for his reckless behavior and promised to compensate for any equipment lost in the fire.//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 169X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 169X Test Logs\"]]\n\n----\n**Test 914-1690**\n**Name:** Intern R. Skye\n**Date:** 19/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Five flash drives containing a media player written in Java\n\n//Note: Testing the virtual efficiency of SCP-914. This is also my last log before being promoted to junior researcher status. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One visually unchanged flash drive. When connected to a computer, a corrupted file of the same size as the inputted program was found. When the corrupted space was recovered using a recovery program, the drive's corruption is revealed to be the source code of an unknown program. Compiling the code deemed impossible due to nonexistent dependencies. Flash drive wiped and incinerated after storage module was corrupted after format.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One visually unchanged flash drive. Its contents are similar to an obfuscated Java source code of the media player. The obfuscation map is different from its original mapping. Deobfuscated code similarly required dependencies that did not exist. Flash drive wiped and returned to Intern R. Skye.\n\n//Note: Something to take note of, 914 at these tests focused on the program itself. The same hopefully can be said in the later tests. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One visually unchanged flash drive. The media player program was identified to have been written in C++. Flash drive wiped and returned to Intern R. Skye.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged flash drive. The flash drive has no content.\n\n**Addendum:** During file testing, Intern R. Skye placed a sound file on the flash drive. After being ejected, the sound file was played from the flash drive itself. Output placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n**Input:** One flash drive\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small automaton built from the flash drive. Intern R. Skye immediately requested containment of the output as soon as visual contact was established. Output neutralized and incinerated.\n\n//Note: The output resembled and acted akin to a ''Decepticon'' from the \"Transformers\" franchise. - Intern R. Skye//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1691**\n**Name:** Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 20/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One XM25 Grenade Launcher, one KPV heavy machine gun (HMG), one M18 Claymore mine \n\n//Note: I have finally been officially certified as a Weapons Researcher. As a way of celebrating, I'll be testing with some more esoteric weapons today. - W.R. Szymons//\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned XM25\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An assortment of cylindrical objects made from the materials of the input. Outputs resemble 40 x 46mm NATO grenades.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned HMG\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Visually unchanged machine gun. During live-fire tests the output misfired, disfiguring the barrel and sending superheated gases in all directions. Output incinerated.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned mine\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** [TEST DENIED]\n\n//Note: I shouldn't have to explain to you all why experimenting with a military grade explosive is a bad idea. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1692**\n**Name:** Intern Francois Beauvillier\n**Date:** 20/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One flash drive containing a text file of //This Perfect Day// by Ira Levin, one paperback copy of //1984// by George Orwell, one paperback copy of //Animal Farm// by George Orwell, one paperback copy of //Farenheit 451// by Ray Bradbury\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a text file of //This Perfect Day// by Ira Levin\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One flash drive containing a single .jar executable. Every attempt made to decompile the file was met with failure due to various technical deficiencies. When executed, a log file will be created, depicting 'The Most Effective Way of Life' for every person in a 200-metre radius, followed by ten genome sequences with five for each gender. Subsequent analysis and simulations revelaed that said genomes would express traits considered to be 'ideal' by most people. The 'Most Effective Way of Life' describes the life of each individual, from birth to death, should they live in a totalitarian communist utopia.\n\n//Note: Interesting, to say the least. Although I don't see myself becoming a plumber anytime soon. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One paperback copy of //1984// by George Orwell\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One paperback copy of //1914// by Coarse Roughwell, presumed to be a pseudonym of some unidentified individual. The novel mostly contains the same plot as that of the inputted material, but most scenes are replaced with various locations in [*http://www.scpwiki.com/experiment-log-914-hub Site-19 Facility 23]. Agent Sedna replaces Big Brother while Dr. Veritas replaces Emmanuel Goldstein.\n\n**Input:** One paperback copy of //Farenheit 451// by Ray Bradbury\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A non-anomalous pile of ashes\n\n//Note: I really should've expected that. - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n**Input:** One paperback copy of //Animal Farm// by George Orwell\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One document titled //Facility 23, or How to Overthrow the Directors// by the same author as before, Coarse Roughwell. The contents of said document describes multiple ways to initiate a coup d'état against Dr. Veritas, Agent Sedna, and Facility Director Hackett. The reader will anomalously experience a strong aversion against any form of authority.\n\n//Note: Off with their heads! Down with the ruling class! - Intern Beauvillier//\n\n//Note: Intern Beauvillier was restrained and amnesticized after trying to attack security personnel. I didn't mean to punch him in the face, but if a crazed Frenchman bolts at you yelling ''viva la révolution'', certain self-preservation instincts kick in. Tell him I'll buy him a beer when he feels better. - Agent Sedna//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1693**\n**Name:** Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 21/08/2020\n**Total Items:** One PPSh-71 submachine gun, two Tokarev TT-33 sidearms, one American M17 gas mask with cover, one Soviet GP-5 gas mask.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned SMG\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One Owen machine carbine submachine gun, missing metal parts have been replaced with wood from the input.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned sidearms\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate statue of former Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Fedor Tokarev, made from materials of the input. Output seems to exhibit limited sapience. The output anomalously vocalizes boasts proclaiming superiority of the former Soviet Union to its rivals. Object has been placed in anomalous storage.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned M17\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** A visually unchanged gas mask. When worn by D-94629, subject vocalized an inability to breathe. Output was removed from D-94629 before he could expire. On further examination, when the output is placed upon a human subject it will block any incoming oxygen through the filters. Thus causing death via asphyxiation if worn for too long.\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned GP-5 \n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A visually unchanged gas mask. When put on D-75632, she vocalized confusion and worry. When asked to elaborate, D-75632 described seeing an environment noted to be similar to that of [[[SCP-1499]]]. Once removed, D-75632 stated she no longer experienced the hallucinations immediately after removal of the output. Output has been placed in anomalous storage.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1694**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry\n**Date:** 27/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Four digital thermometers\n\n**Input:** One digital thermometer\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One barometer\n\n**Input:** One digital thermometer\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One hygrometer\n\n**Input:** One digital thermometer\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One digital thermometer, calibrated to read 0 when measuring a normal human body temperature.\n\n**Input:** One digital thermometer\n**Setting:** Very fine\n**Output:** One digital thermometer. Readings display in Fahrenheit, Celsius or Kelvin depending on which the user is least familiar with. If a user knows every scale, the value is displayed in ''Wingdings''.\n\n//Note: When multiple people looked at it simultaneously, it short-circuited. Seemingly in defiance. - Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1695**\n**Name:** J.R. Regal\n**Date:** 27/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Various flash drives each containing a Java executable program and sheets of paper with inputs for the programs\n\n//Note: I want to test how 914 handles this type of relation between non-physical programs and physical entries. – J.R. Regal//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a Java executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One flash drive containing a C++ executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a Java executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One flash drive containing a Javascript executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n\n//Note: Not getting any notable results on this setting, moving to Fine. – J.R. Regal//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a Java executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One flash drive containing the original program as well as a text file named \"Input\". The flash drive has the same mass as the total of the inputted items\n\n//Note: Improvements in transportability and size, it seems. – J.R. Regal//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a Java executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One flash drive containing a file and a sheet of paper with a line in the middle. The file cannot be opened or inspected. If a valid input is written on the upper half, the output for the original program will slowly appear on the bottom side.\n\n//Note: This last test will be conducted by a D-Class for safety reasons. We're expecting a flash drive as the output, so we will set up a modified isolated computer for testing purposes. The contents of the program and input are unlikely to cause physical harm that would threaten the ability of the D-Class to test it, so no extra protection was provided. – J.R. Regal//\n\n**Input:** One flash drive containing a Java executable program and a sheet of paper with inputs for the program\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One flash drive and a sheet of paper full of inscriptions\n\n**Addendum:** When the D-Class picked up the output he remained unresponsive for 30 seconds before dropping it. Interrogation after the D-Class regained consciousness revealed that making contact with the flash drive caused him to view lines of symbols and maintaining to see the word “mentally” whenever he closed his eyes after the experience ended.\n\n//Note: After collecting as much information as possible from the D-class after he recovered, I believe that coming into contact with the flash drive forces the mind of the subject to process information via a program known as \"Brainfuck\", an esoteric programming language not intended for practical use, by going through the internal lines of logic. From this, I deduce that 914 is beginning to create outputs to get around security measures put into place, which is rather concerning, to say the least. – J.R. Regal//\n\n//Note: Your concerns are duly noted, Regal, but unless the machine proves to be sentient, spontaneously grows legs and tries to leave the room, we're not sounding the priority alert quote yet. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1696**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Date:** 31/08/2020\n**Total Items:** Four impossible bottles featuring replicas of various iconic ships from history\n\n**Input:** One impossible bottle featuring the //USS Constitution//\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Five miniature impossible bottles featuring the //HMS Guerriere//, //HMS Java//, //HMS Pictou//, //HMS Cyane//, and //HMS Levant//\n\n//Note: A clever reference to five \"inferior\" ships with the Coarse setting. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** One impossible bottle featuring the //Santa Maria//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One impossible bottle featuring the //La Navida//\n\n**Input:** One impossible bottle featuring the //HMS Victory//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One glass-and-wood model of the //RMS Titanic//, containing a cognitohazard that causes affected personnel who have come into contact with it to believe that they are about to drown onboard the //RMS Titanic// despite having been presented evidence that such an incident is impossible.\n\n//Note: Dr. Veritas, please! Hold my hand, for we are about to die onboard this ship, and I wish that my last memories be happy and of you! - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Addendum:** The effect was temporarily worsened by Dr. Veritas' acquisition of a filled janitorial bucket and then dispelled when he emptied its contents over the head of Junior Researcher Kai.\n\n**Input:** One impossible bottle featuring the //USS Arizona//\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One impossible bottle featuring a miniature replica of a ship's magazine. Output was ignited via unknown means when retrieved by D-41969 and exploded, terminating the D-class via the initial supersonic over-pressurization shock wave from the detonation of the output. Resulting remains of both D-class and output could not be retrieved, due to anomalously-sustained smouldering. Testing for the day has been halted until the remains become cool enough to be disposed of.\n\n//Note: While this may not be your fault, the bill for the replacement floor tiles in Research Cell 109-B will be forwarded to Junior Researcher Kai. No hard feelings. - Maintenance//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1697**\n**Name:** J.R. Regal\n**Date:** 02/09/2020\n**Total Items:** One USB drive with a program with an unknown error\n\n//Note: Since I gave up on finding what causes the compiling error I’ll use it for a test. – J.R. Regal//\n\n**Input:** One USB drive with a program with an unknown error\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One USB drive with a program that causes all other programs stored in the same PC to develop compiling errors. The program itself runs without the original error.\n\n//Note: Few times I have been so happy to be cautious. I don’t know what I would have done if it had affected my PC.  – J.R. Regal//\n\n//Note: Or the network. Rosen would have thrown you in the incinerator, or at least try to get permission for it. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1698**\n**Name:** Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons\n**Date:** 03/09/2020\n**Total Items:** One Hispano-Suiza HS.404 autocannon, one boxed copy of //Call of Duty: Black Ops//, one copy of //Battlefield 4//, one copy of //Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare//\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned autocannon\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A visually unchanged cannon from the input. Testing revealed recoil to be far greater to the input, and for the output to anomalously use twice as much ammunition than the original. Object has been placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n**Input:** Copy of //Call of Duty: Black Ops//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A mini figurine of a CRT television made from pieces of the box and disk from the input. The figurine’s screen will display a Nixie tube which randomly displays numbers from 1-30.\n\n**Input:** Copy of //Battlefield 4//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A miniature diorama of a fictional, war-torn version of Shanghai, China made from pieces of the box and disk from the input. The fires and falling buildings are anomalously animated, tiny helicopters can sometimes be observed flying around the diorama’s skyscrapers. \n\n**Input:** Copy of //Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare//\n**Setting:** Fine \n**Output:** A 1:40 scale model of “Little Boy”, the nuclear bomb used to destroy Hiroshima, Japan. \n\n//Note: I’ve screened all the models and I’m keeping the bomb and the TV in my office, the Shanghai diorama is up for grabs for whoever wants it. - WR. Szymons//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1699**\n**Name:** Researcher Anderson, Researcher Smith\n**Date:** 03/09/2020\n**Total Items:** Three notes with the words \"SCP-914, are you able to communicate with me?\" written on them\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned notes\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A note with the same message but translated into Hindi.\n\n**Input:** Output of the previous test\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A note with the same message but translated into Russian.\n\n**Input:** Output of the previous test\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A note with unknown symbols on it, theorized to mean the same as the previous notes.\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned notes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Several small pieces of paper seemingly cut and folded into letters to say \"SCP-914, are you able to communicate with me?\"\n\n**Input:** One of the aforementioned notes\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A piece of paper folded to look like a mouth. The paper mouth levitated to face SCP-914 and vocalized the words \"SCP-914, are you able to communicate with me?\" seemingly in Researcher Anderson's voice, and fell to the ground.\n\n**Input:** All of the above outputs\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of paper shreds and a small pile of graphite.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[/experiment-log-914/offset/16 Notice: Continued in 17XX ->]",
