Domestication attempts are to continue as a Septem-level priority to the Foundation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4055-J is an extremely hostile breed of dog. Its diet consists of garbage and it has a hairless, prehensile tail. SCP-4055-J instances regard humans with extreme contempt and will violently resist all attempts of domestication. \n\nWhen given basic commands of \"sit\" and \"fetch\", SCP-4055-J instances will either feign death or attack their master. One specimen, upon hearing the phrase \"who's a good boy,\" proceeded to violently defecate on the floor while foaming at the mouth.\n\nIt is believed that a black market ring of dog breeders in association with the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent's Hand]]] created SCP-4055-J through the hybridization of a chihuahua and an unknown canid/mollusk entity.[[footnote]]It is possible these are the same parties responsible for breeding [[[SCP-2008-J]]].[[/footnote]] The motive for this breed's generation is currently unknown, but is speculated to involve the discouragement of pet ownership as a form of slavery.\n\n**Addendum - Experiment log 59-C:**\n\n> **Dr. Henderson:** Please approach the specimen.\n> \n> (D-41924 approaches)\n> \n> (SCP-4055-J-3458 feigns death)\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Please give the specimen a belly rub.\n> \n> **D-41924:** You sure that's a dog?

You will now do as you have been told, or face termination.\n> \n> **D-41924:** Okay, I guess.\n> \n> (D-41924 gives SCP-4055-J-3458 a belly rub. SCP-4055-J-3458 hisses and proceeds to shred D-41824's hand. Test concluded)",
