Pieces of the pavement jump out at odd angles, but there seems to be less open violence here than elsewhere. Towards the top of a building, a green, coiled snake is painted, with the words \"S.O. Forever!\" written underneath in glowing script. The doors are shuttered, and nobody is probably willing to let you in.\n\nAfter some more walking, you come upon a lone mage in combat with... what was once a dragon. The mage is very distinctive, with pale skin and flowing tattoos down the right side of her body, starting on her face and continuing beneath the robes. The dragon is covered in odd, five-pointed sigils, and has two heads, with three more starting to grow out. The mage shoots a gout of fire at the dragon with one hand, forming a shield around it with her other. At first, the dragon seems as if it's going to cook... and then it spreads all five of its wings, breaking out of the bubble and flying off. The mage is knocked back onto her rear.\n\nThen, she looks up to see you, an uncertain grin on her face. \"Seems I'm almost out of spells for the day,\" she laughs. \"Think you could help? I'll make it worthwhile.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote simple\"]]\n\nThis is **Acorn Lowell**, a magus of the Serpent's Order. The Order is a collective of mages and monsters from across all of reality, united in their goal: the preservation of magic. While initially hesitant to trust the avatars, Acorn reveals that the source of the Aberration is at the center of the city, in a cathedral built by the **Pentad Church**. She notes that the party could hypothetically destroy the Aberration at the root if they were to get to this location and fight it off. She's willing to help further if the Avatars help to slay the Aberrant Dragon. If they do, the Serpent's Order will grant the party **N-Space Rings**. These devices will allow them to traverse the city by undoing its spatial warping.\n\nIf the party attempts to walk away from Acorn's location without **N-Space Rings**, they inevitably find themselves walking towards them again, as space confusingly loops around them.\n\nThe Aberrant Dragon circles around again for another attack soon after.\n\nAcorn will aid in their fight.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= @@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(32deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) 80%, #1d3e14 100%); border: none; border-top: medium solid var(--accentColor); box-shadow: none; padding: 1rem; filter: drop-shadow(0px 0px 10px #000); border-radius: 15px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**##lime|Ally##**\n++++++ [[size 170%]]**Acorn Lowell**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n* **Sun's Fist** (d8 Damage; a flaming fist is conjured from the sky)\n* **Serpent's Summons** (d8 Damage; a spectral serpent is summoned from the ground to bite at the target)\n------\n[[div class=\"fancyborder\" style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Macondo', var(--body-font); font-size: 1.5rem; justify-content: space-between; color: var(--accentColor); padding: 0 1rem 0 1rem;\"]]\n[[div]]\nHP **8**\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\nSTR **13**\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\nDEX **12**\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\nCTRL **16**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n**Quotes:**\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"box-shadow: none; background: transparent;\"]]\n//\"Let's kick some dragon ass.\"//\n\n//\"Fire, yeah, I can do fire.
