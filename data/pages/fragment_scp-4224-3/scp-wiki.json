This document will then be forwarded to the Memetics, Archives and Secrecy Departments, who will then develop cognitohazards and literature to accommodate the changes. From here, SCP-4224 becomes relevant. \n\nSCP-4224-1 instances are forced into believing the alternative history is true via amnestics and soporifics. Next, SCP-4224-1 instances are neurodegenerated to remove all non-historical memory. DR-O1 is then harvested from SCP-4224-1 instances and dispersed around the globe. \n\nThis results in the Foundation being granted control of humanity's memories. This will no doubt aid in the Foundation's goals. \n[[>]]\n- Level 3 Researcher, Heather Everwood.\n[[/>]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n@@------@@\nOverseer Discussion\n@@------@@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"nolinks\"]]\nResearcher Selks'[[footnote]] This comment was added before Researcher Selks' plagiarism was discovered. [[/footnote]] Ennui Protocol has been sat on PENDING for a while now. Given the risks of amnesticising the entire globe, including ourselves, we have neglected to determine its viability as an asset. That said, the situation at hand requires extreme measures to overcome. The Ennui Protocol would provide a large-scale, clean and effective pseudo-amnestic effect, with the additional capability to implant false memories, not only removing them entirely. If it doesn't work, we attempted to maintain normalcy as best we could.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nI am calling the poll now. - O5-2\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\nPOLL TO ENACT ENNUI PROTOCOL DIRECTIVE: \n\n| YEA: 6 | NAY: 6 | ABSTAIN: 1 | \nRESULT: Motion failed to pass.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nWith the caveat that the Ennui Protocol is dismantled immediately after use, I will vote YEA.
