  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nIn order to simplify downvoting for common reasons, and to make it feel less personal, I have created:\n\n**SCP Foundation Standardized[[footnote]] This is a joke, not standard, and should not actually be used in the Forums. However, all the reasons listed for downvoting things are 100% real. Do not mail this form to the IRS. Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball. [[/footnote]] Downvote Form 1040-EZ**\n\nI am downvoting your SCP because: (check all that apply)\n\n[ ] You forgot to spellcheck.\n[ ] You forgot to proofread.\n[ ] You did not read, or decided to ignore \"How to Write an SCP.\"\n[ ] You posted an incomplete SCP to the main site.\n[ ] Your formatting is incorrect.\n[ ] You do not know the difference between its/it's; your/you're; there/their/they're.\n[ ] I am not sure if you know how to write in English.\n[ ] There is a severe deficiency in clinical tone.\n[ ] You appear to have accidentally posted an article intended for the Shark Punching Center (SPC).\n[ ] Self-upvotes are bad form; don't do that.\n[ ] If you had posted your idea in the Forum, 20 people would have told you not to write it.\n[ ] If you had posted a draft in your sandbox, 20 people would have told you not to post it on the main site.\n[ ] Your SCP is too much like SCP-__, and is not written well enough to get away with it.\n[ ] Your SCP is a straight rip-off of __. \n[ ] Your SCP is on the Cliche List, and is not written well enough to get away with it.\n[ ] You need to send your D & D monster/artifact/magic item/cursed magic item back to the Forgotten Realms.\n[ ] Rape is just not a good SCP topic/effect.\n[ ] Neither is necrophilia.  Your SCP should keep me up at night, but not because I'm wondering when you'll be arrested.\n[ ] There is no hook.\n[ ] Meh.\n[ ] It just didn't grab me; sorry about that.\n[ ] Your -J isn't funny.\n[ ] Your -J is really just a bad mainlist SCP.\n[ ] Your \"Keter\" SCP is just dangerous, not interesting.\n[ ] The Description area doesn't describe your SCP.\n[ ] If your SCP \"appears to be\" an X, it should not actually be an X.\n[ ] I had to read half of your SCP before I could figure out what it does.\n[ ] I read your entire SCP and still don't even know what it IS.\n[ ] You [REDACTED] part of the containment procedures.\n[ ] You [REDACTED] an entire incident report.  Just because [[[SCP-087]]] did it doesn't mean you should. \n[ ] You [REDACTED] your main effect.  Just because [[[SCP-231]]] did it (more or less) doesn't mean you should.\n[ ] You [REDACTED] the hook.\n[ ] You [REDACTED] other things in a way that is silly.\n[ ] You keep using the word \"memetic.\" I do not think it means what you think it means.\n[ ] Your SCP compels people to use it for no reason.\n[ ] Your SCP is just a __ that kills people.\n[ ] Your SCP is just a __ that makes the user crazy.  Or makes them crazy and then kills them.\n[ ] Your \"real life\" SCP is less interesting than the real thing that it is based on.\n[ ] Your SCP is a lame attempt to explain: [ ] Katrina [ ] Fukushima [ ] Tsunami in Indonesia [ ] (some other real-life disaster)\n[ ] The dialog in the interview log makes all of humanity look like complete morons.\n[ ] The lack of common sense by all characters portrayed makes me want to light fire to my computer.\n[ ] Your SCP enters a \"rage state\" and you were not writing about it visiting New Jersey.\n[ ] The story of how your SCP was found is unbelievable.\n[ ] You included writings translated from an ancient language ...that somehow still rhyme in English.\n[ ] Please remove:\n-- [ ] the incorrectly-edited title\n-- [ ] the boring test log\n-- [ ] the boring supplemental pages\n-- [ ] the non-metric measurements\n-- [ ] the lolFoundation addendum\n-- [ ] the \"Tags\" that you made up yourself\n-- [ ] the Telekill reference\n-- [ ] the crosslink to SCP-173/500/682/914 (circle as appropriate)\n-- [ ] the random/excessive references to Clef/Bright/Gears/Rights/Kondraki/(insert other misused \"canon\" character here)\n-- [ ] the lame joke about sharks and/or bees\n[ ] Your SCP breaks my suspension of disbelief. Specifically, because of:\n-- [ ] Incorrect science\n-- [ ] Technobabble\n-- [ ] Anachronisms\n-- [ ] The combat scene that should have \"Yakety Sax\" playing in the background.\n-- [ ] an Agent finding the SCP: on his doorstep/in a weird little shop/on the beach while vacationing/(insert ridiculous story here).\n-- [ ] Other:\n[ ] Your SCP has a containment area that is:\n-- [ ] a vastly-oversized cube\n-- [ ] 2-dimensional\n-- [ ] 6-dimensional\n-- [ ] made of titanium (or other inappropriate materials).\n-- [ ] excessively specific for no reason\n-- [ ] nonexistent; the SCP is allowed to wander around the site. \n[ ] The containment procedures make no sense, or are completely inappropriate to what the object does.\n[ ] Your SCP is only \"uncontainable\" because you were too lazy to think of something.\n[ ] Your humanoid SCP is:\n— [ ] an \"X-Man\" or super-villain.\n— [ ] just another D & D monster.\n— [ ] a bad self-insert/\"Mary Sue.\"\n— [ ] something really obvious from another medium, in SCP form.  Slenderman, this means you.\n— [ ] using the Foundation like it was a hotel.\n— [ ] getting what it wants because we wouldn't like it when it's angry.\n[ ] Your picture is:\n— [ ] A hand-drawn \"artist's impression\" of your SCP.\n— [ ] 27MB, and hosted off-site.\n— [ ] Something another SCP already uses.\n— [ ] Completely different from what is described in the text.\n— [ ] A movie still, or some other well-known thing.\n— [ ] Watermarked.\n— [ ] Borked.\n— [ ] Obviously computer-generated.\n— [ ] Too photoshopped.\n— [ ] Not photoshopped enough.\n— [ ] Not photoshopped at all, but looks photoshopped.\n\n\n> **Staff Notice: Please note, actual use of this form in discussion threads will not be tolerated.**",
