What is the Foundation? What are SCP objects, and where do they come from? What in the world is an 'HMCL supervisor'? As the fiction has expanded, the mysteries have only gotten more and more complex. Now, for SCP-5000, you shall be posing more. Perhaps you'll solve them as well. That's up to you.\n\n++* Congratulations to Tanhony for taking the SCP-5000 slot, and a sincere thank you to all participants! Seeing the work that you have produced for this contest has been an absolute delight, and both I and the wiki thank you all.\n\n+* Entries by Vote Count at Closing\n\n# [[[scp-5000|SCP-5000: Why?]]]
