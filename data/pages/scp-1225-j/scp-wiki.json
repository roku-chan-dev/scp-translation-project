SCP-1225-J is currently held at Site 25 and is to be held at all times in a block of solid ice in a standard 18m x 18m containment room modified to mimic the temperature conditions of the North Pole.[[footnote]]Between 32°F (0°C) to -40°F (-40°C)[[/footnote]] A containment zone of 20m is to be kept at all time and no personnel may enter this zone except during testing. All monitoring personnel must be equipped at all times with noise cancelling headgear capable of blocking sound between 5 Hz - 50 kHz.\n\nPersonnel are advised that on the night of --November 25-- --November 15-- --November 4-- October 31 SCP-1225-J will attempt to breach containment and escape the facility. To date all attempts at preventing this have failed, as have all attempts at containment during Yule Events.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1225-J is a human female of approximately 55 years of age with light skin and blonde hair wearing a red and white sherpa coat, a matching red sleeping cap with white fur trim and a white puff at the tip, green leggings, and red shoes with curved pointed tips. Genetic testing shows that SCP-1225-J is genetically identical to ██████ █████.[[footnote]]A popular American singer, songwriter, record producer and actress[[/footnote]] When interviewed Ms. █████ has expressed no knowledge of SCP-1225-J, although she reports unusually vivid dreams during the months of November and December.\n\nWhile SCP-1225-J's containment is voluntary during the majority of the year, it will enter an active period lasting --one month-- --a month and a half-- nearly two months out of the year during November and December (active periods hereafter referred to as Yule Events). During a Yule Event SCP-1225-J will breach containment through anomalous means and attempt to locate and travel to high population centers, usually visiting 3-4 locations during each Yule Event. Locations visited include London, England; New York City, NY; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dallas, TX; and ████████, MT. How SCP-1225-J chooses where to visit is currently unknown, although it seems to prefer cities in the Anglosphere. To date SCP-1225-J has not visited any location more than once.\n\nSCP-1225-J is capable of producing a sonic tone in a frequency beyond the range of human hearing.[[footnote]]Human hearing is in a range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz, tone has been measured to be between 30-35 kHz[[/footnote]] Even brief exposure to this tone will induce a number of effects on anyone in proximity to it including\n\n* A change in demeanor described as \"jolly and festive\"\n* A compulsion to sing traditional Christmas songs\n* A compulsion to decorate for the Christmas holiday\n* A general positive shift in mood for the duration of the winter holiday period\n\nEffects last on average 2-3 weeks, however the longest recorded effect lasted until precisely 11:59:59 P.M. local time on December 31. Prolonged or repeated exposure to SCP-1225-J's tone can lead to paranoia, insanity, and, in severe exposure, death. D-class personnel who have been exposed for extended periods have reported auditory hallucinations \"as if someone was singing just around the corner\" and have also reported seeing SCP-1225-J during periods of rapid eye movement or within their peripheral vision. Effects only last as long as subjects are continuously exposed to SCP-1225-J and gradually lessen over time.\n\nWhile in containment a variant of SCP-1225-J's tone can be heard through the ice from up to 20m and has been known to cause migraines, nausea, irritability, and uncharacteristic frivolity in personnel not properly equipped.\n\nSCP-1225-J was discovered after the first known Yule Event in 1994 in the town of ████, Alaska. SCP-1225-J surrendered willingly and allowed itself to be contained under the containment procedures listed above under the condition that it be allowed to leave on a date of its choice[[footnote]]Originally November 25 but SCP-1225-J has requested an earlier date every █ years[[/footnote]] and then willingly recontained on December 26. SCP-1225-J claims that it is spreading the \"holiday spirit to all in this dreary world.\"\n\nOn the morning of December 26 SCP-1225-J will submit to the containment team on standby and willingly be taken into custody. At precisely 00:00 A.M Jan 1[[footnote]]Midnight on New Year's Day[[/footnote]] a solid block of ice approximately 1 meter thick will expand outward from SCP-1225-J and will contain it until the next active Yule Event.\n\n**Addendum:** On November 27, 20██ while SCP-1225-J was in the town of ██████, NE D-2512 was sent in to locate SCP-1225-J and conduct a formal interview. The interview was monitored remotely by Dr. Christopher ███████ who was to feed D-2512 with questions. Dr. ███████'s lines omitted for redundancy. SCP-1225-J was located singing atop a decorated residential home. Interview follows.\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **D-2512:** Hello? Ma'am?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Can you hear it? The joy of the holiday! Are you excited for Christmas?\n> \n> **D-2512:** Uh, yeah, sure. Ma'am, can I ask you some questions?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Please, ask and I'll be happy to answer!\n> \n> **D-2512:** Okay. Um, first question. Who are you? Do you have a name?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** I'm the one to bring the joy of the season to everyone in the world!\n> \n> **D-2512:** Okay. Next question, why are you doing this?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** I'm bringing holiday spirit to all in this dreary world! If even one person is made happier because of me isn't that worth it?\n> \n> **D-2512:** I guess. Um, okay. Why are you doing this now? Why these specific dates?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Because this is the season! I used to only do it for a month, but you all love the holidays so much, you're celebrating them earlier and earlier! I can hardly keep up anymore, but it's important work!\n> \n> **D-2512:** Oh, huh. I never thought about it like that. But isn't that just from companies trying to make money by selling stuff earlier in the year? [[footnote]]D-2512 asked this question unprompted[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** What's so wrong with that? Spreading the holiday cheer in all times is something to be celebrated, I think. You do it earlier and earlier so I will come earlier and earlier as you all wish!\n> \n> **D-2512:** Whatever, Christmas is all [EXPLETIVE DELETED] anyways. Ok. Um, next question then. How do you choose where you go? \n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Oh, that's easy! I go where I'm most needed! This world is so dull, and people are becoming sadder and sadder. I go to where people most need some holiday cheer! And every so often I find some Scrooge and I just have to help them. After all... [singing] All I-\n> \n> **D-2512:** What the...?\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Want for-\n> \n> **D-2512:** No, hold on!\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Christmas-\n> \n> **D-2512:** Stop, please!\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** Is-\n> \n> **D-2512:** PLEASE DEAR GOD NOOOOOO!\n> \n> **SCP-1225-J:** [REDACTED]\n> \n> **D-2512:** [incoherent screaming]\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n\n**Notes:** D-2512 was found two days later in an alley frantically decorating a dumpster with bits of refuse and gibbering about the \"holiday spirit\". D-2512 was brought back to Site 25 and nursed back to health. D-2512 claims to have no knowledge of what occurred, although now expresses a severe case of christougenniatikophilia.[[footnote]] Obsession with Christmas [[/footnote]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1224-J]]] | SCP-1225-J | [[[SCP-1234-J]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
