If courses matching the criteria are located, web crawlers will remove the course and all associated information and quarantine all removed items for study at Site-15. Once quarantined, members of MTF Rho-1 (\"The Professors\") should enroll in SCP-4218-1 through SCP-4218-5, as well as any future courses uncovered, as part of ongoing containment. They should complete each course as offered and prepare a report on its contents for the Site Director. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4218 is a series of five educational web seminars offered by [http://www.scp-wiki.net/alexylva-university-hub ALEXYLVA UNIVERSITY].[[footnote]]Assumed to be an extradimensional institution of higher learning, though access by Foundation personnel is currently impossible.[[/footnote]] Courses were discovered by members of MTF Rho-1 during investigation of ALEXYLVA's website. Special attention was given not only because of a previously unknown relationship with Anderson Robotics, but because the courses appear to be accessible interdimensionally via the world wide web. \n\nEach known seminar, here labeled SCP-4218-1 through -5, appears to be made in conjunction with [http://www.scp-wiki.net/anderson-robotics-hub Anderson's Robotics]. The format generally adheres to the standard of a MOOC[[footnote]]Acronym for \"Massive Open Online Course\", a term describing a program by which students may increase their knowledge of a particular subject through pre-recorded webinars, comprehension tests, and relevant exercises. MOOCs are typically offered by accredited universities for a paid certificate (usually not interchangeable with any kind of degree) or simply for the user's own curiosity. Non-anomalous MOOCs on a number of subjects are offered all over the world.[[/footnote]] or other, similar online course. Topics covered include but are not limited to philosophy, ethics, introductory robotics, anomalous history, and android biology.\n\nA list of known courses is available below:\n\n+++ SCP-4218-1: THE PINOCCHIO QUESTION: HUMANITY'S DEFINITION\n[[collapsible]][[size 0.9em]]{{**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** DOES ARTIFICIALLY CREATED LIFE HAVE THE SAME VALUE AS THAT OF A NATURAL BORN HUMAN?

It is my wish, and the wish of my grand and glorious Friend, Vincent Anderson, that the knowledge which springs from our unlikely but joyous union should benefit the peoples of every world, every dimension. We must urge our fellow scholars to seek masters of history, of art, of state and politics. We must reach out to [[[are-we-cool-yet-hub|those who paint the town red]]], who [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|rule the world with gold and green]]], even those who remained loyal to [[[prometheus-labs-hub|the Lab which stole fire from the gods]]]. Friend Vincent has already planned to launch an inter-curricular program with [[[deer-college-hub|his Alma Mater]]]. \n> \n> There are zero excuses to delay Friend Vincent's plan to unite the world by way of shared information, and we must enact the expansion of our new course catalog with all haste. I will be sending emails to the relevant players in our little game of chess, and hope to see the implementation of my Friend's plans as soon as can be expected. \n> \n> Your ally in the annals of learning, \n> \n> Professor Fulvius Mago\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Project Bifrost\" hide=\"Welcome: ANDERSON, VINCENT\"]]\n+++ SCP-4218-6:  THE FUTURE OF MAN AND THE NOBLE ANDROID\n**Course Description:** God is dead, and Man killed him. Man has remade himself in the image of his Creator and usurped him. If Man can give life, can nurture it, can take it away, what use is God? What better man to lead the new union of Man and machine than He who is the master of both? \n\nBy the end of this eight week course, you will understand why androids are the next stage of human evolution, why Anderson Robotics is the future of the human race, and why only Vincent Anderson is fit to lead it. Students will be charged with a final project demonstrating their understanding of Vincent Anderson's oratorical skills and interdimensional peacekeeping devices to create and secure a better future for the whole of mankind. \n\n**PROFESSOR(S):** Unit #56-99, Unit #56-73, Vincent Anderson\n[[div style=\"font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace\"]]\n**SYLLABUS** \n* **Week 1:** Why the Noble Android is Superior to Organic Life\n* **Week 2:** Why the Noble Android is A Perfect Union\n* **Week 3:** Why Ethics and Morals Need Not Apply to the Noble Android or His Cousin, the Machine\n* **Week 4:** Why Man And the Noble Android Require a Strong Hand to Lead them, and Why He Cannot Lead Himself\n* **Week 5:** Benevolent Dictatorship: Quick, Lasting Freedom\n* **Week 6:** How to Become a Benevolent Dictator, as Led by Anderson\n* **Week 7:** Methodologies of Mechanical Coups and Shadow Governments\n* **Week 8:** Wrap-up, Vincent Anderson's accomplishments and accolades\n[[/div]][[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4217]]] | SCP-4218 | [[[SCP-4219]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Popsioak and TechSorcerer2747]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
