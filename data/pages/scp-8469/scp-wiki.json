As such, priority is placed on response measures as well as concealment. When a Krísis event is detected on Foundation satellites, the nearest agent to the area of the event must be contacted and deployed to reach and awaken the afflicted individual by all means at their disposal.\n\nAt the conclusion of the event, any nearby witnesses are to be provided Class A amnestics, as well as a cover story about the target individual. If the target survives the event, then they should be taken in for questioning, after which they will be provided Class B amnestics and monitored for the forseeable future.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8469 is an anomalous event, henceforth designated as a \"Krísis\" event, that randomly occurs every night between the hours of 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM and affects individuals, hereafter designated as SCP-8469-A, who have commited one or more crimes at any point in their lives. When a Krísis event occurs, an area of around 5,351 square meters surrounding SCP-8469-A will begin to rapidly drop in temperatures until it reaches 0 degrees Celsius. The event occurs only to individuals who have reached the first REM stage of their sleep cycle, and this state, alongside the temperatures, will remain the same until SCP-8469-A is either woken up by an external force, or is judged by SCP-8469-1 and SCP-8469-2.\n\nWhen a Krísis event takes place, individuals have reported awakening in a large, extradimensional space resembling a courtroom. This space changes in appearance with each new SCP-8469-A instance, often bearing characteristics and imagery belonging to the instance's respective country, culture, or society. Despite SCP-8469-A instances reporting complete cognitive and sensory awareness during the event, their physical bodies bear no physical or psychological changes. Across all known instances of Krísis events, the hall will be empty except for the SCP-8469-A instance, as well as the SCP-8469-1 and SCP-8469-2 entities. The space will also possess three large wooden thrones featuring intricate engravings with religous and runic characteristics. Two of the thrones are occupied by SCP-8469-1 and SCP-8469-2 respectively.\n\nUpon manifestation, the entities will begin listing the crimes of SCP 8469-A and deliberate on a \"suitable punishment\" for the instance. When they reach a consensus, the entities will then awaken SCP-8469-A, after which SCP-8469-2 will execute the decided punishment by manifesting in the physical world. While in the past decades, most punishments result in the death of SCP-8469-A, there are instances where the subject does avoid death, albeit with extreme physical or mental trauma[[footnote]]See Addendum 8469-02[[/footnote]]. Punishments inflicted on SCP-8469-A will, in some form, relate to the crimes they committed.\n\nSCP-8469-1, designating itself as the \"Judge\", is described as a 5 meter tall female humanoid wearing a traditional judge's gown and a white mask of unknown material featuring a neutral expression. SCP-8469-A instances detail the anomaly displaying a calm yet stern demeanor, as well as a sense of intimidation and disapproval despite a lack of change in the mask's expression. This entity also wields a gavel which is used to awaken the SCP-8469-A instance at the end of the event. \n\nSCP-8469-2, proclaiming itself as the \"Executioner\", is described as a 5 meter tall female humanoid wearing a dark cloak, whose body is composed entirely of a black mist-like substance. This entity is reported to behave aggressively and violently towards SCP-8469-A, often participating in berating and antagonizing the instances. SCP-8469-2 can manifest in the physical world, and across various encounters[[footnote]]See Addendum 8469-01[[/footnote]], has also demonstrated various offensive and defensive capabilities.\n\nThe most notable of SCP-8469-2's abilities involve the transmission of a deadly cognitohazard through direct contact with the entity, as well as extensive manipulation of its own body structure. When used on SCP-8469-A, the cognitohazard results in the individual experiencing convulsions, followed by an increase in the temperature of the blood until it reaches its boiling point, culminating with the destruction of all internal bodily structures. On other individuals, however, the cognitohazard induces a comatose state with varying times of recovery. \n\nSCP-8469 was discovered on 09/24/1990 following an agent's coincidental presence and follow-up encounter with SCP-8469-2 during a Krísis event in a county jail located in Houston,Texas. Further investigation into the anomaly resulted in the discovery of various historical accounts that seemingly depict SCP-8469-1 and SCP-8469-2 differently across many periods in history[[footnote]]See Addendum 8469-04[[/footnote]]. Analysis of data regarding SCP-8469 has also revealed that the amount of activity displayed by the anomaly has inscreased with time, going from two-week intervals in the late 20th century, to a daily occurrence, with the change ocurring near the start of the 21st century. \n\n**Addendum 8469-01**: Incident 8469-A\n\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+Show Video Log\" hide=\"-Hide Video Log\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Preface:** Following detection of a Krísis event on Foundation satellites taking place at the Nevada Southern Detention Center around 11:00 PM, agents of MTF Mu-13 (Ghostbusters) accompanied by an additional squadron of containment specialists were dispatched from the nearby Site-45 in order to find and contain SCP-8469-2, as well as prevent the Krísis event from achieving completion.

Guards on the nearby towers shine lights onto the squadrons.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Hey Niles, how's the situation?\n\n**I-10 Lead Niles:** Jerson and Quinn have cleared cell blocks C and D. They're moving on to B, but haven't found anything. Take your squad towards cell block A, SCP-8469-A is most probably there.

Mu-13, you are to continue with the objective and set up a perimeter around the -A instance.\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Understood, Wilson, is the instance still stable?\n\n**M-13 Wilson:** Affirmative, the instance remains-Fuck!\n\n//Yelling is heard in across agent Wilson's comm channel. Agent Peterson reaches the second floor.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Wilson? What's going on over there?\n\n**M-13 Wilson:** It's the instance, it just bolted upright for no reason. [unintelligible] \n\n//Agents Peterson and Wilhelm arrive at Agent Wilson's location. Agent Dalton has unloaded and prepared one of the portable shock units.//\n\n**Site Command:** Agent Peterson, report on the instance's status.\n\n//The inmate is huddled in the corner of the cell crying uncontrollably. The murmurs from the other prisoners have now stopped.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** The instance is awake, that means the anomaly should- Oh shit!\n\n//A black mist manifests within the cell and expands outwards, momentarily disorienting the personnel present. Footage distorts momentarily. When the the camera refocuses, the mist has coalesced into a floating, vaguely humanoid form. All agents aim their weapons at the entity. It does not move.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Ramirez, get your squad over here now! \n\n**G-1 Ramirez:** We're on our way.\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Richardson, where are you and Barlowe?\n\n**M-13 Richardson:** We've set up on the walkways above you, opposite to the entity's location.

Distant heavy footsteps are heard echoing through the prison.//\n\n**Site Command:** Agent Peterson, attempt to establish communication with the entity.\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Understood. Hey, you! We're gonna need you to step out of that cell and come with us right now.

I said step out of the cell!\n\n//The entity starts moving towards the SCP-8469-A instance. Its right arm rearranges itself into a bladed weapon.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** Site Command, permission to engage?\n\n**Site Command:** Permission granted.\n\n//All agents begin firing at SCP-8469-2. Every projectile passes through the entity without any noticeable effect. The entity turns to look at the agents and speaks in what was later identified to be a variation of Ancient Mycenaean Greek.//\n \n**SCP-8469-2:** (Mycenaean Greek) Obstructors!\n\n//Agent Dalton throws one of the portable shock units at the entity. The cube-shaped device lands on the ground and sends arcs of electricity towards SCP-8469-2. The arcs launch the entity backwards, disorienting it for a few seconds before it recovers and destroys the device with its bladed appendage.//\n\n//The entity cranes its head and lets out a high pitched screech, after which it phases through the bars of the cell and flies towards the attacking agents. Agents Peterson, Dalton, and Wilhelm manage to duck under the entity, but Agent Wilson is pierced by the appendage and thrown over the railing.//\n\n**M-13 Wilhelm:** Wilson!\n\n//The entity continues on its path upwards towards the other Mu-13 agents. A sudden flash of red light is expelled from the entity's face and the two agents fall to the floor unconscious. SCP-8469-2 looks down at the remaining Mu-13 agents, but is hit by a barrage of bullets from Gamma squad in the lower floors.//\n\n**M-13 Lead Peterson:** M-13 agents down! Niles, get Iota-10 in here now! We need backup.\n\n**G-1 Ramirez:** We have eyes on the entity!\n\n//The remaining Mu-13 members aim their weapons towards SCP-8469-2. Before they can fire, the entity uses its second arm to fire a barrage of projectiles towards the agents. Agent Dalton manages to dodge the attack, but agent Peterson is hit in his chest and neck, while Agent Wilhelm is pinned to the wall by multiple projectiles in his arm. Agent Peterson collapses to the ground near one of the cells and Agent Wilhelm can be heard yelling out of sight.//\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** Fuck! Peterson, are you still with me?\n\n//Agent Dalton checks the body for a pulse.//\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** Shit. Shit! Peterson's dead. \n\n//Agent Wilhelm can be heard violently coughing.//\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** Don't touch that! Let me help you out of there.\n\n//Yelling and gunfire can be heard in the floor below, followed by another flash of red light.//\n\n**G-1 Ramirez:** Johnson, above you!\n\n**I-10 Quinn:** Multiple agents down. I repeat, multiple agents down! Site command, we need medvac now!\n\n**G-1 Ramirez:** They won't get here on time Quinn, gather what's left of our agents and get out of here! I'll slow it down in the meantime.\n\n//The sound of the conflict continues. A blast of fire rises above the walkways followed by a high pitched screech from SCP-8469-2.//\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** Sorry Mark, this is gonna hurt! \n\n//The sudden sound of a blade exiting flesh and a pained scream, then the cell block goes silent. Agent Dalton can be heard trying to remove the projectiles from Agent Wilhelm's arm.//\n\n**M-13 Wilhelm:** Site Command, we have multiple downed agents.\n\n//The sound of flesh tearing and another pained groan, then something clatters onto the ground beside Agent Peterson's body. Agent Wilhelm winces in pain.//\n\n**M-13 Wilhelm:** Peterson's KIA, don't know about the rest of the team though. \n\n**Site Command:** Agents are on their way, just hold on for a little longer. What do you see? Where is the entity?\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** We don't know, its gone quiet, but I think that- no, NO!\n\n//Commotion can be heard, and another object clatters onto the ground.//\n\n**Site Command:** What's happening Mu-13?\n\n**M-13 Wilhelm:** It's -2! It's coming back up!\n\n**Site Command:** Stay calm Agent Wilhelm. Focus on freeing yourself then joining the rest of the agents outside the prison.\n\n//A third object falls and hits the ground.//\n\n**M-13 Wilhelm:** The -A is still alive, we have to get him out too.\n\n**M-13 Dalton:** Are you kidding me, Mark?! There is no way we can get him out alive, we are leaving now!\n\n**Site Command:** The SCP-8469-A instance is lost, leave it and rejoin the other agents, that's an order.\n\n//The sound of another object being thrown is accompanied by multiple gunshots. The shock unit lands on the ground beside agent Peterson's body, it has been pierced by a long and sharp projectile. More gunshots, then the sound of flesh being pierced and multiple heavy thumps against the metal walkway.//\n\n//Nothing happens for thirty seconds until a steady stream of red light begins to emanate from SCP-8469-A's cell.

I mean, if you were trying to quit the Foundation, then there were many easier ways to do so.\n> \n> **Dr. Coling:** I was doing the right thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Santiago:** I bet the people you stabbed beg to differ.\n> \n> <Dr. Colin slams his fists on the table.>\n> \n> **Dr. Colin:** (Agitated) Well at least they are alive to disagree with me! Can't say shit for that man Alvarez just murdered.\n> \n> **Dr. Santiago:** Your actions could've resulted in everyone in that room being killed, and you think that is doing the right thing?\n> \n> **Dr.  Colin:** Oh, enough with the bullshit Anthony. I may be a junior researcher, but we //both// read the anomaly's file, so you know as well as I do that going into that chamber and waking up that man would have //only// resulted in one life saved. \n> \n> **Dr. Santiago:** You don't know that. We have yet to fully grasp the true extent of what this anomaly is capable of. Which is why the tests are being done in the first place.\n> \n> **Dr. Colin:** Please, all that useless data did was prove facts that were already proven one hundred times before. Alvarez just wanted to let that man die.\n> \n> **Dr. Santiago:** He was a D-class, it's //their// job to help us understand anomalies by putting themselves on the line. If he had to die to help us get one step closer to containing this anomaly, then so be it. Besides, you //do// know the reason they become D-class in the first place?\n> \n> **Dr. Colin:** I don't give a damn about what he did, he already faced his judgement. But us? We could've stopped that man from dying in the first place, but you all let him die! You think they won't condemn that?\n> \n> **Dr. Santiago:** Pardon, they?\n> \n> **Dr. Colin:** Yes, //they//. They condemned that man to death for what he did, and now, they'll condemn everyone in that room for letting him face death in the first place. \n>   \n> **<End Log, 7:30:45>**\n> \n> **Closing statement:** Following a thorough mental evaluation, Dr. Colin was found to have been under the effects of long-term sleep deprivation, resulting in mood swings, unstable behavior, and rash decision making. Based on these findings, Dr. Colin was removed from the SCP-8469 project and provided Class C amnestics, as well as a two month suspension period.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** alvarez@scp.int\n**From:** marshall@scp.int\n**Subject:** Status update\n[[/div]]\n------\nHello Marcus, I was notified about what happened, are you doing well?

There must've been something wrong with the medicine. I knew I shouldn't have taken it, I should've just fought through the pain. That wouldn't explain the hand though… I probably sound crazy, if I'm not already. I just have to write this down, get it out of my chest, otherwise I think I'll go mad.\n> \n> Last night something odd happened. I remember stashing away my most recent haul between the floorboards before I headed off to bed, but then waking up a few minutes later for no reason. I wasn't in the house anymore, instead, I was in a courtroom like the one I'd been in a couple of years ago. There were also three giant wooden thrones, and three giant women sitting on each of them. One was small, with long hair that resembled a starry night sky, and a glittering white dress, another, in the middle, looked oddly like the judge from the trial in 39', except for the mask and gender of course. The last one, on the left, well she'd be right at home on All Hallows Eve. She was basically a ghost made of black smoke, wore a grim reaper cloak and everything!\n> \n> After I noticed them on the thrones, the one in the middle spoke to me, saying I was in \"The Hall of Penance\", then spitting a whole spiel about \"guilty\" and \"justice for commited crimes\" or whatever. I asked the women who they were, but all they told me was that they were the \"Judge\", \"Jury\", and \"Executioner\". Great, as if human judges weren't enough of a pain already. I tried telling them that the only reason I stole these days was survival. It's not my fault no one wants to hire me, and it certainly isn't my fault that stealing is the only way to feed myself these days, but they didn't even listen!\n> \n> I guess I didn't really realize how screwed I was until the spooky one began suggesting my arms be cut off. Naturally, I panicked and argued against the punishment, but apparently my pleas mean bollocks to her since I'm just \"lowly scum\". While I continued to argue with dark and gloomy, I also caught a glimpse of the smallest one. I don't know if it was just me, but I thought I saw her try to speak to the cloaked one a few times, but was constantly drowned out by our yelling. She was very small compared to the other two, and despite her pristine looks, she looked extremely sad and abandoned. I swear, no one I've seen my whole life has looked as sad as that woman, and it's not like things are any pretty back home either.\n> \n> Eventually, the woman in the judge's clothing brought down her gavel and told us to quiet down. Of course, I did what I was told, all the while the three of 'em began to whisper amongst themselves. They spoke in a language I've never heard before, so I can't tell what exactly they were talking about, probably me, though the little one didn't say anything. Despite this, they eventually ended their gossip and announced that I would be returned home a free man, but that I would also be branded so everyone knew what I did. Before I could argue again, the judge brought down the gavel and I woke up on my mattress back home.\n> \n> At first, I thought it was a nightmare, but then I noticed the room was cold, //really// cold. Before I could even question it though, the one in the black cloak appeared out of nowhere and pinned me to the ground. I tried to fight back but my kicks and flails went through the damn thing. The worst part though, was when a third arm grew out of the ghost's side and slowly carved some weird words into my forearms. It felt like my arms were being burned to the bone, hell, I still feel the pain now. By the end of the torture I could barely move, and that ghastly woman was nowhere to be seen. I don't know when, but at some point I must have passed out too. I still don't know what that thing was, and I don't care to, I just know that if I don't want to see it again I'll have to fix up my life. Maybe this is the push I need to get my mechanic shop up and running again, a sign from God or whatever. If what's now on my arm //is// a \"brand\" though, then it's a really shite one, I can't even understand what it says: κακοῦργος.\n\n**Notes:** The entry presented above was part of a longer diary belonging to a man named Mordecai Schmidt, whose journal was found by his grandson, Researcher Thomas Schmidt. Following the mention of a possible third entity, henceforth dubbed SCP-8469-3, efforts to find more historical documents mentioning the anomalies began, resulting in the discoveries of most of the documents seen below.

The expedition has been going well over here, though I must admit, the foreign terrain is quite dangerous, and many of us worry for our safety against the unknown. How is your family? Last time I saw little Alberto he was barely two, yet had so much energy within him, and Maria, how has her bakery been? Oh how I miss the delicacies prepared by her, I wish I had taken some here. Sorry for my tangent, I know I am doing God's work in this savage land, but sometimes I just can't help but reminisce on what I no longer have over here. \n> \n> Regardless, what I am going to say next might seem odd, but I wanted to ask if you could talk one of your friends in the church into coming over here on the next ship. We could use the help of a priest, something happened a few days ago. One of the slaves who could translate the language spoken here to our members furiously attacked and mangled one of our men. While not killed due to his use as a translator, the slave was punished severely. However, that night, me and a few nearby men awoke to horrible screams. When we looked for who was screaming so loudly, we found the slave in the same place he'd been left, however, someone, or something, had taken both of his hands. He did not bleed, but he continued to scream like he was being gutted alive. \n> \n> It was only once he calmed down that we were able to get any information out of him. When our commander asked what had taken his arms, the response he gave was frightening. The slave spoke to us how, in his dreams, his \"gods\" had visited him, and judged him for his attack and near murder of the soldier. He said how the spotted one condemned him, despite the protests that our men were torturers of his people. In contrast, the feathered serpent offered clemency towards him due to his position as a slave. The serpent compared his actions to ones taken previously by the spotted one, who grew frustrated with the serpent. While these two \"gods\" argued over the slave's judgement, the one in the middle, the shining sun, listened to both of them speak, and silenced them before making his decision. The shining sun said that the slave should be punished, but not as severely as the spotted one wished, so he decreed that his hands, instrumental in his attack, would be taken as a fitting sacrifice instead. \n> \n> By the end of the slave's story, most of us were but frightened children. In contrast, our commander and some of the others decree his story false, but those of us who heard it still can't help but feel a looming sense of dread in our once safe camp. If his story is true, then it is not only beasts who roam this new land, but demons as well. Please, my friend, if this letter reaches you, heed my call for aid, for when faced with the spawn of Satan, threats like these should never be taken lightly.\n\n**Note:** This letter written by a conquistador soldier during the 16th century was found in the possession of a museum in Mexico City, which detailed the history of the country with a particular focus on the impacts and consequences of the presence of European invaders.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Chronicle Excerpt and Artistic Depiction]]\n\n> = Phillip the Brave\n------\n> The Great Crusade was a tumultuous time full of uncertainty. In the quest to conquer those who opposed our Lord, many died in a brave sacrifice to our cause. Amongst the bravest of these souls was the great Phillip Lowall, a courageous general who lead the holy forces of our kingdom to a great many victories and conquests. He was one of the greatest soldiers who ever graced this world, but alas, even after he successfully led the siege on Nicaea, he would perish shortly afterward in a plague of madness.\n> \n> The first sign of this plague came in the form of a vision Phillip recieved days prior to the end of the siege. According to his account, he was visited in his sleep by three powerful figures. The first was a being of pure light bearing the shape of a woman, a flame hovering above her head. The second was a beautiful angel bearing wings like that of doves, clothed in fine silk, and bearing the many eyes of the lord spiraling in unison around her figure. The last figure to visit Phillip was the root of his future madness, it was a red skinned she-demon, clothed in robes as black as night, with bat-like wings of the same color, and horns like that of rams protruding from its head.\n> \n> For the first time since the war had begun, Phillip felt truly afraid. While the being of light congratulated him for his loyalty and service, the she-demon despised him, and condemned Phillip for the deaths of the many heretics and sinners that resulted in the war. Even though Phillip was frightened by the power of these beings, his unwavering bravery shone through, and he courageously challenged the she-demon and her claims. Of course a demon such as herself would allow those who reject our Lord to prosper, for spreading sin is the nature of her being!\n> \n> The she-demon was furious, and continued to spread lies about great Phillip's honor, much to his offense and disbelief. The two holy figures listened, and the kind angel argued back and forth for Phillip's fate, all while Phillip listened and despaired at his current situation.\n> \n> Following a long and arduous discussion, the being of light adressed the ailing soldier, stating that for his crimes, he would be plagued by a madness like no other, doomed to feel the pain and anguish of the heretics he'd killed. Despite the injustice of it all, this plague would soon afflict the honorable Phillip, greatly crippling him and inflicting inmense pain.\n> \n> Phillip's fellow comrades would weep for him, but he refused to let this plague stop him. Despite the knowledge that his days were coming to an end, Phillip fought through his curse and arduously led his army in the final days of the siege, securing a complete victory for the Church and our Lord's kingdom. Phillip would perish in this attack, but his great deeds, as well as his bravery, comradery, and courage in the face of heretics and demons alike, will never be forgotten.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Carl_Rahl_-_Orestes_Pursued_by_the_Furies_%281852%29.jpg\n|caption=Artistic depiction of an early instance of a Krísis event\n|align=center\n|width=50%]]\n\n**Note:** The previous document is an excerpt of a longer chronicle dating back to the 11th and 12th century A.D.

Despite their attempts to reach the residence before the event could end, their efforts were impeded by a severe tropical storm that had been taking place at the time. When the agents were able to reach the location, researcher Birkin was nowhere to be found. \n> \n> Twenty minutes after the Krísis event was first recorded, researcher Birkin was found to have suddenly appeared in a vacuum quarantine chamber in Foundation Site-45, wearing an oxygen mask with two air tanks connected via tubes.

Anything that could reveal targeting by the anomaly?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Not really, the day was the same like any other, even during the time window where Krísis events are known to begin occurring, I didn't feel anything unusual.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Alright, how would you describe then, the process of your manifestation in the Hall?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** The process felt sudden, even though I couldn't tell how much time had passed since I fell asleep. Manifesting in the courtroom felt like I was being physically pulled out of unconsciousness and into my body. All of my senses rushed back to me at once, and for a few seconds I experienced a bout of dizziness and confusion.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** And were any of the anomalies present at that moment?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** No, the thrones were empty, so I was able to get a good look at them. Although I wasn't able to identify all of the carvings, most of them looked Greek, with a few more that looked Norse, Egyptian, Aztec, as well as other ancient cultures. They were mostly religous, showing creatures, gods, events, and things like that. \n> \n> //He groans while clutching his midsection.//\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** A few seconds after looking at the thrones, the doors to the courtroom swung open and soon after immediately closed, making me look back. When I turned around, the two anomalies were sitting on their thrones. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Following this, how did the interactions with the anomalies proceed?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Well, it wasn't that great. SCP-8469-1 was cordial enough, she greeted me professionally and remained with a more or less neutral attitude throughout most of the event, albeit showing some disdain towards me in more than one occasion. SCP-8469-2 however, was nothing other than hateful, demeaning, and spiteful, as you probably know. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** What happened after this?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** After -1 addressed me, it proceeded to name the reason I was being \"prosecuted\". The anomalies accused me of murder and abuse of power across my career working for the Foundation, namely, using my time working with SCP-009[[footnote]]Records show Dr. Birkin leaving the SCP-009 project roughly two decades prior to their encounter with the SCP-8469 entities[[/footnote]] as proof.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I didn't know you worked on 009, why did you never tell me?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** You never asked, and when it comes to the jobs I've taken while in the Foundation, actively killing people by turning their blood into ice isn't something I'm proud of. Wouldn't you want to avoid that topic in a conversation if //you// were the one who had to carry out the experiments?\n>  \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I guess so.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Of course... But in regards to the 009 case, I was in charge of making the decisions on what tests on the anomaly would be approved, denied, or carried out. I was also the one who approved and used D-class personnel in the experiments taking place.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** So, I'm guessing the deaths of the D-class are the reason why they condemn you?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Yup. I tried to justify the decision, saying that it was for the benefit of finding a cure, seeing how the anomaly works, etc. SCP-8469-2 didn't feel this way though, it said that we had already found information on the anomaly's abilities, and even if we needed more information on how it functioned, D-class personnel weren't necessary, at least, not as many as we used. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** It was defending the D-class personnel? Not that I'm judging, but from what I've seen these past few years, -2 would love killing the Ds itself, why is it defending them now?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Yeah, quite hypocritical isn't it? From what I could gather though, it wasn't \"defending\" them necessarily, it simply found the loss of life unnecessary, since there were other methods of testing 009's abilities.\n> \n> //Dr. Birkin begins having a severe coughing fit. After a few seconds, he regains composure.//\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Anyway, in that same \"conversation\" I also tried telling it how, even if I killed D-class on purpose, it wouldn't be any different from what they did on a daily basis. It refused to answer any more of my questions after that, although they did call our species incapable of fair judgement and \"easily corruptible\".\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Why do they get to judge us then? \n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** No clue, based on the fact they refer to our species separately from themselves, I guess their reasoning is that since they aren't human, they can judge us all they want. \n> \n> //He grimaces as he scratches and tears away some of the crystals that had grown across his left forearm.// \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Did you mention the third entity?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Tried to, when I did, the entire room went silent. Even SCP-8469-2 went as quiet as a corpse, which was a nice change of pace. However, as quickly as it occurred, everything went back to \"normal\", and the entities carried on talking to each other about my punishment.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** So no leads on that?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Nope, as far as you, me, or anyone else knows, the entity could be missing, or worse, dead. After that debacle, -1 told me I was sentenced to experience the same fate I had dealt to those D-class ages ago. -2 transported me to where we'd found 009, grabbed one of the icicles made out of the anomaly, and stabbed me with it, then took me here, presumably to contain 009 spread. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** At least it was nice enough to do that. What do you think they'll do in the future?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Honestly, I don't know (he winces in pain and grasps his chest). The only thing I can say though, is that they won't stop until they punish all \"guilty\" people, whatever their definition of it entails. Regardless, if we want to make things better, we need to find the third one.\n> \n> //He proceeds to cough up small shards of red ice, which land on the floor in front of him.//\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Didn't you just say it could be dead? How are we supposed to find it if we don't even kow what happened to it.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** I know what I said, but if we want to make some real change, we need -3 to come back in order to keep -2 in check. We don't know if it's dead or not, so until we can prove one or the other, it never hurts to have a little hope. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I'll look into the matter, maybe we can find a way to search for the entity if the O5s approve it.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Good.\n> \n> //Another violent fit of coughs erupt from his mouth, spilling more shards and blood onto the floor.//\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** (in a raspy voice) Marcus, before I... go, can you promise me something?\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** What do you need?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Can you please ensure my family is taken care of? After I'm dead.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I promise. Whatever happens, I'll do my best to ensure they are safe and sound.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** I... I also need you to make sure that Damien never comes anywhere near the Foundation. My boy... he's smart, too smart for his age, and I could never be more proud of him. He just graduated from university, top of his class, and I know he'll only get smarter from here on out, and it scares me Marcus. As a father, it's scary enough letting him go, but knowing that I won't be there for him, and knowing the type of people the Foundation look to recruit, I'm terrified. I need you to promise me that the Foundation will never, //never//, employ Damien.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Harold, you know I can't promise that, I don't have a say in those decisions.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Please Marcus, you know the type of shit that we go through here. Look at me! Look at the hundreds of bodies that we have to bury or incinerate on a daily basis! If Damien joins the Foundation, I'll never be able to forgive myself. Please, at least promise me you'll try.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** (sighing) Alright Harold, I'll try.  \n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** Thank you old friend. \n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** ...Do you have any regrets Harold?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** More than you can know. My biggest? That I'll never get to see Melody grow up, and that I won't be able to keep my promise to Nicole.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** (Light chuckle) Which of the many?\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** (Chuckles) The one about retiring to a log cabin in the woods together.\n> \n> //Dr. Brikin. grimaces slightly as more crystals begin forming across his skin. He covers his eyes and wipes away tears that have begun forming on them.//\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I'm going to miss you Harold. I'll try to keep my promise, for you.\n> \n> **Dr. Birkin:** I'll miss you too Marcus, thank you for being my friend.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing statement:** Following the conclusion of this interview, Dr. Birkin expired 2 hours after initial exposure to SCP-009, and all traces of the anomaly were able to be successfully recovered and moved to storage. Due to the presence of SCP-009 in Dr. Birkin's body, his remains had to be chemically desiccated as per protocol when handling infected organisms. A cover story was promptly given to his family about his death resulting from a chemical accident in a laboratory, and funerary rites were coordinated and held accordingly.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** alvarez@scp.int\n**From:** marshall@scp.int\n**Subject:** Urgent\n[[/div]]\n------\nMarcus, have you heard back from any of the memeticists?

The doors to the office open and Dr. Alvarez walks in. He bears symptoms of severe sleep deprivation, constantly looking around the room and slowly swaying his body as he stands.>\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** H-Hey Elliot, when's your meeting with the council?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** In a couple of hours, I've told you this before. Are you okay Marcus?\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** No, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that whatever your project is, it'll help stop this anomaly soon. Speaking of, what's the project about?\n> \n> <Dr. Marshall looks uneasy. He looks from the papers on his desk to Dr. Alvarez.>\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** Marcus, I think you should go.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** You look like you haven't slept in weeks. You are not okay. I think you should take a break.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** You are right about one thing, I haven't been sleeping a whole lot, but trust me, I'm okay. You got me onto this anomaly for a reason, and I'm going to help whatever way I can. Besides, once we get this anomaly under control, I'll be able to sleep soundly again.\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** You can help by getting some sleep. In this state of mind you won't be helping anyone. So please just go home and rest..\n> \n> <Dr. Alvarez begins to get agitated.>\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** I can't rest Elliot! Not when those things could come at any moment and kill me in my sleep!\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** ...\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** (Sighs) Sorry. Just... for my peace of mind. What did you find? How is this project going to help us?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** Mass amnesticization of personnel. Following that, all information will be classified to a higher clearance and efforts will be made to research and possibly find more data on SCP-8469-3.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** What?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** I will also ask for more personnel to be embedded in law enforcement and judicial systems in order to maintain control on the overall criminal population.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Are you kidding me Marshall? \n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** That's the best we can do right now. I'm sorry.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Sorry? Sorry?! Are you insane? Do you seriously think the best way to deal with this shit is to make everyone forget?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** Yes, and you should too. Just look at yourself! If everyone else in the Foundation learns about the anomaly, just imagine what could happen.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** Stop treating this like it's some kind of fucking disease, and start actually working towards capturing the entities responsible for this in the first place!\n> \n> <Dr. Alvarez begins to get agitated. He paces around the room eratically.>\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** It may not be a disease, but if you or any other of our researchers stopped acting like children, you would realize that it must be treated as such.\n> \n> **Dr. Alvarez:** What?! So you think wanting to stop these killer entities is acting like children?\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** No, but being unable to face the consequences of your actions with dignity //is//.\n> \n> <Dr. Alvarez stops moving. He stares at Dr. Marshall with an expression of anger.>\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** Do you think I'm ignorant to why everyone has been acting the way they are? It's because they can't handle facing the consequences of this job. It's easy when you have to send a criminal into the jaws of a monster and just record what happens, but not so much when the monster turns its eyes to you. It's only now that they realize how much danger that monster truly poses to them.\n> \n> <Dr. Alvarez begins trembling.>\n> \n> **Dr. Marshall:** I know being part of this organization isn't a walk in the park.

Following this, the secondary purpose of Project Justitia will be the mitigation and alleviation of SCP-8469's Krísis events through the control and management of law enforcement and judicial systems, as well as the continued search for SCP-8469-3.\n-----\n**Methodology:** The first phase of Project Justitia will consist of increasing the security clearance required to access the article to Level 5. Any personnel who will be working on the anomaly after Project Justitia's enactment will be hand selected by Dr. Elliot Marshall and the O5 Council following a thorough vetting process and investigation into their work ethic, past, and loyalty to the goals of the Foundation.\n\nThrough detailed analysis of Foundation systems, all personnel who are found to have accessed SCP-8469's file or possess knowledge about the anomaly without having Level 5 clearance, or being granted level 8469/5 clearance, are to be provided Class C amnestics before being returned to active duty. Following this, the next phase of Project Justitia is to be enacted, wherein specifically chosen agents and personnel are embedded in law enforcement agencies, governments, and judicial systems across the world. \n\nWhile no direct correlation has been found between the activity of SCP-8469 and the rising crime rates, it can be deduced that by promoting and enforcing laws that result in less criminal activity, as well as ensuring that the judicial process is carried out equally for all parties, activity of SCP-8469 should be diminished greatly. Having agents in these systems would also provide greater control over the existing criminal population, making finding SCP-8469-A's significantly easier. This phase of the project is to be maintained indefinitely.\n\nThe final phase of the project will consist of the continued search and recovery of SCP-8469-3. Due to the \"human alligned\" interest demonstrated by the entity in historical data, finding and possibly recovering SCP-8469-3 will be considered a top priority moving forward. The enlistment of several Foundation thaumaturgists, as well as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#omicron-rho | MTF Omicron Rho (The Dream Team)]]], is recommended in order to find possible anomalous means of finding, recovering, or \"resurrecting\" SCP-8469-3.\n\nDue to his recent actions, as well as past demonstrations of mental instability and unproffesionalism, the removal of Dr. Marcus Alvarez from the project once he recovers from the detrimental effects of severe sleep deprivation, malnutrition, and mental strain, is strongly recommended.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**O5 Council Vote Tally:**\n\n||Yea||Nay||Abs.||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||  ||X||  ||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||  ||  ||X||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||  ||  ||X||\n||  ||  ||X||\n||X||  ||  ||\n||  ||X||  ||\n\n**Result:** Project Approved.

Until then, the rest of the project objectives are to be executed as delineated in the proposal, with all results and information being provided directly to the O5 Council.

Following this, they will be evaluated, and either amnesticized and transferred to another anomaly, or given a two week relieve from the project. No exceptions are to be made regarding personnel. Due to the possibility of Foundation destabilization, if any personnel are found attempting to leak or spread information regarding the anomaly without authorization of the O5 Council, then they are to be terminated and thoroughly discredited. ##  \n\nDue to SCP-8469-1 and SCP-8469-2's elusive nature as well as their residency outside of the physical plane, containment is currently unfeasable. As such, priority is placed on response measures as well as concealment. When a Krísis event is detected on Foundation satellites, the nearest agent to the area of the event must be contacted and deployed to reach and awaken the afflicted individual by all means at their disposal.\n\nAt the conclusion of the event, any nearby witnesses are to be provided Class A amnestics, as well as a cover story about the target individual. If the target survives the event, then they should be taken in for questioning, after which they will be provided Class B amnestics and monitored for the forseeable future.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#F2F2C0 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px;box-shadow: 5px 4px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); \"]]\n[[=]]\nNotice: There has been **one(1)** recent update to this document.

If you weren't on their hit list before, which I highly doubt due to your high position within the Foundation, you definitely are now by virtue of being in charge of this project. I wish there was more I could say that might help you, but there really isn't. SCP-8469 is the executioner waiting for you in the gallows, ready to knock off your head for all the shit you've had to do in the name of this organization and the \"greater good\". There is no negotiating, and unless someone on the outside finds you on time, there is no escape. \n> \n> But what if it didn't need to be this way? Maybe, if all the crime in the world suddenly stopped, if every problem were fixed just like that, and everyone could be halfway decent human beings to one another for ONCE in their goddamned lives, we wouldn't need to worry about this anomaly long enough to find a fucking solution! But that's not a world we live in. Maybe... maybe we deserve this. I mean, if the anomalies are as old as we think they are, they've seen it all. Everything horrible thing humanity's ever done, they've been there to witness it. Even -3, our one saving grace, is gone now... No clue as to where they are and how to find them. Could be dead as far as we know. But even if they aren't dead, but rather abandoned us, should continue fighting them anymore?

As for me, I'm most likely a few Krísis events away from seeing Elliot again... My comeuppance is already on its way, and despite knowing this, I still can't help but try to do something about it. If not for me, then for all the others that will outlive me. Heh.

Learn from Elliot's mistakes, and my own. Listen to your own regrets and embrace them; become better than you believe yourself to be. Elliot was right about a lot of things, but there was one thing he was wrong about. You will have to do terrible things if you continue down this path, but that doesn't mean you have to become a monster. No matter what the entities say, we fight for a reason. You see that reason every day, in every friend, every birth, every funeral, and hell, even in the anomalies we help contain. They are our reason, and as long as you remember that reason, why we do what we do, strive to not only do whatever it takes to protect them, but to also be better for them. Maybe humanity and the Foundation are as shitty and corrupt as -2 says, but we //can// be better. We //will// find 8469-3, and we //will// set things right.\n> \n> Keep fighting the good fight.
