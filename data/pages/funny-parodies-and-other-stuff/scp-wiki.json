Credentials have held up under scrutiny (for now). Coworkers describe him as \"clumsy\", but gifted in memorization and an overall dedicated researcher. Attitude appeared laid-back and lighthearted during questioning, seemingly willing to laugh at anything. No major oddities found, but recommending further investigation.\n\n[[span style=\"font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold;\"]][[collapsible show=\"+ Open Attachment\" hide=\"- Hide Attachment\"]][[/span]]\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\nThe information you've shown us is troubling. The Hand members we've interrogated have talked about a figure in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wanderers-library-hub library] with some odd similarities to our Researcher. While I can't give you any conclusive proof, I can't deny you've brought me an interesting lead. We'll start investigating Lucian, along with this //[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/sentient-leaves-and-other-stuff Testu-Yuteskon]//, and see if that smug smile of his really is an alien mask.\n\nAnd yes, I encrypted this.
