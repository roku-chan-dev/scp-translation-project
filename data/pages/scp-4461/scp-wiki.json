This location is not to be listed in any Foundation records or disclosed to any Foundation employee except this object's HMCL[[footnote]]Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison[[/footnote]]. The database version of this containment file is not to includ[[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]fffffffffffffffff\n\nok so, at some point a bunch of stuff got deleted, but I didn't do it, I promise\n\ni am a janitor, i don't usually work with files. so i'm really sorry if this is in the wrong format or something, but I'm going to do my best. therer a lot of options on this screen and I am afraid of clicking the wrong one and messing everything up. so please stay with me, ok[[/span]]\n\n The box is to be obviously marked as Foundation Property, with prominent instructions that if found, it should not be opened, but instead be delivered to the next person on Foundation Personnel List 8288-A (See //Addendum 1//). A physical copy of this containment file is to be printed on acid-free paper and the attached files downloaded onto non-volatile removable media. A copy is to be placed with SCP-4461 in the event the HMCL is unable to find a replacement before becoming incapacitated, or meets an unexpected death.\n\n[[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]test test, can i add stuff? [http://www.scp-wiki.net/nash-pinkle-s-guide-to-the-foundation Nash Pinkle] woz here\n\noh shit how do i delete tat[[/span]]\n\nIn the event that the HMCL discovers any other Foundation employee (up to and including O5 personnel) is attempting to investigate SCP-4461, they are to immediately initiate the containment protocol listed in //Addendum 3//.\n[[include component:image-block name=Leather_ball_MET_19.3.10-Elnaggar.jpg|caption=SCP-4461 before containment.|width=250px]]\n**Description:** SCP-4461 is a round sphere of leather, 73mm in diameter, stitched from two pieces of fitting leather scraps secured into a spherical pouch with twine. testing confirms it is filled with sand of unknown origin. Attempts to open the object for further testing do not work. [[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]it looks kinda like an acient baseball. [[/span]]\n\nSCP-4461 is an infohazard. When a person in a position of leadership becomes aware of SCP-4461, they immediately become an instance of SCP-4461-A. In a matter of time ranging from several weeks to several months, the organizational structure below SCP-4461-A suffers increased inefficiency, failure, and catastrophe that grows in severity. [[footnote]]Attempts to trick the object through shell corporations, organizational silos, and other business structures do not appear to work. [[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]the ball knows whos boss. fuckin wanker[[/span]][[/footnote]]\n\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Loss of efficiency\n* Policy violations\n* Sickness\n* Increased turnover rate\n* Accidents\n* Sudden death\n\nUltimately, the organizational structure reporting to SCP-4461-A will crumble. Further hierarchies under SCP-4461-A's command will also fail; notably, SCP-4461-A will not suffer these effects themselves (unless those above them in their organizational hierarchy are also affected). \n\n[[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]other things have been tried sometimes, but didn't work. but ya know, you can't really test it without people finding out, and then everything is fucked, rite\n\niffn im being honest i dont want to do this. so it was oh like two years or so ago I was workin janitor for site 52 outside manchester (COME ON U REDS), i get told 'pack yer shit up, Nash, yer goin to france.' so I get an address and a plane ticket, my flat gets sold overnight and i'm off to fuckkken france. i dont SPEAK FRENCH[[/span]]\n\nThis effect can only be stopped by SCP-4461-A's death. Uses of amnestics on affected subjects do not slow or inhibit the effects of SCP-4461.\n\n[[span style=\"color:#02861C; background-color: #FBFBEF;\"]]so i find out im the new trainee under this old guy. dean. wasn't much training. an i was SHIT at the job, right? thought I was gonna get fired, kept fuckin things up. and then one day he told me about this 4461. and told me i'd been promoted to HMCL. an i asked him what it meant and he gave me this usb sitck, told me to read the file. then he wished me good luck an was gone. never saw im again.[[/span]]\n\n**Addenda**\n[[Collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 1.A: Foundation Personnel List 8288-A\" hide=\"- Addendum 1.A: Foundation Personnel List 8288-A\"]]\n\nFPL-8288-A is a list of 50 Class-0 Clearance Foundation Personnel who have the lowest scores on the Ranser-G Ambition Scale and no subordinates.
