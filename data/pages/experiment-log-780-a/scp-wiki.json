Each fruit contains a copy of SCP-780, indicating that these fruits would normally contain seeds on their interior.\n\n**Experiment 780-e8**\n**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of a bush which produces health bars which contain a week's worth of calories and nutrients in every bite\n**Result**: Resulting bush shares physical appearance with description, with the \"bars\" again being fruits containing copies of SCP-780. Tests verify that these are fairly nutritious, with a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, but only contain slightly more sustenance than an ordinary fruit or vegetable. Further research on exploiting SCP-780 to provide variety in the Site ██  canteen on hold pending approval.\n\n//If we can make fruits as healthy as Brussels sprouts but as tasty as strawberries, imagine the marketing possibilities...we just need to find a way to remove the copy of SCP-780 embedded at the heart of each fruit.//\n//- Dr. █████████//\n\n**Experiment 780-e9**\n**Host Plant**: A one-paragraph description of [DATA EXPUNGED]\n**Result**: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Experiment 780-e10**\n**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-038]]]\n**Result**: Resulting plant appeared identical to SCP-038, but lacked its ability to reproduce items touched to its trunk.\n\n**Experiment 780-e11**\n**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-143]]]\n**Result**: Resulting tree identical in appearance with SCP-143. Bark has the same hardness as SCP-143, but pieces removed from SCP-780-1 lose this property and retain only the hardness typical of a //Prunus// x //yedoensis// tree. Petals have no unusual properties.\n\n**Experiment 780-e12**\n**Host Plant**: [[[SCP-417]]]\n**Result**: While exhibiting the outward appearance of SCP-417, fruit only contain more copies of SCP-780\n\n//Further testing on plant-like SCP objects is suspended, as their unique abilities do not appear to be reproduced.//\n//- Dr. █████████//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
