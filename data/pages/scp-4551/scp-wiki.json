[[/footnote]]. A commercially produced bell muffler is to be placed into the interior of SCP-4551 when not in testing. \n\n\n**Containment Update:** In order to control rust build-up, SCP-4551 is to be cleaned with a 20% electrolytic solution of white vinegar mixed with salt, once per day and re-cleaned after testing. This process is to be performed inside SCP-4551's anechoic chamber.\n\nFurthermore, in order to prevent severe oxidation to occur on SCP-4551's surface, renaissance oil is to be doused daily. This oil is to be blessed by a member or decendent of Roseafar.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4551 is an ornate iron funeral bell, constructed during the late 1300s in Roseafar, Scotland. When SCP-4551 is rung, it produces a clear note in E♭3, which causes an illusion (SCP-4551-1) to appear to the ringer for a period of up to ten minutes. [[footnote]] See the decibel rating table for more information. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-4551-1 illusions appear to be incorporeal, partially-translucent figures with a physical appearance identical to a deceased individual whom the ringer had an interpersonal relationship with. \n\nThe following has been observed during interactions between a ringer and an SCP-4551-1 illusion:\n\n* The ringer maintains that the SCP-4551-1 illusion is the 'soul' of a deceased individual.\n\n* Ringers report that the SCP-4551-1 illusions converse about past memories shared between the ringer and SCP-4551-1. \n\n* SCP-4551-1 illusions engage in endearing behavior such as giving compliments and easing doubts when emotionally 'close' to the ringer, and engage in negative[[footnote]] Hostile, distant and inpersonal behavior. [[/footnote]] behavior when 'distant' to the ringer.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name= 1151px-Hammersmith_Ghost.png |\n    caption=An engraving of an SCP-4551-1 illusion, also from //Prayer of Roseafar//.]]\n\nIt has been observed that the time frame in which an SCP-4551-1 illusion persists for, is based upon the decibel rating that was produced. For more information, please see the table below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-4551-1 Decibel Rating and SCP-4551-1 Time.\" hide=\"Close File.\"]]\n\nPlease note, the following decibel ratings are rounded.\n\n||~ Decibel rating during ringing: ||~ Length of time that an SCP-4551-1 illusion persisted for: ||\n|| <40 dB || No effect. ||\n|| 40 dB || 4 minutes. ||\n|| 60 dB || 6 minutes. ||\n|| 80 dB || 8 minutes ||\n|| 100 dB || 10 minutes. ||\n|| >100 dB || No effect. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Update:** Rust has been documented occurring on SCP-4551, with about 3 mm^^2^^ of rust occuring daily, generally forming around the base of the bell. As of █/██/████, it has been discovered that when a human subject rings SCP-4551 while the object is rusted[[footnote]] SCP-4551 needs to have 50% of its area covered in rust for the cognitohazard to occur.[[/footnote]], a cognitohazard occurs in which the memory of a deceased individual is completely forgotten by the ringer. For more information, please see addendum no. 3. It is currently unknown what will occur if SCP-4551 is rung while fully rusted.\n\nThe //Prayer of Rosefar//, a holy book from the region, describes SCP-4551's rust effect in the following manner:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Rust and Man' Transcript.\" hide=\"Close Text.\"]]\n\n//Hawk! Man com and se, that such a memoy iss vieweable fore suxh a briaght momenat; but ala's my sun, my dughter, for all of God's mircles, a pric iz to be peid.//[[footnote]] Modern English Translation: Hark! Man come and see that such a memory is viewable for such a bright moment; but alas, my son, my daughter, for all of God's mighty miracles, this has such a price to pay. [[/footnote]]\n\n//From ur fatheras, from uer mother's, dead and barrow. They 'old Devil's blood, stained on teh bel. Let ye thinke: Hath memory desevred bloodshed, agoeny suffreing? Thy God only know, only jusdge, when our holy gost if our loved ones comes blesed true.// [[footnote]] Modern English Translation: From your fathers, from your mothers, dead and burried. The Devil came for their blood, now stained on our bell. Let one think; Has the memory deserved bloodshed, agony and suffering? Our God only knows, only judge, when our holy ghost of our loved ones becomes blessed true. [[/footnote]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum No. 1: History and Recovery Information:** \n\n[[<]]\nSCP-4551 was originally discovered in Roseafar[[footnote]] Also spelled 'Rosefar' [[/footnote]], Scotland, a secluded and autonomous village located near the Scottish capital of Edinburgh.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=20190421_011057.jpg |\n    caption=Roseafar, Scotland.]]\n[[<]]\nOriginally a dead bell[[footnote]] A bell used by the Catholic Church in the Middle Age, used to drive evil spirits away during funerals, and offer comfort to the dead. [[/footnote]], SCP-4551 was used by citizens in the village, for religious ceremonies and festivals.\n \nAccording to a senior member of  Roseafar, Fr. George Albert, SCP-4551 was considered to be a holy item, and was used to wish for harvests and to celebrate and revere dead members of the community. A special ceremony known as the '//Gost of God'// was conducted to remove rust from SCP-4551, and to prevent deceased members from being forgotten by the population of the village. This ceremony required a dying member of the community to baptize the bell. A special song was sung during the ceremony, viewable as a transcript below.\n[[/<]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Gost Of God' Transcript.\" hide=\"Close Text.\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Maen, caome send sae aend sell dead maen Shael liea, whean that comaes based and baerre, era have noathing wean we away faed, well tha t we cares foare is worams, Escaeot flat which we dka for God's sake, wea have naothing ready but God's Goetz and a latest memy.//[[footnote]] Modern English Translation:  Man, come and see:  See how all dead men shall lie. When that comes bad and bare,\nwe have nothing when we away fare: all that we care for is worms:—except for that which we do for God's sake, we have nothing ready but God's ghost, and a last memory. [[/footnote]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[<]]\nGhost' sightings and reports of paranormal activity were frequent in the area surrounding Roseafar, with the local area using the sightings as a method to attract tourism to the region. These sightings had not been taken seriously until April 9th, 2005, when, during a mass offered in Edinburgh for the recently deceased Catholic Pope John Paul II, SCP-4551 was rung, triggering the appearance of 23 instances of SCP-4551-1. The presiding priest, Roseafar native Fr. George Albert, confessed to removing SCP-4551 and moving it to Edinburgh for this mass. \n\nFoundation agent Lilly Amarte confiscated SCP-4551 at the ceremony, and George Albert and the congregation were detained, and given class-A amnestics. \n[[/<]]\n\n**Addendum No. 2: SCP-4551 Testing Log**\n\nFive tests were conducted with SCP-4511, viewable below. \n\nCurrently, SCP-4551 summons SCP-4551-1 instances regardless of the ringer's place of birth.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-4551 Test Results.\" hide=\"Close Test Results.\"]]\n\n\n||~ Subject: ||~  Identity of SCP-4551-1||~  Duration of manifestation (Minutes) .||~ First words or activity performed by an SCP-4511-1 illusion.||~ Last words spoken or activity performed by an SCP-4551-1 illusion.||~ Summary of Interaction. ||\n|| Dr. ███ Welling. ||  █████  Welling.

The following tests had been conducted by Dr. Amie Amarte and Dr. Lucy Daniels, tested on D-4515.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-4451 Rust Test.\" hide=\"Close.\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**SCP-4451- Rust Test Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 6/6/20██.\n\n**Experiment Lead:** Dr. Amie Amarte, Dr. Lucy Daniels.\n\n**Subject:** SCP-4551 (Rusted.)

Currently, the only long term side effect is clinical depression, and periods of muteness.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"D-4515 Follow-Up Interview.\" hide=\"Close.\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**D-4515 Follow-Up Interview.**\n\n**Date:** 1/28/20██\n\n**Experiment Lead:** Dr. Amie Amarte, Dr. Lucy Daniels.\n\n**Subject:** D-4515\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**1200 Hours** //D-4515 is brought into interview room 361, meeting with Dr. Daniels, and Dr. Amarte.//\n\n**Dr. Daniels:** Please be seated.

The subject seems to have completely forgotten the memory of their own mother, not even able to recognize her from a photo. How frightning... We might be able to use SCP-4551 as an emergency amnestic, but the overall scope is going to be pretty limited. Might only be for Roseafar, but I don't know just yet. I don't think it occurs with a location or memory, just a person. And besides that, the after-effects may be too severe. Yet it’s not as though there aren’t just as many ethical issues with our standard source of amnestics…  But is it //right//? I just feel a tinge guilty, erasing a man's memory from him.
