Project SKYSCRAPER-32 is to determine the feasibility of alternative means of terrestrial evacuation. Project SKYSCRAPER-33 is to devise a broad range of social preservation and  containment contingency plans for the failure of all other SKYSCRAPER projects.\n\n//19 iterations of SCP-3649 Special Containment Procedures have been archived and hidden.//\n\n**Description:** SCP-3649 is an altostratus undulatus cloud formation that maintains a static position relative to the Earth's surface. All electromagnetic waves and physical matter that pass through SCP-3649 are disrupted to varying extents, ranging from degradation of radio signals to complete collapse of molecular structures. Collisions between SCP-3649 and mundane clouds result in the former subsuming the mass of the latter.[[footnote]]via a type-4 Hoffman-Ritz process. See: Kassovitz, Lily, Jr. \"Aerovores and Itinerant Storms: Adjusting Classifications of Anomalous Nephology.\" //Foundation Internal Journal of Meteorology// 75, no. 1 (January 13, 2020): 355-391.[[/footnote]] Certain types of clouds motivate notably larger growth than others following this integration process (cumulonimbus variants in particular). No precipitation has been recorded originating from within SCP-3649.\n\n**[[span style=\"color:#600\"]][L-2 CLEARANCE REQUIRED][[/span]]**\n\n**Addendum 3649-A (Current Sample Status):**\n\n**[[span style=\"color:#600\"]][L-2 CLEARANCE REQUIRED][[/span]]**\n\n**Addendum 3649-B (Anomaly Crosstesting Results):**\n\n**[[span style=\"color:#600\"]][L-4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED][[/span]]**\n\n**Addendum 3649-C (Documentation Associated with SCP-3649):**\n\n__Preliminary Anomaly Evaluation (821-NA)__\n\n__HINDSIGHT Analysis: Disappearance of Flight UA1788__\n\n__Site-82 Quarterly Operations Report (April 2091)__\n\n__Site-82 Audit Request (Approved)__ \n\n__MTF Beta-99 Nonstandard Amnestic Dissemination Request__\n\n__MTF Beta-99 Expedition Report (Hazard, Nebraska)__ \n\n__Preliminary Mass Relocation Proposal (Hazard, Nebraska)__\n\n__SCP-3649 Finalized Classification and Database Entry Notice__\n\n__Transcript: Declassified North American Regional Director Brief (May 25, 2091)__ \n\n__Application for the Distribution of Memetic Agents (KHGI Nebraska TV / KGOR 99.0 FM)__\n\n__Authorization to Brief Heads of State (146-NA)__\n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: expansion and altitude decrease)__\n\n__Record of Weapon System Transfer for Testing Purposes (Site-04 to Site-82)__\n\n__FORESIGHT Analysis: Predicted Food Shortages Related to Ongoing Anomalous Activity__\n\n__Transcript: Declassified Americas Regional Directors Brief (May 31, 2091)__ \n\n__Updated Guidelines for Detaining Civilians in an Area of Anomalous Activity (June 12, 2091)__\n\n__Application for the Distribution of Memetic Agents (Local radio, television, mobile shouter systems)__\n\n__Authorization to Brief Heads of State (148-NA/CA/SA)__\n\n__Transcript: Communication with Known Group of Interest Representative (3032-GOC)__\n\n__Record of Anomaly Transfer for Crosstesting Purposes (Site-07 to Site-82)__\n\n__Authorization to Brief Heads of State (150-NA/CA/SA/EU/AF)__\n\n__Emergency Technology Acquisition Directive (Alternative means of satellite uplink/downlink)__\n\n__FORESIGHT Analysis: Predicted Geopolitical Conflict Related to Ongoing Anomalous Activity__\n\n__Application for the Distribution of Memetic Agents (All available systems)__\n\n__Record of Weapon System Transfer for Testing Purposes (Site-04, Site-09, Site-75 to Site-82)__\n\n__Record of Anomaly Transfer for Crosstesting Purposes (Site-02, Site-33, Site-59 to Site-82)__\n\n__Authorization to Brief Heads of State (152-ALL)__\n\n__Transcript: Communication with Known Group of Interest Representative (3036-GOC)__\n\n__Transcript: Communication with Known Group of Interest Representative (3037-HI)__\n\n__Transcript: Communication with Known Group of Interest Representative (3038-SH)__\n\n__Authorization to Brief Heads of State (153-ALL)__\n\n__O5 Memo: Immediate Cessation of Communication With All External Organizations (June 25, 2091)__\n\n__Record of Final Transmission to Satellite Systems (June 26, 2091)__\n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: global enclosure)__\n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: altitude decrease)__\n\n__Assorted Personnel and Equipment Transfer Records (7751 entries)__\n\n__O5 Memo: Regarding Emergency Alterations to Foundation Unified Law (July 7, 2091)__\n\n__Updated Guidelines for Conscripting Individuals in an Area of Ongoing Anomalous Activity (July 9, 2091)__\n\n__MTF Beta-99 Expedition Report (Surface, Earth)__ \n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: altitude decrease)__\n\n__MTF Beta-99 Expedition Report (Surface, Earth)__ \n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: altitude decrease)__\n\n__MTF Beta-99 Expedition Report (Surface, Earth)__ \n\n__SCP-3649 Documentation Update (See edits: significant altitude decrease)__\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3648]]] | SCP-3649 | [[[SCP-3650]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Pedantique]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** cloudcover\n> **Name:** cloudcover\n> **Author:** Rocketjim54\n> **License:** CC-BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://web.archive.org/web/20180825213850/https://www.flickr.com/photos/rocketjim54/7469923240 Flickr]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
