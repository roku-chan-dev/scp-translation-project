The air is warm and damp, and I can feel the fabric of my dress shirt begin to stick to my skin. Frustrated and impatient, I continue to wander the halls until I find a strange, unmarked double door that stands out amongst the rest.\n\nI take out my keycard labeled **Ethics Committee Member — 08** and press it to the keycard scanner as it makes a happy chime. The scanner turns green, and the door makes a loud clicking sound. I look around me, left and right, seeing the empty corridors and their blinding overhead lights.\n\nI'm alone. \n\nI grab the handle and pull the door open, letting the light from the hall pierce the darkness that tries to cower in the corners of the room. In the middle of the room was a metal cabinet desk, lit only by a sole ceiling light hanging above. I enter and close the door behind me, hearing the door click and lock shut. \n\nI'm not alone. \n\nI look towards the camera that's attached in the top right corner of the dimly lit room, staring at me. Its lenses focus on my face, scanning and storing my faceprint. They would know I was here. I look across the dark room and see several offline sentries standing at parade rest. I can't even imagine how many interns lost their lives accidentally stumbling in here. I walk to the desk and sit in the chair, seeing the lockbox, a folder, and a computer terminal gathering dust. The folder piqued my interest immediately, its contents marred by numerous redactions. I could hear my shallow breaths stagger as I rifle through the documents, my eyes darting through, skimming the contents before moving on to the next page. \n\nMy curiosity tempted me even further. \n\nI put the folder down, as it didn't contain anything of use to me, and stared at the dusty LED screen of the terminal. I reach into my suit pocket and grab a small rag as I wipe the screen. Once I was done, I began to fold it, but I hesitated and threw it onto the floor. It's too dirty to put it back in my pocket. \n\nI raise my finger towards the terminal and press the blinking power button.

No Foundation personnel, except for the O5 Council and the Ethics Committee, are to know of the existence of SCP-7306. The Director of Site-02 is to be informed of the containment procedures of SCP-7306 but not its descriptive function to reduce information leaks. All documents, digital or physical, are to be stored in SCP-7306's storage unit and never displaced from the room. \n\nSCP-7306 is to be contained in an unmarked private storage unit at Site-02. Multiple targeting systems and devices scanning the room controlled via Site-02's A.I. system have been installed for security purposes. Due to previous incidents, no other Foundation or site personnel are to test or use SCP-7306 for any reason. \n\nContinuous utilization of SCP-7306 will cause rapid mental deterioration and will require psychological evaluation and therapy. It is recommended any future use of SCP-7306 is limited to one use to avoid **[DATA EXPUNGED]**. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7306 is a blank, pristine polaroid film with no distinctive identifying marks, that is impossible to be damaged or destroyed. It exhibits no visual anomalous properties until held by a human subject with average memory retention and mental acuity. The blank image is then slowly replaced by an image the subject is familiar with, usually a prevalent moment in the subject's life. \n\nOnce the image has been fully colorized in the film, the subject will be unresponsive to any interaction or communication for a short period of time. Their consciousness will then transfer to the time period to which they have traveled and experience a duration ranging from one to twenty-four (1-24) hours before their consciousness spontaneously returns to their physical body. After said subjects' consciousness returns, opening SCP-7306-2 will reveal a new polaroid film (-A to -G), containing no anomalous properties, capturing a random moment the subject was photographed as well as a new entry in the journal found in SCP-7306-2. \n\nSCP-7306-2 is a small steel lock box that contains SCP-7306-A to -G, a photographer's journal, several used pencils that are utilized each time SCP-7306 is activated, and a replacement lens for a polaroid camera. The journal describes events that SCP-7306-3, the photographer, has photographed and logged. It is unknown if the photographer has written down the interaction in the journal as a warning or if the journal itself is the anomaly manipulating spacetime. \n\nSCP-7306-3 is a Caucasian male; records indicate his name to be Pater Beard, a famous photographer who has been missing since 2020 and was found dead in Camp Hero State Park. No other information of the photographer, SCP-7306-3, is known at this time.

Upon looking at his record, it is shown he was arrested for simple possession of small quantities of illegal drugs as well as drug-induced homicide. Three out of five individuals who were present during that time overdosed and died before paramedics could arrive. Campus police caught and detained Amir Bugti, charging him and those who rented the property. When the subject was informed of what he did, he refused to believe the Foundation staff.
