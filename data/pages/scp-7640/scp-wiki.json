Anomalous O5 Council members must be terminated without exception.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7640 designates a series of windows that spontaneously materialize within the living quarters assigned to O5 Council personnel. Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 immediately undergoes a cognitohazardous effect, causing their immediate resignation. Inhabitants of the same room as SCP-7640 universally display a heightened curiosity towards it; however, it remains undetermined whether this response is anomalous. Those who peer through SCP-7640 provide disparate accounts of the visual contents on the opposing side. Presented below are selected examples of reported observations.\n\n\n|| O5 Council Member || Observations || Anomalous Effects ||\n|| O5-7, \"The Fool\" || A small farm. O5-7 reports the sound of cattle and the laughter of a baby. || O5-7 reported feelings of melancholy. Amnesticized. ||\n|| O5-11, \"The Emperor\" || Several children bullying another child. The point of view then comforted the child, hugging him. || O5-11 reported a strong feeling of regret. Terminated. ||\n|| O5-2, \"The Lovers\" || A large pod of dolphins underwater. They appear to be playing. || O5-2 reported feeling content before being removed from the room. Terminated. ||\n|| O5-13, \"The Null\" || A therapist's office. Sounds of sobbing and comfort are audible. || O5-13 refused to elaborate on his emotions and began crying. Amnesticized. ||\n|| O5-5, \"The Mother\" || A small bed in a hospital with a weak, elderly man laying in it. The viewer proceeded to feed him. || O5-5 refused to leave her living quarters. Mobile Task Force involvement was necessary. Terminated in combat. ||\n|| O5-9, \"The Star\" || See below. ||\n@@ @@\nIn order to better understand SCP-7640, and the effects it has on O5 Council members, the Foundation dispatched Doctor Tiana Mark Rosanne to conduct a series of interviews. These interviews aimed to acquire additional details about the effects of SCP-7640. The following log contains a transcription of the last interview conducted between O5-9 and Dr. Rosanne.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** O5-9\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Rosanne\n\n**Foreword:** This interview was conducted shortly after O5-9 viewed SCP-7640 and shortly before he was terminated.[[footnote]]Dr. Rosanne was not made aware of the termination before the interview as to maintain a lack of bias.[[/footnote]]\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**//O5-9 walks into the room and sits in an office chair. He appears upset.//**\n\n**O5-9:** Well, I wasn't expecting someone like you to be, uh... you know. Aren't you worried those shoes of yours will carry the stain?\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean. What stain?\n\n**O5-9:** Oh, you're the interviewer. Forget I said anything, classified Council business.\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** I'll try to ignore that. Are you O5-9?\n\n**O5-9:** I would say something along the lines of \"the one and only\" but I've read the file, you've read the file, so we both know I am definitely not.\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** Am I missing something? What did you see in 7640?\n\n**O5-9:** Would it matter? Would telling you stop anything? All of this will end up in a report that will be handed to the committee, and nobody will do anything.\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** Even if you don't think your statement will do anything to stop the anomaly, it's your duty to say something.\n\n**//O5-9 stands up and begins pacing around the room.//**\n\n**O5-9:** \"Duty\" my ass. Have you noticed any connections yet? You're an interviewer, and you've talked to us all. Review your notes that you've been scratching in that little book this whole time.\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** It's not my job to make connections. I'm not a researcher, so-\n\n**O5-9:** But you care, don't you? Look at the notes, and tell me what you think.\n\n**//Dr. Rosanne looks down at her notepad.//**\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** Well, -13 saw a therapist office, -2 saw dolphins, and -5 saw a hospital. I don't see any similarities.\n\n**O5-9:** Shit. Of //course// you don't, you don't know- didn't know them. -13? He had a degree in psychology. -2? Marine biology. -5? She was a nurse before coming here. You really want to know what I saw? Myself, sitting on a back porch, looking over a nicely trimmed lawn. My wife[[footnote]]O5-9's wife and children were amnesticized upon his employment to the Foundation.[[/footnote]] beside me. Both of us were enjoying the... the crisp morning air before the kids woke up. It was exactly what I had before this place took it all away!\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** I- I'm so sorry about that. Um, I don't know what to say.\n\n**O5-9:** There's nothing you can say. You want my opinions on 7640? It... never mind, cut it, this interview is over.\n\n**Dr. Rosanne:** But you can't-\n\n**//O5-9 storms out of the room, shortly before being terminated.//**\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n= **The revised SCP-7640 file is restricted to the Administrator.

Any O5 Council member that peers through SCP-7640 views an alternate world where an alternate version of themself performs activities that they enjoyed before becoming a member of the O5 Council. In 100% of cases where an instance of SCP-7640 is viewed, the O5 Council member attempts to resign. It is currently unknown if this is part of its anomalous effect, or a natural response to viewing such imagery.\n\nAdditionally, amnestication has proven ineffective in suppressing memories of SCP-7640.[[footnote]] The current reason why is unknown, this is either due to the Mnestics being regularly prescribed to the O5 Council or some other effect.
