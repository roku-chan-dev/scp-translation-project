No details are included.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-sandbox-3:more-by-rimple]]\n[[include info:more]]\nThis SCP was written and recorded in under 24 hours for [http://www.scp-wiki.net/72-hour-jam-contest The 72 Hour Jam Contest], for Day 1's theme //Murder Mystery//.\n\nThanks to [[user Omino]] for sensitivity reading.\n[[include info:end]]\n\n**Item #**: SCP-3772\n\n**Object Class**: Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures**: As SCP-3772 is considered dormant, and can be easily disregarded as non-anomalous, containment focuses on suppression of discussion surrounding its method of distribution. Contacts in all major media-sharing platforms are working alongside the Foundation to assist with pre-emptive removal of media meeting SCP-3772's parameters, under the guide of content-protection rules.\n\n**Description**: SCP-3772 is a phenomenon whereby internet content meeting certain criteria will convert to a video or infographic relating to the death of Faith Bassen in 2020. This conversion only affects end-user machines, and does not alter the media for others who have not triggered the phenomenon. \n\nTesting has identified the following as the primary parameters to convert media:\n* The content is not owned/created by the user who posted it.\n* A caption of or within the content alludes to a desire to discover the content's creator, whether or not said desire can be judged to be genuine (For instance, \"OMG who did this??? So talented 😍\").\n\nSecondary factors which are not required but seem to increase the likelihood of SCP-3772 occurring:\n\n* Artist/creator signatures and watermarks have been removed from the content.\n* The account posting the content has posted other media which matches the primary parameters.\n* The machine viewing the content is on US geopolitical territory. This factor increases exponentially as the machine approaches the census-designated place of Comfort, Texas[[footnote]]The town where Faith Bassen was living at the time of her death.[[/footnote]].\n\nMost commonly, SCP-3772 manifests as a static image of Faith Bassen with captioning providing details of her disappearance and the discovery of her body, with a strong focus on the lack of an official investigation by the local police force. When manifesting in video form, this information will commonly give way to phone camera recordings of Faith, with the names and faces of others appearing in the footage digitally censored. This footage is interspersed with graphic and provocative descriptions of her injuries, threats towards the perpetrators and the repeated line \"FAITH BASSEN WAS MURDERED\", which doubled as a hashtag for the movement to press the local police force to investigate the death.\n\nThe first known instance of SCP-3772 came to the Foundation's attention on December 8^^th^^, 2020, two months after the death of Ms. Bassen. After confirmation of anomalous nature, initial containment focused on suppression of discussion and investigation of SCP-3772's trigger parameters. While this was successful in most cases, the prevalence of instances in the vicinity of Comfort, Texas, lead to strong local awareness of the case. As SCP-3772 was assumed by the public of Comfort to be the product of non-anomalous activity, priority was given to continued suppression of media attention outside this area.\n\nIn January 2021, the Unusual Incidents Unit took over management of the investigation at the Foundation's request. With their input, the suspects in the Faith Bassen case were successfully identified and brought to accelerated trial between May and July 2021. Following this, the incident rate of SCP-3772 manifestations dropped almost completely.\n\n**Addendum: Chatlogs**\n\nAnalysis of existing archived chatlogs for GoI-5869 (\"Gamers Against Weed\") show a number of conversations related to this issue, primarily involving the users warysue and tiedyeduck in a sidechat labelled //#wip//. As chatlogs are only available from the laptop of a member of the GoI who had little interaction with warysue, the majority of these conversations are contextless or incomplete.\n\n**Excerpt 1: November 17^^th^^, 2020**\n\n> -> **you** joined\n> **gaycopmp4**: that all sounds doable yeah but we'll need to work on the specific vids you wanna include\n> **bluntfiend**: You're really going for this, huh?\n> -> **Quavo** joined\n> **warysue**: we are .

Her behavior may be more extreme for a time, but remember that she is working through a trauma. I believe you know what that feels like.\n> **tiedyeduck**: We all do, bones.\n> **tiedyeduck**: This is gonna be a clusterfuck, isn't it?\n\n**Excerpt 2: November 22^^nd^^, 2020**\n> -> **warysue** joined\n> **lesbian_gengar**: I /could/ do that but what would be the point\n> **warysue**: hey All\n> **harmpit**: comn gnengar you knwo itsll be funny as hsit\n> **kkrule**: hey sue i think duck was looking for you earlier\n> **kkrule**: tiedyeduck: ping ping\n> **warysue**: I Don't want to talk to \n> **harmpit**: mr fucking olbiquly refranced will risse from the asehs\n> **warysue**: to him\n> **tiedyeduck**: I just wanna say I'm sorry.\n> **lesbian_gengar**: talk to gaycop about this she's better with computer stuff\n> **tiedyeduck**: I came in too strong the other day - I want to help, I just think you're going about it the wrong way.\n> **warysue**: that's a shitty apology\n> **tiedyeduck**: Come on.\n> **kkrule**: uh sorry i didnt know you were fighting\n> **warysue**: no you Come On .

Even if the cops do start an investigation, it's been weeks and she was found on a riverbank, there's no evidence to examine. Maybe if they'd done a proper autopsy they'd have something to work on, but they couldn't.\n> **kkrule**: yeah not cool harmpit come on\n> -> **you** left (Timeout)\n\n**Excerpt 3: December 9^^th^^, 2020**\n> **orbhorse**: pee is stored in the galls\n> -> **warysue** joined\n> **heartshapeddoxx**: ob dude you're the worst\n> **bones**: Warysue, you should know that The Daily Dot published a short article about #FaithBassenWasMurdered 23 minutes ago.\n> **warysue**: I was just about to link it, yeah !\n> **bluntfiend**: Shit my guys, I think I just swallowed a whole chicken wing.\n> **warysue**: it's starting to Happen\n> **heartshapeddoxx**: is this like a new goof or something\n> **heartshapeddoxx**: I'm so out of the loop\n> **kkrule**: hi HSD are you new\n> **warysue**: it's very much Not A Goof .\n> **bones**: Heartshapeddoxx is an older member of the chat, from before my time here.
