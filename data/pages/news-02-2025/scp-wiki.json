They recently announced that Release Stage 0 is complete and will be moving onto Release Stage 1 for the new project plan.  \n\nTo those unaware, Wikijump will be the new home for SCP wiki users that is developed by the English SCP Wiki's Technical Team. Their mission is to create a platform that is up-to-date and maintainable so that we may all continue to engage with the community that we have built. \n\nRelease Stage 0 is a trial run to make sure the fundamentals can be built and improved upon in future stages. Here is what they have to say: \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAs you may remember, recently we announced the new project plan (more detailed reading) for Wikijump development, dividing the work into a series of stages. Each one would be governed by an overall state that the project should be at at each stage, which allows us to focus on producing an MVP (minimum viable product) more effectively.\n\nThis blog post is commemorating the fact that Release Stage 0 is complete! As you can see, all the items in the epic are finished, and I thought I’d take the time to reflect on what has been achieved so far.\nAs noted in the announcement post, Stage 0 was pretty small. The primary goal was to start off on an even foundation: we had some areas which were really well-developed and others which were pretty spare, and by implementing some of these basic missing components we can continue development in a more evenly-balanced way.\n\nIn the upcoming year we will be starting on Release Stage 1, which furthers this goal by getting all the basic platform operations, infrastructure, and UIs implemented. Some specific items planned include page locks, user creation and restrictions, and the wjfiles user data hosting site! After this stage, with all the fundamentals set up, it should be easier for various contributors to add new features and fixes.\nOverall, I’ve been excited with the changes we’ve been able to make recently and hope for many more in 2025!\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\nBe sure to check out the blog post for further information: https://www.wikijump.org/2024/12/31/release-stage-0/\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Strange Matter//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n------\n------\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/local--files/torquemada-2025/TORQUEMADA.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Spanish-speaking SCP Wiki, or \"ES\" for short, has announced [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/torquemada-2025 Project Torquemada!] Project Torquemada is a community-driven rewrite effort designed to bring old Series I ES articles up to modern writing standards. It's not that the articles are bad, but a lot of them were deemed lacking by the community in recent years, so ES Staff decided to show them some love.\n\nThe old versions of the articles will not be deleted, but rather will be moved to the VO category, which stands for //Versión Original//, or in English, Original Version. The rewrite event will continue until the 12th anniversary of the ES Wiki, which is on May 5th. At that point, all the rewrites will be posted and a special achievement title will be granted to everyone who participated.\n\nThis of course, means that the INT versions of articles will be needing updating so it is going to be a busy time to be a translator in the near future!
