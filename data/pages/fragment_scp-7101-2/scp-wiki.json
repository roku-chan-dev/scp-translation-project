These individuals then began attributing such advancements to \"Luck\", while also making references to SCP-7101 more often.\n\nSCP-7101 was then incorrectly identified in 2028, after developments in the Nooshperic[[footnote]] The space which encompasses all human thoughts and concepts.[[/footnote]] Department led to noticing an alien concept construct, which was attached to the concepts of \"Random\", \"Gain\", and \"Loss\", resulting in a \"cluster\"  labeled SCP-7101-A.\n\nSCP-7101-A was then found to activate more frequently in individuals near SCP-7101-1 or SCP-7101-1 rich artifacts, or subjects possessing a CRV lower than 4.1 when reflecting on SCP-7101-1 related effects, leading to specialized Noosphere-related testing, discovering SCP-7101's memeplex.\n\nAll data on SCP-7101 was then compiled in 2031, and procedures were then devised after 15, February 2032., and put into place by 29, October 2034.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 50px; margin: 40px\"]]\nTEMPORAL ANOMALY DETECTED.
