At all times, at least one Foundation agent is to wait at the baggage claim in Newark Liberty International Airport. Whenever SCP-6902 appears in this baggage claim, said agent is to take it to a secluded location until it dematerializes. In the event that an unknown party claims SCP-6902, the identity of said party is to be determined as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6902 is a red rolling suitcase that lacks any form of branding or iconography. Approximately every six hours, SCP-6902 will dematerialize from its current location and rematerialize within a baggage claim carousel at Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nUpon discovery, SCP-6902 had a baggage tag identifying it as belonging to flight 1814 from PHX[[footnote]] IATA airport code for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport [[/footnote]] to EWR[[footnote]] IATA airport code for Newark Liberty International Airport [[/footnote]], on January 12th 2004. Notably, this flight crashed due to a mechanical failure, killing all passengers on board. This baggage tag has since been removed.\n\nAs SCP-6902 dematerializes, all items within it will become an SCP-6902-1 instance. Whenever SCP-6902 materializes, all SCP-6902-1 instances will materialize within it as well.\n\nThe following list comprises all SCP-6902-1 instances:\n* Five long sleeved dress shirts;\n* A pair of dress shoes;\n* Three neckties;\n* Seven pairs of underwear;\n* Four pairs of dress socks;\n* A pair of sunglasses;\n* A black leather belt;\n* A disposable camera;\n* A toiletries kit;\n* An empty leather folder;\n* A gift bag containing a stuffed bear.\n\nThe following message is embroidered on the inside of SCP-6902 itself. \"For Jason. You won't lose this one.\"\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6901]]] | SCP-6902 | [[[SCP-6903]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
