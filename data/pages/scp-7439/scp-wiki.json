If you are not, we are desperate. Your position is irrelevant – what matters is that you are needed, not just by the Foundation, but by humankind and potentially more.\n\nYou may recall a recent blood test. You are here because you tested positive for the DBAA-e7 gene; it is extremely rare, but critical to accomplish your assignment. You may not be the only living person with this gene, but there are other limiting factors involved; assume you are the last person able to accomplish this task. Do not fail us.\n\nThis introductory video should have come with four documents. First is the file for SCP-090, the anomaly you will be working on. Second is the file for SCP-7439, the anomaly you will be working //with//. Third is the proposal document and addenda for the cross-test you will conduct, and fourth should be the complete records of all information left to you by previous participants.\n\nIf you have not been provided these, request them from the agent assigned to oversee you. If there is no agent, the situation is dire and you must find them yourself.\n\nDo not rush. Your thirty-seven seconds have not begun, and will not until you want them to. You have as much time as you need to prepare, and you may spend it however you deem appropriate, so long as you are preparing. If there is further information you believe will be relevant, request it from your assigned agent; your security clearance can be dealt with later. Your co-operation will not be classified.\n\nOnce you are ready, inform the agent – or if there is none, go to Area-090, where both required anomalies should be found – and begin the test. But make sure you are ready.\n\nYou will have only thirty-seven seconds to save the world.\n\nYou will not get a second chance.\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"Read the SCP-090 file.\" hide=\"Put away the SCP-090 file.\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item #:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-090 SCP-090]\n\n**Object Class:** Safe ([http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level] ##red|● Red##)\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-090 is currently stored in a high-security bunker at a dedicated Foundation facility, Area-090. No other anomalies are to be stored at Area-090 unless necessary, and any such anomalies must be relocated off-site as soon as possible. SCP-090 should not be stored at any other location unless necessary and should be returned to Area-090 or another dedicated facility as soon as possible. SCP-090 must never be store at any facility containing anomalies, munitions, machines, and/or technology with the potential to destroy the facility and/or instigate any K-class scenario.\n\nSCP-090 should not be physically restrained or altered for any reason. individuals attempting to do so must be apprehended or terminated as necessary. \n\nThe five exposed faces of SCP-090 should be recorded at all times. AXAl.aic has been assigned to monitor and record all SCP-090 activity, and alert Foundation personnel as necessary when able. SCP-090-1 should be redacted from all visual footage of SCP-090, unless otherwise necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-090 is a collection of approximately 60,000 black ceramic fragments, tightly arranged by unknown means to form a misshapen cube 3 metres in length, width, and height; analysis indicates SCP-090 was originally a single cube, all fragments of which are present in the collection. Each fragment features a small portion of an intricate engraving on its outer surface, which appear to glow with a ‘negative light’ while correctly aligned with another complementary piece. \n\nEvery 37 seconds, a single row or column of SCP-090 fragments will progressively relocate to an adjacent face of the object in a manner comparable to the ‘Rubik’s Cube’ puzzle.[[footnote]]There is no evidence of any connection between Ernő Rubik and SCP-090. Despite similarities in appearance and mechanics, the ‘Rubik’s Cube’ puzzle was developed completely independently to SCP-090.[[/footnote]] Relocating pieces – especially those aligned with complementary pieces – are resistant to these rotations, and will grind against other fragments as they pass; no evidence of erosion or degradation has been observed on any SCP-090 pieces. Once all pieces have stopped at a location adjacent to their former position, another 37 seconds will elapse before the next rotation begins.\n\nSCP-090 rotations correspond to the initiation and/or continuation of undesirable, typically catastrophic events; each outer face of the object is associated with a location or concept relative to SCP-090 (listed below), while the magnitude of the event/s correlate with the quantity of misaligned fragments on the associated face. \n||~ Face # ||~ Concept ||~ Average number of alignments ||~ Example ||\n|| 1 || ‘Global’ || 73–71% || Formation of Cyclone Tracey (Dec 21, 1974; 83%) ||\n|| 2 || Uncertain || 50% || No known corresponding events. ||\n|| 3 || ‘Extraterrestrial’ (Uncertain) || 69-61% || [[[SCP-179]]] points at Uranus. (Jan 19, 2004 & onwards; 74%) ||\n|| 4 || ‘Local’ || 89-83% || Major containment breach at Site-183 (Apr 5, 2017; 95%) ||\n|| 5 || {{[DATA EXPUNGED]}} || 13% || {{[DATA EXPUNGED]}} ||\n|| 6 || ‘Time’ (Uncertain) || 49%[[footnote]]This average has steadily declined by approximately 2% per year.[[/footnote]] || Alleged by the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7432 Department of Chronology]. (Mar 21, 2009; 37%) ||\nIf an attempt is made to physically rearrange or restrain any SCP-090 fragments, the collection will immediately undergo a rapid succession of rotation events which typically reduce the number of alignments on the ‘local’ face, thereby instigating a catastrophic event in the anomaly’s proximity.\n\nThe number of total alignments across SCP-090 has gradually decreased throughout its known, recorded history; all SCP-090 fragments are expected to be misaligned by March of 2099.\n\nSCP-090-1 is an unclear element correlating to the area visible within SCP-090 between misalignments and during rotation events. It is unclear whether SCP-090-1 is an indeterminate object/entity, or a property affecting the region of space within SCP-090; observers are unable to identify any meaningful characteristics of SCP-090-1 other than its location, and all recordings of SCP-090-1 similarly retain this cognitohazardous property.\n\n**Acquisition:** SCP-090 was acquired during a raid on an Adherents of Aapapht monastery on April 10, 1942. Recovered records indicates the group acquired the object from an unspecified group in 1533 CE, along with vague records of the object’s alignments since 1242 CE; the group had been studying SCP-090 and SCP-090-1 to determine their correlation to the group’s cosmology. All members of the group were terminated as per standard procedure, and the monastery was destroyed by fire.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Read the SCP-7439 file.\" hide=\"Put away the SCP-7439 file.\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-7439\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7439 is to be stored in a standard hermetically-sealed relic container when not in use. Personnel should minimise handling of SCP-7439 to prevent accidental damage or destruction of the object.\n\nFoundation medical personnel must be forewarned prior to any use of SCP-7439 and given appropriate time to prepare an emergency blood transfusion for the object’s intended user/s. SCP-7439 should always be kept on a flat surface during testing to prevent damage when subjects lose consciousness.\n\nSCP-7439 must be cleaned using appropriate relic protocols following every use.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7439 is a fired clay tablet 15 centimetres in height, 32 centimetres in width, and weighing approximately 2 kilograms. The upper surface is engraved with a large, inverted triangle, with a unique, intricate rune at each of the three vertices; a fourth glyph has been carved into the centre of the shape post-firing. A severely damaged Akkadian cuneiform text is inscribed on the lower surface, which translations indicate was instructions on the correct ritualistic use of the anomaly.\n\nSCP-7439 enables eligible individuals to conduct a series of specific thaumaturgic rituals, with the produced affect varying on which of the four engraved glyphs is incorporated into the performed ritual/s. To be eligible, the user must:\n* Be a single, biologically living human (//homo sapiens//);\n* Possesses the DBAA-e7 gene in their genome (approx. 7.0% world population);\n* Have at no point received any volume of whole blood[[footnote]]Encompassing red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma.[[/footnote]] or constituents originating from a different entity by invasive means (e.g. blood transfusion, limb transplantation).[[footnote]]This exclusion appears to be conceptual instead of literal; subjects will naturally remove and replace all foreign whole blood elements over time, but will remain unable to activate the properties of SCP-7439.[[/footnote]]\n\nDuring use, approximately 50mL of whole blood will demanifest from the eligible user’s system each second; as a result the average human is unable to use SCP-7439 for more than 40 consecutive seconds, at which point loss of consciousness will occur and an immediate blood transfusion is required for survival, which will invalidate the user from any future use of the object. If a user becomes ineligible while using SCP-7439, the anomalous properties of the object will immediately cease.\n\nThere are currently only five known rituals which produce a successful anomalous effect with SCP-7439:\n||~ Ritual Designation / Alias ||~ Description ||\n|| 7439-1, ‘Second Rite of Bellabarisruk’ || Amplifies the potency of all carnomancy,[[footnote]]Manipulation of biological substances, particularly skin, muscle, and bone.[[/footnote]] oneiroimancy,[[footnote]]Manipulation/interpretation of dreams.[[/footnote]] or tychemancy[[footnote]]Manipulation of probability.[[/footnote]] conducted within seven metres of SCP-7439 while active, dependant on which of the three outer glyphs is used as the focus of the ritual; what the inner glyph corresponds to, if anything, is unknown. ||\n|| 7439-2, ‘Crimson Mandate of Shamash’ || Enables the user to establish a potent blood pact with another consenting party, violations of which incur one of four penalties depending on which glyph is used as the focus of the ritual; while the penalties of the upper three symbols are known, there is no record of any subject breaking a pact made with the lowermost glyph. ||\n|| 7439-3 ‘Arbitration of the Three’|| Incrementally alters an unclear, fundamental aspect of targeted objects or entities toward one of four uncertain concepts, depending on the focal glyph. Current speculations for the concepts are: ‘confusion’, ‘obedience’, ‘absconsion’, and ‘tractate’. ||\n|| 7439-4, ‘Judgement of Namtar’ || Inflicts accelerated tumour development, petrification, necrosis, or cardiac arrythmia in an entity designated through the use of a hair sample; descriptions indicate the ritual is intended to kill the target over several hours, however it is impossible to maintain long enough for this to occur. ||\n|| 7439-5 (Unknown) || Reconstructed through trial-and-error with references to a proto-Sarkic grimoire. Revives a deceased biological entity, but inflicts multiple physical and/or mental ailments which invariably result in the entity’s death within 24 hours. ||\n\n**Acquisition:** SCP-7439 was recovered from the National Museum of Scotland following a curator’s accidental activation of the anomaly while demonstrating the execution of a ritual. Records indicate the tablet had been donated to the museum in 1805 as part of the late [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/qntm-s-proposal Sir Edwin Young, 3rd Baronet’s personal ‘Cabinet of Curiosities’], who had acquired the item in 1654 under unclear circumstances; his documentation of seventeen rituals – four of which have been confirmed – indicates contact with a knowledgeable previous owner of SCP-7439, or access to a significant information source. Baronet Young was not aware of the object’s anomalous properties, instead dismissing the rituals as products of myth. It is uncertain whether Baronet Young possessed the DBAA-e7 gene needed to trigger the object’s effects.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Read the cross-test proposal.\" hide=\"Put away the cross-test proposal.\"]]\nSomeone has attached a note to the cover page.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nTo save you some time:\n* It takes almost 2 litres of blood to use the Tablet for 37 seconds. You’ll need a blood transfusion then. **You only have one chance, and you have to finish before the Cube starts turning.** \n* The ritual is on page 17, and you need to repeat it for each glyph. **Always enter exactly seven glyphs.** Every one you miss is worse than getting it wrong. Same for doing extra.\n* **Alignments will increase by 3% if you did the right glyph, and decrease by 3% if you didn’t.** Record your order and the change in alignments so the next person can figure out how many you got right.\n* **The Cube won’t react until its next rotation comes,** since you aren’t changing it physically. It’ll catch up and do a full month’s worth of changes after, though.\n* The Foundation is already nervous cross-testing two anomalies, they won’t bring in a third. You don’t get augments to help with this.\n\nGood luck.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-16314626/scp-7439 Read the notes left by previous participants.]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Say you are ready.\" hide=\"Change your mind.\"]]\n‘Are you sure?’ the agent asks.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7439/The%20Arbitration%20of%20the%20Three.html Say you are sure.]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7438]]] | SCP-7439 | [[[SCP-7440]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Jack Ike]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
