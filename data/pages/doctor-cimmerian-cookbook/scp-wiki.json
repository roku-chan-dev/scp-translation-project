I'm Doctor Cimmerian, and I come from the mythical land of Alabama, ruled by Prester John and home to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-88 Site-88]. We tend to work long nights and eat poor food. Well, food not up to //Cimmerian Standards// anyways. Thus, I come to you with **four ethical Foundation recipes** that'll keep you from starving on long nights with the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2986 sad box] and the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2251 Bel Air disc].\n\n+ __The Apple of Discord__\n\n++ __Ingredients:__\n* 1 Apple\n* 1 Knife\n\n++ __Instructions:__\n* Place the apple on the cutting board so it doesn't roll. If the apple rolls, you're doing it wrong.\n* Cut the apple in five equal slices. It's more ethical this way.\n\n++ __Conclusion:__\n\nMy good friend Christina Morse came up with this one. When I asked her why five slices, she just said that's the way her parents did it. I then asked her again, clearly, why five slices, more specifically why her parents did so. She said she didn't know. When I asked if that's an ethical response, she left the room. I've decided not to push the issue.\n\n+ __Fluffy Rice and Chicken__\n\n++ __Ingredients:__\n* 2 chicken breasts, halved\n* 1 10.5 oz can of mushroom soup\n* 1 soup can of milk\n* 3/4 cup of uncooked rice\n* 1 4 oz can of mushrooms\n* 1 envelope soup mix\n\n++ __Instructions:__\n* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. If it heats to 350 degrees Celcius, tell your oven to stop doing that.\n* Mix all the ingredients together in a 9x12'' glass cake pan. The measurement is very important.\n* Place the chicken on top the ingredients, cover with foil, and bake for one hour.\n* Uncover, stir, and bake for 15 minutes longer. The chicken might come out alive. This result is unethical.\n\n++ __Conclusion:__\n\nYou can potentially serve this with whole, halved, or diced chicken. You have to consider your life choices first, however.\n\n+ __Balsamic Chicken Thighs and Potatos__\n\n++ __Ingredients:__\n* 2 lbs chicken thighs\n* 0.5 cup white balsamic vinegar\n* 2 tsp honey\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* 2 garlic cloves\n* 1 tsp fresh thyme\n* 1 tbsp of fresh parsley\n* 2-3 basil leaves\n* Salt\n* 2 Large Red Potatos\n\n++ __Instructions:__\n* In one bowl, combine vinegar, oil, garlic, honey, thyme, parsley, basil, and salt. If you didn't get that, read it again.\n* Whisk until combined and add chicken thighs. Marinade for 20 minutes. This is so, if the chicken survives, it drowns before you eat it.\n* Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n* On stove-top over medium-high heat, sear the thighs for 3-4 minutes. While you do this, marinade the potatoes. This is so, if the potatoes survive, they drown before you eat them.\n* Put chicken and potatoes in pan and bake for 35-45 minutes.\n\n++ __Conclusion:__\n\nThis won the Site-88 Cooking Contest. I won by eating the other entries before they got judged. There was no rule against this.\n\n+ __Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo__\n\n++ __Ingredients:__\n* 8 oz rotini\n* 12 oz broccoli\n* 1 tbsp olive oil\n* 2 boneless chicken breasts\n* Salt and pepper\n* 2 tbsp butter\n* 2 tbsp flour\n* 3/4 cup of chicken broth\n* 3/4 cup of milk\n* 1/4 cup of cream\n* 1/4 tsp garlic powder\n* 1/4 cup of grated parmesan\n\n++ __Instructions:__\n* Cook the pasta. See my [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/orientation-for-the-pastaphysics-department Pastaphysics Orientation].\n* Add broccoli in the last two minutes of cooking. Drain and set aside.\n* Over medium heat, heat olive oil and cook the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper. Do/cook/season both sides. You don't become a winner by sticking to one side. Let the chicken cool and dice.\n* Melt the butter in a skillet, whisk in the flour, and add the chicken broth and milk. Cook for 1-2 minutes. If you freeze the mixture, figure it out.\n* Stir in the cream and garlic into the mixture for 1-2 minutes until thickened.\n* Stir in the parmesan, chicken, and broccoli. Combine. This is the easiest step as it involves the least skill.\n\n++ __Conclusion:__\n\nThey say a wise man thinks once before he speaks twice. This is wrong. I've only spoken my thoughts once and I've been correct every single time.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
