Everything he did wrong had a multiplicative effect on Nascimbeni's mood. He was an expert thorn.\n\n\"Yes. I'm sure.\" Nascimbeni tapped the executive debriefing summary Ngo had sent to each of them. Ibanez had taken Wettle's copy, reasoning that their operational security wouldn't last long if Wettle lost it in the halls somewhere. \"We just spent a year in nowhere land.\"\n\n\"Like, from the Beatles?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"Sure. Like from the Beatles.\" He had good memories in this office. It was a warm, working space. The walls were homely red tiles, there was well-loved equipment in every corner, there was a mirror -- the omnipresent reminder that Philip Deering, for all his faults, was still plugging along. Nascimbeni loved his office. He resented feeling trapped within it, a feeling he almost never had except for when William Wettle was standing there. \"You were saying, Eileen?\"\n\nVeiksaar opened her mouth, but Wettle cut her off. \"No, look. I was just asking for confirmation, because it... uh... //confirms// something pretty major. This is a replication study. The biggest replication study of all time, in terms of consequences. I want to make absolutely sure the data is right.\"\n\nEileen got her mouth all of the way open this time. \"I can't speak to that data, but //this// data,\" and she tapped a much thicker sheaf of papers -- they were printing these things out to keep them off the network, because nothing said security like an air gap -- \"confirms what Noè's seeing. It's the same situation with all the computer systems.\"\n\n\"Restate that situation?\" Wettle reached up to adjust his glasses, hitting the lens as he always did and tracing a greasy smear across it. He wouldn't bother trying to clean it off until the end of the day, because what would be the point? \"Chief? Other Chief? Technician Chief? //Maintenance// technician Chief? //Hardware//--\"\n\nNascimbeni slapped the table, and Wettle jumped in his seat. \"You can call me Noè too, Wettle.\"\n\nWettle blinked. \"Oh. Okay. Thanks? Uh.\"\n\n\"I'm still going to call you Wettle.\"\n\n\"That makes sense. But yeah... yeah?\"\n\nNascimbeni nodded. \"Yeah. The situation. Every piece of containment apparatus in the Site, judging by the representative sample my people have looked at already, is down in operational efficiency due to damage, unusual wear or component failure, by about forty-four percent.\"\n\n\"How confident are you in that figure?\" Wettle almost sounded like an intelligent person when he talked about his area of expertise. It was jarring.\n\n\"Very. The only thing keeping me from saying 'forty-three point nine zero percent' is that it feels silly being that precise about something like this. But I really do think it's that precise.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" Wettle consulted the papers in front of him, which were dogeared and stained despite having only been printed maybe an hour ago, tops. \"Thirty-six point four four last year, after the Breach. Thirty-three point...\" He was looking down, so of course his glasses fell off. He put them back on, nearly stabbing his own eye out with the armature. \"Where was I...?\"\n\nVeiksaar leaned over and pointed.\n\n\"Yeah. Okay. Thirty-three point seven seven the year before that. Thirty point five nine before that... we had a good long stretch where nothing fucked up, eh?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Nascimbeni looked away.\n\n\"That's good. A long control period. Confirms the initial hypothesis that under normal circumstances, the damage the Breach does increases in strength by just over three percent each year. Not exactly the same number, but that makes sense.\"\n\n\"Explain your preconceptions.\" Eileen's voice was strained, but then it usually was when Wettle was in the room. Particularly when he made up such a large percentage of the people who were. Nascimbeni felt a weird sense of solidarity with her over it. \"Why does that make sense?\"\n\n\"Because this is a weird, goofy magical explosion.\" Wettle was still running his stubby fingers over the numbers. \"Of course it's not going to go like clockwork. But the general trend is solid. Three, three and a half percent extra damage every year. If this goes on too long, we're definitely fucked.\"\n\n\"But that isn't the worst of it.\" Veiksaar said this; Nascimbeni had tried to, but it had gotten stuck deep down in his throat.\n\n\"No.\" Wettle nodded. \"Because now that we've got three fucked-up Breaches to look at, we can confirm that they take out around //seven// percent of our available budget. Of one hundred percent.\"\n\n\"So that's all settled, then.\" Veiksaar glanced down at her calculator, and pressed the memory button once before continuing. \"If everything goes swimmingly in F-D each September from now on, every subject in containment at Site-43 will be decontained in sixteen years. 2027.\"\n\n\"Or if it goes //drowningly// each September,\" Wettle agreed, \"we've got an even, tidy eight.\"\n\n\"Except neither of those things are true,\" Nascimbeni rumbled.\n\nThey both turned to look at him.\n\n\"Because plenty of the stuff we've got contained will break out of containment well before efficiency hits zero.\" He collected his papers, and stood up. \"I'd say we're working with a range of, oh, six to ten years before SCP-5243 kills every single person at this facility.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/47-past-caring/DL_47_01_Nascimbeni_Containment.jpg]]\n\nIt wasn't going to be one of his better memories.\n\n[!-- [[=image Nascimbeni_Wettle_Veiksaar.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nHer eyes were half-lidded, and for a moment McInnis thought that Ilse Reynders was asleep. But no; she smiled when he approached the window, and as always, placed one palm against her side.\n\nHe reciprocated the gesture, as he always did. \"You're looking relaxed.\"\n\n\"I am.\" She exhaled, shuddering. Relief, pleasure, or both? \"I am //very// relaxed. It's stopped again.\"\n\nHe nodded, and looked down at his duty tablet. \"You've been telling such interesting stories.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Not so interesting, this time. More apocalyptic, though.\"\n\n\"The spiders were quite apocalyptic, I thought.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they didn't literally erase the entire world.\"\n\nIlse had been telling the baseline counterparts of Sampi-5243 all about the events of the alternate timeline, such as they were. They'd also witnessed her sharing stories of baseline itself with her fellow prisoners; there had been fierce debate among the Chairs and Chiefs about whether to tell her to stop doing that. Cross-contamination of information between baseline and the alternate lines was a sticky issue, and they'd eventually called in Alice Forth and Thaddeus Xyank for a consult.\n\nThe local timeline cops had said it was probably fine. It wasn't like they could actually stop Reynders from doing anything she wanted to do, short of killing her by breaking the glass, and there was no will either at Site-43 or Overwatch Command to do that. And demanding she keep mum would make the denizens of the alternate timelines suspicious, potentially leading to cross-contamination anyway when they realized they were living on a branch that would grow no farther than next September.\n\nThe multiversal timeline cops had said that they had standing orders not to intervene on any matters pertaining to Ilse Reynders, and had declined to explain why.\n\nA third timeline cop, with credentials that scanned and a name that appeared in no Foundation database McInnis could access -- Danica Azzopardi -- hadn't come with advice, but rather musings. \"You're already living in the corrected timeline,\" she'd said. \"Isn't that fun? You're able to perceive Dr. Reynders as spinning tall tales because the correction that won't be made, where she is, until September 8 has //already ontologically been made,// or else baseline wouldn't be able to exist to perceive it. We already know they're going to succeed. But we can't tell them that, because that would be a paradox. Or would it?\" Her enthusiasm had suddenly vanished, and then in a blink of an eye, so had she. \n\nOne hour before she arrived, two postdated messages to be opened one hour after she left reached McInnis from both the Department of Temporal Anomalies and the Temporal Anomalies Department, absolutely forbidding them from using Ilse Reynders to channel information to their alternate selves.\n\nWhich, really, was fine.\n\nWhat information did they even have to share?\n\n\"I take it the bad dreams have passed, then,\" McInnis said.\n\n\"The waking nightmares are over, yes. Again.\" This had happened twice already, as Wettle would be pleased to hear. After the alternate timelines were collapsed, Ilse stopped seeing them. This suggested the dying elseworlds were really and truly dead, which was... interesting, academically. The emotional import was something else entirely, and that was what McInnis had come here to discuss.\n\n\"I think it would be for the best if you didn't share that information with the others.\"\n\nShe raised a brow. \"Really. Why?\"\n\n\"It might be a cause of some distress to realize that everyone we interacted with for an entire calendar year has effectively died.\"\n\n\"Except it's one day later, and all your memories have switched over to the canon track. So...\"\n\n\"Nevertheless.\" McInnis struggled to find the words to explain what he meant, which wasn't how things usually went. But this was a philosophically, perhaps even theologically sticky matter. \"I believe, in some sense, that the experiences of the dead timelines--\"\n\n\"Let's call them deadlines,\" she suggested.\n\nHe nodded. \"The experiences of the //deadlines// are effecting change on my personnel. Something of the years they spend outside the natural course of reality...\" He spread his hands, as though reaching out for the proper words. \"...clings,\" he finished. It was close enough.\n\nIlse nodded, lips funneling into an expression of open pondering. \"Interesting. And why do you think that?\"\n\n\"Because Harry didn't remember to mention his renewed interest in teaching at the debriefing, and he didn't write it down, and no-one else raised the subject, and yet this morning before his shift he applied to teach a course at Falconer University.\"\n\nThe funnel became a full-on purse. \"Not fully dead lines, then, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. But if not fully dead, then... what?\"\n\nShe canted her head, and those half-lidded eyes shut fully before snapping back open again. \"Converging?\" she suggested.\n\n[!-- [[=image Reynders_Silhouettes.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 15 September\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|**Grand Cove##: Grand Bend, Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nShe put on her glasses--\n\n--and saw it in an instant.

She saw it, and she saw through it, and what she saw through it was not her darkened living room where no light entered through the thick black shades and no light was cast by the ceiling fixture or the lamp on her coffee table, because she'd taken all the bulbs out, and therefore there could be no reflections, and therefore the silhouette could not actually be there, but it was, and through it she could see the past. \n\nAll of it.

Tactical Theology had taken the matter up with Overwatch Command, which had consulted the two temporal departments, and after a few more years of waiting and seeing, a decision was made and kicked all the way back down to Udo Okorie.\n\nShe could, was in fact directed to, explain her encounters with Corbin's so-called semigods in detail.\n\nShe wasn't sure why it had to be her, outside of the fact that she was a thaumaturge. Blank was the storyteller. Lillian was the theorist. McInnis was their leader, both in the provisional taskforce and Site-wide. But the directive, like Corbin, had targeted her directly, and so here they were.\n\n\"What you're saying,\" the wiry theologian mused as she chewed on the end of her pencil, \"is that there's consistency between iterations.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't do that.\"\n\nCorbin blinked. \"Do what?\"\n\n\"Chew your eraser. Wettle did in the last deadline, and he ended up swallowing rubber.\"\n\nThe other woman raised her eyebrows without opening her eyes an iota wider.\n\n\"What? You wanted privileged extrauniversal information, and I'm obliging.\"\n\nCorbin set put the pencil down. She already had a full page of notes, just from their awkward five minutes of discussion. \"Why are you so opposed to talking about this?\"\n\n\"Because I don't have anything to tell you. That's why they assigned //me// to do it.\"\n\nThis time the lids crept up toward the brows. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nUdo leaned forward. \"Brenda, I didn't see Wirth in the last timeline. All I know is what Allan told me, and Allan didn't tell anyone much, and what Lillian explained to me, and for all her genius and bluster, Lillian was only guessing. So, yeah. It seems like Wirth could control minds in the two deadlines we saw him in -- only we never saw him at //all// in the first one, and only Allan saw him in the second one. That doesn't qualify as data. It's hearsay.\"\n\n\"Hearsay //is// data in theological matters.\" Corbin grinned. \"Have you ever actually read the Bible? It's wall to wall 'trust me on this'. A comprehensive record of all the things somebody might have heard a burning bush talk about. It all gets compiled, and then the editors come in to sort the hearsay that tracks with the hearsay that doesn't, and they reconfigure the latter as //heresy.//\"\n\nUdo rolled her eyes. \"They're blowing you off, Brenda. Giving you access to me is their way of placating TactTheo without giving away the gritty details of what's actually going on.\"\n\nAll the mirth disappeared from Corbin's face. \"You think this is about me? What's it say about you?\"\n\nUdo frowned. \"What?\"\n\n\"Maybe your time isn't worth as much as McInnis' or Lillihammer's.\"\n\nUdo shrugged. \"I mean, it isn't. That's a Site Director and a Section Chair you're talking about.\"\n\nCorbin picked up the pencil again, and began expertly twiddling it through her fingers. It was kind of hypnotic. \"That doesn't bother you? Being low on the totem pole?\"\n\n\"Low, but not the bottom.\"\n\n\"Who's the bottom, then?\"\n\nA moment passed, and they both answered the question at once. \"Wettle.\"\n\nCorbin laughed. \"Fair.\"\n\n\"It doesn't bother //you?//\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Never getting the answers you're looking for. They consult you on the nature of these things, and then they go away and reach conclusions you never get to hear about.\"\n\n\"I think of it as assembling an automobile.\" There was something disingenuous about Corbin's tone, now. \"Everyone supplies one piece, one weld, one step of the process. It's a group thing.\"\n\n\"That sounds... not true. At all.\"\n\nCorbin shrugged. \"Maybe I've just made peace with the fact that I don't get to know how this ends.

The same silhouette. Her living room was still dark, though she'd left the curtains open; she'd waited until the evening, fortified with a glass of wine, to try again. She could take it this time. It'd been a month.\n\nShe still couldn't take it. She //could// focus on the images, if she tried, and she wondered if that was because she was simply replaying an old memory, and the tapes in her head were winding down, running slower. She zeroed in, and saw herself sitting on the edge of her bed, crying up a storm. She was eight years old, and holding the wallet her mother had bought her for her seventh birthday. She kept pennies in it. She bought candy with the pennies, for herself, for all her friends. And for no reason she could adequately explain -- not that she would ever speak a word of this to anyone -- she went along with her friend Christina's scheme to put the pennies on the tracks down the road and test a theory that it would derail the train.\n\nShe stayed up all that night, horrified, petrified, thinking that she might have done something unforgivable for no better reason than because one of her friends had told her to. Her mother wouldn't understand. Her father wouldn't understand. They always told her to get her head out of the clouds, focus on what was happening in front of her, realize the consequences of her actions. And now she'd derailed a train, probably.\n\nThat wasn't the night that she saw, through the reflection in her glasses that wasn't there. She saw the next night, when the news filtered into her house through dad's old transistor radio that a homeless man was run down on the tracks in the early morning, run down by the late-running midnight special. Nobody knew what he was doing on the tracks.\n\nShe was holding the empty wallet, and she knew. The droids were staring up, tilted back as though in shock, trying to get farther away from her.\n\nBecause she was a murderer, at eight years old.\n\nHer eyes blurred again, and it got harder to focus, and the things she saw next all in a rush were so terrible that she didn't even notice for several minutes that the act of clawing the glasses off her face coincided with the act of tearing a deep gash in her forehead with one long fingernail. She didn't notice this until she started to see red.\n\nShe'd loved that wallet. Her mother had known that she loved it. Her mother had bought it for her because she knew she'd love it, because she loved her.\n\nA murderer.\n\nShe'd put it in a dresser drawer that night, and never took it out again. When her mother found it there, years later, helping to clean her room, she'd said \"So that's where that went. I thought you liked this one.\"\n\nShe could see that without the glasses, in her mind's eye. She could hear the inscrutable tone of her mother's voice. She could remember the confusion of guilt.\n\nShe waited until her eye started to sting before getting up.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 19 October\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nKoda Anoki placed both hands on the manila folder in front of him.

The big screen on the north wall kept flipping back and forth between the local New Year's Eve programming and the big ball countdown in New York, as whoever had the remote kept hoping against hope that Toronto would put on some decent music or the presenters might say something interesting. By eleven thirty, patriotism be damned, Anderson Cooper had won out.\n\nThere was cheering, hand shaking, back slapping and a little overdramatic snogging when the hour finally struck, and the compressed crowd proceeded to split in twain. Half of everybody started making their excuses and heading out, while the other half settled into the task of poisoning their bloodstreams in earnest. When there was enough space to move, little cliques formed. When a few of those dispersed, there was dancing. Harry found himself at the bar, spiked tomato juice in hand, and he didn't notice who else was there until the final phase began: just him and the rest of the dregs with nowhere better to go, propped up by their stools and not a lot else.\n\nUdo yawned, breaking the silence that had rushed in to fill the space between them when technician third class Jessie MacCrum had stumbled off to use the washroom and never returned. He glanced at her, and she glanced back blearily. She blinked. She looked him up and down, and said: \"You mess up alright.\"\n\nIt took him a moment to make the connection, recognize the reference. He glanced down at his rumpled sweater, his track pants, and even the hairs of a beard that projected far enough forward he could see it past his nose, and grunted. \"I'm always messed up.

The first result she'd gotten was a cease and desist order from TAD, which arrived in her inbox the instant she sent out the email. TAD was going to do its own investigation first, armed with Ngo's debriefing reports, and they'd get back to her when that was over and done with.\n\nIt had apparently taken them five months to achieve this goal.\n\nBut now here she was, standing at the base of a hideous square office building on a hill surrounded by forests in rural Wisconsin, waiting for the man with the ridiculous name to come trotting out for their lunch date. When the sliding doors slid open and he appeared, her first thought was //he looks like he should work at 43.//\n\nPlaceholder McDoctorate was statuesque -- Classical Greek, specifically -- with a very full head of curly hair. He looked like the movie version of himself. He saw her sitting at the picnic table near the path to the parking lot, and jogged over. \"Hey!\"\n\nShe raised a hand in greeting.\n\n\"Nice to finally meet you.\" He slid onto the bench seat across from her. \"Heard so much about.\"\n\nShe raised a brow.\n\n\"Meaning,\" he stammered, \"uh, that the TAD... they talked a lot about... well.\" He drummed the tabletop. \"Told me what you guys had been up to. Out there.\" He waved vaguely.\n\nShe raised the other brow. \"The TAD shared confidential timeline information with you?\"\n\nHe almost looked offended. \"Chief, I have Level 4 clearance. I used to be Director of Site-15.\"\n\n\"That wasn't in your file.\"\n\n\"It is, actually.\" He sighed. \"You just can't remember reading it.\"\n\nHer brows wouldn't go any higher.\n\nHe gripped the tabletop. \"But let's not talk about me. Let's talk about you. And me. What do I have to do with you? It's been years since I was involved in anything important enough for Department heads to come calling, and it's been over a decade since the TAD bothered with me.\"\n\n\"Sounds like you already know.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No. They showed me the L4 version of your file, 5243, and then audited all my activities since 2002, and asked me about correlations. Had I ever had administrative aspirations? I had not, beyond the obvious. Had I ever considered branching out to arachnology? I //absolutely// had not. Had I ever been involved in high technology? Obviously yes, and I refamiliarized them with that, but it apparently wasn't what they were looking for. Then they asked me about time travel and dimensional shifts, and I had to explain to them that the only dimensions I'm interested in these days are narrative.\"\n\nShe wrinkled her nose. The first time she'd heard about pataphysics, only the vaguest of superficial descriptions, she'd resolved to look no deeper. It sounded uniquely capable of both driving her to drink, and driving her nuts. It had something to do with the anomalous fiction (she didn't like fiction) and/or anomalous means of interacting with fiction (even worse) and/or the possibility that the real world was responsive to the 'laws' of fiction (potentially the worst thing possible). She was determined that no matter how this conversation went, it would not involve this man's area of specialty. \n\nExcept so far as it could explain what the hell was going on with his name.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about pataphysics,\" she told him. \"I want to know why you showed up in every dead timeline, changed maybe one or two details, then fucked off again.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"That's the most directly I've heard it stated. You're sure it was me?\"\n\n\"No. I can't picture the guy at all, and you're plenty memorable.\" It couldn't have been the heat that was making him blush. Not in grey February. \"But Allan, the Director, brought up a mysterious figure in his 2004 debrief whose name and face he couldn't remember, but he //could// remember a tag on the guy's uniform that said 'PHMD'.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\n\"And that guy helped us refound the Foundation, apparently, although none of the rest of us ever even saw him.

You were helping to reverse-engineer a world-altering machine created by a dead god.\"\n\nThe pataphysicist's memorable face was squirming and contorting. He finally managed: \"Perfect detail? I thought this figure was supposed to be antimemetic?\"\n\n\"Sure. But Lillian's got eidetic memory.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't help.\"\n\n\"Better than eidetic, then. Perfect. Invincible.

I wonder if--\"\n\n\"So what I want to know from //you,//\" and she leaned far forward to grab his hands and press them to the rough tabletop, \"is why you'd be a dimension-hopping dilettante while the rest of us are trying to keep the entire world from falling apart.\"\n\nHe winced, and tried to withdraw his hands without success. \"I don't know. I told you, I'm not into dimensional studies or time travel or anything like that. All I do now is pataphysics. I don't even do computers anymore, except where those fields intersect.\"\n\nShe pressed harder. \"If you had to imagine a motive, something that would make you want to do this, what would it be?\"\n\nHe tried to shrug, but lacked the leverage on his own arms now. \"I don't know. Curiosity? It sounds like... could you loosen up, please? I'm not going anywhere.\" She released the pressure, and he winced before continuing. \"It sounds like whoever this is, is looking for the most interesting things going on in each timeline. A new Foundation. Whatever that spider thing was. Your god-machine.\"\n\n\"But he wasn't just looking. He was poking and prodding.\"\n\n\"Maybe, I don't know...\" He looked up at the treeline, then back down at her suddenly. \"It might be pataphysics.\"\n\nShe tightened her grip again. \"It is //not// pataphysics.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/47-past-caring/DL_47_07_Placeholder_Confused.jpg]]\n\nHe yanked his hands back, yelped, and pulled a splinter out of one palm. \"But it might be.

Nobody else at the Site had blue eyes that could widen that far. \"She was the reason we made the Frontispiece in the first place.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\nThe other woman's gaze was strong and steady. She didn't have to work hard to draw out the memories. Her brain hadn't aged an iota since those memories had first been formed. \"She had a grudge against the Foundation, and she used the Cold War to destroy us. Turned every developed nation against us, one by one. Strangled our operations, globally. Even assassinated an Overseer. Got us tossed out of Russia -- you ought to ask Sokolsky about that.\"\n\nIbanez made a mental note, and nodded.\n\n\"She made it impossible for us to keep doing the Work.\" A select few of Director Scout's old cadre still said that word like it meant something special, the way a Christian might name their God. Reverence. \"People were afraid to leave their facilities. National security forces were circulating lists of our personnel, arrest or shoot on sight. Diplomatic talks with Groups of Interest broke down. Our front companies were all liquidated, nationalized or bankrupted. That one woman nearly managed to take the whole Foundation down in a matter of months.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"She was a //giftschreiber.//\"\n\n\"Okay, sure, but //how?// Where did she get the intel? The materiel? Boots on the ground? How did one woman wage a war against the planetary shadow government?\"\n\nReynders shrugged. \"We never knew. It was apparent that some of the cult was on her side, maybe all of it. //Giftschreiber// are anarchists, and they don't often work together -- or at least, not well -- but she must have had a small army to achieve what she did.\"\n\nIbanez nodded. \"The Chaos Insurgency.\"\n\nThose bright blue eyes blinked, twice. \"What?\"\n\n\"The Chaos Insurgency. She had the Chaos Insurgency. She was there, in Zevala, when they destroyed my village. I think she was in charge of them.\"\n\nReynders whistled. It came out curiously flat, whether naturally or thanks to the equipment transmitting sound to Ibanez's side of the glass. \"That's a new one on me. Why haven't I heard it before?\"\n\n\"Because I told Scout everything I knew, and a few years later I told Allan, and apparently neither of them thought it was worth making the connection for me, so nobody's done anything with this information in almost twenty fucking years.\" She was fuming, and she let it happen. Better to get it out now than to leave it bottled up.\n\nReynders was shaking her head. \"I suppose it makes sense, but we've never suspected a connection like that before. Crocker always preferred organized chaos. Chaos to a //plan.// The Insurgency, they're practically a randomizing factor. I don't see how the one works with the other. And to what end? What was so special about your village? No offence intended.\"\n\nIbanez ran a finger along the sill, careful not to disturb the grouting. \"There was... a facility. I don't know much about it. But I spent a long, long time cooped up in there.\"\n\n\"One relates.\" Reynders' voice was very soft.\n\nIbanez ignored it. \"A long, long, //long// time. Longer for me, inside, than it was for them. Outside.\"\n\n\"You mean time dilation?\"\n\nIbanez nodded.\n\n\"How much time dilation?\"\n\nIbanez smiled. \"I don't remember. They'd just started working out targeted amnestics when they picked me up -- us, I mean, the Foundation -- and they were very selective about what I was allowed to keep knowing. All I can tell you now is that there was some sort of R&D Site in my village, and it let me do in one day what should have taken me a year.\"\n\n\"Meaning what? What did you do?\"\n\n\"I invented myself.\"\n\nShe let the silence hang until the other woman broke it.\n\n\"I assume you think Crocker is still alive.\"\n\n\"I've got reason to believe.\"\n\n\"So, you're going to try to find her.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And stop whatever she's doing.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Even though you now have reason to believe she's at the head of //two// death cults, instead of just one.\"\n\nIbanez grinned. \"The great thing about death cults,\" she said through gritted teeth, \"is that nobody much complains when you fucking kill them all.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image Ibanez_Reynders.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 26 January\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nFar across the Site from where they sat, the DUAL Core was humming up a storm and Xinyi Du was fussing over it, his entire staff mustered for monitoring and maintenance.

It was the smell of something filthy having happened, then been cleaned up so efficiently that the space ended up tidier than it had been before. It was the smell of failed biology covered up with alcohol and bleach.\n\nThe car had smelled only slightly less antiseptic. The charter plane that had brought them here from Canada was similar. The brief burst of actual fresh Florida air had been bracing, a rare unfamiliarity in the grey of her existence, and she knew that if her mother could have connected the two vehicles with an airtight umbilical, she would have. Billie's shoulders still ached from the antiviral injections she'd been forced to endure to come along on this little trip.\n\nShe was starting to think they hadn't been worth it.\n\n\"I spoke to Van Rompay,\" her mother was telling the withered little wheelchair-bound woman. \"He wanted me to tell you he's doing well.\"\n\nÉmilie LeClair blinked up at them both. Her eyes looked very small without the eyeshadow and eyeliner, and they were unfocused. \"Gedeon? Gedeon was just here.\"\n\nBillie's mother smiled and nodded encouragingly. \"Well, he just wanted you to know, anyhow.\"\n\nLeClair made eye contact with Billie. Billie looked away, at the neatly-made bed and neatly-folded laundry and neatly-vacuumed carpet, wondering what it must be like for everything around you to be fiddled with by other people, to not have anything of your own that was exempt from outside interference. LeClair kept staring at her, nevertheless, and said: \"She thinks I'm making it up.\"\n\nBillie looked back at the old woman. \"I think you're making it up, too.\"\n\n\"Billie.\" Her mother's tone was dangerous.\n\nLeClair laughed, her brittle bones shaking with the effort. \"Good girl. Don't take any shit from this one.\" She pointed up at Billie's mother. \"She's after my job.\"\n\nHelena Forsythe looked pained. \"Em...\"\n\nLeClair waved her off. \"I know. I know. I'm in Florida. I'm in a home. You put me in a home. Not that I blame you!\" She reached down and pushed her wheelchair forward, and both Billie and her mother stumbled aside to let her pass. \"I would have done the same. I //should// have done the same. Maybe I was going to, but I forgot.

Come and help me with this, ah...\" She looked back at Billie, and snapped her fingers as though trying to light a spark. \"Ah... come help me with this, child.\"\n\nBillie decided not to protest the phrasing. She knelt down and lifted the lid on the trunk. It wasn't very heavy. Inside there were papers, scattered old articles of fancy dress, a few framed photographs, the usual detritus of extreme old age or extreme unhealth. She looked up at the old doctor. \"What're you looking for?\"\n\n\"There's something I want you to have.\"\n\nBillie looked down at the trunk again, then back up. \"What is it?\"\n\nLeClair leaned down, rummaged around a bit, then sat back up with a look of confusion on her face. \"It's... it isn't here.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" Billie pressed.\n\nLeClair waved her off again. \"It doesn't matter. It isn't there. Close the lid.\"\n\nBillie closed the lid, and was about to ask again what LeClair had wanted to give her when she saw that the old woman was crying.

Almost every aspect of this facility's unlikely functionality is made possible, at times simple or even inevitable, by a series of factors which can be, and have been in the preceding pages, explicated in precise detail. How there came to be enough space to build such a massive complex at such an unmanageable depth. Where the raw materials came from. Whence the heat, and the water, and the air. How anyone even knew to look for such a place in the first place. All of it tidily, conveniently compassable.\n\nThat, in the final analysis, is the only unexplained anomaly in the environs of Lake Huron.\n\nWhy does Site-43 seem to sit in a naturally-occuring Site-43-shaped hole?\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe sent the excerpt, and waited.\n\nThe answer came almost immediately.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**M_Bradbury**\nThese feel like the topic paragraphs for a conclusion.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**M_Bradbury**\nAre you finally finishing this thing?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**H_Blank**\nI think I am.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**H_Blank**\nFinally stumbled on my thesis.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**M_Bradbury**\nTook you long enough.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**H_Blank**\nWell, you know me.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**H_Blank**\nIt's my pattern.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe waited for another response, but none came.
