It is heart-shaped. Trace remnants of pigment remain on the object's face, with dry streaks trailing down from the eyes.  Forehead markings indicate the absence of a headdress. A fractured collar and earspool remain.\n\nAt time of discovery, accession records matching object's appearance were present within 73% of all museums in the global north. Anomalous interference presumed due to timeline improbabilities. All records erased without issue.\n\n**Discovery:** Acquisition records lost or nonexistent. See up to date provenance below.\n[[div style=\"border:dashed;border-color:rgb(240,240,255);background:rgb(248,248,255);padding: 0 10px 0;margin:0 10% 0\"]]\nMexico. Date unknown.
