To minimize risk of a Hubris Event, watering and other maintenance operations of the trees are to be carried out through automated systems. \n\n**Description:** SCP-2618-J is a banana cultivar that originated from the former French colony of █████ ██████████. In its appearance and genetic makeup, SCP-2618-J is indistinguishable from the common Cavendish banana. \n\nSCP-2618-J's anomalous effects surface when a human subject makes visual contact with an individual SCP-2618-J fruit. The subject will invariably perceive the banana to be an item the subject needs to accomplish a future or pre-existing goal. This has been designated a \"Hubris Event\". \n\nThe perception can only be broken through the following means:\n# A different human subject will remind the affected subject that SCP-2618-J is a banana.\n# The affected subject attempts to use SCP-2618-J as they had originally intended.\n\nSCP-2618-J first came to the attention of the Foundation after a failed assassination attempt of United States Senator ████████ ███ on 12/20/██. A radical animal rights activist named Kevin Jarvis had charged the stage at a campaign rally and attempted to shoot the senator point-blank, only to discover that his pistol was actually an instance of SCP-2618-J. While major news outlets gave a cover story of the attack being an unusual prank, a 40-page manifesto was discovered in Mr. Jarvis's apartment detailing his desire to assassinate the Senator in retaliation for his alleged track record of animal cruelty.\n\n**Addendum - Incident 2618-J-████:** On 4/19/██, during the initial containment efforts of SCP-2618-J, Site-59 experienced multiple containment breaches by SCP-████, a Keter-class amphibian entity. After several unintentional Hubris Events on the part of security staff, SCP-████ has been designated uncontained and reclamation efforts are underway.\n\n> **Incident 2618-J-████, Hubris Event 2:**\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> [Dr. Naismith is giving Dr. Collins CPR]\n> \n> **Dr. Naismith:** It's not working - I think the ████ venom's in his system. He needs a defibrillator.\n> \n> **Sgt. █████:** Already got one. Open his shirt.\n> \n> [Dr. Naismith opens Dr. Collins's shirt]\n> \n> **Sgt. █████:** Charging. Keep at the pumping.\n> \n> **Dr. Naismith:** That's not a defibrillator.\n> \n> [Sgt. █████ notices that he is holding two instances of SCP-2618-J. Five seconds of radio silence]\n> \n> **Sgt. █████:** Let's never speak of this again.\n> \n> <End Log>\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 4/2618-J Clearance Required\" hide=\"- 'YES, WE HAVE NO CREDENTIALS' credentials accepted\"]]\nSCP-2618-J has been declared uncontained as of 4/22/██, when the automated watering and maintenance systems were revealed to have been independent instances of SCP-2618-J all along. The five SCP-2618-J trees were never brought to Site-59 from their original plantation in █████ ██████████, as the recovered trees were also instances of SCP-2618-J all along. \n\nFinal containment efforts of SCP-2618-J are to be carried out via autonomous drones as soon as possible. Should the drones return with independent SCP-2618-J instances rather than the actual trees, Contingency Fuqqdithshet-Alpha is to be enacted as soon as possible.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
