Rumbling and the chill of air conditioning, dry and cold.\n\nThat’s right, they were taking her to her new home in this van with all the strange lights. She forgot exactly how long they told her to sleep, but the drool pooling at the sides of her lips and the ache of her muscles told her she didn’t sleep nearly long enough. \n\nIt was hard to settle back into reality without the buzzing, but it used to be normal. Her father told her once about a salamander that forced your eyes open when you were sleeping while it ate your dreams and when you woke up you would be bald. He always laughed about it, but it kept her checking her pillow at night instead of sleeping. Now she’d give anything to be able to sleep for as long as she could each day. Maybe one of these days she’d wake up and be back in her room.                                        \n,,//##E8E9E8|Zena! Don’t play games with me, you’ve been in there for hours!##//,,\n\nThis whole thing was scary, but thinking about ever being like that with her family watching again was much more terrifying.\n\n“Is that 2599? Already?” She had barely moved her head before she heard Wensley’s voice.\n\n“Why don’t you put her back to sleep doc? I’ll tuck her in this time, for you.” Lyla sat across from her reading a book like the one Karl gave her. Maybe it was more info on ontokinology or Facility 120. Even if it was, there was no way Ms. Lyla was going to let her read it.\n\n“It doesn’t work that way and you know it. This hasn’t been fun for any of us.” He began to mutter to himself, burying his face in his palm.\n\n“Ok 2599, we will be arriving in the next 4 hours. Can you be quiet and still until then?”\n\n“Yes sir.” \n\n“Just yes is fine…please.”\n\nAnother thing she had accepted was apparently digital clocks, or any for that matter, weren’t common here. The foundation seemed to know the time all the time. She had tried to keep track herself but she found it hard to concentrate these days.\n\nLyla sucked her teeth as she flipped a page.\n\nZena had enough thoughts to distract herself with.  Like what she would look like in ten years. Her mother wanted her to be smart and make a lot of money, her dad wanted her to put something good into the world. So she was already set on supporting the family as a chemist. In the daylight.\n\nIn moonlight she wanted to be a secret agent. She knew some of the people who worked for her parent’s were government agents. At least that’s what Jun told her. They went on all sorts of missions going into dangerous places to save sick people and stop bad guys. She had always wanted to believe those stories and now she knew they had to be true. Those were the only times she could remember when he wasn’t such a fathead.\n\nDr. Wensley, was still muttering while flipping through the pages in his binder. She couldn’t see the driver’s face but she had a feeling he was annoyed by it. She wasn’t the only one who wished they could sleep. \n\n“…a mistake.” He said it again. He was saying it before they even began the trip.\n\nShe wished she could gaze out the window and see what kind of places they were passing. There were no windows in the van, just an array of bright lights that looked like TV static. She wondered if they could actually play a show, but she remembered one of the first things they said she couldn’t do was watch TV. She couldn’t wait to be rid of this stupid anomaly. \n\nShe stared in the sparkling static gateway, tracing images in the display with her finger. The bunny was the easiest to see hopping along the trail, the face of a fox was next to stare back at her curiously. It was as she trailed the neck of a swan she was startled by Ms. Lyla slapping her arm down.\n\n“Keep your hands in. It's not playtime!”\n\nDr. Wensley stared back at the two of them. It was embarrassing, usually it was Joon sitting here. It’s not like she wasn’t taking this seriously. She had nothing to do for the next four hours. Still she knew better.\n\n“Sorry.”\n\n“Look, it’s not that we don’t trust you, 2599, it’s just that this is an important transition and can’t afford anything to go wrong here. At all. We were lucky they even picked you.”\n\n“Karl asked me to.”\n\n“Of course! Of course. Aktus has an eye on him, even in his old age. Quite…the veteran.” Each word spilled out of his throat.\n\n“He never did let on how he managed to cont- guide you on your anomaly. I wish I could have his magic touch. To have prepared you better, of course.”\n\n“If you need me here Dr. Wensley...”\n\n“No! I think this is best. For everyone. Really. I’m...let’s just get this over with.” \n\nMs. Lyla sucked her teeth and went back to her book.\n\n“This may be a good time to bring out the chimp. I don’t think talking is going to make this ride any more comfortable for any of us.” The soldier in the back spoke. His name was Mert…or was it Mort? Mert.\n\n“Agreed! Lyla.”\n\nLyla grunted as she took a small box from Mert. She slipped her fingers inside quickly and pulled out a black ball on a key chain. She fastened it to a hook and hung it from a light, leaving it to dangle right in front of her face. Every five seconds she’d see the capsule’s prisoner, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-894 an odd monkey-styled figurine], like some arcade prize.\n\nBeing treated like a baby again. She looked at the mocking monkey holding its ears to its head, mouth stretched open like an idiot.\n\nEverything about this was embarrassing. She tried not to let the humiliation make her regret her choice.\n\nChoice. That was funny.\n\nShe sneezed and noticed the sound was gone. Another oddly familiar feeling. But it was the closest thing to sleep she could get now. \n\nShe felt a tap on her shoulder. Mert offered to wipe her snot covered face with a tissue. This was going to be a long ride. It had to have been a while since she woke up right? Like maybe thirty minutes?\n\nOne…\n\nTwo…\n\nThree…\n\nSeconds were longer than she thought. Imagining ten years at this rate...No way! She had to be better than that. She had to rub it in Joon’s face she became a secret agent first.\nShe tried not to get her expectations high like Dr. Jora said.\n\nFour…no where was she? The van stopped before she could align her time. Were they here already? \n\nDr. Wensley opened the van door. He then stared at Ms. Lyla. \n\n“Make hershey dozen moo, please.”\n\nThe door shut and the monkey danced. Lyla muttered something as she flipped off the door. She shifted her position to stare directly at Zena. The tension with her and the two guards became thick.\n\nOne…\n\nTwo…\n\nThree…\n\nFour…\n\nFive…\n\nSix…\n\nSeven…\n\nEight…\n\nMs. Lyla was still on her vigil.\n\nFourteen…\n\nFifteen…\n\n“Go have your boat if you want. She wasn’t me my light.” No, sight? It was so fast and loud. She felt the words rattle her. Why was she angry already?\n\nTwenty four…\n\nTwenty five…\n\nTwenty six…\n\nTwenty-\n\n“The only thing I eat is to heap the little high go in check!”\n\n…Thi-thirty uhm.\n\n“I HATE EDDY IT GO! WHAT’S WRONG WITH EVERYONE?” \n\n오십일 오십이 오십삼 오십사 오십오 오십육 오십칠 오십팔 오십구 육 십 육 십-\n\n“We’re supposed to eat these bunkers…”\n\nFive six seven eight nine 칠 십 one two three for five six seven eight nine 팔십 one wait are they leaving?\n\nShe only caught the briefest glimpse of green and blue before they closed the door behind them.  There was still a rumbling even though the car had stopped. At least she knew it was still early.\n\nThere was more than one reason to feel relieved now.\n\nShe slunk in her seat staring at the monkey playing peekaboo from it’s cell. The more she looked at it the more she realized it was actually kind of cute. It was also her only company now. Better company.\n\n'Wanna help me count Heol?' \n\nA soundless question met a wordless reply.  \n\nShe took down his hanging prison and placed it on her leg. Every time she passed sixty seconds she would turn Heol trying to imagine a clock beneath him. After six minutes, she found her eyes got heavy. Maybe it was the realization of how ridiculous she was being. Maybe it was because of how long the drive was.\n\nWhere could they be? It was probably just another office building, but maybe this one had a lab she could work in too. As if they’d let her. She could probably manage a peak, but Ms. Lyla was on the other side of that door. The ride felt a bit bumpy, maybe they were off-road at some old cave. Seemed like somewhere a secret organization would meet. \n\nWhat if they were going to sell her? No her parents wouldn’t leave her with people like that, especially while she was sick. No. This was probably another test. A test of patience. She chuckled thinking about them making her meditate under a waterfall. It seemed silly but all of this felt so…how did dad put it? Surreal.\n\nShe took in a breath and gagged. Maybe she was just parched but she could feel the moisture in the air on her dry throat. After a few coughs she let it settle in her lungs. It had been a while. She walked down a path of moss and stone towards the waterfall noticing a group of people there.\n\nThe man had messy hair and a short scrappy beard, he wore the company logo on his clothes. The tall lady next to him didn’t seem to like him much. She was pretty enough to be a movie star, looking the full part of a secret agent. Maybe this was all just a movie set. Even Wensley was there, upset as usual. Of course he would be, arguing for her sake always made mom exhausted too.  They began walking along the path towards where she stood. Wait.\n\n“2599!”\n\nAs Dr. Wensley approached she felt a hand practically rip her shoulder off, the cigarette falling out of her mouth and burning her a bit. Mert approached quickly as well, flushing and hunched over. \n\nShe couldn’t hear,  but she knew the way Dr. Wensley moved when he was angry. The Actress was even angrier, luckily her anger was at him.\n\nBut now they were all arguing. Ms. Lyla’s grip got tighter as Wensley seemed to go in on her. The Actress pushed a paper she had been holding into Dr. Wensley’s chest before pointing to her in outrage.\n\n삼박육, 삼 박 육 일, 삼 박 육 …\n\nShe was approaching Zena now. With the roar of the waterfall still shaking her body, it was like facing a storm front. Ms. Lyla loosened her grip and shoved her forward as an offering. \n\nThe Actress began her code. Zena felt like she was supposed to get some kind of message but she didn’t know it yet. Did she miss that part? She moved so fast. She finished her spell. Everyone was staring waiting for her response. Wensley tried not to make eye contact.\n\nShe couldn’t afford to mess up already. She copied the woman’s motions as best as she could feeling like she would spit out a fireball when she was done.\n\nThe woman slapped her own face before shouting at Wensley. Wensley barked back pulling out another piece of paper from the bag he had been carrying. The Actress took the paper and examined it thoroughly, taking glances at her as she did.\n\nThis was it. If this woman was the boss…then she failed already. Dr. Wensley was right.\n\nThe shaggy beard said something and Mert laughed. Everyone was making fun of her now.\n \nThen The Actress knelt down to her level.\n\n…hair?\n\n“No!” She pulled back wrestling with the fingers in her curls.\nBefore she knew it the woman was dragging her along by the hand. \n\nThey stopped in front of the falls, she could feel the winds pushing against her and splashes smacking her face. She was reintroduced to sound by the booms of the waterfall.\n\n“…quite shit with ankle biters.\"\n\nWho was that?\n\n“ I don’t care what he says, it’s clear he’s ok giving me his failed experiment. I’m taking care of this.”\n\nWhat did she do? Who-\n\n“Go unconscious for 6 hours.”\n\n^^##fffafa|I don't understand^^##\n\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-m-gonna-be-alright/offset/5|what did I do?]]]\n[[/>]]",
