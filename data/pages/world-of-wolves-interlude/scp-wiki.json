Hah. You certainly seem to be getting// desperate, //aren’t you?//\n\n“//**Certainly not,**// Great Death.” This was through gritted teeth, now; if there was one thing the diplomat hated above all else, it was being seen as desperate.\n\n//Hmhrmhmhm, sure, sure.//\n\nThe monolith straightened out, its pointed creat gleaming like the stern of a battleship.\n\n//Planet of Skin, seventeen, exhaustion.//\n\n//Total five-thousand, five-hundred, and one.//\n\n//I assume you know, though, that this is a tall ask of us.//\n\n“Of course we understand that, Great Death. We are not //fools//.” \n\nThe diplomat regains his calm, neutral demeanor.\n\n“The Haven simply wants reassurance that your support in this endeavor remains absolute, as you promised.”\n\nThe giant chuckles again, more of a supply train’s steady churning this time.\n\n//Hrm-hm! Is// that //what you want to frame this as, then?//\n\nThe diplomat tenses again, silently yet obviously seething.\n\n“It is the //truth,// Great Death.”\n\n//Hrm, yes, of course.//\n\nThe colossus stretches their arms, the sound of rending steel nearly deafening in intensity.\n\n//Well. I suppose that we could partake in another bargain of sorts, considering your society’s stature in the grand schemes of those above even ourselves.//\n\nAt this, the diplomat leans forwards, an uncharacteristic grin spread across their face, in a display of glee comparable to a child being praised for their talent.\n\n“You suppose, Great Death?”\n\n//Of course.//\n\n//Provided you are accepting of the terms.//\n\nThe diplomat’s expression falters, for a moment, before reorganizing into a facade of understanding.\n\n“Right, yes, the terms. I am certain the Haven would be willing to-“\n\n//Two-thousand of your own, every month, for the rest of the Haven’s existence.//\n\nThe monolith leans back once more, watching as the diplomat fumbles for a response, his mouth open in combined shock, indignation, and confusion.\n\n“…B- But, Great Death, you already receive millions of sacrifices from us each day, what-”\n\n//Planet of Eyes, sixteen, starvation.//\n\n//Total five-thousand, five-hundred, and seventeen.//\n\n//Well, I must mean something// else, //then, would I not, hrm?//\n\nThe diplomat momentarily sputters, before his face shifts in horrified realization.\n\n“But such- such a large number of our own kin! We would surely collapse in a decade on those terms, you-“ \n\n//Planet of Teeth, thirty-seven, blood loss.//\n\n//Total five-thousand, five hundred, and fifty-four.//\n\n//That seems a bit dramatic.//\n\n“I-“ the diplomat exhales in a fruitless attempt at composure. “The Haven would be willing to accept a- a lesser number, or a greater timespan, perhaps, but these terms as they are //cannot stand,// and you-“\n\n//Planet of-//\n\n//**“STOP MOCKING US!”**//\n\nThe diplomat clamps a hand over his mouth as the room shakes from an impact unseen, and the fireplace begins belching forth an abnormal quantity of acrid, sulfuric smoke.\n\nThe negotiations room begins blurring at the edges, as if the world’s own vision is fading, and the air starts to grow cloudy with gray clouds of dust, or ash, or pulverized rubble.\n\nThe view from the window is now one of carnage, as blooms of white & orange tear holes in the sides of the formerly grand & prideful cityscape, set against the backdrop of a black, soot-choked sky.\n\nAll the while, the monolith sits unmoving in their seat.\n\nSilent.\n\n//…//\n\nThe smoke clears, the impacts cease, the city is whole again; all in the span of an instant, as the monolith breaks into actual, human laughter.\n\n//Hoh-hohohohoh! Touched a nerve, I see.//\n\nThe giant laughs again, before breaking into a brief coughing fit, as the diplomat watches in fearful indignance.\n\nEventually, the monolith manages to master itself, and speaks in that measured, irritant tone once more.\n\n//Ahem-hrm.//\n\n//Still, the price is fixed; as it always was, always is, and always will be.//\n\n//The only difference is// scale, //really. Hrhm.//\n\nThe figure leans forward, their form casting a shadow like a grand artillery unit.\n\n//I can give your little utopia a week, perhaps even two, to.. think it over.//\n\n//No more than that.//\n\n//You know how…// impatient //warfare can be at times.//\n\nThe titan stands from their chair of charred wreckage, which sinks back into the crater in the otherwise pristine wooden floor.\n\n//And speaking of, I believe I have some matters I must attend to.//\n\n//Very productive meeting, I’d say. Ha-hm.//\n\nThe diplomat, still seething in silence, watches as a hole rips itself open in the room’s roof, like a slow-motion shell strike without a projectile.\n\nJust as the monolith starts rising away into the expanse above, they stop mid-air, & turn their misshapen crown of a head.\n\n//Haven of Man, one, old age.//\n\n//Total five-thousand, five hundred, and fifty-five.//\n\n//Heh.//\n\n//I trust you will have an answer for me, when the time comes.//\n\n//Farewell.//\n\nWith those words, the Brother of Great Death ascends into the vast expanse above towards the nearest dust-grey, ruin-laden “moon” in the sky.\n\nAnd below the diplomat lets their unblemished head sink into their wrinkle-free hands.\n\n“…Goddamn it.”\n\n= **<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-of-wolves-episode-two|Episode Two]]] |=| [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-of-wolves-hub|World Of Wolves]]] |=|  Possibly Coming >>**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
