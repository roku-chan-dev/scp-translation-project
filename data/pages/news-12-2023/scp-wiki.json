In an effort to aid readers in finding content that they enjoy, genre and content tags have been added to tales. These tags include a variety of genres such as comedy, fantasy, etc. There are also setting tags, such as dyspotian, western, and more! To learn more about the new tags and their definitions, you can check out [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/genre-tagging-guide |the tale tagging guide]]]. Authors are also encouraged to follow this guide to tag their own tales, and there are rules and guidelines for those interested in helping tag other people's tales!

Their first session was on October 6th, and they read spooky tales of wonder from the Library to celebrate the season. The hosts; LAN, Rounderhouse, Piano, and UncertaintyCrossing, plan to meet every two weeks to host further readings. \n\nMuch like the SCP Wiki Discord's Reading Club, members of the audience are sometimes brought onto the stage to help read sections of an article and voice act their hearts away. It's great fun for everyone involved!\n\nIf you're interested in listening to these Reading Club sessions live, join the Wanderer's Library [https://discord.gg/FrsGp6j Discord Chat] and check the announcements channel for the next reading. If you missed one, never fear! They are all recorded and posted to [https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/wanderers-library4 Spotify] for your listening pleasure. \n\nWe hope to see you soon!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be three user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person per month, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. \n\nThis month's writing prompts are below! \n\n[[size x-large]]Secure or Protect[[/size]] //Submitted by F1J7//\nWrite an SCP article with a high disruption class and low risk class, or vise versa.\nYou can find the full descriptions of disruption and risk classes [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide|here]]].\n\n[[size x-large]]International GOI[[/size]] //Submitted by IcePhoenix44//\nWrite an article (could be a SCP, tale or GoI format!) about an international group of interest!
