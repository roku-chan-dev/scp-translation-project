Foundation agents under the guise of park rangers are to detain any person(s) attempting to enter the park outside of the southern public entrance. \n\nAll materials recovered from SCP-3598 are to be stored in biological containment units. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3598 is an extra-dimensional location accessible from Bishop's Glen Memorial Park, Columbiana County, Ohio. SCP-3598 is visually and geographically identical to Bishop's Glen and its surroundings, though SCP-3598 is observed to exist in a state of perpetual autumn. Although the area outside SCP-3598 is also visible, attempting to exit the confines of the park will cause the individual to leave SCP-3598. SCP-3598 appears to overlap with Bishop's Glen; those exiting SCP-3598 in a particular location will find themselves in the equivalent area outside Bishop's Glen. \n\nSCP-3598 is only accessible under certain conditions. If these conditions are not met in order, entry to SCP-3598 is impossible. \n* The individual must enter Bishop's Glen from geographic north. \n\n* The individual must then walk for at least thirty continuous minutes within the park; direction is irrelevant. Moving faster than what would commonly be considered \"walking\" will upset the required conditions. \n\n* After thirty minutes have passed, the individual must make their way to the creek located in the south-east portion of the park. At this point, running or sprinting will meet the required conditions. \n \n* Climbing down to the creek bed from any point will place the individual within SCP-3598. Displacement is instantaneous. \n\nSCP-3598 was discovered by the Foundation after an anonymous letter was received by the Columbiana County Sheriff's Office detailing how to find and enter SCP-3598. Foundation assets within the office were alerted, and instituted a cover-up. Investigation into the source of the letter is ongoing. \n\n**Addendum:** \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Physical Evidence-3598\" hide=\"- Accessed\"]]\n\n[[=image Image%20%283%29.jpg]]\n**Transcription**\n> Dear/to whom this may concern,\n> \n> You don't know who I am. \n> @@      @@ I made it that way. \n> \n> You've been looking for quite a \n> while.
