Bubbles begin to rise from the marshland as a large, dark shape begins to rise from its waters and SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 breaches. It is followed by other instances which use their small wings to propel themselves through the murky waters. The group travel South-East, en route to Site-44.\n\n**10:40:** SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 begins to bound forwards upon reaching the crossing to Foulness Island, [[footnote]] Beneath which Site-44 is located. [[/footnote]] quickly barging through outer surveillance. The remaining brood passes through pastureland slowly behind.\n\n**10:41:** SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 stops at the mainland access bridge. Its //Ozz noetica// angle towards a guard positioned within a lookout tower, informing them to contact “the ware swindlers”; Cryptozoology Division personnel are dispatched to commune with the instance.\n\n**10:52:** Interview 7088-15 is conducted:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<BEGIN COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n\n//SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 rests beneath the bridge. Upon the arrival of personnel, it emerges and places itself in front of the group. A low rumbling is audible emanating from its throat as it breathes.//\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Hello. What brings you here?\n\n//The instance does not communicate.//\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Do you have a name?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Irrelevant. Please return wares and provide compensation or I will make a problem.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** What wares? We haven’t contacted your colony since we found you.\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** We missing possession. Overdue payment from PCS Fundation.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** So you’re like a debt collector.\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Not know what that means… but yes.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** I see. Have you ever had to do this before?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Rare. Only when swindled. Often by king.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Kings? \n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Royal rulers use knuckerhole as storage for wares. We trade and hoard.\n\n//SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 assumes an upright posture.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Irrelevant conversation.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Uh— alright. I’ll get someone to have a look for you. One minute.\n\n**<END COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**10:54:** SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 begins to act in an agitated manner due to its belief of the literal nature of “one minute”. It is informed otherwise.\n\nAt this time, a Site-wide announcement is made requesting any staff recently in contact with SCP-7088 to come forward with any possessions that they may have collected from explorations.\n\n**11:02:** The instance is apologised to for the inconvenience. It begins to breathe heavily.\n\n**11:10:** Junior Researcher Greenfield notifies Site Management of a small coin lodged within the sole of his boot that he believes to have come from a recently explored knuckerhole. The object is an 1397 [[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George_and_the_Dragon|St George]]] golden coin no longer in circulation and is thus determined to be SCP-7088 “wares”. F. Ozz swiftly grabs the coin and rushes to the Site entrance.\n\n**11:19:** The instance grows restless and scales the boundary fence. As lockdown protocol is about to be instigated, Ozz arrives.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<BEGIN COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Out of breath)// Here you go.\n\n//SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 inspects the coin thoroughly. It appears pleased.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Thank you. For overdue payment, I expect compensation.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Oh. Um, give me a few minutes please.\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** I agree.\n\n//3 minutes later, a vehicle containing a single Gallus gallus domesticus [[footnote]] Domestic chicken [[/footnote]] arrives. The instance is gifted the animal.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** I accept small winged beast as payment. A rare feast.\n\n//Silence for ten seconds.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Goodbye. Future dealings in the future.\n\n//The instance turns around and walks away from the Site. From the line of tall grass the remaining SCP-7088 arrive, visibly out of breath. As the Proteus draconis imperator specimen continues, they reluctantly turn and follow in its wake.//\n\n//Several seconds pass as Ozz and security staff watch the brood leave. As an aircraft team prepares to escort the instances towards their residence, Ozz appears to be in thought.//\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Hold on. Wait!\n\n//The specimen turns.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** What is reason for interruption?\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** About your use as storage, can you name anyone you’ve been involved with?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** //(Seemingly in thought)// What is offer for information?\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Sighs)// Erm, one sec. //(Ruffling through pockets)// What about a notepad?\n\n//The specimen rubs its chin with a large clawed forefinger.//\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** More.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Enters nearby cargo vehicle)// An O₂ canister? The Mossmoor colony seemed to like thos—\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** More please.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Confused)// Uh, sure. I’ll be right back.\n\n//Ozz enters and emerges from a lookout post beside the Site entrance.//\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** A house plant?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** No thank you.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** A radio antenna?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Not know what that is.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Pointing to the antenna)// It’s a device used for—\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Too little. Bigger.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** You said you like sheep?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** I agree.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Stay right there.\n\n**<END COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**11:30:** Ozz enters Site-44’s Cryptozoological Research Wing and consults the cryptobiological management committee. CCTV monitoring systems are disabled within their primary office, though the voice of Researcher Ozz is heard to vocalise “we could just talk to it”, answered with “...the pursuit of research”. They proceed to a cryogenic storage unit before returning to the entrance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<BEGIN COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** What do you think about this?\n\n//A large stasis chamber is presented, containing UAO-299.// [[footnote]] UAO-299 (Unidentified Anomalous Organism) is a deceased domestic sheep 6 metres in height, recovered from rural Wales. No further anomalous qualities were noted aside from its unusual size and tendency to create a “hissing” sound and revert to a darker colouration if touched. [[/footnote]]\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** //(Visibly excited)// I agree! An even rarer feast!\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Yeah. Would you mind disclosing the information now?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Yes. We… help protect riches of king and queens since Henry 1st. He did not like vikings pillaging his gold.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Who was the most recent figure you’ve associated with? And when I say “you” I mean Knucker-kind as a whole.\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Victoria. Then… Black Water and deeper knuckerholes.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Okay, I see. Are you in contact with other colonies often?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Occasion. We exchange and trade with other Knucker-friends.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Hmm. A—\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Actually, we in agreement with big knuckerhole in south-west, near sea. All knucker trying to raise money at the moment.\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** Oh. What could you use money for?\n\n**SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4:** Top-secret bartering. //(Leans in to Ozz, resembling a whisper)// Need [[[SCP-7088|23,000,000]]] dollar. Contributions from PSC Fundation are welcome.\n\n//Researcher Ozz seems confused and appears to contemplate the statement for a moment before smiling.//\n\n**Researcher Ozz:** //(Laughing)// I’ll let you know if we can help. Future dealings in the future.\n\n//SCP-7088 instances proceed forward to take goods exchanged for the information. SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 takes UAO-299 before leaving.//\n\n**<END COMMUNICATION LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n**<END LOG>**\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\nThree hours after the conclusion of Incident 7088-1 and the escorted return of SCP-7088 instances, seismic activity was detected in the area. A sound resembling an explosion was audible from above-ground portions of Site-44 and video cameras stationed beside the recently interacted-with knuckerhole were violently shaken. MTF Gamma-4 (“Green Stags”) were deployed to assess the location for further anomalous activity — upon arrival, viscera was visible within the dark water. The head of SCP-7088-IMPERATOR-4 bubbled to the surface shortly after.\n\nFoundation cryptozoologists soon retrieved the mostly intact head to Site-44, where it can now be located, frozen, in the former position of UAO-299. F. Ozz, Junior Researcher Greenfield and the cryptobiological management committee have been temporarily reprimanded for their insubordination of “St. George Protocol” despite its assistance in SCP-7088 research.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7087]]] | SCP-7088 | [[[SCP-7089]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
