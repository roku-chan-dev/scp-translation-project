Due to the current shortage of viable personnel within our organization, The Department of Analytics has been tasked with identifying civilians to facilitate ongoing containment of SCP-7676. Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\") is responsible for the procurement of these civilians. All conscripts are to be granted Level-5/7676 clearance for the duration of their tenure.\n\nDue to the virulence of SCP-7676 and its related phenomena, contact between Zulu-9 and the outside world is to be mediated through Artificially Intelligent Constructs. The delivery of requested materials, as well as general resource replenishment, must remain fully automated.\n\nWaste materials from Zulu-9 will periodically arrive at Site-19 within black body bags. Personnel at Site-19 are to make no attempts to identify their contents, and are not permitted to interact with them beyond facilitating their incineration.\n\n**Null Engram Disqualifiers:** The following is a list of attributes which disqualify a candidate for Null-Engram status:\n\n* Former participation in after-school clubs or extra-curricular activities, including as an organizer or educator.\n* Former inclusion in any concert band, marching band, or any musical ensemble during adolescence.\n* Prior attendance of any form of summer camp.\n* Having completed an upper-secondary education at an American high school or equivalent institution.\n* Attendance to any Homecoming dance events within such a facility, regardless of context.\n* Being born or conceived prior to December 31st, 1976.\n\nFurther information is classified 5/7676.\n\n[[div class=\"warning-header\"]]\n[[div class=\"orderwrapper\"]]\n[[div class=\"council\"]]\n[[div class=\"ordertitle\" style=\"color: black;\"]]\n+* ##d8d9da|{{WARNING}}##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"orderdescription\"]]\n _\n+++* ##d8d9da|{{The following document contains information and images of a sensitive nature, and may not be safe for viewing.
