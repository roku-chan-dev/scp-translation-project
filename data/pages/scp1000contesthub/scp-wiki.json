Having run from July 27th to September 1st 2011, it was a historic event that would set the trend for the coveted X000 slots for decade(s) to come, shifting the site from a \"we're close to 1000 SCPs, prune the list\" vision, to \"we're close to 1000 SCPs, let's grow bigger\". More than five thousand SCP articles later[[footnote]]At the time of writing.[[/footnote]], we can't imagine what the Wiki would look like without these contests, and without the hype they bring.\n\nUnlike all the other X000 contests, this one took place in a [/forum/t-376556/contest-for-1000 forum thread], which makes finding information about the contest quite the challenge for the curious reader. As a result, we on Staff decided to make this Hub to keep in line with the modern times, and to make everything easier to find.\n\n[[size larger]]The contest's theme was: ##500000|**Folktales and/or Urban Legends**##[[/size]]\n[[div]]\n++ [[size larger]]__Final results:__[[/size]]\n+++ [[size larger]]1.@@  @@//[[[SCP-1000|Bigfoot]]]// by [[user thedeadlymoose]] (+46)[[/size]]\n+++ 2.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1111| The White Dog]]]// by [[user drsevere]] (+39)\n+++ 3.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1051|Nevadan Extra-terrestrial]]]// by [[user salman corbette]] (+27)\n+++ 4.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1013|Cockatrice]]]// by [[user dr gears]] (+24)\n+++ 5.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1024|The Basic Set]]]// by [[user quikngruvn]] (+21)\n+++ 6.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1060|Penanggalan]]]// by //Anonymous// (+17)\n+++ 7.@@   @@//Daredevil Horse// by [[user Dr Gerald]] (+16)\n+++ 8.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1010|The Green Man]]]// by [[user shebleha]] (+14)\n+++ 9.@@   @@//[[[SCP-1102|The Blue Ridge Phenomenon]]]// by [[user sophia light]] (+10)\n+++ 10. //[[[SCP-1448|Legend Tripping]]]// by [[user communism will win]] (+10)\n+++ 11. //[[[SCP-1666|The Devil's Music]]]// by [[user sandrewswann]] (+10)\n+++ 12. //[[[SCP-1088|The Eternity Ward]]]// by [[user anaxagoras]] (+5)\n+++ 13. //[[[SCP-1001|Ya-Te-Veo]]]// by [[user the raven]] (+3)\n+++ 14. //[[[SCP-1337|The Hitchhiker]]]// by [[user adminbright]] (0)\n+++ 15. //Sunken City of Ys// by [[user aelanna]] (0)\n+++ 16. //From Point Pleasant// by [[user dexanote]] (rating unknown)\n[[/div]]\n\nIf you've read the original thread, you may notice that there are far more entries over there than on this hub; this is because many entries got deleted before the contest ended, as well as due to the rules. The contest rules, while far from being as comprehensive as the current ones, might look familiar to those of you who have seen an xkon unfold:\n* Entries were posted with the title \"1000contest<username>\", and linked in the [/forum/t-376556/contest-for-1000 contest thread] for people to find and vote.\n* Any contestant still in the positives at the contest's end got to choose their spot in the newly opened series.\n* The winner was the article with the highest rating at the end of the contest.\n* Posting was open until September 1st, 2011, at which point Staff would announce the winner.\n\nAnd the rest is history. Two years later, [[[scp2000contesthub|2kon followed suit]]], with improved rules, organisation, and a contest hub. Right now, we're more than halfway through Series VII, so I expect another one of these beauties to take place relatively soon. Here's to a dozen more of them!\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 1000.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Vivarium]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp1000contesthub/1000.png Link]\n> **Derivative of:** \"//Vintage Victorian style goblet engraving//\", \"//And His Name That Sat on Him Was Death//\", \"//The Deformed Polyp Floated on the Shores, a Sort of Smiling and Hideous Cyclops by the Flower//\"\n\n> **Name:** //Vintage Victorian style goblet engraving//\n> **Author:** The British Library\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.rawpixel.com/image/556676/vintage-globet-illustration Rawpixel]\n\n> **Name:** //And His Name That Sat on Him Was Death// (1899)\n> **Author:** Odilon Redon\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.rawpixel.com/image/599319/artwork-odilon-redon Rawpixel]\n\n> **Name:** //The Deformed Polyp Floated on the Shores, a Sort of Smiling and Hideous Cyclops by the Flower// (1883)\n> **Author:** Odilon Redon\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.rawpixel.com/image/599295/artwork-odilon-redon Rawpixel]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
