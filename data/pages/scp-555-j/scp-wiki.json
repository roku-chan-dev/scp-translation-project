[[/footnote]][[footnote]] DONT READ THIS FOOTNOTE IF YOU\"RE NOT O5!!!! TEENY MEMETIC KILL AGENT INBOUND\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[image kill_agent.jpg size=\"thumbnail\"]]\n//We mostly made this MTF to heighten morale.// - O5-7 [[/footnote]]. Due to the incredible utility of SCP-555-J, all requests made by SCP-555-J are to be fulfilled to the furthest ability of the Foundation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-555-J is a squid with a wooden mop handle attached to its back. SCP-555-J possesses Level 4 reality-bending properties, however, it only uses its powers to clean floors. Furthermore, it will only use these properties when physically pushed across a surface. SCP-555-J has shown no desire to utilize its powers for anything other than this purpose and as such is not considered a risk. SCP-555-J is able to vocalize but cannot locomote on its own. It consistently expresses excitement about cleaning nearby surfaces, which appears to be the only topic that SCP-555-J is willing to discuss.\n\n**Addendum: Interview Log**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Dr. Furrow:** Hello SCP-555-J.
