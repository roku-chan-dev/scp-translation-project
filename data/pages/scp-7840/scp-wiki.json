Additionally, SCP-7840 exhibits all the neurological sensibilities of a human being – with the exception of pain sensations – including: reflex, tactile  sensation, olfactory senses, and involuntary movements.  Since containment, SCP-7840 has shown signs of senescence roughly paralleling a human being’s aging cycle – not weathering of its materials but loss of hair, additions of wrinkles, defining of features such as the nose and ears.  Researchers have not been able to explain this phenomenon.\n\nSCP-7840 can communicate and grasp abstract conceptual frameworks; however, it frequently fails to respond cogently to queries.\n\nSCP-7840 does not need to eat or sleep, but it pantomimes the actions of human necessity – even to the point of bowel movements – on a consistent basis, frequently stating “I’m going to be a real boy.”[[footnote]]SCP-7840’s aging has also affected its voice.  Whereas once the anomaly had the voice of a small child, its voice has grown deeper and gruffer in tone.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Discovery**: In 1987, Foundation personnel were informed by an embedded agent within the Edinburgh Police Division of a marionette show exhibiting anomalous characteristics.  During that year’s [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe | Fringe Festival]]], Magnus Freely was performing biweekly shows in which he reenacted famous events from history with marionettes.  \n\nMembers of the audience complained about the realistic cries of the marionettes in Freely’s shows, which were recorded by the authorities but not further investigated.  An SCP agent observed several of Freely’s performances but did not initially note anything abnormal.  \n\nThe agent investigated Freely’s backstage area after a performance, discovering SCP-7840 and the performer discussing the day’s performances.  Freely told investigators that he inherited the anomaly from his grandfather but had only recently discovered it was animate.   Because no connection could be found between him and the anomaly's origin, Freely was administered amnestics and the anomaly was taken back to Site-91 for containment. \n@@ @@\n+++ Addendum-7840.1: Recorded Statements by Anomaly\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 5px; background: #E6DEA5; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'\"]]\n//The following is the first recorded interview with SCP-7840.// \n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Agent Douglas**: Hi, Gizem.

Below are some selected excerpts of its statements.\n\n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//**04/12/1991**//\n\nI laid in that trunk for what seemed like centuries.[[footnote]]This is inaccurate, given that Freely’s grandfather has been confirmed to have used the anomaly when he was performing.

Patience and the fortitude to do what was necessary.\n\nWould you like to sing a song with me?\n[[/div]]\n\nBased on SCP-7840’s statements, “Breslau” was cross-referenced with locations in Germany and Breslau Hall was identified in the city of Cologne. Originally built in 1485, the Hall was a meeting place for the local woodworkers guild and was actively used for that purpose until the mid 17^^th^^ century.  The Hall was built outside the old city limits and next to the remains of the Eifel aqueduct built in the Roman era.\n\nInitial exploration of the structure did not reveal any workshops under the building, but an investigation of the aqueducts revealed a door hidden behind a brick wall that led to an abandoned space filled with woodworking tools and half-finished projects.\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/SCP-Anthology%20Cellar\n style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nUndercroft of Breslau Hall in Cologne, Germany.  \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 5px; background: #C9C8C4; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Exploration Log – 02/12/2021\n[[/=]]\n\n//On 2 December, 2021, [[[scp-6602 | Agent Gamma]]] was dispatched to the site to investigate.//\n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//[The agent approaches the excavated door.

Then suddenly the audio’s volume is raised.]//\n\n**Gamma**: She’s here. Just outside the door. Waiting. Waiting for him. Grasping for any hold on us.\n\n//[The agent looks up. A blue substance floats past the camera, resembling silk strands.]//\n\n**Gamma**: But I’ve read the file. She’s going to be waiting a long time.\n\n//[A loud high pitched shriek can be heard. Agent Gamma covers her ears until it fades.]//\n\n**Gamma**: Scream all you want, bitch. Won’t change a thing. Your little creation is a moron.  And you can't just tell him what he needs.  He’ll never figure it out!\n\n//[The cavern starts shaking, loud booming sounds are heard. Agent Gamma covers her ears and screams, crouching down.]//\n\n//[The camera pans up towards the ceiling of the cavern, at least twenty meters above the agent.  Suspended on a large web of blue strands is an arachnoid entity taking up the majority of the ceiling of the cavern.  Streams of glowing blue silk flow down from its abdomen, draping towards the cavern floor.  The feed is degraded - blurring when trying to focus on the entity's three heads.  The only detail discernable are multiple glowing points on the heads aim towards the floor.  A high pitched humming begins increasing in volume. Video feed focuses a little and the glowing points resolve into metal loops – resembling the heads of sewing needles – glowing blue and increasing in brightness, their luminance making the rest of the heads indiscernible.]//\n\n**Gamma**: What good will that do? I’m never getting out of here.\n\n**Unknown**: Bist du dir ganz sicher?[[footnote]]Are you sure?[[/footnote]]\n\n//[Gamma begins to scream and clutch at her head. After a few moments, she stops screaming.]//\n\n**Unknown**: Also schön, es geht dir wieder gut.[[footnote]]Ah, good.  All better now.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\nAgent Gamma was discovered in the passages of the aqueduct on 16/12/2021, sitting in front of the loose stone where her camera was found days before. She was immediately remanded to an isolated observation cell at Site-91. \n\nOn 24/12/2021, Gamma escaped confinement – assaulting two security personnel, leaving them catatonic and with severe head injuries.  A Site-wide search was initiated and shortly thereafter a breach alarm was triggered at SCP-7840’s containment chamber.  When security personnel arrived on scene, they discovered the agent being assaulted by the anomaly.  The agent suffered contusions to the face and neck, and a moderate concussion.  \n\nThe following is a transcript of the incident:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 5px; background: #C9C8C4; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Agent Gamma breaks into the containment chamber, dragging in an unconscious security guard and holding his weapon. She drops the guard in the corner, closes the door and turns to face SCP-7840. Her eyes briefly glow blue for less than a second as she turns.]//\n\n//[Gamma begins speaking.  SCP-7840 approaches and says something in return.  Agent Gamma shakes her head violently. She claws at her face. She points at the torso of the security guard.]//\n \n//[SCP-7840 clenches its fists.]//\n \n//[Gamma points at the anomaly and then at the unconscious guard again.]//\n\n//[SCP-7840 shakes its head and speaks animatedly. Gamma starts to speak again but the puppet interrupts her by leaping at her face, clutching her throat with one hand and striking her face repeatedly with the other. Agent Gamma collapses; the puppet continues to strike her in the face.]//\n\n//[Security personnel enter the room and pull SCP-7840 from the unconscious agent, pinning it to the floor.]//[[footnote]]Sound is recorded by personnel's body cameras.[[/footnote]] \n \n**SCP-7840**: Get off me!  She needs to tell me what to do! \n \n//[Medical personnel load Agent Gamma onto a gurney and take her from the room.  Security personnel confine the puppet to the bed in its containment chamber with zip ties.  SCP-7840 struggles against its bindings.]//\n\n**SCP-7840**: What was I supposed to do?!?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nAgent Gamma was taken to the Site-91 medical center and restrained.
