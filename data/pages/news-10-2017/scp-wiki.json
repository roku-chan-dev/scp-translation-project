If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending A Random Day a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier! \n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[news-09-2017|September 2017]]] | __[[[news-10-2017|October 2017]]]__ | [[[news-11-2017|November 2017]]] »**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n\n#header {\n    background-image: url(http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/news/SCPNewsLogo);\n}\n\n#header h2 span::before {\n    color: #eee;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    color: #f0f0c0;\n    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #000;\n    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.8);\n    content: 'Site Correspondence Periodical';\n}\n\n\n#header h2 span {\n    display: block;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 19px 0;\n    line-height: 0px;\n    max-height: 0px;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    color: transparent;\n    text-shadow: none;\n}\n\n\n/* \n\n\"SCPNewsLogo\" is a derivative of \"1f5de\" by Twitter, Inc and other contributors, used under CC BY. \"SCP-News-2018-08-Logo\" is licensed under CC BY SA by TSATPWTCOTTTADC.\n\n */\n\n[[/module]]",
