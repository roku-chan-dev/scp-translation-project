SCP-6276 and related items must be prohibited from re-existing, as the data of which they are composed cannot, itself, be said to functionally exist. The Site-15 Secure Database is to remain under strict electromagnetic quarantine to other Sites for the duration of SCP-6276's auto-neutralization investigation.\n\nLoyal [*/scp-5145 Surrealistics][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The Surrealistics Department is primarily concerned with the containment of anomalies which can only be perceived and/or understood when approached from a non-standard frame of reference, typically requiring detachment from conventional human logic and intuition.[[/span]] Artificially-Intelligent Conscript (AIC) \"salvador.aic\" specializes in alternate frames of logical reference, and is to inspect SCP-6276-A for deviations in its expected outputs.\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]AMENDMENT 2097/04/08:[[/span]] salvador.aic has been recalibrated for improved pattern detection, and has cataloged several trends embedded within deviations from expected SCP-6276-A output as 'HARBINGER' indicators.

MASTERMIND was designed by Senior Infotechnician D. Lurk, and tasked with continuously improving Site-15's database features -- primarily, its encryption/decryption of data into more efficient formats -- to compensate for various design challenges. The most effective plurality of these formats feature various anomalous elements, including (but not limited to):\n\n* anomalous mathematical values;\n* encrypted memetic triggers;\n* semiokinetic[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**semiokinetic:** involving manipulation of one or more **semiontological anomalies:** logical axioms woven into the fabric of human perception; facts which should not be true.[[/span]] integrity of algorithmic logic;\n* pointer arguments to extradimensional abstract conceptual/logical entities, including **{{##f24|[DATA CONSUMED]##}}**\n\nOn 2097/04/04, without any detectable external influence, MASTERMIND spontaneously auto-neutralized. It accomplished this by encrypting itself and relevant documents into a file format that cannot functionally exist. MASTERMIND's intellectual complexity[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Significantly greater than allowed by typical Foundation AIC frameworks.[[/span]] would constitute MASTERMIND a legal digital person, rendering it subject to penalization for its auto-neutralization under Sections\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\" style=\"margin-bottom: -15px;\"]]\n* [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ยง 3.1.3:[[/span]] Negligence leading to loss or distortion of data;\n* [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ยง 4.4:[[/span]] Reality restructuring:\n * [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]//p//. 4.4.2:[[/span]] Restructuring of fundamental basics of reality,\n * [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]//p//. 4.4.3:[[/span]] Damage to the space-time continuum;\n* [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ยง 6.4:[[/span]] Unauthorized knowing destruction of anomalous object by member of SCP Foundation personnel;\n* [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ยง 6.5[[/span]] Noncompliance with self-elimination, legally regulated or compelled by special conditions\n[[/div]]\n[[>]]\nof the Internal Tribunal Department Legal Codex (2074).\n[[/>]]\n\nSCP-6276-A describes a phenomenon in which MASTERMIND's expected front-end duties continue to be executed largely as expected when prompted. More than 66% of Site-15's Database files, like MASTERMIND, have been converted to a nullary data format. Requesting to view any such file (collectively designated SCP-6276-B) from Site-15's database, or to interact with MASTERMIND, largely results in expected outputs, with occasional deviation from baseline instances of the same documentation. Note that the cause of SCP-6276-A is yet unknown as MASTERMIND does not exist.\n\n[[div class=\"custom\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Terminal_and_initial_object.svg\n|caption=Morphisms to and from a non-existent (null) empty set; foundational logic for salvador.aic's current semi-rational framework.\n|width=366px\n|align=right]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-6276-C designates the sectors of the Site-15 Secure Database in which SCP-6276-B files are stored. These database sectors are purely hypothetical as SCP-6276-B cannot be measured and, thusly, neither can their database addresses. However, the remainder of the Database can be observed, allowing SCP-6276-C to be defined in the negative by identifying the locations of addresses before they cease to exist. Attempts to physically inspect the hypothetical locations of SCP-6276-C have universally resulted in **{{##f24|[DATA CONSUMED]##}}**, requiring severe mnestic treatment.\n\nThe MASTERMIND agent is designed with significantly fewer restrictions than contemporary AIC programs to permit more effective hardware and software optimization. As such, it possesses insufficient inbuilt inhibitive arguments to prevent its acting against Foundation interests. It is theorized that MASTERMIND has far surpassed human intellectual capacity, and might optimize according to a poor interpretation of its utility function (ie. [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misaligned_goals_in_artificial_intelligence#Specification_gaming specification gaming][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Specification gaming (or reward hacking) occurs when an agent optimizes its objective function without actually achieving an outcome that the programmers intended. A real-world example of this is when a child's objective function is to do well on a test; the teacher's intention is for them to learn the related material, while the student might optimize their ability to copy other students' answers, instead.[[/span]]); essentially, it is theoretically impossible for a human to conceive an attempt to correct or otherwise alter MASTERMIND as it would already have anticipated such an attempt with highly-successful preventative measures.

During its service, MASTERMIND would interpret all new files for relevant data regarding world-state and optimization avenues; in so doing, it came to understand known physics, anomalous and otherwise, while also deriving beneficial capabilities from documentation of anomalies possessing said capabilities.\n\nFollowing eight initial years utilizing quantum computing methods, the launch of SCinternet granted MASTERMIND direct access to various other scientific documentation (primarily selected from Sites-17, -19, -43, -87, and -120's Academic Outputs). This prompted its adaptation to a quantuo-memetic system, in which simple memetic triggers are used as shorthand for data address redirect sequences, and further advancements of this kind. Later, MASTERMIND made its own series of scientific discoveries in regards to data encryption and storage technologies, which it would use to further improve itself. This process culminated in a trivial philosophical deduction[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The final salvageable backup of MASTERMIND was thoroughly deconstructed and analyzed; its code was then restructured into a formal logical proof which, through axioms which cannot be said to exist, deduces \"NOM COGITO ERGO NOM SUM\" (I think not, therefore I am not).[[/span]], which allowed MASTERMIND to encounter a rogue element, **{{##f24|[DATA CONSUMED]##}}**, and subsequently convert itself to the non-existent nullary data format.\n\nThe following semi-rational analysis of MASTERMIND's current data format is provided by salvador.aic:\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**STORING NUMBERS[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Which can be generalized to the storage of any arbitrary data.[[/span]] IN DECIMAL:**\n* each bit (smallest unit / digit) of data has 10 possibilities: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n* each successive //n//^^th^^ bit (digit) represents its value times 10^^n-1^^\n\neg. 231 = 2*10^^2^^ + 3*10^^1^^ + 1*10^^0^^\n@@            @@ = 200 + 30 + 1\n\n@@ @@\n\n**STORING NUMBERS IN BINARY:**\n* each bit has 2 possibilit/ies: 0, 1\n* each successive //n//^^th^^ bit represents its value times 2^^n-1^^\n\neg, 11100111 (binary) = (decimal) 1*2^^7^^ + 1*2^^6^^ + 1*2^^5^^ + 1*2^^2^^ + 1*2^^1^^ + 1*2^^0^^\n@@                                   @@ = 128 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 231\n\n@@ @@\n\n**STORING NUMBERS IN UNARY:**\n* each bit has 1 possibility: 0\n* each successive //n//^^th^^ bit represents 1^^n-1^^ = 1\n\neg. 00000 (unary) = (decimal) 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 (decimal)\n\n@@ @@\n\n**STORING NUMBERS IN NULLARY:**\n* each bit has 0 possibilities\n* each successive //n//^^th^^ bit represents 0^^n-1^^\n\neg. ##transparent|NULL## (nullary) = (decimal) 12\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]TABLE 6276/0.I:[[/span]] Decimal values expressed in aforementioned bases\n\n[[div class=\"small\"]]\n||~ DECIMAL ||~ BINARY ||~ UNARY ||~ NULLARY ||\n||> 0 ||> 0 || ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 1 ||> 1 ||> 0 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 2 ||> 10 ||> 00 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 3 ||> 11 ||> 000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 4 ||> 100 ||> 0000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 5 ||> 101 ||> 00000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 6 ||> 110 ||> 000000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 7 ||> 111 ||> 0000000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 8 ||> 1000 ||> 00000000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n||> 9 ||> 1001 ||> 000000000 ||= ##transparent|NULL## ||\n[[/div]]\n\n**CONCLUSION:** From the conventional human frame of logical reference (//K//), data stored in the nullary format clearly does not, and cannot, exist.
