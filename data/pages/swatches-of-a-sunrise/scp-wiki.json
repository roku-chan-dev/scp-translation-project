A grand fire in the sky, illuminating the world so brightly that you can't even see the stars. The soft oranges, pinks and yellows of the morning sky, and even vibrant rainbows after a rainstorm.\n\nI was obsessed. Entranced by everyone's stories. Each one different and more spectacular than the last. I always wished I could be there to see it, to feel its warmth. Though, mother always told me not to look right at it.\n\nEven so, I wish that I could see it. I want to see what I can only imagine, those wondrous colors filling the sky, the sun at the center of it all. It is gone now, that light, but it exists still in memories. When my visitors come, I ask them for their memories, for their stories. It turns the leaves of the beech tree into shining green panes of light, they say, and it plays on the rushing waters of the stream like so many tiny joyful sprites.\n\nI take these stories and try, as hard I can, to picture them. If I am to paint these things, I must have the clearest image. No obfuscation can stand.\n\nI am surrounded by canvases, some complete, more discarded, all with their faces brushed in soft pinks and delicate blues. This is my lifeâ€™s work, I think, to paint a sunrise. I will fashion all manner of scenes, naturally- how could any vision of sunlight be neglected? - but the sunrise will be the greatest of those.\n\nThough it is a childish dream, I have always prayed that if I painted one perfect sunrise, perhaps I would wake one day to a true and heavenly vision through my window- a true dawn.\n\nWould that not be a most marvelous sight?\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=image pic1room.png]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** pic1room.png\n> **Author:** [[*user flowerfirst]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/swatches-of-a-sunrise SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
