External observation of the building has revealed that it has cut through cars, trees and other urban furniture present in the location.\n\nOn 24/09/2015, at 02:15, three agents from MTF Xi-10 (\"Hanged Men\") were sent into the building as a first contact exploratory mission.\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **«BEGIN LOG»**\n------\n\n//<Agents Zugarramurdi, Molinaro and Gómez are on the threshold to SCP-7611.>//\n\n**Ag.

If an SCP-7611-B instance is discovered, the nearest Foundation Facility is to send agents to retrieve the SCP-7611-A instance found within. Media suppression protocols are to be employed to coverup the manifestation and demanifestation of SCP-7611-B instances.\n\nSCP-7611-A instances are to be transported to the nearest Foundation Facility for on-site containment. Civilians who have come in contact with SCP-7611-A instances, especially those that once where its family members, are to be convinced to believe that the SCP-7611-A instance was a hallucination caused by grief or, failing that, amnesticized.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7611 refers to --two-- --eleven-- twenty-five anomalous humanoids (referred to as SCP-7611-A) that are capable of the ontokinetic manifestation of buildings (thereby referred to as SCP-7611-B) when they achieve the REM stage of their sleep cycle.\n\nThe identities of SCP-7611-A instances correspond to those of recently deceased individuals.

The name is taken from a nation that would be situated on a landmass in the Yellow Sea which is connected to the [[[scp-5345 |first anomaly discovered to be related to this affair]]]. All attempts to establish contact with the Republic of West Korea through anomalous means have so far failed.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAs of 08/02/2016, the risk that new instances of SCP-7611 pose to the stability of the veil has been progressively escalating. Amnesticization, disinformation campaigns and constant surveillance costs have risen well above the expected cost for an anomaly of this scale and scope. Furtermore, structural damage caused by breaches of SCP-7611 when an instance falls asleep has occured in Site-36, Site-107 and Site-03K. To centralize all efforts towards stopping further manifestations of SCP-7611, the O5 Council has established the Extradimensional Nations Contamination Commission. All research and containment efforts of this SCP are to be under its purview. Furthermore, several other anomalies related to the so-called West Korean Affair, [[[scp-6140 |The Daevite Empire]]] and [[[scp-4860 |Alexylva University]]] have been placed under its supervision, as the threat of an invasion by an extradimensional national entity has become high priority. Dr. Oshaghan, who has shown interest in researching extradimensional nations due to her repeated encounters with [[[scp-7722 |SCP-7722]]], her unexplained ties with [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/wikipedia-shigastan the Republic of Shigastan] and her unwavering loyalty has been promoted to Director of the Extradimensional Nations Contamination Commission.\n\nContainment and study of the anomaly carried on without interruption and without breakthroughs until a containment breach in Site-57 caused by SCP-7611 lead to the disappearance of seven SCP objects on 07/02/2016. Following this event, Dr. Oshaghan called for a meeting with multiple experts in fields of interest to the Commission in regards to SCP-7611.\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **«ATTENDEES»**\n------\n* Dr. Sayagul Oshaghan - Director of the Extradimensional Nations Contamination Commission.\n* Dir.

I'm sorry for calling you all here in such short notice, but we have a developing situation with this anomaly and you all have unique insights that can help us come to a solution with the ongoing crisis.\n\n**Dr. Táíwò:** What's the current approach to the problem?\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** We are currently evaluating if decommission is a viable option. But they are, for all intents and purposes, baseline humans. This might make terminating them completely out of the question.\n\n**Dr. Táíwò:** That might exacerbate the problem. For all we know, they're already dead.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** They still have biological function, and they still cause a lot of problems, which is something that dead people usually don't do.\n\n//<Someone snickers under their breath.>//\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** All of that to say, that we could have a better idea of what to do with them if we knew where they came from.\n\n**Dr. Devereaux:** They are unusually active in the Akiva field. I'm not the most experienced in reincarnation on the field but I am told by my associate that this isn't very common.\n\n**Dr. Orion:** True. In contrast, we can attest that they are karmically dead. They have a [[[scp-7800 |karmon count]]] that factually amounts to 0. No matter how many actions we've seen them perform, their dharmon and adharmon levels don't change.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** I'm guessing the apparent reincarnation effect might have something to do with it.\n\n**Dr. Orion:** Yes, but I have seldom actually spoken with reincarnated individuals or people coming out of an afterlife or purgatorial space or anything of the sort.\n\n**Dr. Vetaluna:** Do you not dabble in that kind of praxis?\n\n**Dr. Orion:** It's already difficult to gauge the exact mechanics of a rebirth. And this is stranger. It's one of the most clear-cut cases of reincarnation we've ever had on record but it turns out that this doesn't help us at all. There's nothing that makes their lives or their deaths stand out. There's members of all major faiths and a couple of obsure ones within this groups. Some died of old age, others of disease and a couple of them from accidents. If there was a common thread between them, we could find it and put an AI to work scanning every registered death to point out which ones are more likely to cause an SCP-7611 instance. But there isn't!\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Thanks for the information.\n\n//<There's some seconds of silence.>//\n\n**Dr. Soetoro:** It is also worth noting that the 7611 instances seem to be completely isolated from the causal timestream that this bundle of timelines use to work. So we can't reliably predict where they'll appear next, either. We tried to retroactively send an agent to check one of the locations where it an instance would appear in the future, and it just didn't appear there. Also, my contacts at Extraversal Affairs were unable to determine any possible established extradimensional point of origin for them.\n\n**Dr. Táíwò:** Can they be just completely random occurences? People randomly coming back to life inventing new countries and cities out of thin air?\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** That would be a possibility if...\n\n**Dr. Vetaluna:** If they didn't map out to locations previously that existed before this supposed \"restructuring\". Like... //<They grab one of the papers on the meeting table.>// ... 7611-B-4 was a Beryllium-Bronze building in Mauritania. That corresponds with one of the SCP-7722 instances //I// studied.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Alyx, please...\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** What if you're all looking at this wrong? I think you're focusing too much on the origin of these humans, without looking at what they might have to say for themselves.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Once we are able to understand them, they all tell pretty incoherent stories, but these paint pictures that somewhat follow the various models we had constructed for the possible world where all these anomalies originate from.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** This isn't what I meant.\n\n**Dr. Táíwò:** What did you mean, then?\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** I don't think what they say is important. I think we have to focus on what they don't say. What are they doing in their sleep that causes them to manifest a different reality on our own?\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Medical personnel were able to perform an encephalography on SCP-7611-A-1 while she was sleeping before her burst rendered the medical wing where she was interred useless. We detected unusual spikes during the REM phase of sleep. But Site directors with contained instances don't want to risk their sites by letting them sleep. We've already had too many breaches.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** I have a proposal, then.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** I'm sorry but we won't be incorporating these subjects into some sort of big machine.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** That wasn't what I was going to propose. If the effects appear when the SCPs enter a specific stage of their sleep cycle, it is highly possible that this is related to dreams. After all, it's not the first time that an external force has tried to invade us through the usage of oniric constructs. For that reason, I propose that we congregate all of the instances in Area-11,[[footnote]]Area-11, in Nordaustlandet, Svalbard archipelago, is where the Special Technology Applications Group of the Engineering Division is commisioned to develop experimental technologies and store prototypes for eigenmachines. [[/footnote]] there's a machine that can decipher the dreams of individuals introduced into it, developed under the auspices of the Department of Somniumistics. I have the permission of the O5-4 to transport the instances of SCP-7611 up there for further research. And I'm sure any Site Directors with SCP-7611 instances in their premises would be happy to get them off their sites...\n\n**Dr. Táíwò:** Impossible! The amount of resources that we'd spend just to move them is incalculable!\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** All expenses are already covered, as can be seen in this dossier.\n\n//<He hands a dossier to Dr. Oshaghan, who grabs it, reads the title and doesn't read anything else.>//\n\n**Dr. Orion:** Even then, isn't this highly irregular? We can't know how their Akiva and Karmon Counts will react to exposure to further esoteric material.\n\n**Dr. Vetaluna:** Plus, this seems like an unnecesary endangerment of the subjects. The Ethics Commit...\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Everybody please, leave us. I have to discuss this with Dr. Daghlian.\n\n**Dr. Vetaluna:** But...\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** You heard me.\n\n//<Everyone except Dr. Oshaghan and Dr. Daghlian leaves.

Why am I not at the head of this project?\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** The higher-ups feared a conflict of interests. Instead you were given control of this here commission over potentially more qualified individuals //<He points at the chair previously occupied by Dr. Vetaluna>//, were you not?\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** True.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** But I'm not here to hypothesize the motives of the Council. I'm here to tell you that, for this project, we need to examine SCP-7611. I believe that this way we will witness our forgotten past, and also our path to the Otherworlds. Their dreams will fuel our ascension. But don't worry, your name will live on once our goals are achieved.\n\n//<There's a moment of silence.>//\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** I will give you my permission with one condition.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Go ahead.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:**  I want to be there.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Done.\n\n**Dr. Oshaghan:** Thank you.\n\n------\n= **«END LOG»**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+ {{Addendum-7611/04}}\n++++ Integration within Project Basilea:\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Relevant Information on Project Basilea\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\nProject Basilea is the Foundation lead initiative into the exploration of extradimensional spaces of religious significance to access the, and exploit the esoteric materials found within. The basis of it is based on information gleaned from a \"Project Regno\" (see [[[scp-5345 |SCP-5345]]]) which points to various political entities with lesser technological advancement relative to the Foundation and who have since been erased from Baseline reality that attempted this same project. These nations are of major interest due to their influence on the West Korean Affair. Further information is strictly disclosed following a \"need to know\" basis.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing orders from Dr. Oshaghan, all sites currently containing SCP-7611-A were relieved of their duties in regards to this object starting the 09/01/16. Logistics personnel arrived at these specific facilities and moved the SCP-7611-A instances to Area-11 by plane for further safekeeping and experimentation. This way, they were to be fully integrated within Area-11's structure and research projects, particularly **Project Basilea**.\n\nOn 02/02/16, SCP-7611-1 through SCP-7611-6 were introduced into the Class 2 Oneiroic Imaging Detector's sensory deprivation chambers and permitted to sleep. No further data was released by the personnel of Area-11, but it has been estimated that it went on for 36 hours before abruptly ending due to SCP-7611's containment breach.\n\nA full timeline of events can be found below:\n\n* 00:00 Contact is lost with Area-11, constituting a suspect Λ-level breach.\n* 00:07 Reliquary Area-27, as the Foundation facility with the most sensitive Akiva radiation counters in the Northern Hemisphere, registers an unusual spike in the Akiva field.\n* 00:09 A Λ-level alert is raised on all Foundation facilities near the North Pole.\n* 00:15 Reliquary Area-27, Site-70 and Site-300 all register a rise in ambient Tartarean Energy in the whole Northern Hemisphere.\n* 00:26 People in the Svalbard islands note an unusually luminous aurora borealis.\n* 00:29 Following protocol, the SCPS Kvasir, stationed in Iceland travels northward to recontain and salvage any possible assets from Area-11.\n* 00:48 Orbital Site-86 registers unusual visual disturbances in the atmosphere on the Svalbard islands.\n* 00:50 All of these events are flagged by the Tactical Theology department's NSTRDM-OS[[footnote]]An experimental prediction algorithm that utilizes computational and theological elements in order to calculate potential apocalyptic events via large-scale pattern analysis and occult scrying.[[/footnote]] as hallmarks of an ongoing //Venatio Divina// event. The characteristics of the event are outlined below:\n\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n[[>]]\nApotheosis - Humanity's most dangerous pipe dream.\nBy: Iphigenia Daskalakis\nPublished in Dokein: A Journal for Tactical Theology.\n[[/>]]\n------\n\nAs outlined before, both the birth of a deity and a successful apotheosis out of a mortal shell (which oftentimes are one and the same) are a rare and dangerous phenomenon. But this danger comes from many places. For example, if the circumstances are right, trascendence into a //Praeda//-class pluripotent entity may happen. This is when a deity is stillborn, dead on arrival upon the theologic plane. The danger, of course, doesn't come from the entity itself, but from the scavengers it attracts.\n\nDead deities provide an excellent feast of Akiva and other esoteric fluxes for Empyrean, Tartarean or even other pluripotent entities. If a //Praeda//-class pluripotent entity somehow manifests upon Earth or any other theorised location where it would be vulnerable, other beings of divine origin can and will congregate around it to profit from the spoils of its death. This phenomenon, theorized by Helena Blavatsky, is called a //Venatio Divina//. This is thought to have only been observed twice before: on the botched ritual of ascension of the Cult of the Slaughtered Lamb, in Ljubjana, 1967; and the infamous event caused by the Victory Society in [[[scp-1936 |Daleport]]], in 1997. Both of these required extensive Foundation cleanup and coverup procedures. At least one other of these occasions is thought to have occured without Foundation intervention (al-Taqi, 2002, 89).\n\nIt is, thus, a prerrogative of the Office of Tactical Theology to stop the formation or summoning of //Praeda//-class pluripotent entities. Too many of them in one place leads to a  calls upon a proliferation of more dangerous entities in baseline reality, leading to a possible HK-Class deific subjugation scenario.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n* 00:54 The alert is raised globally in all Foundation Sites.\n* 00:58 An emergency meeting of the O5 Council is called.\n* 01:09-01:23 Changes in behavior of contained objects are detected in sites worldwide. These include: the allegedly spontaneous summoning of [[[scp-4950 |SCP-4950]]] in the fantasy literature section of the New York Public Library; a containment breach of [[[scp-8723 |SCP-8723]]], which suddenly gains automotion, escapes its enclosure and starts traveling northward and a completely unknown and a completely garbled message is broadcasted from [[[scp-7804 |SCP-7804]]]\n* 01:26 The aurora borealis reaches the town of Hammerfest, Norway.\n* 01:29 Director Devereaux, of the Department of Tactical Theology, sends the following message to Site-01:\n\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\nTo the attention of the Overwatch Council.\n\nThe situation is dire. I know right now one of you is probably trying (and quite possibly succeeding) to convince the others to not bomb their little pet project to kingdom come. Thus, I feel like an external voice is needed. Reactivating a dead project from a dead timeline was an extremely risky move, especially if that project involves punching holes into potential afterlifes. But by letting the SCP-7611-As sleep to see this once dead timeline, an accidental incomplete apotheosis has been caused. This is not the first time the Foundation has done this (I don't need to remind you of the debacle of Project KAIROS, that caused the downfall of my predecessor).\n\nI beg of you: terminate this project with extreme prejudice.

The entire population of the facility was posthumously granted the Foundation Medal of Honor.\n\nAll details regarding Projects Haussmann, Epimetheus and ████████, headed by the Special Technology Applications Group of the Engineering Division have been redacted by order of the Overseer Council. However, the following two accounts regarding Project Basilea have been added to this file as an added context for SCP-7611.\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **«ATTENDEES»**\n------\n\n* O5-8\n* Dr. Sylvia Daghlian - Representative from the Engineering Division, Esoteric Containment specialist.\n\n------\n\n= **«BEGIN LOG»**\n\n------\n\n//<Dr. Daghlian is alone in a pitch black meeting room in Area-11. The ley line powered holographic projection of O5-8 appears in the middle of the room. Dr. Daghlian bows.>//\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Good afternoon, overseer. I hope this meeting isn't too much of a bother for you.\n\n**O5-8:** My time is short, so you better make it quick.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Yes, overseer.\n\n**O5-8:** You wanted to request usage of SCP-7611 for your pet project. Am I right?\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Yes, overseer, as always.\n\n**O5-8:** Now, why should I allow that?\n\n//<Dr. Daghlian paces around the room.>//\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Well, you see, these individuals are a way to see through the crevices that the West Korean reality shift left behind. Aren't they? For the sake of my research, I would benefit, nay, I need to see what these anomalies conjure in their sleep.\n\n**O5-8:** Can't you achieve results without using unpredictable humanoids prone to uncontrolled ontokinetic outbursts?\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** With all due respect, overseer, the resources we have been lended by overwatch have all but run out. We have gleaned all we can from SCP-5345. And SCP-7722 is a bust. As for SCP-████ and [[[scp-6435 |6435]]], they are kept under a tight lid by Tactical Theology. So, direct experimentation into afterlifes  Our contacts in the Vatican are also silent. So, our research into inducing an exploration of an afterlife has hit a dead end.\n\n**O5-8:** Are you positive that this is the only way?\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Otherworlds, as the West Koreans called them, are the only spaces where a mortal such as me and, dare I say, you, can achieve a theologically sound apotheosis without being cannibalized by an eternal worm spawned from the Theochorus. And all information about how these so called \"Extradimensional Nations\" got there was wiped clean by the restructuring. The dreams of SCP-7611-A is the most reliable way of accessing that data.\n\n**O5-8:** You seem to know a lot about induced apotheosis.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** It is my specialty to know what's on the best interests of the Council, overseer.\n\n**O5-8:** Perhaps you should watch yourself, Dr. Daghlian. Hubris is not a good traveling companion.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Overseer, I must reiterate myself at the risk of causing you to lose some precious time. The history of the Foundation is rife with attempts at achieving immortality through esoteric means for the sake of the O5 council. Half of our best achievements, from the discovery of stable alchemical particles to the entire roster of Tactical Theology projects have been based around this one dream. Right now, this is the best shot I have of granting this to you. If that fails, we will have gained access to a wellspring of new, potentially divine, material for the Foundation to exploit. And in the worst case scenario, we will have learned about the intentions and nature of the proliferation of anomalies from a now non-existent reality. This project brings with it a win-win situation that both of us can put in our respective portfolios. I only wish to see the Foundation succeed, overseer.\n\n**O5-8:** We will see about this.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** My facility, Area-11, has state of the art containment apparati for beings such as SCP-7611-A. There is nothing to fear if they are brought here to be examined.\n\n//<There's a moment of silence.>//\n\n**O5-8:** In two days time, the There is a meeting of the Extradimensional Nations Contamination Commission. You will be there. And you will gain control of the asset.\n\n**Dr. Daghlian:** Thank you, overseer.\n\n------\n= **«END LOG»**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOne of the 312 charred corpses recovered from the site of the containment breach held the next note, shielded from HECOR's blast by a chance due to some thaumaturgic charms present around the note.\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\nTO DO:\n[[/=]]\n\n* Follow Daghlian around doing the whole song and dance.\n* Eat.\n* See if i can find where Amirkhan[[footnote]]Name that SCP-7611-9 used to call itself.
