Individuals who witness or take part in SCP-6237 related activities are to be amnesticized, and their organizations disbanded.  Disinformation is to be utilized to maintain the Veil on a case-by-case basis, but as this will not eradicate the nature of SCP-6237’s threat to maintaining normalcy, further procedures are warranted.  \n\nTo this end, a broad-scope disinformation campaign is to be implemented across the United States and Western Europe.  This campaign will consist of two different yet equally important aspects:\n* Embedded agents within conservative organizations, both secular and religious, are to encourage the belief in and provide anecdotal evidence of occult conspiracies at work within the area;\n* Foundation personnel will execute false occult activity scenarios for local police forces to respond to.  These will serve to form the basis of debunking activities which will be undertaken by prominent psychologists and investigators also in Foundation employ.\n\nTogether, these two programs will serve to undermine the public’s awareness of SCP-6237 activities and provide disincentive for local police forces to respond with serious engagement.  Within three months of operation, the program is to be taken to national and international media outlets to further the spread of disinformation.\n\nOne copy of each SCP-6237-A instance is to be contained in the Safe Class containment wing of Site-106.\n\n++++ __Description__: \nSCP-6237 is a series of interconnected anomalies centered around the production and distribution of esoteric occult literature throughout the United States and Western Europe.\n\nThe literature in question is a series of “how-to” manuals for the ritual activities performed by their licensees (hereafter designated SCP-6237-A). [[footnote]]As of writing, Foundation personnel have catalogued twenty-three volumes on various subjects including: //Raising the Dead for Dummies//, //Communing with the Divine//, //Psychokinesis and You//, and //How to Deconsecrate a Holy Space//.[[/footnote]]  Instances of SCP-6237-A represent knowledge culled from tomes within the Wanderers' Library, along with other occult sources such as the Global Occult Coalition’s Council of 108.  The language utilized to communicate these rituals has been radically simplified so as to be accessible and understandable to a layperson, effectively granting uninitiated civilians the anomalous abilities of a moderately-advanced thaumaturgist.[[footnote]]The scale of which is usually reserved for individuals in the Serpent’s Hand, or one of the several occult colleges located within [[[nexus-series | FP-01]]] (Three Portlands).[[/footnote]]  The threat to normalcy these materials represent cannot be understated. \n\nSince 1981, Foundation personnel have recorded over two thousand instances of minor anomalies connected with SCP-6237 including, but not limited to:\n\n* Thaumaturgical rituals with ontokinetic effects on local reality;\n* Granting of limited ontokinetic abilities to franchise licensee members – flight, transformation, and minor precognitive divination;\n* Cognitohazardous effects utilized in recruiting and “brainwashing” members;\n* Necromantic thaumaturgical activities;\n* Successful summoning of minor demonic entities.\n\n**Discovery**: Beginning in 1981, numerous events fitting the description of occult or “satanic” practices were reported to law enforcement throughout the United States.  A significant portion of these reports exhibited the above-noted anomalous effects.  At first, Foundation personnel were able to cover up and amnesticize all those involved as this pattern was slow to emerge.  But within eighteen months the frequency at which the events occurred had increased to such a level that the O5 Council implemented a wide-scope disinformation campaign (as noted in the Special Containment Procedures) and dedicated significant resources to finding the source of SCP-6237.\n\n-----\n@@ @@\n++++ **Addendum 6237-1**: \n[[div style=\"border: solid 3px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; background:#EFF5EF; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**Incident Log 6237-23**//[[footnote]]Provided for example, as over two hundred such incidents have been logged in total.

The UIU had been tailing the Soviet throughout the day, having been prewarned of his entrance into the country. Surveillance had begun the moment the agent disembarked from his plane at Miami International Airport.  Foundation personnel were able to track the UIU operation and get access to the surveillance through the embedded agent.  Director Dewitt decided Foundation action would be limited to observation unless a threat to the Veil was likely.\n\nSeveral hours into the surveillance, the GRU operative entered an office building in downtown Miami, owned by ERS LLC.  The UIU agents moved to apprehend when after forty-five minutes the operative was seen running through the parking lot.  \n\nFoundation personnel were informed by the UIU embedded agent that the operative had been involved in attempted industrial sabotage.  Upon apprehension, the UIU agents began transport to Downtown Miami for interrogation at the federal building.  Intercepted communications included the allegation that subject had witnessed thaumaturgical practices while within the building.  \n\nFoundation analysts discovered the building in question was the source of a pervasive but imperceptible cognitohazard, noting that the building was not even on official maps of the city.  Given the reported thaumaturgy, the anomalous international sabotage, and the apparently anomalous perception filter on the building itself, Director DeWitt ordered the embedded agent to incapacitate the UIU personnel in transit and assist with recovery of the subject by Foundation forces.  The UIU personnel were amnesticized and conditioned to report that they had lost the subject, while agent Alexei Laskin was transferred to Site-106 for debriefing.  \n\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border: solid 3px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; background:#EFF5EF; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Site-109%20Logo width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ __Interview Log__\n[[/=]]\n\n**Interviewed**: Alexei Laskin – GRU Division P agent\n**Interviewer**: Director DeWitt\n-----\n\n**DeWitt**:  What were you doing at the ERS building?\n\n**Laskin**: I not help you, Foundation.\n\n**DeWitt**: Listen, you tell me what I want to know, and you can go home.

The loan was distributed to SCP-6237-B’s founder and current CEO, Oriel Leger, despite the complete lack of previous business ventures.  Since SCP-6237-B’s founding in 1980, all financial services have been provided by the same institution.\n\nAn embedded agent posing as an undergraduate student[[footnote]]ERS had been employing undergraduates as interns from several Florida universities since their establishment in 1980 – despite this fact, no indication of anomalous activity was present from the company prior to the interference with the cognitohazardous effect.[[/footnote]] applying for an internship with the company’s marketing division reported further information about the company’s activities.[[footnote]]The agent disappeared after transmitting their information to Site-106 subsequent to the interview and has been declared missing in action.[[/footnote]]\n\nERS primarily operates on the franchise business model, providing the following services to franchisee organizations:\n* Selling exclusive licenses to perform ritual cult activities, along with the instruction manuals (SCP-6237-A) and VHS tapes;\n* Direct supply of wholesale occult materials including but not limited to ritually purified salt, robes, bells, virgin’s blood by the quart, and candles by the dozen;[[footnote]]An additional service is available for the giftwrapping of  occult paraphernalia/materials.[[/footnote]]\n* A tollfree customer service telephone line (1-800-SATAN4U) available from 5pm to 5am EST.\n\nSeveral attempts to infiltrate the building were met with failure and the loss of MTF personnel.  Furthermore, while the investigation was ongoing instances of SCP-6237-A ritual activities were still occurring, especially within the United States and England.  Disinformation campaign expenditure increased with each fiscal quarter[[footnote]]Foundation efforts had begun to focus on mainstream media coverage of “satanic conspiracies,” culminating in the November 1987 television special by Geraldo Rivera entitled “Satanic Cults and Children” featuring outlandish allegations of widespread conspiracies of supposed “Satanic” cult groups victimizing children.  Rivera claimed that over a million Satanists were present within the United States and were highly organized.[[/footnote]] such that the containment of SCP-6237 was regularly among the top five drains on Foundation resources.  \n\nGiven the above, and the failure of three independent missions to infiltrate SCP-6237-B, the Department of Procurement and Liquidation made the following proposal:\n[[div style=\"border: solid 3px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; background:#EFF5EF; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/DeptCon%20Logo%20Black width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n\n++++ From the Desk of Director DeWitt\n[[/=]]\n\nRe: Proposal concerning SCP-6237\n\nIn respect to the cascading rising costs of containment and the failure of infiltrations of SCP-6237-B, the Department of Procurement and Liquidation proposes the following action.

On entrance to the containment chamber, an MTF Tau-9 squad discovered SCP-6237-C lying face down on the floor in a pool of his own blood.  An autopsy was performed, and it was found that a perfectly circular fissure had been carved [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2578 | in the subject’s body from the top of his head to his groin]]].  There was no damage to the surrounding area, ceiling or floor of the containment chamber.\n\nFive minutes after the body was discovered, the secure fax machine in Director Dewitt’s office received the following message:\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nFoundation,\n\nWe apologize for stepping in there, but it’s for the best.  Despite the saying, the devil you know REALLY isn’t better.  \n\nYou are watched.  You are protected.  And you’re very welcome. \n\n– □□□[[footnote]]The meaning of the three squares remains unclear. The Department’s analysts theorize that the original message contained special characters unsupported by the fax machine.[[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6236]]] | SCP-6237 | [[[SCP-6238]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Grigori Karpin]]\n> **Filename**: Cultist\n> **Author**: Peter Harris\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/21925654@N06/37558459725/ | LINK]]]\n\n> **Filename**: Cult Members\n> **Author**: kylelf_\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/kylehailey/525978623/in/photolist-NtM7X-2gARY9K-PohmkY-6Ni9oq-2j1dtQQ-GwCpGV-zF1L1Y-MLg3ia-2gBgQxJ-HPkZ2s-2jbzxRy-PohfNA-2gBhtWC-8mZHHD-2gARgcE-dVRAXJ-24kPFiB-2gzSPnV-2gALVM4-27L2kui-2gC5jTW-2gADhH8-2hCUo1p-BPRR1X-2gn9ps7-z1KNnc-2gADcDA-21q86e7-2gzkwo7-294F3cU-DZ8fQG-qZV1xN-2j1SNKo-2gAUszs-5nJqBn-qzwNxe-2gBgWmY-CbCsqb-9H574x-zVku6q-4vAzvx-DHrNSA-oX69UY-292XYLo-Lc9wNu-MxPYDw-2hLvkmC-bpU3eH-QkFP8x-6hdUWB | LINK]]]\n\n\n> **Filename**: Book cover Fabric\n> **Author**: Delany Dan\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/delanydean/4460819042/ | LINK]]]\n\n> **Filename**: Arcadia Office Building\n> **Author**: Person-with-No Name\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jingke888/51007885515/ | LINK]]]\n\n> **Filename**: Baphomet wallpaper\n> **Author**: nzhamstar\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/16982169@N03/3803764444/ | LINK]]]\n\n> **Filename**: Love Conquers Hate\n> **Author**: Glendale United Methodist\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/glendaleumc/45079907451/ | LINK]]]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
