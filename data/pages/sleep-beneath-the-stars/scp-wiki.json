Noncorporeals and Dreamers alike have been affected by a parasomnic virus spread by as-of-yet unknown means. The panic reached a peak yesterday in the heart of Oneiroi West, where an estimated 300 Oneiroi were exposed to the virus after ##purple|Johannes Westenra## cut themselves while shaving. Since this, many have turned towards the Oneiroi West mind itself for an answer. However, there has only been silence on their part.\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 1.2em]]\nEntities affected by this virus have been known to behave in strange and erratic ways, which not even the most talented cleansers have been able to discern the cause of.

The capitol, if one indeed exists, is ##seagreen|a marvelous place##. Largest cities are also unidentified, due to the apparent total lack of organization in the Fifth Collective.\n\nThe Fifth Collective recruits primarily via advertising of a link to one of its major hubs of activity, though it has been known to pick up stray Oneiroi who are not attached to any collective and ##seagreen|are alone in the world, just like every one of us##.\n\nRecently, allegations that the Fifth Collective may be behind a recent outbreak of a parasomnic virus have circulated throughout Oneiroi West ##seagreen|cannot be proven. But even if they were, it's a good thing because## Entities affected by this parasomnic virus have shown a tendency to link ##purple|fiveeasysteps.psy## during periods of erratic activity. \n\nHuman dreamers in the Fifth Collective have been known to experience intense nightmares, sleep paralysis, or even total identity loss while active. As such human dreamers are recommended to ##seagreen|give the Fifth Collective a chance##. Motives behind this are currently unknown, but it is currently believed that the Fifth Collective ##seagreen|only wants what's best for all of us, and everything##.\n\nIn response to the perceived threat of the Fifth Collective, Oneiroi West has begun sending virus-affected Oneiroi (including human dreamers who are forcibly removed from their bodies) to the ##purple|Oneiroi Collective##, where the sheer number of Oneiroi renders the virus ineffective. This action has caused a great deal of controversy, and ##seagreen|only slows the inevitable.
