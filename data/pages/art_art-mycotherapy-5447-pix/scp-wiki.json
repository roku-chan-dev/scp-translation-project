I had an idea and ended up asking in the IRC if anyone wanted to be interviewed about their article for a video and [[*user Doctor Fullham]] and one other person responded so I got to do a longer format fun little video ðŸ˜­.\n\nThis has been really really fun so far but I think the longer format might do better on //Youtube.// Plus then I wouldn't have a time limit to conform to... In the future for interview thingies, I might do the regular explanation video I normally do on Tiktok... then mention the long format interview in the video? Videos over 60 seconds tend to perform poorly and It'd probably get more eyes on the interview in the long run to just mention it in a video that does better lmaooooo. We'll see.\n\nStill, I really like this article! It's got a very somber tone and definitely has a lot to relate to. That kind of frustration when you've worked so hard and gotten //so close/// to being something only for you to fall back in a hole is really //really// common. And it ISN'T about angry birds.\n\nI wanted to do a sunset-y color theme both because... well it's pretty. But //also// because I thought it could represent something. I don't know. Maybe explaining my artistic vision is kind of defeating the point of having it.\n\n \n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
