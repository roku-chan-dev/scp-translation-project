Yes, all is well.\n\n-----\n\nYour laboratory sterile\nThe room shaking from the blast\nYou ignore it, you tinker\nThe work must be finished fast\n\nThose awful beasts towering\nShadows cast upon your Site\nTheir footsteps swift approaching\nYou swear you'll put up a fight\n\nSwiftly carving the symbols\nAs they're banging on your door\nHit the ground, do not cower\nShow them what you have in store\n\nYou pull the trigger justly\nBullets turn their bones to ash\nIn the ammo, magic flows\nCausing their bodies to mash\n\nYour last attacker, fallen\nLong gone, far as you can tell\nRise to your feet with a sigh\nAll is calm. Yes, all is well.\n\n-----\n\nOur numbers they keep dwindling\nBack to them, we do the same\nBoth our men, now so fatigued\nYet our anger's still aflame \n\nAs tired as we may be\nStrategy will win this bout\n\"For we refuse to meet an end!\"\nI swear we shall remain stout\n\nSigils carved into the dirt\nBrave men dare not be replaced\nAs unholy beasts shall rise\nCharge straight into dangers faced\n\nTerrible forces raging\nWith magic's frightening blast\nThe battlefield preys for death\nAs your spell begins to cast\n\nWords entwined with [[[fire and hate]]]\nYour power and your rage swell\nAs it is released you grin:\nAll is calm. Yes, all is well.\n\n-----\n\nDust awaiting to settle \nThe suns light rises once more\nSuch death, bodies uncounted\nI blink my eyes, my bones: sore\n\nThe chemist groans to his feet\nHealing magic on his mind\nThe material he gathers\nGiving help to all he finds\n\nBetween such men, the foreman\nAsh covering his steel hands\nRaising men back to their feet\nRepairing all where he can\n\nSo the general lights the cig\nHer breath quick and unsteady, \nRallying us into our place\nA speech they all made ready\n\nTheir men look to them for aid\nBrushing my arm; ashes fell\nWith tired eyes they call out\n\"All is calm. Yes, all is well.\"\n\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n[[size 80%]]\n= With thanks to LAN 2D, Doctor Cimmerian, notgull,  and Arcydziegiel.\n[[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** bang-pow-boom.jpg\n> **Name:** All Is Calm, All Is Bright\n> **Author:** United States Marines\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:All_Is_Calm,_All_Is_Bright_(8293388783).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
