Especially the ones that metamorphosis. Fun fact: moths and butterflies completely liquefy when in the chrysalis and the different parts of them grow separately before re-attaching to each other. //BUT/// they still retain memories from when they were caterpillars.\n\nThis probably just implies that at least part of the nervous system remains intact while the majority of the body turns to soup but... if you have an imagination it could mean something cooler probably. Moths are metal as hell. \n\nAnother one where I interviewed the author! These have all been really fun to do, especially getting to draw the little characters but the last one was too long for TikTok, apparently, so I decided to do the regular process video for TikTok AND  Youtube video with the interview. This seems to be a good strategy! I've also started making the videos take up less time than the full minute. Seems to make them perform better so far.\n\nThe TikTok thing is already at 666 views([https://i.imgur.com/mfuGRqs.png yes that's exactly what it was at when I looked]) which means more people, in the long run, will see the interview. ahhhhhhh algorithms.\n \n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
