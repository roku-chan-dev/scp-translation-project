Anyone affected by SCP-6091 is to be detained, questioned, and given amnestics corresponding to their time within the USSR.\n\nFoundation agents working within the USSR are advised to use caution when staying within the Stalingrad Oblast [[footnote]] Update (1961): What is now the “Volgograd Oblast”[[/footnote]], and acquire whatever information possible on SCP-6091.\n\nAgents are warned that agents of GRU Division-P have similar orders to detain any SCP-6091 affected individuals, and thus, it is of high priority to remove any affected persons from Soviet-aligned states before symptoms begin manifestation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6091 is a phenomenon randomly affecting humans passing through the area of the Stalingrad Oblast[[footnote]] See prior footnote[[/footnote]] within the Soviet Union. Symptoms of SCP-6091 include increased anxiety, burning sensation within the skull, and if left untreated, will escalate to full psychosis. When asked about the nature of their psychosis, patients have reported simply that “It’s watching me.”\n\nWhile much about SCP-6091 is unknown, amnestic regimens have proven effective in curing its symptoms, provided they remove the memories surrounding when the afflicted individual was presumably infected.\n\nDue to political complexities, additional information regarding SCP-6091 has been incredibly difficult to acquire. Its nature of transmission, geographic spread, and physical appearance, if it possesses any, are unknown.\n\nHowever, statistical analysis of SCP-6091 affected persons has revealed that those affected all were within the Stalingrad Oblast at some point during their time in the Soviet Union. Anecdotal evidence of when symptoms first manifested suggests that SCP-6091 is in some way connected with historical battles fought in the area during World War 2.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#F5F0BF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-top: 16px;\"]]\n\n//**UPDATE: Due to New Information, Current Containment Procedures are Judged Incomplete.**//\n\n//**Edits Pending.**//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nIn 1991, when the Soviet Union was disbanded, several members of the Soviet paranormal research and response agency (GRU Division P) defected to the Foundation, bringing a wide array of documents dating back decades and shedding light on previously unknown anomalies.\n\nResearch into SCP-6091 and the Volgograd Oblast revealed a file dating back to World War 2, labelled simply as “Wrath”, enclosed below.

I saw the creature you are looking for.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** I find that hard to believe, the last man who saw it is a gibbering mess in a padded cell after he tried to claw his eyes out.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  Well, I saw something floating, spherical, the size of a tank, and when it spotted me, half the buildings on my street changed positions.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** …go on.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:** I had crawled for days through the rubble, nearly got caught by Germans multiple times. Kept getting lost because the streets and buildings kept changing position. I walked past the same fucking German checkpoint //three times//.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** Well you clearly found your way out.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:** One night, while I was looking at the stars, the street outside changed position twice while I wasn't looking.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** Your point, Lieutenant Pavlichenko. Now.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:** I told you, I was stargazing, and I realized that despite the building changing, //the stars didn't change position//.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** ...the environment was changing, but //you// weren't changing location.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:** да. Once I realized that, it was simply a matter of maintaining my bearings and ignoring the environment around me. Found the German camp fairly easily after that, and staked them out. Their security was terrible. Probably thought nobody could get through the distortions.  \n\n**Gen. Kirov:** And?\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  And one day, they brought something out. It was big. T-34 size at least, possibly larger. It was floating, and they had it covered with a cloth tarp.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** So that is how they’re transporting it without going mad...\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  It is clever. If I didn’t know better, I’d have thought it was a large weather balloon. Only when I was close enough I could see something wriggling under the bag through my scope. Unfortunately, I…I think it noticed me.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** Noticed you?\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  Well…something began pushing off the cloth, and the room I was in began to get physically smaller and smaller. It got to the point where I had to use my rifle to keep the walls from collapsing in on me, and even that barely slowed it.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** How did you survive?\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  Ironically, the Germans. I think the distortions began affecting the rest of the camp too, so they thought the creature had gone rogue. The handlers had strange goggles, with glowing wires on them? They had no problem looking at the creature with its bag pulled off, and they began shooting at it. It let out some screech and began bleeding slightly through the bag before calming down, but by then the walls had expanded enough again that I could flee.\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** …where were the exact coordinates of the camp.\n\n**Lt. Pavlichenko:**  █████ █████, by the █████ █████\n\n**Gen. Kirov:** Perfect, we can redirect our operations around it, and keep an eye on that sector, good job, Pavlichenko, you may have given us the keys to the end of this weapon.\n\n**Lt.

She was so certain, she offered to take them to the front and test them herself. Such assurances satisfy me, though how the Capitalists got these without even having a presence on the continent still makes me wonder [[footnote]] Relevant documentation provided by the GOC has revealed that the goggles were acquired from an Allied Occult Initiative raid on an Obskuracorps facility in Königsberg earlier in the year.[[/footnote]].\n\nThe issue I would raise is not with the materiel our allies have provided, it is with the manpower. Reynolds knows what he is doing, for sure. His Russian is passable, and his knowledge of esoterica and science is unparalleled. Already, he has told us more about our enemy than we have learned in months. Now we know which shadow branch of the Nazi Party is responsible for this weapon, the Obskuracorps.\n\nHowever, Reynolds is almost //too// knowledgeable.

It's expanded its field of fire to almost the whole city. Do you know how hard it is to fly when the very air around you changes positions at a moment's notice? While you're being shot at by German flak and fighters?\n\nI can’t keep Wrath a secret when it is annihilating entire squadrons. I can’t get anymore pilots into the air, even under threat of execution. They are saying there is an air defense system that makes it impossible to even approach the German lines. You need to do something, //now//. Before it gets out and spreads panic in the army. //- Col. Kunetzov//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#F5F0BF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px; margin-bottom: 16px; margin-top: 16px;\"]]\n__**Update to Reynolds Assessment (7/8/1942)**__\nI asked Commander Reynolds for a private test of his weapon. After he explained the basics of what it did, how it worked, and what a “lightning elemental” was, I told him I would allow him to go on his mission.\n\nI was going to ask him which men he wanted for his mission, but before I could finish, he had a list of volunteers whipped out and pushed in front of my face.\n\nHe is leaving tonight, through something called a “Way”, which none but those on the mission are allowed to see. All I know is that it is some method of getting into the German camp undetected.\n\nThe infiltration team looked quite intimidating, dressed in black, carrying massive weapons, and wearing half of those German goggles he delivered.\n\nTruthfully, I hope Reynolds and his team succeed. But my gut, and thousands of dead soldiers don’t believe he will.\n\nAnd in the event my gut is correct, I have sent Lieutenant Pavilchenko with her own pair of esoteric German goggles to monitor the situation. //- Gen.

I was sitting at my desk when the first tremor hit, and when I blinked, my tent was suddenly facing the opposite direction.\n\nAfter that point, there was gunfire from behind the German lines.\n\nMore cracks echoed across the city, echoed by distortions.

During World War 2, the Allies needed to figure out how many tanks the Nazis had, based solely off of the remains of the blown up tanks they'd destroyed. So they grabbed a bunch of eggheads from University math departments, gave them the serial numbers off blown up tanks, and had them work some statistical magic to figure out what the total number of tanks there were in the Nazi army.\n\nHere's the thing. I think the GOC researchers were talking about The German Tank Problem because //that's// what the GOC's been trying to do with these SCP-6091 fragments, and why they've been so open.\n\nThey wanted to know how much of SCP-6091 is in our vaults, and compare it with their own to see how many more fragments are left in that forest. And the best way to get our numbers is to be nice and transparent about theirs.\n\nWhich is where we get that problem I mentioned.\n\nI ran the numbers. Even making //generous// assumptions about SCP-6091, when counting the bits and pieces the Coalition has in custody, the pieces we have in custody, and the pieces we assume are still somewhere in that forest, we're still missing about **30%** of SCP-6091's biomass.\n\nBest case scenario, there's still hunks of Elder God strewn over a Russian forest somewhere and we'll find it when some tourists walk into it.\n\nMost likely scenario, the Soviets buried those pieces in a vault somewhere, and the Russians are keeping its location a secret.\n\nBut, worst case scenario?\n\nIt got up and walked away.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6090]]] | SCP-6091 | [[[SCP-6092]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
