Religion has been consequential in both mediating and sparking strife across the Earth, whether it served to bring groups into harmony or create tension amongst men. The lives and deaths of millions have been irrevocably modified by the societal inertia of generational worship. This fact is undisputed.\n\nAnd yet the wheels of history have not solely been turned by the hands of men acting on behalf of lofty Names. The divine itself has always played a role in the shape of our existence — not solely as ideals or metaphors, but as concrete parties, interfering with the course of fate to achieve their goals. From the time of Gilgamesh to the modern age, it was these beings whom the world was predicated on, pillars of whom people of unshakable faith would rely when all hope was lost. And it was these beings who, in turn, granted boons and blessings to their followers.\n\nBut as the wheel turned and the engine rose, the shackles of the divine had lost their grip upon the Earth. The Enlightenment and subsequent schools of thought exposed the fundamental flaws underpinning the deific theocracy — that the gods' existence were built on belief itself. And without this belief, they could be killed or crippled — like mortal men.\n\nBut to undermine a god to the point of its nadir, you must destroy the belief that gives it form.\n\nThese concepts were purely theoretical — until they weren't. The world was torn asunder by the Second World War, and beneath the surface of the veil the Seventh Occult War ravaged across Europe with intense ferocity. It was during these times that mankind came to understand the strength of divinity, and as the Axis Powers began to dip their toes into controlling this untapped well, the Allies took heed. Although no major deific weapons were ultimately used in combat, this event opened a new Pandora's Box of horrors onto the Earth.\n\nIt has been over half a century since that point. Humanity has successfully built its Tower of Babel, and now we stand among the heavens looking down upon all that once stood above. But humanity, as it is, is no monolith — and if we do not maintain cohesion among our nations, we are surely to find ourselves planted firmly on the soil, a foreign tongue in each of our mouths.\n\nWhile working for us, you will see men of great faith die horrible deaths. You will see blasphemous rituals, absurd caricatures of lofty beings, and horrors beyond the mind's eye. You will see weapons forged in holy calculus and guns pointed at the heads of the demiurge. But throughout all of this, you must remember one thing, and one thing only:\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nIf you can kill it, it isn't a God.\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"modalsignature\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6659/DoTT-White.png style=\"width: 15%; float: left; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 30px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 200%;\"]]**Director Muhammad al-Taqi**[[/span]]\n[[size 150%]]{{Office of Tactical Theology}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Overview]]\n\n**The Department of Tactical Theology** (sometimes referred to as \"The Office of Tactical Theology\" and abbreviated as the \"DoTT\") is the branch of the SCP Foundation dedicated to strategically handling, containing, and utilizing religious anomalies. Established in 1951, the department aims to use research in the study of divinity to identify religious or belief-based threats to the Veil and combat them.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6659/DoTT-White.png| caption=The Department of Tactical Theology Logo| width=200px\n]]\n\nThe Department of Tactical Theology is divided into various subdivisions that handle different responsibilities. These subdivisions are usually headed by their own department leads, and are either focused on handling anomalies associated with particular religious groups or over-arching theological topics. Over time, subdivisions may be created, merged, split, or disbanded in accordance with new theological developments and research.\n\nThe distinction between The Department of Tactical Theology and its older counterpart **The Department of Theology** lies primarily in their purposes. The Department of Theology handles the research and historical aspects of the study of religion and the divine, while The Department of Tactical Theology applies them in containment efforts. This distinction means that while there is some overlap in personnel and purview, a majority of responsibilities are evenly divided between the two groups.\n\nThe current headquarters of the Department of Tactical Theology is **[https://scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-reliquary-area-27 Reliquary Area-27]**, located in Ottawa, Ontario. The Department also possesses various outposts, testing grounds, and observation posts, as well as an additional Area in the Middle East. Approximately five hundred and fifty personnel are employed by the department, a majority of which are stated at Reliquary Area-27.\n\n+ The Field of Tactical Theology\n\nIn the context of the anomalous, the phrase **//tactical theology//** refers to a wide range of interaction with the divine. Usually, this is in the context of militaristic strategy, although it has been used in other contexts as well, such as occult rituals or demonic contracts. What //is// and //is not// \"tactical\" theology is contested, but the general consensus is that the field encompasses most things that involve dealing with the divine in a concrete, scientific fashion.\n\nWhile the SCP Foundation is the largest power that engages in the field of tactical theology, it isn't the only one. Other Groups of Interest (most notably, the **[https://scpwiki.com/horizon-initiative-hub Horizon Initiative]**) have engaged with tactical theology, and like the Foundation have studied the weaponization of religion extensively. The Horizon Initiative is notable in this regard due to its hostility towards other religious GoIs, alongside its plethora of captured Abrahamic-centric religious anomalies. \n\nOne of the largest distinctions between the SCP Foundation and other GoIs is that the near monopoly the Foundation has on information about the Akiva field (see below). This allows it to wield theology in a much more organized and precise manner, compared to other organizations.\n\n+ Akiva Radiation\n\nOne of the most important discoveries in modern tactical theology is the detection of **Akiva radiation**. Akiva radiation is an (inappropriately named) anomalous field responsible for interactions between faith/belief and reality. The Akiva field is known to have interactions with anomalous particles such as Humes or EVE, though it itself does not have any unique particles. Rather, various factors of the field (such as the magnitude of its vectors in a given area) influence the aforementioned anomalous particles, resulting in changes to the Akiva field altering reality.\n\nAkiva radiation is often referenced when dealing with religious anomalies, as the collective belief of worshipers consistently produce measurable changes to the field. [[[akiva-counter-operating-instructions|Various devices]]] have been created in an attempt to ease the containment of Akiva-based anomalies, with varying degrees of success — however, the problem of generating changes to the field without the use of powerful artifacts or consistent streams of faith (the so-called //**Generation Problem**//) remains a major challenge to consistent containment apparatus.\n\nMost information related to Akiva radiation remains heavily classified. The Department of Tactical Theology has a vested interest in ensuring that information pertaining to the Akiva field and its capabilities are kept beyond prying eyes, even from other SCP Foundation departments. Although the purpose of this intense secrecy is not entirely clear, it is known that the Department has engaged in various methods to keep specific details under wraps — including the dissemination of false information, when necessary.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[tab History]]\n\n+ History\n\n[[div style=\"width: 80%; margin: auto;\"]]\n= Long before the Department of Tactical Theology was ever founded, the tactical use of theology was a powerful and dangerous tool.

Most noted for their monumental plaza and mount architectural structures, Foundation research suggests that the Caral-Supe were the first to utilize consistent and replicable faith-based summoning. \n\nAlthough this summoning method has been largely lost, the presence of organic instruments and human remains suggests a type of harmonic evocation. These tools continue to produce high Akiva readings in spite of Caral's lack of habitation for thousands of years, with the highest measurements originating from instruments found beside a summoning site surrounding a large geoglyph.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0.75\n|arrowoffset = -0.5\n|float = left\n|name = The Epic of Gilgamesh\n|date = c. 2300 BCE\n|summary = First recorded instance of theology being utilized to alter reality.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/gilgamesh.jpg| caption=Tablet V of The Epic of Gilgamesh| width=150px\n]]\n\nAlthough not all events in the Epic of Gilgamesh can be confirmed to have actually occurred, research into the locations described in the poem point to signs of several reality-altering theological artifacts (associated with the goddess Inanna) being used.

Since its outset, the Daevites were highly ritualistic and faith-based, using various divination tactics in and before battle. This led to them becoming a powerful and terrifying force in the ancient world (particularly in Asia), and one of the first groups to explicitly use what we now refer to as \"tactical theology\".\n\nWhat led to the Sarkic Rebellion actually occurring is unclear, though it is known that a \"half-blood\" male slave born to a Daevite mother and concubine father eventually gained extraordinary reality-bending capabilities through unknown means. This individual — who was later referred to as Grand Karcist Ion — proceeded to lead a slave rebellion against the Daevites in the northern provinces of the empire. This uprising — while not destroying the Daevites outright — crippled their empire and led to the formation of the Sarkic religion.\n\nThe Daevites remain a point of interest for the Department of Tactical Theology, as their methodologies, intense faith, and age of their religion made them experts in theological warfare.

As each of the plagues occurred, it reinforced the belief in the divine, generating more Akiva radiation and thus cyclically increasing the intensity of the events. This culminated in the tenth plague, killing all first-borns in the country, allowing for the Hebrew slaves to escape through divine intervention.\n\nTo date, the Exodus represents one of the largest recorded and discussed theological events in history. As confirmation of the event may represent a breach to the Veil, the Department of Tactical Theology has undertaken efforts to suppress historical evidence that the Exodus occurred.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0\n|arrowoffset = 4.5\n|float = right\n|name = Reign of Akhenaten\n|date = 1351–1334 BCE\n|summary = The New Pharaoh of Egypt attempts a powerful ritual.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/akhenaten.jpg| caption=A statue of Akhenaten.| width=175px| align=left\n]]\n\nIn the New Kingdom of Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten ascends to the throne. Upon becoming the Pharaoh, he immediately declares the old gods of Egypt dead, disbands the priesthood, and enforces worship on the sun god Ra, renamed to \"Aten\". Akhenaten then assumes the role of sole High Priest of Aten, undertaking the construction of an unknown ritual (“fed in the darkness of night”) which has been theorized would grant him reality warping capabilities. He is assassinated by two of his children (Smenkhkare and Tutankhamun) before he is capable of completing the ritual.\n\nThe exact details of this event are unclear, but it is presumed that Akhenaten had deduced a number of key principles behind the functionality of the Akiva Field, even if he was not capable of observing it directly. This is presumed possible due to the highly-visible Exodus of Egypt (see above), which is hypothesized to have given rise to Akhenaten's plan to harness the power of theology and belief for his own end means.\n\n= **[https://scpwiki.com/scp-6830 Access File]**\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = major\n|distance = 3\n|arrowoffset = 2.3\n|float = left\n|name = The Late Bronze Age Collapse\n|date = c. 1200 BCE\n|summary = The First Occult War cripples the world.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/mekhaniteempire.png| caption=The extent of the Mekhanite Empire, following the Late Bronze Age Collapse.| width=100%| align=center\n]]\n\nThe Sarkic religion — having grown from a slave rebellion in [https://scpwiki.com/daevite-hub Daevite Empire] — began to spread across Asia between the 16th and 13th centuries BCE. During this time, their influence began to spread across the world, coalescing into the //Kalmaktama// (lit. \"Deathless\") Empire forming from nations under its banner. This empire continued to expand, eventually contributing directly to the fall of the Hittite Empire (who the Hittites referred to as \"the Sea People\").\n\nWith this threat becoming increasingly worrisome to the West, multiple nations united under the forces of the Mekhanites, who believed the Sarkics to be a direct threat to their way of life and religion, which primarily centered around machines and metal. Tensions eventually came to a head sometime around the year 1200 BCE, which ignited the First Occult War.\n\nThe full details of the war have been obscured by history, making factual analysis extremely difficult. However, it is believed that the Mekhanites' utilization of advanced technology allowed them to combat the overwhelming force of the carnomantic Sarkics, including the weaponization of [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2406 colossi] and a substance believed to be \"Greek Fire\".\n\nAfter a very long and brutal conflict, the First Occult War is believed to have ended with a Mekhanite victory, although this is disputed. While the Mekhanite empire did continue for another 1–2 centuries, the toll it took during the war caused it to slowly wither and eventually collapse. Outside of the Mekhanite empire, the world suffered catastrophically, resulting in what is now known as the Late Bronze Age Collapse.\n\nThe First Occult War represented the largest use of tactical theology throughout history, and as a result the Department of Tactical Theology has a vested interest in finding as many artifacts from the war as possible. Many found still contain residues of their former power as Akiva sinks, making them invaluable in the containment of Mekhanite, Sarkic, and Daevite anomalies.\n\nThe war is believed to have resulted in 20–30 million casualties.\n\n= **[https://scpwiki.com/sarkicism-hub Access File]**\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"history-header\"]]\n+ Classical Era\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"history-info-box\"]]\n\nThe Classical Era saw the beginnings of cultural imperialism, primarily through the expansionist efforts of the Macedonian, Roman, Persian, Chinese, and Mauryan Empires across larger territories. This resulted in an increased trade of cultural mores, norms, and (in particular) cross-pollination of religious ideas. Ultimately, these expansions helped to create not only new religious centers and models of worship, but also provided the use of novel rituals and artifacts to control anomalous phenomena in both the newly conquered lands and to provide solutions for those at home.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 2\n|arrowoffset = 2\n|float = left\n|name = Curse Tablets\n|date = c. 500 BCE – 400 BCE\n|summary = Various tablets are proliferated as a means of exacting divine vengeance.\n]]\n\nWhile commonly discovered throughout the ancient world, curse tablets proliferated in greater numbers during the Periclean Age of Ancient Greece. These thin plates, often made of hammered lead, were inscribed with pleas to liminal or primordial gods to counteract or claim justice against deeds in the mortal realms. In particular, the usage of //vocas mysticae// (or secret names used only by the gods themselves) were believed to provoke a response with these tablets placed outside of the typical frame of worship or offering to a deity, and instead were intended to provoke or command the god to do the tablet's bidding.\n\nOf particular interest, there was evidence of active syncretism between the Greek and Romans using these methods to directly call upon the gods of the //Egyptian// pantheon. The most notable example comes during the Peloponnesian War, where the use of a curse tablet created by a Spartan commander invoked the wrath of Sekhmet upon Athens, was believed to have directly caused the Plague of Athens in 430 BCE.

The aggression between Mekhanites and Jews was believed to be incredibly high, to the point that Jews often faced difficulty leaving their homes. It is believed that the Mekhanites engaged in this persecution because Jewish belief was antithetical to the beliefs of Mekhanism; namely, the Jewish belief that God was indivisible.\n\nAs the persecution grew more intense, a holy man named Enoch sought to create a golem to protect the Jewish populous of the town. The Mekhanites retaliated with brass automatons, and in an effort to prevent the destruction of the synagogue, Enoch took the scrolls of the Torah in the synagogue, spliced them into 999 pieces, and inscribed the Tetragrammaton on each, which he used to summon more golems. \n\nIn the end, the war between the Jews and the Mekhanites came to a conclusion when all the automatons and golems were destroyed, save for a single //hybrid// creature, which attacked both groups.

Lakshmi would typically directly intevene in these conflicts, turning the tides of losing battles and bolstering successful ones. These victories allowed Skandagupta to gain a measure of fame that lived on within Hindi literature and dramatic works. His likely death in 461 CE was the beginning of decline for the Gupta Dynasty, and further fragmentation and invasion of its previous lands would follow.\n\nThe exact reasons for Lakshmi's intervention remain unknown.

At the suggestion of Alcuin, a Northumbrian scholar to his court, Charlemagne sent further missionary forces from Lindisfarne on several occasions to further eradicate pagan worship in Scandinavia. The unnamed völva were said to each carry three wooden staves of great power, all hewn from the charred bulk of Jôrmunr to invoke Óðinn's power directly during the raid, and then vanished into a cloud of ravens as the Viking ships finally departed at the raid's conclusion.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = major\n|distance = 3\n|arrowoffset = -3.2\n|float = left\n|name = The Crusades\n|date = 1095 – 1291 CE\n|summary = The Pope declares a \"holy war\" to take Jerusalem.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/urban2.jpg| caption=A statue of Pope Urban II.| width=200px| align=right\n]]\n\nUnder the direction of Pope Urban II, a military expedition consisting of volunteers throughout Western Europe is mobilized, with the intended purpose of assisting Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in fighting the Seljuk incursions in the region.

Over the next two centuries, another seven major Crusades would be called by Papal authority to support the established Outremer Kingdoms (Jerusalem, Antioch, Edessa, and Tripoli), along with later calls to challenge the Ottomans, Cathars, and Emirate of Granada, which were sanctioned by the Vatican as well.\n\nWhile there are records of combatants across these conflicts attempting to directly utilize theological or ecumenical weaponry, rituals, or divine intervention (particularly in the First through Fourth Crusades, which saw the largest scale of conflict), there is no indication that any divine authority responded to the efforts to change the outcomes of the conflict. The reason for this is still unclear.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0.1\n|arrowoffset = -3.3\n|float = right\n|name = Antarctic Artifact\n|date = c. 1100 CE\n|summary = An unknown group or ritual creates a theological weapon.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/itsbetternottoknow.jpg| caption=The artifact.

Although not initially intriguing the expedition members, the artifact caught their interest when one of the member began experiencing hallucinations and nausea upon inspecting it. Shortly thereafter, another member retrieved the artifact and brought it to a temporary containment facility in Antarctica.\n\nPreliminary analysis of the object showed various remarkable abnormalities. First, the object had extremely strong ambient Akiva vectors — reshaping Hume and EVE particles in its immediate vicinity in an extreme and chaotic way — yet could not be explicitly tied to any known religion. Second, the spear was constructed of beryllium bronze (an anomalous substance frequently employed by the Mekhanites), and yet likely originated in East Asia during the 10th or 11th century based on dating and small engravings. Finally, its presence in Antarctica was suspect, as the surrounding area it was discovered in continued to behave strangely, indicating some significance to the location itself, despite no other human-made structures or artifacts being found.\n\nSix days after initial discovery, power in the facility failed for thirty-six seconds, and all monitoring equipment for the item's chamber deactivated. The item was no longer present when activity resumed. As of writing, the SCP Foundation and Department of Tactical Theology have not found any additional indications of the significance of the object or its current whereabouts, with only the vague understanding that it represents a weapon used for theologically significant purposes.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = major\n|distance = 0.4\n|arrowoffset = -1.8\n|float = right\n|name = The Mongolian Conquests\n|date = c. 1155-1227 CE\n|summary = Ghengis Khan makes a pact with Tengri to conquer Asia.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/burkhankhaldunmount.jpg| caption=Mount Burkhan Khaldun| width=100%|align=center]]\n\nIn the middle ages, a youth named Temüjin is born to the Borjigin Clan in Mongolia.

This includes the remains of a physical gateway within the Great Enclosure of the structure, which was used for travel into the spiritual plane by the Svikio (the spiritual practitioners of the Shona). \n\nFurther study continues to suggest that many of the trade partners previously acknowledged by archaeological surveys were actually contacted through the spirit realm rather than through physical means, demonstrating an extraordinary level of shamanistic ability by the Svikio.

Under the increasing threat of the pogroms, Rabbi Yehudah Loew ben Betzalel (also referred to as //The Maharal//) constructs a Golem out of clay, and animates it using an unknown ritual that concludes with the inscribing of the Hebrew word אֶמֶת (//emet//, or \"truth\") on its forehead. It is now known that The Maharal hid the seventh key for the [https://scpwiki.com/scp-3457 Rite of Solomon] inside the Golem, which granted it immense thaumaturgic capabilities while alive.\n\nAlthough the events of what occurred after are unclear, at some point The Maharal was forced to deactivate the Golem. To achieve this, The Maharal erased the letter Aleph from the word אֶמֶת on its forehead, resulting in it now spelling מֶת (//met//, or \"dead\"). The Golem then deanimated, becoming inert. In an effort to conceal the true nature and location of the Golem from non-Jewish authorities in the region, The Maharal hid the Golem's remains — along with the seventh key — in the attic of the Old New Synagogue.\n\nDuring the Seventh Occult War, the German Obskuracorps attempted to steal the seventh key from the attic, which incidentally revived the Golem.

Salvationist sects continue to operate to the modern era, but contemporary dharmic nullification procedures are sufficient in suppressing efforts to nurture the revival of the Wusheng Laomu, or the synthesis of an alternate vehicle for the Maitreya Buddha and subsequent eschaton.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 3\n|arrowoffset = 3\n|float = right\n|name = The Summoning of Hermes\n|date = March 10th, 1722 CE\n|summary = A bet between philosophers turns deadly.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/johntoland.jpeg| caption=Portait of John Toland.| width=175px|align=left\n]]\n\nIrish Rationalist Philosopher of the Enlightenment John Toland is killed while attending a salon featuring several famed occultist and esoteric figures of the era (including Marie-Anne de La Ville and Jacob Bruce). Attendees of the salon were discussing works and merits of Hermeticism when an unknown thaumaturgist who was present claimed that, after extensive studying of the so called //Emerald Tablet// or لَوْح الزُّمُرُّذ, he was able to summon the Greek god Hermes. Toland, who was famously skeptical of most mystical religious belief, then encouraged the man to display this ability, wagering with his friend Baron d'Holbach that nothing would happen.\n\nThe unknown thaumaturgist proceeded to call support from other Hermeticistic practitioners in London, undertaking the ritual in the basement of the townhouse holding the salon. Witness accounts note that although a divine being answering to the name Hermes was summoned successfully, the being immediately departed after claiming to be 'far too busy for nonsense like this', but promised a replacement who was not.\n\nA second being then appeared within the summoning circle, surrounded by several leopards and dancing 'wild' women (presumably the Maenads), who answered to the name Dionysus. While at first genial and amused by the apparent wonder of the thaumaturgists and onlookers, Toland's continued derision of 'theatrical tricks masquerading as divinity' provoked the being's rage, and the philosopher was set upon in a frenzy by the Maenads and torn to pieces.

Initially beginning only as two factions of thaumaturges attacking one another, many anomalous groups quickly folded onto the sides of one or the other, spiraling the battles into a full, blown-out war. The anomalous world was plunged into chaos due to the intense ferocity and sheer number of magic-users, with estimates placing 93% of the anomalous world having some stake in the conflict.\n\nIt was during this conflict that the Rite of Solomon — a powerful thaumaturgic ritual — was rediscovered by a German cabal operating under the name //The Godless//. On October 13th, 1868, part of the ritual was enacted, but instead of controlling the summoned demiurge, the group destroyed it. Unbeknownst to most, this entity was responsible for limiting the anomalous influence of thaumaturgy on the world, and with its death, the wells of thaumaturgy suddenly opened. This resulted in a massive spike in anomalous activity worldwide, resulting in immense casualties and damaging both sides to the point where neither side could continue the war, ending it in 1869.\n\nIn 1870, various prenormalcy groups (such as the American Secure Containment Initiative) came together to establish a centralized normalcy organization which would become known as The \"Special Containment Procedures\" Foundation — or SCP Foundation. This group's creation would establish the Veil, begin suppression of the anomalous, and ultimately lead to the status quo of normalcy across the world.\n\nAlthough rarely discussed amongst contemporary sub-Veil scholars, the Sixth Occult War was a massive turning point for not just the anomalous world, but also theological thinking as a whole. With the death of the demiurge, many members of the anomalous world began to realize that Enlightenment perspectives on nadirosis — the study of killing gods — was not purely theoretical. This realization would soon unleash the potential of \"tactical theology\" upon the world — beginning with the Seventh Occult War in 1939.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0\n|arrowoffset = 3.8\n|float = right\n|name = Definition of the Akiva\n|date = 1871 CE\n|summary = Divine presence is numerically quantified for the first time.\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/samuel_menorah.jpg| caption=Samuel Birnbaum's menorah.| width=200px | align=left\n]]\n\nIn an attempt to scientifically prove that the Sixth Occult War had not killed the Abrahamic God, the Qabalist Samuel Birnbaum numerically quantified divine presence for the first time, by placing a Menorah on a scale within a glass case, and comparing the rate at which olive oil burned within it at various locations. Funded by his collegues in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Birnbaum travelled to the Ottoman Empire to perform further sampling, and observed the same quantity of fuel burning for 7 times longer in Jerusalem than it lasted under otherwise identical conditions in southern Spain. Based on this research, Birnbaum defined one \"Akiva\" as the typical amount of \"divine presence\" in the City of Jerusalem.\n\nIt should be noted that Birnbaum was unable to access the Temple Mount, which has even greater levels of Akiva radiation than the surrounding city. Since only a small number of locations have a higher ambient Akiva field, the centiAkiva was adopted by occultists as a standard unit of measurement.\n\nIt is unclear why Birnbaum chose to name his newly defined unit of measurement after the Rabbi Akiva ben Joseph, an influential Jewish scholar executed in 135 CE, but comments made later in life indicate that Birnbaum wished to honour his own Jewish ancestry.

One particular occult legend caught their eye: the Rite of Solomon, a theological ritual that was purported to be capable of transforming a human being into a god that could bend the laws of Thaumaturgy. This led to the Nazis seizing various Akiva-infused artifacts that would aid in this ritual — including six of the seven \"keys\" needed to control the newly-born god — which inadvertently alerted other occult groups of their activities. These groups banded together to form the Allied Occult Initiative (AOI), kicking off the Seventh Occult War.\n\nAlthough the Obskuracorps possessed six of the seven keys necessary, the last key was possessed by the AOI within the reanimated Golem of Prague, making it impossible for the Nazis to complete the ritual properly. As the war progressed, it became clear that in order to perform the ritual, the keys would need to be artificially recreated. After the SCP Foundation learned of their activities and joined the war on the side of the AOI, the Obskuracorps recognized that their time was limited, and thus attempted to perform the ritual on January 11th, 1945.\n\nAlthough the first part of the ritual was successful in converting an individual into a demiurge-like being, the second part — designed to control it — failed, allowing the being to rampage freely across the area while killing many Obskuracorps officers. Through the combined effort of the AOI, the SCP Foundation, and various other occult groups, the demiurge was neutralized on January 12th, 1945, through the use of a thaumic eigenweapon.\n\nWhile this event led to many major geopolitical shifts beneath the surface of the Veil (such as the founding of the [https://scpwiki.com/groups-of-interest#global-occult-coalition United Nations Global Occult Coalition]), one important consequence was the newly named field of \"tactical theology\" gaining immense traction in occult academia. A number of groups have attempted to mimic the efforts of the Obskuracorps since the end of the Seventh Occult War for various purposes, but with the SCP Foundation and Global Occult Coalition in control of the artifacts and means to reproduce it, it is unlikely that the Rite of Solomon will ever be completed again.\n\nModern consensus between Department of Tactical Theology academics suggests that the second set of keys produced by the Nazis failed because they did not act as Akiva sinks; or, in other words, that no one had faith they would be effective.\n\n= **[https://scpwiki.com/scp-3457 Access File]**\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = minor\n|distance = 0\n|arrowoffset = 1.9\n|float = right\n|name = The Second Coming\n|date = July 28th, 1945 CE\n|summary = Jim Davis is born.\n]]\n\nThe Second Coming of Jesus occurred on July 28th, 1945.

Although very few knew of the Akiva Field (let alone how to properly use it), the use of religious weaponry throughout history inspired the United States government to attempt to wield it in the war efforts. The most notable of these tactics was the use of (what is now referred to as) \"Akiva Seeding\", a process of spreading an aligned deity's artifacts throughout the war zone in an attempt to encourage divine intervention (and discourage the intervention of enemy-aligned deities).\n\nThe SCP Foundation — which had been monitoring conflicts extensively in the aftermath of the recent occult war — took interest in the tactical use of Akiva radiation. After a four month thorough study, Joshua Aronson presented his findings to the O5 Council for review, positing that Akiva radiation was likely to see increased use by para-militaristic organizations (such as the Global Occult Coalition). After a 8-1-4 vote, the O5 Council approved the creation of the Office of Tactical Theology.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0\n|arrowoffset = 0\n|float = left\n|name = Grinch's Ultimatum\n|date = December 26th, 1957\n|summary = A malevolent entity is banished through mass-publication.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/thegrink.jpg| caption=Theodor Geisel's depiction of the entity shortly after the attack.| width=300px\n]]\n\nTheodor Geisel, better known by his pen name Dr. Seuss, suffers from an attempted possession by a powerful entity.

This came to a head when the entity appeared to Geisel in place of his own reflection, where the entity is believed to have exploited Geisel's lack of holiday spirit to gain control of his body.\n﻿\nAlthough Geisel was able to temporarily ward off the entity, the experience left him terrified of further possession attempts. As such, Geisel spent the following weeks crafting a simple yet moderately powerful religious doctrine, created to more permanently ward off the entity and hopefully prevent others from falling victim to its possession attempts. Crafted in a style of Geisel's other works, the doctrine easily spread throughout the continental United States, becoming one of his best-selling works. This publication is also believed to be the most effective application of tactical theology by a civilian in the modern era, as further accounts of this entity have diminished to near zero. \n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = major\n|distance = 0\n|arrowoffset = 4.5\n|float = left\n|name = The Apotheosis Experiments\n|date = 1958–1968 CE\n|summary = The Office of Tactical Theology attempts to create a god.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/akivareading.jpg| caption=Junior Researcher Jackson Riley attempting to measure the Hume output of an experiment.| width=250px]]\n\nOne of the most important goals set out by the early Office of Tactical Theology was the successful synthesis of a god. The theory was that, with enough trial and error, one could study the birth of a divine entity in a controlled environment, and hopefully learn how to control it. This major leap in development towards the birth of new gods and control of old ones would allow the Foundation to gain an extraordinary advantage in not only containment efforts, but also conflicts that may arise between religious organizations.\n\nAlthough apotheosis //was// eventually synthesized, the so-called \"Apotheosis Experiments\" never achieved what they set out to do. While the understanding of Akiva radiation had gained significant funding and made decent progress, many of the mechanisms underpinning apotheosis were very poorly understood or misrepresented in early literature. This caused significant problems for the team, resulting in many workplace accidents and — in one notable instance — the eternal damnation of a junior researcher, who remains irretrievable to this day.\n\nThe Apotheosis Experiments came to an explosive conclusion in 1968, when Joshua Aronson, the Department Head, was inadvertently exposed to extreme concentrations of Akiva radiation in a short time span (~50-75x magnitude increase in <.3s) while deconstructing a potent anomalous artifact. This event was presumed to have caused severe thaumic backlash in the immediate radius of Aronson, resulting in him quickly perishing from what was later determined to be total organ failure.\n\nWhile there is little evidence to support it, a number of individuals have held onto the belief that Aronson's experiment successfully resulted in his own apotheosis. Currently, no evidence exists that suggests Aronson became a divine entity, and this line of speculation is generally discouraged by the Department due to the possibility of a self-fulfilling prophecy resulting in retroactive deification.\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0.3\n|arrowoffset = -3.4\n|float = right\n|name = The Horizon Initiative\n|date = 1960 CE\n|summary = A new, Abrahamic-centric GoI is created.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/horizon-initiative-hub/logo5.png| caption=The Horizon Initiative logo.| width=100px |align=left]]\n\nIn the midst of the Seventh Occult War, three individuals — one Jewish, one Christian, and one Muslim — met in a nondescript and unknown location, and began the formulation of a new, Abrahamic movement. Although their plans would not come to fruition for another sixteen years, in 1960 the Horizon Initiative was officially formed.\n\nThe Horizon Initiative was (and still is) a very chaotic and unstable organization, with many internal sects operating independently to one another under the same name. Interestingly, these sects were not divided amongst religions, but rather attitudes towards the anomalous and primary aims and interests. Some sought to destroy anomalous entities, while others sought to harness or incorporate them into Abrahamic viewpoints.\n\nWith the Horizon Initiative's founding and continued activity, tactical theology would begin to see more widespread use, especially under the Veil.

This would allow for the then-Office to receive significantly more funding and resources, as well as many benefits not currently allotted to their group. This proposal also included various restructurings to the Office, including the splitting of the \"Non-Abrahamics\" Sub-division into various other Divisions with more specialized personnel.\n\nOn July 8th of the same year, the O5 Council voted to promote the Office of Tactical Theology to a department in a 6-2-5 vote.\n\nAs per protocol, the newly-promoted Department of Tactical Theology was provided //UL-00915// as a base of operations, now designated [https://scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-reliquary-area-27 Reliquary Area-27].

Doctor Dennison hypothesised that the Akiva field affected the affinity of these entheogen molecules for receptors within the brain. With funding and support from the Department of Tactical Theology, he created a working prototype capable of quantifying Akiva radiation later that year, by observing the effects of the entheogen mescaline on human neurones.\n\nWhile subsequent refinements removed the need to maintain live human neurones in culture, the N-THEO line of Akiva Counters remains in use to this day.\n\n= **[[[akiva-counter-operating-instructions|Access File]]]**\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-end]]\n\n[[include fragment:tactical-theology-history-box-start\n|variation = normal\n|distance = 0.5\n|arrowoffset = -3.5\n|float = right\n|name = The Mount Sinai Crisis\n|date = January, 1988 CE\n|summary = The SCP Foundation, Horizon Initiative, and ORIA stop a cult from performing apotheosis.\n]]\n\nIn 1988, a cult known as //The Sunrise// (GoI-9382, now defunct) created and fortified a stronghold through anomalous means at the historical site of //Dayr al-Qiddīsa Katrīn// (or St. Katherine's Monastery).

These subdivisions are not self-contained units, and often have shared personnel, responsibilities, and purview. A non-exhaustive list of them can be found below.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Display Subdivisions\" hide=\"Hide Subdivisions\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Abrahamics Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Abrahamics%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising that the Abrahamics Division is one of the larger subdivisions of the Department of Tactical Theology because of the prominence of Abrahamic religions worldwide. Due to historical and cultural influences, religious anomalies often originate from the theologies surrounding the Abrahamic cosmology. As a result, nearly half of the anomalies contained by the Department of Tactical Theology are Abrahamic in nature (though this number may be a disproportionate representation of worldwide theological anomalies due to heavy DoTT presence in the Middle East).\n\nDespite the history of often deep and violent divides between and within the faiths which follow Abrahamic tenants, the Division relies on effective communication and cooperation between experts of all faiths and sects in order to combat and contain associated anomalies.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ East-Asian Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20East%20Asian%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe East Asian Division focuses primarily upon Buddhist, Confucian, Daoist, and Shinto traditions along with their accompanying anomalies. While these theologies and cosmologies vary extensively, they share regionality of birthplace as well as a common theme of explaining the relationship between humanity's actions and its suffering. This has provided a framework for many practitioners and adherents to develop rituals and techniques for harnessing cosmic energies and divine aid in the pursuit of more perfect states of being.\n\nThe division — in part due to the extensive differences in theology and traditions within these religions — ends up with fewer focused teams working with strict delineations between duties and specializations compared to other divisions. Instead, researchers and teams take a more holistic approach to individual threats as they arise, resulting in greater breadth and depth of understanding and further tactical opportunities.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Vedic-Indus Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Vedic-Indus%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe Vedic-Indus Division focuses on the expanse of beliefs which have been practiced and disseminated by the peoples of the Indus Subcontinent, primarily the Vedic, Brahmanism, and Hindu traditions as well as the ways in which these beliefs may overlap with other religions. In particular, the rituals described within the Vedas, Dharmasutras, and Śruti texts have been (and continue to be) used by various groups throughout history in order to exercise control over opposing regions and leaders.\n\nThe complexity of theological structures as well as the large population of active worshippers and supplicants have strained this Division's resources to their limits. However, the continued research of this division has yielded some of the most successful Tactical Theology techniques and strategies that the department as a whole uses to confront anomalous threats worldwide.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Shamanic/Animism Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Shaminism-Animalism%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe Shamanic & Animism Division focuses on the broad scope of thematically similar but regionally diverse indigenous practices. While culturally, these practices tend to vary dramatically from each other's place and time, there is a shared commonality of belief in a spiritual plane separate from but tethered to our own plane of existence, as well as the understanding that spirits residing in that plane may be either convinced or compelled to enter this reality.\n\nSeparate from designated Tartarean entities, the Shamanistic spirit world is focused upon connections to the natural elements of this reality and are often lacking a strict hierarchical structure, as typically seen with demons. While practitioners and anomalies of this nature are fewer in number, they tend to be extraordinarily complex and powerful in scope, as befitting the ancient nature of many of these theologies.\n\nShamanic & Animism agents primarily focus upon active correction (or 'healing') of ailments created by extranormal factors drawn from the spiritual plane, as well spearheading any Foundation attempts at divination and scrying. It should be noted that all attempts at either spirit walking or oracular foresight must be submitted first for O5 approval.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Neopaganism Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Neopaganism%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe Neopaganism Division is involved with perhaps the widest variety of religions in the department. Handling anomalies from Wicca, Kemetism, Hellenism, Luciferianism, and others, the Neopaganism Division is tasked primarily by specialists, researchers, and practitioners of \"pagan\" religions that have seen revival in the modern age.\n\nDue to the revival of various formerly prominent Neopagan religions, multiple previously-neutralized anomalies and even //new// anomalies have begun to appear. This poses a significant issue for the department, who has begun pouring more resources into Neopagan anomaly containment, sometimes even co-opting specialists from the Department of Theology (or even unrelated areas of the Foundation) should they possess the requisite knowledge or skills.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Parareligions Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Parareligion%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe Parareligions Division handles religions that are, in of themselves, considered to be anomalous. This classification is assigned if the religion is centered around an anomaly, heavily intertwines anomalies in its practices, or is otherwise incompatible with the understood modality of Akiva studies. Some examples include, but are not limited to, [https://scpwiki.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub Mekhanism], the [https://scpwiki.com/sarkicism-hub Nälkä], the various [https://scpwiki.com/fifthist-hub Fifthist] groups, the [https://scpwiki.com/second-hytoth-hub Church of the Second Hytoth], and others.\n\nAs they handle anomalies associated with parareligions, this division is also typically responsible for communication between the Department of Tactical Theology and other Groups of Interest, particularly [https://scpwiki.com/horizon-initiative-hub The Horizon Initiative] and [https://scpwiki..com/oria-hub ORIA]. Communication between the groups tend to be infrequent, hostile, and spontaneous, requiring specific members of the division to be trained in diplomacy and deescalation in case of unexpected contact during missions.\n\nWhile this division also provides assistance in dealing with small anomalous cults, situations involving these are typically handled by other departments.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n++ Demonology Division\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tactical-theology-hub/TactTheo%20Demonology%20Small.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n\nThe Demonology Division studies, classifies, and combats anomalous entities that utilize or are formed by Tartarean Resonance Energy. These beings — referred to as Tartarean Entities — are present across numerous religions, taking names such as \"demons\", \"akuma\", and \"rakshasas\".

Shortly following the start of the Korean War, Aronson leveraged the conflict and increasing prominence of the field of tactical theology to convince the O5 Council to create the department.\n\nAs an atheist physicist without formal training in theology, Aronson made a number of questionable decisions in the early days of the department, such as creating an \"Abrahamics\" Division (ignoring the differences between the different religions), composing the staff primarily of atheists, and not giving proper credence to a number of religions, primarily East Asian in origin.\n\nIn 1968, Aronson was involved in one of the largest attempts by the Department of Tactical Theology to achieve apotheosis. The experiment did not properly account for a number of undiscovered factors that influenced the Akiva field, and as a result, Aronson died from acute high-density divinity, Akiva poisoning, and thaumic backlash.

Hey kid, you wanna fight a god?\n\nTactical Theology articles are not unified by a singular canon, but rather a concept that deities are something that can be approached with scientific inquiry and understanding rather than outdated fear or blind worship. There are no restrictions of religion, region, or chronology, and the style of articles vary wildly from serious dissections of belief structures to the Second Coming of Jim Davis. Here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Research Your Topics:** This might go without saying, but writing about religions and beliefs requires a certain level of sensitivity and awareness, particularly for 'living' religions. Making assumptions around stereotypes is not only harmful, it's bad writing. While you don't have to have a full degree in the subject, be sure that what you're writing about is something that you have some understanding of and is not based off misunderstandings of people and their beliefs.\n* **Utilize the Universe:** While there is no strict 'canon', there are quite a few established characters, sites, anomalies, and other various terms in use surrounding the Tactical Theology Department, so feel free to incorporate those that might be helpful. Akiva radiation, Horizon Initiative, and SAPPHIRE exist so you don't have to go through the effort of reinventing the wheel (unless your idea is to reinvent the wheel via anomalous process, then have fun.)\n* **Reach Out:** Talk to fellow authors, especially if they have already written something that really resonated with you as a reader. This is a collaborative writing project, after all!\n\nIf you reach a point where you have established characters, sites, or anomalies that involve the Department of Tactical Theology and would like to add them to this hub, please reach out via prayer or burnt offering to [[*user Yossipossi]].\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n= [[size 85%]]//Ne redeant ad abyssum.//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.history-container {\n    background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent 49.5%, var(--accentColor) 49.5%, var(--accentColor) 50.5%, transparent 50.5%);\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    padding: 0.5rem;\n    padding-bottom: 0;\n    z-index: 3\n}\n\n.history-header {\n    width: 50%;\n    background: #181B20;\n    margin: auto;\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\n    margin-top: 30px;\n    border: 5px solid var(--accentColor);\n    padding: 5px;\n}\n\n.history-info-box {\n    width: 75%;\n    padding: 10px;\n    margin: auto;\n    text-align: center;\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\n    background: #181B20;\n    border: 3px solid var(--accentColor);\n    font-size: 95%;\n    margin-top: -15px;\n}\n\n.history-child-left {\n    left: 2rem;\n}\n\n.history-child-right {\n    float: right;\n    right: 2rem;\n}\n\n.history-container > div:not(.history-header, .history-info-box) {\n    width: 100%;\n}\n\n.history-child {\n    width: 40%;\n    background: #181B20;\n    border: 3px solid var(--accentColor);\n    padding: 10px;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    text-align: center;\n    transition-duration: 0.1s;\n    transition-delay: 0.4s;\n    margin-top: 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    position: relative;\n    z-index: 1;\n}\n\n.history-child-normal {/* Normal CSS applies.
