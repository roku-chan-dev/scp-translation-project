The success of SPC-507 against prominent threats is as follows:\n\n1. **“__RED NETHER__”**\n\n> **Selachian Threat Description:** RED NETHER refers to Deviant-Type Selachian entities that manifest in nearby universes to prepare for the eventual arrival of the Mistaken Beast. RED NETHER are known for their overly aggressive exhibitionist courtship rituals. These rituals can create lightning storms, even in the vacuum of space.\n> \n> The Centre pilfered several Sharkicist manuscripts during the Seventh Deviant Crusade, and inside these documents, found references to RED NETHER entities as angels and acolytes. During field incidents, however, Centre Pugilists have consistently gone on record to describe these entities as demonic, passive-aggressive, and even sassy.\n> \n> **SPC Impact Rate:** [[span class=\"rev-green\"]]HIGH[[/span]]\n\n2. **“__WHITE NETHER__”**\n\n> **Selachian Threat Description:** WHITE NETHER refers to a massive Deviant-Type Selachian entity with the ability to travel between universes. WHITE NETHER reports typically include references to its ontovoric tendencies -- the Selachian consumes copious amounts of matter during its hunts. Whether these tendencies exist for survival, sport, or carnal purposes is as-yet-unknown.\n> \n> Sharkic cultist holy scriptures avoid reference to WHITE NETHER when possible. When mentioned, WHITE NETHER is given the moniker “The Great Daemon”. Its goal has not yet been determined, as all attempts at communication have resulted in summary digestion. All Centre Pugilists encountering WHITE NETHER have gone Missing in Pugnātion.\n> \n> **SPC Impact Rate:** [[span class=\"rev-red\"]]NONE[[/span]]\n----\n+++ Specific Project Components\n----\nSPC-507, code-named EAGER NETHERENDER, is an ongoing pugilistic operation co-developed by the Centre, Poseidon Laboratories, and [[[spc-1258|the Liberated Cetacean Union]]] (LCU). The focus of SPC-507 is to find, track down, and pummel RED NETHER entities and deter -- or neutralize -- the WHITE NETHER threat.\n\nTo that end, SPC-507 makes use of four sub-components:\n\n||~ Sub-Component ||~ Function ||\n||~ Fractal Acclimation/Spatial Heuristic device (“FASH”) || A long-range scanner capable of locating Deviant-Type Selachian threats in nearby universes. Developed with the help of Poseidon Labs. ||\n||~ Tyson Ontic Pugnātor || An experimental Deviant technology capable of opening portals to different branch universes by punching through the dimensional barrier. Developed by Dr. Mike Tyson, PhD. ||\n||~ “CERULEAN EXPANSE” || Deviant-Type Cetacean entities allied with the Centre. Each Cetacean is trained in specialized Deviant pugilism. The LCU has granted the Centre express permission to use CERULEAN EXPANSE in pugilistic operations. ||\n||~ Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS ||A special forces unit outfitted with biochemical and cybernetic enhancements. The team formed after an abundantly fatal encounter between Marine Fighting Team SCYLLA frogmen and WHITE NETHER. MFT CHARYBDIS is stationed in Kydonia, the Kingdom of Mycenae, in an underwater geodesic dome code-named “BRINE MONASTERIUM”. _\n _\nTheir prime directive is to defeat WHITE NETHER.||\n----\n+++ Enhancement Summary\n----\nCERULEAN EXPANSE (//Supramagnum musculus atlanto//) is the largest species of Deviant-Type Cetacean entities on Earth, capable of atmospheric and exospheric flight via 12 natural ramjet sphincters. The Centre has selected one CERULEAN EXPANSE specimen, named Gægr Kemdulnim The Deep One, who measures 45 m in length and over 180 000 kg in mass.\n\nGægr has been outfitted with an internal cargo bay to transport one Marine Fighting Team, their supplies, and a set of Fish Stick-Class cryogenic units. Gægr has also been grafted with an unobtanium power extractor acting as an added propulsion system, which grants flight speeds of up to Mach 12 (14 800 km/h). He is also equipped with subdermal implants to produce internal oxygen.\n\nHaving served in the Seventh Deviant Crusade, Gægr is a veteran Cetacean pugilist trained in the Deviant pugilistic art of Yzylvin Xa. Gægr is fluent in English, Whalish, Sharkish, and the Cetacean song-language “Balooga”.\n----\n+++ Augmentation Summary\n----\nMFT CHARYBDIS is a team of Centre frogmen[[footnote]]**frogman:** A Marine Fighting Team operator, trained for combat while wearing underwater breathing equipment.[[/footnote]] enhanced with magnesium-titanium mimetic bone implants and muscular grafts extracted from Deviant-Type Selachian entities. After the loss of MFT SCYLLA, CHARYBDIS received further implants in the form of epinephrine emitters that yield a 200% increase in adrenal gland activity during high-stress scenarios.\n\nCHARYBDIS uses prototype NEUROKNOCK powered armour. The armour consists of a high-durability vacuum-sealed tungsten carbide exoskeleton, capable of enhancing pugilistic force by a factor of three. NEUROKNOCK is outfitted with a 12-hr oxygen scrubber and rebreather, heating and cooling systems, digital radio transmitter, and Selachian identification HUD. Each suit is powered with a miniaturized unobtanium power extractor, which fuels a back-mounted rocket pack.\n----\n+++ Deployment Record\n----\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++ Marine Fighting Team Mission Logs\n----\n1. **__Subject__:** SPC-507\n\n2. **__Tour of Duty__:** 5 April – 2 August 2018\n\n3. **__Team__:** Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS\n\n4. **__Team Members__:**\n# **__C-1__ Captain Quinn Griffith** -- Team Lead\n# **__C-2__ Jaedan Traviss** -- Stealth Pugilist\n# **__C-3__ Leah Řezník** -- Parapugilist\n# **__C-4__ Haruki Nakahara** -- Technical Specialist\n# **__C-0__ Gægr Kemdulnim The Deep One** -- Transportation Agent\n----\n**Context:** Deployment records use the following format: Mission Number, Universe Designation, Case(s) of Interest, and Commentary.\n\nA list of notable SPC-507 deployments is as follows.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Mission Number:** 13\n\n**Universe Designation:** Tri-Kaa\n\n**Case of Interest:** RED NETHER\n\n**Commentary:** MFT CHARYBDIS' FASH device detected a RED NETHER incursion in a nearby universe.\n\nOn arrival, CHARYBDIS entered orbit around an Earth-sized terrestrial planet with water covering ~99% of its surface.

WHITE NETHER resembles a Great White Selachian (//Carcharodon carcharias//). It consumes a passing satellite.\n\n**«0:29:47»** Having devoured its meal, WHITE NETHER descends into the atmosphere. C-0 Gægr activates his unobtanium engine and follows from a distance.\n\n**«01:51:55»** WHITE NETHER flies above this Earth's version of Olde New York.\n\n**«01:57:08»** WHITE NETHER pursues the Statue of Liberty. The statue displays various visual deviancies, such as a beak, feathered wings, and talons. Video magnification reveals a note scrawled onto a placard at its base: “STATUE OF LIBIRDY”. WHITE NETHER feasts on the monument.\n\n**C-1 Quinn:** @@[@@//He yells.//@@]@@ You Deviant maniac, you're destroying the Statue of Libirdy!

WHITE NETHER heels to port and knocks debris from the statue, which rains down on humanoid entities below. The entities squawk and flee.\n\n**«02:01:16»** Gægr reels back and rams WHITE NETHER head-on. The Selachian retaliates, spinning to confront him. It swings its tail like a battering ram, slamming Gægr into the ocean.\n\n**«02:01:58»** WHITE NETHER dives into the bay. Gægr bites the Selachian's tail. In the ensuing panic, WHITE NETHER springs up from the water and thrashes, but Gægr holds on tight.\n\n**«02:05:18»** WHITE NETHER pulls Gægr into the city at 200 km/h, and CHARYBDIS follows far behind. The Selachian skims atop skyscrapers; Gægr's bulk destroys buildings and monuments, but he does not let go. WHITE NETHER travels toward a church in the city's residential core.\n\n**«02:07:09»** Gægr opens his jaw, releasing WHITE NETHER, and both smash through a church wall at 250 km/h. A church bell breaks free and lands on WHITE NETHER, immobilizing it.\n\n**«02:09:36»** In a fit of rage, Gægr pinwheels his pectoral fins into WHITE NETHER and lands fifteen rapid blows. WHITE NETHER bites down on Gægr's left pectoral fin, bisecting and consuming it. In a panic, Gægr pushes WHITE NETHER through the church, demolishing the opposite wall. The pair falls into the street.\n\n**«02:10:31»** Gægr chews on WHITE NETHER's tail and plucks it from the caudal keel. WHITE NETHER shines bright red.\n\n**C-2 Jaedan:** Oh, fuck!

He twists his body and angles the unobtanium engine at the Deviant, which activates and destroys the Selachian's dorsal fin. WHITE NETHER thrashes uncontrollably, damaging and disabling the unobtanium engine. Gægr is knocked sideways into a nearby building. Several floors collapse; Gægr falls unconscious. CHARYBDIS surrounds both Gægr and the Selachian.\n\n**«02:13:49»** The engine destabilizes, blasting superheated chemicals onto the Selachian.

He might be a fiend–\n\n**C-1 Quinn:** //Hey!//\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** -- But given the circumstances, even //he// could help us.\n\n**First Avian Entity:** Fine.\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** Some months ago, humanity faced a daring threat and found themselves most unequipped to combat it. Their threat, an innocent memetic agent, proved insidious over time and affected large swaths of their population to no end.\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** That simple hazard turned into a worldwide pandemic. Young parents started feeding worms to their kin. Human language was abolished and replaced with calls and songs. Entire populations migrated hundreds of kilometres south, never to return home. I think some humans even tried flying; you can imagine how that went. These are but a few examples of humanity's vast struggle -- one that consumed their entire species.\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** It was as if one unruly God discarded all that defines humanity and tried to fit something primitive -- something bird-like -- into that gaping hole. Suffering came in waves, and because civilization is suited for humankind and not bird-kind, all societal norms quickly deteriorated. Humanity ceased to be, and even the mighty Foundation fell to its knees. There is no longer such a thing as human.\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** My team and I operate in one of the only minute pockets of normalcy that still exists, alongside a few other untainted resources. It is arduous work, but it is our duty. And I fear our hardships have only just begun.\n\n**C-1 Quinn:** I don't get it.\n\n**Second Avian Entity:** You could never hope to.

Because some Avian phenotypes are natural predators of the common Selachian, GALLINACEOUS STRIFE used Avian entities to neutralize Selachian threats.\n\n**Phase One:** Phase one used Deviant-Type Avian entities, like the “LIMP FIREBIRD”, to engage in the sport of cockfighting with Selachian entities. Phase one was dissolved after an extensive investigation into the project's unlawful and unethical violation of Avian rights.\n\n**Phase Two:** Phase two involved the creation of a dense Avian meme complex (code-named “GAUSS KESTREL”) to neutralize Deviant-Type Selachian entities. Because no actual Avian entities were being manipulated, no Avian rights could be violated. GAUSS KESTREL was dissolved when the Avian meme complex was lost to unknown Extra-Universal forces.\n\nGALLINACEOUS STRIFE remains ON HIATUS to this day.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"oracle-header\"]]\n**Tail-End:** No further transmissions on the current whereabouts of MFT CHARYBDIS have been received.\n\nCICAPOCO is calling on all its resources to form a new Marine Fighting Team for SPC-507.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[div class=\"series-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-3362]]] | [[size 120%]][[[bird|TEAM BIRD]]][[/size]] | [[[SCP-3570|EE-3570]]] >>\n[[/div]]",
