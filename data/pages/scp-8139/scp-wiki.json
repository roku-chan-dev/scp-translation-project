This container (designated CA) is to be placed in the center of an eighty-one square meter room (designated CB), with the ceiling having to possess at least two (2) noble-gas monitors being activated at all times. Absolutely no personnel are to enter CB unless given specific authorization by at least one person of Level 3 clearance, or above. If access is granted, the mandatory Level 5 biohazard suits that are stationed directly outside of CB, are to be equipped before entering. If one or more is to enter CB, the singular bulk-head door attached to the exterior of CB is to be unlocked and opened. This is to be followed by the personnel entering CB, the bulkhead shutting, and then locking behind them. This bulk-head is to be the only accessible point between personnel and SCP-8139; absolutely no observatory windows are to be located on CB due to cautionary reasons. Upon exiting CB, the biohazard suit(s) that were worn are not to be washed nor disinfected, as traces of SCP-8139-1 are currently confirmed to be non-existent outside of SCP-8139's red-zone.  \n\nDuring a confirmed //Usurper-Event// inside of Site-83, any and all SCP-8139-2 instances are to be immediately brought in for questioning and treated with Class B amnestics soon after. Absolutely no personnel are to enter CB for a period of ten (10) minutes, with the bulk-head being sealed shut (if not already). Additionally, absolutely no personnel are to leave Room: A-346[[footnote]]SCP-8139's present containment, and storage room designation at Site-83.[[/footnote]], and On-site security teams are to monitor all movement through CCTV footage around Room: A-346 until total tracking of all personnel in the given area is documented before, during, and after the //Usurper Event//. If any SCP-8139-2 instances are deemed to be unnecessary for any reason, proper amnesticization is to be administered. After that, they are to be put back into their previous work positions (Foundation or not) with no memory of the //Usurper Event//; now released subjects are still to be monitored by On-site security at all times. If any rogue SCP-8139-2 instances are reported and confirmed, they are to not to be administered amnestics, and instead swiftly terminated without need of Ethics Committee approval.\n\nIf any of the monitors/cameras inside CB are reported to be damaged, or lose battery, one (1) Class-D subject equipped with proper protection, is allowed to enter CB under the supervision of at least one Level 3 researcher. If any further damage to equipment is reported via Class-D intervention or other, the perpetrator(s) are ground for demotion or transfer to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4182 other Sites].\n\nBecause of the fairly recent discovery, recovery, and testing of SCP-8139, Mobile Task Force Eta-77 (\"Spheres within spheres\")[[footnote]]The Department of Tactical Theology's personalized operational unit, consisting of fifteen specialized members. All personnel in the task force have expertise in dealing with aggressive or threatening religion-related anomalies.[[/footnote]] is currently pending approval whether or not they could help assist in containment or recovery.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[LEVEL 4/8139 ACCESS REQUIRED]\" hide=\"[HIDE SCP-8139-3 CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES]\"]]\n[[div class =\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"raisa-header\"]]\n++++* Note from RAISA Director, Maria Jones (4/4/24)\n----\nIf any instances of SCP-8139-3 are confirmed or reported, they are to be located, and incinerated immediately.\n\nPersonnel should be advised that any mention of the existence, or implication of SCP-8139-3 to personnel with clearance lower than 4/8139, is ground for [REDACTED]. Absolutely no testing or experimentation are to be done with instances of SCP-8139-3. This is due to fears of a possible large scale //Usurper Event// that could easily take place. Despite possible, useful information, benefited to the Foundation from SCP-8139 (or the SCP-8139-3 instances) they are to be completely ignored in risk of mass death, destruction, and hysteria. \n\nAs for the primary object located inside of CA, and CB, it is for all personnel to believe that the actual anomaly is indeed SCP-8139.  --Search into the actual location of SCP-8139 is currently ongoing.-- \n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n \n**Description:** SCP-8139 is an inanimate 124 cm fish pillow, resembling a green catfish. Its model being identical to that of //Tree House Kids Inc, Giant Stuffed Catfish for Kids//. SCP-8139 itself, is presumed to originate from a Bass Pro Shops store location, in Connecticut, USA. Bass Pro Shops, being founded in 1973 by Johnny Morris, is a non-anomalous outdoor related business, with stores located across the United States. SCP-8139 itself holds no apparent danger to any individual within or outside its four (4) meter detection radius.[[footnote]] Research into SCP-8139's possible sentience is ongoing.[[/footnote]] This radius is referred to as the \"red-zone\", and should be avoided entry at all times without proper biological protection.\n\nIf an individual stays within the red-zone for more than approximately one (1) minute, SCP-8139 will begin to emit a noble gas [[footnote]]designated as an SCP-8139-1 instance.[[/footnote]] from its main body. This process is not fully understood, as the interior of SCP-8139’s model doesn’t allow any space for SCP-8139-1 to originate; nor an opening where the gas could emit into the outside air. Additionally, the amount of SCP-8139-1 expands to a spherical radius of four (4) meters before abruptly stopping; it will then retreat back into SCP-8139’s main body after a ten (10) minute period. This new SCP-8139-1 instance after returning back into SCP-8139, will somehow dissipate completely afterwards, but will remain present indefinitely if an individual stays within the red-zone before leaving. Detecting SCP-8139-1 currently, is done through the multiple noble gas monitors located inside CB, however research has confirmed the gas does not resemble any standard noble gas emission. Although it currently possesses the common attributes of being a noble gas, such as: being invisible to the naked-eye, producing no smell, producing no sound, and producing no taste. Strangely, SCP-8139-1 has no effect from outside sources blowing against it. Testing shows that samples extracted of SCP-8139-1 will instantaneously disappear if it exists outside of the four (4) meter radius (red-zone) around SCP-8139. This makes it extremely difficult to understand more about SCP-8139-1 without causing a //Usurper-Event//; however, it completely contains the instance inside of the radius, causing a sort of self-containment. SCP-8139 and its properties are currently under heavy study, but it’s believed that the SCP-8139-1 instances are cognitohazardous, or possibly memetic in nature. \n\nWhen samples of SCP-8139-1 enter an individual's body, (henceforth referred to as SCP-8139-2 instances) a presumably memetic affect will take hold of their brain, making them believe that SCP-8139 is a sort of god, or other major religious deity. The now SCP-8139-2 instances seek to spread a sort of religious belief centered around SCP-8139. SCP-8139-2 instances regain full memory and have total control over their own actions, the only deviation of their behavior being how they view SCP-8139. This event has been coined as a //Usurper Event//. --Any and all--[[footnote]] See Addendum 8139-C.[[/footnote]]  SCP-8139-2 instances who have been applied amnestics seem to call off all effects from SCP-8139, and their previous religion (if any) will return back to normal. \n\nSCP-8139-2 instances with a previous polytheistic religion will refer to all previously believed gods as a form of SCP-8139, and any atheistic individuals will still strangely be under the effect. As of writing, a total of [REDACTED] persons have succumbed to SCP-8139’s control, with most originating from █████, Pennsylvania[[footnote]]See Addendum 8139-B.[[/footnote]]. Note that instances of SCP-8139-2 constantly, and consistently try to spread their religion despite sometimes lacking proof or reason. --There has been no reported instances of SCP-8139-2 who try to hide their religion from any Foundation personnel--.[[footnote]] See Addendum 8139-C.[[/footnote]] \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8139 was first discovered on 03/31/2024 during a minor infiltration on Site-83. Strangely, the group of five (5) individuals did not try to damage or take advantage of any Foundation equipment that was currently stationed On-site. Rather, SCP-8139 was seemingly delivered as it was placed in an empty containment cell with a hand written-paper note reading the phrase \"Benson\". Security footage revealed that the group stuck together, and expertly traversed through the site without being caught by on-site security[[footnote]] Commanding officer of surveillance and security, Officer Morris, stated that the group were not seen on most of the site's camera's, meaning they had to have somehow known the camera's patterns and blind spots.[[/footnote]]. No Foundation personnel were reported to have been injured during the intrusion, however an estimated nine (9) Foundation employees succumbed to a //Usurper-Event//. All affected personnel were later amnesticized and returned back to their work positions, after authorized testing terminated[[footnote]]See Testing trial 8139-001.[[/footnote]]. When the group attempted to retreat back outside of Site-83, two (2) were gunned down by on-site security, one (1) accidently fell down a flight of stairs near one of the sublevels elevator shafts, and the remaining two (2) surrendered near the site's main exit.\n\n**Addendum 8139-A**\n\n [[collapsible show=\"(Access Interview 8139-A)\" hide=\"(Close Interview 8139-A)\"]]\n\n**Note:** As by order of Recordkeeping and Information Security Administration (RASIA),  Researcher S████, is to be referred to as \"Dr. S\" on file.

Subject was distressed when the other member was accidentally terminated by an On-site security officer. Officer Lane reported to have detained the remaining group member, nearby Site-83's main exit. Interview takes place shortly after termination of Testing trail 8139-001.\n\n**Location of interview**: Site-83’s interrogation cell room 2-A\n\n------\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n**Dr. S**: So, I see that you think this fish toy is some sort of god?\n\n**POI: 5764**: You really think I want to talk to you about this? You literally shot most of my team dead, dead!

I can’t even believe you people, ones who don’t embrace the warm welcome of our god!\n\n**Dr. S**: Do you have a name for this deity?\n\n**POI: 5764**: (Laughs) You really think I can speak to you about what is divine? No mere mortal can speak the name of what is true (stands up from chair) no mere mortal can say the name of that what is truly holy!\n\n//(At this moment Dr. S presses a button underneath the table, alerting nearby security officers to rush into the room. The two guards armed with P90’s, can be seen aiming directly at POI: 5764)//\n\n**Dr. S**: (Calmly) So, what did you say the name of your god was?\n\n//(POI: 5764 freezes and looks down, slowly sitting back into his chair)//\n\n**POI: 5764**: ...Barry the Barracuda…or… I-I call him Benson… because it’s not as long of a name to say. The others, well I d-don't really think they were too sure either. But we had faith! We have to... don't we?\n\n**Dr. S**: Take him back to his cell, I want this interview over with already.\n\n<End Log>\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Note**: I want more information on this theological phenomena, possibly seeing it in action. I know it's against standard practice for a Class C individual as myself to do this, but I need a closer look for understanding. And don't even get me started on how this thing can get the energy required, to produce the gas it emits. If I can get one of those old biohazard suits from over at the Keter-Wing, I'm certain that I could possibly examine SCP-8139 up close. But seeing how worn down those things are, I'd like to imagine there would be a small hole on one. \nJokes aside, I hope this all goes well.\n-Dr. S (04/01/24) \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n--------\n\n**Addendum 8139-B**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[Awaiting declassification for personnel with Level 3 clearance and below] \" hide=\"(Close Incident 8139-1-A log)\"]]\n\n----\n [[span style=\"color:red\"]] [[size 1.5em]] Record Log of Incident 8139-1-A [[/size]] [[/span]]\n----\n\n**Date**: (04/02/24)\n\n\n**Note**: The following is a video transcription of MTF Gamma-4's (\"Green Stags\")[[footnote]] A Mobile Task Force that specializes in forested areas, as well as tracking and locating anomalies in natural environments.[[/footnote]] recovery mission relating to SCP-8139.

They're tasked with establishing a perimeter and assessing the situation, as well as providing additional manpower to other task forces when they arrive.[[/footnote]] was deployed to the area. Meanwhile, On-site mechanics tried to get communication with the initial team up and running again. When MTF Delta-4 arrived at the location, MTF Gamma-4 was spotted on an open field with twenty-three (23) unknown objects surrounding the area as well. During this time, junior researcher, Dr. Bagely, was spotted inflicting damage upon many communication based machinery On-site. When taken in for questioning, it was revealed that he had been under the influence of SCP-8139 through unknown means. A short investigation revealed he had been a participant during Testing trial 8139-001, as he suffered through a //Usurper Event// during the recent infiltration at Site-83. Despite prior amnesticization, he had still been deduced as an SCP-8139-2 instance[[footnote]]Dr. Bagely's designation at time of testing, being SCP-8139-2-1.[[/footnote]]. Due to this inconvenience, communication with MTF Delta-4 was also deemed impossible, leaving both groups stranded, provisionally. When communication was back online, MTF Delta-4 was ordered to land one (1) of their helicopters on the field to recover the initial team. \n\nGroup operative of MTF Gamma-4, \"Alpha\", escorted an unknown individual wearing a gas mask onto the recovery helicopter. Additionally, group members \"Bravo\" and \"Echo\" also transported a miniature black body bag with an unknown object inside, mentioning that it should remain sealed until it's placed somewhere secure. When both teams arrived back at Site-83, the body bag with the unknown object was quickly sealed into an emergency containment cell until further notice. As for the unknown masked individual, they were later identified from many sources, as head researcher of SCP-8139, Dr. S.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n---------\n\n**Addendum 8139-C**\n\n [[collapsible show=\"[Awaiting declassification for personnel with Level 3 clearance and below] \" hide=\"(Close Interview 8139-B)\"]]\n\n**Note**: After Dr. S was taken into Site-83, an expedition team was sent out to the initial field, finding all twenty-four (24) deceased Foundation personnel.

We do not go gentle into that good night. The Foundation may have overwhelming power and authority over us, however that never stopped most anomalous, or non-anomalous religions from being destroyed. They still prevailed, and so shall we.\n\nWe may not be the oldest, the biggest, nor the most powerful, but our indomitable spirit will always prevail in time. \n\nIt's humorous, isn't it. Humanity's worst enemy in any conflict is not their foe, nor their lack of power in battle, but time. How the Romans eventually had their empire decay, the great [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140 Daevite civilization] gradually sub siding. The Foundation will be the same, but //we will not//. I'm sure a Foundation operative is going to discover this file. Hell, this might even link into our lord's article for all I know. The recent SCiPnet system errors have been a real pain. But this is no joke. I already have the mandatory resources, I'm still trying to spread The Religion through word of mouth with my colleagues. However, despite my undying faith in my lord, I'm still sort of surprised that I was a simple non believer only today. But this may be the only window of opportunity I have to bring him to The Alter. He has told me where to go. \n\nI have to put my faith into him, we all do-don't we? \n\nThere's supposed to be some cross test coming soon with 343, and I'm willing to admit I might have to take drastic measures.\n\nWe may not be the most powerful,\nBut David defeated Goliath in the end.\n\nWe may not be the oldest,\nBut I assure you that we will be the last.\n\nAll hail the Messiah.\n\n-Dr. S (04/01/24)\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8138]]] | SCP-8139 | [[[SCP-8140]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
