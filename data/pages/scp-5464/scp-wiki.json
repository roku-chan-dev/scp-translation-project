It is to be monitored for any changes.\n\nShould SCP-5464 enter its activation phase, MTF Omega-6 (\"Bearly Enough\") is to locate the entity through the GPS tracking device implanted in its posterior and monitor it until the phase ends.\n\nAll SCP-5464 activities are not to be interfered with in any manner. Any attempts to interfere with such on account of any party are to be prevented by MTF Omega-6 (\"Bearly Enough\").\n\n**Description:** SCP-5464 is a male Syrian brown bear (//Ursus arctos syriacus//), measuring approximately 182 cm in height and weighing 230 kg. During its inactive phase, SCP-5464 bears no anomalous traits and behaves in the same manner as a standard member of its species.\n\nSCP-5464 will enter its activation phase, manifesting its anomalous traits, at the inception of an event of historical or political significance to Poland. In this phase, SCP-5464 will demanifest from its current location and will manifest in a place of significance to the inciting event, becoming an ongoing active participant. Though testing has found that SCP-5464 exhibits no signs of higher intelligence on its own, it has been found to be able to speak and coordinate its actions in such a way that benefits the country of Poland.\n\nHuman subjects that are unaware of SCP-5464’s true form, or that lack memetic resistance, will be unable to perceive it as such; the typical subject will invariably perceive and describe SCP-5464 as a human of generally uniform appearance. This effect is similarly present in all media depicting SCP-5464.\n-----\n**Addendum 5464-1:** The following is a collection of confirmed SCP-5464 manifestations.\n\n[[div class=\"table3\"]]\n||~ **Timeframe of Manifestation** ||~ **Form Described** ||~ **Actions Undertaken** ||~ **Additional Notes** ||\n|| Unknown, most likely ~ 1380-1420 || Unknown || From gathered historical data, Foundation researchers have deduced that SCP-5464 acted as a leader of the Polish army during the Battle of Grunwald. || The legion led by SCP-5464 and an unidentified Lithuanian individual supposedly turned the tide of the battle in favor of Polish forces. ||\n|| 1463-1543 || Nicolaus Copernicus || SCP-5464 wrote the work titled \"On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres\", creating the heliocentric theory in the process. || SCP-5464’s work was branded as heresy by the Catholic Church at the time, leading to the near execution of SCP-5464; this execution was prevented, however, when an unidentified German individual intervened and allowed SCP-5464 to escape. ||\n|| 1867-1935 || Józef Piłsudski || SCP-5464 was engaging in political actions which resulted in the liberation of Poland from German and Russian occupations. || SCP-5464 was often observed multiple times in the company of its dog, named \"Pies,\"[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Polish for \"dog\".

Following SCP-5464’s retraction from political affairs, a Foundation operative impersonating Lech Wałęsa was inserted in SCP-5464's place; family members and relative documents were similarly fabricated. ||\n||||||||= [[[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|DATA EXPUNGED]]]]||\n[[/div]]\n-----\n**Addendum 5464-2:** On 01/01/2000, the following message was detected within the proximity of SCP-5464’s containment cell[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] SCP-5464 was, at that time, undergoing multiple tests.
