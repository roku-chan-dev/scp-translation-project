Objects relevant to Incident 4852.7 are stored in Site-19 Evidence Locker 38E.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4852 was an event that occurred on January 18th, 2013, that consisted of Foundation Site-19's Research Wing A spontaneously manifesting a proportionately sized pair of legs, superficially resembling those of a domesticated chicken. Research Wing A, provisionally designated SCP-4852-A, used these legs to tear itself from the rest of Site-19 before turning and running in a southwesterly direction at 21 km/h. A research conference had been scheduled in the wing, resulting in several prominent personnel gathered in the area during the event.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 4852.1\n+++ {{AUDIO LOG 1}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **T-MINUS 176 MINUTES, 26 SECONDS**\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n= **__MIC 1__**\n\n**BRIGHT:** Got any sixes?\n\n**CLEF:** Nah, go fish.\n\n**KONDRAKI:** This game sucks.\n\n**BRIGHT:** I'm trying to enjoy my break.
