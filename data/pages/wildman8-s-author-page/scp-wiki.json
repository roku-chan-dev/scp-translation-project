I’ve been an avid reader of SCPs since 2015, but only started writing my own in 2018. Since then I’ve created all sort of anomalies, from giant bacteriophages to time travelers. I don’t really have a consistent theme or topic of interest as far as I can tell. I just write about whatever comes to mind. Feel free to check out my completed articles, along with whatever I’m currently concocting in my [*http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/wildman8 sandbox page], and let me know what you think!\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCPs:\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Wildman8\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"scp\" order=\"rating\" prependLine=\"||~ SCP ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Last Comment ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%commented_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Collaborations:\n\nI worked together with Heshman96 to create [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3727|SCP-3727]]].\n\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
