If anyone's curious it boils down to:\n\n-Tilda David Moose's real name isn't actually Tilda Moose. They, and others, use codenames once they've joined the Foundation so as to make it more difficult to target them with magic without their \"true names\" \n\n-Tilda's reason to defect from the Serpent's Hand was being aware of an imminent apocalypse they joined the Foundation to try to avoid. This is also why they worked on SCP-003 and SCP-1985.\n\n-Upon defecting from the Serpent's Hand Tilda removed information from their brain that would be harmful to the Serpent's Hand, but wasn't careful about it, accidentally removing some personal connections as well.\n\nAnyway, I'm not necessarily going to use that in my own interpretation of the character, which already diverges from thedeadlymoose's somewhat, but I did want to share it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n++ Unreality\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[[the-blank-page | The Blank Page]]] [[collapsible show=\"►Fun Fact\" hide=\"▼Fun Fact\"]]\n* A piece about writer's block which helped me get through my writer's block at the time. \n\n* Unintentionally a piece about identity.\n\n* One of the earliest pieces of Unreality after Deptcon.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[[SCP-7195]]] — Alex Thorley Gets A Cat [[collapsible show=\"►Fun Fact\" hide=\"▼Fun Fact\"]]\n* My first SCP!\n\n* This article is inspired by my cat Wiley, and uses his photo here as well.
