Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 (aka \"They're on our side, Sir!\") has created a media campaign informing the public that SCP-1532 is an illegal company guilty of mail fraud, and that all copies of SCP-1532-b should be turned over to the proper authorities as soon as possible. Any instances of SCP-1532-b are to be found and destroyed, and Class-C amnestics are to be given to any witnesses. Any suspected instances of SCP-1532-a found outside of Foundation custody are to be captured and tested to confirm or deny if they are SCP-1532-a. Confirmed instances of SCP-1532-a are to be kept for study or termination as necessary. Instances of SCP-1532-a may be tested in conjunction with other SCP objects by personnel with Level 5 clearance.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1532 is an unknown facility that artificially creates and sells human beings. SCP-1532 will advertise itself by spontaneously generating catalogs (collectively referred to as SCP-1532-b) in the mailboxes of residential addresses across the U.S.A. and Canada. Tests of these catalogs show that they are not anomalous and are printed on normal rotogravure paper with ordinary printing ink. SCP-1532-b instructs the reader to create a human being by selecting a large number of available traits and writing them into the order form in the back of the catalog, then mailing it in using the included pre-paid envelope. Individual traits found in SCP-1532-b have specific prices, with the average purchase costing [REDACTED] per human purchased. Purchases can be paid for either by including cash with the order form or by writing in a credit card number on the form, in which case the appropriate amount of money will be removed from the bank account and transferred to an unknown destination. Tests have shown that SCP-1532 only accepts United States or Canadian dollars for cash payments, and will accept all major credit cards.\n\nWhen an SCP-1532-b order form is properly filled out and placed in a mailbox, it spontaneously disappears within six hours of placement. Three to five weeks later a human being identical to the order placed (collectively referred to as SCP-1532-a) is delivered to the address of the sender by a blue van with the words “Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium©” painted on the side. The van spontaneously appears eight kilometers away from its destination, drops off an instance of SCP-1532-a, and then disappears after traveling another eight kilometers. All attempts to follow or track the van have failed.\n\nInstances of SCP-1532-a appear physically indistinguishable to normal humans; however, they all share certain properties that make them possible to identify and locate. All instances of SCP-1532-a have an identical fingerprint pattern, which has been given to police forces across the continental U.S. under the pretense of a missing person. All instances of SCP-1532-a are completely sterile and unable to sexually reproduce. DNA tests of instances of SCP-1532-a shows that they all contain an identical specific non-coding sequence on Chromosome 19 that is not found anywhere else in nature.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 1 \" hide=\"- Hide Addendum 1\"]]\n**Addendum SCP-1532-1:** Excerpts from SCP-1532-b:\n\n+++ __**Skeletal System:**__ Every new human needs to start somewhere, and here at __Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium__©, we start with the skeleton.

This version included several new traits not found in previous editions. The new edition also included a telephone number for “customer support”. The customer support number is fifteen digits long, significantly longer than any normal telephone number for the North American continent. Attempts to trace the phone number have failed. The following is a log of a phone conversation between Dr. C████ and one or more unknown entities. Dr. C████ was instructed to prolong the conversation for as long as possible to maximize potential information gained. Due to the context of the conversation and the distinct change between the voices from the other end of the line, it is most likely that at least three separate individuals spoke to Dr. C████, hereafter referred to as Entity-1, -2, and -3.\n> **Entity-1:** Good Morning, thank you for calling Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium, my name is Ted. How can I help you?\n> **Dr. C:** Hello, Ted. May I ask where your facility is located?\n> **Entity-1:** Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium is located at one-four-three Short Street in Lempster, Wyoming.\n> **Dr. C:** And where is Lempster, Wyoming located?\n> **Entity-1:** It’s on the map, sir. Just west of New Dunsmouth, and south of Pale Sun.[[footnote]]Both names did not correspond with any city or town found anywhere in the United States.[[/footnote]]\n> **Dr. C:** Do you have longitude and latitude coordinates?\n> **Entity-1:** I’m afraid I don’t have that information. Do you have a specific complaint about one of our products? Because I have other customers on the line.\n> **Dr. C:** Yes, actually. I recently bought a human from your company, but he died after less than a week.\n> **Entity-1:** Can I have the product’s name and the delivery address?\n> **Dr. C:** He was purchased as “Test Subject One” by my company [REDACTED].[[footnote]]Test Subject One had been purchased by a Foundation front company (see interview 1) and had been terminated prior to this call.[[/footnote]]\n> **Entity-1:** Okay, here we go. According to our records, the product was alive and healthy when it was delivered to you.\n> **Dr. C:** Yes, I know that. But it just dropped dead yesterday.\n> **Entity-1:** Are you sure the human had access to food and water?\n> **Dr. C:** Yes.\n> **Entity-1:** Did you physically harm or damage the human prior to its death?\n> **Dr. C:** No.\n> **Entity-1:** Do you still have the body?\n> **Dr. C:** Yes.\n> **Entity-1:** Well, the best I can do is allow you to send the body back to us for a discount on your next purchase.\n> **Dr. C:** That’s unacceptable. I want a replacement.\n> **Entity-1:** I’m not authorized to issue a replacement, sir. Would you like to talk to the manager?\n> **Dr. C:** Yes, please.\n> **Entity-1:** Please hold.\n> [audio on the other side becomes famous classical pieces being played by a jazz band for approximately ten minutes]\n> **Entity-2:** Hello, thanks for calling Dr. Gale’s Human Emporium, my name is Clair.

[laugh] Just follow interstate twelve south from Pale Sun and you’ll run right into it.\n> **Dr. C:** Interstate twelve doesn’t run through Wyoming.\n> **Entity-2:** Are you sure you're looking at a current map?\n> **Dr. C:** I’m sure.\n> **Entity-2:** Well, I’m sorry. But unless you can return the human to our factory, we can’t offer a replacement.\n> **Dr. C:** That’s unacceptable. I demand to speak to your superior.\n> **Entity-2:** All right, if you insist. I’ll transfer you, but it might be a while before Dr. Gale answers the phone.\n> [audio on the other side becomes famous classical pieces being played by a jazz band again for approximately one hour, twenty minutes]\n> **Entity-3:** What speaks to I?[[footnote]]Linguistic analysis of Entity-3's syntax shows that Entity-3 is significantly less fluent in English than Entities-1 and -2.
