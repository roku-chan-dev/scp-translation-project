He rested his head on his hand and looked at Sheldon with eyes drowning in affection. \"... I'm happy that I met you, Sheldon. You really are special, you know that?\"\n\nSheldon could not help but blush, looking away bashfully before downing his last bottle of cider. \"Thank you, Ansiel... I'm happy that we got to know each other a bit better.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sheldon...\" was all Ansiel could say as he sighed dreamily.\n\nFrom across the table sat Adrian, looking at the lovey dovey, hopefully soon-to-be, couple. Adrian finished another bottle of Brimstone™ chocolate liquor and nudged their boyfriend, Morningstar. \"You seein' this shit, Big Guy? This fuckin' date is going SO well.\"\n\nMorningstar, one of rare straightedge denizens of Hell, quietly ate his sundae and nodded. \"Yes, this has been going... better than I expected.\"\n\nAstia, drunk and having just polished off a bowl of Angelic Century Eggs, snickered. \"Aww Star, //mea duria columba,// are you disappointed that you didn't get to shoot anyone tonight?\"\n\n\"No, I just didn't think Ansiel and Sheldon would get along this well.\" Morningstar said as he ate the last remaining skullberry on his sundae. \"I'm glad to be wrong.\"\n\nAdrian snuggled up to him, cooing into Morningstar's chest. \"You are //such// a fuckin' softie... ya know, it's my favorite thing about you, Big Guy.\"\n\n\"...Thank you, Adrian.\" The large bearded vulture smiled, as he reached down to hold Adrian close to him.\n\n\"Aaaand... my second favorite thing about you is your absolutely, enormous, massive co-\"\n\n//\"Adrian\"// Primrose firmly interrupted, trying her best to not slur her speech, \"this is a high class restaurant, let us show some decorum here.\"\n\nThe paralegal imp scoffed. \"Aw come on, I mean, look at those two over there, they're practically moments away from fuckin... //fuckin'.\"//\n\nAdrian pointed to the pair at the other end of the table, so wrapped up with each other to pay any attention to anyone else, they swapped stories, laughed together and every now and then they would touch, first small and subtle but now much more bold.\n\n\"I admit...\" Primrose began as she swirled around an empty bottle of cider. \"This is going even better than I thought. I am glad those two are hitting it off.\"\n\nShe breathed a sigh of relief, as reassuring as she was to Sheldon prior, she could not help but worry that //something// would go wrong tonight. Luckily, its been smooth sailing so far, all Sheldon and Ansiel had to do was close out the night.\n\n//Simple...// Primrose thought to herself. //NOBODY could possibly mess this one up...//\n\n//...right?//\n\nAnsiel reached up to squeeze Sheldon's upper arm affectionately and giggled softly. \"You wanna know something, Sheldon? I knew you were special the moment I saw you.\"\n\n\"Like... when I sat on the chair?\" asked Sheldon, his head swimming in the warm buzz of alcohol and Ansiel's voice.\n\n\"No, from the moment you //walked into the room,\"// Ansiel moved his chair closer to Sheldon, barely inches away from his face. \"Fear is something we Mammons take great pride in cultivating as part of our professional and personal image. Intimidation, after all, is just another way for us to get what we want. Charm and seduction may have its place... but at the end of the day we need to flex our muscles to show who was really in charge.\"\n\nAnsiel continued, \"but you... you were different. You weren't afraid of me at all, not even a bit, you just strolled into that test chamber like you owned the damn place, like you owned... //like you owned...//\"\n\nHe lost focus when he realized just how close he was to Sheldon. Ansiel reached forwards with his hand to cup Sheldon's face gently. \"... You never saw me the way that everyone else sees me. I was never really a 'Demon' to you... was I?\"\n\nSheldon reached up and held Ansiel's hand. He felt so warm. \"No... I didn't think of you as a 'Demon'... or some kind of nebulous anomaly to be afraid of,\" he gently rubbed the bug demon's chitinous hand. \"You were another professional, one who clearly outclassed me in experience and skill. I... only wanted to prove myself. To prove that...\"\n\nSheldon paused, his train of thought having been completely derailed by Ansiel's large eyes staring into his. Sheldon's breath held in his chest as they shared in a silent moment, merely observing each other... //feeling// each other.\n\nSheldon breathed in and the smell of flowers was stronger than it ever was before.\n\n//He even smells beautiful...// was all Sheldon could manage to think.\n\nAt the other end of the table, the four demons could only watch the unfolding romance in front of them with rapt attention. Astia held onto her wife's hand and watched with baited breath as Sheldon and Ansiel held each other.\n\nAnsiel was inch himself closer to Sheldon, his heart pounding as loud as a cannon. \"S-Sheldon... I...\"\n\nSheldon Katz was quiet, it had been too long since he felt the warm touch of romance in his life, he still couldn't believe his luck that someone as gorgeous as Ansiel actually wanted him that way.\n\n\"... I... want...\" Ansiel was so close now, their lips almost touching, Sheldon wanted to reach out, to embrace Ansiel against him, to feel his warm demonic body pressed against his own.\n\nSheldon was trembling, he closed his eyes and leaned forward, his lips open and-\n\n\"...I want you to join Mammon Industries™.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nFrom the other end of the table, the four other demons watching this were as stunned as Sheldon Katz was. Their mouths agape and their eyes wide.\n\n\"...What?\" was all Sheldon could mutter.\n\n\"I told you this before Sheldon, when we first met in that test chamber,\" Ansiel continued, \"you're too good to be wasting your time with these frightened apes jumping at shadows. Mammon Industries™. That is your true home, Sheldon. That is your true potential. That is your true chance at //real// power.\"\n\nSheldon pulled his hand away from Ansiel's and sat up straight. His face hardened as he processed what his supposed lover had just said.\n\n//Of course...// he thought to himself, //I was so stupid...//\n\n\"Ansiel, are you- was this always just about business from the beginning?\"\n\n\"What? N-no- I mean- Well... Yes but...\" Ansiel was panicked now, tripping over his own words.\n\nSheldon's brow furrowed as he felt anger stabbing it's way into his heart. \"Ansiel, was any of this... real? Was all this just some ploy for you to con me out of my soul?\"\n\n\"C-Con you?\" Ansiel said, eyes open with shock. \"I've //never// attempted to deceive you before, I... I told you, Sheldon, I was being honest... I told you before... I hold a lot of //professional admiration// for you.\"\n\nSilence, again. Sheldon could do nothing but stare at Ansiel.\n\n//\"... Professional admiration?\"// Sheldon finally said in utter disbelief. \"I... I... thought... I thought...\"\n\nFrom the back, Adrian bit into their knuckle harder than they've ever done before. Morningstar grimaced and held his boyfriend closer to him. Astia's eyes were wide, she covered her own mouth with both hands and slowly shook her head. //\"Oh, no, no, no...\"//\n\nPrimrose pinched the area between her eyebrows and swore under her breath. //\"Fuck...\"//\n\n\"I thought you //actually// liked me, Ansiel.\" Sheldon's voice trembled as he spoke. His emotions enflamed by alcohol. \"... It's just like before, you're just buttering me up, making me drop my guard... until you decide to try and make your move and try to devour my soul for //yourself.\"//\n\n\"Wh...?\" Ansiel eyes narrowed, his voice soft and far away.\n\n\"I knew... the contract you offered me years ago, //I knew\"// Sheldon said as he reached for another bottle of hard cider. \"You changed the terms half way through negotiations, you thought I didn't notice... but I did.\"\n\nHe opened the bottle and took a deep swig. \"You almost got me then, but I am //not// stupid enough for you to try that on me again.\"\n\n\"No! that's not- that's not what I wanted- that's-\" Ansiel stood up, his wings buzzed in spasms, he was panicked and if he needed to breathe, he would have been hyperventilating. \"S-Sheldon, please believe me you've got the wrong idea! You've got-\"\n\nBefore he could continue he felt a warm, furry hand on his shoulder. Primrose has gotten up and brought her chair with her. Putting it between Sheldon and Ansiel. \"I think... we should all take a deep breath, calm down... and talk.\"\n\nAnsiel slowly sunk down to their seat and put his head in his hand. Sheldon was almost slumped over, his hair a mess and his eyes red.\n\nMorningstar brought his chair over to Sheldon so that Adrian could hop up and pat his back.\n\n\"Okay,\" began Primrose as she took a deep breath. \"We are all... fairly drunk and emotions are high right now, we may have said some things that were... poorly phrased, but let us all calm down and take it from the top.\"\n\nShe turns to Sheldon. \"You claimed that Ansiel was attempting to 'devour your soul' and that he had... attempted to do so in the past? Could you elaborate on that?\"\n\nSheldon turned to look at Ansiel, who was rubbing the gold hoop of his collar, now more out of nervousness than anything else. Sheldon took another drink and cleared his throat.\n\nHe began, \"When we first met, we were negotiating a contract. I tried to find terms that were favorable to the Foundation. Something we could use to our benefit at minimal loss. This was prior to Tactical Theology so... none of us knew what the fuck we were really doing or getting into. Fuck, we weren't even sure if it was a demon behind that desk or not.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I was young and insecure, I just wanted a big win. Something to prove I was valuable. As we continued negotiations, he... praised me. Ansiel told me that he was impressed with what he saw in me. That I had 'razor sharp acumen that few people, let alone mortals, possessed.' That my talents were being wasted with my current occupation... that I deserved better...\"\n\n Sheldon rubbed his eyes, \"I knew it was just manipulation, I read his file, I knew what was going on but... it got to me. I started to believe him. To let my guard down. He went on that spiel about power and Mammon Industries™ and my true home and 'professional admiration' and... I bought it.\"\n\nHe turned to look at Ansiel, for a moment their eyes met before Ansiel turned to look away.\n\n\"I told him... I would consider it, so we negotiated a new contract, one for my employment at Mammon Industries™. As time went on and we kept writing and amending the contract I realized... something wasn't right. Ansiel was changing the language of the contract subtly, a word here, a comma there. I pretended not to notice. I figured if I could catch him in a lie then... I dunno... we could gain power of him somehow? Like I said, we didn't really know what we were doing.\"\n\n\"It's why so much of that contract was arguing over definitions of individual words. I needed to figure out what Ansiel's game was. What he was really after. I never fully figured it out but from what I could recall...\" Sheldon tried to take one last swig of his but found it empty. He set the bottle down and sighed.\n\n\"...If I signed that contract, I wouldn't be employed by Mammon Industries™, instead Ansiel would've gain full possession of my soul and I would either be enslaved, devoured or... both. Mercifully, I passed out from exhaustion and when I woke up in the hospital I realized just how hard I nearly //fucked up.\"//\n\n\"It's why I never told anyone about this, I mean how could I? So I just... requested for transfer and tried to forget about it...\" Sheldon chuckled mirthlessly. \"Well, until you told me that Ansiel had //actual// real feelings for me and wanted to see me again... So much for that I guess.\"\n\nIt took a moment for Primrose and Adrian to process what Sheldon just said. They turned to look at each other, troubled.\n\n\"Ansiel...\" Primrose began, her voice firm \"... Is any of this true? Was this just a ploy to gain possession of Sheldon's soul to begin with?\"\n\n\"I...\" Ansiel was far from the image of a powerful Archdemon, now looking more like a nervous wreck. \"...I don't know, I'm... sorry.\"\n\nPrimrose sighed and rubbed her temples. \"Ansiel... this was going so well, what... what were you //thinking!?//\"\n\nAnsiel was silent as he tugged on his collar's hoop once again, gripping it harder and tighter than before.\n\nAdrian looked at him and scratched their chin. \"...Wait something doesn't add up. What Sheldon told us about that original contract. It would've been a serious breach of company policy to do something like that. You definitely aren't the type to pull that kind of shit, Ansiel.\"\n\n\"That... is very true.\" Primrose said, her brows furrowed. \"Ansiel, this may be a bit of a tall ask but, do you have a copy of this contract? Perhaps a //truncated// copy of it? Could Adrian and I look through it?\"\n\nSheldon scoffed \"Unless he's been carrying around a contract all night hoping for me to sign it, I doubt there's anything further to discuss.\"\n\nAnsiel was silent with an unreadable expression. Without a word he reached into his inner jacket and pulled out a contract folder, bound in smooth red leather.\n\nSheldon could only stare in disbelief as Ansiel slid it over to Primrose and Adrian.\n\n\"Thank you, Ansiel.\" Primrose turned over to her human friend. \"I... truly do apologize for all of this, Sheldon. Give us a few minutes to look through this and if it is as you said... we will leave. //Immediately.\"//\n\nSheldon only nodded quietly, he suddenly felt tired and more drunk than he realized. He let Primrose and Adrian work through the contract as he sat facing away from Ansiel.\n\nHe heard two sets of footsteps approach him and a moment later felt Astia's hand on his back. \"It's alright //mi caprula,// like we promised, no harm will come to you from //anyone.//\"\n\nMorningstar stood next to him, his arms folded and ready to reach for his rifle. \"Yes, should Primrose give us the signal we will transport you back to your world quickly. Your safety is paramount us, Sheldon.\"\n\n\"Thanks you two...\" as much as Sheldon felt thankful that he had two extraordinarily powerful demons as his back up, the thought of both of them fighting Ansiel, that they might hurt him, made his stomach churn.\n\nHe watched as Primrose and Adrian looked over Ansiel's contract. They both poured over each page with the careful, surgical precison he'd come to expect from the duo. Sheldon could not help but notice the occasional moments in which both of them simply looked at a page completely dumbfounded and confused.\n\nMinutes later it was over. Primrose folded the rest of the contract back into it's folder and placed her hands on top of it. She gave her paralegal imp one last look before she took a deep breath, exhaled and turned to Sheldon.\n\n\"Okay, so...\" she began. \"First of all, yes, you were correct to say that there was something wrong with this contract but... it is not quite what you may think.\"\n\nSheldon squinted his sore eyes at Primrose. \"...What do you mean?\"\n\n\"For starters,\" Adrian continued. \"We don't know //what// the fuck this is, and this //definitely// wouldn't hold up in court. Not for a fuckin' second. We're actually kinda shocked Ansiel wrote something like this; this isn't his usual quality of work at all.\"\n\nPrimrose nodded in agreement. \"This is not like any contract you would normally sign with the Mammons. From what I could tell, Ansiel wasn't trying to devour your soul or steal it, in fact you wouldn't be selling your soul at all, to him //or// to Mammon Industries™.\"\n\n\"I... wouldn't?\"\n\n\"No, at some point in the contract all mentions of Mammon Industries™ stop. In addition to that most of the transactional language of these sorts of contracts stop too, instead becoming more about an... exchange.\" Primrose paused and chose her next words carefully. \"You would be... //giving// your soul over to Ansiel //specifically.\"//\n\nAdrian took the contract from Primrose and held it under their arm. \"With wording so vague that the person exchanging their souls could either be you or Ansiel or //both of you.// Which would make this contract, //technically// speaking...\"\n\n\"...A marriage contract.\" Primrose finished. \"Though to your credit, with how it is worded, it could also easily be interpreted as you becoming his slave, or a business partner, or an adopted relative and so on.\" The demon lawyer sighed and closed her eyes tight. \"...Attempting to untangle all of that while drunk may have been the hardest moment in my entire legal career. I am... so //very// tired.\"\n\nSheldon stared at his demon colleague and her paralegal familiar. He was expecting them to start laughing, to tell him it was a joke. Instead they remained silent and groaned in drunken exhaustion.\n\nAny possible anger left inside him had faded. Quickly replaced instead by confusion. He turned to look at his date and found him covering his face with both hands. His wings were once again buzzing hard and from what little Ansiel's face he could see it was flushed with //genuine// embarrassment.\n\n\"Ansiel...\" Sheldon finally said, his expression and voice soft. \"...what... what is it that you //want?\"//\n\nAnsiel tried to speak. To explain himself, that this was just a big misunderstanding. But as he opened his mandibles he found no words. No voice. Emotional turmoil had rendered him mute.\n\nAdrian sighed, stood up, and walked over to him. \"Ansiel, Moneybugs, listen to me...\" The usual cheeky smile was gone from the imp's face, replaced now by a stern expression. \"I know figuring out your //own// emotions isn't your strong suit. The Mammons don't pay you for that kinda shit. But I'm telling you right now that you //have// to do it. This is your one last chance to //unfuck// this whole situation.\"\n\nThey placed the red leather folder on the table in front of Ansiel. \"You don't want to spend the holidays alone again, //do you?\"//\n\nThe imp walked back to their seat and left Ansiel alone with his thoughts. Alone with his feelings. He ran a finger across the smooth leather of the contract folder.\n\n//What was it that I felt...?// Ansiel, closed his eyes and dug deep.\n\nHe thought back to his first meeting with the human lawyer. To all the times since then that he's thought about him. To Primrose and Adrian telling him he finally had a chance to meet him again.\n\nHe thought back to the date. To seeing Sheldon for the first time in years. To being near him. To hearing his laugh. To seeing his smile. To feeling his warmth.\n\n//Feeling...//\n\nAnsiel thought about the feeling that connected all these moments together. He walked through each one and gently tasted it.\n\nIt was as sweet as fresh nectar, and felt like the gentle flutter of wings in his chest. It was a lightness, not so much the lack of weight as it was the relieving of a massive burden he didn't know was there. A bright sparkle and pop that had his heart singing.\n\nHe had never felt this way before, not for anything or anyone. No one ever came close.\n\nNo one... except for Sheldon Katz.\n\nIn the center of that feeling, in the center of his heart, he saw Sheldon looking back at him. And behind Sheldon's eyes... Ansiel saw that exact same feeling glowing right behind them.\n\n//Sheldon... I want...//\n\nAnd then Ansiel realized what he truly felt.\n\nWhat he truly wanted.\n\nThe Archdemon's eyes opened and looked up to meet with Sheldon's. Ansiel opened his mandibles to speak and finally found the right words.\n\n\"Sheldon... I want... you. But not so you can join Mammon Industries™. I want you for... //you.\"// Ansiel stood up, his legs wobbly and arms shaky. \"I'm... so sorry, Sheldon. I've made such a mess out of this dinner. I promised Primrose that I would try and just... not think about business for one second and just enjoy myself for once but... but...\"\n\nSheldon Katz stood up, assisted by Astia. \"Ansiel...\"\n\n\"Business was easy... I understood business, you know? I looked at everything as just another job because... because it helped make //everything// feel easy too.\" He walked closer to Sheldon now, his heels clicking on marble floor slowly and heavily. \"...I'm not very good at this, Sheldon... I thought if- if- I just looked at you as another job then... I could figure out what I was feeling... what I was gonna do.\"\n\nSheldon attempted to meet him half way but as he slowly walked forwards he suddenly became aware just how drunk he really was. He quietly cursed that last bottle of hard cider he downed. \"Ansiel... listen... It's okay, alright? It's... okay.\"\n\nSheldon's head swam as he hobbled forwards. Disoriented and dazed he ended up colliding into Ansiel. The both of them reached out for support and found their hands around each other.\n\nThey stood there silent for a few moments, in a warm embrace, Ansiel ran his fingers through his favorite human's hair. \"... You know, Sheldon. You weren't the only one in that test chamber that day who had no clue what they were doing.\"\n\nSheldon chuckled, mirth having found its way back. \"Well, I'm glad that makes the two of us.\"\n\nAnsiel smiled, and cupped Sheldon's cheek again. \"I think... I think I understand better what I was feeling then. When we first met...\"\n\nAnsiel continued \"I wasn't lying, you know… it wasn't manipulation, I really did mean everything I said then. You really are one of a kind. So intelligent, so brave, so //sharp//. I wanted you then but... didn't understand //how// I wanted you. I thought maybe... I just wanted to recruit you to the company.\"\n\nAnsiel held onto his human lover's head like he would with a precious gemstone. \"But as we started to negotiate I kept feeling so... //jealous.// I didn't want someone else to own your soul. Not the Mammons, not your Foundation, not //God.// No one. No one except for... me.\" Ansiel's voice was only a whisper as he uttered that last word.\n\nThe Archdemon reached for his human's hand and held it tightly. \"More than that... more than any other desire, more than my own desire to posses you... was... w-was...\" Ansiel's hand trembled as he held onto Sheldon's, he brought it close to his chest, up to his neck and looped Sheldon's fingers through the gold hoop of his leather collar.\n\n\"S-Sheldon, I wanted- I //want// you to- to-\"\n\n\"Ansiel...\"\n\n\"//...I want you to own me.//\"\n\nSilence again.\n\nHeavier than anything that ever came before. Sheldon looked at Ansiel, his fingers still hanging onto his collar. Ansiel only sighed and attempted to blink the slowly welling tears in his eyes. \"I-I... I shouldn't... I'm sorry, we can just stop here and-\"\n\n\"No.\" Sheldon gripped onto the gold hoop of Ansiel's collar tighter. \"I don't want us to stop here.\"\n\nAnsiel's eyes were wide open, tears rolled down his cheek. \"W-What?\"\n\n\"Nobody has ever wanted me as much as... you wanted me, Ansiel.\" with his free hand, Sheldon reached up and held the back of his lover's head. \"...Thank you.\"\n\n\"S-Shel-!\" Before he could react he felt a hard tug on his collar as Sheldon pulled him towards himself. Their lips were pressed together as Sheldon held Ansiel as close as he could to him. The demon slowly closed his eyes as he melted into the kiss, gently moaning and trailing his hands all over his human. His property. His treasure. His possession.\n\nHis Owner.\n\nPrimrose and Adrian could not help but breathe a final sigh of relief as they saw the two lovers finally reached each other. Astia shook and sniffed, misty eyed. //\"Ooohh,// oh this is... this is just too precious...\"\n\nMorningstar sat down, finally relaxed. \"Yes, I'm happy no one had to die today.\"\n\n\"...I am... just glad this night has a happy ending.\" said Primrose slumped over and nearly falling out of her seat.\n\n\"Heh, speaking of //happy endings//\" Adrian pointed at couple in front of the group, now making out louder and more vigorously than before. \"should we uh... break this up or...?\"\n\n\"Adrian, //mea catulus,//\" Astia said. \"They both worked so hard to get here, let them enjoy their moment.\"\n\n\"I mean... sure but uh... they're //really// going at it.\"\n\nAstia watched for a few more moments. Soon enough she felt a warm blush spread across her face. \"O-Okay, maybe the happy couple is getting a //liiiittle// too-\" Astia tried to say before being interrupted by the sound of a belt hitting the ground. \"D-Did Ansiel just-?\"\n\n\"Yep.\" Answered Primrose flatly, still slumped on her chair and not moving.\n\n\"W-With just one hand?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"... And now his jacket's off and the tits are free,\" Adrian said calmly. \"You wanna handle this, Primrose?\"\n\nThe jackal demon sighed and summoned Blood Rose into her hand once again, using it pull her self up and as a walking stick. \"Adrian, get the bill, please. Star, Astia, help me separate these two before we get permanently banned from this //very// expensive and nice restaurant.\"\n\nIt took some effort, but eventually they were able to pry the two lovebugs off each other. Though convincing them to keep their clothes on was an even greater effort.\n\nAdrian pulled out the checkbook and tried their best to focus their eyes on the page. \"Come on, Adrian, write the correct amount of zeros here.\"\n\nThey finished, squinted their eyes at the check and cringed. //Ugh, Ansiel, you owe us big time for this.//\n\nThe party soon stumbled out of the gold ziggurat and felt the cold ocean breeze on them. The palm trees swayed in the distance, as if wishing them all a good night.\n\n\"Sheldon, do you require transportation back to earth?\" Primrose said, though she felt that she already knew the answer.\n\nSheldon looked to Ansiel, whose jacket was now unbuttoned and hung loosely over his shoulders, the demon looked at him with a pleading look in his eyes.\n\n\"I... think I'm gonna spend the night here,\" he reached up to twirl his finger around a lock of Ansiel's hair. \"...If you're willing to have me.\"\n\nAnsiel leaned down to kiss his human lover on the top of his head. \"You can stay at my penthouse for as long as you want, my dear Sheldon.\"\n\n\"Well then, I… will pick you up later. Ansiel has my number.\" Primrose turned to look at Ansiel. \"Remember to keep him hydrated, humans still need to water to live, especially after... //physical activities.\"//\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Primrose. I'll take //good// care of him.\" Ansiel giggled and ran a finger down Sheldon's neck. \"Ready to go, my love?\"\n\nSheldon smiled, grabbed Ansiel by the collar, and pulled him close. \"I would love to. //My succubus.\"//\n\n\"UM UH,\" Ansiel stammered, pink in the face. //\"BYEGUYSTHANKYOUFORCOMINGSEEYOUTOMORROW.\"// And just like that, Katz and Mammon disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Off to do who knows what.\n\nThe four found a bench, and collapsed. Resting for just a moment.\n\n\"Well, we did it.\" Primrose sighed, slumped against her wife.\n\n\"What a rollercoaster…\" Astia wrapped her arms around Prim.\n\n\"Worth it though.\" Adrian sat in Morningstar's lap.\n\n\"Agreed.\" Everyone else said in unison.\n\nThere was long, celebratory pause as they watched the sun go out. Dimmer, dimmer, dark. The nighttime sky would be a treat for Sheldon to enjoy after their… planned activities. After a minute, Morningstar broke the silence.\n\n\"I have a question.\" he said, looking at Adrian.\n\n\"Yeah?\" They replied.\n\n\"What's a himbo?\"\n\n//\"...What?\"//\n\n\"Earlier tonight, you called me a himbo. I thought it was some species of bird but you already know I'm a bearded vulture, so it couldn't be that.\"\n\nAnother pregnant pause.\n\nAdrian didn't shift their gaze from Morningstar. They didn't blink. \"Hey, Prim?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" She answered.\n\n\"… I'm gonna fuck the //shit// outta ya brother.\"\n\nPrimrose opened her mouth to say something, before she stopped, leaned back on the bench and exhaled slowly. //\"Cool, have fun.\"//\n\n\"Wait you didn't answer my que-\" Morningstar was cut off by Adrian jumping into his arms, and pulling him into a kiss before they both disappeared in a flash of fire. Nothing left but a few sparks.\n\n\"… Are you tired, //mea rosa?\"//\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you. Still, it was a better first date than what we went through.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not know about that. Personally, I think you threatening to cut my head off with a chainsaw and screaming at me in Latin was //very// romantic.\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it, I was raised Catholic!\" Astia giggled, she pulled her wife in close and rested her snout between Primrose's soft jackal ears.\"Would you like to go home? Maybe we could curl up on the couch, have a few of those special brownies, snuggle…\"\n\n\"I think I would love that.\" Prim smiled. \"Hey, Astia?\"\n\n\"Yes, //mea rosa?\"//\n\nPrimrose sat up and held her wife's hand, and squeezed before giving her a quick peck on the cheek.\n[[=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/sol-invictus/TwoMurderDogsLookAtADeadSun.png]]\n----\n@@ @@\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sol-invictus/offset/5 \"I love you so fucking much.\"]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
