You cannot recall how many hours you have spent meandering between the piles of dirty laundry and the heaps of comic books scattered across the ground. As you walk past yet another empty water bottle, you barely notice an abandoned power cord before tripping on it, which would have meant a deadly fall into the prickly potted cacti below. You ponder: what kind of creature in the entire tree of life could bear to live in such a hostile environment?\n\nFinally, you see it. The door to a mysterious cave in which the dreaded being is said to reside. What unspeakable horrors lie beyond this point, no one knows. You begin to wonder: was it even worth it? Was meeting this secretive creature worth the pain of the journey? Before you can ask any further questions, the door slowly creaks open. Out of the foggy, dusty darkness, the beast emerges.\n\nYou have troubled its existence. And it is not happy.\n\nYou shall now face the wrath of {{REYAS}}.\n\n-----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=room.jpg|caption=What in the world??]]\n\n**Item #:** {{REYAS}}\n\n**Object Class:** Belphegor[[footnote]]The anomaly, being extremely lazy, does not require special containment since escaping would be too much work.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** {{REYAS}} is currently under the responsibility of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-418-fr Dr Vicat]. The anomaly spends most of its time in a rectangular cave filled with miscellaneous items. Should the anomaly gather the courage to leave this area, an emergency notice must be issued to all Foundation Sites and all personnel must be alerted: such an event is extremely rare and might not occur again before hundreds of years.\n\n**Description:** {{REYAS}} is a land-dwelling animal belonging to the species //Homo Clumsylis.// The specimen appears to be male, although not many signs of virility are present. {{REYAS}} can be easily recognized by its characteristic lack of recognizable features: average hair, average size, average build. Being extremely elusive but disproportionately obnoxious when under the influence of substances such as ethanol, {{REYAS}} tends to remain in its usual place of living unless directly instructed otherwise.\n\n{{REYAS}} is known for contributing to an online nerd community known as the SCP Foundation. Although mainly active on the [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com French branch] of said community, it has occasionally been sighted on the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/fr-hub International translation archive] as well as the English branch in very rare cases. The entity cites its thoughts and dreams as its main source of inspiration; given the contents of some of its works, the aforementioned thoughts and dreams are believed by researchers to be highly unusual.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=boxes.jpg|caption=This is just ridiculous.]]\n\nIf threatened or disturbed, {{REYAS}} will enter a state of panic where it will retreat to its residential cave and listen to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-540-fr reggae music] while playing sandbox video-games. In addition, the specimen likes to play the guitar and sing, despite having a very discordant voice.\n\n{{REYAS}} has demonstrated an uncanny ability to make objects disappear by placing them down. Experiments have shown that in 90% of cases, when the entity places an item on a surface without directly looking at it, the item vanishes before manifesting again in a completely different place, minutes to hours later. This is not guaranteed though, and in some cases, the item is simply lost. A proposal has been made to use this power to destroy confidential documents; it is currently under review by the O5 Council.\n\nAs for sustenance, {{REYAS}} is willing to ingest anything that is not a snail.\n\n**Addendum: recorded literary production**\n\nEN:\n\n> * **[[[SCP-5262]]] - It's Brittany Beach!**\n> Even a seagull can fight for Brittany's independence.
