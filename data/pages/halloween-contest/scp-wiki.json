  "content": "++ DEAR GOD, WHAT?\n\nYes, we are running a Halloween Contest! It's... It's not that big or exciting, but I hope you'll participate! The contest is simple.\n\n> * **Write a tale dealing with the SCP Foundation and Halloween.**\n \nSomehow, there is //practically nothing// matching this theme on the site ([http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-097 Shut] [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-330 up], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/trick-or-treat you].), and --the staff-- --several people-- --a couple of us-- **I** think we desperately need more of it.\n\n> **__The Rules__**:\n> \n> # Your tale //must// include Halloween with an SCP Backdrop or The SCP Foundation with a Halloween backdrop. No tales about how 682 was really discovered on Halloween or something like that.\n> # Your tale needs to be a tale. No \"SCP Format, Tagged Tale, Lookit Me!\" stuff. This needs to be a story.\n> # Your tale must have a rating of at least +20 to qualify for the winning prize. If everyone writes crap, no one wins.\n> # You must write something //new//. If you've got something close already on the site, you don't get to enter it just because the contest came along.\n> # No entries will be accepted after October 31, 2012 at midnight, Central Standard Time, because I'm the one running this contest and that's when I go to bed.\n> # The winner will be determined on November 11, 2012 at whatever time of the day I get around to it. No whining.\n\nAfter writing your tale, tag it \"HC2012\" and link it to the bottom of this page! The winner will get to choose one of their writings //currently// posted to the site to be featured on the front page, either a tale or an SCP!\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n++ **__The Winner__**:\n+++  **[[[Treats]]]** by //Dr Gears//\n\n++ **__Runner Up__**:\n+++ **[[[Halloween at S & C Plastics]]]** by //Ihpkmn//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n__**Current Entries**__:\n\n[!--\n\nPut them in order of creation. Don't be a jackass and try to \"alphabetize\" them so yours is further up. \n\nStandard format is: * **Title** by //Author// (Ex: * **Bright the Buttlord** by //TroyL//)\n\n--]\n* **[[[The Last Word]]]** by //Roget//\n* **[[[Bell Weather]]]** by //Etteilla//\n* **[[[Memorandum 10/31]]]** by //SpoonofEvil//\n* **[[[How the SPC Ruined Halloween]]]** by //marslifeform//\n* **[[[The Halloween Breach]]]** by //CryogenChaos//\n* **[[[Costume Change]]]** by //TheGlyphstone//\n* **[[[Ghost Stories]]]** by //PaladinFoster//\n* **--[[[Sweet Memories]]]--** by //Jekeled//\n* **[[[Sympathy]]]** by //Aelanna//\n* //**[[[recuerdos|Los Recuerdos de los Muertos]]]**// by //Drewbear//\n* **[[[Guiser's Night]]]** by //Kalinin//\n[[/div]]\n\nThanks for playing guys! Keep your eyes open for my next contest, starting soon!\n\n-//TroyL//",
