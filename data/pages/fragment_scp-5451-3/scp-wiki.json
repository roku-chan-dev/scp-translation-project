Hosted on the site penguinschool.aq, students interacted with teachers through voice chat along with assignments sent through messaging programs.\n\nSCP-5451-1 were a group of sentient, English-speaking penguins that accessed the internet through anomalous means. Communication with other SCP-5451-1 instances were done through a forum on the site forum.penguinschool.aq. Non-anomalous penguins turned into SCP-5451-1 instances when they came into contact with advertisements made by previous SCP-5451-1 instances. These memetically enhanced advertisements (henceforth referred to as SCP-5451-2) came in two forms, flyers or banner ads, SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B respectively.\n\nSCP-5451-2A instances were flyers composed of feathers that are covered in urea. They were found in penguin mating spots after mating season. Penguins that came into contact with SCP-5451-2A turned into an SCP-5451-1 instance. After one academic year, they were enrolled in SCP-5451.\nSCP-5451-2B instances were banner ads found on the Internet. They took the format of a penguin on the foreground along with the text \"(common name of a penguin) Penguin School, the best University in the country!\", or some variation of the text.\n\nOn 2023/02/01, the forums where SCP-5451-1 instances gathered and used to enroll into SCP-5451 were closed due to a lack of funding.\n\n**Addendum: Final Post of the Forum**\n\nOn 2022/07/11, one day before the closure of the forums, the cessation of all anomalous effects of SCP-5451-2A and SCP-5451-2B, and one academic year before the closure of SCP-5451, a post was made on the forums.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Show Final Message\" hide=\"- Hide Final Message\"]]\n\n> PINNED: Last Goodbyes, or Thanks for all the Fish and Friendship\n\n[[div class=\"post\"]]\n[[div class=\"one\"]]\n[[image  http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5451/Forster.png]]\n##000000| Forster##\n##004670| Staff##\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"two\"]]\n>\n> Hello guys, Forster here.\n>\n>Thank you for all the efforts you have made to continue this forum. From the fundraising, to the efforts of our Marketing college, all of your efforts has been appreciated. It was heartwarming to see all of us as a community try our hardest to keep our community alive even after the loss of funding for our forums\n>\n>\n> Unfortunately, despite all our efforts, the forums will have to be closed, for we were not able to gather enough money to keep the servers up.\n>\n>\n> Don't worry about losing those forum threads, though. They will be archived and kept as they are.\n> Again, thank you for all the memories, experiences, and threads you all have made here. I never would've imagined that this simple forum between staff will grow to have such a tight-knit community.\n> Thank you for everything, and as the great Douglas Adams say,\n> \"So long, and thanks for all the fish\"\n> <3\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n _\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float: left; width: 45%\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[<]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki.net/SCP-5451/offset/1| Go back to the previous iteration?]]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float: right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[>]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki.net/SCP-5451/offset/0| Go back to the first iteration?]]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
