He was on his back, and his lungs were empty of air, and he couldn't move. He felt nauseous. He felt like he was dying. His mind was a blur. He sucked in a breath...\n\n...and he realized he could breathe, and sensation returned to his body. He was hot and sweaty, stuck to the sheet beneath him and...\n\n...the body beside him.\n\nDel sucked in a breath, too, and they both turned to stare at each other.\n\nAnd groaned.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/52-true-art-is-cognitohazardous/DL_52_01_Ibanez_Nascimbeni_Bed.jpg]]\n\nIt felt like someone had taken a wooden tenderizing mallet to all of his muscles at once. The amount of warning signals fired into his brain was overwhelming. He was dehydrated. He was sore. He was exhausted. By the way she shuddered as she rolled and sat up, he could tell Del was going through much the same experience. His skin followed hers for a fraction of a second, and the separation was a sticky //snap.//\n\nThe bedsheets were soaked. It wasn't difficult to figure out what they'd been up to.\n\n//But for how long?//\n\nDel checked the door as Nascimbeni sat up, groggily. His vision swam. He felt faint. He took long, shuddering breaths to force oxygen into his brain, and he said: \"Well.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\" Del pressed her eye to the peephole on the door; they were all at four foot level, specifically to enable specifically her to do this. She frowned. She said: \"Fuck.\"\n\n//Already have been doing,// he almost said, but he wasn't feeling the joke right now. \"What?\"\n\n\"There's a fractal on the wall outside.\"\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nSite-wide containment breaches are no joke, and a number of security measures have been installed to give folks at ground zero a fighting chance should one occur. Cognitohazard filters have been installed in the peepholes on every dormitory room; though necessarily thin and weak, these are sufficient to allow personnel with reasonably high Cognitive Resistance Values to escape the worst of any mind-altering effects that might be blowing through the corridors. Personnel with low CRVs are unlikely to be much help in a breach of that nature, anyway.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"You feeling okay?\" he asked her.\n\nShe shook her head, and ran her hands along her body. She would never be slim, not with her build, but she was slimmer than usual. Nascimbeni knew from the way his chest felt when he breathed that he was nearly skeletal. \"Nothing sucks that didn't suck when I woke up. I think. But that was definitely something memetic. We're going to have to be careful.\"\n\nHe slid to his feet. His knees wobbled fiercely. He tried to maintain his balance. \"When we leave to find the others, you mean.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Which we definitely should do.\"\n\nShe cocked her head at him. \"I'm the Chief of...\" She cleared her throat to obscure whatever she'd been about to say. As if he didn't know. \"...Pursuit and Suppression.\" There was a good chance her error would turn out to be correct, in this deadline, anyway. \"It's my job to pursue the others and suppress whatever the hell is going on out there.\" She paused, made as if to press her ear to the door, then stopped herself and shuddered. \"I hope it isn't memetic. You've got a good CRV, right?\"\n\nHe shrugged. It hurt. \"Better than average. And I've got the training.\" Foundation personnel were trained to recognize potential cognitohazards in their peripheral vision, and unfocus their eyes or look away. It was rarely good enough to prevent exposure, but it could sometimes soften the effects.\n\nDel sighed. \"I'll lead you. Eyes closed.\"\n\nHe grimaced, but didn't argue. His jumpsuit was balled at the foot of the bed, and he picked it up. \"We should search the room first. See if there's any clues.\"\n\nDel was already pulling on her underwear, which had been discarded on a vanity table. Nascimbeni realized that this wasn't her quarters, or his. They were in a standard dorm room, somewhere in the depths of H&S by the configuration. \"Should we, though? We might get exposed to something. Probably better to find Lillian.\"\n\nThat made sense. \"This does sound like a Lillian problem,\" he agreed.\n\n\"I hate Lillian problems.\"\n\nHe agreed with that, too.\n\n[!-- [[=image DL_52_01_Nascimbeni_Ibanez_Bed.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nAfter he was sure he wouldn't throw up, Harry tried to make sense of the conflicting signals.\n\nOn the one hand, the woman in his lap was substantial, silver-haired and blue-eyed behind cat's eye glasses.

From the unsettled feeling in his stomach, it had only gone halfway at best.\n\nShe looked up at him, eyes sparkling cerulean. \"Weird,\" she agreed. She picked at the fabric of his shirt. It was smooth. Silk. \"Can you see in those?\"\n\nShe was looking at his glasses, he realized. He also realized that his glasses //weren't.// The prescription was right, but the frames were all wrong. In fact, there //were// no frames. He reached up to remove them, and brushed his hand against a much neater, smoother beard than he was used to. He left the glasses alone and reached up further, running his fingers through slicked-back short hair.\n\nHe glanced down. He was wearing loafers. He glanced up. Udo was wearing Melissa's favourite orange camisole.\n\nHe took a deep breath. \"I am guessing,\" he said, \"that I look like Dougall Deering.\"\n\nHer wince told him all he needed to know.\n\n\"Then I am //guessing,//\" and he took a deep breath, \"that there's some sort of compulsion effect in... effect.

She was squinting, too. \"Fitter, though.\"\n\n\"You look... rounder.\"\n\nShe winced again, and reached down to test the shape of her hips. \"I haven't ever weighed this much.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever weighed this //little.// Adjusted for, you know. Inflation. Whatever.\" He stood up. \"So, clearly we were crazy. And now we're not.\"\n\n\"Crazy,\" she agreed.

Her reagents pouch was sitting on his dining nook table. \"I know just the thing.\" She squinted again, sighed, and took off the glasses. \"Glasses //and// contacts.

Every wall was a blaze of colour or what was sure to be a literally dizzying array of lines. There were murals on the floor and frescoes on the doors. When she noticed soft music in the distance, growing less soft as they went, she tore off her jumpsuit cuffs and stuck them in her ears. Nascimbeni did the same, keeping the improvised plugs in place by pulling his cap down tight. Two of her best senses self-handicapped, leading a noncombatant with his hands on her shoulders. At least she had her weapon, which she had drawn; she only hoped that if she needed to shoot something, it would be something she could focus on. \n\nShe nearly pulled the trigger when she turned a corner, cautiously, and a shirtless man covered in blood came bounding in their direction, laughing manically. She didn't recognize him. He didn't seem to notice them, just sped merrily on his way, crying \"PRAXIS!\" over and over in hoarse tones.\n\nShe heard something else, even through the fabric padding. Something low and large. She hopped up onto a bench in an inset niche, and pulled Nascimbeni up beside her just in time to hear the rats-in-the-floorboards scrabble of claws on tile. Three mottled brown shapes blurred by them, intent on the chase. They left a trail of blood behind them.\n\n\"I opened my eyes,\" Nascimbeni murmured into the back of her neck.

McInnis had enough mental conditioning to withstand all but the most potent cognitohazards, more in fact than the O5 Council was happy with; he hadn't shared this with the other Survivors, but his stint as Administrator in the first deadline had apparently conferred permanent benefits beyond the norm for Site-43's Directorship. It was difficult to test such things safely -- if a kill agent got through to you, the test ended rather abruptly -- but the experts generally agreed that McInnis' mind was now safe as safehouses.\n\nAs he left his safehouse behind, however, the assaults came hard and fast. He unfocused his eyes, as they were all trained to do, and that was enough to restrict the immediate effects to a faint twitch in his eye muscles and a vague feeling of unease, but he could nevertheless immediately tell that every surface which could support a cognitohazard was already sporting one. Some of them were murals, and some of the murals were quite good. Some were crude in style, sometimes in content as well. All of them seemed at least passively memetic.\n\nHe moved along the outside edge of H&S, noting that the superstructure remained sound and the halls were clear of rubble and corpses. Some of the doors he passed were open, and he chanced a look inside when the angle was sufficient. Most of the dormitories were similarly adorned with art in a wide variety of mediums which universally made him feel light-headed and made the hair on his arms and legs stand on end. Some were occupied: a short, hairy figure pouring mugs of thick black swill for an eager array of swaying security agents, all of them singing off-key; a pair of engineers from Arms and Equipment squabbling over a piece of blue chalk in the middle of a massive schematic sketched on the concrete walls and floors, all the tiles and carpet torn up and piled in the corner; a naked man pulling out his long brown hair at the root, tying it tight to a piece of wooden dowelling, and resuming a hideous demonic caricature on his kitchen table in blood while a hunched red figure cackled with glee (and, as he passed, turned to grin approvingly at McInnis); two more naked men engaged in what he might have mistaken for a less anomalous form of performance art, if not for the fact that the brief glimpse made his temples ache. \n\nSensual kinetoglyphs. Demonic possession. Anomalous engineering. Ludwig. He glanced into one of the common rooms, and saw a shadowplay burlesque on the wall; pitch black silhouettes with tall hats and long sticks, dancing to the stoned half-applause of a drooling cuddle puddle on the floor. \n\nEven in the worst of the deadlines, the problems had been confined to the Site staff.

A little //twist,// and the sprinklers came on ahead. She brought the sand back down, and the water washed the corrupted pigments out of each grain and into the drains set low in the teal tile floors. Up again to stop the flow, then back into formation as a silicon screen between them and the painted unknown, with a little particle excitation to burn off the excess moisture. \n\n\"Okay,\" she said, and without turning to see if he'd heard her she pushed the red wall forward again. It shimmered in the low fluorescents, occluding the path ahead as it scrubbed the almost certainly dangerous images off of every exposed surface. Her training screamed at her every time she caught even the faintest refracted glimpse. \n\nAt least they hadn't met--\n\n> I met you walking beside me\n\nIt was a lovely, lilting voice.

He could get her fired, or even terminated probably, if she acted in too hasty earnest. So the first thing she did was backdoor the Site's travel tracking software, and when she was absolutely certain Marroquin was at a layover halfway around the world and halfway to the security conference he was attending, she made her first move. There had been problems with the Trans-IAAAC Cable of late, and she took advantage of that to cut off his access to 43NET.

Every path to I&T was perilous in a different way, and it was going to be impossible to simply waltz in. \n\nBut they were in the heart of one of the world's most advanced R&D facilities. Every lab and office was potentially stocked with equipment that could allow them to neutralize the threats in their way.\n\nAnd, so, they scrounged.\n\nIt was like cleaning a large, complicated room. They started at a corner -- Lillian's office -- and gradually worked their way outward in concentric circles. The first few days were the worst. Harry lost his eyesight for an hour. Udo's skin broke out in an orange rash. Del was forced to spend an afternoon learning a dance supposedly inspired, somehow, by //Spells of Coming Forth By Day.// (Her instinct was simply to flatten the little cluster of eager participants, but unfortunately their number included all six foot four inches of Howard Yancy, and even if she managed to knock him down, the odds were good he'd simply crush her as he fell.) Nascimbeni was, very briefly, chased by a bear. (He felt certain this honour would have fallen to Wettle, had the hapless chemist been around. Probably he was encountering something worse, wherever he was.)\n\nBy the end of a week, they'd had better luck. Udo was able to secure a supply of diatemaceous earth, which she found much more efficient as a medium for her scrubbing screens, particularly after Nascimbeni added paraindustrial solvents to the mix. Lillian found a half-complete projection system she'd been working on with Bremmel -- not in baseline, but that was fine, since she had her deadline memories anyway -- and when she and Sokolsky completed it, they found it could totally overwrite the visual profile of any rectangular space it was set in. This allowed them to bypass one particularly hinky hall of murals, although they'd need to build a second unit if they wanted to be able to leapfrog.

Udo and Lillian had been repeatedly scrubbing the halls over and over, but it seemed like every time they left, someone new came swooping in with artistic intentions and a head full of dangerous thoughts. Complicating matters was the lack of firearms in the Site; Del had quickly discovered that all her usual boltholes and secret armouries were empty. Radical pacifism was in effect, which was something of a problem given how many carnivorous cryptids were presently roaming the halls.\n\nIt had been Harry's idea to try securing the salt caverns at Archives and Revision. They stretched back for kilometres, and were packed full of material which wouldn't easily support memetic markings. A second safehouse on the opposite side of the facility from Lillian's office was an enticing prospect, particularly as they expected to begin their scramble for SCRAMBLE parts in the next few days, so he'd set off as the expert and Del had tagged along as an expert in violence, tool-assisted or not.\n\nAnd then all the sprinklers had gone off at once, and the entire Section had filled with a hallucinogenic gas. Nascimbeni could still smell it now, a pungent of mix of camphor oil and sulphur.\n\nThey first they'd heard of it was at the top of Zulfikar's lungs. McInnis had left one of the walkies with his assistant, along with instructions to stay put and keep the door locked. It was therefore a mystery why the otherwise level-headed young man had been caught out in the open when the deluge began, with the almost immediate result that he had torn off his expensive silk shirt and begun pounding the tile walls with his closed fists, screaming \"THE MEDIUM IS EVERYTHING\" and \"EVERYTHING IS A MEDIUM\" over and over as his knuckles splintered. The last they'd seen, from the glass double doors to R&E, he'd gone chasing after a squall of tiny pixie-like figures which had been rapidly shifting form and gibbering inchoately. There was still a trail of blood in the teal fluid that now covered every floor surface in the dorms, to mark his passage.\n\nLuckily, Lillian possessed a very large black umbrella.\n\nNascimbeni had insisted on going alone. \"You barely need me anyway, and anyone who could come with is too important to lose. I know where I'm going, and I won't be long.\"\n\n\"That's what Harry and Del said.\" Udo had looked miserable, and she hadn't been wrong.\n\nNascimbeni sighed as he flipped the final switch up and down one last time. So, the masters had been re-routed. The Site's electrics had become yet another crazed art project, or else the sabotage had been intentional. Perhaps the deluge was a coordinated assault rather than some comic book impetus to further creativity. That was interesting, if it was true. He sighed again, picked up his toolbox, and headed for the door where he'd left the umbrella.\n\nHe stopped.\n\nWhatever was in the sprinklers, it didn't smell like camphor oil at all. Sulphur had been the only discernable note.\n\n\"Who's in here?\" He turned back to the master switches, and began opening panels at random. \"Come on.

Balls evolved to not be crushed. That's why one hangs lower than the other. The men who told you that are //liars.//\" He smirked. \"You should kick them in the balls.\"\n\n\"Statistically, I probably did.\" She took another pull on her bottle of gin, and sighed contentedly.\n\nThey were sitting in the back rooms of the Director's Complex. Harry had never been this far into Allan's private domain, and had been surprised to find that it hadn't been Allan's at all. The decor, the furniture, the personal effects; these rooms had gone functionally unchanged since Vivian Scout had died in the mid-1990s. The wallpaper was... well, for starters, there was wallpaper. It was fancy, all dark warm tones and scrollwork. There was oak panelling. There was a coat stand with a very familiar grey overcoat on it, not remotely moth-eaten, and on top, there had been a fedora.\n\nThe fedora was now in Harry's hands. (He'd washed them first.) He rotated it thoughtfully as he clenched and unclenched his upper arm muscles against the comforting bulk of the wine bottle he'd found in Scout's liquor cabinet. \"You ever wonder if we're letting him down?\"\n\n\"I'll drink to that,\" she hiccoughed, and followed through.\n\n\"I'm serious. He had high hopes for us, you know. The young Turks. Gonna make big changes. Shake up the establishment. Twenty years later, and what? We //are// the establishment.\"\n\nDel wiped her lips with her sleeve, which hung loose from her shoulders. She'd unzipped her jumpsuit to the waist. She'd been oddly relaxed ever since the spray outside had settled into a fine, muggy mist. //Del never stops, because she never has to.// Well, now she had to, and she was apparently going to make the most of it. It reminded him of-- \"Speak for yourself. I've still got a skyscraper full of acronyms over my head at all hours. TAD won't tell us what the fuck is going on. O5 won't let us set our own terms. Even Allan isn't telling the whole truth.\"\n\nHarry shrugged. It was easy to shrug in Dougall's silk shirts. He almost thought he could get used to the feeling. \"He's got a lot on his shoulders. And really... isn't he part of the problem?\"\n\nShe peered up at him, eyes already a bit bleary. \"How so?\" The last, barely audible radio call had suggested the halls couldn't be made safe for at least another sixteen hours. Plenty of time to tie one on, and then let it slowly unravel in the usual way. They'd even found a pair of buckets in the Director's supply closet. \n\nHe set the hat down reverently, on a towel he'd spread on the floor in case they needed it to mop up a spill, and took a gulp of the red wine. He'd felt a pang of guilt dipping into the old man's secret stash, even if he was long, long gone, until he'd remembered that he could down the entire bottle and it would still be there come next September. Stalling complete, he presented his carefully curated thoughts. \"Scout wanted us to make the world a better place. Allan was his replacement. Allan was supposed to do what Scout couldn't. I don't see that he has.\"\n\nDel grunted. \"I don't see how he //could.// We're just one Site. You can't change org culture in one lifetime, from one... I don't know. Node? It doesn't work that way.\"\n\n\"It definitely doesn't work when you don't work on it.\"\n\nShe reached over and tipped the bottle back up to his mouth, and didn't let him stop drinking until he'd started to splutter.\n\n\"Alright,\" he said, shaking his head and spraying red droplets in every direction. \"Point taken. We're on break.\"\n\n\"Damn right.\" She reduced the bottle, thick as it was, to the halfway-mark with a Herculean chug her body should hardly have been able to support. \"Of course, //you're// always on break.\"\n\nHe bristled at that. \"You don't need to get personal. Udo...\" He trailed off. He really didn't have anything to say on the matter, at least nothing that would be useful to talk through with Del.\n\nThe little woman's eyes widened. \"I just meant you're lazy, guy. But if you want to cry about your relationship troubles...\"\n\nHe looked away. \"You're intolerable.\"\n\n\"I get more tolerable when I'm incoherent.\" He could hear her attacking the bottle even more fiercely.\n\n\"If you had your pick...\" Harry stopped. He wasn't sure where that had come from. Probably somewhere in the middle of his own bottle.\n\nHis shoulder was shaking. She was shaking his shoulder. \"If I had my pick //what?// Pick of what?\"\n\nHe looked back at her. \"If you could pick anyone, who would you pick? You know.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know. What you mean, I mean. I mean.\" She burped. \"Sex? Yancy, every time.\"\n\nHe opened his mouth, and his brow furrowed, and he didn't ask what he almost asked. \"Okay. Not what I meant. I meant... you know.\"\n\nShe adjusted her legs so she could kick him, lightly, with one boot. \"Stop saying I know. If I knew, I could answer. You mean mushy shit? Who do I want to wake up next to every day for the rest of my life?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\nShe took another long draught of the rum, and because for a moment he forgot who he was talking to, he thought she was taking the delay to consider, as he had done. He thought this right up until the moment that she turned and sprayed the amber liquid in his face.\n\nAnd laughed.\n\n\"Nobody. Somebody different every time. Sappy shit! That's not me.\" She glanced around him, at the hat. \"Did I hit it?\"\n\nHe glanced down. \"Little bit.\"\n\n\"Oh. Sorry.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Not the real hat anyway.\" He pulled the towel out from under it, and began dabbing the rum off his face. \"Aren't you going to ask?\"\n\n\"Ask what? And don't say I know.\"\n\nHe made a face at her.\n\nShe laughed again. \"Who you'd pick? You expect me to ask that out loud?
