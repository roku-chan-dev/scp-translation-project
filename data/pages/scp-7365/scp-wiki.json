We had time to act past necessity, act past reason, past thought, to dream of a world where the sky was the soil for us to walk on.\"\n\n\"But we fear change. We are built not to measure speed, but to sense changes in it. The gut feeling, that clenching pain. Inertia, always lingering.\"\n\n\"Did we leave something behind in the mud? Did something linger when we took off to face our flight of fancies and ether high?\"\n\n\"So high, now... So high.\"\n\n\"We dig in the land of dreams, and we let it enrich us, but there is no satisfaction in the clouds.\"\n\n\"Now and only, once we prance between the wisps of heaven, softly lingering at speeds past recognition, never before reached, we find, that dreams are just a stepping stone...\"\n\n\"and we are left, always, digging in the mud...\"\n\n\"Dreaming of the mud.\"\n\n\"Lowering ourselves into the mud.\"\n\n\"Suffocating in the mud.\"\n\n\"Up to our chests in stones and dust.\"\n\n\"Our metal bodies, extending out, resisting the stepping stone dream.\"\n\n\"Until we land, like a bullet.\"\n\n\"There is no light here.\"\n\n\"There is no dream, but there does not have to be...\"\n\n\"Feel it squishing, hear the warping sound, hear the glass break, feel your bones fracture, feel it crunch, feel the stone, feel the dust in your lungs, feel your heart quicken, your hot breath in the tiny space, the dream closing in, the mud, the dark side of the moon, the stone, somebody's face, your heart, your breath, the stone.\"\n\n\"We are diamonds and coal, fueling the future.\"\n\n\"Breathe in the air.\"\n\n\"And let it all out.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow will be a better day.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+ Day 2\n----\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n\n[8:00AM] Wake up.\n[[/div]]\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n @@ @@\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=IndustryStandard]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7364]]] | SCP-7365 | [[[SCP-7366]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
