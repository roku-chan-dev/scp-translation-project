  "content": "[[span class=\"blackout\"]]Nobody ever expects it, and, let's be honest,[[/span]] you were [[span class=\"blackout\"]]in no way expecting anything to happen of note today, given the emptiness not only of the day but of[[/span]] your whole life, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that same, dreary, day in, day out, living and surviving and living and still[[/span]] you keep [[span class=\"blackout\"]]fucking living so now we have to do something, and all of the sudden the fuck-ton of[[/span]] emptiness you had [[span class=\"blackout\"]]becomes a whirlwind of pain and sadness, but reality and humanity and that //spark//[[/span]], you know [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the one, the **magic** spark that pushes[[/span]] us [[span class=\"blackout\"]]towards and away from greatness and history, the knifes blade that controls and fights and sharpens[[/span]] your [[span class=\"blackout\"]]wit, until, wit, there is nothing left to[[/span]] witness, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and without a witness how[[/span]] can you [[span class=\"blackout\"]]possibly exist, but[[/span]] of course you can't, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]nobody can, who thinks that they are truly worthy of self-observation, this perverse internal leer as[[/span]] you mentally reach [[span class=\"blackout\"]]out to all that makes[[/span]] your [[span class=\"blackout\"]]domain[[/span]], your [[span class=\"blackout\"]]mind, soul, and body, and body, and flesh and blood and organs and skin and rot and life and[[/span]] pain [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and only, every so often, if one is especially lucky,[[/span]] you are given [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the chance to create and there is no true parallel to that of progenitor, the sculptor //ex//[[/span]] //nihilo//, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]exhale now and never excel even in emptiness, but then[[/span]] you realize [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that it is --all that we destroy-- transforms in our minds' eyes, and what was nihilo is now ex -- escape velocity is never easy to obtain, of course,[[/span]] you live [[span class=\"blackout\"]]by that mantra, stuck between two forces of gravity, pushed and pulled and stomped and lifted up, up, up but only just[[/span]] high enough [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that when[[/span]] they let you go, you are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]tumbling, falling, plummeting, witnessing[[/span]] your own inevitable [[span class=\"blackout\"]]death until you finally **crash**, dive down deep into the loving embrace of our captors, the parasitic disease we call[[/span]] family, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]lost and aghast in a cavalcade of needful things, useless things, things that wit not to witness, losing who //they// are to the inevitable, creeping, exciting, logic-defying truth, that while all things may end in death,[[/span]] you are not [[span class=\"blackout\"]]all things,[[/span]] you are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]not death,[[/span]] you are not [[span class=\"blackout\"]]a witness,[[/span]] you are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]not, witnessing //ex vivo en nihilo//,[[/span]] the memories [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of nihilo exhale and exhaust and terrify and multiply extracting the essence of what it means to forget, and there it is, that is the sin that[[/span]] we [[span class=\"blackout\"]]endeavor to[[/span]] oblige, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the errata we long to erase, nihilo y ,,nihilo,, y nihilo, until we once again remain, and return, but[[/span]] where do you [[span class=\"blackout\"]]return when the only scrap of life that you[[/span]] cling to [[span class=\"blackout\"]]is held to wit only by the witless one, withering and wilting under the eyes of the observers, the observed, the ex-ambassadors of[[/span]] the land where [[span class=\"blackout\"]]dreams live until they are dreamt, a[[/span]] dying [[span class=\"blackout\"]]planet hemorrhaging the[[/span]] hopes [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and nightmares and compilations[[/span]] of what was once //you//, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]but has never truly been[[/span]] your**self**, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of course, nothing can ever truly hope to be[[/span]] **self**, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]after all,[[/span]] **self** [[span class=\"blackout\"]]is as[[/span]] **self**[[span class=\"blackout\"]]less as[[/span]] **self** [[span class=\"blackout\"]]does, and does[[/span]] the **self** [[span class=\"blackout\"]]salvage the selvage end of our untimely strings of fate, the ever-woven tapestry of irrelevant emptiness,[[/span]] the taunts [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that echo through the empty school prisons, the impacts that rock the very foundation[[/span]] upon which //self// is built, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and with it, the death of observation and the reincarnation of identification as commodity, the capitalistic[[/span]] nightmare [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that gives power[[/span]] to those without wit, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]those who have the right stuff, the special sauce, the magic that flows out through the mind and __onto the page__, the[[/span]] ex-sculptors [[span class=\"blackout\"]]now consumed into //nihilo//, those special few who deign to inscribe their images and[[/span]] memories [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and hatred and longing and memories,[[/span]] of course memories, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]we remember, remember members whose membranes we punctured just to get a better view, a glimpse into that which we cannot be, those we are unable to live as, the un-un-dead, living[[/span]] amongst [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the monsters of the digital worlds we conceive just to lock away on a server, the server who witnesses our greed, the child, the idea,[[/span]] the //genesis// [[span class=\"blackout\"]]//ex nihilo ex genesis//, the one who is left[[/span]] -- you suddenly realize, you [[span class=\"blackout\"]]--**__alone__**--[[/span]] are [[span class=\"blackout\"]]a witness to today.[[/span]]",
