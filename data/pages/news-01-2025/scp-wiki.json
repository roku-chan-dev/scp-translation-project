The time for us to look back on the year and highlight some exceptional writing! Let's dive right in, shall we?\n\nJanuary\n[[[SCP-7804]]] is another short article, though this one really hammers in the creepy atmosphere. It's part of a loose series of related anomalies that all have a similar, offputting creepy vibe to them. I feel like this one would do well with an audio adaption, so if you're someone who can do that, consider this a challenge!\n\nFebruary\n[[[SCP-8799]]] is a longer article about cultural imperialism, ORIA, and two people from different backgrounds coming together and falling apart. It's truly beautiful, and if you're at all a fan of [[*user Tufto]]'s other work, this is an article I wouldn't dare miss out on.\n\nMarch\n[[[SCP-1929]]] is a rewrite of an old article that had a few loosely connected themes and ideas, but ultimately didn't execute them too well. The rewrite takes the themes of the Dust Bowl, oppressive atmosphere, and destructive force to make a masterclass of horror. This is highly effective writing, and it comes courtesy of none other than the legendary [[*user PeppersGhost]]! Give it a read!\n\nApril\n[[[SCP-8591]]] is one of those article that you either hate or love, and personally, I love it. It's barely a minute long read, if that, so I won't yep about it, but if you're reading this, you might as well give it a shot.\n\nMay\n[[[hurting-people|What If My Love Language Is Hurting People?]]] is a long, slow burn of a tale about a young man learning how to live with himself and the hand he was dealt. Mind the content warnings.\n\nJune\n[[[VNP-111]]] is a cute little article about an old wiki favorite, Dragon Snails, in the post-veil world of From 120's Archives/No Return where the Foundation has taken up preserving the anomalous rather than containing it. The article has a lot of charm and the images add a lot to it, I recommend giving it a look!\n\nJuly\n[[[The American Experiment]]] is a heart wrenching tale about loss of home, motherland, and cultural identity. I would go on about it, but it would get lost in translation. This is just one of those pieces you have to read to truly get.\n\nAugust\n[[[SCP-8916]]] is a glimpse into racism in the South, Sundown Towns, and lynchings. Titled after Billie Holiday's /song of the same name, this article, much like the song, provides strong commentary on just how institutional this all is. Harrowing.\n\nSeptember\n[[[43-nothing-happens|Nothing Happens]]] is the first tale in the third book of the legendary //The Breach Goes On// series by our talented friend [[*user HarryBlank]]. It features your favorite cast of characters from Site-43, and is a mind-melting timeywimey good time.\n\nOctober\n[[[SCP-8980]]]. Yeah, we all know it. But I would be remiss to not mention this one, ha.\n\nNovember\n[[[SCP-8843]]] is an article about the systematic erasure of minorities, and how those who are not affected often turn a blind eye to it. It's also got lesbians, so I'm sure that ought to entice some of you.\n\nDecember\n[[[onko-sinulla-nalka-divosi|Onko Sinulla Nälkä: Mourners' Repast]]] is a lovely little recipe blog about Sarkic culture and what it's like to be away from your culture. It's got a lot of charm, the recipes look delicious, and there's even a section to add your own experiences at the bottom if you try them!\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Want to get more critique? Try Discord!\n[[/=]]\n\nWith the year coming to a close, I'd like to commemorate the site's official Discord server and dedicated writing section, Deer College, an important resource for several of us here at site news.\n\nThe server, including the original writing channels were set up on 18th August 2021 but it would take almost exactly 3 years to become what it is today. In its infancy, the entire server was only available to staff or authors and the writing section being \"mostly just chaos\" and \"nearly impossible to moderate\"[[footnote]][[*user Pedagon]], 2024[[/footnote]]. Whilst the original set of channels had some recognisable features, such as #writing-general and #meta-critique (a channel for getting crit on your crit), it also contained now abandoned ideas like the #author-critique channel (a channel for critiquing entire authors).\n\nDuring this time, the critique moderation team was run by [[*user Meserach]] and transitioned form being a fluid team of anyone that volunteered into a solid team when the server opened to the public in early 2022. Much of the changes that make Deer College what it is today came about when user [[*user Pedagon]] was promoted to crit captain in the absence of Meserach and, with assistance from user [[*user OriTiefling]], overhauled the previous systems to be in line with what it is today.\n\nCurrently the main critique process is quite similar to the the onsite process, with the greenlight system being shared by both but using Discords forum system, #Idea-critique and #Draft-Critique opened around the start of December 2022. There is also #Specialized-Critique[[footnote]] Recently implemented 10th August 2024 thanks to the work of user [[*user Queerious]][[/footnote]] which allows topic-specific critique from experts on a subject.\n\nThere's even an equivalent to the Butterfly Squad in the Moth Roster, previously referred to as the Spider Squad by Pedagon[[footnote]]Created after he was rejected from the Butterfly Roster, as spiders eat butterflies [[/footnote]] until it was made official on 23rd February 2023. Several of us at site news are actually moths!\n\nDeer also hosts more general channels including channels for brainstorming[[footnote]] set up in October 2023, acting as a bridge to IRCs brainstorming section[[/footnote]], help with CSS, and current wiki events (including our monthly prompts).\n\nOverall, Discord has allowed Deer College to form a much stronger sense of community compared to onsite crit forums, with staff and moths frequently giving out advice and making friends in the #writing-general channel. This of course isn't to discredit the resources on site; the butterflies and other active users do great work and its recommended that aspiring authors use both in tandem.\n\nIf you're interesting in using Deer College all you have to do is [https://discord.gg/scp join the discord] and sync your Discord and Wikidot accounts. To end this, I'd like to give a final thanks to Pedagon and everyone who has worked to make Deer the welcoming and accessible place it is. Hopefully we see many new faces there in the new year!\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ProblemPal//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts!
