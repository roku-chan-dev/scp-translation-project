It is not much of a surprise, but O5-9 is currently missing and is suspected to have leaked highly classified information to multiple GoIs such as the Chaos Insurgency and the Global Occult Coalition. It seems that O5-9 has also dispensed sensitive information regarding us in the O5 council to some higher level staff within the Foundation. Those that have been exposed to the information are currently in the process of receiving amnestic treatment.  On a more positive note; we have several Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 units out on a worldwide manhunt in search of O5-9. In the meantime I propose all information regarding 'The Secret Keeper' to be expunged from all our records. That is all I have to say. Thank you\"\n> //O5-11 “The Liar” sitrep speech to the O5 council.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
