All individuals showing symptoms linked to a forced exit from SCP-005-IT must undergo a psychiatric evaluation; should the evaluation confirm a forced awakening from SCP-005-IT, infected subjects must undergo a regressive hypnosis session, in order to determine the stage during which the dream was interrupted. Depending on the stage, the following treatments must be applied:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: Table of treatments\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n@@@@\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%; color: #000000\"]]\nSCP-005-IT\nSTAGE\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; color: #000000\"]]\nTREATMENT TO APPLY\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black; color: #000000\"]]\nSCP-005-IT-C\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: justify; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em; color: #000000\"]]\nThe symptoms due to a forced exit from SCP-005-IT-C are the mildest ones and disappear within a few days; should the symptoms persist, contact the on-site medical staff.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black; color: #000000\"]]\nSCP-005-IT-H\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: justify; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em; color: #000000\"]]\nIn the event of a forced awakening from SCP-005-IT-H, antidepressant administration is advised; contact specialized personnel to establish the dosage.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; color: #000000\"]]\nSCP-005-IT-T\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: justify; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em; color: #000000\"]]\nIn the event of a forced awakening from SCP-005-IT-T, Class B amnestics administration is advised; should the symptoms persist, contact specialized personnel for more doses of amnestics.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; color: #000000\"]]\nSCP-005-IT-R\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: justify; border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em; color: #000000\"]]\nIn case of awakening from SCP-005-IT-R, administer C Class amnestics, whose effectiveness amounts to 63%; should the compulsion persist, the subject's immediate termination is required.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT is a memetic agent manifesting a dream to individuals observing it. Said dream is divided into 4 maze-like stages, inhabited by hostile entities. All data related to these mazes and entities were acquired throughout several tests. The structure of SCP-005-IT is always identical for all dreamers, and depending on the subject's actions, one of the following scenarios will play out: if the subjects is able to find the exit, they will move on to the next maze, following the order C-H-T-R; once they reach the exit of SCP-005-IT, the subject wakes up with no harmful consequences and will forget the dream a few days later.\n\nIf the dreamer is awoken by an outside event, they will experience several mental disturbances from then onward. Said disturbances include lethargy, several hallucinations involving the entity from the stage where the subject was awoken and the maze itself; an unconscious tendency to replicate the memetic agent triggering the dream, even though the subject is unaware of how it works or how memetic agents are made. Additionally, SCP-005-IT will keep manifesting itself in the subject's dreams, restarting the C-H-T-R sequence, with increased difficulty.\n\nIf the dreamer is successfully caught by the entity inside the dream, they will undergo brain death in a few minutes. Before that, the subject will try every way they can to replicate the glyph responsible for the contagion, even at the cost of using [REDACTED].\n \nThe stages of SCP-005-IT differ between each other in terms of shape, appearance and the entity inhabiting them. Said stages are:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: SCP-005-IT-C Description\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-it/005-IT-C| caption=An example of SCP-005-IT-C| width=300px]]\n@@@@\n**SCP-005-IT Stage:** SCP-005-IT-C\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-C is the first stage of SCP-005-IT, with a circular shape. The \"hallways\" of SCP-005-IT-C appear to be streets of a city where no living being is found, except for the dreamer and SCP-005-IT-1. The walls of the \"hallways\" are made of rows of unaccessible buildings, whose doors are locked and indestructible. The buildings making up the walls of the maze are inhabited, although the \"people\" occupying them - visible through the windows - are motionless and stare at the subject regardless of what they seemed to be doing before they arrived. Their heads are able to turn around even 360° and always keep eye contact. Every time the subject does not look at these entities, they resume their previous activities.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Item #:** SCP-005-IT-1\n@@@@\n**Descrizione:** SCP-005-IT-1 is a humanoid torso with an estimated length of 2 m, with whitish skin and multiple limbs, whose number changes depending on the dreamer. All its limbs end in hands with a number of fingers ranging from 3 to 8; the limbs possess more joints than a human being's. The disproportionate arms of SCP-005-IT-1 enable it to climb on the buildings, which means it can move ignoring the maze walls. SCP-005-IT-1 has a human head with no facial features, except for a large mouth equipped with multiple rows of human teeth. Like the other entities present in SCP-005-IT, its motor skills change alongside the difficulty of the maze: the more difficult the maze, the less arms SCP-005-IT-1 possesses, making it quicker when chasing the dreamer, but slower when climbing over the buildings.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: SCP-005-IT-H Description\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-it/005-IT-E| caption=An example of SCP-005-IT-H| width=300px]]\n@@@@\n**SCP-005-IT Stage:** SCP-005-IT-H\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-H is the second stage of SCP-005-IT, with an hexagonal shape. It appears to be a forest, reproduced entirely with electronic components suchs as analogical computers, large servers, cables and apparatuses. The ceiling is relatively low, which makes this maze a dark place, brightened by the monitors or the lights of the apparatuses. The electronic components are often prone to accidents: the more difficult the maze, the more frequent the component malfunctions, leading to decreased lighting, fires or explosions.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Item #:** SCP-005-IT-2\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-2 is a large, lizard-like entity entirely made of electronic components, like the rest of the maze; this enables it to blend in to its surroundings and ambush the dreamer. However, SCP-005-IT-2 is also susceptible to malfunctions due to the increasing difficulty, thus becoming easy to spot; therefore, it is forced to act more aggressively.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: SCP-005-IT-T Description\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-it/005-IT-T| caption=An example of SCP-005-IT-T| width=300px]]\n@@@@\n**SCP-005-IT Stage:** SCP-005-IT-T\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-T is the third stage of SCP-005-IT and, based on the tests run so far, it has a triangular shape. The outer area of SCP-005-IT appears to be a mine in its outer area, while the inner area appears to be an underground necropolis. The ruins within the necropolis are not related to any known culture; the bones found in the burial recesses and sarcophagi are vaguely human, but show several anatomical differences which differ for every dreamer.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Item #:** SCP-005-IT-3\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-3 is a vaguely humanoid mummified corpse, with the same anatomical differences found in the remains. The mummification process which SCP-005-IT-3 seems to have undergone appears to be due to a prolongued period of dehydration. SCP-005-IT-3 is able to nimbly roam the necropolis, which often leads it to surpass the dreamer and set traps. Said traps are mainly made of bones and are meant to slow down or temporarily stop the dreamer. The more difficult the maze, the less traps are set, but their effectiveness increases.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: SCP-005-IT-R Description\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify\"]]\n\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-it/005-IT-R| caption=An example of SCP-005-IT-R| width=300px]]\n@@@@\n**SCP-005-IT Stage:** SCP-005-IT-R\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-R is the final stage of SCP-005-IT. Based on the tests run so far, it has a rectangular shape and its inside consists of empty hallways whose surfaces are covered in the memetic agent responsible for the contagion. These hallways are illuminated, although there is no actual light source.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Item #:** SCP-005-IT-4\n@@@@\n**Description:** SCP-005-IT-4 is an amorphous entity, whose appearance resembles a software glitch, a confused set of forms and symbols. The only symbol subjects were able to recognize was the same memetic agent triggering the dream. Unlike the previous mazes, being caught by SCP-005-IT-4 does not trigger brain death or the extreme compulsion during the subject's few minutes remaining, causing them to awaken instead. After awakening, --the only symptom is a complete, definitive inability to dream-- the subject is still compelled to replicate SCP-005-IT, but is able to hide it and display apparently normal behavior.\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n----\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: Incident report SCP-005-IT-Alpha\" hide=\"➤ Close file\"]]\n**Anomaly Involved:** SCP-005-IT.\n**Date:** From ██/██/████ to ██/██/████.\n**Location:** Site Minerva.\n**Description:** During test SCP-005-IT-Delta, run on ██/██/████, the test subject (D-6458) arrived in SCP-005-IT-R and was caught by SCP-005-IT-4; after awakening, the subject was put in a solitary cell for the next month, given the lack of obsession with disseminating SCP-005-IT. During his month-long isolation, the only symptom shown by D-6458 was the inability to dream.\n\nFollowing the month of isolation, given the lack of obsession with disseminating SCP-005-IT, he was placed in community with the other Class D. Within a few days, after the month of isolation, SCP-005 -IT cases increased exponentially among D-class personnel, researchers and guards, leading to the conclusion - following several assumptions and speculations - that D-6458 was not exempt from the compulsive replication of SCP-005-IT, but was able to hide it from researchers.\n\nFollowing the worrying increase in cases of contagion, the director of Site Minerva requested the termination of all the infected and presumably infected subjects, so as to avoid any further spread of SCP-005-IT.\n[[/collapsible]]",
