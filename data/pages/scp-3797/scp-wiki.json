They are permitted to use other SCP objects and temporal anomalies in this process, with O5 approval.\n\nOnce SCP-3797 has been constructed, it is to be used once, in order to terminate SCP-3797-ARC on 0742 UTC 06/13/2015. It is then to be dismantled.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3797 will be a retrocausal weapon capable of terminating a target at a date in the relative past of activation. SCP-3797 will be used at least one time, at an indeterminate date in the future, to terminate SCP-3797-ARC at 0742 UTC 06/13/2015. It is currently unknown how SCP-3797 will function.\n\nSCP-3797-ARC was an apex-tier pluripotent entity. SCP-3797-ARC possessed near-omniscience, but did not possess precognitive abilities. For more information gathered from SCP-3797-ARC's dormant state, see SCP-3797-ARC's ##red|main file##.\n\nAt 0739 UTC 06/13/2015, SCP-3797-ARC awakened, as predicted, and began to initiate a CK-Class Restructuring Scenario. Termination was authorized in order to prevent such an event. MTF Omega-9 [[[SCP-2639|(\"The Scrubs\")]]] and MTF Omega-12 [[[SCP-3480|(\"Achilles Heels\")]]] attempted to terminate SCP-3797-ARC, but all such efforts were prevented by SCP-3797-ARC's reality-altering capabilities.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=deltat|caption=The insignia of the Temporal Anomalies Department.|width=100px]]\n\nAt 0742 UTC 06/13/2015, several hundred instances of the Temporal Anomalies Department insignia appeared upon SCP-3797-ARC. Five seconds later, all of SCP-3797-ARC's flesh disintegrated. 72 further instances of the Temporal Anomalies Department insignia were discovered on the ground surrounding the previous location of SCP-3797-ARC.\n\nAt this time, sensors employed by the Temporal Anomalies Department detected a high-energy temporal displacement originating from the future.\n\nThe current prediction of future events is that the Temporal Anomalies Department will have been able to neutralize SCP-3797-ARC by placing the cause of its death after its death, preventing it from knowing of its termination and using its anomalous capabilities to prevent such an event.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3796]]] | SCP-3797 | [[[SCP-3798]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** deltat\n> **Name:** Delta T.png\n> **Author:** [[*user hammermaiden]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/document-1780-wl SCP Foundation Wiki]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
