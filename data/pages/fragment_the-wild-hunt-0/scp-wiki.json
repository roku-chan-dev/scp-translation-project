Tensions between the Foundation and the United States government are not conducive to containment operations in civilian areas. Efforts are currently focused on maintaining Foundation control over critical installations, and preparing for a potential definition of Tiamat-class Special Containment Procedures targeting the United States of America. \n\nUnder no circumstances should personnel approach or interact with SCP-8082. Statistical analysis indicates a mean time of eight minutes to breaching of one of the conditions for a nomenclature mutation event in SCP-8082's presence. These conditions include, and are not limited to, referring to SCP-8082 with a name, responding to a name SCP-8082 bestows on you, lying to SCP-8082, denying SCP-8082 food when admitting SCP-8082 to an abode.\n\nIt is likely that SCP-8082's hazardous effects are not under SCP-8082's conscious control.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8082 is the designation for an nomenclative-kinetic eigenweapon. The exact capabilities of this eigenweapon, as well as its status and whether it is at large or in American custody is not yet known. \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8082 was developed by Site-46 in an effort to combat an anomaly that was causing the widespread disappearances of children throughout the continental United States (to date, approximately two hundred thousand (200,000) children have become casualties). Though such a weapons project had been suggested by various Foundation staff, the O5 council chose not to pursue it due to concerns that the process to create the weapon was insufficiently understood. Site-46 began its own initiative in secret, labeled Project Erlkönig.\n\nSurvivor testimony from the fall of Site-46 indicates that the procedure to create SCP-8082 took place on 9/27/2024 at 12 AM, which correlates with the disappearance of all but two progeny of Foundation staff, inflicting a critical blow to organizational morale, and sparking widespread defections to US government allegedly in an attempt to seek retribution against the Foundation as a whole for being complicit in Site-46's actions.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Recovered Project Erlkönig Documentation\" hide=\"Access granted\"]]\n**Nomenclature note:** On Dr. Valera's instructions, all references to D-8185 are to exclusively use its D-class designation instead of its name, including logs predating its D-class processing.

Audio feeds unavailable due to unresolved cyber-attack that occurred during the specific window of their conversation, cause undetermined. Additionally, both participants frequently covered their mouths, hindering efforts to discern content of speech from lip movements.\n**Locations:** \nD-8185: D-8185's containment chamber. \nE-8321: Dr. Valera's office (it is unknown how E-8321 gained access to Dr. Valera's quarters)\n\n**Description:** Conversation begins acrimoniously, with both participants seen in varying levels of distress. E-8321 is walking in a loop around the perimeter of the office, lunging at the desk from time to time when screaming at D-8185. D-8185 remains mostly static for much of the conversation, except when throwing objects and punch surfaces around the chamber. At one point, D-8185 and E-8321 seen to remove matching jewelry from the fourth proximal digit of each of their left hands and hurl them across their respective rooms. Forensic analysis of both subjects' visual indicators indicate highly elevated distress state consistent with trauma response and possible dissociation, though D-8185 shows the most external indicators of distress (e.g. touching its own hair and face, aforementioned striking of physical surfaces, crying), whereas E-8321 shows indications of alexithymia; such as lack of emotional responsiveness, save the occasional scream whenever D-8185's physical reactions cause a loud noise.\n\nThirty minutes into the confrontation, both participants appear to cease communicating, although frames from footage indicate E-8321 is whispering to D-8185. Forensic analysis of neurochemical markers indicate that both participants were able to co-regulate during that window of time. \n\nBoth participants retrieve their jewelry and replace them on their respective fingers. D-8185's digit is mutilated above the knuckle. E-8321's corresponding digit is tattooed black along a surface area roughly corresponding to the extent of D-8185's deformation.\n\nConversation becomes copacetic. Both D-8185 and E-8321 express lower intensity emotional distress, until D-8185 says something that causes E-8321 --to hyperventilate-- to laugh. E-8321 has stopped pacing and lies prone on her back on the desk, positioned so communication device is next to her head. D-8185 has relaxed in bunk with phone next to his head. After twenty minutes of banter, E-8321 says something that correlates with a sexual arousal response in D-8185. D-8185's reply has the same effect on E-8321. E-8321 starts to unbutton [their] shirt and D-8185 reaches for [its] pants in motions that have been confirmed to be non-anomalously synchronized. [EXPUNGED BY PERSONAL REQUEST OF PROJECT LEAD]\n\nConversation terminates when Level 5 security personnel detect unauthorized communication, and extract E-8321 from office.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n**Interview Log**\n**Participants:** Dr. Anthony Valera, Miss Baba Yaga (pseudonym chosen by high ranking member of Foundation leadership-all further information classified on penalty of summary termination and/or nerve stapling)\n**Background:** Discussion of contents of video log of unauthorized phone conversation\n\n**Dr. Anthony Valera:** \"How did that [E-8321] get into my office?\"\n\n**Miss Baba Yaga:** //<Smiles>// \"Yellow card.\"\n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"Fine.

A push.\"\n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"What push? Why? I don't know if you saw the same footage I did, but it sounded like [E-8321] whipped the initiative out of [D-8185] entirely!

He also fast-tracked D-8185's registration as D-Class as per standard Foundation procedure regarding test subjects in High Intensity Experimentation Environments. \n\nGuards with orders from Miss Baba Yaga had transferred D-8185 to a room allocated for D-8185 and E-8321's meeting, when Dr. Valera and a scratch formation of five MTF soldiers forcibly assumed custody of D-8185. D-8185 was then brought to Dr. Valera's office, which had been cauterized from the surveillance network shortly after E-8321's break-in. As a result, it is unclear what transpired into that room, although Dr. Valera alleges any physical injuries on D-8185's person were purely the result of the containment breach. Dr. Valera permitted D-8185 to make a single phone call to E-8321, who was rushed to a site checkpoint in order to take the call.\n\nDue to Dr. Valera's improvised precautions, only audio from E-8321's side of the conversation was able to be traced and logged.\n\n**E-8321:** \"[D-8185], what's going on?\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"You said yes?

The transparently anomalous nature of the disappearances has drastically undermined public trust in critical psycho-social institutions such as science and religion. Due to the perceived failure of the Foundation to contain the anomaly, and growing civilian cost of Veil maintenance operations (see: incident report 8/6/24 \"Walnut Street massacre\"), the United States civilian government has severed ties with the Foundation and is actively attempting to militarily occupy its facilities and subsume it as an organization.\n\n**Discovery:** The SCP first recognized the phenomena as an anomaly on August 1st, 2024, when thirteen students at Carlisle High School were reported as missing by their families on the same day,   and follow-up investigation revealed that the geographic spread of the last-known locations of the thirteen made it highly unlikely the disappearance had mundane cause. Similar disappearances of sets of thirteen were reported in neighboring zip-codes, and the phenomena extended its effect into those communities in a geometrically hexagonal fashion. Due to the seemingly arbitrary nature of the anomaly, the Foundation had difficulty acquiring or confirming basic facts about its spread, targets, or accelerating impact. As a result, it is likely the phenomena had begun far earlier.\n--]\n[!--\n**Addendum 8000-1** \"The Walnut Street\" massacre is largely considered one of two watershed moments that transformed the Foundation's relationship with the United States of America. Below is the AI distilled summary of the materials pertaining to the post-event inquiry:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\n**After Action Report: \"Walnut Street Massacre\"**\n\n**MTF designation:** 316 (\"The Emperor's Finest\")\n**Combat Specialty:** Anti-Insurgency (not to be confused with counterinsurgency) warfare\n**Tactical load-out:**\n* Black \"Urban Whisper\" camouflage\n* Combat sneakers with inertial dampening to reduce sound of footsteps\n* Foundation proprietary variant on Heckler and Koch 416 rifle, with a modification for grenades with strategic payloads (e.g. NBC warfare, Japers name-phages, Placeholder basilisk jars)\n* Shahi-Light Tactical Visor with Mixed Reality interface and real-time AI-driven guidance including target/friendly markers, combat effectiveness metrics and tactical waypoints\n* Kaktus-Clef Deleted Uranium body armor, proven at .50 caliber rounds\n\n**Location:** Carlisle, Pennsylvania\n**Date/Time:** 8/6/2024/0530 hours, \n**Background:** At 0470 hours, Foundation Agent Arthur Harris transmitted a \"sauve qui peut\" distress call, which resulted in Command issuing \"Extract At All Costs\" scramble order to nearest MTF outfit. Due to spread of GOI and civilian efforts to disrupt Foundation activities, MTF-316 was the only outfit within operational distance of the distress call. \n\nAt the time of the distress call, MTF-316 had not fully reconstituted from engagement with Insurgency forces near Site-99 (see: Battle of Three Mile Island). The Insurgency engagement led to significant casualties and the destruction of the MTF's mechanized equipment. In addition, MTF-316 had no access to civilian-friendly armament or stealth capabilities normally used to respond to distress calls in civilian areas.\n\nMTF-316-Actual made the decision to commandeer civilian vehicles in order to lead a personal command of two platoons, while dispatching the rest of his forces to relieve Site-32 from a protracted siege by a Serpent's Hand warlock legion.\n\n**From the debrief of MTF-316-1:** \n\n\"316 shouldn't have been anywhere near a civilian area, let alone a standard \"slip and get\" extract mission. Their reputation is forged in battles that usually result in the area becoming uninhabitable for decades. If anything, the civs should have given them credit for their restraint.\"\n\n\"We'd ridden in on four sets of pickup trucks. I wanted [316-Actual] to 'accidentally' EMP the place and tell Command we didn't get the call, but that's just not his way. So we raided a car dealership. Peeled into Walnut Street looking like a goddamn death-squad pulling up for a tailgate party.\"\n\n\"We dismounted. Half of us took defensive positions near appropriate terrain, because we assumed if Agent Harris issued a SQP order, we were in for a scrap. [MTF-316-2] had set up shop by a church a mile or so away, providing us overwatch. He said he couldn't make out anything of interest. \"Of interest\", for us, means assets you could break a flank with in a modern day pitched battle. Tanks, thaumaturges, onto-kinetics, Dreamweavers...\"\n\n\"What he //did// see were cops. We weren't used to worrying about cops, though.\"\n\n\"[MTF-316-Actual] had half of us stay behind and the other half form an echelon formation behind him. I think he'd realized the situation was not our typical level of engagement, err on the side of finesse if possible. Safeties were off, but he had us at orange condition, so fingers weren't quite on triggers. That's the sad part-think he knew where the story was going, and was doing everything he could to avoid the conclusion.\"\n\n\"That's about when the cops showed up.\"\n\n**Visor footage from 8/6/2024, 0535 hours:**\n\n**MTF-316-2:** \"Sir, the distress call said 'gunmen' were surrounding the house. Those are-\"\n\n**MTF-316-Actual:** \"Yes, I have eyes. I know what police cars look like.\"\n\n**MTF-316-2:** \"We gotta fall back, signal Command. SQP smells off.\"\n\n**MTF-316-Echo:** \"Badges or bad guys, SOP is clear. Harris wouldn't issue an SQP unless he was in imminent danger of-\"\n\n**MTF-316-2:** \"There //hasn't// even been a firefight! Those are cops you send to a drug bust or a hostage situation!\"\n\n**MTF-316-Echo:** \"Are you gonna wager an intelligence breach over that? They could easily be Insurgency infiltrators.\"\n\n**MTF-316-Actual:** \"Maintain silence. You don't know who's listening.\"\n\n**<Police officer posthumously identified as Sergeant Robert Potter>:**  \"Police! Put your hands up!\"\n\n//<Formation of Carlisle Police Department officers emerges on right flank of MTF-316's formation.

Sir, I am Lieutenant John Trier. We're here on a classified operation. Let's not take this any place it doesn't have to go. \n\n**Sgt. Potter:** \"Military, eh? I'm a former SEAL myself. If you're military, then I don't need to tell you the two dozen things wrong with this situation. You're all in uniform, but there's no service that would give its units that uniform. You're wearing patches, but none even remotely American. I //could// make a case for you being Tier One, but looking at some of your faces, you're clearly observing a grooming standard, and no Tier One unit I've ever met that'd ever take something like that seriously. Ok, so you're government of some kind. Let me see some proof.\n\n**MTF-316-Actual:** \"Take it easy, man, I've got you covered.\" \n\n//<MTF-316-Actual withdraws envelope from breast pocket, slides out documentation card, and passes it to Sergeant Potter>//\n\n**Unknown:** \"There are more of them coming from the house!\"\n\n**MTF-316-Actual:** \"For fuck's sake, they're just doing their jobs! Do not engage unless engaged. Repeat-\"\n\n**Sergeant Potter:** \"Are you //fucking// with me right now? What's this supposed to be, a Zodiac letter?\"\n\n**From the debrief of MTF-316-1:** \"And that's where Sergeant Potter suddenly dropped his flashlight and gun and collapsed to the ground.\"\n\n\"If you knew what you were looking at, if the visibility was enough for you, and if you weren't drugged out of your mind with F-Amp, fresh PTSD and adrenaline like everyone there, you could explain what happened as a stroke. Thirty-seven years old is a little young for a stroke, but that explanation usually works for civilians. [MTF-316-Actual] and I knew what happened as soon as it did.\"\n\n\"'Low intensity' cognitohazards are exceptionally tricky memes to create. Usually, social engineering is enough for most accidental civilian interactions, so those cards don't have to be used very often. Nine months of SCP-8000 rapturing kids left and right changed that. Now we were using them everywhere, which meant we had to mass-produce something that typically required clinical trials for each individual item. Which meant mistakes were bound to happen. And...\"\n\n\"Sergeant Robert Potter died of a neural hemorrhage, bleeding his brain through his nose. What it ended up looking like to whomever fired the first shot, we'll never know.\"\n\n**Annotation of firefight (total time: 15 seconds):**\n**T+2:** Five cops on MTF-316's right flank are cut down by crossfire. \n**T+5:** Eight responders surrounding the house attempt to make use of comms, but they're jammed by Foundation electronic warfare assets.\n**T+6:** Responders on hill take positions behind vehicles and commence suppressing fire on the MTF armor. Bullets are insufficient caliber to do more than cosmetic damage. \n**T+9:** MTF units return fire. \n**T+11:** Responders are combat ineffective.\n**T+14:** 316-Actual begins terminating wounded as per Foundation Veil-protection protocols. Officer Arthur Phillips vocally attempts to communicate before 316-Actual terminates him with his sidearm (two shots, forehead). \n**T+15:** 316-Actual terminates Officer Sam Youghton (one shot, forehead).\n\n**From the debrief of MTF-316-1:** \"And then there was silence. If you've been in an MTF long enough, you've heard it too.  Me, it was back at Haditha, 2003. There's a reason MTF tend to say 'see you in hell' instead of 'see you later'.\"\n\n\"That silence, like God parted the skies just to give you Her undivided attention.\"\n\n\"[MTF-316-Actual] just unbuckled his helmet and slid it off his head. Bless him, he took civilian casualties close to heart, probably explains what happened later. He clears his formation and the rear guard to advance on the source of the SQP. I tried to comfort him, tried to touch his shoulder, and he nearly hit me. I know [MTF-316-Actual]. He wanted to be condemned, not comforted.\"  \n\n\"I was with him when we reached 20 Walnut Street and finally met Agent Arthur Harris' craven ass at the front door. His face was covered with blood.\"\n\n\"Amnestics are an art and a science. Amnestics are bespoke brain damage. That's what people don't get about amnestics. Memory modification is easy-you can do it with a car battery, a concussion, a knife, a bullet. It's keeping the brain perfectly intact afterwards that's the hard part, especially if the memory is traumatic. I want you to think about that when I say we were scraping the bottom of the barrel for amnestic supplies. And that was before the GOIs started actively sabotaging our logistics. We were already running low from cleaning up after Project LETHE. And now the Foundation was asking us to procure enough brain bleach for a continent spanning anomaly. Something was going to give. Something was going to break.\"\n\n\"Two families. Arthur Harris tried amnesticizing witnesses to an SCP-8000 event, and accidentally wiped out two whole families. [MTF-316-Actual] lost his shit at that point, performed what can loosely be described as a field interrogation, cashiered his career in minutes. Harris didn't try to lie about the SQP for long. Think it was as much a deathbed confession as anything else, considering what [MTF-316-Actual] did to him.\" \n\n\"The truth was pretty ordinary. Harris'd just snapped. He wanted to go home. I understood-by that point we were amnesticizing a hundred people every day, and it was never enough. Non-stop clean-up ops, no sleep, no support, defective equipment, and now he'd become a two-time family annihilator before the age of thirty. He wasn't the first to break. This wasn't the last fuck-up. But this was the point I'm told the government stopped taking our calls.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum SCP-8000-2** \n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\nIt is depressing that I needed to use my O5 credentials to enter this note into the 8000 document, but our analysts are slow to understand where pop culture is not merely a symptom of idea-warfare, but one of its most important battlefields. I've talked myself hoarse analyzing the memetic and cultural programming implications of the interview. I just want to insert my reaction for the record.\n \nWe've seen the explosion. Here is the gunpowder. \n\nAt that time, we were still trying to sell the public on the idea this was either a hoax, a terrorist group, a US government conspiracy, or all of the above. We still wouldn't give up on the Veil for a few more weeks after this, but I already knew the jig was up.\n\nSo, on August 16th, Oprah Winfrey came out of retirement to interview Angelina Jolie on a philanthropic project to provide mental health resources to parents affected by SCP-8000-a number I've heard reach into the hundreds of thousands. I imagine Jolie having her six children with her was supposed to resonate with the audience at that point, and it did. Among the six, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox were the more excited to meet Oprah. I was surprised by their enthusiasm, but perhaps it was a product of the 90s nostalgia of the time.\n\nThat meant the room felt especially empty when those three beautiful, telegenic creatures vanished into thin air, with three identical, blood stained needles falling out of Mrs. Jolie's mouth. \n\nThe disappearance, and Jolie's reaction, was covered live, on camera, Approximately six hundred million people watched it happen.\n\nOn August seventeenth, America went quite mad. \n\nAnd considering they agreed to implement Project Erlkonig, I suspect the Foundation soon joined them.\n\n-O5-06\n\n[[/div]]\n--]\n\n**Project Erlkönig: Research documentation**\n##purple|Irrelevant.

Audio feeds unavailable due to unresolved cyber-attack that occurred during the specific window of their conversation, cause undetermined. Additionally, both participants frequently covered their mouths, hindering efforts to discern content of speech from lip movements.\n**Locations:** \nD-8185: D-8185's containment chamber. \nE-8321: Dr. Valera's office (it is unknown how E-8321 gained access to Dr. Valera's quarters)\n\n**Description:** Conversation begins acrimoniously, with both participants seen in varying levels of distress. E-8321 is walking in a loop around the perimeter of the office, lunging at the desk from time to time when screaming at D-8185. D-8185 remains mostly static for much of the conversation, except when throwing objects and punch surfaces around the chamber. At one point, D-8185 and E-8321 seen to remove matching jewelry from the fourth proximal digit of each of their left hands and hurl them across their respective rooms. Forensic analysis of both subjects' visual indicators indicate highly elevated distress state consistent with trauma response and possible dissociation, though D-8185 shows the most external indicators of distress (e.g. touching its own hair and face, aforementioned striking of physical surfaces, crying), whereas E-8321 shows indications of alexithymia; such as lack of emotional responsiveness, save the occasional scream whenever D-8185's physical reactions cause a loud noise.\n\nThirty minutes into the confrontation, both participants appear to cease communicating, although frames from footage indicate E-8321 is whispering to D-8185. Forensic analysis of neurochemical markers indicate that both participants were able to co-regulate during that window of time. \n\nBoth participants retrieve their jewelry and replace them on their respective fingers. D-8185's digit is mutilated above the knuckle. E-8321's corresponding digit is tattooed black along a surface area roughly corresponding to the extent of D-8185's deformation.\n\nConversation becomes copacetic. Both D-8185 and E-8321 express lower intensity emotional distress, until D-8185 says something that causes E-8321 --to hyperventilate-- to laugh. E-8321 has stopped pacing and lies prone on her back on the desk, positioned so communication device is next to her head. D-8185 has relaxed in bunk with phone next to his head. After twenty minutes of banter, E-8321 says something that correlates with a sexual arousal response in D-8185. D-8185's reply has the same effect on E-8321. E-8321 starts to unbutton [their] shirt and D-8185 reaches for [its] pants in motions that have been confirmed to be non-anomalously synchronized.

I simply let nature take its course.\" \n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"But //why//?\"\n\n**Miss Yaga:** \"Because [D-8185] is almost there. He just needed a reminder of what [D-8185] stands to lose. [E-8321] has ardor, but [E-8321] didn't realize that just by letting [D-8185]  hear [E-8321]'s voice again, imagining what [E-8321] had to do to make it happen, [E-8321] made up [D-8185]'s mind. A push.\"\n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"What push? Why? I don't know if you saw the same footage I did, but it sounded like [E-8321] whipped the initiative out of [D-8185] entirely! How would that emotional roughness motivate [D-8185] to anything more than further incessant wallowing?\"\n\n**Miss Yaga:** \"You ought to know, Dr. Valera, and yet you're clueless. The ontico-ontological paradox in a nutshell. I always knew you were right man for this project.\"\n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"And are you going to tell me who among my staff are so limp-wristed that they can be finessed by a [E-8321]?\"\n\n//<Miss Yaga chuckles as she rises from her seat. Dr. Valera, assuming she is concluding the interview, stands up and walks over to her and extends his hand to shake hers. Miss Yaga instead stares at him.>//\n\n**Miss Yaga:** \"Red Card.\" \n\n//<Miss Yaga's left fist makes contact with Dr. Valera's temple in a swift hook movement. The blow causes Dr. Valera to immediately lose consciousness and collapse into a prone position at Miss Yaga's feet. Miss Yaga checks Dr. Valera's vitals, searches for broken bones, and performs rudimentary checks for concussions and other related head injuries. After signaling for medical staff to retrieve Dr. Valera for immediate eval and treatment, she wipes her hands on his shirt, and then leaves the room>//\n\n**Postscript:** No disciplinary actions were filed against Miss Yaga.

D-8185 is trembling.

He also fast-tracked D-8185's registration as D-Class as per standard Foundation procedure regarding test subjects in High Intensity Experimentation Environments. \n\nGuards with orders from Miss Baba Yaga had transferred D-8185 to a room allocated for D-8185 and E-8321's meeting, when Dr. Valera and a scratch formation of five MTF soldiers forcibly assumed custody of D-8185. D-8185 was then brought to Dr. Valera's office, which had been cauterized from the surveillance network shortly after E-8321's break-in. As a result, it is unclear what transpired into that room, although Dr. Valera alleges any physical injuries on D-8185's person were purely the result of the containment breach. Dr. Valera permitted D-8185 to make a single phone call to E-8321, who was rushed to a site checkpoint in order to take the call.\n\nDue to Dr. Valera's improvised precautions, only audio from E-8321's side of the conversation was able to be traced and logged.\n\n**E-8321:** \"[D-8185], what's going on?\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"You said yes? Like...were you sober? Why...?\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"'//Because your dad told you to?// You're gonna possibly die without ever seeing me again, and the only explanation you can give me is //your dad told you to//?\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"You know what?

Wait, one more question. You planning on making this up to me somehow?\"\n\n//<There's a brief pause after D-8185 responds to E-8321's question. E-8321 laughs hysterically. This continues for a few minutes. Post-incident analysis of logs suggests E-8321's breathing only departed baseline parameters at this point in the conversation.>// \n\n**E-8321:** \"A what? You're about to go space monkey on me, and you think getting me a //chinchilla// will make it all better?\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"You got me fucked up.\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"No, no, you got me fucked up.\"\n\n**E-8321:** \"Yeah, I know you lose your shit when I say that.

At the same time, [E-8321], wearing an MTF uniform provided to her by a contact who is now in custody, runs in his direction.

It's yours for making him think the Foundation particularly cares about its pawns.\"\n\n**Miss Yaga:** \"The nature of the...catalyst...is rather picky about niceties like this. I'm sure I can still make this work...it's just I'm unsure of what it considers 'damages'.

You are a fixer, a bag woman, and I have a paper trail implicating you in every shortcut you asked me to make. And even if that weren't the case, you're a dead woman walking!\"\n\n**Miss Yaga:** //<She grins, this time with teeth>// \"Good catch. I underestimated your ability to make friends, it seems.\"\n\n**Dr. Valera:** \"It's easier to make friends when the turncoats are trying to leave a sinking ship.\"\n\n**Miss Yaga:** \"You've overestimated your ability to make //useful// ones.

Or maybe you helped her because your conscience cried out against what Dr. Valera was doing. Or maybe you just really didn't like Dr. Valera.

A weird unlight gloamed from the streams of sweet-tasting ichor flowing down his face and arms into the olive carpet of grass beneath him. Each blade in the field is stiff and though he hears a gentle breeze, every blade remains stuck in place. They were like mossy cactus spines. His neck feels stiff where his spine was pierced by the jagged heartwood.\n\nHe saw a vague silhouette emerge from the dark and move towards him. As his eyes continued to adjust, he saw she was tall, dressed in a black three piece suit, with two matching Foundation pins in each lapel. In one pocket, a silver chain dangled, likely the tail of an ornate pocket watch. He couldn't make out her face. He saw her bare feet crush the swampy grass, but heard no sound of crunching vegetation, or rustling clothes. He saw the grass behind her turn to straw and wilt, and then turn red.\n\n**##006400|The fatherless son amidst bastards##** saw what she saw with his other eye. He saw himself; a bloodless, blank-featured corpse protruding from a tall, leaf-less alder tree, his face frozen in a wide-eyed scream. Two streaks of sap flow from his eyes and drip from his jaw onto the mossy green grass; the only other part of him sticking out from the crease-less bark is his left arm, hand grasping at air.\n\n**##purple|She of the sanguine tears##**: \"This won't do.\"\n\nHe saw her reach into the pocket with the silver pocket-watch chain, saw her pull out the combat knife it was connected to. She stopped inches away from him, and then, grabbing the handle of the knife with both hands, she thrust it straight into the tree's trunk, inches below his jaw where his neck would be. She yanked the knife earthwards, and the wood rent where the blade moved like she's stripping the flesh from cooked meat. The gaping wound she creates expels a mist of flies and gold, and **##green|the man with tattoos of winged things##** sloshed onto the ground, dressed in a Foundation D-class uniform, writhing in a viscous pool of amber fluid. \n\nAs the vision of what she sees vanishes from his other eye, he is finally able to see her face, and every nerve in his body fires a 'run, run right now' message to every limb he has. His jaw started to ache, and he realized he was voicelessly screaming.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8082/O5-06.png\n|align=center|width=700px|caption=It's me.]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10px; margin 10px]]\nHer jaw and cheeks and flowing dark hair were human enough, except for the rivulets of blood streaming over her chin, down her neck and into her suit. Then there was what the top half of her head was covered with. To say it was merely a mask was understating it. Someone might as well have ripped a giant rabbit's head off and smashed it onto her head. The blood spilling down her front was pouring from under meat veil. She stared at him with wet red eyes.\n\nHe realized those weren't eyes. Instead furry skin stretched where there normally would have been sockets, soaked through with twin shapeless patches of blood.\n\nHe wheezed, coughed up more sap, and found his voice again.\n\n**##006400|The man with the missing finger##:** \"They got to you too?\"\n\n**##purple|The unsung savior of all mankind##:** //<Chuckling, yet shaking her head, as though pitying a confused child>// \"They got to me a long time ago.\"\n\n**##006400|The friendless child amidst the ruins##:** \"You...you weren't really a therapist, were you?\"\n\n**##purple|The harbinger of a new era##:** \"No, I suppose we've never properly been introduced.

She leaned her head into the jagged, weeping tear in the now-sagging tree, and he heard her whisper something inside of it. She walked back over to him and grabbed his hair, and he shrieked in surprise as she dragged him away from the tree seconds before it burst into flame.\n\nThe heat licked his feet and warmed his cheeks. All at once, the expanding air popped and he heard and felt a strong breeze move over him, move //through// him \n\n**##006400|Shout in Whispers##:** \"Wha-what did you just do?!\"\n\n**##purple|O5-06##:** \"I gave you a Name, so you can return to the Real.\"\n\n**##006400|Shout##:** \"And what about you?\"\n\n**##purple|O5-06##:** \"I guess I will, too.\"\n\nShe extended a hand to Shout, and he accepted her help standing up. Now that his sense of sight and depth perception had fully returned to him, he realized O5-06 was quite a bit taller than he was. At six foot five, with a stature closer to a weight lifter than an administrator, she looked like she could easily pick him up and fold him like a chair. She spoke with a low contralto, and what Shout could only describe as a tender growl. She sounded shockingly human.\n\n**##purple|O5-06##:** \"Home is this way, Shout.

Now, come and see.\"\n\nIn no time at all, she led him to a large well. When he stared at the surface of its water, instead of a reflection, he saw his wife from behind running from something, racing down the Level 5 hallway at Site-46. He could hear the sound of gunfire echo from the well. He saw her kick open a door, slam the door shut, and hold a scientist at gunpoint.\n\n**##purple|O5-06##:** \"She's more tenacious than I expected. We will have to move quickly.\"\n\n**##006400|Shout##:** \"The hell do you mean?\"\n\n**##purple|O5-06##:** \"Wake up, Shout. Let your instincts guide you and your wife to safety.

This resulted in the disappearance of all but two progeny of Foundation staff. The parents discovered needles in their uniforms stained with blood belonging to the vanished children. The two exceptions were nomenclatively mutated individuals ##purple|Shout in Whispers## and ##purple|Never Fades Away##.\n\nThis inflicted a critical blow to organizational morale, sparking widespread defections to US government. Posited reasons include dissatisfaction with Foundation leadership, fatalism regarding the organization's future, perception of recklessness in Project Erlkönig, and indications the government has acquired undetermined leverage against high ranking members of Foundation staff. Security architecture of Foundation is significantly compromised, and nerve stapling has been authorized as a disciplinary alternative to termination for staff retention purposes.\n\n[[code]]\nTraceback: 804 \"Secret Handshake\" Exception: current authenticated user invalid\non null in\nStack trace:\n#0 /home/wp_9w2zak/mydomain.com/wp-includes/class-wp-hook.php(303):\nerce_shi...')\n#4\n/home/wp_9w2zak/mydomain.com/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-shipping.php(114):\n\nDeploying malware...\nInstalled; running 'JANUS.exe' \n\n\"We see you too, assholes\"\n\n\n[[/code]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=border-radius: 10p[x; margin 10px]]\n**Foundation Infiltrator AI:** \n**Client annotations enabled** \n**Time:** Two hundred hours; \n**Address: Langley, Virginia.** \n**Entity of interest:** \"Data-fortress Motherwill\": US government cyberwarfare nexus responsible for offensive operations against Foundation infrastructure.
