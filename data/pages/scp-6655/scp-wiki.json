While the specifics are still under active research, SCP-6655 is extremely antithetical to conventional human thought. For further details, consult the testing log.\n\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]**Addendum:**[[/span]] Archived Testing log\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n> **Test Log 1**\n> \n> **Subject:** D-43724\n> \n> **Project lead:** Researcher Morgan Riley\n> \n> **Procedure:** Subject introduced to SCP-6655 infected media and quarantined under standard information censor practices.\n> \n> **Results:** Within 6 hours, D-43724's communications became a vector for SCP-6655. After 24 hours, subject's behavior showed major deviations from known personality, including:\n> * Decreased empathy\n> * Increased proclivity for violent acts\n> * Negligible attempts at self-preservation \n> * Incomprehensibility\n> \n> After 48 hours, D-43724 was sedated and the test was terminated.\n@@ @@\n> **Test Log 2**\n> \n> **Subject:** D-43724\n> \n> **Project lead:** Researcher Morgan Riley\n> \n> **Procedure:** Subject amnescitized to determine possible countermeasures to SCP-6655 infection.\n> \n> **Results:** Conventional targeted amnestics failed to purge SCP-6655 symptoms from D-43724. Likewise, general amnestics capable of removing all memories after SCP-6655 infection also resulted in failure. \n> \n> After extensive testing, a mixture (hence referred to as RMD-6655) of Class D Amnestics, Class X Mnestics, Chlorpromazine and Lithium salts was successful in purging SCP-6655 from D-43724, although long term side-effects including severe photophobia, difficulty forming new memories, confusion, and insomnia make this inpractical as a treatment.
