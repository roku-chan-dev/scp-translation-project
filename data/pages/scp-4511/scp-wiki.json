Site-4511.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The factory SCP-4511 resides in has been purchased by the Foundation and designated Provisional Site-4511. MTF Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") have been assigned to manage containment and security of the object. All organic matter which has exited SCP-4511 is to be returned inside, regardless if living or deceased.\n\n**FILESERV NOTICE:** AS OF WRITING, RESEARCH INTO SCP-4511 IS STILL ONGOING. SOME ERRORS MAY BE PRESENT.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4511 is a large mechanical construct located in the basement of Danforth Meatpacking, a disused meatpacking factory in Chicago, USA. SCP-4511 externally resembles a domestic pig[[footnote]]//Sus scrofa domesticus//.[[/footnote]], measuring approximately 15m by 25m by 20m at its widest points, and is constructed of iron, which has become heavily oxidized following several years of improper maintenance. SCP-4511's primary entrance point is a large blast furnace in a constant state of activation, despite being disconnected from all fuel lines and ignition sources.\n\nSCP-4511's left flank contains a thin 5cm-long slit that, upon certain conditions being met, will print an index card carrying a series of instructions.\n\n**Recovery Report:**\n> The ██████████ factory was initially raided by Foundation agents embedded within the Chicago Police Department in response to reports of occult activity in the area. They encountered heavy resistance from a group of occult worshipers who had taken residence in the basement. MTF Epsilon-9 (\"Fire Eaters\") were dispatched to lend support to the Chicago Police Department. Of the forty-seven cultists that had previously inhabited the factory, only one survived their injuries for more than seventy-two hours. While the individual was treated for their injuries, Foundation personnel began studying SCP-4511. The following card was discovered left within SCP-4511.\n\n[[div style=\"background: #fff; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-shadow: none;\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ CURRENT DEMAND\n----\n[[/=]]\n[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;\"; font-size: 575%; align=\"center\";]]\nA flock of my own. - SATISFIED\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> Every twelve hours, SCP-4511 produced another copy of the card.

The interior of the fuse box is revealed to have been sealed to the door with a layer of waxy material.//\n\n**ε-4:** Is that... fat?\n\n**ε-3:** Ugh.\n\n**ε-2:** Probably from years of disuse. I don't think anyone was cleaning it even when this place was still open.
