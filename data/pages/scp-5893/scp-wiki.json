The enclosure must not be roofed or floored[[footnote]]This prevents SCP-5893 specimens from becoming stressed or agitated due to unfamiliar surroundings or feelings of imprisonment.[[/footnote]] and must be surrounded by tungsten carbide walls which are 2m tall and 1m thick. Additionally, 5m wide firebreaks are to be positioned along the edges of the enclosure.\n\nSCP-5893 instances are to not be provoked or stressed under any circumstance. When approaching an SCP-5893 specimen, no loud sounds, abrupt movements, or threatening gestures are to be made.\n\nIn the case of a containment breach, a Collaborative Task Force consisting of 25 total members of MTF Epsilon-9 (\"Fire Breathers\") and MTF Phi-2 (\"Clever Girls\") - designated CTF Psi-29 (\"Pyroraptors\") - is to be deployed. This squadron - specialized in dealing with prehistoric anomalies in high-temperature environments - is tasked with the sedation and re-capturing of SCP-5893 specimens by the use of Xylazine[[footnote]]Analogue used for sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia.[[/footnote]]. No specimens are to be neutralized during these operations.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=200 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px \n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/phantom8-3/Stygimoloch\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Skull of an SCP-5893 specimen\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5893 is a herd of specimens that closely resemble the species //Stygimoloch spinifer//[[footnote]]Meaning \"Demon of Styx river\".[[/footnote]]. Although being similar from a skeletal level, SCP-5893 instances possess several biological differences and properties which divide them from the latter.\n\nThe herd consists of 5 male and 17 female specimens, SCP-5893 instances are designated from SCP-5893-1 to SCP-5893-22 respectively.  SCP-5893 specimens are bipedal ornithischian[[footnote]]\"Bird-hipped\".[[/footnote]] dinosaurs of the clade //Pachycephalosauria//[[footnote]]Meaning \"Thick-headed lizards.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5893 specimens are herbivores. \n\nSCP-5893 instances have an average lifespan of 25 years and have an average height of 1m, an approximate length of 2.5 to 3.3m, and a mass of 90 to 110kg. The hatching period for SCP-5893 specimens is between 6 to 8 months.\n\nAlthough normally peaceful, SCP-5893 specimens can ignite their body without the use of incendiary compounds or chemicals to reach temperatures of up to 3,500 °C when they are threatened or stressed. SCP-5893 specimens primarily employ this property as a self-defense mechanism although they have been seen to engage in aggressive behavior against their attacker(s) in rare instances. Upon cooling, SCP-5893 instances release very high levels of Carbon dioxide (CO,,2,,) into the atmosphere through the use of special tube-like organs. These organs are located in two rows of five throughout their back.\n\nSCP-5893 specimens are not affected on a respiratory or dermatological level by any of these properties, nor are they harmed by smoke inhalation or burns caused by outside factors.\n\nThe majority of SCP-5893 fossils have been unearthed in Hell's Creek, Montana, with more small pockets of fossils appearing in varied zones leading up to Ennis, Montana. This discovery would indicate migratory behavior from the SCP-5893 herd.\n\n**Note:** It is not yet understood how the SCP-5893 herd was able to survive the mass extinction which took place in the Cretaceous period; however Foundation paleontologists have theorized that the heat manipulation properties present in SCP-5893 specimens would have allowed them to survive the initial blast as well as maintain body heat during the subsequent ice age.\n\n**Discovery:** The herd of SCP-5893 specimens was discovered in the town of Ennis, Montana, United States, after the former suffered a massive fire that destroyed most of the community. Foundation operatives initiated vigilance of the town after reports of \"lizard-like horned creatures\" surfaced from members of the community as an explanation for the fire. \n\nAfter 5 days of monitoring, the herd of SCP-5893 instances was located, captured, and subsequently transported to Area-5893. A disinformation campaign describing the event as a fire caused by faulty wiring at the local library was launched. Additionally, all witnesses were administered Class C amnestics.\n-----\n**Addendum 5893.1:** The following diary was recovered from 11-year old Timmothy Piers after it was discovered to contain information about the SCP-5893 herd.\n\nBelow are all the entries detailing encounters with SCP-5893 instances.\n~~~~~\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[<]]\n~~~~~\n[[size 120%]]15th of March 2010\n@@ @@\nToday I woke up at 7:AM.
