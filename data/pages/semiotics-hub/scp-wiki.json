SPHERE may or may not be interpreted as a facet of Fifthism, or merely yet another competing malignant force on reality.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Pattern Screamers\n[[/=]]\n\nPattern Screamers and/or Pattern Screamer adjacent entities are featured throughout Semiotics as stated or implied adversaries to the Foundation & Site-196's efforts. Pattern Screamers within Semiotics are not to be treated as characters, but rather vague presences alluded to via their influence on anomalous phenomena or procedures. Entities such as those implied in SCP-7419 or SCP-8995 are subject to extensive linguistic workarounds as a key feature.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Selective Thought Blockers\n[[/=]]\n\nSTBs are referenced in Semiotics, and are a staple of Site-196 containment efforts. Derived from Class-C Amnestics, these medications constrain depth of thought, useful for mitigating certain anomalous phenomena that propagate through speculative or perceptive thought such as SCP-7783.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ The Thinker\n[[/=]]\n\nAn almost exclusively allusive or subtextual force that dictates or processes meaning on a universal scale. One of the core conceits of the Semioticsverse is that there appear to be objective meanings, and that these meanings are crucial to the continued functioning of reality as we understand it. The Thinker (possibly in the form of SCP-001 in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/poufys-proposal | Poufy's Proposal]]] or the Serpent-Worm in SCP-8995/SCP-7794) may be a singular entity, or merely a dictating force.

Can be presented as similarly otherworld in personality to her slime-like physical presence.\n\n+++++ Jules Lazaret - Site Director (former, disgraced)\nUnder posthumous Ethics Committee investigation for alleged human & anomaly rights violations during experimentation. If explicitly depicted, disarmingly affectionate towards children despite & due to his moral shortcomings.\n\n+++++ Jason Stepham - Containment Specialist for SCP-7793 [SPHERE]\nLead the containment team for SPHERE following acquisition. Former colleague of Winston Middelberg. Periodically disappears from the site for unclear reasons.\n\n+++++ Winston Middelberg - Junior Researcher\nProtagonist of SPHERE. Flighty, anxious, incompetent, somewhat emotionally stunted.\n\n+++++ Kaiden Powell - SCP-7783 Research Lead\n\nThe pre-eminent authority on PASCs and other non-biological consciousnesses within Site-196. Deeply depressed following the loss of River Cories. Has difficulty socializing with those outside of his circle.\n\n+++++ River Cories - PASC-01\nFormerly human conceptual sapience, former colleague and partner of Kaiden Powell. Discoverer of SCP-7783. Loud, vivacious, intensely extroverted. \"Class Clown\"\n\n+++++ Dr. James Hilbre - Site-196 Medical Staff\nSleazy, seedy, gross. Always gets away with it.\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab How To Write]]\n\nSemiotics is a Surrealist-Absurdist Horror SCP-centric canon primarily focusing on the inevitable failure of the Foundation & Site-196 to prevent reality-restructuring forces and anomalies, eventually concluding in the events of SPHERE. \n\nArticles within the setting of Semiotics primarily take place either within Site-196's ranks[[footnote]] Such as SCP-7783, SCP-8995, and SCP-7795 [[/footnote]], other Foundation sites prior to Site-196 acquisition[[footnote]] Such as SCP-7419 and SCP-3169. [[/footnote]], or in post-meaning post-apocalyptic scenarios[[footnote]] Such as SPHERE or Poufy's Proposal. [[/footnote]] Documentation usually takes the form of hyperclinical and dense verbiage, with occasional stylistic tone breaks if necessary. This is usually in contrast to human narratives within the universe largely tackling loss, burnout, and especially alienation & abandonment. Characters within Site-196 and Semiotics as a whole are portrayed as steadfast and hopeless agents in the way of larger forces, often far beyond their comprehension. Leadership ethos within Site-196 is generally ambitious and hubristic, trying and often failing to transcend human limitations in dealing with the otherworldly threats it voluntarily takes on. Despite this, the Foundation is generally unaware of the true extent of most the anomalies under its purview in Site-196, as best illustrated in SCP-7419 and SCP-7575, and to catastrophic effect in the events of SPHERE. \n\nHighly personal subject matter is strongly encouraged. Semiotics articles generally tackle personal themes and subject matter, abstracted extrensively through these surrealist sci-fi anomalies that represent exaggerations of how these subject matters //feel// to the author. While it isn't strictly necessary for the themes to be personal, subtext is important to the universe's overall themes of burnout and personal collapse.\n\nFurther questions about the universe can be answered by [[*user PoufyPoufson]] via wikidot PM or discord message on the official SCP Wiki Discord. \n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
