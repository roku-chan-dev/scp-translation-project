This of course was not by design, but rather due to the fact of the everchanging sociopolitical state and the power structures of the city. It never allowed Ambrose Restaurants to truly branch out into where the elites truly banquet. That being, of course, within the clean heights of the Ruling District. That, however, will soon be merely a thought of the past, never to be a reality again.\n\nTo commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Great Factory Purge]]] and the damnation of the more feral part of the Fae species -- the disgusting poor the richer and Mab disposed of during said attack so many years ago -- to **##green|hell itself##** Ambrose Restaurants has the great pleasure to announce the opening of a whole new locale, located entirely within the elite streets of the Ruling District. Ambrose Esterberg will open soon in the clean, rich halls of Esterberg so that all remaining Fae can banquet like they deserve -- without the awful plebs.\n\nIn collaboration with Marshall, Carter & Darke, the newest establishment will open with the wonders of a whole new, special all-night dinner event, designed for the Fae elites of the city to remember their civilization like it was millennia ago. Filled with Fae cuisine meals, art, and a reading of a select few most beautiful pieces of the Fae literature -- both prose and poetry -- the night will undoubtedly be not be forgotten for a long, long time.\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; word-break: normal;\"]]\n= //__March 23rd, 2011__//[[/span]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= [[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; border-bottom: 1px solid #A38800;\"]]@@ Rise @@[[/span]]\n\n1. **Four-leafed Rosół** -- The traditional flavors of Poland's exemplary soup, spiced up with four-leafed horseradish fresh from the ruins of Mab's very own gardens established shortly after the race's emergence from the forests. Equating to a deep and truly pleasurable taste, it's a fantastic dish to begin the night with.\n2. **The Night's Goulash** -- Experience the sharp and salty flavors of the mass genocides of [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]] that followed the gaining of consciousness by the Fae, orchestrated by the disgusting animal versions of them in order to take control as the dominant species. Served with sensational rye bread and topped with a parsley decoration.\n3.  **The Stew of One Thousand Skies** -- A combination of the contrasting soft meat of the animals and hard vegetables of the old days, brought to today's age through rapid re-animation. Served with a sweet sugar star taken directly from the glistering skies the Fae looked at when their buildings didn't yet reach them.\n\n= [[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; border-bottom: 1px solid #A38800;\"]]@@  Apex @@[[/span]]\n\n1. **Draconic Steak à la beatitudinem** -- Nothing better to heat up the party after the melancholic memories of the beginnings than fresh spicy draconian meat, served with couple swirls of the contrast of the sweet [[[SCP-999|pure happiness]]]. Similar in feel to the feeling of establishing a sociopolitical structure that's beneficial to your friends after taking over the world together with the people you'll soon exploit.\n2. **Tastes of Beauty** -- Breast of Desert Phoenix -- a race bioengineered by the Inventor so many years ago with the only mission to clean the planet of the feral Fae kind by its higher brothers after they developed well enough in their clean palaces to know of such magic. Painted with a mixture of candied apple and pear glaze, bringing the fiery texture of meat and the calming stream of glaze to a dish of many tastes.\n3. **The Queen's Gift** -- To experience the empire is to experience its habits, too -- and there's no better way to do that than with the feeling of pureness and calmness as felt during its power height this unique mix of ancient flora offers. Server with mayonnaise and sharp bread crisped topping.\n\n= [[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; border-bottom: 1px solid #A38800;\"]]@@ Fall @@[[/span]]\n\n1. **Reliving** -- Even if \"those who don't know history are condemned to repeat it\" is the main motto of the event, \"Reliving\" is the true highlight of the show. A cherry-filled pure white chocolate cake, decorated with strawberry-chiseled scenes taken directly from the history of the Fae. Beginnings in the forests, through world domination, to the inevitable fall of the lower race to the distant lands and the dissolving of empire during the First Diaspora. It is truly a sight to behold, making the mistakes that lead to its fall remembered.\n2. **The Blood Fountain** -- Blood was the only thing those said to be below the high Fae knew their entire lives, especially during the falling of the kingdom, and now, you can know that too. The deep tastes of a dark chocolate fondant contrasted with the even sweeter arctic vanilla mousse on the inside, the dish truly shows the horrors of the rules trying to find victims for their own destructive lifestyle.\n3. **Dungeons' Ices** -- If you want to know how the mostly innocent prisoners of the falling empire felt like in their cells located miles below the ground, then there's no better way to do so than this sharp and mind-freezing ice cream mix. Garnished with bitter liquid chips taken directly from the horn of a unicorn.\n\n= [[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; border-bottom: 1px solid #A38800;\"]]@@ Retaking @@[[/span]]\n\n1. **Cannibalistic Bloody Mary** -- There's no better way to start a good drinking session than with a drink that reacts to your conversations! Cold vodka, sentient (and [[[scp-504|overly critical]]]!) tomato juice, and a small droplet of Fae blood to reminisce the cannibalistic practices of the hungry aristocrats when there was no power left to exploit. A truly hot and deep-tasting wonderful mix that will leave you wanting more.\n2. **Mab's Best** -- A glass of sensical Port, poured from barrels taken directly from the now-ruined basements of Queen Mab's millennia-old palace. As powerful and sharp in taste as the feelings of disgust known on a daily basis to so many Fae elites, it is truly an experience.\n3. **Forest's Kiss** -- A revitalizing, non-alcoholic mix of the sweetest fruits of the old forests which retook the previously untouchable clean palaces. Perfect for those that wish to re-gain their senses after a night full of sensations.\n\n= [[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; border-bottom: 1px solid #A38800;\"]]@@ Fine Attractions @@[[/span]]\n\n1. **Poetry Appreciation** -- To ease the minds of guests who fully participated in prior meals and listened to stories behind them, this attraction will come in handy -- a selection of the most beautiful pieces of Fae literature from the old days, describing the greatness and invulnerability of the empire at its highest points.\n2. **Magical Concert** -- If the previous attraction didn't ease the racing minds of the guests, the second one definitely will. There is nothing quite as beautiful as the sounds of the strings of golden harps taken from Mab's palaces, beautified by the usage of calming and dumbing down rituals.\n3. **Remembrance Gallery** -- To finish the evening in style, all guests will be able to visit a gallery filled with found artworks of the old empire, protected and cleaned for viewing ease. On the way to the exit, all guests will be able to make themselves remembered too, by [[span id=\"names\"]]leaving their names [[/span]] in the guest book.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; word-break: normal;\"]]\n= //__Tickets: 1500 PLN__//[[/span]]\n-----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@ \n\n[[div style=\"background: antiquewhite; border: 1px solid silver; padding: 1em;\"]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[size 400%]]##firebrick|**Critique Lodge**##[[/size]]\n~~~~\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n,,**Esterberg, Częstochowa, Poland**,,\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; width: 80%; margin: auto; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.4); padding: 1em; background: white\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 1.2em; font-family: serif\"]]\n**##purple|A Large-feathered Fellow##**\n☆☆☆☆☆\n[[/div]]\n\n**##purple|I don't understand where I am.
