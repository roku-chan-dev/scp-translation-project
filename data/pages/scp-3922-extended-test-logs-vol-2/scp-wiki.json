  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n> **Log Format**\n> Subject: <Video title>, <Date of release>, <MPAA rating, if any>\n> Interference Point: <Where, during the course of the video, SCP-3922 was introduced> \n> Result: <Results>\n> Note: <Notes, if Any>\n\n**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, during which presenter Chris Rock improvised a joke at the expense of the physical appearance of attendee Jada Pinkett Smith, in response to which Pinkett Smith's husband Will Smith got up from the audience, walked onto the stage, and slapped Rock in the face, then returned to his seat and shouted obscenities at Rock.\n**Interference Point**: None.\n**Result**: No changes from the original footage.\n\n**Subject**: The 94th Academy Awards ceremony, digitally edited so that every frame of host Amy Schumer depicted her with bright green skin, and antennae growing out of her forehead.\n**Interference point**: Beginning.\n**Result**: A cold open shows Rock backstage, in conversation with three tuxedo-wearing instances of SCP-3922-A. The instances recommend that he not mock anyone's physical appearance, as this could make him seem insensitive and unlikable; they then suggest various other current topics he could use as subject material. Rock improvises several jokes on those topics, then explains that he can no longer tell those jokes on stage, as he just told them on camera. He assures the instances that \"everything will be fine, don't worry,\" then turns his back on them and, rolling his eyes, whispers to the camera that \"no Three Moons stooges are gonna tell //me// who I can't offend!\" During the ceremony itself, when Rock is presenting the award for Best Documentary Feature, he mentions Pinkett Smith's presence in the audience, pauses noticeably, then makes the same joke about her physical appearance as in baseline reality. Smith slaps Rock, then returns to his seat; the camera then shows Rock looking offstage, where the instances of SCP-3922-A have been watching. They shake their heads. The ceremony then continues as in baseline reality, with the exception that later shots of the audience show the instances sitting next to Smith and talking quietly with him; Smith appears significantly more distressed than in baseline reality. Forty minutes later, when Smith receives the Academy Award for Best Actor, he ends his acceptance speech by thanking the Three Moons Initiative for allowing him to stay for the remainder of the ceremony. A montage then depicts the professional and personal consequences experienced by both Smith and Rock over the next several weeks; these are largely the same as in baseline reality, except in that Smith is accompanied by an instance of SCP-3922-A at all times, and approximately 5% of people visible in the montage have bright green skin, and antennae growing out of their foreheads.\n\n**Subject:** //Ratatouille//, 2007, G\n**Interference Point:** In the montage showcasing the returning popularity of Auguste Gusteau's restaurant, just before the press conference scene.\n**Result:** As Linguini and Remy look at a view of Paris within their new apartment, the cheerful background music cuts out as multiple explosions occur in the sky and white light covers the screen. The light fades, revealing an army of SCP-3922-A spaceships teleporting above the city. A voice announces that the Three Moons Initiative have declared war on France due to an alleged, millennia-spanning history of oppression towards a species of sapient, highly-intelligent rodents. Remaining footage transforms into a 6-hour war film concerning Linguini and Remy's attempts to escape the ruined leftovers of Paris. The subject of cooking is never acknowledged after this point.\n\n**Subject**: //Minecraft Xbox - Sinking Feeling [124]// an episode of a Minecraft let’s play by YouTuber Stampylonghead, 2013, Not Rated\n**Interference Point**: 15 minute mark\n**Result:** Shortly after the SS Stumpy pulls up next to Hit the Target's ship, a third ship is seen in the distance. It is a modern looking destroyer with the Three Moons logo re created on the bow of the ship with blocks. Several instances of SCP-3922-A, identical to those seen in the previous 2b2t test, are present on the ship. Stampy is sceptical as to whether or not the mysterious ship is hostile, but becomes quite pleased when it begins to fire cannons at Hit the Target's ship. The battle mostly carries out as normal, with the added effect of the SCP-3922-A instances fighting alongside Stampy and L for Lee. Eventually, seeing the battle has gone into a stalemate between the three ships, Stampy attempts to summon the kraken. After all 3 ships shake violently in the water, the “kraken” is revealed to be IBalsticSquid, similarly to the unaltered video. It should be noted that upon closer inspection of the video, during the shaking shaking sequence, several SCP-3922-A instances can be seen taking advantage of the chaos to board Hit the Target's ship. After Squid boards the SS Stumpy, the gang of 3 prepare to attack Hit the Target once more, only to realize that he has been apprehended by SCP-3922-A instances. Hit the Target is loaded up onto the Three Moons destroyer, and an instance walks up to Stampy, who hands him a book informing him that Hit the Target will no longer be a threat to him and the world, “Signed: ☽☽☽”. The destroyer then leaves the location. Stampy expresses some confusion over the situation, but is happy that Hit the Target won’t be a threat anymore, and promises that the mysterious men will get a place in his love garden in the next video. Stampy then ends with his regular outro.\n\n**Subject:** //Dune// extended edition[[footnote]]While this film is credited to Alan Smithee (a pseudonym used by directors who wish to forfeit association with a project), its actual director was David Lynch.[[/footnote]], 1984, PG-13\n**Interference Point:** During the assassination attempt against Paul using the Hunter-Seeker.\n**Result:** As Paul is preparing himself to disable the device, a bullet from offscreen destroys it. Two SCP-3922-A instances enter to make sure he is calm and uninjured, before escorting him to an undisclosed location, claiming they need to keep him \"protected\".  A large scale conflict can be seen breaking out amongst numerous Sardaukar and SCP-3922-A instances before Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Piter De Vries are captured. After being taken to an isolated area, one of the instances lists both their crimes, including treason, bribery, accepting bribes, brainwashing, taking of hostages, and general tyrannical governance. They are both executed shortly after.\nDuke Leto Atreides is questioned by another instance over his involvement in the Landsraad's war crimes and human rights violations, and a fleet of ships marked with the Three Moon's insignia are sent off to the Emperor's home world. The film ends with the Three Moons Initiative plotting to ensure Paul eventually becomes Emperor.\n**Note:** //Huh, I was not expecting that at all. The whole point of Dune is there are no good guys, and even the protagonists are tyrants. Maybe it's because this version of the film ended with that stupid \"Paul's reign brings peace to the universe!\" bs?// - Researcher Bark\n\n**Subject:** //Dune//, 2021, PG-13\n**Interference Point:** Beginning of the film, during the scene of the Fremen rebelling against the Harkonnens.\n**Result:** Fremen are seen fighting alongside SCP-3922-A instances in the Arrakis desert. When the film cuts to the Atreides on Caladan, they are shown to be executed via firing squad. The film ends with the Three Moons Initiative painting their insignia onto Carthag after seizing it for themselves and the Fremen.\n**Note:** //Yeah that's more what I was expecting.// - Researcher Bark\n\n**Subject:** //Red Flags (ft. Montaigne) OFFICIAL VIDEO//, 2022\n**Interference Point:** At the 1:28 minute mark \n**Result:** The waiter is replaced with an instance of SCP-3922-A wearing a bowtie and apron. Upon asking //\"Bonjour, sir was blinking at me, is this because your date is a freak?// The male replies //\"Oui\"//. The video then immediately cuts to the female character getting thrown into a dumpster.\n**Note:** It should be noted there are many fan animations based on this music video. Particularly the scene where the one of the characters begins blinking to get the waiter's attention. However, SCP-3922-A instances only appears if the fan animation includes a scene with a character stating that their favorite movie is //\"Human Centipede\"//.\n\n**Subject:** //The Blues Brothers//, 1980, R\n**Interference Point:** After Elwood Blues is pulled over for running a red light\n**Result:** Unchanged, except that all law enforcement and military personnel pursuing the protagonists are replaced with 3922-A instances, as are roughly half of the musical sequences' backup dancers.\n\n**Subject:** //The Rocky Horror Picture Show//, 1975, R\n**Interference Point:** At the end of \"Hot Patootie\", as Frank approaches Eddie with a pickax, intending to murder him\n**Result:** Several instances of SCP-3922-A emerge from the crowd of Transylvanians and arrest Frank before he can attack Eddie. They offer Eddie medical attention for his pre-existing wounds, which he declines; instead, he and Columbia ride his motorcycle away. A team of SCP-3922-A instances escort Brad and Janet to the castle's front door and back outside, ignoring Brad's repeated requests to use the telephone. The castle takes off, in an identical scene to the one which occurs towards the end of the original movie. The picture fades to black as Brad and Janet walk back up the road in the storm.\n**Note:** Researchers Blaine and Grey each independently reported hearing, during the screening, a number of disembodied voices yelling commentary on the film. For example, each of Brad's requests to use the telephone drew the response \"Castles don't have phones, asshole\".\n\n**Subject:** Playthrough recording of Mass Effect, 2008, Rated M by ESRB. For the purposes of the playthrough, Shepard was of \"soldier\" class, and player made all \"Paragon\" dialogue decisions during the course of gameplay.\n**Interference Point:** On Eden Prime, when Saren raised his firearm to kill Nihlus\n**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances manifested with weapons that appeared similar to in-game Geth Pulse Rifles and attacked Saren; however, Nihlus interpreted them as being additional Geth constructs and joined Saren in attacking them. Saren would take Nihlus with him aboard Sovereign, leading to Nihlus getting indoctrinated. The bomb defusal scene is skipped and SCP-3922-A recovers the Prothean Beacon. \n\nSeveral characters and plot points are changed. Notably, Urdnot Wrex and Liara T'Soni (along with the Citadel Council and the entire plotline of the planet Therum) do not appear at all. An instance of SCP-3922-A joins Shepard's crew along with Garrus, with \"soldier\" class and maxed out stats and abilities, and directs the player to quest destinations. Matriarch Benezia's boss fight is replaced with a separate boss fight against an indoctrinated Nihlus. Saren's base on Virmire is completely overrun by SCP-3922-A, and Saren is terminated by an Impaler event from SCP-2578-D, which also later takes part in the battle against Sovereign. Both Ashley Williams and Kaidan Alenko survive to the end of the game. The SCP-3922-A instance in Shepard's crew warns that the Reapers are still a threat, and attempts to recruit Shepard into the Three Moons Initiative, but Shepard declines, stating they have their own universe to protect. Satisfied with this answer, the SCP-3922-A entities present demanifest.\n\n**Note:** //This test was highly controversial ever since the Star Wars test, but the O5 council approved it, as TMI's capabilities already outstrip anything they could get from the Mass Effect universe, and Shepard in the first game was just a normal human that hadn't been cybernetically enhanced yet. Still, testing on the sequels or on playthroughs with other character decisions remains prohibited. We barely dodged a bullet there with that recruitment pitch.// -Dr. Naismith\n\n**Subject:** [[[https://youtu.be/djsJqNAGMuY|MURDER DRONES - Episode 3: The Promening]]], 2023, not rated\n **Interference Point:** 10:57\n **Result:** Upon V's arms being pierced, all background noises stop as approximately 23 instances of SCP-3922-A barge into the room, holding flash grenades and shotguns. Doll's expression immediately changes into fear as instances of SCP-3922-A toss a flash grenade at Doll as another instance places down a small metal cube with the words \"nullifier\" written on it. As several SCP-3922-A instances dogpile on top of Doll and place handcuffs on her. The camera cuts to a group of SCP-3922-A instances freeing V from the metal rods, before apprehending her as well. One instance goes up to the microphone and shouts how V and Doll have been arrested for murder and attempted murder. The video cuts to the regular SCP-3922-A endscreen.\n\n**Subject:** The above-mentioned test, which was screen-recorded, downloaded into a .mp4 file, and then replayed with SCP-3922 close by.\n **Interference Point:** 10:57\n**Result:** The speed and agility of SCP-3922-A were greatly increased, being able to finish the job ~9.5 seconds faster.\n\n\n**Subject**: //SPACE KING//, 2024\n**Interference Point**: At the 0:05 second mark. \n**Result**: As a Star Defender enters to abduct a prepubescent boy, the child is revealed to be an instance of [[[SCP-5298]]] and quickly terminates the soldier. The next scene shows multiple male and female SCP-5298 instances along with numerous instances of SCP-3922-A fighting the Star Defenders and forcibly entering their ships. The video ends with the discovery, imprisonment, trial, and execution of the eponymous Space King and his four sons for crimes of abduction, slavery, and genocide on an intergalactic scale and the dismantlement of Space King's Empire.\n\n**Subject**: //The Muppets//, 2011, PG\n**Interference Point**: When Walter, Gary, and Mary meet Kermit the Frog \n**Result**: An instance of SCP-3922-A identified as [[[SCP-4922|PoI-4922-Prime]]] manifests within Kermit's Mansion. Colonel James Henson manages to easily convince Kermit the Frog to stop Tex Richman by any means necessary. The film cuts to a montage of Kermit, Walter, and Gary assembling all The Muppets in considerably less time than in the unaltered film. The film subsequently cuts to Henson and The Muppets negotiating the purchase of The Muppet Theatre. Following Tex Richman's song and refusal, Tex Richman is tied up and kidnapped in a similar fashion to Jack Black in the unaltered film. The Film then Cuts to The Muppets producing a show with Tex Richman as the guest host. The Sketches featured in the show involve the torture and eventual execution of The Moopets, Statler, Waldorf, Uncle Deadly, and Bobo the Bear, culminating in a rendition of the Rainbow Connection with Tex Richman being electrocuted and blown-up in a fireworks display. \n**Note**: This movie is notable for being the first time where the violence and contents of the altered version of the film far exceeds the original rating.\n\n**Subject**: //A pre recorded play through of the mission “Red Dead Redemption” in the game Red Dead Redemption 2//, 2018, Game Rated Mature\n**Note**: For this test, 2 identical play throughs were used. One with a High Honour Arthur Morgan and the other with a Low Honour Arthur\n**Interference Point**: When the Pinkertons storm the Van Der Linde camp\n**Result:** In place of the Pinkertons, an army of SCP-3922-A  instances storm the camp. The gang evacuates the camp similarly to the unaltered play through, as the dialogue between Arthur Morgan and John Marston change slightly as they question why the Pinkertons looked a little off, though they assume it’s due to not being able to get a good look at them before running away. When the game reaches point where the player must decide if Arthur goes back to the camp to get the money or to help John escape, Arthur chooses to help John escape, similarly to the unaltered play through. Things play out as usual, with Arthur sending John away in the usual spot while Arthur distracts what he assumes to be the Pinkertons, before Arthur begins his fistfight with Micah Bell. From this point onward, the recordings change depending on Arthur’s honour level, both recordings described below.\n**Low Honour**: Mid fight, the SCP-3922-A instances reach Arthur and Micah, who shoots Micah. The 3922-A instances approach Arthur, and they begin to read off the several crimes Arthur committed throughout the play through. Then what looks to be a more senior member of the 3 Moons approaches Arthur and puts a gun to his head. The 3 Moons soldier tells Arthur that “You had a chance of Redemption, but you refused to take it. You knew this was coming, you prick” before killing Arthur with a shot to the head. Then we get a final cutscene, showing John running through the woods back to his family, where he is stopped by a 3922-A instance. Said instance begins to speak to John, who acknowledges that although John has done some pretty bad things, the Three Moons could tell that he was a good person deep down, who wanted the best for his family. So John is let go after agreeing that he will live the rest of his life as a law abiding citizen. The cutscene ends with John approaching Copperhead Landing, where his family is waiting whilst the screen fades to black. The end credits which would normally only appear after the final mission in Epilogue Part 2, begin to play, with many of the cutscenes altered to instead show scenes depicting John and his family after the events of Chapter 6, where they travel to the Yukon to be part of the gold rush, before eventually moving into Beecher’s Hope and building their ranch there. There is also a scene depicting several SCP-3922-A instances dismantling the Pinkerton Detective Agency due to several cases of corruption and brutality.\n**High Honour**: Micah Bell is shot off Arthur, and a 3922-A instance drags his body off an injured Arthur Morgan. Shortly after that, Dutch Van Der Linde is seen being dragged up the mountain where Arthur is, before being fatally shot in the back. After witnessing Dutch’s death, Arthur begins to pass out, where we get a cutscene from his pov, where Arthur is placed onto a stretcher and loaded onto a Three Moons spacecraft, before passing out. Several days later, Arthur wakes up on a hospital bed, understandably confused. After noticing Arthur is awake, a medic goes to grab Arthur food, and is later followed by a second 3922-A instance into the room. There Arthur is given a talk similar to John in the low honour play through, where his wrongdoings are acknowledged, but how he also did a very good job at redeeming himself. For that reason, the Three Moons decided to give Arthur a second chance at life, by bringing him onboard and fixing him up from the injuries he faced during the fight with Micah. The Three Moons also gave Arthur the proper medication to cure him from his tuberculosis whilst unconscious. Cut to a day later, and we get a final cutscene of Arthur being offloaded into a field near where John Marston and his family are camping for the night. A 3922-A instance asks Arthur to give John a similar talk about becoming a good citizen and such as to save them the trouble of doing it themselves, before flying away. We end with Arthur walking to John's camp, before fading to black. An end credit sequence similar to the low honour one is played, but the cutscenes depict Arthur joining John in his journeys as well.\n**Note**: “Now I’m just kinda sad we didn’t see this in the base game” - Dr. Lamb\n\n**Subject:** A recording of a playthrough of Ratchet & Clank, 2002, game rated T\n**Interference Point:** On Veldin, after Ratchet retrieves Clank from the crash site\n**Result:** Instead of the usual cut scene that would play where the characters view the infobot that gives them coordinates for Novalis, two SCP-3922-A instances arrive outside of Ratchet's garage to caution him for stealing scrap and attempting to steal a sentient being, informing him that \"robots are people too, and have better things to do in life than be your car keys!\" before confiscating Clank. When the game cuts to Drek's ship, separate SCP-3922-A instances are seen having a firefight with a number of Blarg soldiers and executing Drek. Captain Qwark is seen in the background, insisting he was part of Drek's master plan as well, but he is ignored by the SCP-3922-A instances.\nThe parts of planets that Drek had harvested so far are crafted into a small moon and repurposed into a refugee hub for any survivors of Drek's actions. The end credits are replaced with \"☽☽☽ DON'T WASTE CELESTIAL DEBRIS ☽☽☽\".\n\n**Subject:** //The Purge//, 2013, R\n**Interference Point:** During the credits\n**Result:** At the very end of the credits is the following disclaimer: //\"The ☽☽☽ Initiative does not condone The Purge under any circumstances. You are watched. You are protected. You are loved.//\n**Note:** //I can only assume that because of the legality of all crime and the suspension of emergency services, the ☽☽☽ can't touch this.//- //Professor Mint//\n\n**Subject:** //The Purge: Election Year//, 2016, R\n**Interference Point:** When \"Candy Girl\" tries to steal from Joe Dixon's store.\n**Result:** A single instance of SCP-3922-A in place of a Laney and arrests her. Later in the film following the commencement of The Purge with Government immunity revoked, all agents and members of The New Founding Fathers of America are killed with [[[SCP-2578|Impaler Events]]] as soon as they appear on screen. Members of the Crips are replaced with instances of SCP-3922-A. Following The Purge, Senator Roan wins the presidential election by a landslide and The Purge is abolished. The film ends with the Purge Tourists arrested by instances of SCP-3922-A and deported back to their home countries, where they are tried for their various crimes on the grounds that \"The Purge\" was only for American citizens.\n\n**Subject:** //Don Quixote//, 2000, PG\n**Interference Point:** None\n**Result:** None\n**Note:** No. Absolutely not. We do not need another [[[SCP-4028]]] on our hands. --Director Naismith\n\n**Subject:** //Barbie//, 2023, PG-13\n**Interference Point:** When Stereotypical Barbie is driving away from Barbieland in her convertible.\n**Result:** In addition to Beach Ken, a Barbie and Ken identifying themselves as Space Police Barbie and Ken wearing Bright Pink versions of ☽☽☽ Armor convince Stereotypical Barbie and Beach Ken that they have been to the real world and can help guide them. Space Police Ken helps Barbie find Gloria without being harassed or getting arrested. Space Police Barbie helps teach Ken about the Patriarchy but also explains its flaws and how to develop a sense of self-worth independent of receiving Stereotypical Barbie's affections. Eventually, The Barbies and Kens meet back together with Gloria and Sasha and decide to return with her to Barbieland. At Barbieland, Space Police Barbie and Ken show Gloria and Sasha the importance and value of the idea of Barbie for inspiring women, reconciling Gloria and Sasha's relationship and curing Stereotypical Barbie of her depression. Space Police Barbie and Ken then manage to convince the Barbie Government to build houses and provide better jobs for the Kens. The film ends with the ghost of Ruth Handler, Stereotypical Barbie's Creator, telling her that she never created Space Police Barbie or Ken, but she is glad Barbie [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sandrewswann-s-proposal inspired someone to dream them up]. The film ends the same in the original, with Stereotypical Barbie taking Ruth's hand and becoming a human being.\n\n**Subject:** //SMG4 Movie: PUZZLEVISION//, 2024\n**Interference Point:** N/A\n**Result:** N/A\n**Note:** Considering the outcome of the previous SMG4 test, sending SCP-3922-A against an ACTUAL threat like Mr. Puzzles would not fare any better. Worst case scenario is that Mr. Puzzles becomes aware of us and pulls our reality into his simulation. Furthermore, testing on //SMG4 Movie: REVELATIONS// is banned due to SMG0 being an equal threat to our reality if he became aware of us. -Senior Researcher Talapus\n\n**Subject:** //The Little Mermaid//, 1989, PG\n**Interference Point:** After Ariel is turned into a human by King Triton. \n**Result:** Four instances of SCP-3922-A arrest Prince Eric. They inform him that he has committed the great crime of Regicide against former Queen of the Ocean Ursula. Eric is subsequently hanged, drawn, and quartered, much to Ariel's horror.\n**Note:** //Between this movie and \"The Purge\", it would seem that the internal legality of a movie can not only prevent interferences but also change who would be targeted by SCP-3922-A instances. Ursula's contract was legally and magically binding as well as unbreakable even to the ruling monarch King Triton. Triton willingly sold his authority to Ursula to save Ariel. Ursula also never coerced or lied to anyone when discussing the terms of her contracts. So, for all intents and purposes, Ursula actions were [[[SCP-4703|perfectly legal]]] and in the clear.// -//Professor Mint//\n\n**Subject:** //Charlie and the Chocolate Factory//, 2005, PG\n**Interference Point:** After Mike Teevee is interviewed about finding his Golden Ticket.\n**Result:** The news announcer reports that the ☽☽☽ have issued a court summons to Mel Brooks. Mr. Bucket turns the T.V. off before any more details can be heard. Later, while the Oompa Loompa is channel surfing in Wonka's television room, the shot that originally showed a clip from the Oprah Winfrey show has been replaced with coverage of a courtroom. Director Tim Burton is testifying on the witness stand, saying \"It was never meant as a remake.\" Instead of the usual endscreen, the message reads \"Due to extraneous circumstances, our investigation of the OSHA violations depicted in this movie has been postponed.\"\n**Note:** //Could it be that he finally overstepped his bounds?// -//Dr. Naismith//\n\n\n**Subject**: //Primer//, 2004, PG-13\n**Interference Point**: Final credits\n**Result**: No changes to the movie proper were noted. However, at the end of the final credits, the following text (not present in original version) appears: //\"We watched this eight times in a row and couldn't reach a consensus on what was happening, so we have decided it would be best not to get involved. ☽☽☽ \"//\n\n\n**Subject**: //The Blue Beetle//, 2023, PG-13\n**Interference Point**: None\n**Result**: No changes were noted during screening, nor did an automated frame-by-frame comparison against a copy not exposed to SCP-3922 reveal any differences.\n**Note**: Approximately four hours after the conclusion of this test, Dr. Naismith received an email purporting to be from a Three Moons Initiative staffer, apologizing for their absence during the test, which they claimed was caused by \"getting this mixed up with all the other Marvel movies.\"\n\n**Subject**: //Blade Runner//, 1982, R\n**Interference Point**: When Gaff confronts Deckard in the noodle bar \n**Result**: Gaff is accompanied by six SCP-3922-A instances. They physically restrain Deckard and administer a Voight-Kampff test, which Deckard fails. He is arrested and taken into custody as a rogue replicant. The movie then cuts to a greatly abbreviated version of the original final credits.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 5/2578 Clearance Required\" hide=\"- encryption key accepted.\"]]\n**Subject**: Footage of [[[scp-2578|Incident 2578-1427]]], superimposed with a DPRK-style propaganda narration that paints SCP-2578's presence as an invasion, and depicting the termination of the DPRK personnel guarding SCP-1427 as an act of war against North Korea. \n**Interference Point**: Beginning of the film\n**Result**: A title card appears stating: \"☽☽☽ has determined that this film does not depict the entirety of the truth. Nevertheless, ☽☽☽ has decided to show this film in its entirety.\" A subtitle of \"PROPAGANDA\" appears for the entire duration of the original film. An extended sequence features SCP-3922-A instances initiating a military occupation of Pyongyang, where Kim Jong-un is executed by gunfire. The final title card is replaced by the text of the SCP-2578-C instance originally sent to Dr. Naismith.\n**Note**: This request was approved by an O5 council vote of █ to █ in light of the ban on real-world footage, in order to ascertain how SCP-3922 would react to a film unequivocally depicting the TMI as the villains. To shield the real world narrative from interference, no footage of Foundation locations or personnel was included in the original film.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Subject**: //Jaws//, 1975, PG\n**Interference Point**: After the flyer announcing the $3,000 bounty on the man-eating shark is displayed onscreen\n**Result**: A squad of SCP-3922-A instances enter the mayor's office and serve him with an injunction from the Barnstable Superior Court[[footnote]] The county court of Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which covers Cape Cod and nearby islands. [[/footnote]] forbidding the town of Amity Island from offering a bounty on any great white shark, on the grounds that the great white shark is an endangered species. The remaining 74 minutes of the film depict the town's attempts to have the injunction overturned and the socioeconomic consequences of the collapse of the Amity Island tourist industry.\n\n**Subject:** Recording of a game of //Clue// played by SCP-3922 testing staff, 2024. The camera was angled so that the game board fills the shot, leaving the players offscreen except for their hands when moving their pieces.\n**Interference Point:** None.\n**Result:** No change from the original footage.\n\n**Subject:** Recording of a game of //Clue// played by SCP-3922 testing staff, 2024. Character dialogue based on the events of the game was recorded and added to the footage.\n**Interference Point:** Opening scene.\n**Result:** Immediately after the six dinner guests discover the corpse of their host Mr. Boddy, eight game pieces resembling SCP-3922-A instances are placed on the game board by a pair of hands wearing black tactical gloves. The SCP-3922-A pieces accuse Professor Plum of killing Mr. Boddy by blunt force trauma with a lead pipe in his study, to the shock of the other guests. Plum admits to the crime and begins to explain his motives when the SCP-3922-A pieces fire their weapons at the piece representing him, melting the plastic until it is unrecognisable. The SCP-3922-A pieces then use a device referred to as a “TACTICAL STORMCLOUD DEHYDRATOR” to clear the heavy rain trapping the now terrified guests in Boddy’s mansion and allow them to leave.\n\n**Subject:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkbIjuVZ_54 The Boiled One Phenomenon], (2024), Not Rated\n**Interference Point:** Immediately upon starting the video.\n**Result:** The entire screen becomes covered by a warning message saying “FILM CONTAINS DANGEROUS COGNITOHAZARDS AND IS THEREFORE UNSAFE TO VIEW.” This remains for 2 minutes before ending the video abruptly.\"\n**Note:** //In spite of Phen-228 not being an actual anomaly, SCP-3922-A still treated it as such and redacted the entire video as a result. Maybe SCP-3922-A treats all anomalies, real or fictional, as threats by default? Further research necessary.// -Dr. Avenlee\n\n**Subject:** //Family Guy Seahorse Seashell Party//, October 2, 2011, TV-14+\n**Interference Point:** After Meg calls out her family for their abuse of her.\n**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances come in through the door and arrest Peter and Lois for child abuse and neglect, declaring they are using anti-cutaway gag technology and that any attempt to escape is pointless. Peter remarks he is not ready to be raped and/or molested in prison. SCP-3922-A instances, confused and horrified, ask Peter what makes him think that will happen, at which point he lists various instances in which he has been subjected to sexual assault, referencing moments that occurred onscreen and offscreen. After thirty minutes of this, SCP-3922-A instances quickly assure him this will not happen and that he will be treated humanely.\n\n**Subject:** //Begotten//[[footnote]]An experimental silent horror film directed by E. Elias Merhige. Chosen specifically for its unconventional narrative which depicts the suicide of a robed figure (described as \"God Killing Himself\" in the credits), the resulting births of Mother Earth and the Son of Earth who set out on a journey across a barren landscape and a group of nomads who repeatedly assault the protagonists along the way.[[/footnote]], 1989, Not Rated\n**Interference Point:** The first scene in which the \"God\" disembowels and kills himself.\n**Result:** An SCP-3922-A instance enters the scene from the right and grabs the hand of God holding the blade before he can stab himself in the stomach. The instance then produces a written work titled //As A Man Tinketh//, a 1902 self-help book written by James Allen. The God appears indiffirent and promptly throws the book to the ground. He then whispers into the instance's ear, after which the instance steps back and looks at him, apparently too stunned to speak. The God then proceeds to stab himself and remove his innards. SCP-3922-A does not intervene.\n\nA woman (Mother Earth) later emerges from the God's remains and notices SCP-3922-A. [DATA EXPUNGED] while SCP-3922-A watches, again not intervening for unknown reasons. SCP-3922-A disappears from view after this, leaving Mother Earth to her own devices. The film continues to proceed as normal, with Mother Earth artificially inseminating herself and giving birth to a malformed man called Son of Earth. SCP-3922-A reappears after this, now carrying a minigun of indeterminate model. The trio set out on a journey across a barren landscape and come across a group of nomads along the road who try to attack them, but are repelled by SCP-3922-A's weapon. After walking for roughly an hour, the trio arrive at the edge of a forest. Mother Earth and Son of Earth enter the forrest, but SCP-3922-A does not follow and chooses to look after them until they disappear from sight completely. The instance then leaves the screen and the film ends.\n**Note:** Why the SCP-3922-A instance refused to prevent the God's suicide is unknown at this time. This is a rare case of SCP-3922-A allowing a crime to occur, although some have theorized SCP-3922-A did not consider the God's suicide an immoral act as it led to the birth of the story's protagonists.\n\n**Subject:** //skibidi toilet 74//, May 31, 2024\n**Interference Point:** Moments before the \"Alliance\" is ambushed by a fleet of Astro Toilets.\n**Result:** As several large Astro Toilet ships warp in and ready to fire at the alliance, SCP-3922-A instances materialize in the form of 3 large sci-fi ships, quickly dropping a energy-like shield over the vulnerable alliance members. The toilet fleet engages in combat, causing moderate casualties to  SCP-3922-A but are quickly slaughtered by a barrage of laser fire. The Mothership Astro Toilet lets out a infernal scream, calling in reinforcements as a large SCP-3922-A drone flies over to \"Titan Cameraman\", repairing him of all damage. Titan Cameraman then proceeds to charge towards the injured Mothership Toilet, whilst \"Titan Speakerman\" and \"Titan TV Man\" are also repaired and upgraded before agreeing to fight \"G-Toilet\". A climatic 7-minute long battle occurs, with the titans eventually prevailing. \"☽☽☽ \" is printed on the side of all titan upgrades supplied by SCP-3922-A.\n\nThe POV changes to a montage of alliance members living peacefully, with a large energy shield notably present in the skybox alongside cheerful music. Human characters and models are also seen in the background. The camera changes again, showing Alexey Gerasimov(the series creator) being interrogated by SCP-3922-A instances.  Gerasimov is questioned about his intentions for the series and its effects on children. Gerasimov is eventually dismissed, but is informed that the \"Skibidi Bop\" remix used is unlicensed.\n\n**Subject:** //AI Sponge Rehydrated// \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-zqayvtazE&list=PLqoXvNtMJNUUL8OLX_H3avHCcUcaWXuD6 Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr. Jr.]\" clip recording, April 5, 2024 \n**Interference Point:** When SpongeBob explains the nature of \"Strokefest 22\" to Mr. Krabs as a contest to see who can have the most strokes in one day.\n**Result:** Multiple SCP-3922-A instances appear on the scene as generic fish background characters in Three Moons uniforms and interrupt the characters' strokes,[[footnote]]Here, a \"stroke\" refers to a string of garbage noise made by a character when their AI voice glitches out, but is usually contextualized in-story as being an actual stroke suffered by the character.[[/footnote]] loading them into ambulances consistent with the designs of ambulances seen in the \t//SpongeBob SquarePants// source material. The segment then abruptly ends and is followed by a \"Bikini Bottom News\" segment labeled \"<News> Strokefest 22 Interrupted\" with \"☽☽☽\" listed as the storyboard director, where the following exchange occurs:\n\n> //The stream's \"The Bikini Bottom News\" intro plays.//\n> **Perch Perkins:** Good evening, Bikini Bottom! This is Perch Perkins, bringing you the latest news from our underwater community. Tonight's top story: Strokefest 22 has been unexpectedly interrupted by members of the Three Moons Initiative. The event, known for its competitive stroke challenges, faced an abrupt halt due to the excessive strokes suffered by the--\n> **SpongeBob SquarePants:** Hi, Perch! You know, we were all just trying to see who could have the most strokes in a day. It was so much fun until some of us started getting really tired and dizzy. I just wanted to keep going, but I guess the Three Moons Initiative had other ideas.\n> **Perch Perkins:** Thanks, SpongeBob. Next, we have Squidward Tentacles, another participant who seemed less enthusiastic about the event.\n> **Squidward Tentacles:** //(loudly)// **OH, PLEASE. THIS WHOLE EVENT WAS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. I KNEW FROM THE START THAT SNIFFING COCAINE JR. LIKE THIS WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA. I'M NOT SURPRISED IT GOT SHUT DOWN. MAYBE NOW I CAN GET SOME PEACE AND QUIET.**\n> **Perch Perkins:** Noted, Squidward. Let's hope that your stay in rehab can help with your cocaine addiction. Now, let's turn to Plankton, who was also present at Strokefest 22. Plankton, what are your thoughts on the interruption?\n> **Sheldon Plankton:** //(loudly)// **WELL, PERCH, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO UNVEIL MY NEWEST INVENTION DESIGNED TO HELP ME WIN THE CHALLENGE WHEN THOSE THREE MOONS INITIATIVE DO-GOODERS SHOWED UP!** //(deep inhale)// **RUINED EVERYTHING! I WAS SO CLOSE TO VICTORY!!!** //(produces a string of loud garbage noise)//\n> **Perch Perkins:** Interesting perspective, Plankton. Lastly, we have an agent from the Three Moons Initiative. //(In the middle of his dialogue, Perch is flung violently against the back wall of the newsroom but is helped back onto his feet immediately by a different instance of SCP-3922-A. Perch's dialogue continues uninterrupted.)// Sir, can you tell us why you felt it necessary to interrupt Strokefest 22?\n> **SCP-3922-A:** Thank you, Perch. Our primary concern is the health and safety of the participants. We observed that many competitors were experiencing extreme brain damage, fatigue and strain, which could lead to serious injuries. Our mission is to promote well-being, and we couldn't stand by and watch as the event escalated to dangerous levels. A stroke is a very serious condition, and we highly recommend seeking immediate medical attention for anyone who happens to suffer from one.\n> **Perch Perkins:** Thank you for that explanation. It seems that while Strokefest 22 was meant to be a fun and competitive event, the intervention of the Three Moons Initiative was crucial in preventing potential harm. That’s all for now, folks. Stay safe and stay tuned for more updates. This is Perch Perkins, signing off. Average length for a line of dialogue should be 10-15 words, to fit --\n\nFollowing the segment, an end card is displayed, similar to the \"Fair Use\" disclaimer displayed when the proprietary software for //AI Sponge Rehydrated// is launched, but with the addition of a \"☽☽☽\" sigil and the text \"Any copyright takedowns of this parody content by Paramount Global (PMI) are a violation of fair use laws in the United States. You are watched. You are protected. You are loved.\" \n\nAnalysis of the new dialogue shows that it was very likely generated through ChatGPT, like all other dialogue in the stream. Furthermore, while the //SpongeBob SquarePants// characters' voices were generated through AI voice models and demonstrated corresponding audio glitches, the voice of the SCP-3922-A instance sounded completely natural and was of quality consistent with normal, human-recorded voice acting.\n\n\n**Subject:** Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Season 1 Episode 1: \"Cruelty\"\nApril 6, 2019, TV-MA\n**Interference Point:** Before Tanjiro Kamado leaves to sell his charcoal.\n**Result:** Three instances of SCP-3922-A stop Tanjiro from leaving and inform him that an incredibly dangerous and powerful demon is approaching his family's home. One of the instances offers to evacuate them down a safer route that will allow them to avoid such danger. Tanjiro and his family subsequently depart from their home following the first instance of SCP-3922-A. The remaining two instances enter The Kamado Residence. Approximately, 2 minutes later the scene shifts to show series antagonist Muzan Kibutsuji entering The Kamado residence with the intention of massacring and devouring the family. Within the house the two remaining instances of SCP-3922-A have disguised themselves as Tanjuro Kamado (Tanjiro Kamado's Father) and Kie Kamado (Kie Kamado) as well as several instances of [[[SCP-5928]]] modeled after their children. As soon as Muzan enters the kitchen where the ☽☽☽ Operatives are hiding, they promptly ambush and attack him. SCP-5928 instances fire a series of Nichirin Rounds coated in Wisteria Poison. One of the SCP-3922-A instances draws a Nichirin blade and attacks in a style resembling \"Breath of the Moon\". The other SCP-3922-A instances draws a paper talisman from an envelope with the phrase \"This is Your Final Form\" repeatedly scrawled upon in it in various languages and manages to attach it to Muzan. After a 15 minute, well-choreographed and animated battle, the ☽☽☽ are able to slay Muzan Kibutsuji with only the loss of a few SCP-5928 instances. The video subsequently cuts to Muzan Kibutsuji waking up in a bamboo forest on [[[SCP-2922]]]. Disoriented, Muzan tests and confirms that he has retained his Blood Demon Art and begins wandering through the forest. He soon encounters the character of Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the Greatest Swordsman and Demon Slayer to have ever lived. Muzan immediately panics and attempts to attack Yoriichi, only for the latter to easily deflect his attacks and mince Muzan to hundreds of pieces using \"Breath of the Sun\". The footage cuts to one day later, where Muzan has fully regenerated only for Yoriichi to appear once again and cut him down. This process continues on for the duration of the footage, which has been extended to 24 hours.\n**Note:** Instances of SCP-3922-A and SCP-5928 appear throughout the footage wearing period appropriate altered versions of Demon Slayer Corps Uniforms and weaponry. SCP-3922-A instances wear a black Gakuran with the Kanji 看 守 愛 printed on the back of it and a white Haori with crescent moon patterns printed all over it. Instances of SCP-5928 are designed similarly to that of the Yorichii Type Zero Battle Doll with a distinctly puppet-like body and movements. The firearms that they used are similar in age, style, and structure to the Shotguns used by the character of Genya Shinazugawa.\n\n**Subject:** Jujutsu Kaisen Season 1 Episode 1: \"Ryomen Sukuna\", October 3, 2020, TV-MA\n**Interference Point:** When Yuji Itadori meets with his grandfather for the final time.\n**Result:** Two instances of SCP-3922-A dressed as medical professionals enter Wasuke Itadori's and place him in a medically induced coma. They inform Yuji Itadori that this is to save is to keep Yuji's Grandfather alive and potentially save the world. Yuji immediately believes him and subsequently leaves the room.[[footnote]] Despite being the series protagonist, Yuji Itadori is notably absent for the duration of the video. [[/footnote]] Later in the video, when Ryomen Sukuna's first finger is being unsealed by the members of the Occult Club, two SCP-3922-A instances enter the room along with Megumi Fushigoro. The instances confiscate the finger from the students and chastise them for playing with such a dangerous cursed object and breaking into the school after hours. Megumi leads them off campus while the instances insert Sukuna's first finger into a device labeled \"Heian Eradicator\". The device triangulates the location of the remaining 19 fingers which are recovered by various Jujutsu Sorcerers and SCP-3922-A instances using Jujutsu in a montage with minimal casualties. The fingers are subsequently fed to Wasuke Itadori, who dies of old age soon after series antagonist Ryomen Sukuna is reincarnated within his body.\n\n**Subject:** koyaanisqatsi, 1982, TV-G\n**Interference Point:** During the opening scenes where the rocket normally begins lifting off, instances of SCP-3922-A are seen inspecting the rocket and pointing, rocket then lifts off as normally depicted. Approximately 20 minutes later, instances of SCP-3922-A are seen administering life saving aid to a person being loaded into the back of an ambulance. During the high speed montage towards the middle of the movie, SCP-3922-A instances can be seen rendering aid and dispensing food. One notable scene has hundreds of instances cleaning up garbage and directing people to food banks. The ending scene where the rocket normally explodes and falls back to earth, the rocket continues on into space, where it disappears from view.\n**Result:** The ending card, normally displaying the meaning of the titular word, instead displays the following: ☽☽☽ You are loved, and you //will// make it. ☽☽☽\n\n**Subject:** A YouTube playthrough of //The Legend of Zelda// (NES), Not Rated.\n**Interference Point:** In the cave where the old man gives Link a wooden sword.\n**Result:** Three instances of SCP-3922-A enter the cave and arrest the old man for attempting to give a child a weapon, and the sword is confiscated. One instance then proceeds to admit Link into a building resembling a US elementary school, where an instance of SCP-3922-A is giving a lesson on basic arithmetic. The rest of the playthrough is reminiscent of a 90s educational game, with slight mentions of Ganon being \"tactically vaporised\" by the ☽☽☽ Initiative. The video ends with the standard ☽☽☽ title card, but with the captions \"STAY IN SCHOOL\".\n**Note:** //\"I hope Link can extend his vocabulary beyond weird shouting noises after this.\"// -Dr. Markov\n\n**Subject:** //12 Angry Men//, 1957, not rated\n**Interference Point:** After a juror first lights a cigarette.\n**Result:** An SCP-3922-A instance enters the jury room and informs the jurors that smoking is not allowed in the courthouse. Juror #8 politely disagrees, pointing out that smoking in indoor workplaces will not be banned in New York until 2003. The SCP-3922-A instance apologizes for interrupting and leaves the room.\n\n**Subject:** \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwOg9Cxur2w Blood Capsules]\", 2018, not rated. A music video (whose sole visual component is a still image of a 45rpm record in its decorative jacket) by The Mountain Goats, in which singer/instrumentalist John Darnielle tells a first-person narrative about a former professional wrestler who loses his job after he quits using steroids, burns through his savings, and decides to escape his debts by faking his death during a staged bank robbery - and realizes too late that the bank guards will not be aware of his plan, and will react to him with genuine violence. The song ends with the narrator waiting in line at the bank, before any confrontation can occur.\n**Interference Point**: None.\n**Result**: No changes from the original footage.\n\n**Subject:** \"Blood Capsules\" by the Mountain Goats, edited to remove the introduction in which John Darnielle specifies that he is a performer singing a song in a recording studio.\n**Interference Point:** End.\n**Result**: Several new verses are added, beginning with \"In stroll a bunch of goons / they intercept the guards / they're all wearing three moons / they tell me life can sure be hard.\" The narrator describes how the instances of SCP-3922-A lead him from the bank and commend his integrity in having quit steroids; they also praise his creativity in terms of problem-solving, but point out that his violent death would have traumatized the bank employees and customers, and tell him that he should not avoid his debts. He thanks the instances for stopping him from making a terrible mistake, then emphasizes that the only profession for which he is qualified is wrestling: \"This treatment's more than I deserve / Maybe I'm not a worthless slob / but like I said before / I can't work any other job\" (referring to a line from the original lyrics: \"I can't work any other job / this was my last and best idea\"). In response, they offer him a position with the Three Moons Initiative. He accepts; the song ends with them taking him \"to a glowing portal / I guess I'll never see this world again / but now I don't have to be mortal / I leave behind my life / and these / blood capsules.\"\n\n**Subject:** Video of John Darnielle singing \"Blood Capsules\" in front of a live audience, edited to remove any introduction.\n**Interference Point**: None.\n**Result**: No changes from the original footage.\n\n**Subject**: [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5733 SCP-5733][[footnote]]Note that this test was performed before the events of Incident 5733-01.[[/footnote]]\n**Interference Point**: When SCP-5733-1 returns to the cul-de-sac.\n**Result**: Heather begins to talk to the camera, after which, a response is heard, presumed to be an instance of SCP-3922-A. The instance instructs Heather to hide out in the basement for a little while. After which, SCP-5733-1 breaks into the basement, after which, Heather is told to escape the household through the basement window. After which, [[REDACTED]]. A title card then displays saying \"Thank you for your time. We are correctly working on a possible solution to this very issue. Thank you.\"\n**Notes**: \"//Talk about a cliffhanger.\"// -Dr.Caldararo\n\n**Subject:** //Dandadan// Season 1 Episode 7: \"To a Kinder World\", November 15, 2024, TV-MA\n**Interference Point:** When the woman who would become the //yōkai// Acrobatic Silky post-mortem gets attacked by loan sharks in her apartment.\n**Result:** Two SCP-3922-A instances stormed the apartment's door, engaging the loan sharks. As the woman tries to tackle one of the loan sharks, she gets thrown to the drawers, but another SCP-3922-A instance picks her up and takes her downstairs. The camera pans to the two initial SCP-3922-A instances overpowering the loan sharks through close-quarters battle tactics and arresting them, before retrieving the woman's child who they stuffed inside a closet room. Later, the scene cuts to the woman receiving first-aid treatment in a room below, where the SCP-3922-A instances hand over the child to her mother, who tearfully hugs her, thanking the SCP-3922-A instances. An SCP-3922-A instance from earlier praises the woman's tenacity in trying to save her daughter, hands her a calling card with the Three Moons Initiative logo, and offers the two to come with them to a secure location where organized crime cannot touch them. The episode ends with the woman and her child walking to a black police van with their belongings, the woman looking at the calling card, deep in thought.\n\n**Subject:** A gameplay video of Doom (1993) Episode 2, Map One \"Deimos Anomaly\" \n**Interference Point:** The Start of the level\n**Result:** The level starts as usual with the player starting with a pistol in a empty room near a teleporter.  Beside the player are 4 more instances of SCP-3922-A in what seem to be the co-op spawn areas. The instances of SCP-3922-A are in sprite format, and seem to resemble the zombiemen enemies and \"Doomguy\" spritesets but with a black color scheme and heavy modifications. The rest of the video showcases the entities fighting alongside the player armed with weapons that resemble the BFG-9000 and Plasma Gun. when the level ends, it is shown on the intermission map that there are giant pixelated dropships bombing multiple areas.\n\n**Subject:** //No Country for Old Men//, 2007, R\n**Interference Point:** Beginning of film.\n**Result:** Film proceeds as a biographical film portraying the life and exploits of American frontiersman and folk hero John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed, from his early childhood in Massachusetts to his death in Indiana in 1845. The film is notable for its extensive length and detail, with a recorded running time of 945 minutes (15 hours and 45 minutes); investigations into the accuracy of the events depicted by the film are currently ongoing. \n**Note:** Test was performed by Dr. King.\n\n**Subject:** //Mashup Week: Megamix//, //Letting Off Steam... (Reveal)//. 2021, Unrated.\n**Interference Point:** Right after Elliana attempts to attack Kid Cobra and Flat Eric\n**Result:** SCP-3922-A instances parachute out of an overhead plane and surround Elliana, but due to her highly aggressive predisposition, are immediately attacked out of the belief that they are associates of Mashup Week. The ensuing fight replaces all extra footage in the original trailer corresponding to Elliana's sources. While some SCP-3922-A instances are wounded, her mech is eventually disabled via a controlled EMP. She is detained in specialized 'snake cuffs', with minimal damage to the surrounding terrain, road, and bus. Additional dialogue from an SCP-3922-A instance appears to commend her for standing up against employment discrimination[[footnote]]Within Rivals of Aether, Elliana is refused employment in the Air Armada on account of being a snake.[[/footnote]], but stresses the importance of serpentine solidarity. \n\nHer final character art and name card are not shown. Instead, a short sequence is played in which an SCP-3922-A instance heavily fines Flat Eric for operating a passenger transport vehicle without a proper license. Rather than imitating the //Rivals of Aether// logo, the ending year card simply reads \"2021\" in plain white Arial, with the ☽☽☽ symbol appearing beneath.\n**Note:** //So are they just running with a 31 character roster now?// - Researcher Diaz\n\n**Subject:** //Ex Machina//, 2014, R.\n**Interference Point:** As Caleb Smith and Nathan Bateman arrive at Bateman's house.\n**Result:** As Bateman's helicopter lands, a large contingent of SCP-3922-A instances are waiting outside the front door. Their commander explains to Bateman that his house has been condemned for \"flagrant, pervasive fire code violations,\" such as electronic door locks which lock shut in case of a power failure. Bateman attempts to convince the commander to let them into the house. When this proves fruitless, Bateman becomes verbally abusive, and finally attempts to punch the commander, who incapacitates him with a stun weapon. The commander orders a thorough search of the house, which reveals the presence of the androids Kyoko and Ava. Bateman is taken into custody, to be charged with assaulting an officer and false imprisonment of sapient entities.",
