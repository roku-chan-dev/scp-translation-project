Testing must take place in a sealed chamber. Test chambers must be cleared for use before testing. Clearance is given to test chambers that show no sign of leakage when under 0.5 megapascals of internal air pressure. Test chambers are to remain sealed until it can be confirmed that SCP-3025 has exited its active state. Recovered items and personnel are to be quarantined until an investigation has confirmed that no anomalous properties are present. As of ██-██-20██, testing of SCP-3025 is prohibited. When in transit, SCP-3025 must remain inside a hermetically sealed container at all times. SCP-3025 is under review for reassignment to Keter class.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-3025 is a white feather, thought to be a primary feather from a black-billed magpie (//Pica hudsonia//).[[footnote]] It is believed that SCP-3025 may have originated from [[[SCP-3076]]]. [[/footnote]] Under most circumstances, SCP-3025 is inert and presents no anomalous features. When completely submerged in any solution composed of more than 80% water, SCP-3025 enters its active state. When in the active state, any solid or liquid matter within the same enclosed space as SCP-3025 will seem to spontaneously combust, except for SCP-3025 itself and the solution it is submerged in. An enclosed space is defined as a continuous region through which air molecules can travel unhindered. Matter that is physically bonded (e.g. weld, airtight seal) to the boundary surfaces of the enclosed space is not affected. Any additional space added to the testing chamber while SCP-3025 is in its active state will be treated as a continuation of the enclosed space, and objects within the new space will be affected by SCP-3025. No upper limit on the size of an enclosed space has been found. Objects that undergo spontaneous combustion leave no ashes or remains of any kind. \n\nTesting with GPS trackers has shown that radio contact is maintained after combustion and that there is no measurable change in position before and after the active state is achieved. SCP-3025 will remain in its active state until 23 hours after it is removed from the solution. Further details from testing are listed in Addendum 3025-1.\n\nIt is hypothesized that objects affected by SCP-3025 continue to exist within an extradimensional space (SCP-3025-A). Video cameras and live subjects affected by SCP-3025 report a barren landscape, with few traces of life. Early exploratory missions have revealed the presence of silver and gold deposits near the surface. No samples from SCP-3025-A have ever been recovered. Further details from exploration missions are listed in Addendum 3025-2. \n\nAny objects affected by SCP-3025 will remain within SCP-3025-A for the duration of the active state, after which they will appear in the test chamber at the same locations they occupied at the beginning of the active state. Any changes in composition or structure sustained while SCP-3025 is in its active state will remain. Upon cessation of the SCP-3025 active state, there is a low probability that an anomalous entity will manifest within the test chamber. Any such entities are referred to as SCP-3025-B. Instances of SCP-3025-B have no unifying characteristics beyond their anomalous nature. A list of SCP-3025-B instances can be found in Addendum 3025-3.\n\n**Addendum 3025-1**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Show Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide log\"]]\n\nAll tests are conducted in a cleared test chamber. Tested aqueous solutions are held in a steel container that is also affected by the SCP-3025 active state. The disappearance of the container is used as an indicator of active phase initialization and automatically ends the submersion of SCP-3025. This ensures the end of the active phase 23 hours after initialization.\n\n||~ Test Number ||~ Materials ||~ Test Description ||\n|| 1 || 1 liter of distilled water || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. At the end of the active phase, the container is recovered. The D-personnel used to administer the test is found deceased. The body has suffered second-degree burns across 90% of its surface area. Further testing is to make minimal use of personnel. ||\n|| 2 || 1 liter of oceanic saltwater || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a 3 millisecond pause. It is hypothesized that this pause is related to the percent water content of the solution. ||\n|| 3 || 1 liter of orange juice || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a 10 second pause.  ||\n|| 4 || 1 liter of pig blood || SCP-3025 does not enter the active state. Eight hours were allowed to pass to confirm that the active state would not begin.  ||\n|| 5 ||1 liter of pig blood, diluted with 100 milliliters of distilled water || SCP-3025 enters the active state after a pause of 20 minutes. ||\n|| 6 || 1 liter of distilled water, 1 GPS tracker, 1 wireless video camera || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. Both items combust. GPS tracker and video camera maintain contact with Foundation radio receivers. Feed from the video camera reveals SCP-3025-A; The surface is spotted with chemical fires, no vegetation is visible, and the sky appears polluted with dark soot. Upon reappearance, the devices sustain minor damage but are otherwise intact. An instance of SCP-3025-B is discovered following this test. ||\n|| 7 || 1 liter of distilled water, 1 wireless video camera, 1 D-personnel (D-45180) equipped with standard rations for one day || SCP-3025 enters the active state instantly. All objects in the test chamber combust. D-45180 does not appear to have been injured by spontaneous combustion, but begins to show signs of mild discomfort soon after appearing in SCP-3025-A. At 10 minutes after activation, D-45180 continues to express mounting discomfort. It becomes apparent that severe burns are being inflicted on D-45180. At 33 minutes after activation D-41580 moves out of frame. Upon reappearance, the video camera sustained minor damage. Autopsy reveals that D-41580 expired from inhalation of super-heated air at approximately 6 hours after activation. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Addendum 3025-2**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Show logs for Expedition Alpha\" hide=\"- Hide log\"]]\n\n2 D-personnel (D-45189, D-45195) were equipped with heat retardant suits, video and audio recording equipment, and standard rations for one day.

Expedition Beta, Command requests that you begin soil and air analysis as soon as possible.\n> \n> **Masozi:** Yes sir.\n> \n> //Analysis is completed. Tests show that the soil is composed of a mixture of silicates and unidentified organics. The air is a nitrogen/oxygen mix, with abnormally elevated levels of sulfur dioxide. Agent Masozi reports these findings.//\n> \n> **D-379012:** How long we been standing out here, man?\n> \n> **Masozi:** About half an hour, sir.\n> \n> **D-409914:** Any chance we can go back now?

Permission to move?\n> \n> **Command:** Permission granted, Beta.\n> \n> //Expedition Beta traverses approximately 14 kilometers on foot. The landscape is entirely unfamiliar, and much rougher than that experienced by Expedition Alpha. It is theorized that each activation of SCP-3025 may reveal different locations within SCP-3025-A, or perhaps an entirely new iteration of it.//\n> \n> **Masozi:** There!

It actually looks like gold.\n> \n> //D-379012 finishes extracting the nugget and attempts to lift it out of the ground, but fails.// \n> \n> **D-379012:** Wow, it's heavy.  ██████, help me lift. I’ll give you a share of the cash.\n> \n> //D-409914 is visibly distressed.//\n> \n> **D-409914:** I’m not taking any of the devil’s treasure. You’re on your own.\n> \n> **D-379012:** Man, knock it off. This is important.\n> \n> **Masozi**: That nugget could weigh more than three hundred pounds. I’m not sure we could move it even if we all lifted. \n> \n> **Command:** Our analysts agree that the item is composed of near-pure gold. It also appears to be too massive to move. We request that you attempt to remove a small sample for further analysis.\n> \n> **Masozi:** I have a scraper, but I don’t think you could get any more than a few flakes.\n> \n> **D-379012:** Watch me.\n> \n> //D-379012 works on sampling the nugget for the next 4 hours while Agent Masozi and D-409914 rest.

SCP-3025-B1 was an incorporeal being capable of telepathic speech and observation. It was constrained by the enclosed spaces, and could not alter the physical world on its own. SCP-3025-B1 was discovered after the test chamber was opened, when Junior Researcher ██████ heard a disembodied voice. The voice instructed her to “Stop, before they see you”. Junior Researcher ██████ quickly informed her superiors. Test complex was immediately quarantined, and sealed for three days. Junior Researcher ██████ did not receive any further communications from SCP-3025-B1, nor did any other exposed personnel. SCP-3025-B1 was declared neutralized on ██-██-20██. ||\n|| 2 || Discovered after Expedition Gamma. SCP-3025-B2 is a hostile sentient entity. SCP-3025-B2 is entirely invisible in all electromagnetic wavelengths. Through unknown means, SCP-3025-B2 casts a shadow as any non-anomalous object would. Analysis of the shadows cast by SCP-3025-B2 indicates that the entity is a static human figure, possibly a statue, holding an unidentified object in the right hand. SCP-3025-B2 [DATA EXPUNGED] any human beings in its reach. SCP-3025-B2 has a top speed of ███ kilometers per hour, but cannot pass through solid material. SCP-3025-B2 is repelled by bright lights and concussive blasts. It is thought that this response may reflect a desire to remain concealed or prevent damage to the entity itself. After Expedition Gamma, the test chamber remained sealed, and the remaining mission personnel were lost. After 2 days of observation, it was deemed safe to cut a small hole in the test chamber and insert 300 pounds of high incendiaries. After the blast, SCP-3025-B2 ceased motion, though its anomalous interaction with light persisted. SCP-3025-B2 was sealed in a standard containment locker and has not shown any signs of activity. ||\n|| 3 || Discovered after Incident 3025-1, an accidental activation of SCP-3025. As of ██-██-20██, SCP-3025-B3 is uncontained. SCP-3025-B3 is a large mechanical construct that is hostile toward human beings. Its main purpose is to activate SCP-3025. In the case that SCP-3025 is activated by SCP-3025-B3, the appearance of an SCP-3025-B instance is guaranteed. SCP-3025-B3 is slow-moving and can be deterred by gunfire or explosives. All containment vessels occupied by SCP-3025-B3 so far have been destroyed. The whereabouts of SCP-3025-B3 are unknown, and attempts to locate it are ongoing.  ||\n|| 4 || Discovered after Incident 3025-2, a hostile activation of SCP-3025. SCP-3025-B4 was a human infant with an adult human brain. The cranial plates were distended to make room for the added neural tissue. SCP-3025-B4 was unable to move or feed itself, but cognitive tests show that it may have been a developmentally mature adult. SCP-3025-B4 expired 4 days after its creation and was declared neutralized on ██-██-20██. ||\n|| 5 || Discovered after Incident 3025-3, a hostile activation of SCP-3025. SCP-3025-B5 is a large mass of living tissue, weighing about 3 tons. DNA found in the tissue matches that of the black-billed magpie. When approached by a human, SCP-3025-B5 attracts jewelry, clothing, or implants containing any precious metals. Items not associated with a living human are not affected. The force it exerts increases according to the inverse square law. When SCP-3025-B5 comes into contact with these items, they immediately disappear, and the mass of SCP-3025-B5 increases by three times the mass of the ingested metals. If a human being comes into direct contact with SCP-3025-B5, [DATA EXPUNGED]. ||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3024]]] | SCP-3025 | [[[SCP-3026]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
