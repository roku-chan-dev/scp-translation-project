Many telepaths have tried to comprehend the Emperor of Many Voices, but little has been learned, since direct psychic contact almost invariably results in becoming one of the Emperor's subjects. The few that have returned with their will intact spoke of a regal being, far greater than any mortal mind and speaking with countless harmonised voices.\n\nSubjects of the Emperor are not physically altered, although their allegiance is apparent to anyone with the ability to detect thoughts or perceive auras. There does not appear to be any way to resist or overcome the Emperor's influence, besides avoiding contact with him, although a few individuals appear to be immune to the influence of the Emperor of Many Voices. Since the criteria for this are unknown, testing one's own resistance is ill-advised.\n\n**Nature:** While he claims to be beneficent, seeking only to unify mankind behind a shared vision of a better future, the Emperor is intent on the eradication of free will. Vassals of the Emperor of Many Voices retain their old knowledge, habits and personalities, but their priorities become re-aligned. This includes a concern for the suffering of mankind, a desire to create a better future, and a longing for his dominion to encompass most, if not all of humanity, and perhaps in time the entire multiverse.\n\nThe Emperor possesses the combined knowledge of all its subjects, sharing it between them to enable the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-008-int| creation of Wonders]]], invariably incorporating knowledge, expertise and techniques from multiple sources. These items are presumably created in service to the Emperor and his goals, and while a few have been seized or destroyed so far, the vast majority are still at large.\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** The Emperor of Many Voices is believed to be the product of men.[[footnote]]I for one doubt any mortal could create an entity like this. - S.C.[[/footnote]] It is whispered that his empire was founded in the city of Bagdad, during a series of gruesome experiments that gave him his first voice.[[footnote]]I heard it was the CIA experimentation in the 1960s - you know, MK-Ultra stuff? - J.D.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Can't find any evidence for that, it's probably disinformation. Still can't confirm the Bagdad story though. - Sh.An.[[/footnote]]\n\nSince then, the Emperor of Many Voices has sought ways to expand his domain, and is believed to now count at least ten thousand voices among his subjects. He grows in power, knowledge and influence with each new vassal that bends the knee.\n\nThere are very few groups not connected in some way to the Emperor[[footnote]]Behind the Veil, at least. - Sh.An.[[/footnote]] - there are only those that are aware and on guard, and those that are as yet ignorant of his intrusion. The Emperor is not truly allied or opposed to any of these groups. To the Emperor of Many Voices, there are only two categories - those that have become its subjects, and those that have not yet submitted.\n\n**Approach:** The Emperor of Many Voices should not be approached, either physically or mentally. Prolonged proximity to one or more of the Emperor's subjects is the main way his network expands, and so the easiest way to evade him is to avoid suspected members, and minimise contact with unscreened individuals. However, as incautious telepaths have found, sustained psychic contact is an even more effective way of exposing oneself to his influence, and so it is strongly recommended that any mental connection is cut off as soon as his presence is sensed.\n\nTo prevent him from spreading beyond the confines of his reality of origin, subjects of the Emperor of Many Voices must be prevented from entering the Wanderer's Library,[[footnote]] Is this official Library policy? - J.D.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] Ask a Librarian? - Sh.An.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] Rather not, they creep me out. - J.D.[[/footnote]] and the Serpent's Hand has instituted mandatory psychic screening of library patrons.[[footnote]]Isn't that a little intrusive? - J.D.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Better than the alternative - O.R.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:right\"]]\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-emperor-of-many-voices/SPMax.png width=\"150px\" style=\"padding: 1.5em\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//\"I don't want to sound judgemental, but the Maxwellist Church is too big a commitment to join just because you're going through a cyberpunk phase, so we always carefully screen new converts before we give them any physical augmentation.

This may be an exaggeration, or simply one of the Emperor's own lies, designed to demoralise us. However, this rumour must be taken seriously - there is no such thing as a safe amount of contact with the Hive, and anyone that tells you otherwise is either one of them already, or likely to become one soon. - O.R.//\n\n//I'm rather shocked at the hostility and suspicion here. I'd expect that reaction from Essie P. or the Geo Sea, but we're the Serpent's Hand - are we really just going to try to avoid them? Can't we find a way to get along? - L.L.//[[footnote]]Try talking to them. I'm sure you'll \"see where they're coming from\" very soon. - J.D.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] Don't encourage our members to expose themselves to mind parasites, even in jest. Some might actually be foolish enough to do it. - O.R.[[/footnote]]\n\n//If it truly is a Gestalt Mind,[[footnote]]Only one theory. - Sh.An.[[/footnote]] it's inaccurate to conceive of \"the Emperor\" as an entity separate from its \"subjects\". Rather than having its own agenda, this being would merely be the psychic manifestation of a collective will. This may explain why their network expands so slowly, rather than trying to assimilate the entire world as rapidly as possible. If that's the case, we need to discuss whether the best course of action is for us to join the Hive now, and guide its future development. - R.Wn.//[[footnote]]Possible Hive Plant? - M.K.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]Not last time I checked, but I'll check again. - O.R.[[/footnote]]\n\n//Personally, I understand the need for caution, but you're ignoring the many ways that this \"Emperor\" can be of use to us, if kept at a safe distance.[[footnote]]Likely another Hive plant. - M.K.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]I've checked recently, he isn't one of the Emperor's subjects. I still advise against any contact, regardless of how \"careful\" you think you're being. - O.R.[[/footnote]] The Hive is as much an enemy of the Jailors and the Bookburners as we are, but they happen to be an enemy within. I have contacts in the Hive - they have intel on all of our foes, and they're willing to share it.[[footnote]]And you trust them? - S.C.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]I trust no one, I can still work with them. - Wt.Cr.[[/footnote]] So far all they've asked for in return is for the occasional copy of a book. - Wt.Cr.//[[footnote]]Stealing library books!? - J.D.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]You misunderstand - transcriptions, photographs or photocopies only. I promise, the Librarians don't mind. - Wt.Cr.[[/footnote]]\n\n//Banning them from the Library seems a little extreme. We share the space with many others just as dangerous as this \"Emperor\", but the Library truce has held so far. We simply need to lay down ground rules to prevent them from spreading their influence to patrons of the Library - A.Ny.//[[footnote]]Definitely one of them! - M.K.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]On it already. - O.R.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]I'm getting very tired of hearing unwarranted accusations. You only just checked my mind! - A.Ny.[[/footnote]]\n\n//That's a reasonable point. There must be some way for us to send people we trust to meet with representatives of the Emperor - at a safe distance, of course. The last thing we need is another enemy, this delicate situation clearly requires a diplomatic solution. - S.C.//[[footnote]]We're looking into it, but it's very difficult to arrange a meeting without compromising ourselves. - M.[[/footnote]]\n\n//I came to the Library in pursuit of knowledge. I have learned much, but there is a limit to what one mind can contain. You talk as if the Emperor is a tyrant to be feared, but the Emperor is merely the collective will of thousands of minds, his strength merely their united purpose made manifest. A mind that joins the Hive is not lost, no more than a droplet is diminished by becoming part of the ocean. You cling to your division and dissent, but only because you've forgotten our creed.
