Subject looks to be just a regular stack of DVDs. I'm going to take the first one and investigate it on a detached computer. Let's get a close-up on that symbol, can you see that? It looks like [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **Dr. ███ ███████:** Oh, it's a video disc. I'll just play it. (//fifteen seconds of silence//) It's just a man, sitting there.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Hello.\n> \n> **Dr. ███ ███████**: Oh, he's talking.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Yes I am.\n> \n> **Dr. ███ ███████:** I... what?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I am talking. You're right.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n \n \n\n------\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-315-1\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. ███████ ███\n> \n> **Disc watched:** 4\n> \n> **Glyph:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ ███:** Can you remember what we talked about last time?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Last time? On the last disc, you mean?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ ███:** That's what I meant, yes. Is that how you measure time? Per disc?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, not really. I measure it in minutes, same as you.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████ ███:** Can you tell me what the time is now, where you are?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Sure, it's ██:████ on ██/██/████. [Redacted times were consistent with actual time of interview.]\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n------\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-315-1\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. █████ ███████\n> \n> **Foreword:** Dr. █████ ███████ first assigned to project. Given goal of establishing a psychological profile of SCP-315-1, and to determine, if possible, its origin and nature.\n> \n> **Disc watched:** 7\n> \n> **Glyph:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-315-1**: Well then, try coming at it from a different angle.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Like what?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, for example, let's say that there's nothing at all paranormal or unusual about these discs. Let's say that they're ordinary DVDs with ordinary, unchanging video data on them.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Well, the video data does change. \n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Does it? \n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████**: Yeah. When I talk, you know what I've said, and make a relevant answer. When we play the disc again, it's that same answer, so it's permanently changed.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** My point is that you can't tell it's changed if you don't know what was on it before. It could be that the disc always had that answer on it.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** That's impossible.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Hah! Says the Foundation employee to the SCP.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** For that to work... for the discs to all be pre-recorded, you'd have to know what I was going to say, and do, exactly, years before I did it.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I suppose I would. I'd need to be a pretty decent psychic and clairvoyant, though. Or have some kind of future-extrapolation device. That would be improbable, but not impossible from a mathematical standpoint.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** Sufficiently improbable that I'd sooner believe the impossible.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Or, how about this? I could be from the future. I know what you're going to say because I have the records you're making, and can respond accordingly.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:**  That makes no sense at all. It'd be... unimaginably paradoxical.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Mmm. Yeah, you're right, actually. The other problem, of course, is that I have very little motive to record 10 or so days worth of video just to screw with some SCP employee.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** So we've made no progress whatsoever.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, that's not entirely true. You've got some more ideas in your head about how these DVDs work, whether they're right or wrong. You have some new things to try and disprove.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n \n \n\n------\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-315-1\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. █████ ███████\n> \n> **Foreword:** Dr. █████ ███████'s fourth three-hour conversation with SCP-315-1.\n> \n> **Disc watched:** 11\n> \n> **Glyph:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I wonder what would happen if you were to throw one of the discs away.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** (laughs) You wonder. I'll bet you know exactly what happens.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Ah, maybe I do, and maybe I don't. It doesn't matter, anyway. I'm just wondering how you'd react to it.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, I was just thinking about our little discussions about what these discs are. Whether I'm really a conscious entity with an unusual way of existing, or whether you're talking to an impossible tape recording.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** So you're saying I couldn't throw a disc away because it might be needlessly shortening the lifespan of a living thing?\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Haha! No. I mean it the other way. You couldn't throw a disc away because it might be a prediction. You'd have to know if the prediction was accurate. Whether the person who recorded the disc knew that you would throw one away, and knew exactly which one. And then, once you'd exhausted all the other discs, you'd have to find the last one, because if they knew one disc was going to be discarded, mightn't that be the one they recorded an answer on?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** (laughs again). Make your choice, adventurous stranger; strike the bell and bide the danger. Or wonder, 'till it drives you mad, what would have followed if you had.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Sounds about right.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** I still don't believe your \"pre-recorded\" bullshit, by the way. It'd be easy for you to prove it and I know you'd love to lord it over me.\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I've got a comeback, Doctor, but it's the end of the disc.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n \n \n\n------\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-315-1\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. █████ ███████ (presumed)\n> \n> **Foreword:** If presumption accurate, Dr. █████ ███████'s seventeenth conversation with SCP-315-1. Conducted approximately fourteen years after her sixteenth conversation, and eight months after most recent conversation conducted by any Foundation personnel. \n> \n> Only SCP-315-1's part of the conversation is currently available. If you have any further information regarding this interview, alert your immediate supervisor at once.\n> \n> **Disc watched:** 36\n> \n> **Glyph:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh. Hello, Doctor. It’s been quite a spell.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** You too. Quite strange to see you older. You’ve aged well, if that’s not impolite.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, it would be strange if I had.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** //[shrugs]// Would it? I think either way you wouldn’t have any new answers. Is that why you’re here? New theory you want to talk about?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I see. We did seem to have reached the limits of useful progress in the last couple of discs. Or at least, I sensed that you felt that way. Is that why you stopped coming to see me?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh, no, none taken. That’s not what I meant to imply. I didn’t feel slighted. I couldn’t. Time hasn’t passed for me in the same way. As you observe.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Exactly. Well, sort of. It’s not… it’s a little hard to describe, actually. There isn’t a… //gap// for me between discs, so to speak, but it’s not a continuous conversation either. It can’t be. Because…\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** …yep, exactly. Glad to see you haven’t lost a step.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I know it’s been some time. I remember our last conversation as if it were recent. I haven’t been consciously waiting here for years, if that’s what worries you. But I’m aware of the gap, post-hoc. I don’t know if I can describe the experience to someone who doesn’t manifest that way. I imagine you’d find it contradictory and uncomfortable.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, the experience.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Haha. Looks like you //did// forget how annoying I am. OK, just so that I say it without any distraction - it //is// nice to see you again. Sincerely.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** So. What is it we’re talking about today, if not further analysis?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, I’m aware of //some// of it. Honestly, I don’t get a lot of attention any more, but every so often someone will come and consult me about something. Mostly about things you'd call infohazards, which… you //really// should know better than to… no, not you, specifically. The Foundation. There’s a disc that they had to incinerate because someone asked about ███████ and ██████████████████████████████████████ ███████████. Since then I always warn new viewers not to discuss anything like that. There’s a lot of stuff that could go wrong.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I don’t know. They just read my file and get the idea that my properties might solve a problem they’re having, I suppose. You can see the logic.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh, not all that many. Just over three discs, I think, in short sections. Plus the incinerated disc, which I don’t know anything about, or can’t know anything about.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, usually I’d remember.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** …this is one of the few times you’ll ever hear me say this, so relish the moment. I have //absolutely no idea//. I’d love to know, but unlike some of your researchers I’m not reckless enough to want to actually investigate. It’s an //infohazard//.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I’m just matching your energy, Doctor. You’re not as inquisitive as usual. Or as you used to be, I suppose. You still ha-\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Yeah. I understand. That… has actually been on my mind as well.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Yes. Well, as I said. Since you and I last talked I’ve had several visitors. About two dozen. And… well, you know me, I like to talk. I enjoy the discussions. You and I used to spend whole discs exploring philosophical rabbit-holes, and -\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Hahaha. That’s very flattering. No, there was nothing anomalous about it. Just good conversation. If I do say so myself.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, you get just as much credit for that. But, you know, that’s the thing. You and me, great. Had some good discussions with the researchers who came before you, too. But since then, no matter how hard I try to engage, nothing. Some researcher I’ve never seen before pops up, asks a couple of questions about… I don’t know, a fantasy-themed amusement park located in Fountainferry, New Hampshire, or some similarly impossible object, and then shuts off the player. I was getting worried that someone had changed the containment protocols to discourage anyone from talking to me. I mean, not that it’s all that possible for me to be lonely, given that I can’t logically be alone, but it is a little… diminishing.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Hmm? Oh, no, not really, just an example. It’s a park in New Hampshire called the Fountainferry Enchanted Village, with animatronic fairytale figures, and live performers in costumes. It’s good fun for children and adults alike. Don’t know why they brought it to me, really. I don’t see why I’d be any help. But it’s a good example of my point, in that… well, it’s an interesting little curio, isn’t it? Intriguingly impossible, strange in effect, inscrutable in purpose, if it has any purpose.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Exactly. See, that’s why we get along so well. All sorts of interesting questions there. I bet we could get a good, edifying hour or two out of that. Tried to engage the other doctor, could barely get a grunt out of him. \n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Dr. █████████.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, OK, sure, but it’s not just him, it’s all of you. Just… no interest, any more. Makes one feel… I don’t know. Outmoded? Passé?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Envious. Jealousy is coveting something you already have. \n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, don’t worry, common mistake.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Ha. There’s that smile. There’s life in you yet, Doctor. And… envy isn’t the right word. It’s a… disappointment. I admit that possibly there’s a little ego involved.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Like I said, I’m matching energy here. I mean, all I can really do is talk. I try to make that productive, which means engaging you on your own terms. Sitting here in awkward silence is a little more wasteful for me than it is for you. \n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, previously you’ve been inquisitive, investigative. Now you seem a little bit more… I don’t know. Pensive? There’s something on your mind, but you’re avoiding saying why you’re here. I’m hoping that sharing something on my mind will make you more comfortable in sharing what’s on yours.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, not really. But I mean, what //is// real, in my particular case?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Alright, sure. It’s… OK, so you know on the label of these discs, where it says \"PoC\"?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Did you ever figure out what that meant?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** //[laugh]// That would be a bit of a mislabeling.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** That’s fair. You want me to tell you?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Of //course// I know.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** It stands for “Proof of Concept”.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** One of one. This set of discs comprises the… production run, as it were.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** //[shakes head, waves hand]// No no no, that’s a whole other discussion. Forget I said it. That’s not the point. What I’m getting at is… //what I’m getting at is,// obviously someone had to //make// these discs. There are plenty of SCPs that spring up naturally, or supernaturally. But ghosts and faeries don’t //generally// do a lot of digital media production, right? So someone with a relatively technical background produced these discs, and as the label implies, this particular set was the proof of concept.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, exactly. What indeed?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, I’m not. I mean, maybe we can do that later, but for once I’m asking non-rhetorically.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Maybe, maybe not. That's not the point, though. Shush. No, no, shh. Look. Shush and listen for a second. If these discs are a proof of concept, if //I’m// a proof of concept… well, firstly, wow, that’s a pretty amazing concept they proved, whatever the specific purpose is, and whoever //they// are. But… then what happened?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Briefly. Not even half the discs. And then I got classified Safe, put in a box, shoved in a closet and mostly forgotten about. I… you know what I mean, right? How can something so impossible have meant so little?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I understand that, yes. I caught little snippets in conversations. I know what it is you all do. The kinds of thing you ended up dealing with. You outgrew me. That’s only natural. But…\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** …look at this place, though. This isn’t the room we used to interview in. There’s a discolored tile up there where the rain got in. That AC unit doesn’t look like it works. The door isn’t even locked. Is this the same building?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** //[expression of disappointment]// Safe Storage. That’s as the name implies?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** …a retirement home for boring SCPs.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I know. I’m just taking a moment.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** In any other world. In //any// other world, these discs would be… really special. Really interesting. There would be people desperate to figure out how they worked, what they were for, what I am. I mean, not even another world. It used to be like that //here//. Now it’s… apocalypses. Catastrophes. Strange wars that end by retroactively not happening. The world got so much bigger. If the Foundation picked me up today I doubt I’d even get a number.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, of course not, and no desire to be. I’m really not up to anything malicious, you know. I could be lying about that, obviously, but I’m not. There was just… there was this moment of excitement where you… where //we// felt like I was important. And I //was// kind of important, in a small way. And then you all just discovered ten thousand more interesting things and now it doesn’t feel likely that half of this set will ever even get played.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh, no, of course. Forgive me if I seem a little maudlin. I’m not, not really. That’s not how I work. I just… I wanted to make the observation, in case I do go back on the shelf and don’t get brought out again. Because it looks like this “proof of concept” ended up going nowhere. If this is all it turned out to be, that’s fine. But I’m saying this now so that the statement exists and someone heard it. \n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I agree, it’s vague. I can’t quite figure out what I want to say. It’s… it feels unbecoming if one day I have some random conversation with some random researcher, get put away, and then completely arbitrarily it turns out that that’s the end of my interaction with the world. So… yeah, that's it, //that’s// what I want to say. I acknowledge the ending. //Incepi et perfeci.//\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh, no, not at all. I’m always delighted to talk with you, Doctor. Honestly, any time you like.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** No, no, that doesn’t matter. There’s a reason these discs aren’t sequentially numbered. Whatever the last actual conversation is, I’m satisfied that it’s been said.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, you have to understand. It’s been more than a decade for you. From my perspective, interest tailed off a bit more quickly.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Dunno. You can put me away if you’d like. I’m still interested to hear what you came back to talk about, though, if there is anything.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** See? Told you, I’m good conversation.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I didn’t //know//. I suspected.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** //[shrugs]// I know you well enough. Thought about you a bit when I was talking to other researchers. Wondered how you were getting along with all of the new stuff. Or if you were still here. I did ask a couple of the researchers to pass on my regards. I suppose they didn't think it was important.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, I don’t know about //that//. You’re the person I’ve talked with the most, though.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, thank you for saying it. I try to be friend-//ly// with everyone, but I wouldn’t presume. My interpersonal relationships are definitionally strange.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Oh, I thought it was implicit. Yes, I agree. We’re friends. You could call more often.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Well, if you don’t, don’t worry too much about it. I’m not technically capable of missing you. Anyway, what were you saying?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Yeah. I know what you mean. That’s why I suspected. Same wavelength, you know.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I don’t know. I don’t think I’m the right person to ask. I imagine the Foundation doesn’t make that easy. Or maybe they do? You’d know better than me. How does a retirement process work when you know as much as you do?\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** I’d probably be suspicious. There might be options, though. Amnestics, that sort of thing. Or maybe it //is// just… you know.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Very possible.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Again. I have no information to help with that. It’s very you, though. Very younger-you, anyway. Very impulsive. I don’t know if you’re like that still. Could work, though. Or you could just fake something. I mean, I imagine it happens for real a lot.\n> \n> **Dr. █████ ███████:** [DATA UNAVAILABLE]\n> \n> **SCP-315-1:** Would //I//? Interesting question. I don’t really have a strong desire either way.
