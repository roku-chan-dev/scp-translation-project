It might be…**[[footnote]]A conclusive answer to this question constitutes a Class-IV infohazard.[[/footnote]]\n------\n[[div]]\nWelcome to the Auto-zone. I'll play around with all the fancy formatting stuff later. For now - here's my page!\n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-5973:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5973 /Ohio has been eliminated.]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5973\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nMy first scip! This was a lot of fun (well, as fun as writing about 14,000 people dying tends to get), and starting out with such a large-scale anomaly was daunting but I think I pulled it off well enough. The idea of the Foundation causing such a large scale disaster, and subsequently trying to save face, is something that I still find fascinating and will definitely be revisiting in a future scip.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n^^This also received a [http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-5973 translation on the Chinese branch], which is super cool!^^\n------\n\n**SCP-5491:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5491 Disco never dies]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5491\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nThis is a short, sweet, and relatively simple one, but I’ve had a lot of people tell me they enjoyed it. At its core, it’s a ghost story involving apparitions in a nightclub, but with a dash of nostalgia and social commentary. Warning: this scip contains British.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**SCP-5441:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5441 S03 E02 - \"The Intern\"]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5441\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nAn average workday at Site-67 is disrupted when Director (//of Records//) Scott Sully introduces a freshly-picked recruit from the UIU.\n\nMeanwhile, strange messages appear on the computer of hapless Researcher Dave Poots. Is this merely another juvenile prank being played by his colleagues, or is something afoot that's more sinister entirely?\n\nMy first 'pataphysical format screw.\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n\n**SCP-5910:** [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5910 This is a true story.]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5910\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nI really love the movie //Fargo//... so I wrote a scip about it! Possibly the only article on the site in which a Mobile Task Force gets harassed by incorporeal Steve Buscemi. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**SCP-5797:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5797 OVERDRIVE]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5797\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nNot sure what to say about this one other than I had a blast writing it! Trucks with a mind of their own, human goo, and a mechanical worm that hates capitalism all feature in this tale of vehicular vengeance in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOh, and there’s a Lemon Demon reference snuck in for good measure.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**SCP-5820:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5820 exTERMInaTE]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5820\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nI see this one as the spiritual successor to 5797. It's a similarly wacky concept, with a hefty helping of skin-peeling body horror and piss-taking of American conservatives. Fun to write, and - according to several - fun to read!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**SCP-5949:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5949 SEVENSEAS]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5949\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Commentary\"]]\nShort, simple, and with predominantly humorous intentions, this was one of those ideas which just came to me spontaneously, and I'm quite pleased with the way it turned out. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n> **My sandbox:** [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/thismightbeauto2 The 'Shop]\n> \n> //Bonus old sandbox:// [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/thismightbeauto Loads of scrapped ideas in the history.
