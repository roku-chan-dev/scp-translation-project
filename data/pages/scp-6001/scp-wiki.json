This singularity connects to a parallel universe hereafter known as **A6K**. Compared to baseline reality, A6K possesses nearly identical base components, including locations, individuals, and phenom. However, these counterparts will often differ wildly in terms of complex characteristics and behavior. \n\nThe most commonly observed divergences within A6K include lack of cooperation, increased scientific and technological repression, and heightened paranoia, aggression and violence in near-to-all sentient elements. It is unclear if these differences are purely causal, or derived from the nature of A6K itself.\n \nWhile the dominant scientific institution of A6K, known as the \"SCP Foundation\", is aware of Phenom 6001, they are incapable of transgressing into our reality due to their limited understanding, and the aperture's infinitesimal size.\n\n**Addenda:** Global scan complete.

From a distance, it appeared as five columns of mossy stones - smooth river rocks that had been balanced by some great giant. Yet each \"stone\" was a large, isolated structure of thin metal and white ceramics, built one on top of the other without any practical means of moving between. So it goes in a post-teleportation world. Within each rounded complex was a single exhibit, and with Primrose in tow, I raced and vanished between them like an unsupervised child. I could have spent the whole day in that museum. I could have spent my whole life there.//\n> \n> //I paced around a large aquarium full of lifeless, murky water. At its center there was a statue of a man, his hands held aloft. After a while, I thought I saw children in the tank, empty eyed and floating. I rushed towards them filled with dread. Then, a trio of those same children popped their heads over the tanks edge, and spat water at me. They giggled and vanished away once again. Primrose sagely pointed down at the floor, and sure enough, I was standing in the clearly marked \"splash zone\".//\n> \n> //Thus far, I'd found this universe a bit sterile and chaste. A visit to the Robert \"Bobo\" Blythe gallery cleared that right up for me.

It was no more \"human\", but far less unsettling. The browns and reds on its \"face\" were now vibrant, almost luminescent, spread out in a flowing Rorschach pattern. Its shape was the most striking difference. Its body was bent back, well back, until its chest formed a smooth curve and its head nearly touched the floor again. Its arms were held slouched, yet a thousand hair-thin bands of metal curled and blossomed upwards.
