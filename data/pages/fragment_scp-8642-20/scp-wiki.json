  "content": "Thinking quickly, you pull one of the mysterious double doors open and scramble in, shutting it swiftly behind you. You thank every deity you know of when you realize that the doors lock from the inside. Locking the doors will only buy you so much time, though, so you turn and race down the dimly-lit hall. It’s surprisingly quiet in here; you can’t even hear your own footsteps. You see a faint glow at the end of the hallway. Drawing closer, you realize that the glow is that of a computer screen. You also realize, a bit unnervingly, that the computer is at the deadend of this hallway, with no other way out except the way you came in. At this point you feel you can’t turn around and go back, so your only choice is to sit down and see what’s on the computer.\n\nAnd that… kind of scares you, not having a choice.\n\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/21 But you decide to look at the computer anyway.]||\n||= 20||\n\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _",
