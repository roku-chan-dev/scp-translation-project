SOME INCONSISTENCIES MAY PERSIST.\n[[/div]]\n----\n**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** Dr. Orville has been granted permission to continue his long-term employment with the Foundation. However, he is to be under constant surveillance in order to document any SCP-6641-1 manifestation.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-6641 is the designation given to an anomaly currently affecting Foundation Senior Researcher Ogden Orville, the Head of Site-400's Department of Astronomical Research.\n\nWhenever Dr. Orville attempts to sleep during the time period between 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM in any location, a hairless grey-skinned semi-corporeal arm (designated as SCP-6641-1) will manifest on the back of Dr. Orville and will use any means necessary to wake him from his sleep.\n\nWhen SCP-6641-1 succeeds in waking Dr. Orville up, it will immediately demanifest.\n\n**ADDENDUM 6641.1:** SCP-6641-1 Manifestations\n\nThe following is a list of some notable SCP-6641-1 manifestations:\n\n||~ Date & Time ||~ Location ||~ Event Description ||\n||= 12/05/2018 (12:54 PM) ||= Site-400's personnel lounge room || Dr. Orville briefly slept on a couch after giving a presentation regarding an unrelated anomaly. SCP-6641-1 manifested and began slapping his face, which resulted in him immediately waking up. ||\n||= 14/05/2018 (9:04 AM) ||= Outside of Site-400's Memetic Research Lab || Dr. Orville dozed off on top of a bench within the waiting room outside of the Research Lab. SCP-6641-1 manifested and slapped Dr. Orville's face, but failed in waking him up. It grabbed Dr. Orville's hair and pulled hard. This action resulted in Dr. Orville waking up and shouting in pain. ||\n||= 24/08/2019 (6:53 PM) ||= Site-400's Multi-Purpose Auditorium || Dr. Orville attended a seminar conducted by Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate regarding outer-planetary Pataphysical narratives. Thirty minutes into the seminar, Dr. Orville began to fall asleep, which resulted in the manifestation of SCP-6641-1. Dr. Placeholder, noticing this, approached Dr. Orville and attempted to wake him up. This succeeded, and SCP-6641-1 held up a middle finger before demanifesting. ||\n||= 07/09/2020 (3:53 PM) ||= Site-400's personnel lounge room || See **Addendum 6641.2** ||\n\n**ADDENDUM 6641.2:** Incident Log\n\nOn September 7th, 2020, Dr. Orville accidentally slept on the couch that was situated within Site-400's personnel lounge room. It is also important to note that other Foundation personnel were present within the lounge room. The following is the recovered video recording of the event that transpired:\n\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n\n+++* Video Log 6641.27\n\n**Personnel present:**\n\n* Dr. Ogden Orville\n* Dr. Bellatrix Fuller\n* Jr. Researcher Kain Stalos\n* Dr. Edan Lohlainn\n* Agent Carlos Sierra\n* Dr. Kyran Kelly\n----\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n//Footage shows that Dr. Orville is sleeping with his head rested atop the couch's armrest. He is wearing a motorcycle helmet, possibly to prevent SCP-6641-1 from waking him up. The other Foundation personnel are seen either eating or conversing with each other.//\n\n//SCP-6641-1 manifests behind Dr. Orville. It first begins to lightly tap the helmet Dr. Orville is wearing, before knocking hard on the helmet's visor. Despite this, Dr. Orville remains asleep. Dr. Kelly notices this.//\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Hey, guys? Look. (//points toward SCP-6641-1//) It's that thing with Orville again.\n\n**Dr. Lohlainn:** Oh, no. Poor Orville. Should we... do something?\n\n//Agent Sierra gets up from his seat and slowly approaches SCP-6641-1 and Dr. Orville.//\n\n**Agt. Sierra:** Alright, I'm honestly //sick// of you bothering my friend. How about you just go away and let Orville rest for a while, huh? He had a long day today and he can't fucking take a nap with you around.\n\n//SCP-6641-1 approaches Agent Sierra's face and flicks it hard. Agent Sierra falls down on the ground in pain.//\n\n**Agt. Sierra:** Ow, fuck!\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Oh, shit! A-are you okay, Carl?\n\n**Agt. Sierra:** Yeah, just help me get this son of a bitch.\n\n**Dr. Fulller:** Guys, I think we should just call sit-\n\n//Dr. Kelly runs toward SCP-6641-1 and proceeds to grab its upper arm. Xe then attempts to wrestle it to the ground, but fails as two of SCP-6641-1's fingers poke both of Dr. Kelly's eyes. Xe shouts in pain as tears can be seen streaming down xeir cheek.//\n\n**Agt. Sierra:** Hey, shithead!\n\n//Agent Sierra unholsters his handgun but is immediately disarmed by SCP-6641-1. The handgun drops to the ground as SCP-6641-1 grabs the neck of Agent Sierra and lifts him upwards, choking him in the process.//\n\n**Dr. Fulller:** Oh, crap. Edan! Kain! Go get help and find something useful!\n\n//Dr. Lohlainn and Rs. Stalos both quickly exit the lounge room. Dr. Fuller picks up the handgun belonging to Agent Sierra and examines the bullet magazine before slowly taking a step back and aiming it towards SCP-6641-1.//\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Wait, Fuller! You don-\n\n//Dr. Fuller pulls the trigger and fires. The bullet impacts the wrist of SCP-6641-1 and a loud primal scream can be heard from an unknown source. SCP-6641-1 drops Agent Sierra and turns toward Dr. Fuller, oozing an unknown black substance from the bullet wound it has sustained.//\n\n//SCP-6641-1 grabs Dr. Fuller by the neck and lifts her upward, before smashing her onto the ground. Dr. Lohlainn and Rs. Stalos return to the lounge room, with the former holding onto a large fire ax. Rs. Stalos notices SCP-6641-1 and immediately snatches the ax from Dr. Lohlainn. He hacks off the limb of SCP-6641-1 that was connected to the back of Dr. Orville.//\n\n//The loud scream can be heard again as Rs. Stalos continues to hack SCP-6641's lower limb. After twenty seconds, SCP-6641-1 is completely severed from Dr. Orville. Its remains began to demanifest as Dr. Orville slowly wakes up.//\n\n**Dr. Orville:** (//yawns//) Ugh, I had the weirdest dream. Wait a minute. (//checks his watch//) Holy, shit! I slept! I slept without the goddamn fucking arm bothering me! Jesus, this is so great. Thank God. I guess it must have just gone on its own. Guys, you won't believe thi- woah. What the hell happened?\n\n**Agt. Sierra:** Hope you had a good nap, Orville.\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nOn-site security arrived on the scene and was able to give medical attention to Dr. Fuller, Dr. Kelly, and Agent Sierra. However, all of the associated Foundation personnel (except Dr. Orville) were immediately reprimanded afterward for engaging in an anomaly without consent nor direct approval from any known parties.\n\nAs of 07/09/2020, SCP-6641 has been reclassified as Decommissioned.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-6640]]] | SCP-6641 | [[[SCP-6642]]] >>\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
