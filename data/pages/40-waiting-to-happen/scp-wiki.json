If they hadn't done that, they'd have been left with only whatever information was contained in Harry's florid history of the alternate timeline, and the contents of his electronic sketchbook — without which the entire year would have passed out of all knowledge without a trace. Even their clothes had disappeared; Sokolsky's examination had revealed nothing peculiar until half past six on the tenth, and then nothing at all. The PDAs had vanished as well. Ngo's notes and the transferred files appeared to be permanent, but there was no knowing how long that would last. They'd already been passed along to the Site-17 Deepwell.\n\nThe idea that his amateurish drawings had been immortalized, preserved as though they were among the foundational records of humankind, made Harry feel very, very silly. He wasn't opposed to being a part of history rather than writing it, but not like this. Not like //this.//\n\nSomeone was knocking on his door.\n\n\"Come on in.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Lillian entered tentatively. Harry frowned. He couldn't remember the last time she'd knocked before entering, or the last time she'd done anything tentatively. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"I've got a problem.\" She approached the couch where he was sitting like she was sneaking up on a tiger. He had no idea why. Instinctively, he stood up. \"A new one?\"\n\n\"A very new one,\" she nodded. \"It's my memory.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"It's still there.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Okay... wait. It's still there?\"\n\n\"All of it.\"\n\n\"You remember the entire year?\"\n\n\"Pretty sure I do, guy.\" Was that a haunted look in her eye, or something else?\n\n\"What the fuck?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"What are you gonna do?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\nHe paced the seating area, thinking it through. \"Well, you have to tell McInnis. You'll probably have to debrief Ngo. Everything you remember could be important.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She massaged the back of her neck. \"Fuck.\"\n\n\"What did you think I was gonna tell you?\"\n\n\"I dunno.\" She shrugged. \"We've gotten in the habit of keeping secrets.\"\n\n\"Did you tell anyone else?\"\n\n\"Why would I have?\"\n\nThere was an odd vulnerability in the way she said that flattering thing, and he felt a warm wave of affection for his oldest, best friend. \"Can I tell you something?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\nHe walked up to her, smiled up at her. \"I'm glad we're suffering this horseshit together.\"\n\nShe bumped her forehead into his, and reached out to take his hands. \"Nobody I'd rather get dumped on with.\"\n\nThey stood like that for a while. Her hands were shaking, and he wondered why. Before he could ask, she pulled him into an embrace, squeezed the breath out of him, then let go and stepped back. She'd seemed badly out of sorts when she'd walked through the door, but suddenly it all seemed better.\n\n//Your mind is a strange and wondrous thing, Dr. Lillihammer,// he thought, and then he thought something else.\n\nIt must have made it out of his mind and onto his face, because Lillian frowned at him. \"What?\"\n\n\"I just had a thought.\"\n\n\"Thought I heard a rattling noise.\"\n\nHe grunted. The thought was too troubling for him to really enjoy the ribbing. \"Do you know why...\"\n\nShe waited a few seconds for him to continue -- something else she rarely ever did -- then finally ventured \"Maybe?\" when he didn't.\n\nHe remembered his last moments with Melissa, the one he'd lost less permanently, the one who was presently doing who knew what in Grand Bend, and hesitated. \"I dunno if I should ask.\"\n\n\"Can it wait? Because you're right, I should tell the others about this.\"\n\n\"I dunno if I //want// it to wait.\" He sighed. \"Okay. All right. Do you know why Udo and I broke up?\"\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \"Yes.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\nShe tilted her chin down. \"Do you want me to tell you?\"\n\n\"I... don't think so.\"\n\n\"Good, because I wasn't gonna.\"\n\nHaving already asked her something he shouldn't have, he decided to overshare as well. \"We might get together again. Stay together, I mean.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"So?\"\n\n\"So, is there a good reason why we shouldn't? Is there a mistake we need to avoid? You know how it plays out.\"\n\nShe smiled sadly. \"I have no idea how it'll play out.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because that was then, and this is now.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 11 September\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nRepresentatives had arrived from two different groups claiming to represent the Foundation's time cops, the Department of Temporal Anomalies (which some of them had heard of) and the Temporal Anomalies Department (which only Udo Okorie and Ilse Reynders had heard of). A third representative from a third group nobody had heard of, a woman named Azzopardi who claimed to work for something called the Chronometrics Division, didn't stay long. She had credentials which didn't scan, produced a loud \"eep\" sound when she saw the TAD's rep and backed away from him, and repeated \"2004? As in two //zero// zero four?\" twice before making her apologies and her exit in quick succession.\n\nThe two who remained did a rapid readover of the personnel roster, then settled on meeting with Reynders and Xinyi Du. Okorie wasn't offended, since she hadn't offered up the fact that she'd heard of the TAD. She had the feeling that was the kind of thing that got you amnesticized, and the discovery was long enough ago now that she'd be losing rather a lot of herself in that case.\n\nThen again, she thought, forgetting everything after 2002 was a fairly even mixture of good and bad.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"So.\" Alice Forth of the DTA was a round-faced brunette with bright green eyes and a tidy, bespoke business suit. She had a relatively easy manner, and a friendly smile. \"You don't have any temporal affairs personnel.\"\n\n\"Of either acronym order, no,\" Du agreed.\n\n\"This is our first temporal affair,\" Reynders said without a hint of humour.\n\n\"Yes,\" Du agreed. \"Please be gentle.\"\n\nForth smirked.\n\nThaddeus Xyank of the TAD was unamused. He looked like a shipping magnate from the 1920s, a huge handlebar moustache driving a badly out-of-date velvet suit. Personality wise, he was the perfect foil to Forth. \"We chose to debrief the two of you because frankly, nobody else around here stands the slightest chance of grasping the temporal mechanics. I suspect you might be able to glean a glimmer, with intensive study.\"\n\nForth gave him a sidelong glance. \"It's an honour to meet you, Dr. Reynders. Your work is foundational in the field.\"\n\nXyank checked the watch on his left hand, and sighed.\n\n\"The stuff I know I've done,\" Reynders asked, \"or the stuff I'll do later?\"\n\nBoth of them laughed. It seemed oddly forced from Xyank.\n\n\"We won't waste your time with the basics,\" said Forth. Xyank raised a bushy eyebrow at her, but did not protest. \"Temporal alteration, timeline tangent.\"\n\n\"Unusual example, though,\" her counterpart mused. \"Typically someone travels back in time, time doesn't travel forwards, then take what you did to it back //with// it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Forth agreed, \"that's a wrinkle to be sure. But the basic principles seem the same. In a sense this arrangement is better than what you'd normally get; normally you'd have to contrive a means of returning to the scene of the time crime to set it right, but in this case--\"\n\n\"The time-mountain comes to time-Mohammad,\" Du finished.\n\nXyank looked at him, then looked at Forth. \"What makes people here talk like that?\"\n\n\"Honestly?\" Du shrugged. \"It's mostly Lillihammer.\"\n\nForth nodded. \"We were hoping to speak to her as well, actually, but I understand she's on another consult.\"\n\nReynders decided to essay a restart. \"So, I don't know if you two have an agenda—\"\n\n\"Why would I have an agenda?\" Xyank snapped.\n\nForth gave him a strange look. \"She means a plan for this meeting.\"\n\n\"Right. Of course. Uh, no.\" He checked the watch on his right hand this time. \"When Dr. Forth and I end up in the same meeting, we usually end up arguing, and arguments are so much more productive unscripted.\"\n\n\"I disagree,\" Forth smiled.\n\n\"You two make a good light comedy act.\" Reynders tapped her pencil lightly on the window sill. \"If you don't have an outline, let me express my main concern: how do we know that we're actually in baseline now? If it's so dependent on precisely what these people do, couldn't subtle differences in their actions have resulted in subtly different versions of September 8? Wettle fell over a second too late, and there's repercussions we might not even notice? I know that's not how it works most of the time, but as you said, none of this is standard.\"\n\nThe two visiting experts exchanged a meaningful glance.\n\n\"That's rather the crux of the matter, isn't it?\" Xyank said. \"Even if restoration to baseline is as forgiving as it ought to be, these seven individuals and their actions now directly define the survival of this entire timeline.\"\n\nForth continued this line of thought, to Xyank's very obvious distaste. He kept correcting her word choice with his lips as he listened. \"If they do anything wrong, anything at all, it erases everything and rewrites the universe in the image of those... //individuals,// whoever they were. This facility is now the temporal anomalies equivalent of a superfund site.\"\n\n\"And how do you propose we clean it up?\" Du asked.\n\n\"Foul the waters further,\" Xyank suggested. \"Depart from the correct course minutely each year, and chart the effects until you understand the larger pattern.\"\n\nForth favoured him with a wide-eyed stare. \"I would have said definitely do //not// do that. Make absolutely certain they do their jobs precisely the same way, year after year, until we can figure out what's causing this and devise a means of stopping it.\"\n\n\"What an unshockingly provincial outlook you have, Dr. Forth,\" Xyank sighed. \"Do you know, every version of you I've met thinks much the same?\"\n\n\"Do you know, Dr. Xyank,\" she retorted, \"that Dr. McInnis told me you told him reality would rubberband back instantly on the 8th, or not at all?\"\n\nFrom his stricken expression, he had not in fact known that. \"Yes, well, this is all rather new ground for all of us.\" He didn't look happy to be making that admission. \"I'm also unaware of any temporal anomaly which restructures reality in stages, yet that's precisely what this one did.\"\n\nReynders rubbed her temples. \"Yes, do you know, that gave me quite the headache? For an instant I was seeing triple: baseline, baseline but the Victims never died, baseline but the Victims never died and they were destroying the world.\" She reached out to touch her window, examining a specific and wholly unremarkable corner of the glass with inexplicable interest before catching herself and resuming the dialogue. \"How do we even begin to figure out that sort of absurdity?\"\n\nXyank twirled his moustache, but Forth beat him to the punch. \"We're experts in absurdity. Just look at us.\" She simpered. \"Mostly him, of course.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nSite-43, it has often been remarked, violently breaks the mould when it comes to the physical appearance of its experts. They are typically younger, healthier, and while the final metric is wholly subjective, generally agreed to be more attractive than their colleagues elsewhere. This writer once suggested, to general expressions of disdain, that this might be due in large part to the large number of humanities PhDs on staff. He reasoned that the hard sciences attract fewer of the sensitive, artsy sorts who flock to fields like history, occultism or even memetics. \"Makes you wonder why they call them 'hard',\" he'd added to immediate and negative physical consequences.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith all that said, even by local standards Dr. Jessie Rivera did not seem like a world-renowned expert in anything, except perhaps for surfing or the growth and care of marijuana plants. She was a bouncy, freckled redhead in a floral tank top that looked like it belonged on a beach, in the 1990s. She was also apparently one of the Directors of Site-120, which apparently had more than one of those.  \n\n\"So yes,\" she was saying, \"obviously it's ontokinetic. It can't not be. Reality got bent.\"\n\n\"Lucky reality,\" Udo smiled. They were walking to the subway, which gave Udo an uneasy feeling that she couldn't put her finger on.\n\nRivera laughed. \"Right? Now, whatever happened to your unknown subject -- do you have a name for them? One that doesn't give you blackbox on the brain?\"\n\n\"We've managed to find a few scraps referring to 'The Uncontained', contextually likely to be the occupant of that cell.\"\n\n\"Okay, so, your uncle. Whatever happened to him... oof, that hurt, got too close apparently.\" She blinked away the antimemetic blues. \"Whatever happened to //them// isn't related to anything chronological. The erasure, I mean. If it was, the erasure would have been tidy. They wouldn't exist, instead of sort of kind of mostly not existing but also we've got lots of papers with nicknames for them on them.\"\n\nThe valley girl routine was making Udo's curiosity itch, and she finally relented. \"How old are you?\"\n\nRivera seemed momentarily surprised, then snorted. \"Older than this.\" She gestured at her lithe, fit form. \"Older than you. Probably older than your parents too.\"\n\n\"Why do you look so young?\"\n\n\"Because I'm a reality bender.\"\n\n\"Ohhhhh.\" Udo chuckled. \"So that's the difference between an 'expert in ontokinetics' and an 'ontokinetics expert'.\"\n\nRivera grinned. \"Exactly!\"\n\n\"How long have they known?\"\n\n\"The Foundation? All along.\"\n\n\"Wow.\" She wasn't at all sure how she felt about that.\n\nThey headed into the H&P station without trading another word. The platform was empty, and they wouldn't have long to wait.\n\n\"Well, go ahead,\" Rivera said apropos of nothing.\n\nUdo started. \"Huh?\" She realized she'd been staring, and thanked her genetics that she didn't blush very visibly.\n\n\"Ask me why I bother.\"\n\n\"I mean, it's pretty self-evident.\" Udo gestured, noting with no small amount of embarrassment that her hands trembled as she did it. \"Who wouldn't want to look like that?\" The other woman winked playfully at her, and Udo suspected even her dark skin was now flushing at least a little. \"Is it your actual appearance?\"\n\n\"Yup.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't wanna age either.\"\n\nRivera gave her an appraising look as the train pulled into the station. \"If? If you looked like this, you mean? I think maybe you need a mirror.\"\n\nThe act of boarding the nearest car saved Udo from having to respond to that. She had no idea what she would have said.\n\n\"Anyway.\" Rivera sat down, and Udo sat down across the aisle from her. \"It's my self-image. This is who I see when I picture myself. It's who I still feel like. So why would I change it?\"\n\nUdo nodded. The train left the station.\n\nRivera took her silence as an invitation to continue. \"I once heard about a guy who didn't know he was a reality bender until he suddenly realized his mind was dressing him in his old clothes, and turning his grey hair back to red.\"\n\n\"I cut my hair in the alternate timeline,\" Udo volunteered. She only knew this because Ngo had used video recording apparatus for their debriefing.\n\n\"And now it's long again,\" Rivera noted. That Udo's hair was long was the first thing people generally noticed about her. Udo had orange eyes; that was how long her hair was.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Sounds like you and the other you don't share a self-image,\" the ontokineticist remarked.\n\n\"Apparently not.\" Udo examined her fingernails. \"Alternate me also dumped my boyfriend, and I... don't want to.\"\n\nRivera shrugged. \"So don't.\"\n\n\"That easy?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. We see this all the time. Other realities make us into other people. That doesn't make who you are right now any less valid. You want your hair short? Cut it again. You want to stick with your guy? Stick with him. Be the best version of yourself for living in your present circumstances. That's probably what alternate you did.\"\n\n\"I know some of my reasons, for some of the things we did. Well, you heard the debriefing.\"\n\n\"Too bad it wasn't in-depth. You ought to get some ontokinetics people working here full time. Forth and Xyank are probably selling your boss on the virtues of scheduled Temporal Anomalies consults, but guess what? Working to their schema, that twenty four hour grace period then wham!\" -- she slammed her fist into her palm -- \"would have come right out of left field. Their shit doesn't work like that, and they never would have predicted it for you. If I'd been in that room, I wouldn't have let any of you leave until the whole tale was told. Reality bending doesn't follow the rules. That's what distinguishes it from magic.\"\n\nUdo refrained from offering to show Rivera how flexible her own magic was. Given her earlier open ogling, it might have come across as flirtatious, and the other woman was prominently displaying a wedding ring. \"So you think this is more ontokinetic than temporal?\"\n\n\"I think it's both, equally, which makes it an awful bitch of a mess. Hard to predict. There's definitely intentionality in there, though. The containment quality decline, by percentage points. The day-long grace periods. The arbitrary selections.\"\n\n\"Arbitrary selections?\"\n\n\"You seven, with your unique relationships to the effects.\"\n\n\"We were the ones who most directly affected the course of the breach,\" Udo explained.\n\n\"That's neat. Why would an unthinking natural force know to single you out for that? And anyway, if I recall correctly, you //don't// recall doing anything of particular importance.\"\n\nUdo's mouth migrated to one side of her face. \"I closed a valve. That's not nothing.\"\n\n\"Unless the valve was in your head,\" Rivera smirked, \"it doesn't explain why it preserves your memories between realities.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's a mystery, alright.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see what we can figure out for you today. There's a guy I want to talk to about this.\"\n\n\"Somebody special?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.

Udo hoped the nod was just a reflex action, that it didn't mean the ontokineticist thought Rydderech was actually watching their body language now. Even at Site-43, where everyone was under surveillance twenty four hours per day, the sensation of being watched was never particularly present.\n\n[[div class=\"danke wynn\"]]\nWill you tell her something for me?\n[[/div]]\n\n\"If you answer my question, sure.\"\n\n[[div class=\"danke wynn\"]]\nTime is progressive.

Dr. Rydderech, what did you want us to tell Dr. Reynders?\"\n\nThere was a pause.

She'd made it past the memetic decontamination tunnel with no obvious ill effects. \"Dr. Lillihammer. Do you r--\"\n\nLillian kicked off her desk, and snatched up her tablet. \"Who the fuck are you? Don't move. I'm calling security!\"\n\nThe other woman raised her hands in a placating gesture, then slowly moved one of them to her suit pocket. \"Wait! I have ID.\"\n\nLillian laughed at her. \"Just fucking with you. Been a long time, Marion.\"\n\nThe agent's face returned to its standard neutral-trending-to-disapproval configuration. \"You're not funny.\"\n\n\"I'm not as funny as I think I am, that's for sure.\" Lillian gestured. \"Sit down.\"\n\nMarion Wheeler took the seat, brushing the hem of her suit jacket aside to reveal a concealed holster. \"You do know I carry a gun?\"\n\n\"Which means you're trusted not to shoot panicky researchers.\" Lillian kicked her feet up on the table. \"Did you really think I'd forgotten you?\"\n\n\"I really did.\" It took a lot to get Wheeler's pulse going, but Lillian's dangerous joke had done the job. The otherwise unflappable woman was flushed with adrenaline.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't worry. You're unforgettable. You're tied into a core memory, from real early in my career. Before we met. Besides which, I never forget anything.\"\n\n\"This I am aware of. So, for example--\"\n\n\"You think you get to move on to examples before explanations? Not in my broom closet. What's this visit about?\"\n\nWheeler's eyes opened a little wider, as did her mouth, in the universal gesture for //sure, alright, let's do this then.// \"You people tripped our sensors half a dozen times in two years. If it hadn't been for the lack of manpower, I'd have come a lot sooner.\"\n\n\"That sentence was like a gift basket addressed to me.\"\n\n\"Thanks for not unwrapping it. My point is, this place is lousy with antimemetic activity. First you lost a hostile GoI's attention for no explicable reason; then you lost six minutes of a registered thaumaturge's time during a cascade containment breach; then you lost an apparently vital SCP object, so vital it had its own secret sublevel, now blackboxed out of reality; //then// you //found// a network of self-erasing spies at Area-21; then you found them //again// at Site-43 in an alternate timeline, then //forgot the alternate timeline itself.// Is that all, or did //I// forget anything?\"\n\n\"There's a thing re: forgetting you don't know about yet, but I'll remember to bring it up if it gets relevant. But yeah. When you say all that at once, it does sound bad. What did you mean about the thing where I could have made a sex joke? Manpower?\"\n\n\"We're understaffed and underfunded.\" She said it the way Lillian might have talked about a persistent shoulder ache, something unpleasant she'd long become accustomed to.\n\n\"My old supervisor told me you guys have a low life expectancy.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Wheeler nodded. \"Could be we used to have the numbers we need, and they all walked into invisible mouths and down invisible gullets and got invisibly digested. Could also be that they just stopped being visible to the rest of us. Could even be a more mundane reason. But antimemetic research isn't a popular field besides that, for obvious reasons. Everyone likes to forget the bad things, but forgetting the good is terrifying.\"\n\n\"Can't relate. Anyhow, to what //in specific// do I owe the pleasure of an Antimemetics Division consult?\"\n\nThere were much-maligned departments at the SCP Foundation. Just about nobody who didn't work there was fond of Pataphysics. Surrealistics, Semiotics, and Miscommunications were always major headaches to deal with. Even Tactical Theology offended the sensibilities of some of Lillian's less whimsical colleagues, usually the ones who'd been staunch atheists before the unpleasant discovery that gods did, in fact, exist, and didn't much care for being persistently reminded they'd been wrong. But the Antimemetics Division was truly beyond the pale. It wasn't that people dreaded their coming, it was more that they were almost always unexpected. The average researcher had trouble even remembering they existed. Anyone dealing with them regularly had to take special drugs to avoid forgetting that any such group had ever been formed. It was probably a red letter day for Marion, getting to consult with someone who didn't have to first be debriefed on what her entire deal was — the investigation of things which could not be perceived and stored in the little grey cells without tremendous effort and very often not even then, the invisible world which, having no sense of fair play, was often watching every move made in the visible one. Monsters that fed on recollection. Immemorial predators. Thoughts that couldn't be contained in the human mind, the noospheric equivalent of recondite particles. Lillian had once been considered as a potential recruit for the Division, and Wheeler had been her assessing officer.\n\nThe rejection remained one of the highest compliments she'd ever been paid.\n\nThe other woman rolled her eyes. \"Your debriefing from the alternate timeline made its way to my desk. At least someone at Temporal Anomalies, or Temporal Anomalies, is on the ball.\"\n\n\"What made this time so different?\"\n\nWheeler frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I CC'd you guys on the //geistschreiber// when we first found out about them. Didn't hear shit back. Assumed you didn't care.\"\n\nThe frown deepened. Wheeler's composed expression was rarely more than one unpleasant revelation away from creasing up in frustration. \"We never got that CC.\"\n\n\"You really need to work on your visibility. Have you tried taking out billboards?\"\n\n\"They'd just end up killing birds. What can you tell me about the //geistschreiber// that isn't in the reports? I know you know what's in them.\"\n\n//I never should have let them put 'eidetic memory' in my file.// \"Alright, sure. We've only talked to one of them in a situation where they're unlikely to have been bullshitting at maximum PSI, and it was the same one in baseline and the alternate. Her name is Alis.\"\n\n\"Presently in custody at Site-06.\"\n\n\"Yeah. That. When our security chief interrogated her after she tried to blow us all up -- Alis, not the Chief -- she got a lot of bluster about the inevitable end of the world in the most obnoxious know it all supervillain tone you could imagine. That's not in the report, but you can see it in the transcript for yourself.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"She wasn't like that at 43. But the Victims were.\"\n\n\"The seven particularly problematic individuals.\"\n\n\"Or the six we actually saw, yeah. Five? We didn't actually see Wirth... anyhow. They talked the same way. The //exact// same way. It was more than just an organization thing. It was more like a personality tic.\"\n\nThe frustration had shifted toward boredom. Wheeler got bored very easily when things weren't up her alley. Lillian respected that about her. \"Hmm.\"\n\n\"Not really your area, right?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" the other woman agreed. \"You've got people for parapsychology. I'm here for more forgettable things.\"\n\nA thought occurred. \"Well, actually... hmm.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Can you keep a secret?\"\n\nWheeler arched an eyebrow.\n\n\"Sorry, low blow. Alright. This isn't in any report, and it can't be in yours either. Those are my terms. I'm only telling you this in the first place because we have history.\"\n\n\"Will not reporting it put anyone in danger?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Then fine.\" Wheeler adjusted her glasses. \"Tell me your big secret.\"\n\n\"We all forgot the alternate timeline the day after coming back from it.\"\n\n\"That's in the addendum to the file,\" the antimemeticist sighed. \"I read it on the flight over.\"\n\n\"Cool. So obviously that's your outfit's kinda thing, but try this on for size on top of it: //I// did not forget. I still haven't.\"\n\nBoth eyebrows this time. \"Really.\"\n\n\"Really. I remember everything.\"\n\n\"Your memories didn't sync to baseline like the others?\"\n\n\"They synced, but were not replaced. I know both versions.\"\n\nWheeler's mouth formed into an 'o'. \"//That// is //very// strange.\"\n\n\"Right?\"\n\n\"Do you have an explanation?\"\n\n\"I'm special.\"\n\n\"Do you have a useful explanation?\"\n\n\"I'm useful. I've got the best memory at Site-43. I'm trained in countermemetics. I can look at kill agents without getting killed. Maybe I'm too spicy to sync.\"\n\nWheeler wasn't buying it. She was a savvy customer. \"Have you tried asking our captive ghostwriter about it?\"\n\nLillian wasn't capable of forgetting things, but like anyone else she couldn't focus on everything she knew at the same time. Unlike everyone else, she could focus on a great deal at once, but Alis Rydderech in her padded cell hadn't nearly made the cut. \"Now, there's a thought. No. I haven't.\"\n\nWheeler stood. \"Thanks for your time.\"\n\nLillian stood as well. \"I'm coming with you.\"\n\nThe other woman shook her head, then had to perform emergency surgery on her wild crop of curls. \"I'm heading back to Site-41.\"\n\n\"I'm not coming with you //now,// then, but we both know you're going to interview Alis soon. Let's kill two birds with one stone.\"\n\n\"What if we're the--\"\n\n\"What if we're the birds and she's the stone, yeah, the math works out that way, doesn't it?\" Lillian shrugged. \"Well, unless you've slowed down a lot in three years, I think we can still fly circles around her.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 12 September\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\"Friends.\" McInnis smiled at them each in turn, all six of them. \"It's time we formalized our little arrangement.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillihammer agreed. \"We should all get together in some official conspiracy thing. Oh, wait.\"\n\nThey were sitting in their //de facto// clubhouse, Okorie's quarters. Harry was at his accustomed position on the couch next to his on-again-off-again, and their body language suggested they weren't sure which state was which anymore. Everyone else was where they usually sat: Lillihammer in her chair, Ibanez and Nascimbeni at opposite ends of the dining table, McInnis at the wall, Wettle on the floor.\n\n\"I take it,\" Harry sighed, \"you mean setting up proper protocols for September 8 next year.\"\n\n\"Please don't let this happen again next year,\" the old tech moaned.\n\n\"It's happened three times,\" Okorie reminded him needlessly. \"We have to assume it's going to keep on happening.\"\n\n\"Meetings happen all the time,\" Wettle interjected. \"It's not so bad. You don't even have to go.\"\n\nHarry sank down in the cushions. \"Willie...\"\n\n\"I could invite Dr. Elstrom into this conversation,\" McInnis threatened, \"if you are unable to govern yourselves.\"\n\nThey all sat up straighter, and looked at him silently.\n\n\"Thank you. Now, I am going to have to ask rather a lot from this little group in the coming years. Repeating the events of one of the worst days of your professional lives is no easy task for which to prepare. I therefore intend to recommend all of you, and myself, for a strict training regimen.\"\n\nHarry's expression shifted from exhaustion to suspicion. \"What sort of training?\"\n\n\"Survival training.\"\n\nThe archivist's face fairly collapsed. \"Oh, god.\"\n\n\"Kiss your paunch goodbye,\" Lillihammer crowed.\n\n\"//You// kiss it.\"\n\nOkorie gave him a complicated look.\n\n\"Can I be excused with a doctor's note?\" Wettle whined.\n\n\"What would even be the point of survival training?\" Nascimbeni demanded. \"We're not going to go to war with the bodies we build, we'll have to make do with the ones we get zapped into.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Harry pointed at him, \"good point. Doesn't matter how svelte we get--\"\n\n\"You will never be 'svelte',\" Lillihammer laughed.\n\n\"--because we'll be leaving these bodies in baseline.\"\n\n\"Two counterarguments to that,\" McInnis responded. \"First, survival training will increase your physical health. We don't know how long these breaches will keep up, and we can't afford to lose any of you while they're ongoing. In fact, I'm going to recommend that each of you be granted life extension healthcare of the sort typically reserved for Site Directors, to give us as much time to find a solution as possible.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Nascimbeni's mouth hung open between words. \"You're going to make us immortal?\"\n\n\"You think this is going to take //decades?//\" Okorie added. \n\n\"Seriously.\" Ibanez looked disgusted.\n\nMcInnis wasn't surprised to see how they reacted. Okorie and Ibanez were the youngest, so they were more concerned with long commitment than the steady march of time. Nascimbeni was the oldest, and the prospect of arresting his progress must have seemed appealing. Harry had a foot in both camps, and neither Lillihammer nor Wettle appeared to be listening at all now. \"//Second,//\" he resumed, \"learning bodily control will enable you to make the most of any physique you jump into when the timeline switches.\"\n\n\"Again,\" said Lillihammer, who could quip even when she was only barely following the conversational thread, \"my guy here will never have anything that can be fairly described as a //physique.//\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Harry growled. \"I don't like that we're assuming this is inevitably going to happen again.\"\n\n\"Oh my god,\" Ibanez started. \"Anyone wanna say that for the forty-seventh time?\"\n\nWettle opened his mouth.\n\nHarry raised a hand. \"I don't mean the breach, I mean fucking it up. It's defeatist to assume we'll end up creating another timeline.\"\n\n\"We //must// make that assumption,\" said McInnis.\n\n\"But the avoidance steps are so simple!\" Okorie cried.\n\n\"Shit happens,\" Nascimbeni sighed.\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"Precisely.\"\n\nThey all looked at Wettle.\n\n\"What? I don't have any questions, or anything.\"\n\n\"As I stated at the outset,\" McInnis continued, I wish to make formal arrangements for addressing this anomaly. To that end, I propose the following: creating a new SCP file covering the effects of the breach, and creating a Provisional Task Force to manage its containment.\"\n\n\"Super goddamn provisional,\" Ibanez grumbled. \"One day per year.\"\n\n\"With significant preparatory duties, of course.\"\n\n\"Got a name in mind? Naming these things is half the reason to make them.\"\n\nHe spread his hands wide. \"I am open to suggestions.\"\n\n\"The Survivors,\" Nascimbeni said immediately. Several of them nodded.\n\n\"We can continue using that term internally, but I suspect the other personnel of this facility might misunderstand the meaning.\"\n\nWettle blinked. \"How?\"\n\n\"If we're the Survivors,\" Harry told him, \"it implies that everyone else //isn't.//\"\n\n\"Big yikes,\" Wettle agreed.\n\n\"Timeline Travellers,\" Lillihammer suggested.\n\nOkorie shifted excitedly on the couch. \"Yeah!\"\n\n\"Already taken,\" said McInnis.\n\nThe memeticist frowned. \"By who?\"\n\n\"They're from another timeline. It's complicated.\"\n\nOkorie raised her hands dramatically. \"Doom Patrol.\"\n\n\"Too dramatic.\"\n\n\"The Replacements,\" said Ibanez.\n\n\"Let's not make it too clear how this works, please.\"\n\nNascimbeni's delivery suggested he knew his next suggestion was far too tortuous, and didn't care. \"Set Wrong What Once Went Wrong.\"\n\nHarry laughed.\n\n\"Replication Students,\" said Wettle.\n\nHarry leaned forward. \"Heyyyy.\"\n\n\"That's pretty good,\" Lillihammer admitted begrudgingly.\n\nAt roughly the same time, Okorie said \"I vote for that\" and Nascimbeni said \"Works for me.\"\n\n\"I can live with it,\" Ibanez yawned.\n\nShe was right to yawn. It was getting late, and there was much to organize on the coming day. \"If there are no other suggestions...\"\n\nHarry stood up. \"Good stuff.

Dramatic local reality alterations will revive and subsequently terminate seven deceased Foundation personnel and damage containment apparatus throughout the Site.\n\n8 September every year features an exact reprise of the events of 8 September 2002, when Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D was destroyed in a cascade containment breach. For seven minutes each year, the entire facility reverts to its 2002 configuration.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Individuals within AAF-D when these transitions occur suffer no obvious ill effects, but should take care not to occupy space which is otherwise occupied by machinery or structural elements in either iteration of the facility. [[/span]]\n\nEach of the personnel killed in 2002 will be returned to life by SCP-5243 sixty seconds before the moments of their deaths. They are sapient human beings with physical forms and agency, and will behave as they did in 2002 so long as the appropriate contextual triggers are received. If they are interfered with, it is possible for them to miss their appointments with SCP-5243. They may survive, and containment will have failed.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n**SITUATIONAL SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 5243-5 REQUIRED FOR FURTHER REVIEW**\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nSCP-5243 produces two Amida-class disruption effects: the creation of unstable alternate timelines, and the de-containment of all subjects at Site-43.\n\nThe Special Containment Procedures for SCP-5243 ensure that each reprise is identical to the original breach, because each reprise is identical //with// the original breach. These are not re-enactments, but are rather re-occurrences of the actual historical event. Failing to adhere to the Special Containment Procedures will actually change the course of history: a Class-CK reality restructuring event will occur twenty-four hours after the end of SCP-5243, and baseline reality will be reorganized into an alternate timeline.\n\nThe seven personnel who were not killed by SCP-5243 but directly participated in its original containment (Dr. H. Blank, Chief D. Ibanez, Dr. L. Lillihammer, Dr. A. McInnis, Chief N. Nascimbeni, Dr. U. Okorie and Dr. W. Wettle) have also become entangled with it. While all other sentient beings immediately become their alternate counterparts when the timeline shifts, these individuals instead replace them. They alone retain their memories of baseline reality, and are therefore capable of restoring it by correctly enacting the Special Containment Protocols for SCP-5243 when it next occurs twelve months later. For this purpose they have been organized into Provisional Task Force Sampi-5243 (\"See You In September\") and given advanced survival training...\n\n[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/37-waiting-to-happen/WT_Sampi_5243.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 19 September\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169 Site-169]: Glassford Hill, Yavapai County, Arizona, United States of America**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nThe first few days on the open-air track were murder, for most of them.\n\nMcInnis and Ibanez were in tip-top shape, though the latter bristled at the suggestion she should have to jog in plain sight. She tended to attract a crowd whenever she did that, and she wasn't in the mood for attracting; they were here for work, not play, despite the fact that 169 was the Foundation's only dedicated recreational facility. Lillihammer was lean and lithe, but she typically spent more time standing around than walking or running, so the daily track practice wiped her out in relatively short order. Okorie had never expended much effort on building her muscles, and they started aching fast when she put them to the test despite the super-science supplements they were all taking to boost their mass gain.

At least, there isn't meant to be.\"\n\n\"You make a good argument.\" Nascimbeni put his head down, and closed his eyes.

To soothe the antimemeticist's wounded pride, Lillian arranged for Epsilon-43 to fly them in to Site-06 direct.\n\nThe facility existed under the cover of a wildlife preserve. Their Sea King helicopter had to endure the application of a wrap proclaiming it to belong to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, and the two of them had to endure a brief photoshoot to produce their fake IDs in the unlikely event that their cover was blown. The chopper touched down on a helipad surrounded by trees in a dip in the earth, and the helipad promptly dipped down even further on greased rails.

I know all about alternate timelines. I'm from one.\"\n\nThe casual way she said this, Lillian almost missed it. Wheeler, however, came alive. \"Do tell.\"\n\n\"My ancestors came here in a magic flying mansion, and when the world's about to end, I'll leave here in it. Isn't that great?\" She snorted. \"I think it's great.\"\n\nLillian sighed. \"You've been in here how many months? You could have spent the time making up a better story.\"\n\n\"Who says I'm making anything up? I'm just so excited to have visitors, I'm spilling all the beans. A girl gets lonely, you know?\"\n\nWheeler stood up. Lillian followed suit.\n\n\"Wait,\" the prisoner winced. \"Please wait.\"\n\nWheeler waited. \"I've got precisely zero time to waste on your smartass bullshit today.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" She did look sorry. \"Sit down.\"\n\nThey sat back down. \"That might be the first thing you've said that wasn't soaked in irony,\" Lillian noted.\n\n\"I wasn't kidding. It's lonely in here.\" Alis placed both elbows on the table, and framed her tired face with both hands. \"I'm in solitary, do you get that? Nobody's spoken more than a few words to me in three months.\"\n\n\"You know what?\" Lillian smiled at her. \"I'm going to say it anyway. Why so blue?\"\n\n\"You're faking the arrogance this time around,\" Wheeler added. \"It's not making it past your voice box. Are you depressed?\"\n\nLillian clapped. \"You don't believe in all your magic cult bullshit anymore, do you?\"\n\n\"Pick that up from alternate me?\" Alis frowned.\n\n\"Yeah, in point of fact.\"\n\n\"Just level with us,\" Wheeler suggested.\n\nThe //geistschreiber// looked back and forth between them, several very different emotions fighting for control over her face. \"I don't trust you.\"\n\n\"Trust this.\" Lillian smiled nastily at her. \"At your present level of cooperation, your only chance of getting out of here is a precisely targeted earthquake.\"\n\n\"I'm never getting out of here,\" Alis retorted, \"no matter what I do. You haven't got any carrots to dangle.\"\n\n\"I'd have thought you'd at least take this opportunity to try and convert us to your cause,\" Wheeler remarked.\n\nAlis shrugged. \"What's the point?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lillian nodded. \"What //is// the point?\"\n\n\"Okay. You know what?\" Alis threw up her hands. \"Fuck it. I don't care anymore. Here's the deal. I don't know why I did what I did.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Lillian smiled at her. \"I know.\"\n\n\"You know what the //giftschreiber// are too, right?\"\n\n\"Chaos meme cult. Disorganized. Violent. Insurgency with a better name, and a lot more creativity.\"\n\nAlis paused. \"I could tell you things about the Chaos Insurgency, if you want.\"\n\n\"This isn't about what she wants,\" Wheeler interrupted.\n\n\"We could make it--\"\n\n\"This is about what I need as an agent of the Foundation's first line response against antimemetic threats. I need to know everything you know about the //giftschreiber.//\"\n\n\"And you'll believe me?\"\n\n\"No, but I'll treat what you say as potential data.\"\n\nAlis smirked. \"Good enough. So here's the thing, right? When I was with them, in the in-group, it all made sense. Then your sewage factory blew up, and we all lost the plot. //Then// you dumped me in here for a year, and now I honestly couldn't tell you a single thing they told me that I still believe.\"\n\n\"Sounds like memetic compulsion,\" Wheeler mused.\n\n\"Sounds more like one of those overlays we encountered,\" said Lillian.\n\nWheeler blinked. \"Overlays?\"\n\n\"Someone else's personality elements and personal drive overlaid on yours. You're still mostly you, but someone's nudging the tiller.\"\n\n\"That,\" Alis nodded vigorously. It was the first real vigour she'd displayed since they'd come in. \"That's what it felt like with the //giftschreiber.// That exactly.\"\n\n\"So you drank the Kool Aid,\" Lillian said, \"and it made you a good little soldier, but now it's wearing off.\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"How does your antimemetic effect work?\" Wheeler pressed.\n\n\"Indiscriminately. I can't turn it on or off. It's always on, and I have to be extra memorable to overcome it.\"\n\n\"You were wearing a low-yield meme coat in the alternate timeline,\" Lillian recalled. \"Bright, like your hair. All the other memeticists ditched their dazzlewear early on, because none of them wanted to be extra visible with monsters prowling the place. You, on the other hand, had to light up and //present// just so people wouldn't forget that you were there.\"\n\nThe //geistschreiber// nodded. \"Yep. Checks out.\"\n\n\"How did you acquire it?\" Wheeler asked. \"Your glamour?\"\n\n\"You call this glamour?\" Alis puffed out her D-class jacket.\n\nWheeler stared at her.\n\n\"You're not as fun as the 43 people. Well, I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Is that a joke?\" Wheeler demanded.\n\n\"I wish it was. We were going to start inducting new members when you had your little disaster, and poof! totally forgot how it works.\"\n\nWheeler suddenly stood. \"You'll have to excuse us for a moment.\"\n\n\"Can't very well refuse,\" Alis shrugged.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Lillian stood up as well. \"Fun how this works, eh?\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nLillian started to speak the moment the door sealed behind them. The guard stepped away to give them privacy. \"You're thinking what I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"I am,\" Wheeler agreed.\n\n\"And we didn't even have to be in the same memetic cult.\"\n\n\"The erasure of whatever was in the empty chambers on your secret fourth sublevel is what confused the //giftschreiber.//\"\n\n\"And whatever it was, it gave them their power.\"\n\n\"A power source? An artifact? A //mentor?//\"\n\n\"I'd lean towards the latter. That would explain--\"\n\n\"The personality overlay.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"So let's say you had some sort of next level cryptomancer down there, and they got aerosolized by the incident. Would that explain your seven crazy colleagues?\"\n\n\"Assuming you mean the dead ones, yes.\"\n\n\"Would it explain why you still remember the alternate timeline?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWheeler took off her glasses, and rubbed her eyes. For someone so young, she had very old eyes. \"I think we should try mnestic therapy on your friends, see if they can recall--\"\n\nThe hall lights snapped to red.\n\n\"Uh oh,\" said Lillian.\n\nThe guard immediately walked back toward them, weapon raised. \"Ma'ams, I need you to--\"\n\nWheeler shot him in the chest. He dropped like a sack of potatoes. She grabbed Lillian by the wrist and flung her through the next open bulkhead, followed, and closed it behind her with a few quick taps on a panel Lillian hadn't even noticed.\n\n\"Got his disaster response priority wrong,\" she explained as she used her keycard to lock the heavy door.\n\n\"Kinda thin evidence for killing somebody.\" Lillian's voice was flat. She hoped she wasn't going into shock already.\n\n\"He's just winded. I shot him where the armour is thickest, just in case. Worst case scenario, broken rib.\"\n\nThe containment breach lights were on, but there was no alarm wailing. That was bad. There should have been a voice telling them what the problem was, which also wasn't happening. That was worse. Wheeler dragged her by the hand back down the hallway they'd taken, then sharply turned a corner and headed perpendicular to their original path. There could only be one explanation for such a diversion: the antimemeticist thought they were the target of the attack, and she was trying to occlude their location.\n\nFat lot of good that would do, with all the cameras in this damn place. The lower levels of Site-06 made Paramax look like Alcatraz.\n\nAs they passed an interrogation room, the door suddenly slid open and a pudgy-faced man clutching a binder appeared in the frame. \"What's going on?\"\n\nLillian took the binder from his hands and slammed it into his face. The binder was metal. It pulverized his nose. As he staggered back, screeching, blood pouring through the fingers clutching at his wound, Wheeler locked him in the office. She shot Lillian a questioning glance.\n\n\"Level two clearance badge. Shouldn't be down here.\"\n\nWheeler considered. \"I think it was only the back half that's level three plus. Past the checkpoint.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Lillian considered as well. \"Probably still better that he's not roaming around. Safer in there.\"\n\nWheeler smiled for the first time. \"With you out here, definitely. Know how to use a gun?\"\n\nShe shook her head, then reached into her pants. There was no pocket. \"No, but I've got something better. Something that doesn't set off metal detectors.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nWheeler disabled the next three suspected hostiles in ways which didn't allow Lillian to use her carry on luggage. One had either made the rookie mistake of becoming the spitting image of the man whose nose Lillian had just broken, or else was himself the real McCoy. Wheeler stuck him in an elevator and locked it down just to be safe. The next one was actually in the process of changing its face and clothes in the corridor when they crept up on it, so Wheeler took the shot. She blew out its kneecap, but then a whole load of its friends came rushing towards them and they had to lock the nearest bulkhead and detour. This presented them with a particularly ballsy //geistschreiber// masquerading as Wheeler herself. She shot that one in the head without blinking.\n\nLillian figured out the fourth and final one by what she felt was a brilliant process of deduction. They passed a locked lab with a panicked-looking janitor peering out the window at them, and they almost let it slide until Lillian noticed that the light over the keypad was red. Staff were given extra authority to lock doors during a security breach, but anything done outside their usual clearance level would produce an amber light instead.\n\nThat janitor apparently had researcher permissions.\n\nWheeler waited until they were out of his field of vision before shooting the window glass out, reaching in, and pulling the dazed impostor into the corridor.\n\nBefore he could react, Lillian stuck a thin piece of card in his face. \"Cooperation,\" she said.\n\nHe stared at her.\n\nShe showed him the next card. His eyes flicked briefly from side to side. He wanted not to look, but had no lasting control now. \"Abstract thought.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"//Guernica.// You ever see it? They covered it up, you know, when we went to war in Iraq. Everyone is happy to countenance the horrors of armed conflict until we really, //really// want to prosecute one.\"\n\nShe showed him the next card, after selecting carefully. \"Motivating forces.\"\n\nHe grunted. His eyes were narrowed. Right about now he was getting a killer migraine. \"The only thing that keeps me getting up in the morning is Pop Tarts. I like them uncooked.\"\n\nShe smiled. She'd heard this progressive limitation of people's possible avenues of thought, MARSTON Verification Protocol, described as torture. It left your mind stuck in an increasingly constricted space until it was just you and the desired information. As methods of interrogation went, however, it was a lot less invasive than just beating the truth out of the target.\n\n\"Mission objectives.\"\n\nHis eyes filled with tears with the strain of trying to resist. \"Keep casualties to a minimum. Extract only when ready. Don't break cover.\"\n\nShe pulled the last card. \"Operative subject.\"\n\nHe sagged. \"Capture the vessel.\"\n\n\"What vessel? Vessel for what?\"\n\nThe man screamed.\n\n\"Who's the vessel?\" she shouted to be heard.\n\nLike she'd flicked a switch, he stopped screaming. \"You,\" he said through clenched teeth. \"You're the fucking vessel.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\"What did he mean, you're the vessel?\" They were running now, and Wheeler was shooting out every camera they came across.

Their federal agent badges got them into the relief camp set up for the survivors of Site-06, which was presently a smoking ruin already described in the popular press as some kind of freak tectonic disaster. The Nature Conservation people were going to get to clamp down even harder on the region in response, which was good, because the whole facility would need to be written off and its inmates, the ones who'd been recaptured, relocated. \n\nSomeone had managed to stop the nuclear device from going off. Smart money was on Wheeler and Lillihammer, though neither of them could remember doing it. Someone had also liberated two prisoners, and killed about two dozen members of Site security staff in the process. The former fact had to be added, re-added, and re-re-added to the official report by Wheeler, who was used to that kind of thing, as nobody but them seemed to remember that either Alis Rydderech or Imogen Tarrow had ever been incarcerated at Site-06, or in fact who those names might even belong to.\n\nA comprehensive debriefing showed that neither memeticist nor antimemeticist remembered anything past midnight on the first day. Not how they'd survived. Not how they'd escaped. Not even what could have happened to make them forget these things.
