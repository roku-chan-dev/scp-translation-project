Cell is to be furnished with appropriate furnishings for a █-year-old child, along with two stuffed animals (an orca whale and an elephant). SCP-2118 may go to an outdoor enclosure once a day, for a length not to exceed one hour between the hours of 0900 and 1700. It is to be accompanied by at least one attendant who has never had children and is versed in American Sign Language (ASL) and its translation etiquette and usage. SCP-2118 is not to be allowed verbal access to any other personnel except within approved testing parameters.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2118 is a human female, age █, with orange hair and light gray eyes. It has a scar on its right cheek, 9cm long, in the shape of an open parenthesis. SCP-2118 claims it received the scar several years ago when it was struck by a stranger on the street, but is reluctant to elaborate further. \n\nSCP-2118 communicates primarily through ASL and occasionally through writing, though it is capable of producing coherent speech.\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-2118 manifest when it is exposed to a parent who has, at some point in their life, dealt with the death of their child. In these instances SCP-2118 begins to speak in a voice inconsistent with what its own should sound like, instead reflecting the age and gender of the aforementioned deceased child (hereafter referred to as SCP-2118-01) at time of death. SCP-2118 is aware of its speech and vocal patterns as well as the psychological distress they cause the parent, signing various apologies and platitudes even as it continues speaking. Testing has indicated that SCP-2118-01 must have been --prepubescent-- under the age of 18 at time of death. (Further testing indicated it is not the biological age, but the legal age, by which SCP-2118-01 defines a 'child'.)\n\nTypically the words and sounds SCP-2118 mimics are consistent with the final words/sounds of SCP-2118-01. It is uncertain, at this point, how SCP-2118 accurately mimics the sounds of drowning, asphyxiation, or the formation of blisters in the throat cavity. Of note is that SCP-2118's face maintains a look of contrition while said sounds are being mimicked, despite the occasionally violent nature of SCP-2118-01's death.\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"Interview #01, █/█/20██\" hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\"]] **Interview 2118-01:**\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-2118, Dr. Danvers translating\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Drs.

SCP-2118's voice cuts off and is replaced by gurgling and physical throat depressions consistent with clawing at throat for breath. D-3498 begins to fight against his restraints and, when that does not work, turns on SCP-2118.>//\n> \n> **D-3498:** Shut up, bitch! Bitch! That's not your voice!\n> \n> //<D-3498 throws himself against his restraints at SCP-2118 and Agents M██████████ and C█████ are called in, removing D-3498 for termination.>//\n> \n> **Dr. Wu:** Thank you, SCP-2118.

Researcher Anselman watches SCP-2118 sleep for a moment, then begins tapping on the glass. SCP-2118 remains asleep for 96 seconds, only waking when Researcher Anselman begins knocking on the glass.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Anselman:** SCP-2118? SCP-2118. Wake up.\n> \n> **SCP-2118:** [You're not supposed to be here.]\n> \n> //<SCP-2118 has begun trembling, indicative of the approach of SCP-2118-01.

I can't be anyone.]\n> \n> //<Researcher Anselman begins to cry and kneels in front of the glass, looking at the ground.

Dad, I--\n> \n> //<Security camera 03, directed at the northwest door leading into the hallway containing SCP-2118's cell, activates. Dr. Wu enters and, upon seeing Researcher Anselman interacting with SCP-2118, stops moving and watches. SCP-2118 begins imitating the sounds of gasping and struggling to breathe while maintaining its stare, although its expression is now more sad than angry. After 58 seconds of this, it fades and SCP-2118 quiets, still staring at Researcher Anselman.>//\n> \n> **SCP-2118:** [I can't help you.]\n> \n> //<Researcher Anselman remains where he is for 3.5 minutes, then stands and walks out of view of camera 72, into view of camera 03.

SCP-2118 presses its forehead against the glass, staring at where camera 03 confirms Researcher Anselman was standing. After 5 minutes of inactivity, camera 72 shuts off.>//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[/Collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2117]]] | SCP-2118 | [[[SCP-2119]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 2118-1.jpg\n> **Author:** ahbonjour\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2118|SCP Wiki]]]\n> **Derivative of:**\n> ------\n> **Name:** Should I?\n> **Author:** Grant\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/visual_dichotomy/3872367583/in/photolist-6UbTYk-juNfjT-dGQC2Z-5GfiXB-4u1ccv-5GfiVc-bbCJ8z-6uqo8F-6gVG6k-7BjWPz-3pFTD2-4XdVNR-51XD2y-7BjZkt-9EUdnP-k5PmEH-7frCYi-5aXsP-5EzgXR-fBYy8-m73aUn-fHGepz-9jXqpC-zAME-infYNW-aJt7Ae-6Fagam-6F69tp-6F6byH-9iPNhk-8kmeKL-5UEVZC-57y4UN-odZnAU-5oeWii-4iLKxD-936sKo-4iyMBW-a7YWWr-kgfgVm-4XSocC-6UbUMZ-6UbT8H-9xQcB7-pK2Gee-9akRk-pZpBgS-8c4mry-akdUQJ-4rhJS|Link]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
