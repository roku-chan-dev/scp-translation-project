In his mind he wanted to call them newspaper, but most were printed on the thin sheets of recycled plastic that had become the de facto writing material onboard what some were laughably calling the United Earth Fleet.\n\n[[div style=\"float: left; width: 280px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #666; padding: 0 15px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-family: Times New Roman, serif; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify;\"]]\n{{**The Sidereal Messenger**}}\n\n**CID Reps Refuse Comment On 'Soylent Red'**\n\n(**CIDF //People's Will//**) In a press conference to discuss the continued rollout of the increasingly popular Type 3 Synthetic Ration, representatives from the Chinese Central Investigation Department's Hydro-Agricultural Division refused to comment on the common nickname for the food product, instead restating that the Synthetic Ration is composed entirely of proteins derived from rice and other hydroponically-grown crops. \n\nControversy has erupted following the discovery of untraceable chemical additives in up to 93% of all...\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #666; padding: 0 15px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-family: Times New Roman, serif; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify;\"]]\n__**The Wandering Star**__\n\n**'A Spectacular Failure'**\n**The GOCS //Yeager// Tragedy**\n\n(**UNOC Central Command, //Athena One//**) In the chaotic days of the early Departure the one constant in many people's lives was the daily update from the doomed Global Occult Coalition starship //Yeager// and its heroic crew who gave their lives to get civilian contractors to safety even as their experimental ship collapsed around them. Now, for the first time, this five-part series will feature...\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #666; padding: 0 15px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-family: Times New Roman, serif; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify;\"]]\n{{**The Sidereal Messenger**}}\n\n**Insider: 'UNOC Trials Humanoid Combat Vehicle'**\n\n(**UNOC Central Command, //Athena One//**) Increasing sightings of humanoid vehicles being tested around the UNOC Lunar Defense Facility docking bay have lead many to speculate that the UN is investing in a secret program of advanced rearmament.\n\n\"It looked to be about three stories tall, sort of hunchbacked.

Right?**\n\nI think in the years since the Departure what's amazed me most isn't what people are willing to believe, but what they're willing to //disbelieve//. We still, to this day, don't know what happened to the Earth. And neither the UNOC nor the GRU nor even the Foundation are willing to spill the beans about what or who was involved. Why then, do some sticks in the mud still insist that what happened was a natural phenomenon?

In studying the man behind the myth, it is nearly impossible to avoid the extremes; for every accusation of war crimes and Nazism there is a hagiographic portrayal of a selfless Renaissance man putting Humanity on a new path. Interviews are, of course, impossible, and the few facts we know are tenuous...\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #666; padding: 0 15px; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; font-family: Times New Roman, serif; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); text-align: justify;\"]]\n__**The Wandering Star**__\n\n**SICP Delays Product Release**\n**Questions Mounting over Viability of Lasers**\n\n(**UEFS //Stride Boldly//**) In an announcement that had investors feeling a certain haunting familiarity, Subach-Innes Consumer Products today announced that they would be delaying the general release of their LCOL series of combat lasers despite high demand for their use as asteroid defense equipment.
