Any images found to contain cognitohazardous properties are to be systematically removed from their respective image hosting services and saved to a Foundation server.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2304 is the collective designation for a group of at least 14 images all carrying some degree of cognitohazardous properties[[footnote]]Subdesignated SCP-2304-1 through 14.[[/footnote]]. SCP-2304 instances take the form of common internet memes[[footnote]] Images created and shared by internet users, typically to incite a humorous response from the receiver.[[/footnote]], and are artificially over-processed and edited for comedic effect. All SCP-2304 instances carry the ability to cause spontaneous muscle cell growth upon viewing, often resulting in --death--[[span style=\"color:blue\"]] the constriction of air passages and consequent medical issues. (UPDATED [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3984 2020-09-12]) [[/span]]\n\n**Discovery Log:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSCP-2304 first came to the Foundation's attention in 2019, after a series of suspicious deaths from constricted airways caused by extreme cell growth in the throat. It was initially classified as an unknown vector, but following the ΩK \"End of Death\" scenario on 2020-09-12, several surviving victims were located and interviewed to discover the source of the anomaly. A victim of an SCP-2304 instance revealed to Foundation personnel that they had acquired the SCP-2304 instance from an internet relay chatroom, #██████████, under the handle \"OxyGenesis\". Agent Smith was chosen to attempt to infiltrate this community, under the handle \"PebbleTooth\".\n[[/div]]\n\n**Attached Files:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"#██████████ Excerpts\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"chat\"]]\n\n> Excerpt: September 28th, 2021\n\n[[<]]\n> = **PebbleTooth has joined.**\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**Komodo:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"member2\"]]OPS[[/span]] does anybody know this guy\n> [[span class=\"ping\"]]**commodore69:**[[/span]] im gonna fucking punt you if you keep pinging us for dumb shit\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"member\"]]Komodo:[[/span]] hello\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**FastNJammin:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"member0\"]]PebbleTooth:[[/span]] yo, how did you like\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**FastNJammin:**[[/span]] find this place\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**stormstorm:**[[/span]] through the internet, id bet\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**FastNJammin:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"member\"]]stormstorm:[[/span]] kinda busy here\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"member2\"]]FastNJammin:[[/span]] A friend thought i'd like it, OxyGenesis.\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**Komodo:**[[/span]] oh fuck, oxygenesis\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**stormstorm:**[[/span]] haven't seen him for a while\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] he got busy with irl stuff\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**FastNJammin:**[[/span]] I trust oxy's judgement. welcome.\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] so, uh\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] what goes on here? oxy told me something about like, memes\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**stormstorm:**[[/span]] oxy probably explained to u what anart is, right?\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**PebbleTooth:**[[/span]] he told me they were like irl memes\n> = [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal**[[/span]] uploaded file [[span class=\"membe0r\"]]1632838905.png[[/span]] 1mb **[[span class=\"click\"]]⬇[[/span]]**\n> = //[[span class=\"member2\"]]**FastNJammin**[[/span]] kicked **Takeovermetal**.
