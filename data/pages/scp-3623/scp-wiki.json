In the opposite scenario, where SCP-3623 dies, the host starts developing symptoms of depression and various psychological problems leading to eventual suicide in 93% of cases. During this process, SCP-3623 will experience a great amount of pain and involuntarily undergo an event similar to metamorphosis. SCP-3623 will replace at least 50% of its genome and go through a complete body and personality change. The memory of SCP-3623 is also replaced. It is to be noted that in some cases, SCP-3623 will retain the memory of its nature as an anomalous entity.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Transcript of a recorded transfer process\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n> //[Video has been recorded on 04/01/2011 after a breach at Site-91 caused the death of Researcher ██████, who was at the time the host of SCP-3623-13.

As of writing this, no effective way of breaking the connection between SCP-3623 and its host exists. Termination of host triggers a transfer event and termination of SCP-3623 causes host to develop severe anxiety and depression, eventually leading to suicide.\nDue to this, the fact that instances of SCP-3623 themselves exhibit no dangerous properties and the memory alteration caused during their transfer, it has been decided that SCP-3623-12 and -13 will be given statuses of Foundation employees. \n\n**Protocol:**\n* All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to be kept oblivious of their true nature.\n* Hosts of respective instances are to be informed of their nature as hosts and are to be given all information regarding the instance of SCP-3623 that connected to them.\n* All instances of Foundation employees who are SCP-3623 are to have their security clearance edited without their knowledge and are not allowed to leave Site-91.\n* Should any instance of SCP-3623 realise their true nature, they are to be referred to the document below.\n\n**Document 3623-VII:**\n> Welcome,\n> \n> You are here because you want to know who you are.
