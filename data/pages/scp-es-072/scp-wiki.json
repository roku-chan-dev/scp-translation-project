Due to multiple failures, the probe ceased its functions completely after three hours .]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-ES-072\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its current location and inaccessible nature, direct containment has been deemed unfeasible and unnecessary. Currently, the Foundation's efforts will focus on the permanent remote observation of the area occupied by the anomaly and all unauthorized satellite images that may reveal the existence of SCP-ES-072 will be edited.\n\n**Update:** As of 08/08/2018, proposals for the exploration of SCP-ES-072 have been suspended indefinitely. For more information, see //ADDENDUM-C//.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-072 is a translucent dome-shaped barrier approximately 5 kilometers high at its apex, currently covering the entirety of Atalanta Planitia, on the surface of Venus. SCP-ES-072 has its own electromagnetic field that, along with additional unquantifiable forces, is believed to grant it complete invulnerability to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1694|SCP-1694]]]. The presence of this anomaly, as well as the aforementioned field, have greatly hampered sampling and more intensive research; all data has been obtained primarily through satellite observation and analysis.\n\nSCP-ES-072 has proven to be impermeable to gases and external environmental agents, it maintains an independent atmosphere and soil concentration, as well as the presence of liquid water and its own microclimate, conditions that have made it ideal for hosting life.\n\nThe biosphere contained by SCP-ES-072 has multiple biomes that include forests, jungles, taigas, steppes and savannas, which are home to a great diversity of organisms, many of which have been recognized as extinct species in different time periods, as well as current species, generally referred to as SCP-ES-072-1. Additionally, it is inhabited by other unregistered species that are completely endemic to SCP-ES-072, hereinafter referred to as SCP-ES-072-2.\n\nThe currently recorded flora includes diverse species belonging to the families //Pinaceae//, //Arecaceae// and //Cycadaceae//, as well as the genera //Phyllostachys//, //Salix//, //Quercus//, //Dryopteris//, //Aglaophyton//, //Lepidodendron//, //Rhynia//, //Sigillaria// and //Calamites//. In turn, more than 15 types of ferns and primitive-looking arboreal plants have been observed that are believed to be extinct, uncatalogued species.\n\nSome of the fauna identified so far includes specimens of Arabian gazelle (//Gazella gazella//), springbok (//Antidorcas marsupialis//), addax (//Addax nasomaculatus//), common wildebeest (//Connochaetes taurinus//), American bison (//Bison bison//), water buffalo (//Bubalus bubalis//), gaurs (//Bos gaurus//), argala marabous (//Leptoptilos dubius//), African jabirues (//Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis//), warthogs (//Phacochoerus africanus//), giant moas (//Ginornis robustus//), entelodons (//Entelodon magnus//), phororrhacids belonging to the genera //Phorusrhacos// and //Titanis//, dinotheriums (//Deinotherium giganteum//), uintatheriums (//Uintatherium anceps//), mastodons (//Mammut americanum//) and various species belonging to the genus Dimetrodon. Not counting SCP-ES-072-2.\n\nIt should be added that multiple researchers have agreed that the nature of the SCP-ES-072-2 specimens seems to coincide with the currently obsolete concepts that existed about the appearance and behavior of dinosaurs at the beginning of the 20th century, this hypothesis has not yet been verified.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-es-072/mapa.png|align=left|width=350px|caption=Topographic map of Venus, from Pioneer Venus data, area currently occupied by the anomaly denoted by a circle]]\n\nAlthough the images of Atalanta Planitia provided by the Pioneer Venus probe had given indications of the possible existence of SCP-ES-072 since 1978, its official discovery in its current position was not made until a year later, by a Foundation probe.\n\nIt should be noted that while SCP-ES-072 does not allow gas exchange, solid objects, both organic and inorganic, seem to be perfectly capable of entering or leaving it, although fauna seems to instinctively avoid the limits of SCP-ES-072, apparently favored by the region's slumped relief. It should be added that, according to analysis, the anomaly's area of effect seems to have expanded by 0.3% in the three decades since its discovery.\n\nIt should also be noted that although the appearance of cleared areas in the anomaly had suggested a settlement and in turn a possible civilization inhabiting SCP-ES-072, this has been ruled out due to the extensive lack of evidence, as well as any indication of sophisticated life in general. It is currently believed that these areas may be the product of isolated geographical accidents.\n----\n**ADDENDUM-A: Preliminary Exploration**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS\" hide=\"ACESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-es-072/Estegosaur.png|align=left|width=350px|caption=Most recent image obtained from SCP-ES-072, date ██/██/2005]]\n\nOn █/█/20██, with a single exception to [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1694|SCP-1694]]]'s containment procedures, a proposal to explore SCP-ES-072 in order to obtain samples and better understand its nature was approved. Due to the actively hostile and destructive nature of the anomaly adjacent to SCP-ES-072, approval of the proposal was made under strict security conditions and extreme preventative measures. In order to prevent an XK-Class end-of-the-world scenario in the event of contamination with the adjacent anomaly, preparations for access to SCP-ES-072 were organized and executed at the purpose-built temporary outpost Tonatiuh-III, located on the lunar surface, with the assistance and supervision of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Lunar Area-32]]].\n\nOn █/█/20██ and with the technical collaboration of the In-Situ Area, a traversable Type-09 wormhole was successfully generated, stable enough to allow access to the interior of SCP-ES-072. Initially, an unmanned rover was sent to verify the safety of access, as well as to measure the composition, pressure and temperature of the atmosphere. After a brief exploration of the surrounding area, the gauges verified that both the gravity and the general conditions of the environment, as well as the concentration and composition of the soil samples collected, coincided with those of the terrestrial environment, with minimal variations such as a higher concentration of oxygen in the air. Once the absence of hostile fauna in the vicinity was confirmed, it was decided to explore the vicinity. In a nearby area, what appeared to be the entrance to an apparently uninhabited cave was seen. Due to the steep terrain, it was decided to return the vehicle and carry out a further exploration of the site with a team.\n\n\n> **Date:** █/█/20██\n> \n> **Exploration Team:** D-1589, D-1114\n> \n> **Subject:** SCP-ES-072\n> \n> **Command Leader:** Dr. Arthur Silverwit\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following recording was obtained via a recording device mounted on D-1589's shoulder and was made after the rover confirmed a safe zone. Both D-1589 and D-1114 were briefed on the general nature of the anomaly and provided with backpacks, portable equipment designed for the safe collection and transportation of samples, as well as non-lethal weaponry for self-defense. Subjects are directed remotely by Dr. Silverwit via intercoms. Recording begins immediately after subjects successfully enter SCP-ES-072.\n> ----\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **D-1589:** Alright Doc, we're going in, can you hear me?\n> \n> **Dr. Silverwit:** Roger D-1589, proceed.\n> \n> //The team is in a cleared area, what appears to be the rugged area observed by the rover is about 12 meters away, and the order is given to advance towards the area.//\n> \n> //The team approaches the area, as they get closer, D-1114 points to something on the ground a few meters from the cave entrance.//\n> \n> **D-1114:** Hey, what's that?\n> \n> **D-1589:** Doc, are you seeing this?\n> \n> //D-1114 picks something up from the ground and shakes it, showing the camera what appears to be a severely damaged and deteriorated rifle.//\n> \n> **Dr. Silverwit:** I see it, save it and proceed with caution.\n> \n> **D-1114:** odd, and as soon as we arrived\n> \n> //D-1114 stows the weapon in his backpack and they enter the cave. The cavern extends only a few meters. There are no signs of recent habitation but there are clear signs of human activity, including remnants of firewood and empty cans. At the bottom of the cave the team finds what appears to be a trunk. The order is given to take the items and return.//\n> \n> **D-1589:** Alright doc, we're heading back\n> \n> //D-1589 and D-1114 load the object and begin their return journey. The subjects advance almost halfway when D-1114 stops.//\n> \n> **D-1589:** What's going on?\n> \n> **Dr. Silverwit:** D-1114, report the situation, what is happening?\n> \n> **D-1114:** Didn't you hear it?\n> \n> //The equipped microphones receive nothing initially. After about 30 seconds, sounds of brush and breaking trees are audible from the forest beyond the cave. A flock of unidentified birds flies away, apparently frightened.//\n> \n> **Dr. Silverwit:** Resume your return, immediately.\n> \n> **D-1589:** You heard him, friend, we have to go.\n> \n> **D-1114:** What is that?\n> \n> **Dr. Silverwit:** D-1114, this is a direct order, return now.\n> \n> //The sounds grow louder, as an instance of SCP-ES-072-2, which appears to be a theropod, approximately 6 and a half meters tall, emerges from the undergrowth. The instance notices the subjects' presence and begins to advance towards them.//\n> \n> **D-1589:** RUN!\n> \n> //D-1589 and D-1114 run back towards the portal, while being closely followed by the entity, it should be noted that it seems to show several scars similar to those produced by gunshots. Near the entrance D-1114 momentarily releases the chest and tries to shoot at the animal, the entity seems to ignore the damage without stopping its advance.//\n> \n> **D-1589:** PUT THAT DOWN AND COME IN!\n> \n> //The subjects finally cross the access safely along with the intact cargo. The SCP-ES-072-2 instance is located a few meters away when the portal is finally closed.//\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n> ----\n> The subjects made it back safely with the cargo intact. The recovered rifle was identified as a Mauser M98 model. The degree of damage is consistent with several decades of exposure to the elements. An analysis of the interior of the trunk revealed a rifle of the same model as the one found, which appeared to have been destroyed by crushing force, scant remains of cartridges and ammunition, along with empty supply cans and a notebook. Although the contents were damaged by age, some of them have been recovered (//see ADDENDUM-B//)\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**ADDENDUM-B: Recovered Documents**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS\" hide=\"ACESS GRANTED\"]]\n\nBelow is a partial transcript of the contents of the recovered journal:\n\n> April 9th\n> \n> It won't be long now. We'll call for reinforcements once we arrive. We'll team up with the friendly natives again, they'll surely be happy to join us on our mission. That will put an end to their problem.\n\n> April 11th\n> \n> I am writing during my watch tonight. There are no stars in the sky and the jungle lies in a deathly silence, something strange is in the air, as if a spectre were announcing a bad omen.\n> \n> I noticed many birds of prey on the road, they seem to be going to the same place as us. They are ahead of us, what do they know that we don't.\n> \n> Perhaps it's just delirium from exhaustion. It will be over by tomorrow, when we arrive.\n\n> April 13th\n> \n> Much to my regret, I have often witnessed human baseness surpassing the savagery of beasts. But what we found when we arrived at the village left me speechless. What was not destroyed was burned.\n> \n> They left no survivors.\n> \n> We think of them more as animals at first, but in their abominable genocide lay the unmistakable signature of human perversity. The beasts would have shown more mercy.\n\n> April 15th\n> \n> The death of those people will not have been in vain. If I thought I hated them before, now I myself will take it upon myself to eradicate those apes from this earth.\n\n> April 17th\n> \n> I resort to these notes as a way of giving order to the series of events that occurred after our arrival at the ape-man village.\n> \n> We decided to attack late at night, because we imagined we would catch them sleeping and off guard. How naive of us.\n> \n> Its population, which could hardly have numbered a hundred, lay gathered round an altar, on which was erected an effigy, a female deity with outstretched arms, whose meticulous carving and stature, which I estimate to be about ten feet, gave evidence of the degree of veneration in which they held her, and whose nature reminded me of the fierce Ishtar of the Babylonians. Around this, carved in the ground, was a great eight-pointed star, and at each end a bruised and helpless native, young men and women, stripped of their garments, trembled at the extremities of this symbol.\n> \n> Before I could think, before I knew what to do, it was done. The spilled blood seemed to flow towards the effigy, while that troglodyte who preceded the ceremony howled an incomprehensible gibberish, I could barely get out of my horror to shout the order to my comrades.\n> \n> We annihilated them all, the priest of that profane ritual only needed a shot in the neck. He uttered a stammer to his deity and fell at his feet. From his gestures he seemed to be begging his goddess for salvation, or perhaps revenge.\n> \n> Under other circumstances, I would have felt sorry. We destroyed the statue, the huts and burned the rest.\n> \n> There were no survivors, no stars that night. The distant morning star was our only witness.\n\n> April 18th\n> \n> The tremors have not stopped, the sky has darkened with clouds. We have taken shelter but we will leave as soon as we can, there is nothing left for us here.\n\n> April 20th\n> \n> The last earthquake was the strongest, at times I thought the very bowels of the earth would open up, but the worst came after this.\n> \n> When we reached the edge of the plateau, not only the area where we were, but the entire plateau was no longer above ground level; on the contrary, it was almost as if it had sunk into the rock.\n> \n> Hoyt claims that it is directly related to the earthquake, only a tectonic movement of such monstrosity could have changed the relief in the way it did. Whatever happened, for now, we are stuck.\n\n> April 22\n> \n> The situation has not progressed, we have improvised a shelter but supplies are beginning to run low. We are still trying to figure out a way out, the rock walls that surround us are impossibly steep and seem to rise for hundreds of kilometers, the light comes and goes in a cycle, but without a sun to accompany it. The sky itself is no longer familiar to us.\n> \n> Animals also behave differently, especially the huge beasts. Just yesterday we were attacked by one of those creatures with plates on its back, the first time I saw one it was a peaceful giant, now even the herbivores want to kill us.\n> \n> Lewis says they must be upset about the earthquakes, but I know they're not. They're angry, with us, they know we're to blame for this\n\n> April 25th\n> \n> During our hunt, we attracted some unwanted attention. One of those beasts attacked us. Lewis wasn't fast enough.\n> \n> Today we lost a comrade and I pray to God that his soul rests in peace. We were in a predator's territory, and now he knows of our presence.\n\n> We won't be able to hunt while that monster is out there, fortunately we still have plenty of ammunition left. Young Edward and Hoyt have gathered their courage and have gone out to hunt the animal, they haven't allowed me to accompany them, my wounds barely let me move.\n\n> My companions have not returned and I have no hope that they will.\n> \n> I can feel it lurking out there, I'll grab the gun and all the ammo I can carry, with the last of my strength I'll kill the beast or die trying. I won't wait for death to pity me in this cave.\n> \n> Maybe their god did avenge them, maybe mine has abandoned me, but I don't need their judgment, I will do justice to myself.\n> \n> May heaven have mercy on our souls.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**ADDENDUM-C: Event ES-072/A**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS\" hide=\"ACESS GRANTED\"]]\n\nOn 08/08/2018, Foundation satellites detected a series of flares from Skadi Mons[[footnote]]The highest point of Venus, 10,700 meters high, located in the center of Ishtar Terra[[/footnote]]. The mountain in question gave no indication of any unusual activity before or after the event. The phenomenon showed some similarity to the so-called Ashen lights except for a greater intensity. The flashes occurred in a pattern later identified as Morse code. The following message was decoded by repeating itself on a loop for the 2 hours and 42 minutes that the event lasted. The punctuation and spelling remain exact.\n\n[[=]]\n> STAND AWAY FROM THE GARDEN. EDEN DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU. NO MORE. NEVER AGAIN. CONDEMNED RACE.

BEFORE YOURS IT WILL BE ASHES.\n[[/=]]\n\nTo date, no similar events have been reported and no communication attempts have been answered. In order to avoid a possible risk to the anomaly itself, containment protocols have been updated. Skadi Mons has been flagged as a possible area of interest and is currently under observation.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Jacobo Baltimore]]\n> **Filename:** Image 1\n> **Author:** [[*user Jacobo Baltimore]]\n> **License:** CC-by-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n\n> **Name:** Foto de Venera 9 (cropped)\n> **Author:** Ted Stryk\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Foto_de_Venera_9_(cropped).png]]]\n\n> **Name:** T. rex old posture\n> **Author:** Charles Robert\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:T._rex_old_posture.jpg]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Image 2\n> **Name:** Map of Venus\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Venus.png]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Image 3\n> **Author:** [[*user Jacobo Baltimore]]\n> **License:** CC-by-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n\n> **Name:** Huygens surface color sr\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Huygens_surface_color_sr.jpg]]]\n\n> **Name:** Stego\n> **Author:** Charles Robert\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stego.jpg]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
