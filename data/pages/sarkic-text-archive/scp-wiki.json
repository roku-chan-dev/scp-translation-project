What we have learned has revealed a diverse and shifting paradigm far different from the monolithic creed that was first hypothesized. We are now able to paint a broader, more detailed picture of the Nälkä religion, its various sects and cultural traditions.\n> \n> Modern sects are the product of divergent interpretations, many bearing a mere superficial resemblance to their ancient progenitor cult. Most unexpected, especially among early scholars of Sarkicism such as myself, are the seemingly benevolent intentions of its founders. The road to hell, it is often said, is paved with good intentions - an aphorism the Foundation must always keep close in mind, for despite the aeons between us, we gaze into that very same abyss.\n> \n> And like the ancient Adytites, we have found it full of monsters.\n> \n> Thanks to the tireless work of Dr. Virtanen, we can further expand our knowledge of the Sarkite culture and practices, so that they never become a threat again.\n> \n> - Dr. Judith Low, Senior Advisor at the Department of History - Religious GoI Threat Analysis\n\n+ FOREWORD\n\n-----\n\nThis document is a compilation of non-cognitohazardous Sarkite texts, acquired and archived as part of the Sarkic Text Archive Project, in collaboration between the Department of Tactical Theology and the Department of History. \n\nThe purpose of the STAP is to help foundation personnel dealing with Sarkic communities and anomalies in understanding the cultural and religious practices of the various Sarkic sects, as well as possible threats and ways of engagement. The archive can be found below, with excerpts of contained texts. Access to full text can be granted upon request.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ Words of Law\n\n**DENOMINATION:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/an-anthropological-approach-to-sarkicism-case-study-02-the-d Divoši of Prague]\n**ORIGIN:** Collection of Divoši scripture, provided per the 1945 Prague agreement.\n**DATE OF ORIGIN:** 11th century\n**LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN:** Late Adytite\n\n\n> These be the words spoken by the Greatest of Sages, Nadox \n> \n> \n> Look amongst thyself, do you see righteous men? I tell you not, though you have been chosen to be such.\n> \n> \n> For a righteous man comes not from nought, but from the seed of saints and warriors.\n> So I tell three; thou shalt behave, as thou are destine to!\n> \n> \n> Thou shalt aschew decadance, in all its forms. Give ye to hope and not to excess. If ye have naught but hope, it shal obtain all good things for you. But if ye have one pound in excess, it  shall take all you have and thrice as much.\n> \n> \n> Thou shalt awaken your senses, pry wide thy third eye; thou shalt not inabriate thyself. For if your two eyes are blinded, thine third shall be barred from sight as well. If ye drink the poison of the tyrants, thine senses shall perish. When all ye have ears, noses, eyes and tongues and skin in abundance, ye shall turn your gaze inward and sideward.\n> \n> \n> Thou shalt not see yourself a superior, a master or a monarch, but as a teacher of the masses. If amongst ye walks a false one who does not teach but says 'I am a master, i wear the crowns of man', ye must tear apart him with your hands and remake his flesh and canckers, for they have gone askew.\n> \n> \n> Thou shall consume flesh raw, touched by neither luxury nor flame. For such were the meals of tyrants, divorced from their root and poisoned by the gods\n> \n> \n> And most important of all, honor thy Prophet, the Devourer of sins and tyrants. Don't speak his, nor his disciples name in vain.\n> \n> \n> Now go, enforce the jaka. For as the tyrants of the spirit exist, their impurity will corrupt our flesh. Cull them, and lead the pure into paradise!\n> \n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** Used by members of the Divoši as a basis for a system of internal law, applicable to all Sarkites under the denomination\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ Kiraak of the Endless Maw: A Guide!\n\n**DENOMINATION:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ancestrecall Abraxas Group]\n**ORIGIN:** Abraxas Arms facility, Norilsk, Russia\n**DATE OF ORIGIN:** 2017\n**LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN:** Russian\n\n\n> The Elders gathered around at the end of the day to discuss the current situation of the village, its inhabitants and its plight. This meeting was no less tense then those of the last ten nights had been. Someone had been sneaking poison into the settlement's meat farm. Before their time was due, countless organ-fruits turned green, yellow and black with mold and decay.\n> \n> \n> The council spoke with great haste and fury, for the sickness of evil rot came with the sickness of hunger. \"Close the village to all but Nälkä\", one suggested. Another suggested the creation of a second farm,  but the inhabitants had already grown to weak for such rituals. Then, another, suggested to start a hunt. \"Tell the villagers to find whoever amongst them has been hurting the farm, then bring them to justice\".\n> \n> \n> But then, a great anger seized the others, to the expectation of every true Nälkän and to the surprise of the speaker. \"You dare us to rise cancer and polyp against your kin? Have the worms of the ancestors forsaken your brain?\" And one sprang forth and their  claws tore away the robe and all saw the brand of shame, which was known to all wise seekers in the olden day:\n> \n> \n> The rune of the Scarlet Archon.\n> \n> \n> Having found the one responsible for their people's troubles, they butchered him, but refused to allow him to die. His mouth, they melded away, so it would never deceive again. But his stomach became the king of want, torn open maw, crowned by ribcage-teeth, snapping, gnashing, wailing, never full and always hungry. And eat, it would! The rotten meat of the farm, the fruit of his betrayal, would be forced into it. Soon, his body began to mold itself into an ever more useful form, more beloved and needed than the old chance he had wasted.\n> \n> \n> And to this day, he continues to serve such purpose. For, our dear employee, where do you think the byproducts of our inventions go? Don't worry, our Kiraak won't bite, provided you remember to dispose your trash on time!\n> \n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** Recovered by a foundation spy embedded in the Abraxas Group.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ Untitled Solomonari Text \n**DENOMINATION:** Solomonari\n**ORIGIN:** Romania, archives of the Anomalous Division of the State Security Department; thought to pertain to isolated Sarkic communities within the Carpathian mountains, possibly in the Bucegi area, which is known to be a hotspot for anomalous activity.[[footnote]] As part of the Romanian nuclear program, the Romanian government built a series of underground testing facilities throughout the Southern Carpathians, leading to the discovery of a sprawling network of ancient tunnels, used by the Dacian Sarkites as a place of refuge against religious persecution. Contact with a local Solomonari sect would be established shortly following this discovery, with the Romanian government granting autonomy and protection to the community in exchange for Sarkic aid in chemical and biological millitary projects. Contacts between Nicolae Ceaușescu, the leading Romanian communist at the time, and the Solomonari groups are presumed to be the cause of Ceaușescu's slow aging throught his rule. Knowledge of the existence of Solomonari cults by the Romanian communist government prior to this discovery is currently under debate, as the Anomalous Division of the Romanian People's Army was established 4 years prior, while statements from the inhabitants of villages connected to SCP-2191 indicate a degree of government involvement in local sacrifices. Analysis of Romanian propaganda during said period indicates a clear shift towards a strong emphasis of Dacian ancestry, with the discovery of multiple ancient Dacian artefacts, propaganda movies related to ancient Dacia and comparisons of Nicolae Ceaușescu to ancient Dacian leaders by state propaganda. Further study recommended. [[/footnote]]\n**DATE OF ORIGIN:** 1953\n**LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN:** Dacian[[footnote]] A nearly extinct language, with close to 80 native speakers. It is most similar to proto-Albanian, albeit with strong Uralic influences and Romance loanwords for modern technology. [[/footnote]]\n\n> Spears! How delicate is the art of their mastery. How swiftly they cut through the wind! And the wind is howling. The wolves howl, they’re wailing, their prayers reach the heavens. They cry out for blood. \n> \n> \n> Death to tyrants! Death to those who wish to extinguish the flame of Ion, the torch of the Promethean spirit. As such were the Mekhanites, as such were the Romans, and as such unto the neo-Deavite death-worshippers and bandits[[footnote]] Likely reference to the Iron Guard, a fascist paramilitary organization in 1930s Romania organized as a medieval knightly order. Their ennoblement of poverty, ecclesiastic nature and borderline 'worship' of death earned them the ire of the Sarkites and Romanian society. After the Second World War, Guardist ('Legionary') partisans took up arms against the Communist regime, pockets of resistance often being strongest in isolated rural communities and forests throughout the Carpathian Mountains. The extent of the conflict between Sarkic communities and Legionaries is currently unknown. [[/footnote]]. Long live life! Death to the enemies of life!\n> \n> \n> Watch, watch! Behold, a man! Or are they a woman? Ah! Get past it, get past it, how little it matters! All are equal in the Family, for we are one! The bodies melt, they meld and come apart, then shed a thousand flakes and merge with each other again in a kindling of passion. \n> \n> \n> A formation! Phalanxes march forth. A symphony of a thousand living knives, a thousand spears, a thousand pikes! A procession, a hurried procession! Lead it, lead it, Karcist Deceneus[[footnote]] The name of the eldest and most skilled Solomonari Karcist and carnomancer has stayed the same throughout history, thus indicating that Deceneus is either a single individual that is thousands of years old, or that it's a title of a possibly hereditary nature. [[/footnote]]! Climb upon the stone, the Sphinx[[footnote]] A natural rock formation in the Bucegi mountains resembling a human face. The site of many a neo-pagan ritual and a proposed location of the holiest place of the Dacian Solomonari subbranch, Mount Kogaion. [[/footnote]], the sacred rock! The man, the woman, their Son! Carry them off by the limbs! The procession halts, it waits for the phalanx to arrive. Throw them! Thump, thump!\n> \n> \n> Gnash! The tearing of flesh, the exhumation of rot! Scarlet and pink mangled, married into a most joyful dance! Apotheosis! They carve a path through the skies, they caress the clouds, they witness Gebeleizis[[footnote]] The Dacian God of the sky, thunder and lighting. [[/footnote]]. \n> \n> \n> Red. Watch it flow in the wind! Watch it pour out, watch it mingle with the mud and purify it of sin. Rejoice, brothers! Blessed is he who martyrs himself, blessed is he who dies a glorious death, for he shall not perish, but his spirit will persevere in the realm of Zalmoxis[[footnote]] The principal god of the Dacians. His story of  Greek-birthed mysticism, emancipation, earned Godhood and resurrection draws stark parallels to both Mekhanite and Christian theology, as well as to Grand Karcist Ion's life. Attempted explanations hold the deity to be a vulgarized, deified version of Ion, akin to 'Saint John' of Polish pseudo-Sarkic sects. [[/footnote]]. \n> \n> \n> Drink, drink! Alcohol is the common man’s drink! Drink to their resurrection, for they are as Zalmoxis was and as Ion shall be! Exaltation, exaltation! Be merry! \n>\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** The above text is widely considered to be an indigenous description of a Solomonari human sacrifice, a tradition which has remained relatively unchanged from previous, pagan and non-anomalous descriptions present in ancient sources. [[footnote]] Excluding flesh manipulation.

Their blindfold is to be removed after setting the bonfire alight. \n> \n> \n> \"I, a member of the impure blood, proclaim myself unworthy of the gift of the eternal life, of the gift of our Great Táltos! For I am weak, corrupt and of rigid form!\"\n> \n> \n> The Orin steps towards the bonfire.\n> \n> \n> \"May this blood be damned, consumed in the fire, for I accept the rite of the pure blood!\"\n> \n> \n> The Orin opens their arms and takes off their robe as the Táltos carves the Seal of Ion into their back. The Orin is to remain silent until the rune is complete.\n> \n> \n> \"May this body be damned\"\n> \"May this flesh be damned\"\n> \"May this life be damned!\"\n> \n> \n> The Orin is given the ritual dagger by the Táltos and instructed to slit their wrists before stepping into the bonfire.\n> \n> \n> \"As Ördög's flames lifted the Great Táltos into the sky, showed him Isten and the way of all life, may this fire burn me into a god\"\n> \n> \n> The Orin is to remain in the bonfire until they collapse, at which point they are removed by the Táltos and treated to their injuries. Should they collapse before reciting the pledge or show excessive hesitancy prior to the ritual, they are to be left inside the fire. Their blood is to be replaced with that of the Èletfa.\n> \n\n**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** The sections in quotes are presumed to be recited during a ritual intiating members into the Zend position after they have learned the theology and rituals of the cult. Likely reserved for members of non-Sarkic bloodlines.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n+ Prayer For Samādhi That is to Come\n\n**DENOMINATION:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2833 Vātula]\n**ORIGIN:** Recovered in 1967 from a buried library containing various pieces of ancient hindu scripture from extinct and minor sects. \n**DATE OF ORIGIN:** 3rd century BCE\n**LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN:** Sanskrit\n\n> We desire neither land or gold, nor a freedom from birth and death\n> \n> \n> Come, Samādhi[[footnote]]Typically refers to the grave of a saint[[/footnote]], we wait for your returnn\n> Come, Samādhi, we wait for your return\n> Come, Samādhi, we wait for Sharabha[[footnote]] Avatar of the Hindu god \"Shiva\", a deity responsible for creation and destruction.
