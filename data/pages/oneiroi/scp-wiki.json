We are the collective (un)consciousness of everyone and everything that chooses to join us. You could say we’re a hivemind, a dreamscape, an egregore, or whatever eases your confusion when faced with something so remarkably //not// something.\n\nEveryone owns the Oneiroi collective! Or no one? Honestly, if you care so much, why don't you find out for yourself?\n\nA myriad of merged consciousnesses means the dreamscape can manifest in infinite ways. The most common format our users enjoy appears to be a reproduction of familiar media outlets such as websites, books, shows, and occasionally art. But, however you choose to envision your experience with the Collective, we totally support you! Just make sure it's collective-consciousness compatible; we don't need a repeat of The Incident.\n\nOneiroi is everywhere and everything, but also no where, and no thing... so here’s a list of some popular states of being within the Collective:\n\n* The Parliament's smallest women's bathroom\n* The box you keep your seasonal decorations in\n* You know that road you always pass by and think, 'I wonder where that leads to?' Well, if you had an ounce of adventurer in you and figured out where that road actually fucking went? Then there.\n* Your mother\n* Every other signpost, and the ones in between\n* In people with the mystical ability to solidify others using only a toothbrush and are quick to anger\n* You!\n\nAlready raring to try it out? Wait no more! If all of this sounds like the best day ever, then it can be all yours; call 1 (800) JOIN PLZ to be connected with the nearest entry point.\n\n[[div class=\"cloudbox\"]]\n**Oneiroi West -** The largest of all dream hubs, with the most varied of dreamers including but not limited to: visitors, dreaming humans and pure Oneiroi who have long abandoned their physical selves. Commonly abbreviated to OW, it is considered the most favourable dream hub to live in. The only downside is that those connected to the grand consciousness of OW (the collected consciousness of everyone in OW, an entity within itself) are rendered incapable of death. This is a problem, considering most get bored of immortality.\n\n**Oneiroi Collective -** A mystery to many, the collective is believed to consist mainly of flora and fauna native to Earth. Any Oneiroi that attempts to join the collection is either never heard from again or returns as a conglomeration far from who they used to be. Because of this phenomenon, not much is known about this dream hub.\n\n**Dreamers -** The avatar of oneself. What one might consider their dream self, their subconscious given form. When one visits or joins a dream hub, this self is what you would use to represent you; it may not look anything like your physical form; it may be an exact copy, it is what you choose (or don't choose) to be. A Dreamer is the collective and the individual, both the society of dreamers and the individual dreamer. Every wanderer is a world unto themselves.\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"dreamlist\"]]\n[[div class=\"or-comment\" style=\"--pfp: url(https://smlt.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:luxaiko:oneiroi-hub/Portrait)\"]]\n**Formats**\n\nHow many dreamers does it take to change a lightbulb?\n \n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"_oneiroi\" order=\"created_at\" prependLine=\"||~ Here ||~ Rating ||~ Created ||~ Length ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%created_at%% || %%size%% ||\n[[/module]]\n[[span]]**Upvote Reply +999999** - Sometime ago[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"or-comment\" style=\"--pfp: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/oneiroi/Portrait.png)\"]]\n**Visions**\n\nI think three moons is a bit much; back in my day there were only two!\n \n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"oneiroi -_oneiroi\" order=\"created_at\" prependLine=\"||~ Here ||~ Rating ||~ Created ||~ Length ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%created_at%% || %%size%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[span]]**Upvote Reply -999999** - Never[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"or-comment\" style=\"--pfp: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/oneiroi/Portrait.png)\"]]\n**Foreign Intermissions**\n\nThe sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to the soul.\n \n||~ Here ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-403-fr SCP-403-FR] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/amamiel-s-proposal amamiel's Proposal] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1866-jp SCP-1866-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/aeliana #Aeliana] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1876-jp SCP-1876-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1305-jp SCP-1305-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/foundation-collective-hub Foundation Collective Hub] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1936-jp SCP-1936-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2170-jp SCP-2170-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/purple-hub PURPLE HUB] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2507-jp SCP-2507-JP] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-14-1 Dreaming with Elli, Part 1] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-14-2 Dreaming with Elli, Part 2] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-14-3 Dreaming with Elli, Part 3] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/somnovacuidad Somnovacuity] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/sabbath Sabbath] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/idolatry Idolatry] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-steppe-the-horseman-and-the-dreamer The Steppe, the Horseman and the Dreamer] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/sleepless-walkers Sleepless Walkers] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/portraits Portraits] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/umbral Umbral] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/dim-dreams Dim Dreams] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/temperance Temperance] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-650-ko SCP-650-KO] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/corpse-night-dream Then, At Dawn, Dreamcorpse Was] ||\n|| [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/ein-seltsamer-tagtraum-so-suess-wie-gift A Strange Daydream As Sweet As Poison]||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/habi-s-soup Habi's Soup] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-kings-we-d-be the kings we'd be] ||\n|| [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/sublime-limelight Sublime Limelight] ||\n\n[[span]]**Upvote Reply +2** - Now[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Would You Like To Learn More?\" hide=\"eroM nraeL oT ekiL uoY dluoW\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab Writing for Oneiroi]]\n\nThere aren't any rules, but I wish to clarify a few points for those who don't know where to start!\n\nThe Oneiroi format uses social media outlets as one of many ways to represent a dreamer's consciousness. Therefore, it is entirely open for interpretation. Want a newspaper, a transcription of events, etc? Then do it! Think outside of the box.\n\nThere are no rules on who does or doesn't own Oneiroi or whether no one does. If you feel like that's the best course of action for your story, do it. This is your chance to use an infinite number of settings for whatever crazy idea you want to pull off next.\n\nI wish only the best for your writing, have fun!\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tech Fun]]\n\nLike [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:cosmonaut the theme of this page]?
