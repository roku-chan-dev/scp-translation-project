Groundhogs are extinct; six more weeks of bullshit.\n\nThis is Dr. Sylvia Tanner, and I was voluntarily buried alive in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6502 Harwick] 550 years ago. I got used to it more quickly than I expected. Certainly helps that the coffin was reinforced, fitted with preserving machinery, and most of the flora and fauna that could come in here and help with decomposition have been turned into slime with the rest.\n\nThing is, I needed a way to stay alive for a very long time. And I've found a way to do so using the parameters of SCP-6502:\n\n# Fortify the perimeter of [[[SCP-6502]]] with automated security systems.\n# Have my staff bury me alive in Harwick.\n# Wake up in extreme agony.\n# Spend a few decades reminding myself of the plan and getting the weepy bits out of my system.\n# Get over it and keep going.\n# Communicate with my staff to finish the design for the //Long Cónra.//\n# While still maintaining a six-foot radius of dirt around my coffin in all directions, have my body excavated and fitted in the chassis of the //Long Cónra.//\n# Congratulations! You're now piloting a high-powered tank designed to clear out slime while keeping its occupant immortal and surrounded with grave dirt.\n\nThus began my personal five-century war against what was left of muticellular life on my planet.\n\n...\n\nNow, here's the tricky bit. I'm in the center of a 50-kilometer radius that's completely free of the Jell-O from hell. My weapons systems have all decayed over time and are now useless. And everyone who could fix them has either left Earth or died. Only my movement system seems to work anymore. Because it's //solar//-powered.\n\n//(Sardonic chuckle.)//\n\n...\n\nIf I had to say what fucks me up the most about daybreak, to this day, it's that while it started, I was on the phone with its instigator. Half the time I was in that stupid casket, I was thinking about all the ways I could have stopped him. What I could have said. \n\nAll useless conjecture. Hindsight 20/20.\n\n//(Sigh.)//\n\nI think I'm starting to understand Kent's mindset. Thanks to what I couldn't stop, I've got a school bus in a lake of my very own. Though it can't hold a candle to what he must have been feeling ever since this started up -- if he's even aware.\n\nSo, here's the //new// plan, what I'll call Operation [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQpY1zTZguY Mr. Bellamy]... \n\n# Drag this tank 20 klicks northeast to what's left of Site-59.\n# Find that teleportation-based Thaumiel from 2024. I'll remember the name when I see it.\n# Teleport this stupid tank into the \"scale chamber\" in SauEl.\n# Hold the mother of all mental health interventions with the man in the sun.\n\n...nothing ventured, nothing gained, but something tells me the best-case scenario still involves my death. Joke's on you, Kent -- I'm done anyway.\n\nIf you're hearing this, then either I've won, or the slime have evolved to the point where they can understand human speech. If it's the latter... you know what? Good for you. Maybe you can figure out how to keep this world sane better than your forefathers could.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #FF0000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n\n+++ Project Mr. Bellamy - 2nd entry\n\n**Tanner:** Log date: February 3rd, 2598. \n\n...\n\nTeleporter... worked like a charm.

Get it together. I'm in orbit. I can just stay here.

Passed Mercury's orbit last month.\n\n//(Laughs deliriously)//\n\nI have been alive waaaaay toooo loooong.\n\n...\n\nWhat was I doing again?\n\n//Sun,// right.

I'm about to be a thin layer of barbecue sauce orbiting the sun for eternity. If by chance some space aliens or something find this recording in the drifting debris, please know that I'm truly sorry for how off-color I was getting in log number 503.

Hates the law and the government to the point of obsession. Boards his windows, keeps 50 guns, has a bunch of \"We don't call police\" signs. Currently owes $853,000 in debt to Bank of America he never intends to pay -- he thinks he can lawsuit it all out of the  way when he needs to.\n \nHe just got finished painting his house with lead paint all over. Stubborn motherfucker. He heard that lead paint was made illegal, but //noooo//, no self-important g-man is gonna take away his right to poison himself. So he sits in his den and sniffs them sweet, sweet fumes.\n\nSuddenly, he gets a weird, shrieky notification on his phone. Something about ballistic missiles and seeking shelter immediately. In a matter of minutes, the whole rest of the world is covered in nuclear fire that leaves the rest of the world uninhabitable.\n\nBut goddammit, Mr. Bellamy's lead paint was tough stuff -- the toxic flames passed him over like there was lamb's blood over his door.\n\nAt the same time, Asteroid number ABC123 or whatever slams into Antarctica, dousing the flames -- but also putting the whole world underwater, wiping out whoever survived the nuclear war.\n\nBut guess what? The paint was also waterproof, keeping Mr. Bellamy safe until his air runs out -- just kidding! His chimney's so high that it peeks over the water line, and he's also packed up enough canned beans and water in his basement to last him 70 years.\n\nSo, with all that in mind: given a 10% compound interest rate, how much will he owe the bank in 10 years?\n\n**SCP-7941-A:** ##red|...##\n\n**Tanner:** ...\n\n**SCP-7941-A:** ##red|...##\n\n**Tanner:** ...\n\n**SCP-7941-A:** ,,##red|...heh.##,,\n\n**Tanner:** There, see?
