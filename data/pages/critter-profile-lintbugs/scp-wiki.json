Polyester only as treats.\n\n**Housed:** Wilson's Wildlife Center, Laundry Room (Dryers)\n\n[[size 75%]]//Image edited on 11/15/2022//[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nCreature Features!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nLintbugs are unique insects! For one, despite being made out of completely inanimate material, they are alive! And, second, they're in almost every household on Earth, and yet only us and the Supervisors know about them!\n\nThese furry creatures form when certain textiles are worn down; although, \"lintbugs\" is actually the general name given to a clump of different insects from the genus //Textimmobesus//! Cotton, wool, and polyester are most susceptible to creating them, but other fabrics can, too! Theoretically, there's a species of lint for every kind of textile ever created! //T. gossipyum, T. lana,// and //T. polyestera// make up a majority of the lintbug population, while //T. sericum// (silk) and other species are considerably more rare.\n\nOnce they form, they don't move and mostly focus on eating the fabric around them. They depend on humans like us to carry them around! Why do they wanna move around? To combine with their siblings! Lintbugs evolved to try and form the biggest clump they can with each other because that gives them the best chance at survival! These big balls are a sort of hive-mind, and require special care to feed and look after.\n\nOur current lot of lintbugs weigh almost 5 lbs! The big ones are stored in special enclosures while the small ones are placed in communal pens in the laundry room. These little bugs unfortunately don't last very long, and often get lost! But, as long as we keep collecting and combining them, their species will live on!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[=image lintbugs1.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]//Newborn lintbugs!//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nTechnically, these creatures have existed since the first textiles were made over 27,000 years ago! However, they only saw a population boom with the Industrial Revolution 200 years ago. Fascinating how they grew as us humans grew, too!\n\nThe Supervisors only recently found out about their existence, and they tasked us to take care of a small sample for their studies! Also, the Supervisors don't really worry about hiding their existence, since lintbugs don't do much but sit around all day. Plus, how would they get rid of them anyway?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nMake sure to empty the dryer's lint screen regularly! You can find hundreds of lintbugs in there, and as cute as they are, your dryer wonâ€™t work as well if too many accumulate. Plus, that means more lint buddies!\n\nIf you find them on your clothes or the furniture, just use a lint roller or a fabric shaver, that'll get them right off!\n\nEvery six months, the Supervisors will come by to take our current stock of lintbugs so they can redistribute them into the world. The larger lintbugs are kinda hard to take care of, so this is for their sake as much as it is for ours!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about lintbugs!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nLintbugs love polyester for some reason! However, make sure to only give them it as a treat, polyester is not very nutritious for them as it's completely synthetic.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jaden Atkins\nRecipient(s): ALL STAFF\nDate: 7/21/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nDear everyone,\n\nPlease remember to clean the lint screens in the dryers! I found a cake of them in one of the dryers, and we don't want all the lintbugs to get hurt or something! Plus, taking apart the larger clumps can be very traumatizing for the bugs. Otherwise, we'd have to feed them a lot more fabric if we kept them together! Thanks.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Sophia Hopkins\nRecipient(s): Jaden Atkins\nDate: 9/3/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, Jaden,\n\nSome of the dryers in the laundry room aren't drying very well. It takes two cycles to even dry some towels. Could you get the mechanics to take a look?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jaden Atkins\nRecipient(s): Sophia Hopkins\nDate: 9/6/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThey found this in the dryers. Not good.\n\n[[=image dryer1.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n\nNot only are there a bunch of little critters not taken into account, they also took out the vent pipe. Look at this.\n\n[[=image dryer2.jpg width=\"300px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n\nWe caught it early, but this could've been disastrous for the little guys. It took a lot of polyester to calm them down. I'll send out another email with the images, but you guys have got to start cleaning out the lint screens before it gets worse. I know it's really hard to remember, especially with the crazy animals we take care of, but please, just clean the lint screen.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Sophia Hopkins\nRecipient(s): Jaden Atkins\nDate: 9/6/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nWill do.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jaden Atkins\nRecipient(s): ALL STAFF\nDate: 11/14/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nGUYS THE LAUNDRY ROOM\n\n[[=image fire.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jaden Atkins\nRecipient(s): ALL STAFF\nDate: 11/15/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThe Supervisors pulled this out of the wreckage.\n\n[[=image burnt.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n\nThe building was a near total loss. Thankfully, none of the animals in the enclosures (or any of us) were hurt. Unfortunately, all the lintbugs in that building were lost. I managed to save one clump. It's the last of its kind here, until we can get more. I've already updated the lintbugs documentation with a picture of it. It's the least we could do for it.\n\nClean the lint screens, please.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/lintbugs2.jpg lintbugs2.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/33013386591/ Conair Fabric Shaver]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/ Emily May]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/33013386591\n\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/lintbugs1.jpg lintbugs1.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/33013391791/ Conair Fabric Shaver]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/ Emily May]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/emilysnuffer/33013391791\n\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/dryer1.jpg dryer1.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/mvtroiano/8052504491/ 19+ YEARS OF DRYER ABUSE]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/mvtroiano/ mike troiano]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/mvtroiano/8052504491\n\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/dryer2.jpg dryer2.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/51124570991/ While I prefer home automation projects..]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/ Lars Plougmann]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/criminalintent/51124570991\n\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/fire.jpg fire.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/albert_straub/16873761888 HouseFire]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/albert_straub/ Albert Straub]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/albert_straub/16873761888\n\n> **Filename:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-lintbugs/burnt.jpg burnt.jpg]\n> **Name:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/78897321@N00/8884349050 This is what happens when a dryer attempts to recreate the Hindenburg! #dryer #fire #appliance #burn #scorch #scary #siouxfalls #southdakota]\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/jerry7171/ Jerry]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/78897321@N00/8884349050\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
