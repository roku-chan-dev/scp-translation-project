So why aren't we all dead?\n\nWell, when gatherings festive chant carols diverse,\nWhen those bright young eyes plead for their favourite verse,\nJust be thankful we found where the hunter endured\nAnd are writing these poems to keep it secured.\nAnd we'll hear you exclaim, in a tone of respect:\n\"Merry Christmas to all who contain and protect!\"\n\n----\n\n**Date:**  2017-04-14\n**Comments:** We haven't made any attempt to contain it in almost a year.
