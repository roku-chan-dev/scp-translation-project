Upon decomposition, all instances were disposed of in the garbage disposal incineration unit.\n>\n**Description:** SCP-6009-J were 30 instances of sentient cucumbers (//Cucumis sativus//) that vocalized upon being consumed by a human subject. These vocalizations were sexually explicit and typically voraphilic in nature. The SCP-6009-J were capable of these vocalizations despite lacking internal biology capable of speech. SCP-6009-J had identical composition to baseline cucumbers aside from a mouth hole and discoloration of the skin made to resemble eyes.\n>\n**Discovery:** On 26/8/2019, the Foundation received reports of talking vegetables harassing civilians. All 30 instances of SCP-6009-J were discovered on a vegetable stand in the Long Island Farmer's Market. The sign on the stand had \"Succulent Cucumbers\" written in bold letters. The search for the person(s) responsible for the stand proved inconclusive. Upon discovery, the SCP-6009-J instances showed no anomalous properties until Field Agent William Morris attempted to consume one of the instances. The SCP-6009-J vocalized a moaning sound followed by the phrase, \"Radish me, daddy\". All SCP-6009-J instances were brought to Site-101 for containment and study.\n>\n**Test Log:**\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Researcher:** Dr. Lizen\n\n**Subject:** D-K7603\n\n**Foreword:** D-K7603 is to consume an instance of SCP-6009-J.\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Lizen:** Proceed D-K7603, please eat the cucumber.\n\n**D-K7603:** What, that's it?

The instance explodes against the wall.]//\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** The remaining instances were kept in Refrigeration Unit 5 until reaching an advanced state of decomposition, at which time the remains were incinerated. No further testing was attempted.\n[[/div]]",
