SCP-137 is to be fed three meals a day. Under no circumstances are any toys allowed to come within five hundred (500) meters of SCP-137.\n\n**Description:** SCP-137 is an entity with the ability to possess a toy, gaining the physical properties, size, and shape of whatever it represents; for example, a teddy bear will become an actual bear, and behave accordingly. SCP-137 cannot possess any miscellaneous object, only toys. The observed range of SCP-137's possessive effect is two hundred fifty (250) meters, but until further testing has been accomplished, SCP-137 is assumed to have a maximum range of five hundred (500) meters from its position.\n\nSCP-137 was first brought to Foundation attention after a series of bizarre deaths and incidents involving children. The deaths were determined to be too random to be a serial killer, and Foundation agents were sent in to investigate. It was located after an interview with a young girl suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, after a naked man had appeared in her bedroom. It was encountered in the same neighborhood in the form of a gorilla. SCP-137 was then tracked and finally captured when it possessed a stuffed pony doll in █████, ████, and was chased into the nearby wilderness. SCP-137 was tranquilized, and extracted to Site-19 by helicopter. \n\nTesting has shown that SCP-137 takes on the characteristics of the toy it possesses, but only as a child might perceive it.  A toy soldier becomes a violent, well-armed man.  A toy gun fires bullets.  A toy lion attacks and kills humans.  However, it lacks true intelligence.  It shows no sign of long-term memory, nor any capacity for learning or abstract thinking (See Interview 137-1).  For more information, please refer to [[[Experiment Log 137]]].\n\nIt is currently inhabiting a princess doll, of the ████████ ██████ line.\n\n**Addendum** \n**Interview 137-1:**\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-137\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. █████\n\n**Foreword:** Interview took place to determine what SCP-137 is, and why and how it possesses toys.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//Dr. █████:// Good day.\n\n//SCP-137:// Hello!  I'm Princess Blossom. Are you my prince?\n\n//Dr. █████:// No.  Now, can you please tell me what you are?\n\n//SCP-137:// I am a princess!  I am the prettiest princess in the whole world!\n\n//Dr. █████:// Where did you come from?\n\n//SCP-137:// I live in a castle.  Are you my prince?\n\n*Further questioning yielded similar results.*\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-136]]] | SCP-137 | [[[SCP-138]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box author=DrEverettMann and Arlecchino]]\n> **Filename:** princess1.png\n> **Name:** Princess Rajwa Al Hussein2.png\n> **Author:** الحقيقة الدولية\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** [//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:princess_Rajwa_Al_Hussein2.png Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
