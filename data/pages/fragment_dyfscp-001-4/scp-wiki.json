  "content": "+ 4/8048 Clearance Accepted. Welcome, Dr. Naismith.\n\n**Item:** SCP-8048\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8048 is kept in Warehouse 9 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Due to the ongoing investigation, a means to open the bulkhead and examine SCP-8048's contents must be discovered as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8048 is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 m shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.\n\nThe interior can only be accessed through a fortified bulkhead at one end. Though the words \"SCP-001\" have been written on the side in black paint, there is no evidence of any connection between SCP-8048 and SCP-001.\n\n**Recovery:** SCP-8048 was discovered under a mound of earth and snow near the northern border of Lapland, Finland. Local Sami legends have attested to its existence since ancient times, claiming that it was the home of an old and powerful sorcerer. Shortly after excavation, the soil directly above SCP-8048 has been dated to at least 9,000 BCE.\n\nPrior to recovery, a narrow, winding tunnel through the mound led from the door to the outside. The tunnel bore significant wear from having been used as a footpath. Other than that, there has been no conclusive evidence that anyone has entered or exited the door before recovery.\n\n**Addendum - PoI-8048:** During the initial excavation on April 12th, 1993, SCP-8048's bulkhead opened. PoI-8048 exited the object and snapped his fingers, which closed the door behind him. (Attempts by Foundation personnel to open the door with finger-snapping have been unsuccessful.)\n\nPoI-8048 is a 32-year-old man of French Canadian descent who answers to the name Dr. Laurence Michaud. He has made multiple outlandish claims about himself and SCP-8048, including but not limited to:\n\n* SCP-8048 is a time machine.\n* He held the office of O5-11 in the year 3030 from an alternate timeline.\n* Said timeline experienced a \"modified\" ΩK-Class End-of-Death scenario that coincided with the invasion of a Tiamat-class anomaly known as SCP-UBU.\n* SCP-UBU was an extremely dangerous and sadistic entity who was capable of, among other things, neutralizing SCP-169 and SCP-682.\n* His timeline's version of the Foundation launched \"Project Beluga,\" which resulted in an impossible war with SCP-UBU that lasted 441 years.\n* PoI-8048 deliberately sabotaged SCP-319 to act as a power source for SCP-8048, thus arriving in Lapland in the year 11,970 BCE.\n* SCP-UBU will arrive in Greenland on May 12th, 2588.\n* PoI-8048 was able to extend his lifespan by sharing his consciousness between a central computer within SCP-8048 and several thousand bodies created by his personal hominid replicators. Said consciousness-sharing was achieved through a book classified in the future as \"SCP-YEZ.\"\n* He wishes to assist the Foundation in the termination of SCP-UBU, and has laid out a plan for its termination as outlined in Document-8048-Zeta.\n\nDespite legitimacy concerns, PoI-8048 was able to mention at least 104 specific terms and pieces of data known only to standing members of the O5 Council.\n\n> [[=]]\n> +++ Motion as Follows: Allow PoI-8048 to assist the Foundation with SCP-UBU as per Document-8048-Zeta\n> [[/=]]\n> **Yea:** O5-4\n> \n> **Nay:** O5-1, O5-2, O5-3, O5-5, O5-6, O5-8 O5-9, O5-10, O5-11 O5-12, O5-13\n> \n> **Abstain:** O5-7\n> \n> **Votes Pending:** None\n> \n> **Result:** Motion failed\n\n> [[=]]\n> +++ Motion as Follows: Allow PoI-8048 to assist the Foundation with their own strategy to respond to SCP-UBU\n> [[/=]]\n> **Yea:** None\n> \n> **Nay:** O5-2, O5-3, O5-5, O5-6, O5-8 O5-9, O5-11 O5-12, O5-13\n> \n> **Abstain:** O5-1, O5-4, O5-7, O5-10\n> \n> **Votes Pending:** None\n> \n> **Result:** Motion failed\n\n> **Interview 8048-58124**\n> **Location:** Site-59\n> **Date:** 4/14/95\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Isaiah Henderson\n> **interviewed:** PoI-8048\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Please state your name for the record.\n> \n> **PoI-8048:** Dr. Laurence Michaud, former O5-11. \"█████ ██ ██████ ████, ████, ██████ ██ ████ ██.\"[[footnote]] A memetic passphrase that, when spoken by anyone other than a current or former O5-11, will result in the subject bursting into flames.
