The fence must be inspected every 8 hours for any sign of damage by someone Level-2 or higher. Anyone found inside who is not level-2 or higher is to be administered Class-A amnestics. At least 5 Omega-78's 'Dimension Hoppers' are on standby in case the anomalous entities try escaping the fence. Foundation Personnel must contact Site-390 and follow Protocol Capsaicin if there is an anomalous event.\n\n**Protocol Capsaicin:** \nProtocol Capsaicin should only be utilized when an anomalous event occurs, such as an entity appearing, unintelligible whispers, or sudden hallucinations.\nPersonnel should immediately contact Site-390 and request at least 5 Class-D's to be sent over to protect Foundation Personnel from being killed by the entities.[[footnote]] See Addendum 1.1[[/footnote]]\nAny Foundation Personnel inside the dimension must be quickly evacuated until all anomalous events cease.\nAfterward, personnel must use foundation-approved noise-canceling headphones and may only take them off until the anomalous event(s) stop. \n\n**Following Incident 'Hopscotch' Foundation Personnel are barred from entering. Personnel Level-2 or higher are to check the cameras thrice daily for potential damages -Dr. Collins.**\n\n**Descriptions:** \nSCP-8722-1 is a portal that leads to a dimension that contains two anomalous entities. The portal is 3 feet in length and 5 feet in height. The center of the portal displays what the dimension looks like. In the distance, there is a large tree that serves as a hub for the anomalous entities, and to the left is a dense forest with a thick fog covering the ground. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://i.imgur.com/FKMufwb.png\n| caption=close up photo of SCP-8722-2\n| align=right]]\n\nSCP-8722-2 are large tree-like creatures that take the form of a Quaking Aspen in our dimension. SCP-8722-2 instances are approximately 40  to 50 feet tall, with the majority being around 45 feet. SCP-8722-2 has eyes across its body, with each eye varying in size. These eyes, when visible, will watch the nearest person until they leave. SCP-8722-2 is neutral and won't attack unless something attacks it first. SCP-8722-2 is only docile towards SCP-8722-3 and serves as a protector. When it attempts to attack someone, it will wait for the person to have their back turned. SCP-8722-2 cannot be recorded or photographed, with any image or video becoming extremely distorted and blurred.  \n\nSCP-8722-3 is a group of faeries that range from 1 foot tall to 3 feet at maximum. SCP-8722-3 instances possess anomalous abilities such as being able to heal others, memory projection, and hallucinations. SCP-8722-3 can also lure in humans with their whispers to make it easier to kill them.[[footnote]] See Addendum 1.1[[/footnote]] SCP-8722-3 has wings protruding from their upper and lower back. Each SCP-8722-3 instance has a different variation of its wings, while family units tend to have a few similarities. SCP-8722-3 instances value and treat their wings with great respect; when one instance dies, the family will carefully remove the wings and grind them down into a fine powder. After this, the powder goes into a small pouch and is put at the tree's base.\n \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8722 was found on 2020/12/15 near Mount Charleston, Nevada. Dr. Wellins was subconsciously drawn to the area near SCP-8722 around 13:25. Upon realizing they were off the trail, they heard whispering and saw the eyes staring at them. \n\n\n[[size large]]**Interview Log 1.1**[[/size]]\n-----\n-----\n> \n> **Date:** 2020/12/19\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Jackson\n> \n> **Interviewee:** Dr. Wellins\n> \n>  [[size larger]] **<BEGIN LOG>** [[/size]]\n> \n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"Good afternoon, Dr. Wellins.

Could you tell me more about your encounter?\"\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"Yeah, okay, uhm... I was at Mount Charleston for a vacation, needed to get away from anomalies for a while.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"I got up that morning around 9 AM, or was it 11... No, wait, it was around 1 PM, and I decided to go on this trail I found the other day.  I remember I wasn't even halfway through, and then I just was somewhere completely different.

Inside; the dimension was daylight compared to ours being night. The area closest to the portal was empty. SCP-8722-2 and SCP-8722-3 instances were near the tree and hadn't noticed the team. As the team moved farther away from the portal, the body cameras and the microphones started to glitch and distort and only returned to normal once they returned to our dimension. \n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n+ ##FFFFFF| Excerpt of Orias' Personal Journal##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n**Date:** 2021/01/03\nIt's the third of January, and I've been notified that I will enter the dimension on directors' orders.

I've packed a small bag, knowing it's going to be dull in there.\n----\n**Date:** 2021/01/05\nTomorrow is the day a small research team, and I will enter. About an hour ago, I also discovered that I will be one of the leads on this Project. I don't know who the second lead is, but I pray they're relaxed. I want to avoid being stuck with someone who's a suck-up. \n----\n**Date:** 2021/01/08 \nThe other lead is Warren. Warren Collins, people say hate is a strong word, but it's one of the few words that can describe how I feel about him. All he does is boss me around and taunt me. It takes all the strength within me not to snap at him and have to go back to anger management classes.

I've been busy organizing notes and preparing for an interview tomorrow with an instance of SCP-8722-3. They've been one of the few instances that have approached us; they seem docile enough that they haven't attacked us yet. I wanted to nickname the instance, though we could only agree on SCP-8722-3A. We've only been here for a bit, and I'm already tired of this sunny limbo; it's annoying. Everything here seems too chipper; aside from the creepy forest, it's like the place in your fairytale books where the evil witch lives. \n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n+ ##FFFFFF| The Woods Whisper Names ##\n[[/=]]\n\nOrias' cot was empty when Warren woke up the next day. When he looked at the small clock he had with him, the time read 7 AM. He asked the other researchers around him if any had seen Orias, and they all declined. Warrens initially thought Orias had finally had enough of him and returned to Site-390. He made a mental note to email the director after the interview to ask about Orias. Warrens's thoughts about Orias subsided, and he focused on preparing for the interview with SCP-8722-3A. While preparing for the interview, he kept looking back toward the journal left on Orias' cot. \n----\n[[size large]]**Interview Log 1.2**[[/size]]\n----\n----\n> **Date:** 2021/01/18\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Collins\n> \n> **Interviewee:** SCP-8722-3A\n> \n> [[size larger]] **<BEGIN LOG>** [[/size]]\n> \n> //Warren crouched down in front of SCP-8722-3A. 8722-3A spoke in an unintelligible language.//\n> \n> **Dr. Collins:** \"Hello?

During this interview, he saw memories that SCP-8722-3A gave him; he believes that SCP-8722-3A did this as a form of communication.\n\nThe memories Dr. Collins saw were of an instance of SCP-8722-3 healing 8722-3A after getting hurt. Then, another played with SCP-8722-3A, healing another instance. \n\nThe next memory Dr. Collins saw was a younger version of 8722-3A, which was causing another to have hallucinations and then laugh at the instance. After that was 8722-3A, and a different instance, the second one, caused Orias to see Warren, and 8722-3A spoke rapidly in an unintelligible language. Eventually, 8722-3A got the other to stop, but Orias was already deep in the forest. \n\n The next few memories were 8722-3A, carefully removing wings off another instance. The instance looked old, and the other 8722-3s looked all upset. 8722-3A started to grind the wings into a fine powder and carefully poured it into a pouch; the group of SCP-8722s followed 8722-3A outside of the house and watched as 8722-3A placed the pouch on the ground. \n\nDr. Collins saw SCP-8722-3 luring humans and killing them just to eat them later, like cows in a slaughterhouse. 8722-3A quickly showed him a memory of 8722-3A healing another instance again, and Dr. Collins believes it was an attempt to calm him down. \n----\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nTO: richbichard@SCPi.Net\nFROM: warrcollins@SCPi.Net\nSUBJECT: Orias Wellins\n-----\nHello Dr. Richard, \nI finished an interview with an instance of SCP-8722-3, and it was concerning. They can project their memories, and one of their memories was Orias being tricked into entering the forest. Could you send out a team or anyone to retrieve Orias? It would be appreciated since they're a lead on this Project. \n- Dr. Warren Collins.\n----\nTO: warrcollins@SCPi.Net\nFROM: richbichard@SCPi.Net\nSUBJECT: RE: Orias Wellins\n----\nHello Dr. Collins, \nThank you for letting me know about Orias being missing. I'll have a team sent out shortly to search for them. It isn't your fault that Orias is missing, but in the future, please have a better awareness of your colleagues to prevent a situation like this.\n- Dr. Richard Bichard\nSite director of Site-390\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n**A Brief Excerpt from Warrens's notes**\nIt's been hours since I emailed Richard about this, yet I'm replaying these memories. A huge part of me doubts that Orias went into the forest; no sane person would. They're a doctor, for fucks sake; no way they'd willingly walk into a forest by themselves in a strange dimension. Even though a member of the Foundation is missing, I still need to continue my work. The next thing I want to do is get those bags of powder I saw in the memories. If it's as important as 8722-3A made it seem, then it's worth testing. \n[[/div]]\n----\n**The Test Logs**\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Test 1.0]]\n**Date:** 2021/02/05\n**Data:** D-6059 was instructed to ingest the powder with water.\n**Results:** The subject claimed not to feel anything at first; approximately one hour later, the subject could accidentally project their memories. The effects lasted for around an hour before they subsided completely\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Test 1.1]]\n**Date:** 2021/02/06\n**Data:** A repeat of the first test with D-72948\n**Results:** Almost instantly, the subject could create small balls of light that quickly dissipated; the subject could repeat this for 30 minutes until all anomalous effects ceased.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Test 1.2]]\n**Date:** 2021/02/07\n**Data:** D-13784 was told to ingest the remaining powder with water.\n**Results:** The subject immediately had adverse reactions and was sent into a catatonic state. D-13784 recovered 48 hours later. No anomalous effects were present in the 48 hours.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n**Post Notes:** The tests were conducted at Site-390 with project lead, Dr. Collins. Dr. Collins requested approval to gather more of the powder, which was granted. Dr. Collins was returned to Outpost-7AT0 after the initial tests were concluded.\n----\n[[=]]\n+ ##FFFFFF|Ignorance##\n[[/=]]\nWeeks passed, and numerous teams went near the forest to search for Orias, though they were limited to how far they could go. Warren was doubtful that Orias was even alive; there were no signs that Orias was near the forest other than the strange memory 8722-3A gave him. Warren had been conducting more tests using the powder; he knew that if Orias had been here, there would have been so many delays and setbacks; a part of him was enjoying Orias' absence in some twisted way.\n\nWhen everyone got used to Orias being missing, Orias showed up. They were scared, and they looked severely beaten. Orias was taken into custody and was quarantined for 24 hours. After 24 hours, Orias was interviewed to determine if they could return to work.\n\n[[size large]]**Interview Log 1.3**[[/size]]\n-----\n-----\n> \n> **Date:** 2021/02/10\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Jackson\n> \n> **Interviewee:** Dr. Wellins\n> \n>  [[size larger]] **<BEGIN LOG>** [[/size]]\n> \n> //Dr. Jackson walked into the room and sat down in front of Dr. Wellins//\n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"Hello, Dr. Wellins, my name is Dr. Jackson, and I'll be interviewing you today.\"\n> \n> //Dr. Wellins was silent but nodded slightly in response to Dr. Sopilia.//\n> \n>  **Dr. Jackson:** \"You haven't spoken much since being quarantined.

Of course, you'd follow after him.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"What happened after you realised it was a trick?\"\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"I tried backtracking but saw the eyes again.

How would you feel about returning to the dimension?\"\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"I don't know...  One part of me wants to return because I have an obligation, and the other wants to stay here.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"Both those feelings are valid, which are you leaning towards more?\" \n> \n>  //Dr. Wellins shrugged and looked off to the side of the room.//\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"I'm supposed to be honest right?\" \n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"Yes, this is supposed to measure if your able to return to work.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"I want to return, I found the anomaly after all, and I want to understand why one healed me.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Jackson:** \"Healed you? Does this relate to what happened in the forest?\"\n> \n>  //Dr. Wellins' personality changed drastically; they seemed more upbeat, determined, and possibly manic.//\n> \n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"Oh shit, right. Yeah, it does relate to in there. I glossed over that.

After a few minutes, they cleared their throat and spoke.//\n> \n>  **Dr. Jackson:** \"Well, good news, I think you're able to return to work; you seem much happier, which is a good sign.

Dr. Collins tried brushing off Dr. Wellins, but Dr. Wellins continued to try to speak with Dr. Collins. Dr. Wellins brought up a concern regarding anomalies SCP-8722-2 and SCP-8722-3 and wanted to halt the retrieval of the powder pouches. Dr. Collins almost laughed in Dr. Wellin's face, and Dr. Wellins continued, bringing up data charts and observation notes from different researchers. Dr. Collins immediately told Dr. Wellins that nothing was happening and that Dr. Wellins was trying to hinder the Project. \n\nThe conversation increased, with Dr. Wellins and Dr. Collins getting heated. Dr. Collins insulted Dr. Wellins, and then the argument spiraled into a psychical altercation that ended in Dr. Collins getting treatment for a broken nose. \n**Post Incident notes:** Dr. Wellins and Dr. Collins will attend anger management classes and therapy to identify the problems.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nTO: oriawellins@SCPi.Net\nFROM: richbichard@SCPi.Net\nSUBJECT: Project 8722\n-----\nHello Dr. Wellins,\nI received a Staff Incident report on my desk earlier this morning, and I'm afraid you will be removed as a lead regarding Project 8722 per the Staff Incident Report.

As the team approached the area, they noted no presence of 8722-2 or 8722-3. The team managed to recover a few pouches, and as they were about to return, an instance of SCP-8722-2 attacked the team, killing three members before the team could kill the anomaly. The rest of the team managed to get back to the base with a handful of pouches.\nMore researchers expressed their worry about any future expeditions.

Hell, I haven't seen 8722-3A in a while either. Something tells me that we aren't going to see them again. Warren forced the team to return to the tree almost every few days, and there was always nothing there. I think Warren is finally starting to realize how badly he fucked up; he keeps trying to bother me while I'm working on reports. \n----\n**Date:** 2021/04/07\nStill no sign of the anomalies. I would walk over there and see if 8722-3A is okay, but it's hard to move around since I'm still in pain. Warren finally managed to speak to me, he apologized, and I told him it was too late. I put in a request to be sent back to site-390. A putrid odor started to wash over the Outpost, and I could tell we all smelled it. \n----\n**Date:** 2021/04/12\nCommunications were just cut, and the others are trying to restore the power. The endless sunny days have been replaced with a menacing fog and a black sky. This has to be Warren's fault for being greedy; that's the only explanation. I feel the eyes staring at me again, but with the low visibility, we need to reconsider staying.\n----\n**Date:** 2021/04/16\nIt was horrible. It was chaotic. That is why we haven't seen any instances of SCP-8722-2 or SCP-8722-3; most of them had died out, and that is what the putrid smell was, too. God. I let this happen; I should have punched Warren sooner or forced him out of the Project. \n\nA lot of innocent people died that day. I barely managed to get Warren out of there. He looked terrified. All I remember hearing from him was him praying to god to forgive him. An instance of SCP-8722-2 broke his leg, so I had to carry him out of the portal. Because of that, I got a cool few scars on my face and arms. \n\nThe portals are gone now, too; I think SCP-8722-3 was keeping it open through some magic. They didn't deserve to have their home destroyed; they were kind, innocent creatures that were just living in a weird limbo-esque dimension., and then they died trying to defend their home. It's almost poetic. \n[[/div]]\n-----\n----\n[[=]]\n+ ##FFFFFF|Ommetaphobia##\n[[/=]]\n[[size large]]**Audio Log 35 2024/01/15**[[/size]]\n>\n> [[size larger]] **<BEGIN LOG>** [[/size]]\n>\n> //There's muffled breathing and then a deep sigh.//\n>\n> **Dr. Wellins:** \"Audio log 35.

They looked towards their old journal, which was left collecting dust on their desk. They rubbed their eyes, trying to rub the sleep off. They threw on their lab coat and looked around for their glasses and keycard. They found both on a small tray near the door. They reached for the door handle when they heard a notification from their laptop. They sighed and shuffled back to their desk, muttering under their breath.\n\nThey opened their laptop and saw it was an email from Warren. They shook their head and clicked on the email.\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nTO: oriawellins@SCPi.Net\nFROM: warrcollins@SCPi.Net\nSUBJECT: I need your help\n-----\nOrias, I'm heading to your room. It's some assistance with a report that you can surely handle. Please, for the love of god, don't instigate me today; this report needed to be done by this morning.\n- Dr. Warren Collins\n[[/div]]\n\n Orias groaned as they closed their laptop again. They weren't upset; it was something to keep their mind busy, after all. Orias opened their door, looked down the hall, and saw Warren approaching rapidly. Orias chuckled, closed the door, and leaned against it.\n\n\"Doctor.\"\n\nWarren stopped and nodded toward Orias. He looked exasperated. Orias walked over to Warren and took some of the papers he was holding with a grin on their face.\n\n\"This must have been difficult if you are asking me for help. I thought the great Doctor Warren doesn't need help?\"\n\n\"I'll admit, there are some things that you know better than me. Not a lot but there are some.\"\n\nThe two began walking back towards Warrens's office, with one of the two making the occasional sarcastic remark about the other. This wasn't how either of them expected their day to go, but neither could entirely complain.\n\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> This article contains a quote from book //Alice's Adventures In Wonderland// by Lewis Carroll //https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/131294-it-s-no-use-going-back-to-yesterday-because-i-was//\n> \n\n------\n\n> **Filename:**lEpMoBG.png\n> **Author:**Nostellae\n> **License:** I release this image under CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://i.imgur.com/lEpMoBG.png\n> \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[size larger]]<< [[[SCP-8721]]] | SCP-8722 | [[[SCP-8723]]] >>[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
