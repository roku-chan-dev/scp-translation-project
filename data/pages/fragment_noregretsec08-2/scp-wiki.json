My legs feel weak as I grab onto the table for balance and take a moment to slow my heart rate. Taking a deep breath, I lift my hands towards the lockbox, touching its dusty, greasy frame, and lift it open. Everything is exactly as it said. The journal lay there with the polaroids gathered on top, obscuring the writing on the cover. \n\nI will have to find the main one. \n\nI shift through, seeing the deserts of Afghanistan, an ordinary school classroom, a busy airport, and then I see itâ€”a blank, pristine film.\n@@ @@\n\n**BANG**.\n\n**BANG**.\n\n**BANG**.\n\n@@ @@\nSomeone is here.\n\nThey are looking for me.\n\nI have to hide.\n\nNo, I have to run.\n\nNo... No. No. No. No!\n\nThere is so much to do.\n\nSo much to see.\n\nSo much to change.\n\nSo much regret. \n\nI regret coming here. \n\nThat is my deepest regret. \n\nI should've never opened this box. \n\nI should've never held //it// in my hand. \n\nPlease, give me a way out. \n\nI hold the Polaroid film to my face as it slowly forms a picture with a crackle. My heart races as light from the hallway begins to pierce through the cracks of the broken door.  Hurry up, you cheap piece of shit.\n@@ @@\n\n**CRASH**\n\n@@ @@\nThe door splinters open as four men dressed in black armored uniforms enter the room with their guns raised toward me. I look back at the film, seeing its finished image of a snowy landscape covered by rocks and dead flora. A sense of relief washes over me as I realize //it// picked the entrance of Site-02. \n\n\"Doctor Poy,\" I hear someone yell, \"Put your hands up, now!\"\n\n\"No,\" I say with a slight chuckle, \"I know what will happen if I do.\"\n@@ @@\n\n[[<]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7306/offset/1 |I'm Sorry, You're Too Late.]]]\n[[/<]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
