Affected materials include granite, marble, sandstone, limestone, and obsidian. The effect is lessened on metals; bronze has proven to be the most pliable.\n\n**Description:**\n\nOwned by the great sculptor Donatello, the items include: two cedar mallets, three chisels (one pointed, one flat, one toothed), the shaft of a hammer, and a hand drill. Despite the fact that several components have gone missing (such as the round-headed chisel) or have been destroyed (such as the hammer's head), the item continues to hold divine properties.\n\nDonatello is not believed to have imbued his tools with divine properties himself; rather, an account exists of him witnessing a vision of St. Luke the Evangelist, upon which the tools were delivered to him. The account below is taken by a scholar from the Vatican following Donatello's encounter.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Show Vatican Documentation\" hide=\"Close Documentation\"]] \n\n-----\n\n//The sculptor found himself in his studio, his fingers idle, attempting to extract the figure from within the marble. One of his assistants, who shall go unnamed, cleaved a portion of the sculpture's arm from its shoulder. As this damage was worried over, Donatello found his mallet and chisel in his hand, and saw a figure of light before him, telling him the exact process to mend the stone. And mended it was; the statue was whole within minutes.//\n------\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nDonatello is believed to have employed the divine properties of these tools only twice after the initial blessing: the first, during his time sculpting a massive figure of Saint John the Evangelist, before finding the work too easy; the second, following the casting of his second //[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Donatello) David]//, where it was used to correct a flaw that had been present in the mould. \n\n**Provenance:**\n \n__1410__: Divine properties are imbued upon Donatello's tools.\n\n__1414__: The Vatican dispatches inspectors for the first time, confirming the divine nature of the tools.\n\n__1466__: Following Donatello's death, the tools are passed down to his student [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertoldo_di_Giovanni Bertoldo di Giovanni], who uses them to complete Donatello's unfinished San Lorenzo pulpits.\n\n__Late 1480s__: Lorenzo de Medici, our Founder, begins an academy for artists in his gardens at San Marco; Bertoldo di Giovanni demonstrates the tools to Lorenzo. This develops into an interest in Occult Art.\n\n__Early 1490s__: Bertoldo di Giovanni is named the first Curator of the Medicea Accademia Dell'Arte Occulta. \n\n__1500__: The tools are used to aid in the construction of additions to the Florentine academy, and to begin work on the Venetian academy.\n\n__1605__: The Vatican re-inspects the tools, and again confirms their divine properties.\n\n__1773__: The head of the hammer shatters under the strain of attempting to work the stone at the newly-built London Academy. It is believed that this is due to the Protestant nature of English masonry. Work on the London Academy is finished by hand.\n\n__1899__: The tools are analyzed by the Vatican a third and final time. \n\n__1962__: The rounded chisel is stolen; its whereabouts are as of yet unknown.\n\n__1989__: The Foundation becomes aware of them, and borrows a component (specifically the flat-headed chisel) to conduct tests.\n\n__2019__: The pieces are stolen as part of a break-in at the Florentine Academy. They are recovered in an airtight case two days after the robbery. \n\n\n[[/div]]",
