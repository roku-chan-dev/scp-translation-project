This is distinct from the [[[Audio Adaptations]]] page, which lists readings of articles that remain completely faithful to the source material, without additions or subtractions. The following works are all SCP related, but include reviews, interviews and original audio dramas, although on-site hubs for audio readings by specific people are also linked.\n\nThis list aims to be comprehensive and so can be updated by any site member. Ideally, each link should have its own tagline written (or at least approved) by the Hub creator for each of the works.\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n+ Ongoing Podcasts\nOne-off recordings and podcasts that have not updated in the last year or are officially inactive can be moved to the Podcast and Audio Archive. \n* [[[discovering-scp-hub| Discovering SCP]]] - Veteran writer [[*user Tanhony]] and inexperienced newcomer [[*user DarnellJermaine]] read and discuss SCP articles.\n* [[[findusalivehub| Find Us Alive Podcast Hub]]] - Scripted audiofiction podcast set after the [[[SCP-6320| disappearance of Site-107]]], written and produced by [[*user Raddagher]].\n* [[[simply-creative-people-hub | Simply Creative People]]] - Simply Creative People is the podcast for SCP Creatives.
