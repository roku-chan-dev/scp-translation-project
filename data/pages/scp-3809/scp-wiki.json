A profile is to be developed and disseminated to major law enforcement organizations concerning the hacker known as “Maggie”.  \n\nAny reports of movements by SCP-3809 by non-Foundation personnel are to be suppressed and reporting individuals amnesticized.\n\nTwenty-four-hour surveillance of SCP-3809’s location and activities is to be maintained by Foundation AICs.\n\n\n\n-----\n++++ __Description__:\nSCP-3809 is a fully autonomous artificial intelligence contained within the housing of a communications satellite.  SCP-3809 claims to be both a twenty-seven-year-old woman named “Maggie” and also a satellite. \n\nThe satellite is capable of adjusting its orbit around the Earth through unknown means.  SCP-3809 has maintained geosynchronous orbit above Houston, Texas, USA since the initial event that led to its discovery. It is also capable of computing power far beyond what should be possible given the satellite’s specifications.\n@@ @@\n\n\n**__Discovery__**:  SCP-3809 was discovered when internet activity in the area around Houston, Texas increased exponentially on 8 October, 2020.  After Foundation AIC noted an anomalously dramatic upswing in activity, representing the attention of several million separate IP addresses at once, they attempted to trace the source to locate the potential anomalous hacker attack.  A DDoS[[footnote]]Distributed Denial of Service[[/footnote]] attack was considered unlikely as the activity was spread out among every social media server, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Periscope, and YouTube.  \n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/osteen2\n| caption=Joel Osteen performing a sermon at Lakewood Church.]]\n\nWithin three hours, the hacker focused entirely on accounts and events centered around Osteen Ministries, including accessing personal information behind firewalls.  Osteen Ministries is the Megachurch owned and operated by Pastor Joel Osteen, operated in Houston, Texas out of Lakewood Church.[[footnote]]The building has a capacity for over sixteen thousand parishioners.[[/footnote]]  In addition to live services, Osteen Ministries offers streaming sermons, lessons, and Bible studies, regularly drawing millions of viewers.\n\nDespite the amount of electronic engagement, the AICs traced the activity to only one IP address: that of a communications satellite owned by Keiper Industries, a developing communications conglomerate. At first, Foundation technicians theorized the satellite was utilized as a relay point, but after twenty-four hours of constant surveillance, it was ascertained that the signal originated from the satellite itself.\n\nThe satellite, designated SCP-3809, was determined to be acting without external instruction during these events while maintaining its original purpose despite only operating on solar energy.[[footnote]]Given the activities of SCP-3809, it is estimated to have required a power source of sixteen thousand gigajoules.[[/footnote]]  Given the limited processing power of the satellite, it is unclear how this activity was accomplished.[[footnote]]To achieve the multipronged assault on so many separate systems, the offender would have to be utilizing a quantum based computing process.  Which a) does not exist and b) would likely not fit within the confines of the satellite’s main housing.[[/footnote]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #C9C9C9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n++++ Interview Logs\nOn 10 October, 2020, it was discovered that SCP-3809 had access to communication channels that allowed it to make telephone calls.
