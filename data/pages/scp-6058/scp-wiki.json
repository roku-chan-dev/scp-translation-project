Testing is forbidden.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6058 is a mechanical device capable of producing live specimens of any lifeform, extinct or otherwise, when provided with a valid sample of said lifeform's DNA.\n\nThe rate at which SCP-6058 performs this function is variable, and believed to be dependent on the size of the organism in question. Once completed, SCP-6058 will expel its reproduction through a metal shaft at the base of the object. Further attempts to analyze the interior structure of SCP-6058 have resulted in failure.\n\n**Experimentation Log:**  \n\n||~ Test #||~ Subject||~ Result||\n||1||Chicken feather||SCP-6058 produced a rooster.||\n||2||1 ounce of pork||SCP-6058 produced a pig.||\n||3||Tarantula leg||SCP-6058 produced a tarantula.||\n||4||Tarantula cadaver||SCP-6058 produced a tarantula.||\n||5||2 tarantula cadavers||SCP-6058 produced two tarantulas.||\n||||||||||||= [72 LINES OMITTED]||\n||78||Mammoth fossil||SCP-6058 appeared to strain for approximately eight hours, before producing what was later determined to be a deceased wooly mammoth calf. Cause of death ruled as asphyxiation.||\n||79||Velociraptor fossil||SCP-6058 rejects the material and fails to function, with subsequent experiments delivering similar results. [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4041 |Further investigation pending.]]]||\n||80||300,000 year old human bone fragment||See addendum.||\n\n**Addendum:** Over the course of Test 80, SCP-6058 strained for approximately 48 hours before dispensing a small piece of parchment from its ejection shaft and temporarily ceasing to function. The object read as follows:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **{{ERROR!
