  "content": "[[span class=\"blackout\"]]No[[/span]]body [[span class=\"blackout\"]]ever expects it, and, let's be honest, you were in no way expecting anything to happen of note today, given the emptiness not only of the day but of your w[[/span]]hole [[span class=\"blackout\"]]life, that same, dreary, day[[/span]] in, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]day[[/span]] out, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]living and surviving and living[[/span]] and still you keep fucking [[span class=\"blackout\"]]living so now we have to do something, and all of the sudden[[/span]] the fuck-ton [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of emptiness you had becomes a whirlwind of pain and sadness, but reality and humanity and that //spark//, you know the one, the **magic** spark that[[/span]] pushes us [[span class=\"blackout\"]]towards and away from greatness and history, the knifes blade that controls and fights and sharpens your wit, until, wit, there is nothing left to witness, and without a witness how can you possibly exist, but of course you can't, no[[/span]]body [[span class=\"blackout\"]]can, who thinks that they are truly worthy of[[/span]] self-observation, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]this[[/span]] perverse [[span class=\"blackout\"]]internal[[/span]] leer [[span class=\"blackout\"]]as you mentally reach out to all that makes your domain, your mind, soul, and[[/span]] body, and body, and flesh [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and blood and organs and[[/span]] skin [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and rot and life and pain and only, every so often, if one is especially lucky, you are given the chance to[[/span]] create [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and there is no true parallel to that of progenitor, the sculptor //ex nihilo//, exhale now and never excel even in emptiness, but then you realize that it is --all that we destroy-- transforms in our minds' eyes, and what was nihilo is now ex -- escape velocity is never easy to obtain, of course, you live by that mantra,[[/span]] stuck between two [[span class=\"blackout\"]]forces of gravity,[[/span]] pushed [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and[[/span]] pulled [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and[[/span]] stomped [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and lifted up, up, up but only[[/span]] just high enough [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that when they let you go, you are tumbling, falling, plummeting, witnessing your own inevitable death until you finally **crash**, dive[[/span]] down deep [[span class=\"blackout\"]]into the loving[[/span]] embrace [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of our captors, the parasitic disease we call family, lost and aghast in a cavalcade of[[/span]] need[[span class=\"blackout\"]]ful things, useless things, things that wit not to witness, losing who //they// are to the inevitable,[[/span]] creep[[span class=\"blackout\"]]ing,[[/span]] exciting, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]logic-defying truth, that while all things may end in death, you are not all things, you are not death, you are not a witness, you are not, witnessing //ex vivo en nihilo//, the memories of nihilo exhale and exhaust and terrify and multiply[[/span]] extracting the essence [[span class=\"blackout\"]]of what it means to forget, and there it is, that is the[[/span]] sin [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that we endeavor to oblige, the errata we long to erase, nihilo y ,,nihilo,, y nihilo, until we once again remain, and return, but where do you return when the only scrap of life that you cling to is held to wit only by the witless one, withering and wilting under the eyes of the observers, the[[/span]] observed, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the ex-ambassadors of the land where dreams live until they are dreamt, a dying planet hemorrhaging the hopes and nightmares and compilations of what was once //you//, but has never truly been your**self**, of course, nothing can ever truly hope to be **self**, after all, **self** is as **self**less as **self** does, and does the **self** salvage the selvage end of our untimely strings of fate, the ever-woven tapestry of irrelevant[[/span]] emptiness, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the taunts that echo through the empty school prisons,[[/span]] the impacts [[span class=\"blackout\"]]that rock the very foundation upon which //self// is built, and with it, the death of observation and the reincarnation of identification as commodity, the capitalistic nightmare that gives[[/span]] power [[span class=\"blackout\"]]to those without wit, those who have the right stuff, the[[/span]] special sauce, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the magic that[[/span]] flows out [[span class=\"blackout\"]]through the mind and[[/span]] __onto__ [[span class=\"blackout\"]] __the page__,[[/span]] the ex[[span class=\"blackout\"]]-sculptors now consumed into //nihilo//, those special few who deign to inscribe their images and memories and hatred and[[/span]] longing [[span class=\"blackout\"]]and memories, of course memories, we remember, remember members whose[[/span]] membranes we punctured [[span class=\"blackout\"]]just to get a better view, a glimpse into that which we cannot be, those we are unable to live as, the un-un-dead, living amongst the monsters of the digital worlds we[[/span]] conceive [[span class=\"blackout\"]]just to lock away on a server, the server who witnesses our greed,[[/span]] the child, [[span class=\"blackout\"]]the idea, the //genesis ex nihilo ex genesis//, the one who is left -- you suddenly realize, you --**__alone__**-- are a witness to today.[[/span]]",
