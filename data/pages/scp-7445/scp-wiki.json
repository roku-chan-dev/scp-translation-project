Out of all the 19 attempts carried out by Foundation personnel in order to try and breach SCP-7445's entrance, none have proven successful. As such, SCP-7445's contents are currently unknown.\n\nSCP-7445 was originally discovered by Provisional Area-358's Communications Department following the interception of a report detailing the discovery of a previously unknown room within LoI-NW/107, although no researchers could enter it.

His right femur and tibia were found to suffer from minor injuries, and a bullet was extracted from his right calf. Additionally, a fracture had opened on his left temple, requiring surgery in order to be treated. Because of this, the agent was officially discharged until he fully recovered from his wounds.\n\nAll amnesticized personnel were extracted from the base and moved to Provisional Area-358, where each of them were administered a large dose of Class-B amnestics and discharged from their prior positions. The remaining pair of personnel was found to be outside the base, performing tests on the area's permafrost and soil. They were promptly amnesticized by the recovery team before they returned to the base.\n\nLoI-NW/107 was successfully seized and a group of Foundation researchers was established in the base in order to contain SCP-7445.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**Addendum 7445-2:** INCIDENT LOG -- 07.03.1971}}[[footnote]]Uploaded onto {{DIRECTORY_7445/2}} on March 7th, 1971 by Dr. Ilya Námachov.[[/footnote]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\nOn the morning of March 7th, 1971, 15 days following the containment of SCP-7445, several squads of the Global Occult Coalition were spotted patrolling through the streets of Savukoski, Savukoski Municipality, carrying heavy weaponry and explosive materials. All of the GOC officers were dressed as members of the local authorities and the Abnormal Interactions Command.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:50%\"]]\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Longyearbyen_1989.jpg/1280px-Longyearbyen_1989.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\n{{**Fig 3.1** -- Savukoski, Finland, circa 1968.}}\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAt about 0640 hours, GMT+1, all GOC operatives stationed themselves in front of the Savukoski Town Hall, and breached its entrance using battering rams and siege engines. Following this, the operatives stormed the site and all civilians were held at gunpoint under the guise of a national scale drug investigation being performed.\n\nAfter breaching onto the observatory's basement, the operatives found a vault door that led to Provisional Area-358, located beneath the STH. The vault was breached using rams, as it required a password in order to be opened. Following this, several groups of operatives stormed the facility beneath.\n\nAs the raid continued, a group of GOC operatives proceeded to cut the power supply, and the facility went pitchblack. An evacuation protocol was initiated by the Site's personnel, and a Site-wide breach was announced to the remainder of the Foundation. Local security was heavily affected by the power cutoff, as the lack of power resulted in MTF responses being delayed. Additionally, the MTFs were not prepared to respond to such an incident.\n\nLater during the incident, the Foundation personnel began evacuating through an emergency tunnel that would lead them to the Savukoski helipad, where they would be transported to the city of Rovaniemi until Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") security teams could properly deal with the breach. As the breach went on, however, Foundation helicopters stationed at R3C Halcyon-3[[footnote]]Rapid Response Remote Camps are operated in remote areas to aid evacuating Foundation personnel during breaches and raids. The majority of the Foundation's R3Cs are located across the Arctic Circle, the Himalayas, and the Antarctic Circle.[[/footnote]] were simultaneously hijacked by another group of assailants that damaged the helicopters' engines.\n\nThe camp was later declared as lost, as the assailants had destroyed all of the Foundation's properties and captured all personnel. As such, no evacuation routes were considered plausible at the time, requiring personnel to take alternatives and improvise.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:50%\"]]\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/APEX_and_snowy_Chajnantor.jpg/640px-APEX_and_snowy_Chajnantor.jpg]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\n{{**Fig 3.2** -- Palavataivas Observatorio, Savukoski, circa 1970.}}\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs the GOC squads began wreaking havoc across the site, destroying large amounts of materials, seizing multiple anomalies and capturing as much personnel as possible, a series of operatives proceeded to leave the site and admonish all individuals wearing white coats and ushankas. This hindered the personnel's attempts to escape through the assigned evacuation routes, as a large amount of civilians joined the cause and helped the squads chasing the persecuted.\n\nNotably, the admonition was first transmitted in Russian, but later in Finnish.\n\n----\n\nIn total, only 3 of the 47 researchers stationed at Provisional Site-358 managed to escape. The rest were abducted by the intruders, and extracted from Savukoski towards an unknown location. None of the escapees managed to retain any information about the incident, as their objectives were solely focused on escaping the Site safe and sound.\n\nProvisional Site-358 was successfully recovered by a platoon of Foundation soldiers on that same day, and as of March 8th, 1971, the Site is officially secure.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/a-hrd-day-s-work/HRFORWIKI.svg) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[=]]\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n++ {{**<<NOTICE FROM THE RECORDKEEPING AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION>>**}}\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n[[/=]]\nThe previous file has been heavily modified by an unidentified intruder.

None of them carried any GOC identifiers, or any sort of identifying material for that matter.\n\nFollowing the recovery of Provisional Site-358, it was revealed that all terminals containing remote SCP files were hijacked and locked under a new password. However, the encrypting was noted to be weak and easy to crack, leading to the swift recovery of the terminals by Foundation technicians.\n\nNotably, among the 34 files contained within the remote terminals, only 3 were edited by the intruders described in Addendum 7445-2:\n\n* The SCP-7445 document;\n* A file containing information on Incident-████/1, an event that took place in November 1959 in the town of Kolari, Finland, and involved information regarding an anomaly under the GRU-P Division's jurisdiction;\n* And a dossier containing notorious information about LoI-NW/107, which was heavily guarded by Foundation personnel until a raid occurred on March 5th, 1971, and terminated all of the Foundation's activities within SCP-7445 and the observatory.[[footnote]]Addendum 7445.1.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe second and third files were completely devoid of contents following their recovery by the technicians, and all attempts to perform a backup or a recovery of their previous contents were met with failure.

As such, the individual known as Dr. Ilya Námachov is either an intruder pertaining to another organization, __or doesn't exist__.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSince the original SCP-7445 file was deleted along with all of its addenda and contents, a new recontainment operation needs to be carried out in order to recreate the old document. Excavation and extraction of SCP-7445 will begin on March 18th, 1971 in order to transport the anomaly to Provisional Site-358.\n\nAs a result of the recent raid on Provisional Site-358, the O5 Council has performed an unanimous vote, and officially declared that the facility will be moved to the municipality of Riihimäki along with SCP-7445 in order to avoid further breaches.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]",
