At long last, he would be happy, and he would share his magnum opus with the world. His Concerto had been scheduled, the music was ready, and it called to him.\n\nHe waited in the wings, wrapping his tie around his neck as he awaited the cue.

He clicked his heels and held his arms up, basking in the adoration of the crowd with a smile on his face.\n\n= He was complete.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Op. 19b, No. 1, Andante con moto, MWV U 86\" hide=\"A Song Without Words\"]]\n[[<]]\n> **Incident Report**\n> **Anomalies Involved:** [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3817 SCP-3817]\n> **Responding Personnel:** Researcher Pavel\n> **Description of Events:** SCP-3817 was found hanging from a light fixture using a noose made of bed sheets.
