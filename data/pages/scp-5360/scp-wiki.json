A cover story will be disseminated that SCP-5360 is to be made a city landmark. The appearance of SCP-5360 and all evidence will be logged daily. A mobile testing location will be constructed for ease of access in this purpose. Only Level 3+ personnel may have access to SCP-5360. Due to Incident 5360-1, all personnel assigned for longer than a week must undergo mandatory psychiatric evaluation. Researcher Kazato will be the Head Researcher for SCP-5360 following Incident 5360-1.\n----\n[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]\n\nSCP-5360 is the designation for the murder scene of Vincent Taglietti (and by extent, the estate). 5360's anomalous properties manifest daily at approximately 1 AM. At this time, all pertinent evidence within the estate will disappear and reappear within five minutes. However, the evidence will have either greatly changed or no longer be relevant to the murder. Additionally, the corpse will re-manifest with a different cause of death and as an entirely different person. \n\nA list of various changes have been composed, which include:\n* A Colt M1911A1 handgun re-manifested as a Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver.\n* A 30-year old male with a death by gunshot re-manifested as a 23-year old female with a death by manual strangulation.\n* Any pictures or video taken of the crime scene are corrupted (digitally) or blank (film).\n\nCurrently, none of the corpses produced by SCP-5360 have been identified. A list of all SCP-5360 appearances and pieces of evidence is available upon request.\n----\n[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]\n\nSCP-5360 was discovered in Spring Green, Wisconsin on March 14th, 2019, after the murder of its owner Vincent Taglietti. When police investigators first attempted to investigate, 5360's anomalous properties manifested. The Foundation took jurisdiction over the investigation six days later and enacted temporary containment procedures; full containment was implemented ten days from 5360's first manifestation. The murder of Vincent Taglietti has not been solved.\n----\n[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** Incident 5360-1[[/size]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#f9efc2; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; font-family: \"Courier New\", monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 130%]]\n[[collapsible show=\"« 5360-1 Investigation Log »\" hide=\"» 5360-1 Investigation Log «\"]]\n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#fffdf0; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;font-family: sans-serif;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __Investigative Bureau of Internal Crime__\n\n[[size 125%]] **INCIDENT LOG** [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nOn December 14th, 2019, at 10:04 AM, the body of former Head Researcher Carter was discovered in the shed adjacent to the main house of SCP-5360. \n\nHe was found having sliced his carotid artery with a knife produced by SCP-5360; an on-site autopsy determined that Researcher Carter died at approximately 9:00 PM the previous day. This was corroborated by the fact that the side entrance had been opened by Carter at 8:55 PM (as evidenced by logs from the entrance's electronic keypad). Additionally, it had been raining the day before - the ground outside was extremely muddy. Only one set of footprints was found in the mud, leading from the side entrance to the shed. These footprints matched with the boots worn by Researcher Carter.\n\nA note was found written by Researcher Carter, expressing his disgust at seeing the corpses of SCP-5360 everyday. New procedures will be implemented to prevent this type of incident in the future.\n\n**Approximate Timeline of Events:**\n* At 7:00 PM, Researcher Travis Carter and Researcher Inoue Kazato enter the main house of SCP-5360 to conduct research.\n* Carter leaves 5360 at 8:30, as seen on some security footage.\n* Carter re-enters 5360 at 8:55 by the side entrance and enters the shed.\n* Carter writes the note, then proceeds to commit suicide.\n* Researcher Kazato leaves the main house at SCP-5360 at 9:10.\n* The body of Researcher Carter is discovered at 10:04 AM the next day.\n\n[[>]]\n- Investigation conducted by Agents Trevelyan and Kogoro.\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]  \n----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ADDENDUM IS LEVEL 5/5360 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THESE ADDENDUM WITHOUT LEVEL 5/5360 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[size 125%]] **Addendum 02:** Researcher Kazato Interview Log[[/size]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#f9efc2; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify; font-family: \"Courier New\", monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 130%]]\n[[collapsible show=\"« Interview Log, 12/15/19 »\" hide=\"» Interview Log, 12/15/19 «\"]] \n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #e5ddb7; background:#fffdf0; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: left;font-family: sans-serif;\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #004fa0; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; background-color: #fff; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Researcher Inoue Kazato\n\n**Interviewer:** IBIC Agent Akechi Kogoro\n-----\n[[=]]\n**[ BEGIN LOG ]**\n[[/=]]\n**Akechi:** Hello, Researcher Kazato.\n\n**Kazato:** Good morning, Agent. I suppose you're here to see me about the SCP-5360 incident again?\n\n**Akechi:** Sorry for being so predictable! \n\n//< Akechi laughs. >//\n\n**Akechi:** I just have to ask you something.\n\n**Kazato:** I think I've told you everything I know.\n\n**Akechi:** Ah, yes. So you say. What size are your shoes, if I may ask?\n\n**Kazato:** What? What does this have anything to do with the incident?\n\n**Akechi:** Please, if you would, just answer the question.\n\n**Kazato:** Fine. I'm a size nine.\n\n**Akechi:** Size nine, I see. What kind of shoes do you wear?\n\n**Kazato:** Combat boots, high lace.\n\n//< Akechi is silent for two minutes. >//\n\n**Kazato:** Can I go now? I've got to take care of things at the site.\n\n**Akechi:** I'm... afraid not. \n\n**Kazato:** Why not?\n\n**Akechi:** Because Travis Carter's death wasn't a suicide. It was a very, very well planned murder. And you're the one who committed it.\n\n//< Kazato briefly smiles. >//\n\n**Kazato:** Oh? What makes you say that, hmm? Wasn't I in the main building from seven o'clock to ten past nine?\n\n**Akechi:** According to the report, you were.\n\n**Kazato:** And there were no footprints from the house to the shed, right?\n\n**Akechi:** Indeed there weren't.\n\n**Kazato:** So how could I have committed this so-called murder, huh?\n\n**Akechi:** Well, you couldn't have-\n\n**Kazato:** See! What was that accusation about, then?\n\n**Akechi:** - if that really had been Carter who left at eight-thirty.\n\n**Kazato:** Are you stupid? There was security footage of him leaving the main house at that time.\n\n**Akechi:** There was security footage of //someone// leaving the main house. The only person who said it was Carter was you. After all, both of you have similar builds and external appearances. It wouldn't have been far-fetched for you to walk out pretending to be him. He can't disprove it.\n\n**Kazato:** W- what are you suggesting?\n\n**Akechi:** I'm suggesting that you called Carter to the main house and knocked him out. You then walked out, being careful not to show your face to the security cameras.\n\n**Kazato:** His body was found in the shed, you idiot! He's the one that opened the side entrance! There were only one set of footprints going towards the shed, and none between the house! How do you suggest that I got his body then?\n\n**Akechi:** That's not too difficult.\n\n**Kazato:** How, then? \n\n**Akechi:** You took his card when you left. Then, you came back and entered used his card to get through the side gate so it would look like he opened it. \n\n**Akechi:** You transported the body using long, vertical planks between the main house and the shed so you wouldn't leave footprints. You then propped his body up and slit his throat with the knife. The note was most likely prepared beforehand. After that, you swapped your shoes: both of you share the same shoe size and wear the same type of combat boots. You left the shed using the planks, then exited the main house as if nothing happened.\n\n**Kazato:** Long vertical planks? Hah. I didn't carry anything like that in. What did I use?\n\n**Akechi:** I noticed by comparing the 5360 logs that a pair of long skis had vanished from the shed, but had turned up in the main house the next day. They didn't have anything to do with the crime that was logged that day, so why were they moved? Because you had used them to cross the distance between the main house and the shed.\n\n//< Kazato is visibly distressed. >//\n\n**Kazato:** Where- wh- where's your proof?\n\n**Akechi:** You have them on you.\n\n**Kazato:** What?\n\n**Akechi:**  You're wearing the same shoes as the day you committed the murder. At the scene of the crime, the ground around Carter's feet had blood splatters. I'm not sure if you realized it.\n\n//< Kazato looks down at his feet and starts shaking. >//\n\n**Akechi:** When you swapped the shoes, you inadvertently took the shoes that were stained with his blood. You've never - by all reports - been near Carter since the incident happened. One witness can cleanly testify that your boots were shined clean two days ago. If we test the blood on your shoes, and should it belong to Carter, that would prove that you were at the scene of the crime.\n\n//< Kazato is silent for several minutes. >//\n\n**Kazato:** Hah, I guess- I guess you've won.\n[[=]]\n**[ END LOG ]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5359]]] | SCP-5360 | [[[SCP-5361]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
