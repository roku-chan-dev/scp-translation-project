The princes of the world have made a holy place for him, a sanctum sanctorum that the sun shall never touch, a temple they have named Continuity-of-Command Deepwell 02.\n\nIn the next room, a reel-to-reel magnetic tape records silence, on and on. An hour of silence repeated every hour, every day, for years.\n\nThe silence lasts for a long, long time.\n\nAnd then it breaks. A sound like distant thunder ascends from the infrasonic depths and crashes upon the shore, and the microphone spikes with the sounds of chariot wheels and spears upon shields and the cries of dying men and the call of trumpets. The herald‚Äôs horns of kingship.\n\nFrom the cacophony, a voice of power; a voice of billowing smoke and the grinding of millstones.\n\nHw√¶t!\n\nThe mouth of ê§å - ê§ã - ê§ä speaks.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\nAt 2103 EDT 07.JUL.1986, SCP-089 underwent a locution event. Event recorded, transcribed, and translated without complication. Interpretation and threat assessment followed per SOP. Translation as follows:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nHear these words, O ye princes! Attend and bear witness, O ye nations! May all who might hear listen; may all who have knowledge understand. The hour of tribulation approaches; the end of the age draws near. Ye have been weighed and measured; your silver is adulterated, your gold has tarnished.\n\nGo forth into the land of the mountains of Wormwood, to the river that is called Of No Return, on whose banks live the flock of Yishai. There you shall find a virgin among them, the seventh-of-seven, and she shall be with child.\n\nThe issue that shall come forth shall appear as a man, but shall not be a man; he shall speak as a man, but shall not be of man. Should ye pass him through the fire, he shall not be harmed; should ye strike him with a sword, he shall not be injured. He shall be exalted in his hour as a prince of all nations, and his seal shall be upon their brow, and upon their hand, and upon their tongue. All the beasts of the world and all the powers of the heavens shall bow down before him; yea, he shall subjugate them, and they shall cry out ‚Äúanam, anam, shomash udal anam‚Äù.\n\nHe shall incite the bear and the eagle to war with each other; the eagle shall claw at the eyes of the bear, and the bear shall tear at the wings of the eagle. He shall bring fire down from the sky, and the earth shall be poisoned, and the waters shall be made bitter, and the air shall be made unclean. Where ten once stood, one shall live. He shall raise up the nations under his iron rod and place upon his head a black crown of seven points, and his kingdom shall last for all the age to come.\n\nWoe to ye, O princes, who have walked so proud upon the earth. Woe to ye, O nations, who have debased yourselves in beastly ignorance and abandoned the Highest Law. Should ye make sacrifice of empires, it shall avail ye not. Should ye pass ten thousand through the fire, it shall avail ye not. His servants already walk among the nations; hidden from sight, they prepare the way. Already, the noose is knotted; already, the blade is sharpened.\n\nWoe to ye, O, princes; the hour is close at hand.\n\nSo declares ê§å - ê§ã - ê§ä. So shall it be.\n[[/div]]\nMessage tagged high priority due to content irregularity: SCP-089 did not provide instructions for Procedure M8 nor demand its completion. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nWhile initial estimates placed the construction of SCP-089 to the 2nd Century BCE, the historical and archaeological discrepancies surrounding the item indicate a much more recent date of construction.\n* The precise etymology and context of Moloch / Molech remains obscure, but comparisons of its usage in the Tanakh with Punic inscriptions have led most modern scholars to believe that it was not the name of a deity, but the specific name for a type of child sacrifice.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]No primary textual accounts of Punic religious rites exist; archaeological evidence from tophet sites indicates the burning of human infants, lambs, and other animals on open-air pyres, but it is unknown, how often child sacrifices were made, under what circumstances they would be made, or how many of these infants were actively sacrificed versus how many died of natural deaths. Inscriptions found at tophet sites do not mention the infants at all, focusing instead on praise to Baal Hammon and indicating the sacrifice of votive offerings.[[/span]]\n* The earliest association of Punic child sacrifice and a statue with outstretched arms comes from the work of Cleitarchus in the 3rd century BCE, where it is described as an idol of Kronus (the //interpretatio graeca// of Baal Hammon); The image of a bull-headed deity is an innovation of the Middle Ages, first appearing in the Midrash Tanhuma in the 8th-9th century.\n* Interpretations of Moloch as a demon or independent deity do not gain widespread popularity until the early modern period; the character appears in //Paradise Lost// as a fallen angel, but is absent from the major grimoires of the preceding centuries.\n* The earliest concrete attestation of SCP-089 dates to 1635, when it was in possession of the Black Rose[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A society of Austrian occultists under the patronage of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, formed to rival the Knights of St. George (for whom Ferdinand held a deep but unspecified hatred). A branch of the Rose would later form the core of the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Commission on Transgressive Occurrences (a signatory of the FCC and Foundation predecessor) while the remainder would defect to the Allied Occult Initiative during the Second World War. The last members would die during Operation ANTECEDENT in 1944, and a decade later would be implicated in the death of an apparent thaumarch in the leaked UNPSC documentation of LTE-0913-Ex-Machina.[[/span]]; no earlier provenance can be established.\n\nOpportunities for direct study of SCP-089 ended after it was rendered inactive during HECATOMB Incident in 2014. Post-incident questioning with Horizon Initiative Shepherd Mary-Ann Lewitt revealed no additional information on the nature of the SCP-089 entity, its history, or its associated anomalous phenomena; Lewitt consistently rejected requests for follow-up interviews.\n\nPost-incident investigation of the Daevite-era SCP-610 containment site believed to be the subject of SCP-089‚Äôs final locution revealed that, while the external seals were heavily degraded from increased environmental temperatures and liable to fail within months, the contained vector was already long dead. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/9| Previous]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/11| Next]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
