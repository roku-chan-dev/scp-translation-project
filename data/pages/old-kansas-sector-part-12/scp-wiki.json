Laugh is GOOD. Laugh is amazing, happy, good feelings and good time for ANYONE to see or have. Why is Laugh not good in the year of August 2119 After Death? Why don't I get appreciated on television anymore? Well nobody really knows, I can only speculate. Ratings fell off a LOT in 2014. A LOT of normal and good people like me stopped watching my show.\n\nScenario that you can imagine: Be me. Be a very residual spawn sibling, but have no excess fluids. Be a producer, host, and work a long time making underground shows. Be me and make a lot of underground shows in the style that does the \"human humor\". Be me and get criticized for making monkey shows. I don't care that they called me \"street organist\". Does you ever seen the human street organist use dead monkeys? No. I made it fun.\n\nListen I know I'm not being born on Earth right?  I just have been enjoying and watching human humor programs since the television. Human culture is my culture, and I learned human language from watching the human programs. Wisconsin Public Broadcasting. Youtube. CNN. Animal Planet. The Learning Channel. I have seen all of the Partridge Family episodes and know all of the words. \"Hey reuben come here and go away\". haha\n\nBall world is my home because the Klein world is stupid. Klein world is random - the human ball world is a better format. Klein world says the ball world is \"normal\", like that's the worst thing ever, and now klein world is flooding into ball world when they didn't even like it. but I DID. They are Hippocrates? i think so.\n\nSO THAT IS WHY no one coming in, my ball world place, no random, no crazy stuff. If HUMAN want to come in, they can send me a private message my user name is WarmJuicyMan@msn.com or ExoticOrthodontist on skype. If you are interested in my body of work just ask and I can DIRECT send you new episodes. I have to send them direct or the fuck people will confiscate them. I think they will. It hasn't happened in a while, but I am very protective of my work. I don't like to produce an episode and then the fucks take it. You put all that funny stuff on the disc, and one of them dumb white shirt fucks takes it away. I don't stop making episodes because I run out of ideas, or like critics say \"Is just all exploding and growths Laughy, is the same thing every time Laughy.\" That is not the case. The former is the case, the fucks, I am scared of them take it away.\n\nIt makes me for real angry. My slug fuck spawn sibling come here in their ugly human costume, and they makes all these very many terrabytes of human sex tapes. GROSS! But the fucks don't take their stuff away. No. They think my stuff is bad because it makes you feel good and happy. No, my spawnsib gets stabbed 3000 times on the internet for all the people to see and massage to and that's for some reason okay.\n\nI'm just kidding I'm not mad though. :) I am very good at the ironic style of humor.\n\nI wrote this episode last night. Hard to find people who watch my show now, but, I am glad my subscribers still want episodes. \n\n,,*Ignore the girl at the end, that is an actor actually, I paid her to say self mean things about me. I know it's weird thing but not like that.,,\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/old-kansas-sector-part-12/Untitled.png]]\n\n**Old Kansas Sector - NIGHT**\n\nFour guys including small furry guy and girl guy in \nhelicopter.  Girl guy is SAD, helicopter pilot looks \nat girl guy like he is THIRSTY. Small FURRY guy \nlooks out of helicopter with long tongue. \n\nThe group hear a loud bubble pop type of noise. \nCORPSE appear in helicopter. FURRY guy looks at \nthe new dead man next to CLEF and begins to panic. \nSWEATS come out of KAIN's feet!\n\n\n,,//**KAIN** (4), Cream color, Japanese style of dog.

Hides his face with a hat or photo shop.//,,\n\nCLEF Wakes up from dreams because the quadruped \nis talking. Looks at dead  guy next to him in helicopter. \nQuickly pulls his gun and ducks to opposite corner of \nhelicopter interior. He licks his lips and looks at the \nKAIN nervously.\n\n> [[=]]\n> **CLEF**\n> Seven, land the helicopter. \n> \n> (//slaps the brim of Seven's hat//) Shit, no, don't look. Fly the fucking helicopter.\n> \n> Hey, isn't that the kid I killed?\n> [[/=]]\n\nDead MAN begins to BLOAT. Loud and squishy noises as \nanother dead man come out of the behind of the first \ndead man. (//laugh track//) GERSHA turns to look at \ndead man. CLOSE UP of GERSHA's reaction!\n\n,,//**GERSHA** (22), BRIGHT yellow teeth, can see ALL skin veins. Fun exotic matted hair style.//,,\n\n> [[=]]\n> **GERSHA**\n> Oh my god! (//laughing and snort//)\n> [[/=]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> **CLEF**\n> (CLEF looks at GERSHA) No. NO. What the fuck is wrong with you? \n> [[/=]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> **GERSHA**\n> It's jut like on TV!\n> [[/=]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> **CLEF**\n> Jesus fucking Christ.\n> [[/=]]\n\nCLEF shakes his head and looks at GERSHA like she is blurry.\n\nANOTHER loud pop bubble noise and more dead man come out\nof the dead mens. Now there are four dead men. THREE comes\nout of the front of 1. FOUR comes out of the back hole of 2.\n(Special fart noise and smell-o-vision when this happens.)\n\n> [[=]]\n> **CLEF**\n> Too much weight. Seven, Fucking drop it down anywhere, I don't care.\n> [[/=]]\n\n,,//**KONDRAKI** (4), BIG and ROUND, wears a smaller hat than CLEF.//,,\n\n> [[=]]\n> **KONDRAKI**\n> Can't, dead zone. Nothing beneath us. There's nothing as far as I can see.\n> \n> Shit. \n> \n> We're losing altitude anyway.\n> [[/=]]\n\nFOUR loud bubble pops. Now there are EIGHT dead mens. This \nexceeds the weight limit for the helicopter by 600 pounds! \nHelicopter begins wobbling! CLEF grabs a safety chute and \ndives out of the window.\n(laugh track)\n\n> [[=]]\n> **GERSHA**\n> (shouting) Hey! I know we're on the show, come out now!\n> [[/=]]\n\nHelicopter falls into nothing. Dead bodies slide and shuffle all\naround the helicopter as it spins around! KONDRAKI accidentally \ndoes a kiss on one of the CORPSE cheeks.\n(aww track)\n\n> [[=]]\n> **KONDRAKI**\n> (screaming)\n> [[/=]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> **KAIN**\n> (barking)\n> [[/=]]\n\n**FINALE:** BIGGEST pop noise. Laughy McLaugheson come out of\nfront of CORPSE mouth hole. Close up camera view on Laughy's suit.\nLAUGHY walk across spinning helicopter and hold microphone to \nGERSHA. Scene freeze!\n\n> [[=]]\n> **McLaugherson**\n> So, what do you think?\n> [[/=]]\n\n> [[=]]\n> **Gersha**\n> Hi! Oh my god it's Laughy, holy shit. Umm, this is awkward, I mean. Fuck, you're Laughy... Holy shit. \n> \n> I loved your old shows!\n> [[/=]]\n\nMcLaugherson doesn't say ANYTHING for ten seconds.\n\n> [[=]]\n> **McLaugherson**\n> New shows are good too!\n> [[/=]]\n\nGersha smile WEIRD at camera.\n\n[[<]]\n<< [[[old-kansas-sector-part-11 |Old Kansas Sector: Part 11]]]\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[[old-kansas-sector-part-13 |Old Kansas Sector: Part 13]]] >>\n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\n**| [[[Rat's Nest Hub| Hub]]] |**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=faminepulse]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Untitled.png\n> **Author:** [[*user faminepulse]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/old-kansas-sector-part-12 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
