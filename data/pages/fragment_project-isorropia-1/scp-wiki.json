Project Isorropía is intended for research staff to propose containment cycles for such entities or phenomena. Personnel are reminded to append their name or codename to their proposals.\n\n+++ Researchers who wish to submit a new entry should use the following link **[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:project-isorropia-1|here]]]**.\n\n||~ SCP Designation||~ SCP Designation||~ Containment Method||\n||[[[SCP-7792]]] - A hole in reality indistinguishable from Dir. Rudolf Lingrens.||[[[SCP-5667]]] - Foundation Researcher Bill Marlow. Marlow remembers being born. || SCP-7792 consumes Marlow’s memory of being born. Following this, Dir. Lingrens is reborn. He does not remember. {{-Dr. Neil Leinnes}}||\n||[[[SCP-2200|SCP-2200-1]]] - A sword composed of an alloy of silver and copper, estimated to have been constructed between 1,000 and 500 BCE. It will autonomously relocate and bond to a selected human, now designated SCP-2200-2, who will inevitably use SCP-2200 to take the lives of other humans. Afterwards, a likeness of the individual containing the personality and memories of the original, an instance of SCP-2200-4, is formed out of an anomalous, silver-based alloy within the area classified as SCP-2200-3. ||[[[SCP-5140]]] - A number of frozen corpses located on Mt. Everest that absorb the heat of anything they make physical contact with instantly, lowering the subject's temperature to 10°C. Any individuals that expire during this process become another instance of SCP-5140.||Upon the death of the previous SCP-2200-2, SCP-2200-1 relocated.  At the same time, all living SCP-2200-4 instances abandoned SCP-2200-3 and promptly ceased animation. Video recordings captured instances screaming of \"the cold grip of death.\" No new instances of SCP-2200-4 have appeared. SCP-2200-1 was later discovered at the peak of Mt. Everest, standing upright with its blade driven into the mountain's surface. A thick layer of ice has formed around the entirety of SCP-2200-1 and it has not relocated since. All SCP-5140 instances have been found to no longer anomalously absorb heat energy and have undergone advanced decay. A misinformation campaign is in progress to cover-up the large amount of silver that is now found to make up Mt. Everest. The identity of the new SCP-2200-2, if one exists, is currently [[[SCP-1529|under investigation]]]. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-5541]]] - A temporally certain outcome expressed throughout all future timelines that will be observed by the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department. In all observed timelines, the SCP Foundation's infrastructure is completely destroyed resulting in the world becoming aware of anomalies. Anomalies will progressively be accepted into society issuing in an era of peace and prosperity until a QK-Class \"Quantum Degeneracy\" End-of-World Scenario occurs and all life on the planet ceases to exist. It is believed that the anomaly manifested when the Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department discovered it and traveled back in time to prevent its creation, creating a closed-loop temporal paradox.||[[[SCP-7011]]] - A highly augmented anomalous supercomputer, formally known as the Artificial Local-Intelligence Clairvoyance Engine (ALICE), capable of predicting all possible future outcomes of events in a given area. It uses this predictive ability along with making micro-reality alterations to guide events to the outcome it calculates as most beneficial. SCP-7011 is currently using these abilities to manipulate the entirety of the town of Joseph, Oregon. ||SCP-7011's artificial intelligence conscript was given access to superior hardware to drastically increase its processing power, its reality altering capabilities, and the range of its localized omniscience. With these improvements, SCP-7011 was able to discover SCP-5541 and recognize the threat it posed to humanity. SCP-7011 is continuously altering reality in minor ways, imperceptible to the general public, to prevent RCT-Δt from creating SCP-5541. However, due to the closed-loop nature of SCP-5541, SCP-7011 is only able to perpetually delay its creation. SCP-7011 has dedicated itself entirely to delaying SCP-5541's creation and its effects on current baseline reality have been deemed negligible. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-6183]]]-C - A methodology for deletion of anomalies from reality using their own documentation.|| [[[SCP-2786]]] - A narrative-based reality-warping bipedal humanoid who identifies as a hero archetype and is partially susceptible to containment within looping monomyths. || Slot vacated, relevant reference pointers severed from all blackbox sectors of the Database; {{HERO}} successfully deleted. Two minutes later, an arm manifested within the chamber and displayed a rude hand gesture, dematerializing moments later. All communications with the Department of Deletions have since ceased. {{HERO}} considered neutralized within our reality. Unknown consequence for whitespace sectors. - {{Dir. Genevieve}} || \n||[[[SCP-6000]]] - The largest Class-W transportation gateway, colloquially known as a Way, ever encountered by the Foundation. It is growing at an unstable rate and is transforming all it makes contact with into a section of the extradimensional location known as the Wanderer's Library. ||[[[SCP-2602|SCP-2602, which used to be a library]]] - A building that used to be a library. When communicating any information about SCP-2602, subjects are compelled to make frequent reference to the fact that SCP-2602 used to be a library. Subjects are incapable of communicating, directly or otherwise, any information pertaining to SCP-2602's use between its time as a library and the development of its anomalous properties. || SCP-2602, which used to be a section of the Wanderer's Library, was transformed by SCP-6000, a former gateway to the Wanderer's Library. Upon contact, the library status of areas affected by SCP-6000 was changed to former, returning all matter to its form prior to being a section of the Wanderer's Library. SCP-2602, as evidenced by the fact that it used to be a part of the Wanderer's Library, has since dimensionally relocated, which is common for former branches of the Wanderer's Library. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-3856]]] - The probabilistic anomaly surrounding Foundation Researcher Samuel Lloyd and all iterations of him across the multiverse.  The death of Lloyd will always be immediately preceded by a K-Class End-of-the-world scenario. ||[[[SCP-3542]]] - An ontokinetic human that causes emergency events to regularly happen around him before using his abilities to resolve the situation.|| SCP-3542 has become the personal bodyguard of Researcher Lloyd.  The probabilistic effects of both anomalies have become intertwined resulting in SCP-3542 preventing the onset of any K-Class scenarios resulting from SCP-3856.  SCP-3542 has expressed great pleasure in being a \"world-saving superhero\" and has not interfered with other Foundation personnel.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-1537]]] - A language associated with a group identified as \"The Brothers of Akul'hil\" which demonstrates no connection to or similarities with any known terrestrial language.  It contains a phrase, SCP-1537-1, which, when spoken aloud, produces an anomalous reaction in human beings that perceive it. ||[[[SCP-5404]]] - An anomalous phenomenon resulting in explosions when specific words are conveyed through speech or other mediums. || Words formerly infected by SCP-5404 were spoken by a subject demonstrating the SCP-1537-B reaction.  This resulted in the SCP-5404 anomaly transferring to equivalent words in the SCP-1537 language, including onto SCP-1537-1. Usage of the SCP-1537-1 phrase invariably results in spontaneous detonation. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-3005]]] - A malfunctioning Scranton Reality Anchor that is continuously altering nearby reality to resemble that of the Fifth World.  Humans exposed to this local reality for extended periods of time become dangerously obsessed with it.||[[[SCP-2821]]] - A spherical spatial anomaly, believed to be a true vacuum, which erratically changes its size at the speed of light.  A mass of rapidly flashing colors, denoted SCP-2821-2, remains in the center of this sphere.  Radio transmissions from an unknown source occasionally originate from the anomaly.|| SCP-3005 is relocated to the center of SCP-2821.  As SCP-2821's physical laws are completely different from the rest of the universe, SCP-3005's effects treat it as its own universe and only alter its reality.  The fundamental laws inside of SCP-2821 have become illogical and self-contradicting causing it to be unable to induce vacuum decay outside matter it contacts.  SCP-2821-2 has since rearranged itself in the form of a 5th-dimensional hypersphere and all radio transmissions have ceased.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-096 |SCP-███]]] - A tall and thin humanoid. When SCP-███’s face is observed, no matter the size or portion of it, SCP-███ will kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] the observer. SCP-███ can not be stopped by any means, and photographs will also trigger SCP-███. The only known method of safe observation is artistic depictions of SCP-███’s face.||[[[SCP-2148]]] - A human male who filters anything he commits to memory by covering it in black bars.|| SCP-2148 is introduced to SCP-███, and sees its face. Since this incident, SCP-███ is docile and has had its object class downgraded to Safe, while SCP-2148 [DATA EXPUNGED] {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||\n||[[[SCP-3309]]] - The retroactive disappearance of certain anomalies and their respective documentation, theoretically caused by [DATA EXPUNGED]||[[[SCP-3999]]] - TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN TALLORAN [DATA EXPUNGED]|| There is war above me, between somebody who hates me and the ones who hate his work.

SCP-1548 is currently protecting Earth from outer-universal threats. || [[[shaggydredlocks-proposal | SCP-001-LOCKE]]] - The solar singularity, an event where our solar system’s sun begins transforming all individuals exposed to sunlight into hostile entities, designated SCP-001-A. || Recent observations show that the sun is currently in a state of ‘indecisiveness’ regarding its motives. As such, neither SCP-1548 or SCP-001-LOCKE occur. Note that if the sun ever settles on a decision between the two, this containment method will ultimately have failed. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||\n||[[[SCP-1504]]] - --An unremarkable caucasian male who is unable to be harmed.-- A Caucasian male who is unable to be harmed or perceived correctly, instead appearing to act within the expected behavior of the current situation. SCP-1504 is currently uncontained. ||[[[SCP-3852]]] - A phenomenon in which an anomalous cadaver manifests in a small community, leading to the lynching of an individual accused of the murder. || SCP-1504 is found hiding within a house in the town of ██████. He is currently being hunted by the entire population of the town, presumably because of an SCP-3852 event. SCP-3852 events have not occurred since, and this event is currently ongoing due to SCP-1504’s antimemetic properties and invincibility. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||\n||[[[SCP-4068]]] - OUTSOURCE YOUR VIRAL SYNERGIES ||[[[SCP-2535]]] - Ha! What a ride, eh folks? We've seen printers that eat, eaters that print, and everything in between! || SCP-2535 has been 'infected' by SCP-4068, leading to it eventually ‘spreading’ to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2030 SCP-2030] for unknown reasons. The show's title is now \"Chuckles are Profitable\" and SCP-2030-1 has freed all five former employees of SCP-2535 due to his new need to rehabilitate from his 'corporative conundrum.’ {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||\n||**[[[SCP-4494]]]** - **THE SPECTRE**, a shadowy humanoid who embodies the concept of justice, making containment impossible. **SCP-4494** enjoys video games. ||[[[SCP-7400]]] - A probabilistic beaurocratohazard surrounding the online game //League of Legends//, criminalizing its players. || **SCP-4494** is informed of //League of Legends// without being told of its anomalous property. He did not appear again until █ days later, at which time he resurfaced posessing //League of Legends// merchandise. **SCP-4494** has, because of this, been separated from the concept of justice and contained, while SCP-7400’s effect has been reduced drastically and acts as a form of internet meme. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||\n||[[[SCP-913]]] - A middle-aged African-American man. If SCP-913 is not fed the daily caloric intake of a regular human every 2 hours, they will enter a trance state where they will eat through anything in sight. ||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/long-live-the-king Undesignated Anomaly #304024932904] - Dr. Everett King, a Foundation researcher who manifests non-anomalous appleseeds against his own will. || SCP-913 remains within 20ft of Dr. King at all times, as Dr. King's anomalous property infinitely satisfies SCP-913's requirement to devour food. Dr. King has expressed pleasure at 'watching those stupid fuckers die'. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} || \n||[[[SCP-2662]]] - A vaguely humanoid, cognitohazardous entity. Subjects exposed to the entity for 6 months or longer can become compelled to fulfill its every need. At least once a month, new religious followings are spontaneously generated centered on the entity, much to its distress.||[[[SCP-2456]]] - A memetic parasite that is present in an estimated 0.7% of the human population which can result in them creating and preaching a new religion. This religion transfers the memetic parasite to those to whom are preached and possesses a reality-warping effect that grows in relation to the number of followers. On rare occasions, written information about this religion triggers a powerful anti-meme which imperfectly erases the reader from existence and memory. || An active α-instance became a member of a cult spontaneously generated by SCP-2662. This member quickly rose to become the leader of the religious movement and incorporated SCP-2662 into an instance of SCP-2456-1, converting the other members into β-instances. These instances then made contact with SCP-2662 and presented it with a γ-instance as a form of worship, quickly infecting SCP-2662 with SCP-2456-2. However, due to the reality warping effects of the β-instances combined with their intense need to protect SCP-2662, SCP-2662 was not erased. Instead, all members of the cult had their memories of SCP-2662 and SCP-2456-1 erased completely. Any religions that have since formed as a result of either anomaly quickly implemented the other as well leading to their quick erasure from the minds of the infected. SCP-2662 has expressed great pleasure in this outcome.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-4004]]] - A device constructed by the American Secure Containment Initiative to serve the interests of the United States of America. It is operated by a Class-6 ontokinetic humanoid entity which directly influences consensus reality by way of noosphere alteration. Formerly, abilities were used to spread pro-American ideas, but the entity has since begun calling for the complete deconstruction of the USA.||[[[SCP-4200]]] - The collective designation of --3-- 2 humans who became merged with consensus reality. They continuously manipulate the actions and thoughts of people as well physical entities to promote the growth of the United States of America and its interests.||Both anomalies are engaged in a sociopolitico-kinetic debate with each other inside of the noosphere. Whenever either anomaly projects any idea into consensus reality, they are quickly \"rebutted\" by the other. Due to their contrary beliefs on the future of the USA, no consensus has been reached.  {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-4007]]] - The collective designation for 5 anomalous individuals who served in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Of the original 5, only 2 are believed to still be alive and are currently at large.

Of the original 7, only --2-- 3 are believed to still be alive with one in Foundation custody and the other 2 currently at large. || Foundation liaisons have formed an agreement with the remaining instances of SCP-4007 and SCP-5700. SCP-5700-1,-4, and -7 have taken up the former roles and positions of SCP-4007-1,-2, and -3, thus upkeeping the ritual for the indefinite future.

Victims' bodies exhibit severe compound fractures that are healed by the generation of excessive cartilage and osseous tissue resulting in gross deformations and elongation. ||[[[SCP-957]]] - A humanoid entity that relocates to houses inhabited by a single human. The entity anomalously manipulates this human to serve them and to lure in other humans. Lured humans will be encompassed in a spherical barrier before being deconstructed by SCP-957 and similar entities. || SCP-957 relocated to the home of a human that was being targeted by SCP-783. Upon the manifestation of SCP-783 in the home, SCP-957 approached and surrounded both in the spherical barrier. To date, this barrier has not demanifested and has taken on a distorted appearance. Screams can be continuously heard from an unknown source and the elongated bodies of SCP-957 individuals occasionally fall out of the barrier before promptly being pulled back in. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n||[[[SCP-3002]]] - A sentient and contagious noospheric construct taking the form of an anomalous memory in those infected by it. These memories will take the form of a childhood friend named “Lily Veselka” and will gradually infect all of the victim’s memories until they are all fully converted, at which point any information discussed by the infected individual will serve as a vector for transmission. || [[[SCP-1500]]] - A featureless humanoid with greenish-gray skin. All human beings who encounter SCP-1500 will perceive it as a childhood friend or relative, and will obtain falsified memories to support this. || An individual infected by SCP-3002 was introduced to SCP-1500. Following this, SCP-1500 and SCP-3002 have been engaging in a “fight” inside the noosphere. Any memories SCP-3002 alters will be quickly reverted by SCP-1500, and vice versa. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}} ||\n|| [[[SCP-6558]]] - A phenomenon where a reference to the SCP-6558 slot manifests on any other SCiPnet pages. The affected documentation will refer to the SCP-6558 page with unconventional designations. Since its discovery, the descriptions relating to it have gotten increasingly coherent and relevant. || [[[SCP-6289]]] - A file titled \"priest.exe\", appearing as a 4.8 MB executable file. The file resembles a priest standing atop a pillar in an empty room. When SCP-6289 is placed within any folder, the folder itself and all files within become password protected. Any incorrect password leads to the user or their computer being damaged. || SCP-6558 and all infected documents are placed within a folder and modified by SCP-6289.

SCP-7403 transfers ownership and allows renovation into a full-fledged fast food restaurant. || [[[SCP-7001]]] - Site-19, the largest secure Foundation site. SCP-7001 manifests in randomized locations. || SCP-7001 has manifested in SCP-7403, generating containment specialists and MTF which continually ‘raid’ instances and forcefully restore ownership to the original owner. SCP-7001 has not targeted any buildings which are not instances of SCP-7403. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||\n|| [[[SCP-7084]]] - An anomalous phenomena. When the Foundation uses a significant amount of monetary resources, tax papers manifest within the related departments. || [[[SCP-5170]]] - A nonexistent person named Josephus Blake. SCP-5170 has a notable amount of power over the United States legal system. || SCP-7084 manifestations were signed using the name \"Josephus Blake\" and data theorized to be related. Further instances of SCP-5170 have been stigmatized and relatively ignored by the general public. Reports of SCP-5170 being arrested for tax fraud have recently surfaced. SCP-7084 has since manifested primarily for the United States government. ||\n|| [[[SCP-6820]]] - An eigenweapon designed to neutralize an unknown anomaly. As of recently, SCP-6820 has begun to deviate in behavior. || [[[SCP-7579]]] - An incredibly powerful artificial intelligence with antimemetic properties. || SCP-7579 has been made aware of SCP-6820, which it expressed great interest in visiting. By unknown means, SCP-7579 downloads itself into SCP-6820, and due to the similar levels of power observed in both anomalies, SCP-6820 is unable to remove it.

Undesignated Anomaly #73736327736 has been transported to the noosphere because of this, but cannot interfere with human comprehension or become a deific threat due to its own infovorous nature. Additionally, Undesignated Anomaly #73736327736 has seemingly located Humanity's deific construct and is constantly attempting to feed from it. The effects from Undesignated Anomaly #73736327736's predation on humanity have proven to be minimal and easily mitigated by the construct, as it possesses the ability to evade Undesignated Anomaly #73736327736 and heal itself. {{- Dr. Ufin Une}}||\n|| [[[SCP-2316]]] -  A lake in which individuals can perceive multiple drowning humanoids.

The instance of SCP-7450 then proceeded to follow SCP-6096 in an attempt to reassert control over its followers. SCP-6096 eventually crossed paths with the three other instances of SCP-7450, which are now relentlessly attempting to harm it, to no avail.

The original text will not disappear, but will remain hidden among the information posted by SCP-027-PT according to the possibilities of where the original text was written. ## || [[size 500%]]friend[[/size]] [[image https://borradores-scp-es-2.wdfiles.com/local--files/yonkou/Polish_20250416_003510858.png]] {{ - Alexander Cuco}}||\n||[[[SCP-3004|SCP-3004-1]]] - A Level-6 Pistiphage[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Faith-eater[[/span]] Entity living in a dimension located 'above' our own. This entity sees itself as the Abrahamic God and draws faith from our world by the initiation of ritualistic events, primarily parodies of Christian traditions involving cicadas. Should the entity gather enough faith it will be able to manifest in our reality, which due to the brutal nature of its influence, would lead to an XK scenario.|| [[[http://scp-es.com/scp-es-110#|SCP-ES-110]]] - A theoretical deific entity that is the hypothetical origin of SCP-ES-110-1 and the object of worship of SCP-ES-110-2.  SCP-ES-110-1 is a species of moss that decomposes inorganic matter through alterations to reality, feeding unusually quickly on objects related to the concept of divinity || Following the successful erasure of ##FCFCFC|Christianity## from the historical record, SCP-3004-1 latched onto SCP-ES-110-2 as a source of worship. Every member of SCP-ES-110-2 has died either due to being devoured by SCP-ES-110-1 or by the SCP-3004-2 entities. Attempts to use Proyect SIGHTSEE-LUX to observe SCP-3004-1 have only seen what has been described as \"a massive bug trapped in a cocoon of moss.\" {{- Alexander Cuco}} || \n||[[[SCP-770]]] - A strain of mould that is similar in appearance to the common Physarum polycephalum that respires by means of a poorly understood nuclear reaction. During the process SCP-770 will emit significant quantities of ionising radiation and copious amounts of heat achieving a surface temperature in excess of 1200 degrees centigrade.||[[[SCP-2966]]] - An anomalous roll of █████ brand toilet paper. SCP-2966 is capable of producing infinite sheets of highly effective toilet paper. However, SCP-2966 adheres to the Laws of Conservation. If more or less than 8 sheets of toilet paper are removed from the roll within 24 hours, SCP-2966 will siphon or release large amounts of thermal energy in its surroundings.|| SCP-770 is allowed to grow over SCP-2966. When SCP-770 starts its nuclear reaction the heat emitted destroys SCP-2966 causing it to absorb SCP-770's energy stopping the reaction. When SCP-2966 starts releasing its energy it's absorbed by SCP-770 who then starts its nuclear reaction. {{- Alexander Cuco}}||\n||[[[SCP-902]]] - A box roughly the size of an adult human head. SCP-902 emits what has been described as a 'ticking' sound. Anyone who becomes aware of SCP-902 becomes convinced that whatever is in the box is horribly dangerous, and needs to be destroyed as soon as it finishes counting down || [[[SCP-___-J]]] - A rock that makes you procrastinate || {{I'll worry about it latter. - Alexander Cuco}} ||\n||[[[SCP-2522]]] - An anomalous, hostile, artificially intelligent utility, nicknamed Hatbot, originally developed for the Site-19 Computer Intelligence sub-division in conjunction with the AIAD in the mid 2000's in order to create an interface with which to communicate in a comprehensible way with computer-based anomalies.||[[[SCP-2701]]] - Cell 667 in the former ███████ State Penitentiary located in Pennsylvania A clipboard containing forms marked as \"INTAKE\" is located to the left of the entrance to SCP-2701. When a single human subject is fully locked within SCP-2701, their name and a day, month and year are written on the clipboard the subject will disappear. At 12:00 AM on the written date the subject will reappear within SCP-2701. Subjects who undergo an activation event experience a state of complete sensory deprivation while fully conscious. For the duration of the disappearance period, a subject will perceive time at a significantly dilated rate, estimated to be between 300× and 400× in magnitude. || SCP-2522 is introduced into SCP-2701 for 15 minutes. After reappearing SCP-2701 said \"{{good good fnaly silence alone more more}}\". SCP-2522 was reintroduced with the date of release stated as 12/4/300000. {{ - Alexander Cuco}}||\n\n\n\n\n\n[!-- CSS for mobile layout below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere it is! --]\n[[module css]]\n@supports (display:grid) {\n@media only screen and (max-width:880px) {\n    #page-content table tr {\n        display:grid;\n        grid-template-areas:\n            \"one two\"\n            \"result result\";\n        grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;\n        margin-bottom:1rem;\n    }\n\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1) {grid-area:one}\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) {grid-area:two}\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3) {grid-area:result}\n\n    #page-content table tr > td {\n        padding:.75em;\n        font-size:1.05em;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr:first-child {display:none}\n\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1),\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) {\n        border-bottom-width:0;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) {\n        border-left-width:0;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1)::before,\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2)::before {\n        display:flex;\n        box-sizing:border-box;\n        width:100%;\n\n        content:'SCP Designation';\n        align-items:center;\n        justify-content:center;\n        font-weight:bold;\n        font-size:85%;\n        background-color:#eee;\n\n        padding:.75em;\n        margin-bottom:.35rem;\n    }\n\n   #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3) {\n        position:relative;\n        padding-left:7.35rem;\n        min-height:3rem;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3)::before {\n        display:flex;\n        position:absolute;\n        left:.75em;\n        box-sizing:border-box;\n\n        content:'Containment Method';\n        align-items:center;\n        justify-content:center;\n        text-align:center;\n        font-weight:bold;\n        font-size:85%;\n        background-color:#eee;\n\n        width:6rem;\n        height:calc(100% - 1.75em);\n        padding:.5em;\n    }\n}\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[!-- The collaborative stuff is up there, do not touch the CSS pls--]",
