Civilians who witnessed the effects of SCP-5939 need to be administered Class B amnestics.\n\nAfter SCP-5939's reclassification to Neutralized, the graveyard in which it was located was purchased by the Foundation. It has been repurposed as an area where personnel of level 3 and higher without a significant other are buried.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Rose|caption=A bloomed instance of SCP-5939.|width=250px|align=right]]\n**Description:** SCP-5939 is the designation given to the black roses[[footnote]]Which species match with the //Rosa// 'Precious Platinum' a.k.a. the hybrid tea rose.[[/footnote]] that grew on the grave of SCP-5939-1.\n\nWhen an individual approached or attempted to communicate with the grave, a rose grew and produced dew drops. Upon falling, these spread out and formed a message as if they were made from ink. After an individual read the message, it would quickly fade, and the rose would rapidly decay and be reabsorbed into the soil. It was unknown how much of its surroundings SCP-5939-1 could perceive, but it could hear in a radius of approximately 50 meters and feel direct interaction with its grave.\n\nSCP-5939-1 referred to Catherine Hall who was a level 4 researcher on [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations Biological Containment Site-103]. During a containment breach, SCP-5939-1 was amongst the 14 casualties. Its research was specified in floriculture and cross-breeding plants. In its private life, it cultivated roses and used ink during the early stages of growth to give them a black pigment. SCP-5939-1 often wore one of these roses as a hair ornament. The roses that grew on the grave matched the description of the ornament initially found on its corpse.\n\nOn 05/06/2018, O5-2 buried SCP-5939-1 after insisting on a private ceremony. Whilst involvement for personal reasons is normally contested by the O5-Council, this did not occur due to O5-2 being specialized in termination practices and the initial burial covered all traces of the Foundation.\n\n**Discovery:** On 06/06/2018, Hendrick Doyle, a man of 76 years of age who regularly comes to visit his wife's grave reported strange writing on the grave of SCP-5939-1. An instance of SCP-5939 had grown out of the gravestone, bloomed, and formed the following message.\n[[=]]\n> [[span style=\"font-family:dancing script;\"]][[size 150%]]//Could you clean my gravestone, please?//[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\nMr. Doyle was administered a Class B amnestic by an emergency-appointed Foundation agent. The  grave of SCP-5939-1 was cleaned and emergency containment procedures were established.\n\n+ **Addendum-1: Memorandums**\nOn 11/06/2018 05-2 came back to the grave after he had taken over the file of SCP-5939. O5-2 and SCP-5939-1 had the following conversation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **INTERVIEW LOG 5939-1**\n----\n**Date:** 11/06/2018\n\n**Interviewer:** O5-2\n**Interviewee:** SCP-5939-1\n----\n[[=]]\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family:dancing script;\"]][[size 150%]]//Hey Simon, I'm so glad to see you again!//[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n**O5-2:** Catherine...

An internal investigation was carried out on the command of the remaining members of the O5-Council. On 24/06/2018 O5-4 shared the following document.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFFFFE; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#EDEDED; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 5px; box-shadow: 0 1px 1px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **Vote on: Own-Initiative-Procedure-5939**\n[[/=]]\n----\n@@     @@**Date: 24/06/2018**\n@@     @@**Related Anomalies: SCP-5939**\n----\n[[/div]]\n++++ Results Internal Investigation on SCP-5939\nIt has come to the Council's attention that the file of SCP-5939 has not been completely transparent to all level 5 personnel. Whilst this is not a necessity for all files, and can even provide extra security measures, the file of SCP-5939 currently is not proven significant enough for these measures.\n\nEvery anomaly ideally must be researched from an objective perspective and not for personal purposes. However, the results of our investigation show that SCP-5939-1 was a level 4 staff member who had access to classified information and ties to O5-2.\n\nIt is therefore believed that O5-2 has not acted in the best interest of the Foundation but rather out of personal interest.\n\nWithout more information and the potential threat that SCP-5939-1 becomes a target from Groups of Interest, the Council needs to deliberate on the next course of action.\n----\n++++ Proposal for Own-Initiative-Procedure\nO5-8 has proposed to visit the remains of SCP-5939-1 with a standard team of field agents and researchers since it is unclear what the anomaly is capable of. The objective is to get footage and field samples if possible. O5-8 himself is willing to do a forensic analysis on-site if deemed necessary.\n[[=]]\nPlease vote in the table below.\n[[/=]]\n||~ In Favor ||~ Abstained ||~ Against||\n||  @@ @@ ||  @@ @@ ||  @@ @@ ||\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** O5-1, O5-3, O5-4, and 7 others\n**From:** O5-8\n**Subject:** Voting Results\n[[/div]]\n------\nFellow Council Members,\n\nThe results of the vote have been collected.

SCP-5939-1 even cooperated and suggested a quick forensic analysis itself. However, I was not able to re-establish contact with it afterwards.\n\nIt is possible that SCP-5939 is already neutralized but I'd like confirmation.\n\nWhilst this might be an inconvenience, SCP-5939-1 was assumed dead before this all happened. If SCP-5939 is indeed neutralized all possible leaks are also removed. The only problem would be explaining this to O5-2. We can't even give him back the ring.\n\n- O5-8\n\n**Attachement:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]SCP-5939.jpg.scp[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\nAfter O5-2 visited the grave of SCP-5939-1 again, the following message came through.\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** O5-1, O5-3, O5-4, and 8 others\n**From:** O5-2\n**Subject:** Mind filling me in?\n[[/div]]\n------\nI must admit that I haven't been completely transparent.

O5-2, who could not accept the fact that SCP-5939-1 agreed to cooperate, asked for control of the graveyard. The complete funds were granted to O5-2 by O5-8 as a reconciliation gift.\n\nThe graveyard was repurposed as an area where personnel of level 3 and higher without a partner/significant other are buried. On 05/07/2018 SCP-5939 was classified as Neutralized and [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5939/offset/1|the file of SCP-5939]]] was re-assigned to O5-2.",
