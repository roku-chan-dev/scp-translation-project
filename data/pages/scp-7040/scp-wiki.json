Ltd. 0-4-2ST Narrow-Gauge Steam-Engine (nicknamed 'Talyllyn'). The base of the locomotive is black in colouration, with gold accents on the rims of the cabin windows, headlamp, whistle, and a gold-coloured railing along the boiler and cabin. SCP-7040 is connected to four passenger coaches of similar appearance, each coach has a maximum capacity of 20 persons per carriage. At the date of interest, the conductor was Donald Geddings and the fireman was Douglas Flower. \n\n__**Discovery:**__ SCP-7040 was first reported on November 16th, 1867 after an elderly civilian, Rhys Griffith, reported a Narrow-Gauge Steam-Engine plummeting off the remains of the Dolgoch Viaduct and into the Afon Fathew River near the town of Tywyn, Wales.\n\nConstables Raymond Hughes and Nigel Evans were dispatched to investigate, but the Steam-Engine was not discovered. The next night, Mr. Griffith reported the same event and Constables Hughes and Evans arrived between two-to-four hours later[[footnote]]Accuracy is unclear due to the ageing of the documents.[[/footnote]] with a team of ten labourers to clear any debris. Unable to locate the remains of the Steam-Engine, the two Constables and the team of workers returned to Tywyn, filing Mr. Griffith's claims as a case of mental impairment caused by years of working in the local coal mines and natural degradation of his health due to old age.\n\nFour days later, Mr. Griffith filed another report with Constable Charles Bethell, who was an undercover field agent embedded within Tywyn after Griffith's rumours spread to surrounding towns. \n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Initial Interview\" hide=\"Translated by A.C.E.\"]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.blockquote {\n  border: 1px dashed #999; padding: 0 1em; background-color:#f4f4f4; margin: 1em 40px;\n}\n.blockquote iframe.html-block-iframe{\n  width: initial !important;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n__**Note:**__ The following interview has been translated from traditional Cardiff-Welsh English to standard English.

Could you elaborate?\n\n**Griffith:** I don't remember what day it was, sometime on or about mid-December in '65. Heavy snow in these parts in the late spit of the year. Old Talyllyn was taking the last of the miners home and as they crossed the bridge, it collapsed and took Talyllyn and the miners along with it. \n\n**Bethell:** Were the remains found?\n\n**Griffith:** Not even, I was part of the rescue team the next day after that damned blizzard cleared out.
