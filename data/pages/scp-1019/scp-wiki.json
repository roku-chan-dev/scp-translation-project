Armed guards are to patrol the facility with one being stationed at each known ventilation site and two being positioned outside of the main entry way into SCP-1019.\n\nSCP-1019-A is contained within a standard containment unit. Personnel are not allowed to interact with it following its initial recovery. \n\n**Description:** SCP-1019 is the designation given to an underground facility located in Alcross, Sweden. The facility's layout is almost identical to Site-179's underground component, however numerous wings including D-Class housing and office spaces are inaccessible due to cave-ins.\n \nScans of SCP-1019 for antimemetic, temporal, and cognitohazardous effects are all negative. All other hypotheses as to the creation or manifestation to SCP-1019-A are to be submitted to Research Team Caviidae.\n\nExploration into the Site has also noted the following:\n* Foundation documents noting the locations and containment status of known anomalies previously or currently contained at Site-179 each with varying degrees of accuracy\n* A photo of the previous Site-179 director's daughter in the cafeteria\n* A file containing all D-Class currently present at Site-179\n* Human muscle and adipose cells lining the office walls\n* A bunker component that when scanned was predicted to reach the same depth as Site-179's XK-class bunker\n* A key card owned by Site-179's previous director\n\nSCP-1019-A is the designation given to an amalgamation of several human bodies. All DNA testing preformed on SCP-1019-A has reported inconclusive results. SCP-1019-A has a roughly spherical shape and is only capable of minimal movement. It is able to speak, though it shows no further signs of intelligence. All speech of SCP-1019-A is to be considered incoherent and is to be ignored. \n\n**Recovery:** On 05/31/2032, SCP-1019-A was discovered by an agent in a Keter Wing containment cell. During the encounter all information was lost along with said agent -- with the exception of her clothes, equipment, and weaponry which had been abandoned nearby.\n.\n.\n.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n> {{> does the black moon howl?}}\n\n> {{only when it needs to be heard}}\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n> {{>welcome O5-6}}\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n> {{>O5-7 has one email and one attachment(s)}}\n.\n> {{>open both?}}\n> {{>y/n}}\n.\n. \n> {{yes}}\n.\n.\n> {{>opening}}\n.\n. \n.\n@@ @@\n.\n.\n.\n> {{I know it's your little \"vacation\" right now six, but I'm gonna suggest you return early.
