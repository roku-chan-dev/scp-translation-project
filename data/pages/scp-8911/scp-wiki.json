All personnel stationed at Site-333 are to be briefed on SCP-8911 and must report any instances of the anomaly taking place in their presence.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8911 is an auditory anomaly manifesting at Site-333. Affected personnel report hearing a sound, similar to that of a pre-recorded laugh track used in various popular sitcoms, at seemingly random moments and locations. The source of the anomaly is yet to be traced.\n\n**Addendum 8911.1:** The following is an abridged log of recorded SCP-8911 instances and attempts to intentionally manifest the anomaly.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**23/01/1991:** Dr. Rutherford cuts his finger while examining documents; SCP-8911 is heard in his office for approximately five seconds. The anomaly was reported shortly afterward, and SCP-8911 was classified.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**24/01/1991:** D-1221 is instructed to cut his right index finger with a sheet of paper in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8911 fails to manifest.\n\n**24/01/1991:** D-1221 is instructed to cut his left index finger with a sheet of paper in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8911 fails to manifest.\n\n**24/01/1991:** D-1221 expels flatulence. SCP-8911 is heard for approximately 5 seconds within the testing chamber.\n\n**24/01/1991:** D-1221 is ordered to slip on a banana peel in a controlled environment. D-1221 complies, however, SCP-8911 fails to manifest.\n\n**24/01/1991:** D-1221 is ordered to slip on a banana peel in a controlled environment. D-1221 refuses to comply and is subdued by Guard Newby. After issuing a beating to D-1221, Newby backs away from him and slips on the banana peel. SCP-8911 is heard for approximately 7 seconds within the testing chamber.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**25/02/1991.** Dr. Haaland is informed that his residence has been destroyed by a kitchen fire. SCP-8911 is heard throughout the personnel offices for 15 seconds, alongside loud clapping.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**01/03/1991.** Researcher Quinn is informed of his termination due to unrelated protocol violations. SCP-8911 is heard in the entirety of Site-333, alongside loud clapping and cheering for 20 seconds.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 8911.2:** Following various noise and disruption complaints caused by SCP-8911, Site-333 administration voted on attempting to decommission the anomaly. The ensuing vote resulted in a 5-2-2 score in favor of decommissioning SCP-8911.  Attached below is an abridged log of attempted measures taken.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Plan:** Site-333 open mic comedy night.\n\n**Reasoning Conspectus:** SCP-8911 reacts to humorous events, perhaps giving it more of what it wants will sate it and it will go away.\n\n**Status:** **##green|APPROVED##**\n\n**Results:** SCP-8911 failed to manifest once throughout the 4 hours of the event. Decommissioning attempt failed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Plan:** Kill the entire D-class population of Site-333.\n\n**Reasoning Conspectus:** SCP-8911 is known to enjoy the suffering of others. By inflicting suffering, we may appease it and cause it to demanifest.\n\n**Status:** **##red|DENIED##**\n\n**Results:** Researcher Carlos was admonished for this suggestion. SCP-8911 was heard throughout the Site when Carlos was informed he would be docked a month of pay for his behavior.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 8911.3:** On 30/06/1991, Vincent Bohart was scheduled to visit Site-333 and take over from Director Nolan Goode. As he arrived, it was noted that SCP-8911 began to be audible throughout the Site. Attached below is an interview carried out with Bohart following his arrival and discovery of interaction with SCP-8911.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** V. Bohart\n\n**Interviewee:** N. Goode, Site-333 Director\n\n**Note:** The interview began outside of Site-333 approximately 15 minutes after Bohart's arrival and discovery of interaction with SCP-8911.\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**Goode:** Hello, Vince. \n\n**Bohart:** Hey, Nolan. Your Site is laughing at me.\n\n**Goode:** Yup. I see you discovered our Site's little, uh, problem.\n\n**Bohart:** Problem? Here I was thinking that it was just some cruel prank on me. \n\n**Goode:** No, we wouldn't do that to you. \n\n**Bohart:** That's good to hear at least. So what is this, some sort of anomaly? And what's with the recorder? Don't tell me you're going to interview me.\n\n**Goode:** I just want to record everything we do for posterity. As for it being an anomaly, yes. Here, let me show you the documentation.\n\n//[There is a brief silence as Bohart reviews SCP-8911's documentation.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Well I'll be damned. Okay. So you have a canned laugh anomaly affecting your Site. But why does it go off when I enter the building?\n\n**Goode:** Maybe you're just naturally funny.\n\n**Bohart:** //[Bohart laughs.]// You think so?\n\n**Goode:** Maybe. Or maybe the things that happen to you are funny too.\n\n**Bohart:** Well, funny things do happen to me. And I think I'm pretty funny too.\n\n**Goode:** Fair enough. Why don't we go talk inside? It's almost lunchtime.\n\n**Bohart:** I don't want the mean laughter SCP to laugh at me just for existing though.\n\n**Goode:** Oh, stop it. We've dealt with it for months, surely a few hours of it won't hurt you.\n\n**Bohart:** Fine. Does the cafeteria have saltwater taffy?\n\n**Goode:** It does, yes.\n\n//[Bohart and Goode approach the Site. The slight creaking sound of the doors opening is audible after Goode inputs his security code. SCP-8911 is heard as Bohart enters, with loud clapping, cheering, and whooping.]//\n\n**Bohart:** //[Yelling over SCP-8911]// Yes, yes, very funny. I love an audience! How are we tonight, Atlantic City?\n\n**Goode:** //[Yelling over SCP-8911]// Come on, this way.\n\n**Bohart:** Wow, this place is nice. You have a whole cafeteria here?\n\n**Goode:** Uh, I think that's pretty standard. What do you normally do for lunch? \n\n**Bohart:** I just grab stuff from the breakroom fridge //[chuckles].// It's a great thing about working with the anomalous, plenty of reasons an employee's lunch could go missing.\n\n//[Bohart begins walking backwards, looking at the opposite direction.]//\n\n**Goode:** Vince, look out behind yâ€”\n\n**Bohart:** Whoa!\n\n//[Bohart slips and falls on the recently cleaned floor, landing on top of the wet floor sign.]//\n\n**Goode:** You okay there?\n\n//[SCP-8911 becomes uproarious in volume, reaching 180 dB throughout the site.]//\n\n**Bohart:** About as good as someone who just fell could be...\n\n//[Bohart attempts to stand but slips on the wet ground again. His left shoe slips off and hits him in the groin.]//\n\n**Goode:** Let me help you up.\n\n//[SCP-8911's laughter appears to become labored, with various previously laughing voices beginning to cough.]//\n\n**Bohart:** //[Gasping]// I uh, I don't want to get up and fall again.\n\n**Goode:** Come on now. Don't be like that.\n\n//[Goode helps Bohart to his feet, but his glasses fall from his face and hit the ground. One of the lenses is cracked.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Great. Just fucking fantastic.\n\n//[Bohart bends over to pick up his glasses and puts them back on.]//\n\n**Goode:** There you are. Alright, let's go get you an icepack from the cafeteria.\n\n//[SCP-8911's laughter has been largely reduced to coughing and wheezing and lowering in volume.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Let me just get my shoe. Fucking laughing Site.\n\n//[Bohart's glasses drop from his face again, and he accidentally steps on them. The glasses are broken beyond repair.]//\n\n//[SCP-8911's volume has become minimal, with very few voices still wheezing.]//\n\n**Goode:** I uh... I'm sorry Vince. At least the Foundation has good optometrists, right?\n\n**Bohart:** I guess. Especially now that I'm getting a promotion, right?\n\n//[Bohart bends over to pick up his glasses and shoe. As he fully leans over, he expels flatulence.]//\n\n//[SCP-8911 produces a final, hacking cough, then ceases.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Oops. Excuse me.\n\n//[There is a ten-second silence.]//\n\n**Goode:** Vincent, I think we just successfully decommissioned 8911.\n\n**Bohart:** We?! What do you mean we?!\n\n**Goode:**  Okay, don't get mad at me, but...\n\n//[Goode turns off his recording device.]//\n\n**<END LOG>**\n\n**Note:** SCP-8911 has failed to manifest in Site-333 following this event. Director Goode was commended for utilizing Bohart's accident-prone nature to the benefit of the Site and Dir. Bohart was awarded a free meal voucher redeemable in the Site's cafeteria. The anomaly's documentation is currently pending reclassification to Decommissioned.\n[[/div]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8910]]] | SCP-8911 | [[[SCP-8912]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n\n> **Filename:** site333.png\n> **Name:** View of house between two casinos - Town of Atlantic City, North end of Absecon Island, South of Absecon Channel, Atlantic City, Atlantic County, NJ HABS NJ,1-ATCI,19-3 (CT).tif\n> **Author:** Jack Boucher \n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:View_of_house_between_two_casinos_-_Town_of_Atlantic_City,_North_end_of_Absecon_Island,_South_of_Absecon_Channel,_Atlantic_City,_Atlantic_County,_NJ_HABS_NJ,1-ATCI,19-3_(CT).tif#mw-jump-to-license Wikimedia Commons]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
