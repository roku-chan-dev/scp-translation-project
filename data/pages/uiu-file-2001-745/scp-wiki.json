This claim is given some credence from the evidence described below. However, under observation by UIU and other organizations, there are no confirmed instances of the suspect actively generating time travel as anomalies properties.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** The suspect explained his motive was to \"prevent the signing of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2911-jp Hudson River Accord]\" in order to prevent a [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/r-sinano-chuo-co-jp-2025-02-10-alt85yo horrific war] in his future homeland. According to the evidence discussed below, the majority of the people in Egypt, the suspect's country of origin, will be killed by war in 2025, and the suspect attributes this to the Hudson River Accords, which were enacted on September 20, 2001, between the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n**Modus Operandi:** In the CI organization, the suspect was exclusively engaged in planning terrorist incidents and directing lower-level personnel. During the 9/11 attacks, he was not directly involved in the group that carried out the destruction, but instead defended the nearest hideout on Manhattan Island, which was hidden within Staten Island. This may be due to the fact that the suspect himself was an elderly man with no clear anomalous property other than the ability to time travel.\n\n**Behavior:** After joining CI in 1999, the suspect is known to have planned the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sc-99-734-01-506 Leonidio Mass Sabotage Event] that occurred in Greece in December 2000. Subsequently, the suspect participated as one of the masterminds in the Manhattan Dimensional Collapse terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. The suspect is alleged to have caused numerous human casualties and property damages to central to northern Manhattan Island by maintaining an uncontrolled UE-1110, an unidentified entity (known as the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tuftos-proposal “Scarlet King”]) designated by the Foundation and Coalition at the scene of the incident. The suspect has admitted to using information obtained from the future by going back in time in planning these terrorist activities.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Evidence]]\n\n**A: A [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-711-ex tablet communications terminal], allegedly a \"2022 model\":** Secured with the suspect in custody at a CI safe house located on Staten Island. Although the available functions were limited due to communication standards not matching those in the current United States, it was possible to access the “Notepad” application used by the suspect. However, since there is concern that access to recorded information pertaining to the said evidence may cause causal disturbance due to self-fulfillment of the prophecy, authorities have delegated control of the said items to the Foundation and continue to collaborate in the investigation of CI members, including the suspect.\n\n**B: Faisal Bashar, a well-known human rights activist:** DNA collected from the suspect matches Faisal Bashar (61 years old as of 2001), a well-known moderate human rights activist from Egypt with the same name as the suspect. The non-suspect, Mr. Bashar, was confirmed to have been holding a human rights rally in Kazakhstan at the time of the 9/11 attacks and denies any involvement with the incident or the suspect.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Bureau Records]]\n\n**Current Status:** In custody at the Rikers Island Detention Center after removal treatment of CI memetic effects (by the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/horizon-initiative-hub Horizon Initiative] initial response force) was completed.\n\n**Charges:** Masterminding of multiple terrorist incidents.\n\n**Sentencing:** Indefinite detention.\n\n**History of UIU Action:**\n\n2001/09/11: The Manhattan Dimensional Collapse terrorist incident begins and the FBI New York Field Office's Unusual Incidents Unit responds.\n\n2001/09/12: Derek O'Brien, a Chief Petty Officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, is taken into custody for bringing CI strategic materials into Manhattan Island. The CI's pre-imposed memetic control causes him to lose consciousness during an interview.\n\n2001/09/13: With the help of Ms. Jessica Eckert, a civilian psychometrician, the hearing against O'Brien is resumed. However, during the hearing, Ms. Eckert loses consciousness after a statement about the “Scarlet King” is heard. Later, the Foundation's Tactical Theology Department and others learn of the emergence of the divine entity UE-1110 in the Central Park area, which destroys the wards deployed by the Perimeter Initiative and conducts a widespread destructive operation in the middle of Manhattan Island.\n\n2001/09/14: A [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2912-jp Giant Mechanical Structure] is constructed by a number of paranormal groups that have gathered on Manhattan Island, led by members of the Church of the Broken God who had taken refuge in the Jefferson Miller Church.

We have been conducting a series of interviews since the suspect was handed over to the authorities, and to date the suspect has not revealed his motive for masterminding the Manhattan Dimensional Collapse terrorist attack. The suspect constantly repeats the prescribed questions during the interrogation....\n\n**BASHAR:** For goodness sake, man, answer my question! Has the Hudson River Accord been signed or not?\n\n**SCHOTT:** Hey, I'm the one asking questions here, and I'm telling you I'm tired of hearing that from you! You don't have the right to ask us how the agreements made in this future you speak of are...\n\n**PACKARD:** No...Elaine, wait a minute. We can talk now.\n\n**BASHAR:** You'll give me an answer?\n\n**PACKARD:** ...as of today, leaders of both the Foundation and the Coalition announced the signing of the Hudson River Accord.\n\n**BASHAR:** What about that Article 125?\n\n**SCHOTT:** Why are you pinpointing that article again?!\n\n**BASHAR:** Answer me!\n\n**PACKARD:** If it will satisfy you, I'll tell you. Here is the text that has already been sent out to the world. “Both the Coalition and the Foundation affirm their inherent right to the existence of the following entities and defend their survival and the existence of their free will to the fullest extent possible, provided that normality and reality are not impaired...”\n\n**BASHAR:** ... following entities?\n\n**PACKARD:** “...a humanoid anomaly/threatening entity.” That's all.\n\n**BASHAR:** //[The subject is stunned.]//\n\n**SCHOTT:** ... is that enough to satisfy you？\n\n**BASHAR:** Ah. Word for word, it's the same article I know. I've lost. You can do whatever you want now.\n\n**SCHOTT:** So let's get you to answer our question. What did you bring to the scene of the Manhattan Dimensional Collapse terrorist attack?\n\n**BASHAR:** The Scarlet King...is not something we brought with us. It is a natural draw when regime and counter-regime, order and chaos collide. If I had anything to do with it it was to redirect the king's wrath.\n\n**PACKARD:** From what to what?\n\n**BASHAR:** At the site of the terrorist attacks I knew... the Insurgency was the challenger. It attempted to rebel against the Foundation and the Coalition, which had been the source of the paranormal organizations that had flooded the world, in order to restore the normal order that had existed until three years ago. The king then sided with the world of chaos and the rebels were put down.\n\n**SCHOTT:** That doesn't explain anything.\n\n**BASHAR:** No, it was all the other way around. In the process of transforming the former anomaly incarceration organization into an anomaly-ridden corrupt organization with the collapse of the veil, those who defected from it were the last of the supernumeraries. The king likes chaos... The king was not dominated by the conscience that human history had cultivated in the gods. The Scarlet King gave in to the Gulf regime and kicked the Insurgency to the curb.\n\n**PACKARD:** If the Scarlet King we have seen had been that good a listener, the area around Central Park would not have been burned to the ground. Many of our innocent collaborators have also been affected by the personnel crisis... Ms. Eckert has yet to regain consciousness.\n\n**BASHAR:** Therefore, when I stood on the scene, I had to have the Scarlet King on my side... In the name of chaos, I gathered [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2910-jp the essence of discord and chaos] from all over the world, plotting to release it onto Manhattan Island. The most powerful of them all,[[footnote]]This appears to be a statement regarding UE-1109, a group of divine entities that caused widespread destruction in central and southern Manhattan Island. [[/footnote]] was hidden far away in the depths of Leonidio.\n\n**SCHOTT:** Leonidio? Don't tell me you were part of that massacre? The one where not even a single witness was left?\n\n**BASHAR:** In the 2010s, a lunatic claiming to be [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5721 the God of Discord] was building a global intelligence network. He was proficient about his homeland. So I targeted his homeland. Because I saw it and I knew it. You will never know it.\n\n**PACKARD:** Hmmm...Elaine, please add to the task of investigating what other CI constituents were doing in December 2000. Including, if possible, those who blew up on Manhattan Island.\n\n**SCHOTT:** Sure. Well, Bashar, thank you for one thing: for providing us with some leading information. But there are still many questions to be asked. Why did you choose to join Insurgency in the first place? You used to be a human rights activist, after all.\n\n**BASHAR:** That's right. I am still just a human rights activist! All to save the unfortunate people. In the present day, I have only one goal...to stop the people of the future from being wiped off the face of the earth by some aberrant human being. To do this, it was necessary to prevent the conclusion of the evil Hudson River Accords.\n\n**PACKARD:** I see, so let me ask you, what was so evil about the Hudson River Agreement as you know it?\n\n**BASHAR:** Since the signing of the accord, you, the Foundation and the Coalition have stopped monitoring the supernatural races. Not only that, you have encouraged their spread throughout the world, claiming it is part of “protecting human rights”. If you had any sense at all, you would know that, right? What would happen if a monster with human-like intelligence, claws, fangs, magical powers, and other offensive capabilities were unleashed on the world?\n\n**PACKARD:** It has.\n\n**BASHAR:** In a few decades, the world has fallen into the hands of non-humans. It is impossible for humans and non-humans to respect each other from the bottom up, so it is only natural that the weak lose to the strong. And yet, brainwashed by the words “human rights” and “symbiosis,” the pathetic sapiens have decided to allow their own species to lose its right to speak out and fall.\n\n**SCHOTT:** What did you do in all that?\n\n**BASHAR:** When Africa [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/the-f suddenly regained the veil], I intuited that it would be the last bastion of human resurgence. But the tentative calm crumbled prematurely in the face of the rest of the international community, which continued its mad radical policies... Once shaken off, all that remained was to be abandoned. Against the hordes of misanthropes pouring into my homeland of Egypt, I, along with the few remaining sensible people, waged an all-out war...[http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/three-glasses-of-hnkt and we were annihilated]. I must never repeat their misfortune. I could not let the last miracle, the chance to go back in time and destroy the Hudson River Accords, the source of the whole thing, slip away. I could not.\n\n**SCHOTT:** ...Is that why you were involved in terrorism?\n\n**BASHAR:** As far as I know, there was no possibility that a being capable of defeating the Scarlet King could be born in the Fallen Dimension...\n\n**PACKARD:** I understand your story. It means that in the name of saving the humans of the future, you have destroyed the lives of many humans of today. Whether you are really from the [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/it-is-about-time \"future\"] or not is beside the point.\n\n**SCHOTT:** I believe this will conclude today's investigation.\n\n**BASHAR:** No...let me say one last thing.\n\n**PACKARD:** Hmm?\n\n**BASHAR:** Don't regret it.\n\n**<RECORD END>**\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Additional Information]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:double 5px #999999; background:#FFFFFF; float:center; width:85%; padding:5px 13px 5px 13px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n+++ Record 2001/09/21 - UIU-NY\n++++ Surveillance video footage from Rikers Detention Center\n\n----\n\n[[<]]\n\n**Supplement:** The following video recording is a combination of the video from the surveillance camera showing the cell where the suspect was detained at 23:00 on 09/21/2001, and the audio recorded at the same time.\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[div style=\"clear: both\"]]\n----\n[[<]]\n\n**<RECORD START>**\n\n//[The suspect is asleep in his cell.

The FBI has placed an APB out on the suspect for alleged masterminding of multiple terrorist acts and escape from prison.\n\n**Addendum:** As of 2010, the suspect's whereabouts are still unknown. However, since there have been no incidents involving the suspect since his escape, and if the suspect's claims are correct, he is 96 years old at this point, it is highly likely that the suspect is either dead at this point, or if he is alive, he is no longer capable of planning terrorist acts that would affect public safety. Even if the suspect is still alive, it is highly likely that he no longer has the ability to plan terrorist acts that affect public safety. For these reasons, the suspect will be removed from the FBI's Most Wanted List after 2010.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
