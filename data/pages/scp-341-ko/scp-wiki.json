People directly related to PoI-3410 should be treated with C-Class amnestics. SCP-341-KO-A is stored in a warehouse in Site-05K, checking regularly for oncoming messages. Attempts to track SCP-341-KO's current location are under progress.\n\n**Description:** SCP-341-KO is a flying object that carries PoI-3410, made with an indoor heating tent and cardboard. Despite lacking vital features for interstellar survival, the object has flown in space, accelerating and decelerating through a trajectory, while also anomalously shielding the passenger from harmful environmental elements, such as extreme radiation, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. Gathered information suggests that SCP-341-KO is made by PoI-3410. However it is unknown as to how the object has obtained such anomalies. (See Addendum 1)\n\nSCP-341-KO-A is a cell phone with its battery detached, crudely decorated with coloured papers and stickers. Despite its lack of power, it can recieve and send messages as normal, enabling limited communication with PoI-3410. The Foundation has succeeded in communication with PoI-3410 using SCP-341-KO-A, gathering information. (See Addendum 2)\n\nThe Foundation first became aware of SCP-341-KO after recieving multiple reports about a UFO flying over an elementary school in Korea. The Foundation tried to contain SCP-341-KO using uncrewed aircraft. However the attempt failed as the object rocketed out the atmosphere at high velocity. The Foundation was able to identify PoI-3410 while inspecing said said school, who was refusing attendence. \n----\n**Addendum 341.1 Recovered Log**\nBelow are excerpts from a notebook found while searching PoI-3410's house.\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:90%; padding:10px; font-family: 'Poor Story'; font-size:16px;\"]]\n[[<]]\n= [[size 140%]] **Flying Really Really Far** [[/size]]\n//Make a big strong spaceship and see the planets in space!//\n\nThings to prepare: Paper, glue(not the solid one), scissors, crayons, two of mom's old cell phones, blanket, pillow, snacks, drinks, water bottle, some notebooks and pens\n\n**Plans:**\nFrom the --veranda-- living room window in my house, fly to the school, show off my space ship, and fly to the moon and land there.\n\nI stay one day at the moon, and fly to mars. Then I see the mountains and volcanoes, and go to Saturn to see Titan and check if it really looks like earth a long time ago. Then, I will fly to Pluto and cheer it up because it's not a planet anymore.\n\nThen, I go to the planets I made! I named it after other stories. I coloured it in blue and purple! (And with yellow and highlight pens) I'm going to Aruna last because it's the prettiest,\n\n**Keep in mind:** Don't go out the spaceship, dont' cry, **Don't be weak and return in the middle**\n\nHome — School — Moon(One day) — Mars(5 Days) — Titan(3 Days) — Pluto(One day) — Darva(One week) — Menaka(One Month) — Aruna(One Month) — Home\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n**Addendum 341.2 Communication Log**\nBelow are excerpts from the communication with PoI-3410 using SCP-341-KO-A.\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n= **Communication Log 341-A**\n**Foreword:** This is the initial communication between the Foundation and PoI-3410.
