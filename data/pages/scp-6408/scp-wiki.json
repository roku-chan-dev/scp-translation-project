Personnel are advised to stay within their respective locations.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=6408\n| caption=Metaphysical representation of SCP-6408.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6408 is an oracular-shaped //hole// within the human noosphere, acting as a pathway to a much larger noospheric expanse. This invariably leads to foreign structures entering into consensus thought.\n\nThese foreign structures are metaphysical in nature, presenting as commands/demands. A subject's mind perceives these as subconscious thoughts and thus are acted upon without the subject's knowledge.\n\n**Log of Foreign Structures:** Each of these instances resulted in the subjects congregating at the derelict Foundation Site-301.\n> **Instance #1** \n> **Demand:** \"Screws\"\n> **Result:** 48 personnel began to use their fingers to pull out assorted screws from Foundation buildings.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #2** \n> **Demand:** \"Steel beams\"\n> **Result:** 13 personnel began to use their fists to punch at the concrete walls. After roughly 72 hours of this, the personnel retrieved several steel support beams from inside the walls.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #3** \n> **Demand:** \"Cement\"\n> **Result:** 5 construction personnel diverged from a convoy of construction vehicles, bringing bags of cement to Site-301.\n> **Response:** Unaffected personnel began to follow the diverging convoy, which resulted in all of them being terminated by affected personnel at Site-301. The cadavers were repurposed for sustenance.\n\n> **Instance #4** \n> **Demand:** \"Guards\"\n> **Result:** STF Theta-4 left their positions at Area-140 and walked towards Site-301, taking up defense positions there instead.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #5** \n> **Demand:** \"Food\"\n> **Result:** 18 research personnel in the staff break room at Area-140 began raiding the cafeteria, bringing it to Site-301 in stolen vehicles.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #6** \n> **Demand:** \"Wires\"\n> **Result:** 15 Foundation engineers began pulling apart equipment and machinery, collecting bags of assorted cables and wires before heading to Site-301.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #7** \n> **Demand:** \"Gears\"\n> **Result:** The same Foundation engineers returned the following day attempting to enter Area-140. Replacement STF operatives attempted to stop the incoming personnel, but were easily eliminated by the attackers, who then proceeded to tear apart more machinery, returning to Site-301 with bags of assorted gears.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #8** \n> **Demand:** \"Workers\"\n> **Result:** A total of 289 personnel from several Sites converged at Site-301.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #9** \n> **Demand:** \"Electricity\"\n> **Result:** The affected personnel began to hijack Foundation powerlines, diverting electricity to Site-301.\n> **Response:** No response.\n\n> **Instance #10** \n> **Demand:** \"Foundation\"\n> **Result:** {{Insert Information Here}}\n> **Response:** {{Insert Information Here}}\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6407]]] | SCP-6408 | [[[SCP-6409]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** medium.jpg\n> **Authors:** [[*user Bread_Tyrant]], NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Derivative of:** [[[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SMM_panel_hole.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
