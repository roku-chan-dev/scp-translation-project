A missing persons report is put out when this occurs.  __Following the incident, it is no longer recommended to confine those affected by 236.__\n\n**Description :** 236 is an obsession, a potentially contagious idea [[footnote]]SCP-FRA75 : a meme?[[/footnote]] first detected on March 21st 1998 in Toulouse which has since extended to part of the French metropolitan territory. I don't know if any cases have been discovered overseas or in any neighboring territories to France due to a lack of characterization of the disorder and a lack of surveillance capabilities.  While a vector of contagion has yet to be discovered, it remains concerning that the map of recent 236 cases resembles that of a viral infection.\n\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://fondationscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-fra31-236/carte_236.gif style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nRecorded cases of 236 from 03/21/1998 to 02/02/2022. Live updates relayed from my personal computer.  (forwarded from my phone since 2022).\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThe first symptom of 236 is the appearance of sand in the pockets or shoes of a subject. Though I've observed this only once, subjects I've spoken to over the phone have described the sand as relatively fine, damp at the bottom and at times mixed with flakes of mica; beach sand. This sand only appears once, on the first night of the phenomena. This is the only symptom of that night.\n\n\nFrom the second night onwards, subjects are effected by a delusional obsession of increasing severity. The subject begins searching for what they call \"the beach\", perhaps where the sand comes from, without any existing beach seeming to satisfy them. As of my latest research, this beach does not appear to exist.\n\nPresently, there exists no means of impeding a subject targeted by 236. Reasoning, threatening and pleading all fail to prevent the subject from continuing their search at nightfall, regardless of their usual disposition. [[footnote]]SCP-FRA34: One subject targeted by SCP-FRA31-236, a single mother, left her baby to die in her search for the beach.[[/footnote]] Even sedation is ineffective, regardless of dosage, as the subject develops a very strong resistance to psychotropic drugs. I think confinement may be the only means to stop this, but this has yet to be put into practice due to my weak influence on panicked subjects calling the SAMU [[footnote]] **TRANSLATORS NOTE:** Service d’Aide Médicale Urgente, Urgent Medical Aid Service/Emergency Medical Services[[/footnote]] 31.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the behavior of 236 during the **Day** is remarkably different from numerous other reported phenomena on two points.\n\n* Firstly, during the day the subject is conscious of their state of advanced fatigue and of the fact that they are under the influence of an obsession, or at least that a part of them is preoccupied with something, without being able to identify what this is. The subject is equally conscious of being far from home once they leave (at times several hundred kilometers) and does not rationalize the phenomena, contrary to most cases. \n\n* On the other hand, the subject's entourage will not notice the subject's symptoms and will completely ignore their **nocturnal** behavior, or effortlessly rationalize it. Thus, it seems that even the search itself is abnormal. \n\nThe detection of 236 cases may take multiple days, in rare cases up to two weeks, due to the progressive development of the obsession's intensity. For the reasons noted above, it is common for subjects targeted by 236 to enter a phase of temporary lucidity, during which time they look for aid in their search for the beach, all the while realizing that their situation is abnormal. It is generally at this point that I make contact with them, via my night shift at the SAMU 31. The mechanisms for those seeking urgent care are triggered, but turned towards 236.\n\nAfter a duration lasting anywhere from two weeks to a month, during which the subject becomes totally incapable of completing normal tasks and displays increasingly risky behavior at night, if they are not dead, the subject enters the terminal phase of 236. This phase progresses systematically during the night. The subject contacts those they've come across who have \"aided\" them (typically having prevented them from acting dangerously or abnormally) in their search for the beach. This contact is generally by phone, but may also occur through the internet. During this phase, all means of locating the subject prove ineffective: calls are untraceable, location services no longer work, Airtags cease functioning. The tone of the subject differs greatly from previous nights, as they seem calm and relieved. The subject thanks those they have contacted before announcing that they have \"found the beach\". Sounds of waves can occasionally be heard, as well as a siren. After this call, the subject disappears. I have only ever heard the siren once, during the call I received from my mother on March 21st  1998.\n\n**Update 02/02/2022:** Before heading to bed, I found sand in my pants pockets. It was fine, damp at the bottom and contained a few flakes of mica. You can go ahead and add an obelus to my account, but I'll use the time I have before I disappear to find out more about this thing. This is **Night 0**.\n\n**Night 1.** I spent last night thinking of the sand, all the while forbidding myself from thinking of the beach. It's hard, but I think that's because I'm aware of 236 and not due to 236 itself. I perceive no difference in my behavior for now, but evidently I am finding it very difficult not to think of the beach. I wonder what they see when they say they've found it.\n\n**Night 2.** I'm tired from having slept so little the last two nights, I think that I'll turn in early. No symptoms to declare.\n\n**Night 3.** Still nothing, going to turn in early. If I sleep there's no risk of me searching for the beach.\n\nI've just woken in the middle of the night. I'm sure I heard waves and felt the sea spray on my face. It wasn't a dream at all, but a memory. I believe I'm starting to understand.\n\n**Night 4.** I found myself taking longer than usual  heading home from work. Longing to enjoy the calm dark of a Toulouse Monday, no doubt. Still, I strolled along the Garonne for at least an hour expecting to see the beach.\n\n**Night 5.** I started to feel very badly at work, and left early. Ironic for someone who works at the SAMU to get sick, but when I collapsed on the phone with a fever, my supervisor sent me home. Immediately after getting in my car, I felt better and had to fight to drive home without making any detours. I had the impression that the further I went the better I felt, it was very very difficult. I'm pretty sure I heard waves between the sounds of the motor.\n\n**Night 6.** The other guys in my section think I should be sequestered so they can look after me. When I've finished my shift I think I'll head to the shared cellar. I hope it'll be alright.\n\nThe sun will rise soon, I've finally succeeded in stopping myself. I'm on the Spanish border, I couldn't stop driving. I think the beach is near, but I'm scared of what I might find. In my panic I slashed my tires, at least I won't be driving any further. The journey home will be by train, I think.\n\n**Night 7.** I've found someone who can help. The guy who watches the night market in Saint-Pierre, he knows where the beach is. I know, I see it in the way he looks at me. I want to talk to him, just for a minute before going to the cellar. Just, just talk to him\n\nShit\n\nJonathan we know where you are, don't move, we're coming to get you. You left your account logged in on the cellar's PC. \n\n**Night 8.** I know where she is. My mother. The beach. The answer. I know where to find peace, I hear it calling. She was just there, just beneath. I'll come back, I swear. But I have to go. Don't look for me.\n\nJonathan, we're coming, don't move. Cassandra's car is geolocated, the police are looking for you. The grocer died from his injuries. You don't have to go, we'll plead for you to get help, you could follow a treatment, we'd visit often, you could even stay up to date on the section's activities. Jonathan, please, come back, don't go to the beach. I know that you're reading this, there are two connections. You're strong Jo, we believe in you. We know you can beat this thing trying to chow on your brain, we're here to help you. I'm begging you, come with us.\n\n**Night 9.** I found the beach.\n\n[[html]]\n<video style=\"width:100%;height:100%\" controls>\n<source src=\"http://fondationscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-fra31-236/vid_plage_postmosh.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"display : none\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Name:** Glitch Decoration GIF\n> **Author:** I G\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/qubodup/8197033359\n\n> **Filename:** vid_plage_postmosh.mp4\n> **Author:** Cauchynambour\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://fondationscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-fra31-236/vid_plage_postmosh.mp4\n\nUses:\n\n> **Name:** siren WTC\n> **Author:** Kostrava\n> **License:** CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/audio/afab30c2-e300-41f6-a1d1-b9a1acbaa578 \n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
