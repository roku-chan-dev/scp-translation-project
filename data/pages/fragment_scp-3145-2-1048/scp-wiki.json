  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-3145\n\n**Object Class:** --Safe-- Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** --As SCP-3145 poses no threat and has been observed to greatly improve the morale of personnel who interact with it, it has been allowed to freely roam Site-24.-- The whereabouts of SCP-3145 are currently unknown, though it is still believed to be somewhere in Site-24. Securing it for containment is currently an Alpha-1 priority. Any creation of SCP-3145's is to be destroyed on sight, unless further evidence warrants extreme action. To prevent confusion or mistaken identity, no teddy bears are to be allowed in Site-24, and any object that resembles a teddy bear is to be reported to the security team immediately.\n\n//-This is not a joke. We have no idea what SCP-3145's full capabilities are. Who knows how many of them are out there by now? - Dr. Falzon//\n\n**Description:** SCP-3145 is a teddy bear, approximately 33 cm high. Testing has shown no unusual qualities in the object's composition that make it discernible from non-sapient teddy bears. The object is animate and regularly shows affection to individuals, including hugging the legs, dancing, jumping in place, and even producing childlike drawings. All personnel who have interacted with SCP-3145 have responded positively to this affection, even those with sociopathic tendencies.\n\nAttempts at direct communication with SCP-3145 have yet to be successful. Though it is capable of simple gestures to indicate \"yes,\" \"no\" and other basic concepts, it will often not react to lines of questioning concerning its nature or origins. Though capable of drawing, it has not used this ability to communicate, even when encouraged to do so.\n\nThe more alarming behavior of SCP-3145 was not observed until 7 months after initial containment. SCP-3145 appears to be capable of creating replicas of itself using various materials, via an as-yet unobserved process. Dr. Falzon has suggested SCP-3145 used its more endearing qualities to lull staff into a false sense of security while it collected materials to produce the replicas. Currently, there are 3 known replicas, designated SCP-3145-A, SCP-3145-B and SCP-3145-C. In contrast to SCP-3145's behavior, all three replicas have exhibited extreme violence towards staff.\n\n**Addendum: Interview 3145-01**\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3145\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Emil Falzon, Lead Researcher, SCP-3145\n> \n> **Foreword:** After a Site-wide manhunt and ██ casualties caused by SCP-3145-A, -B and -C, SCP-3145 was captured 20/03/2013 at 11:02 after being found wedged among fallen shelves in a storage closet. During transport to a new containment chamber, SCP-3145 began to vocalize for the first time and requested an interview. Dr. Falzon was called to interact with the object.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 11:08>**\n> \n> **Falzon:** You realize you're going into containment for a long time now, yes?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Yeah. I guess everything was too good to be true. Honestly, I could probably use a little time-out.\n> \n> **Falzon:** How do you mean?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Well, like, I was having fun, but... How to put this? I need better friends.\n> \n> **Falzon:** Please elaborate.\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Like, the metal guy? Way cool. Dude can fucking ninja his way through everything. Don't know why I waited so long to make him. Ear boy? Creepy, but effective. I totally did //not// expect the screaming and ear-growing. I mean, it's still weird, but it's kinda neat.\n> \n> **Falzon:** And SCP-3145-B?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Ugh. Where do I begin? First, there's what it's made out of. That is just... I don't have any words for it. Fucking sick. And yeah, he killed someone, but it was in, like, the most disgusting way possible. Worst part is, it follows me around like a little lost puppy, like I'm the only friend he's got in the world, and I just want it to go the fuck away. //[sighs]// Well, two out of three ain't bad, am I right?\n> \n> **Falzon:** Would you care to explain how we were able to catch you?\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** //[laughs]// Right, right. See, after metal-me turned out so well, I thought, hey, enough with the biohazard, time for household supplies. I was gonna make a new one out of lightbulbs. Who knows what kinda crazy electro-powers that would have, yeah? Long story short, stumpy teddy arms ain't exactly agile. Kinda slipped and fell and got all that crap stuck on me. So, here I am, totally caught, fair and square!\n> \n> **Falzon:** Very well. I hope these new accommodations will suit you.\n> \n> **SCP-3145:** Eh, if they don't, I'll just move on. You know how it is.\n> \n> **<End Log, 11:15>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-3145 has not spoken since this event, even when prompted. SCP-3145-A and SCP-3145-B have been apprehended as of 22/03/2013. The whereabouts of SCP-3145-C remain unknown, and the Site-24 lockdown persists as the search is ongoing.",
