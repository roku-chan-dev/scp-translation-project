Standard media protocols are to to conceal the SCP-7384 process, including all agricultural holdings practicing SCP-7384, from the civilian public. Vehicles produced through this method are permitted to be sold to civilians with their true origin remaining concealed.\n\nDue to the events of September 5, 2022, Containment Zone 7384 is to be monitored through offsite means only. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7384 is an agricultural process through which automobiles are cultivated. Vehicles produced through this method are otherwise physically mundane following maturity, and operate similarly to a non-anomalous equivalent. Research is currently underway regarding the exact mechanisms of SCP-7384.\n\nIndividuals participating in SCP-7384 operations are collectively designated Persons of Interest 7384, with numerical sub-designations issued chronologically by order of discovery. To prevent confusion, all Persons of Interest have been labeled by their given names within dialogue transcripts.\n\nThe first Person of Interest to be identified is an adult male named Darius McClain, designated PoI-7384-1. This individual is the farmer and landowner of an agricultural holding within Union County, Mississippi, USA, designated SCP-7384-A, that produces Toyota automobiles through the SCP-7384 method. \n\n------\n**Addendum 01:** On July 5, 2022, PoI-7384-1 made a social-media post offering an apprenticeship at SCP-7384-A.[[footnote]]The account was later deleted, and their IP address was blacklisted from all social media sites.[[/footnote]] Foundation webcrawlers identified the information as potentially anomalous, and the phenomenon received its SCP designation.\n\nLead Researcher Naomi Bradley was dispatched for initial investigation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/jiwoahn-vii/brad.jpg\n| caption=Researcher Naomi Bradley.\n| width=250px\n| align=right]]\n\n= **Transcript 7384-1**\n\n**Personnel Present:** Researcher Naomi Bradley\n\n**Subject:** Darius McClain (PoI-7384-1)\n\n**Location:** SCP-7384-A\n\n**Date:** July 6, 2022\n\n------\n= **<Begin Log>**\n------\n\n//Researcher Bradley enters SCP-7384-A in her Foundation-issue SUV.

And call me \"Dan\".\n\n**Bradley:** My name's Naomi, I saw your posts online and I'm interested in an apprenticeship with you.\n\n**McClain:** Glad there's still city folk wantin' to work the fields. Let me give you a tour, show you what you'll be workin' with.\n\n**Bradley:** Certainly.\n\n//McClain stands up and begins to walk towards the fields, with Researcher Bradley following.//\n\n**Bradley:** How long have you been farming automobiles, Dan?\n\n**McClain:** Six years, though it feels like I've done this my whole life.\n\n**Bradley:** And why have you chosen automobiles as your crop?\n\n**McClain:** Well... I wanted to be a farmer like my old man, before he passed on and my uncle sold the family farm to move to Jackson. Got him back in the end, sold his liquor store to buy this place.\n\n**Bradley:** Where does Toyota enter the-\n\n**McClain:** I'm gettin' there, hang on. I tried growin' corn the first two years, but then I got an offer from Toyota to grow cars instead. I ain't take it at first, but then I saw the checks they were offerin'. Ten to thirty grand per car, all expenses paid for. By now they're phasin' out the subsidies, but it's still a tidy profit.\n\n**Bradley:** That's good to hear.\n\n**McClain:** So I flew out to California and went through this whole orientation process. Talkin' about how \"Toyota\" means \"prosperous field\" in Japanese or somethin' like that. \n\n**Bradley:** Then you came back and grew cars for them for over half a decade?\n\n**McClain:** Yes, ma'am. \n\n//The two approach a grassy field containing multiple rows of Toyota vehicles, implanted into the soil in rows five meters apart from each other.//\n\n//McClain gestures toward the field.//\n\n**McClain:** One hundred and twenty Corollas, Camrys, Rav-4s, and Priuses. We'll start reapin' them next week, loadin' them onto trucks corporate sends me, and they'll go to happy customers. \n\n//The two begin to traverse the field. Researcher Bradley observes each buried vehicle as she walks by.//\n\n**Bradley:** Mister- um, Dan, how //exactly// do these cars take shape?\n\n**McClain:** Just like growin' regular fruits and veggies, except you gotta plant them further apart than other crops.\n\n//McClain reaches into their pocket and pulls out a small bag. Its label reads \"2024 Camrys\".//\n\n**McClain:** This's where all the new Toyotas come from. A bag just like //this//, sent from Japan. \n\n//Researcher Bradley begins to reach for the bag.//\n\n**Bradley:** May I take a sample home with me?\n\n//McClain quickly closes the bag and positions it away from Researcher Bradley.//\n\n**McClain:** Nope. These're real expensive. Toyota'll give me twenty grand for each car, each bag has thirty seeds, so that's... uh...\n\n**Bradley:** Six hundred thousand dollars a bag.\n\n**McClain:** Exactly, so I ain't gon' be givin' them away.\n\n**Bradley:** My apologies. \n\n//The two reach an irrigation ditch at the edge of the field. Another field of cars is visible across the ditch.//\n\n//McClain takes a seat on a pile of large fertilizer bags.//\n\n**McClain:** Anyway, once we plant them, I'll put these giant sprinklers over them for waterin'. Over the winter the cars'll be covered in this giant cocoon-lookin' thing, but when spring comes around, it'll wither away and expose a fully grown car ripe for pickin'. Gotta harvest them quick, or they might start to rust.\n\n**Bradley:** Come to think of it, how does the harvesting work exactly?\n\n**McClain:** I use my tractor to pull them out the ground one by one, kinda like regular towin'. I'll prolly switch tractors soon, my John Deere's been actin' up lately.\n\n**Bradley:** And that's the yearly agricultural routine?\n\n**McClain:** Yes ma'am, water four times a day, good soil, lots of nutrients. Sometimes Toyota'll send supplements I gotta mix in with the water. \n\n**Bradley:** Could you elaborate on the bio-chemical process that happens within each plant?\n\n//McClain stares at Researcher Bradley.//\n\n**Bradley:** As in, how do the cars grow and mature, biologically?\n\n**McClain:** That's for the boys in Japan to figure out, not me.\n\n//An individual, later identified as Michael Greenwood, steps out from the field across the ditch.

Moved in about four years ago, he's been bitchin' to me ever since.\n\n**Bradley:** There are //other// car farmers?\n\n**McClain:** Yeah, you just met Mike, haven't ya?\n\n//They sigh as they stand up and pick up a large bag from the pile.//\n\n**McClain:** This area ain't got enough nutrients and moisture for the two of us to grow together. I've found myself havin' to truck in more and more fertilizer to make my harvests on time. \n\n//McClain empties the bag onto a barren patch of land. An assortment of metal bolts, nuts, and screws pour out on the ground.//\n\n**McClain:** It's gettin' harder to meet my \"Toyota quota\" every year.\n\n//Researcher Bradley stares at the mass of metallic pieces in the soil.//\n\n**McClain:** Honestly... no offense ma'am, but I was lookin' for someone a little younger to pass this farm down to. Want my apprentice to inherit this farm and start an ol' fashioned lineage, continue where my old man left off.\n\n**Bradley:** You don't have children of you own?\n\n**McClain:** Naw, me and my wife Jasmine, there're some... fertility issues. You ladies understand, right?\n\n**Bradley:** Of course. With that being said, you're the perfect candidate to start a partnership with the Society of Crop Production. \n\n**McClain:** Hmm?\n\n**Bradley:** We're a co-op farming organization devoted to helping farmers manage and grow their operations.\n\n**McClain:** Wait, this's why you're here?

Due to the close proximity of both operations, a five-kilometer radius area was established around the collective center of SCP-7384-A and SCP-7384-B, and was designated Containment Zone 7384. MTF Epsilon-33 was tasked with maintaining the containment area through soft travel restrictions.\n\nPoI-7384-2's agreement allowed Epsilon-33 to analyse their SCP-7384 plants to determine a biological method of growth. However, due to the maturity of the instances, little information was obtained.\n\nNotably, examination of the soil within SCP-7384-B indicated high levels of contamination with metal alloys such as steel and aluminum, synthetic rubber, crystalized glass, and polyurethane compounds.\n\n-------\n\n**Addendum 02:** Foundation agents have initiated research into SCP-7384 operations within automakers Toyota and Honda. Site-48's Information Division is responsible for using gathered research to fabricate success stories of SCP-7384 holdings to add credibility to Foundation attempts at placating PoI-7384-2.\n\nRegardless, both Persons of Interest expressed enhanced aggression towards each other following initial Foundation contact.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Transcript 7384-3**\n\n**Personnel Present:** MTF Epsilon-33 Agents\n\n**Subjects:** Darius McClain (PoI-7384-1), Michael Greenwood (PoI-7384-2)\n\n**Location:** Containment Zone 7384\n\n**Date:** July 9, 2022\n\n------\n= **<Begin Log>**\n------\n\n//Two Epsilon-33 agents observe Greenwood watering a 2023 Acura Integra coupe.//\n\n//McClain walks up to their land boundary along the ditch, and waves at Greenwood.//\n\n**McClain:** What was that about not lettin' in visitors, Mike?\n\n**Greenwood:** Huh?

Over the course of the week, multiple Toyota-contracted transport trucks arrived to pick up the harvested vehicles. MTF Epsilon-33 personnel observed the process, no abnormalities were otherwise reported. \n\nFollowing their departure from Containment Zone 7384, a number of transport trucks were detained by Epsilon-33 and their drivers interviewed.[[footnote]] Due to the risk of amnestics affecting their navigation abilities, Epsilon-33 performed their duties under the guise of an investigation regarding a hit-and-run incident in the area. [[/footnote]] All drivers refused to disclose information regarding their role within SCP-7384-related operations.\n\nDuring detainment, the SCP-7384 vehicles were inspected by Epsilon-33. No physical abnormalities were discovered compared to non-anomalous equivalents. Approval was granted by senior Foundation personnel to allow the SCP-7384 vehicles to be sold to civilians.[[footnote]]The lack of available containment capacity at nearby Foundation facilities was also considered.[[/footnote]] The vehicles were reloaded on the trucks, and their drivers were allowed to proceed.\n\n------\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/jiwoahn-vii/nissin.jpg\n| caption=Howard Browning.

SCP-7384 agriculturalists were therefore instructed to keep their operations secret from the public. \n\nFor ease of containment, Lead Researcher Bradley enacted to relocate SCP-7384 operations to Containment Zone 7384, expanding the zone as necessary to accommodate new arrivals. Foundation agents been dispatched to locate uncontained SCP-7384 holdings and perform standard coercion methods to relocate them to Containment Zone 7384.\n\nCurrently, only one SCP-7384 participant has been relocated successfully. A Nissan cultivator named Howard Browning, designated PoI-7384-3, accepted an offer from the Foundation to relocate operations to SCP-7384-C, an area of land adjacent to SCP-7384-B.

Hello, can you hear me?\n\n**Bradley:** Yes, sir. Please introduce yourselves.\n\n**Canton:** I'm Legault Canton with Nissan Motors. \n\n**Koromo:** Koromo Tetsuo with Toyota.\n\n**Yamatani:** Yamatani, Honda.\n\n**Bradley:** Good. I'm Naomi Bradley with the Society of Crop Production, and three of your farming associates: McClain, Greenwood, and Browning. \n\n//Researcher Bradley turns to the farmers.//\n\n**Bradley:** Go on, say hi!\n\n**McClain:** Konnichiwa, Mr. Koromo.\n\n**Greenwood:** Yamatani-san, hello there!\n\n**Browning:** Good morning, Mr. Canton.\n\n\n\n**Bradley:** Alright, first thing on the agenda-\n\n**Koromo:** Ms. Naomi, why exactly do you wish to relocate our American operations to one location in Missi- Missmiss- \n\n**Canton:** Mississippi.\n\n**Koromo:** Thank you. Who are you as an agriculture \"Society\" to demand such a thing?\n\n**Bradley:** Sir, we believe it is best for the intricacies of the American auto market to locate manufacturing plants in one single area, rather than-\n\n**Yamatani:** But you are a farming society, yes? You are //not// an auto manufacturer.\n\n**Koromo:** Again, who are you to tell us where to grow our products?\n\n**Bradley:** If you'd let me speak, our analysis of the soil composition of your botanical operations suggests a high amount of metallic pollution. As a Society dedicated to preserving America's farmland, we believe it's best to contain pollution in one specific area.\n\n**Yamatani:** You are //not// observing the social, economic, and political aspect. Our operations are spread out across America so we can employ many different types of people, and ensure that no single disaster can disable all of our manufacturing.\n\n**Canton:** Plus, we're already placing farms in areas that aren't fit to grow anything else. Mr. Browning's farm used to be a steel mill that got demolished, it was //already// polluted.\n\n//Researcher Bradley takes a deep breath as she rubs her face.//\n\n**Bradley:** As we've said, the Society prefers to keep ground pollution to a minimum. Locating it all in one place is more manageable than- \n\n**Koromo:** Our new method is already more energy-efficient than our other manufacturing practices. We have saved millions of dollars by sending lithium waste to these operations for the growth of hybrid powertrains. Otherwise, it would have gone to waste. That is why it is called \"waste\". \n\n**Yamatani:** You have attempted to interfere with our operations without understanding of what we are doing. This operation is done with environmental concern in mind, so it should not concern you.\n\n**Bradley:** We operate under the concern of //all// of America's agriculture, organic or not. Everything we have done is perfectly legal.\n\n**Koromo:** That does //not// give you the right to tell us how to operate our facilities. Once again, who are //you// to tell us how to conduct business? Answer my question!\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Canton:** If I may interject, our board of investors at Nissan has been clamoring all week about this as well. They fear huge productivity declines and lost revenue, which goes against your \"production\" message, does it not?\n\n**Bradley:** We estimate no loss of productivity through our plan.\n\n**Canton:** But //we// do. Do the voices of our shareholders not matter to you?\n\n**Bradley:** We'll keep your investors in mind, and yes, we //do// value their goals and concerns.\n\n**Koromo:** That does not answer our question of //why// you believe you have the authority over us to relocate our operations!\n\n**Yamatani:** You have entangled us in useless bureaucracy and hostility through your narrow and ignorant view of our industry, and our logistics.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Bradley:** Mr. Koromo, Mr. Yamatani, Mr. Canton. The Society of Crop Productivity remains committed to increasing yields and efficiency every year, while minimizing waste and pollution. This has not changed, nor will it ever change.\n\n//Researcher Bradley takes a deep breath.//\n\n**Bradley:** While our intentions were to lower your operating costs, lower pollution and save money, it is clear to us that there was a considerable disagreement and disenfranchisement on how to achieve this. \n\n//She takes another breath.//\n\n**Bradley:** We will reconsider our consolidation plan regarding your auto farms. \n\n**Yamatani:** From now on, you will not interfere with our botanical operations?\n\n**Bradley:** To clarify, we'll no longer //plan to engage// in any un-permissioned relocations of such facilities.\n\n//The automaker representatives sigh in unison.//\n\n**Canton:** That's all we needed, for your group to leave us alone. We've all been hitting our emissions targets, we don't cheat like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal Volkswagen does], why interfere with //us?//\n\n**Bradley:** To my knowledge, Volkswagen's not growing cars out of the ground.\n\n**Koromo:** Now you will respect our industry for what it is. I recommend you resign with grace, and allow a more qualified individual to take your place to ensure such a calamity will never happen again.\n\n**Bradley:** I will make note of that comment, thank you.\n\n//The three SCP-7384 farmers smile and nod their heads.//\n\n**Greenwood:** We did it!\n\n**Browning:** Ha ha //ha!//\n\n//Researcher Bradley glances at McClain, and scoots Koromo's speakerphone towards them.//\n\n**McClain:** Mr. Koromo!

Thank you for-\n\n**Yamatani:** Why did you involve yourself with this \"Society\" organization?\n\n**Greenwood:** Oh, um... they showed up one day after my-\n\n**Yamatani:** You have neglected to prevent their intrusion.\n\n**Greenwood:** Yamatani-san, I didn't think it'd turn out like this! Didn't think this Society'll move in more car farms.\n\n**Yamatani:** My team has been hit with many calls from outsiders asking about the Honda Botanical Program. You have allowed this to happen! \n\n**Greenwood:** But- but Yamatani-san, it was the 'Yota farmer 'cross the street, //he// let 'em in!\n\n**Yamatani:** And you teamed up with them when he did not.\n\n**Greenwood:** Yamatani-san, I just wanted to expand my business, grow more cars for you!\n\n**Yamatani:** Your contract will //not// be renewed. We will accept your current harvest, but you will not be in partnership with us again. Goodbye.\n\n//Yamatani hangs up. Greenwood puts their head in their hands.//\n\n**Canton:** Mr. Browning? I have some news for you as well. \n\n//Researcher Bradley nudges Canton's speakerphone towards Browning.//\n\n**Browning:** Uh... what'd that be, Mr. Canton?\n\n**Canton:** We've done an audit into your farm's relocation, and we couldn't find any evidence it was approved.\n\n**Browning:** Wait, what? But I-\n\n**Canton:** I'm not finished. Due to this unauthorized relocation, we will //not// continue doing business with you after your current crops are harvested. \n\n**Browning:** But Mr. Canton, my old farm got eminent domained! And the Society was supposed to take care of all the paperwork.\n\n**Canton:** Well, we couldn't find any of this \"paperwork\". \n\n**Browning:** Mr. Canton, the Society moved me here! I was... coerced into it! They said they worked with you directly and everything!\n\n**Canton:** We'll accept any remaining autos you harvest next year, but after that, we're going our separate ways.\n\n**Browning:** Mr. Canton, wait! I- I- I'd like to file a dispute.\n\n**Canton:** Perhaps you should ask this \"Society\" of yours to find you another contract. Good luck with your last harvest, Mr. Browning.\n\n//Canton hangs up. Browning turns towards Researcher Bradley.//\n\n**Bradley:** I ensure you that the Society has done everything on our end to communicate your relocation with Nissan Corporate. \n\n**Browning:** That doesn't matter anymore!
