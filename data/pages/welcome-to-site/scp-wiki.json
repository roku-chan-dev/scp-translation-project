For once, it wasn't due to the fact that she had made a mistake a decade ago that had finally caught up to her. For once, she wasn't dealing with Lillian's problems or a crisis impacting Site-43. For once, Heather was working on a personal project that had nothing to do with her current position -- and the rush of that had kept her running. She sat, in the middle of her living room, surrounded by notepads, request forms, files and employee profiles.\n\n\"Hey, babe, I'm home!\" a voice called through the door, in a chipper mood, as the handle began to turn.\n\n//She must have yelled at somebody,// Heather thought.\n\n\"You're never going to guess who I just corrected, //again//.\"\n\n//Yep.// Heather smiled. \"In here babe, I'm still... still at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, the [[[Don't Let Them Forget|site proposal]]]? How's... all that going?\" Lillian asked, tossing her bag by the door as she slipped off her boots. \"Having fun yet?\"\n\nAs Lillian collapsed into the armchair behind her, Heather leaned back, staring back up in response: her eyes said it all.\n\nNo, this was not fun. Not at all.\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|to= @@[[ERROR: ADDRESS DOES NOT EXIST]]@@\n|cc=none\n|subject= RE:RE:Proposed Site Coordination\n]]\nThanks for the email, and the general information you included; are there any resources that the Foundation has regarding how to be a Director, or how to establish a new Site?

An anomalous field agent is a hassle, at the best of times, but we're not talking about some seasoned veteran here,\" a stern female voice said, through the phone. \"She's practically a fucking kid -- are you sure you know what you're getting into?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" Heather said flatly. \"Yes, I am aware of how old she is, but I also know who she is. Not just as an anomaly, not just as a field agent; [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadgirlwalking|I know who she is as a person]]]. I want her.\"\n\nThe voice sighs on the other end, followed by a relieved, yet subdued chuckle.\n\n\"It's just a few months, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just the summer, at least, to start.\"\n\n\"Okay. Let me run interference with [[[The Bowe Transition|Pandora]]], you just make sure she stays safe.

In the margins were idle doodles, etched in while she waited on they unending wait times for internal automated Foundation systems.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Jordan said, \"Winston was always a temporary assignment here, and I was able to reassign my responsibilities to other staff at 72-U. Once things are ready, we should be able to transfer at any time.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear, at least something is going right,\" Heather said, absentmindedly.\n\n\"Has it been too much? Directing, that is?\" Jordan sounded sincere, and Heather didn't think he was the type to lie as much as she did.\n\n//He... I guess he genuinely cares?//\n\n\"Shit, sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud,\" Heather said, brushing her messy nest of hair to the side. \"It's fine, it's just like... you remember when you first got assigned to Site 72-U, right? Do you remember your first day?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, yes,\" Jordan answered, a warm laugh echoing in the background of the call.\n\n\"Okay, did //you// have any help figuring out how to do... anything?\"\n\n\"Nope. They threw me into the deep end, and said 'figure it out'. It was a bit rough, but... wait, are you serious?\"\n\n\"Yep,\" Heather said, snorting. \"It's like we are allergic to documenting anything //but// anomalies.\"\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= T.Trainor@scp.int\n|to= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= RE:RE:RE:New Employee Designation Request\n]]\nHello Dr. Garrison,\n\nI'm afraid the application is still missing key information. Notably, you failed to include any existing identification documents, nor historical records for our background checks.\n\nAdditionally, the birthdate that you entered has a typo: 2019 was this year. The field is asking for the year the employee was born, please correct that.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Tad Trainor\n|title= Human Resources\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|to= T.Trainor@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= RE:RE:RE:RE:New Employee Designation Request\n]]\nTad,\n\nWe still have not met, and I don't see that changing. Especially given our history, I think that would be best. But, as I said in my first email to you, the information provided //is// correct, regardless of what it says. I am sure, and I checked that.

But I have existed for a long time, Heather. What is the problem?\"\n\n\"I know Arachne, but--\"\n\nThe voice on the other end squealed, interrupting Heather.\n\n\"That is my name!\" she said, excited more than anybody should have any right to be.\n\n\"Yes, Arachne,\" Heather said gently. \"You're right, that is still your name.\"\n\n\"Apologies, mom, I didn't mean to--\"\n\n\"You have to stop calling me mom.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I'm not your--\"\n\n\"But you are the reason I am here, are you not?

However, you must understand that from the moment my form took physicality, I understood you to be my mother. I apologize, but you are overlapping with my understanding of the idea of mom; I cannot call you anything else, //but// mom.\"\n\nThere was a pregnant pause, the irony of which was evident.\n\n\"Can you just call me Heather?\"\n\n\"I'll try, mom.\"\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|to= W.Pattersen@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= call earlier\n]]\nHi Walter,\n\nI'm following up about the call we had earlier, maybe writing it out will help you understand this:\n\nYes. You are building the correct site, and yes, I am positive that the blueprints and specifications are correct. So, explain to me again, why you decided to ignore that and change the purchase order? What are you going to do with the extra materials? And tell me when you and your foremen decided to hire **FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS** to meet the deadline, when I have explained many, //many// times that the design is correct.\n\nI will say it one more time. Yes, the site you are building will have 6 floors. At the same time, __yes__, you only need to build a single floor.\n\nDo not assume I am wrong. You do not understand what you are talking about.

Are you free right now?\"\n\n\"If this is about Lillihammer's request,\" Helena glared back, \"I have already told her that--\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It's not about that.\"\n\nHelena paused, looking the woman up and down, assessing her. She had been at the Foundation long enough to have seen her fair share of personnel come and go; she prided herself on having a sense of which ones would be here for a long time, and those which were trouble.\n\nShe wasn't sure what to make of the woman waiting on her response, so Helena deferred to politeness.\n\n\"Sit. Remind me, you are...\"\n\n\"Heather. I've worked here for--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Helena said, recognizing the name beyond the relationship with Lillian. \"You're who Billie has been running off to.\"\n\n\"That's who I'm here to talk about, actually. Billie.\"\n\n\"What did the girl do now?\"\n\n\"Nothing like that. I wanted to offer her a position, at a new site that I'm working on.\"\n\n\"You? What authority do you have to hire he--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Heather said with an unsubtle level of glee, \"I am in charge, so... I have full authority?\"\n\n\"If you have full authority, then clearly you--\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Helena. I think I got off on the wrong foot, can we restart?\"\n\nHelena pursed her lips as she considered it.\n\n\"Fine. But let me make this clear, Billie isn't like others her age, she has--\"\n\n\"I know,\" Heather interrupted, \"I know about her condition. That's why I came to you first, not as a coworker at 43; I came to you, as her mom. I know how much effort you put into protecting her, but, I can promise that there won't be issues at--\"\n\n\"How can you promise that?\" Helena demanded, standing in anger. \"How can you tell me that nothing will happen to her? Do you know what it's like? I've been protecting her for every minute, of every hour, of every day since she was first born, //far// before any other doctors believed the diagnosis. I know what Billie needs, how can you expect to come close to that?\"\n\n\"I can't. You're right, I am not a mother, and there is no way that I could come close to knowing that as well as you do. But that's okay, I don't need to have that.\"\n\n\"So, what? You're just going to let whatever happens, happen?\"\n\n\"No,\" Heather said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"But Billie will be there herself. And she knows what she can, and can't do. She knows her limi--\"\n\n\"You think that Billie knows when she should stop? You think she understands how to avoid her triggers, or what to do in a crisis? My answer is no, clearly, you are far too immature to understand what it means to care for somebody with a chronic illness.\"\n\n\"I... I'm not arguing that.\" Heather looked at Helena, calmly, a soft smile offered to broker a peace. \"But Billie has just as much right to a life as anybody else; and that includes being able to make mistakes. I will do everything I can to help her, and due to the nature of the proposed site, there should be significantly less environmental triggers, but...\"\n\n\"But what?\" Helena meekly squeezed out, doing her best to not let Heather's words take hold in her mind.\n\n\"You need to let Billie live.\"\n\nDr. Forsythe could not forget that sentence, no matter how hard she tried.\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= M.Westberg@scp.int\n|to= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= RE:RE:Minor Formulation Delays\n]]\nHi Dr. Garrison,\n\nI just wanted to reach out again regarding the standard Foundation formulary request you had submitted; unfortunately, due to the 'ontologically unstable' nature of the medication, as you put it, there have been additional delays in manufacturing the requested compound, at scale.\n\nThe dosing mechanism has been fully designed, tested, and functions; the only issue remaining is the synthesis of the compound. Is there an alternative compound or formula that would work in the same way?

I understand that, as a Parapharmacist, you may not have realized it, but in Anomalous Ontology, the meaning of an idea matters.

They kissed, which was Heather's favorite way of wiping that smirk off of Lillian's face.\n\n\"Well then, what are we waiting for?\"\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= H.Garrison@scp.int\n|to= SITE STAFF\n|cc=none\n|subject= Welcome to...\n]]\nHello all,\n\nAs few of you know, and many of you do not, I have been working on the creation, construction and preparation of a new Foundation site, specializing in an alternative approach to containment, anomalies and research. After a few months of delays, each due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the design, we finally have everything in place to start.\n\nI am please to announce that, as of today, the facility is now complete, having finished both physical and ontological construction. These next few days are going to be dedicated to testing our systems, refining the barrier against the Noosphere, and installing Spoke Links at given Sites, Facilities or locations; by the end of May, we will be fully operational.\n\nIf you are getting this email, congratulations, you have been selected as a member of staff; I'm talking to you, like this, because if you are getting this initial email, you have been picked by me, personally.
