All exposed subjects are monitored for correlations, all witnesses are administered Class-C amnestics and all compromising media is destroyed. \n\nRecovered SCP-1253-1 instances are stored in humanoid containment units, which are secured with digital combination locks. Access codes to SCP-1253-1 instances are shuffled on a bi-monthly basis and distributed to associated researchers, Site Security and Site Command. SCP-1253-1 testing is conducted with the notification of Site Director Davis. \n\n**Description:** SCP-1253 is a phenomenon affecting various cities in Bolivia and Peru. In the event of war, famine, or the death of a prominent political leader, SCP-1253-1 instances will progress from an unknown origin point to the affected cities.\n\nSCP-1253-1 instances are sapient automatons, capable of conversing in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Quechua. SCP-1253-1 instances are constructed of heavily decayed organic material, including entrails, limbs and genitalia. This material has been identified as originating from a variety of sources, including //Vicugna pacos//, or alpaca specimens. The anatomy of SCP-1253-1 instances is lacking in organs, musculature and skeletal structure, and it is currently unknown as to how instances retain autonomy. SCP-1253-1 instances also display various behavioural quirks including decorating themselves with feathers, bead bracelets and necklaces, carving various patterns onto themselves and objects, and conversing with themselves.  \n\nSCP-1253-1 instances will interact with subjects in the six to fifteen age range. Subjects will exhibit severely impaired judgement and be convinced by SCP-1253-1 instances to progress to the nearest high-altitude landform. SCP-1253-1 instances will there instruct subjects in a polytheistic religion bearing heavy similarity to the Quechuan religion. Instances will explain the structure of this religion, the procedures for various ceremonies, rituals and feast days, and demonstrate how to correctly conduct //Capacocha.//\n\nSubjects who have experienced SCP-1253 phenomenon appear to maintain various correlations. The majority of subjects demonstrate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, including paranoia and intrusive thoughts, as well as apparent sociopathy and criminal tendencies. A minority of subjects also claim membership to the 'Children of the Sun.' The existence of such an organisation has not been verified; there is some doubt to its existence.\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n__SCP-1253-1 Topic Table:__\n\n|| **Topic** || **Description** ||\n|| Reincarnation and the afterlife || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain the reincarnation process and the afterlife. Instances will state that the soul of the deceased, the //Camaquen,// would be guided by a canine in the passage to the afterlife, and will emphasize the importance that the deceased's corpse is not incinerated, which would threaten the //Camaquen's// passage to the afterlife.||\n|| Various deities || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain the various dominions of the deities, which include //Inti, Apu Illapu, Viracocha, Manco CÃ¡pac//. ||\n|| Correct worship of the deities || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain how to properly pray to the various gods, and which gods to pray to for various blessings, such as how //Apu Illapu// should be prayed to for rain. ||\n|| The conduction of festivals, ceremonies and rituals || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain the proper conduction of various ceremonies, what ceremonial garb is required and what sacrifices are needed. Emphasized is the //Inti Raymi// celebration. ||\n|| Inca culture || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain the social structure and history of the Inca culture, with particular emphasis to colonial resistance. ||\n|| //Sapa Inca// || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain how modern politicians in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador are the spiritual successors to //Sapa Inca,// \"The Great Inca.\" ||\n|| War || SCP-1253-1 instances will educate subjects in the manner of correctly using the //Bola,// staging ambushes and setting traps, and explain the necessity of resisting against Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch incursions into South America for the sake of the preservation of the Inca religion and culture. ||\n|| //Capacocha// || SCP-1253-1 instances will explain the importance of sacrificing a child to the gods during famine, war or upon the death of one of the spiritual successors of //Sapa Inca,// and how a pure child must be sacrificed instead of an adult. SCP-1253-1 instances will then select and restrain a subject, which will be killed by strangulation. ||\n\n__Transcript 1253-01__\n\nTranscript of SCP-1253-1-01 self-conversing while in containment.
