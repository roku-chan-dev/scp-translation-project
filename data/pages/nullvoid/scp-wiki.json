It is illuminated by the drone's spotlights, taking up the left half of the shot. The camera is tilted to the left at a 25-degree angle, indicating the drone has landed improperly due to sustained damage.\n\nThe right half of the shot is fully black due to the lack of light or observable landmarks. Movement is detected on the edge of shot in the opening frames of the recording, moving out of view, but does not reoccur.\n\nThe center of the shot is taken up by a sheet of paper, leant against the tree trunk and positioned to be fully visible on-camera. The sheet is entirely filled with crude handwriting, semi-legible and varying heavily in size. An AI-assisted transcript is attached below.\n\n-----\n\n**Transcript 019-32R-0001:**\n\nerth berning terning lerning cherning --waking-- reterning **[illegible]** wurlds in storys in wrlds in storybuk reed a buk\n\nitum # - --esseepis-- gock nyne --nyne nyn nyne-- wan free\n\n--obsh odj object ogje-- objakt klas - --kader-- --aboliyon-- --kadur-- --abiliyon-- --kedar-- --aboliyan-- --kadar-- aboliyon\n\nspeshal cantaenmant prosseedurs - --keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks keep it in the boks-- no boks its a --gock-- gone thing its **[illegible]** THEY GONED IT\n\nwurlds in storys wurlds broekn hevns eye iz gon no lite no lite no lite no lite NO LITE NO LITE\n\nduskrapshon - wurld wrld world world eltee ee eggs maakina stranges come always no stop alweys --never-- alweys **[illegible]**\n\nadenndam - GNAWING\n\ndark and blu and derk an blue and **[REDACTED - Foundation infohazard detected]**\n\nnot seying eyes oben\n\n**[The remainder of the page consists of the word 'warren' repeated over and over in various misspelt permutations, growing increasingly illegible until it is entirely unreadable.]**\n\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"danke robot\"]]\n**0406** @@>@@ Data compiled.
