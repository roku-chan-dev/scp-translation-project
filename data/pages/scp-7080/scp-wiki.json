SCP-7080 uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging [[footnote]]Such as in MRI Machines[[/footnote]] in tandem with taking snapshots of the subject's noosphere[[footnote]]The sphere made up of conscious thought[[/footnote]] in order to produce heat maps of consciousness within the brain.\n\nSCP-7080 was created as a result of Dr. Joseph Locke's[[footnote]]JLocke@SCiP.net[[/footnote]] research efforts during Project Philosopher, a project dedicated to mapping out the noosphere of individuals. Development of said project began on 3/17/2014, with research still ongoing within Site-90.\n\nEarly iterations of SCP-7080 consisted of Noosphere Imaging Devices integrated within MRI machines, however iterations SCP-7080-6 and later are portable enough to be carried by individuals on their person, allowing for all-day imaging.\n\nFurther Information is Locked Behind Level 3 Access.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Enter Level 3 Credentials?\" hide=\"Welcome, RAISA AGENT\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n**Addendum 7080-1:** The following are some research notes of Dr. Isabella Kant, a member of Project Philosopher.

SCP-7080-7 activated, shows full consciousness.\n\n**10:49 AM:** Post activation medical evaluation concludes. Subject returns to cell and lies down, covering eyes with one arm. Lowered consciousness detected.\n\n**10:54 AM:** Subject stops covering eyes to scratch their chin. Subject squints at the light, and uses other arm to cover eyes. Discrepancy between the two areas of consciousness detected. D-279094 knocks on Subject's door. Subject consciousness suddenly increases to full capacity. Subject answers door and begins janitor shift. Consciousness lowers during this shift.\n\n**12:00 PM:** Subject Takes lunch-break. After eating, subject begins playing chess with D-279094. Heightened consciousness detected at this time. \n\n**12:26 PM:** Subject takes more time than normal to make a move while playing chess. Discrepancy between the two areas of consciousness detected. Once said move is made the two areas of consciousness return to sync, and Subject immediately requests a take back. D-279094 accepts.\n\n**3:00 PM:** Subject returns to Project Philosopher main research room to continue tests.\n\n**3:41 PM:** Medical and mental evaluations concludes. Consciousness tests begin[[footnote]]Measuring during sleep, during focus, etc.[[/footnote]].\n\n**5:14 PM:** Consciousness tests conclude. Subject lies down and consciousness manipulation tests begin. Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to wipe out consciousness for 10 minutes. Subject loses consciousness.\n\n**5:24 PM:** Subject regains consciousness with no complications.\n\n**5:56 PM:** Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to reduce consciousness by 90% for 4 minutes. Subject enters coma-like state.\n\n**6:00 PM:** Subject regains consciousness with no complications. Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to increase consciousness by 90% for 30 minutes. Subject enters calm state. Subject describes feelings of clarity, better control over movements, and better control over thoughts.\n\n**6:30 PM:** Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to decrease consciousness of the left side of the brain by 50% for 30 minutes. Subject describes feelings similar to to the last time the Epiphany was applied.\n\n**7:00 PM:** Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to decrease consciousness of the right side of the brain by 50% for 30 minutes. Subject reports having more intrusive thoughts.\n\n**7:30 PM:** Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to decrease consciousness of the right side of the brain by 90% for 10 minutes. Subject reports feeling sluggish as well as having more intrusive thoughts.\n\n**7:40 PM:** Epiphany Mk. VII applied to Subject, set up to decrease consciousness of the right side of the brain by 99% for 5 minutes. Subject enters coma-like state.\n\n**7:41 PM:** In an effort to avoid [REDACTED], Dr. Joseph Locke orders the increase of consciousness of the right side of the brain by 10,000% for 5 minutes, thereby restoring it to normal capacity. However, the assistant handling the Epiphany Mk. VII applied it to the left side of the brain by accident. Subject gets out of coma-like state, then sits up. Protective cap and electrodes were ripped off in this motion.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 7080-4:** Project Philosopher main research room CCTV and audio, 7:41 PM - 7:45 PM\n\n> //D-198578 frantically looks around, heavily breathing.
