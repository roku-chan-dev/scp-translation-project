Caroll\n\n**Security Clearance:** Level-2\n\n**Occupation:** General researcher.\n\n**History:** Dr. Caroll was recruited to the Foundation at 23 years of age. During this time, Caroll was still in university studying theoretical physics and zoology. Caroll then completed his degree while in Foundation employment with the assistance of research specialists. \n\nDr. Caroll has been in Foundation employment for five years and is now age 28.\n\n**Additional Information:** Dr. Caroll is currently undergoing investigation for possible anomalous abilities. The ability in question is the ability to attract and/or manifest organisms of the //Coccinellidae// family (ladybugs) at will.\n> **Researcher Note:** I'm telling you, they just like me. Just because I always happen to have a stray ladybug on my shoulder, even while inside, doesn't mean I'm anomalous. Or, at least, I don't think so. But, hey, that would be pretty cool, right?\n> \n> - Dr. Caroll\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Object Documentation]]\n[[=]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3527\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3527]]] - Incompetent Rap-Loving Bodysnatchers**\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//I'm sorry to break it to you, but you are not Tupac.//\n[[/module]]\n@@@@\n> This was my first skip, and it was also a coldpost. On top of that, it was somehow successful. I thought of it when something like this ran through my mind: \"Aliens are cool. Why haven't we been taken over yet? They've gotta exist... What if it's because they're incompetent?\" I was also listening to the Kendrick Lamar song showcased in the skip at the time of writing, and that's where \"rap-loving\" came from.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3826\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3826]]] - The Definition of Technophobia**\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//They're building a portal... I tried to ask where it was going... \"the present.\"//\n[[/module]]\n@@@@\n> Roughly my fourth skip concept. I had thought of it because I wanted to write something about an arising conflict between the Church of the Broken God and the Sarkic Cults. Plus, Alaska. Who doesn't like Alaska? I mean, they don't have many ladybirds, but... you know. Alaska.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3641\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3641]]] - Remember --Apollo-99-- Nased**\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//He lied to me.//\n[[/module]]\n@@@@\n> This is my first space-based skip, and I was (and still am) really confident in the idea. It originally went through two renditions before the final one was posted onto the main site. It was inspired by the Solway Spaceman, and was encouraged by the 2001 film \"A Space Oddysey.\"\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3534\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3534]]] - Doomsyesterday**\n**Object Class:** Keter\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//\"Your music fucking sucks,\" he said.//\n[[/module]]\n> This is my entry for the Doomsday Contest as part of Team Mikasa consisting of [[*user stormbreath]], [[*user DrChandra]], [[*user Stallmantic]] and I. It's based in the War on All Fronts canon and explains the origins of the Crocosquid alongside its true Fifthist nature.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3830\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3830]]] - Sleeping With The Fishes**\n**Object Class:** Safe\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//Get put to sleep **by** the fishes.//\n[[/module]]\n> My first Safe-class article. I wanted to write an article about fish food for some reason, and then [[*user Dr_Aers]] dropped me with the dreaming concept and I altered it to be a betta fish doll. Then the rest kind of wrote itself. \n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-1131-J\"]]\n**[[[SCP-1131-J]]] - //It works guys! Trust me!//**\n**Object Class:** Thaumiel\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//**SCP-055:** Well shit.//\n[[/module]]\n@@@@\n> I always wanted to make an article about tinfoil hats. Truthfully, it started out as a -EX, but I just found it way too funny to make it serious 100% of the time. It's also my first ever attempted joke article. \n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3851\"]]\n**[[[SCP-3851]]] - You May Not Be Able To Drown Your Demons, But The Demons Can Drown Your Screams**[[footnote]]This title is purely based off of the title for the SCP found right above it in the Series IV list.[[/footnote]]\n**Object Class:** Safe\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//We are running out of food, heat, and, ironically, water.//\n[[/module]]\n> This is the second to an upcoming series that I plan on making quite creepy. Big thanks to my friend Kyle for helping me with the concept! The prologue to this SCP is [[[Every Last Drop]]] and probably won't make sense unless you read that.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-4315\"]]\n**[[[SCP-4315]]] - S.C.P. Lovecraft**\n**Object Class:** Keter\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//GRINDINGGRINDINGGRINDINGGRINDINGLIKEABABYCRYING//\n[[/module]]\n> My first Series V article and quite a pleasure to make with Gears. I personally really like how this turned out and it's my longest skip to date. I always wanted to write about history, and the 4k Contest finally allowed me to get the creative juices flowing. \n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-4655\"]]\n**[[[SCP-4655]]] - Comfort Comes In Many Different Forms**\n**Object Class:** Safe\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//We'll both miss her. Together.//\n[[/module]]\n> My second Series V article which was written for creepy vibes. I had this idea in my head for a while now and finally decided to type it out and I'm pretty satisfied with the final product. It's my first time trying to focus on scaring the audience, so I hope it managed to deliver.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-4598\"]]\n**[[[SCP-4598]]] - The Spiral Gestalt**\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//Er, stupid fucking mosquito.//\n[[/module]]\n> I created this article not long after reading another JamCon entry. Sometimes, we just look too deep into song lyrics, and this is what happens when Dr. Hammond himself falls into the spiral gestalt because of some song.\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-4810\"]]\n**[[[SCP-4810]]] - Hunt Stupid Game, Win Stupid Prizes**\n**Object Class:** Keter\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//We didn't kill her. We just made her scared.//\n[[/module]]\n> Another contest entry co-authored by [[*user Gabriel_Jade]]. I had a lot of fun  in this contest and I managed to learn a hell of a lot about writing, both independently and cooperatively, by working with the members of Team Inkblots. I really enjoyed writing this one alongside Jade and the concept that we managed to come up with tied in nicely with my want to create an article involving something creepy and crawly.\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Reports Filed]]\n[[=]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"every-last-drop\"]]\n**[[[Every Last Drop]]]**\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//I suppose it all started with one drop...//\n[[/module]]\n-----\n[[module ListPages name=\"the-light-will-attract-the-darkest-of-creatures\"]]\n**[[[The Light Will Attract the Darkest of Creatures]]]**\n**Posted:** %%created_at%%\n**Rating:** +%%rating%%\n//...it was the mysterious figure which stood before him, chowing down on the gory remains of Trey's puppy.//\n[[/module]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab ربي اغفر لي.ا]]\nNo, I'm not Arabic. I just like the aesthetic of Arabic words, both in English and in Arabic.\n\nHello! I'm [[*user DrCaroll]] and, while I have only been a member of this wiki for less than a month (at the time of writing this page), I've been involved in the SCP community for about three and a half years now. Unlike the majority of people, I wasn't actually pulled in by SCP:CB; I didn't even know what that was three and a half years ago. \n\nI gained knowledge of this wonderful community through a roleplay server on Garry's Mod. Originally, I was just a D-Class, and so I had thought it was some sort of prison roleplay server. I still enjoyed it nonetheless. \n\nAfter that, I noticed there were monstrosities that I was taken to see. I had no idea what they were, and so I asked out-of-character. They, of course, replied with \"it's an SCP,\" and I googled this wiki. Through the wiki, I gained knowledge of SCP:CB. Gotta be honest, though: not really a fan.\n\nI just continued to roleplay on Garry's Mod until I officially decided to join the wiki and contribute myself. I absolutely love this community, and I am always willing to help anyone with anything they might need help with. \n\nDon't be afraid to DM me if you have any inquiries! I'm also Junior Staff on Forum Crit, so DM me if you have a draft that you would like reviewed.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
