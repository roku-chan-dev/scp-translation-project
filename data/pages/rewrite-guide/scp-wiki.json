  "content": "++ Standard Rewrite Procedure\n\n++++ __**Step 1:** //Find Something to Rewrite//__\n\nMost articles eligible for rewrites are rated below -10. When this happens, the article will be eligible for deletion and a vote will begin. \n\nWhile the vote is open, people can offer to rewrite the article. If you are interested in rewriting the article, please message a member of the Rewrite Subteam.\n\nYou can also request to do a rewrite when an article is struggling, or an author asks for it specifically, but these are less common (see the frequently asked questions for more detail).\n\n\n++++ __**Step 2:** //Author Permission//__\n\n[[include component:image-block name=deletion3.jpg|caption=**Image 1:** PM requesting permission from the original author.]]\n\nYou //must// have permission from the original author to do a rewrite of an article that is less than a year old. You can either post on the forum, send them a chat PM, or ask in a Wikidot PM (example in **Image 1**). If you can provide proof of author permission, such as a screenshot, then you may start rewriting.\n\nIf the author does not respond or denies your request, you are not allowed to rewrite the article. Don't bug them about it; they have the final say on their work.\n\nIf the author is no longer around (as is the case with a lot of older articles), then the Rewrite Subteam will make the final call for you. This doesn't mean you can ignore the rest of this step though! //Always// make an attempt to contact the original author.\n\n++++ __**Step 3:** //Message from the Rewrite Subteam, and Rewriting!//__\n\nOnce you've stated your intent to rewrite,[[footnote]] Please keep in mind that this only applies to articles where the original author is no longer present or is older than 2 years. Staff do not mediate the rewrite process for rewrites agreed upon between authors.[[/footnote]] message a member of the rewrite subteam. They'll tag the article \"in-rewrite\", make a Staff Post, and you'll be able to get started.\n\nAfter that, get to it! The rewrite process is normally restricted to a 90 day period (Or in other words, three months) before we check in on you. If this restriction does not apply, your point of contact will inform you at the time of authorization Try to stay true to the original author's idea and narrative intentions.\n\n++++ __**Step 4:** //Team Clear! Feedback!//__\n\nWhen you've got a finalized draft, that you have already sought feedback on from others[[footnote]] It's always a good idea to get as much feedback from other site members as possible, before diving into that mainsite post. [[/footnote]] or are absolutely confident in, send a message to the member of Rewrite that authorized your effort. This can be done via a wiki PM, IRC, or on Discord. Once you've received three greenlights from the team, you're free to post.\n\nREMEMBER, the Rewrite Subteam may tell you that your article needs work or that you should get more feedback. In those cases, you are required to do what the team says before posting your rewrite, or you will need to edit the draft before resubmitting it for review. You can submit your draft for review a maximum of 3 (three) times. **See [#rejection What If My Rewrite Doesn't Get Approved?] for more details.**\n\nOnce you are cleared for posting, your Point of Contact will ask another member of staff with Mod Tools to move the original article to the {{unlisted}} category, making way for your rewrite!\n\n++++ __**Step 4A:** //This is for Staff with Mod Tools only//__\n\nAfter you move the old article to the {{unlisted}} category, make sure to tag it with \"unlisted\". Once this is done, go to the [[[attribution-metadata|metadata page]]] and navigate to the appropriate subpage, then add the (case-sensitive!) usernames of the original author(s) and rewriter(s).\n\n\n++++ __**Step 5:** //Post!//__\n\nOnce your Rewrite Team Point of Contact confirms to you that the previous steps are completed, you can post your rewrite! If the original SCP number is still available, you're free to use that. If you want to use another, you're free to do that as well.\n\n//Remember to make a post in the discussion thread stating://\n//1. That the article is a rewrite//\n//2. The original author's name//\n\nYou're done! Wait for the votes and comments to come in and PM the original author to let them know the revamp has gone live.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[# rejection]]\n++ **What If My Rewrite Doesn't Get Approved?**\n[[/=]]\nWhen you submit a draft for review by the Rewrite team, there are multiple outcomes:\n# The draft received three greenlights from the team, and is approved for posting.\n# The draft received three greenlights from the team, and is approved for posting, on the condition that specific errors are addressed beforehand.\n# The draft did not receive three greenlights, and was rejected by the team. Feedback is sent to the rewrite author, and they are given the chance to revise and rework their draft.\n\n**However**, to prevent drafts staying in rewrite forever, the Rewrite team has implemented a maximum number of times a draft can be submitted to the team for review. You can only get a draft review for approval by the team a maximum of **3 (three)** times.\n\n+++ The Final Submission\nOn the final submission of a draft for review to the rewrite team, your point of contact will confirm that you are aware that this is your final chance for submission. If you agree to that, the team will review the article. From this situation, there are two outcomes.\n# Your article receives three greenlights, and is approved for posting, with or without edits.\n# Your article receives three 'redlights' and is rejected.\n\nLet's take a minute to explain the second outcome. When reviewing a final submission of a rewrite, **and only then**, rewrite team members have the ability to either greenlight or redlight the rewrite. In this case, a redlight is a vote that this piece is not ready for posting. If a draft receives three redlights, then it is rejected. **This is why we suggest to ensure your draft receives critique and review before submission to the rewrite team.**\n\n+++ So What Then?\n\nIf your draft receives three redlights, your point of contact will reach out to you and inform you that your rewrite attempt has failed the final review. Your rewrite authorization will be rescinded, and the article will be returned to being `rewriteable`.\n\nIn addition, to prevent authors from requesting rewrite authorization for the same article immediately after the final rejection, the author will be prohibited from applying for another rewrite authorization for **that specific article** for a period of 90 days. At the end of that 90 day period, the author may once again reach out to any member of the rewrite team and the process can start again fresh.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n++ **Frequently Asked Questions!**\n[[/=]]\n\nCheck here first to see if your question has been asked already. As more questions are asked, this list will grow.\n\n**//Q.) Does doing a rewrite save the original article's number on the mainlist?//**\nA.) Usually, yes. If it's available, you can use the number the original author picked. Otherwise, feel free to use any of the other open slots to post your article! On a case by case basis, the rewrite subteam can elect to grant a stay of deletion to articles more than two years old if said articles are in the process of being rewritten and are below the deletion deadline. Should a stay be granted, prompt completion of the rewrite is expected from its author.\n\n**//Q.) Do I receive author credit for my completed article?//**\nA.) Yes!  Make sure to remind the member of Staff who unlists the original article to include your username in the [[[Attribution Metadata]]] list for you so that you can be properly credited. \n\n**//Q.) How much do I need to stick to the original article, in terms of concept and theme?//**\nA.) Depends on who you talk to. You don't want to plagiarize and copy the original article exactly. You also don't want to write something so different that people don't see the original ideas anymore. Try to strike a happy medium where the //concept// of the original stays similar, but you play with variations on //theme// or //background//.\n\n**//Q.) Who are these Rewrite Subteam members I keep hearing about?//**\nA.) Currently, the Rewrite Subteam consists of:\n**SubTeam Captain:** [[*user Riemann]] (Mod Tools)\n**Vice Captain:** [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] (Mod Tools)\n**Team Members:** [[*user stormbreath]] (Mod Tools), [[*user Astersquill]] (Mod Tools), [[*user VapidPoem]], [[*user weizhong]], [[*user fairydoctor]], [[*user Queerious]], [[*user halcyon_days]], [[*user Synthpanda_]]\n**Administrative Contacts:** [[*user aismallard]] (Primary Contact), [[*user Dexanote]], [[*user thedeadlymoose]]\n\n**//Q.) What if the author never responds to my request?//**\nA.) This is where it can get a little bit tricky. This is the current Rewrite Subteam protocol concerning this awkward situation:\n\n**If the article is <1 year old:** No dice. If the author does not respond, assume that you cannot proceed with the rewrite.\n**If the article is 1-2 years old:** If the article is 0 or negative, then proceed with the rewrite with Rewrite Subteam approval.\n**If the article is >2 years old:** Go ahead with the rewrite if the article is <10 in rating. Articles just barely above this can be rewritten with Rewrite Subteam approval on a case-by-case basis. Contact a Rewrite Subteam member about this situation if you have a special circumstance.\n\n**A list of articles that fall under this category can be found [[[articles-eligible-for-rewrite |here]]].** Please note that this is not an extensive list and rewrite will still use discretion on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**//Q.) It sounds like the Rewrite process only happens with articles at low ratings? What's up with that?//**\nA.) Not so! Rewrites can be done at any rating as long as the original author gives their assent! If a rewrite happens to a higher rated article, you'll still need to unlist the original page and repost in the number slot where applicable! When you're cleared to post, simply let someone on the team know and we will unlist the article to make way for your rewrite.\n\n**//Q.) Can I rewrite an -ARC article?//**\nA.) Sure! In that case, once the rewrite gets to a high enough rating, the original will be unlisted!\n\n**//Q.) Can I rewrite my own articles?//**\nA.) Absolutely! You can rewrite your own article whenever you want without requiring input from the Rewrite team. By the way, you're free to repost the article if you have made substantial enough changes, and this is in fact recommended.\n\nFeel free to PM any of them with any additional questions you might have!",
