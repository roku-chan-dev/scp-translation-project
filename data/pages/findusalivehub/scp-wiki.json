All escape attempts thus far have been met with failure, but efforts will continue as long as supplies and mental fortitude may last. Every day, we stray a little farther from reality.\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/findusalivehub/trailer\n]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++ We are still here.\n\n++ We are alive.\n\n++ ##magenta|**Find us.**##\n\n [[/=]]\n \n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n++ Site-107 Personnel of Note\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Dr. Harley]]\n\n**Name:** Dr. ██████ Edmund Harley //(he/him)//\n\n**Position:** Communications Operator\n\n**Clearance Level:** 2\n\n**Details:** Verbose, theatrical, know-it-all.
