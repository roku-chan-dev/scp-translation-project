Experimentation with SCP-7624 is currently suspended pending further risk assessment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7624 is an orange regulation-size table tennis ball with no other distinct physical characteristics.  Its activation, facilitated by former researcher Dr. Emily Carter, triggers a transient portal originating from the activation point. This portal leads to a stable temporal spatial anomaly, hereafter referred to as SCP-7624-1.\n\nSCP-7624-1 consists of endless network of stalls, booths, and pop-up shops, resembling The Grand Bazaar in Turkey. Ongoing efforts are being undertaken to chart and map SCP-7624-1. Due to the interior orientation of the bazaar, no exterior region of SCP-7624-1 has been observed. On arrival, visitors would appear at an archway with the sign 'Beyond Time Bazaar'.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7624/SCP-xXXX-a |\ncaption=SCP-7624-A |\nalign=left |\nwidth=300px00\n]]\n\nSCP-7624-A is a group of a hundred and one (101) autonomous humanoid constructs that appears to be made of porcelain and is fluent in various ancient and modern languages. SCP-7624-A behavior consists of guiding visitors through SCP-7624-1 and will bring visitors to their desired location.\n\nThe items traded consist of unknown or unidentifiable artifacts, technologies not known to be discovered and anomalies from various alternate timelines. The oldest artifact identified was a rock hammer said to belong to the first men dated approximately 250,000 BCE. All trades performed in SCP-7624-1 are through barter and no currency is noted to be used. \n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Discovery:** SCP-7624 was discovered following Incident 7624-1 involving researcher Dr Emily Carter and a previously unknown entity (now identified as PoI-8710).

Let's delve into something that arose during your recent exploration. The encounter with Cody, the vendor of futuristic technology. You considered bringing such technology back. What were your thoughts on that?\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Pausing, contemplative]// Cody's offerings do hold potential benefits for the Foundation's research and containment efforts. However, I'm well aware of the dangers of destabilizing the timeline with technology from other dimensions. \n> \n> **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Supportive]// It's clear that you're cognizant of the implications. Now, during your interactions, you mentioned other Foundation agents from different dimensions. How do you view their actions and truthfulness?\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Thoughtful]// The agents from other dimensions are likely facing distinct circumstances that I can't fully comprehend. However, their intentions might be guided by their own versions of reality. Truthfulness could be subjective, influenced by their unique contexts.\n> \n> **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Probing]// Considering that, could you imagine yourself in their position? Would you ever consider actions that deviate from our Foundation's core principles?\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Taken aback]// Sara, I am unequivocally committed to the Foundation's principles. The idea of compromising those principles for personal gain or manipulating the timeline is an affront to the trust placed in us as researchers and protectors of humanity.\n> \n> **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Noting the tension]// My apologies if my question came across as doubting your commitment, Emily. It's my duty to explore all angles.\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Taking a deep breath]// Understood, Sara. Our role is to question and analyze. Now, if you'll allow me, there's a matter that weighs on my thoughts.\n> \n> **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Attentive]// Of course, Emily. Please, share your thoughts.\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Softly]// My son. I know that the nature of SCP-7624 and its possibilities is complex. It's difficult not to imagine the potential of reuniting with him.

I can't fathom the emotions tied to such contemplations.\n> \n> **Dr. Carter:** //[Resolute]// The bazaar is a place of wonders, but it's not a realm of miracles. My mission remains anchored in understanding anomalies and ensuring that our actions protect the timeline, even if that means confronting the limitations of our powers.\n> \n> **Dr. Lloyd:** //[Nodding, with respect]// Your dedication is inspiring, Emily.
