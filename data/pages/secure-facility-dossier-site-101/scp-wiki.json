Highlights of our accomplishments include:\n\n**Ecological Preservation:** The conservatory at Site-101 is the largest, most biodiverse collection of anomalous flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Site-101 is home to a variety of rare specimens, including the only extant living samples of slaying nettle (//urtica mortiferum//), grizzly bane (//aconitum maleficarum//), and Eurasian torpor thorn (//prunus sinestrum//). \n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/thesecretchunk/101-3.jpg|caption=The warm, damp climate of Site-101 provides ideal growing conditions for plants, parasites, algae and fungus.|width=350px]]\n\n**Innovative Solutions:** While Site-101 is proud to have been born on the bayou, we’ve still felt the impact of the region’s recent environmental hardships. As local populations of bees and other pollinators surrounding Site-101 continue to reach critically low levels, we’ve turned to exclusive Foundation technology to help us climb into the future of anomalous horticulture. Using recent developments in microrobotics, an estimated 90% of pollination is now performed by autonomous drones. But don’t worry: despite its population reduction, our friend the bee is still buzzing with excitement to do its part! [[footnote]]Caution: Most species of bees found at Site-101 are resistant to all known pesticides, and, on account of the aggressive behavior they display towards humans, should not be classified as friends.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Constant Growth:** To keep up with Foundation needs, the Site-101 conservatory is constantly expanding. In recent years our flora have expanded into the site's northern campus, and now occupy the entire eastern wing of the Site-101 Research and Development Center, most of the Nathaniel Aubépine Research Library, and the first three floors of the site Medical Bay and Mortuary Building. Director Rappaccini estimates that by 2028, her specimens will cover an additional 25 acres of land, representing the fastest growth of any Foundation facility in the United States. \n\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"didyou\"]]\n**Did you know?**\n\nMany of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7493 specimens] contained at Site-101 were first cultivated at this very site by the late Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini. Although his discoveries were so bold and innovative that they required Foundation intervention to prevent their broader distribution, in his daughter's steady hands they have grown into miracles of modern medicine.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"beatrice\"]]\n\nYou cannot instruct a flower not to grow. Give her the tiniest space to take hold, and in time her roots will split the mightiest rock in two. Look at your walls. The only parts of them that will last forever are their cracks.

To enjoy a long, fruitful career at Site-101, make sure to exercise caution when interacting with our more volatile specimens. \n\nBefore arriving at Site-101, make sure to familiarize yourself with these basic safety precautions:\n\n* Always wear a respirator when working with specimens inside the conservatory, or any of its annexes. If you are not certain whether the specimens have annexed a particular area of the campus, please consult the most recent available copy of the campus directory.\n\n* Do not make direct physical contact with Site Director Rappaccini. If contact has been made, seek poison control immediately.\n\n* As pollen dispersal patterns can be unpredictable, wear a mask or other protective face covering in all common areas, private offices and dormitories.\n\n* Inspect your protective suit regularly for tears or punctures, and seek a replacement immediately if any damage is discovered. If the punctures appear to have been made from the inside of the suit, request a full physical examination by reporting to the --2nd-- --3rd-- 4th floor of the Medical Bay and Mortuary Building.\n\n* Do not eat food that has been exposed to open air for an extended period of time. Hermetically sealed prepared foods can be purchased at the site commissary. Food stored in Site Director Rappaccini's office or living quarters should not be classified as safe for human consumption. \n\n* Make sure to study the full site handbook’s list of mnemonics to aid in identifying hazards. For example, to recognize the color patterns on the petals of the Polynesian stinging orchid, remember:\n\n[[=]]\n//Blue then red, you'll soon be dead//\n//Red then blue will kill you too//\n[[/=]]\n\n* In the event that you are recruited to directly assist Site Director Rappaccini on any ongoing projects, make sure to first submit all necessary waivers of liability, and wait at least two weeks to allow time for your replacement to be onboarded. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"beatrice\"]]\n\nOur site staff, just like our specimens, are among the rarest in the world, but what makes them precious is what makes them dangerous.

But who among us truly knows how to be modest?\n\n//— Site Director Beatrice Rappaccini//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"custom-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ A Fruitful Endeavor\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/thesecretchunk/101-6.png height=\"40px\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"custom-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWe hope you’re as excited to begin your research here at Site-101 as we are to welcome you aboard. Every employee, whether it's their first day on the job or their last day before early retirement, is essential to the work that we do here. We hope your appointment to Site-101 will be the start of a long, prosperous tenure. [[footnote]]Remember: New appointees to Site-101 are not eligible for reassignment until at least three months following their start date.[[/footnote]]\n\nIf you're ever in search of guidance on your professional journey, just remember these words from Site Director Rappaccini:\n\n[[div class=\"beatrice\"]]\n\nWe are more than just a research facility. We are more than just a family. We are an ecosystem. A single blade of grass is not a forest, but what would a forest be without grass? Some specimens are destined to thrive, while others exist only to feed those that bloom in their wake. Whichever you are, a beginning or an ending, you have a place here. When you join Site-101, you will no longer be a solitary weed stranded in a desert of pavement. You will be an element of something bigger. You will become a part of the process.\n\nThis world is a series of cycles: life and death, birth and rebirth, beginnings and endings. From the very jaws of death, we brew the elixir of life. Venom is our antidote. Curare is our cure. Poison is our panacea.\n\nThe chalice of possibility overflows. All you must do now is drink.\n\n-- //Site Director Beatrice Rappaccini// \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n||||~ More in this Series||\n||~ Part One||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/her-future-in-bloom Her Future in Bloom] by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/panik-s-perfection-in-progress Mr Panik]||\n||~ Part Two||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7493## SCP-7493] by Socksesforfoxes||\n||~ Part Three||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-101 Secure Facility Dossier: Site-101] by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thechunk TheChunk]||\n||~ Part Four||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-small-doses In Small Doses] by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thechunk TheChunk]||\n||~ Part Five||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fruit-of-the-poison-tree Fruit of the Poison Tree] by Socksesforfoxes||\n\n[[div class=\"blank\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=TheChunk]]\n> **Filename:** 101-1.jpg\n> **Name:** ruins of overgrown conservatory\n> **Author:** Tysto\n> **License:**  CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/726cad0f-1432-4fa4-9716-270297ba8dc0?q=overgrown+conservatory&p=1\n\n> **Filename:** monkshood2.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user SocksesForFoxes]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:** This image is altered from:\n> **Name:** Monk's-Hood\n> **Author:** Theo Crazzolara\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://flickr.com/photos/theocrazzolara/36084941514/in/photolist-WYGKW3-bV39Er-Ljs9se-d5Fgww-tUfHB7-fHvmGe-otKi2M-2ap1vuj-acfwai-2aJnQ6a-29irvgu-cddGa7-cddAhU-2jaffDX-bVRm7P-cddNzb-cddBTm-cXeVe3-cddHpL-bVRx2a-cddEU7-cddJp9-bVRmAp-HyRyZp-HvTo2C-GDdVKy-HyRyUz-HyRyYH-HyRyWZ-29isDVG-HyRz3R-29irvPU-HvTo77-HyRz28-27SofYw-27Sog6A-2nea91F-ZvPiL8-vHAqBa-a2vuD5-MnCqF5-vHAqfP-vKrxhQ-MGfFTv-db2s1V-vKMJHe-LSbkDS-291GYAH-29isEiq-66imgU/]\n\n> **Filename:** 101-2.jpg\n> **Name:** Tützpatz - Herrenhaus (1779/1908)\n> **Author:** onnola\n> **License:**  CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/e358b311-ec19-4f6c-b72e-c0c87557db3d?q=overgrown+castle&p=7\n\n> **Filename:** 101-3.jpg\n> **Name:** Forgotten glass house, UK, jcw1967, 1Ds, OPE (12)\n> **Author:** jcw1967 \n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/c87da9cf-39f2-4916-8aeb-d2172033635d?q=abandoned+greenhouse&p=179\n\n> **Filename:** 101-4.jpg\n> **Name:** The Hot Spring at Bath (HDR)\n> **Author:** Alun Salt\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/85982510-bf12-49f7-ad1d-19ba280496ab\n\n\n> **Filename:** 101-5.jpg\n> **Name:** Is sleeping beauty here?\n> **Author:** Julien Harneis\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/89791658-2555-41ea-bc15-19de21ba98e5\n\n\n> **Filename:** 101-6.png\n> **Author:** [[*user TheChunk]]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Derivative Of:** \n> **Filename:** Solanum dulcamara petals.jpg\n> **Author:** \tHüseyin Cahid Doğan\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Solanum_dulcamara_petals.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** ivylogo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user TheChunk]]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> This image is derived from:\n> **Name:** Tree Against Wall of Ivy\n> **Author:** Jonathan Kriz\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/27587002@N07/7224090988 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** 101logo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user socksesforfoxes]] & [[*user TheChunk]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
