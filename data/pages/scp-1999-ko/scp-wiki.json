The case is being discussed.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The instance cannot be contained. To minimise the damage caused by the instance, the Foundation must examine all mass media, such as music, TV programmes  and novels, and related personnel, and expunge all related data when neccesary.\n\nThe SCP-1999-KO containment department should collect and view all documents, books, audio and video records related to the \"Fifthist Church\", and focus on identifying its ultimate goal and meaning. Fierce, in-depth inter-branch discussions are advised to do so.\n\n//Revised 2022-09-17:// Contact with the art director Nikita Illich Yezhov of the \"Noonday Oak Troupe\" must be minimised. Unauthorised contact will result in disciplinary measures.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1999-KO refers to all events related to the \"Fifthist Church\", or \"Fifthism\". In 1990, the Foundation was conducting research about newly formed religions centered around the new age movement. During the research, the Foundation first came in contact with the anomalous organism formed around numerology and mysticism, the \"Fifthist Chruch\". The members called themselves \"Fifthists\". Unlike the new religions at the time, Fifthism was preaching the theory that \"everything happens from five\", not the religious unity of \"all religions ultimately deliver the same teachings\". However, it was difficult to collect information about their exact doctrines or ideas for reasons to be described later. Research about the goal and meaning of the \"Fifthist Church\" was initiated after the first contact. However, events similar to the ones mentioned below started happening sporadically.\n\n* [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747 More frequent mentions about a non-existent mass medium]\n* Drug-related crimes skyrocket by 150%\n* ████████████ increase by 50%, thus causing [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n Extensive investigation about the exact doctrines and ideology are under progress, but the interpretation is slow as the information gathered are chaotic and disorganised. The only established pieces of information are as follows:\n\n* The organisation worships a concept called \"Five\".\n* They are related to a hostile reality-destroying entity known as \"Seven\".\n* Some sects have a deep relationship with music.\n\nDespite regular extensive discussions, no meaningful conclusions have been made.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 10. 9. 2022 08:44\n**Subject:** Interviewee selection\n[[/div]]\n-----\nOfficer.

However, after considering the possible risks and the organisation's compliance, we thought NOTE was the best option. Hence, the list.\n \nChopinists are the zealots they are. They collided with the Foundation numerous times because of that. We thought they were too risky. The Aesthetic of Music Sound is still hostile to us after failing to reach an agreement on the retrieval of anomalous instances.\n\nWe did consider The Magic Orchestra since they're friendly. But the tripartite meeting between us, the Serpent's Hand, and The Magic Orchestra didn't go well. The Diplomacy Department recommended that we don't contact them. On a side note, I think that had to do with the Serpent's Hand. Maybe the Foundation tried digging too deep into the connection between the two...\n\nAnyways, so, we think the most effective and safest choice is NOTE.

The Foundation focused on that while Fifthists can be erratic and disorganised, some do musical activities or participate in the music industry. The Foundation suspected that anomalous musical societies might hold information about the Fifthists. Thus, a member from the Noonday Oak Troupe was selected, as it is a musical GoI which is very friendly to the Foundation and does not possess dangerous anomalous instances or powers.\n-----\n\n[Start of Log]\n\n[Omitted]\n\n(Yezhov seems annoyed.)\n\n**Yezhov:** I mean... Haah...\n\n(Yezhov gestures for a cigarette. The request was denied.)\n\n**Yezhov:** ...I'm here because the Foundation went overboard with oppressing art and media. My troupe suffered the damage, and I'm requesting the Foundation does something about...\n\n**Lee Yuri:** Mr Yezhov, please focus on the question. I asked you about bands related to Fifthists.\n\n(Short silence)\n\n**Lee Yuri:** Contact our official diplomatic desk for that matter. We're not here for diplomacy but for a regular interview.\n\n**Yezhov:** What's your deal with those junkies?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** (Silently sighs) We have a serious matter.\n\n**Yezhov:** (In a slightly upset voice) Then lock those junkies up and leave us alone! Are you afraid of that monster the bastards keep talking about or something?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** ...Can you say that again?\n\n**Yezhov:** ... Is that actually the reason...? All this fuss over that...? That Seven or Seventy things or whatever?\n\n(Lee requests termination of the interview and detainment of the interviewee on the interface for breach of security protocols. Request denied.)\n\n**Yezhov:** (Sigh)... Can I please have a smoke?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** No.\n\n**Yezhov:** Yeah, whatever...\n\n(Yezhov grabs onto his head and keeps talking.)\n\n**Yezhov:** So... What did you say? What is Fifthism?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** Yes..\n\n**Yezhov:** Junkies. But with anomalous tech. That's it.\n\n(Short silence)\n\n**Yezhov:** I'll be blunt. We're musicians. But we have anomalous tech. And I know all well that you think of as nothing. Fifthists are junkies. But they have anomalous tech. What's all this commotion, then?\n\n(Lee Yuri requests approval to mention superior classified information. Request granted)\n\n**Lee Yuri:** Their documents and conversation logs, anomalous phenomena, some parts don't make sense...\n\n**Yezhov:** You think they'll be coherent after all those drugs?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** But too many of them disappear or die...\n\n**Yezhov:** Don't you think all those drugs will kill them?\n\n(Short Silence)\n\n**Yezhov:** You know... I know you love your flawless definitions and orderly classifications because of you're academics... But do you need those for the gibberish those junkies say? You can't make sense of what they say because there is none. You can't understand the anomalous phenomena? Of course, because there's no meaning there. 1982, 457, 38546, 22. Do you know what I mean? You wouldn't. That's because I just blurted out whatever just came to mind. But why do you keep trying to find meaning in this sequence?\n\n**Lee Yuri:** ...We found clear evidence of danger. We suffered damages from them.\n\n**Yezhov:** I'm not saying they're safe or harmless. Of course, they're dangerous. But being dangerous is a whole different thing from bearing meaning. Why are you complicating things? Do you think that every piece of rock on the street has meaning?\n\n(Short Silence)\n\n(Lee requests permission to mention the highest classified information. Request granted.)\n\n**Lee Yuri:** Them, what is Seven?\n\n(Yezhov closes his eyes for a while and thinks. Then he opens his eyes)\n\n**Yezhov:** Just a beast. Nothing more. You, people, would have contained it already if you weren't obsessed with those junkies.\n\n**Lee Yuri:** But we suffered significant damage from that Seven. So that...\n\n**Yezhov:** Are you afraid of being bitten by a lion in the zoo? Is it because you saw those junkies tripping into the lion cage? Why are you scared, saying we should do this or we shouldn't do that? Just add another lock or another cage, or feed the lion until it's stuffed and throw some toys inside. You guys stuck your arm inside to get it torn off. Why are you throwing a fit in front of anomalous artists? You feed the lion stories. The world is made of stories. If you talk about our reality, then it's a story. It's nothing big.\n\n**Lee Yuri:** So...(Sigh) So, Seven is now...\n\n**Yezhov:** We have it.\n\n**Lee Yuri:** What?\n\n**Yezhov:** Some people keep lions. Why are you surprised?\n\n[Omitted]\n\n[End of Log]\n\n-----\n\n**Note:** Following the interview, the SCP-1999-KO Containment Department gathered an emergency meeting and started an extensive discussion.

Also, the Foundation has no reason to be defamed.\n\nIn addition, there were minority opinions such as \"this opportunity should be used to expand the direction of the investigation\" and \"the intensity of the investigation should be reduced experimentally and step by step using resource relocation\".\n\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 14. 9. 2022. 15:38\n**Subject:** Reconfirmation of extensive investigation review plan\n[[/div]]\n-----\nOfficer?\nCan I ask how it is going about the review of the extensive investigation plan I sent earlier?\nI contacted you first because we didn't get a response from you.

It will focus on Taiwan, where the Noonday Oak Troupe headquarters is located. The investigation will also cover the possibility that the Taiwanese Fifthists possess a particularly lower risk.\n\n--------\n\n**Contents:** Fifthists in Taiwan form many smaller groups. No sign of anomalous traits or phenomena has been observed yet. However, it should be noted that the investigation is in its earlier stages.\n\nThe most active group is located in Kaohsiung City. Exploiting its proximity to the harbour, the group is involved in smuggling items such as illicit drugs and illegally obtained money. The contrabands are thought to be distributed among the Fifthists spread around Taiwan.\n\nAn interesting link between the Fifthists and NOTE members was uncovered during the pursuit. Currently, no other anomalous nor non-anomalous activity has been found between the two groups besides drug trade and musical gatherings. The NOT members indeed do drugs, but the fact that other trades may be going on under the surface cannot be overlooked. Hence, an investigation of the leaders of both groups is underway. The act of singing to each other is key.\n\nDirect, on-site evidence of anomalous phenomena has not been found yet, but indirect pieces of evidence are being found at the moment. Especially the significantly higher death rates near the Fifthists can be solved with death. The most notable are automobiles, especially the rising costs of car repair centres, sales of microfibre towels for cars, SUV lovers club member increase and decrease support this, according to anomalous statisticians.\n\nFifthists obsessing with five can be related to the fact that we are doing this in the fifth paragraph is the strongest link or maybe its not or is it or is it not so we should again review the fifth investigation records and bet our five fingers that the fifth brother exists and ask the fifth question and fivefivefivefivefive of the five power is the answer. This shall be decided by the OFive council though the quorum should be five.\n\nAnalysis of the aforementioned investigation records indicates evidence of weak but prominent anomalous phenomena. Longer observational research on the subject is advised.\n-------\n\n**Overall Discussion of the Investigation:** Agent Woo-Seok Kim seemed normal when he submitted the report. The following interrogations showed that he did not find the report strange. An extensive investigation did not find significant anomalies. The Containment Department concluded that:\n\n* The incident is a preemptive assault on the Foundation. Therefore, firm and active counteractions are required.\n\nIn addition, there were minority opinions such as \"Discretion is advised, as multiple organizations are involved.\"\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 19. 9. 2022. 23:49\n**Subject:** Good work.\n[[/div]]\n-----\nI hope your extensive discussion went well, officer.\nI'll send you the aggregated data I told you before.\nWe finished a general background check of the person the NOTE Art Director mentioned.\nPlease see the attachment for details.\n##901|**Attachments:**## [# 1999koNOTE_personal_info_list.docx], [# 1999koTaiwan_anomalous_artists_list.docx], [# 1999kobackground_check_log.docx]\n----\n[[>]]\nSCP-1999-KO Containment Department\nChief Investigator Lee Yuri\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 14. 9. 2022. 23:53\n**Subject:** RE: Good work.\n[[/div]]\n-----\nOK, checked.\nI appreciate you working this late at night.\nAlso, is everything alright with the situation mentioned in the meeting?\n----\n[[>]]\nSCP-1999-KO Containment Department\nContainment Officer Kim Sohwa\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 14. 9. 2022. 23:55\n**Subject:** RE: RE: Good work.\n[[/div]]\n-----\nYes, It's fine.

My deepest apologies that NOTE currently cannot provide you with an official opinion. I'll make sure to give you one as soon as possible.\n> \n> In the past five days, inspections on anomalous artists have grown worryingly frequent. Moreover, there are accusations of kidnapping, assault and torture that violate the \"Multi-party agreement about the conservation of anomalous artistic activities and preservation of normality\". \n> Some perceive the recent events as a focalised attack on us, the Noonday Oak Troupe, supported by the fact that they occurred in Taiwan, our geographic and spiritual home. \n> We have requested multiple times to explain what is happening in President Jang San's name. However, the Foundation's persistent silence is deeply concerning. \n> \n> Nevertheless, I'll provide you with my personal answer to the Foundation's inquiries. \n> \n> We are reaching an agreement to decline your request to transfer the personal information of one of our members, called SCP-1999-KO-A by the Foundation. As per the \"Multi-party agreement about the conservation of anomalous artistic activities and preservation of normality\", involved artistic organisations must transfer assets and personnel if it is deemed to be a threat to normality. However, it is difficult to accept the opinion that Fifthism, drug use, and the number of traffic accidents are a threat to normality.\n> \n> We interact with almost every anomalous art organisation. Fifthists are merely one of them - their correlation is purely a supposition. Indeed, the member did communicate with AWCY, and many others interacted with Fifthism. Drug use is clearly wrong, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with a threat to normality. The law enforcement of each nation should handle it.\n> \n> As for traffic accidents... To be frank, I can't help but doubt my eyes when I read it. I checked the increase in traffic incidents sourced by an acquaintance of mine... There were twenty more - twenty, including fender-benders like a moped scraping some paint off a car's rear door.\n> \n> As a friend of a Foundation, who once pursued the same ideals, I ask you this: Why? Are you alright? You told me that you need to know about SCP-1999-KO-A's anomalous phenomena. I'm not sure what it is, but... The rapidly worsened oppression after you came in contact with the Fifthists, your paranoid obsession with drug users and the stuff they wrote, and how you're acting right now are... I worry that you're occupied with the wrong thing.\n> \n> You're breaking us apart. But remember, you'll break yourself apart after us. Please secure your rationality, contain the chaos, and protect yourselves, like the Foundation's motto you told us when our two organisations first met.\n> \n> Noonday Oak Troupe Ngô Tihan\n\nAs for the email, the Containment Department concluded that:\n\n* The Noonday Oak Troupe possesses minuscule levels of anomalous technology compared to the Foundation. Listening to such an organisation's opinions is too high of a risk.\n* Conversely, it can be deduced that the Noonday Oak Troupe is deliberately protecting SCP-1999-KO-A, based on the email.\n\nThere were no minority opinions. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@yglass@scip.net@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@scip.net@@##\n**Date:** 30. 9. 2022. 16:11\n**Subject:** There was an email from Diplomacy.\n[[/div]]\n-----\nThe Diplomacy Department sent an email to me.\nThey're furious that we took a hard line without their consultation.\nI clearly told them you're coming back, but they sent the message to me.

Work and documents regarding Fifthism will be transferred to appropriate teams, followed by the disbanding of the SCP-1999-KO containment department.\n\nAn interview between the SCP-1999-KO Containment Officer and Pataphysics Department leader is scheduled.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**Sender:** ##red|@@@kimsohwa@55555.55555@@##\n**Recipient:** ##red|@@@55555@55555.55555@@##\n**Date:** 55. 55. 5555. 55:55\n**Subject:** The end.\n[[/div]]\n-----\nYeah, I know. It's quite abrupt.\nBut what can I do? That's how rookies are.\n...But I'm happy. Thanks to you, I know\nEven if this world is deleted\nIt's one I've created, and it's one I've ended.\nYes, it didn't get consumed by Seven. It didn't become a story that never existed.\nEven if it is deleted, that means at least someone read my article. \nSo, this world, this story, exists.\n\nBut I can't help being powerless, this ending. \nWhat is this? 'So Fifthism was all drugs, and the world was collapsing on my hysteria'...\nOh, sure, sure. No canons, sure, sure.\nAnd I'm just another containment officer engulfed by Fifthists. Yeah, right.\nOh, people will just love it, right?\n\n\n... Then what? I didn't force stuff onto other people's stories.\nInstead, I took their advice as my own and created my story.\nThat's all that matters.\n\n\n\nDo I look less like a rookie now?\n----\n[[>]]\nFive\nKim Sohwa\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[module css]]\n.email {\n    background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/SCP_icon%281%29.png) top right no-repeat;\n    border: solid 3px #444444;\n    width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px;\n    margin: auto; margin-top: 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-width: 2px;\n    border-color: #999 #901 #901 #999;\n}\n\n.tofrom {\n    margin-left: 0.625rem;\n    margin-top: 0.312rem;\n    padding: 0 1em;\n    border-left: 3px solid;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n    border-color: #901;\n}\n\n.tofrom strong {\n    color: #901;\n}\n\n.footnoteref{\ncolor: #FF5555;\n}\n\n.danke{\npadding: 5px 5px 5px 15px;\nmargin-bottom:10px;\nwidth: 100%;\nfont-family: monospace;\nfont-size: 1.2em; }\n\n.agent{\nbackground-color:#002200;\nborder: 3px solid #55AA55;\ncolor: #77CC77;\n}\n\n.site{\nbackground-color:#222200;\nborder: 3px solid #AAAA55;\ncolor: #DDDD77;\n}\n.computed {\nborder: 1px black solid;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.computed:before {\ncontent:\"Computed Code\";\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.rawcode {\nborder: black solid 1px;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.rawcode:before{\ncontent:\"Raw Code\";\ntext-align: center;\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.codebox {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nwidth: 100%;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a em,  .yui-navset .yui-nav a em{\npadding: 0.25em .75em;\ntop: 0px;\nmargin-bottom: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected {\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:focus, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:hover, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a, .yui-navset .yui-navset-top .yui-nav a {\nbackground-color: none;\nbackground-image: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a {\nbackground: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav li{\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-content {\nbackground-color: #FDFCF9;\n}\n[[/module]]",
