Raynes,,\n[[/>]]\n**Item #:** SCP-7169\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Discoveries regarding SCP-7169 within the civilian scientific community are to be censored.\n\nSCP-7169's Tinder profile has been expunged. A Foundation-made webcrawler has been discreetly implemented into the site's source code to screen for any future communication attempts by the anomaly. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=scp-xxxx\n|caption=SCP-7169, as observed from Space Force 3\n|align=right\n]]\n**Description:** \nSCP-7169 is a sapient, terrestrial exoplanet orbiting the star Alkaid within the Ursa Major constellation. The anomaly is roughly 12,000 kilometers in diameter with an approximate mass of 4.868 Ã— 10^^24^^ kg, and orbits its star at a rate of approximately 47,000 km/hr. \n\nAlthough SCP-7169 does not possess any evidence of advanced civilization on its surface[[footnote]]Only naturally formed structures can be observed, such as mountains, valleys, and rivers.[[/footnote]], the anomaly is capable of instantaneous communication with Earth via the Internet, which it has so far used exclusively to engage with the online dating service, Tinder. Barring one incident, SCP-7169's activity on Tinder has been unsuccessful in finding suitable partners.\n\n//**Attempted Communication**//\nTerrance Cassidy, a Foundation janitor, discovered SCP-7169 while attempting to find a suitable partner during his off hours. Cassidy was reprimanded for his delay in reporting his discovery to Foundation researchers and was promptly fired. \n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ Sexy hot planet gf\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]cool pics, make those youself?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]You could say that ;] like?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]yeah theyre cool as shit! _\nman, gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous _\nhowd you do it? _\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]hehe, thanks[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]idk, really.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]couuple billion years as a hot could of gas _\nlots of time as that gas getting hotter and _\nturning into an iron core, _\nlittle more time waiting for asteroids _\nand other space rocks to crash into _\neach other.

Should this occur, they will be re-amnestizised. This event occured during a temporary, short term blackout that resulted in the malfunction of the security cameras stationed outside the residence.[[/footnote]]. A number of contraceptives were found in dissarray within the residence, all severely burned. A large hole in the ceiling of Cassidy's home was present, although the cause of the structural damage is unclear. \n\nSince this incident, SCP-7169 and Terrance Cassidy have deleted their Tinder profiles. The anomaly has thus far not attempted to re-establish its connection to the site, or any other web address on the Internet. All attempted communications with the anomaly have been met with a single phrase response, detailed below:\n\n> Happily engaged. Kindly fuck off my DMs\n\nInvestigations into Terrance Cassidy's whereabouts are on-going.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** scp-xxxx\n> **Name:** plant\n> **Author:** Marceline_Raynes\n> **License:** CC0 BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** \n> **Additional Notes:** Original Work by Marceline D.
