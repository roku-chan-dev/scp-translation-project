The chamber is outfitted with a Chalmez-Forte Matter Stabilizing Stasis Gate.\n \n--Following Incident I5035-A, access to SCP-5035 for any purpose is denied to all personnel.-- \nAccess to SCP-5035 is limited to members of Project CHARON. \n \nSCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B instances are to be collected and held in Dangerous Goods Storage Block 17C according to the Biosafety Level 3 standard. \n\nIn the event of a containment breach, all museums and institutions falling under Protocol 5035-CB are to be put under Foundation surveillance until SCP-5035 can successfully be contained. MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") are assigned to the recapture of SCP-5035 due to the risk of hazardous materials potentially manifested by SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5035 is a plaster and cloth statue depicting an African-American male wearing 19th century period accurate clothing. Attempts to remove SCP-5035's clothing have proven futile, as the anomaly is capable of quickly generating a new set using its own internal materials to enact SCP-5035-B. \n\nSCP-5035 spontaneously appears in museum diorama scenes relating to the American Civil War. This begins a process observed to take from one hour to seven months in completion- termed an \"Infestation Event\"- that results in the creation of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Those observing the diorama prior to the completion of an Infestation Event do not notice the presence of SCP-5035 unless explicitly told to. \n \nSCP-5035 will change the physical properties and appearances of objects making up the diorama to that of their real life counterparts. These transformed objects are referred to as SCP-5035-A. SCP-5035 also has the ability to modify existing objects in mass and position- taking on the appearance of entirely new objects. Modified objects are referred to as SCP-5035-B. For examples of these instances, refer to “Infestation Events Log” below.\n \nFollowing a transformation, SCP-5035 will cause the object to rapidly decompose. An Infestation Event is considered complete when SCP-5035 stops creating instances of SCP-5035-A and SCP-5035-B. Upon completion, SCP-5035 will remain in the diorama until its effects are observed by a certain number of persons. The criteria- if any- for how SCP-5035 decides this is unknown, but can be inferred that it is based on the size and scale of the Infestation Event.\n\nSCP-5035 transforms and manipulates a diorama as an apparent form of communication, and the object appears to identify itself with an African American freedman. The end result is that of a calculated work intended to be interpreted by the observer. Upon the completion of an Infestation Event, SCP-5035 will manifest itself at a new location to repeat the process. Despite appearing only in the United States, studies show no discernible travel pattern.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Access Document 5035-II-40022 – Infestation Events Log\" hide=\"▼ Close\"]]\n\n[[table class=\"table-main\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\" colspan=\"3\"]]\nNotable Infestation Events\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nLocation\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nDate\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\" rowspan=\"3\"]]\nManassas, Virginia\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\" rowspan=\"3\"]]\n5/30/2019\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\"]]\nA contingent of Union soldiers suffering heavy casualties at The Battle of Shiloh.

All soldiers' faces have been changed to an unrecognizable mixture of heavily damaged organs and muscle tissue. Uniforms are unaffected except for a small, cleaved hole in the chest of each soldier, where the heart would be located. The horseback commander appears face down in a pool of blood, laying atop of his fallen horse. His arm is still outstretched forward. The horse's innards are exposed, with patches of rotting skin still attached. The skin around the torso of the animal is arranged in a pattern that appears to spell the word 'SLAVES'.

The pole is made of the scene's furniture and flooring, while the flag consists entirely of skin, wrapped around the collective innards of the statues. The flag's stripes are composed of the statue's cloth uniforms, with the word 'SKIN' carved into the design. SCP-5035 stands in the center of the scene. Upon further examination, the flag's innards were found in a state of decay, and were harboring a colony of maggots- sustaining themselves on the rotting organs and tissue.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[table class=\"table-main\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nLocation\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nDate\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-hcell\"]]\nDescription of Diorama Scene\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\" rowspan=\"3\"]]\nGettysburg, Pennsylvania \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\" rowspan=\"3\"]]\n6/28/2019 \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"table-cell\"]]\nA group of Union soldiers occupy a camp.

Uniforms and clothing have been removed, and modified into head-wraps, covering the face of each soldier. The back layer of skin of each statue has been exposed, with flaps of skin still hanging. The extraneous material from the rest of the camp has been modified into a large wooden cross, stationed at the back of the diorama. The outlines of faces in various states of distress are carved into the wood of the cross. SCP-5035 stands in the center of the scene, holding the rope connected to the chained soldiers. Drops of blood run down the face of SCP-5035, resembling tears. In front of the statue is the drum, positioned on it's side.

The innards of two were used to create sculptures that roughly resembled Area-179's senior staff. The third personnel's internal organs were compressed and removed from the body through a laceration made on the wrist- causing the personnel to appear as if they were deflated. Wasps began to manifest out of SCP-5035's form, and quickly filled the testing lab. Blood and bodily fluids from the killed personnel was collected and made to spell the word 'MASTERS' on the room's back wall. Infestation Event was stopped before completion.

M[[span class=\"bblock\"]]artinez[[/span]], C. S[[span class=\"bblock\"]]mith[[/span]], R. D[[span class=\"bblock\"]]avies[[/span]], Security Team 179-B9, E. Dune\n> **Report Filed By:** E. Dune\n> **Priority:** Keneq\n> ----\n> Safe. That's what SCP-5035 is classified as, and for the past seven months- that's what it was. Our tests were proving successful, and there was a certain refinement to the scenes it created- regardless of their undeniably disturbing content. This object wasn't just rotting corpses for no reason- when it altered a scene it knew what it was saying. We came to this conclusion months ago. We also came to the conclusion that- because the object was clearly fixated on visual metaphors for unpaid reparations and the sociopolitical ramifications of slavery in the United States- keeping it locked in a cell unattended with zero non-standard containment procedures was probably a shit idea. We were right. \n> \n> Around 19:00, Junior Researcher M[[span class=\"bblock\"]]artinez[[/span]], Officer S[[span class=\"bblock\"]]mith[[/span]], and Lab Assistant D[[span class=\"bblock\"]]avies[[/span]] were performing tests on SCP-5035 in Laboratory 3F. Security feeds show that at 19:23, SCP-5035 began manifesting its anomalous effects in the form of a SCP-5035-A instance that resulted in M[[span class=\"bblock\"]]artinez[[/span]]'s scalp suddenly tearing itself open, exposing her cerebrum. S[[span class=\"bblock\"]]mith[[/span]] attempted to reach for his firearm, but SCP-5035 had elongated and twisted the officer's digits, rendering them useless. Mass began to rapidly generate in S[[span class=\"bblock\"]]mith[[/span]]'s hands, forcing him to the ground.  D[[span class=\"bblock\"]]avies[[/span]] was able to sound an alarm, but the doors to Laboratory 3F were unable to be opened. The footage shows what appear to be string-thin veins exposed from the wrists of D[[span class=\"bblock\"]]avies[[/span]] being pulled across the laboratory floor and into the door's vacuum duct, clogging and sealing the door shut.  D[[span class=\"bblock\"]]avies[[/span]] was repeatedly slammed against the door, pulled by his veins. The security team was unable to access the door to Laboratory 3F. At approximately 19:28.32, the security feed cut out, presumably due to an unseen SCP-5035-B instance interfering. \n> \n> For the next thirty minutes or so, the security team tried to cut into Laboratory 3F. Then, I showed up. The team had already gotten in, so I was able to see the monstrosity SCP-5035 had created using the remains of the testing group- which now resembled crude depictions of Area-179's staff. That fucker even had the gall to make a sculpture of me out of M[[span class=\"bblock\"]]artinez[[/span]]‘s muscle tissue, complete with a bottle of [[span class=\"bblock\"]]brand name[[/span]] in one hand, and a noose in the other- funny joke. As I anticipated, my [DATA EXPUNGED] proved useful in dealing with the anomaly, and was able to keep it occupied until we were able to retrieve a Stasis Gate from offsite. Why we didn’t have a spare in storage or for emergency purposes is beyond my understanding. Such is the state of Area-179. Regardless, it’s secure now.\n> \n> Special containment procedures update and object reclassification to Euclid pending.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[size 0%]]@[[/size]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ADDENDUM IS LEVEL #4/5035 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/5035 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"fakeprot\"]]\n[[module MailForm to=\"aaaa (DUMMY)\" button=\"\"]]\n# name\n * title: ID\n * default: a.starse@rsrch.scp.net\n * type: text\n * rules:\n  * required: true \n  * maxLength:10\n  * minLength: 100\n[[/module]]\n[[div class=\"passw\"]]\n[[module MailForm to=\"aaaa (DUMMY)\" button=\"\"]]\n# affiliation\n * title: PASSWORD\n * default: ・・・・・・・・・\n * rules:\n  * required: true \n  * maxLength:10\n  * minLength: 100\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Login\" hide=\"Logout\"]]\n> **FROM:** Dr. Edward T. Dune\n> **TO:** Director Roman Barrow, Area-179\n> **SUBJECT:** Neutralization Appeal re:SCP-5035\n>  \n> Director Barrow,\n> \n> You're damn lucky we caught that thing when we did, Roman. You can give Martin's team shit for whatever you'd like, but when someone flies a jet out to Site 89 to get a goddamned Stasis Gate and a CPR approval in under twelve hours, they're doing a fine job in my book. Yes, I know I'm making you look incompetent. Yes, I'm aware this will show up in the Level 4 file and potentially cost you your position. No, I don't care. I mean, we hypothesized that the object could potentially redirect its effects towards Foundation containment months ago. Christ, Roman- take one look at how it reacted to plastic- all because it was dressed up in a fucking Union outfit. You and the entire financial committee let our Beta-Urgent Update proposals collect dust in document-limbo for months. A budget cut cost Julie her life. Let that sink in for a second, you twat.\n> \n> However, I didn't write this just to berate you anymore than I usually do, Director. I'd like you to consider something. This object, while successfully contained now, is clearly capable of understanding subtext and loves analogous symbolism so much that I originally figured the thing belonged to those Are We Played Out Yet? fuckers. It's been redirecting its attention from the Civil War and the injustices of slavery to a different form of enslavement- the containment of anomalies. \n> \n> Consider the scene it had been constructing before we put a stop to it. \n> \n> Consider that, while the object is in motion stasis, it still may be capable of \"thinking\".\n> \n> Consider- assuming the above is true- how pissed off it is right now.\n> \n> Director, that thing is sitting in stasis thinking about all of the different ways it can kill us. Want to see an entire site turned into a piece of social commentary? How about a security team's insides turned out? Crude drawings of the O5 Council carved into your goddamned chest with a knife fashioned from your toenail? The second a containment breach occurs, or we deactivate that stasis gate, that thing is teleporting the hell out of Area-179, and manifesting itself at another Foundation establishment. I do not think that's a situation you want on your hands.\n> \n> We can't experiment with it anymore, it's just learning to hate us, it's a massive liability to keep around, and it's utterly pointless to pour resources into it. There's no tip-toeing around it- SCP-5035 must be neutralized. Need I say more?\n> \n> Sincerely Yours,\n> \n> Dr. Edward T. Dune\n\n> **FROM:** Director Roman Barrow, Area-179\n> **TO:** Dr. Edward T. Dune\n> **SUBJECT:** DENIED- Neutralization Appeal Re:SCP-5035\n> \n> Dr. Dune,\n> \n> I have worked with The Foundation for exactly 30 years. I've met minds more brilliant than I could ever hope to be, learned more about the true nature of this reality than I could ever have imagined, and experienced countless horrors untold. \n> \n> I have never been more disrespected, belittled, and humiliated than from the verbal abuse you continuously hurl at me with zero discretion. If not for reasons clear to both you and I that do not need restating here, I would've had you terminated years ago. That being said, Doctor- I reject your neutralization appeal. \n> \n>  Now, before you call the state of my hair to attention and accuse me of sexual relations with someone's mother- as you've done oh-so-many times before- allow me to elaborate. \n> \n> SCP-5035 is not averted to the Foundation as much as it is to the idea of containment. Look around you- The Foundation is far from the only group interested in anomalies. SCP-5035 appears to possess some sort of cognizance- so why not attempt to communicate with it? Imagine redirecting that resentment away from ourselves and towards a more deserving target. Provided we crack the code, the nature of SCP-5035 may prove advantageous for us in the future.\n> \n> The existence and growing influence of groups of interest is impeding The Foundation's mission heavily. We've grazed conflict far too frequently as of recent. We live in a world of ideological struggle, and we are rapidly accelerating towards the collapse. Mark my words, Doctor- there will come a tipping point, and it’s our job to be prepared. I reject your appeal, and in place issue an official Directorial Order for an immediate project planning meeting regarding a new testing program to be enacted on SCP-5035. You and your team are to await further details. I'll be seeing you soon, Doctor.\n> \n> Regards,\n> \n> Director Roman Barrow, Area-179\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n-------------\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5034]]] | SCP-5035 | [[[SCP-5036]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
