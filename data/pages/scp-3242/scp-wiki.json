Live rodents or similar-sized animals should be housed within the vicinity and are not to exceed forty in number.\n\nResearchers are to call SCP-3242 \"the subject\" if mention of it is ever necessary.[[footnote]]This became necessary after an incident where the subject became the rodent cage itself.[[/footnote]] \n\nAssigned staff are allowed to leave the area unless the subject has vanished from containment.  Should this occur, all staff working with the subject must be contacted and pass two of three required tests:\n\n* A basic health evaluation.\n* A psychological evaluation.\n* Look into a mirror.\n\n**Description:** The subject is an unknown organism restructured into a self-building program made for the assumed purpose of stealing information. This program has been made \"real\" by unknown methods, seeming to work on predefined logic rather than natural laws. The true appearance of the subject has been described as \"less than grey\" in the few verified observations available.\n\nThe logic by which the subject operates is thought to include the following: \n\n* Infection can spread through media concerning or specifically mentioning the subject, if the contents of the media are retained in memory. Class-A Amnestics are the most effective way to reverse this.   \n* When the subject replaces an object or entity, everything, including biological processes and materials often described as data or code, is replaced. The matter that replaces it proves unattainable for testing.\n\nThe subject currently resembles //Mus musculus// or House mouse, of the BALB/c[[footnote]]An inbred model of laboratory mice.[[/footnote]] strain. Iterations can be identified by random, increasingly regular superficial changes in characteristics also specific to the species or \"grouping\" of the iteration appearance. \n\n\n**Addendum:** \n\nThe anomaly was discovered in Brookfield Zoo on 6/15/2013. Risk to the public has been assumed self-negated as of 2/15/15, when the number of individuals affected by the anomaly reached fifty without the immediate loss of the subject from its containment.\n\nThe mass, weight, and physical capabilities of each iteration are determined by species and/or stereotyping. Individuals unaware of the subject are unable to be touched by the subject. [[footnote]]Complications involving the subject and staff uninformed of the subjects' location are to be noted in later performance reviews.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe subject is also unable to interact with or touch powered technology.  --Attempts to take photographic evidence of the subject have also failed.-- As of May 2015, the subject has appeared as an outline in photographs. Each subsequent iteration has shown increased opacity in pictures. \n\nOther abnormalities are noted:\n\n* A process similar to capillary action occurs when dermal areas are removed. The effectiveness of this lessens with repetition and larger areas of removed dermis.\n* Internal physical functions are reduced to muscle spasms; the lack of air flow explains the loss of the subjects' ability to speak. Conditions to observe the inner workings of the subject for longer than thirty seconds are difficult to accomplish.\n* Ability of the subject to continue living without major parts. This includes the loss of the head. Complete and simultaneous removal has not been successful due to the fragile nature of the body.\n* The effect on substitutes given after the above; objects of appropriate shape have been observed to gain the same random visual changes despite not actually functioning.\n* The subject can be destroyed with slight deliberate force. \n* Any part removed from the subject quickly dissipates.\n\nAnything that the subject consumes is returned without any loss in mass. All materials consumed become their individual ingredients[[footnote]] This was determined from samples tested with analytical chemistry. Because the organs only mimic their original functions, this is being studied.[[/footnote]]that previously constituted the former, albeit with an unusual color and viscosity.\n\nVisual anomalies within the area have been reported by staff since at least 1/1/15. Specific descriptions deviate slightly, but are otherwise consistent:\n\n[[collapsible]]\n# An unknown species of owl with unreasonably long legs and a crown. Often noticed only as a shadow running through the nearest wall. This has made attempts to capture it difficult and ongoing.\n# \"Soft\" masses that follow staff randomly. Changes in shape, size, and color are common. [[footnote]]These characteristics seem to be influenced by emotion.[[/footnote]] No clearly aggressive or determined behavior has been observed. Physical contact fails or causes the specific mass to \"burst\" and vanish.\n# A \"pig\" that possesses a long, prehensile body and no other limbs. Sometimes appears with multiple segments that move independently, and may have a preference for appearing in high places. It disappears when approached.\n# An inverted wooden chair suspended five feet off the hallway floor at a diagonal angle, just outside of video surveillance. Later found to merely be nailed to the wall and ceiling, and assumed  related to previous responses from staff and security.\n# A cervine animal with goat horns- only has appeared during Christmas every year. Sometimes manifests as a humanoid with above head and horns, or is seen as such despite conflicting perspectives. It may have an affinity for tableware.\n# Featureless humanoids that do not seem to possess arms. The few that observed it described a feeling of unplaceable anxiety and helplessness. No movement has been noted from these.\n# An immaterial duplicate of a birthday cake from the family gathering of Researcher Andersen. It changed into a highly agitated \"unicorn\" before vanishing and has not manifested since. Indentations in the floor following the incident have been found.\n# A sheaf of paper that appeared next to this file. Both were on the desk of Dr. Hester, and the manifested object disappeared when Dr. Hester attempted to open it.\n\nSome display the ability to move small objects but seem unable to pose any higher threat. As they have been observed manifesting in new ways and copying forms on occasion, exact identities cannot be confirmed or determined. \n\nVisual anomalies may not be dependent on the location of the subject, as previously believed.\n \nDirect communication has had little to no success.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n--The subject may cause-- permanent code generation may occur on any blank storage device located within at least fifteen meters around the subject. How or why this happens is currently unknown. The devices are filled with --random syntax-- abbreviated names for amino acids, repeated names of missing individuals, and known casualties in binary.\n\nExceptions to this are transcribed below and listed by the time of their realized corruption.\n\n**Contents of USB Drive-L:** 9/16/14\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{The current trial has expired.}}\n\n{{Our orison.

The file was assumed to have opened itself, as its contents were displayed in Wordpad[[footnote]] A prepackaged program.[[/footnote]].

Computers within the area were returned to their factory settings and also moved. \n\nThe subject attempted to breach containment several times. When this failed the subject began to inflict damage to itself, resulting in the loss of multiple animals and Dr. Haworth before preventative methods could be established.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Contents of Memory Card-Aa:** 5/1/15\n\n[[collapsible]]\n\n{{Are they being punished?

Despite the loss of possible communication, Garabedian was not reprimanded for destroying the affected object.
