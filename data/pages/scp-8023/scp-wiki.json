These measures are in effect for all 574 current DoMD member universes as well as a further 741 collaborator universes.\n\nThese containment measures include primarily:\n* Prevention of the spread of residual anomalies linked to a now mostly defunct **GoI-X01 'Rea-Utis per'**.\n* Support and collaboration in the containment of multiversal anomalies linked to **GoI-X01**, [[[SCP-7023]]], SCP-8023, or any other related anomalies.\n* Regulation or inhibition of travel to and from SCP-8023 on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFor a full list of outlined containment procedures, see the **2032 Cross-Foundation Agreement**, the **CHIAROSCURO Project Modus Operandi**, or the **First Multiversal Crisis Archival Documents**.\n\nA Cross-Foundation research station, dubbed Site-1Ξ has been established within SCP-8023 with the permission of the local government. Personnel stationed at Site-1Ξ are rotated in three-month intervals due to the psychological stress of local reality and time anomalies. As per Ethics Committee Ruling #7329-12, vital personnel with long-term physical health conditions should be prioritized for transfer to Site-1Ξ.\n\nField operatives navigating SCP-8023 are to be equipped with specialised flashlights crafted from local materials by the on-site engineering staff as well as instructed to stay within lit-up areas unless necessary.\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ Department of Multiversal Defense (DoMD)\n[[/=]]\n[[=image SCP__DoMDlogo_new.png width=\"150px\"]]\nThe Department of Multiversal Defense is a cross-universal Foundation agency created originally in 2018 by the **Hexauniversal Foundation Collaboration Agreement**, tasked with surveying the Multiverse for possible outside threats as well as ensuring collaboration and information exchange between different variants of the SCP Foundation. As of 2039, DoMD consists of 574 member universes as well as a further 741 collaborator universes. DoMD is not the only SCP Foundation agency of its kind in the multiverse. See, for example, the [[[scp-5618|Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981]]].\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=SCP-8000-1.jpg|align=center|width=700px|caption=Photograph taken from inside a decrepit public building within the Free Port of SCP-8023.]]\n\n[[size 120%]]**Description:**[[/size]]\nSCP-8023 is currently understood to be both:\n* An extrauniversal pocket of anomalous spacetime previously designated Universe**-XT/007ω**.\n* An incorporeal Apex-tier Pluripotent Entity inhabiting the entirety of this spacetime, also known as **'Mar-duvin'**.\n\nThe laws of physics within SCP-8023 are inherently anomalous with the average Local Reality Measurement being within 5 points of magnitude lower than is considered to be baseline for universes typically inhabited by non-anomalous human beings. This mainly manifests when observing light sources within SCP-8023 as the entire universe is permanentely coated in thick everpresent darkness, believed to be an effect of the Apex-tier entity residing in it. So far, only light sources found within SCP-8023 have been able to penetrate this anomalous darkness, being able to light up their surroundings up to 5 meters while still being small enough to carry around.\n\nOther notable effects of anomalous spacetime include an extremely slow form of decay experienced by matter inside of SCP-8023, causing injuries or damage that would otherwise be fatal to be survivable. Death caused by natural causes is almost impossible inside SCP-8023. A similar effect has been documented in [[[scp-3001|places with extremely low Hume levels before]]]. In addition to this, whenever a sentient being inside of SCP-8023 is left in absolute darkness, they will eventually teleport to a different part of SCP-8023 that is also in absolute darkness, usually close to a nearby light source or structure, often ending up where they came from. It is currently unknown if these effects are inherent to the anomalous spacetime, or if these are conscious efforts of the Apex-tier entity to keep the inhabitants out of harm.\n\nIn addition to this, the local flow of time is significantly unstable, often leading to time anomalies and differences in how locals perceive time. This fact has made it possible for the local community to have had a functioning infrastructure with hundreds of buildings when it was first discovered merely 10 years after its founding.\n\nThis extrauniversal spacetime is potentially infinite and empty except for a non-Euclidean expanse of land in its center, which is made out of a dark grey rock-like substance. A local community of people has been established within SCP-8023, designated **Free Port #23**, known to the local populace as **'Ai'gazar-En'** or **'City of the Accursed'**. This stretch of land has thus far not been properly surveyed due to anomalous local topography as well as size but estimates given by residents claim that the city is about 780-950 km^^2^^ but has expanded significantly in recent years. The local atmosphere is breathable, albeit with some difficulty, as it contains slightly less oxygen than humans from most baseline universes are accustomed to.\n\nAlmost all inhabitants of SCP-8023 are human and function as semi-permanent residents, as there is no food supply, poor living conditions for permanent habitation, and disorienting local geography. As such, SCP-8023 (and FP-23) is mostly inhabited by multiversal refugees as well as 'The Accursed', referring to people with any form of a fatal, non-curable condition such as illness, injury, or curses.[[footnote]]Mostly thaumaturgical, infernal, or deific in nature but other cases have been documented as well.[[/footnote]] Notably, around 19% of questioned inhabitants have been affected by [[[scp-7023|SCP-7023 and the recent Multiversal Crisis]]]. 'The Accursed' are multiversal travelers who come to SCP-8023 on an irregular basis to temporarily escape their condition and stay within the anomaly for as long as they are able to.\n\nThe local inhabitants view **'Mar-duvin'** (the Apex-tier Entity designated SCP-8023) as a benevolent godly being that merely allows them to reside within itself, calling it many names such as **'Safe Shadow'** and **'Bliss od Darkness'**. No institutionalized worship of this entity exists, however many people within SCP-8023 rever Mar-duvin and the oldest inhabitants of the city sometimes claim that \"it is currently dormant\", implying this hasn't always been the case.\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ Rea-Utis per (GoI-X01)\n[[/=]]\n\nThe hostile memetic civilisation, known as **Rea Utis-per**, was a multiversal threat, whose goal was the conversion and infection of other universes to their beliefs. The origin of this powerful memetic virus is still unknown. In order to conquer other universes, they constructed an Eigen-weapon capable of targeting the multiversal variation signature, meaning it could target a specific person across all possible universes and then collapse those variations into a single one.\n\nRea Utis-per used this weapon on their own multiversal variant in a religious ritual which was supposed to determine the most //true// variant of their religious meme, after which the remaining variant took over countless worlds previously inhabited by the other variants. This made GoI-X01 into a singular powerful adversary for the Department of Multiversal Defense, which began uniting the Foundations of other universes against this threat.\n\nAll further information surrounding Rea Utis-per is **RESTRICTED** for personnel not assigned to the **CHIAROSCURO Project**.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[size 120%]]**Addendum 8023.1:** Discovery[[/size]]\n\nThe Department of Multiversal Defense first discovered SCP-8023 in 2032 during the ongoing Multiversal Crisis following the invasion of a hostile memetic light-based civilisation known as **GoI-X01 'Rea Utis-per'** ten years prior. The conflict, which affected several hundreds of universes, was sparked over a new multiversal Eigen-weapon (SCP-7023) used by the enemy to destroy all multiversal variants of objects and people, collapsing them into a single variant that was highly unstable and eventually fatal. This effect was devastating to Foundation leadership in many allied universes, as many of them had a close similarity percentage, meaning specific people, locations or objects could be erased across all of these universes in a single use of the Eigen-weapon.\n\nAfter a decade of prolonged war between 'Rea Utis-per' and The Department of Multiversal Defense, it appeared that the enemy ceased their attacks on multiple key target universes as they suddenly had to relocate their resources somewhere else. Reports from field agents started to mention 'shadow entities' appearing during battles attacking the enemy combatants. Attempts to follow the multiversal signature of these entities revealed their origin to be an extrauniversal pocket of anomalous spacetime, which was designated Universe**-XT/007ω** and later reclassified as SCP-8023.\n\nIn search of an alliance against the threat of **'Rea Utis-per'**, the Foundation Department of Multiversal Defense created a diplomatic committee that was sent to SCP-8023 after the initial location has been deemed safe by MTF Gala-4 \"Dark Lords\". Despite not being able to communicate with the Apex-tier Entity within, these representatives met with the inhabitants of SCP-8023 and initiated diplomatic relations. At first, there were very few inhabitants present in the city and they had little knowledge of the origin and purpose of SCP-8023. With their permission, a Temporary Research Station was created within, later expanded into a more permanent Site-1Ξ.\n\nDespite the initial connection between the shadow entities attacking 'GoI-X01' and SCP-8023, no such entity was ever observed inside of SCP-8023. These entities have not been observed in any of the allied Foundation universes since the end of the Crisis in 2034 and the collapse of GoI-X01.\n\n------\n\n[[size 120%]]**Addendum 8023.2:** About Free Port-23[[/size]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:right; width: 20em; padding: 0 1em; margin: 1em 0 1em 1em; border-left: solid #888888 1px; background-color: #071b19;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++* Ai'gazar-En\n++++ City of the Accursed\n\n[[=image Ai'gazar-En_flag.png size=\"small\"]]\n\n**City-State/Independent Entity**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top; padding-right: 1em\"]]\n**Settled**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align:top\"]]\n2022 SMY[[footnote]]Standard Multiversal Year.

This initial community, led by a man named **Sajid Inturmann**, faced many hardships due to the inherent anomalies within SCP-8023 but they were also able to harness these anomalies and use them to their benefit.\n\nToday Ai'gazar-En is permanently inhabited by hundreds to thousands of people at any given time,[[footnote]]Majority of residents visit the city only for months at a time with only a few people becoming permanent residents.[[/footnote]] however the exact overall number of citizens has never been counted. City Council, exchanged every three months, together with a person known as **The Interpreter**, form a sort of government structure for the local community, even though many residents of Ai'gazar-En prefer their privacy and deliberately try to isolate themselves from others. \n\nBuildings are mostly spread out in small groups close to each other and lit up using specialised lanterns made from local materials, which produce a turquoise or green light capable of illuminating the anomalous darkness. There are however many buildings separated from others by chunks of darkness, which makes it almost impossible to access them due to the inherent teleportation properties of local topology. As such, it is virtually impossible for anyone who doesn't know the precise distances and directions, to find these isolated buildings.\n\nIn addition to this, prolonged exposure to SCP-8023 and its anomalous effects seems to be detrimental to the human psyche. Whether this is an effect of the everpresent darkness, poor living conditions, or the low level of local reality and temporal anomalies is unknown. These effects on the human mind have however been recorded in a [[[scp-5005|location with similar properties]]]. \n\n------\n\n[[size 120%]]**Addendum 8023.3:** PITCH DARK Incident[[/size]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=dr-simon-gutarix.jpg|width=200px|caption=Dr. Simon Gutarix.]]\n\nOn the 27th of August 2039, Site-1Ξ sent out a distress signal to DoMD leadership, claiming the light sources both inside and outside of the building had gone out simultaneously. Soon after, all contact with Site-1Ξ was lost. In response, MTF Gala-4 \"Dark Lords\" was sent into SCP-8023 to investigate finding that the local topology had changed drastically and Site-1Ξ was nowhere to be found.\n\nLocal inhabitants appeared just as confused as the Team and claimed there was a temporary 'blackout' during which the positions of all structures, objects, and people changed. This was the first recorded instance of such an event in the city's history, prompting both the locals and the MTF to search for answers. Especially as many structures around the central hub of the city seemed to be completely alien to the locals.\n\nDr. Simon Gutarix, a former decorated field agent with 40 years of experience in the field and also a member of on-site medical personnel, was soon found wandering around the newly-formed city square, claiming to have ventured outside of Site-1Ξ for a breath of fresh air, before everything went dark. He was directed to temporarily join the four-man team to aid in their investigation.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#040f0d; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript, Part I**\n**Date:** 27/08/2039\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Gala-4 \"Dark Lords\"\n**Location of Interest:** SCP-8023\n**Team Lead:** G-4 Star\n**Team Members:** G-4 Tray, G-4 Fall, G-4 Reve, Dr. Gutarix\n------\n\n**G-4 Star:** ... Alright, I guess we're taking the Doctor with us if the Command ordered it.\n\n**G-4 Tray:** You don't seem too happy about it, Captain.\n\n**G-4 Star:** No comment, Tray. So, what do you suggest we do first, Doctor?\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** (//Hesitantly.//) I believe we should ask some of the locals for help. It's their terrain and we know very little about it.\n\n**G-4 Fall:** We already asked them and they're just as confused, if not more, old man. No offense.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** None taken. I wasn't talking about their maps being useless in here. We need a guide, someone who spent a long time- (//Pauses to take a breath.//) -here. Simply someone who knows more than us.\n\n**G-4 Reve:** I heard there's this guy they call the Interpreter. He does like this, this- //Communication// with the entity here. Allegedly.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:**  Good thinking. That was also my first guess but nobody has seen him since the blackout.\n\n**G-4 Tray:** Alright, so someone else then. There's supposed to be a City Council or something, no? We go to them.\n\n**G-4 Star:** Tray, we've already asked the guy in charge of the diplomatic paperwork and he knew less than nothing. Not to worry though, I'm sure the old man here has something more specific in mind.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** ... I do. Elsa Zhevnicz.\n\n**G-4 Star:** Are you- are you sure about this?\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** Well no, but she's our best bet. Or do you know anyone else here who makes their living by searching for things in the dark?\n\n**G-4 Tray:** The old man has a point, Captain.\n\n**G-4 Star:** That he does, Tray...\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** I've asked a couple of people who claimed they saw her a few minutes ago.

(//He gestures the rest to move out.//)\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** Ed- I mean, Captain, if you could spare a moment-\n\n**G-4 Star:** Not now, old man. We've got work to do.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=elsa-zhevnicz.jpg|width=200px|caption=Elsa Zhevnicz.]]\n\nTeam Gala-4 successfully managed to locate Ms. Zhevnicz in a decrepit apartment building which has now relocated to the opposite side of the city from its original location. During their trip there, agents discovered an anomalous object confirmed to be a pine tree, roughly 30 meters in height, although only the bottom-most part of it was visible through the darkness, growing seemingly out of hard rock ground. Dr. Gutarix speculated that it is possible this pine tree has always existed within SCP-8023 and was simply never found. He further supposed it could be possible that more plant life exists somewhere in SCP-8023, explaining the existence of oxygen in the air, which was previously taken as anomalous. He was swiftly reminded by other members of the team, that without any natural light or soil in SCP-8023, such plant life would still have to be inherently anomalous. \n\nUpon arrival, the team and Dr. Gutarix were cautiously greeted by the residents and given directions towards Ms. Zhevnicz's apartment, where she somewhat begrudgingly agreed to temporarily join the team in their investigation. As a professional cartographer, geologist, speleologist, mountaineer, and a former Foundation operative originating from Universe-**WL/343c**, she has been accepted by Mission Command without complaints. City records regarding Ms. Zhevnicz are incomplete, showing only that she first arrived to SCP-8023 in 2024 and only officially[[footnote]]Unregistered travel to and from Ai'gazar-En is a poorly documented phenomenon as many methods of multiversal travel exist, many of which are difficult or impossible to keep a track of. This trend has only slightly improved since the Foundation's arrival to SCP-8023.[[/footnote]] left the city only a handful of times. Ms. Zhevnicz suggested that the team should first visit the Interpreter's home as it is the most likely place to find them and she knew about its new location.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#040f0d; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript, Part II**\n**Date:** 27/08/2039\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Gala-4 \"Dark Lords\"\n**Location of Interest:** SCP-8023\n**Team Lead:** G-4 Star\n**Team Members:** G-4 Tray, G-4 Fall, G-4 Reve, Dr. Gutarix, Elsa Zhevnicz\n------\n\n**G-4 Reve:** Ms. Zhevnicz?

Doctor here convinced me, that you'll be helpful so, answer the question, please. Who is the Interpreter?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** They run the place, well, kinda. The Safe Shadow is the one in charge but the Interpreter, well, interprets it. Picture an old-timey shaman priest kind of person, telling us what the darkness around thinks and wants. Usually, it wants nothing. People say a lot about them. Stories and legends, that the Interpreter is actually Mar-duvin themselves in a human body, or that they were the first person who ever found this place, hundreds of years before Sajid Inturmann and his refugees did. Others will tell you the Interpreter actually is Sajid.\n\n**G-4 Reve:** And nobody knows the truth?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** Oh no, some people do. But it's really not that important you see, because all the stories focus on the Interpreter's past and refuse to acknowledge who they are now.\n\n**G-4 Star:** Alright, I hate to cut your conversation here but we are heading into darkness. Ms. Zhevnicz?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** It should be right in front of us, around 30 meters. Or, do you use meters, where you come from? (//Chuckles.//)\n\n**G-4 Star:** Very funny. Alright, take out your flashlights everyone.\n\n**Zhevnicz:** No, let's conserve our fuel. Everyone just hold each other's hand while you Captain hold this. (//She offers him an already lit brass lantern with a green flame flickering inside.//)\n\n**G-4 Star:** Fine. Do as she says. (//He grabs her hand as she offers to take Dr. Gutarix's hand, who in turn grabs one of the agents until all members are holding each other.//)\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** This is genious. We haven't really had the time to properly experiment with the local environment yet but tell me, Ms. Zhevnicz, if none of us had a light source right now, would we all teleport individually, or together?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** One for all, all for one. Be careful where you step, folks.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** (//Enthusiastically.//) Thank you, Ms. Zhevnicz.\n\n(//The team enters a dark spot and after approximately 30 meters exits into another dimly lit-up area surrounding a tall cylindrical wooden house.

Mine is a curse.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** Eigen-weapon caused?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** Actually, no. I know there's plenty of people here who suffered from that. Mine is less grand but all the more deadly.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** It's- it's hard for me to grasp still... My son doesn't know yet, our relationship was never really that great to begin with.\n\n**Zhevnicz:** So you've decided to come here like the rest of us? Growing old and seeking immortality?\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** Not- not immortality, no. I just... I wanted a bit more time to grow comfortable with the idea.\n\n**Zhevnicz:** ... I didn't mean to pry.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** Didn't you? (//Chuckles.//) It's alright.\n\n(//They both stand in silence for a while.//)\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** So what do you think happens when we find the Interpreter? Do you believe they will be able to tell us what happened?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** Honestly? I have no idea. But I like to think the blackout was something natural. The darkness around isn't really that scary when you've lived here for as long as I have.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** How long is that?\n\n**Zhevnicz:** (//Smiles.//) I know I don't look it.\n\n**Dr. Gutarix:** That's not an answer.\n\n**Zhevnicz:** (//Chuckles.//) Look who is prying now.\n\n(//G-4 Star comes back through the front door of the building.//)\n\n**G-4 Star:** Nothing!

Upon closer inspection, all furniture inside the house, as well as the facade was made out of pine wood. After searching through the Interpreter's house, the team was left with a choice. Go back to the central city hub and search for any clues there, or continue searching in a perimeter around the house. Confident in her ability to orient herself in the darkness, Ms. Zhevnicz supported the latter option to which Agent Star agreed.\n\nBeforehand, during a short break Agent Star in private contacted Foundation DoMD Command[[footnote]]Radio transmissions within SCP-8023 are very difficult, which makes constant connections between field teams and control non viable. Instead, operatives are instructed to attempt a radio connection every 1-3 hours.[[/footnote]] to seek further instructions and to ask about his father's presence in the mission. Due to an administrative error, he was informed that Dr. Gutarix requested his transfer to SCP-8023 two months prior to the incident. This error was noticed before any more private information about the medical state of Dr. Gutarix could be revealed to Agent Star. Still, the agent seemed frustrated with this information and requested access to further details. Due to the tense relationship between both men, Command refused to give out private information, insisting instead that both men have a discussion before continuing. Enraged, Agent Star refused this suggestion and continued with the mission as previously planned.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#040f0d; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript, Part III**\n**Date:** 27/08/2039\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Gala-4 \"Dark Lords\"\n**Location of Interest:** SCP-8023\n**Team Lead:** G-4 Star\n**Team Members:** G-4 Tray, G-4 Fall, G-4 Reve, Dr. Gutarix, Elsa Zhevnicz\n------\n\n(//For about half an hour, MTF Gala-4 kept searching in a perimeter of 100 meters around the house.
