  "content": "**Name:** Doctor Martin \"Tall Fellow\" Donohue\n\n**Security Clearance:** Level 3\n\n**Occupation:** History consult, Site ██\n\n**Personal History:** Born and raised in Clovis, NM, Dr. Donohue graduated //cum laude// from Eastern New Mexico University with a degree in Anthropology and Applied Archaeology. He later earned his doctorate in Archaeology and Art History at Columbia University in New York. Dr. Donohue came into Foundation employment following his assistance with the discovery of the anomalous properties of SCP-960.\n\nDr. Donohue can be recognized at a glance for his ever-present Stetson hat, his habit of whistling loudly, and his ludicrous height. He has logged a significant number of hours in on-site medical wards for head injuries incurred by door frames and ceiling fans but asserts that this has had no detrimental effect on his ability to work, citing \"general laziness\" as the true root cause.\n\nDr. Donohue is a two-time Selection Committee pick for the Site ██ Safety Consciousness Prize (no monetary reward attached), the 2008 and 2010 champion of Site ██ Sudden Carnage Paintball (no monetary reward attached), and a surprisingly competent pianist. His interests include vintage acoustic guitars, lasers, soccer, cursing, practical jokes, urban exploration, non-urban exploration, and woodworking.\n\nDr. Donohue has assisted with the recovery and/or classification of the following anomalous objects:\n* [[[SCP-025]]]: \"A Well-Worn Wardrobe\"\n* [[[SCP-515]]]: \"Sleeper\"\n* [[[SCP-960]]]: \"Inspiration\"\n* [[[SCP-1919]]]: \"Hotel of Duplicates\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
