So, procedures focus instead on preventing SCP-6916 subjects from accessing SCP-6916-A. To achieve this, Zohar counters[[footnote]] An instrument used to detect and measure the rate of Akiva radiation flow, known as thaumactivity. As well as detection, Zohar counters can be used to identify specific thaumaturgical programs.[[/footnote]] have been set up at various points around the Irish, British and Northern French coast, to detect attempted access into SCP-6916-A.\n\nShould SCP-6916 subjects attempt to access SCP-6916-A, Foundation agents are to recover them as soon as possible and subject them to oneirological and, if necessary, amnestic treatment. Should subjects successfully gain access to SCP-6916-A, they are considered unrecoverable and all witnesses and relations will receive amnestic treatment.\n\n**Due to further discoveries regarding SCP-6916 and related anomalies, these containment procedures are awaiting updates and transfer to the management of Project Caliburn.**\n\n------\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-6916 is a reoccurring, anomalous dream experience by individuals with Celtic ancestry or who have been raised within the Celtic culture. It is unknown how long subjects have to be exposed to Celtic culture for them to experience SCP-6916. A common psychological trait shared between subjects is the strong sense of hiraeth,[[footnote]] An emotion similar to homesickness, nostalgia and grief. The word has no direct English translation. [[/footnote]] admiration and pride they feel towards the Celtic nations, culture or history. The subject doesn't have to have lived or visited a Celtic nation to experience SCP-6916.\n\nSCP-6916 has no recognisable pattern, as the number of SCP-6916 instances a subject can experience can range between once per lifetime or three per month. Despite this, SCP-6916 exhibits mild mnestic properties, with some of the images and events subjects experienced during SCP-6916 remaining with them throughout their lives. These memories have been resistant to all known forms of amnestic treatments. The following are the most common images and events experienced by subjects during SCP-6916:\n\n* Subject finds themselves walking along a beach during a thunderstorm. The beach's composition and size vary but the presents of the storm is consistent. In the background, the faint sound of bells can be heard.\n* Subject chase an unseen entity through a forest, with some of the trees appearing to be silver in colouration. After some time, the subject pauses to catch their breath. Whilst resting, the trees and plant life begin moving, surrounding the subject. In the tree tops, shadows of winged, humanoid figures can be seen circling the subject, laughing.\n* Subject attends a feast alongside several individuals, some of which appear to be spectral and \"ghost-like.\" All attendees, including the subject, are wearing an item of silver. At some point, the subject and the attendees become aware of an open door in the hall and begin to experience a growing sense of sorrow and bitterness. Through the door, an island can be seen.\n* Subject begins weeping in the middle of a battlefield during a thunderstorm. Surrounding them are several dead individuals, human and humanoid. As the subject compose themselves, they are approached by a bearded man wearing black fabric, furs and a crown composed of antlers and silver. The man embraces the subject before facing them, with water rising around the two of them. The man then whispers \"//Come home//\" as the sound of bells and wolves howling is heard. (**Note: this event is experienced only by those who have been subjected to multiple instances of SCP-6916.**)\n\nSubjects who've repeatedly experienced SCP-6916 develop knowledge of random Insular Celtic[[footnote]]Breton, Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Cornish and Manx.[[/footnote]] words and phrases and most develop a strong desire to travel to Northwestern Europe, specifically the Celtic nations. Statistics suggest this desire only occurs within ~3% of subjects. This desire isn't hazardous and if not acted upon, these desires will subside with time as will the subject's subjection to SCP-6916.\n------\n**Addendum 6916.1: History**\n\nSCP-6916 was first recorded and classified in early 1998 when a sudden increase in SCP-6916 claims was recorded from various therapy sessions and social interactions, including within the Foundation itself. Following this increase in claims, the Foundation also recorded a sudden increase in immigration and tourism in Ireland, Great Britain and France. These activities also increased again in mid-1999.\n\nWhen investigated further, analysis was able to discover the increase in SCP-6916 activity correlated to political and cultural shifts that had occurred in Celtic nations[[footnote]] The first influx occurred hours after the signing of the //Good Friday Agreement// on 10/04/1998 and the second after the founding of the //Senedd// on 12/05/1999. [[/footnote]]. To gain further information, the Foundation conducted several interviews with those subjected to SCP-6916 and continued to monitor them long after.\n\nOne subject, D-2302, was incredibly detailed regarding SCP-6916's imagery. When asked how he knew so much about SCP-6916, D-2302 revealed that they had experienced SCP-6916 throughout their life. Dr. Zachary Dafydd managed to confirm this by utilising oneiric hypnotherapy techniques. When questioned about their long-term history with SCP-6916, D-2302 grew increasingly hysterical and made several demands to return to Ireland, in order to \"find it\".\n\nWhen several other subjects admitted to experiencing SCP-6916 before its surge, an investigation began to try and discover older accounts of SCP-6916. Focusing on areas where Celtic culture and ancestry were prevalent, the Foundation found just under 200 documented recordings of SCP-6916 in the past 130 years. One of the oldest recordings of SCP-6916 was found in the diaries of Brigadier Emyr Ab Ifan[[footnote]] A military brigadier and thaumaturgist for GoI-ω-008's (\"Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal\") Force ξ, a task force specialising in targeting thaumaturgical and psionic anomalies. Believed to have died during the early stages of the Sixth Occult War (1864 - 1869).[[/footnote]], written in 1865.

However, very little documentation could be found, although this was expected as the absorption of GoI-ω-008 into the Foundation and the Sixth Occult War had resulted in a great loss of information.\n\nAccording to a report written by then director of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 |Site-Green]]], General Oliver Roberts, Brigadier Ab Ifan was believed to have been a casualty of the war. The location of his party and himself are unknown. Additionally, the Foundation discovered during the Sixth Occult War, the immigration and repatriation rate in the United Kingdom, France and Ireland increased slightly. It is yet to be confirmed that this increase was a direct result of SCP-6916.\n------\n**Addendum 6916.2: PoI Behaviour**\n\nOn 03/03/2000, Nadiya Hassan was reported missing to the Glaswegian Police by the Home Office after numerous failed attempts by Immigration Enforcement Officers to locate her and have her and her family deported. The Foundation was alerted and Field Agents took over the investigation, taking Nadiya's family into their care and designating Nadiya as PoI-6988. According to PoI-6988's father, during their time avoiding the police, PoI-6988 had experienced trouble sleeping and had been complaining about a \"reoccurring dream\".\n\nOn 12/03/2000, several witnesses in Lamlash, Scotland claimed they saw a young woman matching PoI-9688's description \"walk into the Sea\". Diving teams failed to discover any trace of PoI-6988, however, thaumaturgical analysis did detect slight shifts in thaumactivity around the area. When investigating PoI-6988 movements before her appearance at Lamlash, a witness came forward claiming she'd given a woman of similar description a lift to Dunchraigaig Cairn in Kilmartin, Lochgilphead.\n\nDuring and following their investigation of PoI-6988's movements, 19 other individuals subjected to SCP-6916 also were reported missing, with many of them disappearing after visiting a historical site. One subject, PoI-7012 (\"Jago Marsh\"), was caught on a security camera at Land's End. During the footage, PoI-7012's fiancée and mother attempted to rescue PoI-7012 from the sea edge, only for PoI-7012 to refuse their offer and apologies. PoI-7012 then walked across the surface of the sea as the waves around him grew in size and power, eventually engulfing him.\n\nOn 28/03/2000, reports came of an individual, later identified as Ethan Rogers and designated PoI-7028, attempting to access [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4911 |SCP-4911]]][[footnote]] SCP-4911: //A Safe-class anomalous wall located in South Wales. 4911 has strong mnestic and thaumaturgic properties.//[[/footnote]]. When interviewed, PoI-7028 that they were following a dream they had been experiencing over the past months and they had been drawn to SCP-4911. To better understand the connection between SCP-6916's subject's interest in historical locations and their later disappearances, Dr. Dafydd proposed allowing PoI-7028 access to SCP-4911 under Foundation analysis. This request was approved by Site Command.\n\nWhen subjected to SCP-4911 mnestic properties, the thaumactivity within PoI-7028 increased and the plinth atop SCP-4911 was momentarily lit with a white flame. Following this, PoI-7028 requested to be taken to the coast, to which the Foundation took him to Dams Bay, The Vale of Glamorgan. Upon arriving, the thaumactivity in the surrounding area increased and PoI-7028 claimed they could see a causeway made of stone leading to an island in the distance, matching that he'd seen in his dream. Upon seeing the island, PoI-7028 attempted to escape Foundation custody only to be caught, tranquilised and subjected to amnestic and oneirological treatment.\n------\n**Addendum 6916.3: Exploration of SCP-6916-A**\n\nThrough joint analysis by the Department of Thaumaturgy, Department of Oneirology Studies, and Department of Extradimensional Studies, the Foundation theorised that the experience of both SCP-6916 and interaction with historical Celtic sites acted as a Newman-Hyatt Key[[footnote]]More commonly known among the anomalous community as 'Knocks'. The majority of NHKs are used to open Rosen-Fortune Bridges (\"Ways\") into Nx-01 (\"The Wanderer's Library\"). However, some allow access to other extradimensional and anomalous locations.[[/footnote]]. When enacted at the coast of the British Isles, the Key allows access to an extradimensional space, of unknown size, designated as SCP-6916-A. According to the enactors, within SCP-6916-A is an island, accessible by a stone causeway.\n\nDespite the Foundation's best efforts, the number of SCP-6916 subjects continued to climb, with a further 5 subjects entering SCP-6916-A. With the numbers increasing, on 06/04/2000, Director Durrani ordered a joint task force exploration into SCP-6916-A.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Exploration Log\" hide=\"▽ Exploration Log\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Exploration Log of SCP-6916-A**\n\n[[/=]]\n**Personnel Mobilized**:\nCaptain Robert Wilson, Level 3 Commander of MTF-Beta-777,\nSergeant Tomos Urban, Level 3 Thaumaturgist of MTF-Beta-777,\nAccompanied by Dr. Zachary Dafydd, Level 3 Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology and Siwan Caradog, Level 3 Containment Specialist[[footnote]]Despite not having the relevant training, Dr. Dafydd and Agent Caradog were assigned to the exploration due to the scarcity of SCP-6916's subjects with the appropriate credentials and skills. Dr. Dafydd is a qualified Level-4 oneiromancer and psionic and Agent Caradog specialised in the containment of thaumaturgical and spectral anomalies.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Foreword**:\nTo complete the NHK criteria, Dr. Dafydd had all of the members of the expedition visit the Grimspound ruins, the nearest historical Celtic site to Site-12. Following this, the team were dispatched to Cellar Beach, Plymouth to access SCP-6916-A.\n\n**Preamble**:\nMembers of MTF-Beta-777, along with Dr. Dafydd and Agent Caradog, will access SCP-6916-A and gather intelligence about its nature and relation with SCP-6916.\n------\n\n**- Begin Log -**\n\n//(Members approach the intertidal zone.

All were drenched in seawater and experiencing moderate hypothermia. Wilson, Urban and Caradog were found unconscious and recovered a few hours later after receiving medical attention. Dafydd, however, was discovered undergoing prolonged REM sleep and could not be awakened until 3 days following his recovery.\n\nTesting revealed that the DNA sequence found on the ring belonged to Brigadier Emyr Ab Ifan, with photographic evidence confirming this. Supplies recovered from the ship by Urban confirmed that the vassal was the Arausio, a clipper used by GoI-ω-008. No bodies were discovered on the ship.\n\nThe crowned man witnessed by the team was confirmed to be the same man they'd witnessed during SCP-6916. Wilson also revealed that the man and the island were thaumaturgically linked somehow, implying the atmospheric and temporal alterations experienced by the team were their doing. As a result, they were classified as SCP-6916-B and the spectral entities inhabiting SCP-6916-A were classified as SCP-6916-C.\n\nAnalysis of the metallic branch by the Department of Chemistry and the Botany Division confirmed that the branch's DNA sequence was similar to that of //Alnus glutinosa//. They also discovered that the branch's xylem tissue was heavy with iron and silver particles. Despite being malleable upon removal, the branch's flexibility and durability shifted dramatically during its study, with its properties now replicating that of steel. Analysis of the branch is still ongoing.\n\n------\n**Addendum 6916.4: Interview with SCP-6916-B**\n\n3 days following his expedition into SCP-6916-A, Dr. Dafydd awoke from his REM sleep state and immediately requested the use of an oneirosensory visualization recording device[[footnote]] A recently signed-off device developed by the Department of Oneirology Studies, which records digital rendering of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5923 |dreams]]].[[/footnote]], claiming he had communicated with SCP-6916-B prior to his expulsion from SCP-6916-A and vital information regarding the history and events occurring with SCP-6916-A.

I and others ruled, true, but we did not stand above our fellow brothers and sons! But, yes, we were proud of what we were. Maybe that's why we fell so painfully. //(Pauses)// Our community was powerful. We could do things with magic others could only dream of.

Were you enemies?\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** Maybe, deep down, but on the surface, we were rivals. Both of us were always jealous of each other. Us, envious of their influence over fortune, the skies and their bodies. Them, covetous of our finesse in metalwork, agriculture and mediumship. It was unhealth but - it worked.\n\n**Dafydd:** What changed?\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** I believe you owe me an answer.\n\n**Dafydd:** Go on then.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** Are you proud of where you come from?\n\n//(Pause)//\n\n**Dafydd:** In this line of work, attachments are - dangerous things to form.

All I know is that as soon as it started, it grew quickly and led to tensions between us. Fear grew like a weed. Everything became about displaying power. Eventually, the idea of war crept into our minds. As new enemies from the east and north had started to appear, war was not something either of us wanted.\n\nOur only hope was a union of sorts. So plans were made for their prince to wed one of our most powerful ladies and at the ceremony, both of us exchanged a treasure. They taught us to influence our skies and we gave them means of uniting living and dead. We believe such a union would strengthen us. But it brought nothing but misery. The whispers continued and then came the attacks and murders. And finally, when word came that our lady had faced abuse and torture at the hands of the prince's family, our fates were decided.\n\n**Dafydd:** War.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** It was a blood bath that lasted years. Both of us held nothing back. Curses were cast. Fortresses erected. Monsters were bred. Many men and beasts, both living and departed, were lost, or worse. And then, it all came here. To my island. So many were lost in that battle. And then -\n\n//(SCP-6916-B begins to weep angrily.

The truth! The shameful truth! As we quarrelled and built, they snuck and whispered! Posing as our brothers and feeding our bloodlust! It had all been a game! All this time! A great game! To weaken us! To degrade us! To claim our lands after we'd reduce them to dust! Those vile creatures!\n\n//(SCP-6916-B slams his fist on to the stone, which cracks.)//\n\nWe tried to act but by then it was too late. They had most of our land, fortresses and arms under their control. There was nothing we could do. I watched as they made my forest walk and hunt my people. We begged them to stop but they only laughed. They enjoyed it you see. After the forests walked, they pulled my land out of the world and sealed it within this realm. Some of my men escaped, as did some Tuatha, but most of us, including myself and the prince, were captured and brought to the Gwyllion king.\n\nWe begged the king to spare our people. He merely laughed. He had what he wanted. With that, he had the prince imprisoned and transported and had me chained and muzzled, locked to my island. Forced into enslavement. Forced to bend my kingdom into his sick image. Forced to watch my magic be used to turn people into beasts and abominations.\n\n//(SCP-6916-B puts their head in their arms.)//\n\n**Dafydd:** I'm - I'm so sorry.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** With our community in ruin, I watched as they used my island to experiment, plan and manipulate. As they did so, I felt my people grew weaker and simpler and not long after, Albion was invaded again and again. And with each invasion, our history, our culture, and our work vanished. So much was lost.\n\n//(One of SCP-6916-C rests it's head on SCP-6916-B lap.)//\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** You've met the Gwyllion. I saw it in your eyes when you handled their bones. A disgust. A scar beyond just the skin. Tell me, how did you meet them?\n\n**Dafydd:** Before I joined the Foundation, I lived in the Library along with a group of people I wrongfully considered family. One day, some of us attempted [[[a-dreaming-giant-s-chair|something]]]. A ritual. I - it went wrong. It turned out, just like you, I'd been tricked by someone. Someone from ##green|**somewhere very fair away**##. They interrupted the casting, damaging my mind. In the process, many people, including he who ##green|**came from over there**## were lost and I was left hurt - and changed.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** Cruel, aren't they?\n\n**Dafydd:** How did you escape?\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** Oh, that. My, that was satisfying. As you know, the Gwyllion had cut this land apart from the world, sealing it within this realm and closing it off with powerful boundaries. For centuries, I had attempted to breach them but I was weak. Then many years ago, something occurred. Something outside this realm. I don't know what but whatever it was, made the Gwyllion scared. That, I had never seen before. And this force caused a fissure to form in the boundaries. Just big enough for a message to get through. So, I reached out and called.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** And an answer came.\n\n**Dafydd:** The soldiers. Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** These men had power. New power. Refined power. And each of them possessed the same spirit my brothers and sons had long ago. A pride and love my people once had I long thought dead. The Gwyllion tried to fight back but their power had waned. Eventually, after many deaths, they freed me. And free at last, I gave them terror. I pulled on the boundaries between life and death and made them face the sins they'd indulged in. The king, who'd dared to mock me, fled like a coward along with his court. His subjects, the usurpers, I slaughtered. I hate to say it, but their screams were glorious noise. My island was mine once more. Broken, but mine.\n\n**Dafydd:** Well that explains a bit.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** Now, I ask you. Will you join us?\n\n**Dafydd:** I'm sorry.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** The Gwyllion. This place is only one of many of their hiding places. Your curse is further proof that they're out there. They have held us back for millennia. They must be removed.\n\n**Dafydd:** Hang on just a moment. You're planning to - That's what the dream is. It's not a distress call. It's a call to arms. You want to fight them.\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** And you and your organisation have come. You've seen what they have done to us. Confined us to cages. Prevented us from reaching our true potential. Not just in Alboin. I know kingdoms and communities exist beyond the seas. They too must have faced the refinement of those creatures. It is time we took back what they had no right to take from us. Our true potential. Join us.\n\n//(SCP-6916-B offers Dafydd a hand.)//\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** You hesitate, brother.\n\n**Dafydd:** You want war. A war with creatures we have fought for thousands of years. A war that would cause unimaginable shifts, thaumaturgically, geopolitically and potentially biologically. I - I - can't allow you to do that.\n\n//(SCP-6916-B withdraws their hand. The SCP-6916-C entities begin prowling again.)//\n\n**SCP-6916-B:**  With all due respect, I am a king of this land. I am not like the Tuatha. I will not hide behind [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7010 |wards]]]. I will do what I see fit. Where is your pride? You said your organisation defended humanity. Why do you instant on continuing this confinement and squandering? Why do you protect this - vail?\n\n**Dafydd:** Because the world has grown so much since you were imprisoned. Your war with the Tuatha and - Gwyllion was nothing compared to what happened after. We've had battles that spanned entire realms of existence and have only just started to recover from them. We don't want that. I'm not confining humanity. I am protecting it. And if you think you can start a war just -\n\n//(Dafydd looks SCP-6916-B in the eye.)//\n\n**Dafydd:** Where are the people who came here?\n\n//(SCP-6916-B continues to look at Dafydd.)//\n\n**Dafydd:** You've already started the war, haven't you?\n\n**SCP-6916-B:** You would have done such good, brother.

The island within SCP-6916-A has been given a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-02 |Nexus]]] designation due to its historical significance and potential threat towards the anomalous community.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Nexus Registration: Nx-02\" hide=\"▽ Nexus Registration: Nx-02\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Annwn.jpeg|align=center|width=100%|caption= Nx-02, located within SCP-6916-A, photographed by Agent Siwan Caradog during their exploration into the extradimensional space.]]\n\n**Nexus #:** Nx-02\n\n**Civilian Designation:** Annwn //(Formerly Avalon)//\n\n**Population:** Unknown\n\n**Area Class:** Camelot\n\n**Nexus Interaction Protocol:** To prevent the public's access to Nx-02, the Foundation is continuing its containment procedures regarding SCP-6916, with the addition of detecting departures from Nx-02. If individual/s successfully access Nx-02, they are to be retrieved as soon as possible and subjected to interview and amnestic and oneirological treatment.\n\nAccess and traversal into Nx-02 by Foundation personnel is to remain a high priority, to prevent an LV-Zero \"Lifted Veil\" scenario.\n\n**Containment Facility:** Site-12\n\n**Description:** Nx-02 is an island located within the partially, extradimensional space known as SCP-6916-A. Nx-02 is accessible from any coastline within the British Isle and Northern France. To date, the only known way of accessing Nx-02 is to apply an NHK, following subjection to SCP-6916. However, this access can be revoked. Those who attempt to reach Nx-02 with revoked access will be subject to translocation and be redirected back to the point of perpetration.\n\nNx-02 is home to several spectral entities, including SCP-6916-B, who is capable of numerous thaumaturgical workings, including atmomancy, necromancy and oneiromancy. Due to their revoked access, it is believed SCP-6916-B is actively disengaged with the Foundation. However, recent evidence suggests Nx-02 may be open to other Groups of Interest. Research is ongoing.\n\nDue to having revoked access, the history of Nx-02 is mostly unknown, with only the statements made by SCP-6916-B providing any insights. Nevertheless, historical records were able to provide some details.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSince enacting more focused and stringent containment procedures, individuals lost to SCP-6916-A have decreased, with only 57 SCP-6916 subjects managing to evade Foundation protocol. However, with the sudden increase in nationalism in the Celtic regions, subjection to SCP-6916 is predicted to increase within the next year.\n----\n= [[span class=\"terminal-span\"]]END OF FILE[[/span]]\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"imm-email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email?

Please see below:\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n**Foreword:** This footage was passed on by an undercover Foundation Agent within GoI-006 (\"Unusual Incidents Unit\") following a murder investigation at Cillian's Apothecary in FP-01 (\"Three Portlands\").\n\n------\n\nSecurity footage shows Ahern, a Aos Sí phytotherapist, working when the two hooded individuals break in through the backdoor. Ahern attempts to apprehend them using chlorokinetic techniques but is restrained in a headlock by an unseen, third individual. As Ahern struggle against the invisible individual, the hooded individuals remove their hoods, revealing one to be PoI-6988 and the other to be Tuatha.\n\nThe pair appear to threaten and question Ahern, who merely angrily denies their questions and at one point, spits on PoI-6988. After a few minutes, the Tuatha holds up Ahern with a metallic, prosthetic arm. Blisters begin to form on Ahern's skin where the metal touches it, and their wings burst from their clothes and begin to shed. PoI-6988 then points at Ahern's chest and whispers something. Ahern's body then goes rigid and a tree begins to grow around their body. The tree stops growing, leaving only Ahern's eyes, left ear and right fingers exposed. PoI-6988 then carves a symbol resembling a Triskelion in the base, before leaving with the others. Ahern expired 10 minutes later.\n\n------\n\n**Afterword:** When the Department of Spectral Phenomena applied thaumaturgical, ectographical techniques to the footage, the third individual was revealed to be a spectral entity, resembling Second Lieutenant Nathanial Logan. The symbol carved by PoI-6988 has begun to show in various locations worldwide, most notably in the Free Ports and in human subspecies habitats.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAs well as the appearance of this group, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-184 |184]]], 322, 96 and [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-57-hub |57]]] have come in contact. 4 further 6916 subjects have gone missing. However, Logistics and Transportation checked and confirmed they never left their home countries and states (Pennsylvania, Nova Scotia, Falkland Islands). This can only mean one thing. SCP-6916-A is extending its borders.\n\nAlso, Project Signal-Man have reported spikes in spectral entities and activities within the UK again. Mostly around the coast. They don't last long. Only a few seconds but there nonetheless.\n\nGiven these changes, I believe we should change SCP-6916 to a Red classification and have it redesignated as Keter as soon as possible. I can't help feeling there is something big coming.\n\nYours,\n\n//Zachary Dafydd, PhD//\n@@ @@\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** ifan.jpeg\n> **Name:** crimean war soldiers\n> **Author:** Jedimentat44\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/21002762@N07/7576750834\n=====\n> **Filename:** fort.jpeg\n> **Name:** Dolbadarn\n> **Author:** Hefin Owen\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/47515486@N05/49654560027\n=====\n> **Filename:** silvertree.jpeg\n> **Name:** ―for the night is dark, and full of terrors 🌅\n> **Author:** anokarina\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/anokarina/7567033504/\n=====\n> **Filename:** Annwn.jpeg\n> **Name:** Misty Islands\n> **Author:** Xa'at\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/8220587@N08/2174902435\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=true | last=false | hub=no\n| previous-url=/ | previous-title=/\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-02 | next-title=Annwn\n| hub-url=/ | hub-title= A World Full of Weeping\n]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6915]]] | SCP-6916 | [[[SCP-6917]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
