Many are seeking refuge here to avoid [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/house-call the plague] or wandering abominations. Lately, Fundamentum knights are hunting for a beast in the area that drinks the blood of its prey. Seven people had already perished prior to my arrival. Witnesses described it to be like a wolf, but unusually large with eyes shining like the crimson moon above. The creature may possibly be a familiar or the lycan transformation of a vampire. Either way I will assist in slaying the beast. However, I must first replenish my supplies while I am here. There are plenty of traders from Dezmond. Perhaps I may encounter [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/olivers-shop-of-curiosities Oliver's shop].##\n@@ @@\n**##black|__Requirements__##**\n##black|Powder for blunderbuss##\n##black|Live bait for the beast##\n##black|Large net##\n##black|Holy water and garlic - mix for health potion##\n##black|Secure lodging##\n@@ @@\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@ \n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aunusual-cargo/TOAST-PAPER.jpg\") center repeat; float: center; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;\"]]\n##black|The creature was more than it appeared to be. It was in fact a mechanical golem with the beating heart of a wolf. Intricate clockwork ticked together with every movement. Instead of a tongue it had a syringe connected to a pump. The fur of wolves were crudely stitched together, and placed over its iron skeleton like a coat.##\n@@ @@\n##black|My trap did not work as expected for the beast simply tore out of the net. A shot from my blunderbuss was able to destroy a large portion of its head. Unfortunately, I am now in need of a new blunderbuss for the barrel was gnashed to bits. Perhaps I should acquire an enchanted replacement with more destructive power. Explosives were able to damage the joints of the beast, and it finally perished when I stabbed its heart. Then left it for the Fundamentum to find.##\n@@ @@\n##black|Now I wonder who could have built such an abomination. They are a skilled engineer. Possibly Mekhanite?

During my investigation, two Fundamentum knights and a civilian were killed in the eastern outskirt of Fort Bowe. Their blood was drained by what witnesses claimed resembled a lycan. I assumed it was another construct by whoever built the mechanical wolf. Why create only one? I tracked down the golem deep in the woods where it ambushed me.##\n@@ @@\n##black|It tried to slash me with long blades that protruded from the forearms, but I used the trees to get it stuck. Eventually I jabbed my explosive dagger into the joint of its right shoulder. It managed to remove the entire right arm, but the mechanical lycan was still functional. I tried stabbing my sword into where the heart should be, but the mechanical beast decided to flee deeper into the woods. Fortunately, I hit it with a fragrance potion to follow its trail. First my injuries need to heal. There could be more mechanical golems, and I need to be in the best condition.##\n@@ @@\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aunusual-cargo/TOAST-PAPER.jpg\") center repeat; float: center; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;\"]]\n##black|I went to find where the mechanical lycan went. The bloodhound potion allowed me follow the fragrance to a cavern hidden behind an illusory barrier. I entered it to find an impressive workshop with an assortment of tools, and an enchantment table. Glass bulbs cultivating luminescent fungi provided adequate lighting from the ceiling. It was there I found the culprit responsible for the mechanical beasts.##\n@@ @@\n##black|Despite wearing a cloak, I could tell he had replaced parts of himself with metal, especially by his clanging footsteps. My suspicion of him being a Mekhanite seemed correct, but his eyes were quite inhuman. Three mechanical golems accompanied him: the lycan mentioned previously, a centaur, and a hawk. The latter remained perched on a metal staff clung to by its creator. He didn't speak as the mechanical centaur and damaged lycan proceeded to attack me. It was a difficult battle. The centaur had two hearts for both halves. Even when I destroyed the one in the upper body its legs continuously kicked. As for the lycan I was able to place an explosive in its jaws. Eventually I destroyed both of them, but the Mekhanite had already fled by then.##\n@@ @@\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aunusual-cargo/TOAST-PAPER.jpg\") center repeat; float: center; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Reenie Beanie' ;font-size: 22px;\"]]\n##black|In the workshop I found empty glassware that reeked of blood, including a copper chalice that was recently used. The Mekhanite must have been drinking the blood. There were also a few jars containing the hearts of men and beast. However, the most noteworthy discovery was a partially burnt letter. It requested containers filled with blood in exchange for additional supplies, and at the bottom the letter was signed by __Percival Dark__ â€” that bastard. Perhaps the Mekhanite is returning to him in the shadows of Dezmond, which will save me a trip. Before pursuing I must ensure the Fundamentum find the workshop.##\n@@ @@\n##black|__Requirements__##\n##black|Visit Oliver's shop at Dezmond##\n##black|Acquire new blunderbuss##\n##black|Refill bloodhound potion##\n##black|Explosives##\n@@ @@\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@",
