What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user WhiteGuard]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user WhiteGuard]] a link to your piece and he'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[memorandum-083-regarding-project-guardianship|MEMORANDUM 083]]], [[[as-on-a-darkling-plain|Prelude]]], and stories set in West and Central Asia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[Song of Sophia]]], [[[Vast Suspended Ruins]]], and Articles That Jump Around Time\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe vast majority of articles on the site trend toward the modern era. You can find ones that dip back into the 20th century, usually from the 40s onward, and occasionally you'll find some that do the opposite and leap //ahead// into the not-so-distant feature. These allow writers to explore period pieces and sci-fi, respectively, but most articles still remain ambigiously set, with the events of the anomaly occurring in the 21st century.\n\nOf course, some articles buck this trend. While their framings may be modern, the events of the anomaly may have occurred centuries or sometimes even millenia ago. This is fun for history articles, because it allows writers to explore time periods so vastly different from now that a lot of our favorite narrative tricks won't make sense - you can't exactly find interview records from the 13th century, can you? It encourages us to get creative in what we do.\n\nOn the opposite end you have articles that jump into the distant future, presenting a view of the Foundation ranging from cyberpunk to scifi to obsolete. We have some canons dedicated to this idea, but many articles don't ascribe themselves to those canons; they simply establish the article's canon as the Foundation being an interstellar organization in the grim, dark future - or occasionally a happy future!\n\nAs authors, we should feel freer to jump around in time periods than the traditionally accepted give-or-take of 50 or 60 years. - someone has to push the envelope, right?\n\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write an article set in ancient history or the far future. What that means in terms of years is up to you.\n* **For artists:** Draw what you imagine Foundation personnel would have looked like in either of the above time periods.",
