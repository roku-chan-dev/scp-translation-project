In addition, a log is to be maintained of the locations of all known SCP-5778-A instances and the symbol required to access them, classified to personnel with less than Level 4 security clearance.\n\nAll current entranceways to SCP-5778-B from SCP-5778-A are protected by electrostatic tesla gate emplacements, motion-activated defensive weaponry, and motion-triggered antipersonnel mines. These emplacements are set to automatically activate and terminate any hostile entities without a Foundation IFF transponder. Any situation in which hostile entities breach the second layer of defenses constitutes a breach of containment.\n\nGiven SCP-5778's esoteric requirements for entry and overall inconspicuous nature among the general public, no further containment procedures are necessary. However, close observation of each individual SCP-5778-A instance currently known to the Foundation is required, with surveillance tactics varying per area.\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-5778 is the collective designation for an abandoned anomalous logistics network located primarily in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with several nodes located in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. SCP-5778 itself comprises two tangible segments: a two-way \"entry point\" accessible only by inscribing an esoteric symbol upon the entry point's surface (designated SCP-5778-A), and a large inner facility functioning as a hub structure (designated SCP-5778-B), both of which are connected by a network of straight tunnels. \n\nSCP-5778-A instances normally take the form of inconspicuous objects with appropriate variation by location; for example, one recorded SCP-5778-A instance within a forest in Northern Georgia took the form of an ordinary oak tree, while a second recorded SCP-5778-A instance within Miami, Florida took the form of a garbage dumpster. Each SCP-5778-A instance is connected to a unique concrete tunnel approximately 15 meters wide, 20 meters high, and 180 meters long. Each tunnel is accessible only by entering SCP-5778-A and each tunnel leads directly to SCP-5778-B in a straight line. The tunnels are lit by light fixtures powered from an unknown source. \n\nEach SCP 5778-A instance is theorized to function as a conduit for a currently unknown type of [http://www.scpwiki.com/goc-supplemental-arad Aspect Radiation], which the Foundation believes is responsible in some way for SCP-5778's anomalous nature. Further research into this connection and the nature of this form of Aspect Radiation is underway.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5778/scpmap.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A map of all known SCP-5778-A locations and their theorized energy connections within the contiguous United States. (Hover to Enlarge)\n]]\n\nSCP-5778-B is a seemingly subterranean facility containing a series of intersected service tunnels 10 meters wide and 17 meters high, with smaller tunnels connecting to the primary structure in the center. This structure contains several smaller corridors, storage rooms, and service shafts, all centered upon a large computer-filled control room elevated above the rest of the structure via a stairwell. SCP-5778-B is only accessible via the tunnel found inside any SCP-5778-A instance. Although SCP-5778-B's control room is mostly inoperable and visibly worn with age, the facility itself appears to have working electricity, as all lights and \"oxygen circulation systems\" appear to be on at all times. In addition, the operating system of the working computers appears to be equivalent to most modern computer operating systems (as of 1997).\n\nPlacards in English are found throughout the facility to assist in navigation, and also indicate that the names of the tunnels and of the SCP-5778-A gateways follow an alphanumeric designation system (e.g. Gate A-32). These correspond to a database located on a computer in the control room, which lists the letter, number, and coordinates of the SCP-5778-A instance.\n\nSCP-5778 itself is not physically located anywhere in the world, but instead intersects with both the current baseline of reality and an unidentified higher dimension, wherein space is compressed into a smaller form, though time remains unaffected. Although SCP-5778 would otherwise normally comprise an area of tens of thousands of square kilometers given the extent of the SCP-5778-A instances found throughout the world, the actual area of SCP-5778 itself is measured to be only approximately 20 square kilometers. \n\nAny matter which enters SCP-5778 through a SCP-5778-A instance and exits through a different SCP-5778-A instance is instantaneously transported to the exit point in the baseline reality. By using SCP-5778, great distances can be traveled in effectively the same amount of time it would take to normally walk between two SCP-5778-A points while within the anomaly.\n\n----\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5778 was brought to the Foundation's attention following the disappearance of 39 year-old Lester Jenkins of Nevada on June 17, 1997. Prior to his disappearance, Jenkins had served for 13 years in the United States Air Force Security Forces at Edwards Air Force Base, though was later discharged due to mental health and safety concerns after experiencing several manic episodes. \n\nDocuments recovered by Foundation informants within GoI-616 \"PENTAGRAM\"[[footnote]][http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-4776 Codename for the United States Paranatural Warfare Command, the occult branch of the U.S. Department of Defense][[/footnote]] revealed that Jenkins was already on a PENTAGRAM watchlist by the time of his disappearance, due to the fact that the amnestics the PENTAGRAM issued after his discharge were apparently faulty and worsened his manic episodes. These amnestics were apparently issued due to Jenkins' \"exposure to the transportation of classified goods,\" as per the PENTAGRAM dossier.\n\nJenkins hosted the show \"The World Beyond\" on the now-defunct radio station 125.7 WKFQ, in which he would often discuss in length his conspiracy theories in lengthy diatribes against the US Government. Following the broadcast of his June 17 episode (see Addendum 5778.1), which discussed the then-unidentified SCP-5778 in great detail, Jenkins would go missing, presumably in search of a SCP-5778-A instance near Dulce, New Mexico. The absurdist nature of the broadcast itself, combined with an overall lack of interest in Jenkins' subject matter among the general public, allowed the Foundation to cover up the broadcast with standard misinformation campaigns under the guise of an FCC operation.\n\nFoundation agents would later raid Jenkins's home, finding evidence of the PENTAGRAM's presence prior to their arrival, as the property had already been searched when they arrived. Agents managed to locate a hidden compartment in Jenkins' bedroom, containing a set of coordinates leading to a remote area near Dulce, along with several manuscripts filled with esoteric symbols believed to grant access to SCP-5778-A. Following the investigation, it was determined that the PENTAGRAM intended to access SCP-5778 before the Foundation. Armed Site-21 staff launched OPERATION: GOLDEN ORB (see Addendum 5778.2) to secure the anomaly in time.\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum 5778.1:**\n= Excerpt From June 17 Episode of \"The World Beyond,\" 125.7 WKFQ \n\n[[collapsible show=\"<< ACCESS RECORDING >>\" hide=\">> HIDE RECORDING <<\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **ARCHIVAL RECORDING**\n= **ARCHIVE DATE:** JUNE 17, 1997\n----\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Intro music]//\n\n”THIIIS IS 125.7 WKFQ, and you're listening to... //[Echoing voice effect]// The World Beyond... //[Normal tone]// and I have got a little message for you Fed assholes out there — I’ve got you GOOD!

I know what you've done to me—the fluoride in the water, the toxic chemicals in the air, the MEMORY ERASING DRUGS you gave me. The black cars parked outside my house—you know that I know something, you know that I have guarded this nation's secrets for THIRTEEN YEARS, but I intend to share it to the world today! \n\nBeloved listeners, there... //[pause, as if swallowing spittle]// there exists an entire NETWORK beneath our feet that the CIA-FBI-DIA GANGSTER FED TRIUMVIRATE has crafted to serve the GLOBALIST ELITES for their own nefarious shadow game. Tunnels from garbage cans and other innocuous objects lead into a massive, empty space chock full of weapons and supplies for their hidden army, and you know what they've done with it, listeners?! They've shipped out WAR, people. Men and materials are shipped across oceans in seconds, agents are sent over to foreign countries to propagate revolutions and assassinate sovereigns before receding into their trash can portals. Worse, NUCLEAR WEAPONS are being delivered to the frontlines right under everyone's noses!\n\nI've SEEN what they drive out to Area 51 after a brief stint guarding there. I //know// the nature of this network. There is no teleportation grid—we're not THAT advanced—or hollow earth tunnels, but the passage is hidden within plain sight. Ley lines. The concept is simple. \"Imaginary\" lines which crisscross the globe, dotted with monuments and landmarks and other terrain features. They're currents for esoteric Gaean energy, which can be harnessed... which this network harnesses. And by harnessing this energy, travel is made instantaneous between two points. One moment you're walking into a brick wall... the next... you're in an alleyway in Denver. \n\nRemember the saying that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line? Think about it.\n\nThere are few ways to access it, but I know, viewers, and I intend to explore and EXPOSE the secret GLOBALIST ELITE ILLUMINATI tunnels MYSELF. I've memorized the symbol inscribed onto the grill of the M35 trucks, an inverted triangle atop another, and a line through the middle. I'll find it. I'll figure it out. I'll be the visionary.\n\n//[Heavy Sigh]//\n\nOkay. Let's start with our first set of calls. We've got our first caller on the line now.

After some time passes, they eventually reach a dirt road leading towards a large depression in the earth.

Get that door open.\n\n**LYNN:** Roger that. \n\n//[The team get up from their defensive position and tactically advance upon the rock in a staggered column with their weapons drawn, while checking their surroundings periodically. Lynn, in the front of the formation, approaches the boulder and slings her rifle on her shoulder, then traces a triangular pattern against its surface with her finger. Upon completion of the pattern, her arm suddenly phases into the boulder. She then unslings her rifle, steps inside, and passes out of sight.]//\n\n**BUCK:** So, I guess this is what you guys didn’t want to tell me. \n\n**SPADE:** I think it only gets weirder from here, Buck. \n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image scp-a.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nCaptured image from Delta-6-2's helmet camera.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n//[The rest of Delta-6 enter the boulder, entering a concrete room lit up by buzzing light fixtures above. Ahead of them is a tunnel extending out as far as the eye can see, and behind them is an open submarine hatch-like door with the letters **C-32** printed in white above the doorway. Agent Lynn is crouched by the entrance of the tunnel, rifle downrange.]//\n\n**SPADE:** //Kak//, it’s bright in here. NVGs off. \n\n//[Delta-6 deactivate their helmet mounted night vision equipment due to the brightness in the area. After closing the hatch behind them, Buck looks down the tunnel.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Fuck //me//, man, they seriously could’ve gotten the Mole Rats to do this shit instead. \n\n**LYNN:** Claustrophobic now, Buck?\n\n**BUCK:** Shut the fuck up, Lynn.\n\n//[Spade and Lynn chuckle. Colt steps over to the others.]//\n\n**COLT:** Whaddya got, rookie? \n\n**LYNN:** Tunnel, goes down as far as I can see. It’s pretty well lit, though.\n\n**METRO:** Delta-6, this is Metro. We, uh, have seemed to have lost GPS position of you, can confirm that your video and audio feed are still transmitting, over. \n\n**COLT:** 6-1 to Metro, copy that, can confirm both are working on our end. GPS is still fucked, over. \n\n**METRO:** Continue with the mission, over. \n\n**COLT:** Affirmative, Metro. 6-1, out. //[Pause]// Only way on is forwards.\n\n//[Colt makes a hand gesture for the team to follow him into the tunnel. The team begins walking.]//\n\n**COLT:** So. Any preliminary observations you can make, make them now. Command's listening in. \n\n**SPADE:** I'm thinking it's an L'Engle anomaly.\n\n**BUCK:** In layman's terms, please and thank you. Not all of us on this team are former GOC, Spade.\n\n**SPADE:** Extra-dimensional, Buck. I'm thinking this is some sort of parallel dimension, or a higher dimension, or maybe a pocket dimension. Not sure.\n\n**BUCK:** What makes you think that?\n\n**SPADE:** Colt's compass and GPS acting fucky, for one. I'm getting weird background Aspect Radiation readings here, but from just eyeballing it, local reality is almost as stable as baseline.\n\n**COLT:** Who do you think made it?\n\n**SPADE:** Unknown, but this //feels// American. Maybe not.\n\n**BUCK:** For all I know, it could be commie.\n\n**LYNN:** Something about the way this was built is American. Just an inkling.\n\n**BUCK:** Did you see any tunnels like this in the DIA, Lynn?\n\n**LYNN:** Nope. There's the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, but that's not anomalous. \n\n**COLT:** Lights are getting dimmer around here, folks. Watch your step.\n\n//[More walking. As they turn a corner to the right, Lynn, who checks the corner first, suddenly throws up a balled fist. The team halts.]//\n\n**LYNN:** //[Whispering]// I've got eyes on one body, front. T-shaped intersection ahead.\n\n**COLT:** //[Whispering]// Spade, secure left, Buck, secure right. Lynn, you have the body. I've got the tunnel we came from.\n\n//[The team continues, gradually slowing down as the passage abruptly ends at a T-shaped intersection. They tactically bound into the intersection and surround the corpse. The body on the ground still seems fresh upon first inspection. It is wearing an American woodland camouflage [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Warrior Land Warrior BDU] with tactical gear, and has a large gunshot wound to the neck. The body lays beneath a large sign on the back wall of the intersection reading: “SMILE! YOU’RE ON CAMERA!”. Colt visually flinches at the sign and checks his surroundings, finding no cameras.]// \n\n**BUCK:** We're clear.\n\n**COLT:** English. Guess that answers that question. Who is it, Lynn?\n\n//[Lynn approaches the body and inspects it. She rips a Velcro patch off the body's right shoulder—it’s a trident upon a shield with a “6” placed in the center. She then gestures to a faded American flag patch on the left shoulder.]//\n\n**LYNN:** PENTAGRAM, SPEAR Team Six. Nasty GSW, too.\n\n**BUCK:** Christ. Think it’s Jenkins going Rambo, or something else?\n\n**SPADE:** I’m leaning on the latter. \n\n**COLT:** 6-1 to Metro; be advised: we’ve located a PENTAGRAM casualty inside of SCP-5778. Unknown as to where the others or Jenkins are. Please advise, over.\n\n**METRO:** Delta-6, this is Metro, standby.\n\n**COLT:** Get me 360-degree security. Eyes and ears open. \n\n//[Team pulls security in the intersection, using the walls from the SCP-5778-A tunnel they came in from as cover as they establish sectors of fire outwards from the body.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Getting the creeps here, guys.\n\n//[Silence ensues, save for the hum of air conditioning units within the tunnel. Thirty seconds pass.]//\n\n**METRO:** Delta-6, this is Metro. Continue with the mission as planned, terminate any hostile entities you find, the containment team will deal with the body later. Advise minimizing your noise and radio chatter. Advise finding any sort of “control room,” as Jenkins’ writing suggests the existence of one. As a reminder, MTF Nu-7 is on standby for QRF support. \n\n**COLT:** Copy that, moving out. \n\n//[Colt motions for the others to follow. They continue navigating through the tunnels for approximately fifteen minutes, following directions written in perfect English which point towards a \"CONTROL CENTER TERMINUS\" located deeper inside the facility. The lights are significantly dimmer in this section, but are still active.]//\n\n**COLT:** Nods on.\n\n//[The team activate their night vision equipment, halting at another T-shaped intersection. The path ahead leads to \"C 1-59\", and the path to the left leads to \"CONTROL CENTER TERMINUS\". Colt leans around the corner to check it.]//\n\n**COLT:** Clear. Doorway ahead. Buck, go.\n\n**BUCK:** Moving.\n\n//[Buck enters the corridor to the left, stopping at a doorway on the right side of the corridor.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Set. \n\n**COLT:** Lynn, go.\n\n**LYNN:** Moving. \n\n//[Lynn and Spade follow suit, followed last by Colt. They stack up against the wall.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Stairs, going up.\n\n//[Colt nods and exits the stack to ascend the stairs first, weapon up. He is followed by Spade, Buck, and Lynn.]//\n\n**COLT:** Stairway clear.\n\n**BUCK:** Fuck me, it's tight up here.\n\n//[Ahead is only a single corridor leading towards a wooden door.]//\n\n**COLT:** Clear. Doorway ahead. Spade?\n\n//[Spade looks through the large OCULUS sight affixed to his rifle and flicks a button on the side of the scope.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Two humanoid contacts, one presumed KIA on the ground, another far right corner, sitting.\n\n//[All team members flick their rifle safeties off and stack up in the doorway.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Let's fucking do this. \n\n**COLT:** Spade, flash and clear. Buck, clear left. Lynn, clear right. Everyone ready?\n\n**SPADE:** Ready. I've got flash set to go off past the door.\n\n**BUCK:** Ready.\n\n**LYNN:** Ready.\n\n//[Colt reaches for the underbarrel Masterkey breaching shotgun on his M16A4 rifle as Spade raises his own OICW towards the door. Colt racks the underbarrel shotgun and fires, blowing the doorknob off the door and causing it to open slightly ajar.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Flashing!\n\n//[Spade fires a projectile from the 20mm launcher through the hole created by Colt. A bright flash and loud bang comes from inside of the room as Colt kicks the door open.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Go!\n\n//[The team enters. As Buck clears the left half of the room, Lynn spots the humanoid contact on the right, who is animate and disoriented by the flashlights and flashbang. She aims her weapon at them.]//\n\n**LYNN:** PUT YOUR HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!\n\n//[The second humanoid contact comes into view as a soldier in a woodland-pattern Land Warrior BDU. He looks at Lynn, placing his hands over his face due to the flashlight before getting on his knees and throwing his hands up. Buck approaches Lynn and aims his weapon at the soldier as Spade and Colt enter the room.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Clear!\n\n**COLT:** Lynn, Buck, EPW. Spade, check those computers. \n\n**BUCK:** KISS THE FUCKING FLOOR, PAL!\n\n//[The soldier complies, laying face down on the ground with his arms extended out. Lynn approaches, kneeling down and cuffing the man as she begins thoroughly searching him.]//\n\n**SOLDIER:** Skippers...? Oh, shit, thank God it's you guys for once. My gun and ammo are on the tabl—\n\n**BUCK:** I //didn't// ask you to talk, kemosabe.\n\n**LYNN:** He's clean. PENTAGRAM, SPEAR Team Six.\n\n**BUCK:** We found one of your guys dead on the way in. Where are all the rest of your friends at, uhh...?\n\n//[Buck briefly rolls the soldier’s body over with his boot without resistance, inspecting his nametape.]//\n\n**BUCK:** ...J. Doe?\n\n**DOE:** It's a pseudonym that they give us all. The others are all KIA, scattered. Don't care either way. I'm done, man.\n\n**BUCK:** What, the tunnels giving you the creeps?\n\n**DOE:** More like I’ve realized something I shouldn’t have. I'm way in over my head, man.\n\n//[Buck gestures to the deceased man on the floor, who is also wearing fatigues, albeit an older and more faded uniform without any tactical gear.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Is that your friend over there, Mr. Doe?\n\n//[J. Doe shakes his head. Colt rolls the body over with his foot and quickly steps back.]//\n\n**COLT:** Oh, fuck. It's Jenkins.\n\n**DOE:** He was in here trying to shut the whole thing down, rambling about some inane \"N-W-O Elite\" crap when he charged me with a knife. Said he \"couldn't let them get to me,\" or whatever. I had to do it. I couldn't risk taking the body outside, 'cause I didn't know if the guys that killed my team were still patrolling the tunnels.\n\n**COLT:** Fuck.\n\n**LYNN:** How long have you been here, and how long did you know about this?\n\n**DOE:** Knowing you guys? Probably as long as you. All I got was a thirty minute briefing. Been here for maybe three hours now.\n\n**COLT:** I'll call it in. //[Pause]// Delta-6-1 to Metro, we've secured the control room. We have one POW, and can confirm that Lester Jenkins and the PENTAGRAM team are all dead. 6-3 is working on getting those computers online, over.\n\n**METRO:** Delta-6-1, solid copy. Get as much information about SCP-5778 and any unknown third parties as you can, and extract with the POW. Nu-7 is awaiting your arrival for extraction, over.\n\n**COLT:** Copy. 6-1, out. //[Pause]// Why's PENTAGRAM here anyways? Aside from looking for Jenkins, of course.\n\n**DOE:** Hell if I know, dude, the spooks stumbled upon this and wanted some SEALs to help secure this area, maybe to store weapons for later ops or something. I saw plenty of storage rooms on my way in, you know. I only got picked for this op 'cause I saw some weird stuff at night while SCUD hunting during Desert Storm. This shit's got me fucked up. Just get me back to Arlington wired on amnestics or something.\n\n**COLT:** Well, you're not dying today, granted you don't do anything stupid. Follow all my instructions, and I’ll get you on the first plane back home, preferably not in a bodybag.\n\n**SPADE:** Alright, I'm starting up the computer now.\n\n**BUCK:** Hey, Spade, do you think that shit they say about computers being demonic is true?\n\n**SPADE:** Shut the hell up, Buck.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image ABRAXASOS.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nCaptured image from Delta-6-3's helmet camera.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n//[Spade is inspecting the computer screen as it boots up. The words \"ABRAXAS OPERATING SYSTEM v 1.1\" appear on the screen, along with a logo and a complex geometric pattern. The screen goes black for a second, flashes a random series of colors, before text appears on the screen reading \"PLANETARY LEY LINE APPORTATION NETWORK - PLAN\". A blue desktop screen with the ABRAXAS logo centered presents itself, along with tables for \"GAEAN ENERGY STATUS\", \"FACILITY POWER\", “REMOTE VIEWING CAMERAS,” and \"GATEWAY MGMT\".]//\n\n**SPADE:** Holy shit, this tech is recent.\n\n**COLT:** How recent?\n\n**SPADE:** Like SkipNet[[footnote]]Slang for the intranet used by the Foundation, deemed modern by current technical standards.[[/footnote]] recent.\n\n**BUCK:** //[Looking at J. Doe]// ...You sure your government didn't build this?\n\n**DOE:** Your guess is as good as mine, Skipper, I sure as hell don’t know what this is or what to make of it. All I know is that the PENTAGRAM found out about this after bugging some outgoing shipments that were being sent out from Edwards and Area 51 to the middle of nowhere. They wanted this network for ops, but someone else already owns it. We found that out the hard way.\n\n//[Colt watches the door.]//\n\n**COLT:** They still around?\n\n**DOE:** Unsure. This is something that's way above my paygrade, man, even PENTAGRAM's, but it's undoubtedly American.\n\n**SPADE:** Uhh. Colt. Looks like there's more than one of those rock-gateway things. They follow a letter and number designation system, and they give out coordinates too.\n\n**COLT:** GPS coordinates?\n\n**SPADE:** Mhm. For their real-world locations, I guess, since we're in, uh... limbo or whatever. Like, see here. //[Pause]// Judging by the coordinates of that one, it’s in New York. That one's in London.\n\n**COLT:** How many are there, Spade?\n\n**SPADE:** Ehh... //[Pause]// ...twenty or so pages? Fifteen results per page. Might be more.\n\n**COLT:** Christ. I'm not gonna search this place top to bottom, I'm leaving that to the nerds t-\n\n//[A buzzer alarm suddenly goes off. Spade shifts over to another screen.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Uh oh.\n\n**AUTOMATED VOICE:** GATE B-87 HAS BEEN OPENED.\n\n**BUCK:** What the fuck?\n\n**AUTOMATED VOICE:** GATE C-32 HAS BEEN OPENED. \n\n**LYNN:** That's our gate. \n\n**DOE:** Oh fuck. Are they back?\n\n**COLT:** Who's \"they\"? Moreover, who just entered?\n\n**DOE:** The folks who took out my unit. Black uniforms, like cultists but with tac-gear. Hard to kill.\n\n**COLT:** What are they armed with?\n\n**DOE:** M4s and swords.\n\n**BUCK:** You're bullshitting me. What the fuck, man.\n\n//[Spade hurriedly tries searching for gate B-87 through the camera system. Text on the screen indicates that the B-87 camera is disabled, however. The same is for gate C-32.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Fuck. No dice. What's the plan?\n\n**COLT:** Exfiltrating, as per usual, but we're going a different exit. Spade, any of these gates lead to somewhere near Dulce?\n\n//[Spade looks on the computer frantically, then references a map he pulls out of his vest.]//\n\n**SPADE:** One about five klicks south. \n\n//[Colt marches over to the computer and looks at the coordinates, then checks Spade's map.]//\n\n**COLT:** //[Mumbling]// 36... 106... Dulce Mountain. Gate D-37... //[Pause]// 2 Charlie, this is Delta-6-1.\n\n**COWBOY:** Delta-6-1, this is 2 Charlie. What's up?\n\n**COLT:** Interrogative, how far away are you from the AO?\n\n**COWBOY:** Standby. //[Pause]// Ten mikes out. Why?\n\n**COLT:** Situation has changed, our current AO is compromised. An unknown number of hostile entities from an unknown GoI have just entered SCP-5778, confirmed armed and dangerous. They took out an entire PENTAGRAM SPEAR Team before us. We're getting out of here using another gateway that'll spit us out on Dulce Mountain.\n\n**COWBOY:** Copy that, we're Oscar Mike now. I've got a platoon worth of guys ready to clear out SCP-5778 once you arrive. Focus on gettin' out; I’m gonna get with Metro and tell 'em to have the containment team hold for now.\n\n**COLT:** Understood, 6-1, out.\n\n**BUCK:** We're moving out?\n\n**COLT:** Affirmative. We're going to gate D-37, QRF will clear out the place behind us. Doe, you're coming with. Lynn, keep an eye on him.\n\n**LYNN:** Roger that.\n\n//[The team vacates the room and descends the stairs. Delta-6 then begins moving quickly through SCP-5778, passing by various tunnels of increasing number, and pausing to check their surroundings. After about ten minutes pass, Spade, on rear guard, suddenly holds up a fist.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Contact, rear, humanoid. Marking.\n\n//[Everyone pauses and activates their night vision. In Spade's view, a target emerges from a tunnel, wielding an unknown object. Spade pauses, tries to identify the target, then switches from night vision to VERITAS. The object now comes fully into view as a firearm. He activates the IR laser on his weapon and marks the target.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Gun.\n\n**COLT:** Weapons free, Delta-6.\n\n//[Spade fires his OICW thrice, and Colt fires his M16A4 twice. They are followed by a flurry of shots from Buck and Lynn. All shooters hit the center of mass of the humanoid. The target goes down, filling the hallways with the sounds of pained male screams. Spade aims towards the chest of the entity to finish it off, but the humanoid begins to stir, as if trying to get back up.]//\n\n**DOE:** Aim for the head!\n\n//[Spade's laser snaps towards the head of the entity. He fires two shots into the head of the entity. It ceases screaming and finally drops to the floor.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Target neutralized.\n\n**COLT:** Double time!\n\n//[More shouting is heard further down the tunnel that the team came from as two glistening lights suddenly appear at the end of the tunnel. Spade then flings himself into the corridor perpendicular to the team as a tracer round flies past him. The round hits Doe's leg, causing him to collapse and holler in pain, pushing Lynn to the floor in the process. More flashes of light whip past the team as the sound of automatic gunfire from both sides of the team fills the tunnels. Buck begins wildly firing his gun at semi-auto, switching between targets in the tunnel behind them and targets in the tunnel in front of them.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Oh, fuck!\n\n**LYNN:** CONTACT FRONT!\n\n//[Lynn, on her back, fires a burst from her weapon downrange before getting up and helping Doe up, before rushing into the tunnel Spade is currently shooting from. A haze steadily begins to fill the tunnels, and Doe, the only person without a gas mask, begins coughing profusely.]//\n\n**LYNN:** Gas, gas, gas!\n\n**COLT:** //[Pointing towards Spade]// Into this passage, let's go!\n\n//[Colt covers Buck and Lynn as they move into the corridor Spade is in. Spade fires a projectile from his OICW launcher down the hallway to the front, which detonates and fills the hallway with thick white smoke, concealing the team from enemy fire. He does the same for the opposite hallway, allowing ample time for the rest of the team to enter his corridor.]//\n\n**COLT:** //[Reading the walls]// D-36, take a right here!\n\n//[The team takes a right at the intersection in question, entering a SCP-5778-A tunnel marked \"D-37\". Spade and Colt hold position at the entrance of the tunnel to cover Buck, Lynn, and Doe. As the three pass a certain point, Spade falls back closer to the rest of the team and provides covering fire for Colt, who does the same.]//\n\n**DOE:** Agh—fuck!\n\n//[Doe suddenly collapses, forcing Lynn to sling her rifle against her shoulder and begin dragging Doe towards the exit. Buck covers her as he fires downrange at hostiles entering the passage they came from. Another gun battle ensues as bullets start landing around the team. Colt is hit on his left arm, but miraculously continues to fire downrange from the hip with his firing arm.]//\n\n**COLT:** I'm hit! Arm's fucked! Spade, cover me!\n\n**SPADE:** Got it! They're filling the corridor, Colt!\n\n//[Colt reaches into his vest for an auto-injector with an SCP Foundation insignia on its side. He jams it into his arm, then begins applying dressing to the wound. As he is doing this, Spade is continuing to fire downrange at full-auto.]//\n\n**SPADE:** Changing mags!\n\n//[Soon, Colt is back on his feet, and begins hastily reloading his weapon, despite only one arm being functional.]//  \n\n**COLT:** SPADE, MOVE BACK! I'll cover you!\n\n**SPADE:** Moving!\n\n//[Spade rushes back towards the others and drops to a knee by the entrance of the gate room, alongside Buck. He fires an airburst round from his OICW past Colt, which detonates in the center of the group of humanoids, filling the hallway with a small explosion and neutralizing several hostiles further downrange. Lynn turns around momentarily to see that the passageway they had come from is now full of humanoids in black uniforms, wearing what vaguely resembles a cross between tactical gear and robes. Most of them are wielding ornate melee weapons and running towards them, using their resistance to damage to close the distance. They are almost within melee range of Colt at this point, even stumbling over the bodies of their fallen comrades to reach the two.]//\n\n**BUCK:** //SAM//! LET'S GO!\n\n//[Lynn sets Doe down and sprints forward, firing her weapon rapidly towards the heads of the humanoids. Using his armpit and sling to hold his weapon, Colt manages to rack his Masterkey one-handed and fires the underbarrel shotgun point blank at another entity, neutralizing it, before his rifle is grabbed. He is pulled towards the entities since the sling is still over his shoulder, but manages to duck, untangling himself from the sling and evading a stab from a sword-like weapon. He kicks the humanoid away with his foot and draws his sidearm, shooting it one-handed into the crowd. The humanoids closest to Colt are killed by Spade and Lynn, allowing him time to fall back to the gate.]//\n\n**BUCK:** Everyone out! Let's GO!\n\n//[Buck picks Doe up and opens the vault door with great effort. The team spills out into a cave surrounded by two squads worth of MTF Nu-7 operatives, who enter the cave wall and disappear from sight. Agent Cowboy approaches them from the entrance of the cave.]//\n\n**COWBOY:** You look like shit, Colt. We've got this from here.\n\n//[Cowboy enters the tunnel. More gunfire is heard as MTF Delta-6 and J. Doe evacuate the cave. The video feed abruptly ends.]//\n\n----\n\n= **[END VIDEO LOG]**\n\n----\n\n= __**OPERATION: GOLDEN ORB**__\n= **AFTER ACTION REPORT**\n----\n\nMobile Task Force Delta-6 \"Instant Action\" was extracted with zero losses and one (1) GoI-616 prisoner of war, \"J. Doe.\" Doe was returned to PENTAGRAM custody on June 20, 1997, following an interrogation at Armed Site-21 and dose of Class-A amnestics. The interrogation revealed that the PENTAGRAM had no prior knowledge of SCP-5778 or the group of interest which owned it.\n\nMobile Task Force Nu-7 \"Hammer Down\" neutralized all hostiles within SCP-5778 after three hours of fighting, sustaining 11 casualties in the process. Delta-6 and Nu-7 remained active in patrolling SCP-5778 until it was deemed fully contained on June 22, 1997, following a lengthy examination by containment specialists. Containment hardware is currently being delivered to SCP-5778 via an SCP-5778-A instance located 10 miles from Armed Site-21's location.\n\nAn investigation into the hostile Group of Interest which breached SCP-5778 is currently underway. Autopsies have revealed that the humanoids which assailed Delta-6 and Nu-7, despite drastic physical alteration to their anatomy and physiology, are a 100% genetic match to humans.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n\n= **Addendum 5778.3:**\n= Additional Documentation\n\n[[collapsible show=\"<< CLASSIFIED TO LEVEL 3/5778 ONLY >>\" hide=\">> ACCESS GRANTED <<\"]]\n\nBelow is a list of items of note recovered by MTF Delta-6, MTF Nu-7, and containment teams from SCP-5778 after securing the anomaly.\n\n> ||||||||~ Items Recovered from SCP-5778, 6/19/1997 ||\n> ||||||~ Item Name ||~ Description of Item ||||\n> |||||| Ammunition || Mixed ammunition of varying quantity were found in storage rooms throughout SCP-5778-B. Most numerous ammunition include 5.56x45mm NATO, 7.62x51mm NATO, and .50 BMG. These cartridges were non-anomalous and were secured by MTF Nu-7. ||||\n> |||||| Firearms || A number of US-made firearms (not including ones found on the bodies of PENTAGRAM operatives) were found within storage rooms SCP-5778-B. Most numerous of these were M4A1 assault rifles engraved with runes and decorations similar to the sigils found on the ABRAXAS operating system. These firearms were non-anomalous and were secured by MTF-Nu-7. ||||\n> |||||| Counterconceptual Camouflage Tarps || Agent Spade of MTF Delta-6 located ten Counterconceptual Camouflage Tarps within a storage room inside of SCP-5778-B. These tarps, when covering an object, will prevent an observer from perceiving the object or tarp without special equipment. Agent Spade was able to perceive these tarps through a filter module on his XM29 OICW. ||||\n> |||||| MREs || Agent Lynn of MTF Delta-6 located approximately 28 packages for an unidentified form of MREs[[footnote]]Meal, Ready-to-Eat, commonly known as MREs, are a self-contained individual field ration used by the United States Military.[[/footnote]] within a storage room inside of SCP-5778. The contents of these MREs vary from meals found in ordinary MREs, to unknown foods and items, including \"Elixr Powder\" and \"Ambrosia Cutlets.\" These foods are chemically consistent with soy-based substitutes and appear to contain excess amounts of essential vitamins and proteins, but are otherwise deemed non-anomalous. ||||\n> |||||| Photograph || A polaroid photograph was recovered inside of the SCP-5778-B control room. The flash appears to be on, and displays a number of hooded figures gathered around a SCP-5778-A instance in Bohemian Grove, Monte Rio, California. The robes worn are a match to the robes worn by the entities within SCP-5778-B. ||||\n> |||||| Notebook || A notebook was found within a locked desk in the SCP-5778-B control room. The text is encrypted via a sophisticated cipher, but appears to be a daily log of SCP-5778-A activity. The words \"God Bless America Forever.\" appear at the end of every log. ||||\n> |||||| Robes || A storage room containing several robes worn by the humanoid entities within SCP-5778-B was discovered by Agent Buck and Agent Lynn of MTF Delta-6. These robes contain a pocket with an anomalously expanded interior capable of holding a fully loaded M4A1 carbine. A tag near the neck reads \"MADE IN USA\". ||||    \n> |||||| Ceremonial Sword || A large steel sword was found within a storage room inside of SCP-5778-B by MTF Nu-7. The sword produces a constant electromagnetic pulse which disables all electronics nearby, making recovery difficult. It has remained inside the storage room due to security concerns in removing it. ||||\n> |||||| Photograph || A polaroid photograph was recovered inside of a keypad-locked room within SCP-5778-B. The photograph appears to be of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein meeting with a hooded figure inside of his palace. President Hussein is shaking hands with the hooded figure. ||||\n> |||||| Photograph || A polaroid photograph was recovered inside of the same keypad-locked room within SCP-5778-B. This photograph depicts the entrance of the dirt road leading to Armed Site-21's primary access shaft. ||||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n \n\n------\n\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n=  ##transparent|.##\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email?

What is important is that the attacking force managed to flee from our view, utilizing little more than an ordinary office door, which leads me to believe that somehow SCP-5778 is involved. \n\nAn investigation into SCP-5778 conducted by my own men of MTF Alpha-1 \"Red Right Hand\" has revealed that there were no motion trigger activations logged from gate V-1 on the database in Armed Site-21's operations center, which my team has discovered was the SCP-5778-A instance used to attack Site-42.\n\nArmed Site-21, fix your goddamn containment procedures post haste, or I shall fix them for you.\n\n\nO5-7\n----\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Armed Site-21 Command Staff, O5-7\n**From:** SCP-5778 Research & Ops Director\n**Subject:** Re:5778\n[[/div]]\n------\nSir,\n\nI've consulted with my staff regarding the incident. The gate which you are describing, \"V-1\", did not exist in the records of the computers in SCP-5778-B or our own database until the day of the attack.\n\nI have amended the containment procedures accordingly. See below.\n\nMLC\n----\nDr. Marcus L.

Any new SCP-5778-A instances or hostile entities found within SCP-5778 are to be terminated and reported to Command immediately.\n\nMobile Task Force Delta-6 \"Instant Action\" are the only Foundation personnel authorized to use SCP-5778 as a method of deployment. MTF Nu-7 \"Hammer Down\" 2 Charlie Platoon is to remain on standby at Armed Site-21 for any breaches of containment or hostile incursions. \n\nPlans to permanently disable SCP-5778 are currently underway. The remarkable resilience to damage shown by the SCP-5778-B control room computers and the poorly-understood nature of how the SCP-5778-A gateways function has proven that disabling SCP-5778 is exceedingly difficult. In addition, no explosives have proven useful in disabling any SCP-5778-A tunnel.\n\nAt this time, SCP-5778 is pending reclassification from Euclid to Keter. As of October 12, 1998, it is estimated that one new SCP-5778-A instance is created every month. The reasoning behind this exponential increase in appearances, and any patterns in which new SCP-5778-A instances are created, are currently unknown.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n=  ##transparent|.##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** bunkers.jpg\n> **Name:** \"Ammunition storage bunkers\"\n> **Author:** TSGT Jose Lopez\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://nara.getarchive.net/media/ammunition-storage-bunkers-c24881\n\n> **Filename:** scpmap.jpg\n> **Name:** \"Blank map of US states\"\n> **Author:** Jamesy0627144\n> **License:** CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map_(states_only).svg\n> **Note:** Edited by [[*user MarcusLCrassus]]\n\n> **Filename:** nightdrop.jpg\n> **Name:** \"SOLID SHIELD '89\"\n> **Author:** TSGT Lem Robison\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://nara.getarchive.net/media/as-seen-through-a-night-vision-device-members-of-the-1721st-combat-control-6f6fb5\n\n> **Filename:** scp-a.jpg\n> **Name:** \"A vault inside an ammunition storage bunker\"\n> **Author:** TSGT Lem Robison\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://nara.getarchive.net/media/a-vault-inside-an-ammunition-storage-bunker-c0e941\n\n> **Filename:** ABRAXASOS.png\n> **Name:** \"Abraxas OS\"\n> **Author:** [[*user MarcusLCrassus]]\n> **License:** CC By 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://i.imgur.com/srbHaYW.png\n\n> **Filename:** entrance.jpg\n> **Name:** \"CHECKERED FLAG '82\"\n> **Author:** TSGT Jose Lopez\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://nara.getarchive.net/media/the-door-of-a-tactical-aircraft-bunker-is-lowered-during-exercise-checkered-26a304\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
