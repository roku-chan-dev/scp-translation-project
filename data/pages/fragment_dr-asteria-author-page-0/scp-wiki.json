Ex. Site-26 is the first Foundation secure facility to be built outside of Earth's solar system. It is also the largest facility as the entire planet's surface is at the Foundation's disposal.\n\nOriginally conceived by Dir. Aphroditus Asteria on 28/10/2019, Ex. Site-26 was founded just six days later on 03/11/2019. However, despite the facility's completion, it did not contain any anomalies and lay dormant for almost two years. Its first object, SCP-6113, spontaneously appeared within the confines of the facility and was immediately contained on 24/10/2021.\n\nEx. Site-26 is manned exclusively by its only resident, Dir. Asteria. Despite this, the facility is outfitted with several living spaces and enough equipment and rations to accomodate any Foundation personnel, members of a friendly GoI, civilians, and humanoids that happen to find themselves at the facility.\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ Additional Information\n[[/=]]\n-----\n++ Emergency Action Plan\nIf communication with Dir. Asteria cannot be made within 5 years, Ex. Site-26 is to be presumed lost. If presumed lost, efforts are to be made to withdraw all objects and documents from the site to be placed in the custody of [http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/weiserthanyou Melody P.

She was contacted on 28/10/2019 by Foundation recruiters and was hired the same day. Assigned a temporary position to Site-06-3 as a Level 1 Assistant Researcher, Dr. Asteria expressed boredom in her assigned duties. However, her requests for reassignment (made on 02/11/2019), were denied.\n\nDespite this, Dr. Asteria would later found and personally construct Extraterrestrial Site-26. She was assigned as its director on 03/11/2019. Much to Dir. Asteria's dismay, Ex. Site-26 lacked any objects or documents in containment or archive for two years. As Dir. Asteria's performance was put under scrutiny, Ex. Site-26 soon contained SCP-6113. Dir. Asteria remains at Ex. Site-26 to this day.\n\n**Profile:** Dir. Asteria is a hard working employee with a drive for improvement. She often misunderstands or completely misses social cues from her peers and frequently forgoes breaks. Nevertheless, she has a bright attitude and is occasionally self-indulgent, especially in her [https://ko-fi.com/dr_asteria caffeine] addiction. She also has an apparent obsession with Coca-Cola Starlight as multiple filled bottles of the beverage have been seen scattered around her office daily.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"ACCESS EXTRANARRATIVE DATA\" hide=\"CLOSE DATA\"]]\n[[<]]\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=10\n|speed=30\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-ex-site-26/Asteria-min.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Dir.
