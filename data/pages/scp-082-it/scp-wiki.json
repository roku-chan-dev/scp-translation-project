The item can be used only for testing purposes, with prior authorization needed from the research coordinator. Knowing the hypothetical risks related to the use of the object, SCP-082-IT can be worn only by D-Class personnel. Given the absence of anomalous activity when not used, its containment does not require any additional safety measures.\n\n**Description:** SCP-082-IT is a bronze helmet of Corinthian design; although its creator and origins are still unknown, thermoluminescent dating[[footnote]] Technique used in archaeology to date ceramics, bronzes, and other materials of mineral origin. [[/footnote]] traces the origin near the 8th-century BCE., at the beginning of the Archaic Greece period. As shown by repeated experiments, SCP-082-IT seemingly appears to be devoid of any anomalous properties; once worn, however, it will enter its active state.\n\nAn inscription written in Greek will appear on the front of the helmet, which reads: //\"Και o σοφός και o δυνατός\"// (//\"Both the wise and the powerful\"//, which can be interpreted as //\"The one who knows is the one who holds power\"//). The individual wearing SCP-082-IT will experience a hyperfunction of their cognitive processes, mainly affecting vigilance, ideation, memory, and intellect. The nature and intensity of these alterations vary according to the time spent on the head.\n\n* From the start of the test to 6 hours (the \"maniacal\" phase): the subjects will show hyperactivity, rapid speech and low attention span; when given freedom of choice they'll prefer to dedicate themselves to activities that require the use of creativity (i.e.: writing or drawing), switching from one to the other in a disorganized manner.\n\n* From 6 to 48 hours (the \"performative\" phase): the subject behaves more coherently and is now capable of focusing on specific activities. Standardized tests reveal an improvement in logical-mathematical, linguistic, visuospatial, and procedural intelligence performances, with every score being above average. 3-4 hours of sleep seem to be enough for adequate rest.\n\n* From 48 hours to 5 days (the \"wise\" phase): the subject reaches intellectual levels no longer measurable through tests conceived for normal human beings, being capable of learning enormous quantities of information in a very short time period and executing any task with maximum efficiency (i.e.: learning from scratch to play an instrument or solving complex mathematical equations); they also develop an eidetic memory, allowing them to remember even the most insignificant details. The need to sleep is abolished altogether.\n\n* From 5 to 7 days (the \"encyclopedic\" phase): the subject is capable of \"remembering\" information that they have never come to know before, which is virtually the entirety of human knowledge; notions are verbalized in response to specific questions but are also capable of emerging spontaneously, in the form of intrusive thoughts that interfere with the normal flow of thoughts.\n \n* For information about longer duration tests see __Incident 082/1971__.\n\nEEG highlights an uninterrupted and increasingly higher Beta and Gamma[[footnote]] The waves registered, respectively, in normal waking and tension states. In the waking state with eyes closed the Beta waves are usually replaced with lower frequency Alpha waves.[[/footnote]] wave brain activity, even with closed eyes; sedative and hypnotic drugs have little to no effect. Part of the waves originate from SCP-082-IT itself as if they \"overwrite\" those of the host; it's therefore not clear whether SCP-082-IT merely influences the minds of others or whether it possesses some form of consciousness itself. As soon as SCP-082-IT is removed, the alterations will cease and the individual will appear confused and disoriented, reporting memory loss regarding the period of use.\n\n**Addendum 082-IT (Recovery):** SCP-082-IT was part of the private collection of [REDACTED], a rich and well-known collector of ancient artifacts, who purchased it on the black market from an unknown seller. Its anomalous properties have remained unobserved for a long period of time, until the man's child, 9 years old, decided to casually wear the helmet for fun; when the parents discovered him after several hours, the child had begun to manifest signs of an IQ far above the norm. The rumors about the \"little genius\" and the \"miraculous helmet\" reached the Foundation's agents, who then proceeded to cover up the news and confiscate SCP-082-IT.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ UPDATE: Incident 082/1971\" hide=\"◀◀◀ UPDATE: Incident 082/1971\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ATTENTION!\n**__By order of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/organizzazione-interna Ethical-Moral Regulation Section] (SRE-M), access to the following document has been prohibited to personnel with an authorization lower than Level 4. The people involved must refrain from speaking about the facts reported here until all individual responsibilities have been cleared up.__**\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\" style=\"background-color: #FFFFFF;\"]]\n\n**Researcher:** Dr. Filippo Tagliani, neuropsychologist specializing in mind-affecting anomalies.\n\n**Subject:** D-1971, 28-year-old male, convicted of armed robbery with voluntary manslaughter of a witness and serious injury of another, low-medium starting I.Q. (83).\n\n**Objectives:** Verifying the effects of SCP-082-IT for periods longer than one week.\n\n**Setting:** D-1971 is housed in a room with everything needed to test his performance (a table, a wall blackboard, various musical instruments and a library); the room comes with an attached bathroom, while a bed is considered superfluous. As already established in previous tests, the EEG's electrodes have been installed before wearing SCP-082-IT; liquids and nutrients, given the inability to feed, are supplied intravenously. Dr. Tagliani is assisted by two security officers.\n------\n[[=]]\n**__1ST DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nBehavior doesn't vary significantly from other subjects'. As expected, the \"maniacal\" phase is followed by the \"performative\" one. By the end of the day, D-1971's I.Q. has increased over 50%, reaching the value of 128.\n\n//**Researcher's note:** The first 6 hours have been a living hell, I've seen brats making much less of a mess. The room is full of papers smeared with attempts at abstract \"art\" and creative \"writing\". About that, I must remember to call a janitor to clean the walls.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__3RD DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nBeginning of the \"wise\" phase. After less than an hour spent leafing through a musical theory manual, D-1971 is capable, after a single listening, of executing an error-free performance by ear of Korsakov's //Flight of the Bumblebee// for piano. After being invited to choose a book from the library, D-1971 hesitates in front of Wittgenstein's //Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus//, only to discard it in favor of a series of volumes in the math section. In the late afternoon, D-1971 has now bridged the gap with more educated subjects and approaches the study of advanced texts.\n\n//**Researcher's note:** It's alienating to see a person juggling between formulas and theorems that, not even two days ago, would have caused nothing more than a blank face. The variety of choices of the subjects leads me to think that the helmet is a catalyst for certain unexpressed tendencies. I wonder if, in another life, D-1971 would have been a successful pianist or mathematician. Right now I'll allow him to continue; who knows if something interesting will come out of it.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__4TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nAt 2:37 A.M., D-1971 suddenly leaves his books and rushes to the blackboard, writing down a series of mathematical formulas; he stops just before sunrise, contemplating the results of his calculations, only to erase everything and start all over again. This happens multiple times in the following hours at irregular intervals.\n\nAt 15:13, D-1971 declares himself satisfied and announces that he has come up with the formulation of a theorem that confirms the Riemann hypothesis[[footnote]] One of the \"Millennium Prizes Problems\" (seven unsolved mathematical problems), related to a function that should reflect the distribution of prime numbers. [[/footnote]].\n------\n[[=]]\n**__9TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nDespite the appearance of the intrusive thoughts typical of the \"encyclopedic\" phase, D-1971 has decided to keep focusing on mathematical problems. It has been about two days longer than the longest test previously conducted.\n> **<Start of the Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** Good morning, D-1971.\n> \n> **D-1971:** //[Intent to copy from a sheet of paper onto the blackboard]// Hyvää huomenta paskiainen.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **D-1971:** I've said \"good morning\" in Finnish. Don't ask me how I know that, I just do.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** //[Writing in his notebook]// Interesting, the more this phase goes on, the more complex the acquired knowledge becomes. Anyway... you'll be pleased to know I've received the verification of your calculations[[footnote]] Performed by a selected team of mathematicians and confirmed by S5-2. [[/footnote]] and it seems that everything's right. Even your theory about the Navier–Stokes equations seems to be correct, the eggheads from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Vulcano Site Vulcano] almost wetted themselves from joy.\n> \n> **D-1971:** Mere formalities, I'm more than certain about the accuracy of my calculations.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** How is your work proceeding?\n> \n> **D-1971:** I'm one step away from solving the Poincaré conjecture.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** It's been 12 hours since the last infusion. Are you sure you don't really need a break?\n> \n> **D-1971:** Never felt better, doctor. The only problems are those guards: they've been talking out loud all morning and that's keeping me from focusing.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** I'll ask them to be quieter.\n> \n> **D-1971:** Here, can you hear them? They've started again, I can't work in these conditions!\n> \n> //Dr. Tagliani turns towards the guards. Both are completely silent.//\n> \n> **<End of the Log>**\n//**Researcher's note:** They said again and again that adding this much time to the test was useless, but they were damn wrong! I have to name this new stage; \"telepathic\" phase will do, I'm all about simplicity.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__11TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nThe intrusive thoughts, just as the mind-reading incidents, get more and more frequent; all the personnel within a 200 m radius of the room is equipped with an Inibipathic shielding system[[footnote]] An wearable headgear developed by the Italian Branch capable of shielding from the influence of low and medium power psychic anomalies. [[/footnote]]. D-1971's mental readiness seems to be partially affected by this; furthermore, it seems that the subject is gradually losing interest in those same activities he previously was enthusiast about.\n------\n[[=]]\n**__13TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nD-1971 interrupts his own research, refusing to continue; he also makes a feeble attempt to remove SCP-082-IT from his head, but he's immediately restrained. The deep apathetic state experienced by D-1971 is considered to be the beginning of a new stage, the \"nihilistic\" phase; Dr. Tagliani makes him wear a straitjacket to prevent other acts of defiance.\n> **<Start of the Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** I don't understand, D-1971. In a matter of days, you achieved something that many wouldn't be able to do in a lifetime. What’s stopping you now?\n> \n> **D-1971:** //[In a flat tone]// For what purpose, doctor? It's pointless to keep on writing and writing and writing. This infernal helmet gives me every answer to every question within a few milliseconds. Theory of Everything? Nothing more than a child's nursery rhyme. Cure for cancer? It's baffling how they still haven't got it. Reality is an open book; the thing is, no one before me had the right lens to read it.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** //[Getting upset]// Even more so! Think about what we could achieve with similar knowledge in the right hands.\n> \n> **D-1971:** //Right// hands, doctor? Yours, you mean? Or the Superintendence's hands, perhaps? Oh right, about that, I know everything there's to know about your dear Foundation, the helmet whispers it to me constantly. I know about all the deaths, the lab rats that came before me, and those that will come after me, I know about all the horrible things you do to contain your monsters, I even know what you're hiding there, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-001-it-graf in that old castle]. And you know what the best part is? You seriously believe you're doing it for the greater good.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** [EXPLICIT] the greater good! We're talking about science, this philosophical [EXPLICIT]...\n> \n> **D-1971:** \"... is not the reason why I'm here\". You can remove that ridiculous hat, I can still hear you either way. Actually I can hear all of you, but your voices aren't so annoying anymore, I tend to ignore them, truth be told. What is the useless babbling of inferior minds for those who can listen to the universe itself singing inside their eardrums?\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** This conversation…\n> \n> **D-1971:** ...is over. I know, doctor, I know //everything//, even if I'd like not to.\n> \n> **<End of Log>**\n//**Researcher's note:** I'm tempted to end the experiment, remove the helmet, give it to the next subject and start all over. However, there's more, I can feel it. It's better not to let anyone know, for now, that D-1971 has access to sensitive information. I'd just risk getting someone in the way.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__15TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nD-1971 has spent the last two days mostly motionless, staring into the void and occasionally whispering. At 19:20 he reports having a light headache and asks Dr. Tagliani to remove SCP-082-IT. Request denied.\n------\n[[=]]\n**__16TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nThe headache evolves into an intense migraine, D-1971 isn't able to stand or autonomously use the toilet anymore; being denied again the possibility to remove SCP-082-IT, he asks for some painkillers. Request denied.\n\n//**Researcher's note:** That guard looked at me like I was the devil. We're dealing with an anomaly that alters the neurological balance; I can't invalidate the data by providing medications.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__17TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nAfter hours of screams and pleas from D-1971, Dr. Tagliani administers some intravenous analgesic, without effects of any sort. D-1971, prey to a convulsive crisis, is tied to a stretcher to prevent him from hurting himself.\n\n//**Researcher's note:** I had to give in. It's only a matter of time before one of the gorillas goes behind my back and contacts the SRE-M. I just hope they don't make days of research go to waste just because a D-class refuses to do his job.//\n------\n[[=]]\n**__18TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\nThe screams and the convulsions stop during the night. The EEG shows that D-1971 is conscious, but he's entirely unresponsive to stimuli, with heart and respiratory rates reduced to minimum levels; the control of the sphincters is lost. The new phase is named \"catatonic\".\n------\n[[=]]\n**__20TH DAY__**\n[[/=]]\n> **<Start of Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Bigotti:** The experiment ends here, Dr. Tagliani.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** With all due respect... no one in the SRE-M has the competence to establish when a test like this should end or not.\n> \n> **Dr. Bigotti:** Look at this man, doctor! You reduced him to a vegetative state, all of this only for a bunch of data from which the Foundation does not benefit at all. We don't use D-Class like lab rats here in the Italian Branch. And don't think for a moment that we don't know about what D-1971 has revealed you. Do you even have an idea of the risks, security-wise? //[Addressed to the guards]// Untie him and take that thing off.\n> \n> **Dr. Tagliani:** //[Standing in between the guards and the stretcher]// No! You can't do this! I won't allow...\n> \n> //D-1971 \"wakes up\" screaming incomprehensible words, his body shaken by violent tremors.//\n> \n> **Dr. Bigotti:** Take that helmet off! Now!\n> \n> //The guards push away Dr. Tagliani and remove both SCP-082-IT and the electrodes from D-1971's head. The man's skull appears to be deformed, and a pulsating protuberance covers the left temple. The tremors increase in intensity.//\n> \n> **Dr. Bigotti:** What the...\n> \n> //A shock wave originates abruptly from D-1971's head, causing its rupture and violently overwhelming everyone; the room is covered with brain matter and bone fragments. Dr. Tagliani bangs his head, losing consciousness. A small grayish humanoid creature makes its way out of D-1971's shattered temporal bone. All those present who were still conscious report having heard a loud wailing coming from inside their own heads. The creature falls to the floor, wriggling for a while before ceasing to move.//\n> \n> **Dr. Bigotti:** //[Getting up from the ground]// What the [EXPLICIT] is that?\n> \n> **<End of Log>**\n------\n[[include :topia:cqb:carousel\n| images=Warning.png,Baby.jpg\n| caption=SCP-082-IT-1\n| interval=3600\n| wiki=scp-wiki\n| page=scp-082-it\n| width=197px\n| height=217px\n| position=left\n| options=no\n]]\n\n**Conclusions:** The entity (from here on SCP-082-IT-1) vaguely resembles a human fetus around the 4th month of gestation, it is about 16 cm tall and weighs about 220 g. Histological examinations revealed it is composed entirely of neuroectoderm[[footnote]] The embryonic tissue from which the nervous system and other cell types originate. [[/footnote]] and DNA tests revealed it to be a 100% genetic match with the late D-1971; an \"umbilical cord\" and \"amniotic sac\" were respectively identified as a bundle of nerves and meningeal fibers containing cerebrospinal fluid. Death was probably caused by the trauma of the fall.\n \nThe report seems to confirm that SCP-082-IT-1 developed from D-1971's brain mass. Therefore, SCP-082-IT possesses, besides mind-altering properties, the ability to redirect neuronal cells' development in an anomalous way.\nSCP-082-IT-1 has been preserved in formaldehyde.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 082/1971:** Final extract from Dr. Filippo Tagliani's personal notes.\n\n> //What happened is incredible. After so many years spent working with anomalies, I'd have never expected something that could still surprise me. Let it serve as a lesson to all the newbies who believe that a \"Safe\" class anomaly is automatically safe. That kid was lucky not to have the helmet for too long.//\n> \n> //They've informed me that I'll have to appear before a SRE-M committee for a disciplinary evaluation and that all future tests on SCP-082-IT are suspended until further notice.//\n> \n> //That's ridiculous! We've just scratched the surface, there are still so many questions left unanswered. Is it possible to make this creature survive? How would they evolve? At what precise moment do they start to develop? And at what speed?//\n> \n> //If this Foundation seriously cares about researching the anomalous, the tests MUST go on. I also believe that, in order to conduct more in-depth investigations of future specimens, our section should seek a collaboration with a surgical team from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/siti-italiani#Sito-Asclepio Site Asclepio].//\n\n**Update:** Once the investigation procedure was completed, Site Minerva received the following notification.\n\n> //Doctor Tagliani, although some of us do not share his methods and push for his removal from the Foundation, considering the results achieved, his request to continue with the experimentation on SCP-082-IT has been officially approved. You will be provided with the necessary equipment and assistance together with a pre-approved list of experimental subjects.//\n> \n> //The Superintendence offers you its congratulations and wishes you good luck.//\n> \n> //S5-5//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include component:license-box\n|author=Siddartha Alonne and Dr Zeno]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Elmo.jpg\n> **Name:** Elmo corinzio bronzeo.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Codas Davide Mauro]\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en CC-BY-SA 4.0]\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Elmo_corinzio_bronzeo.jpg Link]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Warning.jpg\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** Dr Zeno\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ CC-BY-SA 3.0]\n> **Source Link:** [https://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-082-it/disclaimer.jpg Link]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Baby.jpg\n> **Name:** Aborted baby.jpg\n> **Author:** SravyaDatla\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en CC-BY-SA 4.0]\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aborted_baby.jpg Link]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
