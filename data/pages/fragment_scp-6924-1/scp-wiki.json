Don't disappoint us.\n> \n> -Yossarian Leiner\n> Director of the Department of Tactical Theology\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ History of SCP-6924-A/B\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nReferences to both SCP-6924-A and SCP-6924-B (henceworth referred to by their civilian designations) can be found as early as the 12th century AD, with the mentions of \"the old folk of Saarnowie\" being briefly mentioned in the \"Gesta principum Polonorum\", a  medieval chronicle describing in detail the early history of Poland. The earliest references to Mięsiny can be found in a 1400 census record. The same census put the population of Mięsiny and Sarnowo at 188 and 81, respectively. \n\nDespite existing under a feudal system, neither of the villages were at any point ruled by a feudal lord, existing semi-independently from the Kingdom of Poland. The cause of this is currently unknown, but mentions of a \"Podlaskie Crusade\" in historical records indicate a failed attempt supressing the villages' autonomy. Descriptions of this event appear to be lost to time.\n\nAside from census records, neither of the villages is present in most historical records.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:**  21 April, 2018 16:43\n**Location:** Provisional Site-6924 Cafeteria\n**Present:** Dr. Ryszard Markowski, Rsr. Sandra Wróbel\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Wróbel:**...that means we have nothing, essentially\n\n**Markowski:** Not exactly. We do have the mentions of the crusade, which means the beliefs of the villagers were different enough from those of mainstream Christians for the church to deem them a threat. \n\n**Wróbel:** I'm not convinced, the census figures don't point at any significant loss of life and, if the Albigensian crusade is anything to go by, I doubt there would be anyone left by the end of it. \n\n**Markowski:** Good point, I suppose. Still, even I don't trust church sources, I doubt they would just make up a conflict. Maybe it was anomalous intevention? Would give them a reason to cover it up\n\n**Wróbel:** Maybe\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Known Folkore & Urban Legends\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nWith the turn of the 21st century, multiple folk beliefs as well as urban legends connected to Mięsiny and Sarnowo would enter public knowledge, including the communities' veneration of so-called \"Saint John\". This figure appears not to correspond to any known catholic saints bearing the name of John and has been described as \"patron saint of freedom\" by inhabitants of both settlements.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=psiarak.jpg|caption=An alleged photo of the \"Psiak\".]]\n\nAn urban legend about a cryptid inhabiting the forests Sarnowo and Mięsiny, known as the \"Psiak\", has gained notoriety in recent years. The entity has been described as an animal bearing both canine and feline characteristics, watching those who enter the village from a distance. All who claimed to observe it have reported a sense of intimidation, while not feeling threatened by it presence.\n\nUp until 10/04/2018, the entity known as \"Psiak\" has been assumed to be fictional.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:**  10 April, 2018 13:43\n**Location:** Road leading Mięsiny from Sarnowo\n**Present:** Andrzej Mielny\n**Foreword:** The following recording has been taken by a civillian using a dashcam. Due to the model of the recording device used, no audio was recorded.  \n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n[13:49-14:01]\n\n//[The vehicle is seen driving out of Sarnowo. The weather outside is cloudy. Raindrops can be seen occasionally impacting the windshield]//\n\n[14:01-14:03]\n\n//[Mielny slows down as he sees another vehicle overturned on the road, around 100 meters from him. He slowly drives closer, revealing it to be a black van]//\n\n[14:03-14:05]\n\n//[Mielny stops his vehicle and presumably calls the emergency services. A black, quadruped animal shape comes into view, its face obscured by the van]//\n\n[14:05-14:07]\n\n//[The entity turns towards the camera, revealing a distorted, feline maw. It remains for a minute, before taking a step towards Mielny]//\n\n[14:07-14:10]\n\n//[The vehicle suddenly turns around and begins driving out of the village at high speed, nearly hitting a child playing by the roadside. The entity does not attempt to follow it]//\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:**\n\n//Following this incident, Mielny was interrogated and amnesticized following standard protocols. The van seen in the footage has been registered to Miłosz Warkowski, a member of a non-anomalous organized crime syndicate operating in eastern Poland. Warkowski was reported missing on that day. His body has not been found//\n[[/div]]\n\nThe relations of the community with this entity are currently under investigation. \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:**  28 April, 2018 15:13\n**Location:** Playground, near the Mięsiny Football Field\n**Present:** Dr. Ryszard Markowski\n**Foreword:** Audio taken from a recording device hidden in Dr. Markowski's shirt. Markowski was carrying a drawing of the \"Psiak\" entity in his hands at the time of the recording. \n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[Faint sounds of children laughing can be heard for the first minute. The sound of wind blowing is present throught the whole recording]//\n\n**Markowski:** Hello there! May I take a minute, kids.\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 1:** Don't know, mom said not to talk to strangers...\n\n**Markowski:** Ehhh, don't worry! I'm not here to sell you something or grab you, it's fine.\n\n//[At least two children can be heard walking away]//\n\n**Markowski:** No, you see, I've lost my dog recently while I was driving by. It just hopped out of the car! I wanted to ask, have you seen it?\n\n//[Another child can be heard walking away]//\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 1:** I don't know...no, I didn't.\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 2:** Hey! That's not your dog, Mister. That's the Guardian.\n\n **Unknown adolescent voice 1:** Shut up!\n\n**Markowski:** Don't hit him! Guardian, you say? What's that?\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 2:** Well it's uh...uh...the thing that protects us, mom said. Like it keeps the bad people from the village.\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 1:** And mom told us not to talk to strangers!\n\n**Markowski:** I see. Sorry, that's everything! Have a good day, kids.\n\n**Unknown adolescent voice 2:** You too, Miste-ouch!\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Other Points of Interest\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nThe inhabitants of both villages display moderate technophobic tendecies. While most houses are connected to the electrical grid and their inhabitants utilize electricity in daily life, few regulalry access the Internet or purchase modern products. Upon questioning, all interviewed have claimed that technology \"pushes them away from their roots\", refusing to elaborate further.\n\nThe smell of rotting meat has been noted by Foundation personnel surveilling the settlement of Mięsiny during the evening hours. The origin of the phenomenon remains to be identified.\n\nDespite both communities containg a butcher shop, no outside deliveries have been reported to either of the buisnesses. DNA analysis of meat sold confirmed it to be of animal origin. \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:**  7 May, 2018 15:26\n**Location:** Provisional Site-6924 interrogation room\n**Present:** Rsr. Sandra Wróbel, Janusz Kwaśniewski\n**Foreword:** The following recording has been taken after the arrest of Janusz Kwaśniewski, the local butcher of Mięsiny, under the guise of a police investigation.\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[Kwaśniewski enters after Wróbel, visibly agitated]//\n\n**Wróbel:** Sit down, Mr. Kwaśniewski.\n\n**Kwaśniewski:** I am really sorry, but I am telling you I didn't do any-\n\n**Wróbel:** Sit. Down.\n\n//[Kwaśniewski and Wróbel sit down. Kwaśniewski does the sign of the cross]//\n\n**Wróbel:** Selling meat without a license seems like a serious offense, doesn't it?\n\n//[Kwaśniewski blinks, then calms down]//\n\n**Kwaśniewski :**...I...Yes, I suppose it is. Is this what I am being accused of?\n\n**Wróbel:** Of course.\n\n**Kwaśniewski :** Then I suppose I...have, yeah, I have been selling it without a license.\n\n**Wróbel:** And where have you been getting it from?\n\n//[Kwaśniewski looks down and goes silent. Wróbel repeats her question, eliciting no response. She remains seated, looking straight at Kwaśniewki]//\n\n**Kwaśniewski :** You're here for that, right?\n\n**Wróbel:** Excuse me?\n\n**Kwaśniewski :** Listen, it's...It's good meat! It doesn't scream, it doesn't feel, it's been blessed by the priest! Please, I'm...I'm....\n\n**Wróbel:** Wha-\n\n**Kwaśniewski:** We're not monsters.\n\n**Wróbel:** That- Okay, can you show me where that \"meat\" is?\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:**\n\n//Following this interview, Kwaśniewski would lead the investigators into a hidden basement of his shop, revealing a mass of flesh 4 meters in diameter and 2 meters tall. Samples and scans revealed the mass to be made of various limbs and animal organs. The organism lacked a central nervous system//\n\n//Janusz Kwaśniewski has been amnesticized and released following standard protocol. Investigation into the butcher shop in Sarnowo is currently pending//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Church Structure & Beliefs\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nIn addition to belief in the existence of \"Saint John\", the people of Sarnowo and Mięsiny  devote a significant amount of prayer and rituals towards him, while still considering him a subordinate of the Holy Trinity. The mythology around \"Saint John\" describes him as a devoted follower of Christ who had been born into slavery, before leading a revolt against his pagan masters. While the location of said revolt is unknown, a local priest has stated the coast of the Caspian Sea to be the likely location. \"Saint John\" remains the only divergent belief that the inhabitants of either community have publically spoken of.\n\nDespite the local population's claims to be of Catholic faith, neither the church in Sarnowo nor Mięsiny appears to be recognised by the Białystok Archdiocese, and in turn, by the broader Catholic Church. Due to this, the settlements can be classified as holding a unique denomination, or the broader label of \"Independent Catholicism\".\n\nAn investigation into more esoteric practices and beliefs of the denomination is currently ongoing.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:**  27 May, 2018 12:00\n**Location:** Church of Mięsiny\n**Present:** Bishop Temko Borecki\n**Foreword:** The following audio is an enhanced version of sound captured by a recording device left outside of the church in Mięsiny, shortly before Mass. Notes written by Rsr. Sandra Wróbel and Dr. Ryszard Markowski in regards to the contents of the recording can be found in the attached transcript. Elements irrelevant to the inhabitants' beliefs have been removed.\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[The first 20 minutes of the recording have been omitted]//\n\n**Temko Borecki:** \n\nBretheren, let us acknowledge our mistakes,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]I have noticed the word \"sin\" is not used at any point in the recording.\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowsk[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Local dialect?\n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Could be.\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowsk[[/span]]so we may prepare ourselve to celebrate our sacred mysteries \n\n\n\n**The Congregation:** \n\nI confess to the highest God[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Okay, there's certainly something going on. A Catholic wouldn't call a God \"highest\", as if there were lower ones.\n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]]\nAnd to you, my bretheren\nThat I have done great wrong\nThrough my thoughts, my words, my actions and the lack of them\n\nIt is my fault, my fault, my greatest fault\n\nTherefore I ask the highest Saint John[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Another difference of note, seems they have completely replaced the veneration of the Virgin Mary with Saint John. Do we have any information on when they claim he lived?\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowsk[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Still nothing, not even a millenium. Late antiquity seems to be the most likely option, though\n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]]\nAll the Angels and Saints\nAnd you, my brethren\nTo pray for me to the highest Lord\n\n\n\n\n**Temko Borecki:** \n\nMay Lord empower us, forgive our wrongs\nAnd bring us to immortal life\nAmen\n\n//[20 more minutes of the recording have been omitted, as no significant differences from the Catholic Mass have been observed. Of note, however, is the lack of the Nicene creed]//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]This makes me curious, why do these people use the Catholic label in the first place? It's clear that they are outside of the local Catholic hierarchy and hold a set of beliefs that would be considered heresy.  \n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Escaping persecution would be my guess. Assuming the records of the failed crusade are factual, it would point towards them having rejected the label before, before being persecuted.\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowski[[/span]]\n\n**Temko Borecki:** Sit down, brethren. We have gathered today not only to celebrate the grace and mercy of our lord, who stands the highest above all, but also praise the martyrdom of Saint John. For he has shown us how to fight, how to spread Christian love all over the earth, and how to keep our tradition. Thanks to him, our Guardians have protected our congregation, our people have been kept from famine, our community has remained prosperous. May his immortal strength guide us on the path laid by our Lord Jesus, in spite of the architects' wicked designs.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]...Architects?.  \n-Dr. Ryszard Markowski[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Seems like we're dealing with neo-Gnostics.  \n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]]\n\n**Temko Borecki & the congregation:**\n\nO Lord Jesus, the liberator of man, we thank you for our salvation. \nWe drink the blood that is your love and consume the meat that is your flesh.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]If we are, they are rather carnivorous for a gnostic cult. Haven't most recorded sects been vegetarian?  \n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Most of early Christianity was  \n-Dr. Ryszard Markowski[[/span]]\nMay we always follow you on the path you laid before us.\n\n\n**Temko Borecki:** Let us partake in the holiest communion\n\n//[15 minutes of extraneous audio have been removed]//\n\n**Temko Borecki:** O Lord, we thank you for this Eucharist, for your light and power. May it guide us away from the temptations of the Archons,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]This pretty much confirms it. So, Gnostics who are extremely obsessed with meat and venerate saints. Does it match anything in our records? \n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]No matches, their faith must be a new development\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowski[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Does feel a little familiar, for some reason\n-Rsr. Sandra Wróbel[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]I have no idea what you are talking about...wait, are you saying...?\n-Dr. Ryszard Markowski[[/span]][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Let's see...\n-Rsr.
