From its AtG ability we also know that it can defeat all other MOS archetypes. What other SCPs can SCP-Vs-J beat?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nBetterCallPrimrose 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nI mean, it's a -J so it doesn't really matter.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nSeems like someone didn't do their research on the [[[you|DoO]]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\n[[[SCP-079|OldAI]]] could beat it with prep time.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nOldAI runs on an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nOldAI could beat it with prep time and better hardware.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nInfiniteAllison 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"forumquote\"]]\nI mean, it's a -J so it doesn't really matter.\n[[/div]]\nWhy shouldn't it count?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nBetterCallPrimrose 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nI mean, because\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nBetterCallPrimrose 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nActually never mind\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nVS is Thaumiel so it can beat all of the lower object classes.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nNot this again. You know that Object Classes have absolutely no bearing on a match whatsoever? It'd be something else if you meant the Thaumiel Tier (and you'd still be wrong), but that's definitely not the case if you mean the object class.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nYeah they do. Thaumiel is a box meant to contain, so it is strong enough to beat anything you can contain into submission except for the A-classes Archon and Apollyon.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nThere's like, [[[scp-001-j|a button that destroys the world if you push it]]], how can a \"Thaumiel\" just defeat that?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nCan you push a button if it's in a box? Thought so.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\n//VS-J is not a box.//\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-01\n[[/div]]\nVS can beat MOS in everything so its faster then MOS and MOS is FTL so VS is FTL so it can keep anyone from pushing the button. So VS is a box.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"forumquote\"]]\nWhat other SCPs can SCP-Vs-J beat?\n[[/div]]\n\nDefine beat.\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nwdym\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nWell in the article all we know is that Pataphysics made Vs-J in a way so that it can \"beat\" MoS in every way someone could consider as \"beating\"\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nInfiniteAllison 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nWhat other ways would there be of Vs beating someone?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nidk it could be a bookreading contest. We could compare Vs to the Serpent.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nThe Serpent is multiversal Tier. Vs can't beat it.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nThat's a powerscale not a \"who is better at bookreading\" scale.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nNo, I meant bookreading multiversal. The Serpent is an avatar of knowledge and with SBF we can look at [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii|WIESerpent]]] who we know has all the knowledge in the multiverse, so it's an easy win.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nI'm not so sure on that. So first of MOS SBF has multiversal feats so VS is multiversal. Let's also consider that both start reading all the books of the multiverse at the same time at a point where neither have knowledge of them yet.\n\nIt stands to reason that with MOS SBF FTL/FTT, that with AG VS SBF is FTT, WL stands no chance. Mind you that [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/conversations-with-the-serpent The Serpent isn't necessarily the Library].\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nWhat?\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nOh, you meant AtG. But it's not true because you can't read at FTT. The books either all vaporize from the speed or don't open because you're too fast for causality to catch up with the books movements. Compare that to the Avatar of Knowledge who has to be faster in bookreading. Also if the WL doesn't exist yet (because that would be an instant win for the Serpent) we have to consider the following from [[[wanderers-library-hub|WL]]]\n\n[[div class=\"forumquote\"]]\nThe Wanderer's Library is the hub of all knowledge throughout every universe and dimension. Its endless halls carry every book that has or ever will be written (and several that won't).\n[[/div]]\n\nso WL is the only place that contains some of the books that never will be written and the Serpent knows the things in WL instantly as Avatar of Knowledge, which is faster then FTT.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-02\n[[/div]]\nThat makes me think of some other fun setups. Since SCP-Vs-J is ultimately an equation that Pataphysics derives victories from, do you think it could beat the [[[SCP-1313|Bearquation]]]?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nInfiniteAllison 2020-04-04\n[[/div]]\nBumbing threat. Also how do you make equations fight?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nEngineerhasPtV 2020-04-04\n[[/div]]\nOh, that's actually quite simple:\n\nWith w(A) as the property of A to derive [[[necessities|known anomalous individuals]]] that are still in A, with vs >,,b,, x meaning that vs \"beats\" x, with Q(x) as the property that makes x like MOS in vs >,,b,, MOS:\n\n(y >,,b,, X <=> ∀x. x ∈ X => y >,,b,, y)  ∧ w(A) <=> ∃a. (Q(a) => Q(MOS) => vs >,,b,, a) ∧ (vs >,,b,, a => AtG => ∀a. a∈ A vs >,,b,, a => vs >,,b,, A))\n\nHope that clears that up.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nInfiniteAllison 2020-04-05\n[[/div]]\nAnother one I've been wondering about is if Vs-J could beat [[[scp-6096|the Guest]]].\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2020-04-05\n[[/div]]\nOh, that would be a terrible matchup. See one of the things that we normally ignore for a SCP-Vs-J matchup is that Pataphysics first needs to calculate the equation in the correct circumstances to activate it, so it can beat the opponent. No one of the Pataphysics Department would ever calculate Vs-J to beat the Guest. They're under the compulsion of it like the rest of the Foundation and can't cause it harm or do anything that might result in harm. Let's say that the Guest actually targets one member of Pataphysics on the Vs project. If they're lucky enough to stay out of reach of MTF-Zeta-29 and actually manage to be aware enough of the Guest to start calculating Vs-J. Problem is that Vs-J is a highly complex and partially surrealistic problem so the target miscalculating when trying to calculate it alone instead of in a big group like is usually done is a given.\n\nWhat you get is not only the Guest still being an unsolved problem, but a rampaging miscalculated Vs-J that is out to \"beat\" whatever it was set up against. Let's say that the target does actually manage to correctly calculate Vs-J. It is not unlikely that Vs-J might be unaffected by the Guest's compulsion. It's implied that an AIC might be unaffected by the effect and with how Vs-J can defeat any MoS Archetype, it's not out of the ordinary to assume it might similarly be able to have the \"mindset\" (it's still an equation) of an AIC. The problem is now that Vs-J as we have seen in the article is under the observation of multiple extranarrative entities from all kinds of different positions in the stack. And if they observe Vs-J \"beating\" the Guest, they observe the Guest and fall under it's compulsion. Now you have multiple entities all to big for the universe trying to stop Vs-J from harming the Guest. It could with however slim the chances are with all what I've outlined here be possible for Vs-J to beat the Guest. But it would be at the cost of the universe. A person that is aware of both the Guest and on the Vs-J project would know this and likely try to help themself with a different project that doesn't result in their death.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nDeDeDeFoundation 2020-04-10\n[[/div]]\nActually with Vs being multiversal and knowing Sun Wukong [[[scp-2711|can die]]] Vs can travel to the underworld and [[[scp-3602|add him to the records of death]]] and thereby outliving/beating (per AtG) any variation of the Monkey King aka Son Goku.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nFlamingoWatch 2023-04-01\n[[/div]]\nI've been trying to make a comprehensive essay about all the older stuff on the site, but I can't find anything other then this thread about SCP-Vs-J. Anyone know what's up with that?\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"forumpost\"]]\nCee4urself 2023-04-01\n[[/div]]\nOh yeah, it got deleted\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
