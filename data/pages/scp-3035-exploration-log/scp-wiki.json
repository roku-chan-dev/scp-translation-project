Control, you receiving this?\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Loud and clear.\n> \n> **MOON:** Good. Alright, we're opening the entrance.\n> \n> //(Pneumatic hissing; sound of metal grinding.)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Respirators on. Stay sharp.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** //(gagging)// ...Jesus. I can almost smell this through my skin.\n> \n> **MOON:** Lighting is low, the floor... covered with some sort of sludge. Brown-black. Garbage everywhere -- crumpled cardboard boxes, office supplies... uh, looks like -- some rotting meat, too...\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Understood. Remember, Commander, your primary mission is just recon. Rescue any personnel you can, but do not put yourself or your team in jeopardy.\n> \n> **MOON:** Understood. Holy fuck, this place is disgusting. Wolf 1, stay by the door. Anything not-human tries to get out...\n> \n> **WOLF 1:** Light it up. Got it.\n> \n> **MOON:** Proceeding forward. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, with me.\n> \n> **MOON:** Control panel on the other side's got some bloody hand-prints on it. Looks like somebody tried to escape.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Fuck.\n> \n> **MOON:** Keep moving.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Up ahead!\n> \n> **MOON:** Put your fucking hands up! Are you human? Talk!\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled, distant)// Help...\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Is that a friendly?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Sounds hurt.\n> \n> **MOON:** Don't move. Control, looks like... about 15 yards up, a technician in a lab-coat. On his knees. S'got some blood on him, he might be hurt--\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Be careful.\n> \n> **MOON:** Approaching. Hey! Hey. Talk to me, man. We're here to get you out, but you need to talk to me.\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled)// Stop...\n> \n> **MOON:** Gonna need to give me more than that, buddy. Alright? Relax. Keep your hands up. Tell me your name. What's your name?\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(muffled)// Please, no...\n> \n> **MOON:** Oh. Oh, shit.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** What's going on? You alright?\n> \n> **MOON:** Stay where you are! Nobody fucking move, just... stay calm. Control?\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Come back.\n> \n> **MOON:** Control, I think this is one of the roaches.\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Wait. You said it was a lab technician--\n> \n> **MOON:** At a distance, it looked like -- look, its face is just, like... a chitin-mask. And it's...\n> \n> **CONTROL:** What is it doing?\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(distorted, muffled sobbing sounds)//\n> \n> **MOON:** I think... it looks like... it's begging?\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Down the hall!\n> \n> //(distant radio chirping sounds)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Shit -- two of them, //big// ones, they--\n> \n> //(distant, angry, garbled roaring sounds)//\n> \n> //(gunfire)//\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Fuck!\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Contact! Contact!\n> \n> **MOON:** Take cover!\n> \n> //(gunfire stops)//\n> \n> **WOLF 1:** Am I holding position?\n> \n> **MOON:** Yes, hold position -- everyone alright? Anyone hit?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Negative, I'm good.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** We both got cover.\n> \n> **MOON:** Fuck. //Fuck//. Since when do these things have--\n> \n> //(gunfire)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Fuck!\n> \n> //(gunfire continues)//\n> \n> **MOON:** ...what the hell?\n> \n> //(gunfire continues)//\n> \n> **MOON:** What the //hell//?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Are you alright, Moon?!\n> \n> **MOON:** Stay where you are. Stay where you are, both of you.\n> \n> //(gunfire continues)//\n> \n> **MOON:** //(laughing)// Well, now I've seen everything.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** What is it?\n> \n> **MOON:** Goddamn roaches.\n> \n> //(six more shots, distinctly louder and clearer)//\n> \n> //(gunfire ceases)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Hallway's clear.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** What just happened? \n> \n> **MOON:** They don't have guns. They've got gun-shaped hands. They were waving them around and making gunshot noises.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Are you... are you shitting me?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** That's fucking hilarious.\n> \n> **MOON:** You catch all that, Control? Please advise.\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Affirmative. Proceed with caution.\n> \n> **MOON:** Proceeding. Wolf 2, Wolf 3, on point.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Jesus. How the hell did these things compromise a site?\n> \n> **MOON:** Up ahead. You see that?\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Barricade. \n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Survivors?\n> \n> **MOON:** Could be. C'mon.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Supplies, looks like -- yeah, this looks recent, too. Managed to hold up a fort against the bugs.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Hey! -- look, is that --\n> \n> **MOON:** Hey! Hey, hands up, start talking--\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Fuck. She's running away--\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Is that a survivor? Or is it--\n> \n> **MOON:** Fucking... it's hard to tell in this light. She went into the bathroom. Wolf 2, with me. Wolf 3, take point on the entrance -- don't want to end up pinned inside there.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Copy.\n> \n> **MOON:** Let's take it easy, now...\n> \n> //(door opening)//\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Jesus.\n> \n> //(soft, muffled whimpering)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Hey. Hey, you there? We're humans. We're here to take you home. Just come out, hands up, okay...?\n> \n> //(whimpering grows more pronounced)//\n> \n> **MOON:** She's in the back stall, I think.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Moon, there's a body in this stall, over here--\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Hey! Hey, you! Hands up! Come over here -- we're the rescue team! We're -- shit!\n> \n> **MOON:** Wolf 3? What's going on?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Fuck. //Fuck//. I just saw -- somebody down the hall, on our side of the barricade. They saw me, then started running away--\n> \n> **MOON:** Human?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** I... I think so, yeah, I saw the face, it looked human, but they ran--\n> \n> **MOON:** Alright, let's finish in here, and--\n> \n> //(ear-piercing scream)//\n> \n> //(scuffling, shouts)//\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Fuck! Fuck!\n> \n> //(two gunshots)//\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Fucking... //FUCK!//\n> \n> **MOON:** Calm down. Calm down. Let me look at it.\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** It was... Jesus-fuck.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** You alright in there?\n> \n> **MOON:** Roach in the stall. Wolf 2 got stabbed, doesn't look critical. \n> \n> **WOLF 2:** You know this shit is going to get infected--\n> \n> **MOON:** Relax. We're getting out of here. Control, you copy?\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Come back.\n> \n> **MOON:** One of our team got stabbed. One of the roaches, it had... a knife-hand, or something. I'm pulling us out for now.\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Affirmative.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** What about -- I saw someone, back there--\n> \n> **MOON:** You saw another roach.\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** I'm pretty sure I saw--\n> \n> **MOON:** You saw another roach, Wolf 3. Do you understand?\n> \n> **MOON:** I said, do you understand?\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Affirmative.\n> \n> **MOON:** Alright. We're pulling out. C'mon, I'll help you up--\n> \n> //(scuffling sounds)//\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Christ.\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** Goddamn... roaches...\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** You catch that?\n> \n> **MOON:** Where's that coming from?\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(multiple, chanting)// Goddamn... roaches...\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Oh... oh, shit. Moon, get out here right now.\n> \n> //(door opening)//\n> \n> **MOON:** What -- holy shit.\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(over a dozen, chanting)// Goddamn... roaches...\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** They're just... claws and teeth--\n> \n> //(smashing sounds, objects rattling)//\n> \n> **WOLF 2:** Fuck! Fuck, they're slamming into the barricade--\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** What the fuck did they mimic?!\n> \n> **UNIDENTIFIED:** //(dozens more, chanting)// Goddamn... roaches...\n> \n> //(smashing sounds intensify)//\n> \n> **MOON:** Open fire! Open fire!\n> \n> //(gunfire)//\n> \n> **WOLF 3:** Shit! \n> \n> **MOON:** Throwing a grenade!

Do you copy? Moon, is that you? Moon!\n> \n> //(distant, garbled screams)//\n> \n> **WOLF 1:** That was -- it was Moon, I swear it was Moon, I saw his uniform, that had to have been... Moon! Moon! Come back! Moon!\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Wolf 1, come back. \n> \n> **WOLF 1:** Fucking... I can't -- there's -- Moon! \n> \n> //(gunshots)//\n> \n> **CONTROL:** Wolf 1, come back.
