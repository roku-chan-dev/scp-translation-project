When worn by a human subject, it will apply gentle pressure to the body, which has been reported as similar to receiving a hug or being comforted. SCP-7112 was originally discovered and confiscated during a raid on Madeline McElroy's apartment, a known Gamers Against Weed member. \n\nThe raid was authorized due to suspicion that McElroy was planning on releasing a memetic agent on [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-55|Site-55]]]'s personnel. Following interrogation, this suspicion was found to be false. However, SCP-7112 was found among her possessions and McElroy admitted to possessing minor knowledge of the anomalous. She was administered Class-B amnestics and all memory of her involvement with the anomalous was removed. Additionally, McElroy was permitted to return to the Gamers Against Weed chatroom after her laptop was outfitted with tracking software.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"lesbian_gengar has joined GAW Mod Talkzone!\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **GAW Mod Talkzone**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** fuck\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** fuck\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** fuck\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** fuck!\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** fuck me, man!\n\n**##black|bones:##** What's wrong, Esther?

She seemed normal to me when she talked in the lounge\n\n**###ff00ff|lesbian_gengar:##** they did their mind wipe bullshit on her.\n\n**##red|jockjamsvol6:##** What about the chatlogs? Doesn't she have access to those \n**##red|jockjamsvol6:##** ?\n\n**##green|bluntfiend:**## Its the Foundation, JJ.

You should not become entangled with anyone within it, or even outside. You may be difficult to access, but the others are not.\n**##black|bones:##** Your lives are already precarious.
