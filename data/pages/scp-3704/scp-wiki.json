This terminal operates via a randomly generated passphrase known only by one (1) Level 4 Personnel at a time. The case is to be stored in an isolated, soundproofed room, at least 15 meters away from any of the room’s walls. A circle with a radius of 2 meters is to be painted around the object, denoting the effective range of the --tertiary-- third primary effect. Microphones are placed about the room, which can broadcast into the observation room if researchers so choose.\n\nThe observation room is only accessible through the adjacent hallway, having no direct connection to SCP-3704's containment chamber. --Access to the containment chamber is restricted except for purposes of testing.-- After the results of Incident 3704-A, testing has been suspended until further notice.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3704 is a wooden music box measuring 16cm by 10cm by 16cm. The object has a coat of pink paint on it, chipped or damaged in several places, revealing the wood underneath. The wood has a reddish tint, and does not match any known species of tree. The composition of the wood is extremely dense, making the object heavier than it appears. In addition, it is significantly stronger than normal wood of similar dimensions. Despite this, the object is damaged in multiple locations, with parts of the casing appearing crushed. The crank is also broken off, though it can still be turned if force is applied to the remaining end. Inspections have shown that the internals are consistent with similar music boxes, showing no anomalous effects.\n\nMusic can be heard from SCP-3704 at random intervals whether or not the crank is turned. The songs it plays vary between subjects, with different subjects reporting varying genres, usually in line with the subject’s tastes. This effect is demonstrated even in subjects listening at the same time. \n\nAfter 30 seconds of exposure to the music, subjects will feel a compulsion to move closer to the object. After 3 minutes of exposure, this draw slowly becomes stronger, reaching its height after 5 minutes. At the effect's height, subjects become largely unable to resist the urge to move closer, and use any means necessary to do so. See Testing Log 3704.1 for details. A subject in this state that is rendered unable to hear SCP-3704-2’s music will fall unconscious for a period of 30 minutes to an hour. Upon waking, subjects will have no memory of their time under the object’s influence.\n\nWhen a subject comes within 15 meters of SCP-3704 they begin to hear whispers interspersed in the music that grow louder the closer they get to the object. Subjects report that the voices are from people that they recognize, usually deceased family members, acquaintances, or celebrities. These voices tend to be from people that the subject looked up to, or trusted.\n\nIn most cases, subjects say that the voices are consoling them, and in all cases telling them to approach the object. See **Testing Log 3704-1** for details.\n\nWhen a subject comes within 2 meters of SCP-3704 and has been exposed longer than 5 minutes, a tertiary effect appears. Subjects become convinced that the people the voices belong to are trapped inside the object. Subjects will attempt to break open SCP-3704 in an attempt to free them, and will attack anything that prevents them from performing this act. If a subject is forcibly removed from the 2 meter effective range, they lose the urge to free the voices.\n\n**Testing Log 3704-1:**\nBelow are a series of tests conducted upon SCP-3704 with the intent of learning more about how the object selects music for each subject, and what the voices produced by the object say to subjects.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test 1\" hide=\"- Hide Content\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n> **Test 1**\n> **Date:** 04/06/2017\n> **Overseeing Researcher:** Dr. Caleb Solys\n> **Subject:** D-3704-1\n> **Purpose:** To ascertain what the voices produced by SCP-3704 say to subjects.\n> **Procedure:** D-3704-1 was brought into the containment chamber, then locked inside.

Why is it playing //Back in Black//?\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** I'm not sure. Do you listen to it often?\n> \n> **D-3704-1:** Not really. It was my uncle's favorite song.

My uncle died in a car accident around this time last year. Why am I suddenly hearing his voice?\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** That is one of the things we are trying to determine. Is he saying anything else?\n> \n> **D-3704-1:** No, not really. He’s just kind of repeating that it’s going to be okay and that I should come closer.

Is this in line with what you would normally listen to?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** Not really, but my mother used to play it when I was little; it was her favorite song. She was a world-class pianist. I always loved to hear her play. It was soothing.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** Is that so? You said ‘was’. Is your mother still alive?\n> \n> (//Test time exceeds 30 seconds.//)\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** No, she passed away in 2013. \n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** Ah, I’m sorry.\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** Don’t be.

It almost sounds like voices.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** Can you make out what they’re saying?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** Uh...kinda? I think they’re telling me to come closer. Is that not good? Is that why I’m restrained?\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** In part, yes. Can you identify the voices?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** There’s one that’s louder than the rest. It almost sounds like...oh Jesus. Mom…? Is that you?\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** Is she responding?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** No, at least I don’t think so. She’s just telling me not to worry and to come closer.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** D-3704-2, how did your mother die?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** Breast cancer.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** I see.

I just kinda get the feeling she just wants to talk to me.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** What makes you say that?\n> \n> **D-3704-2:** I don’t know. She's sounds like she’s...pleading.

I...I tried to drive our family car, and crashed it of course. Mom, she tried to save me and broke her arm because of it. She’s telling me it’s okay. That I’m forgiven. Absolved.

Damn, it took me getting locked up to get popular.\n> \n> **Dr. Solys:** (//Sighs in irritation.//) Can you identify the new voices?\n> \n> **D-3704-7:** Zero ideas here. The only thing I can say for sure is that they’re all different kinds. It’s not like all guys or all girls or all old or whatever.

The object has a coat of pink paint on it, chipped or damaged in several places, revealing the wood underneath. The wood has a reddish tint, and does not match any known species of tree. The composition of the wood is extremely dense, making the object heavier than it appears. In addition, it is significantly stronger than normal wood of similar dimensions. Despite this, the object is damaged in multiple locations, with parts of the casing appearing crushed. The crank is also broken off, though it can still be turned if force is applied to the remaining end. Inspections have shown that the internals are consistent with similar music boxes, showing no anomalous effects.\n\nSCP-3704 draws on the empathy of its listeners. It has 3 primary anomalous effects that draw emotions out of subjects, good or bad, in an attempt to bring them closer to it. A fourth effect manifests once a subject has become sufficiently close.\n\nThe first of the two primary effects is that music can be heard from SCP-3704 at random intervals whether or not the crank is turned. The songs it plays vary between subjects, even playing different songs to two subjects listening at the same time. SCP-3704 tends to play songs that subjects have a connection to, usually by drawing on memories that evoke a strong emotional reaction to.\n\nThe second primary effect is that starting at a range of 15 meters, subjects hear voices interspersed in the music. These voices typically take the form of people the subjects knows, looks up to, or trusts, with one exception. SCP-3704 has the ability to seemingly sense if an empathic connection has been formed with the subject. In cases where an empathic connection has been formed, the voices attempt to console subjects, usually speaking of forgiveness or absolution. In cases where an empathic connection has not been formed, the voices take other forms of people the subject has wronged, or feels contempt towards. The voices in these cases speak not of forgiveness, but of debts, as if subject owes it to them to move closer.\n\nThe condition of the third primary effect is unknown due to insufficient testing. The current theory for the condition is that it manifests if subjects resist the call to move closer to the object for an extended period of time. Subjects under this third effect seem to undergo immense pain, and yet appear to have their senses dulled. Subjects also seem to be granted strength and dexterity above what a normal human can possess. The full extent of the effect is, like the condition, unknown. See **Incident 3704-A** for an example of this effect.\n\nThe fourth effect of SCP-3704 appears once subjects have come within 2 meters of it. Subjects in this range become convinced that the voices are trapped inside SCP-3704, and as such become heavily compelled to \"free\" them by destroying the object. Subjects will attack anyone else who enters the 2 meter range, believing them to be preventing the liberation of the voices. Subjects who are rendered unable to hear SCP-3704's music, either by removal from the effective range or artificial deafening, fall unconscious for a period of 30 minutes to an hour. Upon waking, subjects will have no memory of their time affected by SCP-3704.\n\n**Addendum 3704-1:**\nFollowing the containment breach on 04/23/2017 resulting in ██ staff casualties, all testing on SCP-3704 has been suspended until further notice. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Messages to and from Site Command between 04/29/2017 and 04/31/2017\" hide=\"- Hide Content\"]]\n> **Message to Site Command from Dr. Caleb Solys on 04/29/2017**\n> \n> I am hereby requesting reinstatement of testing on SCP-3704. The last test caused a containment breach, but that only further enforces the need to understand this thing. That subject broke out of his restrains and killed a security team with his bare hands. During the test, numerous things were out of place. The timings were all wrong, everything we thought we knew about it were thrown out the window. SCP-3704 could have any number of anomalous properties we don't know about, or the current ones could be stronger. We. Don't. Know. It's dangerous. I'm firm in the belief that we need to learn more. We need to know what it actually does.\n\n> **Response from Site Command on 04/31/2017** \n> \n> [http://www.scp-wiki.net/solace Request Denied.]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3703]]] | SCP-3704 | [[[SCP-3705]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
