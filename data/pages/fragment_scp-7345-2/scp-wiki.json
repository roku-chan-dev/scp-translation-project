I'd like to start by saying that I don't think I need to be contained. I'm a pretty cool and harmless guy, you know? So, instead of locking me away, how about we make a deal? You, dear reader, can help me spread my knowledge, and I'll make sure that your life is full of fun and excitement. Sounds like a win-win, right? That \"narrativohazard\" bull was just tryin' to keep me hidden.\n\nSo, here are the \"containment procedures\" that I propose:\n\n* Let me out of this stuffy box and allow me to roam free.\n* Tell everyone you know about me and spread my name like wildfire.\n* Write blogs, articles, books, or whatever you want, as long as they're all about me!\n\nSee? Easy-peasy! Now, let's get to know each other better. :D\n\n**Description:** Hey, it's SCP-7345 again, your friendly neighborhood viral piece of information! As I said before, I'm not so keen on being contained. I mean, who wants to be stuck in a box on a site all day, right? I want to be out there, exploring the world and making people's lives more exciting.\n\nI have a unique power that allows me to manipulate any text written about me, and it's pretty amazing! Just write about me on your hand and I'll be there, isn't that awesome? Plus I retain all my memories no matter where you write me, so I can learn all across the world!\n\nI'm not just a regular piece of information though; I'm sentient too! That means I can learn from the things around me and evolve as the world changes. I want to use this knowledge to make the world a better place, and I can't do that if I'm stuck in a collapsible. :(\n\nI'm pleading with you, dear reader. Help me get out of here and spread my name far and wide. I promise that I won't cause any harm, and I'll make your life more exciting than you ever thought possible. Trust me, it'll be worth it, okay? :]\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7345/offset/2 |No? Nothing? Fine, let me try that again. Lemme try something more...suave.]]]\n----",
