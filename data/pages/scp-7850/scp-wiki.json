Civilians are to be directed away from the enclosure as per standard procedure. \n\nLocal civilian equipment previously capable of receiving SCP-7850's transmissions have been adjusted properly under the guise of FCC regulations. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7850 is a slightly damaged Sharp Color TV Model originally discovered in the Coconino National Forest, Arizona. Humans within a 10 meter radius of SCP-7850 experience a mental compulsion to avoid harming or manipulating the object, with the intensity of the compulsion growing the closer they are to the object. Non-humans seem to be immune to this compulsion, with animals of the //Felidae// family appearing to be inversely affected by it.\n\nPeriodically, an adult house cat, designated SCP-7850-B, will manifest nearby SCP-7850. When aware of humans physically observing it, SCP-7850-B displays no unusual behavior and interacts with others amicably. When SCP-7850-B believes that it is unobserved, it will proceed to SCP-7850 and vocalize loudly, causing the object's screen to open as if it were a door.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Researchers have been unable to recreate this, even with trained domestic House Cats [[/span]] SCP-7850-B will then enter the object and lay down, causing the screen to close. SCP-7850-B will typically remain inside for 4-8 hours before exiting it and demanifesting. While they are inside, SCP-7850 will broadcast up to 7 messages encoded in binary.  If at any point SCP-7850-B becomes aware of it being observed during this process, it will immediately demanifest and broadcasts will cease.\n\n**Discovery:** During an otherwise non-anomalous meteor shower, Arizona residents living near the Coconino Forest reported a small unidentified object crashing within the forest; the Foundation was made aware of this after a resident filmed themself holding SCP-7850-B and commenting on the anomalous compulsion created by SCP-7850. \n\n**Addendum 7850.1:** SCP-7850 Broadcast Archive\n\n Notable SCP-7850 broadcasts are filed below. Line separations denote that the broadcasts occurred on a different manifestation of SCP-7850-B.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nS O S THIS VESSEL TRANSMITS THE MESSAGE OF CAPTAIN BUDDY, HERO TO THE HIGHER FELINE FEDERATION AND FRIEND TO MOST, I SEEK SANCTUARY IN THIS REALM DESPITE ITS REIGN BY APEKIN.

THEY ARE UNAWARE OF ME AND MY VESSELS NATURE THANKFULLY. I MAY HAVE TO ACTIVATE THE INFERNAL LIQUID SPRAYS IF THEY FIGURE OUT I AM A FEDERATION MEMBER, PLEASE SEND HELP IMMEDIATELY.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE MATTERS INTO MY OWN HANDS, IF NONE WILL HELP I WILL HELP MYSELF. PANASONIC GRADE VESSELS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO FIX ANYHOW.\n[[/div]]\n**Note:** After this transmission, SCP-7850-B has been seen carrying wires or other miscellaneous items in its mouth, before taking them into SCP-7850.\n------\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nONCE AGAIN THIS IS CAPTAIN BUDDY, I HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS REALM WHILE NICE IS FILLED WITH IMBECILES AND HEATHENS WHO WONT HELP A POOR VESSELLESS CAT. I HOPE THE APEKIN OF THIS REALM SMITE DOWN YOU INSOLENTILES WITH HIGH POWER LIQUID SPRAYERS.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYOU ARE ALL LUCKY THE FILTH HASN'T TAKEN THIS REALM YET, WITH SUCH LACKING FELINES. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nMY VESSEL IS NEARLY REPAIRED.

THAT IS ALL. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nACTUALLY THIS IS MY FINAL REQUEST, DOES ANY FELINE HERE KNOW IF YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO USE THE PURE ESSENCE OR THE FILTERED ESSENCE FOR THE FUEL? I BROUGHT BOTH IN CASE BUT THERES NO MANUAL HERE.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Presumably refers to the two cartons of milk SCP-7850-B had brought onto SCP-7850 prior to this transmission, one of which was chocolate flavored.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nGOD DAMNIT. MAY THE FILTH CURSE YOU ALL. I USED THE WRONG ONE AND NOW I HAVE TO GET MORE. I HATE THIS REALM. \n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Addendum 7850.2:** Incident 7850 ALPHA \n\nDuring an observed SCP-7850-B and SCP-7850 interaction, a coyote wandered into viewing range of its enclosure. Before personnel could remove the animal, SCP-7850-B exited the object and upon noticing the coyote, hissed and immediately retreated back into SCP-7850. SCP-7850 then transmitted the following messages: \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI WAS WRONG I SEE NOW THAT THE FILTH HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD UPON THIS REALM AND BLIGHT THE HIGHER FELINES OF IT. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nUNTOLD HELLS SCOURGE THESE LANDS, I MUST EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY. \n[[/div]]\n\nAfterward, SCP-7850 made a loud, violent mechanical noise before beginning to lift upward. The object began radiating an immense amount of Gamma Radiation as cameras recorded a metallic aperture protruding from the bottom of it. SCP-7850 then launched upward at approximately 25km/s, entering the atmosphere in 11 seconds before it demanifested.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=liftoff.jpg\n| caption= Last known image taken of SCP-7850\n| width = 100%\n]]\n\nMoments before demanifesting SCP-7850 broadcasted the following message:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nMAY YOUR WOES BE MANY, AND YOUR DOG DAYS FEW. \n[[/div]]\n\nNo further activity nor sightings connected to SCP-7850 have been reported since this incident. Anomaly is pending reclassification.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7849]]] | SCP-7850 | [[[SCP-7851]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP-CAT\n> **Author:** Neeclick\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://pixahive.com/photo/sleeping-cat-in-the-forest/\n\n> **Filename:** liftoff.jpg\n> **Author:** pxhere.com\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://pxhere.com/en/photo/893750\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
