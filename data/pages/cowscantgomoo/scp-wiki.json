The alleyways feel quiet and hollow in the dead of night. The light reflects off the stars, the traffic of interstellar travel only adding to the neon lights that paint the streets. You walk, shivering, dazed, and confused. You have no idea where you are, no idea how you got there, and no one to turn to. The wind sends shivers down your spine, your body fighting against the freezing temperatures with only a tattered shirt and ripped pants to protect you. You're on 15th Street. That's all you really know.\n\n\nA singular warehouse calls your name. It's the only building shrouded in darkness, which grabs your attention amidst the flashing lights and signs. It's demanding you towards it, it's allure irresistible. Its rusty exterior shakes with every beckon.\n\nThe dark brown garage doors facing the street were welded shut, the metal fused with the concrete. The smell reminds you of licking the ends of cable adapters. The memory is warm, providing a dark contrast to the call of the warehouse. The smell of hot chocolate fills your nose. The warm, yellow glow of incandescent lights provides relief to the glaring neon blue lights. A soft piano replaces the droning call of the warehouse, and you feel so warm, so fuzzy like you could just sit here and-\n\nNo, that's hypothermia. Keep moving.\n\nCircling around the warehouse, a side door sits atop two steps covered in ice. The dim porchlight buzzes quietly. A sign is posted on the door.\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ **!!!

Every fiber of your being should be telling you to leave, to roam the streets, uncertain of your fate, but your curiosity compels you.\n\nNo, it's more than that. It's the warehouse. It's hiding something //for// you. It's stood here, against the cold, against the test of time, for you. The doorknob turns. You don't know if it was you or not, but it doesn't matter.\n\nThe warehouse is damp, its rafters dripping with warm water, probably packed with bacteria and cholera. A large droplet lands on your hand. Disgusting. You go to shake it off when the color surprises you. It's white. You smell it, hoping to distract yourself from having to venture deeper into the warehouse. It's milk. You look up. It's all milk. Warm, delicious milk.\n\nThe door closes behind you, but you don't care. You found something of meaning, something of noteworthy significance. You drink it from your hands, unable to compose yourself. It warms your body and soul, as any glass of it would.\n\nAt the center of the room, a cow stands motionless. Its body is illuminated by the light of the full moon, a spotlight in the dark milk cave you found yourself in. The cow stares at you, //directly// at you. Its white fur radiates a heavenly presence, whether it came from itself or the light of the moon was a mystery. Milk continued to drip down from the ceiling, solidifying this moment into your mind as pure perfection.\n\nAnd then the cow spoke. It should have spoken words of wisdom, an explanation for all there is, but it didn't.\nIt opened its mouth and unleashed something far, far worse.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[[SCP-7693|It did something it can't.]]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"And then the cow spoke.\" hide=\"\"Moo.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"anom-bar-esoteric\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= cow\n|clearance= 6\n|container-class= apollyon\n|secondary-class= dairy\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/cowscantgomoo/milk-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= ga-lactic\n|risk-class=martzu\n]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n@@ @@\n[[<]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++++ **[[[SCP-7315]]]** - //Earworms and Workaholics//\n\n[[>]]\n//Uploaded 12 Mar 2023//\n[[/>]]\n------\n\"it's depressing that a majority of people will never know actual good music\"\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++++ **[[[SCP-7215]]]** - //I'm Scheduled To Be Sick That Day//\n[[>]]\n //Uploaded 28 Mar 2023//\n[[/>]]\n------\n\"Following this discovery, a rumor spread across Site-115, suggesting that the lack of calendar days on SCP-7215 implied a potential ZK-Class \"End of Time\" Scenario.\"\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++++ **[[[SCP-7152]]]** - //Water to Wine//\n[[>]]\n //Uploaded 14 May 2023//\n[[/>]]\n------\n\"And I wish that I had drowned.\"\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++++ **[[[SCP-7415]]]** - //The Quintessential High School Experience//\n[[>]]\n //Uploaded 24 May 2023//\n[[/>]]\n------\n\"I just want to bask in the sun for just a little while longer.\"\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++++ **[[[SCP-6438]]]** - //So...
