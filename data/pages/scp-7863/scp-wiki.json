SCP-7863 was previously a Senior Researcher prior to incident 41-003-05, it is to remain unnamed to preserve the secrecy of the anomaly. However, it has voluntarily contained itself within a 5m x 5m x 5m humanoid containment cell within the Armed Biological Containment facility Area-41 originally designed for the anomaly by Director Daniel Molloch. It has been assigned the secondary classification of Ticonderoga because of its loyalty. However, due to its dangerous potential and the requirements that would be needed to contain SCP-7863 if its secondary classification was revoked, it has been assigned Keter.\n\n\nAlthough SCP-7863 has voluntarily contained itself, it is allowed free access to Area-41 where it has sufficient clearance. It also has the limited freedom to leave the facility on a case-by-case basis, however only in its human form, referred to as -A, as not all staff are aware of its SCP designation. If a facility-wide containment breach occurs, SCP-7863 is to be locked within its containment cell until extraction by Facility Guard personnel or MTF Zeta-13 can occur, once this happens SCP-7863 is to be transported to Site-██ until safe relocation to Outpost-41-01 can be secured. All testing of SCP-7863 is to be done by Site Director Daniel Molloch and Senior Researcher Doctor Adriana Bevan, including any research staff authorized by either Director Molloch or the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Revision\n[[/=]]\nSCP-7863 has had a device surgically implanted into it to allow the O5 council to subdue SCP-7863 whilst in form-A via high-voltage electric shock. If off-site, SCP-7863 is to have its location and vitals monitored from Area-41. If vitals monitoring shows a rapid rise in the concentration of blood within SCP-7863 reaching 200%, Zeta-13 is to be sent to contain SCP-7863 immediately with any force required as well as inform and contact a member of the O5 council, if forcing SCP-7863 into compliance fails then severe maiming up to termination is authorized by the O5 council. If any members of hostile groups of interest are identified to be located within a 5-kilometer radius of SCP-7863, it is to be discreetly relocated to Area-41 immediately by MTF Agents even if said groups of interest are not aware of the existence of SCP-7863. See Addendums for the Audio log between Director Molloch and O5-█ that led to the revision.\n\n[[=]]\n##transparent|Molloch is not the only creation in the facility. We know who you are now.##\n[[/=]]\n\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+ Description\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nSCP-7863 is identified to have 2 physical forms which it can switch between at will, designated SCP-7863-A and SCP-7863-B, or -A and -B for short. -A resembles a 1.8-meter-tall Caucasian male with light brown hair and light grey eyes in his mid-30s. In this form, SCP-7863 is indistinguishable from any other human being, not showing any of the anomalous abilities that it displays as -B. However, as SCP-7863 begins transformation into -B, vital signs begin to erratically change, these changes seemingly have shown little to no consistency excluding the fact that blood concentration of SCP-7863 will increase at a rapid rate until reaching upwards of 200% of regular human levels.\n\n\n\nSCP-7863’s anomalous traits manifest upon its transformation into form -B. SCP-7863-B stands at around 4.2 meters tall, during transformation its skin is rapidly replaced by muscle tissue alongside its bones which break through the muscle tissue forming a partial exoskeleton. A pair of wings rip out from its back resembling those of Desmodus rotundus however at a much larger scale, boasting a 4-meter wingspan as well as a 2-meter-long muscular tail. Its arms are approximate in shape and structure to the limbs of Ursus arctos horribilis with claws elongated in proportion to the rest of its body. Its legs are similar to a more muscular form of Rangifer tarandus, with its head being the skull of the same animal but the jaws of the SCP are of Canis lupus. In the transition to this form from -A, SCP-7863 has stated a feeling of immense pain due to being able to acutely feel every physical change happening to his body.\n\n\n\nSCP-7863’s anomalous traits and abilities are varied and only show whilst as -B. It can speak without the need for proper vocal cords; alongside having no nose, eyes, or ears it still can smell, see, and hear as if it had these sensory organs. It can manipulate the blood of other organisms, seemingly able to control the flow, movement, and volume of blood as if it has become an extension of itself. SCP-7863 can control blood in a radius of approximately 50 meters around itself predicated on the fact that it is aware of the organism’s presence, during testing SCP-7863 stated that it doesn’t know how or why it can control the blood. Another of its abilities discovered through testing is that it disrupts reality in a localized area, if SCP-7863 remains as -B for too long, time begins to alter in a as of yet unpredictable and ever-changing way. The most extreme example of this temporal effect to date was the extension of 10 seconds into 23 hours and 12 minutes within the affected area. The area's physical topography also began to change, changing into bone, blood, and muscle and seemingly becoming an extension of SCP-7863, this effect however does degrade over time back to normal once SCP-7863 returned to -A. The maximum radius of this reality disruption is unknown as it seems to grow over time, the largest radius known under testing was 213 meters. The final anomalous ability that SCP-7863 has shown is that during several events it has been able to accurately predict a handful of yet-to-be-known anomalies and previously undiscovered properties of known anomalies. As SCP-7863 has stated that it is unaware of how it has predicted anything about these anomalies, the O5 council has approved ongoing research to learn how this ability works.\n[[=]]\n##transparent|Tell them about your dreams, we know you have them, we know you see our king.##\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+ Addendum\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Audio Log Transcript**\n\n**The Following is the Audio Transcript from a meeting between Site Director Daniel Molloch and O5-█**\n\n**Date:** 3/6/20██\n\n**Subject:** SCP-7863 Termination Request\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n**O5-█:** This log will be on the record Director due to the serious nature of the request relating to a valuable SCP. I have received your request to terminate SCP-7863 for it is too great of a risk, Director you know that I am not going to accept your request. Your obsessive, disdain, for this SCP in particular, is worrying.\n\n\n**Site Director Molloch:** Sir my worry about this SCP is not obsessive, after the tests you had me conduct I don't see any justification to allow SCP-7863 to remain alive. If it ever turns against the Foundation it will inevitably bring death and destruction. I cannot abide by that.\n\n\n**O5-█:** Your experiments have revealed a great deal about its abilities, however, the Council feels there is still more to learn from SCP-7863 as well as its continual aid being invaluable to the Foundation, you know that more than anyone. There is no reason to believe it would turn on us and unless you have any evidence to the contrary I declare this matter closed Director.\n\n\n**Site Director Molloch:** No. I do not. But we understand little of its origins, only theories from what the SCP has… seen. This dubious origin alongside the special attention that Interest Group 586 has shown is what makes me believe it's a threat.\n\n\n**O5-█:** Then I suggest you focus your resources on studying SCP-7863's origin, rather than its abilities if it worries you so Director. Your experience in studying and containing SCP-7863 is unmatched and I wouldn't want to have to replace you, you are valuable to the Foundation. And as for the Children of the Scarlet King, that is why I have assigned Zeta-13 to your facility.  Daniel, what is the real reason you want the termination?\n\n\n**Site Director Molloch:** Like I said I think the SCP is a danger to the foundation, the value doesn't outweigh the risks.\n\n\n**O5-█:** Sighs Unfortunately you cannot decide that, I believe Dr. Webber is assigned to Area-41 Daniel, I recommend you take a visit. The termination request is categorically denied.\n\n\n**Site Director Molloch:** If I cannot terminate it, then I request a revision to SCP-7863 containment procedure, to ensure SCP-7863is secured from the Interest Group and to guarantee that if it turns on the  Foundation, immediate termination is authorized. \n\n\n**O5-█:** Submit a detailed revision Director, I will have a Ethics Committee Liaison go over it to ensure it is suitable. And before you go, Director, I'd like a report on incident  ███-41-19-01-12, your contact with the Children of the Scarlet King is important and I expect it before your revision.\n\n\n**Site Director:** I will have it done when I get back to the facility, thank you, sir.\n\n\n**O5-█:** One last thing Director, the Council had a vote to redact ████ ██████████ from the file, that information has been designated as requiring level 6 clearance now. \n\n\n[END LOG]\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n##transparent|You remember us from that January, tell us what happened in 1997 Molloch.##\n[[/=]]\n**Addendum-7863-01:** After incidents 41-███-02 and ███-41-19-01-12, Site Director Daniel Molloch corroborated the events recorded in his personal account and the accounts of survivors in their respective events. Due to this security breach Site Director Molloch has pushed for new preventative measures with provisionary changes approved by O5-█ with the broader proposals being currently under consideration. With the reports of these incidents, Interest Group 586 is now considered a high-level risk to the security of SCP-7863 and Area-41. Zeta-13 has been authorized to terminate any members or suspected members on sight. Foundation operatives implanted in various groups of interest have been tasked with reporting their given group’s knowledge on SCP-7863, if any. Upon the unlikely capture of a member of the Children of the Scarlet King, they are to be interrogated on the subject of SCP-7863 and then terminated.\n\n\n\n**Addendum-7863-02:** After his submission of Incident report ███-41-19-01-12, Director Molloch has assigned Head Researcher, Doctor Bevan to begin research into the origin of SCP-7863’s anomalous traits. Incident Report Incident 41-003-05 explains the date of this event, however, SCP-7863 has provided no insight into the cause of its transformation nor does any document seized from the Children of the Scarlet King. For this Director Molloch has approved the Clearance Level 5 report to be given to Dr Bevan once released. As Dr Bevan focuses on the anomaly’s origin, Director Molloch has begun to conduct further research into SCP-7863’s abilities hoping to find a link between its anomalous traits and its yet indeterminable origin.\n\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n##transparent|There is someone in the facility with you, there wasn't only one traitor in 2011, see you soon.##\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show Incident Report ███-41-19-01-12\n| hide=- Hide Incident Report ███-41-19-01-12\n]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ Incident Report ███-41-19-01-12\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Date:**19/01/12\n\n**Location:**Alpine Mountain Range\n\n**Personnel involved:**  18 MTF-Zeta 13 Personnel\n\n**SCPs involved:** SCP-7863\n\n**Pretext:** MTF-Zeta 13 was SCP-7863 to Area-41 after being temporarily relocated to Site-██ due to a containment breach a few months prior. The transport to Area-41 was by two UH-60 Black Hawks each containing 7 Zeta-13 personnel alongside a pilot and co-pilot. The Incident report is divided by the events of the incident.\n-----\n**9:20 - 9:23 am:** The Black Hawk transports were passing over the Alps near the Swiss-Austrian border as Black Hawk One was shot by an explosion round, likely from a MANPADS, this round hit the cockpit. Approximately 10 seconds later a second round hits the tail of Black Hawk Two, sending the Black Hawk spiraling into the mountainside. After the collision, the deaths of 3 Zeta-13 agents and the pilot, amongst the survivors of the crash were SCP-7863, Z13-9, Z13-10, Z13-11, Z13-13, and Z13-16, who were the co-pilot. The survivors of the crash would begin to travel east due to a lack of signal for long-range communication.\n\n**9:57 - 10:17 am:** The survivors of the crash came into contact with hostile forces fighting in guerrilla-style combat. During the 20-minute engagement, the survivors found themselves stuck on the mountainside, Z13-10 and Z13-16 were lightly injured with 3 of the 7 hostiles being terminated. Hostiles fled from the engagement as the survivors regrouped themselves and began to travel northeast up the mountain slope seeing a cave entrance in hopes of being able to receive enough signal to request an extraction to deliver SCP-7863 to Area-41. As this happened, Z13-9 checked the bodies of 2 of the terminated hostiles learning they were from Interest Group 586, otherwise known as Children of the Scarlet King.\n\n**10:20 am:** Z13-11 managed to get a signal to request extraction from their GPS location whilst Z13-10 and Z13-16 were patched up, both of which were in stable condition. MTF Zeta-13 received the message from the survivors and would send several squads of MTF to extract the survivors and terminate any encounter with hostiles.\n\n**10:30 - 10:32 am:** Z13-9 spotted hostiles approaching the cave entrance and opened fire, alerting the others to the presence of the hostiles. In the short firefight, Z13-9 was shot in the head, killing him immediately, this caused the survivors to go deeper into the caves in hopes of ambushing the hostiles. Z13-10, Z13-11, and SCP-7863 ended up fleeing in another direction to Z13-13 and Z13-16.\n\n**10:42 - 10:52 am:** Z13-11, Z13-10, and SCP-7863 were the group solely hunted by the hostiles into the cave system. They ambushed several hostiles as they split up to search for them. In these ten minutes, the reports of the 3 suggested they terminated 7 hostiles.\n\n**10:47 am:** Z13-13 and Z13-16 concluded that either the hostiles had not entered the cave system or chased the group that SCP-7863 was with. The two began to go back to find the other group in case the Children of the Scarlet King were hunting SCP-7863.\n\n**11:01 - 11:09 am:** 8 hostiles located the three survivors who were cornered at a dead end of the cave system. In the firefight Z13-11 was shot in the leg whilst running to cover causing them to fall and collide into a boulder, knocking him out immediately. Z13-10 would be shot and killed during this firefight after throwing a fragmentation grenade. Before his death, Z13-10 killed 3 of the 8 hostiles. SCP-7863 uses Z13-10's gun to defend himself as Z13-13 and 13-16 locate SCP-7863 and terminate the last hostiles. Z13-13, Z13-16, and SCP-7863 carried the unconscious Z13-11 back to the open of the cave as Zeta-13 was arriving shortly.\n\n**11:32 am:** Black Hawks sent by MTF Zeta-13 arrive at the location and extract SCP-7863, Z13-11, Z13-13, and Z13-16 and returned them to Area-41 where SCP-7863 would be confirmed to have contained itself within its containment cell at 01:14 pm. \n\n**11:30 am - 12:30 pm:** MTF Zeta-13 scoured the mountains for any members of the Children of the Scarlet King and retrieved the bodies of dead foundation and cult members as clean up prepared to remove the destroyed Black Hawks. During this, it was confirmed that the cult was members of the Children of the Scarlet King however they were of an unknown sect. Upon locating Black Hawk One, Z13-1, Z13-2, and Z13-5 were the only members found alive.\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/djkaktus-s-proposal/amber.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ The following is an audio log by Site Director Daniel Molloch, those without clearance given by the O5 Council or Director Molloch before accessing this file will be terminated. \n| hide=- Hide audio log.\n]]\n-----\n**Audio Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:**17/6/20██\n\n**Subject:** Incident Report ███-41-19-01-12\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n**Director Molloch:** This log is to address some inaccuracies in the official report for the O5 Council, as requested 11 days ago  I have submitted the official report of the incident however as per the containment procedures I have set up, I have kept my identity removed as well as altering the events of 11:01 am.\n\n//Director Molloch sighed and paused, tapping a pen on a desk.//\n\n**Director Molloch:** After the death of Agent Ackehurst as well as Agent Irving losing consciousness, the other two were not the ones to kill the cultist. To ensure they could not capture me, I turned into the other form. The cultist froze and began to pray. They thought I was a creation of their god and wanted me to go with them. I terminated them. \n\n//Director Molloch paused again with only the pen tapping could be heard.//\n\n**Director Molloch:** We don't know if they knew our route back to Area-41 or if it was by chance and due to having no one to question, I recommend we assume the worse. As I know my termination request is denied, I hope you approve my request to increase the containment restrictions, I also request additional funding for the Cult Divisions of Area-41 to learn more about this unidentified sect of the cult. Apart from that I believe that concludes this audio log as the rest of the report is accurate.\n\n\n\n[END LOG]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n \n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-7862]]] | SCP-7863| [[[SCP-7864]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]",
