Copies of all records marked as being at significant risk of retroactive alteration are to be stored at SCP-3936. Any repairs required by the systems of SCP-3936 are to be performed by an on-site team of engineers.\n\nAll public activity outside of SCP-3936 is to be logged by personnel stationed there.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3936 is Exclusionary Site-01, a Foundation installation constructed using a macro-version of the technology utilized by the Scranton Box, commonly used to store sensitive documents and protect them from retroactive alterations. Via the use of this technology, SCP-3936 is a Site effectively immune to the effects of potential CK-Class restructuring events.\n\nSCP-3936 is currently capable of housing one hundred members of personnel. Monitoring equipment within SCP-3936 allows personnel to perform observation on events in the outside world through streams of media and secure government communications. This information is then backed up within SCP-3936's digital archive, along with any information deemed by the Foundation to be at significant risk of retroactive alteration.\n\nSCP-3936 is currently --active-- inactive.\n\n**Addendum 3936-1:** On 01/12/18/04, SCP-3936 failed to broadcast its monthly confirmation signal. Mobile Task Force Qeztel-12 (\"Now You See Me\") was dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, MTF Qeztel-12 reported an absence of any Foundation personnel. All records contained in SCP-3936 had also been deleted. However, a large number of non-humanoid corpses were located within the cafeteria of SCP-3936, analysis of which suggested their deaths were caused by ingestion of cyanide pills. \n\nThe highly irregular features of these corpses include:\n\n* A roughly star-shaped bodily structure.\n* Two primary limbs, presumably used for object manipulation.\n* Two secondary limbs, presumably used for ambulation.\n* A control node located above a torso-like structure. No signs of secondary or tertiary control nodes were found.\n* A cardiovascular system focused around a single organ, rather than the triumvirate organ system possessed by nearly all known organisms.\n* A small muscle present within what is presumed to be the organism's cavities, which evidence suggests could be controlled freely.\n* A taste described as similar to that of physical pork.\n* A severe lack of verifiable metareceptors.\n* Eyes, which have previously only been recorded in fossils of the //Korenvatius// genus.\n\nAutopsy and further inspection of these corpses is ongoing. \n\nFurther investigation revealed only a single piece of information remaining in SCP-3936's archives, a message from an individual identified as Doctor Ezekiel T. Jones. No individual under this name is recorded as having worked for the Foundation. The message reads:\n\n> We'll handle containment ourselves, thanks. There's no need for you to know this.\n\nThe location of the personnel originally assigned to SCP-3936 is currently unknown.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3935]]] | SCP-3936 | [[[SCP-3937]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
