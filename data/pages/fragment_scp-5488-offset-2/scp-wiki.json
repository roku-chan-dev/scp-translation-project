The lock combination must be changed every two weeks. Interaction is restricted to Clearance Level-2 and above. ##blue|All media affected by SCP-5488 must be reported to Dr. Nicholas Cann or Dr. Helen Dray immediately.##\n\n##blue|As of Incident 5488-1, images of SCP-5488 are not to be uploaded to any electronic device. Any device found to contain such images must be immediately disconnected from all networks, quarantined, and reset to factory specifications.##\n\n##blue|Further testing of SCP-5488 is postponed indefinitely.##\n----\n**Description:** SCP-5488 is a set of eight custom-made stickers (designated SCP-5488-A through H) resembling film industry rating labels. No physical anomalies beyond the failure to lose adhesive properties after multiple uses and extreme resistance to damage have been observed.\n\nWhen an instance of SCP-5488 is placed onto any form of media (movies, books, video games etc.) the physical appearance and contents of the media will be altered drastically, corresponding to the SCP-5488 instance. Examples of alterations include:\n* addition or removal of coarse language in dialogue;\n* addition, expansion or censoring of scenes featuring violence and/or nudity; \n* addition, alteration or removal of plot elements.\n[[div]]\n##blue|When an image of SCP-5488 is uploaded to an electronic device, it will propagate itself virally throughout the device's data storage and across any available network connections. All propagated instances of SCP-5488 must be removed to prevent the spread of this virus; to date, only the complete shutdown of affected devices and networks has proven effective at achieving this.##\n\nThe Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-5488 when user \"falcon_crazy\" of the conspiracy forum [http://www.scp-wiki.net/parawatch-hub Parawatch] claimed to own something \"legit magical.\" The user supposedly discovered a set of anomalous rating stickers while performing spring cleaning in an under-the-stairs closet. MTF Kappa-43 (\"The Mediators\") recovered SCP-5488 and amnesticized its former owner, while the Identity and Technocryptography Section of Site-43 deleted the relevant forum posts.\n----\n##blue|**Incident 5488-1:** After extensive testing, Dr. Cann uploaded an image of SCP-5488 to 43NET in preparation for the file's final publication. This resulted in the immediate colonization of 43NET by SCP-5488. After reversion to an earlier backup erased the offending files, the present Special Containment Procedures were put in place.##\n----\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** NicholasCann@43.net\n**From:** HelenDray@43.net\n**Subject:** Database Reboot\n[[/div]]\n------\nNick,\n\nI commend you for the reboot solution, I think you saved both of our jobs. I've spoken to Director McInnis, and he says we won't be held accountable for the... disruption. He even congratulated us on our quick thinking!

Boy, really reminds you that we can't take these anomalies seriously enough, doesn't it? Who knows how many other horrible things are waiting for us in forgotten cardboard boxes.\n\n...still. We had archived versions of database files from SCiPNET on 43NET, and I'm definitely not sorry to have seen the PG version of 682. It managed to be cute and terrifying at the same time!\n\nIn the end, no harm, no foul.\n\n-- Nick\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** NicholasCann@43.net\n**From:** HelenDray@43.net\n**Subject:** RE: Database Reboot\n[[/div]]\n------\nNick,\n\nI'm not sure those were archived files.

He'll pump you full of the cleanest fluids in New York; you'll never get the Mr. Burns from //him!// His hose is the biggest of them all. Women gasp and men flee in shame as he rolls into town.
