I like the nickname.##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**Summary:** Subject(s) use --anomalous capabilities-- ##red|skill## to rob various banks and properties both across the United States and internationally.\n\nThe subject leads and works with the --criminal-- ##red|That's a bit rude, I'd say. More, err, \"thievery\"## organization known as \"Caninae\" to authorities.\n\n[[=image seal.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Suspect]]\n\n**Name:** --unknown-- ##red|Janus, Ishikawa Goemon, Robin Hood, Schinderhannes, etc. I've had many, to say the least.##, alias \"Canis Anthus\"\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** --Human--, --Espionage--, --Hostile-- ##red|:(##\n\n**Physical Description:**\n\n||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||\n|| Male || --72-- ##red|74## in. || Unknown/Medium ||--Caucasian-- ##red|It depends on the day, really.## || Black || Blue || Anubian jackal mask. Navy blue suit and goldenrod shirt.||\n\n**Capabilities:** Suspect has an --anomalous property-- ##red|Courtesy of your government. They wanted to use it for faking attacks to start proxy wars. PENTAGRAM. Such a devious, devilish name. It fits.## wherein they can produce explosions approximating two kilograms from their fingertips. These explosions, however, do not injure humans nor structural architecture; they appear to only affect safes.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown. Large sums of donated money matching the total value of stolen property occur one or two days after the theft: monetary gain does not seem to be main motive of the suspect. ##red|Oh, good! I was afraid you wouldn't notice. Sometimes you have to be very obtuse with things, I've learned.##\n\n**Modus Operandi:** Suspect will rob banks or mansions, usually during large gatherings or parties. They are nearly always assisted by the ##blue|highly talented, skilled, and the totally awesome!!## persons going by the name \"Canis Lupis\" and \"Canis Latrans\". ##red|I apologize for Latrans's outburst.##\n\n**Behavior:** Suspect - from witness interviews - is described as endearing and kind-natured. --It is unsure if this is a true evaluation of the suspect's character or a result of untreated Stockholm Syndrome.-- ##red|I don't like hurting people. After all, we only take from those who can shoulder the hit (and should've already.)##\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Evidence]]\n\n**A │ Fingerprint Match:** Fingerprint analysis between found prints at various crime scenes match with 97% confidence.

The subject infiltrated Site-81 and interacted with [DATA REMOVED], assisting SCP-████-A in their escape of Site-81.--\n##red|I never leave anybody behind, especially if they've helped me out in the past. They're not a bad person.##\n\n**D │ Anubis Mask:**\n[[include component:image-block name=anubis-mask.gif|align=center|width=250px|caption= 360 degree view of the mask.]]\nAn Anubis mask worn by the suspect. Found shattered at the scene of a robbery by an explosive force. The fingerprints on the mask coincide with those found on the safe present at the crime scene.\n##red|That was my favorite mask, too. Damn shame. I accidentally double-loaded the explosives on that safe. Glad to know nobody got hurt.##\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Bureau Record]]\n\n**Current Status:** --In process of apprehending-- ##red|Ain't happening.##\n\n**Crimes:** Multiple counts of Aggravated Robbery, three counts of Armed Robbery\n\n**Sentencing:** Indefinite Detainment\n\n**History of UIU Action:**\n__Late 2015:__ The UIU is alerted after several reports from Pennsylvanian authorities of a string of bank robberies where explosives were used in high effect: however, bystanders were never injured during these heists. ##red|As they shouldn't.##\n\n__04-01-16:__ The suspect was involved in the Site-81 containment breach regarding SCP-████-A. The UIU was deferred full operational investigation of the suspect.\n\n__06-23-17:__ Operational investigation was transferred back to the SCP Foundation after no progress was made on the case for over a year.\n\n##red|Good work overall!
