I love tea, hiking, overly complex board games, and, obviously, writing for the wiki.\n\n(As a side note, please feel free to DM me on Discord if you yourself are applying to law school and would like your statements reviewed, a few quick LSAT tips, or basically whatever. This is in part because I care about this community. Mostly, though: if you're reading this, you're almost certainly a leftist freak, and I would therefore consider it advantageous to help you get into a position of policymaking authority.)\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab SCPs]]\n\nThese are in declining order of how much I like them.\n\n**[[[SCP-8209]]] -- //[[[SCP-8209|Repairing the World]]]//**\n@@    @@//But you don't attain redemption through suffering.
