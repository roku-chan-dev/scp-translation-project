Darren Wells and Dr. Johna Baldric, the task force set out to explore the seemingly infinite number of worlds and pocket dimensions accessible from within the Gate Passage, and the hundreds of alien lifeforms and societies encountered there.\n\nHowever, several agents of the Serpents Hand have noticed Eta-13's recent \"invasion\" and do not plan to sit idly by as Eta-13 prepares for its next expedition...\n-----\n\n**Tales:**\n\n* Part 1: [[[Wayfarers]]]\n* Part 2: [[[We Boldly Went]]]\n* Part 3: [[[Razumite Games]]]\n* Part 4: [[[What Happened Beneath Cronos]]]\n* Part 5: [[[The Homecoming of Eta-13]]]\n\n-----\n\n**Supporting Documents:**\n* [[[SCP-2344]]]\n* [[[The Hydra's Spine]]]\n\n-----",
