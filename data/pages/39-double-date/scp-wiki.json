All the Chairs and Chiefs were there, along with every member of the O5 Council. Their identities were no secret in the new Foundation, so security was tighter than tight. But McInnis had reasoned that if what they had built could not sustain the deaths of just over a dozen fallible human beings, then it would never have stood the test of time anyway. So they came, and stayed, and applauded; some of them even wept. It was an expression of hope for the future. It was an investment in the new world, and a promise that they would remain a part of it.\n\nIt was also a double wedding. Everyone agreed that Harold Blank and Melissa Bradbury showed superhuman grace in consenting to share their special day with the other groom and bride, who somehow returned the favour by failing to break or blow up anything. It was as close to a perfect day as any of them had ever experienced.\n\nThere would be further contenders in the next few months.\n\nSeven months, to be specific. \n\nAfter that, the criteria would change.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 11 July\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nSokolsky didn't knock.

It was Yancy's domain now, as Chief of S&C, and he ran a tight ship. She had all the work she wanted running the Department of Containment, but it was nice to see the old haunts every now and again. Like today, for example, when she'd gotten a meeting request from Lewis Bosch.\n\nHe was waiting for her in the bullpen, which she took to be a sign. She'd never think about that room the same way again, not after the breach. He was sitting behind the duty desk that Janet Gwilherm had occupied during several of the last few minutes of her life, and he was looking very guilty indeed. The room was otherwise empty.\n\n\"What's up, Lew?\" she asked as she walked in the door.\n\n\"He doesn't know,\" said a voice from behind. \"Yet.\"\n\nIbanez didn't turn around, because she felt the gun pressed to the nape of her neck. \"Sandy?\"\n\nBosch's eyes were wide. \"Sandy, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"I am pointing my service weapon at an agent of the enemy.\"\n\n\"Oh, for crying out loud.\" Bosch stood up, which did little to improve his height. He coughed; he'd had a bad cough ever since eating a faceful of ghost vapour during their firefight in AAF-D. \"Not this again.\"\n\nShe couldn't turn around, so she made eye contact with him instead. \"She been bending your ear about how I've been acting strange since last September?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he nodded wearily. \"All year she has been doing that. Sandy, for fuck's sake, put the gun down.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner put her down.\"\n\n\"You can try.\"\n\n\"Even your reflexes aren't that good.\" Holt pressed the barrel closer. \"You twitch, I do too.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"What prompted this sudden urgency?\"\n\n\"Shit has been going down lately that no one can explain. Clandestine meetings. Breach drills. And you're in on it. You and McInnis and Lillihammer and Nascimbeni and Blank.\"\n\n\"Don't forget Wettle.\"\n\n\"I'm being serious.\" //As if you're ever __not__ being serious,// Ibanez thought. The other woman had never shown even a flicker of humour. \"Tell me what your little conspiracy is, and maybe I don't let my itch scratch you.\"\n\n\"Can I at least turn around?\"\n\n\"No. You can tell your tale to Lewis.\"\n\n\"Lucky me,\" Bosch grumbled.\n\nIbanez shrugged. \"Alright, long story short: seven sorry saps got killed by the breach, and it made them go weird. Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\n\"Well seven of //us// got too involved, but instead of killing us, it just fucked up our relationship to time. So when the breach happened again, and we behaved differently because what the fuck is going on, yikes, aaaaaa,\" and she waved her arms for emphasis, heedless of the weapon now nestled between her shoulder blades, \"and reality got rewritten, we remembered the old timeline instead of the new. So we didn't know shit, which is what you saw when I pulled my gun on you last year. Right? Sounds fucking stupid. I know. I promise you, if I were to make up a story, it would be a better one than this and //wow Howie __thanks so much__// for showing up after I've already done the damage.\" She'd really started to run her mouth by the end, the adrenaline kicking in hard.\n\n\"I wouldn't have shown up at all,\" Yancy said from even farther behind, \"if Scrawny hadn't gotten suspicious.\"\n\n\"I'm not scrawny,\" Roger's voice came from somewhere in the hall.\n\n\"Everyone's scrawny next to him. Sandy, I'm going to turn around.\"\n\nThe effect of that was Holt now pressing the gun to her forehead. \"Tell them what you just told us.\"\n\n\"Already have.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Bosch, now behind her.\n\n\"I needed to trust Howard, and Zwist told Roger.\"\n\n\"You didn't trust us?\" Holt's face was twisted with rage.\n\n\"You are pointing a gun at me,\" Ibanez noted. \"Still, I might add.\"\n\n\"Why not? I've got nothing to lose.\" Yancy's gun was trained on Holt's back. Ibanez couldn't see Roger from where she was standing.\n\n\"Huh?\" said Bosch.\n\nHolt huffed in frustration. \"Oh, figure it out already, guy! She's kept us in the dark from the start. She even made me look at a fucking cognitohazard just so I wouldn't see her conspiring with the word warlock. She didn't trust us, because she knew we'd try to stop what she's doing.\"\n\n\"What's she doing?\"\n\n\"Setting the timeline back, and wiping us all out. Right?\"\n\n\"Actually,\" Roger interrupted, \"nobody told me that part.\"\n\nThere was a meaningful //click// from the hall.\n\nYancy closed his eyes. \"God dammit.\"\n\n\"This is getting stupid,\" Ibanez growled. \"Everyone put down your guns.\"\n\nHolt adjusted her grip. \"Nothing doing.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Roger, \"no offence, but I just started on this job, so I'm not more invested in it than I am in //existing.//\"\n\nIbanez micro-stretched her muscles. To everyone else it would have looked like nothing more meaningful than getting the shakes. \"It's not like we're going to be erased.\"\n\nBosch's voice was tightening by the second. \"For you, apparently not.\"\n\n\"For all of us.\" Ibanez raised her hands in what she hoped was a conciliatory gesture. \"It'll just set things back the way things are meant to be.\"\n\nHolt's mouth was a grim line. \"So then I repeat: why didn't you trust us?\n\n//Enough is enough.// \"Because you're fucking dead, alright? In baseline. You get ripped to bits by a fucking werewolf.\"\n\nHolt stared at her.\n\nBosch appeared in her peripheral vision. \"You serious?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHolt pistol-whipped her. \"THAT'S the reality you're going to restore? That's the GOOD reality?!\"\n\nShe landed on Bosch's boot. He staggered away from her. \"That's what you call 'the way things are meant to be'? Wow. Thanks?\"\n\nShe wiped at her mouth. No blood. That was good. \"Listen to me.\"\n\n\"Kinda think I've heard enough.\" Holt pressed the pistol to her scalp.\n\n\"You'll never make the door,\" Yancy intoned.\n\n\"//Listen to me,//\" Ibanez pleaded. \"I've got some things to say, and I need you to believe me.\"\n\nHolt knelt down in front of her. \"Fat chance.\"\n\n\"It's me, Sandy.\" Ibanez reached out and seized the other woman's neck, forced their eyes into line. \"It's //me.//\"\n\nThe gun was now nestled between her breasts. \"Prove it?\"\n\nIbanez sighed, then disarmed her.\n\n\"Jesus //fuck!//\" Bosch shouted, as Ibanez pinned the lanky woman to the floor.\n\nYancy had moved to push Bosch to the wall, allowing Roger to enter as well. \"Holy shit, how did you even?\"\n\nIbanez pointed Holt's gun at him. \"Weapons down, kid, nice and easy but //right this second.//\"\n\nRoger raised both hands in a gesture of peaceful defeat, finger prominently off the trigger. \"Oh, it's not loaded. I just wanted to hear the end of the thing.\"\n\nYancy laughed.\n\n\"Well, it's your lucky day.\" Ibanez stood, leaving Holt handcuffed on the floor, face-down. \"I'm still feeling chatty. So Sandy?

He wasn't sure he would ever fully trust the man's intentions again. This didn't really matter, because Sokolsky was neither a friend nor a co-worker. Their workspaces were practically on opposite ends of the Site, if you didn't count AAF-D, which was becoming increasingly easy to do. Nevertheless, at this moment Sokolsky was standing in Wettle's reconstructed lab space, so giving him the stink eye of caution was once again mandatory.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked the bald man, for the fourth or fifth time.\n\n\"Just looking,\" Sokolsky responded. His previous responses had been \"Nothing special,\" \"Just checking the place out,\" \"Not much,\" \"Don't worry about it\" and maybe one more thing Wettle had immediately forgotten because it had originated in a space outside of his own head. \n\nWettle returned his attention to the twin terminals sitting on the lab table. One of them was consistently failing to connect to the Site-7 server, and the other was consistently succeeding, then breaking off immediately. The latter was the problem, since there wasn't supposed to be a Site-7 server anymore. Veiksaar had quarantined the terminal, shut off all its access to outside networks, then duplicated the thing and passed it on to him to see if he could replicate the uplink. If he couldn't, the anomalous connection was to be assumed malicious and untrustworthy. Things were definitely trending that way.\n\n\nVeiksaar had been very reluctant to send this work out to what she euphemistically referred to as \"the outside contractor,\" but she and her staff had enough to do re-wiring the Site that something this peculiar, time-consuming and unlikely to produce useful results would have been a waste of their effort right now. Everything they were working on would produce exponentially more valuable results, unlike anything Wettle could do.\n\nOf course, he wasn't the Deputy Chair of Replication Studies anymore.

Showtime. Wake up.\"\n\n\"I don't like shows,\" Wettle grumbled. He wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth with his labcoat sleeve; in attempting to return his arm to his side, he caught a cuff button on his beard. The result was several plucked hairs and one lost button, which skittered across the tiles with its blonde-dyed payload. He was too tired to even grumble about it as he staggered to his feet, knocking the chair over. Someone else would pick the chair up, and the button as well. There were janitors, and he had spare copies of everything he wore. A lot of them, in fact. They were necessary.\n\nHe headed for the back of the office, banging into several tables on the way. Normally this would have upset their contents; luckily, they had no contents. He'd properly stocked the locker he was heading for, however. He had priorities.

It swung gently back open as he bent to retrieve everything, lightly dinging him on the top of his head. This was, of course, par for the course. \"It's just sleep.\"\n\nSokolsky put a foot on the bedroll, which was slowly becoming a bed unroll on the filthy floor (which had been clean this morning; Wettle had a tendency to track things from place to place, including himself). \"Go back to your quarters, for fuck's sake.\"\n\nWettle grunted. \"I don't want to. People know where my quarters are. Sometimes they talk to me. I don't want to talk to anyone. I just want to pretend none of this is still happening.\"\n\nSokolsky shrugged. \"Alright, fine. But before you do that, I need your help with something.\"\n\nWettle sighed, and stood up again. \"Fine. Sure. What.\"\n\n\"Go stand by the door.\"\n\nWettle didn't bother asking why. He didn't care.

But it's a good time to get philosophical, you know?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Sure it is. I'm about to shuffle off. Only thing I get to pass along is whatever ends up in your head, from out of my mouth. Philosophy will be the only gift this Brenda Corbin can give to the world.\"\n\nUdo wanted to tape her partner's mouth shut. \"Don't talk about yourself like you're already gone.\"\n\n\"I have to.\" The other woman's expression was stricken, but her voice was strong. \"You've got to get used to it, bud. Next time you see me, I won't even know who you are.\"\n\n\"I never wanted this.\" Udo shook her head.\n\n\"I hope you don't mean that.\"\n\nShe blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Your parents are probably dead, you realize? Along with two thirds the planetary population. That's a pretty high price for a successful romantic relationship between two people, even being philosophical.\"\n\nUdo wasn't sure what to say to that.\n\n\"So what I'm wondering is, what happens to the souls of all the people who are about to have never happened?\"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. \"Never happened?\"\n\n\"Assuming the breach reverts this whole mess back to first principles, all the mental and emotional energy that went into us is going to do one of two things: poof out of existence, or rubberband back into baseline. That's got to be one hell of a psychic punch.\"\n\nShe hadn't thought about it. She didn't much care to think about it now. \"I dunno.\"\n\n\"Nobody does. Nobody //can.//\"\n\n\"Timelines have collapsed before.\"\n\n\"Yeah, and the people who handled that are notable by their absence. There's a reason Reynders is our time lady, and not somebody from the actual DTA. They're all DOA, so now that we need some answers from them, we're SOL.\"\n\n\"QED,\" Udo smiled.\n\nBrenda slid along her naked torso, slick with sweat, and kissed her on the lips.\n\n\"That's the spirit. So brainstorm with me a bit. What happens to this version of me when you go back where you came from?\"\n\n\"Maybe the version of me that would otherwise have been in this body--\"\n\n\"Don't,\" Brenda cautioned.\n\n\"--will get it back, and this timeline will keep on—\"\n\n\"//Don't.//\" The theologian put a hand over her mouth. \"I didn't start this conversation for you to try and give me hope that it's not all about to come crashing down. The goal here was to give you some small amount of solace about the fact that your girlfriend is about to get ontologically erased.\"\n\n\"Oh, right,\" she said into Brenda's knuckles. \"Because you're not afraid of it at all. This is just for my benefit.\"\n\nThe other woman pulled her hand back, and rubbed her eyes with it. \"I've achieved a few genuine lifetime goals within the span of less than a year.

I've woken up next to a gorgeous woman I care for very deeply almost every day, and I got that because a really inconceivable number of ordinary people went through some excruciating agony and terror.\"\n\nThere was no answering that, so Udo went back to the previous question. \"Where do you think //that// psychic energy is going to go?\"\n\nBrenda shrugged. Skin sliding against skin felt good. It felt //right.// \"I dunno. Maybe it's better that it never happened. Six-tenthsing the human race puts a psychic scar on the multiverse that seems like it'd be really hard to heal. It might be a moral prerogative for us to see that gone.

He squeezed her tight. She squeezed him back, not hesitantly as she had a year ago, but with the full force of need.\n\n\"I love you,\" she whispered.\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered back. Not 'I love you too', subordinating one statement to the other, suggesting it was merely a response rather than the most important thing in their lives. They always did it this way. \n\nHis arms ached as he pulled her in closer, chin on her scalp, left hand on his right shoulder, right hand on the small of her back. He didn't care. Let them ache. Her hands on his back were like claws, dug in deep, and that didn't matter either. Let her draw blood. She was entitled.\n\nHis legs ached, too, and that was a problem. He knew why.\n\nHe felt the pull.\n\nThey had realized, the Survivors, on comparing notes, that this explained why they'd all felt drawn to certain locations prior to the initial shift. It also explained why the Harry who naturally belonged to this timeline had insisted on walking into a warzone to go check out his former apartments. Both versions of themselves were trying to get into roughly the same position, to minimize transition pains. It had worked out pretty well for everyone who wasn't Udo Okorie.\n\nWhy did it work that way?\n\nWell, it didn't make any more or less sense than the rest of it.\n\n\"Don't go,\" she said into his chest.\n\n\"I don't want to.\" His vision blurred.\n\n\"Is it happening?\"\n\nHe nodded.

How was it that his voice still found space to fit in a crack?\n\nHe waltzed her out the door. They didn't change positions. The corridor was empty, the corridor that had been smashed and on fire when they'd first been reunited. He swung them around so he was the one backing up, since he knew the way.\n\n\"Tell me when you get there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll send a carrier pigeon.\"\n\nShe laughed, and looked up at him, and he looked down at her short, receding chin and baggy cheeks and lazy smile, and he would have stopped the world from spinning if it meant she wouldn't spin away from him.\n\nHe couldn't even countenance the enormity of that feeling. He was setting billions of lives against hers and acting like there was a choice worth making. He had to lose her. He had to lose their makeshift utopia and return to the well-populated hellworld from whence they'd come.\n\nHe didn't want to.\n\n\"What I meant,\" she choked, \"was tell me you love me.

She stared across the table at the empty space. She'd wanted to be alone, and nobody was in the cafeteria at this hour. It was practically abandoned these days, having suffered such extensive utilities and structural damage that it was next to impossible to properly heat and ventilate the space. It was cold, and it was close, and it was--\n\n--gone, and she was staring into the face of Daniil Sokolsky. Not her Daniil Sokolsky. This one was cleaner, neater, tidier, perhaps a little less smug. He was surrounded by an utterly immaculate cafeteria, not as it had been a year ago, but as it might have been a year hence, if everything went precisely to plan.\n\nShe now suspected those plans had all been meaningless.\n\nShe took a deep breath. \"What's the date?\"\n\nHis mouth took over his face; she was surprised there was enough solid structure left to support the upper half of his head. \"Ninth of September, 2004.\"\n\nShe exhaled. \"Oh, thank god.\" She wasn't sure she felt it, even as she said it.\n\n\"Why did you need to know the date to finish your sentence?\"\n\nShe didn't know what he was talking about.

She hadn't wanted to live in the post-apocalypse. She certainly would have been up for the challenge of rebuilding human society, but she preferred to flourish in a world that was already half-prepared for her genius. \n\n\"You're gonna give God a complex,\" he grunted. He was still grinning.\n\n//What you don't know about gods, Lex...// She laughed, and stood up. \"I need to find McInnis.

This alternate timeline was the result of reality restructuring linked with the cascade containment breach scenario occurring in 2002, then recurring in 2003 and 2004, in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D at Site-43.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** In your own words, beginning with Dr. McInnis, would you please describe the nature of this alternate reality? Director McInnis first, then down the line. Succinctly, if possible.\n\n**Director McInnis:** A complete breakdown of order, only arrested by our own actions.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** A second chance.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** A clusterfuck of escalating absurdity.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I dunno, about as weird as it always is.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Seriously?\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Please, let's get through the progression first. Chief Ibanez?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** I'd go halfsies with all of them. An escalation of our everyday clusterfuck into an absurd breakdown of order, with second chances on the side.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** A bad situation, but not a hopeless one.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** A bad //joke.//\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** How far back did the divergence go?\n\n**Director McInnis:** September 8, 2002.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Describe, in your own words, the situation prior to the timeline shift.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** There was no reason to think that what happened in 2002 would ever happen again. According to all of our metrics, it was a freak accident — the cost of doing business with an esoteric inventory.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Orphic outflow was at an all-time low by September 2003. We'd streamlined AcroAbate so well that we were actually thinking about shutting down one or two of the smaller facilities. And then F-D exploded again.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** As if the first time was just such fantastic fun that it had to become a tradition.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** We handled it much better this time.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** That was our first mistake.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** And then it got worse.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Suddenly the Site was totally trashed, everybody looked like their best friend had died after telling them their nastiest secret, and we all had guns at our hips. Well, I mean, I always do, but it was a bit of a shock for the paper-pushers.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** How serious were the differences?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Seven of the luckless losers who were supposed to die in that magic dumpster fire lost their goddamn minds, and they had a whole year to do their damage.\n\n**Director McInnis:** The Earth was in anarchy, and Site-43 was a war zone.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Why was the Site still intact at all?\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** I got the impression they wanted something from us. The Victims, I mean.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** You still think of them as victims?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** No.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Yes. They weren't themselves, not really. They were more like...\n\n**Dr. McInnis:** Each other.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** With the magic nastiness in those pipes, it's no wonder the Maleficent Seven were such royal pains in the ass.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** How long did it take for you to assert a new order?\n\n**Director McInnis:** Most of the year.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** That's not really true. We had a lot of it figured out in two or three months. We just had to win hearts and minds a bit, figure out who we could trust with the Big Secret.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Why not simply tell everyone? Assert your authority?\n\n**Director McInnis:** You're familiar with impostor syndrome.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Of course.\n\n**Director McInnis:** It's much worse when you actually //are// an impostor.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Imagine… okay, if this has happened three times, we can pretty safely assume it's not gonna stop. Imagine how fucked up these scenarios are gonna be when we've got a decade's worth of alternate history between then and now.\n\n**Director McInnis:** Alternatively, let's imagine ways to prevent that from happening.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** You've got my vote. I don't ever want to see those fuckers alive again. It was hard enough killing them once.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Yeah. Once.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** You did kill them, then?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Oh, there was never any doubt.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I'm surprised you were able to manage it, considering.\n\n**Director McInnis:** Considering?\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** It sounds like an end-of-world scenario.\n\n**Director McInnis:** It certainly might have been one, had they a few more months to prosecute it. Whatever was driving these people to do what they were doing, it had a pathological hatred of containment.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I spent the months after we, mostly Del, put them into the ground going over the original breach with a fine-tooth comb, trying to figure out what each of us had done to change the course of events. We're going to have to do it every year, assuming this wasn't just a one-off fluke recurrence.\n\n**Director McInnis:** The only assumption we can afford to make.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I was under the impression it already was policy, but that's likely because the things you did today... were walked back to 2002, and 2003. Oh, that's tough to wrap my head around.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Tell me about it.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Even with your scientific background, eh?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm serious, please tell me about it. I'm still confused.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Working theory is that each of us did something to push the breach to its conclusion, so we're… bound to it, somehow, like our dead friends are. The problem is… I can't figure out what //I// did.\n\n**Director McInnis:** There's no visual record, and you say you have no memory of the event.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Well, I can remember the explosions just fine. And I can remember being in a containment cell in Applied Occultism, studying some thaumic discharge. But the details are hazy, like I've… only got half a script, or something.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** We also spent some time devising better ways to contain our subjects, after first re-containing them. \n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Which is good. We'll need that knowledge.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Why?\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** According to my work logs for today, which... I've just finished reading for the first time...\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I know this must be disconcerting.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** It still doesn't feel real. Oh, Christ...\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** We can take a moment, if you--\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** No. //No.// Alright, so. Computer analysis suggests that every time the breach happens, the amount of damage done to our containment equipment Site-wide goes up. If it's percentage-based, which it seems to be... though I don't know how some eldritch goddamn explosion is calculating that... then over-compensating will mean we never have to deal with any escapes.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Assuming the damage doesn't hit one hundred percent some day.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Which we definitely can't assume either.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** The point is, we won. Yay us! MTF Up-Yours (\"Godkillers\").\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Yay.\n\n**Director McInnis:** You jest, but I think a stationary taskforce might be in order now, as well as some serious survival training. With everything we knew, we still came perilously close to failing.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Y'all did fail. I'm the one who made it work.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Go on?\n\n**Director McInnis:** Actually, I would prefer we left that detail off the record for now.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** What do you think would have happened if we hadn't done it? Failed to perform the right set of actions again?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** If we hadn't killed all seven of them, then told their ghosts where to get off?\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Yes.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** I think we'd have ended up screwing reality backwards again. Probably in a new and even more exciting way.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Is there a way back?\n\n**Director McInnis:** No.\n\n**Dr. Blank:** You're not even a scientist.

Their hair hadn't changed either, his more stylishly short than it had been for years, hers a little longer than it had been at Camp Ipperwash but still not a patch on the old brown mane she'd been sporting when they met. Sokolsky had grabbed a few of their personal effects for examination, too; Harry had surrendered his datapad full of scanned sketches, which his staff was presently downloading, while McInnis had apparently been perusing //The Lines Are Down// when the minute struck and could present a comprehensive history of the lost world for similar treatment.

Harry expected to rest only fitfully, but ended up waking around two in the afternoon. A quick check of his tablet revealed that he was expected back at Ngo's office by three to finish presenting the narrative, then start drilling down into the details.\n\nA quick check of his laundry hamper revealed that someone, probably Sokolsky, had come in during the night to steal the clothes he'd been wearing as O5-2. Maybe Lillian had let him in.\n\nHe took a shower, selected something that looked comfortable enough -- all of his clothes were unfamiliar now, even the ones he'd had for years -- and headed back to resume the ordeal.\n\nLillian was still wearing her dazzle coat, the same one she'd donned to wait out the initial timeline shift. Apparently there wasn't much difference in fashion sense between her two versions. McInnis dressed like he always did; Nascimbeni and Del had switched back to their jumpsuits, though neither looked precisely comfortable in them. Nascimbeni's eyes were buried under thick purple bags, and Harry suddenly wondered whether he'd been drugged for the first half of the debriefing. He'd seemed preternaturally calm for someone who'd just lost a year's worth of reunion with his son, and now looked like he'd just come back from an hour-long crying fest.\n\nHe felt a pang of guilt over noticing these things. A good night's sleep and a quick shower, and he'd only thought about his... vanished wife every few minutes instead of non-stop. It felt like a betrayal. It felt //unfaithful.//\n\n//Oh,// he thought. //I don't want to do any of this.//\n\nUdo was wearing a corduroy sweater, navy blue, a little like the one she'd borrowed from Corbin.

Their only order.\n\nHe wasn't sure what it said about him yet, the decision to utterly ignore them for the first time in his long career.\n\nBut as he'd once been instructed by the only authority he really, truly trusted, he intended to take the next available moment to consider it.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n\nAnother three hours of dredging up bad memories took the fight out of all of them.
