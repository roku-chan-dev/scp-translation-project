Civilians who had met with the Andersen siblings were administered with amnestics and all accounts of the family have been erased from historical records.\n \nDue to a lack of information on the entity known as SCP-8099, further containment procedures are not deemed viable.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8099 is the collective designation for the seven siblings known as the Andersen siblings:\n\n* Siw Andersen, 3 years old\n* Lars Andersen, 4 years old\n* Twins Keno and Meli Andersen, 6 years old \n* Lia Andersen, 7 years old\n* Sven Andersen, 8 years old\n* Juno Andersen, 9 years old\n\n\nIn 1910, local authorities in the area of Sala, Sweden received several complaints and reports on the Andersen family, a foster family consisting of the older Ada Andersen and seven orphaned children. These reports largely concerned suspected \"witchcraft\" and \"heresy\" among the siblings. Reports mentioned several items that had reportedly been \"conjured\" by the children, though civilians were first suspected to have been exaggerating strange or odd behavioral traits. However, based on the amount reports accumulated, Foundation researchers opted to survey the Andersen family leading to containment. Dr. Sven Linde was research lead.\n\n**Addendum 8099-1: Initial interview with the Andersens**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN EXCERPT]\n----\n\n//Dr. Sven Linde sits on a peg chair in the kitchen of Ada Andersen's 19th century homestead. Their grandmother hurriedly sweeps a whirlwind of children inside.//\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Okay, now my darlings, pl- please try to be quiet and say hello to the young doctor from the, uh- the \"Foundation\", as it were.\n\n//The siblings jab at each other, sniggering and chattering. When they notice Dr. Linde's presence, a few of them stiffen up.//\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Now now, form a line! A beautiful line, just like you did so nicely when the priest was here.\n\n//The children seem to be attempting to order themselves according to their length.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** Juno! Over there! By Sven! You're the tallest! Stupid-\n\n//Lia, a blonde long-haired child, pulls Juno to the end of the line.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** Let me go! I can do it myself... MY NAME, is is, Juno! I'm the uh... The //tallest// of the seven knights!\n\n//Lia makes a face at Juno. This face seems to resemble an old woman about to scold him. In a moment this face disappears.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** I'm Lia. These are my siblings.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Well I-\n\n**Keno & Meli Andersen:** We- we, we- are Keno and Meli!\n\n**Meli Andersen:** I have my own island!\n\n**Keno Andersen:** I, uh- I!! I have got these...\n\n//Keno pulls out a bag of marbles out of their pocket and starts pouring them all out on the floor, having the seven siblings disassemble in order to go after the lost marbles.//\n\n//The second smallest of the bunch is in the process of kicking the marbles away in every direction.//\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Oh dear me! Lars! You don't need to kick them away!\n\n**Lars Andersen:** RAAAWR! AAARGH.\n\n//A moon-eyed toddler is picked up by Ada as to avoid the commotion on the floor.//\n\n**Ada Andersen:** This is dear Siw, she hangs along a lot.\n\n//While most of the children are scrambling on the ground after the marbles, one boy still stands in his place. He looks at Dr. Linde almost with reverence, and raises his hand.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Nice to meet you doctor. My name is Sven. What's yours?\n\n//Linde clears his throats and shakes the boy's hand//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** My name is also Sven, Sven Linde. What a, uhm... terrific set of siblings you have here.\n\n**Sven Andersen:** They are mostly not in the way. I hope you enjoy your stay.   \n\n**Dr. Linde:** Well, we'll see shall we? Now, could I ask your grandmother some questions in private please? \n\n**Ada Andersen:** Oh, my dear, did I call them my grandchildren? That's not exactly true... \n\n**Dr. Linde:** Are you not related?\n\n//The long-haired child is looking up from underneath the table.//\n\n**Lia Andersen** We were left here by our parents! They were //poor// and //unable// to keep us!\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Oh my, oh yes I guess that is true. But sometimes, I like to imagine them as my own anyway, because they practically are, little rascals!\n\n//The siblings have found most of the marbles, and has lost interest in the guest. They swiftly run outside, leaving an eerie silence in the kitchen.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Have there been any reactions to your foster children's behavior in the area recently? Anything unusual?\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Well, yes there have been some rumours of course. But most people I believe mean well. I don't really believe in having the little ones on a leash. Children should explore for themselves and discover things, the world! I guess that's one of the reasons people react to their open ways.\n\n//Ada Andersen clears her throat.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** What do folk usually say about your children?\n\n//Ada smiles and closes her eyes for a brief moment to think.//\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Oh well dear, they didn't say much about Sven or Juno, the oldest. When I suddenly had four of them, I started hearing all kinds of comments. That they lied about things, were up to no good, that they had stolen different items and that they were unfaithful...\n\n**Dr. Linde:** And... Is there any truth to this?\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Hmm. Yes, yes I can confirm. I think there have been moments were Juno or Sven or Lia has lied about things that have or have not happened, and I believe together, they have formed quite the band of rascals at points. But never have they sought to harm anyone! It is just their way... I mean, some things are bound to happen when you have seven of them!\n\n**Dr. Linde:** I am not here to judge your children on any accounts of thieving. But I am interested in all the reports I have heard about your children getting their hands on seemingly uncommon items. There have been reports of various innocuous items, such as rope, clothing and toys. However, you also mentioned another item you wanted to show me?\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Yes...\n\n//Ada audibly sighs as she rises and lifts the seat of the kitchen sofa where a sharp tool is contained. As she puts it on the table, the shining blade reveals that it is a dagger. The grip is wired with leather, and it has a crossguard and pommel out of steel.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** It looks... Brand-new?\n\n**Ada Andersen:** You could cut yourself on it, I made sure to get it away from them as soon as possible.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** And, where could it have come from?\n\n**Ada Andersen:** Well, they could hardly carry it in their hands, let alone steal it! And there's no smith who makes weapons around here. Besides, it looks ancient! It could have belonged to a theatre, but there's no one around. I suspect some company must have dropped it on their way through Sala and they found it in a ditch. \n\n**Dr. Linde:** I suppose it's possible. And it's time I get some time with your children. If you will give me a hand.\n\n----\n= [END EXCERPT]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Tornersv%C3%A4rd_Sverige_1776-1800%2C_klingan_Solingen_ca_1600-1650_-_Livrustkammaren_-_68960.tif/lossy-page1-640px-Tornersv%C3%A4rd_Sverige_1776-1800%2C_klingan_Solingen_ca_1600-1650_-_Livrustkammaren_-_68960.tif.jpg| caption= File photograph of knightly dagger found in the Andersen residence. |width=1000px]]\n\n**Addendum 8099-2: Excerpt from Dr. Linde's Logbook**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN EXCERPT]\n----\n\nMy assistant and I have followed the object of study for a week at this point. We have had some difficulty following the siblings during the days as they often set about in different groups on the grounds of the property. The property, a 19th century homestead includes farmland and woodland, a main building with surrounding economical buildings such as a stable and a barn; pastures behind the main building crossed with a running stream. We try to shadow one group of children at a time and observe their behavior when they are not supervised by their parents, which is often. Seemingly completely undisciplined, the object of study was difficult to keep in conversation or obtain any valuable information from. Although, we did see examples of suspected conjurings. \n\n----\n= [END EXCERPT]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Allan_%C3%96sterlind_-_Lekande_barn_-_sommar_p%C3%A5_f%C3%A4bodvallen.jpg/1542px-Allan_%C3%96sterlind_-_Lekande_barn_-_sommar_p%C3%A5_f%C3%A4bodvallen.jpg?20090821164751\n| caption= An assistant made several paintings of the siblings during the course of the study.

They throw pebbles and rocks into the stream.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** Come on, harder!\n\n//Lars proceeds to lash stones at the stream in a clumsy manner. Siw waddles behind her siblings, picking up dirt and pebbles from the ground before falling on her head, somersaulting in the process. Screeching ensues. Lia rushes toward her.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** No, no no. Siw, get up. You are okay! You are okay.\n\n//Lia hugs her sister, almost carrying her onward, she picks up her arms and makes her walk as some sort of doll. Siw blurbs out a laughter as she is half-lifted onward.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** We need to follow them! Stop them!\n\n//Lars has started throwing sticks, bigger rocks and logs into the stream.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** Yes good, wall! Big wall!\n\n**Siw Andersen:** Big wall!\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Are they stopping the serpents?\n\n//Dr. Linde is caught surprised by this one, coming up from behind him. Sven has blonde hair, blue still eyes, different from the others.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Stopping the serpents? They're throwing rocks into the stream.\n\n//Sven looks upon Dr. Linde with unconcerned eyes, acting patiently.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** No, doctor, I think you are mistaken. \n\n**Dr. Linde:** Really?\n\n//Dr. Linde smirks at the precocious young man who stands honorably with both of his hands behind his back.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** They are needed to stop the great rush of serpents. The serpents' fleet are usually moved to the east because of the tide but since they are allied with the Enemy, they need to be stopped. \n\n//Dr. Linde starts laughing with no response from the boy.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Tsk, tsk. How //unworldly// of you.\n\n//He uses the word \"unworldly\" as if it was appropriated from some other source. At the same time, Lars stands on top of a rock in the middle of the stream, seemingly celebrating having repelled the bigger bass and trout of the stream with larger logs and stones.//\n----\n= [END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN LOG]\n----\n//Keno, Meli and Juno Andersen are in a wooded area on the Andersen's property. Juno seems to lead the other younger ones into the forest, tipping on their toes.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** SCHHH! Quiet!\n\n**Meli Andersen:** I'm trying!! But these thickets are so stingy!\n\n**Juno Andersen:** They'll wake up! Schh! Okay.\n\n//The company pauses for a brief moment in silence. Juno signals for the others, and then walks into a thicker bushy area. The two younger ones brush their feet against each other.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** I got it!\n\n//There is a euphoric expression on the faces of the two younger ones as Juno comes out of the bushes, with three white objects in his hands.//\n\n**Meli and Keno:** Yay we did it! They didn't wake up!\n\n**Juno Andersen:** Team effort. It slept like a log!\n\n//The trio bursts out into terrible laughter at this.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Young boy! What have you got there?\n\n//The boy is visibly frightened by the sudden movements of Dr. Linde who has shadowed the trio from behind.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** Why this, this is... \n\n//Juno puts his head down. The three objects that he now has distributed to the other siblings appear to be cones of a cold and soft kind of cream [[footnote]]This cream has later been interpreted as a kind of soft ice cream which had not been invented until the 1920s.[[/footnote]].//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** What in the... Where in god's name have you obtained these?\n\n**Juno Andersen:** The trees... //Juno starts to sob.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Wha-, the trees? What do you... Ah, don't cry like that. \n\n**Juno Andersen:** I'm sorry... I know we are not supposed to take them... But it's almost the end of dormancy...\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Taken them? Did you steal them from someone? Out here in the woods?\n\n//Suddenly Sven appears out of nowhere and runs right in front of Juno.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Juno! We can't take those! You know the Gameflies need the nectar of the Wontrees to survive! It is not ours to take. \n\n**Juno Andersen:** B-, b- but the Gameflies aren't here yet... How do you know they will come?\n\n**Sven Andersen:** They will come! They will help us! They have always done so!\n\n//The bushes that Juno ran into has no remarkable contents different from a normal forest grove. The children continue to emphasize that the soft and cold cream was the nectar of so called \"Wontrees\".//\n----\n= [END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN LOG]\n----\n//At a rare occasion, all of the siblings are gathered in an empty pasture field where they convene.//\n\n**Meli Andersen:** Oh what can we do? What can we do?\n\n**Lars Andersen:** I can shoot them! I will shoot them, BLAM BLAM.\n\n**Sven Andersen:** No! That is not right. It doesn't work. \n\n**Lia Andersen:** I want to dance! Let's dance! We can use... The the the, the fairies!\n\n//Lia makes a motion with her hands up in the air.//\n\n**Lars Andersen:** I can stomp them!\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Let's dance! The fairies!\n\n**Keno and Meli Andersen:** Fairies! Dance everyone!\n\n//The group takes each others' hands and start to spin in a circle in the grass. As they lift their legs and swing them across patches of grass, groups of butterflies lift and fly away.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** There! The fairies!\n\n**Siw Andersen:** Fairyyyy!\n\n//The group continues to stomp and dance around, and at one time motioning toward Dr. Linde to join them in their circle. Dr. Linde stands up with hesitation, but sits himself down again shortly thereafter.//\n----\n= [END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nDr. Linde didn't find any items after this last event; however, he noted that the field looked exceptionally \"bloomy\" after the dancing. He could never confirm that the vegetation had actually changed.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Albert_Edelfelt_-_Boys_Playing_on_the_Shore_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/640px-Albert_Edelfelt_-_Boys_Playing_on_the_Shore_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg | caption= Keno, Juno and Lars simulating a 'naval battle' in lake Mälaren. |width=1000px]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN LOG]\n----\n//Dr. Linde has followed the family down to the lake where the children had insisted on going. As Ada didn't dare to challenge the seven-part choir, she gladly made up an excuse to travel to the closest port market. When the group arrives, the children hurry to the brim of the lakeside, and start balancing on the rocks. They shout and make a terrible noise.//\n\n**Keno Andersen:** Bah- bah ba!! Get all the people safe. Make them safe! I will build a fort.\n\n//Keno assembles a pile of small sticks on one of the rocks.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Quickly, we need to deploy! Deploy the armaments! Deploy defense!\n\n**Siw Andersen:** Defense, defense, defense!\n\n**Juno Andersen:** I'm coming!\n\n//Meli and Lia throw pebbles into the lake, while Siw stands in a small crevice of water, stomping her bare feet in the water.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Across the great Ethereal Ocean! Advance!\n\n//While the boys a moment ago did not seem to carry anything in their pockets, now Juno and Sven carry a few miniature boats with sails that they let loose into the water. Cheering sounds are heard from the siblings behind them.//\n\n**Lia Andersen:** Starboard! Portside! Watch out! \n\n//Sven pushes one of the boats further out with a stick.//\n\n**Juno Andersen:** Give em' everything you've got, oh great Fleet of Meneria!\n\n//The children continue cheering on the little ships, throw pebbles and make waves until they finally celebrate victory.//\n\n**Lars Andersen:** They cowards!

And we have again made our stood our ground! Now we have control over the Ethereal Ocean, rid of serpents and ghouls. But we are not free yet! The Enemy is still out there. Now we must defend our beautiful prairies and lands from the approaching armies. Let us banish them from our lands! \n\n//The children dance and cheer. There is a sulphury smell in the air. Dr. Linde stares at the rowdy boy and is about to speak when he notices the gunpowder that run from the young boy's hands down onto the ground.//\n----\n= [END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nSome time during the last days of this summer in 1910, Dr. Linde grew suspicious of an individual allegedly living in the area. The person of interest called himself Stennja and seemed to be an outcast within the society of Sala. His appearance is recorded within one of the observational logs.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN LOG]\n----\n//A group of the children play in the garden, when they are distracted by a tall man walking past the garden. He takes his hat off and greets the siblings. They run up to the white picket fence and starts an eager conversation with him. He is dressed in a suit colored in a very deep color of black. Dr. Linde hurries up to talk to the man.//\n\n**The siblings in unison:** We won Stennja! We did it!\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Well, uhm //Linde clears his throat// good day to you gentleman.\n\n//The man's attention is switched from the children to Dr. Linde.//\n\n**Stennja:** Oh, I'm sure you did. Did you avert the serpents as well? G'dday t'you Mister.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** So the children have told you about their, uh-, adventures?\n\n**Stennja:** Sure 'nough. They're heroes indeed. \n\n//Stennja speaks in a northern dialect, typically shortening his words.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** I hope they don't bother the gentleman, when he passes?\n\n**Stennja:** Not'at'all! I'm glad to hear 'em. It's why I'm 'ere. \n\n**Dr. Linde:** You... Come here to visit them? Voluntarily?\n\n//Stennja chuckles and picks up Siw who gestures for him to pick her up from behind the fence. He holds her in his right arm.//\n\n**Stennja:** You've grown. Y'know these kids are not like most. They're allowed a good life. Out here on these grounds they learn to like all of it. Worthless things becomes treasure. There are kingdoms we can never take from them. Hey, Sven!\n\n//Sven gets up closer to the fence and looks dutiful.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Yes, Stennja?\n\n//Stennja whispers something into the boy's ear.// \n\n//Sven looks hesitant at first, but soon lights up and runs into the house. He comes back with the dagger, carefully folded in cloth. He hands it to Stennja who has passed Siw back into the garden.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Is... Is it yours? How did you come by it? It's at least-\n\n**Stennja:** An old relic... Yes it's as old as it looks. Been passed down for generations. I lost it somewhere here, good thing Sven could take care of it for me for a while.\n\n//Stennja gives Sven a wink and puts his hat back on.//\n\n**Stennja:** Well, I've gotten what I needed. I'll see you a-\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Okay, well listen sir. I am afraid that item needs to stay here. \n\n//Dr. Linde pulls out a few papers of documentation.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** You see, we are from the authorities and we would highly appreciate if everything could stay on the properties so far. We might uh- need it for a while... \n\n**Stennja:** What, is something wrong? \n\n**Dr. Linde:** We are just looking into these children, whether they belong here, //linde clears his throat// in this foster family. I can not tell you much but I can assure you will get your heirloom back. \n\n//Stennja hesitantly hands the dagger to Linde.//\n\n**Stennja:** I sure hope I can trust the authorities with it.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Or we can simply rely on Sven again, can't we Sven? For you to take care of it a little while longer?\n\n//Sven looks on with a puzzled gaze.//\n\n**Stennja:** Hmph, indeed.\n\n//Stennja nods his hat before making his way down the road again.//\n\n----\n= [END LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum-8099-4: Excerpt from Dr. Linde's Log Book**\nJune 18th 1910 Dr. Linde assumed to have sufficient evidence to detain the orphans to Site-80 along with their foster parent, Mrs. Andersen. After this detainment, Dr. Linde made the following profile of the seven children.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN EXCERPT]\n----\n\n\n **Juno Andersen, 9 years of age.**\nMousy hair. Sensitive and dumb. Has an affinity for conjuring a cold kind of cream.\n\n**Sven Andersen, 8 years of age.**\nBlonde. Overly adult. Has conjured gunfire. Wants to be the hero.\n\n**Lia Andersen, 7 years of age.**\nLonger blonde hair. Playful but does her duties. Is very good at doing faces; so good at one point I was sure she had turned her face into a golem. The very next moment she had removed this face.\n\n**Meli Andersen, 6 years of age.**\nShort, blonde hair. Indistinguishable to their twin Keno. Outgoing. Is allegedly in the possession of a private island they visit regularly – investigate.\n\n**Keno Andersen, 6 years of age**\nShort, blonde hair. Indistinguishable to their twin Meli. Shy. Has shown to be able to conjure many colorful marbles at a time.\n\n**Lars Andersen, 4 years of age**\nBlonde. Quite aggressive. Has participated in anomalous events however has not performed conjuring directly. \n\n\n**Siw Andersen, 3 years of age**\nSmall, stubby and with short brown hair. Yabbers quite a lot nonsensically.

He is looking away from Dr. Linde.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Sven, Sven? Again, I am not here to be angry at you, or blame you for anything. I represent, an organization, a group... We uh- need to talk about your abilities. Your own land... The Ethereal Ocean, and the Wontrees. We would like to know it all. I am sure you know of what I am speaking better than anyone of your siblings. \n\n//Sven doesn't move and Dr. Linde fidgets in his seat. After a moment of silence, Dr. Linde bends forward toward Sven.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Listen. We are not, the Enemy. We are not, a part of them. If you want to rid your \"world\" of the Enemy, we are your strongest bet. Because you are not getting anywhere, without us. Do you understand me?\n\n//The boy moves, and closes his eyes. Finally, he nods and begins to sob.//\n\n**Sven Andersen:** Will you help us with the Enemy? If I answer your questions?\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Doing the opposite will certainly not deal with the Enemy. Your best bet is just to tell us all you know about it. We-, we will see what we can do.\n\n**Sven Andersen:** What we see is not visible to you, that I have known for a very long time. You are //unworldly//, like most. I //hardly believe//, you will be able to do anything against the Enemy. The Enemy is not a human being, not even a being. The Enemy has always, throughout our lives, moved closer. It is the shadow that puts nature under its forcing hand. We have been told by a great knight, that we must block the many minions of the Enemy to protect the land.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** You don't seem to be able to travel to this world you are speaking about. I can see you perfectly clear. On the other hand, several items have appeared here. Can you explain these? \n\n**Sven Andersen:** These items have always been here. This is our world.\n \n**Dr. Linde:** I thought you said the world was your own?\n\n**Sven Andersen:** There is only one world. But you don't seem to see its //forthcoming demise//.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Maybe there's a chance of avoiding this...

Without knowing he was being supervised, the boy immediately took interest in the box, lifting it up, throwing it against the wall and hiding inside of it. When the boy was concealed under the box, a violent screaming and thrashing could be heard. The box was split in two when the boy rose up again and started stomping the parts of the box flat. When the boy was seen slicing the cardboard apart with means of a rusty key, guards intervened. The boy loudly protested: \"GET OFF PRISON GUARDS! I GOT THE KEY. I KILLED YOUR SERVANT! DEAD DEAD DEAD!\" A new containment chamber of higher security classification is considered as the conjured key perfectly fit the lock of the door to chamber 34.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Test #:** 2 \n**Subject:** Keno & Meli Andersen\n**Place:** On Site-80 grounds, supervised by a team of researchers and security personnel. \n**Complementary Items:**  A wooden canoe with paddles is left together with the twins.\n----\nThe ground of the site allows for activities on bigger patches of grassland. The twins were let outside into the yard where the canoe was centered. They first approached the canoe with curiosity. Keno grabbed the paddle and wildly swung it against the ground while Meli rocked the boat. Soon however, they started pleading to the surrounding personnel for help. Apparently, their play had been interrupted by the perimeter fence. Finally, Dr. Linde conversed with them on the issue and was informed that a certain island had been \"overrun by Bigfeet\" and that the perimeter fence blocked the twins from reaching said island.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Test #:** 3 \n**Subject:** Lia & Juno Andersen\n**Place:** The siblings were supervised in a small wooded area. \n**Complementary Items:** No supplementary items.\n----\nThe siblings were encouraged to obtain that cone with cold cream in order to replicate the effects found during the observational period. However, the two were sceptical as there were \"more important things to do\". At last, Juno scouted the wood with more and more tension in his body. He started shouting incomprehensible words to nearby trees and started to claw at the ground screaming: \"They're all gone! All gone! They have fled! Come help us someone!\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Test #:** 4\n**Subject:** Sven Andersen\n**Place:** Outside the perimeters of Site-80.\n**Complementary Items:**  Upon the object's request, a knightly dagger. It is also of note that the object required the help of Dr. Linde in order for this test to be realized.\n----\nThe boy was supervised when he led Dr. Linde to a nearby creek. \"This is what we need to do. We need to cross this river...\" The young boy paused and looked for Dr. Linde's understanding. While the doctor looked admittedly puzzled on this ordeal, he had rather wanted the boy to show what he knew rather than return to the state he was in before; As such, Linde clumsily followed the boy across the creek on a few rocks. Suddenly, the two began a fearsome \"fight\", with an invisible being. While Dr. Linde had lost his composure and looked shocked at the same time, the young boy straddled around on the ground and in the grass. \"No!\" the boy shouted and started to weep. The sword he recently had held in his hand had broken in half.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n**Test #:** 5\n**Subject:** Siw Andersen\n**Place:**  Containment Chamber 55\n**Complementary Items:**  An assortment of toys suitable for toddlers such as a ball and various building blocks.\n----\nThe toddler had crept up by the window of her chamber when her carer came in with the toys. She met these new supplies with a joyous cackle, waddled towards them and picked the ball up. However, as she held it she slowly started looking around the room. She soon started crying. The ball was dropped and the toddler sat down on the floor. Dr. Linde intervened, and sat down with the toddler for a moment, briefly stating, \"You're not very magic are you, little one\" before he was suddenly startled. He looked around the room, and called for the testing to stop and that the carer take over.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum-8099-7: Excerpt from Dr. Linde's Log Book**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [BEGIN EXCERPT]\n----\n\nWorking with the children so far have led us to draw four conclusions. \n\nFirstly, the children are not capable of conjuring items of their own will. In general, they do not seem particularly strong.\n\nSecondly, our world is interpreted as just as real as theirs. \n\nThirdly, there is another world. However, if this world is conjured by the children, or existent all of itself is not clear. Being in contact with the object has allowed me to get brief glimpses of this world. It is a vast land with an impending threat threatening its nature and its people. Objects in this world have its own equivalent in the other world, a creek can become a river, a puddle can become a lake and a containment chamber can become a dungeon.\n\nFourthly, this impending threat has revealed characteristics such as empathy and playfulness. The children do not differ much in this regard to other human children.\n\nWith these conclusions in mind, I will recommend a lower level of classification and security protocol to be implemented.\n\n----\n= [END EXCERPT]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum-8099-8: Incident Log**\n\nJune 30th, 1910 SCP-8099 along with Ada Andersen escaped containment. Witnesses described an unstoppable force, which ripped apart doors and chambers for the children to run out into Site-80 grounds and onward. Security staff along with research lead Dr. Linde made their way out but were apprehended by a new perimeter fence and a man in a suit who stood waiting.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [OPEN LOG]\n----\n//The suited man had met Dr. Linde before and introduced himself as \"Stennja\" once again.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** It's... You?\n\n**Stennja:** I've come to collect my kids. I thought I'd let them have some fun with you but... This is a place of nightmares.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** You've... Collected them? Where have you taken them?\n\n**Stennja:** Somewhere you can't reach. Don't worry. They are safer, and most importantly, more stimulated than with you.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** What is your relation to these kids? You said they were yours? You know of their... Abilities, so to speak?\n\n**Stennja:** I've known them all their life. I have followed them ever since I left them.\n\n**Dr. Linde:** You, you were the one who left them there?\n\n**Stennja:** We, left them. Ada Andersen is a righteous being, with a heart of gold. We don't trust ourselves with raising our own spawn. And so, we leave them. We left all of them, as they'd be happy. As you've seen. \n\n//Dr. Linde pauses for a minute. Stennja puts his hat on to turn.//\n\n**Dr. Linde:** Could we, could we meet with them again? Could we talk more?\n\n**Stennja:** Not if you so tried. They are in our land now. It's time I head back too. It was nice meeting you doctor. \n\n**Dr. Linde:** I understand, but what if there could be some arrangement made, maybe-\n\n//When Dr. Linde looks up he notices that the suited figure has vanished.//\n\n----\n= [CLOSE LOG]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8099 have been unaccounted for since this incident in 1910 and no further documentation has been collected other than a single letter that Linde received in 1911.\n\n**Addendum 8099-9: Letter Addressed to Dr. Linde**\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n++++ ##blue|Deer Doctor Sven,##\n\n++++ ##blue|We ar home now.##\n\n++++ ##blue|The won tres cam back and we usd ther help and the geimflys to fait the enemy. it tok som time. now we live with stenja in his Castel. we got You a piture##\n\n++++ ##blue|You ar not veri scary doctor##\n\n++++ ##blue|can You ryite back##\n\n++++ ##blue|LOVE##\n\n++++ ##red|keno## \n++                   ##blue|siv## \n++++ ##red|Lars##                        ##pink|meli##       ##red|Lia##\n++++  \n++++ ##green|Sven##                                                    ##orange|JUNO##               \n++++ \n++++ \n\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/The_counties_of_England%2C_their_story_and_antiquities_%281912%29_%2814578403347%29.jpg]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8098]]] | SCP-8099 | [[[SCP-8100]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Name:** Tornersvärd, kort\n> **Author:** Livrustkammaren\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tornersv%C3%A4rd_Sverige_1776-1800,_klingan_Solingen_ca_1600-1650_-_Livrustkammaren_-_34720.tif\n> **Additional Notes:** \n\n> **Name:** Barn lekande vid ån\n> **Author:** August Malmström\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:August_Malmstr%C3%B6m_-_Barn_lekande_vid_%C3%A5n.jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** \n\n> **Name:** Lekande barn - sommar på fäbodvallen\n> **Author:** Allan Österlind\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Allan_%C3%96sterlind_-_Lekande_barn_-_sommar_p%C3%A5_f%C3%A4bodvallen.jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** \n\n> **Name:** Lekande pojkar på stranden\n> **Author:** Albert Edelfelt\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Edelfelt_-_Boys_Playing_on_the_Shore_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg#mw-jump-to-license\n> **Additional Notes:** \n\n> **Name:** Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, England Abstract/medium: 1 negative : glass ; 5 x 7 in. or smaller.\n> **Author:** Bain News Service, publisher - Library of Congress Catalog\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tattershall_Castle,_Lincolnshire,_England_LCCN2014689737.tif\n> **Additional Notes:** Cropped by me\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
