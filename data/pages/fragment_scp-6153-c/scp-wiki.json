The exception to this, however, 13 individuals, formerly the O5 council, designated SCP-6153-I through SCP-VIII. SCP-6153-I through SCP-6153-VIII all have estimated Tyche Radiation levels of over 10,000 times the previously theorized limit due to the amount of TCEDs to increase their already substantial Tyche levels. Every action the former council takes results in the absolute best outcome based on their intentions. Of note is that after the completion of the aforementioned event, a probabilistic anomaly occurred, causing SCP-6153-I through -XIII to gain class II or higher reality-warping abilities. \n\n**Incident report 6153-10/12/04:**\n\nDescription: On 10/12/22 the 05 Council began using an unknown amount of TCEDs containing positive Tyche Radiation to increase their own Tyche levels. This event was covered up with all footage being expunged from foundation records, current information regarding the event is speculation based on the aftermath and incident 11/15/04\n\n@@ @@\n**Incident Report 6153-11/15/04**\n\n**Description:** Following Incident Report 6153-10/12/04 (see above), the O5 council performed a thaumaturgical ritual created and overseen by O5-8, a class VII Thaumaturgist. The following recording of the event may have incomplete annotations, due to unknown factors of the ritual itself\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**<Begin Log, 23:50>**\n\n[13 unidentifiable figures (presumed to be the O5 council, due to the red numbers written the back of their clothing) wearing black hooded cloaks stand on the points of a large tridecagram[[footnote]]A star with 13 points[[/footnote]]composed of an unknown red powder.]\n\n**O5-12:** O, great Gods of Fortune, we come to request your favor and help in trials to come.

In addition, the current location of the O5 Council is unknown. It is currently theorized that the extreme Tyche levels present with them caused a spatial anomaly to occur around them, transporting them to an unknown location. Locating and attempting contact with Council members is now the top priority of the Department of Anomalous Probability.\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**STF Overwatch-5 (\"Fickle Fortune)**\nThe following 13 individuals are members of STF Overwatch-5.\n[[/=]]\n* O5-1, Firstname, Lastname\n* O5-2, Dr. Sophia Light, Head of MTF Alpha-9 (\"Last Hope\")\n* O5-3, Heimdall.aic, Class V Artificial Intelligence Construct\n* O5-4, Allison Chao, \"The Black Queen\"\n* O5-5, Placeholder Mcdoctorate, Head of the 'Pataphysics Department\n* O5-6, James Breckenridge, ex-UIU 7th Occult War Veteran and Para-arms Dealer\n* O5-7, Aden, former IJAMEA Field Agent and Shapeshifter  \n* O5-8, Dr. Hekatsu Roriarty, Class VII Thaumaturgist \n* O5-9, Dr Malcome Reese, Head of the Department of Anomalous Probability\n* O5-10, Dr. Thaddeus Xyank, Head of the Temporal Anomalies Department.\n* O5-11, Jane Mossbury, Head of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/disinformation-bureau-orientation Disinformation Bureau]: Mass Disappearance Department. \n* O5-12, Manuel Jameson, Class II Reality Warper, Ur-Nälkän Karcist\n* O5-13, Dr. Irving Gat, Site-⌘ Director \n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Note from the Administrator**\nHello.
