SCP-4446-A is stored inside a standard damp free containment container located on Site-12.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4446 is a 792x495 bitmap (.bmp) image of a Meißner Landschwein pig. In most cases SCP-4446 behaves as a normal .bmp file. These cases include copy and pasting, moving inside of SCP-4446-A, renaming and observing its code via any method.\n\nSCP-4446 cannot be deleted or edited. Any attempt to do so is prompted by an alert that sufficient administrative rights are needed, even if executed as an admin. Methods of bypassing this alert have so far been unsuccessful or resulted in non-anomalous duplicates of SCP-4446.\n\nThe anomalous effect of SCP-4446 occurs when observing it via any image viewing software that supports zooming by mouse clicks, key binds or buttons, including photo galleries, image editing softwares, games that use SCP-4446 as a texture and browsers.\n\nSCP-4446 can possibly be zoomed into indefinitely, as SCP-4446 is fractally defined. Each pixel that would normaly make up an image is itself an image of SCP-4446, and the 'pixels' making that sub-image up, are again images of SCP-4446. These sub-images are tinted accordingly.[[footnote]]Zooming into the snout, one would normaly find some black pixels. Although from afar this is the case, the further one zooms into any such black pixel, the more it lightens up and gains color. When the sub-image covers the entire viewing field, its colors are virtually identical to the original image. Zooming out reverses this effect.[[/footnote]]\n\nNotably some of these pixels depict something else than SCP-4446, albeit still related to pigs in some way. These are mostly different breeds and species of pigs, including wild boars, various landraces, bearded pigs, SCP-████ and others as well as text concerning pigs.\n\nZooming into a specific image (in other words any specific pixel) depicting something else than SCP-4446 will result in new sub-images being related to that specific image. See test logs for examples.\n\nZooming into SCP-4446 takes increasingly more effort for SCP-4446-A to process. SCP-4446-A becomes too slow to properly work with after a magnitude of roughly ████.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test Logs\" hide=\"- Test Logs\"]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Test 1]]\n> **Branch:**  Frontview of an unidentified Meißner Landschwein \n>\n> **Findings:** \n> * Image of a pig tongue\n> * Image of a Meißner Landschwein behind a fence\n> * Image of two Meißner Landschwein eating unidentifiable food\n>  * Further zooming reveals food is maize\n>  * Zooming also shows text spelling 'yuck'\n> * Image of a pig carcass hanging in a butcher shop\n> * Text spelling  'pig'\n> * Text spelling  'piqpie'\n>  * Image of a pie\n>  * Text spelling 'delicio'\n>  * Text spelling 'use'\n>   * Text spelling 'piq'\n>   * Text spelling 'bacon'\n>    * Image of bacon\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Test 2]]\n> **Branch:**  Visayan warty pig (abbreviation: VWP)\n> **Findings:** \n> * Image of hair similar to that of VWP\n>  * Image of multiple VWP hiding inside the flakes of dandruff of said hair\n>   * Another angle of the previous image\n> * Image of pig excrement\n> * Image of a VWP eating dirt\n> * Image of two VWP mating\n> * Image of a pig stomach\n> * Text spelling 'pig'\n> * Text spelling 'help'\n>  * Image of an expressionless cartoon VWP holding up a sign spelling 'help'\n>   * Image of the same VWP lying dead on the floor\n>    * Image of the same VWP rotting on the floor\n>     * Image of the same VWP's skeleton lying on the floor\n>  * Image of an expressionless cartoon VWP piglet holding up a sign spelling 'help'\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Test 3]]\n\n> **Branch:** A sleeping boar\n>\n> **Findings:**\n> * Image of a boar eating dirt\n> * Image of several boar piglets running around\n>  * Image of several boar piglets sleeping\n>  * Text spelling 'early'\n> * Image of two boars eating\n> * Image of a boar piglet being born\n> * Image of a boar tusk\n> * Image of several boars eating\n>  * Image of a boar stomach\n>   * Image of fishbones\n>   * Text spelling 'yum'\n> * Text spelling 'pig'\n> * Text spelling 'piq'\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Test 4]]\n> **Branch:**  Dr. Fisher alongside a Meißner Landschwein \n>\n> **Findings:** \n> * Image of a Meißner Landschwein  eating\n> * Image of a pig's eye\n>  * Text spelling 'look'\n> * Image of Dr. Fisher's face, smiling\n> * Image of a pig snout\n>  * Text spelling 'back'\n> * Image of three Meißner Landschwein standing in mud\n> * Image of a boar fighting a caveman\n> * Image of Dr. Fisher having intercourse with a Meißner Landschwein \n>  * Image of Dr. Fisher's face, ecstatic\n>   * Text spelling '████████ Farm'\n>   * Image of Dr. Fisher's face, content\n>    * Text spelling 'pig'\n\n> **Notes:** //Dr. Fisher requested the removal of these logs and permanent discontinuation of research on SCP-4446.
