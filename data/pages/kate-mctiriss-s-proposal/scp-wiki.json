It was the majority subjective opinion of SDECotW that the object believed to have been most recently designated SCP-001 should no longer be given an SCP designation, and should be stored in a standard high-value containment locker in Site-19.\n\nIt was the unanimous opinion of SDECotW that no objective claims or statements should be made in the main SCP-001 page of the Foundation Database under any circumstances, only verifiably true records of the opinions of Foundation governing bodies in the past.\n\nIt was the majority opinion of the O5 Council on May 3, 20██ that in the event that Entity Thaumiel, Dr. Mary Nakayama, or any entity claiming to be either makes contact with the SCP Foundation, they will be referred to the O5 Council for negotiation and cooperation. It was the majority opinion of the O5 Council that no efforts will be made at this time to neutralize Entity Thaumiel or the vulnerabilities of the SCP-001 database position.\n\n**Description:** It was the unanimous opinion of SDECotW and the O5 Council on May 3, 20██ that any statement of fact made on this specific SCP Foundation Database page **⦿/Procedures/001/SCP-001.ftml** becomes objectively true. The prior unanimous opinion of SDECotW and the O5 Council holds that modifications to this page have vast, and potentially infinite, Category–Aleph Room (\"Greatest Concern\") reality modification consequences; the prior unanimous opinion of SDECotW and the O5 Council held that no further testing on these effects is to occur due to the potential XK/CK/LK/VK/ZK/תK-Class Scenarios believed to be highly probable with said testing.\n\nIt was the unanimous opinion of SDECotW that other pages within the **⦿/Procedures/001/** portion of the Foundation Database have no anomalous effects, and that prior versions of the SCP-001 database leading to the believed discovery of SCP-001's effects and the possible creation of Entity Thaumiel are to be stored as subpages in this directory for reference.\n\nIt was the unanimous opinion of SDECotW that all blank spots on the Foundation database shall be checked for further Category–Aleph Room reality modification anomalies, and that only a series of 1,000 thoroughly checked database spots shall be available to Foundation personnel for the designation of new Special Containment Procedures at any given time.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ ⦿/Procedures/001/Past/Feb_18,_20██_1.ftml\" hide=\"▽ ⦿/Procedures/001/Past/Feb_18,_20██_1.ftml\"]]\n\n> **Foundation Database changelog:**\n> {{Creating new SCP documentation.

I closed my eyes.\n\nWhen I opened them, I was dry. I was well. I was in bed. At the door, a shining figure, a radiant light, hovered. It spoke to me with a voice that echoed in my mind, only. It said I had greater things to do.\n\nI never saw It again. But I kept going. I believed that God descended and saved me. And, joining the Foundation, how could I //not// believe? What else could explain the fact that we were still here, still marvelously, desperately, screamingly alive? How else could the fabric of our world, our Everything, withstand such things that we behold every day? Something was protecting us. I prayed to it every night for guidance. I never heard its voice again.\n\nI had been touched by God once, and that was a lifetime of fortune in one moment.\n\nBut when I changed the color of the nameplate on my desk just by hitting \"save\" on a text file, I realized something. The fabric of all things was open to me. I could put this power away, show you, conceal it. But...\n\nWhat if this was what saved me? What if this was what saves us all, every day, from the abyssal terrors that rip and rend at our world's fragile stability? What if me hitting \"Save\" on a text file was the birth of God?\n\nIf it's not, then I tried. If it is, then I am watching. I will try to steer things right. It will take time.\n\nWish me luck.\n\n//- MN//\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Kate McTiriss]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** mctiriss.header.png\n> **Name:** mctiriss.header.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Kate McTiriss]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kate-mctiriss-s-proposal\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
