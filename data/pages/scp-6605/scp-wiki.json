If located, SCP-6605 is to be returned to Site-19's cold storage facility.\n\nFollowing Incident 6605-2 (see Addendum 6605-2), D-86753 is to be monitored by increased security detail until cleared and released into the public per standard D-Class amnestic release protocol.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6605 was the severed left foot of D-86753, which had been removed from the lower leg during an altercation at Stateville Correctional Facility in Crest Hill, Illinois. Despite being disconnected from any other sections of a human body, SCP-6605 is still capable of locomotion. Autopsy of SCP-6605 shows that the vessels and arteries of SCP-6605 continue to pump blood throughout SCP-6605 despite not being connected to a heart or any secondary method of blood production. \n\nSCP-6605 was first discovered while D-86753 was still a resident of Stateville Correctional Facility, after they engaged another resident in an argument which escalated to hand-to-hand combat. During the altercation, D-86753 produced a switchblade which was immediately taken by their opponent and used to cut into their left achilles tendon. After D-86753 collapsed, their opponent used the blade to cut through the cartilage connecting the tibia and fibula to the talus.[[footnote]] During the shock, D-86753 took the blade from their opponent and slit the opponent's throat.[[/footnote]] D-86753 was taken to the facility's infirmary where they recovered and received a prosthetic foot. SCP-6605 was brought to the Foundation's attention after SCP-6605 jumped from its temporary cold storage container and continued in the direction of the infirmary's exit despite the achilles tendon presumably still having been severed.\n\nD-86753 was admitted as a member of D-Class personnel in order to test for correlating anomalous phenomena. \n\n\n**Addendum 6605-1:** Incidents\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Incident 6605-1\" hide=\"▼ Close Logs\"]]\n\n> **General Incident Report: 1/16/1985**\n> \n> **Involved Items/Persons:** SCP-6605, D-86753\n> \n> **Incident Description:** At 1235 hours, during the daily scheduled D-Class courtyard period, D-86753 shattered a window in Site-19's cold storage facility and was apprehended in the facility.[[footnote]] This occurred despite security footage showing D-86753 reading in the courtyard at the time. [[/footnote]] On inspection, SCP-6605 was found missing. D-86753 no longer wore a prosthetic but rather possessed a fully-functional left foot. D-86753 was interviewed, but showed no knowledge of how they arrived in the facility, nor the whereabouts of SCP-6605 or how they regained their foot. D-86753 was returned to their cell afterwards.\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Incident 6605-2\" hide=\"▼ Close Logs\"]]\n\n> **General Incident Report: 1/16/1985**\n> \n> **Involved Items/Persons:** D-86753, D-86753\n> \n> **Incident Description:** At 1247 hours, D-86753 was heard screaming from their cell. After inspection, D-86753 was found laying in their cell next to their own corpse. The corpse was identical to D-86753 except that its left foot had been severed and replaced with a prosthetic, and its neck had been slit open by a sharp object. D-86753 was found holding a shard of broken glass which had been covered in blood, presumably used to cut into the corpse's throat. D-86753's right arm was found to have been severed at the elbow. D-86753 was taken to the facility's infirmary, and the severed arm was taken to Site-19's cold storage facility. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6604]]] | SCP-6605 | [[[SCP-6606]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
