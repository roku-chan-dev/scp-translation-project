What starts as a pastiche of JoJo elements injected into the world of AWCY turns into an epic life-or-death struggle with excellent characters, meaningful stakes, and at its core, an examination of the individual struggling against the monolith that is oppressive culture.\n\nJude is a compelling character, but each of the allies and enemies that are encountered along the way are equally as well developed.  Best of all, it’s a short series that sticks the landing. As a bonus, the series does an excellent job with worldbuilding concerning magic and the anartist community - Highly recommended.\n++++ (Review by [http://www.scpwiki.com/grigori-karpin-s-author-page Grigori Karpin])\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ Underrated Choice\n\n[[div class=\"display-container second\"]]\n[[div class=\"tale-cover\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/BBMG4yO.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/penny-for-your-thoughts\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tale-desc\"]]\n+ Penny for Your Thoughts?\n++++ Written by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-wild-alces-alces-is-plugging Rex Atlas]\n[[>]]\n[[span style=\"background-color: #3578e5; color: #fff; padding: 4px 8px; border-radius: 15px; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: -1.5em;\"]]//And plus you know it's my lucky penny//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\nA nice little read about how a coin flip helps one make good, bad, questionable decisions.

She screamed as they pulled us into the van.//\n\n//I… I hit one of them.//\n\nA wonderful reading experience from start to finish, aided by the colorful presentation. It tugs on the heartstrings, no doubt because of its CupidCon origins, and manages to successfully squeeze emotion from a subject that's less touched upon on the SCP wiki - romance.\n\nIf you've ever felt like you've missed someone, and you never knew exactly why, this is a tale for you.\n++++ (Review by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-dune-s-personnel-file J Dune])\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab October]]\n+ Pick of the Spooky Month\n\n[[div class=\"display-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"tale-cover\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/4z4xydl.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/death-perception\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tale-desc\"]]\n+ Death Perception\n++++ Written by [[[dr-arvind-desais-personnel-file|A Random Day]]] and [[[tygently-author-page|TyGently]]]\n\n//\"Thirty minutes ago, I recalled the memory of a woman telling me not to waste my food,\" said Munru, accepting a can from Irantu. \"It felt like a memory of our mother.\"//\n\nJoin the ever-curious Mobile Task Force \"Samsara\" on this Halloween adventure, as they set out to write bad fanfiction, join a seance, summon terrible angry spirits, and maybe find out a bit more about themselves.\n\nTerrifically written, Death Perception takes our out-of-this world characters to tell a grounded story about self-discovery, and how things naturally go on a (comparatively) supernatural day.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab December]]\n+ Pick of the Month\n\n[[div class=\"display-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"tale-cover\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/nF6vPir.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hecatoncheires-cycle-hub\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tale-desc\"]]\n+ Hecatoncheires Cycle\n++++ Written by [[[grigori-karpin-s-author-page|Grigori Karpin]]]\n\n//When he finally stood to leave that abattoir of his own invention, he turned and looked at me.
