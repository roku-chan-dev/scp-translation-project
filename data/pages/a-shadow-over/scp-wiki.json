The play was\nThe Passion and The Glory: A biography on the trials of the Hanged King;\nthough many had told the tragedy, none had told the triumph,\nwhich was the most important part.\n\nThe assemblage was to take place in the carnival city's porno theatre:\nIt was the shade on the street corner of every yellow-bellied brain stem between the Ichor and Leech Districts, on the\navenue between Sodom and Amalek. The theatre was\nmost akin to a medical operating theatre; there were as many seats as beings in the city and then some; and it was housed in great rows extending upwards and upwards like shingles on a roof;\nThe tingle of skin on skin as the city filed in to watch--\n\nOn the stage were the Lords\nand in the back of the theatre on the biggest throne in the realm:\nThe throne of the Hanged King, it was a visage of a Cross to which His black robes\nwere stapled to, and too, was He trapped in it by chains; the only freedom He could enjoy was\nto move and squirm and jiggle His thighs, for the chains were bound around His pectorals;\nAround His head, too, was a sweatband that would keep the hair out of His eyes, and on His eyes were the scalpels, which kept His eyelids free and moisturized with His own Blood.\n\nAs His moisture seeped into the seat and then the ground below it, the lights dimmed with click after click.\n\nThe audience's moaning and loving wails faded into nothing;\n[[=]]\n**II**\n[[/=]]\nThe play had thus begun-- the Lords assembled in the shadows of the set, and when\nThe flaming lights illuminated them once again, they revealed six Crosses of which\ndummies and dolls were stacked upon, cut into and pierced by sharp metal, attached to the Crosses thusly; and they took up 3 of the Crosses, the furthermost back ones, and there was one in the center which was empty.\n\nThe stage light was eclipsed with a long black disc, and the porno theatre was caked in an eerie glow;\nThe Lord in Marrow stepped from behind this center Cross;\nHe spoke, \"In Christ in I is there change, and the possibility of endlessness, and the eternal soul is that: For there is something beyond this life, yes, the After-World, where you can always see the sun, day, or night.\"\nThe eclipse fluttered.\n\"I am not to survive this day as declared by that Roman Pharoah; I have been starved and beaten and torn and things have been put inside Me;\"\nHe stepped forward once again and showed his nakedness in the night, his large cock swung between his thighs.\nAs the wind passed between his legs his hefty ballsack made a sort of whistling noise, like the squealing of a pig, and they resembled this in fact, the seam of his ballsack had been torn, so it resembled a pig's nose.\nSomething oozed from it thus.\n\n\"They have been put inside Me! This Holy Spirit has entered My body upon My baptism, and leaves me today, for I will die and I will die horribly, and slowly.\"\n\nHe bowed his head and knelt before the Cross, facing the audience, and the three other lords emerged behind him.\n\nThe Lord of Shit touched his chest and rubbed him in a familial way,\nThen her hand grazed his cock and she fluttered away like a moth in the night, and akin to this, she had left the trail of her sludge upon the ground.\nThe Lord of Urine too emerged and touched his chest but did not touch his cock, she merely ducked beneath him and came upon the audience as a moth's silhouette.\n\n\"This Christ must die!\" She bellowed, and the Hanged King flinched.\n\"And we shall do it in the ancient way, in the way of consumption,\"\n\nAnd the Lord of Menstruality emerged with a red plastic tank with a handle and an X inscribed on it.\n[[=]]\n**III**\n[[/=]]\nThe Lord of Marrow was slashed and rubbed down with the embalming massage oil:\nPure petrol; unrefined oil from the blue-crackling cracks down beneath the sea;\nthe sea was filled with the digestive toils of the ancient ones, what we would so pitifully\nuse to build cars and tractors and metal machine men\nwhen we could've and should've been getting naked and lighting ourselves on fire.\n\n\"If it shall need be, O Father,\nThen allow Me to be Your holocaust:\"\n(said the Lord of Marrow)\n\n\"If the world shall need a sacrifice, then let Me burn, and My ashes become the Soil.\"\n\nHis body was covered in flame, gasoline dribbling down the seam of his nutsack;\nThey had fattened in the heat, sweating excessively\nAnd the Lord of Marrow fell to his knees his head cradled by his own knees as he was burned, screaming, tarnishing, wailing, and then went silent:\n\nHis penis had become erect, only visible in\nthe stage light for its disjointedness from the rest of the darkened floor\nand the audience gasped and watched in silent awe: The Lord crossed\nhis arms and began to rise upon his very heels, and then\nhe spread his arms wide, and in the dark appeared to be\na large moth or beast: And he swung his hips in the shade.\n\nThe lights on the stage hummed up and\nThe Lord of Marrow was reborn!\nThe Lords of Urine, Menstruality, and Shit gathered him up in their robes\nand doused him, and they all rose together to smile\nand they then returned to the ground: bowed to thunderous applause.\n[[=]]\n**IIII**\n[[/=]]\nThe Hanged King cheered wildly from His lich-throne:\nDeep in the backhand of the audience; He applauded and\nwhooped and smacked His big thighs, jiggling them\nand the mighty flesh meat wobbled deliciously.\n\"Yes, yes,\"\n\"This was brilliant,\"\nHe rolled over His back and rolled again;\n\"But I've one note for you, Lord of Marrow, for I have seen but One inaccuracy;\"\n\nSo the Hanged King gripped the seam of his robes\nand threw them off at once, in a great heap;\nHe spread his jiggling thighs and unveiled\nHis most soggy and stinking pussy; unwashed and unshaven,\nso thick it physically wafted through its big kissable lips\nas a current of white dancing steam.\n\n\"I would never ask you to mutilate your self, Lord of Marrow,\nthough I say: You are overdressed!\"\n\nThe four lords and the Hanged King alike threw their heads back\nin deep belly-laughter, and in suit, as did the audience; for there was a merriness in the night\nthat was not bound by their whiskey nor moonshine nor poppers nor molly; it was\nas simple as the sight of that unwashed, quivering thing, taking in its erotic scent, and it was\nthe closeness to--\n\nThe audience filed out quietly into an unlit street\nto find the moon had begun to peak out from the crowds;\nShe whispered,\n\"Goodnight, you,\"\n\"Goodnight, //you//,\"\n\"Goodnight,\"\n\"Goodnight,\"\n\"Goodnight,\ngoodnight, yes, goodnight.\"\n\n\"And goodbye, till 'morrow.\"\nO sweet love;\nOsiris and Oracle, if you only knew\nhow much that 'morrow meant, for:\n[[=]]\n**IIIII**\n[[/=]]\nIn the still of the night,\nfive satins were ruffled by the window sill,\nand in the yellow sky, a [[[illcovetyouifyoucoverme |black sun]]]\nbegan to rise over a silent day.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
