Isn't that right, little Chel? Since she's been with us, our work environment has changed a lot - it has changed so much that anyone would swear Chel can alter our mood with her mind! But she can't, she's just very sweet with everyone.\n\nThe first thing you need to know about Chel to get her attention is her favorite food: Nothing! Our little turtle doesn't eat breakfast, doesn't eat lunch, and doesn't eat dinner - and she still stays at the right weight! Seriously, we've tried everything, but she refuses to eat even the smallest gram. Well, more for the rest of us!\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, whenever you are feeling down, Chel will be there! I don't know how she does it, but every time someone on the team is overwhelmed, either by their family or because some other creature has fallen ill, Chel comes to the rescue! She comes swimming up to be as close to us as she can and stays that way until all our anguish is gone, she is such a sweetheart!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nWe first met Chel when- Chel came to us- Chel...\n\nDoes it really matter how we met Chel? Of course not! All we need to know is that she's now part of our lives, and that should be enough, you all hear?!\n\nOliver is in charge of her, but he's also a real sweetheart! He lets us play with her for as long as we want - there have even been days when I spend the whole day at Chel's side! It seems like Oliver isn't even there, but of course, at the end of the day he comes back to check on Chel. He is very passionate about what he does -  his dream was always to take care of a turtle! It's his favorite animal - well, he loves them all equally, but his love for turtles is what prompted him to become part of our family at WWS.\n\nI can only imagine his face when Chel showed up! He- He was assigned- Chel- Errr...\n\nI think we lost some of Chel's paperwork, but it doesn't matter, that way anyone can imagine their own story! Maybe Chel used to fight dragons? Or maybe she was part of the Secret Service and is now hiding out with us? Well-! No no no. Something is wrong. I have to ask Oliver about it, in the meantime just imagine that Chel has an amazing and awesome origin story!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nChel doesn't really need much. Except for the fact that she doesn't eat anything, she's just like any other sea turtle. We have her in a HUGE tank where she can swim around and receive all our love!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Chel!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nYep. I've been checking and it looks like we're missing some of Chel's documentation. Well, actually I've been asking the rest of the team and it seems that... no one remembers when or how Chel arrived at Marine Enclosure 3. I haven't been able to contact Oliver, but it shouldn't be long until he arrives. I'm sure it's just a big mix up and Oliver will clarify it all, it's obvious!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nFrom: Sophia Wallace\nTo: Oliver Pericles\nDate: 22/03/2021\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nOllie? Um... You haven't come to check on Chel, are you okay? If anything happens you know you can talk to me about it, but you can't just skip work. The rest of the team and I agreed to have your back, but we need you to tell us what happened.\n\nBy the way, I've finished writing Chel's file, as you asked me to do, although I discovered that there are some gaps. In fact, we all have gaps in our heads - how did we discover Chel, Ollie? I can't leave the file like this - I can't be left without knowing. Ollie, what's going on?\n\nChel has been very nervous without you, and she hardly lets herself be seen, hiding among the rocks of her habitat. She's afraid, I can see it in her eyes. You're not involved in anything dangerous, are you? I don't want Chel to be in danger, Ollie. You have to come back, soon.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nFrom: Sophia Wallace\nTo: Oliver Pericles\nDate: 26/03/2021\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nOllie, we need to talk, in person, urgently. I don't know why you're not coming to work, but if you don't, we're coming to your house by ourselves.\n\nYesterday, Miguel decided to take action and went into your office to go through your things. He shouldn't have, I know, but he found... your diary. What do you mean, the whole \"it's eating me up\" thing? And the \"it won't come out of my thoughts\" thing? My God, you've got whole pages covered in the word \"thoughts\"!\n\nOllie, I need you to tell me what's going on. What... what is Chel? Please, Ollie, come back. We're - I'm scared. What did you get involved in? \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nChel Incident [27/03/2021]\nEntered by: Sophia Wallace\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nI don't know how to describe what happened. I really don't know.\n\nMiguel, Andrew and I decided to go to Oliver's house after he'd missed several days of work. He lived in a small apartment on the outskirts of town; it took us about an hour to get there, and by the time we arrived it was getting dark - I wish we could've done it sooner, but we had some animals to take care of first. We'd never been to visit him before, so it took us a while to get to his apartment number. When we did, we knocked on the door, but no one answered.\n\nWe waited for a while, until Miguel suggested that we pick the lock. Andrew didn't like the idea, but I managed to convince him after showing him Oliver's diary - specifically, the part where he described- look, I'm just going to transcribe it:\n\n> \"//17/03/2021//\n> \n> I have been concerned for a few days now. I have previously mentioned the extenuating lack of turtles where I work. I have also mentioned and described how much I would love to be assigned to work with a turtle - they really are //beautiful//.\n> \n> The problem is - I started to imagine a turtle recently. I did it out of boredom, more than anything else. Like those characters you come up with when you start daydreaming, and maybe later use to make a short story or even a fanfic of some sort.\n> \n> Anyway, I started to imagine a sea turtle named Chel. Calm, affectionate, empathetic... Everything someone would want in a pet. I even drew her a couple of times, on some loose papers I had lying around. Everything I did was normal, I guess. No big deal.\n> \n> Thing is - //Chel is real//. A few days ago, when I came to work. Chel was there, being cared for by one of my coworkers. When I approached - somehow, I'm Chel's primary caretaker, always have been. Everyone in there has known her since always, and is also fond of her- No, this shouldn't be possible. I'm scared. I have to put my thoughts together, I don't-\n> \n> I can't do this anymore. There are more and more gaps in my memory - names, places, whole memories that disappear every time I try to access them. I don't know what's going on, I need help, I need-\n> \n> Help.\"\n\nOnce he finished reading it, Andrew nodded and Miguel picked the lock with a small wire he brought with him. Oliver was... sitting on the floor, in a corner, next to his bed, shaking. We approached him slowly, more out of instinct than anything else. He was whispering, but we couldn't make out what he was saying.\n\nI reached out to touch his shoulder, but all I got were more whispers and meaningless words.\n\nAlthough... there was actually one sentence that I did understand, and that I wish I hadn't:\n\n//\"It screams for me. It wants to stay. It's screaming to stay. I don't want to follow its pattern.\"//\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nFrom: Tim Wilson\nTo: Marine Enclosure 3 Personnel\nDate: 28/03/2021\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n\nI am sorry for everything that happened. I can assure you that everything will be fine, there is nothing to worry about; I took the liberty of contacting the Foundation and, well, from now on they will take care of the matter.\n\nThe relevant documentation will be destroyed shortly, and some may have to be amnestized, like Mr. Pericles, but believe me it is for your own good.\n\nI'm truly sorry.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Chel.jpg\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** Structuro\n> **License:**  CC0\n> **Source Link:** https://pixabay.com/photos/sea-turtle-turtle-aquarium-sea-485825/\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
