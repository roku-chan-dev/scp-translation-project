Shelves the size of skyscrapers boil over with white flame, outshining sunlight. To look at it even side-on overflows Errata's eyes with epiphoric tears, only for the skin-searing heat to dry them just as quickly. The air swims. Dark spots dance. Somewhere very far away, a serpent screams.\n\nFigures emerge from the blaze, each aflame. Their skin melts and bubbles like candle wax, sloughing away from blackened, matchstick bones. Smoke wreathes their limbs like barbed wire. \n\nThough their faces have become so much kindling, Errata can recognize these people. They are ghosts, twice-over -- the victims of the crime that banished him from the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | Hand]]].

If you can get past the pesky soul, a living human is considered the finest tool in anomalous puppetry; while corpses will do for a time, there is just something about a living slave that makes the theatre that much more engaging. For a human puppeteer, there is no greater goal.\n\nHeather Garrison, unfortunately, found herself in the role of the puppet. She was always the puppet, the performer, the fool at the end of the world. An orchestral swell deafened her, as her strings went taut, her joints straining. As the music continued, she was jerked around, arms pulled asunder, legs forced into the splits, the roar of a merciless crowd leering on. She moved in perfect timing. The practiced hand of her manipulator was not the only reason for her preternatural tempo; her body knew what to do. Instinctive. Animalistic.\n\nRoutine.\n\nShe knew the dance by heart, had trodden the same floorboards, note by note, each time an exact replica of the last. And worst of all, she knew how it ended.\n\nThe strings pulled tighter still, twisting around her body like a python squeezing the life out of its prey. Her limbs cracked, as she smiled, the crowd sneering, spitting on her, with their hate-filled eyes. Her own arms, choking herself, the puppeteer caring not for the tool; after all, she was replaceable. There was nothing special about her.\n\nHer strings were cut. Heather collapsed in a heap, crumpled, broken, abandoned like detritus. Trapped, on the edge of [[span style=\"color: rgba(130,81,145,0.7); text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px #848484;\"]]nothingness[[/span]], discarded from her role.

Many a citizen has shed their mask, and those who haven't feel it seared into their face, melting with their flesh.\n\nNam stumbles through the streets, hot stones burning his feet. He steps on a mask, and it cracks beneath his foot. Alagaddans flock the street, running towards the central theatre. There is nowhere else to run.\n\nNam enters. The theatre is quiet, the bedlam outside not permeating its walls. This is a place of serenity, of calm. Every seat is filled with Alagaddans, staring at the stage, waiting in anticipation.\n\nFinally, a group of actors walk onto the stage. They are dressed brightly, for they are to enact their [[[SCP-701|beloved play]]] for the final time. The lead actor begins to proclaim the first words of the passage, but freezes. He is unable to speak. All the other actors realise their breath and voice has been taken away from them, and begin writhing on the stage. A cacophony spreads among the crowd, the peace and quiet at once shattered. \n\nThat is enough invitation for the flames to enter, taking the building at once. There is no more peace in this place. As the building collapses, the final words of the Hanged King's Tragedy reverberate throughout the structure.\n\n\"Oh woe, for a King to befell such a fate!

Its face, grotesque and unnatural, twisted into a smile that oozed malevolent delight as it took in the sight of the children, each one trembling like leaves in the wind.\n\nIts gaze fell upon Alex, its eyes gleaming as the wicked grin widened, stretching impossibly across its face.\n\nA cold terror gripped Alex, freezing him in place as if his bones had turned to lead.\n\nAround him, the silence shattered with the piercing scream of a child who tried to flee, but the crooked creature moved faster than thought, its long fingers coiling around the boy’s neck like a predator’s snare. The child’s struggles were brief, his eyes bulging and blood spilling from his nose before his head met the floor with a bone-cracking thud that echoed through the room, painting the walls with panic.\n\nBlood splattered like ink, and screams erupted as the children scattered, some rushing toward exits that seemed to warp and retreat, while others vanished behind furniture, futile in their hiding.\n\nTheir cries for help hung in the air, sharp and jagged, but only served to draw the creature’s attention. The creature moved with cruel precision, as it began stuffing the squirming, screaming children inside a huge sack as if they were nothing more than toys.\n\nOne by one, their muffled screams vanished into the blackened maw of the sack, except for Alex, who remained frozen, limbs locked by terror, holding an abomination of a present, tears cutting tracks down his cheeks as the crooked man loomed before him.\n\nThat same wicked smile still plastered on its twisted face, it patted Alex’s head with a mockery of gentleness before dragging the bag of writhing bodies into the night.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** Dr. Michael Prescott\n\n**BOX:** [[[SCP-8035|Foraoise na Damanta]]]\n\n**WITNESS:** [[*user Merehrab]]\n\n----\n\nHe ran. \n\nAs fast as he could, Michael sprinted through the knotted and tangled branches, the darkness of the forest nearly overtaking him. He felt the adrenaline pumping through his veins, and he never stopped running, even when his legs felt like they were going to melt off him.\n\nAll around him, he could see shadows of the people he failed. He promised them that he wouldn’t slip up. He promised his clients that he would make their lives better, even while being trapped in a prison cell. He promised them //all// that he would not let them down. That he would finally learn from his constant mistakes.\n\nBut promises are not fulfilled by default. And he knew that. Deep down, he knew that he would never reach the heights that he so desperately wanted.\n\nMichael kept running, until he was stopped in his tracks. An entity stood ahead of him, in the darkness. It wore a black trenchcoat and a black fedora, and its eyeless sockets bore a black void that stared deeply into Michael’s soul.\n\n“You— you’re supposed to be dead!”\n\nIt simply laughed. “Now you know how it feels, Doctor. To fail. We are all happy to welcome you here.” Its wicked smile stretched and twisted to places that couldn’t even be conceived of.\n\nThe shadows descended upon him, and he tried to scream for help, but it was too late.

It couldn't remember the last 24 hours.\n\nAround its eyes was a blindfold, around its wrists and ankles, shackles. Covered in rust, the shackles dug into its skin as it tried to move even an inch. They kept is suspended and spread, unable to move its wrists or even touch its own flesh again.\n\nWith time, it found out that its biological needs were gone. It didn't need to eat, drink or sleep. Even breathing became obsolete.\n\nSo the only thing it was left with now was its thoughts. Its memories began to fade and blend into each other, shapes began to appear in the darkness. At times, it even felt like it could see something behind the cloth around its eyes. But there was nothing. It knew that soon it would be left with nothing, so it clung onto each hardly comprehensible memory, each monster its mind dreamt up in the darkness. Confusion and dread were all it knew, and soon, all it could comprehend.\n\nBut the bliss of oblivion never came. Its thoughts mixed with each other, new monsters appeared to haunt and tease it. So, in tears and terror, it clung onto all that existed to it, no matter how repulsive and terrifying. \n\nAnd it would continue to. It had a whole eternity left, after all.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** Dr. Christopher Byrnes\n\n**BOX:** [[[SCP-8980|Site-17, Northwest Wing]]]\n\n**WITNESS:** [[*user Yossipossi]]\n\n----\n\nDr. Christopher Byrnes does not notice it at first.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, reality to Byrnes is perfectly intact. He is attending a meeting. They are discussing an important topic. Higher mathematics, how to use such-and-such principle in such-and-such a way to do such-and-such a thing for the benefit of mankind. All very important work; all very important, big things worth suppressing the bitterness over.\n\nVarious coworkers flank him, several of whom he does not like. Lillian Marley. Agatha Bauer. Rachel Steele. Each one has their own unique way of making him upset. Rachel is a bitch. Agatha sneers at him whenever they lock eyes. Marley wants nothing to do with him, but everyone wants everything to do with her. They sit at the table, discussing the formulae before him, as though they were more knowledgeable on the subject than the presenter. More knowledgeable than him.\n\nHe speaks. He doesn't quite remember the exact words. Something along the lines of, \"I believe we should be getting back on track. That curve reminds me of a Gajos-Riemannian Manifold, doesn't it?\" But he doesn't get to continue; immediately, someone else is talking over him. A man named... Mitchel McPharrell, was it? He discusses the manifold, plugging in numbers. There's a breakthrough. The logic flows. His coworkers cheer.\n\nFor a brief moment, Byrnes smiles, but the passion fades as soon as it's apparent no one is looking at him. They're looking at this McPharrell, applauding a black man for //his// work. He pales. He tries to speak, but he can't find the words that will right this wrong. No one even glances in his direction. His lips close.\n\nIt doesn't matter. He'll have his moment, he muses to himself. It's just a setback. A misunderstanding.\n\nByrnes is sitting at his desk. He is typing away at some routine paperwork. He's ready to finally go back to his dorm and rest. It's been a long day. The incident from earlier has put him in a sour mood. No one took his frustration seriously, which simply served to frustrate him more. He can practically feel the steam emerging from his ears.\n\nHe feels a //thump// on the desk by his right. He turns. There is a small stack of papers now, a feminine hand resting upon them with little fanfare. He looks up. Cold Steele gazes at him, looking at him with total disregard, then speaks.\n\n\"We got the results from the latest round of 4051 testing. If you could log them for me real quick, it'd be a pleasure.\"\n\nHe can feel the fury in his chest. Who does she think she is? She's not his boss. She doesn't have any right to pass off //her// job to //him//. He can only stop his rage at the thought of what happened last time he lost his cool. He bites his tongue. This will pass. He'll find a way to make her pay.\n\n//Maybe he should smile more.//\n\nBy the time he finishes contemplating, she's already clocked out. He begins entering the logs. There will be no recompense for this crime.\n\nThings only seem to become more insidiously deigned to infuriate him as the days turn to weeks. Backhanded compliments at his competency. Dismissal of his work as unimportant, while in the same breath glorifying his coworkers. Talking over him when he had essential information to share. Stealing credit for his own hard work. Using his things without permission. \n\nWhen Marley got Level 4 credentials before him, he just barely stopped himself from smashing his computer in anger. He could //feel// the smugness in her eyes as she shook his hand, knowing he could not say anything for risk of retaliation. She did not bother to turn back to look at him as she walked out of their division for the last time.\n\nAnd then it all comes to a head. He's grabbing lunch from the site cafeteria. It is not satisfying, but he needs to eat. He did not pack his own food, because he has not had time to buy something for himself. He is stressed, frustrated, and overworked. No one seems to care, which pisses him off more. Not even his therapist can empathize.\n\nThe world spins briefly. He doesn't even realize what happened as his food falls to the floor. He stumbles forward, pulling his senses together as someone walks past on his left. He makes two simultaneous realizations, followed by a third:\n\n# The person walking past him is Agatha Bauer.\n# He feels a sting in his ass.\n\nHis face flushes with indignation as Agatha smiles wickedly and knowingly at him, before walking off. No further acknowledgement. Little to no care.\n\nBefore he can fully compose himself, Byrnes realizes that everyone is watching //him//. \n\nHis face darkens. Several people watching laugh, several others turn away in second-hand embarrassment. Someone cheers. He runs back to his office, without lunch, disregarding the mess on the floor. He is penalized for causing a ruckus. He files a report; it goes nowhere. They tell him Agatha is not the kind of woman who would do that. He makes complaints; they are disregarded. He needs to learn to take a joke, they tell him. He feels as though he has gone mad. The world has turned into a machine that maximizes his inadequacy while demanding competency.\n\nPerhaps it has, by this point. But the madness only deepens its hold. By the end of the first few months, he has learned to stomach the indignation. All resistance, even the most minor of critiques, is met with fierce pushback. He stuffs himself deeper, biding his time, waiting for an opportunity to strike back. It will never arrive. The system is ever-present, ever-watching.\n\nYears into the nightmare, the disrespect has become a background noise for him. He does his job, but there is merely a passive resentment now — a far cry from the fire that burned inside him when he first joined. He watches his ambition get snuffed out in real time, fully aware of it and yet powerless to stop it. He fights a foe with no physical front line, yet one that encompasses him completely.\n\nBy the end of the first few decades, he does not recognize his coworkers anymore. They are all much younger than him. They rise in leaps in bounds while he is left to drudge, barely able to meet the deadlines. They harass him, mock him openly, and know he will not fight back. He has been left to rot for a purpose totally opaque to him. There is no method to the madness that he can ascertain.\n\nPerhaps after a century passes, he will come to realize just what exactly is happening to him. Perhaps he will realize that the world itself //has// come to despise him for sincerely no valid reason. Perhaps he'll discover what he's //truly// experiencing.\n\nAnd once he realizes, the agony will only get worse.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\" style=\"border: 4px solid var(--accentColor);\"]]\n\n**SUBJECT:** Containment Specialist Lillian Marley\n\n**BOX:** [[[SCP-8980|Humanoid Containment Chamber #β082, Section 6, Northwest Wing, Site-17]]]\n\n**WITNESS:** [[*user Yossipossi]]\n\n----\n@@ @@\n= Same as it ever was.

At first she didn't know what had woken her up, but when her ears were pierced again by a tearing, sharp and recognisable sound, she cringed. It was a cry, her daughter's cry. She still couldn't accept this child, even saying the word \"daughter\" out loud was a challenge for her. Slowly, without wanting to, she threw back the simple white blanket, put her feet down on the wooden floor and sighed bitterly. Sofia hadn't liked the idea of motherhood before, she'd never wanted it, never wanted to have children or build a family at all. But she couldn't defend her position either. Sophia had known all her life that her mother was a callous and rigid person who did not put anyone's interests at stake, but she simply did not have the strength to resist her. Sofia had never been able to argue with her mother, never been able to say \"no\". So when her mother 10 years ago told her to stop spending time with her friends Sofia obeyed, so when her mother 5 years ago told her to stop seeing her boyfriend Sofia obeyed, and now, exactly a year ago when her mother told her that abortion is not allowed Sofia obeyed. Another scream pulls her out of the flood of painful memories. Gritting her teeth, Sofia stood up and walked towards the children's bed. Her steps were tentative, slow and shaky and she understood why - her whole subconscious, her whole soul does not want to go near the bed. For Sophia knows that inside lies it, her spawn, her creation, her little monster. Sophia never liked children, in fact she hated them; their small, underdeveloped hands that twitch at random, their dense, caterpillar-like bodies, their strange, unnaturally fresh skin, their big mouths that are always open in a scream - all this made her feel disgusted. Even the thought that she herself had once been something like that made her shudder. So when after the birth she was brought the same piece of disproportionate flesh and told that it was her daughter, she could barely keep herself from weeping. Another scream cuts through her hearing, another flood of memories interrupted and brushed aside. Sophia's hands slowly take the screaming creature in her hands and lift it up and freeze. In these few months Sophia never got used to it, in all this time she never took it any other way - breastfeeding, that's the worst part of it all. The feeling of those worm-like fingers clawing at her breasts, the feel of that small, oddly flickering tongue against her nipple, the pain of those toothless jaws closing on her breasts, greedily squeezing their food out of her body - all of this tormented her mind time after time. Sleepless nights and tormented days, sleepless and tormented days - all this merged into a cacophony of images and places, depriving Sofia of the last semblance of stability. She wanted to run away and forget about it forever, she wanted to tape her ears and sew up her child's mouth, to set fire to this house with all insides, to do anything to make it end, anything to make all of it finally end. But she couldn't, she was still too weak,too fragile to do anything. Sofia takes a breath and closes her eyes, her hands beginning to shake even more as she finally brings the baby to her chest. \"Just a little more and it will be over, just a little more and it will be over,\" she whispers to herself like a mantra as the organism in her arms gets down to business. The sensations of her saliva-covered tongue and the rhythmic movements of her mute jaws overtake all other senses. It's disgusting, it hurts, there's nothing beautiful about it. But this time something was different, along with the usual feelings came something else. Pulling and distant, it turns into a sharp pain in a few seconds. Sophia screams and clutches at the child's body, trying to pull her away, but instead of pliable flesh, her fingers find only something that looks like rubber, wax, clay, anything but living flesh. The mass moves in response to her touch, trembling like a sack with a mass of oysters inside. Fear instantly turns from a quiet whisper at the edge of consciousness to a deafening scream in her head, Sophia's throat dries up and she falls on her back. The creature bites her chest harder and harder, blood staining her clothes scarlet. The taste of blood fills her throat, Sofia's screams turn into a low howl as the creature rumbles up her body. Pain consumes the woman's consciousness and with her last strength she grabs the creature with both hands and throws it aside. Her daughter's body hits the wall completely silently. Body's skin dries almost instantly and it's face slumps as hundreds of large insects crawl out of the crack in it's back. Sophia crawls off to the side, chunks of flesh spilling out of the hole in her chest. She screams in terror and her daughter's head screams with her.\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
