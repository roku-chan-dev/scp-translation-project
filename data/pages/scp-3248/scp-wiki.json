During SCP-3248-1 events, the windows of SCP-3248 are to be sealed, and soundproofing equipment within SCP-3248 is to be activated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3248 is a two story house located in Evansville, Indiana. SCP-3248 was previously owned by Dr. Herald Sullivan, a medical practitioner specializing in surgery. No links between Dr. Sullivan and any other anomalous phenomena have been discovered.\n\nOn the 10th of every month at exactly 0400 hours local time, an SCP-3248-1 event will begin. The interior of the house will be remodeled to resemble its appearance on October 10th, 1979. Furniture will appear and disappear during this period, and any personnel within SCP-3248 during an SCP-3248-1 event are considered lost until its conclusion. Entry into SCP-3248 is impossible at this time.\n\nDuring an SCP-3248-1 event, Dr. Sullivan and his family[[footnote]]His wife, Bertha Sullivan, and his two children, James Sullivan and Mark Sullivan.[[/footnote]] will materialize in their beds, and awake soon afterwards. The family will set up their house for an upcoming party with several colleagues and friends. The party will commence at approximately 1800 hours local time. Guests will materialize at the front step of SCP-3248, and will be allowed in.\n\nAll SCP-3248-1 events have been nearly identical, save for the occurrence of an SCP-3248-2 event. At some point during the festivities, one of the partygoers will murder Dr. Sullivan. The method of murder and the partygoer that commits the murder has differed for every SCP-3248-2 event. The partygoers will react with shock, and will attempt to call authorities or, in some cases, attempt to leave[[footnote]]It is of note that SCP-3248 cannot be exited after the SCP-3248-2 event.[[/footnote]]. The SCP-3248-1 event will always end at midnight[[footnote]]Similarities between SCP-3248-1 events and the scripts of [[[SCP-453]]] has been noted. An investigation into whether the two anomalies are derivatives of the same phenomenon is ongoing.[[/footnote]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"View Attachment: Abridged Event Timeline\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\nThe Foundation has been aware of SCP-3248's anomalous properties since its discovery in 1985. An abridged log of SCP-3248-1 and SCP-3248-2 events have been documented below. For a full log, please contact Project Supervisor Mel or the on-duty HCML supervisor.\n\n||~ Date||~ Murderer||~ Cause of Death||~ Notes||\n||09/10/1985||Gary Gerald||Gunshot to the forehead with a Glock-18 pistol, while Dr. Sullivan was drinking a bottle of alcohol.||First observed instance of SCP-3248-2||\n||10/10/1985||Matthew Dennis||Gunshot to the stomach with a different model of pistol.||Dr. Sullivan tries to call the police for help, but expires before he can reach the phone.||\n||03/10/1986||Rachael Johnston||Gunshots along Dr. Sullivan's left arm.

All were also patients of Dr. Sullivan at one point.\n* Further investigation using advanced autopsy procedures on recoverable cadavers revealed that all of these guests died within three days of their medical appointments with Dr. Sullivan, and had SCP-████[[footnote]]A powerful drug capable of affecting rational thought, often causes subjects to seek out methods of self-termination.[[/footnote]] in circulation.\n* Dr. Sullivan disappeared on November 23rd, 1983. His cadaver was later found in a nearby river. Cause of death could not be determined.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include more-by:notgull]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3247]]] |  SCP-3248 | [[[SCP-3249]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
