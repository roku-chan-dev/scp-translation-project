These files should be accessible upon request from any Foundation owned terminal.\n\nWhen requested access, a randomly generated number must be assigned to the individual trying to access the file before decrypting the files. This is vital for the continued containment of SCP-7021. \n\nAlternate files have been put in place as is in the outlined in the Dice Maiden protocol.\n\nThese files are to be read by [DATA EXPUNGED] to neutralize SCP-7021 and all related phenonema. \n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7021 is the designation for the phenomenon of favorable probability. To the general public SCP-7021 is most commonly known as luck. Previously, SCP-7021 was the collective designation for a series of events that involved the disappearance of luck from baseline reality but due to recent findings the designation has been changed to include other elements of SCP-7021 previously thought to be non-anomalous or unrelated.\n\nSCP-7021, started affecting baseline reality on a large scale between ██/██/202█ and ██/██/████. It affected several probability related circumstances, and negatively influenced the outcome of various probability-related events and caused a IK-class Global Civilisation Collapse scenario.\n\nThrough the use of the Dice Maiden Protocol the Foundation managed to combat the threat posed by SCP-7021 and neutralized its effects on consensus reality. Normalcy was restored through the use of SCP-███ and SCP-███. And the ZK-001-Alpha protocol was activated.\nAlthough SCP-7021 is still active in consensus reality, its effects are considered to be minimal and irrelevant to the Foundation and warrants no attention. On ██/██/202█ it was changed to Thaumiel class.\nSoon after, SCP-7021's object classchanged to neutralized on orders from the Overseers.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n//SCP-7021 is of no concern now.

SCP-7021 has been neutralized.//\n[[/div]]\n**Addendum 7021-The Dice Maiden Protocol:**\nAfter the following research, done by an Emergency Analyst Team led by Researcher Moonsong, the \"Dice Maiden\" encryption system has been established as part of SCP-7021's Special Containment Procedures. \n[[collapsible show=\"See Document Research Log for the complete analysis.\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"> border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #444; background:#f2f2c2 url('http://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/format-hell/scp_trans.png') center center no-repeat; padding: 1.5rem; color: black; margin-bottom: 10px; 0px;font-family: 'Oxanium', cursive;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION \n\nWith approval of the O5 Council, RAISA has established the DM special encryption system as proposed by SCP-7021 Emergency Analyst Team. The system is set for immediate implementation toward all files pertaining information regarding SCP-7021.\nTo access the requested file, Foundation personnels must use this mechanism to generate a random number between 1 and 6.\nWe hope you the best of luck when opening the file. The outcome does matter.\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThere are three elements to be understood in the containment process of SCP-7021.\n\nFirst, SCP-7021 appears to be an anomalous phenomena regarding the occurrences of improbable events within the realm of possibility. However, SCP-7021 is not a threat in itself. Instead, it is theorized that SCP-7021 is a by-product of unidentified and undetectable sentient reality-altering entity, or entities, we can theorize to be SCP-7021-1. \nThese SCP-7021-1 instances are also theorized to possess the capacity to influence the rate of  improbable events occuring in baseline reality and actively observe the changes it has made, indirectly with unknown purposes or motives.\n\nSecond, while SCP-7021 has indeed caused unlikely events to occur, the appearance or disappearance of luck could be understood more as a shift in favorability than it is actually luck or misfortune. In this sense, SCP-7021-1 can influence luck to favor themselves or misfortune against a target. They also drastically increase the likelihood of something improbable to happen, as long as it is within the realm of possibility. \n\nHowever, it is currently unknown (a) to what extent (b) under what conditions, and (c) why would SCP-7021-1 interact with our reality and cause SCP-7021 to occur. Regardless, it is assumed that the relationship of \"luck/misfortune\" with \"improbable events within possibility\" is one that is existential. So long as the possibility exist, luck/misfortune will always exist - and any event, no matter how improbable, can occur. Thus, even with the incomprehensible ability of SCP-7021-1 influencing reality and causing luck/misfortunate events to occur, SCP-7021 can neither be destroyed or erased so long as possibility exists.\n\nThird and last is the fact that the most important aspect of SCP-7021 is that it is possible to counteract SCP-7021 by tricking SCP-7021-1 interaction with our consensus reality. As an indirect influencer of the SCP-7021 phenomenon, it is theorized that there are limitations to just how much can SCP-7021-1 observe or anticipate the changes it has or will have on our reality. Thus, it is entirely possible for one to \"cheat\" luck/misfortunes by creating a rigged probability or chance based process that gives the illusion of luck and choice even though it has a fixed outcome.\n\nLuck or misfortune is all about shifting the odds in or away from one's favour. If done correctly, we can make our own or even eliminate luck. That's why you must generate a number to access the file.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n**Addendum Zero:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"For Your Eyes Only - click to open message \" hide=\"For Your Eyes Only-Opening Access to File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"> border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n//To you,//\n@@@@\n//The fact that humanity still exists in a universe as hostile as ours is nothing short of a miracle. At this point I can not tell you how many times we avoided XK-class scenarios simply by the virtue of miraculous timing, the right person being at the right place, or another SCP being able to counteract whatever end was awaiting us. Realistically, the only reason our reality is still intact is through sheer dumb luck.//\n@@@@\n//Now, there are multiple cases in which luck affected humanity as a whole. If the physics of the universe were slightly different, life as a whole could not have existed. But it does. The fact that our species managed to evolve from such strange circumstances, how we avoided various astronomical objects and survived plagues and disasters that killed millions of other species.//\n@@@@\n//Humanity is lucky.//\n@@@@\n//But luck like ours is not realistic. I realize that. This has led me to believe that the only way for us to be blessed with such an unrealistic amount of luck is that there are entities influencing it. It has to. SCP-7021 clearly shows a pattern of sapience throughout its actions. wreaking havoc as much as it can without breaking its toy. Avoiding wiping out humanity too quickly, but also making sure we knew didn’t go out quietly. We were stripped of our weapons, tools and pride.//\n@@@@\n//And powerless we are. Faced with entities that control powers beyond our comprehension. Beings who can change the outcomes of events on a whim, just so they can see us survive just to suffer more for their sick amusement. We rolled with the punches so far but SCP-7021 was something of a whole other magnitude.//\n@@@@\n//I suppose one, if not all, of those entities must have harbored sadistic animosity against us. I suppose this might have been their declaration of war.//\n@@@@\n//But we know your weakness now.//\n//Thank you for sharing that.//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n@@@@",
