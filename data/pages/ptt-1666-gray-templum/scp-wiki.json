Theories range from the assimilation of the original Irkallan pocket universe into baseline reality to it being a sign of the One True Religion and that all other Tartarean realms are merely false conjurations of the Gnostic Demiurge, though as of the modern day none of these theories have been empirically verified.[[/footnote]] This cavern is large enough to contain weather systems and variable geology and topographies, creating a diverse biosphere with a host of separate and unique climates and environments. There is a single permanent entrance to PTT-1666, manifesting as a narrow, rough-hewn stone stairwell descending into the Earth for several kilometers and terminating at the Seven Gates of Irkalla. \n\nThe human spirits that collect in PTT-1666 are typically unable to exit, residing there — aware and active — in perpetuity. Due to being inhabited for the longest continuous period out of all known Tartarean Realms, PTT-1666 has been substantially developed and terraformed by its residents, who quarry marble, granite, and other stone to create large urban centers and monuments, waterworks resembling the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and other similar large-scale infrastructure projects. \n\nIn addition to human spirits, PTT-1666 is host to native entities that have adapted to an ectovorous lifestyle (\"demons\"),[[footnote]]As demons' genomes are composed of single-strand RNA, it is believed that they do not share a common ancestor with any species currently known and may have evolved independently of terrestrial life.[[/footnote]] meaning that the the Realm is contingent on the proliferation and consumption of ghosts to maintain the balance of the ecosystem.[[footnote]]Biologists and demonologists describe the Tartarean ecosystem as a \"ghost-fall-based food chain,\" likening it to the biospheres created around food-falls in the terrestrial oceans.[[/footnote]] However, due to the lack of spirits naturally entering Irkalla, the biodiversity of the Realm has been greatly diminished over the course of two millennia. Extant demon phenotypes either survived by evolving into forms analogous to phyletic dwarfs to conserve energy or becoming domesticated by the resident spirits to act as companions or beasts of burden. While there remain demons that resemble pre-Christian Irkallan ectophages, the few remaining are kept in wildlife sanctuaries on the surface[[footnote]]Administered and maintained by Special Conservation and Preservation Inc., a non-profit joint venture between ICSUT, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution.[[/footnote]] for study, as in recent centuries they have been outcompeted and preyed upon by invasive ectophages from other Tartarean Realms and as such are rarely found in the wild.  \n\nThe PTT-1666 population of human spirits is estimated to be ~500,000 souls, though a detailed census is impossible due to the spatial dimensions of the realm and the hazards therein. This ranks Irkalla as one of the more underpopulated of the Tartarean Realms that have been surveyed thus far by GOC member societies, only larger than most artificial Tartarean Realms and the Seventeenth Realm of the Singular Maw. The majority of these ghosts are either geist-gestalts, sub-sentient shades, body-bound ghouls, or Abrahamic ghosts[[footnote]]See **Goldbaker-Reinz, Ltd. Economics Report**.[[/footnote]] with a slim minority being partially immortalized mythotypes. According to testimony by individuals from Irkalla, their  population has been significantly depleted since its peak, driven by an event that translated literally into \"The Starving,\" a period of prolonged societal upheaval and religious turmoil. No spirit interviewed was willing to speak of this event, though the generalities can be inferred.  \n\n\n[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]\n\nNergal (PTE-1667-Black-Templum-father), the current ruler of PTT-1666, is closely allied with the Prince of Darkness, and has been receiving domestic and military aid to deal with the New Uruk uprising, mostly from the Third Tartarean Realm of the Duat, annexed by Hell in the 7th century AD. Diplomatic immunity and protection has been extended by the incumbent regime towards GOC anthropologists, demonologists, philologists, and archeologists in the region, but due to the political instability of the region, both terrestrial and Tartarean, it has been determined that the GOC restrict their operations to Kur la Nippur and the outlying areas. \n\nPursuant to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/paralaw Damned Embargo (DSD-1961-066)], the United States of America have refused to entreat with or trade with all Tartarean Realms under the control of or allied with the Prince of Darkness, with most other countries and their respective normalcy agencies following suit.[[footnote]]Barring members of the Warsaw Pact, Vietnam, and Switzerland.[[/footnote]] Similarly, the GOC has denied proposed trade normalization[[footnote]]See the **1957 Babylon Agreement Am. 1**.[[/footnote]] and also Irkalla GOC membership or observership. However, both the Manna Charitable Foundation and USAID do produce emergency aid packages and educational programs for spirits within PTT-1666. \n\nThe stairwell into PTT-1666 and the nearby lift-shaft is to be kept under surveillance by the GOC to prevent civilian exposure to PTT-1666 or any malicious entry or exit from the region. \n\nAn investigation has been launched into the causes and effects of the recent civil unrest within PTT-1666, as well as investigations into the security of the entrance of PTT-1666 and whether any other unknown and unmonitored entrances into the region exist. \n\nIn the event of hostilities or the welfare of GOC operatives is put in danger, retaliatory force is permitted under the authority of the **Third Mission (Protection)**. Pursuant to this, all GOC outposts in PTT-1666 are outfitted with armories with weapons up to and including the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/strikefall Heavy Engagement Chassis (HEC)] and its associated armaments. These weapons are permitted to be used in engagement undertaken only for the sole purposes of self-defense or evacuation from PTT-1666.\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PNEUMA Historical Records\n\nWhile there had long been records both in what would become northern Iraq and elsewhere stories of demons that would plague regions and villages, these stories were often too fragmentary or distorted from oral retellings for GOC historians to be able to confirm the events to have actually occurred. However, after the end of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3457 Sixth Occult War], such stories in the Middle East became much more clearer and more cohesive, with descriptions of entities validated by other, disparate attacks and reports hundreds of kilometers away.  \n\nThe following is a selection of letters that represent the first hard evidence of these creatures. \n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n\n**Excerpt of letter from T. E. Lawrence to Lt. Colonel Pierce Charles Joyce, dated 5 August 1918:**\n\n... [The] fighting was fierce, the Bedouins more than worth their price in gold. They were able to defend our position enough from the Otoman [sic] scouts before our objectives were completed. The charges supplied by your man, David, worked without any issue, and collapsed the bridge before the engine could make it across, and it plunged into the gully below. The steam explosion was deafening. \n\nI'm afraid the jubilant cries of the Bedouins were ill-timed, however. There came a horrific screeching and bellowing from the box-cars laid in the gully, like the roar of tiger or cattle in the slaughterhouse. \n\nThese //things// ripped their way out of the boxcars, Pierce. Living, breathing animals, four-legged, furred beasts with the wings of an eagle and the mane of a lion. I do not know what fresh hell the Grand Vizier dug these creatures from, but they screamed like banshees and snapped like wolves. Yoked with gilded collars, I believe they were meant to be set upon our rebel army by the desperate Ottomans. But without a minder or lion-tamer at hand, they set upon all the troops with bloody maw and sharpened claw, be they Ottoman or Bedouin. \n\n[...]\n\nThirty of my men were lost before those creatures were finally put down. Vicious creatures, repaying every bullet fired with blood in kind. I was in half a mind to order them skinned and to use their hides as rugs in my bivouac, but as soon as they stopped breathing, they started to evaporate like water under the desert sun.\n\nI do not believe they were earthly creatures, Pierce...\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n\n**Excerpt of letter from T. E. Lawrence, 20 September 1918:**\n\n... [T]here was another village, on our way to Damascus. The sun had since set, but our guide had insisted that this village would provide fresh water for our mounts and our soldiers, as well as safe bedding. The guide was right as to the former, but wrong as to the latter. \n\n//Ifrits//, our men have taken to calling them. Demons from Hell.  We were better prepared since that first encounter, and unleashed our worst upon those Ottoman curs. Through sheer volume of fire they were able to be repelled, with two of the creatures retreating into the desert. We dared not give chase. One had been critically wounded, shot in the eye, and bled out near one of the village's wells. The men who drank from that well became very sick the following morning, and had to be blessed by the imam before they recovered. They may not be entirely wrong as to the infernal nature of these creatures, Pierce.\n\nThe ifrit did not evaporate like the other creatures we encountered in the gully, perhaps due to the coming of nightfall. Faisal's surgeon, Amir, suggested an autopsy, a request I gladly acceded to, after the taking of the photo enclosed in this letter.\n\nThe anatomy would have been confusing to Britain's most acclaimed doctors, much less to a desert chirurgeon. Its blood ran black and thick like tar, and it possessed no heart, only a long, muscular tubule following its cartilaginous spine. Its bones were flexible and malleable, one could leave a thumbprint along the surface of a rib without much difficulty. Its surviving eye, plucked and examined by firelight, resembled at a glance a slit-eye of a cat, but upon closer inspection the pupil [was] segmented into several dozen dark clusters, like the center of a poppy. \n\nThe body was burned before it could evaporate with the coming of the sun. Its burning corpse gave off the smell of sweet citrus. \n\nI am not a praying man, Pierce, for there is little to pray to out in the desert. But I find that my soul seeks the comfort of a pew and a priest's gentle words. I fear I shall not sleep well these coming days.\n[[/div]]\n\n++ Discovery\n\nThese letters and others were collated by the British Occult Service and utilized as evidence to lobby the Allied Occult Initiative — the GOC predecessor organization — to aid and fund an exploratory expedition to find and seal the source of demonic influence within the region. To that end, following the conclusion of the Second World and Seventh Occult Wars, a joint BOS-ICSUT expedition was mounted in 5 November 1948, which quickly focused on the Zagros mountains as a likely location of the Tartarean manifestations. They located the entrance to PTT-1666, but were lost after descending the stairwell, presumably from a combination of the hostile environs and entities within PTT-1666. \n\nIt wasn't until 3 June 1956 that a second expedition was mounted to PTT-1666. This expedition made use of recent developments in survival gear and anti-demonic warding, and was able to establish a foothold and basecamp within PTT-1666, as well as the laying of transmission cable to relay radio reports to the surface. On 1 July 1956, the expedition made first contact with PTE-1667, opening up possible diplomatic channels. On 20 July 1956, Ambassador Kitchener was formally transferred from his [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nte-2858-cyan-blaecca 8837 London position] to explore diplomatic avenues with PTT-1666.\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PSYCHE Diplomatic Records\n\nAccording to anthropological findings, it is believed that a prior Tartarean entity, known as Ereshkigal, was the former ruler of PTT-1666, and maintained that title from the Realm's manifestation up until the fall of the Akkadian empire, where a confluence of factors led to the deposition of Ereshkigal in favor of the current head of the regime, Nergal, who claims to be the Mesopotamian god of war. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:anorrack-iv/seal.jpg\n| caption=Cylinder seal taken from the Court of Nergal, depicting him blessing one of his subjects.\n| width=35%\n| align=right]]\n\n+++ Recorded Diplomatic Negotiations\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date**: 1956/AUG/02\n**Interviewer**: Chief Ambassador Daniel Kitchener\n**Interviewed**: 𒀭𒄊𒀕𒃲, Nergal, King of the House of Dust (PTE-1667)\n\n**Preamble:** This interview was recorded with the permission of PTE-1667 on the seventh day of GOC-Irkallan negotiations. It was conducted during a diplomatic banquet hosted by PTE-1667 in Hulgig-Babylon. In attendance are other minor PTT-1666 Entities of Interest as well as envoys representing other Tartarean Realms. Much of the recording was obscured by the ambient sounds of eating.\n\n------\n\n**Amb. Kitchener:** ...and you are quite sure that the recording device is permitted?\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]You eat of my food, in my palace, in my kingdom. Your wetted tablet is welcome at my table, if the mechanical scribe can understand the words of gods.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** Quite right, quite right. These meats are quite succulent, cooked well to perfection. If I may ask, what did you say they were, exactly?\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]That is prime auroch from Tartarus, twin-headed snake from the Duat, and stuffed anzû from the Hinterlands. We are not wild-men, Kitchener, for civilization still lives even amongst the dead, and luxury persists, for some.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** I see. I have never tried meats of that sort before, but I am encouraged that adventure has finally rewarded my palate.\n\n//[Intervening conversation is inaudible.]//\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]...then Jushur placed the severed head betwixt the corpse's own groin, and kicked the two into the Abzu itself! Ereshkigal was furious at that slight, she was![[/span]]  //[Laughter.]//\n\n**Kitchener:** Ereshkigal. Your wife, I take it?\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]My wife. In an antique time, we were opposed, but violent hatred can’t separate that which longs to be together. We became married, and she was the most beautiful of all my wives, a jewel fit for the heavens, not dim Irkalla. But as consistent as the turn of time, marital bliss always ends, and separation is never peaceful for beings of our stature.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** She was queen before you, I believe?\n\n//[Inaudible, followed by laughter.]//\n\n**Kitchener:** Quite right.\n\n**Nergal:**  [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]But yes, dread and terrible and kind and compassionate in equal measure, Queen of the Netherworld Ereshkigal was, minding the seven gates and wielding the judgment of death upon trespassers and ill-mannered guests. But the strains of godhood make even the gods weary, as they tire of playing the game //ellag// cosmic. Generations past, Ereshkigal renounced the instruments of her office and retired to a palatial estate in the Northern Hinterlands, where she takes no leave and accepts no visitors. I encouraged her, of course. It’s nothing more than the duty of a husband to relieve a wife of her burdens. Even the burden of the throne.[[/span]] //[Laughter.]//\n\n**Kitchener:** And have things changed in Irkalla, as the realm changed hands between you and your wife?\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]Daniel, you were a soldier, were you not? A lieutenant in the trenches of France, artillery raining dirt and shit down on you as you fastened your bayonet with blood-slick hands. You were covered in your friend Jacob's entrails during that November charge, weren't you, the month before you lost three toes to the trench foot? You have seen the faces of men about to die and taken pleasure in death, and in dealing death.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** //[inaudible]//\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]Relax, Daniel, there is no cause for alarm. You see, while I am seated in the House of Dust, my foremost concern is that of war. It will ever be my occupation and true calling. For I was the revered god of Akkad and Kutha once, what bloody-minded people they were.[[/span]]\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]My beloved, she was kind, warm, gentle to all that passed the brazen gates to our halls. Ereshkigal understood the dead, but she did not understand //death.// Death is my compact with my people, it is the sacred transformation that enriches all Irkalla with its bounty. Through war, violence, disease, and murder, my people were excised from the Earth and found their new home in Irkalla. They owe their existence to the forces of death that I embody. And I ensure that these traditions stay alive, as pale as that word may be in this grim place.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** But these changes, these reforms, do you not fear that your people resent them? They may be tradition, but no-one wishes to be subject to senseless violence.\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]You of all people must understand, Daniel. You’ve been in the halls where the leaders discuss “peace” and plan their betrayals. You’ve seen the way the war-hawk drools at the thought of conquest, the mere chance to dominate his rivals beyond recovery. His savor of violence is so pure, so sweet, it is worth more than the pacifism of a hundred souls. There is a razor-thin line between war and worship, and all good things in life can be found at that edge.[[/span]]\n\n**Kitchener:** But what if this violence backfires? No war is one-sided. What if the people of Irkalla revolt, and threaten your authority?\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]Ah, that will be the day. It has been an age and a half since there were any among the shades who could even raise a hand to strike back. Of course, violence inevitably breeds more violence… and who is more skilled than I in that ancient husbandry? If Irkalla erupts into bloodshed, I will tear that resistance limb from limb, I will rend it as one rends an insect. And in those moments, I will be truly happy. You speak of conflict as if it is to be avoided. You could never understand. There is such beauty in violence, in death. Death is what brought us all here. Well. All of us but you.[[/span]]\n\n//[Nergal laughs, the rest are silent.]//\n\n**Nergal:** [[span style=\"font-family:'Slabo 13px', serif;font-size: 16px;\"]]Now, enough of this dour talk, I believe it is time for the desserts![[/span]]\n\n//[The rest of the recording is inaudible.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOver the course of the next eight months, Ambassador Kitchener and PTE-1667 organized the groundwork of what would become the 1957 Babylon Agreement, a document ratified under the GOC charter that legitimated the sovereignty and independence of PTT-1666 under PTE-1667's rule, recognized its ability to conduct diplomacy with the GOC and other paranormalcy organizations, and its submission to and ratification of the Veil and other assorted landmark paralegal international agreements. \n\nThe Babylon Agreement also dictates and restricts that breadth of GOC jurisdiction within PTT-1666, requiring that all formal GOC operations excepting humanitarian aid require express permission from either PTE-1667 or the provincial governor (the //ensi//) before they be conducted. The Agreement also contains other miscellaneous requirements and stipulations, as well as the mechanisms for amendments of the agreement. Only a single amendment has been made to the agreement since its ratification, codifying the Damned Embargo, as well as the recognition that trade will be normalized if and when PTT-1666 voids any and all diplomatic agreements and affiliations with the Prince of Darkness and His allies. \n\nThe obsidian stele upon which the agreement is inscribed is erected in the city square of Kur la Nippur, the city closest to the Seven Gates of Irkalla. \n\n[[div class=\"aoi\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size large]]**Economics Report on PTT-1666 and Inter-Tartarean Relations**[[/size]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**1973/JUL/25**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**SECURITY CLEARANCE 3**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+++ Background\n\n[...]\n\nPTT-1666 (\"Irkalla\") as it stands possesses few trading partners of note, with its largest partners in import/export being Hell (labor and ectoplasmic products/raw mineral products) (42%), Duat (animal and vegetable products/raw mineral products) (34%), and the Soviet Union (machinery and weaponry/paranatural products) (11%). \n\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=200\n|float=right\n|align=right\n|width=50%\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:anorrack-iv/pie-graph.png\n|add-caption=false\n]]\n[[/>]]\n\nIrkalla operates as an extractive economy similar to many developing nations above the Veil, exporting raw materials to and importing refined products from trading partners. To its fellow Tartarean Realms, Irkalla mostly exports mundane raw materials in bulk due in part to the low cost of transit between Irkalla and the other Realms through the two-millennia-old Abzu Gates, which render Irkallan goods competitive against domestic extraction of these bulk goods in other Realms. As such, most of Irkalla's trade value in exports comes from marble, granite, and raw ore and precious metals for its dominant trade partners.  \n\nIn trade relations between terrestrial nations (in violation of the Damned Embargo) and Irkalla, the Realm operates at a higher trade surplus, exporting normally hard-to-procure paranatural products in bulk (beryllium bronze, pneumanite, select occult components and foci, et cetera) in exchange for mundane and paranatural arms and technology.\n\nDue to the labor shortage within Irkalla caused by its status as an \"abandoned\" Tartarean Realm,[[footnote]]A Tartarean Realm is defined as \"abandoned\" by the International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology (ICSUT) if it has a replacement rate of ~0.0, the rate at which newly deceased spirits replace those spirits that have been removed from the workforce through ectovorous depletion, assimilation, or consumption.[[/footnote]] Irkalla's most coveted imports are Christian and secular spirits from Hell, to be used as chattel/manual labor in the extractivist sectors and to act as additional consumers in the local economy. Ignoring noncitizens within the Clay Hinterlands and the Ash Plateau, the unemployment rate in Irkalla is 1.1% (below the efficient unemployment of ~3%) and the inflation rate hovers around 23% (caused by the labor shortage and influx of foreign currencies, which has stabilized in recent years as Irkalla switched to a bimetal silver-orichalcum standard). \n\n[...]\n\n+++ Key Focus\n\nDue to its handicaps in fertility and in economic policy, Irkalla has been unable to effectively modernize and develop their more profitable sectors, and have had to rely on the importation of uneducated, low-wealth migrant workers to fill gaps in their economic base. This has left essential industries thus far unexploited and ripe for development. \n\nThrough GOC surveys of Irkalla and the surrounding geological region, it has been determined that there exist vast untapped deposits of hydrocarbons (both light and heavy crude), within the Clay Hinterlands, in addition to large quantities of accessible rare earth metals. In addition, there are numerous assorted deposits of precious metals, minerals, and critical manufacturing materials, both paranatural and mundane. \n\nAdditionally, due to the significant duration of the lifespans of many Irkallan residents, these citizens have been able to hone their skills over the course of thousands of years, enabling them to reach unparalleled expertise within their given professions. In the case of sorcerers, priests, scholars, and other white-collar fields, the existing educational infrastructure and knowledge base of Irkalla could be used to fuel a paranatural renaissance in sub-veil R&D and manufacturing sectors, provided effective project management.  \n\n[...]\n\n+++ Verdict\n\nBy virtue of being a relatively under-developed, isolated territory with few industrially-advanced trading partners and by possessing unexploited, resource-rich deposits in accessible locations near urban hubs, as well as a completely untapped educated intelligentsia class to be utilized for research, manufacturing, and other high-value sectors, Irkalla possesses an unrealized potential as a source of investment and development for Goldbaker-Reinz and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \n\n\n[[f>image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:anorrack-iv/GR.png width=\"80px\"; opacity=\"60%]]\n\nPursuant to that end, Goldbaker-Reinz and affiliates should work together to lobby the GOC, member societies, and free trade hawks within the American DSC for the dissolution of the Damned Embargo and the normalization of relations between Irkalla and the broader global economy. \n\nInvestment Outlook: **{{[[size 120%]]##green|Bullish##[[/size]]}}**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+++ PHYSICS Operational Records\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||||~ Notable Encounters and Engagements, 1980-1981||\n||~ Date||~ Description||\n||1980/JUN/01|| A series of uncoordinated protests and riots begin over unfair labor conditions and oppression of civil liberties, led largely by the Abrahamic spirit majority.

GOC diplomatic observers in the city report that the brigands appear to be wielding a modified variant of the M16 rifle, tooled to fire supralethal 6.66×51mm NATO Special Ammunition.[[footnote]]The GOC reached out to the United States Pentagram for information on this incident, but the organization disavowed any and all knowledge as to how the brigands gained access to this weaponry.[[/footnote]] The brigand forces disperse into the Hinterlands before Nergalite reinforcements from the nearby Fort Abzu military camp arrive. ||\n||1981/FEB/20|| Lagash Minor is taken by Hinterland brigands, declaring it the capital of a \"Free Irkalla.\" An army is organized by PTE-1667 and lays siege to Lagash Minor. Nergalite forces are composed mostly of mercenary regiments from Hell and Tartarus, containing several Hecatoncheires and at least two Barons of Hell. ||\n||1981/JUL/10|| Lagash Minor is retaken by Nergalite forces. All spirits that still reside within the city are impaled on stakes scattered throughout the Clay Hinterlands. Lagash Minor is turned to salt by Nergalite sorcerers in a show of force.||\n||1981/JUL/28||A minor street riot breaks out in Kur la Uruk between Nergalite Tartarean soldiers and Abrahamic laborers. GOC operatives in riot gear are deployed to protect non-combat personnel. During the peak of the riot, GOC Outpost \"Golf\" in the Diplomatic Quarter is hit by an explosion and set ablaze.[[footnote]]The cause of the explosion was eventually traced to an American-manufactured plastic explosive laced with wolfsbane and silver dust. The Pentagram again disavowed all knowledge of the incident and weaponry involved.[[/footnote]] During cleanup, a number of weapon systems are observed to have gone missing, most notably of which was an HEC. ||\n||1981/AUG/09||  In the process of searching for the HEC in the Clay Hinterlands outside of Kur la Uruk, the search team is ambushed by \"stone-things\" and a M551 \"Sheridan\" Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle.[[footnote]]The Pentagram disavowed all knowledge as to how the weapon system came to be in the hands of Irkallan rebels, and suggested that the tank was part of a false-flag operation by PTE-1667.[[/footnote]] The creatures and tank are immune to operatives' gun- and spell-fire, and only withdraw after Operative \"Willow\" engages them in melee and disassembles two of the hostile entities. ||\n||1981/SEPT/25||The palace of a notable foreign demon dignitary in Hulgig-Babylon is struck by a large thaumaturgical firebomb, cleansing the structure and discorporating all individuals inside, including three GOC diplomatic envoys and Ambassador Kitchener. Nergalite forces begin retaliatory strikes among the spiritual populace of Hulgig-Babylon to quell any further dissent. Local GOC Command issues command to abandon all outposts and ongoing nonessential projects[[footnote]]Including the termination of MCF aid projects.[[/footnote]] in the outlying cities and to withdraw to Kur la Nippur Outpost \"Alpha\" to avoid any further casualties. ||\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n+++ PSYCHE Records\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||||~ __Office of the Undersecretary General__||\n||~ Sender|| Ambassador Kitchener[[footnote]]Kitchener's replacement has yet to be confirmed by PSYCHE Division since his untimely death. Due to rapport established between Kitchener and PTE-1667, and the fact that Kitchener's spirit is trapped within PTT-1666 by its nature, his ghost serves as an interim ambassador to PTT-1666 and acts entirely in a deputized capacity until the time of his replacement's confirmation.[[/footnote]] ||\n||~ Recipient|| D.C. al Fine||\n||~ Date || 1981/OCT/31, 36th Session ||\n||~ Subject|| The Status of Ghosts and Spirits Within the GOC Charter ||\n\nThe discovery and normalization of relations of Irkalla (PTT-1666) and the other Tartarean Realms soon after come as a surprise and shock to many of our member organizations, and to the Coalition itself. While ghosts have been a known quantity for hundreds of years, the existence of an afterlife, or afterlives, had never been proven, beyond theoretical, theological, or philosophical bases. \n\nWhile Tartarean planes cannot be considered \"true\" afterlives to skeptics, the fact that developed, civilized nation-states may form out of the chaos and horror of human death, and the fact that the resident spirits still strive for the same goals of freedom and liberty that living humans do, leaves Coalition High Command with three questions that need to be answered: \n\n> 1. **Whether** Irkalla and the Tartarean Realms, by virtue of their existence, prove that spirits of the deceased must be considered \"human\" as defined by the GOC charter;\n> 2. **Whether** the spirits residing within Irkalla are to be extended the protection of and representation within the Coalition; and\n> 3. **Whether**  the conditions within Irkalla currently warrant the declaration of a humanitarian emergency and military intervention by the GOC and its member societies. \n\nVoting follows:\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 30%; padding: 0 2% 0 0\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n**As to Measure 1:**\n||~ YEA||= 47||\n||~ NAY||= 61||\n||~ ABSTAIN||= 0||\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 30%;  padding: 0 2% 0 0\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n**As to Measure 2:**\n||~ YEA||= 50||\n||~ NAY||= 55||\n||~ ABSTAIN||= 3||\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:right; width: 30%;  padding: 0 2% 0 0\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n**As to Measure 3:**\n||~ YEA||= 51||\n||~ NAY||= 52||\n||~ ABSTAIN||= 5||\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n~~~~~~~~\n------\nSpecific concurrences and objections lodged by nonvoting members of the Council of 108 and other observing bodies have been selected and outlined for clarity of argument.\n\n**In Support**\n> The **Holy Order of Knights Templar, Reformed** calls for the integration of the spirits within Irkalla and other Tartarean Realms within the fold of humanity and to intervene on their behalf, as while their ability to cease existence is indication that the spirits are not the true immortal souls of mankind, they represent a continuation of the intellect of the body after death, and allowing injustice to occur to the spirits as a class would be identical to allowing the suffering of living men.\n>  \n> The anticardinals of the **United Church of Satan, Scientist** and justices from the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** seconded the motion, declaring that allowing the domination of a deity such as Nergal over spirits would be an insult to humanity's capacity for free will and the dispensation of justice.\n> \n> Both scenarios represent a violation of the GOC's Third Mission (Protection).\n\n> The **Brotherhood of Auspicious Survivors** notes that the Infernal Bloc by its very nature poses an existential parathreat to the Veil and the survival of the human race. Additionally, they note that that PTE-1667 is a critical supplier of raw materials and other essential economic goods to the Prince of Darkness and PTT-1666 represents a potential beachhead for a terrestrial attack. As such, if PTE-1667 is deposed and discorporated then the Infernal Bloc would be destabilized and a weak border would be strengthened. \n> \n> Observer representatives from the **Organization for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts** support this motion. \n> \n> These organizations request a military solution on the basis of the First Mission (Survival) and Fourth Mission (Destruction).\n\n> The **Bavarian Illuminati** would like to place the observation into the record that while the organization supports all three measures, the Pentagram is clearly exacerbating relations and inciting violence, and so the vote is essentially irrelevant in regards to the halting of violence in the region.\n> \n> American observer representatives from the **Smithsonian Institution** support this motion. \n\n**In Opposition**\n\n> Executives of **Goldbaker-Reinz, Ltd.** disclaim support for the measures, asserting that declaring universal rights for Irkallan spirits may prevent further normalization of relations with the incumbent regime, and discourage PTE-1667 from pivoting away from trade with the Prince of Darkness, thereby keeping the Realm within the Infernal Bloc.\n> \n> The **British Occult Service** seconded this motion, asserting that drawing PTE-1667 away from the Infernal Bloc would prevent the Prince of Darkness from enacting more of His Works on Earth by diminishing His number of allies, in addition to decreasing His trade surplus. \n> \n> Observer representatives of the **Heritage Foundation** also support this motion. \n> \n> These organizations request nonaction on the basis of the Second Mission (Concealment) and to the Third Mission (Protection).\n\n> The **Manna Charitable Foundation (MCF)** and the **International Red Cross** state in conjunction that any military action would be met with reprisal by PTE-1667, and lead to unnecessary loss of human and demon life.\n> \n> These organizations request a diplomatic resolution on the basis of the Third Mission (Protection). \n\n**Verdict**\n\nAll measures independently fail. The GOC will maintain relations with PTT-1666 and PTE-1667 as consistent with prior diplomatic behavior. The GOC will furthermore take no action as to the developing situation within PTT-1666, nor change the status of the residents of PTT-1666. Their actions are theirs to make. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n------\n++ Kur la Nippur Riot\n+++ PHYSICS Operational Records\n[[div class=\"goc\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||~ AT Patrol Report (Debrief)||\n\n**Date:** 1981/NOV/01\n\n**Involved Assessment/Strike Team:** AT-333 \"Virgil's Vigil\"\n\n**Filing Operative:** \"Willow\" 1235532/777 \n\n**Mission (Location/Objective):**\n\n* Defend GOC non-operatives/observers\n* Defend GOC assets\n* Evacuate all essential personnel\n\n**Encounter Report/Enemy Description:**\n\nIn Outpost \"Alpha\" in Kur la Nippur, at midnight local time, personnel were awoken by the sounds of civil unrest in the town square, as well as sporadic gunfire. A radio report of the ongoing situation was dispatched to the stairwell entrance transmission station before the generator was disconnected by evacuating personnel. AT-333 began to escort personnel to the stairwell's automated lift. \n\nUpon exiting the outpost, AT-333 encountered a large crush of spirits rioting in the street, carrying torches, bricks, and at least two American flags. An MCF legal observer was lost in the shuffle as AT-333 employed the use of non-lethal weaponry to attempt to clear a path through the mob. Operative \"Willow\" followed in an attempt to recover the observer. \n\nA force of Nergalite troops (consisting of three greater Biblical demons, two Furies, a cynocephalus man-catcher, and several Sumerian demons on //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sifting-through-the-sand Falschfleisch]// mounts) arrived to quell the riot, using supralethal weaponry to pacify the mob. Several individuals in the mob retaliated with sorcery, utilizing geo- and pyrokinesis in concert to coat two of the Biblical demons in slag. \n\nA pack of five hellhounds (five feet tall at the shoulder) were unleashed by the Nergalite troops, two of which were shot by a spirit on the rooftops with a rifle, most likely an M16 variant. The remaining three hellhounds discorporated the sorcerers on the street, and the Furies flew onto the rooftops to eviscerate the sniper. \n\nOperative \"Willow\" was able to locate the MCF observer, who had been pushed into a nearby bazaar stall. However, they were intercepted by the Sumerian demons, who attempted to detain them for inciting a riot. \"Willow\" in turn attempted to resist detention, but their forearm was shattered by the last remaining Biblical demon, who then threatened to sever \"Willow\"'s arm completely before the demon's head was forcefully removed from its body by a thrown boulder.\n\nA spirit, approximately seven feet tall, sporting a thick beard and wearing a heavily modified GOC Heavy Engagement Chassis, stood ~15 meters away from \"Willow\" and the observer, the rest of the spirits having mostly dispersed. In his right hand he held a large bronze axe, and in his left he held aloft the obsidian stele from the city square. The individual threw the stele, which lethally impaled the cynocephalus against the wall of a townhouse. \n\nThe Furies and the hellhounds attacked the individual, who dropped his axe in response and assumed a fighting stance. As a hellhound leapt upon him, the individual mechanically separated the spine of the hellhound from its body and used it to discorporate the remaining hellhounds. The Furies swooped down on him from above, one of which was dispatched by \"Willow\" through use of her sidearm. The man picked up his axe, and cleaved the remaining Fury in half. The Sumerian demons retreated from the area in response. \n\nThe remaining spirits in the area started to celebrate. The man approached \"Willow\" and aided in setting her arm, speaking to both her and the observer: \n\n> Listen well, men of flesh. You and your companion may leave as you desire, but ferry this message to your masters above: Irkalla kneels to no man, demon, or god. Our future is clay in our hands, and is ours to shape. A new day rises in the House of Dust, a red day, a vengeful day, a day of sword and flame.\n> \n> I declare this the beginning of New Uruk, the beginning of my Kingdom of Dust! A kingdom free from slavery, free from savagery, free from the despoiling and predations of man, beast, and demon. Let all who oppose me tremble like leaves in the wind, let their steel rust and iron weep, for I am Gilgamesh, slayer of the Bull of Heaven, slayer of Humbaba, slayer of lions, the first hero, Mightiest Son, two parts god and one part man!  As Shamash wills it, it will be done!\n\n\"Willow\" and the observer were then able to safely evacuate through alleys and side-gate \"Ishtar\", and were able to safely retreat to the lift by Jeep and rendezvous with the rest of the personnel.  \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n= **𒌍 [[[With Naught but Dust to Eat]]] 𒁹 [[[Dead King's March|Hub]]] 𒁹 [[[king-of-the-dead-breaker-of-chains | King of the Dead, Breaker of Chains]]]** 𒆕\n[[module css]]\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Slabo+27px&display=swap');\n\n.slabo-27px-regular {\n  font-family: \"Slabo 27px\", serif;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-style: normal;\n}\n.rate-box-with-credit-button {\n    background-color: #222e59!important;\n    border: 1px solid #0c1121!important;\n    border-radius: 5px !important;\n    box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5) !important;\n}\n.rate-box-with-credit-button .creditButton p a {\n    border-left-color: #0c1121!important;\n}\n.rate-box-with-credit-button .page-rate-widget-box .cancel {\n    border-radius: 0;\n}\n.rate-box-with-credit-button .page-rate-widget-box .rate-points {\n    border-left: 0;\n}\n\ndiv.goc table {\n  width: 100%;\n}\ndiv.goc th {\n  width: 25%\n}\n\n\ndiv.aoi {\n    width: 90%;\n    margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\n    padding: 1em;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    display: block;\n    background-color: #e0e2db;\n}\n.aoi blockquote {\n    background-color: inherit;\n}\n\ndiv.paper {\n    width: 90%;\n    margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\n    background-color:#f0d7b9;\n    box-shadow: 4px 6px 8px #a98;\n    padding: 1em;\n    display: block;\n}\n.paper a:link {\n  color: #824565;\n}\n.paper a:visited {\n  color: #63173f;\n}\n.paper a:hover {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n/*\n    Third Law Canon, 7th Occult War Theme\n    [2018 Wikidot Theme]\n    Created by GreenWolf\n    Based on SCP Sigma 9 Theme created by Aelanna and Dr Devan.\n    The Station font was created by Nick Matavka and is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.\n    The Black Sunrise logo was created by GreenWolf and is released under CC-BY-SA 3.0.\n    Revised by stormbreath.\n*/\n \nh1, #page-title {\n    color: #003153;\n}\n \n#page-title {\n    border-color: #315B7D;\n}\n \na {\n    color: #00487c;
