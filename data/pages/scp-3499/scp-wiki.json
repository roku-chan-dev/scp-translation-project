The crowd quickly grew too large for the hall, and many were forced to cheer from the sidewalks. When Colonel Roosevelt finally arrived, a flurry of excitement erupted from the crowd as supporters spilled into the streets to get a glimpse of his car.\n\nColonel Roosevelt held an aura of ease and humility about him. Earlier that day, rumors had circulated among the city that he had injured himself and could not appear. This did little to harm the Colonel's confidence. His ginger walk to the podium sparked further hysteria within the crowd. They roared on for thirty more minutes before Colonel Roosevelt waved his hand, asking for silence.\n\nWith all of the vigor of ten men, Colonel Roosevelt said:\n\n\"My supporters, those whom I consider to be close friends, I appreciate you spending your time with me on this fine day. I would ask you to be quiet--\"\n\nAt that moment, a man pushed himself to the front of the crowd and fired upon Colonel Roosevelt. The former President collapsed onto the stage. The man, a socialist who says that his name is John Schrank, was disarmed and seized by the crowd. There were calls for him to be lynched in the street. Colonel Roosevelt soon rose, however, and ordered the man to be placed under arrest. The crowd parted at his word and allowed the police through.\n\nTurning back to the podium, Colonel Roosevelt addressed the crowd:\n\n\"My friends!

I may have been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose!\"\n\nThis attack is the the latest example of a troubling developing in the American political institution: rule by revolver. Most assassins are young, insane immigrants from Europe. Charles Julius Guiteau, murderer of the 20th President James Garfield, is an ideal example.\n\nOn the morning of July 2nd, 1881, Guiteau traveled to a railway station and intended to wait there until evening. This is a common practice of the fringe political group known as \"The Stalwarts\" which Guiteau founded. He would wait for five more hours underneath the summer sun.\n\nGuiteau's madness was palpable to onlookers. Citizens had reported him to a policeman whom patrolled the area many times before. Despite this, nothing was done about Guiteau's presence at the station. He was seen proselytizing to passerby about a supposed divine commission which impelled him to kill Garfield.\n\nOne woman was subjected to Guiteau's ramblings for almost twenty minutes. She distinctly remembers the assassin having a fit in the middle of one of his endorsement speeches. He began to repeat a single, nonsensical phrase until Garfield arrived at the railway.\n\nWhen Garfield stepped on the railway platform, he conversed with Guiteau for a short while. There were no witnesses of this conversation that could accurately describe the topics that were discussed. Guiteau then loudly uttered an obscenity at the President before retrieving a pistol from his coat pocket and shooting Garfield twice in the chest.

I am still not sure what that cause for my repulsion to the classroom was. I've pondered over the question for many days, watching the sun leap into dawn before slowly waning back down into night. The night that I write this, one that I will spend in jail for a crime that I did not commit, I had gone from fully believing that I had found the answer, to realizing that I was miles from a conclusion, to fully believing in another answer within minutes of each other. I am not bothered much by this. In fact, I am happy for it; my years of study into theology has shown me that this behavior is common in great men.\n\nA few hours before I found the time to write this, it was midnight. I laid with no desire for sleep as my thoughts dismantled my new, carefully laid explanation. Even now, I am unable to subdue my mania. The warden came by my cell for my nightly treatment. He injected a milky-white liquid into my forearm which dulled my senses and told me he'd stand by to make sure that it was working. I found myself dwelling on that phrase, \"stand by\", long after he had left. Those words held an unruly power over me, like they should have meant something. But as the medication wore off and the fits of painful laughter that lasted for minutes on end returned, I stopped worrying. It was during one of these fits that a day I seldom remembered came to the forefront of my half-conscious mind.\n\nWhen I was a young man at the university, I still held some belief in the teachings of those preachers whom I now feel disgusted for having known. The professor on the day was a very short and fat man with a few gray hairs in his hair. I listened to him speak for almost an hour before a sickly feeling began to rise in my stomach. I tried to recite the words of Saint Paul the Apostle, one of my personal mentors, to quell the feeling. It did little to alleviate my discomfort. I excused myself to the bathroom, and vomited into one of the toilets. The convulsions of my stomach left my throat hoarse and my mouth bloodied.\n\nAs I turned to leave, an Angel bearing the face of St. Paul himself appeared before me.\n\nIn that moment, as I clung to the sides of the toilet seat to avoid fainting completely, I decided to rededicate my life to the Savior and to let His commandments dictate my life. I felt as if I had grown up ten years in a matter of ten seconds. My hair became gray and grew so long that the ends touched the floor, my bones became as brittle as a corpse, my skin became wrinkled. The Angel spoke and, while I am unable to transcribe with full respect His words, I believe it to be an even greater slight to not record what He had said to me that day.\n\n\"One that bears the name 'Guiteau',\" He said, \"I have watched over you since the night of your birth. I have personally witnessed your struggles, your hardships, your triumphs. The friends that knew you and the friends that prayed they never had. Each minute of each hour of each day that goes by in your mind.\"\n\nAs He spoke, I could feel the weakness and pain leave my body. The chains that others had used to shackle me down were unlocked. I was a freed man, and a feeling came over me that I had seldom felt in my youth: happiness. The Angel smiled.\n\n\"You have made more sacrifices than most could endure in your short life. This is why I have descended from the Heavens to you now. To warn you. You have been going against the will of the divine since you began your stay here. This 'group' which you now lead has committed countless atrocities upon this earth and under my watchful eye. If I were to appear before any other man, I would have struck them down in an instant.\"\n\nI wanted to speak. Believe me when I say that I wanted to defend my colleagues, some of whom I consider to be my friends...\n\nA solemn moment of realization has come upon me as I write these words. Those \"friends\" as I called them were the first ones that mentioned that I may have an illness of the mind. When I came begging for shelter after my father left me with no money, they were the ones that I felt hatred towards. My vision was too distracted at that time to notice: the conversations, the meetings, the experiments. They were all lies. Sick, perverted lies that were made to throw mud in His eyes and taint my soul.\n\nIf they had truly wished for my well-being, then why are none of them here? Why am I being tried for a crime that any man would have done given the circumstances? We do not punish the soldiers who slaughter hundreds of our enemies, but yet when I am given a direct command to kill one bastard, I am sentenced to death. They have been led astray. They, as I did then, need a Savior. So I am forever thankful that He chose to save me.\n\nThe Angel spoke more words to me, but I am not in the right state of mind to transcribe them. I want to sleep. This shall be the end of my will and testament. Let them hang me in the streets tomorrow. I do not care anymore.\n\nI am an agent of God.\n[[/div]]\n\n||NOTICE: Further access to this file requires a CRV value of at least 4.8||\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDavid Allen Frederickson\n\"Charles Guiteau\"\n//Songs of the West//\nFolkways Records FH 5259\n\n[[=]]\n++ **Verse**\nCome all you Christian shepherds\nand those of mighty fear,\nFor the righteous has caught me\nand made me disappear.\nSpare just a moment or two,\nTo let me state my crimes,\nAs in a few more moments,\nMy body will ragtime.\n\n++ **Chorus**\nMy name is Charles Guiteau,\nThe crime which I deny,\nWill leave my aging parents,\nSoon saying their goodbyes.\nThough I still will not believe,\nThe world which I am living,\nIs guarded by those corrupt souls,\nWho said that I was sinning.\n\n++ **Verse**\nThose men called me insane,\nAnd they said onto me,\n\"If you want your soul returned,\nit is your friend who must bleed.\"\nBut those wicked men did lie,\nSo when my story was told,\nThe crowd below showed nothing more\nThan their faces of cold.\n\n||NOTICE: Further access to this file requires a CRV value of at least 6.0||\n\n++ **Chorus**\nMy name is Charles Guiteau,\nThe crime which I deny,\nWill leave my aged parents,\nSoon saying their goodbyes.\nThough I still will not believe,\nThe world which I am living,\nIs guarded by those corrupt soul,\nWho said that I was sinning.\n\n++ **Bridge**\nAs I look out to my fans and friends,\nI see they want the same.\n\"I don't want to listen to a criminal,\nI just want somebody to hang.\"\nBut I will not fade away,\nTo a grim history,\nNo, I know that I’m innocent,\nSo ‘till I’m dead I’ll plead,\n\n++ **Chorus**\nMy name is Charles Guiteau,\nThe crime which I deny,\nWill leave my aged parents,\nSoon saying their goodbyes.\nThough I still will not believe,\nThe world which I am living,\nIs guarded by those corrupt souls,\nWho said that I was sinning.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n||NOTICE: Further access to this file requires a CRV value of at least 6.7||\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __Internal Security Department | Incident / Arrest Report__\n[[/=]]\n\n||**Incident ID:** {{O5-000013DW-2020}}||**Date:** {{01/03/2020}}||**Time:** {{20:39}}||\n\n||**Offense:** {{TBD}}||**Suspect:** {{Unknown}} ||**Victim:** {{The Administrator}}||\n----\n\n{{At 20:03, MTF Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\") receives a distress signal from the Administrator's residence at Site-01.
