Constantine was found in a household down in Medford a few weeks ago, where he wasn't treated very well. He was as bloated as a hippo and as sad as a squonk. But we here at Wilson's are working hard to get this guy back in shape!\n\nWhile most bettas have vibrant colors, Constantine is special! The colors of his scales will change depending on how the big guy is feeling. If Constantine is feeling more than one emotion at once (which he usually is) he'll display multiple colors at a time! So far, we've seen our boy show 9 different colors, which I've listed below!\n\n* Blue - Depression, upset, sadness, despair.\n* Red - Anger, frustration, annoyance.\n* Purple - Anxiety, fear, horror.\n* Yellow - Excitement, enthusiastic.\n* Green - Confusion, unsure, contemplation.\n* Orange - Interest, fascination.\n* Pink - Admiration, Awe.\n* Black - Physical Pain.\n\nAs you can tell from the picture above, Constantine isn't always very happy. This is mostly because of the guy's tough medical conditions due to the way he was housed before we took him in. But not to worry! Our aquatic vet Dr. Anne works with our boy on a daily basis to make sure he can make a full and fishy recovery!\n\nConstantine is also smarter than he looks. He's learned the meaning of the word \"food\" and comes swimming to the front of his tank whenever he hears it! He really is a sweet boy, he just needs to come out of his shell.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nHistory!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nAs I said before, Constantine did not have the best life before his time at Wilson's. He was owned by one of my nephews, who didn't exactly know how to care for the little guy. I was at their house when I noticed him in the living room. He was in a little one-gallon tank, with no heater, filter, anything. The water line was halfway down the tank and through the heavy water stains I could barely see the little guy at the front of the tank, staring at me with those big ol' eyes.\n\nI went and asked my sister about him, and she told me they'd had him for two whole years! It's a miracle he survived that long! I offered to take him, and she didn't seem to care too much. So I grabbed his tank, bought him some food, and brought him down to Wilson's! We gave him a big 40-gallon tank to live in, you should've seen how yellow he was for the first few days!\n\nDr. Anne performed a check up on Constantine the day after he arrived, and diagnosed him with fin rot, popeye, gill flukes, columnaris, and a mild case of ich. Just goes to show how strong our boy is! Who knows how long he's been sick for?\n\nDr. Anne also told me that she's pretty sure Constantine is depressed, most likely because of the horrible conditions he was kept in. So our Aquatic team is going to try to cheer up the little guys life with lots of fun betta stuff!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nSince Constantine is still very sick, Dr. Anne is treating him on a daily basis. Every day, Dr. Anne will come in and give Constantine his antibiotics, as well as dosing an anti-bacterial medication into his tank. Once a week, Constantine will get a 30 minute Epsom salt bath! He doesn't like it very much, but we know it will help.\n\nConstantine's tank chores can be found on the clipboard in the tank's cupboard. Any questions should go right to me (Cassandra) or Dr. Anne.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowynn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Sophia Turner\nDate: 2025/07/14\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nDear Sophia,\n\nSending you our monthly check-in for Constantine!

But I have a question for you first, Mr. Sanchez. Were you there when they signed the Boring Agreement?\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** I beg your pardon?\n\n**Wilson:** In 2008. After that [[[the Ursus Maritimus Incident|incident with the Polar Bear]]], everyone important here met with Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, and together, they formed the Boring Agreement. I'm asking you if you were there that day.\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** ...why yes, I was. Although, I didn't say much that day. I just signed the document.\n\n**Wilson:** But you know what was written on it?\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Yes, the agreement was put together over the course of a few days, after which we had a final reading, where Director Holman went over the entire document.\n\n**Wilson:** Great! So you're aware of Article 19 Section 8?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Ms. Wilson, is this about the request you submitted?

You did read over the Agreement when you took over Wilson's, correct?\n\n**Wilson:** Of course I did! Edgar handed me the whole packet!\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Then perhaps you forgot about Section 8? Or simply glossed over it?\n\n**Wilson:** I don't know. It doesn't matter.

Especially over a situation as low priority as this.\n\n**Wilson:** Low priority?\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Ms Wilson, the anomaly you're making this request over is just a fish.\n\n**Wilson:** Just a fish? He's an animal! An animal in our care! Not just in my care, but in the care of //both// of our organizations! He's a living thing, and he's dying!\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Yes, yes I know he is. That doesn't change the fact that he is a low-priority anomaly. His properties are minimal, and he isn't expected to be around for long.\n\n**Wilson:** That's not fair. That doesn't mean he shouldn't be given a life of quality! He deserves it after all he's been through!\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** This isn't about being fair, Ms. Wilson.\n\n**Wilson:** No, it isn't. You've made that abundantly clear. Either way, I want changes made to the agreement.\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** It really isn't that simple. Even if you got everyone who signed the document to agree to make a change, that would take months to actually complete.\n\n**Wilson:** Months? You can't just email everyone and get them together?\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** It's more complicated than that. We'd need to find a time where everyone is available, we'd need to agree on which section is being changed, and then agree on an amendment.\n\n//(Wilson is silent.

The Foundation cannot provide advanced medical assistance to entities under 9.5 centimeters long. Constantine falls under this length.\n\n**Wilson:** Bullshit. Why does the size of the critter matter? He's still a living thing all the same!\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** Yes, well, smaller anomalies tend to possess much more mundane anomalous properties. They simply aren't a priority on the Foundation's to-do list.\n\n**Wilson:** So because he's not as wacky as whatever else you guys have, he's not as important? His life is valued less?\n\n**Dr. Sanchez:** There's also the matter of cost. Advanced surgical procedures on smaller anomalies are quite expensive.\n\n**Wilson:** ...expensive?

She's been doing god's work here folks, and she sure does deserve a medal for it!\n\nAs for Constantine himself, he went through surgery on the 11th. I emailed the Supervisors on that day, informing them that he had developed dropsy, which had caused him to bloat to over 9.5cm in length. Now, I'm sure you all know from my recent rants, but that means that they could perform surgery on him. So the supervisors rushed down here and got to work.\n\nI lied to them. Constantine was still under 9.5 centimeters long. I thought they wouldn't notice, that the fact that he had bloated so much would convince it by itself. But I was wrong. I received an email from the supervisors the next morning, informing me that they had measured him during surgery. They knew.\n\nThey called me down to Site-64, and they fined us. We lost thirty-five thousand dollars because I told a lie to save a life.\n\nThe Supervisors also made an amendment to the Boring Agreement.

Any entities kept by Wilson's Wildlife Solutions that are either aquatic, amphibious or invertebrates shall not receive advanced medical assistance from the Foundation.\"\n\nI screwed us over.
