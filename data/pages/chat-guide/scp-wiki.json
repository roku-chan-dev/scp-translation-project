Chat Staff will not help you find it.\n[[/=]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Welcome - IRC Basics]]\n\n+ **{{<+Reverend> IRC is just multiplayer notepad.}}**\n\n**If you're already a well-versed IRC user,** then point the client of your choice to **{{irc.scpwiki.com}}** (Port 6697 for SSL with SASL enabled or 6667 if you're using a client without SSL support) and join us in #site19 (you will need to register and identify before joining). Please proceed to the 'Rules and Guidelines' tab.\n\n**If none of that makes a bit of sense to you,** please read these basics in their entirety before  attempting to chat, because it probably will not work otherwise.\n\nIRC (Internet Relay Chat) allows for discussions across multiple **channels**, which are prefixed with a **{{#}}**. For example, **{{#football}}**, **{{#cats}}**, and **{{#techsupport}}** would be topical channels people might congregate in. You can also have private, 1-on-1 conversations with people, and even create your own channels to discuss whatever you'd like.\n\nOn the \"Click Here To Chat\" tab, you'll see something that looks like this:\n\n[[image chat1.png]]\n\nIf you have never registered a SkipIRC account (which is entirely separate from Wikidot accounts), you will be required to do so before you can join our main channel. This is easy. Go ahead and hit Connect, you'll see something like this:\n\n[[image chat2.png]]\n\nI've highlighted some relevant areas.\n\n1.) **Status Bar.** All channels and private messages will show up here, and there are options and the leave/quit button on the right-hand side. The \"SkipIRC\" link is clickable and shows server information and important notices.\n2.) **Options.** Customize the experience, add notifications, lots of little things like that.\n3.) **Help.** This is specifically for help using the Lounge client.\n4.) **Mentions List.** Click this for a time-ordered list of messages that included your nickname.\n5.) **Channel Options.** This has different options depending on your abilities in the channel, and a different set of options if you're on the SkipIRC window.\n6.) **User List.** Click this to pop out a new menu with the list of users in the channel. Some users have a prefix in front of them, they indicate a user's rank in the channel. They are **{{~}}** (owner), **{{&}}** (admin), **{{@}}** (op), **{{%}}** (half-op), and **{{+}}** (voice). Different channels use these ranks differently. In **{{#site19}}** and **{{#site17}}**, all users with a rank except **{{+}}** are chat staff (or bots that assist in performing channel duties). Users with the rank of **{{+}}** in #site17 are not staff, but are trusted non-staff users that can reliably give good information on basic questions.\n7.) **File upload.** You can attach small files to share with the channels.\n8.) **Input box.** This is where you type your messages, as well as commands like **{{/register}}** and **{{/identify}}**.\n9.) **Chat window.** The screenshot above shows what a channel will normally look like on joining, showing the topic, then a list of users.\n10.) **Channel Bar.** This will show the current channel as well as the topic.\n\n\n+ Channels\n\nWe make use of four primary channels here. Most channels require registration; for more information, see that tab.\n\n* **{{#site19}}** - For general discussion.\n* **{{#site17}}** - For getting help from staff. This channel does //not// require registration.\n* **{{#thecritters}}** - For giving and receiving critique on drafts and ideas.\n* **{{#stormofbrains}}** - Joint brainstorming channel with discord for the development of ideas and concepts.\n\nThere are also official channels for staff teams:\n* **{{#site11}}** - Technical Staff\n* **{{#site34}}** - Licensing Team\n* **{{#site77}}** - Maintenance and Ancillary Staff Team (MAST)\n* **{{#site81}}** - Community Outreach\n* **{{#workshop}}** - Staff and community-led seminars and workshops.\n\nTo join a new channel, it's as simple as **{{/join [channel]}}** (this can be entered in any chat window). E.g., **{{/join #thecritters}}** will take you to **{{#thecritters}}**. (This can also be shortened to **{{/j #thecritters}}**. You can leave a channel with **{{/part #channel}}** in any window, or **{{/part}}** from the window of the channel you want to part.\n\nYou can double-click a name in the user list to begin a private message conversation with that person, and all your channels and conversations are available in the status bar.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Registration and Logging in]]\n\n+ Introduction to Nickname Registration On IRC\n\nIRC was not designed with a concept of persistent nickname ownership. This feature is provided by NickServ, a service that accepts registrations and enforces user ownership of nicknames. If a user attempts to connect with (or switch to) a registered nickname and is unable to provide the correct password, NickServ will change that user's nickname to a guest nick and temporarily block use of the registered nickname.\n\nMost channels on SkipIRC require users to be logged in using a registered nickname. Registration only needs to be performed once. After that, you'll be able to log in using that nickname.\n\n+ Registration\n\n**The use of disposable email services for nick registration is strictly forbidden, and will result in automatic removal from the network.**\n\nIf you're using The Lounge, click SkipIRC at the top to switch to the server window, then type in:\n\n**{{/register PASSWORD EMAIL}}**\n\nThis will be the password you use to log on to the chat in the future, so make sure it's something you will remember. When you're ready, hit Enter.\n\nIf you did everything right, you'll see a message appear from NickServ (Nickname Services) that reads, **{{An email containing nickname activation instructions has been sent to (email) If you do not complete registration within one day, your nickname will expire.}}**. This can take a couple of minutes to arrive, and has been known to end up in spam or junk mail occasionally, so please check those folders. If your mail provider has a search feature, try searching for SkipIRC. When you find it and confirm the verification code as instructed, your nick will be registered! Please note registrations expire after one year (365 days) of not having identified to that nick.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ If your client is stating that it is unable to recognize the commands you are inputting, please click here.\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[=]]\n**(If you're using our default client, The Lounge, this section will definitely not apply to you. If you are having issues on that client with command inputs, please be sure you are using the proper syntax. Ask for assistance in #site17 if issues persist.)**\n[[/=]]\nPlease note: when attempting to interact with SkipIRC's Services, some of the more basic clients (an example being Pidgin) and especially older command line clients, commands such as [[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]] {{/ns}}[[/span]], [[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]] {{/identify}}[[/span]], and [[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]] {{/register}}[[/span]] will not work. If your client is incompatible with any of these commands, your client will respond with an error message along the lines of: **{{\"That command doesn't work on this protocol.\"}}**\n\nThis issue results from the fact that some clients will only accept a limited set of IRC commands. With that in mind, if you encounter such an issue, you may instead send the command like you would a PM (Private Message).\n\nInstead of using [[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]] {{/register PASSWORD EMAIL}}[[/span]] to begin registering your account with NickServ, you will need to send the command as [[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]] {{/query NickServ REGISTER PASSWORD EMAIL}}[[/span]]. This goes for any other command used to interact with our Services. In essence, any command on these sorts of clients should be formatted as this:\n\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"border: 1px dashed #999; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 0 1em;\"]]/query [SERVICE_NAME] [COMMAND] [PARAMETERS][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWith that said, you should be good to proceed through the registration process. Be sure to keep this fix in mind.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nExample:\n\n[[image chat3.png]]\n\nNow that you've registered, you will be able to join channels such as **{{#site19}}**. The next time you connect, you can log into the nick you registered with NickServ.\n\n+ Logging In\n\n**The short version, for users of The Lounge:** Before you connect, check \"I have a password\" in The Lounge. Enter your password in the field that appears.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Using the /identify command - not recommended!\"]]\n\nThe simplest but most error-prone way to log in is using the **identify** command. This is done by entering:\n\n**{{/identify PASSWORD}}**\n\nEnter that the same way you put in your registration. The downsides of this method are that it's easy to accidentally reveal your password if you aren't careful and that it must be performed after you've already connected.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++ Logging In Securely with SASL\n\nSkipIRC recommends using SASL, a modern IRC feature that allows passwords to be specified at the time of conection. The method for specifying a password via SASL differs from one client to another, but generally speaking it's set as a per-network option with a description of \"Use SASL\", \"Username with Password\", or something along those lines. Your username will be your registered nickname, and your password will be --swordfish-- the password you chose while registering that nick. If you have a choice of authentication types, select \"plain.\"\n\n++ Help, I can't switch to my nick!\nIf you've been having difficulty logging in, you might see a message like {{Services reserved nickname: Registered nickname}} when you attempt to use your nickname. To resolve this, you'll first need to let NickServ know it's you, even though you're using another nick. If you haven't already identified to NickServ, type:\n\n**{{/identify REGISTERED_NICK PASSWORD}}**\n\nwhere REGISTERED_NICK is the nick that you'd like to switch to. Next, type\n\n**{{/ns release REGISTERED_NICK}}**\n\nto tell NickServ that it can stop blocking all use of that nickname. You can then type\n\n**{{/nick REGISTERED_NICK}}**\n\nYou don't need to /identify again this session. However, **please** use SASL if possible, so this doesn't happen.\n\n++ Help, I forgot my password!\n\nTo have password reset instructions sent to the email address you used when registering your nick, type:\n\n**{{/ns sendpass REGISTERED_NICK}}**\n\nand follow the instructions in the email that was sent to you. If you no longer have access to the email address associated with your account and you've forgotten your password, chat staff with IRC operator privileges may be able to assist. \n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Rules and Guidelines]]\n\n+ Chat Guidelines\n\n\n* **Age:** You must be 18 years of age **and** a legal adult in your jurisdiction to be on the SkipIRC network. All users are expected to behave and express themselves at a maturity fitting those ages. (This doesn't mean you can't joke around!)\n* **Topics:** Discussion about SCP ideas and drafts take priority. Any NSFW (Not Safe For Work) links must be tagged as NSFW (check below for examples). No illegal activity is permitted, period.\n* **Reporting:** If you need a chat operator urgently, you can often get our attention by saying **{{ops}}** and we will be notified. Abusing this ping will result in disciplinary action.\n* **Pinging Ops:** Saying the word **{{ops}}** will ping the entire operator team. Please only do this if you need an operator and there is not one actively chatting. Abuse of this will result in disciplinary action. Only users with registered nicks are able to ping ops.\n* **Requesting help from staff:** Staff members are happy to help you with issues related to using the SCP Wiki and IRC chat. If you do request help, *please* be patient and don't leave while staff members are assisting you.\n* **VPNs and Bouncers:** (If you don't know what a VPN or a bouncer is, this does not apply to you.) The use of VPNs to connect to SkipIRC is not allowed due to their potential for ban evasion. We provide SSL connectivity to ensure users' privacy. Bouncers are allowed by prior arrangement with staff. If you would like to use a bouncer, please ask staff in #site17.\n* **Use of disposable email addresses:** As disposable email addresses have generally been used by trolls and other disruptive users, we don't allow them for nick registration. Your email address will be kept confidential and only used for nick verification and in the event we need to contact you for an important reason; we don't send bulk mailings to registered nicks.\n\n++ Chat Nicknames\n\n* To change your nickname, enter\n[[code]]\n/nick [newnick]\n[[/code]]\ninto the chat box, where //[newnick]// is your desired nick.\n\nWe forbid certain kinds of nicknames in our channels:\n* No nicks with \"SCP\" or \"Class D\" or an SCP number.\n* No nicks with a Foundation character that isn't yours (like Dr. Bright, Dr. Sophia Light, Able, or Alto Clef).\n* No nicks saying you're official website or chat staff (like 'admin', 'administrator', or 'operator').\n* No nicks saying you're in charge at the fictional Foundation, or other fictional groups on our website (like Senior [anything], MTF Leader, O5, Director, Executive, or Overseer).\n* No nicks with profanity (swear words) or offensive content. If you have one of these nicks, we may kick you. Please change your nick.\nYou can, however, have nicks like \"DoctorX\", \"ResearcherX\", and \"AgentX\", because these names don't say you're in charge at the Foundation. If you're not sure, ask a staff member. Do not use a nick that is only the title (For example just \"Doctor\").\n\n\n++ Behavior\n\nIt is the responsibility of each chat user to know what is or is not acceptable behavior.\n\nThe following are some specific things to avoid. This doesn't include every possible offense and if you're not sure whether you're about to break a rule, ask rather than finding out the hard way.\n\n* **Bigotry**: Bigotry will not be tolerated. This includes bigotry based on race, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Users expressing bigoted views may be permanently banned without prior warning.\n* **Trolling**: Acting deliberately inflammatory. If you're doing it, you know you're doing it. If ops believe you're trolling and you don't think so, then you need to rethink your behavior. This includes targeting people or a group of people based on their gender, sexuality, race, etc.\n* **Harassment**: Asking for pictures, pressuring discussion of sex lives, etc. PMing or repeatedly talking to a user who has asked you to stop talking to them. You can be banned from the SkipIRC network altogether for this.\n* **Creepiness**: Making others uncomfortable by behaving in a way that would be socially inappropriate if done in public.\n* **Almost anything involving rape.**\n* **Spamming.** You can be banned from the SkipIRC network altogether for this.\n* **Brigades**: Do not use #Site19 as a base for bothering people on other sites. No one cares. Do not use #Site19 to get an SCP you hate downvoted. You'll be banned.\n* **Being Annoying/Disruptive:** If an OP says you're being annoying, //listen// and try to improve. Being annoying isn't entirely against the rules, //but you can still be banned for it// if it gets bad enough. Example offenses here include (but are not limited to) derailing chat, over-proselytizing your opinions, being incoherent, antagonizing others, roleplaying, backseat modding, typing in \"zalgo\" text, and the use of slurs. This includes racist, sexist, and sexual-oriented slurs, as well as slurs and sayings targeting the mentally disabled or differently abled such as //retard//, //spaz//, or //ree//.\n* **Pronounbot-fuckery:** Adding joke pronouns to NickServ is one of the quickest ways to earn a one-week ban. See the \"Pronouns\" tab for more information.\n* **Sockpuppeting and ban evasion:** You can, within reason, have multiple chat nicks, but you can't pretend to be your brother just because you did something stupid. Ban evasion is obviously not allowed. Users should note that frequently attempting to join the chat during a ban might be viewed as de facto ban evasion, if you do it enough to be disruptive.\n\n++ NSFW\n\nFirst, **don't** link outright porn.\nTag all these kinds of images.\n\n# **Nudity, of a non-pornographic nature.** Tag \"NSFW\".\n# **Extreme violence and gore.** Tag \"NSFW\".\n# **Jump scares, screamers, flashing lights.** For these, **you must always identify what they are when you link them**. This is because we have members with epilepsy, and this can trigger seizures.\n\n++ Discipline & Banning\n\nChannel operators (ops) have the authority to dictate the course of conversation. //**Operator orders are to be followed at all times.**//\n\nOperators have the authority to warn and ban users. Minor or accidental offenses may result in multiple warnings or several shorter bans. Especially bad offenses may result in a ban of any length.\n\nRespect chat operator decisions, even if you disagree with them. If you feel that a decision was in error, you may protest the action in the Help Channel, [http://05command.wikidot.com/chat #Site17] or in a private message to a chat operator. Generally, you should discuss the situation with a different chat operator, especially if you were the one warned or banned.\n\nThe final authorities on disciplinary matters or rule disputes are the Chat Administrators (listed in the \"Staff\" tab.) Please report any serious misuses of authority to them.\n\nPlease also note that while banned users **may** enter 17 to appeal or ask genuine questions unrelated to their ban, they **may not** remain in the channel once their questions or appeal have been handled.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Standard Ban Escalation\"]]\n**Operators may decide to follow or ignore this at their discretion. It's only listed here for reference.**\n* Warning. A warning may involve asking a person officially to stop doing something, or it may be a kick, or it may be an immediate 'warning ban' of any length between 5 minutes and 2 days.\n* Week Ban.\n* Month Ban.\n* Year Ban.\n* Permanent Ban.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nBans will generally appear in the [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/c-82389/chat-users Chat Users Forum] on the 05 Command site.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Pronouns]]\nSkipIRC now has support for pronouns and gender identity information. This feature is exclusive to SkipIRC and was written by [[*user Kufat]]; any issues should be reported to him.\n\n++ Setting pronouns and gender\n\nOnce you've registered your nick, you can set your gender with **{{/ns gender}}** and pronouns with **{{/ns pronouns}}**. These will be visible to all users. Use of this feature is optional.\n\nThe **{{/ns gender}}** command takes any number of words in a freeform format, e.g. if ExampleUser uses the command **{{/ns gender masculine non-binary}}** would be displayed as \"ExampleUser identifies as masculine non-binary\". You can use one word or a phrase as you prefer. To clear your gender info, use the command **{{/ns gender}}** without any arguments.\n\nSetting pronouns is accomplished similarly. **{{/ns pronouns}}** takes a list of one or more pronouns, separated by **spaces** (not commas or slashes). There is also support for accepted and unaccepted pronouns. For example, the masculine non-binary user described above might input:\n\n[[code]]\n/ns pronouns they them theirs\n/ns pronouns accepted he him his\n/ns pronouns unaccepted she her hers\n[[/code]]\n\nwhich would then be displayed as:\n\n[[code]]\nExampleUser uses these pronouns: they, them, theirs\nExampleUser accepts these pronouns: he, him, his\nExampleUser does NOT accept these pronouns: she, her, hers\n[[/code]]\n\nNote that commas are displayed in the output; do not type them into the NickServ command. Additionally, subsequent pronoun commands will overwrite the previous value rather than add to it. You can clear each type of pronoun by typing {{/ns pronouns}}, {{/ns pronouns accepted}}, and/or {{/ns pronouns unaccepted}} respectively.\n\nInputting joke pronouns ('helicopter', 'meme', etc.) is a tempbannable offense, usually one week to start. Don't do it: it's offensive to many and irritating to most. This is a very firmly enforced rule.\n\n++ Viewing other users' pronoun/gender info\n\nThe easiest way to view other users' information is with the {{/whois}} command, e.g. {{/whois Kufat}}. Some clients including Mibbit are unable to display extra whois information. If your client has this issue, you may also use {{/ns info}} to see a user's configured pronoun and gender details, e.g. {{/ns info Kufat}}.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Staff and Bots]]\n+ Secretary_Helen\n\nSecretary_Helen is #site19's primary bot. Helen is maintained by [[*user DrMagnus]]. When in #site19, you may use Helen to send notes to other users. Helen also manages the banlist for several official channels.\n\n+ crom\n\nCrom provides wiki-related searches. You can use commands like {{.l}} to see **l**atest entries or {{.au}} to look up information on a given **au**thor. Typing the name of an SCP into the channel, e.g. {{SCP-1234}} will bring up information on that SCP.\n\n**Do not bring any of your own bots into this chat without permission. Do not invite our bots into your own channel without permission.**\n\n+ Chat Admins\n\n||~ **Name** ||~ **Chat Status** ||~ **Wiki Status** ||\n|| [[*user Athenodora]] / Dora / Athena_Grey || Chat Admin/Junior IRC Operator || Wiki User ||\n|| [[*user ChaoSera]] || Chat Admin/IRC Operator || Wiki User ||\n|| [[*user Kufat]] || Chat Admin/IRC Admin || Wiki Adjunct Staff ||\n|| [[*user ProcyonLotor]] / Corvus || Chat Admin/IRC Operator (Inactive) || Wiki Moderator ||\n|| [[*user SoullessSingularity]] / Soulless || Chat Admin (Inactive) || Wiki Admin ||\n|| [[*user thedeadlymoose]] || Chat Admin (Inactive) || Wiki Admin ||\n\n+ Chat Operators (Ops)\n\n||~ **Name** ||~ **Chat Status** ||~ **Wiki Status** ||\n|| [[*user DrAkimoto]] || Chat Operator || Wiki Staff ||\n|| [[*user DrBleep]] || Chat Operator/IRC Operator (inactive) || Wiki Admin ||\n|| [[*user Doctor Fullham]] / DrFullham || Chat Operator || Wiki Junior Staff ||\n|| [[*user DrKens]] || Chat Operator || Wiki User ||\n|| [[*user flagsam]] / CuteGirl || Chat Operator || Wiki Junior Staff ||\n|| [[*user ghosteater]] || Chat Operator || Wiki User ||\n|| [[*user ManyMeats]] || Chat Operator (inactive) || Wiki Admin ||\n|| [[*user TheMightyMcB]] || Chat Operator || Wiki Moderator ||\n|| [[*user TyGently]] || Chat Operator || Wiki User ||\n|| [[*user weizhong]] / whyzhong || Chat Operator || Wiki Staff ||\n\n+ Chat Half-Ops (Hops)\n\n||~ **Name** ||~ **Chat Status** ||~ **Wiki Status** ||\n|| [[*user Hexick]] / Hex || Chat Half-Op/IRC Operator || Wiki Moderator ||\n|| [[*user The_Spider_Queen]] || Chat Half-Op || Wiki User ||\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Click Here To Chat]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Have you read the entire chat guide?
