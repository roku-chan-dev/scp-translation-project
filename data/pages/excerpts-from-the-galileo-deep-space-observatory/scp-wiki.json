The GDSO's primary purpose is the discovery, documentation, and research of paranormal phenomena observed outside of the Solar System. As its apparatus was constructed using advanced paratechnology extrapolated from [[[scp-2154|VNP-2154]]] by Phoenix Technologies personnel, the GDSO is capable of observing numerous galaxies in a state coinciding with the time of observation, bypassing the limiting factor of the speed of light.\n\nThe GDSO is a frequent collaborator with Vanguard. Following the 2062 Scranton Prize for Chemistry being jointly awarded to its two founders and Vanguard Xenochemist Paulo Da Silva for their discovery and classification of eleven new elements located on LR-7435-C, the two organizations decided to split custody over the installation. As of 2064, the Observatory is a hub for interstellar research conducted by both the now-separated TTT sub-company and the Vanguard Deep Space Exploration Initiative.\n\nProvided below is a series of excerpts of particular interest from its archives of extrasolar phenomena, as appended by GDSO research staff, attached alongside relevant documentation.

Extra-temporal observations reveal that it has begun its life as a white dwarf and, in spite of the general flow of chronons around it, started turning back into a red giant and then into a regular star. As of writing, the phenomenon is experiencing its main sequence period of existence and is acting as the center of a three-planet star system. The phenomenon is expected to collapse back into a nebula in approximately two million years.\n\n**Further Details:** The phenomenon's nature does not affect the spacetime around it and seems to be limited just to its own surface. Still, according to research, the phenomenon's past does seem to indeed match the expected future of reality around it. So far, observation of its past composition has allowed for the examination and confirmation of the already-expected fates of several celestial bodies in its proximity.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Back to the Future: Regarding Time Beyond Reality\" by Dr. Ilse Reynders, PhD²⁷ and Dr. Harold Blank (Micheals-Reynders University and Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2061)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Kalmaktama\n\n**Distance:** 2406 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is an exoplanet organism consisting entirely of living flesh. Its surface is ridden with numerous organs that appear similar to gigantic eyes, veins, arteries, and muscles, all of which are in a constant state of agitation but are incapable of reaching outside of the planet's equivalent of the Kármán line. Its atmosphere consists of a mixture of oxygen and carbon dioxide, both of which are created and excreted by the megaorganism. Barring the structural irregularities, the phenomenon behaves as expected of any unremarkable celestial body.\n\n**Further Details:** In spite of its nature, the organism displays no signs of sapience or actual intelligence. Whether or not it even is sentient is still debated by scholars worldwide. No matter the answer, it is noteworthy to point out that the phenomenon excretes a passive aura of EVE radiation observable in its atmosphere, which regularly triggers a series of naturally occurring thaumaturgic rituals of unclear purpose. Current hypotheses state that the workings are simply the result of the aura interacting with other parts of the planet's irregular weather and geographical patterns, released due to the lack of a clear intelligence that would control it.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"On the Flesh Moon, the Second Coming of Ion, and Yaldabaoth at Large\" by Klavigar Nadox (The Siberian Institute of Nälkä Heritage, 2060)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Ten-Ninety\n\n**Distance:** 90 187 LY and 764 816 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a planet that through approximately 90% of its orbital period circulates one celestial object. Upon the completion of this stage, it encounters a naturally occurring fold in the ontokinetic fabric of reality, and passes through it only to come out in an entirely different star system, wherein it completes the remaining 10% of its orbital period, encounters another fold, and appears back in its system of origin.\n\n**Further Details:** Although the gravitational pulls of the two celestial bodies the phenomenon orbits around differ widely, this fact does not seem to affect the planet itself, which appears to ontokinetically re-balance its course to be identical in both cases. Prior to the discovery of this mechanism -- as well as the discovery of the naturally occurring folds that allow for the phenomenon's teleportation to even happen -- it was believed that only sapient beings could affect the fabric of reality in such a way that it bends. Though previously theorized by some, the confirmation that this can also be achieved by inanimate phenomena was a major breakthrough in the field of ontokinetics.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"On Naturally Occurring Folds in Spacetime Stability\" by Dr. James Micheals (Micheals-Reynders University, 2063)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Fáfnir's Maw\n\n**Distance:** 8012 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a massive, unknown organism with an appearance vaguely similar to the European depiction of a dragon. Its outer scales are composed of hard, crystalized rock and ice. In place of its head is an array of sharper stones and jagged remains of meteorites, organized in a fashion reminiscent of an arched crown. The phenomenon is coiled in on itself in apparent hibernation at the center of the star system Fáfnir. All celestial bodies of the system orbit it as they normally would a star, though they are geologically dead and lack any atmospheres.\n\n**Further Details:** It was originally believed that the system of Fáfnir was focused around a red giant. Investigation has found that the internal composition of the phenomenon is similar to that of the core of a star, and is undergoing nuclear fusion, albeit at a very slow rate. It is unknown whether this is simply how the organism has evolved within the void of space or if it's evidence that the organism had, in the past, consumed the original star of Fáfnir. \n\nSince discovery, the temperature of the phenomenon has dropped considerably, with its \"wings\" having both shifted approximately 40 000 kilometers from their point of initial discovery.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Out There Be Dragons: An Observation Report on Fáfnir\" by Dr. D.

The positioning and distance between its separate bodies are identical to that of the Epsilon Boötis within the Boötes constellation. The phenomenon's larger star consists entirely of strawberry ice cream, complete with chunks of gargantuan strawberries located within the mass. The second star is entirely unremarkable.\n\n**Further Details:** The ice cream does not seem to be affected in any way by the light and heat emitted by the unremarkable star. Although under normal circumstances it would all melt, the celestial body remains unaffected by any such events and continues existing without any issues. Further research into the system, as directly funded by Chaz Ambrose of Ambrose Restaurants, is currently awaiting approval.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [[[code-name-the-truth|🔗 \"A Glitch in the Matrix: On The Ontokinetic Breakdown Of Reality Nearing Its Edges\" by Dr. Robert Madden (Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2059)]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** {{YOUR MOTHER}}\n\n**Distance:** 2 131 745 650 LY\n\n**Description:** {{YOUR MOTHER}} is a red supergiant with a radius of over 3000 solar radii. {{YOUR MOTHER}} is so large that its size exceeds theoretical predictions for upward limits of stellar mass and size. {{YOUR MOTHER}} is the largest known star in the universe with a correspondingly large gravitational pull.\n\n**Further Details:** {{YOUR MOTHER}} is affected by a semantic anomaly that requires that {{SHE}} be referred to as {{YOUR MOTHER}}. All attempts to bypass this effect by Vanguard Department of Miscommunication personnel alongside Fae name-mages have been met with failure.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [[[domc-hub|🔗 \"No, We Cannot Do Anything About YOUR MOTHER.

As far as observations have shown, they do not require any sustenance that physical beings would need for continued survival and are entirely unaware of the existence of the physical world, by which they mostly remain unbothered.\n\n**Further Details:** The entities do not seem to possess sapiency, sentiency, or any other form of intelligence known to mankind. In spite of this, they continue their existence and journey across the stars without any issues. Whether or not they are truly alive is still a subject of debate. All attempts at contact with the entities have been met with no results; whether by their choice or due to their nature remains unknown.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"A Few Words About Extrasolar and Extrauniversal Fauna\" by Amber Wilson (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, 2071)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Peephole\n\n**Distance:** 267 917 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a distortion in the fabric of space-time that bends reality around it in such a way that it connects its surroundings with a point in space located approximately 600 000 kilometers away from the Earth's surface. With the exception of light, no phenomena -- including matter, energy, and thaumaturgic workings -- are capable of traversing the breach. \n\n**Further Details:** Although observation of the phenomenon with regular GDSO apparatus simply results in the viewer observing the Earth in its current time, utilizing regular technology that does not bypass the limiting factor of the speed of light ends with the results showcasing the Earth in its past, as seen during the Fae Empire era. All resultant observations match the recorded history of the planet. Notable however is the fact that all observations of the Fae Empire city of Arlande, which still exists in the observations, showcase a single //sidhe// figure standing atop the city's tallest spire, staring directly at where the breach is located.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Peeking Through Time\" by Dr. Ilse Reynders, PhD³² (Micheals-Reynders University, 2076)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n\n**Identification:** Sodacannon\n\n**Distance:** Consistently 3 LY away from the Kuiper Belt\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a roughly spherical 100 km^3 mass of carbonated liquid. This liquid is ingestible by most sapient species. [[footnote]] With the exception of [[[nx-14|Abyssal Rodents]]]. [[/footnote]] Its taste has been reported to be sweet and \"similar to apples.\" Any liquid removed from the sphere is replenished through unknown means. \n\n**Further Details:** Upon the phenomenon's initial discovery in 2070, research staff were surprised to find that a series of structures had already been set up around it. Though initially thought to be potential signs of extraterrestrial life, upon further inspection, the structure was revealed to be a fully automated production plant owned by the Coca-Cola Company for their \"Space Orchard\" drink range -- a beverage that had existed since the early 2040s.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Coke Versus Korea and the Lasting Impact of Memetic Hyperadvertisment Campaigns: How a Cider-Like's Jingle Became a Greater Addiction Than Its Sugary Product\" by Han Mi-ae (International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology, 2073)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n\n**Identification:** Beholding\n\n**Distance:** 951 842 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a collection of sixteen objects resembling stars, which remain in a stationary position to the direct east of the galactic center. Referred to as the Hydra Star Cluster, the objects do not match the exact traits of any known classification of stars despite several attempts to do so finding them to possess most traits associated with late-stage red supergiants.\n\n**Further Details:** Individuals who view images of the phenomenon for prolonged periods of time report feelings of intense dread, paranoia, and \"being watched.\" Further research is pending.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Lovecraftian Nonfiction: What Exists Out There?

The image includes the two stars of the system (a blue main sequence star and a red giant), six exoplanets (three terrestrial planets, a super-Earth and two gas giants), their moons and two asteroid belts.

When approached by GDSO personnel, ICSUT has declined to comment.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"On the Dangers of Off-World Teleportation\" by Xenia Dufort (International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology, 2068)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Blank Space\n\n**Distance:** 354 670 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is an area of 3 lightyears in diameter that includes one or more phenomena of unknown properties. At least one phenomenon in the area actively destroys all information about it.\n\n**Further Details:** Originally one or more specific phenomena inside Blank Space were recorded before this information was lost. The exact phenomenon could still be deduced through phenomena in the surrounding space until information about the secondary phenomena was also lost. No deduction concerning Blank Space was possible afterwards. All that remains known about Blank Space is that the amount of information lost to something in Blank Space is growing and that Hawking Radiation was recorded in the area.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [[[scp-2358|🔗 \"Counterconcepts in Space\" by Melinda Williams (Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2058)]]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Solaris Punching Center\n\n**Distance:** 1690 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a hycean exoplanet with an extremely dense ocean covering its surface but lacking an atmosphere. Observation has revealed that the ocean moves on its own, without any interaction with outside forces. Through these movements, complex structures are created at irregular timeframes. The structures usually last for two days until they collapse upon themselves, releasing large amounts of EVE and akiva radiation.\n\n**Further Details:** Closer observation revealed that the structures created by the ocean almost always ended in the appearance of shark-like objects. Furthermore, the event that interrupts the creation of these structures seems to be some kind of thaumaturgical ritual that summons a large ghostly fist over the ocean, which subsequently descends upon the newly formed structure, destroying it.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"The Blooming Study of Solaristics\" by Kelvin Kris (International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology, 2079)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Wand's Comet\n\n**Distance:** 23.178 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a comet consisting almost entirely of gold. The comet's tail is caused by excessive amounts of EVE radiation generated from inside the comet rather than escaping gases as is normal for comets. Wand's Comet's path suggests it might have crossed the Solar System 240 thousand years ago.\n\n**Further Details:** Wand's Comet is wildly believed to be the hiding place of all treasure the mythical Fae pirate Captain Wand stole during their lifetime. This is supported by multiple treasure maps attributed to Captain Wand locating the treasure at relative coordinates that always correspond with the comet's current location. According to the legends, Wand's Comet is filled with artifacts unrivaled in their magic. It supposedly consists out of all kinds of exotic material ranging from irrilite mountains to rivers of mercury. What speaks against these theories is that Captain Wand was active in the 220th millennium BCE during the Yeren-Fae Space Race. The comet was at this time already too far away for any spaceships to reach it and Captain Wand should not have been able to make contact with it.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"The Final Treasure\" by Olivié Gwyneth (The Sidhe Lounge, 2056)]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Heartnel-1\n\n**Distance:** 62 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a small satellite, orbiting a gas giant known as Heartnel-0. Heartnel-1 has no atmosphere, but its surface is covered entirely by a fungal colony. The colony will occasionally release small fungal probes capable of maneuvering through space, which appear to bring mineral resources back to the host planet.\n\n**Further Details:** Observation suggests that Heartnel-2's colony is the result of a collision with a malfunctioning Avyngir deep-space exploration probe. These biomechanical probes were created by Yeren scientists 210,000 years ago, in order to search for life outside of planet Earth. While these probes were designed to lead intelligent life back towards Earth without accidentally seeding planets, it is believed that the programming of these probes degraded over hundreds of thousands of years, causing at least one of them to search for a surface to grow on to. Of the 36 probes launched by the Avyngir exploration program, only four are accounted for.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"The Original Voyager Program: Avyngir's Attempt to Find Life Beyond the Stars\" by Dr. Alison Stark and A.

Its main difference from Earth lies in the atmosphere's high level of methane and 90% of all land on the exoplanet consisting of grassland. At regular points around the exoplanet, the grassland is interrupted by crop fields instead. The grasslands are inhabited by the only mammal native to the planet: the cow as found on Earth.\n\n**Further Details:** The fact that Exotaurus is inhabited solely by cows was not observable by the GDSO and was only confirmed on a mission to the exoplanet much later. All cattle tested on Exotaurus have been found to be genetically identical to cattle on Earth. The crop fields on the exoplanet connect to crop circles on Earth, serving as a bi-directional Way.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Grand Cow Theft by the Orthothan Fae\" (Archive of the International Court for the Paranormal)]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Syzygy\n\n**Distance:** 40 618 927 755 ± 12 545 900 LY\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon is a chain of galaxies ranging from 3600 to 425 000 light-years in diameter, appearing to be spaced evenly apart in a straight line on the order of 10 light-years.

Whilst the majority of voids are simply regions of space-time containing very few galaxies relative to the rest of the observable universe, the phenomenon is completely devoid of any and all celestial objects. Despite this fact, individuals directly observing the phenomenon will perceive a pair of dim, faint lights existing at the center of the supervoid’s frame of reference accompanied by inaudible whispering.\n\n**Further Details:** The seemingly intangible nature of the phenomenon and its capability of inducing audiovisual hallucinations within the observer have been related to the existence of a being recorded within the oratories of the ancient Fae as the Leviathan; //\"There are many among my contemporaries who liken the celestial heavens to the depths of the ocean. Eidetic memories of once crossing the Neverdreamt Sea and witnessing strange, glowing animals traversing beneath the ocean's surface conjure up images of stars sailing upon moonless skies.

The only macroscopic life is an enormous colonial organism with similarities to coral, lichen, and microbial mats, inhabiting an inland expanse of lakes and wetlands with an area of almost 700,000 square kilometers. Though this organism is photosynthetic (as evinced by the presence of chlorophyll and similar pigments), the planet's atmosphere contains very little oxygen.\n\n**Further Details:** Earth's atmosphere first became oxygenated 2.4 billion years ago, approximately 2 billion years after the planet's formation, but corals and lichens only evolved within the last few hundred million years. Whalefall's young age (~1.5 billion years) would seem to preclude a local origin for this complex organism, and its unoxygenated atmosphere indicates that the colonial organism has not existed for a long time, geologically speaking.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Possible Panspermia Events During the Yeren-Fae Space Race\" by Dr. Kothaar Astrix (Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2049)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Textbook\n\n**Distance:** 1 000 000 LY\n\n**Description:** A star system consisting of one K-class star, three terrestrial planets, and two gas giants.

The surface temperature of the sphere has been measured at approximately 6000 Kelvin. \n\n**Further Details:** The object was initially mistaken for an anomalously large star, but subsequent measurements indicate a mass only a few times greater than the Sun, suggesting that the sphere is very thin and mostly hollow.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Crystal Spheres and Other Variant Solar Systems\" by Dr. Kothaar Astrix (Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2051)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** The Broken One\n\n**Distance:** 2 537 400 LY\n\n**Description:** A G-type main sequence star that, despite its temperature, is a dark red color consistent with much smaller or older stars. Organisms exposed to the light of this star \"melt\" into gelatinous forms that retain consciousness and mobility but display radically altered psychology. Observations with non-anomalous telescopes show that the star once had a more typical appearance, indicating that its current state is the result of a transformation experienced sometime in the last 2 million years.\n\n**Further Details:** The effects of the Broken One's light at intergalactic distances, if any, are unknown. The precise time of its transformation, and therefore the time when its potentially dangerous altered light will arrive at Earth, is likewise unclear.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Proposal for the Deployment of a Starshade Between Earth and the Broken One\" by Dr. Kothaar Astrix (Vanguard Academic Consortium, 2052)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Myxian Dawn\n\n**Distance:** 43 998 079 083 LY\n\n**Description:** A roughly Earth-sized planet, with (presumed) unexceptional geological and atmospheric compositions.

Notably, meticulous observations reveal the forceful expulsion of voluminous dust clouds accompanied by intense luminosity into the encompassing spatial vacuity. This phenomenon prompts further scrutiny to elucidate its underlying mechanisms and validate the proposed association with hypothetical white holes.\n\n**Further Details:** Approximately 16 minutes subsequent to initial detection, the observed white holes ceased the expulsion of matter, initiating a consequential process of self-induced collapse due to the gravitational forces arising from their own mass. This noteworthy transition prompts a deeper investigation into the temporal dynamics of white hole behavior, particularly the mechanisms governing cessation of matter ejection and the ensuing gravitational collapse.\n\n**Attached Documentation:** [# 🔗 \"Holes in Reality\" by Dr. Quasar Starfield, (Space Training Administration and Research Command, 2090)]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"filebox\" data-title=\"Entry\"]]\n**Identification:** Starstruck\n\n**Distance:** 396,423 LY\n\n**Description:** A largely uniform pulsar star.
