Plague is too common in this time\nAnd skin is feasted as it festers, boiled\nAnd young babes die, mouths mewling, caked in grime. \nBy Caduceus, is this world all spoiled?\nBy winter, some say, this world will be gone!\nYe Elder Gods of Greece, guide my wise Way. \nHermes, kind runner, see my will is done,\nDeliver unto Zeus as I shall pray.\nBestow upon me, healthful, magic staves,\nThe holy spice within them shall save life,\nAnd with them, fill this world's diseased caves,\nThey hold the thing to end all this world's strife.\nMy god, to end this horrible disease,\nIf I'd that chance, it instantly I'd seize!\n\n\n//[Enter Facade]//\n\n**Facade:**\nLord Doctor.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nAh, Young Facade!  Young, beautiful Facade!\nThy face unmarked by the treacherous pus!\nReturned from the Italian lands,\nWhat tidings dost thou bring?\n\n**Facade:**\nVenice has been taken by boils.\nSpices have been scattered, \nDoors have been cross'd and all thresholds twice-cross'd.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nMethinks a threshold twice-cross'd makes for a poor barrier.\n\n**Facade:** \nIndeed, my lord.\n\n**The Doctor:** \nTell me, what of the children?\n\n**Facade:**\nBabes and monsieur of all kinds lay in the streets, \nClinging to corpses as they expire.\nSome e'en cling as they are thrown into flames.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nO Lord!\n\n**Facade:**\nSome in Venice are saying that the Lord has forsaken us,\nAnd that we are now at the whims of some fey creatures.\nSome have poisoned the wells,\nSo that fewer suffer.\n\n//[He Coughs]//\nUgh! Ugh Ugh! Ugh!\n\n**The Doctor:**\nWhat is this cough!\n\n**Facade:**\nIt is naught, my lord. \nA simple choke.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nFacade, show me thine under-arm.\n\n**Facade:**\nNay, my lord, I cannot.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nI command thee, show me at once, \nOr be dismissed!\n\n**Facade:**\nI beg of you, my lord, you shall be mad.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nAnd I say that madness will wrought me\nIf thou dost not show me thine underarm!\n\n//[Facade lifts his shirt]//\n\n**The Doctor:**\nOh, young Facade... thou hast the Pox.\n\n**Facade:**\nAnd I have twice-cross'd your threshold. \nYou as good as have it now, Lord Doctor.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nFacade, why!\n\n**Facade:**\nI simply wanted you to see me once more,\nBefore I became unto a corpse. \n\n//[He draws a knife]//\n\nAnd thus, Lord, I say-\n\n**The Doctor:**\nFacade! Desist!\n\n**Facade:**\nAdieu, to this long, dying world,\nAnd adieu to this plague.\n\n//[He stabs himself]//\n\nMarry, Forgive Me!\n\n//[He dies]//\n\n**The Doctor:**\nO, what a fright this is!\nHow putrid this plague!\nHow rank this disease that touches me!\nMy heart, it weakens.\nO cruel fate! Cruel, cruel fate!\nI feel the boils upon my heart!\n\nFrom thy bosom, I shall wrest thy dagger, \nAnd plunge it into the heart of the plague itself!\n\n//[Exit, with body in a cart]//\n\n------\n//Act Secundus, Scene Tertius//\n//A Hill in the Dark Forest//\n//[Enter The Doctor and Antiquas with spades]//\n\n**Antiquas:**\nSoft, Herr Doktor. \nWe have arrived.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nWhat is this damned place?\n\n**Antiquas:**\nThis was once a fey hill. \nThe fair folk gathered here,\nTo partake in merriment,\nTo have endless, lust-filled nights\nWith human companions, \nAnd devour them in the morn.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nWherefore hast thou brought me to such a pagan place?\n\n**Antiquas:**\nWe could hardly mount such an expedition in the city, m'lord.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nAye, but a fair hill?\n\n**Antiquas:**\nThe hill simply looks fair, m'lord. \nInside of it, there are tunnels innumerable, \nCaves infinite, \nWhere the fair folk capered nimbly, \nMaking love and luring foolish men and women\nInto their orgiastic deaths.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nAye, but why have I been brought here?\nI mean to stop the plague, \nNot find a wife.\n\n**Antiquas:**\nStand at the Hill-Top,\nAnd crow as a hen does\nWhen eating seed.\nDo this thrice,\nAnd thy way shall be wrought,\nMy Lord.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nSo be it.\n\n//[He walks to the hill top]//\n\nPocks! Pocks! Pocks!\n\n//[Exit Antiquas, Enter Pocks]//\n\nO Lord! What art thou?\n\n**Pocks:**\nWhy, I am the thing thou hast summoned.\nI am Pocks, a simple goblin.\nThou hast summoned me, so I shall grant thee one wish,\nAnd one wish alone.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nThere is a plague upon this world.\n\n**Pocks:**\nAye, it is known. \nThis plague has been present since creation.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nSince creation!\n\n**Pocks:**\nIndeed.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nThen I must cure it! \nAt once!\nI wish to be the doctor that cures this horrid, horrid plague,\nAnd save the Earth, for once and for all time!\n\n**Pocks:**\nA noble endeavour indeed.\n\nNow firstly, take a doctor's wooden mask,\nAnd bathe in argent, supple, melted soft.\nThis, the next part of this great, noble task,\nThis phrase say thrice, whilst holding it aloft:\n\"O midwife of the blood-red, cursed king!\nO pagan, horrible creatures of long yore!\nMy pleas be heard, from auld grimoires I sing!\nBestow to me knowledge of elder lore!\"\nThen, fill the beak with medical spices:\nCarnations, roses, mint, cherry, a sponge,\nA leaf of gold for a life, saved from vice.\nThe mask is done, all toxins are expung'd.\nAnd so, this enchantment complete, this spell\nShall send this great plague straight into black hell.\n\n**The Doctor:**\nIt shall be done! \nMarry, this pagan, cursed rite,\nShall be done!\nFor the love of God!\n\n**Pocks:**\nYes, for the love of god.\nGod'be'wi'ye. \n\n//[Exit Pocks]//\n\n**The Doctor:**\nIt shall be done. \nI shall retrieve the mask, \nAnd the spices,\nAnd my cure will be most effective.\n\n[Exit Doctor, enter Antiquas and Pocks]\n\n**Pocks:**\nPoor, foolish doctor.\n\n**Antiquas:**\nHe had a good humour about him,\nAll fair and balanced,\n'til his Facade was taken away.\n'Tis a pity.\n\n**Pocks:**\nAye, 'tis, for his sake.\nCome, Sir Antiquas,\nLet us follow him through the Way.\nI wish to be present \nWhen the Doctor cures his first patient.\n\n//[Exeunt]//\n------\n//Act Tertius, Scene Secundus//\n//The Deathbed of Herr Arnold Bode, During a Storm//\n\n//[Enter Bode, His wife Ylva, their servant Driscoll]//\n\n**Bode:**\nI feel God close to me.\nI fear I join him on this night,\nAnd if I do, I fear it will not be heaven. \n\n**Ylva:**\nI have sent for a doctor, my love.\nThou shalt not suffer.\n\n//[Bode coughs]//\n\nLove, pray rest thyself on the bed.\n\n**Driscoll:**\nLet you end your life as you began it, lord.\nSwaddled in bed clothes, \nSurrounded by loved ones,\nAnd servants. \n\n**Bode:**\nIt is not my time.\nIt cannot be my time.\n\n//[A loud rapping is heard]//\n\nWho calls at this hour?\nIn such a tempest?\n\n**Ylva:**\nIt is the doctor, most likely. \nDriscoll, prithee, fetch him.\n\n**Driscoll:**\n(aside) She has craved me for many nights.\nIt is only now that she is saying it,\nAnd it is in reference to fetching.\nAh, what a life.\n\n[Exit Driscoll.

A monster in Herr Bode's room!\nHe was pecking out his eyes!\nThrough them, humour was being extracted.\nI saw the monster drink his blood, \nConsume his vitreous humour,\nAnd smear black bile over its beak!\n\n**Driscoll:**\nSurely thou art mistaken.\nDoctor Bartholemew is no monster,\nHe is a simple man.\n\n**Housemaid:**\nThat is unlike any doctor I have ever seen!\n\n//[Enter Doctor]//\n\nSee, he comes!\n\n**The Doctor:**\nHe has been cured. \nCome hither, Herr Bode.\n\n//[Enter Bode, blood over front, mask on face and exit Housemaid, crying out]//\n\n**Ylva:**\nOh dear God!\n\n**Driscoll:**\nWhat is the meaning of this?\n\n**Bode:**\nFear not, loved ones.\nI have been cured of the plague.\nThis cure shall be spread to you as well.\n\n//[Driscoll draws a dagger and attacks Bode.]//\n\n**Driscoll:**\nDie, Abomination!\n\n//[They fight.
