The Groups of Interest are the following:\n* [[[goc-hub-page|Group of Interest-015 (“Global Occult Coalition”)]]]\n* [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|Group of Interest-021 (“Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.)]]]\n* [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Group of Interest-031 (“Unusual Incidents Unit”)]]]\nEach Group of Interest, as well as the Foundation, must exchange possession of SCP-6126 every three months to avoid any anomalous effects manifested by SCP-6126.\n\nSCP-6126 must be contained inside a tempered glass case to avoid any injuries to the anomaly and locked down inside a containment locker; the containment locker should include a light device and a backup Scranton Reality Anchor[[footnote]] While the device does not completely counter SCP-6126's ontokinetic effects because of the particular manifestation of its abilities, it decreases the impact of its effects. [[/footnote]]. Mobile Task Force Beta-23 (“Northern Centaurs”) is tasked with the transportation and deployment to facilities of the allied Groups of Interest mentioned above, and if the occasion requires it, protect SCP-6126 from any offense by opposing individuals or Groups of Interest. SCP-6126 is currently contained at Site-17. SCP-6126 is allowed weekly psychological sessions specifically with on-site therapist Dr. Maxwell Cunningham, as well as being part of Site-17’s residential community to improve SCP-6126’s well-being and interaction with other personnel. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6126 is the decapitated head of Doroteo Arango[[footnote]] Popularly known as Pancho Villa, a Mexican revolutionary and bandit at the start of the 20th Century who participated in the Mexican Revolution. He was assassinated on July 20, 1923. [[/footnote]]. SCP-6126 possesses sapience and is biologically immortal, as well as ontokinetic abilities that allow it to negatively affect the individual that owns SCP-6126. Despite this, SCP-6126 does not have control of its abilities and is a rather involuntary response. The effects of SCP-6126 start to manifest after three months have passed and last until the death of the owner.\n\nSCP-6126 was discovered on 05/20/91 at a Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. storage facility at the outskirts of Richmond County, New York. Mobile Task Force Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”) had several undercover operatives surveilling the area before the start of the raid. Nine anomalous objects were recovered, including SCP-6126. SCP-6126 was hostile when obtained, and displayed signs of confusion when questioned. However, it did not present any difficulties of capture. SCP-6126’s containment was completed on 05/30/91 when transferred to Site-88. SCP-6126’s project was placed under the guidance of Dr. William Kent.\n\n**Addendum 6126.1:** Selected Interviews\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.1\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.1\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n \n**Interviewer:** Dr. William Kent, Head Researcher \n\n**Date:** 06/01/91\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Greetings, SCP-6126. My name is Dr. William Kent. I have been informed that you were initially confused when questioned by the task force that discovered you. Do you have any questions about myself or the organization I work for?\n\n[SCP-6126 remains silent.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** I would recommend that you tell me any initial doubts you might have, but I will still clear some information to you. I work for an organization called the SCP Foundation, and our mission is to discover and contain any anomalous objects such as yourself - is that clear for you?\n\n[SCP-6126 remains silent.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** I will take that as a yes. That is the collective mission of the organization. As for myself, I am the Head Researcher - which means I oversee the project involving you, SCP-6126. So, I came here to ask for something if you do not mind. \n\n[SCP-6126 stares at Dr. Kent. Dr. Kent sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Do you even understand what I am trying to say? Maybe I need a translator, it would make sense that you were so confused when the task force first interrogated you-\n\n**SCP-6126:** I do understand what you’re saying, asshole.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Great, someone knows English. Did you pay attention to what I previously said?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** So why didn’t you answer anything about what I said?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Ve a este cabrón.[[footnote]] Look at this dumbass. [[/footnote]] Why should I answer anything you say?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** The real question is why you should not. If you cooperate with us, your containment could be as lax as you wish compared to other anomalies. You help me, and I help you. It does not sound so bad for an agreement, is it not?\n\n**SCP-6126:** It sounds like a lot of bullcrap, I’ll give you that much.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** You are probably not thinking straight - you might still have a bad impression after your discovery. I will give you a week to think about what I just said, all right? Maybe you can then rationalize some of your emotions.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** You are probably not thinking straight. You might think we are the same as Marshall, Carter, and Dark, but I can assure you that we are not. I will give you a week to think about what I just said, all right? You might think clearly if you have some time alone.\n\n[Dr. Kent raises from his seat, grabbing the recorder.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** I will see you next week, and I expect a response from you. And until then, farewell.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Kent requested information regarding SCP-6126 prior to its official death on historical records. Different sources include the [[[scp-4078| Department of Public History]]] and records from Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n\nThe request was approved, yet the results were unsuccessful. The Foundation researched historical records both inside and outside the organization, but no information was found aside from unsubstantiated hypotheses. Meanwhile, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. denied access to any records on SCP-6126 due to the Foundation’s raid on the GoI’s facility. Tensions with Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. stagnated after this event.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.2\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.2\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. William Kent\n\n**Date:** 06/08/91\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Nice to see you again, SCP-6126. How was your first week at containment?\n\n[SCP-6126 remains unresponsive.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** You will get used to it. Most anomalies do not get accustomed to containment after a few weeks, months, or even years. And, unfortunately, some never do. But hey, there is not much we can do about it, right?\n\n[SCP-6126 still remains unresponsive.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Changing the subject, I gave you a whole week to think of what I told you - you can even ask what your possible privileges could be if you are interested. So, are you interested in opening up and helping me here?\n\n[SCP-6126 glances at Dr. Kent.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Fuck you.\n\n[Dr. Kent sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** You just threw a golden opportunity few have. You could even ask for any other privileges you might be interested in.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Let me guess, my little containment locker will be two times bigger and you’re gonna tell me bedtime stories.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** We could do that if you want to.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Fuck you.\n\n[Dr. Kent sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Could you do me a favor here? I have a record to keep - out of all the anomalies I’ve worked with, you are the most complicated by this point. I am just trying to look good for my superiors. If you could cooperate, we can each get what we want and get a piece of the cake. \n\n**SCP-6126:** Oh, so you want to be on good terms with your boss? Yeah, I don’t work with boot lickers - less reason for me to cooperate.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Fine then.\n\n[Dr. Kent reaches for his suitcase, pulling some documents from it.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** When we finished last week’s interrogation, I requested all the information the Foundation could find about you in historical records. Of course, we could not find anything of your current state from any official records. Marshall, Carter, and Dark were not so open to cooperating either because of the raid. You do realize you are complicating everything, right?\n\n[SCP-6126 chuckles.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Una pínche patada en los huevos, no?[[footnote]] A fucking kick in the balls, no? [[/footnote]] Must be a fucking headache for you, bet you don’t even know where to start.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Maybe not where to start, but I know where not to end.\n\n**SCP-6126:** What is that supposed to mean?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** There is a process I like to do in life, it is incredibly practical and I have proved that it works. It is all a matter of crossing the most unlikely or impractical possibilities. I will start with finding the perpetrator, and a few cards start to fall. The Mexican government when you were alive. It is a fact that your government back then murdered you. Yet, it would not make any sense for them to decapitate you. Why do something that will affect the public if we already killed our adversary? I thought. Besides, it does not make sense that you died in Mexico and we found you in America if your government was so interested in keeping you.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Wow, what a great discovery of finding who's //not// the one who butchered my head. Tch, no wonder why you are the head of this project. Let me ask you, what about the other possible culprits? I'm sure as hell you can't use your method for every single possibility you might come up with.\n\n[Dr. Kent raises his hand.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** If I may continue, I want to propose another candidate that you may be familiar with: the American government. I am sure that names such as Woodrow Wilson and John Pershing sound familiar to you, correct? Back in 1916, the American government hunted you down on Chihuahua after you destroyed the city of Columbus—\n\n**SCP-6126:** Y’all fucking deserved it, trying to sell me fake ammo those motherfucking gringos.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** —Yet, you were not found and the army retreated back to America, and a year later the nation would enter the Great War, focusing on more important events. With those facts taken into account, we can conclude that both the Mexican and American governments are the least suitable culprits behind your decapitation.\n\n**SCP-6126:** And how are you so sure about what you're telling me right now, eh?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Easy. Now, if you have not realized by this point the Foundation is not an average government agency - we do not identify as one, to begin with. However, we do receive funds from various governments across the globe. Would you like to guess which of those governments are the largest of our fundraisers? The American government and they were more than happy to borrow any restricted documents that may mention your name, SCP-6126. You are practically nonexistent in their records.\n\n[SCP-6126 groans.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** What are you trying to get here?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** To show you that you cannot refuse to cooperate with me. You may distract and difficult my work as hard as you can, but I will find out about everything sooner or later. And by demonstrating this to you, you will see how pointless your efforts of rebellion are. So, to ease my work and your life in containment both now and in the future, I would recommend you to cooperate. Do you understand what I am trying to get here now?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** \n\n**SCP-6126:** I do, Kenny. And I just want to tell you that you are a damn idiot if you think your little conclusions will convince me to cooperate.\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Why would that be?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Easy, because I've seen people like you before between the Marshall ranks. People who think that because they have power they can do whatever the fuck they want and nothing will happen to them, but certainly don't know that they can't control who they're pushing. You got nothing for me to cooperate.\n\n[Dr. Kent sighs, his voice rising.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Perhaps I’ve been too generous by this point. I am giving you one last opportunity for you to cooperate. Otherwise, I may enact some changes in your containment that are the complete opposite of what I offered.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Meaning?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Meaning that I can make your life in containment unbearable--\n\n**SCP-6126:** //And?// Do you seriously believe what you're saying scares me? That you are so different from the people Marshall sold me to? I've seen cozier places in those mansions, this is just a prison. Go ahead, put me in a locker. It ain't so different from being a trophy or a historical artifact. Do you know why Kenny? Because //I can't fucking move//. I'll continue living while you sooner or later will die, and all those threats you told would have been for nothing.\n\n[Dr. Kent sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Fine, do whatever you wish. I will come up with something, and you will talk.\n\n[Dr. Kent grabs his clipboard and the recording device, before looking at SCP-6126.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Thank you, by the way.\n\n**SCP-6126:** What are you talking about now?\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Did you just forget what you said? Historical artifact, hmm? Trophy? I already have an idea of the kind of people who owned you — and I didn't even need to ask.\n\n[Dr. Kent smiles at SCP-6126.]\n\n**Dr. Kent:** Have a great day, SCP-6126, and get some rest. You will need from here forward, after all.\n\n**SCP-6126:** …You motherfu—\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** After the end of the second interview between Dr. William Kent and SCP-6126, Dr. Kent decided to stop doing interviews directly with SCP-6126 and just supervise them from that moment forward. Dr. Kent decided to integrate a [[[containment-psychiatry-orientation|containment psychiatrist]]] to the project, proposing that an outsider of the project could be beneficial to obtain information regarding SCP-6126 and gain the confidence of the anomaly.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.3\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.3\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maxwell Cunningham\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview was supervised by Dr. William Kent. Dr. Cunningham was chosen to conduct the weekly interrogations with SCP-6126, under the guise of psychological evaluations. The following interview was supervised by Dr. William Kent.\n\n**Date:** 06/15/91\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Hey, 6126. How are you feeling today? It is nice to meet you, I am Dr. Maxwell Cunningham. Feel free to call however you feel more comfortable.\n\n**SCP-6126:** What is this?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Dr. Kent took a second look at yesterday’s interview. He realized that he was not arriving anywhere with you. So, I was appointed to--\n\n**SCP-6126:** No no, I get that. What I mean, is what are you doing here?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** That is what I was about to say: I was appointed to work with you and have a session each week. I am a containment psychiatrist, so it is my duty to check with my patients. You know, to check on your well-being and check how are you doing.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Oh, sure thing. And what happened to Kenny? Did he run off like the little bitch he is?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** At the moment, Dr. Kent is supervising the interview. [Dr. Cunningham turns around and points with his sight at the camera on the corner.] Dr. Kent was also worried that the information that may share with us could be too… How can I say this? Personal? So, he decided to find the right candidate and here I am.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Worried? That son-of-a-bitch worried about me? Yeah, right. The only thing he's worried about is to keep his damn job.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Regardless of what he may want or thinks, I want to help you. Genuinely.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Genuinely? You said that fucking bastard hired you cause he thought you would be a good pet for you to get the answers he wants. If that ain’t being a boot licker, then what is?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham scratches the back of his head.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Well, I would not call myself a boot licker for working for my superior, but let us just skip that detail for the moment. Regardless, do Dr. Kent’s intentions matter compared to mine? You may look at my job that way, and maybe you could be right. But I do not think that takes away my responsibility as your containment psychiatrist. I do not feel like just sitting here and getting answers if you do not get something in return. I just want to lend you a hand.\n\n[SCP-6126 stares at Dr. Cunningham for a while, the conversation falling in silence for a moment.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Uh- No pun intended, of course.\n\n**SCP-6126:** ...Right. Anyway, what makes you think I want your hand, huh? You come here like you know everything about me.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Not at all, that is why I am here in the first: to get to know about you. Do you want to know what I do know about you? The information Dr. Kent managed to obtain from the last two interviews you had with him, as well as the research he did. I am not as worried as Dr. Kent about obtaining the information he needs, but rather the way you were treated. I am just… starting to see a pattern here.\n\n[SCP-6126 raises an eyebrow.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** A pattern?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham shakes his head.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Do not worry about it, you should not be concerned about it. I was just rambling at the end there. Look, the point is that the way he treated you was…\n\n[Dr. Cunningham looks around him and gets closer to SCP-6126's glass case, using his hand to cover his mouth.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Inhumane, to say the least.\n\n**SCP-6126:** No shit. What makes you say that? And why are you doing that, anyway? Dr. Kent is monitoring this session, you just said that.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You managed to figure it out on your own those last two sessions, but he first tried to convince you by giving you privileges. When that did not work, he tried to logically convince you that it was pointless for you not to cooperate. Finally, he threatened you. Is that no more inhumane to do to the anomalies that we are supposed to protect?\n\n[SCP-6126 does not respond.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I know I should not be doing this. I am sure that Dr. Kent will not like this, but I have a feeling he will let it slide for just this occasion. If not, Dr. Kent would have terminated the session by this point. Right now, I am offering to be on your side. If you do not want my help, I will not insist anymore. But then, you will not have anyone to be there for you. So please, please consider what I am telling. \n\n[SCP-6126 remains silent for a moment, then whispers back to Dr. Cunningham.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Seriously, why the hell bother?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Is that not the whole point of being a doctor - of bothering, of helping other people? I am just saying that if there is anything you want to tell me, anything you want to get your weight off, I can be there to listen. That is barely what I can do at this job.\n\n[SCP-6126 lowers its sight.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What do you think?\n\n**SCP-6126:** …I hope you are right here.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I hope that I am.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham backs down.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I figure this could take a while for you to process. Do you wish to start at the moment or wait until next week?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Next week. I want to get prepared for this.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** As you wish, I will see you next week.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Kent meets with Dr. Cunningham after terminating the interview, verbally reprimanding Dr. Cunningham because of stating his thoughts about Dr. Kent - seeing it as insulting and unnecessary. However, Dr. Kent said he would not take any action against Dr. Cunningham because of his “unorthodox methods” compared to the rest of the Containment Psychiatry Division, since it helped SCP-6126 to cooperate on sharing the information the anomaly might have.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.4\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.4\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maxwell Cunningham\n\n**Date:** 06/22/81\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Hello, 6126. Are you feeling alright?\n\n**SCP-6126:** If I'm honest, doc, not really.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Do you want to tell me the reason?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Well, I had a whole week to prepare myself for this. And still, it doesn't feel like it was enough.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I could post-pone the interview if you are not yet comfortable.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nah nah. I made a promise, so I’ll keep my word. Besides, better now than never, know what I mean?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I do. If you are comfortable enough, we can start at the beginning: how you came back to life. Do you have any idea of who the perpetrator was or the methods used on yourself?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I’ll have to disappoint you there, doc. I couldn’t figure out who were the people that did bring me back to life, nor what exactly they did to do so. I suppose some sort of cult.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Do you at least remember how these people looked like?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nah, my mind wasn’t working that moment. I felt dizzy and so sensitive around me. I could hear buzzing in my ears, it felt like the noise the gunshots left when you pulled the trigger. My sight was so blurry, I thought I was going blind. Even if I wanted to, I just couldn’t figure out what the hell was happening. I was so goddamn tired I lost consciousness again, thought Saint Peter was calling my name. But…\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** But…?\n\n**SCP-6126:** But fuck, I didn't have the luck of staying dead. No, that bastard had to bring me back to life.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And who was this person?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Who? I’ll tell you who. That sadistic motherfucker piece of shit gringo Hearst. William. Randolph. Hearst[[footnote]] William Randolph Hearst was an American businessman, newspaper publisher, and politician mostly remembered for developing the United States' largest media corporation, Hearst Communications. Deceased on August 14, 1951, because of a myocardial infarction.[[/footnote]]. That’s the motherfucker who brought me back to life.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Hearst? The former owner of the newspapers chain?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah, thanks for emphasizing the former by the way.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Alright. And do you know why did he decide to bring you back to life?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Oh, shit. That I know? Oh, I found that as soon as I discovered what kind of situation I got into. You see, he had a fireplace and on the wall he had the head of a freaking moose hanging. I was just below it, on the shelf. Sometimes he would just sit in his fucking leather chair, grab a bottle of any goddamn expensive alcohol he could drink, and turn on the fireplace. The heat made me sweat like if I was back in the Chihuahuan Desert. And he just sat in there, drinking and looking at me with his dumbass grin. I was… I was his trophy.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You were his trophy? I just want to ask you this, you do not have to if you do not want to. Why did Hearst want your head in the first place, and why alive?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nah, don’t worry. He never told me why he did it - not as he answered to anything I asked. Most likely it was due to revenge. You see, Hearst had a big patch of land in the region I come from. When the revolution came, I attacked his estates and stole tens of thousands of his cattle. Of course, he was pissed. And when I attacked the town of Columbus, he went rampage against me in the North American newspapers. “Monster of brutality and cruelty,” he called me. Made quite a name for me, you know?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You sound quite proud of yourself.\n\n**SCP-6126:** It sounds quite ironic to me - Hearst of all people calling me a monster. Monstrous should be sensationalizing the news, monstrous should be acquiring thousands of acres of land in a country that is not his while the common man has nothing, monstrous should be cutting the head of someone he hates and bringing him back to life. It isn’t pride, doc, it’s pissing other people because of telling them what’s wrong.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So that’s what you felt during your time with Hearst? Anger against him?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Of course. Who wouldn’t be pissed off because you’re not alive under your own terms?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And you mentioned that Hearst did not respond to anything you said. Does that include all the insults you told him?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah, so?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So how did you feel when Hearst did not answer those insults? Did you feel more annoyed by it?\n\n**SCP-6126:** …What are you trying to get at?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I am just trying to understand your point of view on all of this that you experienced.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Well… I haven’t actually considered that point of view too. But if I have to think about it right now, you could say I was… I don’t know, I despaired.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Why is that?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Think about it, doc - you are known as this great rebellious bandit, as this force, this monster that they called me that used to obliterate entire every ground you touched. Almost a symbol, if you want to see it that way, by the people who suffered and suffer what you went through. And then, you can’t move. You can’t do anything. You’re trapped in a glass case, just like this moment, by the same people you were fighting against - by the same person who called you a monster. And he doesn’t even bother to call you back when you do. \n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So, of what I could understand - please clarify if I get something wrong - is that your experience with Hearst made you think that you are not the same person before your decapitation because you were… powerless. Is that correct?\n\n**SCP-6126:** You make me sound like if I would allow myself to fall for that prick.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** That is not my intention, I was just-\n\n**SCP-6126:** Listen here, Max. I may have told you this, and I did it because you’re supposed to listen to what I have to say. I said what came into my mind, alright?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Sure, my bad. I will avoid that kind of mistake with you.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Good… But yeah, maybe I felt that way - but I still had the spirit, you know? I wasn’t going to let him push me around. Maybe Hearst would not budge, but I tried my best - hey, sometimes it looked like I was about to achieve it.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You really know how to irritate others, do you not? You even managed with Dr. Kent.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Damn straight. Kenny was an easy target, though.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And how much time did you spend like that with Hearst?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I can’t really say, but ever since I was brought back to life until… 1953? If my mind still works, it should be that. So around two decades. I had to deal with that motherfucker for twenty goddamn years.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What exactly happened in 1951? Did Hearst pass away that year?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Died, perished, departed, went straight to hell. But yes, he died that year. And the worst thing of all, the son of a bitch died in peace. Because of a goddamn stroke. In his bed. After falling into a goddamn coma. Not only was he a millionaire but a millionaire who died a sweet death. \n\n[SCP-6126 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** At least he’s dead, so I can’t complain.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I guess you cannot. [Dr. Cunningham looks at the room’s clock.] Our session is just about to finish in a few minutes, so I will ask you some questions to wrap this up.\n\n**SCP-6126:** What is it?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So, the mobile task force discovered you in a storage facility owned by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. Was this the same organization that discovered you after Hearst’s death?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah. They didn’t take too long to come for me, just after Hearst was buried six feet underground. You see, I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. Now, I didn’t like what I was through then, but being a living talking head doesn’t give you a lot of options to live, ya know? So, these guys in suits come around all the paranormal shit Hearst had and just took them. Including me. That’s when I met them.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what happened next?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Sold me in an auction, of course. Figured they would take try to make as much money from me. Sold me as a “lost piece of history” and “the living bust of a legend”. So much show for a talking head, am I right? And there I was, my ownership being changed from one rich dude to another. Lucky me, right?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Terribly. Do you remember the name of the person who bought you at that auction?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Just a guy called John P. Gadsby.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham writes down on his notes.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And we are done. How did it go for your first time in this kind of session? Do you like the format?\n\n**SCP-6126:** It ain’t bad, it’s a bit personal but I’ll get used to it.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Great! Any suggestions or comments, I am always listening. Do you have anything else to say before I turn off the recording?\n\n[SCP-6126 stares at Dr. Cunningham, then grins.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Thanks, doc.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Kent once again verbally reprimanded Dr. Cunningham, and has decided to stop supervising the sessions. He concluded that because of the advancement Dr. Cunningham had with SCP-6126, Dr. Cunningham was allowed to continue the interviews with SCP-6126 on his own.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.5\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.5\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maxwell Cunningham\n\n**Date:** 06/29/91\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Hello again. How did it go after last week’s session? Anything, in particular, you might want to tell me?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Hey, doc. I’ve been doing alright, I was kinda wishing for this session if I’m honest. What about you?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Well, looks like so far so good for you. It seems that you are getting used to this, if we keep this path maybe this could have a great impact on yourself. [Dr. Cunningham scratches the back of his neck.] That is an odd question coming from my patients, but thank you for asking. A few ups and downs as always, especially back home. There is no need for you to worry about it.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Sure you don’t wanna talk about it?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham slightly chuckles.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Hey, I am supposed to be the one to help you out here, right? I do appreciate your concern, but right now I want to focus on you first. Maybe when we finish this topic, I can tell you more about my personal life. How does that sound to you?\n\n**SCP-6126:** …Aight.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Thank you. Before we start with John P. Gadsby, Dr. Kent gave me a note with some questions written in it about some concerns he had regarding the death of Hearst, as well as Hearst’s relationship with Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. Does that sound good to you?\n\n[SCP-6126 drifts its sight from Dr. Cunningham.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Hearst’s death? Now, what does Kenny want this time?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Dr. Kent just wants to wrap up some details before we move on to Hearst. He thought that it would be practical if I did in today’s session - I could not complain much, to be honest. For example, Dr. Kent said that it did not make sense that you were around Hearst’s death in 1953, but we discovered you thirty-eight years later in New York.\n\n[SCP-6126 returns its sight to Dr. Cunningham.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** That an easy one - went all the way walking from California to the East Coast. [SCP-6126 cackles.] Nah, but seriously, you expect me to answer those kinds of questions?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Just two questions, so we can move on.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Fine, fine. What does Kenny want me to answer?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You told us that Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. did have a connection with William Randolph Hearst, but do you know exactly how it worked?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Come on, doc. The reason is in plain sight. Knew it way back since Hearst tried to get his hands on the revolution back in Mexico. He had entire control of the newspapers in the palm of his hand back in the day. Not only, but an important thing too: money to waste. Do you think those MC&D would let that slice of the cake just slide? Hell no.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham writes down on his clipboard.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And by any chance do you know if Marshall, Carter, and Dark were involved in your resurrection or any involvement of them in your time with Hearst?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Let me get something clear, doc. All of what I’m telling you is after Hearst died and MC&D picked me up. I can’t really say if there was any involvement of those motherfuckers with me, or if they had to do with my beheading. Now, those are the only two questions Kenny had?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** That is right, I think Dr. Kent will be satisfied with these responses. We can move on with Gadsby. We can start up with a simple question: how would you describe Gadsby?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Considering that Hearst was a greedy bastard, no wonder that Gadsby would also be a greedy bastard. The only difference is that Mr. Gadsby here knew how to smile and say hello, unlike Hearst. He was incredibly interested in the arts, antiquities, and history. He liked to think of himself as a sophisticated person, you know?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham nods.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I would like to point out something in particular: you said that he had an interest in humanity, and I would like to focus on history. I think you can figure out why I chose this one. \n\n**SCP-6126:** I do.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Now, this interest of him. Was this an average fascination for the subject or did you identify something out of place about Gadsby’s interest? And did this interest have any effect on Gadsby’s decision to buy you at the auction?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Doc, think about it for a second. This guy’s spending who knows how many millions to buy not a renowned painting, nor a valuable historical artifact - he’s buying a talking head. And if that wasn’t enough, it’s probably an illegal auction where other rich people buy weird stuff. I don’t think that’s just a simple fascination for history. Money didn’t matter much to him as long as he had his pieces in his collection.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Gadsby had a collection of historical artifacts?\n\n**SCP-6126:** What didn’t he have a collection of? Books, movies, pieces of art, statues, historical artifacts. Both normal and anomalous. He also had a room where he dumped all the stuff that he thought was cheap or he felt dissatisfied with.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I see. I just want to know something real quick, would you by any chance have any information about Gadsby’s interactions with Marshall, Carter, and Dark so we might be able to investigate and discover more information about him?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I’ll have to disappoint you, doc. I got no clue on what you’re asking me, just some small details I could come around. It was hard getting much information from that paranoid old bastard. Motherfucker just wouldn’t let anyone see his collection.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Paranoid? What do you mean by that?\n\n**SCP-6126:** You see, he didn’t like other people looking at his collections - kinda odd if you ask me, being the whole purpose of arts - to the point that he wouldn’t let his staff look around the room, and preferred to keep it all for himself. Imagine being that paranoid, you can’t even trust your own damn servants.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Too bad for him, in the long run, it does not benefit you not trusting the people that work for you. Anyway, it seems that you said enough about Gadsby as a person. Did any relevant event happen while you were under Gadbsy’s ownership?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah, it did. He always brought new artifacts to his collection constantly, and some of them did not meet his standards - whatever those were. Guess where those ended up in?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** The room that you previously mentioned, the one where he moved all the pieces he felt dissatisfied with.\n\n**SCP-6126:** And?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** …And is that where you spent the rest of your time with Gadsby?\n\n**SCP-6126:** That’s right. And before doing that, he gave me a little sermon.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What do you mean by that?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Y’know, he gave a little venting speech to me. He said, that I was a damn shame as a work of art. Said he was expecting something much more mythical, more… legendary because of who I was. That he had high expectations for me.\n\n**SCP-6126:** He vented to me, to put it simply. He said he was exhausted of me… He said that I was annoying, ignorant, and I basically was the complete opposite of what he expected. Said he expected something much more mythical, more… legendary, because of who I was. He said that he never had an opportunity to talk to the dead, and no less a resurrected historical character. \n\n[SCP-6126 falls in silence for a minute.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** …The living head of Pancho Villa - that’s how he described me. He said that I was just another waste of money. He said he sought something old and valuable. But instead, he got nothing but a useless lost piece of the past… He received a fraud.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham drifts his sight from SCP-6126 to an indeterminate point. Dr. Cunningham covers his mouth with his right hand while tapping above his lip.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what happened after that? What were you going through after Gadsby’s vent?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Same thing with Hearst, ignore him. What does he know? Fuck him. He doesn’t know what I’m going through. For me, he could take his little hobby and stick it up to his ass.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** …Could, as in past tense? Did you change your mind about what he said later?\n\n**SCP-6126:** …Kind of. When you are inside a room full of old paintings, the dust and the scent mix with the air, alone, with little to no light, and no one to talk or rant to, you have a lot of time to think. I thought a lot back then.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What did you think of, exactly?\n\n**SCP-6126:** The past - my past, exactly. When you are alone, that’s the only place that you can go to when you’re alone. It really is a feeling, melancholy. You start to go the places that made you proud, in which you were at your prime, but when you return to the present, you remember where you’re currently standing.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So, during most of that time you went back to those memories of yourself and compared to who you currently are?\n\n**SCP-6126:** That’s right.  \n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what did you conclude from your thinking? Did it change from what you previously used to believe?\n\n**SCP-6126:** …I didn’t know. You don’t really have a lot of options to do in that situation, so I was just there, doing nothing. What I used to go through with Hearst only deepened while in that inside Gadsby’s room. I was doing nothing, I was nothing.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And did you try to combat those thoughts like you used to do during your time with Hearst?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Of course I did! What do you expect from me? Like I’ve said, it ain’t easy in that situation. That it works is another thing.\n\n[SCP-6126 falls in silence for a moment.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** You can’t really do much in that situation.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Sadly, it is true. If you do not mind, I want to ask if you could explain the exact circumstances of Gadsby's death. If you do remember, that is.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Damn, how could I not remember that? [SCP-6126 chuckles.] Too bad I couldn’t do it myself, but hey I can’t say I wasn’t expecting it. Anyway, it all started with Gadsby - he started to change. His paranoia went over the top. Gadsby’s servants were only allowed to enter the room I was in, they were the ones who moved and sometimes kept maintenance. Gadsby stopped trusting them and began to do their work instead. [SCP-6126 grins.] Stupid bastard, he didn’t see what was coming.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham furrows his eyebrows.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What is that supposed to mean?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Ya see, he wasn’t in the best shape, y’know? He used to carry around a lot of artifacts with all the weight pushing against him, he also had a bad posture when he tried to lift the objects up. I also managed to hear that he got some serious injuries multiple times from his servants that walked outside the room. He was an idiot, that’s what I meant with what he didn’t see was coming.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Ah, all right. So, all the injuries of Gadsby started to build up and became so big that it just fell apart. Did you manage to see that occasion, or get any information from the servants?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Todo lo que sube, tiene que bajar[[footnote]] What goes up, must come down. [[/footnote]]. All that time he kept on going, being too stubborn to listen to his servant’s advice and not letting them handle their work, he ended up paying for the consequences. I saw him dying right in front of me. He picked up a painting about the size of that door. [SCP-6126 glances at the door of the interview room.] He knew it could be fatal, but he didn’t care. He picked it up, crouching, and just when he was about to get himself straight, crack! Next thing I know, I see his body falling to the floor just above that painting. He was dead when his servants came in, and they took their time to enter. With no key and after a lot of time without him going out of the room, the servants had to kick down the door.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** …And how did you react to Gadsby’s death?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I was glad, but I kinda saw it coming. He just started to act strange, and I knew his back wouldn’t last that long. [SCP-6126 chuckles] Still, can’t say I didn’t want to celebrate - not like I can in the first place, right? [SCP-6126 scoffs.] Nope. It didn’t pass much time before they came for me.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Ah, right. There is still one more person missing related to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., right? I assume it was an auction like last time.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Bingo.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And who was this person?\n\n**SCP-6126:** A guy called Hugo Hudson.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Interview 6126.6\" hide=\" Close Interview 6126.6\"]] \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maxwell Cunningham\n\n**Date:** 07/05/91\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** It is nice to see you again. How have you been doing since last week’s session?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Surprisingly, better. I’ve never experienced something similar like this… it just has this weird effect on you.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Everybody has doubts about therapy, you are not the only one.\n\n**SCP-6126:** I was ignorant about this sort of thing. It’s weird that only with you listening, it feels like I have a weight off my shoulders - even if they’re done with mixed intention if you know what I mean.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham shakes his head in agreement.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I understand. And I am glad that you have seen these sessions helpful - it means they are working. Do you want to know something else? If this one goes as planned, most likely we will not need to talk about any of these people again - unless you need to. \n\n**SCP-6126:** True. But what will happen when we don’t have anything to talk about?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I prefer to tell you at the end of the session - it will be a more pleasant surprise after you go through the rest of the interview.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Ah, I see. Fine by me. So, where do you want to start?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** First, I would ask you to describe what kind of person Hugo Hudson was - as an associate of Marshall, Carter, and Dark, between other people, while with himself. Dr. Kent wished to skip this part because he could more or less predict what kind of person he was comparing with the previous two. But I want to hear from you.\n\n**SCP-6126:** You always know I don’t have anything positive of these people most of the time, y’know? But, he was young compared to the other dinosaurs. I found it strange that someone like him was interested in buying me. And it wasn’t too hard to notice him, either. He was at the front row; compared to someone like Gadbsy who sat down on the sidelines and waited for the perfect opportunity to raise an enormous amount no one else could afford. Nope, not Hudson. The moment that hammer hit, Hudson was the first to raise the pallet.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And did you manage to figure out at that moment why was Hudson so insisting on winning the auction?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Too easy if you ask me: the excitement. Every time someone else raised a certain amount of money, he would double it, triple it, you name it. I figured it out because of the eyes. They never lie, doc. He was looking right at me, all the time. It was a thrill, that one that you don’t know what will happen next but you still wanna know and want to keep going, no matter if what comes next is your doom. And just when no one else was about to fight back when that hammer hit and the organizer yelled “Sold!”, he fell right back on his seat, his eyes now staring at the ceiling. And that’s how I met Hugo Hudson.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So now that Hudson was your new owner and took you, was his residency located near Richmond County?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I don’t got a fucking clue of where is that supposed to be.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** New York City, inside the state of the same name?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Never been to there either, doc. As I said, I ain’t got a clue. But if it helps you, the distance between Hudson’s residency and where the Foundation found me wasn’t that long.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I will leave that to Dr. Kent to deal with it. And what was your experience living with Hudson?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Oh, this guy. Hudson was a thrill-seeker, that’s a fact. He wasn’t the kind of guy who could just sit down and do nothing. This man craved constant excitement in his life. So, he would do parties every day and night, invite as many people as he could, and have his house turned upside down when it had ended - that’s if it happened.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Is there anything else besides that? To me, it does not sound as bad as your previous owners.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Doc, I’m not done yet. Yeah, Hudson wasn’t that bad. Just your average rich dude lifestyle. Now, I want you to imagine the word thrill seeker and try to find all the activities associated with this. If you could, Hudson was that and even went over the top with that word.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Do you have any examples that you might remember right now?\n\n**SCP-6126:** He really liked airplanes, too much for his own good. He had a whole collection of aircraft, yet he had a personal favorite of his. He called it Conqueror, can you believe that? Can’t really blame him, I used to cross out my own colt for every bastard I killed. Anyway, he would go on daily trips with his aircraft, do some crazy stunts in it, loops, spins, rolls. Crazy bastard.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham glances at SCP-6126, furrowing his eyebrows.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I think I will return to one bit of what you just told me in another session. But, returning to Hudson, there is something that I want to ask: how do you know about Hudson’s handling of his aircraft? For a moment I thought he kept you somewhere, like Hearst and Gadsby.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Oh no, that’s the thing: he didn’t give a fuck. Unlike those two, he brought me along. So even if he didn't say anything stupid like the other two, he'd always have me around to experience his daredevil bullshit with him.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I see. And did any incidents happen while you were around with Hudson?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah, a lot of accidents and crashes. For a guy like him, I wasn't surprised that he experienced shit like that before. \"Life is only one, and you either die in a hospital room or crash in the middle of the Pacific; the latter sounds much more exciting\". I remember that’s what he told me. However, the first times I was with him he at least took care of the aircraft. Guess he wasn't much of an idiot, or at least he didn't want to die too early.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** First times, you say? Does that mean that Hudson became more careless as you started to spend more time with him?\n\n**SCP-6126:** That’s right. With time, he began to ignore any issues the aircraft had or take any precautions before flying. He just went along with it.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And were you like, physically present, when all these incidents began to take place?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Almost, if not all ‘em, I was there with him. It happened so often, at one point I began to stop caring if he was risking my life or not. I thought that if by one point it gets really that even Hudson couldn’t control the situation, maybe it ends there. Maybe I would finally die and everything I was going through would just stop.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** … But it did not.\n\n**SCP-6126:** No. It didn’t. And you know… I couldn’t give a fuck about it. Hell, I didn’t realize it until that incident in particular, but even then, what the fuck can you do? I went through a fucking pain that I’m damn sure that in Hell wouldn’t be as horrifying. I mean, what else was I supposed to do? Why the hell did I need to feel so despaired for what I was going through? Why feel that way if I couldn’t do anything, I couldn’t control my situation? So, I started to not give a shit anymore. Let Hudson do his crazy stunts, let him do whatever he wanted, there was no point in fighting back, to begin with. \n\n[Dr. Cunningham remains silent, covering his mouth with his right hand while tapping above his lip.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** …There never was a point in fighting, to begin with.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** …Did by any chance Hudson verbally attack you while you were there with him? Perhaps, it influenced your apathy.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nah, I arrived at it on my own. It was right in front of my nose, but I tried to ignore it as best as I could. There was no escaping, sooner or later it caught me. And even if Hudson did, I can’t remember and most likely it wouldn’t have changed at all. Hudson didn’t do much.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham slightly nods his head.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I want to return to the incident you previously mentioned. I suppose it is the same one that you realized you could not die. How did it go?\n\n[SCP-6126 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nothing out of the ordinary at the start of the day. Hudson, as always, was ready to fly his aircraft and he brought me along. Didn’t even budge against him. Poor aircraft, Hudson wasn’t giving any respect to his supposedly beloved flying machine. So, we hopped right in and took off.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And when did the aircraft start to present any problems during the flight?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I dunno. I couldn’t really tell you, but by the time I noticed we were at a pretty decent height. Then, I heard some weird noise coming from the left wing, I noticed cause I was on that side’s seat. I saw some smoke coming out of the engine. I told Hudson about it.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** He did not notice the smoke coming out of the engine?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Nah. He knew smoke was coming out of it, I just thought he was playing the fool. As I said, he wasn't on the best of his mind, so instead of trying to land in a safe place, he started to do his usual play-around with the airplane. After a few laps, the engine slowly started to stop. And just at it did, we were falling nosedive.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what did you feel when that was going on? What was going through your mind?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I thought I was about to lose my life. I think any sane person was in the situation I was in, they would be afraid in no time. But I didn’t know if I was sane or a person anymore, I just thought this was it. Maybe it was my call. Doc, I know I said that I wanted to die so badly, and I honestly wanted to. I dunno, maybe there was something inside me that didn’t want to go, despite how fucked up I was. Even then, I didn’t try anything to convince Hugo to cut his crap - not like he would listen to me anyway. So, I was just there, waiting when we hit land. I already died once, and if I was lucky enough, I would be dead again. I wouldn’t have to go through some shit like this ever again. [SCP-6126 sighs.] I was pretty fucking wrong.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham remains silent, looking at SCP-6126.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what happened after the airplane crashed?\n\n**SCP-6126:** First, it crashed, obviously. Second, I don’t know the details, just some scenes here and there that I could remember. My mind was spinning and I couldn’t see much. Of what I could, the entire aircraft was destroyed. No more personal flights for Hudson for a while. Then, I managed to see that Hudson flew some miles from his seat, his head hit against a rock or something. I couldn’t concentrate between the impact of the crash and the smoke that was just making it harder to see. Eventually, I closed my eyes. To me, it was all over.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Do you know how long were you unconscious?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I can’t say for sure, but when I woke up I was inside a box and I couldn’t see Hudson anywhere. I was hundred percent sure it was Marshall. Those guys are quick, I’ll give them that much.\n\n[The conversation falls in silence for some minutes.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** …Looks like it’s all you have to say. I will admit, it was not a pleasant story to hear, you went through a lot.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I just want to ask you something else. Your apathy, your wish to be dead, it was not so long ago, was it? It just seems a bit odd your behavior when I compared them to the first interviews you’ve had and your current one.\n\n**SCP-6126:** …It isn’t that bad.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** How come? I thought you did not feel comfortable at the site.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Don’t get me wrong, this place isn’t so different from the previous bastards I used to live with. But you, being here and listening to me, is one of the positive things. [SCP-6126 chuckles.] Hell, I would say the only good thing for me around here.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham chuckles back, scratching his neck.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** It is great to hear that you value my work. Oh, and before I forget, I did tell you there was something at the end, right?\n\n**SCP-6126:** It was at the back of my mind, doc. So, what is it?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I am a containment psychiatrist, so that means that my work is to help my patients in these sessions to improve themselves - along with the cooperation of the patients. Because of all this information you have given me, along with your most recent observations done by yourself, I can say that we can work on how to treat these. What do you think?\n\n**SCP-6126:** What, so you are giving me the full experience?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** That is about it - and I am allowed to do so because Dr. Kent integrated me into the project. It is not so bad, is it?\n\n[SCP-6126 scoffs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** I can’t really trust that guy… but hey, it wouldn’t bother me having company around aside from the research team.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham nods.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I will organize my schedule for next week, most likely it will be the same time as always. So, see you next week?\n\n**SCP-6126:**: Next week as always, doc.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Cunningham was removed from his position as containment psychiatrist for SCP-6126 and was transferred to another project in Site-88.

The report was deemed satisfactory by the higher-ups of the Scientific Department of the facility, and Dr. Kent was congratulated and credited for the work to figure the timeline of events prior to SCP-6126's containment.

Dr. Kent does not respond to SCP-6126’s request. ||\n||= 07/26/91 || SCP-6126 asks for the current state of Dr. Cunningham to Dr. Kent, wondering why its “friend” does not return. Like the last two occasions, Dr. Kent does not answer. ||\n||= 08/30/91 || SCP-6126 turns six months into containment. An on-site therapist performs a monthly psychological evaluation on SCP-6126. Dr. Cunningham offers himself to lead the evaluation, but another candidate is chosen. The containment psychiatrist does not arrive at a certain conclusion due to SCP-6126’s unwillingness to respond. ||\n||= 08/31/91 || Containment specialists perform a daily checkup on SCP-6126’s containment. The containment specialists found the containment locker’s safe open and rifts around SCP-6126’s reinforced glass case. Both its containment safe and reinforced glass case were replaced. The security camera did not find any cause of these containment failures. ||\n||= 09/01/91 || Containment specialists perform another daily checkup on SCP-6126’s containment, and it was found that both the containment locker’s safe and reinforced glass case were broken. The extensive review concludes that a containment specialist was responsible for this, and was reprimanded accordingly. ||\n||= 09/08/91 || The Scientific Department reviews again the report of Dr. Kent on the discovery regarding SCP-6126’s background. It concludes that the report is incomplete; the department demands further research on the subject to Dr. Kent. For the rest of the day, Dr. Kent isolates himself inside his office from his research team and other staff. ||\n||= 09/10/91 || Dr. Kent interviews SCP-6126 to check if he could find any information that SCP-6126 may have ignored. However, Dr. Kent notes that SCP-6126 is unable to articulate complete sentences. Because of this, Dr. Kent frustrates himself and ends the interview abruptly.||\n||= 09/17/91 || Dr. Kent organizes a meeting with his research team for a brainstorming session to find a different way to obtain information regarding SCP-6126. Despite different proposals by several members of the research team, Dr. Kent verbally reprimands them and rants about the uselessness of those particular members of his research team and terminates the meeting shortly after.||\n||= 09/18/91 || The following day, several members of the research team decided to abandon the project and asked for a transfer to others on-site, others reported the comments of Dr. Kent. Dr. Kent was warned about his attitude towards his staff but did not heed the warning so seriously. SCP-6126’s research team remained temporarily short-staffed.||\n||= 10/01/91 || Morale among Dr. Kent’s research team has decreased significantly due to the short amount of members inside the team, the lack of progress in finding any relevant information about SCP-6126, and the constant pressure by the head researcher. ||\n||= 10/02/91 || More members have decided to abandon the project, adding up to the lack of staff in the research team. Dr. Kent asked for new recruits to the Scientific Department to fill out the loss of staff. The request was not entirely completed until some months later due to the readjustment of staff from old projects to SCP-6126. ||\n||= 05/30/01 || SCP-6126 is now a decade in containment and the previous events since 1991 have continued and aggravated, having a severe effect on Dr. Kent. ||\n||= 06/01/01 || A report on the maintenance of Site-88 discovers several failures on the Low-Value Containment of Section-C where several containment locks were malfunctioning. The Assistant Director hypothesizes that this could be responsible because of intentional sabotage among the containment and maintenance staff and enacts an investigation to research on the matter.||\n||= 07/12/01 || SCP-6126 turns a decade without seeing Dr. Cunningham after its last session. Dr. Cunningham proposes to lead a session with SCP-6126 but it is denied. Dr. Kent tries to conduct an interview to check on SCP-6126 but does not manage to convey with it because of the anomaly’s apparent inability to speak and notices constant repetitive facial movements. After some examination, doctors conclude that SCP-6126 entered a catatonic state, possibly because of SCP-6126’s lack of interaction with personnel and the design of SCP-6126’s special containment procedures. Despite different objections by some members of Dr. Kent’s team to revise SCP-6126’s containment procedures, the topic did not reach far.||\n||= 08/12/01 || Following the report of the state of SCP-6126, the Ethics Committee intervenes. However, no changes were done to SCP-6126, and instead, it has been decided to cut funding. After hearing this news, Dr. Kent isolates himself in his office for the rest of the day.||\n||= 09/01/01||\tAfter ten years of severe relationships between the Foundation and Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., representatives of the latter agree on cooperating with the Foundation with any projects regarding anomalies between the two groups.||\n||= 09/02/01||\tMembers of the research team update Dr. Kent on the news, stating that the project finally had a new opportunity to obtain the information the research team needs to fulfill the Scientific Department’s demands. Dr. Kent rejects the idea and lashes out against the members who proposed the idea. When the same members ask for a reason, Dr. Kent argues that if he alone found the first information of the anomaly by himself, he could do it again and without the need for any outside help.||\n||= 09/03/01||\tThe members who proposed the idea to Dr. Kent decided to leave the project, leaving it short-staffed.||\n||= 05/30/10||\tSCP-6126 turns nineteen years in containment. The research team in charge of SCP-6126 does not yet fulfill the Scientific Department’s demands. SCP-6126 has not recovered from its catatonic state despite intervention by the Medical Department.||\n||= 05/31/10|| Containment specialists perform a daily checkup on SCP-6126’s containment, discovering a rust containment locker, as well as some other lockers near SCP-6126. Other containment specialists found the security camera malfunctioning and those of Section-B also found breakdowns in containment. Containment specialists inform Dr. Kent about the situation, but Dr. Kent does not show any concern and states that it is not a problem of his.||\n||= 07/12/10 || SCP-6126 turns nineteen years without seeing Dr. Cunningham after its last session. During that time Dr. Cunningham raises concerns about the rumors he hears about the state of SCP-6126 in his new position as a member of the Medical Department and the management of the project. However, decides not to involve himself because of the constant denials by his superiors and Dr. Kent in particular.||\n||= 09/18/10 || Dr. Kent writes a request to the Scientific Department in which he request a raise in funding and a re-supply of staff, stating that he discovered a way to satisfy the demands of the department. In it, Dr. Kent explains a possible connection between a secret society by the name of Skull and Bones and the presence of a mentioned Emil Holmdahl in the state where SCP-6126 was murdered at the time of its death. Dr. Kent declares that he could finally resolve the missing background information of SCP-6126.||\n||= 09/19/10 || The Scientific Department approves the request of Dr. Kent on the condition that the results of his investigation that Dr. Kent must constantly report at the end of each month in the term of six months since the approval of the request. Failure to do so results in the demotion of Dr. Kent’s leadership on the project as well as a trial on Dr. Kent to determine other possible charges on his position as Head Researcher.||\n||= 09/20/10 || Dr. Kent begins his research, and projects explorations to several states in the Northeast, Southwest, California, and Chihuahua (Mexico) to obtain information on the location and the exact route that capturers of SCP-6126 took since the beheading of SCP-6126.||\n||= 09/21/10 || Dr. Kent arrives in Parral, Chihuahua, undercover as a historian along with some members of his research team. Dr. Kent starts at the grave where 6126’s decapitation happened and researches around the town to find any clues regarding the beheading. Next, he moves from Parral to Ciudad Juarez where supposedly Holmdahl crossed to El Paso, Texas. According to the research team, little substantial information is found. As protocol, Dr. Kent administers amnestics to avoid any information leaking to the public.||\n||= 09/23/10 || Dr. Kent previously arranges a meeting to speak with a representative of Skull and Bones and arrives at the headquarters of Yale University. The representative denies any rumors that the society possesses, or once did, an artifact similar to SCP-6126. As protocol, Dr. Kent administers amnestics to avoid any information leaking to the public.||\n||= 09/25/10 || Dr. Kent’s last day of his exploration consists in searching the residences and interviews of several descendants of William R. Hearst about any information they might know about SCP-6126. As protocol, Dr. Kent administers amnestics to avoid any information leaking to the public.||\n||= 09/31/10 || Dr. Kent and his research team return to Site-88 to analyze the information from their research. The Scientific Department asks for any possible hypotheses from Dr. Kent and his research team, but Dr. Kent does not respond and orders the rest of his team to not do so as well.||\n||= 10/31/10 || The Scientific Department asks again for any updates to Dr. Kent, but no updates were given. In fact, many members report that they are not allowed to participate or help Dr. Kent in any way by orders of the Head Researcher. Funding or staff was not cut this time because of the conditions at the request of Dr. Kent. This pattern continues for the following months until the deadline imposed by the Scientific Department.||\n||= 02/19/11 || Dr. Kent presents his report to the Scientific Department. In it, the report includes a timeline from the beheading of SCP-6126 until the anomaly’s containment in 1991. The report states that Swedish-American Emil Holmdahl was secretly a member of Skull and Bones society, and this member was working for William Randolph Hearst. Holmdahl decapitates SCP-6126 and crosses the border to El Paso, Holmdahl then transfers to Connecticut and gives the head to the representative of Hearst. But, before SCP-6126 is sent to Hearst, the members of Skull and Bones perform a ritual on SCP-6126 to revive it. The rest of the report includes the information from the interviews between SCP-6126 and Dr. Cunningham. The report is put on hold to confirm the results from Dr. Kent.||\n||= 02/21/11 || The Scientific Department rejects the report, arguing that Dr. Kent’s are founded on loose connections and observations. On it, it addresses how there is no evidence to substantiate the following: that Skull and Bones had ties to William R. Hearst or any other anomalous organization, that Emil Holmdahl had any connections to Skull and Bones or William R. Hearst, among other inconsistencies. An email is sent this same day in which it informs Dr. Kent that he is demoted and the appropriate process would follow the next day. Dr. Kent spends the rest of the day isolated in his office.||\n||= 02/22/11|| The guards in charge of Dr. Kent’s escort arrive at his office. They knock on the door a few times, waiting for a response from Dr. Kent but he does not respond. They try to unlock the door, only to be stuck from the inside. The guards begin to push the door and after some minutes the door opens. The guards found a chair blocking the office’s door handle and the body of Dr. Kent sitting in his chair giving his back to the office’s door. The guards find a small jar in Dr. Kent’s hand that is later identified as potassium cyanide, as well as a note in which it says: //Fucking head, I should’ve found out earlier.//||\n||= 02/23/11|| Containment specialists perform a checkup of SCP-6126’s containment. The containment specialists later state that SCP-6126 asks them if Dr. Kent is really dead. SCP-6126 is temporarily transferred to another room for interrogation but SCP-6126 states that it will not answer any questions unless it sees Dr. Cunningham.||\n\n**Addendum 6126.3:** Interview and Special Containment Procedures Update\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6126\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maxwell Cunningham\n\n**Date:** 02/23/11\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** ...Do you know how much time has passed since we had our last session or an idea of how much you spent in that state?\n\n**SCP-6126:** You tell me, you’re the one who has a calendar on your locker. Too much, that’s all I can say.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Twenty years. In two months, twenty years would have passed since the last time I saw you. I say would, because we are face to face right now. I have to say, this is not how I expected it to be, or that it would happen at all.\n\n[SCP-6126 laughs.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What’s so funny?\n\n**SCP-6126:** You look old! Damn, I can’t really say I don’t believe you by how you look - time sure does fly when you’re stuck inside a locker. But hey, it doesn’t hurt to see an old friend after twenty years, amirite?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Are you being serious? I’m seeing you after twenty years! I should be relieved that I can finally talk to you again, and it’s not even on any good terms. What went through your mind when you demanded my superiors for me?\n\n**SCP-6126:** To catch up with an old friend, that’s all. If you think about it, it’s a win-win: I get to talk to you and they get their answers. Sweet deal, right?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham scratches his hair, he sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** It’s amusing that you’re still alive. I’m not saying that I didn’t want to see you but… with all that has happened around the site, I don’t have a good feeling about this.\n\n**SCP-6126:** I don’t blame ya.\n\n[The conversation falls in silence for a moment.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** We already know why we are here for. I’ll have to follow protocol as before - my superiors don’t like unprofessionalism, like what’s happening at the moment. Is that fine with you?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yes! Oh, shit, please! It’s been two decades since our last session, I thought I was about to go crazy.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham clears his throat.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** How did you discover that Dr. Kent died?\n\n**SCP-6126:** It isn’t so hard to figure it out if the same people that check your locker daily chat about poor Kenny killing himself with cyanide. I just asked them the moment they opened the door. [SCP-6126 scoffs.] Fuckers almost shitted their pants when they discover that the supposedly catatonic head started to speak again after years.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So you are admitting that you faked your catatonic state during your time under containment?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yep. To be honest, I’m impressed. I never expected that I could go that far, I thought that with all the smart people there were around the site, I wouldn’t do it. Lucky me, I guess.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Why? Why did you avoid any human interaction with other personnel and risk your well-being? What were you trying to achieve?\n\n[SCP-6126 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** You really don’t understand, do ya?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** How am I supposed to understand if you do not elaborate?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Max, do you really believe that these people care about my well-being? I’m stuck inside a glass case, and to top it all off, kept inside a locker. Do you think I have an option here? Who was I supposed to go with? Dr. Kent? The research team? The only thing those motherfuckers cared for was doing their damn job, and they only came for me when they needed something from me. I could only do this: do nothing. Fuck ‘em. I might as well make their life harder than it already was.\n\n[The conversation falls in silence for a moment.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You could have hurt yourself - you could have died. It is our job to protect anoma- people like you. The glass from your reinforced glass case broke a few times, and your security was constantly hijacked by containment specialists. If we weren’t there, where could you be?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Doc, were you there? I remember our last session being twenty years ago, and the worst part never touched you - never involved you. I didn’t get hurt because I can’t - a gift for being an anomaly as your colleagues call me. Besides, I never got hurt, others did - and that’s because of me.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What is that supposed to mean?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Don’t you think it’s so convenient that three months after I’m contained, my locker doesn’t work, my glass case just randomly has cracks, and a few years Dr. Kent just starts to lose his shit? I caused it, Max. I’m the one to be blamed for all the problems that have occurred - and will still occur - around the site.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** ...How is that even possible?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Call it however your organization wants to call it, I just say they’re powers. I don’t know how to describe it exactly, but I can manipulate the lives of the people who own me. From their actions all the way to how they will die. That’s how I understand it. In plain sight, it might look like the person who died just had it rough, took some poor decisions in life and those led it to death.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham’s voice starts to tremble.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** If what you are telling me is real, does that mean… that you killed Dr. Kent?\n\n[SCP-6126 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yes, doc. That was me, I killed him. He wasn’t the only victim: Hearst, Gadsby, Hudson, maybe even other people associated with them.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Something does not make sense to me. You can control the lives of the people who own you, and it means you can do it whenever you like. Why take twenty years to kill Dr. Kent? Did you find it… enjoyable to make him suffer?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Ah, that. Forgot about that detail for a second. No, it doesn’t work that way. Think of me as the root cause. Someone owns me, right? The events begin to manifest and those just take their own path, they take their precious and valuable time to develop until the final result kicks in. If I could do it fast, I would do it.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You still need to answer the last question: did you enjoy making Dr. Kent suffer?\n\n[SCP-6126 does not respond.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Answer me.\n\n[SCP-6126 still does not respond.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You owe me. You made me believe that you were not able to talk again, you owe me an answer, and many more.\n\n**SCP-6126:** ...We both owe something to each other. Doc, if I answer everything you ask me, will you promise me something I ask?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** That would depend-\n\n**SCP-6126:** Yes or no, doc. I ain’t telling you nothing if then.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** ...Okay, sure. I promise. \n\n**SCP-6126:** Revenge is a dish best served cold, some people say. Guess it has followed through all my life. I thought that I wouldn’t need to search for a vendetta when I finally met you. Guess what happened? Our pal Kenny had to come and fuck it all up because he had to get a job done. It’s not about the enjoyment of suffering, it’s the payback of making me suffer.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Payback for what, exactly?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I seriously hate that you need to ask for every single detail because your superiors tell you to.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I ask you because I want to listen to it coming out from your mouth. Now, why exactly were looking for revenge against Dr. Kent?\n\n**SCP-6126:** For taking away what I valued the most at the time, and, if I could, take it back. I’m gonna cut you some slack and tell you: you, Max. Ever since I met him, Kent could go fuck himself. I didn’t like him. I wasn’t going to tell him anything, why even bother? I did this in the past, what difference is it one more person? ...And then you arrived.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What was so special about me according to you?\n\n**SCP-6126:** At the start, nothing. I thought you were just about the same as Kent. But then, despite knowing the intentions of Kenny, you insisted on helping me in a way that was actually beneficial to me. And, it worked. It was helpful and I enjoyed it. When our last session hit, I actually considered telling you the following week, about my hidden powers. I didn’t want you to die, you know?\n\n[Dr. Cunningham scratches the back of his head.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** ...But it never came. When I saw Dr. Kent, I asked where the fuck were you. He didn’t answer shit. Next week, it was my second try. I insisted, thinking that you wouldn’t just leave me, but in the back of my head, there was doubt. I wouldn’t just give up on it, so I tried. Kent ignored me, as he always did. Third week, I was just… beaten. Two weeks without interacting with someone you actually hope to really doesn’t help. I was basically pleading to Kent to just see you, even if it was one last time. And he walked away. I understood then, that you wouldn’t return and it was all because of Kent’s fault.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Look, I do not want to justify myself for something I am not responsible for. I just… couldn’t do-\n\n**SCP-6126:** Shut up. Just... let me finish. Kent took you out of the project, he took you away from me. All because he wanted to keep his successful record and didn’t care if you or me were doing well. Do you know where I was left after that? Alone, inside my locker. I didn’t get any light unless the containment staff came in to check, and I would be alone in the dark again when everything worked for them. I had… a lot of time to think.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** And what were you thinking during that time?\n\n**SCP-6126:** If Dr. Kent could get what he wanted by destroying the life of someone, what stopped me from destroying Kent’s life from getting what I want? So, I decided to spend the rest of my time on one goal: seeing you again. I directed all my anger to my patience and waited for the effects to take action. Of course, I thought that sooner or later Kent or someone else might raise suspicions, so I came with the idea that I fell catatonic. Who would raise suspicions of a talking head that falls catatonic and can’t do anything? So, I made it look like I was falling ill little by little, eventually falling catatonic. The best thing of all? It worked.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham looks at SCP-6126.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** May I ask you something?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I think that’s the point of this interview, so yeah.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Why are you… so attached to me? I do understand that you felt better back in those sessions, but twenty years later, you still are. Not only that, you caused all this damage for me. Why?\n\n**SCP-6126:** ...Do you remember when I told you I wish I could be dead? That I didn’t want to suffer anymore? Back then, I didn’t have anything or anyone. I didn’t care. I thought it would be the same here. That was until you came here, and with time I didn’t feel like shit anymore. Each week, even if I didn’t show it, I was waiting to talk to you. And when I couldn’t anymore, the only thing that made me wait for the following week was gone. And the only thing I had to strive for was getting you back.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham sobs.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I worked for the Containment Psychiatry Division back then. Now, I work for the Medical Department--\n\n**SCP-6126:** Congrats.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Thank you. I did not have a lot of power back then, nor now. My superiors would just appoint me to any clients, tell me to comfort them, and provide any medicine for them to just stop being a bother. I tried to do the best I could with them, actually help them - but for a reason or another, I would lose them. In the end, helping people was all that mattered to me - but I would end up losing more than just clients. Now, I work for the Medical Department. It has been a journey, times have changed, the Foundation is taking these topics into consideration. We can help you.\n\n[SCP-6126 sobs.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Thanks.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I do not want you to ignore the consequences you have caused, however. You have done a lot of harm these past twenty years, and you have what you wanted right in front of you. What do you think will happen now?\n\n**SCP-6126:** I don’t know, and I don’t give a shit!\n\n[SCP-6126 begins to tear up.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Whatever comes, whatever needs to happen, let it come. I just don’t want to be alone when it comes, I don’t want to feel like I did inside that dark cage I had to live in for twenty goddamn years. I just… I just want you to be there, okay? That’s the only thing I can ask for…\n\n[SCP-6126 starts to cry.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You won’t have to.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Eh?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I promise you, you won’t have to go through. I promise that I’ll try as hard as I can to the Containment Committee for them to take what you’ve told me into consideration. They can’t say no to this.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham touches the back of SCP-6126’s glass case, bowing his head a little.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You just need to hang in there, just a bit more. Can you promise me that?\n\n**SCP-6126:** G-Go ahead, I’m fine with it.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham shakes his head in agreement, taping the glass case before returning to his seat. Dr. Cunningham grabs his pocket watch, looking at the time. He sighs.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I have to get going. I’ll be back this time, I promise.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham starts to pack his stuff.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Wait. Wait, wait, //wait//. Don't do it, forget everything about what I said. \n\n[Dr. Cunningham stops.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What? You don't want any help at the end of the day?\n\n**SCP-6126:** You really want to //die//? If you stay with me, if you start to be part of the project again and stay for too long, you'll die like Kent, like Hearst, like everyone else that has died because of me. There's only one person in this room I care for, and I don't want him to die in just a couple of years.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham looks to an indeterminate point.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** You deaf or something, now?! You'll die, Max. Do something else, focus on other stuff, go with your family, goddamnit. Start something new, I dunno. Just go.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham stares at SCP-6126.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Don't you want to start something new as well?\n\n**SCP-6126:** What?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** You don't really have somewhere else to go, don't you?  I won't elaborate much of what has happened to me when we didn't see each other in those years, but as I've said, I've lost much a lot during that time and [[[a-husband-s-absence|especially recently]]]. You took a lot from other people, and a lot are tired of dealing with the mess you've done.\n\n[SCP-6126 remains silent.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** So, I get to start a new life, and you too. You don't need to end alone and helpless just because you think you can kill me. Heh, how much time do you think I have, especially in this line of work?\n\n{SCP-6126 chuckles.]\n\n**SCP-6126:** Next to none, I guess.\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Right? So, why worry about my death? And if I get to be what I couldn't be, I would accept my death no matter what.\n\n[SCP-6126 remains silent.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** I think it's about time that I leave, I've already crossed a line in here. Let's see what comes after this.\n\n**SCP-6126:** Before you leave, can I ask for one more thing?\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** What do you need?\n\n**SCP-6126:** Can you call me by my name? In the past few years, I've only heard, SCP this, 6126 that. I just want to hear my real name, I want to be called for who I am.\n\n[Dr. Cunningham remains silent for a moment.]\n\n**Dr. Cunningham:** Of course, Pancho. I will see you soon, I promise.\n\n**<End Log>**\n------\n[[/div]]\nThe information provided by SCP-6126 was announced to personnel involved and non-involved with SCP-6126 around the site. Reaction against maintaining SCP-6126 in Site-88 spread across the site. After several weeks, the Containment Committee decided to transfer SCP-6126 from Site-88 to Site-17 along with other updates to its containment. These updates include the shared containment of SCP-6126 between several Groups of Interest to avoid the effects of SCP-6126 manifesting. On 05/30/2011, SCP-6126's updated special containment procedures were enacted.
