Their current population is 68 and they occupy a small, remote area near Site-53. As these entities have only been found in the desert, they have been seen using a variety of native elements such as sand, gravel, clay, flora, and fauna.

I was able to find an area with 15 entities each appearing to be juveniles. They are engaging in simplistic behaviors such as meandering through the desert or manipulating the desert's surface to form illustrations. While these are rudimentary in terms of their full capabilities, they still express an intuitive understanding of complex geometry.\n\nBefore me are fractal patterns extending for dozens of meters, diagrams of celestial movements, and I believe one of them took note of me as it seems to be re-creating my face in the dirt.\n\n----\n\n= **29 JUL 2019**\n\nThey do not rest nor do they appear to require sustenance. Each moment is spent seeking out things to create. I've found scores of various things that they've made, but unfortunately the small or superficial ones are prone to degradation so we may never know how much they have created. The ones that do remain are beautiful.\n\nI may not be an artist, but I can appreciate the craft.\n\nThere are almost 40 of the entities here. From my vantage point along this bluff, there is a field of objects that they've made: vehicles, animals, cacti, towers of intricate and interwoven spirals at least 30 meters tall. Some complete and many in progress.\n\nThe young are scurrying about the objects finding materials to add to their own. A branch, a stone, pieces of dilapidated creations -- all repurposed into something new, something of their own. \n\nI've seen a few of the entities who have examined each other's portfolio of sophisticated re-creations. Some simply return back to their own areas, while others pair up and then withdraw from this area together.\n----\n\n= **03 AUG 2019**\n\nThere are few elder entities in this area. Exploring on foot makes finding them harder as they seek isolated locations in the desert to work on massive collaborative projects. I've seen them in the process of building up mountains, excavating canyons, expanding rivers, and boring out cave systems. Their choices and placement of building materials seem to indicate a desire for these to appear as though they were natural, that they belong.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=Wide%20Canyon.jpg |\ncaption=Two mature SCP-7466.

I'll bring it back to the site in the next few days.\n\nI've taken a particular interest in a pair of the beings. I've stayed with them exclusively for the past three weeks. They were near death. I assumed as much due to their decreased activity and radiance. \n\nTheir deaths were like that of a star: they collided and then collapsed upon themselves. They then exploded scattering throughout the region. Each stone, each grain of sand, everything that they've touched was riddled with the remains of its designer. \n\nThat was three days ago.\n\nToday everything that was imbued with those remnants began to shimmer in a vibrant white. These particles began to coalesce into a myriad of shapes upon the earth. The shapes then merged along captivating spirals to a few separate spaces. As each shape formed their final arrangements, they lifted from the soil.\n\nEach one a new entity. Three of them scurrying about newly formed and eager to carry on their progenitor's legacy.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ Addendum 7466.2: Recovered Journal\n[[/=]]\n----\n@@ @@\nDuring the later portion of Dr. David Carlyle's expedition, he made camp at a dilapidated structure that appeared to be a residence at one point.

Next to the grave was a decayed corpse with what appeared to be self-inflicted injuries to its arms.\n\nPhotos below show the building's interior and the grave site.\n\nDr. Carlyle recovered a journal from this building and digitized the last entry:\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid #CDCDD1; margin: 1em; padding: 1em;\"]]\n\nThese years at your side have been the greatest of my life.
