It automatically becomes aware whenever someone refers to it in any written form, as no anomalous properties are triggered by any spoken or mental mention of it, nor can it affect any images relating to it.\n\nSCP-8929 can write at 2.5 times the speed that humans are capable of and in various languages including English, Spanish and French. Any alteration by SCP-8929, also known as SCP-8929-1, onto a document is unable to be changed or removed. While SCP-8929-1 instances cannot be altered directly, it is possible to make additions to them, as can be seen with Junior Researcher Alex Roberts’s footnotes in IRR-AAA-SCP-8929-A and IRR-AAA-SCP-8929-B.[[footnote]]IRR-AAA stands for “Irrelevant Anomalously Altered Article.”[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-8929 cannot turn a document into a SCP-8929-1 instance if it is being observed. While this phenomenon is not fully understood as of the time of writing, it appears that any observation acts as a limiter of SCP-8929. However, this is only possible if a human is watching, as all attempts to use live video feed have failed as previous tests have shown. When questioned, SCP-8929 claimed confusion and appeared unaware of this limitation on its anomalous capabilities.\n\nIn addition to being able to rewrite any information about itself, SCP-8929 is also able to communicate to personnel through any document that makes any reference towards it, whether that be a physical or digital document. Because of this, SCP-8929 has requested a page where Foundation personnel can ask it questions. This request is currently pending.\n\nOnce in containment, SCP-8929 was assigned to Junior Researcher Alex Roberts as his first SCP since joining the site; however, as SCP-8929 has stated directly, it then proceeded to rewrite various previous articles written by Alex Roberts, which can be read above. After an attempt at contact, SCP-8929 and Alex Roberts came to a mutual conclusion and Roberts was allowed to write the true SCP-8929 article. Shortly after finishing the page, Roberts submitted a request to Site Director Sarah Young to implement SCP-8929 to the  [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/integration-program-hub|Integration Program.]]][[footnote]]Previously known as the Appeasement Program.[[/footnote]]\n\nAfter some internal review between Head Researcher Maddison Yu and Site Director Sarah Young, the request was moved up to the Ethics Committee for further debate and review.\n\nAs of 10/04/25, SCP-8929 has been implemented and is the newest member of the Integration Program, working as a pending researcher in the Anomalous Artifact Discovery department of Site-632.\n\n[[div class=\"skip_box terminal\" data-title=\"Addendum 8929.4: Contact between Junior Researcher Alex Roberts and SCP-8929 on 10/05/25\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em;\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n[[div_ class=\"overlayback\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n> ----\n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: LET'S FUCKING GO!!
