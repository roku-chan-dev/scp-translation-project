Fiancé and father asked to wait outside. Baptismal purification unsuccessful. Last Rites administered to mother and fetus via 50ml chrism and 5g pentobarbital. \n\n**Note:** \n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color:#F6EFE4; border: solid 2px #000;\"]]\nThe Lord weeps on this day. Our sanctum brought forth a perversion many years ago, a child borne of demonic seed, and some among you gave false witness so that she could go free.\n\nWhy?\n\n...\n\nI understand. \n\nThe memories we extracted lacked //useful// intel, but nevertheless some of you may feel they speak volumes about the enemy. Did she not cry like a human? Did she not laugh like a human? Did she not //love// like a human?\n\nIt //appears// that she did...\n\nBut our Lord says in second corinthians \"And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.\" He //knew// that we could be outwitted by these fallen angels! And in his infinite wisdom God gave us sacred scripture to protect us from their lies. \n\nDemons are not misunderstood. They are not //just like us.// They are corrupted, soulless, evil beings; and every ear you lend to them brings you one step further from God and closer to damnation!\n\n...\n\nSome among you made a mistake back then. It is understandable; we all stumble from time to time. But our God is forgiving! And the work we have done today, while... //distasteful//, has finally made amends for our past sins.\n\nRejoice! We have delivered two corrupted souls from their perdition, and into the loving hands of our heavenly father.\n\nDeus Vult!\n\n- Fr. Archibald, Head Templar for the Twelfth Sanctum\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n _\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** lizzie.jpg\n> **Name:** Elizabeth\n> **Author:** Julio Romero\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://flic.kr/p/Ge6rJQ Flickr]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
