From what I can tell it was deleted on 85+ which would make it officially the best thing I ever wrote. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bennings/comments/1cg2mck/scp_and_then_there_were_none/? And Then There Were None]: a crossover with, uh, And Then There Were None. Not sure what this one was at when they deleted it. \n\n**Pretentious Reading List™**\n\nAnyway, I haven't used this page for years and I presume literally nobody has ever looked at it, so I'm going to post a big list of recommended reading here. Is there any kind of consistent theme or quality? No! Does the list include stuff that objectively has zero literary value like Halo or Warhammer novels? Yes! Is it very inconsistent on whether or not novellas are included? Also yes!\n\nLet's face it, the only two things I wrote that people even halfway liked got deleted with the crossover purge, so this is pretty much the best I can offer. \n\nThe more pluses, the higher the recommendation. \n\nAnd I've decided I have to be socially conscious here. I don't want anyone giving money to an author who is a piece of shit. I've removed a lot of names from this list, mostly for either supporting Israel or supporting J K Rowling. Dead authors aren't counted, as the main purpose is to stop economically supporting these people rather than a blanket refusal to engage with their work. \n\n**Literary**\n\nThings Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe (+)🇳🇬\n\nThe Lessons by Naomi Alderman (+)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿✡\n\nThe Argonautica by Apollonius of Rhodes (+)🇬🇷\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342 Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen] (+) 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\nThe Wasp Factory by Iain Banks (+)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿\n\nThe Unnameable by Samuel Beckett (+) 🇮🇪\n\nSelected Poems of William Blake by William Blake (+)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\nThe Aleph and The Maker by Jorge Luis Borges (+++)🇦🇷\n\nFicciones by Jorge Luis Borges (+++)🇦🇷\n\nThe Book of Sand and Shakespeare's Memory by Jorge Luis Borges (+++)🇦🇷\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260 Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte] (+)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/768 Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte] (+++)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\nInvisible Cities by Italo Calvino (+)🇮🇹\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46 A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens] (++)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98 A Tale of Two Cites by Charles Dickens] (++)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\nHeart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad (+)🇵🇱\n\nRoom by Emma Donohue (+++)🇨🇮\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/550 Silas Marner, Weaver of Raveloe by George Eliot] (+)🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317 The Great Gatsby by F.
