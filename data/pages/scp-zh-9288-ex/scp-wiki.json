Site-7 formed an investigative team, with Rurik assigned as the lead, totalling seven people to investigate. It was noted for them to not disturb the masses, as the crowds have became the most unstable in these times of unrest. Just like an agent having received the role of a leader for the first time, Agent Rurik is uncertain of what he will be facing, but he makes preparations regardless, and leaves the biggest station in Moscow at 1:00 in the evening, to drive towards Yaroslavl Station.\n> \n> The wireless intercoms were not good at the time, but he still ordered for correspondence to be done at a pace of five minutes each, reporting his location to him. He responded with small talk, the contents of which were insignificant, as we only needed to note that it was about the station and that the train was unanomalous in terms of appearance; This sleeper wagon had its compartments each marked with the starting and terminating stations. Passengers lined up neatly to get their ticket checked and boarded the train.\n> \n> They requested for Site Command to provide detailed descriptions of the anomalous object at the time, but Site-7 expressed difficulty in narrowing down a description, as it was different for each source, with the only common factor being that this train which will be leaving at 2:15 is going to encounter an anomalous phenomenon. Agent Rurik expressed dissatisfaction but promptly acted, with the team putting on as regular visitors and boarded the train.\n> \n> The last communications received by the site was an audio message from the telegraph operator Vyacheslav, what followed was two days and 15 hours of silence, which may seem unimaginable by modern standards, but for the situation at hand it was fairly likely; A running train cannot send signal well. When communications returned, it was already the evening after two days have passed, when communications with the headquarters suddenly came on-line. The investigative team were without a hitch, everyone got off the train safely in Tyumen, and the train continued its course.\n> \n> When inquired of whether anything was unusual, they all responded: Nothing out of the ordinary\n> \n@@ @@\n\nPulling my trenchcoat straight, with a cigar in my mouth, I wandered towards the Terminal 1 through packed rows of wandering people. The passengers would be bringing their luggage passing through the platform, some people even had mud stuck on their faces, rushing to give their farewells, as a Russian it is a scene which is often seen, even through the commute after work each day. But to say what really triggers our memories of the stations, it would be: the Voices.\n\nA voice broadcasts from the speakers of the platform, as the announcer reads out the code of the train and the platform it boards with a low voice.\n\n\"Please don't walk on the rails.\" The announcements always bring up this advice, but why are the rails specifically mentioned? Even though it is stated, there are always those few who willfully let their life shatter as a fleeting spark, the line that I don't understand, and yet the sensation of comfort which I am simultaneously enjoying, the voice and feeling that could be compared to... To be honest, I still cannot find the appropriate comparison to make.\n\n> //(Suddenly noise ringed in through my earpiece)//\n> Attention Agent Ivan, your mission is about to...\n\nWithout even listening to what was said, I raised my head to look at the sky. The clouds with a shade that hinted at rain drawing near, but the big droplets are still condensed on the clouds in place, waiting to fall in coordinated motion along with when the train leaves the station. When was the last time we had to go on mission with such bad weather?\n\nIt should have been 11/21, a day also with heavy snow, deeply memorable; It was the first time I worked with MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-9 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Chaos[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯混亂[[/span]][[/span]]\") on a mission. That time we lost five colleagues.\n\nBut I can't recall the details: What was done, what I felt, the expressions on my teammates' faces. After all, we should move on, we have to move on.\n\n> Target locked on, please enter the carriage\n\nThe announcement on the platform is no longer loud enough to submerge me from hearing from my earpiece, this makes me uneasy, and feeling unease before a mission is not a good omen. The other team members have made their way to their respective train windows, ready to get their tickets checked.\n\n\"Fruitless, we didn't get the deer.\"[[footnote]]An idiom for Russians, blessing people for good luck and success, usually used in exams or missions. **TL Note:** In the original note in Chinese, it uses an idiom in Chinese where horse is depicted instead (馬 \"horse\" 到 \"arrive\" 成功 \"success\").[[/footnote]] I spoke in a low voice, hoping that I don't cover over the voice of the announcement, the entire team is Russian and I'm certain they would rather listen to the broadcast and not my voice.\n\n\"Thanks leader, [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-H is entering the carriage.\" As the last teammate's voice comes through the headpiece, I took out my passport and train ticket from my pocket at last, pulled my hat straight, tidied up my clothes and tie, wore a confident smile that is a must for any successful businessmen.\n\nAnd I passed the salmon-colored ticket and passport to the train conductor.\n\n\"First time on the big railways?\" The conductor checked the passport and ticket, and his voice which resembled the sound from the speakers flowed from his thin lips, but this is a question that will only ever get vague answers; Why would he ask, does the question come from his heart or is it just a requirement imposed by his work?\n\n\"The second time, perhaps.\" I said, turning to face the other platforms.\n\nDevoid of all people, this would be the last train for the day.\n\n\"Reasonable response, as said by most. The first time leaves an impression, and the times after that no one minds which time it's been.\" He returns the ticket and passport: \"Welcome to the last train for the day, have a good journey, agent.\"\n\n@@ @@\n------\n+ Essay \"Differences in Memory and Recollection: On whether Recollections are hindering the progression of human societies\" Excerpt\n\n> Before elaborating on this topic, we have to first understand the differences between recollection and memory, before we have the nomenclature to discuss whether recollections are hindering the progression of human societies.\n> Our memory on past experiences and events are categorized as \"episodic memory\"[((bibcite 1))]. Memory is the brain accumulating knowledge gathered by experiencing events or other stimulation, it is the basis for processing thoughts, imaginations and advanced mental activity. The memory of a person is regulated by chemical changes in the Hippocampus, a part of the brain. As a normal part of the mental process, the memory is tightly relevant to all other mental activity. With regards to research on memory, we cover it under the fields of psychology and neurology.[((bibcite 2))] Modern humans still do not have thorough research on the true nature of memory.\n> \n> And recalling is a component of memory, as a mechanic of reliving through experiences belonging to us, as a process of recovering our past experiences, as the third mechanic in memory (memorization, preservation, recalling). Recalling is our reconstruction of a certain segment of memory, and this process will be affected by many factors, such as personal awareness, imagination, taught descriptions of the outside world's objective facts, faith, social factors and the likes. This process is referred to as \"reconstructive memory\".[((bibcite 3))]\n> \n> As recollections of memory are not factual, so it is when we treat our recollections as truthful events, when we are exactly the weakest, with every detail being a potential vulnerability where we can be wrong.\n> \n> As the author, on the case of whether memory is hindering the progression of human societies, an opinion is given by the author: Indeed, memory affects the positive progression of societies. This is because memory causes people to perceive their impressions of the world as the true world, it creates conflict between different people on the light end, and it creates global arguments between countries on the heavy end. Switching from the macro scale to the micro, when someone repeatedly gets trapped in memories of some events, it can become fatal. [((bibcite 4))]\n> People who are living in the past will not improve, they live in their fantasy and will not confront the facts, relying on the signals emitted through the chemical processes in their own brains to make them feel better. Recollection is an extremely common way to escape from facts. Based on conclusions from previous research, many people prefer to be blinded by the positive and fictional recollections from the truth. [((bibcite 5))]\n> The author will use scientific reasoning to discuss the differences in memory and recollection, as well as the structural differences in the region responsible for memory between the past and modern humans, to conclude...\n\n[[bibliography]] \n: 1 : Burgess, P.W., and Shallice, T.

It is also difficult to cover it up from the general public. Currently, the Foundation can only utilize two task forces: MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-9 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Chaos[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯混亂[[/span]][[/span]]\") and MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-1 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Catastrophe[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯崩潰[[/span]][[/span]]\") to patrol along the Trans-Siberian Railway for objects suspected to be of SCP-ZH-999.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ZH-999 is an unidentified carriage cluster on the Trans-Siberian Railway (locomotive included), its reported amount of carriages varies (see Addendum 1). The conductor is male, and refers to himself as a traveler or waiter, real name unknown (designated SCP-ZH-999-A). SCP-ZH-999's locomotive and carriages differ between each observed instances, may repeatedly appear but with no discernible patterns. Currently, the most common train type to have appeared were the Electric Locomotives produced by Russian Railways in 1985.\n\nSCP-ZH-999 shows no differences in appearance compared to normal Trans-Siberian Railway trains. However, once subjects (designated SCP-ZH-999-B) enters the train, they will recall memories from the past while riding. SCP-ZH-999-B will typically take a considerably long time doing so, and will, before they depart the train, interrupted by someone who runs into them to converse, which helps SCP-ZH-999-B vent their emotions. Based on audio records and relevant written reports, these recalled memories are usually notable to SCP-ZH-999-B and has affected their life in considerable ways.\n\nAdditionally, after the departure from the train, none would not forget the various emotions that have been recalled while travelling on SCP-ZH-999. Experiments have later shown that, depending on the amount of time spent on SCP-ZH-999, SCP-ZH-999-B will have been emitting Ψ-waves of varying intensities, with the wave being highly contagious. After reaching a certain degree, infected instances will also gain the ability to recall memories.\n\n**Addendum 1:**\nSCP-ZH-999's basic appearance\n* Special note: The number of allocated carriages have varied between each observed instance, with no discernible patterns.\n* The sequence of carriages goes from highest to lowest\n* When over 50 carriages are observed, locomotives are also present in front and back.\n\n||~ Carriage Type||~ Description||~ Notes||\n||Locomotives||SCP-ZH-999's locomotives are mostly of a style of the Soviet era. between every time instances of 999 are found, there have been no commonalities between the locomotives' types (once it was an Imperial era styled steam locomotive).||Numbered 001, typically with one section allocated.||\n||Conductor's room||Connected after the locomotive, cabin conductors will usually hold meetings with the train conductor here, its type does not necessarily match the locomotive's design, and is short compared to a train compartment unit.||Numbered 003, one section in total.||\n||Special-grade singles cabins||Cabin services included, 8 compartments, 8 seatings.

While it's fine in the summer, in winter, he has to walk along the railway with his snow claws or snow boots, smacking the rails with a metal bar, confirming that it's not beveled anywhere, or if there's excess snow piled up.\n\nThe harsh winter frequently gives him frostbite, but he always makes it in time to hide in the worker's cabin to rest and recover his warmth, otherwise the job might actually take an arm or a leg from him. Today is as usual, he has to start before the sun rises (usually dawn is at 10 AM) and walk alongside the railways, numbingly freezing wind blowing on his cheeks. It hurts. Each breath gets blown away by the storm before it gets formed into myst, but he still follows through with his duties and smacks the rails with his bar.\n\nThere should have been more people allocated for this. Such an important job is all on the back of one person, who has to take care of a trip from 20 to 30 kilometers.[[footnote]]**TL Note:** 12.43 to 18.64 miles.[[/footnote]]\n\nHe couldn't remember how long he worked in this environment. The winters in Siberia are long anyways, day after day, day after day; The only thing of concern to him is when there is finally a day which breaks through -40℃, so his good daughter won't have to go to school, and he wouldn't need to hurry off work to pick up the child.\n\nWith his hands in his pockets, he barely remembers his divorced wife's face. That's not important. Memories are of no importance to him, and he doesn't need to remember, just as the train only moves forwards, it wouldn't go the other way. Every ride is a final ride.\n\n@@ @@\n\n\"Excuse me, can I ask for a fire?\" Suddenly he heard a staid voice coming towards him.\n\n\"Sure, oh, here.\" In response to the request, he almost subconsciously reached for his matchbox from his pockets.\n\n\"Thanks mate.\" He slashed the match for a fire and lit the man's cigar, and just realized that something's not right, which made him grab his metal bar firmly, held towards the man wearing his black leather coat in front of him: \"We're on the tracks, you're breaking the traffic code, trespassing into important national areas!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the man took a deep breath of the freezing air, and let out a big white cloud of smoke: \"But I'm just stopping my train around a nearby station, letting the passengers drop off for a walk for a bit. Not moving your body for entire days is not good for your body.\"\n\n\"Huh, I've been around for twenty-something years, and I've never heard of any train stopping at [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dima[[span class=\"rt\"]]Дима[[/span]][[/span]] at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes there is.\" He pointed at the back while holding his cigar in his mouth.

Wanna stop by to get warmed up?\"\n\n@@ @@\n\nThis is not the first time someone has interacted with the entity SCP-ZH-999, and it was not the first written record. However, this record was considered important since he, in a very brief timespan, managed to record the situations within the carriages, faces of the passengers and even that of the train conductor, reactions and emotions all into a notebook with pencil. This notebook was the property of railway worker Kirii. After more relevant sightings and evidence collected, it was internally agreed to make an exception and have Kirii invited into the Foundation.

He never figured out why. Indeed Site-19 is one of the biggest sites of the Foundation, but this traffic has been way too convenient. As he followed this train of thought, he received his ticket and passports, and followed a few accompanying researchers into the carriage. First they flew through two flights to Moscow, followed by an inter-country flight to Irkutsk, and now he is riding the Trans-Siberian Railways towards the train station that is the closest to the Site.\n\nHe has no idea how the people on the site, including Dr. Gears and Dr. Bright, manage to live at all.\n\nLeaning on the table, he looked at the scenery outside zooming backwards, him also zooming down memory lane, revisiting his days on a rendezvous with her. The both of them under their individual professions, but still sharing mutual understanding for each other and met by the staircase every day, as they chatted about work progress, chatted about their life, chatted about plans for their next vacation, and even occasionally chatted about the future.\n\nThat slightly aggressive girl is so adorable in his eyes. This is one of the few times he has actually enjoyed working under the Foundation, as he occasionally saw her frowning face, he would play as a therapist or mimic the speech of a certain person from their work who could always make her smile, he imitates their talking styles and tones, occasionally matching with his own barely amusing outdated gags, the serious face of his always manages to earn a smile from her. Even though the act of imitating other people makes him perplexed and wondering why him, \"himself\" would not have been doing this, but only when he did this himself, it lets those frowning eyebrows relax, it frees the tightly held lips into a beautiful smile. It is only after seeing her smile when he lets his shoulders loose, calms down, and let the atmosphere clear itself.\n\nThen, after a few more rotations between positions, they returned to Site-ZH-44, having both been promoted to Senior Directors, which is when the others were informed that they were in a relationship. A typical relationship as you can imagine for yourself, until one day when their bond has been so deeply entangled, so deeply that they have begun hurting each other.\n\nHolding each other and themselves as bargaining chips.\n\n\"But I care about you so much!\"\n\"No you don't!\" She shouted in return, hissing on top of her throat, until the day when nothing is salvageable any more.\nYou still remember, remember the time when she yelled at you, the roaring coming towards you, the statements where you have never considered her feelings and only took care of yourself. You wanted to grab her by her arm, but she shook you off.\n\"I was...\"\n\"You shut up, you shut up, shut up!\" Hearing her voice like that, it was the first time you felt so miserable, tears about to burst from your eyes.\n\"I...\"\n\"Why wouldn't you ever ask me for all the important decisions! Why do you just care about your own feelings? Why? Tell me!\"\n\"I...\" You had no grounds to argue back.\n\"You had absolutely no idea what I was thinking, why would you decide on my behalf!\"\n\"But it...\"\n\"I said I could take care of it! Why wouldn't you believe me?\"\n\"I just...\"\n\"How many times have this been!\"\n\nYeah, how many times have this been. But I loved her, I really loved her. I want to be with her, I want to enter the ceremony hall with her, I want to age and be with her until our deaths, I wish for her to live: Alive. A luxurious wish under the Foundation indeed, as I've realized, which is why I've kept her away from all the potentially dangerous skips again and again.\n\n\"Alisa and the others are all saying that I've not had to manage skips only because I could rely on the Site Director, did you hear of this? Now everyone in the entire Site have heard about it!\"\n\"No, it's not like that...\" I hurriedly asserted another line, sprinting to grab her wrist: \"Luthi... Don't-\"\n\n\"Don't what, say it!\"\n\"Calm down,\" I tried to calm down, as well as hoping that the person in front of me who I care about would also calm down.\n\"Every time I'm asked to calm down, do the things you want me to do, say the things only you want to hear!\"\n\"Okay okay okay, calm down for a bit, let's discuss this properly.

This entire memory vs not memory thing is very hard to translate.[[/footnote]]\" I said, perhaps the effects of social exclusion are worse than I thought, to the point where it affects her mental status.\n\nAnd then she stared at me with those eyes, deeply imprinting the view into her heart, just like when we first met: \"Sure.\" She calms down, her pretty lips let out simple and discrete syllables.\n\nChillingly.\n\n\"Then just **forget** it.\"\n\nThere was nothing more that came of it.\n\n@@ @@\n\nJust in time, the memories were disturbed by a knock on the door. I wiped my tears off from my face hurriedly, opened the lunch box on the table which only had a bottle of water, bread and some chocolates; With bread, at least I could pretend to be eating: \"Come in.\"\n\n\"Director, I've checked, this carriage only has two bathrooms in the front and back. If you want to use the showers, you will need to walk to the 7th carriage, which costs 150 rubles to use.\"\n\nI felt sour, my heart cramping in pain: \"Thank you, Dr. Flavir, you're very helpful indeed.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the compliment,\" she responded without excess emotion, as if this has always been our mode of communication: \"Please get some rest then, Director.\"\n\n\"I will.\" My hands below my desk grabbed the corner of my napkin to when it has wrinkled, my legs trembling, these memories were simply too sudden, too quick, too sorrowful and too real, why, why, why the hell, shouldn't it be where humans don't recall previous memories?\n\n\"I'll take my leave then.\"\n\n\"Wait, Luthi...... I mean, Flavir.\"\n\n\"Yes, Director, anything else?\" She stopped her footsteps; If only she also stopped her footsteps that other time.

Very good, let us start then, please see the slides. We are under a huge impending threat, from what we understand so far, the anomalous effect of SCP-ZH-999 the train running on the Trans-Siberian Railway is that it enables people to **recall** past events, which is extremely **detrimental** to our society.\n> \n> O5-12: I can comprehend the importance of this, but I'm not sure where I come in, One, I mean, why are we all gathered for this meeting?\n> \n> O5-8: Recommending audit, One, you've became indecisive. If this was up to me I would not let it drag out for this long, how would such a dangerous item still be allowed to operate up until now?\n> \n> O5-6: Eight, please calm down, we've already worked hard on this, my Security Department and I have even spent an entire year non-stop just to chase it, how about you could take the next shift and go through Siberia's winter.\n> \n> O5-5: This case is indeed important, as it is evident that under high enough intensity, people would take out their memories, that could lead to them drowning within them and no longer being productive.\n> \n> O5-4: Everyone, I agree with Five, we all have our own professions, but only focusing on the professional level is not enough. One gathered us here to brainstorm an effective containment strategy for this SCP, isn't that right?\n> \n> O5-11: Words by the \"Ambassador\" are always so pertinent, it's such a pleasure to see.\n> \n> O5-4: Thank you, \"Father of Lies\", as is from dealing with politicians, my speaking skills still have not matched the con men such as yourself.\n> \n> O5-9: Put a break to this, for now we have sent MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-9 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Chaos[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯混亂[[/span]][[/span]]\") and MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Dubhe[[span class=\"rt\"]]天樞[[/span]][[/span]]-1 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Catastrophe[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯崩潰[[/span]][[/span]]\") along the rails to investigate, is that so.\n> \n> O5-6: All my men, but this is at a pace too slow, it's absolutely not a scientific approach.\n> \n> O5-7: This isn't a product of science either, Six. I think we should enact a massive containment project specifically targeting SCP-ZH-999, at a moment's notice. We all know that Russian Railways are one of the world's top in its carrying capacity, and it seems that we cannot currently see a limit to SCP-ZH-999's extended carriages. Ψ-waves might even already be common to all Russians, if we don't handle this carefully, we might trigger a LK-Class Species Transmutation scenario.\n> \n> O5-3: Seems like you have ideas already, Seven?\n> \n> O5-7: I only look towards the future, quite honestly looking back is not my strength; For ideas I am not certain of solid ones, but I think I know someone who has some insights about this. Dr. Yanovski, I am sending the details to all of you now, please look at your tablets and receivers.\n> \n> O5-4: Can we trust him?\n> \n> O5-9: Don't compare him to your politician friends, at least he's loyal to the Foundation.\n> \n> O5-6: Indeed we have to be careful and prevent LK-Class scenarios. We don't have the luxury to activate the Yellowstone Agreement, please vote as I wear my hat, as a Security Overseer, I have lots to do still.\n> \n> O5-1: Then the topic will be to assign Dr. Yanovski as the project manager in charge, for him to design a massive containment project specifically to contain SCP-ZH-999. I hope we've reached a consensus from the discussion stage that has preceeded.\n> \n>  \n> **Meeting Summary: Yes: 11 No: 0 Abstained: 1**\n> \n\n@@ @@\n----\n+ Recovered Document SCP-ZH-999-Б Incident Log Excerpt\n**Affected Personnel:** Dr. Danza Zalord (Site-ZH-81 Medical Department Deputy Director)\n**Time:** ██/11/20██\n**Location:** Carriage A\n\n> Undeniably, many things cannot be performed through only recollections or memories.

From those that he lacked the ability to save and the situations obtained from them, to those that he voluntarily forfeited rescuing and the situations obtained from them, and the situations obtained from the student named Andrey.\n\nThat was his best friend throughout high school, and it may as well have been one of the few who were interested in a relationship with him, as after school he would always ask Danza if he wanted to play ball, or ride a bike, or go to which park around for a walk. Despite Andrey not knowing that Danza's health conditions renders him unfit for participating in these activities, and not knowing that he was an artificial man. As time went on, the boys in the class would slowly fade away, and neither the girls were interested in the him who was weak either. It was only Andrey that would always call out to him no matter what he was doing.\n\nAnd then this angel-like boy got Leukemia[[footnote]]**TL Note:** Blood cancer.[[/footnote]].\n\n\"I'll do the pairing, Andery, you'll be saved!\"\n\n\"Your body is even weaker than mine, how would you be doing it Danza!\"\n\nAs was said, but everyone could tell from Andery's gaze whether it was flashing a glimpse of hope to live. And on the day when he would be drawing off blood, an emergency phone call from the Foundation rang to his phone.\n\n\"Danza, we have a request for you, an extremely urgent case.\"\n\nAnd so he turned to leave the blood drawing counter, the next day when he went to school again, not only were he ignored by the pupils who were already neglecting him, but even Andery turned a blind eye.\n\n\"Sorry Andery, I'll go draw blood today!\"\n\n\"Don't bother, you weren't trying to save me at all, huh.\"\n\nSo when Andery finally made it to stage four, Danza's guardian in the Foundation gave him a final chance, \"the Foundation has a way to save him.\"\n\n\"Whatever, never mind,\" he said, abnormally unconcerned, perhaps artificial men really have no perception of empathy, \"so be it.\"\n\nNever were there anything to consider salvaging.\n\nHe dropped communication with the Foundation for a while, making his guardian so nervous that he went to the school dormitory to get him, even to the point where he had the instinct to shoot the guard dead on the spot if the guard didn't let him go.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed in you, Danza, I am very disappointed in the kind of response which you gave.\" He grabbed Danza by the arm immediately: \"About your negligence towards the lives of others, your negligence towards friendship, your negligence towards humanity and your negligence towards your own career potential.

Even if you're a Homunculus, you still have your own ability to choose your future and the fate you are to follow.\"\n\n\"Andery could had been saved by you, but go rethink on what you did.\"\n\nDanza went on to finish his Master's Degree in Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology (B.Sc.), but he rejected the invitation from the Foundation, and on his own accords, he went to Oxford UK to study his PhD in Philosophy and Ethics.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\"You are researcher Zalord?\" One day I was asked this.\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Then allow me to call you Doctor Zalord.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I should have hid this n-...\"\n\nHe pushes an envelop onto my office desk: \"Please be seated.

If it cannot be completely contained, military force as an exclusion measure is ruled out.\n> Currently it seems that the two MTFs performing investigations along the railways are not enough. Due to trains on the Trans-Siberian Railway having varying appearances, it is impossible to discern which train is SCP-ZH-999 without entering inside. In lieu of this, the following solution is proposed:\n> * + Build the second Siberian Railway.\n> This plan will be expensive. However, this enables the ability to single out the SCP by re-routing all normal trains into the new railway. Under this condition, the entity can be easily identified and contained. Due to Chinese and Russian governments seemingly interested in planning for such a railway project, said objective is extremely likely to be achieved.\n> An additional task force MTF-[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Skybed[[span class=\"rt\"]]天床[[/span]][[/span]]-5 (\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Logic Necrosis[[span class=\"rt\"]]邏輯壞死[[/span]][[/span]]\") will assist in investigations, and to route all normal trains onto the new rail.

It's been over ten years by now and to see that none of you have been altered makes me very glad. Let us get to the point, project [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Silver Scales[[span class=\"rt\"]]銀鱗[[/span]][[/span]] has ran for over ten years, and the second lane of the Siberian Railways has finished construction as well. To start from the conclusion, this project has progressed too slowly. Firstly, we could not convince the Russian government to redirect all trains to the Baikal-Amur Mainline, and additionally the effect of our MTFs just don't seem to be very effective.\n> \n> O5-12: I saw the report, it said that it's almost reaching a containment failure?\n> \n> O5-7: Yes, almost. It seems we have no way of effectively stopping the spread of Ψ-waves, and we can't make the Russian government shut down the entire railway. So today, the topic to discuss is whether project [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Silver Scales[[span class=\"rt\"]]銀鱗[[/span]][[/span]] is to go on, and what improvements we can make in the case that we continue it. Or maybe a new wave of containment plans?\n> \n> O5-9: Allow me to propose a bold assumption? Suppose that the item is not to be contained, what would happen to humanity as a whole? I'm not new here, don't give me that look. After all, just looking at the various reporting documents, we do have positive cases.\n> \n> O5-5: Yes there are, but you can't neglect the majority of them who are drowning in depressing memories. Positive cases are in the rarity, and depressing moments will be more strongly remembered than joyous moments. With too many types of depressing events, and usually acted on by multiple sources simultaneously, this makes it more likely to be deeply imprinted. On the other hand, good events are easily countable and tend to be single distinct events. Our memories are untrustworthy, recollections especially so, the process of recollections in particular will organize the memories as you want it to be. Isn't that dangerous?\n> \n> O5-8: Five has a good point, I propose immediately restarting [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Silver Scales[[span class=\"rt\"]]銀鱗[[/span]][[/span]], the item must be contained.\n> \n> O5-5: Eight, thank you, I know that there are voices of objection among us, but I hope we will unite, we must avoid LK-Class scenarios.\n> \n> O5-2: Five, allow me to interrupt. I don't believe forced containment is viable. It seems that everyone has a change to gain recollections. Memories belong to each of us all, rather than having a breach in containment and panic over the clean up work, I think we should lay the foundation for reducing the risk that comes in the future. We should not waste expenses on attempting to contain, but on to protect.\n> \n> O5-9: Those are my thoughts as well, but I want to hear from Six, as an Operational Observer (??) of the Security Department, what do you think.\n> \n> O5-9: Six, don't you ignore me.\n> \n> O5-6: That's not up to me to answer, Nine. I have basically no thoughts on this, and I might even selfishly want to see the world where it breaches, just to see how everyone reacts while being stuck in their emotions. Of course I can't, so I have no opinions, you lot can decide.\n> \n> O5-11: I suggest deploying both strategies. Under the lack of a better proposal, this is a compromise as the safest way forward.\n> \n> O5-8: Can you believe it? This coming from Eleven!\n> \n> O5-1: Okay, calm down, everyone will get half an hour to decide. We will be voting on whether [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Silver Scales[[span class=\"rt\"]]銀鱗[[/span]][[/span]] is to continue, or for a new containment plan to be developed. Give yourselves a cigarette, ladies and gentlemen.\n> \n> \n> **Meeting Summary: Yes: 4(+1) No: 4 Abstained: 4**\n> \n> O5-13: I think containment efforts should be extended.

I like buying a seat by the window, as the scenery that flies by in a flash is just like my memories which I can't recall.\n\n\"You're the person taking the opposite side?\" Someone approaches and asked. He has a firm figure and is muscular, almost like the mafia bosses in Russian movies. So sad. So I just quietly nodded.\n\"Hello, I'm Sergei.\"\n\"Tslyonaya, hello.\" I shook hands with him, his palm was firm and warm. I cowardly observed him, until he took snacks and dessert from his luggage to share. I don't know why there are always people who think I'm too skinny, or appear too fragile. Either way, it was comforting to encounter this rare kindness and it let me lower my guard, so we started chatting. I think this is the first time that someone talked about his daughter, describing it in such great detail, to the point as if they were events that has just happened.\n\n\"She's the most precious person.\" He said, holding the photo. \"Really, the most precious indeed.\"\n\n\"I can feel that.\" I smiled, looking at the man in front. He was so gentle while sharing these stories, gentle to the point where I feel deeply guilty to have pictured him as a mafia boss as my first impression of him. He helped fill hot water in my cup. With the central light system turning off on us, to rush us to sleep, we were like best friends at first sight, exchanging topics one after another and chatting endlessly. Until when the topic was suddenly about me.\n\n\"So what's your most precious thing?\"\n\n\"What do you mean precious, didn't we...\" A few melodies flew through my mind, some faces, some concerts, sometimes running in the snow, sometimes crying together... etc, etc...

He led me to where I wanted to go, to where I should be going.\" I said, immediately understanding why I'm crying. I once had someone to lead myself forwards, someone who gave me power, someone important. Originally, I did have one.\n\nOriginally.\n\n\"But he has left already.\" I cried, like the night when the accident happened. I remember crying, continuously crying, searching for him in a city without him, with his music replaying in my head on loop. To lose somethings hurts, it hurts, as if someone is holding a knife and scooping out the meat around your heart cut by cut. These memories were so clear that it's as if it just happened yesterday. \"... I- and I went to his last concert, I should had brought flowers, I should had waited for him to walk out from the back stage, I should have said thanks to him directly, I should...\"\n\n\"... Sorry, sorry Valery, sorry for the many things I could not do in time. Sorry-Sorry for missing the last chance to thank you.\" I tried to hold my mouth and not make sounds that are too loud, but kept crying hysterically. Other passengers are sleeping, I'm accompanied by the starry night sky, memories flooding out of my consciousness, breathing sounds while they are in their dreams, and the loud clashing of the train pressing on the metal rails.\n\nAnd I felt a warm palm on my shoulder, patting repeatedly, like tides, like the tidal waves of the Black Sea hitting on the shore, bringing the baton into view.\n\n\"I see. I'll thank you in Valery's stead; It's been many years, but still someone remembers him.\" He says while patting my shoulder. \"It's fine to let it out like this.\"\n\n@@ @@\nYou don't know how long you've cried for, nor do you remember when you fell asleep. When you opened your eyes again, Sergei is preparing to leave the train.\n\n\"Thanks for last night.\" You said.\n\n\"It's fine, no need to thank. I'm glad to have met you, be sure to take care on the rest of your journey and don't catch a cold. Don't go anywhere dangerous either. I wish for you to be happy.\"\n\n\"You too, hopefully you'll see your daughter soon. By the way, if I may ask, your full name is?\" Tslyonaya raised the courage to ask.\n\n\"Oh, I see, I didn't say it.\" The station's broadcast sounds can be heard, almost suppressing the man's voice. \"I'm Sergei Khalilov.\"\n\n**Aftermath:** Tslyonaya arrived at the terminal station after three days, and visited the conductor's room alone. She stated to be made aware of the anomalous properties of the train, and inquired if there was a way to keep her power of recalling her memories, not ruling out voluntarily working on the train.

After leaving the train, Tslyonaya returned to a normal life, but extraordinarily remembered everything on the train, even writing articles which turned into a project with the publishing company to publish a book.

He wishes for all the things he remembered last night to be a mere nightmare. None of these nights have he gotten a good night's sleep; Every night he was awakened from his dream to his teammates who were either on their night guard or in their deep slumber.\n\nHe doesn't understand why he keeps remembering these horrifying memories, he doesn't understand why. Despite that his colleagues would also occasionally be affected by their memories and enter a slump, why is he the only person to experience such dread?\n\nOn the fourth day, he was once again buzzed awake by another scarlet-colored dream. The dream combined blood, sweat and things that he didn't even know for himself, perhaps... Only perhaps, it was amniotic fluid or something else.\n\n\"Vice-captain, are you okay?\" The teammate in the back looked at Nikolay in a concerned fashion, \"the other members aren't doing so well either, should we retreat?\"\n\n\"N- no.\" He holds the cold handrails, while the entire team is distributed between the two sides at the front and back, \"Our specialty is in data gathering and detection, we...\"\n\nHe saw the naked woman screaming, crazily, hysterically, her body shaking intensely, her sizable belly looks as if she is about to give birth at any moment, and her scream, striking fear into the soul, as if it's the sound of a demon from the abyss running loose.\n\nFloating from the depths of his consciousness, he felt a nervous breakdown coming. How he took up a job like this without even blinking, how he obeyed the will of the Foundation to execute containment plans, how he told everyone \"you've all made a mistake, this SCP doesn't exist at all, I'm merely ordered to monitor a humanoid figure's vital readings.\" How he had to deal with the SCP differing from the written description as given, and how he has to make-do with special containment procedures which are not ethical even in the slightest. How he became accustomed to the SCP being practically of not six, but seven. And the sixth death brought with it suffering that still extends into the present.\n\n\"We need to gather as much data about this train as possible.\" He covered his mouth, stopping his urge to vomit, \"if possible, find the conductor, we need to have a direct conversation with him.\"\n\nHe remembered a lot of things, every time the frightening memories flooded his mind, he could barely keep himself standing.\n\nHave I became too fragile. He thought. It's only because he browsed recollections which he has never paid attention to once again, even noticing more details than the moment it happened. Those reverberating machines that consume people, SCPs that turn humans into organs, even more and more, buried secrets of the Foundation.\n\nWhy didn't he care about these before?\n\nWhy haven't he ever doubted what the Foundation actually is?\n\n\"Captain...\" Fuzzy sounds are heard from the transceiver. \"We found it, conductor, he's currently checking tickets at the 57th carriage, we did not enter yet, but the second team have came up with a disguise to get around to the 58th carriage.\"\n\n\"Excellent... Try to make time.\" You said, carrying deep fears. Even without continuing to recall, the trepidation remains after the trauma and it almost drives his heart out of his esophagus.\n\nAll the memories were too vivid, all the torment were too clear.\n\nPain, you only remember pain, the kind of pain that punctures a thousand wounds and holes into you but still demanding your sanity to remain.\n\nIt is the kind of pain that every Foundation Agent needs to shoulder.\n\nTo experience the shock encountering a SCP's true nature, to be made aware of the cruel special containment procedures, the fear of a containment breach, the pain of losing colleagues or even your own life. You have to bear it all.\n\n\"This is why Agents experience more frequent psychological assessment rounds than Researchers, why Agents are more likely to be administered amnestics than Researchers.\"\n\nNow you know everything.\n\n@@ @@\n\nWith heavy footsteps, I made it in front of the conductor in my sorry figure.\n\n\"Dear customer, it seems like you haven't been getting enough rest. Where's your carriage, if I may bring you there?\" He made a polite smile, still wearing the same dark leather coat as depicted on that document.\n\n\"I'm fine, SCP-ZH-999-A, I'm here to ask for a favor.\"\n\n\"You know I don't like that designation.\" He answers, suddenly tensed up, \"You can call me the conductor, a visitor or a waiter.\"\n\n\"You know about the Foundation?\"\n\n\"You've been investigating this train for half the century, never mind those who accidentally came on-board, of course I knew.\"\n\n\"Then as you know about the Foundation,\" I raised my hand to gesture a sign, to let my colleagues around the doors on the two sides to lower their rifles, \"Then I'm asking to have you take away this ability from me.\"\n\n**Aftermath:** Agent Nikolay appeared very calm upon departing SCP-ZH-999. He stated to not remember the slightest degree of things occurred to him on the train, and often expressed the past is not to be feared and he moves towards tomorrow. Showing extreme loyalty to the Foundation, and after transferring to SCP-231 for the third supervision project, based on his excellent response and detection, and observational skills, is transferred to work on Site-ZH-81.\n@@ @@\n----\n\n+ Protect\n* Meeting Topic: On follow-up of SCP-ZH-999's containment breach\n* Participants: O5 Council\n* Date: ██/██/20██\n\n> O5-7: Containment breached.\n> \n> O5-4: Simply and precisely indeed, Seven.\n> \n> O5-7: We don't even have half of everyone here, shouldn't you be busy as a bee, \"Ambassador\"?\n> \n> O5-4: Not right now, it will be my turn to work when they can remember everything, let me enjoy a break for now.\n> \n> O5-11: Do I have something to do this time?\n> \n> O5-10: Even I have started to wonder if I should put this in my notes, adding another stroke for the world's end.\n> \n> O5-1: No need, Ten. \n> \n> O5-4: Here you are, One.

He should be resting in the cabin properly. --]\n[!-- \"Don't follow me.\" --]\n[!-- \"No, you shouldn't do this..\" --]\n[!-- \"I said don't follow me did you not understand?\" The man in front grabbed me by my neck instantly, \"which officer are you under?\" --]\n[!-- \"Uh that... I met with you all at Yekaterinburg, and to be truthful I'm not assigned. I usually just follow the lead, if there is one I should be directly under you.\" --]\n[!-- The man in front was silent for a few seconds, and then released his hands, \"I'm sorry, you can go follow Frangel or Semenov.\" --]\n\n[!-- He turns to leave, but Yaroslav quickly grabbed his sir's hand, \"I won't ask why you're telling me this, considering I'm but a Sergeant who just graduated from military academy, I am not to doubt the orders from you, the supreme commander, but you're really too far away from the train; we're already at the Czech Legion's carriage, I doubt it will be very safe here.\" Seeing no response from the supreme commander, he rushes to continue, \"my teacher always complained about his brother living in Petrograd, he said that no matter what someone had to be the one to catch him when something wrong is done. If you are determined, please let me follow.\" --]\n[!-- Yaroslav fiddled with his gun in his arms, and raised a confident smile on his handsome face. --]\n[!-- \"What's your name?\" --]\n[!-- \"Yaroslav, sir!\" --]\n[!-- \"Aleksandar Vasilyjevic.\" --]\n\n[!-- The two arrived at some rail on the Tomsk railway station together, there parked a train which has never had its appearance seen. Alexander without a doubt of any circumstances walked past the train head locomotive to make it onto the train in one step, disappearing out of sight instantly. It forces Yaroslav to suspend his disbelief and chased after taking a deep breath. --]\n[!-- The interior of the carriage was not what would be seen in the carriages of the time. He tailed his sir to pass through a few carriages, arriving at their destination. --]\n\n[!-- -Conductor's room--]\n[!-- \"Gentlemen, this is a violation of the Empire Law. Neither of you purchased a ticket, plus this train is not to carry passengers.\" --]\n[!-- \"I'm not boarding for a ride.\" Alexander unties his cufflink carefully, places it on the table, the cufflink inscribed with a two-headed eagle, and in front of the eagle's chest there is an unknown decorative egg and the Orthodox Church's crossed-shield-shaped banner. \"I know the royal arcanist and am also part of the society, here's the keepsake as proof.\" --]\n[!-- \"Oh... Oh, I see, you are the officer that Peter mentioned then.\" The conductor picks up the cufflink, repeatedly studies it in detail, and puts it into a fine wooden box at the side, which was filled with cufflinks of the same design. --]\n[!-- He stood and put on his large-plate cap. \"Recovered item number 963, greetings from the conductor.\" --]\n[!-- Alexander nods in response, leaving Yaroslav at the side watching without a clue. --]\n\n[!-- \"What's my duty?\" --]\n[!-- \"My train is too heavy, I need to ease its weight.\" --]\n[!-- \"I can understand that.\" --]\n[!-- \"I have 1600 tons of gold, as given by His Majesty, along with other treasures, including a decorative egg.\"--]\n[!-- The conductor nods and smiles, \"the gold made with?\" --]\n[!-- \"What else would it be of? Gold is gold!\" Yaroslav speaks for once, in response to the two people in front of them who began rambling about things that he's never even heard of, whatever the royal arcanist, society and decorative eggs were. --]\n[!-- Yaroslav raises his gun: \"General, this is obviously a trap! Don't be fooled.\"--]\n[!-- \"Calm down...\" But before the sentence was finished, he shot at the conductor's kneecap in close proximity twice, a loud bang to mark the moment, even with echos to be heard. --]\n[!-- \"Ugh, are the new troops these days always as ill-tempered?\" --]\n[!-- \"I'm sorry, conductor.\" He pulls Yaroslav's gun over, not forgetting to take a glimpse at his astonished recruit before turning over; Impossible, for him to have missed in such short distance, how would the conductor appear barely harmed? --]\n[!-- \"1600 tons.\" He throws the gun to the side. \"1600 tons of memories.\" --]\n[!-- \"So very valuable isn't it, Peter, he finally mastered such technique at last.\" He says, looking at the well-dressed man in front of him, \"You know what the price is right. It's not a small number, it could affect the entire human race.\" --]\n[!-- \"I do,\" he nods. --]\n[!-- \"Such greed, or should I say... Such loyalty, Alexander Vasilyevich, to the tsar who is too kind.\" --]\n[!-- \"Indeed, who'd have the majesty be so kind.\" --]\n\n[!-- Evening, the few carriages connected to the very back of the train was detached from the front carriages. Connected to a train locomotive never seen before and dragged away. --]\n[!-- \"I'm promising to take away these memories, including that egg, but I'm not guaranteeing its safety.\" --]\n[!-- \"I know.\" Alexander stands by the rails, observing the carriages slowly dragged away. \"Upon my death, take care (**TL Note:** Dispose of.) of these things, don't let the Red Army get their hands on it. --]\n[!-- \"General, can you tell me the actual order from last night?\" Yaroslav asks, trembling at the side, the three thousand carriages of the Czech Legion were finally all cleared, but they still have to prepare for the rest of their journey.--]\n[!-- \"I sent away all army generals under my lead. It's too dangerous to go on.\" --]\n[!-- \"... Then, please have me watch the carriages for you.\" He says, \"Even though I don't know thaumaturgy, things like recovered items, memories... But I can at least contribute my effort, to follow wherever the carriages are. This is the only thing of value I can do for you, as a new recruit. I am young, and I have the energy, I will never lose sight of any of it.\" --]\n[!-- Seeing a flash of determination in his eyes, Alexander silently nods. --]\n[!-- \"Go.\" He says. \"May we meet one day again.\" --]\n[!-- Yaroslav salutes, a proper form and very handsome, welcoming the sun rising above its curtain in the horizons, to have lit up the snowy fields, \"Glory to the empire.\" --]\n[!-- \"Glory to the empire.\" --]\n\n[!-- Aftermath: 1600 tons of gold was lost in 1920, rumored to have sank to the bottom of Lake Baikal. No matter how many teams or exploration ships were sent, nothing resembling gold could be found from the bottom of the lake. --]\n@@ @@\n----\n+ Unofficial records on containment breach of 999, constituting as a memoir\n* **Written by:** Dr. Glass (Foundation's Chief Psychologist)\n* **Written at:** ██/12/20██\n* **Written on:** This ridiculous thing and the world post SCP-ZH-999 breaching containment\n\n> That had to be a day when I was shaken awake with my own memories. No, to be precise, it was a flashback of my recollections, flooding my head in waves and waves. I remembered many things, many many things, enough to keep me from working for two entire weeks and barely suffocating me to death.\n> \n> Though really, what was suffocating me would have been all the patients coming to visit within these two weeks. The room which would have everyone gladly avoiding suddenly had flocks of people lining up. Everyone are falling apart, crying their eyes out, nervous like nothing else matters. I could still, in great detail, remember the long queue of faces waiting for me as I went to work on time at eight in the morning.\n> \n> Disappointingly, I still haven't seen Dr. Gears, but Researcher Iceberg showed up.\n> \n> While working, I could still distract myself with my job, but it's my turn to suffer when it's the night. I had flashbacks of a lot of things, including those patients in the morning... Oh god, oh god oh! I really don't want to remember who you made love with how many times in a single day, that's just not something I need all the gory details for, Dr. Bright. Also, why collapse to the point of ruining your own site but still not come do a proper checkup, Konny? It's been two months without a visit, is he really that scared of amnestics being administered?\n> \n> Anyways, this is oddly ridiculous. So weird that I've started doubting myself. Am I one who always could have been wielding recollections? Until some day I realized the truth. But to know the truth, it is even more dumbfounding, as now regardless am I to discuss **being able to remember** it'd be meaningless, isn't it? After all, we can all remember now.\n> \n> To remember implies many things, your life will start to slow down adjusting to these recollections. Heh, memories are even more sly than Dr. Clef, everyone can be their own Type Green in their head, as long as they'd like to tamper with them. Isn't that a scary thing?\n> \n> But to comment on this, I'd say that being able to recall is pretty good. The life we go through is not just of sad and painful memories, but also upbeat and joyous memories. As for how these subjective events are handled is homework for each individual, someone can certainly be down due to a break-up, but could also take their next step and search for new chances; they may be limited by their own selfishness, yet could also discover the good in humanity; they may suffer great pain for their companions, but could also expand their horizons and meet new friends, leaving their hatred for the past; or they may also be chained by the sorrow of losing a significant other, but who knows... Perhaps their persistence was not in vain.\n> \n> Could we say that recollections make for the infinite possibilities in people? Even the authoritative essay \"Differences in Memory and Recollection: On whether Recollections are hindering the progression of human societies\" stopped short of giving a defining answer to whether having recollections would negatively affect societal progression.\n> \n> Everything is so wonderful, isn't it?\n> \n> Even the train itself is so wonderful.

Russian Railways has stated that the cabin structure and cabin amounts of such carriers have been within appropriate limits. Its interior configuration was said to be in accordance with Russian railway regulations. The conductor is male, and refers to himself as Dmitry(Дмитрий). SCP-ZH-9288-EX is treated as a regular train that runs on the Trans-Siberian Railway, as a regular sleeper wagon, with four carriages, on-train dining and other services also provided. Its starting point is the Moscow-Yaroslav Station, and its terminal at Vladivostok-Vladivostok Station, totaling 9288 kilometers.\n\n@@ @@\n----\n+ Final train approaches platform\n\nAs the train arrived, the sounds of the horn and broadcast were especially memorable. Finally this time I'm not to watch someone get up, tidy their sleeping spot or seat, to watch them unboard the train. Finally, it's my turn. Our turn to have my team and I end our mission.\n\n\"Please don't walk on the tracks.\" The announcements always bring up this advice, but why are the rails specifically mentioned? Even though it is stated, there are always those few who willfully let their life shatter as a fleeting spark, the line that I don't understand, and yet the sensation of comfort which I am simultaneously enjoying, the voice and feeling that could be compared to; likely the times of youth back when going to school, having your mother knock your bedroom's door to get you awake and the sensation in those memories. To have made you anxious but yet comforting.\n\n> The mission is over. Agent Ivan, you're in position to have your team return.\n\n\"Roger.\" I spoke to the calling device softly, to not have my voice be loud enough to overwhelm the comforting broadcast.\n\nThe temperature is very low, so low to the point that the sky is sunny and not snowing, but even the bright sunlight isn't effectively giving our land the warmth they need. At least we have a beautiful blue sky, a blue sky.\n\nI raised my head to observe the sunlit sky through the window, and opened the window to let the freezing cold air hit my face. I was able to use it to breathe white fog, as if I was smoking a cigar. I told my teammates that the mission is over, and turned off the calling device amidst their quiet cheering. Fortunately this event ended peacefully without any casualties.\n\nI pulled the edge of my hat, tidied my neck and tie and dragged my luggage off the train with a smile that any successful business-person should have. The conductor takes my luggage and helped in putting it on the platform.\n\n\"Business?\" From the conductor's thin lips, a voice comparable to that of the broadcast was uttered.\n\"Yes, business.\" I answered.\n\"May your business go well.\"\n\"Many thanks, and here's to wishing you always riding safely.\" I lightly picked up my hat and nodded softly. I could see through the corner of my eyes that my teammates are waiting for me.\n\nIt's fine, let them wait.\n\n\"First time on the big railways?\" The conductor asked another question, voice slightly hoarse.\n\nThe question that rarely gets a correct answer. After all, what difference is there really, between the first and the second? After all, every train is the final train. No one holds a return ticket in their hands; Time passes by, turning into memories, memories turned into flashbacks, to be stored in our hearts. No matter who you've met on the train, what you've encountered while on the train, what missions you finished on the train, none of it is very important. It's only to be remembered.\n\nBut I opened my notebook, turned to a particular page, densely packed with drawn symbols.\n\nI gave a smile and answered the conductor's question.\n\n\"This has been my 1453rd time on the railways.\"\n　\n> When inquired of whether anything was unusual, they all responded: Nothing out of the ordinary.",
