These clips were designated to go alongside traditional training, and provided background on anomalous entities and incidents that the Site Director felt would be useful for the training.\n\nThese files included entities that would otherwise be locked behind O5 clearance. Investigation into how these files were accessed by the site director, and the danger such files pose to the greater Foundation, was ongoing prior to the completion of the series.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++ Incident Report\n\n**SCP Involved:** //Numerous//\n\n**Date:** May, 2024 - Ongoing\n\n**Location:** Nanisivik Naval Facility, Site-230\n\n**Description:** During May of the year 2024, the Site Director of Site-230, Dr. Robin, appeared on-the-air reporting that an XK-Class End of The World scenario has occurred around October, 2023. With their world destroyed, starting in May, they began the production of a radio series hosted from Site 230 to give official Foundation File Information, on-the-ground Field Reports, and Ask-and-Answer Segments to help the general populous survive the end of the world.\n\nThis show appears to be weekly, airing every Monday at 6pm Atlantic (5pm Eastern). Given the fact that the world still exists, it is believed that this radio show is hosted from a parallel universe, and is anomalous in nature. Investigation into it is ongoing. Previous log has been archived due to this discovery.\n\nBelow are two clips from the show, recovered by our Anomalous Radio Activity team.\n\n**Clip 1: Sharkpunching**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/wttf-podcast-hub/Sharkboxing\n]]\n\n**Clip 2: Death of a Dying God**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/wttf-podcast-hub/Dying_God\n]]\n\n**Clip 3: The Avian Guardians**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wttf-podcast-hub/Avian\n]]\n\n**Clip 4: SCP-000**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n    |type=audio\n    |url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wttf-podcast-hub/SCP-000\n]]\n\nThe following tag-lines has been often-repeated within the show:\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n\n++ Welcome To The XK, those of you lucky enough to still be alive.\n\n\n\n++ Tune in to your guide against all things anomalous, every Monday at 6pm Atlantic.\n\n\n\n++ ##red|Stay Hidden.
