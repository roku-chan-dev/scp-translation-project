Three (3) samples, of a total twelve (12), were stolen. [DATA EXPUNGED] since the initial containment break, outbreaks of one of the stolen bacterial strains, //Propionibacterium 047-A//, were recorded globally in communities of increasing size and population density. Further information on stolen material, spread, and containment follows.\n\n**Compromised Items:** //Propionibacterium 047-A//, //Streptococcus 047-C//, and //Clostridium 047-A//. See [[[SCP-047]]] for further information.\n\n**Outbreak information:**\n> **First Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 27/02/2010, Siberia. Contained: see Incident Report P047A-03-2010.\n\n> **Second Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 30/03/2010, Northwest Territories (Canada). Contained: see Incident Report P047A-04-2010\n\n> **Third Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 29/04/2010, South Australia. Contained: see Incident Report P047A-05-2010\n\n> **Fourth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 27/05/2010, Mato Grosso (Brazil). Believed contained: see Incident Report P047A-06-2010. __Warning:__ Agents in the area are advised to familiarise themselves with the symptoms of //P-047-A// and be on the lookout for possible infection.\n\n> **Fifth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 26/06/2010, [REDACTED], Iraq. Site immediately [DATA EXPUNGED] which is believed to have contained the infection. Access to Incident Report denied without O5 clearance.\n\n> **Sixth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 26/07/2010, Cameroon. Quarantine enacted. Efforts to track outgoing civilians underway. **Infection not contained.** See Incident Report P047A-07-2010\n\n> **Seventh Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 24/08/2010, Dalarna (Sweden). Quarantine enacted. Believed contained. See Incident Report P047A-08-2010. __Warning:__ Agents in the area are advised to familiarise themselves with the symptoms of //P-047-A// and be on the lookout for possible infection.\n\n> **Eighth Outbreak:** //Not recorded//. Believed to have taken place in North Korea. [DATA EXPUNGED] Agents with government access are attempting to gain access to parallel information, but due to [DATA EXPUNGED] local services have been extremely uncooperative. **Containment status unknown.**\n\n> **Ninth Outbreak:** //P-047-A//, 23/10/2010, South Carolina (United States of America). Quarantine enacted. Efforts to track outgoing civilians primarily successful. One civilian in a pickup truck is believed to have [DATA EXPUNGED] **Infection not contained.**\n\n**Resolution:** Reports from [DATA EXPUNGED] indicate no further outbreaks are believed likely, but Agents are advised to be on the lookout for new flareups resulting from uncontained civilians in previous outbreak regions; these may continue for years to come due to //P-047-A// sporulation. Investigation into the cause of the initial compromise is underway. Anyone with useful information may anonymously contact Security via the attached form.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Erku]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
