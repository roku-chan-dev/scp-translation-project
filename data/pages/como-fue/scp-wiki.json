You have a bowl of half-eaten rice clutched tightly in your hands.\n\nYou cannot bring yourself to look down at it. Every time you do, the bile threatens to rise back up to the surface and overwhelm you.\n\nYou do not remember how long it has been since the **SUN** changed, since Armageddon came to 99.999999% of the population and turned them into those… **THINGS**.\n\nYou and Ilse were separated by an entire country when it happened. Work was work, and you both knew that. But nevertheless, you kept in touch.\n\nA long distance relationship was still a relationship, and better than nothing.\n\nBut you wish you could have been at Site 43 with them, when it all went **RED RED RED**--\n\nYou cannot take it any more; the bile is up to your uvula. You drop the bowl onto the floor, not caring as it shatters into a million pieces, scattering rice and porcelain shards everywhere onto the tiling.\n\nYou just barely reach the bathroom and its toilet before it starts to come out. All that half-digested food and stress and panic and anxiety and fear ejected into the bowl as you shudder and heave and cry and cry and cry and\n\n**//jaaaaay…//**\n\nYou freeze, your forehead damp with sweat and your mouth caked with vomit.\n\nThat couldn’t…\n\nNo.\n\nNo no, you had to be just hearing things.\n\nA stress-induced hallucination.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, that was it.\n\nYou cough a few more times. It seems like it’s done now.\n\nYou stand, shakily, trying to ignore the rancid stench of the bile you just spewed as you flush it down and make your way to the mirror.\n\nYour gaze is more tired than usual, the bags underneath your eyes uncountable in both amounts and shades. Remnants of tear streaks run down your cheeks, glistening in the flickering fluorescent light.\n\nGrimacing as you look at your lips, you take a paper towel and wipe off the remaining chunks off, before throwing it into the bin nearby.\n\nYou sigh, and push the toilet lid away from you. It lands against the brim with a loud THUNK, which makes you wince.\n\nYou stand there, silent, the hairs standing up on your arms, waiting for some sort of reaction.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nNothing.\n\nYou breathe out a breath you did not even realize you were holding.\n\nYou slump down onto the toilet seat, suddenly feeling exhausted.\n\nYou simply… stare up at the ceiling for a few moments after that, not wanting to do anything. Not now, or ever again.\n\n…\n\nYour hand twitches by your side, reaching towards your left pocket.\n\nYou don’t want to do this.\n\nYou don’t want that knife to stab you in the gut once again.\n\nBut the phone is in your hand before can stop yourself.\n\nYou pull it up.\n\nYou tap out the pass code to unlock it.\n\nAnd you’re greeted with the same sight that greeted you just minutes ago.\n\nYour last messages with Ilse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"display: block; margin: auto; align: center; border: dashed 1px #444444; width: 50%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[>]]\nIlse <3\n//I’m taking a risk, Jay.

You know you did not hallucinate it that time.\n\nMixed among the voices of your neighbors, your civilian friends, your family…\n\nIt’s her, **BUT NOT**.\n\n**//please come out, jaaaaay…//**\n\n**//it’s so beautiful outside…//**\n\n**//i was wrong to try and stop the rays…//**\n\n**//i’ve learned so much…//**\n\nThe tears come out harder, and you shudder in your position as the THING THAT WAS ILSE continues talking, pleading for you to come out into the SUNSHINE…\n\nYou shut your eyes, begging whatever gods are still around that they’ll leave eventually.\n\nYou hear faint humming.\n\nYour blood turns to ice.\n\nIt gets louder.\n\nThere's no way for you to not recognize the tune.\n\nNo\n\nNo no no no no\n\nThis couldn’t be happening.\n\n“//Cómo Fue//”, by Benny Moré. The song you had sung to her that night.\n\nYou find yourself on your feet, shuffling towards the front door as **SHE** continues to hum.\n\nYou find yourself, almost reflexively, joining her.\n\nThe other voices join in as well.\n\nIt becomes a choir.\n\nYou feel fresh tears run down your face as you reach the crescendo.\n\nThe humming stops.\n\nSo does your heart, for a moment.\n\n**//come outside jay//**\n\n**//it’s okay//**\n\n**//we can be together//**\n\nYou shake your head, the tears still beading in your eyes. **THAT** is not **HER**.\n\n**IT** can’t be **HER**.\n\nBut your hand still reaches for the door handle.\n\nIt turns.\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
