LCD displays are to constantly stream reality TV programs, and triple-wide ventilation systems are to diffuse various perfumes in one-hour intervals.\n\n**Addendum-7097-1 (01-27-2023):** A minimum of 250,000 live female Drosophila specimens are to be contained near SCP-7097's cell.\n\n**Addendum-7097-2 (02-08-2023):** SCP-7097 is to be released from its cell one day per week. SCP-7097 has unlimited visitation privileges, and all questions regarding the entity are to be directed to Dr. Landstrom and Dr. Kelly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7097 is a sapient entity that inhabits female members of the Drosophila genus,[[footnote]]Commonly known as fruit flies.[[/footnote]] and has a strong proclivity for learning and/or sharing personal secrets.\n\nSCP-7097 will inhabit the nearest suitable Drosophila specimen after dying, with no noticeable change in personality or mannerisms. The entity is fully aware of this and may attempt breach-by-suicide if insufficiently entertained. If sufficiently entertained, SCP-7097 will become dormant and unresponsive.\n\nSCP-7097 has an innate sense for secrets, which testing determined is a form of anomalous olfactory detection. SCP-7097 often utilizes this sense during communication, and it has been known to make unsolicited remarks about Foundation staff and/or initiate games such as truth or dare.\n\n**Addendum-7097-1 (02-07-2023):** SCP-7097 is capable of recording and replaying video and audio from its compound eyes and antennae, respectively. Recordings produced by the entity achieve quality benchmarks far beyond any Foundation technology.\n _\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interaction Log Four\" hide=\"- Interaction Log Four\"]]\n _\n**Foreword:** Although SCP-7097 was recaptured, the entity attempted to evade capture by hiding in Dr. Landstrom's esophagus.

Why would you do that? You work for-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** My friends. I help out my friends, and those bastards were //not// my friends.\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza [muttering]:** I was wrong about you. I'm sorry.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Could you repeat that? //[smiling]// I couldn't //quite// hear you.\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza [gritted teeth]:** I'm sorry. That's the last time you'll hear it from me; don't forget you still caused this attack even if you did so unwittingly.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Do I get to spend some time outside my cell now?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** //[pauses]// I'll make a call...\n _\n[[/div]]\n _\n//After securing the facility Dr. Mendoza released Dr. Landstrom and Dr. Kelly from quarantine. She sent a request to Site Director Max Maxwell for revised containment procedures and reassignment from her current position as guardian of SCP-7097. The following was the reply://\n _\n> = **//Although I would normally advise against your suggestions, the unique circumstances with regards to SCP-7097 justify revised containment procedures. It makes no matter whether we imprison an entity or befriend it; so long as it is contained. I'm approving your request to allow SCP-7097 out of its cell one day per week, and I'll throw in unlimited visitation privileges since it prevented us from suffering a single casualty. With regards to your other request, I'm only signing off on it due to your history with SCP-████. Be careful Vera, this won't be anything like last time.**//\n> = //Site Director Max Maxwell//\n _\n//Dr. Mendoza gathered all Foundation staff assigned to SCP-7097 to announce her retirement from guarding the entity.//\n _\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n _\n\n= **[Video & Audio Log, 12:25 hours]**\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** As you well know, our facility recently suffered a severe attack from agents working for the Chaos Insurgency.\n _\n**Dr. Langmeyer:** Are we safe, or will they come back?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** We suspect they will not be returning any time soon. Thanks to Dr. Landstrom, we were able to develop a device that can intercept the enemy homing signals permanently, so long as SCP-7097 remains inside the facility perimeter. Furthermore, the... //actions// of SCP-7097 resulted in the enemy forces suffering devastating losses with no casualties among our staff. They lost badly, //[pauses]// and I doubt they will soon forget it.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Are we going to lose our jobs, what with the damage and all?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** On the contrary, you and Dr. Landstrom are being reassigned.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly [eyes downcast]:** Oh, I guess I should've expected that.\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** You're being assigned to SCP-7097 research and containment. //[pauses]// My old job.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //Your// job? You mean to tell me they fired-\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** No, Mike, I wasn't //fired.// I chose to leave.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Why? Where will you go?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** Although we re-contained over thirty-five escaped prisoners and entities, one was able to get away during the chaos of the attack. He has abilities that represent a grave danger to the Foundation, and to society at large.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //The hypnotist.//\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** I have experience dealing with SCP-████, so I'm joining an MTF squad tasked with hunting him down.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** But he got you this time, didn't he? What if that happens again?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza:** He may have caught me by surprise today, but I've beaten him before and I'll do it again.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Before? You fought //the hypnotist// in the past?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza [smiling]:** Why do you think he's missing an eye?\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interaction Log Six\" hide=\"- Interaction Log Six\"]]\n _\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n _\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Landstrom\n _\n**Interviewee:** SCP-7097\n _\n**Foreword:** Dr. Landstrom inquires about the entity’s video evidence of prior events.\n _\n\n= **[Begin Written Transcript]**\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom and SCP-7097 are silent for several seconds.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** ...‘Fresh flesh and tender brains?’\n _\n**SCP-7097 [blushing]:** I was ad-libbing, alright? It's not like that hypno-freak would've let Vera go if I asked him nicely, would he?\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom laughs.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Listen Cassidy, we got a request from Director Maxwell, and-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** --That bald freak? What the fuck does //he// want?--\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [whispering]:** //Shut up!// That's my boss you're talking about, and he //reads// these transcripts!\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Fine, whatever. What does //his waxiness// need our help with?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //[sighs]// You see, during the attack our CCTV wasn't working.

Do you have any idea how high my video and audio quality //is?// I heard your fellow eggheads spent years trying to replicate that hypno-freak's powers with thousand-dollar stereo mixers, and I did it on my first try with just these antennae!\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Alright, no need to get a swelled head Cass- wait, how did you find out about that?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** What part of //gossip fly// don't you understand, Mike?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** ...Touché. At any rate, it’s pretty important that we have a timeline of events during the attack. We need your help.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Sheesh, alright. Fair warning though, it’s gonna cost you.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Whatever you need we can provide. Dr. Kelly and I have executive decision-making privileges when it comes to your care, now that Dr. Mendoza left.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** That’s all well and good, but you didn’t seem to understand what I said.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I beg your pardon?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** It’s gonna cost you. //Personally.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I… what?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Let me put it another way. If you want my tapes, //Mike,// you’ll need to earn them first.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom blinks incredulously.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** ...Ok? What exactly do you want me to do?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oh, that’s easy! All you’ve gotta do is play a simple game with me.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Which game?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Truth or Dare!\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Oh, God no...\n _\n**SCP-7097:** //Come on,// it’s not like you’re gonna die from one little game of Truth or Dare.

I got it from the lab where I was made. Those eggheads had an acronym they used as a shorthand. I guess people got tired of calling me “the entity” all the time.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** What was it?\n _\n//SCP-7097 flexes its antennae. A recording of a male voice says “And this is the __Counterspying Anomalistic Sapient Silent Identifying Drosophila Entity!__ But you can just call her Cassidy for short.”//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Hmmm, some of those terms are kind of a reach. And-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** And they used an “e” instead of a “y” to make the acronym fit, I know. It doesn’t really matter what those eggheads were trying to say. Cassidy wasn’t some stupid nerd-speak term to me, it was my //name.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** And you never thought about changing it? Even after all this time?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Not a chance. It helps remind me of how far I've come.\n _\n//SCP-7097 attempts to wink with its compound eye.//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Not to mention the fact that Cassidy’s a pretty awesome name.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Well, I’m glad to hear you like it.

Now it’s //your// turn.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [blushing]:** //lover boy?//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oh, and no pressure or anything, but if you choose truth I’ll definitely make you tell me all the other //juicy// classified secrets about that hypno-freak.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You know I can't. For God's sake, I'd be fired on the spot!\n _\n//SCP-7097 giggles.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I choose dare.\n _\n//SCP-7097 laughs.//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike…\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** What?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Don’t you know how to spot a trap when it’s right in front of your //face?//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Trap? What do you-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** You know that one place that serves [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2253|protoplasmic booze]]] near Site-77?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You mean Sandy's Cocktail Parlor?\n _\n**Cassidy:** Gee, really original naming there. And yeah, that place. It's //Grace's favorite.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** What does that have to do with-\n _\n//SCP-7097 giggles even more.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Oh... //no...//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oh //yes.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I //can't!// You //know// I can't!\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Are you gonna chicken out //now?// Because if you do that, I'll tell Grace what you were about to say to her back in that cell.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** How would you-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** I was outside the door, genius, and I've got enough brain cells to connect the dots. Not to mention Gerald told me about the flowers addressed to Grace that //someone// threw in the dumpster.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom cringes.//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** You //like// her. Even an idiot could figure out your little secret, and when it comes to secrets, I'm Albert fucking Einstein.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom's head is in his hands.//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** And here's another newsflash: she likes //you.//\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom’s head jerks up.//\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oh, don’t act so surprised. It’s obvious if you just pay attention. She likes your weird jokes. She likes your weird way of talking. And she even likes your billion-page nerd book about bugs. Honestly, it’s crazy how the both of you are so weird in the same ways. Sometimes I think //you two// should be the anomaly, instead of my perfectly normal self.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You mean that?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** What, the liking you or the thing about you being weird?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //[glares]// The first part.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Valentine’s Day is coming up soon. Take some initiative Casanova, and find out for yourself.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** But I wouldn’t even know what to say!\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Remember that one time in the cafeteria?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** That disaster?\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Not how I remember it, but ok. Anyways, you just let me handle the wordplay. It’s my specialty after all. All you've got to do is show up and look pretty.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Well, I suppose I can-\n _\n**SCP-7097:** And for God’s sake, wash that lab coat every once in a while.

After your date with Grace.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom sighs.//\n[[/div]]\n _\n**Closing Statement:** SCP-7097 handed over recorded logs one week after Dr. Landstrom's date with Dr. Kelly. Shortly afterward, Dr. Kelly sent a message to Site Director Max Maxwell. The following was his reply:\n _\n> = **//Thank you for your message, and congratulations on being promoted to co-head of research into SCP-7097. To your question, there isn't a strict ban on relationships between Foundation staff. Were we to try and enforce such a policy, we would quickly lose many of our best and brightest agents! That being said, the Foundation does advise caution in delicate matters such as these. Use your best judgment, Grace. As for your request to take a joint leave of absence on February 14th, I'll put it through the standard review protocol and let you know in about a week.//**\n> = //Site Director Max Maxwell//\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n> **Addendum:** **Request approved.**\n _\n[[/collapsible]]\n _",
