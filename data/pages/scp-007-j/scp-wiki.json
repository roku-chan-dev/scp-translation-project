Recon Team Theta is awaiting authorization to sweep the premises. In the meantime, all staff are advised not to engage SCP-007-J due to its unknown nature.\n\n**Description:** SCP-007-J is a blueberry muffin which belonged to Foundation Officer Evan, prior to the discovery of its anomalous nature and its subsequent designation as an SCP.\n\nSCP-007-J was identified during Officers Blake and Evan's assigned lunch hour on ██/██/████. The anomaly occurred during a phone call Officer Evan received, which required him to leave the room. Whilst unobserved by Officer Blake, SCP-007-J, which Officer Evan had left unattended on his desk (planning to consume it after his phone call, believing it to be an ordinary muffin), disappeared by unknown means, leaving only a residue of unknown properties on Officer Blake's lips.\n\nThe transcript of the exchange which led to SCP-007-J's discovery is recorded below.\n\n> **Officer Evan:** (Entering the door, having concluded his phone call.) “Hey man... Oh... dude, where the hell is my muffin?”\n> \n> **Officer Blake:** “What?”\n> \n> **Officer Evan:** “No! We have been over the ethics of food stealing! You do not steal another man's pastries!”\n> \n> **Officer Blake:** “I swear to god I don't know what you're talking about.”\n> \n> **Officer Evan:** “So my muffin just walked out of here on its own, did it?”\n> \n> **Officer Blake:** “Well... I don't know... Stranger things have happened! I mean, you can believe in a concrete Weeping Angel or an indestructible, homicidal crocodile, but not a sentient muffin? Wait... do you think that's what we're dealing with here?”\n> \n> **Officer Evan:** “No, I think you've eaten it. You've still got crumbs on your face, for fuck's sake!”\n> \n> **Officer Blake:** (Grasping mouth area in panic.) “Oh shit! It's left its residue on me! Grab me an SCP form, I'm gonna run to the med bay and get myself checked out!”\n> \n> **Officer Evan:** “You're an idiot.”\n>\n\nThe residue left on Officer Blake's lips was identified as crumbs from SCP-007-J. It is currently unknown how or why SCP-007-J left its mark upon Officer Blake, but medical analysis has revealed no long term effects. As a precaution, Officer Blake is to spend three (3) days in quarantine. \n\nAdditionally, to prevent other on-site pastries from animating as a result of exposure to SCP-007-J, or the Foundation itself (as may be SCP-007-J's origin) the cafeteria is to be kept under armed guard until SCP-007-J is secured.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
