As such, a Foundation agent has assumed the identity of PoI-8991-A and publicly acknowledged the following cover stories:\n\n* SCP-8991 was an entirely fictional work of transgressive art.\n* The legal ramifications of SCP-8991's unauthorized interruptions of regular broadcasts were handled with multiple out-of-court settlements.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8991 was a series of eight analog television broadcasts between 1/22/1994 and 3/12/1994. Broadcasts occurred exclusively within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The signal's origin point was triangulated to an empty parking lot. Cable and digital television were not affected.\n\nDuring SCP-8991 transmissions, several[[footnote]]Some owners of analog receivers closer to the origin point noted that every channel had been affected. PBS was the channel most often reported to be effected.[[/footnote]] channels at random were overridden. The first seven broadcasts occurred on Fridays from 7:00-7:30 AM CST. The final broadcast on 3/12/1994 took place from 11:07-11:42 PM CST.\n\nEach transmission contained an episode of \"Make It Count!\", a live-action show aimed toward preschoolers. According to the credits, the human cast is composed of unnamed \"Members of the Double Bacon Pittsburger Improv Collective.\" The only named person in the credits is Simon Goldy, the showrunner, director, composer, chief animator, puppetteer, and voice actor for \"Busy Bobby Busybody\" -- a fast-talking beaver puppet with a stopwatch who acts as the host and central character. \n\nEpisodes were interspersed with updates from the Emergency Alert System, commercials for survival shelters and suicide pills, and public service announcements relating to religion, grief, and acceptance.\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Excerpt from the transcript of SCP-8991-1\" hide=\"- Encryption key accepted.\"]]\n\n> //(Brief animated intro featuring Busy Bobby playing the banjo in a bluegrass band.

Great use of warm colors there, buddy! //Cool, next!//\n> \n> **Soup:** Great, I've been waiting for this! I used to be an illustration major before joining this show.

The youngest member of five children is usually shown with a Kermit the Frog plush toy. Jim Croce's// Workin' at the Car Wash Blues //plays in the background.)//\n> \n> **Busy Bobby:** Hi, y'all! Today, we're gonna learn about an extra-special pioneer of daytime TV. \n> \n> Mr. Simon Michael Goldy was born on August 12th, 1970, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Even as the youngest of four siblings, Simon's creativity quickly overshadowed his abusive brothers. He displayed signs of extreme brilliance from as early as nine months old, when he said his first word: \"carpet.\" Carpet! While every other putz was goin' \"mama\" or \"dada\" or \"ball\" or some entry-level garbage like that, Li'l Simon went for a completely abstract concept right off the bat. Years ahead of his time, as usual.\n> \n> //(Cut to a series of yearbook photos, most of them from a high school AV club.)//\n> \n> There's nothin' that Simon loved in this world more than the Muppets. In fact, from the moment Simon first set eyes on a certain \"the Frog,\" he knew -- he just //knew!// -- that the name \"Goldy\" was destined to stand next to \"Henson\" and \"Disney\" as a revolutionary -- as the very //soul// of the collective imagination of their generation's children.\n> \n> //(Cut to a series of concept art of Busy Bobby, along with other beavers seen in the theme song.)//\n> \n> And once Simon graduated CalArts, he moved back to Pittsburgh to lay down the roots of his own multimedia empire. The children's entertainment revolution //would// be televised, and the revolution's figurehead was none other than Busy Bobby Busybody the Beaver. In fact, in the fall of 1992, all of Busybody Creek was set to take PBS by storm, with such unforgettable characters as Lazy Betty, Bertie Baddie, Chompy Chewy, and Stuart the Horrible Muskrat, ready to grab the eyeballs of impressionable children worldwide in their gentle, beavery fists, and //squeeze!//\n> \n> Alas, even though Simon's destiny was set in stone, life wasn't listening. Because on November 11th, 1993, he bagged his first internship with his local PBS station. But the very next day...\n> \n> //(A slow, minor-key arrangement of the Muppet Show theme song plays on piano.)//\n> \n> //(Cut to recorded news footage of twelve approx. 250-meter-long cnidarian entities floating over the smoldering ruins of Ho Chi Minh City. A marquee on the bottom: \"U.N. ESTIMATES DEATH TOLL FROM 'FIRST WAILING' AT 1.4 BILLION\")//\n> \n> //(Cut to photocopied newspaper headlines -- \"YELTSIN ACCUSED OF COLLABORATING WITH LAGRANGIAN POINT ENTITY\" -- \"MILLIONS DEAD IN GRAVITATIONAL DISRUPTIONS IN ARGENTINA\" -- \"NASA ESCAPE ARK RAISES ADMISSION PRICE TO $150 BILLION, CITING LIMITED RESOURCES\" -- \"VATICAN ISSUES 'GLOBAL INDULGENCES' FOR SINS AFTER SECOND WAILING DATE CONFIRMED\")//\n> \n> November 12th, 1993. The First Wailing. In just a few hours of violence and suffering, Simon Goldy was the only person in the world who still cared about beaver puppets. It seemed that the once and future great master of Busybody Creek was condemned to be forgotten with the rest.\n> \n> Only Busy Bobby was ready for camera; the other puppets hadn't even been created. The show itself hadn't even been pitched to PBS yet.\n> \n> So Simon thought to himself: \"How am I going to win the hearts of millions of terrified children in the span of only three months?\"\n> \n> But the answer came in the form of the question he should have been asking the whole time: //\"What do the hearts of millions of terrified children owe me?\"//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Excerpt from the transcript of SCP-8991-6\" hide=\"- Encryption key accepted.\"]]\n> //(The studio chamber is the same, but the ceiling has collapsed.

Now, I couldn't help but notice: the ratings for the show have been... less than ideal. But I don't blame you, kids! I don't got time to blame anyone, because we gotta //Make It Count,// am I right? \n> \n> On today's episode, you might notice that we're not gonna learn or do much to speak of, we're mostly just gonna... chill! Y'know, hang out! Because I've done more than enough nice things for you, so it's high time you returned the favor. This busy beaver went out of his way to make time for you in his busy schedule! \n> \n> Now, I know you're thinkin' of turning the TV off or changin' the channel. Maybe you noticed that this was on a different channel you were originally going to watch instead of mine. ...I'm not mad or anything.

Something great. Extra-special. Super-duper. Here goes: you have one more thing to do. The final thing you'll ever do. And it's the most important -- everything in your life has led up to this point, so //Make. It. Count.//\n> \n> All you gotta do... is look at me.\n> \n> Keep looking at me.\n> \n> I know it's hard, and you wanna be with your mommies and daddies right now, while you're still alive. But I promise, you can be with them //after// everything goes white! You can be with them forever! You'll never have to look at me //ever again!//\n> \n> ...\n> \n> You know, I can't help but feel like nobody's taking this seriously. You don't //have// to go to Heaven, y'know. Because once I get there, I'll tell God the names of every bad little girl and boy who didn't pay Busy Bobby back for all the work he put into making a nice little show for them. And God's gonna drag every last one into the depths of Hell, where big, red devils will rip your skin off, break all your toys, light you on fire, break your fingers, give you shots and blood tests, abolish candy, eat you, give you cooties, make you eat your own poop, and never say please and thank you about any of it! \n> \n> This doesn't make sense to you, does it?\n> \n> Me fucking neither, kiddies. \n> \n> Don't blame me. It's not my fault that the future promised for me was stolen for no reason. And I swear, if one more person tells me I'm not the only one who's hurt and angry about the Second Wailing -- //well, are they a fucking GENIUS?!// \n> \n> ...\n> \n> This isn't the end. The measures I've taken to spread these broadcasts beyond Pittsburgh's borders -- into other worlds -- look, it's hard to explain, but I don't think I'm human at this point. I haven't eaten or drank anything in two weeks, and I'm not hungry. I'm only //angry.//\n> \n> Angry at the Lagrangain Point Entity. Angry at everyone who told me to give up. Angry that I need to give up.\n> \n> //(Holding back tears.)//\n> \n> But most of all, angry at //you.//\n> \n> Because I've given every one of you nothing but love. I haven't made a dime off this show. And //NOBODY// has mailed in any fan art of Busy Bobby! Not even shitty little crayon drawings!
