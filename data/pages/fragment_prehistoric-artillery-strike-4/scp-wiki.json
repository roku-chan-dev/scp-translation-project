I don't know what this means and I don't want to mess this up so I'll say it's contained. That's fine, right?//\n\n**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.\n\nSCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power. Additionally, SCP-3939 possesses the ability to speak with a voice transmitted through the horn and potential sapience. Thus far it has only been shown to speak to certain people.\n\nThe brass horn always rotates to point at the observer. Other observers will see the horn rotate to point towards them. \n\n//Tests to ensure a trilobite free environment are underway!//\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\n\"Do you work for anyone?\"\n\n\"Yes, the Supreme Cephalon-headed-tri-lober Punishers. They don't let me do much but they are very nice and they say they kill lots of trilobites so they're cool.\"\n\nOf-fucking-course this is a Foundation thing.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prehistoric-artillery-strike/offset/7 How are you going to check for trilobites?]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prehistoric-artillery-strike/offset/8 Do I have anything to do with this?]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
