This place seems peculiar. Why not take a look at what this place contains?\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP ART]]\n-----\n= A room of paintings\n= Both void and full of life\n= They twist and turn\n= They whisper small hymns\n= You stare and they rest\n= You remember their names\n-----\n[[[art:princess-arthur-doodle|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI drew this in like an hour. I had just finished reading SCP-8307 so I felt like drawing something based off it. I ended up drawing the gal herself MAGICAL GIRL ARTHUR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:fisher-queen-doodle|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nAfter drawing that SCP-8307 piece I felt like I should draw one for it's sudo-sequel SCP-8191. It ended up looking a lot more like a poster than I thought it would. I think it looks really good. My highest rated artwork btw.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab TALE ART]]\n-----\n= You enter an observatory\n= Empty aside from a desk\n= The desk is covered in clipboards and papers\n= You pick up a picture frame\n= It tells a story\n= It tells a memory\n-----\n[[[art:site-director-heather|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nForgotten memories is probably my favourite canon so I was inevitably going to draw a piece based off it, eventually. So here's the first one.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:let-there-be-a-doodle|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI drew the other two stories, so I might as well complete the set. This took a bit because my computer crashed while looking for the references.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:masks-of-doodlelathotep|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThe Public Domain Contest was incredible. Every team did such a good job, but if I had to pick a favourite team... It would be The Magical Girl Arthur team. But if I had to choose a second favourite, it would be the Nyarlathotep team.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab GOI ART]]\n-----\n= You rummage through the crate\n= Between frames and folders\n= Between pens and discs\n= You find a smaller box\n= You open it\n= They stare back\n-----\n[[[art:shark-punching-propaganda|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI love the SPC. They are probably the funniest Group Of Interest in my opinion. I kinda just had this epiphany and dew this poster.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:nobody-draws-at-dawn|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis is the only category I could think to put it into. I loved reading the series and thought I'd draw some appreciation art.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab COMICS]]\n-----\n= You take a book off the shelf\n= The words meld and morph\n= They change colour and shape\n= They merge into images\n= They act out a story\n= They act out a life\n-----\nThere'll be stuff here. Eventually\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab MISCELLANEOUS]]\n-----\n= The dark room is full\n= Piles and piles of random junk\n= You pull a tome from the ground\n= It glows bright green\n= You look inside\n= You recognise the contents\n-----\nThe hub you are currently on.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\nOriginally I was going to have this page be narrated by a character I made called \"Dr Gabriel Ark\" (I'll write a tale about him eventually, just gotta do a lot more brainstorming) but then I thought of this kinda poetry idea. And well you can clearly see how that ended up.\nUPDATE 17/03/2025: I decided to add a drawn poster to add some flare. The character on it was kinda made up while I drew it. So they have no backstory... yet...\nUPDATE 15/04/2025: Added a second poster. The character on it is my interpretation of The Administrator\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:arsene-lupin-vs-the-doodle-foundation|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nTeam \"TEAM FORTRESS 2\" ([[*user Calibold]], [[*user HarryBlank]] and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]) made the series \"Arsene Lupin vs The SCP Foundation\" for Public Domain Con 2025. I loved it so much that when I finished reading it, I drew this poster.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:alex-thorley-is-on-a-poster|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"-  Alex Thorley is not here\"]]\nYou walk through the wind and shut the door behind you.\nLooking down, you see yourself.\nYou do not recognise yourself.\nYou look hand-drawn.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[[art:one-should-take-breaks|]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Artist commentary\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nI was thinking about the idea I had for a series of articles and thought, \"Why not draw the focal point/main character\", and here he is.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SMALL DOODLES]]\n-----\n= You enter the office\n= It's full of piles upon piles of papers\n= You pull some off the top\n= Most of the paper is blank\n= Aside from some small images\n= They glare at you\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Dr Draws\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[image Dinodraws.jpg]]\nI love Fir design. Original character created by: [[*user Dino--draws]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Dr Blank\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\n[[image HARRY.jpg]]\nI drew this on the same sheet as the Dr Draws image. You know who this is... it's [[*user HarryBlank]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\nWas that all? You were quite the curious type. But you know what they say about curiosity...\n-----\n[[image Poster2.jpg]]\n-----\n\n= Upon a collected mirage\n= The hallway ends\n= Intertwined with the lights\n= The exit dings\n= You stare in horror\n= You breath with haste\n= A claw reaches out\n= You can't run forever",
