I hope you enjoy it <3 \n> If you like this, you should check out my [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost Author Page].

Her dress is gold, like the city of Amoni-Ram, and her crown and the gears glow brightest, showing how her personhood as been outshone by her purpose. The red around her represents the crossing of boundaries, where she's been disrespected and stripped of her agency. I tried to really capture the feel of the piece, showing her trapped without specifically drawing or picturing the abuse she's enduring. I hope it worked.\n\n[[/=]]",
