Usage of the item to recall memories lost through both anomalous and non-anomalous means has a 94% success rate.||\n||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Initial Report||\n||~ Author || Bruce Schulman Jr. ||~ Date || January 15, 2014||\n||~ Interest|| Medium ||~ Identifier||Schulman-NY Programmable Mnestic Device||\n|||||||| Faced with the challenge of countering the effects of amnesticization -- be it via the Foundation and Global Occult Coalition's non-anomalous chemical amnestics, or anomalous memory-affecting hazards -- I developed a device which is capable of altering memory recall, and even reversing memory expungement entirely.||\n|||||||| Marketing Note: It is also useful in recalling social events and meeting minutes in a format that other attendees will not have access to.||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||~ Inventory Information||\n||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Owner ||~ Quantity ||~ Comments||\n|| Marshall, Carter and Dark LLP || 210 items || Limited number available from supplier. ||\n|| The Foundation || 8 items || One item purchased under false customer pretenses by undercover operative. Seven items stolen from warehouse in North Carolina. All items are most likely being used or stored at Site-42 as of July 15, 2015. ||\n|| Customers || 394 items || 394 individuals have purchased this item. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 01||\n||||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Bruce Schulman Jr. ||\n|||||||| After an unrelated run-in with a few Foundation operatives in North Carolina, a member of the sales team for an anomalous item was briefly captured and released following amnesticization. With assistance, this individual programmed your device to the specific date and time of the capture, entered information regarding the details of the item forgotten, and was successfully able to recall that which had been removed through the use of Class-A aerosol amnestics. Because of this, a description of the item lost to Foundation possession was circulated throughout the company, and agents were able to reacquire it within 30 days. _\n _\nMy only concern is that the device requires somewhat detailed text input in order to access memories properly. If a user does not have at least a small amount of detailed information on that which they intend to recall, the device is not accessible. I recognize that this is quite the hurdle to overcome, but it's worth noting. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Incident Report 01||\n||||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Author || Bruce Schulman Jr. ||~ Date || July 15, 2015||\n|||||||| We've seen a noticeable decline in sales this month and the last, and we're not looking good now that we're halfway through the month. Maybe that's why I wasn't smart enough to pick up on the \"private anomalous institution\" researcher picking up one of these, but when she showed me images and video of her laboratory and citations of papers she'd published under that name, she seemed legitimate. To my dismay, my security officer cross-referenced our office's security feeds with our limited database of Foundation personnel files, ran it through the facial recognition software, and found that she's actually a Foundation researcher at Site-42 in North Carolina. One device missing isn't worth an organized raid on one of the most fortified sites out there, since they've no doubt had enough time by this point to break it down and analyze it, but it's worth noting that the Foundation is probably going to start reverse-engineering my device, and whatever they make out of it will no doubt be a threat.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||~ Sale Records||\n||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Records From:||||January 2014 to April 2018 ||\n||~ Month ||~ Sold ||~ Comments||\n|| January 2014 || 23 || Initial sales, six of which were from exclusive pre-orders. ||\n|| February 2014 || 12 || Sales dwindle after initial popularity among target demographics. ||\n|| March 2014 || 13 || Similar popularity for several months. ||\n|| Q2 2014 || 31 || For the purposes of condensing the chart, a switch to quarterly sales numbers is begun here. ||\n|| Q3 2014 || 36 || ||\n|| Q4 2014 || 38 || ||\n|| Q1 2015 || 39 || An error traced to marketing caused information about the device to be missing from 2015 promotional materials. ||\n|| Q2 2015 || 28 || Noticeable decline in demand.

We need to figure out large-scale marketing sooner rather than later, or we're going to miss the business opportunity this presents. ||\n|| 12:57 || Amos Marshall || very worried about that Bruce. Foundation is watching these events closely ||\n|| 12:57 || Amos Marshall || I understand where you are coming from though. ||\n|| 12:57 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || The individual or organization orchestrating this is clearly in a hurry to wrap things up. The reports I've read show that the memory loss events are occurring almost 85 percent more frequently than they originally did. There's an exponential increase. ||\n|| 12:58 || Amos Marshall || I know you want to make some sales but wait until the public finds out on their own ||\n|| 12:58 || Amos Marshall || once that happens we will step in. ||\n|| 12:58 || Amos Marshall || I know how much work you put into this device's development. You will see the increase in demand you deserve. Just give it time. ||\n|| 12:58 || Amos Marshall || Once the events reach a critical point of frequency, the internet will reflect it. Once the net is exploding with people from affected locations showing the world what they've forgotten, we'll swoop in with online sales and save the day ||\n|| 12:59 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Okay. But we have to do this before the Foundation does it. ||\n|| 12:59 || Amos Marshall || you expect the Foundation to manufacture your device and use it to their advantage ||\n|| 12:59 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Fully. ||\n|| 13:00 || Amos Marshall || while it is wise of you to expect a threat from them after all that we have seen of their scientific and technological capabilities, I think you may be overestimating them in this case ||\n|| 13:01 || Amos Marshall || they are not in the business of helping people remember ||\n|| 13:01 || Amos Marshall || they are in the business of making people forget ||\n|| 13:01 || Amos Marshall || always have been ||\n|| 13:01 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || I don't think they're going to use mnestic devices on the public. I think they're going to arm their own employees with mnestic devices, let the memory wipe events get more and more frequent until a map of them shows the world covered, and then build humanity back exactly the way they want them, only bringing back the memories of the parts of the world they find convenient and nothing else. ||\n|| 13:02 || Amos Marshall || I will relay your concerns to the appropriate parties ||\n|| 13:02 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || If they develop the capacity to erase //and// construct memories, they'll go public. They won't have a reason not to. They'll create a new rendition of humanity programmed to be unquestioningly compliant with their enforcement of normality. Not only will we be forcibly shut down, the world as we know it will have ceased to exist. ||\n|| 13:02 || Amos Marshall || slow down, the world is not going to end ||\n|| 13:02 || Amos Marshall || this is preventable if you investigate the origin and take advantage of your device's popularity when it spikes ||\n|| 13:03 || Amos Marshall || which will be soon. Clearly. ||\n|| 13:03 || Amos Marshall || in the meantime if you want to look further into the origin of these events, I would consider it beneficial to the company ||\n|| 13:03 || Amos Marshall || I have high hopes for your sales future despite these slow few years ||\n|| 13:04 || Amos Marshall || we are approaching the precipice of your device's perceived usefulness and all demographics across the board will find it necessary to purchase ||\n|| 13:04 || Amos Marshall || let the information security department deal with the Foundation. ||\n|| 13:04 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || As you wish. ||\n|| 13:04 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || If you need anything else from me, let me know. I'll start assembling the information I've found. ||\n|| 13:05 || Amos Marshall || okay thank you for the information, I will relay it to the others and we will discuss internally ||\n|| 13:05 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || Alright. ||\n|| 13:05 || Bruce Schulman Jr. || **DISCONNECTED** ||\n||||||||~ Log end. ||\n\n------\n\n||~ Situation Report 01-LETHE||\n||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||I am composing this attachment to disclose and deconstruct the source of an anomalous phenomenon which is on the precipice of offering my branch the best business opportunity it has ever seen. A series of events, being referred to in [[[scp-3848|Foundation documentation]]] as LETHE EVENTS, is slowly overtaking the world and causing humanity to collectively forget -- in small batches limited to cities and counties and states -- pieces of human knowledge. _\n _\nSo far it looks random, but the Foundation is having a more and more difficult time hiding how the Internet reacts to these events. People failing to recognize very familiar things and then posting pictures of them with panicked captions on social media is quickly becoming common, and even the skippers are having a difficult time covering up the occurrences at this point. These events are striking within very specific geopolitical boundaries, to a degree that makes the events appear almost automated, as if someone is choosing to target one city exactly within limits, or one state exactly within borders. _\n _\nA few weeks ago, Foundation operatives raided one of our greater eastern branch's warehouses down in coastal NC. Took seven of the devices, as well as a shipment of [[[scp-3484|antique books]]] I was looking forward to perusing. In the pandemonium, mnestic compounds contaminated them. They're probably worthless now, the philistines. They already had one of the devices from an undercover sale, but the fact that they found it necessary to take even more of them can't mean anything good. I've communicated explicitly to Marshall my concern regarding the reverse-engineering that is bound to be taking place within Site-42 right now; I have no doubt that the Foundation intends to take my technology and use it to turn human subjects into obedient drones with no capacity for personal identity or memory. Of course, they're not low enough to do something that extreme to all of humanity, but they'll use the worst version of whatever they create on their test subjects and then use a dulled-down version to make the public compliant after these waves of Lethe Events wipe out most of collective human memory piece-by-piece. ||\n||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 48||\n||||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Lucas Monaco ||\n||||||||It has come to my attention that the merchandise has once again failed to be included in our catalogs. How do you expect to be able to sell the product if no one is given any knowledge about it? The most recent situation report means we may be seeing a huge breakthrough in sales for this product, and we need to be properly positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. I expect a full report from marketing regarding this situation by tomorrow. Do not screw this up for us.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||~ Situation Report 02-LETHE||\n||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||I am thankful I had the forethought to program my device for the techniques in the German book. I continue to remember the material well enough to continue my neural harvest. It's ironic that the mnestic compounds can be synthesized from cerebral matter that has been all but forgotten. It appears the postorbital lobe was one of the first casualties of these LETHE EVENTS, but that only means it can be extracted from the populace and people don't notice. Furthermore, since the body's immune system doesn't cross into the brain, the lobes can all be linked into a single organism. _\n _\nNeurons express so many different compounds, it's child's play to harvest whatever MC&D needs from this source. In addition to the mnestic devices, we can use the organism's products for [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/osteotronic-cubes-vxy33-f7rq3-9xad1 osteotronic cubes]. I am positive there will be future products we can extract, with everything safely stored at a secure extradimensional location. _\n _\nThe organism is proving to be the perfect cash cow. I'm assuaged that it's not like there's any personality to be concerned with, either. There's not enough of any one person present for it to be anybody. ||\n||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 49||\n||||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Sender || Lucas Monaco ||~ Recipient || Amos Marshall ||\n||||||||There is no record of this product in our systems. Wasn't this removed from our catalog long ago? No one here knows what this product is. In the meantime, we still need to make space for some new products in our Wilmington warehouse. Bruce says that he has a new source of neural matter for the osteocubes. There's extra biochemical and electronic components we could break down and recycle into more product.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 50||\n||||||||~ AC34D/NC77Q/95DCS ||\n||~ Sender || Amos Marshall ||~ Recipient || Lucas Monaco ||\n||||||||Go for it.
