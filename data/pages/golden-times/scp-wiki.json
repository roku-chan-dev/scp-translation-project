Brother Fredrick, can you hear me?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nAn apparatus to withstand time, made to last.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nGold, eternal.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nAqua Regia, to purify the substance.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"foundation\"]]\nSCP-████ is a single gold bar weighing approximately 14 kilograms.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nTo forsake all agency in the name of outlasting death itself. Well, not all agency, as I shall still be able to speak.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nBy force, I shall take the Kingdom of God and live forever!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nCan such a body support a soul?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"foundation\"]]\nHowever, under An-Ima analysis, SCP-████ displays signatures consistent with those found in living humans.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nIt speaks in tongues!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nNo! It is possessed!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"foundation\"]]\nSCP-████, was transferred to Foundation precursor Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal (HMFSCP) from the Church of England in 1847. It is believed to date back to the 16^^th^^ century.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nIt is said that God created time alongside the world.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nShattered perception.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"foundation\"]]\nA single note was included with SCP-████, which described the actions of one Fredrick Weller in SCP-████'s creation.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nHis actions denounce his neglect of Our Savior's words, chiefly that He is the Life. The wicked artifact, affected by malevolent forces, has since been destroyed and reduced to bare metal.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nNature tends to states of least free energy, does it not? Or do we only perceive this as such due to how our bodies work, and by extension how our perception works? The mind is biochemical, our internal clocks are dictated by thermodynamics, and our arrow of time points in the direction of increasing entropy. What if that weren't the case? Could there be a vessel for the soul in which, unlike in the human body, it could perceive time in any direction it desires? This is what I will achieve with my work.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nIn here are the remains of the contraption in which our late brother Fredrick Weller seated his soul. As the golden calf of Aaron, the precious metal was wrought by our brother into an idol, through which he sought to gain life eternal.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nPlay, pause, rewind.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nNot bound to the direction of increasing microstates, but to whichever direction I please.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nHeresy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nOccultism.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nMysteries I dare not and could not replicate.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nHaving chosen sin unto death, we pray not for our brother Fredrick. We shall not judge, for there is one judge and arbiter, Jesus Christ. We put evil away from among us, however, and melt his works with cleansing fire. Amen.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nThe machine, it screamed as it melted.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nWhat then? What now?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"foundation\"]]\nSCP-████ is to be stored in the steel chest from which it was obtained. This chest is to be kept in a secure locker in Site-72.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nThe anguish of a life forced to walk downhill, further and further into decay. The anguish of a life of nothing new, be it through repetition or exhaustion, where either way there is nothing left to live. I want neither. I want eternal life.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nA cost to be set free from the numbered days of man and into the countless instants beyond time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nA single bullion, locked in a box, held in a remote, restricted chamber within the Earth. A note describing the sins of our brother Fredrick, admonishing him.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nTo cleave the soul, spirit and body, and mend them again.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nHe is dead.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"church\"]]\nBut what about his work?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nFrom the nuclear decay, which man has not yet seen, of each and every ^^197^^Au atom that had once been united as this device, to the third day, when the waters under heaven were gathered, and Earth was named.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"fred\"]]\nI have been there. I am there. I will be there.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
