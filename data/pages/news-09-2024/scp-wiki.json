All entries except the winning entry were deleted. The winner of this contest was Croquembouche, with Site-69! We interviewed him for some of his thoughts on his article and the contest.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**1) What were some of your inspirations for your article?**\n\nThe biggest inspiration plotwise was an SCP that's already on-site that I've always wanted to write about, but never had the right chance to. I wanted Site-69 to contain either it or something //like// it, and that informed the direction of almost everything at the start of the story, from the events that take place to variations in how different characters behave to Site-69's location. I'd love to share which SCP I had in mind, but it's funnier if I don't, so I'm not going to.\n\nDropping new content at a regular pace was inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(xkcd) 'Time' by xkcd], which was a 3000+ frame comic released every half hour for four months. (Not claiming that Site-69 came anywhere near that in scope, of course.)\n\nSome readers called out The Thing, and while I haven't seen it myself, I have to assume that having consumed media made by people who //were// directly inspired by it led to at least some brain process happening. I can't think why else I would instinctively want to make the setting so cold.\n\n**2) What was the reasoning behind releasing it piecemeal, instead of all at once?**\n\nGoing into Wrathcon and committing to the likelihood of my work being deleted, I felt that submitting something static wasn't going to do justice to the premise. I wanted my work to benefit from being ephemeral rather than be constrained by it, so why not make it an event? Giving it a time-based component felt like the right way to do that.\n\nThat came first, and everything else was written and styled around that assumption.\n\nI do feel, perhaps, that doing that gave my entry an unfair advantage (but I can't be certain). I feel that a lot of readers enjoyed the //potential// of my work more than they would have enjoyed the work itself, if they had seen it initially in its entirety. I'd advise future readers to be wary of incomplete work, and vote for what you get, not for what you might get.\n\n**3) What was your favorite aspect of your article?**\n\nFor sure the best part of the work, for me, was getting to go nuts with the formatting. Making the interactive site map is some of the most CSS fun I've had in the past few years, and I got to use some new tech that's not really been seen on the wiki before. I had a chance to experiment and you know I took that by the horns.\n\n**4) If you could go back in time to the start of the contest, is there anything you would do differently with your article?**\n\nI made two huge mistakes with Site-69.\n\nForemost was failing to schedule it properly. At the start I was posting a new fragment every 4 hours, representing an hour of real-time activity on the Site. With a little coding I could have made that much easier on myself by scheduling uploads hours ahead of time, so I figured I'd get that set up between the first and second uploads and then sleep tight.\n\nAnyone with any programming experience at all knows that 'a little coding' is a total deception. I did not get the scheduled uploads working, and by the time I realised that I'd need at least a few days to test how reliable it was, I decided it would be easier overall to just do it myself.\n\nSo I did. I posted that content every four hours for three days. In between I polished the next segment, revised future segments, tweaked formatting, and did other boring stuff like eat and steal snippets of sleep; all of which pretty much halted my Covid recovery. Naturally, wanting to give the impression of having everything planned out perfectly, I didn't tell anyone about that. This is off the record, right?\n\nThe second big mistake was the pacing. I wanted to post an hour of live activity from the Site per segment, so each segment had to contain an hour of stuff happening, and a little bit of worldbuilding to flesh out Site-69's atmosphere, but not so much stuff that I'd run out of content. Like an absolute idiot I then started the story at midnight when all the characters were asleep.\n\nIt was a comment by [[*user A Random Day]] that highlighted for me that the pacing was worse than I thought it was, especially for readers who didn't care for those little snippets of worldbuilding in place of stuff happening. After that, I changed course: I posted the 10AM segment as-is, but then aggressively edited the next few segments down into one, scrapped a bunch of plot points, posted the 11AM segment on time, extended the countdown from 4 hours to 16 and stopped to rethink (and sleep). During the rest of the contest period I posted only 2 more segments, cut down from 12. Thanks ARD!\n\n**5) Despite winning, you self-deleted your entry. How come? If deletion wasn’t a factor in this contest, do you think the article would have been the same?**\n\nAh... the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-16865982/wrathcon#post-6545932 Pact]. I've no idea if I was the first to suggest that no entry survive the contest, but I did come up with it independently.\n\nFrom the start I saw Wrathcon's gimmick as a creative opening rather than a constraint. I took full advantage of that opening, the assumption that my work was temporary. If Site-69 had ended up being a permanent resident on the site, I don't think it would have had the same impact, and I don't think it would have been fair on everyone else who entered. But I'd already committed to self-deleting before Site-69 existed, and that's because it just felt better to me. No winners, no losers, everyone competing for the thrill of the game instead of for survival.\n\nIf deletion wasn't a factor? I wouldn't have entered. Wrathcon's uniqueness made it intriguing beyond being just another theme.\n\n**6) Do you think you will use Site 69, characters, or concepts presented again in future works?**\n\nI'm sure little snippets of it will come up in future stuff I make. I learned a lot making it across a bunch of different areas and someone //far// more keen-eyed than me might spot ideas that originated in Site-69.\n\nBut Site-69 itself feels closed to me now. Someone told me they'd like to continue writing in Site-69's world - I have nothing but the greatest enthusiasm for that, and I would be overjoyed to get to experience a spiritual successor - but I don't think I'll do so myself. It was, and it isn't.\n\n**7) Did any of the other entries stand out to you? Which ones and why?**\n\nFor sure - it was really interesting seeing how other writers and artists were inspired by Wrathcon's idea in a totally different way to me. While I didn't get the chance to read every article (in part no doubt to the recovery period after finishing), of the ones that I did, my favourites were the ones that took advantage of Wrathcon's ephemerality - the ones that couldn't have been posted in any other context.\n\nBest execution of that idea in my opinion was [[*user Ethagon]]'s //SC-GY/007-GY/021: Graveyard//, which weaved the rules of Wrathcon with the lore of the CI and provided an in-universe reason for concepts to exist and then suddenly stop -- all while being intended to be ephemeral itself. I don't think it was the last thing posted, but it was a meditative sendoff to the contest nonetheless.\n\n[[*user Queerious]] turned the concept on its head with //Witless//, a breathless monosentence that I didn't fully appreciate at the time, reposted after the contest as //[[[Wit|]]]//, a series of poems subtractively constructed from the original. //Wit// couldn't exist without the destruction of //Witless// and if that's not an artistic power move I don't know what is.\n\n[[[/system:page-tags/tag/wrathcon2024 | Here's a list of all the other reposted works originally submitted to Wrathcon.]]]\n\nFinally, and arguably mostly, I want to shout out the Wrathcon hub itself and the epitaphs created by [[*user syuzhet]]. These are for sure the best things to come out of the contest. The amount of work put into that page, both artistically and organisationally as a contest, is just great. The sheer level of mutual enthusiasm makes contributing to the wiki worthwhile. That page just puts a grin on my face every time I see it.\n[[/div]]\nCongratulations on winning Croquembouche!\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts!
