Science can prevent the perils of the past, and may offer a resolution to the mysteries of the ages.//\n> \n> //Our circle of scholars is dedicated to the advancement of scientific knowledge, challenging the boundaries of what is known and investigating the unknown.

It was one of our first after the Great War, I believe.  A good meal; [O5-3] always brought the best Burgundy over with him.  All thirteen of us were there.  We had a great deal to catch up on, having not spoken in so long.\n\nI was speaking to [O5-11] about an expedition he was planning to the Ukraine, looking into stories he had heard about a \"ghost forest\", when [O5-1] stood up to address the table.  I was surprised, as our meetings were generally very casual, but [O5-1] was always one for making a show of things.\n\nHe spoke about how long it was since we'd met, and how much the world had changed since we'd first started corresponding.  He wanted our arrangements to become more formal; to create a new scientific organisation.  He was speaking about the war, and about the influenza that followed.  We had discussed the prevention of disease before, but this was bigger.  [O5-1] wanted to go beyond mere medicine - far beyond.  I don't remember exactly what he said, but he was impassioned.  He was leaning forward and gripping the edge of the table like he might break it off.\n\nHe said that these events - no, he said \"these atrocities\" - must not be allowed to repeat.  He asked us what Science was worth as a tool if it could not prevent them, and what the spirit of Man was worth if he did not dedicate himself to mastery of that tool.  He challenged us, told us that we should walk dauntless to the blank wall at the end of life, and that we should break through it.  He said - and his eyes caught mine, I'll never forget that look - that even if we couldn't reclaim those souls lost to death's dominion, we could ensure that no more would suffer that fate.\n\nWell, the room was in uproar.  Everyone spoke at once, and the debate ran for hours.  But [O5-1] would not be gainsaid.  He had answers for all our arguments, and slowly he wore us down, convincing us he had the right of it.  Tell you the truth, despite our natural contention I think we wanted to be convinced.\n\nWe agreed that our organisation would concentrate its research on avenues outside of mainstream science, and that therefore it should operate in secret.  Several of us already had substantial collections of curiosities - what we now call anomalies - that could be contributed to the cause.\n\nPerhaps it is hard to understand if you were not in that room, if you did not live through that war.  But we knew that the task we had embarked upon was right.  Noble, even.  We would change not just the world, but human life itself.  That day, the Foundation was born.  We began to perform miracles.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Foundation documents - 1922-1929]]\n**Index Cards - Foundation files**\n\n[[div style=\"font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold\"]]\n> __Date:__ 12 April 1922\n> \n> __Item #:__  006 [Explained]\n> \n> __Object Class:__  Nepenthe\n> \n> __Security Procedures:__ The effect of item 006 has been determined to the satisfaction of the research team and the Council, and experimental results are considered reproducible.

Anything prolonging, enhancing or protecting life, if I remember it right.  We had a bunch of similar categories in those days - most of them got folded up into \"Safe\" by the mid-fifties.\n\nBut to start with, the \"Keter\" classification was limited to item 001 alone.  [O5-1] chose it himself, you know.  He had read a lot of Crowley - in \"Liber 777\" it is associated with death - but I'm not sure that was his reason for choosing it.  I like to think that the name \"Keter\" was based on the Sephiroth: because 001 was beyond comprehension, because it was the crowning purpose of the Foundation.\n\nOver time, the Keter category expanded to other threats to life that did not fit the existing classifications, or were otherwise unfathomable.  But it never fit them like it did 001.  Death was always at the centre of the Foundation's work - it hovered at the shoulder of every researcher, walked with every field agent, sat opposite every administrator.  An army of brilliant minds, gifted people, all striving to contain it.\n\nAs we found out, you can't shut death in a box.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/psul-001/offset/4 |Open next file ...]]]\n[[/>]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[module css]]\n.computed {\nborder: 1px black solid;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.computed:before {\ncontent:\"Computed Code\";\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.rawcode {\nborder: black solid 1px;\nwidth: 50%;\ndisplay: inline-block;\ntext-align: left;\npadding: 3px;\n}\n.rawcode:before{\ncontent:\"Raw Code\";\ntext-align: center;\nfont-weight: bold;\nborder-bottom: solid 1px black;\nwidth: 100%;\n}\n.codebox {\ndisplay: inline-block;\nwidth: 100%;\ntext-align: center;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a em,  .yui-navset .yui-nav a em{\npadding: 0.25em .75em; \ntop: 0px;\nmargin-bottom: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected {\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:focus, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a:hover, .yui-navset .yui-nav .selected a {\nbackground: gray;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a, .yui-navset .yui-navset-top .yui-nav a {\nbackground-color: none;\nbackground-image: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav a {\nbackground: none;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-nav li{\nmargin: 0px;\n}\n.yui-navset .yui-content {\nbackground-color: #FDFCF9; \n}\n[[/module]]",
