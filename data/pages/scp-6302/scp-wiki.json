Individuals affected by SCP-6302 are to be administered Class-C Amnestics.\n\nTo reduce the spread of SCP-6302, the Foundation is to advocate for the removal of the //Warriors// book series from public access under the guise of parental groups upset about the excessive violence portrayed in the series. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6302 refers to a phenomenon that currently affects thirteen percent of those who have completed at least one book in the //Warriors// franchise. SCP-6302 causes the affected individual to feel compelled to travel to and enter the nearest forest or woodland area, where they will experience tactile, auditory, and visual hallucinations of a clowder [[footnote]]A group of cats.[[/footnote]]in the area stationed similarly to the living quarters in the //Warriors// series are described. Behavior of the felines has been observed to be similar to that of the characters in the books. \n\nIf the subject is injured by the hallucinations caused by SCP-6302, only they and other affected individuals will see the injuries. If the injury is fatal, death will appear to be spontaneous to the unaffected. Individuals affected will also gain the firm belief that domestic house cats should not be kept as pets, but rather kept outside to take part in a 'clan'. Many affected by SCP-6302 that owned felines as pets have released them into the wild. If all memories of reading any book of the //Warriors// franchise are erased from an affected individual's mind, they will no longer experience SCP-6302's effects, but are subject to experiencing them again if the individual is re-exposed to the franchise. \n\nThe individuals behind the Erin Hunter pseudonym were investigated and interviewed thoroughly. It has been concluded that none of them had any involvement with the creation of SCP-6302. \n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n------\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[size large]]**__Addendum__**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum-1-Discovery:** SCP-6302 first came to the Foundation's attention when a Foundation Webcrawler alerted researchers of multiple abnormal social media posts.

Initial observation found that Charles' had begun showing atypical physical characteristics including:\n\n* A snout developing in place of her nose.\n* Position of the ears transitioning higher up on the head while developing additional characteristics including sharper tips, pinnae, fur, cartilage, and a deeper ear canal.\n* Whiskers sprouting from the area around the eyes, nose, and chin.\n* Patches of fur on various parts of the body.\n* Sharper, pointed, and thicker nails. \n\nThe cause of death was determined to be hypothermia and internal organ failure. Autopsy reports showed that Charles' internal organs, skeletal system was changing to a quadrupedal stance and that the skull was changing in shape.\n\nFoundation researchers sent agents to receive the body and administer Class-A amnestics to all persons who had witnessed the discovery of Charles' body. Charles is the only instance of these effects occurring to date. It was concluded that any person undergoing the observed changes would die before the transformation is completed due to the human body being unable to support the physical nature of the changes. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6301]]] | SCP-6302 | [[[SCP-6303]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]] \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Forumpost \n> **Author:** [[*user DianaBerry]]\n> **License:**  CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
