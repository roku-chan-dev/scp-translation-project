Occasionally a car would pass. The headlights illuminated the puddles that had collected from the ongoing rain. She pulled her heavy jacket close, and took a drag on a cigarette before looking over a few collected notes.//\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nWhile Sloth's Pit is one of the more animated Nexuses in the United States, greatly distorting the Anomaly Occurrence Value of the entire Midwest, Wisconsin is only the second-most anomalous state. Thanks to the existence of Roadkill County in Oregon, the Pacific Northwest is, from a purely quantitative standpoint, the most anomalous area of the United States.\n\nDr. Philip Verhoten \n//The Crossroads: A Study of Urban Anomalous Nexuses in the United States.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nWe have a lot of ground to cover today with all the orientations so I'm going to keep this brief. I'm Director Edgar Holman. Welcome to Site-64.\n\nFor those of you who are just starting out with the Foundation, glad we could be your first. Site-64 is large enough that things don't stay stagnant here, while small enough we avoid the logistical and staffing problems of the larger sites, like 19. It's a good place to get your feet wet. A lot of you will be working with contacts within the FBI's Unusual Incident's Unit. Some of you will be interacting with members of the local anart crowd. Others of you will be chasing robots.\n\nNotice I said interacting with, and not 'containing.' That's because the Veil Protocol is enacted a little differently here.  Three Portlands is, in a loose sense of the term, a massive containment cell. We keep the whole place quiet, sure, but we aren't about to storm the city. We'd only be making our job harder than it needs to be.\n\nAnd let's be honest, this job doesn't need to be any harder. We still see our fair share of ghosts, goblins, monsters, and whatever else it is that goes bump in the night. But hey, at least we aren't under a goddamn lake. \n\nAnyway, we're about to do our first set of breakout sessions. Welcome aboard, everyone. Godspeed.\n\nDirector Edgar Holman \nSite-64 New Employee Orientation, May 2nd, 2012\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nSome of you have been with the Unit for a while. You've all seen some pretty weird shit, otherwise you wouldn't be here. Maybe you've done a stint in the Backdoor and think you've got a handle on this kind of thing. Well, you've never seen anything like Three Ports. I can guarantee it.\n\nThis city is fucking //weird//.\n\nThe City of Three Portlands is the largest paranormal enclave in the United States — or within our jurisdiction, at least. I'm still not super clear on the semantics of this multiverse stuff. But what that means is that you're going to see things you've never seen before — things you never thought possible before. Anartists and wizards are just the tip of the iceberg. We've got cyborgs, talking dogs, demigods, ghosts, psychics, shapeshifters, faeries, and gods know what else in this town. Most of them are human, or humanish. Some of them aren't. So try to keep an open mind. We're the outsiders here.\n\nThree Portlands is also autonomous. Independent. A self-sufficient city-state with its own city council and mayor — although nobody's ever seen the latter. We're not on US soil here. Our authority and jurisdiction only come from the Hoover Mandate — that is, because we say so. That said, we don't have the manpower or the firepower to fight the entire city, and we aren't gonna be winning any popularity contests here, so play nice — city police handle most local crime, and you should always try to deescalate back to them if you can. They've got riot golems, after all.\n\nOur job is to keep a lid on all this weirdness. Keep it contained, if you want to use the skippers' term. There's no Doorman here, and there are more Ways in and out than you can count. Trust me, I've tried. This place is a haven for paracrime — smuggling and trafficking are near the top of the list, but I've seen everything from conceptual arson to temporal trading fraud. Like I said, this city is weird. Don't be surprised if some goon running demonarcotics for the Lighthouse Mafia pulls a Soviet plasma projector on you, because that'll get you killed. Surprise is a luxury we can't afford.\n\nThe good news is that we've got some weirdness of our own. Most of our irregular agents are assigned here; odds are good you'll be partnered with at least one of them — listen to them, they know this world better than you. If you need to call in the big guns, the amount of Ways mean that MOOT can be here in minutes. And if things go really wrong, the Foundation's always looking for an excuse to get involved. Try not to give them that excuse if you can avoid it, skippers always manage to fuck things up for us.\n\nWhen in doubt, act like a Boy Scout: helpful, courteous, and prepared for the end of the world.\n\nSpecial Agent Kenneth Spencer\nOrientation for Incoming Agents of the UIU's Three Portlands Field Office, 2016\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nDo you dream of experiencing what **Three Portlands** has to offer?

Moving our HQ and main production facility to Three Portlands was the best decision Vincent ever made.\n\nThree Ports gave us the freedom to work unhindered, minus what the city felt it was due. We were able to tap into a talented base of former Prometheus Labs employees, thaumatologists, and Maxwellists. All of that, and we were still only a few Ways away from Oregon, the UK, Maine, and contacts in the Library. Anderson Robotics would have failed a lot sooner anywhere else.\n\nPerhaps that's why it was so shocking when it all came crashing down. We were set. We had it all. We were unstoppable. \n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't miss those days.\n\nIsaac Dillard, \n//Money, Magic, and Machines//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nTo Twenty-One Hundred Eyes Uplifted Under Scorching Skies,\n\nIt's not surprising you'd ask about expanding your influence into Three Portlands. The Three City is a well-known hotbed for people like us, and every young goddx like yourself wants a slice of the hot young hipster demographic to be the face of their following. My pacts with various other cosmological heresiarchs dictate that I save the juiciest marketing strategies for deities omnipotent enough to conjure me more than a single tonne of gold a month; nonetheless, I do still have advice (almost certainly not befitting for somegod of your stature).\n\nI would advise you branch out to some of the more libertine groups within the city. I'm aware that the Madmen have a [[[slow-animals|certain degree of influence]]] there, and their more anarchist tendencies certainly align with many of the tenets of your belief-body. Certainly, any number of wandering artists might be inspired to take you on as a muse, though do ask for a background check before you shake any hands. Portlands has a history of harbouring [[[a-farewell-to-kings|the kinds of artists]]] who turn their rivals into Impressionist works.\n \nBut it doesn't take me to forecast your specific powers might be more applicable in service to Oneiroi Incorporated, the architects behind most of the memory palaces in the Prime Plane. Their memetic engineering, your slightly distressing habit of telepathically inflicting sand-based erotic fantasies on innocent bysleepers; a recipe for a collaboration with a juicy cut in it for both you and your faithful advisor.\n\nAfraid you're not paying me enough to say more, so that's all the advice I'll give you this equinox — though feel free to drop me another tonne of precious metal if you're in a real pickle that happens to fall within my hours of operation.\n\nYours in nocturnal apotheosis,\nSaturn Deer & Fellow Degenerates Financial\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nThree Portlands?\n\nYeah I knows the place. We had one of our biggest joints down there this side o' the Mississippi. Don't matter how much magic you got in ya, there's some things only booze can take care of - and booze is something the Spirit had plenty of. We had all sorts tryna come in and get a piece of that rum cake, you know what I'm saying. Snakes, leadheads, all those magic bimbos. Actin' real tough, tryna threaten us and run us out of town with their fancy tricks and lightshows. \n\nI tell you though, magic don't mean squat when you're staring down the barrel of a Thompson.\n\nRoland MacDell\nFormer Chicago Spirit, Foundation Deliberations, September 26th, 1972\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\nSure, we've always had the place in Kenosha, but that's more of a place to get your head together. Three Portlands is a little different. It's like a safe haven, untouched by Janitors and those weird Tank-Fuckers. I mean, G-d knows they're here, but it's muted. You feel like you can be who you wanna be here. G-d, that's corny, isn't it? But trust me, I got about six ex-girlfriends here, and about a half of them are Gamers Against Weed. It's a safe place for us, all things aside.\n\nBut I mean, you'd think this Twin Peaks bullshit would be beyond me, but I was born around here. And I can't stay away for long. It doesn't get greener than this anywhere else in the world, if you ask me. There's something primal here, and that's why it's so special. I kinda sound like this Wiccan I used to date. She still lives around here. But trust me, you'll be okay.\n\nEsther Kogan \n“lesbian_gengar”, co-founder of GAW\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#e9e9e9; text-color:black; margin:30px; padding:20px; border-style: solid;\"]]\n[[=]]\nYOU!\n[[/=]]\n\nare invited to the __GRANDE OPENING of WILSON'S WILDLIFE SOLUTIONS!!!__\nBoring, Oregon is home to some of the craziest, most wonderful animals this side of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, and for lively wildlife we require lively wildlife specialists! come see the newest, spangliest shiniest new institution of pest control and injured animal rehabilitation!\nDinner and dessert will be provided — — including vegetrian, vegan, and gluten free options of pasta, salads, and burgers.

Nestled between the doorstep of a massive extradimensional city-state, a large anomalous art community, the world headquarters of Anderson Robotics, and the natural habitat of a bizarre array of wildlife, the SCP Foundation certainly needs all hands on deck in this region.\n\nSet among this colorful backdrop \"Those Twisted Pines\" is a diverse canon exploring a variety of themes. So far this has included:\n\n* What conflict exists between an MTF agent's duty/ambition, and their family?\n* Why does the Foundation intentionally create anomalies on occasion? \n* To what lengths will the Foundation go to accommodate the families of employees?\n* Is it acceptable to allow smaller anomalies to remain uncontained if it means more effective maintenance of the Veil?\n* When is the Foundation willing to allow a Group of Interest to remain in control of an anomaly?\n* To what degree do sapient anomalies struggle for individualism and self-affirmation?\n\nSite-64 and Three Portlands are always changing, however, and there is plenty of room for you to leave your mark on the Pacific Northwest.\n\n------\n\n+ **Contributor Guide:**\n\nThe Pacific Northwest is a geographic region consisting of the province of British Columbia and the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. With the exception of a few articles and tales that overlap with The Gulf canon, or take place at Site-19, most pieces in \"Those Twisted Pines\" take place in this region, specifically at Site-64 or within Three Portlands. A more detailed look into both of these locations can be found in their respective hubs:\n\n* [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-64]]]\n* [[[three-portlands-hub|UIU Location Dossier — \"Three Portlands\"]]]\n\nWithin \"Those Twisted Pines\" the SCP Foundation and its operatives are often pragmatic in their approach to containment. Anartists and Thaumatologists are on the payroll to help make containment of these phenomena easier. Foundation operatives have an option to bring their families onto their side of the veil through the \"Family Disclosure Protocol.\" Staff dormitories are available in Site-64, but the staff is also allowed to live in the nearby Portland Metro Area. While the Foundation is still quite a cold place to work, in this canon they have taken just a tinier step further away from cruel.\n\nNumerous GoIs are major players in \"Those Twisted Pines\" as well:\n\n* The Unusual Incidents Unit is a major law enforcement agency in Three Portlands. The SCP Foundation often work in conjunction with, or through them, in their operations in Three Portlands.\n* The Chaos Insurgency, Prometheus Labs, Chicago Spirit, AWCY? and Maxwellist Church all operate or have operated to various degrees within the Three Portlands and the surrounding regions.\n* Through a special set of accords with the SCP Foundation, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions often handle anomalous wildlife in the region.\n* Anderson Robotics used the Pacific Northwest as the base for building its paratech empire.\n\nThere is plenty of room left for these factions to clash or collaborate with one another. They just need you to write the articles and tales.\n\n++ **Additional Reading:**\n\nThe following have been major influences on numerous factors within \"Those Twisted Pines\" and as such overlap with this canon in many places. It is encouraged, but not mandatory, that those wishing to contribute to the canon be somewhat familiar with them:\n\n* [[[the-gulf|The Gulf Canon]]] \n* [[[third-law-hub|Third Law Canon]]]\n* [[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD Canon]]]\n* [[[learning-the-alphabet-hub|Learning The Alphabet]]]\n* [[[anderson-robotics-hub|Anderson Robotics Hub]]]\n* [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Hub]]]\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** zhange3560.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Zhange]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/zhange-artwork SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
