Mapping initiatives have detected a large internal bladder and five powerful sphincters, located at the rear of its body. Within the bladder, a complex metabolic process produces biochemical propellant. This propellant is expelled through one of its five sphincters. Based on this anatomical configuration, Foundation-employed aerospace engineers estimate that velocities upwards of 8,000 m/s (28,000 km/h) can be achieved in the vacuum of space.\n\nCollected Thaumic Gateway[[footnote]][[span class=\"h-span\"]]Thaumic Gateway:[[/span]] A para-technological machine that uses a set of complex thaumaturgic rituals to temporarily generate a stable miniature portal (known in the paranormal community as a \"Way\"). The Thaumic Gateway enables an array of instant communication methods through each created Way, including short-wave radio band and 5G Wi-Fi fields.

Starting in 2009, at least 5,900 different persons on Earth have undergone physical teleportation into the interior of SCP-4475's mammary glands.\n\nThough random in nature, both firsthand eyewitness accounts and audiovisual recordings from dairy ranchers corroborate the existence of a complex ritual (designated [[span class=\"h-span\"]]SCP-4475-1[[/span]]) capable of triggering the phenomena. The following process -- as compiled by abducted dairy ranchers for scientific study -- is a baseline for teleportation via SCP-4475-1:\n\n# Select and secure a cow.\n# Vocalize praise for its existence.\n# Approach the selected cow at a 55° angle in the direction of its posterior.\n# Lubricate its two rear quarters, preferably with udder cream.\n# Pull on each teat five times.\n\nFollowing the ritual, immediate disappearance and re-emergence inside SCP-4475's udder has occurred in all cases.\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n= [[span class=\"h2\"]]Addendum 4475.1[[/span]]\n= [[span class=\"h3\"]]INITIAL RECOVERY LOG[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"log-bg\"]]\n[[div class=\"log\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ [[span class=\"h-span\"]]RECOVERY LOG 4475.1[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]DATE:[[/span]] December 21, 2009\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]RECOVERY NOTE:[[/span]] The following is the earliest known recorded instance of spontaneous teleportation into SCP-4475.

Due to its large mass and physical dimensions, the use of a Marlowe Anti-Gravitational Repulsion Sled is essential in allowing simple transportation of the device.\n* The microcomputer processor, hull, and power plant for five autonomous telemetry drones will be deployed alongside the CRIMSON COWBELL team.\n\nBetween September 22 and October 10, Project GALAXIAS staffed 28 excursions into SCP-4475 with the sole purpose of plotting a route into the lower bound of one of its 400-meter-long teats. Each associated rancher readily pledged under a Foundation-authorized geas[[footnote]][[span class=\"h-span\"]]Geas:[[/span]] A memetic command imposed on any willing person.

GAMMA parked the Repulsion Sled in an open chamber and programmed the Thaumic Gateway to open periodically and transmit the team's collected data. The team activated and released the telemetry drones, which dispersed. One drone flew down a path leading to the chosen teat, and the team followed.\n\nThe team traveled down a long subterranean biological tunnel, next to a temple structure like that seen in [[span class=\"h-span\"]]Recovery Log 4475.1[[/span]]. \n\nAt 0704 hours, ALPHA reported distant bovine vocalization and ordered the team to a halt. After perceiving no threat, they reconvened -- with ALPHA at the lead -- and traveled unabated for 3 hours.\n\nAt 1021 hours, ALPHA reached the teat's upper span, discovering the lifeless body of a ranch-hand; their ID tags identified them as one Darien Meyer. COMMAND claimed that Meyer exited SCP-4475 one month ago and is presently employed by the Foundation with Class-E personnel classification.\n\nAt 1025 hours, BETA discovered an enamel statue of a feminine humanoid entity with bovine characteristics. BETA noticed warped holes resembling those found in osteoporosis patients. She scraped off a sample of pink residue, revealing porous bone marrow beneath.\n\nWhile taking the sample, the tunnel's muscle-lined walls contracted. BETA hastened her sample collection. At once, the flesh ruptured, from which acidic stomach fluid, pus, blood, and milk flooded the chamber. In a panic, the team jumped into a nearby crevasse, falling an estimated 20 meters onto a soft-padded biological chamber floor. \n\nAfter a brief respite, ALPHA noticed GAMMA's VISTA-Type suit slumped over and still. Upon closer inspection, the helmets' glass view-visor appeared shattered, and GAMMA's body was not found within. ALPHA marked her as Missing In Action, but BETA's biometric radar indicated that GAMMA now existed in two separate locations: 5 meters behind and 6 meters beneath them, simultaneously.\n\nCOMMAND confirmed the signals matched a 99.6% biometric reading of GAMMA and reported the irregularity to the Director of Project GALAXIAS. Awaiting a response, COMMAND ordered the team to remain in place. \n\nAround 1031 hours, the headset of each \"GAMMA\" instance activated and broadcast the following in base-2 numerals: \"DISAVOWED DEATH FORBIDDEN.\"\n\nALPHA noticed a star-shaped crevice glowing neon pink, illuminating the crevasse beneath. Against COMMAND's order and in an attempt to aid the \"correct\" GAMMA, ALPHA escaped into the hole. In an audio communication with BETA, he described feeling symptoms of dizziness and dehydration and ordered her to follow. She denied, remaining with GAMMA's vacant suit, where she stayed for the rest of the operation.\n\nAt 1034 hours, ALPHA's visual relay depicted a struggle as he fell through a translucent milk flow.\n\nAround 1035 hours, the Director of Project GALAXIAS responded, ordering COMMAND to hasten the operation. An argument erupted in the COMMAND control room over whether they should halt the operation prematurely.\n\nSoon after, large amounts of milk flooded into the control room from an unknown source. ALPHA's vitals were detected at the back of the Operations Theater, contradicting his presence within SCP-4475. COMMAND dispatched an armed security team to investigate. \n\nOther personnel -- who were attempting to escape -- discovered that all egress doors had been pasted shut with a curdled milk substance. COMMAND alerted the local emergency Mobile Task Force at once.\n\nAt 1038 hours, ALPHA ejected through the teat cistern into the vacuum of space at 14 meters per second. Despite his velocity, ALPHA jolted to a stop, 1.6 km away. His footage depicted the two distant stars θ^^1^^ Orionis A and B in his periphery, as well as an unaccounted for stellar abnormality ahead. The abnormality -- presumed to be a supermassive gravitational anomaly at the cluster's center -- emitted jets of EM radiation in each cardinal direction.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4475/4475-G.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=[[span class=\"h-span\" style=\"font-size: 120%;\"]]1038 hours -- A corrupted image captured by Spc.

Autonomous optical monitoring via nearby telemetry drone detected ~450,000 total entities.\n\nAt 1045 hours, ALPHA's in-suit sensor suite detected a space-time abnormality and subsequent burst of directed electromagnetic field (or EMF) radiation. The EMF energy, focused in a wide multi-colored beam filling his view, traveled at ~3 Astronomical Units[[footnote]]One Astronomical Unit (AU) = 149.6 million km. The average distance between the planet Earth and the Sun.[[/footnote]] per second in his direction -- ~1,500 times the speed of light. \n\n20 seconds later, the EMF beam enveloped SCP-4475, and ALPHA and BETA's telecommunications -- as well as all five drones -- went offline. \n\nAt 1046 hours, the emergency MTF arrived at the building and struggled to force open the front egress door. Personnel suffocated as the flow of milk in the control room reached a height of ~3 meters. \n\nEventually, the MTF breached the lobby, through which several thousand liters of milk escaped. Altogether, 12 personnel were found deceased, trapped within the control room.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\" style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"]]AFTER ACTION REPORT[[/span]] While assessing CRIMSON COWBELL and the events therein, COMMAND discovered that at 1045 hours, every electronic device in both the Operations Theater and SCP&D farm had received an identical foreign transmission. As translated from base-2 numerals, the message reads \"SAFE AND SOUND.\"\n\nAs well, analysts reviewed ALPHA's final transmission and reached a consensus on the sequence of events. It is now believed that due to an unknown spatiotemporal event, the directed EMF beam caused the aforementioned electromagnetic anomaly detected on November 19, 2034 -- some 327 days prior.\n\nAfter evacuating the Operations Theater, security personnel detained the apparent duplicate of ALPHA and inspected it for abnormalities. No superficial anomalies were detected. The subject leaked milk and smiled.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]V.
