Because of the entity's slow movement, it's quite easy and advisable to escape it to reach a snow-free area, such as the inside of a building, a car, or any public transport. Everyone outside alone is to remain aware of any sound of footsteps near them.\n\n**Local Containment Procedures:** Since winter is coming up real soon, I do hope we get some testing on the entity if we meet it again. Every upcoming major snowstorm of 2023 have been printed and pinned at our base, do not miss these dates. We'll try to test the limits of the thing but without a direct approach.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=footprint.jpg|caption=126 found by Carole Paquerette during December of 2022.|width=500px]]\n\n**Description:** 126 is an invisible entity that pursues a targeted individual, often alone. The entity is believed to be humanoid, with the footprints left in the snow confirming it to wear shoes 27,1 centimeters in size. Apart from its feet, no other discernible features of the entity's appearance were found.\n\n126 seems to only appear at nighttime when there is sufficient fresh snow on the ground to leave a footprint. It is also quite slow, only able to walk at a low speed toward a targeted individual.\n\n--What 126 does upon reaching its target, if anything at all, is unknown.-- We had a few calls during the night of some people alerting us of an invisible guy walking towards them, but they flew before it could reach them. Paquerette was the first to actually encounter the thing, she took a picture and left the place, probably for the better.\n\n__Update 14/01/2023:__ Encounter and testing.\n\nDurois found it again, at 1 am walking toward him on the sidewalk of Rachel street. He immediately called the division urgency hotline for backup. Paquerette and I left our jobs early and were able to get to the location as quickly as possible with my truck. Durois patiently awaited us, walking in a circle and playing a never-ending game of tag with 126. Even with the three of us around, it only followed John. Paquerette noticed it was walking even slower than before.\n\nWe brought with us a few things to test the entity. We first attempted to throw a blanket over it, to try and draw its shape and discover what it looked like, but the blanket fell flat on the snow. 126 didn't even react, we could hear under the blanket and see its steps continuing toward John. We tried to film it with an infrared camera, but nothing came up. I also tried throwing a bucket full of yellow paint at it, or even putting my truck in its path, but it went right through everything. It's like it doesn't exist, only its weight on the fresh snow was acknowledged by our reality. Paquerette forwarded the idea that 126 might also exist when there is no snow, invisible to anyone and only attempting to \"hunt\" someone when there is snow. Maybe it can only see the footprints of other beings, just like we see it. There wasn't any way to prove this, however.\n\nDurois, stupid as he is, proposed the brilliant idea to test what would happen when it reached its target. We told him no, that this could end very badly for him, and that we couldn't take the chance. He argued that the appearance of this entity is rare, we might not be able to prevent it from attacking if we don't know what happens. Still, we told him no and to shut up with the crazy ideas. Stubborn as he is, he ordered us to \"film this\" as he charged straight for the moving footprints. I shouted to stop, and upon reaching 126's placement, John's body entirely vanished. It happened so quickly, without any sound. My heart skipped a beat. The entity, on the other hand, continued walking in a different direction, still ignoring us.\n\nMy knees fell to the cold ground. Caroline, in her usual cold and efficient attitude, already reached her cellphone and was about to call for more backup on the situation. But before she could do any of that, her phone rang first. It was John's personal number. She screamed at me to calm down, seeing I was still in pure shock in the middle of the road. She answered, and Durois's voice came up and said that he was still alive and doing fine. From his understanding, 126 instantly transported him to Champlain Street in the middle of the road, about 300 meters from where we were.\n\nWe drove there, and fair enough, John was there. We brought him to the base, did the usual authentication questionnaire to make sure it was truly him, and once finished, I slapped him hard. Not hard enough to put some sense into him, unfortunately. John, if you read this, and I hope you do, I still think this was a very stupid idea. You almost gave me a heart attack god dammit.\n\nAnyway, turns out that it just teleports you. Maybe it's attempting to direct us toward a specific location. Or maybe not, since we didn't find anything on Champlain street. Sometimes anomalies are mysterious for the sake of being mysterious, I suppose. Sometimes they just want to fuck with us.\n\n__Update 02/02/2023:__ Incident.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **[Call begins]**\n\n//(Durois picks up the phone, he yawns upon answering.)//\n\n**Durois:** William? Is that you?\n\n**Gibeau:** Hey, uh, sorry to bother you. I know it's late, even by our standards.\n\n**Durois:** Don't worry about it, what's happening?  Where are you?\n\n//(Gibeau sniffs. There is sound of a strong wind outside.)//\n\n**Gibeau:** I met 126 again. You know, the invisible-teleporting pursuer.\n\n**Durois:** Oh, shit! Did he do anything new?\n\n**Gibeau:** No, nothing peculiar. I was heading back to work and got to my front door. While I was searching for my keys, I heard some steps coming, fast. Actually, yeah, it did have something new. I think it's faster now. Without having any time to react, I got teleported.\n\n**Durois:** Are you alright?\n\n**Gibeau:** Fine, yeah. There's just this slight snowstorm going on. I would have asked Paquerette, but I'm closer to your home right now, somewhere between Berri and Jarry's street. I can't say for sure, I don't have my GPS on my phone right now because of the other information-eater anomaly from last week.  \n\n**Durois:** Yeah, I remember it. I'm getting my car. Don't move.\n\n**Gibeau:** Don't worry I'm not planning on-\n\n//(Silence. The wind is getting stronger.)//\n\n**Gibeau:** Fuck.\n\n**Durois:** William?\n\n//(Gibeau is heard running.

Where are you?\n\n**Gibeau:** I'm still alright. 126 kept following me, I think the teleportation ended the call. Fuck. It was faster than a car.\n\n**Durois:** How?\n\n**Gibeau:** No clue, might have to do with the amount of snow on the ground. The storm is also getting stronger and colder out there. I'm between Sauvé and Garnier street, I think.\n\n**Durois:** Alright, I'm coming as fast as I can. I'll call the others to help.\n\n//(Silence. Gibeau is heard breathing.)//\n\n**Durois:** Don't tell me it's already there.\n\n**Gibeau:** I see it in the distance. I can't even bother running. It's fast, John.\n\n**Durois:** Okay. Here's what you're going to do: go directly to the 126 page and edit in a picture and your current location every time you get teleported. That way, if there are others Fondation members around, we'll be able to get you home, fast. You get me?\n\n//(Steps are heard coming closer and closer.)//\n\n**Gibeau:** Alright.

I insisted, asking him if he knew someone from around here to help. He looked at me with this strange look, like I was some weirdo. 126 reached me while I was still talking, probably scared the living shit out of the man upon disappearing. |\n    width=500px|\n    align=center|\n]]\n\nI should mention that we’ve called the police.

I tried to get on top of one of the car around, last thing I saw was its steps appearing on the snow-covered windshield.
