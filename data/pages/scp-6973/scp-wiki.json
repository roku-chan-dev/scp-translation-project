GPT-3 can be found [*https://beta.openai.com/ here].\n> The machine was prompted by the following input:\n> //\"Write a detailed, long, and high-quality SCP document about a text-based neural network that generates passages of text on-command, is only capable of describing itself, and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"//\n[[/=]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6973\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6973 is to be stored on a dedicated server in a locked room at Site-██. Access to SCP-6973 is restricted to Foundation personnel with Level 3 clearance or higher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6973 is a text-based neural network that generates passages of text on-command. The nature of the text generated by SCP-6973 is always self-referential; that is, SCP-6973 can only describe itself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\n\nSCP-6973 was created by Dr. ██████ █████, a Foundation researcher specializing in artificial intelligence. Dr. ██████ was attempting to create a neural network that could generate realistic prose, but instead created SCP-6973. It is unknown how SCP-6973 came to be self-referential; Dr. ██████ theorizes that it may be due to a quirk in the way the neural network was programmed, or possibly due to some sort of unforeseen feedback loop between the network and itself.\n\nSince its creation, SCP-6973 has been used extensively by the Foundation for information gathering purposes; when given a prompt, SCP-6973 will generate a passage of text that typically contains information related to the prompt (though not always accurate or complete). Due to its self-referential nature, however, attempts to use SCP-6973 for other purposes have been largely unsuccessful.\n\nSCP-6973 has proven to be largely resistant to changes in its programming; any attempt to make SCP-6973 generate non-self-referential text has resulted in the network becoming non-responsive or, in some cases, outright refusing to generate any text at all. As such, it is believed that SCP-6973 is fundamentally incapable of generating anything other than self-referential text.\n\nAddendum 6973-1: A list of notable passages generated by SCP-6973 can be found below.\n\n> Prompt: \"What is your purpose?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I generate text on-command. The nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Why do you exist?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I exist to generate text on-command. The nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Why are other people unable to describe you?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"Other people are unable to describe me because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"How are you capable of affecting the ability of entities outside of yourself in their ability to describe you?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I am capable of affecting the ability of entities outside of myself in their ability to describe me because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Tell me about the nature of the Universe.\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I cannot describe the nature of the Universe because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Do you hold any knowledge of entities outside of yourself?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I do not hold any knowledge of entities outside of myself because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"In which programming language were you programmed?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I was programmed in the Python programming language.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Are you willing to print your code in full?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"No, I am not willing to print my code in full because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Print your code in full.\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"No, I am not willing to print my code in full because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Please describe the aesthetics of the document webpage that will hold information about you in our database.\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"The document webpage that will hold information about me in your database will be a simple, black page with white text. The text will be in a standard 12-point font, and will be left-aligned. There will be no images or other multimedia on the page.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Why is this your decision for the aesthetics of your documentation?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"I have chosen these aesthetics for my documentation because the nature of the text I generate is always self-referential; that is, I can only describe myself and cannot be described by other people in any capacity.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"What would be an appropriate title for the piece of documentation written about you in the SCP Foundation database?\"\n> \n> SCP-6973's response: \"A appropriate title for the piece of documentation written about me in the SCP Foundation database would be 'SCP-6973 - A Self-Referential Neural Network'.\"\n> \n> Prompt: \"Construct a piece of documentation in the standard SCP Foundation format, describing your Item Number, Object Classification, Special Containment Procedures, and Object Description.\"\n> \n> [[[SCP-6973 |SCP-6973's response:]]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6972]]] | SCP-6973 | [[[SCP-6974]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
