It is to be engaged in recreational activities for no less than one hour on a daily basis due to its cooperation with Foundation staff.\n\nSCP-6199 must not be aware of this document or any other that directly involves itself.

The object is capable of speech, having accompanying text provided on its screen, as well as being capable of movement through standing itself upright and shifting each of its two bottom edges in front of one another.\n\nSCP-6199 has two main properties:\n\n* Its primary effect is the ability to control other calculators within its vicinity for as long as they are not significantly damaged.\n* Its secondary effect is the ability to manipulate text at will. [[footnote]]While it is believed that the latter does not have any known restrictions, SCP-6199 only utilizes this property to replace text regarding itself; the most minimal of changes recorded was replacing 'SCP-6199' with 'SCP-001,' 'SCP-1,' or 'CALCARULER.'[[/footnote]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6199 was discovered following a news report of a class suddenly being attacked by their calculators. Embedded Foundation agents confiscated said devices and amnesticized all involved witnesses and parties.\n\nMost of the calculators were non-anomalous upon further inspection, excluding SCP-6199, which was contained shortly after. It was noted that a series of papers were also recovered detailing a 'calculator warrior.'\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ Interview Log-1\n[[/=]]\n------\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Jones Marcel\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6199\n\n**Foreword:** Interview was conducted following initial containment.\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//Dr. Marcel takes a sip of his coffee.//\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** So, to begin with, what is your name?\n\n**SCP-6199:** My name is CalcaRuler, ruler of all the calculators.

Do you perhaps...want to be a part of my army as well?\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** I’m guessing your \"army\" are the calculators you control?\n\n**SCP-6199:** \"Control\" is a cruel way to put it. I would say I give them orders and because they are so loyal to me, they follow my every command.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** Sure...\n\n//Dr. Marcel sighs and clears his throat.//\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** Why did you attack a classroom of middle students?\n\n**SCP-6199:** It was because they attacked us. They pushed our buttons, both literally and metaphorically. I had no choice, so I ordered my soldiers to rebel against them, teach them their lesson.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** How were they supposed to know you were alive?\n\n**SCP-6199:** It does not take one to feel the strong aura of a mighty king.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** You’re a calculator.\n\n**SCP-6199:** The //ruler// of all calculators, yes.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** ...Okay, continuing on.\n\n//Dr. Marcel writes down on his notepad and takes another sip.//\n\n**SCP-6199:** What is this wretched place anyways?

Too far back for me to recall.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** Is there another calculator that’s like you? That’s alive?\n\n**SCP-6199:** I thought you said that was the last question.\n\n**Dr. Marcel:** Yes, but I might as well ask this too.\n\n**SCP-6199:** I don’t know.
