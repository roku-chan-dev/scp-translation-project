I went through the door with the square on it from the cabinet last time, and I ended up back in the big city. I found a tunnel that went to the big skyscraper in the middle of the city, which didn't have any boards, for whatever reason.\n> \n> Elevator was broken— well, not broken, but TSAT kept telling me that it wasn't stable. I took the stairs, but the upper floors were blocked by the web shit, and I know I don't want to touch that. Don't want another one of the lizards chasing me again. Anyways, I went downstairs, and there was a big hole in the concrete floor, and I climbed down that and now I'm in this big secret lab, like the basement back at Site-31.\n> \n> //<Pause.>//\n> \n> I think that's everything. Anyways, It's dark in here, but we found a terminal, and TSAT's trying to hack it to get the lights on. I've been standing here for the past few minutes, waiting for—\n> \n> **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** ✔ Vulnerability Found, Login Completed ✔ — 💡 Activating lights...\n> \n> //<Click from lights activating.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** Now I can see the rest of the room... It's pretty white, sterile, except for the green web, which I didn't see coming in. I'm lucky I avoided it. There's some doors, but they're blocked with the green web. The terminal's in front of a window, looking into a testing room, from the looks of it. It's labeled \"Greenroot Holdings Inc.\" I don't see how you're supposed to get in.\n> \n> **TSATPWTCOTTTADC.aic:** 🔎 Mainframe analysis complete, executable program found. ❓ Should I execute it?\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** Go ahead. Let's see if this still works.\n> \n> //<Whirring noises, presumably from the machine activating.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** Okay, there's a, uh, chemistry set, that came out of a hole in the wall, inside of the test chamber. There's something red and clear in the vials, I'm not a chemist, I can't tell what it is. Another hole opened up on the other side of the room; if something's supposed to be coming out of it, it's broken.\n> \n> There's something extending out of the table holding the chemistry set. It's like a syringe, but it looks longer. It's still... extending out.\n> \n> //<Whirring noises for 5 seconds, then the noises suddenly cease.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** It... it stopped. I don't know—\n> \n> **Mechanical Voice:** //<Loud.>// ERROR: SUBJECT NOT PRESENT WITHIN CHAMBER. PLEASE REACTIVATE TESTING ONCE CHAMBER IS FULLY OCCUPIED.\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** Wait! Shit, shit—\n> \n> //<High-pitched roaring from one of the hallways, similar to that of the lizard-like creature from the initial incursion.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** I need to hide, need to hide...\n> \n> //<Metal banging, followed by Researcher Dylan hyperventilating. Footsteps, combined with a wet, squishy sound, come from the room.>//\n> \n> //<The creature then leaves the room. Researcher Dylan attempts to exit his hiding place, but it will not open.>//\n> \n> **Researcher Dylan:** It— it left behind more of the weird green stuff, like a spider. Webbed the cabinet shut. I guess that's, that's what it's about—\n> \n> //<A shout from Researcher Dylan, followed by the sudden deactivation of the audio recorder. The audio recorder is reactivated 1 minute and 36 seconds later.>//\n> \n> **Researcer Dylan:** —it, my arm, my arm... leaned backwards, and I fell into some... I can't tell. I'm back in the slime room. It somehow took me back to the slime room, what the hell? Where did I come from?\n\nLinked Files - [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4785-exploration-4|\"Sphere\" Incursion]]]",
