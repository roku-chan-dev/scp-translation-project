Class-A amnestics are to be administered to personnel with memories of SCP-3485. In the event that the discovery of SCP-3485 is published, false information is to be disseminated flagging it as a hoax.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3485 is an extranormally large specimen of //Homarus gammarus//, or common lobster, located seventeen light-years away from Earth. SCP-3485 measures approximately 1.57 x 10^^6^^ kilometers from head to tail. For comparison, the Sun is 1.39 x 10^^6^^ kilometers in diameter.\n\nMultiple major differences have been noted between SCP-3485 and non-anomalous lobsters, aside from its massive difference in size. Firstly, the carapace of SCP-3485 is abnormally resistant to damage. In multiple instances, collisions with exo-planets have left no signs of damage. In addition, SCP-3485 shows no signs of burns or radiation damage from its regular, extended contact with small stars.\n\nSecondly, SCP-3485 has a complex digestive system adapted to its esoteric diet. The primary food source of SCP-3485 is residue created by stars during fission reactions, such as leftover hydrogen and helium. SCP-3485 has also been observed to feed on star material by itself; feeding is accomplished using heat-resistant tendons located in its mouth.\n\nTo digest this material, SCP-3485 has an extremely efficient digestive system that uses a poorly understood nuclear reaction to process material. This digestive system is capable of complete mass-energy conversion and produces no waste products.\n\nThirdly, SCP-3485 has an efficient transportation system that negates the need for nutrients and oxygen. The bloodstream of SCP-3485 does not use blood, but rather a highly conductive gaseous solution to transport electrical energy. In addition to this, multiple high-efficiency recycling systems replace regular respiratory procedures responsible for life. This fluid also heats up during energy transportation, generating enough heat to keep SCP-3485 alive, essentially negating the Square Cube Law[[footnote]]Research is being conducted to determine if [[[SCP-2378]]] or [[[SCP-3536]]] violate the Square Cube Law in a similar fashion.[[/footnote]].\n\nFinally, SCP-3485 is capable of instantaneously teleporting itself to other stars to use them as a fuel source. It is unknown how SCP-3485 accomplishes this.\n\nAside from these modifications, SCP-3485 has the same systems as a non-anomalous lobster, although scaled up by several orders of magnitude. SCP-3485 is normally very sluggish, due to its large size and the time required for nervous signals to travel across its body. However, it is unknown how SCP-3485 does not collapse according to the rules of gravity, or how it is biologically immortal.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-3485 was discovered by amateur astronomer Ronald ███████ in 1998. He attempted to publish his findings in a scientific journal, and was met with mass ridicule. The Foundation discovered SCP-3485 after investigating ███████'s findings in 2001.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"View Attachment: History of SCP-3485\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: dashed 1px #2d8bc9; width: 600px; padding: 5px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 35px; background-color: #f4f4f4; border-color: #999999\"]]\n= **EVENT LOG**\n-----\n**09/08/2001:** Atmos Telescope is directed towards [EXACT COORDINATES REDACTED]. SCP-3485 is observed to be feeding off of a smaller star. SCP-3485 is classified in the Foundation database.\n\n**04/05/2003:** SCP-3485 observed to transport itself to another star. First recorded movement of SCP-3485.\n\n**06/07/2004:** SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula. It stays there for 3 hours before returning to its star.\n\n**09/30/2004:** SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula once again.\n\n**08/22/2007:** SCP-3485 transports itself to another star in the [REDACTED] region, and discovers SCP-3485-1 in orbit of it. SCP-3485-1 appears to be the shell of another specimen of SCP-3485.\n\n**06/25/2007:** SCP-3485 transports both itself and SCP-3485-1 to the star it was previously stationed at.\n\n**06/27/2007:** SCP-3485 observed to feed star material directly into SCP-3485-1's mouth.\n\n**08/14/2008:** SCP-3485 transports itself and SCP-3485-1 to the Crab Nebula.\n\n**09/01/2008:** SCP-3485 and SCP-3485-1 return to the previous star.\n\n**10/12/2008:** SCP-3485 attempts to initiate mating rituals with SCP-3485-1 and fails.\n\n**11/12/2008:** SCP-3485 attempts to initiate mating rituals again, and fails.\n\n**11/25/2008:** SCP-3485 uses its claws to create a hole inside of SCP-3485-1, revealing it to be hollow.\n\n**11/26/2008:** SCP-3485 incinerates SCP-3485-1 in the star it is orbiting.\n\n**11/28/2008:** SCP-3485 reaches into the star, possibly in an attempt to recover SCP-3485-1. Its claws are burnt as a result.\n\n**12/05/2008:** SCP-3485 transports itself to the Crab Nebula, and remains there until 04/12/2008.\n\n**04/12/2008:** SCP-3485 transports itself to a third star, and resumes normal behavior.\n\n**05/06/2014 - 05/13/2014:** 2014 expedition to SCP-3485 occurs. Data is gathered.\n\n**09/12/2015:** SCP-3485 transports itself to an area of space in the [REDACTED] region, despite the lack of stars or any discernable food source.\n\n**03/03/2016:** Due to the fact that SCP-3485 has not moved from its area since 2015, and that it might starve itself, the 2016 expedition commences.\n\n**03/05/2016:** Dr. ███████ notes the similarities between the area SCP-3485 inhabits and previous sites of Class C \"Broken Entry\" wormholes.\n\n**03/07/2016:** The 2016 expedition ends.\n\n[[html]]\n<body>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\nbody\n{\n   font-family:verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\n   font-size:12.8px;\n   color:#333;\n   line-height:141%\n}\nblockquote\n{\n  border:1px dashed #999;\n  padding: 0 12.8px;\n  background-color:#f4f4f4\n}\na {\n    color: #b01;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    background: transparent;\n}\na.newpage {\n    color: #d61;\n    text-decoration: none;\n    background: transparent;\n}\na:hover {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n    background-color: transparent;\n}\n.collapsed {\n  display: none;\n}\n.vanished {\n  display: none;\n}\n.image-cap {\n    background-color: #eee;\n    border-top: solid 1px #666;\n    padding: 2px 0;\n    font-size: 80%;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n</style>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nwindow.onload = function() { \n  var today = new Date();\n  var dd = today.getDate();\n  var mm = today.getMonth()+1; //January is 0!\n  var yyyy = today.getFullYear();\n\n  if(dd<10) {\n    dd = '0'+dd\n  } \n\n  if (mm<10) {\n    mm = '0'+mm\n  } \n\n  today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;\n  inayear = '04/07/' + (yyyy + 1);\n  document.getElementById('currentdate').innerHTML = today;\n  document.getElementById('inayear').innerHTML = inayear.\n};\n</script>\n<p><i>Note: As of <span id=\"currentdate\">03/20/2018</span>, SCP-3485 has not moved from its location.
