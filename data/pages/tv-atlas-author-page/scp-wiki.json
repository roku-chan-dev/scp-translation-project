I'm a student and I work a lot, but in between those very exciting and fun parts of my life[[footnote]] End my suffering.[[/footnote]], I write here! You may enjoy my articles if you're into gaming, LGBTQ+ representation, the constant fear that we are small, insignificant pawns in a game that's been going on for eons, or just wacky fun! If you got the time[[footnote]] I've got nothing but time! I'm trapped in an infinite void with no escape! HELP ME![[/footnote]], check out what I've written, I've got time to listen to the feedback.\n\n**My Works**: So the way I write is very straightforward[[footnote]] Limiting.[[/footnote]] and exciting[[footnote]] Dumb.[[/footnote]]! Every single one of my articles follow the same storyline, that storyline being of Senior Researcher Regan Morgan who appears in some capacity in all of my articles. I have a single story I want to tell following her and when I’m done I’ll go into retirement[[footnote]] Become creatively bankrupt.[[/footnote]]. But don’t worry, we got a lot of road ahead of us, so I won’t be going away anytime soon[[footnote]] I’m sorry.[[/footnote]].
