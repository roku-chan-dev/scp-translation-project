Karcists are biologically immortal and possess extremely dangerous carnomantic abilities.[[/span]] are to be used until SCP-7376's anomalous abilities are better understood, at which point they will be altered accordingly.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7376-A is to be terminated within 67 seconds of emergence from SCP-7376-B-2.\n\nTo facilitate SCP-7376-A termination cycles, a containment enclosure—henceforth referred to as the Primary Containment Zone (PCZ)—has been built within SCP-7376-B's central chamber, walling off SCP-7376-B-2 from the rest of the complex. Personnel are not allowed to enter the PCZ during an Awakening Event; all termination apparatus within the PCZ are to be operated remotely by members of Stationary Task Force Alpha-73 (\"Cain-Do Attitude\") from Containment Area-25B's control room.\n\n[[div class=\"term_box\"]]\n\n= **Termination Apparatus**\n\n----\n\n* Electric Deterrence System\n* Omnidirectional Flame Units\n* COGNITOBURST[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**COGNITOBURST:** Experimental memetic weaponry designed to simultaneously transmit cognitohazardous information along six different vectors: sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and telepathy.[[/span]]\n* High-Pressure Industrial Water Cannons (Hydrochloric Acid)\n* Plasma Projectors[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Plasma Projector:** Directed energy paraweapon originating from the Cold War.[[/span]]\n* Congelation Cannons[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Congelation Cannons:** Containment apparatus originally developed for [[[SCP-5657]]].

Efforts are to be made to prevent SCP-7376-A from predicting or adapting to methods of termination.\n\nIf any damage occurs to the PCZ during a termination cycle, STF Alpha-73 is to perform all necessary repairs during SCP-7376-A's dormant phase.\n\nIn the event that SCP-7376-A escapes the PCZ, Mobile Task Force Alpha-76 (\"Ready, Willing, and Abel\") is to utilize corrosive/incendiary weaponry to terminate the anomaly before it can breach containment. If a breach occurs, all surviving members of MTF Alpha-76 are to coordinate with MTF Psi-13 to locate and terminate SCP-7376-A.\n\nSCP-7376-A may not, under any circumstances, be brought into contact with anomalies that expand, augment, improve, or otherwise significantly alter human consciousness/cognition.\n\n__EDIT:__ As of O5 Council's 05/15/2003 decision, SCP-7376-A has provisionally been assigned the secondary class Flor Galana[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Flor Galana:** Item partially contains itself and/or other anomalies, but cannot be fully contained for logistical and/or ethical reasons.[[/span]] and its containment procedures are to be heavily revised.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7376-A is a humanoid anomaly with the appearance of a 30-35 year old man of Middle Eastern descent. Roughly 75% of its skin has been tattooed with thaumaturgic symbols closely associated with long-range carnomancy.\n\nIn the event that SCP-7376-A dies, its body will fully disintegrate within 45-89 seconds. After a dormant phase lasting between 3 days and 2 months, SCP-7376-A will begin an Awakening Event, growing a new body within SCP-7376-B-2 over the course of 13 hours. Upon the Awakening Event's conclusion, SCP-7376-A will exit SCP-7376-B-2 covered in a thin layer of amniotic fluid and dressed in simplistic clothing made of its own skin.\n\nSCP-7376-A is a carnomancer with abilities equivalent to that of a Karcist. It possesses extremely fine control over its body's cells, being able to manipulate skin/bone/muscle/etc. for a variety of offensive and defensive purposes. This, in combination with SCP-7376-A's innumerable years of combat experience and extreme hostility towards any form of imprisonment, has made continuous containment extremely challenging.\n\nSCP-7376-A does, however, possess three critical weaknesses:\n\n1. SCP-7376-A's carnomantic abilities are notably weakened in the first 67 seconds after a completed Awakening Event. Should SCP-7376-A continue to be alive after this period has ended, the likelihood of it escaping the PCZ becomes almost certain.\n\n2. SCP-7376-A is either unwilling or unable to use carnomancy to manipulate the organic tissue of other living things, not even to form a Halkost.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Halkost:** Collective term for anomalous organic entities created and controlled by skilled carnomancers.[[/span]] This is a crucial limitation, as the ability to generate anomalous life has always been a force multiplier in conflicts involving the Nälkä.\n\n3. SCP-7376-A appears to require a certain degree of conscious thought to use the full extent of its carnomantic abilities. As such, using COGNITOBURST to disable or hamper SCP-7376-A's actions has been critical to containment efforts. In the event that SCP-7376-A discovers a way to subvert or avoid COGNITOBURST's effects, the likelihood of continued containment success is predicted to drop by at least 70%.\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-1: Association with the Nälkä**\n\nSCP-7376-A's role in human history is difficult to determine. Many of its (theorized) appearances are attributed under different names and subject to countless years of mythologizing. Reports of individuals matching SCP-7376-A's description have cropped up in nearly every known major war (in addition to over 20 large-scale natural disasters). When mapping out a timeline of SCP-7376-A activity, no discernible pattern has yet been found. SCP-7376-A seems to, at completely random intervals, go into seclusion for irregular lengths of time, after which it involves itself in events that invariably lead to massive loss of life. It is unknown if SCP-7376-A's presence has a causal relationship with these cases of mass death or if SCP-7376-A actively seeks them out.\n\nOnly one historical period has been verified to have involved SCP-7376-A: the Daevite slave rebellion and the subsequent rise of the Kalmaktama Empire.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Kalmaktama Empire:** A Nälkän empire that rose to prominence in the \"golden age\" of the Nälkä.[[/span]] Nälkän religious texts and records almost universally refer to SCP-7376-A as Võlutaar Hevel,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Võlutaar:** Honorific given to a Karcist's advisor. Most Võlutaar are female, to the extent that the word is synonymous with \"wise woman\".[[/span]] a \"warrior-prince\" who came to aid the Nälkä in a time of great need.\n\nMost Nälkä cultural groups consider SCP-7376-A to be the most notable Võlutaar in Nälkän history, believing that it was the only Võlutaar to directly advise Grand Karcist Ion himself. That being said, SCP-7376-A's role within Nälkä culture is not analogous to that of a Klavigar; SCP-7376-A appears to be more of a historical figure than a spiritual one.\n\nNälkä cultural groups generally believe that SCP-7376-A died shortly before or after Grand Karcist Ion's disappearance. In the latter case, the prevailing belief is that SCP-7376-A was killed in Kalmaktama's war with the Mehkanite Empire. In the former case, it is believed that SCP-7376-A sacrificed its life to slay Ab-Leshal, a leviathan spawned by one of Yaldabaoth's Archons.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Ab-Leshal roughly translates to //\"a sky-shaped dream\"// or //\"a flesh-shaped ocean\"//.[[/span]] As few mentions of Ab-Leshal have been found outside accounts of this battle, very little is known about this entity (if it ever existed to begin with).\n\nTo view a full list of historical events with a theorized connection to SCP-7376-A and/or all known Nälkä texts that involve SCP-7376-A, contact Department of History liaison Ajla Hall.\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-2: Project Pandora**\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1890s, the American Secure Containment Initiative (ASCI) began the Omega-7 Initiative (otherwise known as \"Project Pandora\"), a research program with the stated goal of weaponizing anomalies for use in the United States military.\n\nExceedingly little is known about Omega-7, as all unredacted files documenting Omega-7 and personnel involved in the project were lost when its base of operations went dark on 10/15/1899. All remaining Omega-7 documentation has been extensively redacted, as per ASCI's then-policy of information suppression. The following information has been deemed irretrievable:\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Bowe.png\n| caption=Henry Bowe\nASCI Director 1878-1904\n| width=200px\n| align=right]]\n\n* The date Omega-7 was founded.\n* The anomalies used by Omega-7.\n* The location of the Omega-7 facility.\n* The research produced by Omega-7.\n* Omega-7's budget.\n* The identities of Omega-7 staff.\n\nOne fact about Omega-7, however, has been determined with near-certainty. On 10/08/1899, one week before Omega-7 lost contact with the rest of the ASCI, word was received that SCP-7376-A had been brought into containment and was being transported to the Omega-7 facility.\n\nOnly one copy of SCP-7376-A's ASCI documentation has been recovered.\n\n[[div class=\"asci_box\"]]\n\n{{**Item Number:**}} ████{{-}}█{{076}}\n\n{{**Classification Type:** Humanoid/}}████████\n\n----\n\n{{**ASCI Protocols for Containment:**}} ████████ ████████████ ████ ██ █████ ████ ██████████ ████ ████████ ██████████ ██ ████ ████ ████ ██ ████ ██████████ ███████████ ███ ██████████ █████████ ███ ██████████ ███ ██████████ ███████████ ██████ █ ███ █████ ███ █████ ████████ ███ ██ ██████ █████\n\n██████ ███████ ████████████ █████████ ████ ████████████ ██████ █████████ ████ ██ ███ ███ ███████ █ ████████ ███████████ ██████ ███ ████████████ ██████████ ██ ███ █████ ██████████ ███ ██ ████ ████ ███ ███ █████ █████████ ██████\n\n{{**Description:**}} ████████ ██ █ ████████████ ████████████ ███████ ████████ ██ ██████ █████ ███ █████ ████████ ████████ ██████ ██ █████████ ████████ ██ ███ ██████████ ██ █████ ███████ █████████ ███ ██████████ ███████ █████████████ ████ ██ ████████████ ██████████ ███ ██████████ ██ ███ ██████████ █████████ ██ ████████ ███ █ ████████ ██ ███ ██████ █████ ██ ████ █████ ███ ████████ ███ ███████ ██████ █████ ██ ███ ██████████████ ██████████ ████ ██████████ █████████ ███ █████ ███████████ ████████ █████████ █████ ████ ████ █████ ██████████ ████ █████ ███ ████████████ ████████████ █████████ ███ ██████ ████████████\n\n{{**Nota Bene:**}} ███ ████ █████████ █████ █████ ██ ███ ████████ ██ █████████ ██████ ████ ███ ████ ██ ███████ ███ █████████ █████████ ████ ███ ███████ █████ {{attempting to alter subject's subconscious to}} ███ ██████████ ███ ██ ███ █████ ██ █████ █████ ███ █████████ ███████ ██ ██████████ ██ █ ███████ ███ ██ █ ██████ █████ ███ ██████ ███████ █ ██████ ██ {{consequently, developed an immunity to fatal cognitohazards}} ███████ ██ ███ ██████ ███ ███ █████ ███ ████ █████████ ███ ██ ██████████ ████ ████ ██ █████ ████████ ████ ███ ███ ██ ███ ██████ ████ ████████ ████████████ ██████ ████ {{level 9 earthquake on the Rossi–Forel scale detected near secondary facility in}} ██████{{, Russia}} ██ █████ ███ ███████ ████ ███████ █ █████ ██ █████ ████ ████ ██████ ██ ██ ████ ███ ██ ███ █████ ██████ ███████ {{abandoned testing effective immediately}} █████████ █████ ███████ ██ ██████████ ██ █████ ███ ██████ ███ ███ ████████ █████████\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-3: Interview Log C2**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 04/02/2000\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7376-C\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Safiya Light //(Director, Tactical Theology)//\n\n----\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** If I am to speak of my brother, I must first provide context.\n\nI was not the first man to be born, though my people—the citizens of the great kingdom Edinnu—were perhaps among the first. Edinnu was not a vast domain, but it held claim to a great nexus of commerce and a fierce enough army to keep the [[[daevite-hub | Daeva]]] away from our borders.\n\nMy mother was Lilith, Edinnu's queen. She was an incredible sorceress, taught by the Serpent itself. Such was the strength of her magic, that each word she spoke resonated with the mutterings of thunder. My father was Adam, an escaped slave of the Daevite high gardens. Despite the circumstances of how he learned the craft, he never did lose his love of gardening--I remember him as being a very gentle man.\n\n**Dr. Light:** Sounds like quite an odd couple.\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** //[Chuckling.]// They were, indeed--but they found their own sort of equilibrium.\n\nThey raised me in Edinnu's capital, Paradisum. It was called The City Beneath Two Trees, as when it was first founded, my parents planted a pair of seeds at its heart: one, the seed of an ash tree from the Wanderer's Library and the other, a seed from the high gardens that had been cleansed of all Daevite corruption. It was a truly beautiful place...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\nAnyway, I was the eldest of five children. I got along fine with each of my younger siblings—Set, Awan, and Azura—but I was always closest to Hevel, the secondborn of my family.\n\nHevel was... to say he was an inspiration is to shame him with faint praise. He was the best of us. A skilled warrior, a cunning strategist, a brilliant artist... he would even come to inherit a fragment of my mother's voice. Though he lacked the talent for magecraft, he, to her endless pride, learned to enchant his words so that all living things, even simple beasts, could understand his speech. And above all else, he was endlessly, genuinely //kind//. The kindest person I have ever known.\n\n**Dr. Light:** You admired him.\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** I //resented// him. He was everything I could not be—everything I had never //tried// to be out of base fear and apathy. I cared for him, yes—but that resentment was always smoldering in the back of my mind.\n\nAs we grew, it became clear that Hevel was likely to inherit my mother's throne, despite my being the firstborn. Knowing this, knowing that it was because he truly deserved it, had done far more to earn such station, fanned the embers of that resentment into a flame of animosity.\n\nThen one day, my family received a message from none other than Grand Karcist Ion, appealing for our assistance in his rebellion against the enslaving Daevites. It was a message that went unanswered; for all my mother's strength, she knew that we had only kept the Daeva away by being too much of a hassle to overthrow. To affiliate ourselves with the Grand Karcist would be nothing less than a declaration of war--a war we would likely not survive. My father was of the same mind. Though his heart bled for his kinsmen, his duty to the people of Edinnu came first.\n\nThat night, Hevel came to me in secret, his countenance etched with doubt. Though he had never lived the life of a Daevite slave, he had always felt connected to them through our father. They were family to him, even if only as distant relations, and he could not stand the thought of their endless suffering. Now that he had heard their plea for help, he could no longer continue to do nothing--but he did not know what to do.\n\nWhen he asked for my advice, I am ashamed to say that I saw only opportunity. I told him that our parents would never allow him to fight for the Daevite slaves as a prince of Edinnu--but if he were to leave in secret, representing not a kingdom but his own will... who knows what he could accomplish?\n\n\"And if you are to die,\" I did not say. \"Killed by some nameless soldier on a distant battlefield, leaving behind an empty throne for your older, more deserving brother... then all the better.\"\n\nAnd he believed me.\n\nYears passed. I do not remember how many. A decade, maybe. Perhaps two.\n\nEventually, the day came when I heard word that Hevel, the conquering prince, had returned. Filled with a sickening mixture of joy and disappointment and shame, I rushed from the palace to greet him.\n\nWe reunited just as he crossed the city's far borders, meeting in a field on the outskirts of Paradisum. And I...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Dr. Light:** That's when it happened, wasn't it?\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** He told me that he had succeeded in his quest. He had helped free the victims of the cruel Daeva--and more than that. He had met the Grand Karcist, and in doing so had come to forge a bond I did not understand. He had been named the Ozi̮rmok's Võlutaar.\n\nI heard this and knew—with total certainty—that in trying to win back my throne, I had only crushed what little chance I had. In becoming a true hero of the people, in bonding with the leader of a nation that was on the verge of becoming the most powerful in the known world, the throne was already as good as his.\n\nI knew this, and in my fear and hatred and rage and all-consuming //entitlement//, I...\n\nI told him that I was overjoyed to see him returned safe to us. That I was proud of him. That we would return to the palace together. And when he turned to walk alongside me, I picked up a heavy stone from the field and...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\nWell. Everyone knows how this story ends.\n\n**Dr. Light:** Is that really how it ended?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** No. That is when the trouble truly began.\n\n**Dr. Light:** Tell me what happened next.\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** My crime was quickly discovered. I was stripped of my family name, cursed twice over, and banished. So I...\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\nWhat you need to understand is that I wasn't particularly remorseful, back then. I was not--an entirely pleasant person, in my youth. I regretted what I had done, certainly. I regretted getting caught, regretted losing my station and my family, but as for proper guilt for the harm I had caused?\n\n//[SCP-7376-C makes a seesaw motion with his hand.]//\n\nThe feeling wasn't //absent//, but it was not at the front of my mind, either. So when Hevel died, I saw it less as a wrongdoing demanding penance and more a problem needing solution.\n\n**Dr. Light:** You wanted to bring Hevel back to life.\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** It was not as difficult as I imagined it would; the hardest part would be in the grave robbing.\n\nAfter I had obtained Hevel's corpse, I found an necro-chemist to stop its decomposition and undo what little rot it had already endured.\n\nThen, I bought the services of a spirit-caller to pull Hevel's soul from the ether and bind it to his body. Normally, such an act should only be possible in the first few moments after death, but the souls of those who died violently tend to linger for a time... especially so for those killed by their loved ones.\n\nAll that remained was to give him a spark of life... but I was greedy. Just resurrecting him wasn't enough for me.\n\nAnd so I began my journey to Adytum, capital city of Kalmaktama.

The Foundation has taken a strict policy of non-interaction with the anomaly, which has prevented detailed research from taking place. This is what is known for certain about SCP-7376-Ω:\n\n* SCP-7376-Ω is in a state of deep dormancy. Its resting heartbeat is currently at 2 beats per day and its body temperature is only a few degrees higher than the surrounding rock.\n* SCP-7376-Ω's emergence would, at minimum, lead to the decimation of Eurasia and the irrevocable disruption of Earth's magnetosphere.\n* SCP-7376-Ω and SCP-7376-A possess identical DNA.\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-4-1: Interview Log C3**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 04/02/2000\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7376-C\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Safiya Light //(Director, Tactical Theology)//\n\n----\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** I didn't just want to \"merely\" bring my brother back to life; I wanted to resurrect him in such a way that would save him from ever being killed again. Like a child who hides the evidence of their wrongdoing beneath their bed, I thought undoing my mistake would unmake everything that followed it.\n\nI traveled to the Grand Karcist and when I showed him Hevel's body, I asked him to impart a fragment of what he had given his Karcists, his Klavigar. The carnomantic gift that can mend any wound, press the hands of age backwards.\n\nAnd he said yes. He didn't even hesitate. I think my brother, in his many years away, had become very important to the Ozi̮rmok--or perhaps Ion saw the wisdom in giving the future king of Edinnu immortality, ensuring that an alliance between nations would be just as enduring. I would not assume to know his motivations.\n\nBut something went wrong.\n\nTo this day, I do not know why. A Daevite curse or some other malignant magic, perhaps, had interfered with the spell. Or Ion made a mistake somehow, pouring too much of himself into the casting. Or death had changed Hevel on a fundamental level, to such a degree that magic that should've matched his soul perfectly now met it as sodium metal meets a dirty puddle.\n\nWhatever the reason, in the instant that his heart started beating, his body began to grow. And grow. And grow. The carnomancy placed inside him boiled out of control like a cancer. By the time the Great Karcist had realized what was happening, it was too late; there was no taking away a gift he had already given.\n\nHevel became vast. A landscape of skin and sinew. And in this new body, he could only thrash about in cataclysmic fits. The Grand Karcist would later tell me that while his body had dramatically increased in size, his consciousness had not changed in shape. Hevel's body was too large for his thoughts and he was lost in his own depths.\n\nIt was then, when Ion made the temple of Ab-Leshal. He buried Hevel in the earth and placed a living tomb atop him, which wrapped thick roots around his brainstem to rock him into an endless dream... all in the hope that one day, against all odds, he'd find his way back to the surface.\n\nAnd he did... many, //many// years later.\n\nThat's what he is. A waking dreamer. The Hevel people know is a puppet. A human-shaped vessel for his human-shaped consciousness. An avatar he experiences the world through. Whenever he dies, his true body simply grows a new one once his mind resurfaces.\n\n**Dr. Light:** Did Hevel ever forgive you?\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** No. Dying, being alone in that ocean of a body for centuries, losing our family and the Grand Karcist... all of it changed him. I do not deserve his forgiveness, of course--but he is no longer the kind man I knew.\n\nI don't know what he is, now. Something cruel and callous. A danger to everyone around him. A thing in dire need of containment.\n\nYou //will// contain him, won't you?\n\n**Dr. Light:** We always do, Cain.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-5: O5 Proposal 7376**\n\nOn 05/15/2003, Dr. Daniel ███████, Director of ETTRA, made a proposal to the O5 Council regarding the weaponization of SCP-7376-A.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nSCP-7376-A's current containment procedures are unsustainable; \"Abel\" has been getting closer and closer to a breach with each termination cycle we put him through. As he clearly has continuity of memory between incarnations, we've essentially spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to train SCP-7376-A how to fight us. So long as he possesses the ability to grow a new body after death, containment simply isn't feasible--and I'm sure you understand why interfering with his resurrection mechanism would only open up a much larger can of worms.\n\nI propose that we recruit SCP-7376-A for use in the containment of other high-risk anomalies. If we can't force him to remain within containment, we'll need to find a way to get him to stay willingly. In regards to providing SCP-7376-A with a sufficient recruitment incentive, refer to my attached proposal regarding GoI-610.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ YEA  ||~ NAY  ||~ ABSTAIN ||\n|| || ||= O5-01 ||\n||= O5-02 || || ||\n|| ||= O5-03 || ||\n||= O5-04 || || ||\n|| ||= O5-05 || ||\n||= O5-06 || || ||\n||= O5-07 || || ||\n|| ||= O5-08 || ||\n|| || ||= O5-09 ||\n||= O5-10 || || ||\n|| ||= O5-11 || ||\n|| ||= O5-12 || ||\n||= O5-13 || || ||\n@@ @@\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| ##057800|APPROVED## ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum 7376-A-6: Initial Negotiation**\n\nDue to their familial relationship, SCP-7376-C was requested to perform the initial negotiations with SCP-7376-A regarding its recruitment. SCP-7376-C displayed strong hesitance, but agreed after being informed that, due to the violent nature of its containment, SCP-7376-A would likely assault any individual it did not recognize while inside SCP-7376-B.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 06/07/2003\n\n//[The bulk of the following exchange was performed in an unidentified language, which SCP-7376-C translated from memory shortly afterward.]//\n\n----\n\n//[The PCZ is emptied of all termination apparatus. The only objects in the room are SCP-7376-B-2, set of chairs, and a small table on which a stack of papers has been set. SCP-7376-C sits at the table, facing SCP-7376-B-2. A door has been installed in the wall behind him. A faint organic pulsing sound is audible as the ongoing Awakening Event nears its conclusion.]//\n\n//[The Awakening Event ends; SCP-7376-A stumbles out of SCP-7376-B-2. Its skin has been hardened by carnomancy, giving it an bright red hue. Its limbs are edged with razor-sharp bone. Amniotic fluid steams off of it. SCP-7376-A looks around wildly, evidently ready for a fight and disoriented by the lack of immediate assault. It appears to have not yet consciously registered SCP-7376-C's presence.]//\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** Hello, Hevel.\n\n//[SCP-7376-A visibly startles.]//\n\n**SCP-7376-A:** //You.//\n\n//[SCP-7376-A storms towards SCP-7376-C, looming over him from the other side of the table. SCP-7376-C looks back at it evenly.]//\n\n**SCP-7376-C:** It's been a long time.\n\n**SCP-7376-A:** Not nearly long enough.

In the moment of SCP-7376-C's impact, thin cracks form along the left side of SCP-7376-A's head.]//\n\n//[Though he lacks any wounds, SCP-7376-C crumples to the ground, clutching his head in apparent pain.
