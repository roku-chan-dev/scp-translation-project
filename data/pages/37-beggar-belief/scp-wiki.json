It struck McInnis as an interesting progressive imbalance, how as the number of their enemies declined the number of indispensable allies increased. They were now meeting in the Chairs and Chiefs boardroom, though not all of the Chairs and Chiefs were present. There was going to be a lot of re-shuffling once the Site was made fully operational again -- a concept that just weeks prior had seemed impossibly far fetched, pie in the sky nonsense. But sitting in the same room with Desagondensta, Thilo Zwist, Arik Euler, Lillian Lillihammer, Noé Nascimbeni, Delfina Ibanez, Harry Blank, Melissa Bradbury, Eileen Veiksaar, Nhung Ngo, Udo Okorie, Karen Elstrom, Xinyi Du, Trevor Bremmel, Brenda Corbin, Gedeon Van Rompay and even William Wettle, with a video connection to Ilse Reynders in the ADDC, it was possible to dream big.\n\nThe ASC was on the same page. \"We're left with one major hurdle, friends. But it's a very high bar.\"\n\n\"One?\" Nascimbeni frowned. \"I count two.\"\n\n\"They're a single problem.\" Ibanez was cracking her knuckles. \"Gwilherm hasn't reacted to losing the others, which //might// mean she hasn't even noticed, but it might also mean she just plain doesn't care. Radcliffe will be a different matter. We kill him, she shows up. Simple as that.\"\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\" Van Rompay asked.\n\n\"They're quantum linked.\" This from Du, the most qualified to speak on the subject. \"It's the only possible explanation. There's some sort of entanglement allowing him to sense what she's up to, and we can operate on the assumption that it works both ways.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Okorie met each of their eyes in turn. \"That stuff he's always talking about, his fantasy of her marching around and liberating the world? He could just be making it all up.\"\n\n\"You ever meet the guy?\" Harry retorted. \"He didn't have a creative bone in his body. He read bodybuilding mags in his time off.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah.\" Wettle smiled with apparently pleasant reminiscence. \"She told me about that.\"\n\n\"Please,\" Harry groaned.\n\n\"She said I was a nice change of pace, and slapped my nip--\"\n\n\"PLEASE STOP.\"\n\n\"No, go on,\" Lillihammer encouraged. \"I'm going to record this as a kill agent.\"\n\n\"Well...\"\n\nThe ASC gestured at the new speaker. \"Dr. Ngo?\"\n\n\"We've already done a little work on this. Dr. Wettle, could you describe your sexual relationship with Agent Gwilherm in detail, please?\"\n\nHarry gaped at her. \"No. Come on, why? No!\"\n\n\"Uh, well, she was always on t--\"\n\n\"We're not doing this.\"\n\nNgo smiled sympathetically... no, //empathetically.// \"Dr. Blank, I'm sorry, but this is vital data.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious.\"\n\n\"I miss the old you,\" Veiksaar grumbled. \"He wasn't such a prude.\"\n\n\"I'm not a prude! I just don't want to picture Gwilherm slapping Willie's nipples!\"\n\n\"Per your report,\" McInnis interrupted, \"this information is available any time you wish to retrieve it, Dr. Ngo. While the group is assembled, however, it might be useful for you to explain //why// you might wish to.\"\n\n\"It's a simple solution, I think. We need to kill two birds with one stone, right?\"\n\n\"We most certainly do,\" the ASC agreed. \"Or at the very least, if we can only kill one, it needs to be her.\"\n\n\"Well, I've been talking to Dr. Corbin about the nature of their link, and what Dr. Du just said has more or less confirmed my suspicions. Brenda, would you like to explain?\"\n\nCorbin kicked her feet up on the table. She wasn't one to stand, or even sit, on ceremony. \"Love to. We've been recording everything Radcliffe says from the start, or rather the memeticists have. Scanning for cognitohazards. There's nothing there. \"\n\nLillihammer nodded. \"'There's nothing there' is a fair description of the content of those messages, for sure.\"\n\n\"From the perspective of rational science, sure. Luckily, I'm an irrational scientist.\"\n\n\"High five,\" Okorie cheered.\n\n\"I prefer down low.\" Corbin winked. Okorie blushed.\n\nThe theologian continued. \"Radcliffe's messages are suffused with what I can only describe as a religious rapture. He's enamoured with Gwilherm like a priest loves their god. Perfect devotion. He's smitten and in awe and more than a little afraid, and he's projecting that out into space.\"\n\n\"Quite literally,\" Veiksaar added.\n\nThe ASC blinked at her. \"Meaning?\"\n\n\"The comms tower is transmitting his messages across the globe.\"\n\n\"How is that possible?\" McInnis demanded. \"Surely you control the information going through those systems, after the events of last month.\"\n\n\"We would be,\" Veiksaar said, \"if they were travelling through the cables like they're supposed to. But they aren't. We can trace the infosignature of each message moving along the wire, but shutting everything down doesn't stop them. We even tried cutting the cables. They jumped the gap. We'd have to take the whole thing down to so much as delay one of his transmissions.\"\n\n\"So do it,\" Lillihammer said. \"Cut the whole thing down.\"\n\n\"First of all,\" Veiksaar bristled, \"that tower is our link with the rest of the world.\"\n\n\"Second of all,\" Ngo piled on, \"that would interfere with my plan.\"\n\n\"Your plan,\" Lillihammer snarled, \"which incorporates nipple-slapping as a vital component.\"\n\nHarry was sighing non-stop now. \"Can we start using euphemisms, please?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to need to get considerably more explicit before this is over,\" Ngo's apology sounded genuine.\n\n\"Because we're gonna have to knock that bitch off the pedestal he put her on.\" Corbin mimed a fly-swatting.\n\n\"Why?\" Bremmel asked.\n\n\"Because he's the reason she's invincible.\"\n\nNascimbeni knitted his brows. \"Explain that statement.\"\n\n\"He believes she is, so she is. What he wants her to be, she //becomes.// That's his power. He's the only one we never figured out.\"\n\nEuler's forehead was creasing up too. \"This is... a guess?\"\n\n\"It's a fact,\" Corbin stated with conviction. \"Radcliffe's transmissions also carry a strong Akiva wave. Belief energy.\"\n\nHarry was exploring his wisdom teeth gaps with his tongue. \"He's making her what she is?\"\n\n\"No, but he's bolstering it. Boosting her signal, with his. She was already deadly when she was here, but she's the Earth-shattering superweapon we've been watching these past months because she's carrying both of their powers at once.\"\n\nLillihammer looked pleased. \"Under every strong woman's boot, there's a man saying he deserves it.\"\n\n\"And how do you plan to make use of this information?\" Ibanez wanted to know.\n\nNgo looked tired, uncomfortable, but most of all, confident. \"We give the man a crisis of faith.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 20 November\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\"It's ready.\" Ngo was massaging her temples.\n\nMcInnis gestured for her to take a seat across from the desk. His desk. He'd found himself stroking the polished surface when nobody was watching. He was no materialist, but allowed a little sentiment to filter in when he felt it could do him no harm. \"Are you feeling alright, doctor?\"\n\nShe looked embarrassed. \"I know I'm overreacting. It was just... it was just kind of a //lot.//\"\n\n\"I understand. Please get some rest.\"\n\n\"With respect sir, I think I need to know how this plays out. You might still need my expertise, and anyway I'm perversely interested to see if it upsets her as much as it upset me.\"\n\nHe chuckled. It was the only laugh he could summon on demand. \"Do you know, the old Council used to have people they called 'factotums' whose role was to stand in for them when they couldn't be around?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Makes sense.\"\n\n\"I think I would like for all of us to adopt something similar. So that we might all go for a collective three-day snooze when this is over.\"\n\nNgo had no problem bursting into genuine laughter, and she did so now. \"I find myself in perfect agreement with you, sir.

Fluorescent fixtures in the ceiling, cave walls polished smooth, cast concrete panels along the left side. The secret fourth sublevel was the same in this reality as the last, right down to the seven characters scored out of the metal of the single closed door.\n\nAs before, she'd had to take mnestics to figure out the requisite elevator commands. As before, she had a flash of Yésica leaping to her doom at Zevala, now compounded with a vision of her earlier trip to find nothing very much at all at the end of a long and winding evidence trail.\n\nThis time, however, it was going to be different.\n\nWhat better hiding place could there possibly be at Site-43?\n\nShe unclipped her keycard from her belt, and slid it through the attached reader. The air exchangers hissed as the door swung open. \n\nThe lights flickered on to reveal…\n\nStewart Radcliffe, kneeling on the tiles, large as life and stark naked. His back was arched, palms planted on the floor, head bent back in a bizarre inversion of prayer. Ibanez didn't frequent the S&C communal showers, for a variety of reasons, so this was a sight she had never seen. A volleyball tournament at Ipperwash Beach had given her a good, long look at the man's upper torso, waxed and hairless and full of smooth, healthy ripples, not steroidal but the result of years and years of long, hard work and heavy lifting. Her only point of comparison was Howard Yancy, who was in comparable shape, and with whose shape she'd on several occasions allowed herself to become overfamiliar...\n\n//Stop ogling the genocidal maniac// wasn't something she'd ever expected to have to tell herself, but she told herself now.\n\nRadcliffe was murmuring. They'd long since muted his internal broadcasts, which had the effect of completely negating their memetic payloads, but he clearly hadn't gotten the memo.\n\nHe didn't even notice her presence. That was fine. She placed the portable wireless speaker on the wall, made sure the instant-curing glue would hold, then closed the containment cell door again. She'd post a guard, but it probably wouldn't be necessary. Like the living corpse he'd left behind in baseline, the big man was rooted in place.\n\nShe didn't key her radio until she was back on the elevator. \"Chief Ibanez calling Director...\" She slapped it to her forehead, and tried again. \"Calling Administrator McInnis.\"\n\n\"McInnis.\"\n\n\"He's here. We go for prep?\"\n\nAnother, much deeper voice came over the line. \"This is the All-Sections Chief. The homefires are burning at Kettle Point. My friends will be waiting with open arms.\"\n\n\"Hope they won't have occasion to regret their hospitality,\" she said. \"Over.\"\n\nKettle Point was a nice place to visit, but she didn't want to die there.\n\nNot that she'd be going.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 22 November\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nIt took a long time to evacuate Site-43 via the secret facilities beneath AAF-A. Ibanez had warned her people to be on the lookout for the mad scientist, Wynn Rydderech, but he didn't make an appearance. Lillihammer had suggested he'd been actively holding the bedrock of the Site together, that Gwilherm's initial presence would have blown the entire thing asunder if he hadn't been, and that it was taxing his reality-bending powers to the max to continually negate that explosive fact. But Okorie had seen him, he had even deigned to speed her on her way, so it was strange that he failed to put in an appearance now.\n\nPerhaps, Euler suggested, the memetic resonator was to blame. If Rydderech //was// the bedrock...\n\nHe'd dropped the idea after seeing the look on Zwist's face. The old man had enough weighing on his conscience already.\n\nIn the end, a few hundred people made their way through the magical factory and out to the vast, stinking wasteland that had once been Lake Huron. The indigenous peoples living on the rises above would take care of them for as long as it was in their power to do so, gracious hosts on their own native land. It was a curious inversion of power dynamics which made many of McInnis' advisors cynically pleased, Harry most of all; he was already writing the chapter of his apocalypse history detailing the final, decisive settlement of the Ipperwash land claim issue.\n\nAll that remained was to make sure there would be future generations to read it, and honour the obligations described therein.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was past time for the final group to gather at their mustering point and make the trip to Rydderech's sprawling playground. Eileen was handling the announcements manually, and she'd somehow failed to send the last one. Harry was all but alone in the server hall, gathering up the last of his belongings into a knapsack, so Ibanez had radioed him to drop in and see what the holdup was.\n\nAs he passed the now-unmanned logistics desk, he heard something strange. Like a bicycle wheel spinning without enough grease... no, more like an overclocked cast iron water pump... //no,// it was that sound his parrot had made when periodically humping the side of her cage. He'd always hated that. As he approached the beaded curtain, he realized he was hearing a human voice. Eileen was throwing the tantrum to end all tantrums in her little warren. Probably the messaging system had collapsed, and that had been the last straw for her. She still hadn't fixed her sleep situation, the stimulants that had kept her going refusing to leave her system. It sounded like she was in physical, emotional, maybe even intellectual pain in there. He pressed through the beads, then pushed back the velvet...\n\n...and a //foot// was planted on his chest, and it //thrust// at him, and he was sent flying backward to land on his ass.

She'd come on repeatedly too strong, and he'd made it clear that they were no longer in any sense together, and honestly she'd been a trouper to hold it together this long. But it felt like the lizard brain should be lodging an objection right about now, and yet it wasn't.\n\n\"Group 39, you are now clear to depart.\" Eileen's voice on the intercom sounded cheerful, upbeat, refreshed. Relaxed. \"Repeat, Group 39, depart now.\" The audio cut out just as a snippet of Radcliffe cut in, the orphaned word 'Friends!' echoing throughout H&S.\n\nThe Site was still a shambles. Well over half of the systems didn't work, there was structural instability all over, countless dorms and offices were uninhabitable. But when this final challenge had been overcome -- he refused to think of it as a question of 'if' -- the long process of getting resettled would begin.\n\nHis feet were already taking him somewhere he wasn't meant to go. He was part of Group 39. He was to accompany his notes, archival, historical and artistic, north to Kettle Point for preservation in case the plan went south. But he knew he could radio in and cancel if he wanted to; as a member of the inner circle, he now had seniority over everyone involved with the evacuation. So before he made the decision, he took a final detour.\n\nAs he had on September 8, 2002, he walked to Melissa Bradbury's office.\n\nIt was spotless. Untouched. She'd had the unfathomably excellent luck to own one of the few unmolested workspaces in the entire facility. It looked like nobody had set foot in there since she'd evacuated to I&T. She was in the process of stuffing a woolen scarf into an athletic bag when he walked in, knocking on the doorframe to announce his presence.\n\nShe looked up, and smiled. \"Good evening, dear.\"\n\nHe smiled back at her. \"It's not bad.\"\n\n\"You ready to go?\" She selected a few books off the nearest shelf, and packed them in the end pocket.\n\n\"The last group is leaving now.\" It wasn't an answer, and by the look on her face, she knew it. \"How come you're still packing?\"\n\nShe smiled sheepishly. \"You're going to be angry.\"\n\n\"You're packing because I'm going to be angry?\" He mocked up an expression of sorrow. \"Melissa, we can work this out, I promise. Don't leave me.\"\n\nShe laughed, pulled the scarf out of the bag, and threw it at him. \"Weirdo.\"\n\nHe put the scarf around his neck. \"Seriously, though. What am I going to be angry about?\"\n\n\"I hate camping.\"\n\nHe waited.\n\nAnd waited. \"That's it?\"\n\n\"That's it. There's bugs out there, Harry. I don't like bugs. And my skin burns easily.\" She was practically paper-pale. \"And I was thinking, you know, there's an awful lot of dorms down here...\"\n\n\"...and if the plan doesn't work and they butcher us all, a few kilometres won't make that much of a difference...\"\n\nShe laughed again. \"Okay, I guess you're //not// going to be angry. How come?\"\n\n\"The truth?\"\n\n\"Yeah. The truth.\"\n\nHe took off the scarf, walked over to her, and placed it on top of the bag. \"Because it's a lot farther to Kettle Point than it is to your dorm room.\"\n\nAlmost seven years of unrealized possibility floated in the space between them.\n\nSo he moved into that space, and brushed it aside. He put one hand on the back of her jacket, his jacket, //their// jacket. She raised an eyebrow. He leaned forward quickly, and she bent back an equal amount, letting him support her weight, trusting him. He looked down at her. She looked up at him, chin squashed against her neck, expression comically curious.\n\n\"Are we dancing?\" she asked him.\n\n\"We've been dancing,\" he told her, \"for too god damn long.\"\n\nShe pursed her lips, laughter in every line.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Dorm room's kinda far, too.\"\n\nHe burst out laughing, and so did she, and since their mouths were now both open anyway...\n\nFor good measure, he swept her off her feet.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nStewart Radcliffe was lying in rapture, eyes to God, as he always was.

But today she will set sail, bring the future from new to old, fulfilling the circle of civilization. The tides pull death to life again, from one end of the Earth to the other. It is poetry.

It was ritual more than anything.\n\nFlora was asleep in Gallo's tent. The sun was going down. There was music on the wind, coming from the jamboree across the water. They both liked the distant sound more than they would have enjoyed taking part. \n\nThat was one of the many things they had in common.\n\nOnce again, without even thinking about it, Nascimbeni put his arm around his son's shoulders. The gesture was again reciprocated, and they fished fruitlessly in silence until the stars came out. After a while, Gallo realized that his father was softly sobbing.\n\n\"What happened?\" he asked. \"What happened to you, dad?\"\n\n\"I let something go.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.\" He looked up at the stars. \"That's not true.

This was his last day behind the desk; starting tomorrow, it would belong to William Wettle. The man who entered was curly-haired and handsome, though a little unkempt and frazzled, wearing an unfamiliar black and red labcoat and a very grave expression. \"Good afternoon, Doctor…?\n\n\"Are you familiar with [[span color=\"blue\"]]Protocol 4000-Eshu[[/span]]?\"\n\nMcInnis blinked. The man was telling him, without telling him, that there was something very wrong with his name. A communications-based anomaly. That was interesting.\n\n\"What might I do for you, doctor?\"\n\n\"I thought I might do something for you, actually. You've had a rather rough go in this neck of the woods, if you get my drift.\"\n\nThe Administrator felt his face contorting with the effort to get the next few sentences right. It was possible to get himself in very serious trouble with just one misplaced word. \"You speak of woods. You are referring to **[[span style=\"color:green\"]]the sylvan trickster haven[[/span]]**?\" He'd done it right. He'd named the thing without losing his own name. He despised semiohazards.\n\nThe other man laughed. \"No, sorry. The woods of which I spoke were metaphorical. But you're correct that naming me would be a mistake.\"\n\nMcInnis watched for any sign of prevarication on that score, and found none. He could trust the strange doctor on the subject of his own appellation, at the very least. \"Well then. Since you're unlikely to be referring to Lambton County, I suspect your scope is rather larger. I was wondering if we'd ever get a visit from your people; we've badly felt the lack of a temporal consult these past months.\"\n\nThis hunch, unlike the other, was apparently correct. The man visibly relaxed, knowing that his meaning was clear. \"It took a lot of hard work and sacrifice to get here, I can assure you. This timeline is all but inaccessible from its timeplane of origin.\"\n\n\"And why is that?\"\n\n\"The nature of its separation, no doubt.\" The TAD agent shrugged. \"It wasn't a typical branching.\"\n\n\"The concept of a typical timeline branch fills me with dread.\"\n\nThe other man chuckled unconvincingly. \"You see as many as I have, you learn not to worry. One gets a feel for similarities. Patterns. Which way the sides of the cube have rotated away from their starting positions. There's a lot to be learned from that, though obviously the differences are much more instructive.\"\n\n\"You don't mind if I run your credentials?\" McInnis asked.\n\nThe other man smiled. \"Of course not.\" He passed over a white card with a pair of concentric circles imprinted on it.\n\nMcInnis inserted it into his jury-rigged 43NET terminal. \"Mm. They don't match our records.\"\n\n\"As they shouldn't,\" the man agreed. \"Mine are up to date, while yours are rather behind.\"\n\n\"This says you're based out of Site-15.\"\n\n\"Not for a long while.\"\n\n\"I take it you don't originate from this reality, then.\"\n\n\"No. I do not.\"\n\nMcInnis pushed the terminal away. \"I regret to inform you that the individual to whom these credentials more properly belong has been reported deceased.\"\n\nThe other man nodded. \"I had feared as much, but thank you for the confirmation. Have you seen any survivors from Site-15?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" McInnis admitted. \"There may not have been any. What happened there was… thorough.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't have had much use for my other self anyway. The question, sir, is this: do you have a use for me?\"\n\nMcInnis considered. \"That depends on what you're here to offer.\"\n\n\"Counsel on the nature of your reality.\"\n\n\"And in return?\"\n\n\"This isn't a transaction. We serve the same cause.\"\n\n\"The Foundation in this timeline has essentially been destroyed. I'm heading a sort of… second iteration.\"\n\n\"I wasn't referring to the Foundation, writ small. I was referring to the Coalition.\"\n\nMcInnis felt his eyes widen by millimetres. \"Do you represent them?\"\n\nThe other man nodded. \"I'm authorized to develop my own impressions of your situation, and convey them as part of a potential membership review.\"\n\n\"You most certainly have my attention.\"\n\n\"I am presently under the impression that your timeline is unstable, derived as it is from an unprecedented and very messy temporal event.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I am also unconvinced that your goals and methods fully align with the Coalition's. You have deviated significantly from the //modus operandi// you inherited from your former Overseers.\"\n\n\"And I intend further deviations. The way we once operated was shaped by decades of practice developed in service of a wide variety of goals, not all of them remotely noble. This is a chance to begin from scratch, from first principles.\"\n\n\"Admittedly the Foundation has little claim to be //principled,// considering some of its methods, but still. Your membership in the Multi-Foundation Coalition is at risk here.\"\n\n\"We haven't heard a word from them since the initial event took place. So far as I was concerned, we had either been rendered inaccessible or abandoned. I'm not sure what purpose is served by swooping in once we've begun putting the pieces back together, and telling us we're not playing by the rules. Those rules were made for a different game.\" He remembered Mukami's harangue on the topic of that particular turn of phrase, and chose not to examine it further. Yet.\n\n\"On a multiversal scale,\" the TAD man told him, \"what happened here was essentially without significance.\"\n\nMcInnis steepled his fingers on the blotter. \"I weigh my actions on a human scale.\"\n\n\"Then let's address that level of gravity, shall we? Your timeline is distinguished from all others on record to an exceedingly high degree over the past year. That's good. That means it's more likely to survive as an independent entity. That means the people who haven't already died have a chance of not winking out of existence.\"\n\n\"That would be my preference,\" McInnis nodded.\n\n\"Then you need to continue to distinguish yourselves. Make meaningful alterations to this world. The honest multiverse, if I might slight your timeline a little, doesn't need to worry about things like that. Their niches in the frame are built-in. You're piggybacking. You need to make a niche of your own, or the spin will fling you off into multiversal space, where you will either be lost or obliviated.\"\n\n\"Are you now counselling me to //further// deviate from existing protocol? That's a startling turn.\"\n\nThe other man leaned back again. \"I judged your resolve. I judge it strong. I've seen your people, and they're also strong. I think you have a real opportunity to create something lasting here, and as a representative of the multiversal collective, I'd like to see that happen. We're stronger the more of us there are.\"\n\n\"When we're aligned towards a common purpose.\"\n\nA slight incline of the head. \"On that topic, there is one piece of information I require from you, if I might be so bold. Do you know why all of this is happening?\"\n\nMcInnis considered. He gave his best guess.\n\n\"Ah,\" the other man smiled. \"Very good. Yes, I think you're certainly on the right track. Continue to pursue that line of thinking, painful though it is, and I think it will work out for the best. For everyone. Eyes on the big picture, you know? Apotheosis is a tricky business, but we can navigate it using the same conceptual toolkit we use for all of our other conceptual conundrums.\"\n\nHe wasn't entirely sure he knew what most of that meant. The man was certainly eager, and perhaps earnest, but at the moment he was talking over McInnis' head. He had the unsettling feeling that this was entirely purposeful, which erased his final doubts that this fellow was who he said he was. DTA agents were typically long-suffering but practical. TAD agents were almost universally daft, in that special way reserved for geniuses floating out into the noospheric ocean.\n\n\"To answer your unasked question,\" the man continued, \"some day, perhaps, the Coalition will change their tune. But they'll need someone to show them the way. A leader.\"\n\n\"I'm a poor choice for the role I've already stumbled into. Leading a multiversal alliance for change may be beyond my capabilities.\"\n\n\"If there's one thing I've learned across all these timelines, it's that hardship makes everything possible. When the heat is on, you can forge yourself into all manner of useful tools.\"\n\nMcInnis paused. \"I am assembling a tool set as we speak, in point of fact. I'd find it rather helpful to have someone of your expertise among them.\"\n\nThe other man looked suddenly uncertain. \"I don't know how much longer I can stick around. The window of opportunity may be closing, and I've learned pretty much all I need.\"\n\n\"An advisory position, then.\" McInnis pulled the terminal back into typing distance. \"I have just the thing.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 26 November\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n\"The Earth, our home, has been levelled. A Foundation is needed now more than ever.\"\n\nHarry nodded cheerfully. \"Make sure to include that in the press release.\"\n\nMcInnis rolled his eyes. \"Every regional command has fallen. Every major facility has gone dark. Every Overseer is dead. There will be survivors out there, and we will need to bring them back into the fold. Because we are the shepherds of this organization now -- there is no higher authority, and no other contingency plan.\"\n\nThey were all there with him again, sitting around the table. A panel of the wisest, most resourceful, most passionate and trustworthy individuals he had ever known. The play-gods were all dead. The next chapter was finally beginning.\n\n\"I thought this was a Chairs and Chiefs meeting,\" Veiksaar said, \"but that doesn't explain half the people here.\" Melissa wasn't a Chair of anything yet, though she was expected to replace Anastasios Mataxas for R&E; the shock of the last big memetic shakeup had been too much for his aged heart. Bremmel's Section had never been formed in this timeline. Lillian was still under Euler's purview, and Euler wasn't here for no reason which had yet been adequately explained. Reynders was joining them via video conference, and as far as Harry knew her full security clearance had never been restored.\n\n\"I have asked you here,\" McInnis explained, \"because I will have need of sound counsel going forward, and promises from each of you that I shall have unfettered access to it. You are each invaluable to the success of this endeavour, and I wish to formalize our arrangement. You are, I must now stress, the fifteen most vital members of my staff. With the monumental tasks ahead of us, thirteen would simply not be enough.\"\n\nFor a moment, Harry thought his head had exploded. \n\nMcInnis kept speaking. \"Those of you who are Section heads, I will require you to name deputies to act in your stead whenever you are absent in order to preserve the security of your identities. They will need to be informed of the true nature of this arrangement, of course, and will therefore act as your proxies in this room whenever required.\"\n\n\"You can't do this.\" Nascimbeni pushed back his chair and stood up in one rough motion. \"You don't have the authority.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Harry. His mind was whirling. Melissa was sitting ramrod-straight in her chair, eyes even glassier than usual. Lillian looked thunderstruck. Sokolsky was grinning.\n\n\"I have every authority,\" McInnis replied coolly. \"Every single kind.\"\n\n\"//Wait,//\" said Harry again.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zwist looked bewildered.\n\n\"I'm not even a doctor yet!\" Udo wailed.\n\n\"Sir.\" Elstrom stood as well. \"If we're going through with this, a formal declaration is required by the code of conduct.\"\n\n\"//Thank you,//\" Harry growled. Melissa stared at him, mouth open.\n\n\"Quite so, thank you Karen. I knew I chose my Governor well.\" McInnis joined them at his feet. \"I stand before you as Administrator. My predecessor, the Founder, knew the duty of guiding this vast organization was too difficult and complex for any one being to bear alone. He therefore chose a council of surrogates to manage its affairs in certain key arenas; I am now nominating you as their successors. Friends, barring any irreconcilable objections, I wish to elevate each of you to the post of Overseer and inaugurate the first O5 Council of the New Foundation. Will you serve?\"\n\nHarry took the roll call, and entered it into the minutes.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/34-beggar-belief/OverwatchBack.svg) center center no-repeat; text-align: center; width: 575px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 20px; padding: 0px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ The O5 Council\n**O5-1:** All Sections Chief (Chair)\n**O5-2:** Harold Blank (Archivist)\n**O5-3:** Karen Elstrom (Governor)\n**O5-4:** Trevor Bremmel (Practician)\n**O5-5:** Melissa Bradbury (Liaison)\n**O5-6:** Eileen Veiksaar (Operator)\n**O5-7:** Delfina Ibanez (Combatant)\n**O5-8:** Lillian Lillihammer (Advisor)\n**O5-9:** Ilse Reynders (Oracle)\n**O5-10:** Noè Nascimbeni (Humanist)\n**O5-11:** Udo Okorie (Thaumiel)\n**O5-12:** Thilo Zwist (Everyman)\n**O5-13:** Nhung Ngo (Mediator)\n**O5-14:** Brenda Corbin (Theologian)\n**O5-15:** Daniil Sokolsky (Contrarian)\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe also recorded the first responses to the Administrator's request. Daniil Sokolsky responded in the affirmative the instant the question was posed. Thilo Zwist required an extensive explanation of precisely what was being asked of him. Harry and Melissa shared a long, meaningful look before agreeing in tandem.\n\nLillian Lillihammer waited until she knew which role she'd been given before agreeing.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/36-face-time| previous-title=Face Time\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/38-world-of-difference | next-title=World of Difference\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wrong-tomorrow-hub | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Wrong Tomorrow\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** OverwatchBack.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Everything else!\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
