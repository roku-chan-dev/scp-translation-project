Due to the immense benefit it provides, there are also no plans to infiltrate the facility, although known entrances to SCP-208-DE are being monitored for the appearance of any Persons of Interest. If authorised by an O4 Council Member, Foundation Personnel can receive treatment at SCP-208-DE.\n\n**Description:** SCP-208-DE is the St. Caesarius [[footnote]] Presumably named after the Christian Saint Caesarius of Nazianzus, the patron saint of doctors.[[/footnote]] Hospital. In contrast to regular clinics, the main focus of SCP-208-DE is the treatment of anomalous diseases, and the provision of care to members of the paranormal community. The operator of the facility appears to be the World Parahealth Organisation (WPHO), one of the member organisations of the GOC. Care costs between 200 and 5000 Euros, but is qualitatively above the German standard and available to anyone. This includes members of organisations hostile to the GOC, including members of the Church of the Broken God, the Syndicate[[footnote]] German paracriminal Group of Interest. [[/footnote]] and even the Serpent's Hand. This neutrality stems from the anomaly's location within the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest#sjhlfels| Sjhlfel am Rhein Nexus]]].\n\nThe building's 35 meter high facade is assembled from 1.5 m^^2^^ reflective panels made from an unidentified material[[footnote]]Windows have been observed while inside SCP-208-DE, but none are visible from outside.[[/footnote]]. When observed from outside, the building's floorplan is elliptical and covers an area of 3900 m^^2^^.  \n\nThe internal structure changes at irregular intervals, altering the position of corridors or the furniture of rooms. To the best of our knowledge, the foyer, used as a waiting area, is exempt from these changes. It is assumed that the workforce either determines or is informed about these changes in advance. Space also appears to be distorted inside the anomaly. According to information provided by the hospital, all floors connect together on the same level, making elevators and stairs unnecessary, and it also appears that the internal floorplan is rectangular.\n\nAccording to their own records, the hospital staff consists of 50 doctors, with a Dr Katō serving as chief physician, as well as 100 nurses and 20 staff described as \"specialists\".\n\nAs noted above, the building itself is located in the Freeport of Sjhlfels am Rhein, but it can be accessed through several other entrances in the form of Ways, only some of which are known to the Foundation. Whenever anyone steps into one of these Ways, they are transported into the foyer of the anomaly. Whenever anyone exits the anomaly, they are transported back to their location of entry.\n\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"List of known entrances.

Proof of this theory has not yet been found.\n\n**Appendix 2:** The inhabitants of the Freeport often express negative opinions regarding the architecture of SCP-208-DE. The GOC made an official statement, asserting that \"due to the immense cost of renovation, the building would not be altered.\"\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-208-DE was built on 30/06/200█ with the assistance of Thaumaturgy and paratechnology from Eurtec[[footnote]] A pocket dimension established by members of the GOC in the mid-1970s, as a place for manufacturers of paratechnology to freely develop and sell their \"products\". [[/footnote]] and was inaugurated on 01/07 that same year. Due to having only a small presence in Sjhlfels am Rhein at the time, the Foundation first found out about it five days later.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Exploration Log 208-DE \" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**EXPLORATION LOG 208-DE**\n\n**Date:** 07.07.200█\n\n**Participants:** Agent Wildenhain and Agent Möllehof from Outpost-DE20\n\n**Location:** SCP-208-DE, Sjhlfels am Rhein\n\n**Foreford:** The two agents were instructed to enter the object through its main entrance in Sjhlfels am Rhein. It should be noted that it was assumed at this point that this was not an actual hospital, and that this appearance merely served to conceal its true purpose.\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Wildenhain:** Okay, ready?\n\n**Möllehof:** Yes.\n\n//The Agents enter SCP-208-DE. They find themselves inside a kind of foyer. People are sitting on benches along the walls, apparently waiting for something.//\n\n**Möllehof:** It looks like some kind of Hospital...\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, there is a big sign hanging outside saying \"St. Caesarius Clinic\"...\n\n**Möllehof:** Yes, yes... wait an minute - that's the WPHO logo over there. What are the Gocks doing in Sjhlfels?\n\n**Wildenhain:** How should I know? Let's just ask.\n\n//The two agents go over to one of the counters at the other side of the room and approach the woman sitting there.//\n\n**Wildenhain:** Good Day, my name is Wildenhain, this is my college Möllehof. We're agents of the SCP Foundation. Could you answer a few questions, Ms...?\n\n**Fink:** Fink. And no, I can't, I don't have either the authorisation or the time to answer your questions. As you can see, people are lining up here.\n\n**Möllehof:** What for?\n\n**Fink:** I believe that Dr. Katō can best explain this to you. Ah! He's already coming over.\n\n//Ms Fink points with her hand towards a door, through which a middle-aged man enters. Based on his attire, he appears to be a doctor.//\n\n//The agents approach Dr. Katō and show him their IDs.//\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Foundation? I guess you had to show up at some point.\n\n//Dr. Katō walks past the agents and passes through another door. The agents follow him.//\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Please be brief, I have a thaumic transfer to perform.\n\n**Möllehof:** A wh-\n\n**Wildenhain:** Then lets start with the most obvious question: what is this?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** What does it look like?\n\n**Möllehof:** A hospital.\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Exactly. And that's what it is.\n\n//Dr. Katō leads the Agents into a long corridor, with windows through which the harbor is visible.//\n\n**Wildenhain:** I can understand why the WPHO would build a hospital. But why here in Sjhlfels?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** The answer is obvious: this is neutral ground. We can treat practically anyone here, regardless of which organisation they belong to.\n\n**Wildenhain:** But... Why? Why would you help people that oppose the GOC?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Medical treatment should be available to anyone, regardless of their position.\n\n**Wildenhain:** But that's totally counterproductive.\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Unfortunately, that's true. To be honest, the Council wasn't a fan of building a hospital that would treat parathreats, but since they got here before us we didn't have many other options. At least this way, we can polish up our image. Most people still see us as otherworldly mass-murders.\n\n**Wildenhain:** Are they-\n\n**Möllehof:** Stay focused. For medical care, you don't need a GOC hospital. I mean, any doctor can treat gunshot-wounds.\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Gunshot-wounds? This clinic was not build for gunshot wounds. Sure, we do handle normal ailments, but but our main focus has always been the treatment of paranormal diseases.\n\n**Möllehof:** Hardly anyone gets sick from those. Especially not in a town like Sjhlfels.\n\n**Dr. Katō:** On the contrary, many people contract them, especially members of anomalous communities. There are other entrances to this pocket dimension outside of Sjhlfels.\n\n**Wildenhain:** And where from, may I ask?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** For that, I'll have to ask the Council first. I'll send you an email later[[footnote]] A short list of presumed locations was actually sent. However, most of them are inaccessible to the Foundation.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Möllehof:** Um... Thank you...\n\n**Wildenhain:** So, what are you dealing with currently?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Memetic pathogens, curses, metaphysical parasites, extraterrestrial viruses. Just to give a few examples.\n\n//Dr. Katō reaches the end of the corridor and opens to he door with the help of an key card.//\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Only personnel and patients are allowed through here. Have a nice day. Oh, and before I forget: naturally, we'll also treat agents of the Foundation. You are welcome to undergo examination and treatment here.\n\n**Wildenhain:** Just one more thing.\n\n**Dr. Katō:** And that would be?\n\n**Wildenhain:** How were you able to build this so quickly?\n\n**Dr. Katō:** Thaumatology and tangential technology[[footnote]] GOC terminology for paratechnology. [[/footnote]] from Eurtec. Now, if you would excuse me.\n\n//Dr. Katō closes the door behind him. The agents then leave the building and return to Outpost-DE20.//\n\n[END OF LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:** The proposal to send in an agent to undergo examination was approved by the O4 Council the following day.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview-208-DE \" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INTERVIEW-208-DE**\n----\n**Interviewer:** Interrogator Harald Boris Angst\n\n**Interviewee:** Agent Wildenhain\n\n**Note:** Agent Wildenhain had voluntarily submitted to a two-hour examination on 08/07 in SCP-208-DE. Since he was unable to bring any recording equipment with him, the sequence of events was determined based on his recollections during this interview.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Angst:** Good Morning, Mr Wildenhain.\n\n**Wildenhain:** Morning, Mr Angst.\n\n**Angst:** So, let's begin. Please describe simply the course of your stay in SCP-208-DE.\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, um... I entered, went over to the counter, and said that I would like to be examined. The woman then gave me a form[[footnote]] See \"Reconstructed Form\" [[/footnote]] to fill out.\n\n**Angst:** What kind of form?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Simply a piece of paper, where I had to write down my details and so on. Age, sex, that sort of thing. A couple of questions were a little unusual, but what else would you expect?\n\n**Angst:** Please go on.\n\n**Wildenhain:** After I'd filled it out, I went back to her and was told I was supposed to sit on one of the benches.\n\n**Angst:** And then?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Well, I sat down and waited until my turn.\n\n**Angst:** How long did that take?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Approximately fifteen minutes. The clock was pretty far away, so I didn't get a good look.\n\n**Angst:** And then?\n\n**Wildenhain:** This Dr. Katō greeted me and lead me into a treatment room.\n\n**Angst:** What did this room look like?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Just like a normal treatment room in a normal hospital.\n\n**Angst:** Anyway, what happened then?\n\n**Wildenhain:** He then asked me how I was doing, and whether I had any complaints.\n\n**Angst:** And? Did you?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Yeah, nothing special, only a pain in my back, from the time this bastard of a poltergeist hit me with a table [[footnote]] Agent Wildenhain was previously a member of a Reactionary Task Force (RTF) stationed at Site-DE20. During an attack by PoI-████-DE, he sustained a minor injury and has subsequently suffered from phantom pains. [[/footnote]].\n\n**Angst:** Did you tell that to Dr. Katō?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Yes. He said that he'd take a closer look later, and first go through some routine tests.\n\n**Angst:** And what did these tests involve?\n\n**Wildenhain:** First, he gave me some kind of VR-glasses to put on, and they displayed a few fractals.\n\n**Angst:** Did you ask him what the purpose of that was?\n\n**Wildenhain:** I did. It was supposed to measure my brain activity and see how I react to memes.\n\n**Angst:** Was that all?\n\n**Wildenhain:** No... He said he'd move on to the next step. He brought me into another room, but that definitely wasn't a treatment room.\n\n**Angst:** Rather?\n\n**Wildenhain:** It was more like a photography studio. I had to stand in front of a metal wall, with my legs apart and my arms outstretched, while I was filmed by multiple cameras. Meanwhile, Dr. Katō was watching various screens with a woman, I think her name was Dr. Maur.\n\n**Angst:** And what was that for?\n\n**Wildenhain:** I asked him that as well. Apparently they were metaphysical scanners. For EVE, and such like.\n\n**Angst:** And?\n\n**Wildenhain:** They told me that everything was in order so far, but that spectral energy was accumulating in my back, at the point where it hurt.\n\n**Angst:** Were they able to treat you?\n\n**Wildenhain:** //(nods)// I was brought into another room. This one also looked like a normal treatment room. I was told to take off my shirt and lie face down on a couch. Dr. Katō then placed a metal cylinder on the spot, and the surface of it heated up. After a minute, I could stand up again and put my shirt back on.\n\n**Angst:** And then you could leave?\n\n**Wildenhain:** Affirmative.\n\n**Angst:** Then, that's all for now. The interview is over. Have a good day.\n\n**Wildenhain:** You too.\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Notes:** The following morning, a bill of 2000 Euros was sent to Outpost-DE20. This sum was to be sent to an account in Eurtec within a week. The German O4-Council agreed to transfer the amount three hours before the deadline.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"Reconstructed Form \" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:white; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n^^If inapplicable, please leave blank.

Additionally, you should be advised that a certain respectful tone is warranted when writing a letter to your superiors.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"Comment from Dr. Marker\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nHonestly, by now you are probably thinking that this was a joke, or a bait file you were sent to in error. Well, no: St. Caesarius really does exist.\n\nI know the thought of the Global Occult Coalition running a hospital is ridiculous. And I can tell you that the Coalition itself is not a big fan of providing medical care to people it otherwise persecutes. But think about this: SCP-208-DE was not built out of compassion or caring. It's no accident that the whole thing was initially assumed to be an elaborate facade for a surveillance operation.\n\nThe Coalition receives precise medical data on their \"patients\", as well as their current location. Have you ever thought about that? We know of at least two well documented cases, in which individuals were shadowed by GOC agents after receiving treatment, and were terminated after leaving Sjhlfels. Those were probably not isolated cases.\n\nThat is why we only see low-level PoIs inside SCP-208-DE. Nobody wants to send their important people there, only to have them be tracked down and shot after treatment.\n\nIs it still so amusing?\n\n@@@@\nDr. Marker\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
