Site-04K Memetics Department is assigned for incident investigation duty.\n\n##red|**[PREVIOUS PROCEDURES DISCARDED]**##\n\n**Description:** SCP-841-KO is the computer program \"WeCU.exe\", which is presumed to have been distributed to Pink&Green IT Academy[[footnote]]Programming and software development teaching institute. Disbanded on 22/02/2003 after being recognized by the Foundation.[[/footnote]] SCP-841-KO's main function is pinpointing the physical location of visual hazards in a given image. (It should be noted that the program cannot find the hazard embedded in the image itself.) No information is known about its further functionality. The program is coded with a completely non-anomalous code. However, it produces its value via an unknown procedure. Despite the full reverse engineering by the research team, they were unable to deduce the program's mechanism.\n\nA substantial amount of evidence points to a specific location outside the academy as SCP-841-KO's source, but nothing is known about it.\n\n**Addendum-1:**\n[[collapsible show=\"[+ Show]\" hide=\"[- Hide]\"]]\n\n\n\n\n[!-- Start of Experiment Log 1! --]\n\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; background:#f2f6ff url(http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-816-ko/logo.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n++ ▶ **Experiment Log #841K-2**\n\n**Date:** 23/02/2003\n\n**Supervisor:** Antimemetics Researcher Lee Hanseok\n\nA sheet of AO-2554[[footnote]]Five Litmus sheets that evoke minor visual hazards when seen with the naked eye.

It's a shame that the program can't read hazards that are too far away; \"too far\" as in more than 1 metre away, and the program becomes useless. It's not even instantaneous, so it lacks quite a lot compared to relevant tools developed by overseas branches. We would have tried some research had the code itself has been anomalous.\n\nToo much time was spent on not much progress.

Note the area highlighted by the rectangles.[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nOn November 2nd, 2019, a large-scale wildfire started on a mountain in ██-Gun, Republic of Korea. The fire is presumed to have started at [REDACTED], further spread by the strong wind and geography of the surrounding area. While the Foundation was monitoring the incident, Dr Lee Hanseok photographed the wildfire and reported that an anomalous phenomenon or instance was involved in the fire. Dr Lee predicted that the anomaly may cause at least a Keneq-Class confusion. Site-01K redacted military and fire brigade dispatch orders, and sent the Disinformation Department. Footages of the wildfire were taken by news helicopters, but data containing the hazard did not spread due to the long distance.\n\nSoon Foundation personnel were dispatched on-site, and [[[SCP-624-KO]]], SCP-███-KO, and SCP-████-JP[[footnote]]Provided by Site-8123[[/footnote]] were provided. The wildfire was completely extinguished after 110 minutes of the start of the firefighting operation. The on-site retrieval team did not find anything identifiable as an anomalous instance, and the information was handed over to the newly formed Paranormal Disasters Research Department.[[footnote]](Currently disbanded.)[[/footnote]] No civilian damage was done.\n\nThe Foundation planned to recognise the exploits of Antimeme expert Lee Hanseok, and reward him appropriately.\n\nHowever, it has been discovered that the whole report was deliberately fabricated by Dr Lee Hanseok.

Why the hell did you do it?\n\n**Dr Lee Hanseok:** The Foundation sits back and watches when there are no anomalies involved. It made no sense for me to do anything in that kind of situation. Do you know how many firefighters pass away in Korea each year?\n\n**Agent Seo Jiyeon:** Do you think we're immortals, then? Two were severely injured, and three were lightly injured in our team, but not a single mention of them. Why? Because thank goodness there are no civilian casualties. You should know better, you're in the frontest of frontlines. So why?\n\n//Dr Lee Hanseok hesitates.//\n\n**Dr Lee Hanseok:** When I was young before I even went to school, I lost my family to a fire. My mom, dad, and my brother.

The higher your security clearance is, the more you can know. My heart shattered. Did you see it? Gaseous ice, water droplets the size of a house, ██ ███ ███ █████ ██...
