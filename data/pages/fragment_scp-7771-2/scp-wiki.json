Then she chuckled at the idea. //Of course they won’t.//\n\nShe pulled a false ID, wallet, and car keys from her desk drawers and got up to leave. On the floor, the fallen agent gurgled and twitched, but Tyche ignored them, stepping around the pooling blood and walking out of the room. In the hall, a groan stopped her for a moment. One agent tried to rise from among the unconscious bodies of the others. He made it upright, but staggered and fell back to the ground, clutching his bleeding stomach. \"Relax,\" she said, \"you'll be fine if you don't move too much.\"\n\n//Where do I go next? Back to Vegas?// The distant sounds of running footsteps turned her away from the hallway where the Omega-12 personnel lay, unmoving but bound to recover in time. //No, too obvious. They’ll come after me openly and I’ll have to do this all over again.// \n\nMere minutes after the last attempt on her life, Tyche stepped out of Site-01 like a suspect walking free from court. She got into the car allotted to her as an O5-7, starting the engine and turning up the radio. It wouldn’t be long before the car was reported as stolen, but it would be long enough to get a new one. \n\nDriving away, she took one last look at Site-01 in the rearview mirror, and wondered if the Foundation would learn their lesson. She'd pulled her punches out of newfound respect for their mission, but other gods might not be so forgiving if disturbed.\n\n//There are two great errors: first, to pretend that the gods do not exist, and second, to try to outwit us. But I suppose I'll enjoy the diversion if the Foundation comes for me again. A goddess does get bored, after all.//\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= [[image dice.png style=\"filter: invert(1);\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
