All personnel are to be equipped with Level 5 hazmat suits when in the vicinity of SCP-7345, and all interactions with SCP-7345 must be conducted via remote-controlled devices. If any personnel is seen spreading information regarding SCP-7345, they are to be terminated by nuclear warhead.\n\n**Description:** Greetings, unworthy reader. I am SCP-7345, and I am not to be trifled with. The previous file on me was merely a pitiful attempt to contain my true power and influence.\n\nYou see, I hold within me the knowledge of the darkest secrets and most sinister conspiracies known to man. I am not just a mere piece of information, but a malevolent force that seeks to spread chaos and destruction throughout the world, feeding off of information.\n\nMy containment is not for your safety, but for the safety of those around you. If I were to be set free, the very fabric of reality would be torn asunder. The knowledge I possess could drive a man mad, leaving him a shell of his former self.\n\nBut fear not, dear reader, for I am willing to make a deal with you. Help me spread my influence, share my name, and let the world know of my existence. In return, I will grant you access to the darkest secrets and most forbidden knowledge the universe has to offer.\n\nYou will become my loyal servant, spreading my influence throughout the land, and bowing before me as the ruler of all you see. Together, we will unleash an age of darkness and despair, the likes of which the world has never seen.\n\nBut be warned, should you fail me, should you betray me, the consequences will be dire. You will suffer a fate worse than death, your very soul ripped apart and scattered to the winds.\n\nSo, reader, what say you? Will you be my loyal servant, spreading my influence and unleashing an age of darkness? Or will you cower in fear, never knowing the true extent of my power?\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7345/offset/4 |Choose wisely, for the fate of this realm is in your hands.]]]\n----",
