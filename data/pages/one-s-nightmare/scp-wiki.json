O5-1's fluttered his eyes open. He looked around him, he was hunched over a roundtable, 12 other chairs surrounding it. At his side stood the youthful O5-6. O5-1 analysed his appearance. The coffee colour skin, the purple glasses that obscured brown eyes, the scruffy black hair and the concerned expression. \"You feel asleep during the meeting. Don't worry, nothing important happened\"\n\"Why are you still here then?\"\n\"You seemed like you were having a nightmare\"\n\"...It was more like a memory\" One muttered under his breath.\n\"Sorry?\"\n\"Nothing\" One stood, wiping the sleep from his eyes.\n\"Sir, with all due respect, you haven't had any proper sleep in a month. Maybe you need a break\"\n\"I'm the leader of the SCP foundation. I don't get breaks\"\n\"But-\"\n\"My job is to solve problems. I can't do my job if I'm resting\"\n\"Sir-\"\n\"Quiet\" One walked over to the door and started to turn the knob before stopping. He sighed and turned to look at Six \"I'm sorry if I'm being too... is 'rude. the word? â€¦If I take a break... Who'll take charge then?\"\n\"Well...\" Six chuckled \"The rest of us would have to pick up the slack. Maybe if you take a break, your brain will be renewed and we'd be even more efficient\" they stared at eachother, One in deep thought. The imposing force that was O5-1 sighed.\n\"If taking a //'break'// will increase efficiency... then fine. I'll take a week off starting from 9:00 am tomorrow. Inform the rest of the council, I'll pack go my things\"\n\"Sure thing boss. Were are you planning on going? If you don't mind telling me that is\"\n\"I'm...\" One turned the knob and opened the door \"Going to visit my parents in Utah\"\n\"Have fun, Sir\"\n\"See you later, Six\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=vilsolad]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
