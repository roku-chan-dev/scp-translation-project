While she proved to be more than adequate for this role, her career within the Iranian military had more or less reached its zenith. When the opportunity arose for her to integrate into Foundation Military Command, she took it.\n\nThroughout her years of service, she was tasked to serve first as a platoon commander in MTF Alpha-1 (\"The Red Right Hand\") before being given her first MTF full command when she took over as Commander of MTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\"). Again, she excelled in the role, taking on the complex organizational task of maintaining assets in many of the Mundane World's militaries and government agencies.\n\nInitially slotted to take over as Executive Officer of MTF Alpha-1, she passed on that opportunity to join the //Kelipat Nogah// initiative as the commander of MTF Xi-8 (\"The Last to Fall\").\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commander Liraz ■\" hide=\"□ Commander Liraz □\"]]\n[[div class=\"dossier\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=liraz.jpg|caption=Commander Malachai Yusef ben Liraz|width=300px]]\n++++ Commander Malachai ben Liraz\n**Full Name:** Malachai Yusef ben Liraz\n\n**Known Aliases/Callsigns:** Joseph Lam / Michael Lam / Michael Sutter / \"Steeljacket\"\n\n**Title:** Field Commander, MTF Xi-8 \"The Last to Fall\"\n\n**Direct Report:** FM Tariq-Sattar\n\n**Home Site:** Area-02\n\n**Clearance:** L04/MTF Command\n\n**Sex/Gender:** M/M\n\n**D.O.B.:** 03 November, 1977\n\n**Height:** 1.9m\n\n**Weight:** 83kg\n\n**Age:** 43\n\n**Education:** BS, Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; MS, Material Sciences, Tel-Aviv University\n\n**Personal History:** As a brilliant materials-science researcher at Ben-Gurion, Commander ben Liraz originally intended to establish himself as a leader in the Sciences. His stint in the Israeli armed forces opened new avenues for him, and he was recruited directly into the MTF Command corps after graduating from Tel-Aviv University.\n\nQuick thinking and adaptable, Commander ben Liraz proved himself more than adequate for the task, volunteering in several front-line assignments before being given command of the newly-formed MTF Xi-8 as the military arm of the //Kelipat Nogah// initiative. In that role, he has transformed his Task Force from \"satisfactory\" to \"exemplary\", due to his brilliant tactical acumen and dedication to leadership.\n\nWhile his record may indicate a poor reaction to being passed up for overall leadership by Marshall Tariq-Sattar, he has quickly adapted to the new chain of command and the two of them have established a close and effective rapport. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Kalmaktama Empire]]\n[[div class=\"textbox\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"┤Klavigar Nadox├\" hide=\"╣Klavigar Nadox╠\"]]\n[[div class=\"dossier2\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://imgur.com/Vy6O1nW.png|caption=Klavigar Nadox|width=300px]]\n++++ Klavigar Nadox\n**Full Name:** Nadox \n\n**Known Aliases:** Unknown\n\n**Title:** Klavigar\n\n**Area of Activity:** Unknown, though recent rumors have him based somewhere near Prague, Czech Republic \n\n**Known Cult Association(s):** Unknown.

All mention of him was expunged from French diplomatic records at the request of the Portuguese government. It is this very lack of available information that suggests that the identity of \"Lucien Dutoit née Thiers\" is just one of many such personas assumed by this individual.\n\nWhat is known, and has been confirmed through various outside sources, is that Dutoit is the identity used by the Karcist of the Neo-Sarkic cult Société de la Fleur Sanglante (Society of the Bloody Flower). It is believed that Dutoit is the nom de guerre assumed by the Karcist after the fall of the July Monarchy in 1848.\n\nOur understanding as to why Dutoit was positioned at the British court via the French diplomatic corps is purely conjecture. Through his letters, we can assume that he was attempting to gain leverage amongst the British aristocracy in a hope to shift his flagging power base in France and either his attempts to do so were blocked by an unknown outside entity, or he simply found that shifting to Portugal was a much more appetizing prospect.\n\nEither way, the Société did make the move to Portugal, and Dutoit utilized his connection with the Marquessa to secure a French diplomatic residency at the Palace of Santos. It is unclear how much of that delegation was made up of members of his Société, but the impact of Dutoit's shifting to Lisbon did ultimately result in the Palace of Santos eventually becoming the permanent French Embassy in Portugal.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"┤Karcist Halyna Ieva├\" hide=\"╣Karcist Halyna Ieva╠\"]]\n[[div class=\"dossier2\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=ieva.jpg|caption=Karcist Halyna Ieva|width=300px]]\n++++ Halyna Ieva\n**Full Name:** Äiti Joka Vaatii Varpaita / \"The Mother Who Demands Toes\"\n\n**Known Aliases:**  Layla Helen Pirani, The Scourge of Iron, The Mother Who Demands One's Toes, The Flesh That Ate, Subversion of Mekhanical Expectations, The Faithful Heretic\n\n**Title:** Karcist\n\n**Area of Activity:** The Middle East & The Levant\n\n**Known Cult Association(s):** The Hunter's Black Lodge\n\n**Sex/Gender:** F?/F?\n\n**D.O.B.:** Unknown\n\n**Height:** Varies dramatically\n\n**Weight:** Varies dramatically\n\n**Age:** Unknown\n\n**Known Abilities:** Combat Carnomancy\n\n**Personal History:** Written in the Valkzaron as Klavigar Orok's greatest lieutenant, she was considered vicious and nigh-uncontrollable even by the members of the Grand Karcist's court. \n\nOur most detailed information comes from a [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/mother-who-demands-ones-toes copy of an entry in the Wanderer's Library codex.]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"┤Karcist Yongsun Ban├\" hide=\"╣Karcist Yongsun Ban╠\"]]\n[[div class=\"dossier2\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=ban.jpg|caption=Karcist Yongsun Ban|width=300px]]\n++++ Karcist Yongsun Ban\n**Full Name:** Wáwá Zhìzào Shāng - \"The Maker of Puppets\"\n\n**Known Aliases:** Master Ban, Father of Children\n\n**Title:** Karcist\n\n**Area of Activity:** Eastern Asia\n\n**Known Cult Association(s):** 검은피 아이들 - //Geomeunpi Aideul//, \"Children of the Black Blood\"\n\n**Sex/Gender:** M?/M?\n\n**D.O.B.:** Unknown\n\n**Height:** 5'9\n\n**Weight:** ~200\n\n**Age:** Unknown\n\n**Known Abilities:** Carnomancy, Law, underworld relations, organization & logistics\n\n**Personal History:** Known as a talented fleshcrafter, Karcist Ban excelled at crafting homunculi and guiding several breeding programs.

If you think your piece fits somewhere in the Canon, feel free to add it as an \"Assistentes\". The main plot lines are already all mapped out, all the way through Act 4, so you'll have a good framework to work with.\n\nArticles/Tales in the canon get tagged {{memoria-adytum}}.\n\nFor tales, we suggest using the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:memoria Memoria Theme]. It is not required, but uniformity looks cool and the theme was designed with that in mind.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Usage\"]]\n\nOn any wiki:\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:collapsible-sidebar]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:theme:memoria]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nFor the white-ish text box that you'll need to see the text over the background gradient:\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"textbox\"]]@@\nText/code whatever will go in here, as normal.\n@@[[/div]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nFor the Solomonari \"scripture\":\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@@[[div class=\"type1\"]]@@\nYou'll need to use the \"@@@@@@ @@@@@@\" symbols to separate paragraphs and\n@@[[>]]@@\n@@[[span style=\"font-family:var(--body-font); font-size: calc(var(--base-font-size) * 1.00); color: #000000;\"]]- //This is the \"attribution\"//[[/span]]@@\n@@[[/>]]@@\n@@[[/div]]@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nEach Act is separated based upon the primary events going on + how much the Foundation is aware of what's going on. \n\nIn Acts 1 & 2, only the people initially involved in [http://scpwiki.com/kelipat Kelipat Nogah] were TRULY aware. The Foundation as a whole, led primarily by O5-08, refused to believe that the Sarkic Threat was as extensive as it was, and were (falsely) confident that the Foundation could handle anything that came from it. They turned an intentional blind eye to the goings on and refused to listen to people like Dr. Low or O5-12. \n\nAfter Act 3, however, the Veil is broken and everything the Foundation does has been affected by it. Basically, anything set AFTER 23 February, 2020 in this Canon is placed in a world where the Veil has been broken and the Mundane World has at least a general idea that the Anomalous World exists.\n\nStuff in the Prologue generally tends to be stuff about the ancient Sarkics and the War of the Flesh. This isn't meant to be a re-telling of that war, that all happened long ago.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Et Notitia]]\nFrom [[*user MalyceGraves]]:\n\nAlmost from Day 1 of my writing for the SCP Wiki, I had in mind a sort of 'unified headcanon' for how the Sarkic stuff worked. I read everything tagged \"sarkic\", had some interesting conversations about it with [[*user Metaphysician]], then began writing.\n\nMy first foray into writing Sarkic stuff was [http://scpwiki.com/scp-4476 SCP-4476: La Famille Natau], and with it was birthed  my true love of Sarkicism and the history of it. I've always been fascinated with \"untold histories\" and \"alternative histories\", and I really jived with the explanation for the Bronze Age Collapse that is inherent within the Sarkic mythos.\n\nSo I crafted more, and it dawned on me that most of the Sarkic stuff fell into pretty much two categories: Retelling of What Was and a Prophesy of What Will Be. \"To meet again in Adytum\" is a major theme throughout a lot of the Sarkic work on-site, but there's not much that actually LEADS to Adytum. I started working on that in [http://scpwiki.com/anthropological-report-darkwater the Darkwater report]. \n\nEventually I realized that I almost had enough to turn my headcanon into a REAL canon, and that's when the work on Memoria, Adytum began in earnest. I talked to several other authors who had work I loved, and... well, here we are.\n\nI cannot thank you guys enough.\n\n-----\n\nFrom [[*user DrAkimoto]]:\n\nSo honestly, I was originally I was drawn to Sarkic content purely based on my love for fleshy body horror. But as I kept reading I found that i enjoyed the history and lore even more than simple body horror. Specifically focusing on Neo-Sarkicism I found the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2408 The Hunter's Black Lodge] and the mix of criminal organization/meatmagic cult struck a cord with me and I began expanding on them. \n\nWhen [[*user MalyceGraves]] originally brought the idea for Memoria to me I grooved with the direction they wanted to take and began working my previous and future creations into the canon. I am immeasurably proud of all the work done by everyone and I'm looking forward to what's yet to come.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"authors\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author Attributions\" hide=\"+ Hide Author Attributions\"]]\n**Contributing Authors:**\n> # [[*user metaphysician]] -
