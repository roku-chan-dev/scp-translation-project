Subjects experimenting with SCP-8114 are to be switched according to the testing researcher's discretion.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8114 is a dumbbell, weighing 2.3 kilograms. SCP-8114 becomes exceedingly light when held by a living subject, returning to its baseline weight upon loss of physical contact.\n\nSubjects transform into athletic versions of themselves after exercising with SCP-8114, appearing as highly muscular and lean. Repetition, duration, and intensity of the exercises involved are inconsequential; only correctly performing the exercises is what achieves this effect. This transformation is temporary, as subjects will revert to their original bodies over time.[[footnote]]The exact timeframe for complete bodily reversion is indeterminate and varies between each subject.[[/footnote]]\n\nLoss of this transformation can be prevented by frequently exercising with SCP-8114. However, if this occurs, the anomaly's secondary property manifests. SCP-8114 will progressively gain and accumulate weight in subsequent uses. In addition to making exercising difficult, this also diminishes the potency of the subject's transformation. If the subject persists, SCP-8114's weight will increase to the point of permanent immobility. This solely affects subjects who triggered its secondary property. Subjects who have not can still manipulate SCP-8114 without issue.\n\n**History:** SCP-8114 came to the Foundation's attention in the aftermath of a wellness check performed on an apartment within ████████, Colorado. The apartment was in a state disarray, with a majority of the rooms being in shambles. The apartment's sole resident, Albert Mayfield, was discovered dead in the living room. The Foundation took over the investigation after details of the case came to light, necessitating the amnestization of all relevant parties. \n\nAn autopsy revealed that Mr. Mayfield suffered a fatal heart attack. Mr. Mayfield also suffered severe gastrointestinal perforation, caused by the presence of a massive quantity of food in his stomach.[[footnote]]Notably, the body was in the fetal position at the time of discovery.[[/footnote]] SCP-8114 was recovered from the living room. A digital camcorder was also found. Attached below is all relevant footage confiscated from the device.\n\n= __**SCP-8114/Video.File1**__\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ ACCESS FILE ◀\" hide=\"▷ CLOSE FILE ◁\"]]\n[[<]]\n> = **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> //[Mayfield is sitting on a couch. He opens his mouth, pauses, then chuckles.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Sorry. I planned a whole speech, but you know what? Something this special gotta come from the heart. My name's Albert Mayfield. Born in Wyoming, lived in ████████ for a good while now. I'm 26--well technically 27 -- my birthday’s coming up soon. It's a brand new year and as you can see... a brand //new// me.\n> \n> //[Mayfield gestures to his body, shirtless and highly muscular. He points at his \"ten-pack.\"]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Shocking right? Never thought it would be this...\n> \n> //[Mayfield stares at the coffee table. SCP-8114 is present, which he picks up.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Right. Long story short, my health was going downhill. Reeeeeeal bad. Like the problem became so huge I couldn't deny it anymore.\n> \n> //[Mayfield stands and approaches a floor mirror near him. He then performs a dumbbell overhead press with SCP-8114.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** But following vigorous exercise.\n> \n> //[Mayfield performs a tricep extension with SCP-8114.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Strict dieting.\n> \n> //[Mayfield performs a bicep curl with SCP-8114.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** And immense will-power, I managed to pull myself up, \"straight up.\" Cheesy I know, but the results speak for themselves! The best part?\n> \n> //[Mayfield enters the walk-in kitchen in background, pulling a pizza box from the fridge. The waste container is overfilled with disposable food containers. Mayfield sits back down.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** I can eat crap like this again!\n> \n> //[Mayfield opens the box, pulling out an extra-large slice of a deep dish, meat lover's pizza. He consumes half the slice.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** What? You thought I was eating rabbit food all this time? The thing about bodybuilders, they require a lot of calories to keep their body functioning. Same applies to me, the difference being is that I found a way to get the best of both worlds. [Faux Italian Accent] Capiche?\n> \n> //[Mayfield chuckles, finishing his slice.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** On a separate note, things have really improved back at ████ State.[[footnote]]The university Mr. Mayfield previously attended.[[/footnote]] I'm making rounds in the sports clubs, I've made friends... [Loud Whisper] I even got a couple of phone numbers. All thanks to this little guy!\n> \n> //[Mayfield sets down the pizza box and showcases SCP-8114 to the camera. Mayfield blinks twice as his expression softens.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** ...A-And the other equipment I got laying around. I'm visiting my family for Spring Break. My folks don't know yet, it's a surprise. I can't wait to see their faces! In fact, that's why I'm redoing my journal again, thought it was appropriate considering the circumstances. Just... want people to know the new me.\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Anyways, that's the long and short of it. Expect another video, probably soonish. Until then, Mayfield signing out.\n> \n> //[Mayfield salutes, still exercising with SCP-8114.]//\n> \n> = **[END LOG]**\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n= __**SCP-8114/Video.File2**__\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ ACCESS FILE ◀\" hide=\"▷ CLOSE FILE ◁\"]]\n[[<]]\n> = **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> //[Mayfield is sitting on the couch, wearing a sleeveless shirt, He looks at the mirror's reflection. Mayfield caresses his abdomen tightly, scowling before looking at the camera. He smiles.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Hi, guess who? Heh. So big update, a lot has happened since my last video. Remember when I talked about phone numbers? Weeeeell, turns out they were also lottery numbers. And I won. //Biggly//. Courtney Winters.\n> \n> //[Mayfield slaps his knee, laughing loudly.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Can you believe it?! Courtney. Winters. I kid you not! The same chick who kept forgetting my name is texting me non-stop. I can barely keep up! Not that I'm complaining. We had our tenth date last night. Went to a steakhouse. Hella expensive, but you can never put a price on love, right?\n> \n> **Mayfield:**  Sidenote, I'm officially a part of the basketball team now! We got a big game coming up soon. I've heard it's gonna be televised by all the college channels. This may be the ultimate golden opportunity here. If I impress the right people... I might be able to go places. Winters will be there too. Another reason to take this seriously. Best part is, I got it all figured out--\n> \n> //[Mayfield caresses his chest in discomfort. He frowns.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** --Mostly figured out. Pushing yourself does not come without its consequences. Nothing too bad, it doesn't even hurt most of the time. It's just...\n> \n> //[Mayfield's eye twitches again.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** //Annoying//. But it'll pass. Pumping a little iron never hurt anyone--\n> \n> //[Mayfield grabs SCP-8114 as he stands. His right arm suddenly and violently jolts forwards. Mayfield falls onto the coffee table, breaking it in half.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Goddammit! Ah... argh....\n> \n> //[Mayfield stumbles out of the room, soon returning with a first aid box and bathroom scale. As Mayfield dresses his wounds, he stares at the table's remains.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** [Whisper] So it's getting worse... What the hell is going on?\n> \n> //[After applying bandages, Mayfield places SCP-8114 onto the scale. After a moment, Mayfield gasps.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** That was not five fucking pounds! Are you even working right?!\n> \n> //[Mayfield takes SCP-8114 off the scale and steps on it instead. After a moment, Mayfield's eyes widened. He backs away slowly, eyes trained on the digital display. Mayfield hyperventilates, then scrambles into a hallway.]//\n> \n> //[A minute passes. Mayfield sprints back into the living room to retrieve SCP-8114. He leaves the area, frantically performing several bicep curls with the object.

He is wearing a large jacket.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** The game was fine... at first... but I couldn't keep up. Teammates were mad. Coach was disappointed.

Instead, he accidentally knocks over the tripod stand. The camera is now filming on the ground at a tilted angle.

What do you have to say for yourself?\n> \n> //[SCP-8114 remains stationary, Mayfield leans closer.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** It's such a shame you can't talk, because I would love to hear what bullshit excuses you'd come with... you //useless// piece of shit. We had a good thing going and you had to throw it all away. And for what? Nothing! Literally nothing! I could've left you to rot... I could've left you in the garbage... I decided to take a chance on you... and this is how you repay me?! You--\n> \n> //[Mayfield jabs SCP-8114 again with significant force. He pulls his finger away in apparent pain. Mayfield stands up and stomps on SCP-8114 repeatedly, shouting expletives at it. Mayfield movements become slower and disengage from further stomping.

He removes the blanket, removes his jacket, then inspects himself in the mirror. Mayfield's body is no longer muscular and has gained an excess amount of fat. Mayfield shudders and begins to cry.

I'm happy that we met. I wouldn't have gotten this far without you. I know for a fact I wouldn't. Funny how something so great could get mixed up with  Legos and rat droppings.\n> \n> //[Mayfield softly chuckles before exhaling sharply.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** I knew you were special. No dumbbell could be that light. It's silly to think about but I really enjoyed your company.\n> \n> //[Mayfield uncovers his eyes. Both eyes are puffy and red.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** But for the love of god I don't understand the problem here. I honestly don't! [Coughing.] Are you angry with me? Are you tired? Are your magic reserves low? Whatever it is, y-you can tell me. I'll hear you out. Just give me a sign and I'll do it. Ivan? \n> \n> //[Mayfield turns around and tries lifting SCP-8114 with his right hand. SCP-8114 remains stationary.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Ivan, we can still fix this!

I had a feeling she would. I'm not pissed though. After all, my coach believes I suffered a bad ankle injury even though I didn't. I'm not a hypocrite... not anymore. I'll quit during break.

Mayfield shudders as presses both hands against his distended belly.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** I went for a check-up. Was told my BMI was bad, deep red, danger zone. It made sense: The pain. The stress. The symptoms. A recipe for an early grave. The prospect terrified me, so I sought to change it. And I did... but it's not this fantastic story I boasted about earlier. Although was is fantastical. I found a shortcut.\n> \n> //[Mayfield strokes SCP-8114 with the back of his hand.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** This was the shortcut. I stumbled upon this inside a cardboard box in my uncle's attic. It felt weird to hold so I brought it home with me. That's when it happened. All I did was a //single// bicep curl -- suddenly turned into the next Arnold Schwarzenegger and trust me things spiraled from there.\n> \n> //[Mayfield begins to rise up to his feet, he appears to be under tremendous strain.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** S-Spiraled to the tippy top, then came crashing //down.// I can't do anything about the dumbbell now.

He freezes in place, his clenched fists are now relaxing.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** Maybe it wasn't cursed. I doubled down didn't I? How much crap did I even eat? Did I even lose all that weight to begin with? Did I break it by pushing it too hard... or did it cut me off because I don't deserve it anymore?\n> \n> //[Mayfield remains, silent, staring at SCP-8114 before shaking his head.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** I suppose it doesn't matter at this point. What matters is that I've gotten from red, to //black.// My body has gotten way worse than I started: I've gotten heavier, this pain keeps shooting up my arm... I felt like I was going to faint when I stood up. My heart's drumming up like mad and I hardly did anything today... I think I'm actually dying.\n> \n> //[Mayfield approaches the mirror, observing his reflection.]//\n> \n> **Mayfield:** I've been exercising -- //real// exercise.
