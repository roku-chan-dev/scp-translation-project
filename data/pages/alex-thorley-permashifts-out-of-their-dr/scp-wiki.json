Remember when your department supervisor, of whose name is John Doe, went \"nope nope nope\" and dipped out of the party to drink a little bit of Soju?

This Present Plexiglass (not trademarked), different from the Previous Plexiglass (is trademarked) that makes You Able To Connect Like A Duplex But Also Extremely Static And Able to Dynamically Link To Other Libraries In Violation of the AGPL 2.0, has a little sheen to it, making you (Thorleye, not You you) feel just a little bit warmer inside yourself. It's part of the bonus insurance package that insurance company of Insurance Company With A Jewish Surname fame provides.\n\nThorley awakens without the Plexiglass this time, but Maybe Next Time. They hope that it doesn't happen again, the Plexiglass really hampers their work in Unreality Department of Unreality Department \"fame\".\n\nYou walk down the Unreality Department of \"Unreality Department\" fame, carrying the Previous Plexiglass (not tradmark) to the Unreality Department of \"Unreality Department\" fame. That Melon-Flavoured Soju With A Side of Chicharong Bituka And John Doe in the canteen looks enticing, doesn't it. Better save that for December Christmas Party.

You Turn Around And Encounter Your Best Friend Thorely And They Destroy the Klaxons And Both Of You Become Best Of Freinds Now.\n\nMeanwhile, Thorley (your baby, your friend, your real and true friend) always passes through the Plexiglass (trademarked) section in the Lowe's Hardware Store.

Uh. That. The Flexiplexitrihelicallycongugatedandsmexy-glass (trandmarnked) Is Scared Of The Thorley Inside Of You. I Think. Or Maybe it's just scared of Thorley's bank account and wallet being empty, as they stare at the singular Fly that appears out of their wallet. These December parties are getting more and more expensive the more Decembers that roll around. They hope that upper management approves of their budget request for a Soju Melon Flavour and some balloons as well. Maybe even deer feed.\n\nHey, did you know that the chemical structure of Plexiglass (trademarked) makes it so that it doesn't shatter into a million pieces when placed under intense pressure? Isn't that impressive? Sometimes Plexiglass (trademarked) is often confused with acrylic (not Tradmarkd, will never be trademarked), but in actuality, they are the same Product. Isn't that impressive? Did you know that acrylic is made with the same substance super glue is made out of, unlike Plexiglass (trademarked), which is made out of Oh hey, Voices of the Sleep River, what brings hath you gifts in this realm of Consciousness inbetwixt Reason, Madness, and Trains?\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n|name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/basirskipreader-themes/unreal_engine.png\n|caption= Hi, Legally Furry Version of Unreal Engine Unreal Engine Render 4K Artstation By Greg Rutkowski!\n|width=300px\n]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n\"Hm, this Time their X-axis is Borked 3i quaternions\", says Unreal Engine Render 4K Artstation By Greg Rutkowski, the Game Engine Owned By The Creatures of Frotnite and Crysis Which Unlike Its Competitors Is Not Named After A Concept Nor A Person.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n|name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/basirskipreader-themes/pantone.png\n|caption= Hi, Legally Ancient Version of Pantone Baint Book!\n|width=300px\n]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n\"Sorry About The Pantone Paint Chip Comment It Was Unbecoming of Me.
