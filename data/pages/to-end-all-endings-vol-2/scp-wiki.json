The air reeked of caustic chemicals, small droplets of the acid slowly seeping their way through the cavern’s ceiling.\n\nRamone looked onto the shattered crimson horizon, their lungs filling with the most-likely-than-not toxic air, as they could do nothing else, but stare and wait it out.\n\nSuddenly, there was a metallic //thud//, making her heart skip a beat, as [[[SCP-5000|Pietro]]]’s metal-enclenched arm fell onto the rocky ground, having lost all power in his limbs. She couldn’t tell whether he was breathing or not.\n\nShe hurried over to him, checked his vital signs. The suit blinked and beeped for a good few seconds, before it came back with the results.\n\nPietro was still alive, albeit barely. She looked onto his beaten-up face, smashed into a bloody pulp of blood, snot and tears only a few hours prior. He wasn’t moving.\n\nRamone turned around to see deeper into the cave. There, enveloped by darkness and dead silence, sat //Adam//, or a person looking like him, beaten and tattered up, but not physically.\n\nHe had made a makeshift fire out of the things the [[[SCP-079|A.I.]]] had not shredded into its individual particles. The fire snapped and roared only dimly, only providing warmth if close, his backpack aiding as the main fuel source.\n\nHe was hunched over, his back turned toward them, his hands meddling with something, as he was handling various tools, screws and bolts, in complete silence.\n\nRamone took a look at Pietro, and, after establishing that he needed some time to rest, walked toward //Adam//.\n\nHer footsteps echoed along the walls of the cave, as it slowly began to cool down. She tugged herself into the tattered remnants of her shirt and labcoat, as the cold sent shivers down her spine.\n\nHe didn’t even look up when she sat down a few feet away from him, still entrenched in whatever it was he was working on.\n\nShe tried her best not to stare at him, at his arms, at his hands, at his face, at the uncanny resemblance to the person she once knew. Then, with all the courage she could muster up within herself, she asked: //”Who are you?”//\n\nBut he didn’t answer. There wasn’t even so much as a look from him -- he simply continued working on the device in his hands. Now more forceful: ”Answer me!” Still, no reaction. He just stared at the little device.\n\nRamone was getting mad. Mad of no reaction, no answers, //no fucking clue of what the fuck was going on//. She rapidly stood up, her hands balled into fists, looking down at him. He still paid her no attention.\n\n”You won’t even answer my questions? You leapt out of //fucking// portal, talk about //’saving the world’//, beat Pietro into a bloody pulp, look //exactly// like someone who I once knew, and now you don’t even wanna //fucking// talk to me?”\n\n//There was a slight reaction.// ”I don’t have to talk to you.” Then he simply resumed with his work. She approached //Adam// with weight in her steps, an expression of annoyance and anger, but also that of confusion and fear on her face. //Adam// simply stood up, meeting her gaze. Ramone stopped in her tracks. They were about the same height, with //Adam// being a little taller. She just looked at him with an undeterred, stern look.\n\n”I don’t care who you are or who you think I am, or who I was to you before all this,” he spoke. He looked her dead into the eyes. She didn’t speak, but he could tell his words had some sort of reaction on her.\n\n”Now stop bothering me.”\n\nWith that, he sat down next to the fire again, the smoke dissipating in the cavern’s ceiling, fiddling with the mechanical device again.\n\nShe simply stood there, unable to take in the words he’d just said.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[# Part2]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Just Forty-Eight Hours after**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nHe ran.

His feet tiring, his heart beating, his lungs burning.\n\nPaul desperately tried to keep up with the commander and the other MTFs, but found his body slowly giving in.\n\nThe [[[SCP-616|616]]] entities were appearing out of the walls and ceiling in the dozens, all grining their wide smiles, growling their laughs, mocking the heavens with every word they spoke. It all ended in an unrecognizable cacophony.\n\nHe suddenly felt the commander’s tight grasp around his wrist, his fingers digging so deep into it it hurt. The commander didn’t say anything, didn’t even take a look at him. He simply ran toward a giant gate, as the other operatives were standing guard, some fiddling around with the controls.\n\nJunior researcher Paul had difficulties keeping up, thinking that he’d just collapse of exhaustion, but eventually they made it. The operatives tampered with the controls, as the reinforced door would not budge an inch. They cut and reconnected wires, their eyes straining in the dim crimson lights, sweat rolling down their faces and fingers, as they tried to override the controls as quickly as possible, and as delicately they possibly could.\n\nThe entities were strolling down the corridor ever-so-closer, their forms like moving shadows with too many teeth and too long fingers. The gunners with their holy water fired at those who inched too close, dissolving them in hellish shrieks, but the commander knew that they’d eventuay run out.\n\nWhile they were shooting or manipulating the controls, the others looked past the demonic creatures at [[[Revised Entry|the sculptures]]], their gazes piercing, their bodies unmoving.\n\nJunior researcher Paul alternated between looking at the statues and worriedly at the controls. He couldn’t tell, but he swore the commander was gripping his firearm tighter than normal.\n\n”Fuck!” one of the gunners exclaimed. He didn’t know what had happened, but he felt his chest tensing up. ”I’ve run out!” she finally said. The commander wanted to say something, but didn’t.\n\nAs the demons growled, rows of teeth lined-up in their mouths, claws outstretched, there was a spark, and the gate finally opened. Immediately, the MTF operatives hurried Paul inside, then one-by-one went through themselves.\n\nThe creatures seemed to notice, as they hastened their pursuit, as the last, the commander, stepped through, the gate shut tight, layers upon layers seperating his squad and the researcher from the creatures. His eyes lingered a little longer at the end of the hallway, the gazes of the statues meeting his.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nThe technicians were running around, looking at the monitors in the dim light, trying to maintain control during the ongoing crisis.\n\n”Madellyn, what’s the status of generators 24 to 30?!” Jasper shouted, while rerouting all of the unnecessary power from the unnecessary //(or rather lower priority)// sectors to the control and containment wings.\n\n”Less than ideal!” she’d reply, frantically looking upon the blinking status bars. //They were not looking good.// ”Should I reroute the remaining power to the Tesla gates in the Keter-wing?”\n\n”Negative!

Even the commander’s.\n\nThere was a relentless pounding against the metal gate, as the entities screeched and howled, trying to tear their way through, bite, claw. There were masses of them now, as all of the pounding amassed into one loud dissonant sound.\n\nThere was another door that required fiddling. Some of the operatives were already on it. After what seemed like a whole minute, the commander finally snapped back alive again, looking around his surroundings, then returning to that straight stance of his again.\n\n”We’ll head toward evac point 345-D! It’s the closest one, shouldn’t be all too much trouble.” He glanced around the room, ”Nothing we haven’t survived already.”\n\nEveryone was silent. The few just stood there with an expression of uncertainty, clasping their firearms tightly, while others just nodded.\n\n”We’ll get out of this alive,” the commander finally spoke. ”And if we don’t...” There was a long pause. ”Then we’ll make damn sure we take as much of these fuckers with us as we possibly can.”\n\nThe pounding only became louder. More relentless. Junior researcher Paul backed away from the gate, looking on in horror as the operatives were still messing with the controls.\n\n”Command! Do you copy?” the commander spoke into his comm. //No response.// He saw some of the surrounding operatives look at each other.\n\nAgain, now with more of a raised voice: ”Command? Director Light! //Do you copy!//” Still, //no response.// ”Shit!” he said, to no one in particular.\n\nAnd then the lights went out. Everything was plunged into pitch black, their pupils widening to make out even the faintest outlines of silhouettes. The klaxons had turned off, too; Paul found the ringing in his ears to have stopped.\n\nThe creatures were still pounding relentlessly at the gate, their screeches becoming ever-so-louder... and then they all fell silent. //All at once.//\n\nBefore anyone had the chance to form a coherent thought, the unbearable noise of metal grinding against metal echoed in their ears, as it sounded like something heavy was being pushed aside, moving inch by inch.\n\nThen it //clicked//. The commander raised their gun, the metal-on-metal sound growing in intensity by the seconds, as he activated the flashlight mounted onto his gun, and pointed it at the gate.\n\nThen their pupils shrunk again, as everything was plunged into the faint strobe lights above, giving off a continous //buzzing//, as many rubbed their eyes. When the commander had adjusted to his surroundings again, he saw exactly what he suspected to see. And the others were, too.\n\nIn front of them, with its cold, uncaring gaze, the [[[SCP-173|sculpture]]] stood, its concrete and rebar arms pressed against the doors of the gate, its fingers firmly grasping the edges of them, as it had pushed them away in the pitch blackness.\n\nNow, however, it had stopped, the back-up generators having kicked in. Its head was somewhat tilted. Reflexively, the commander aimed at the sculpture’s head, and fired, chipping a piece of it right off -- //it didn’t budge.//\n\nA spark flew, causing the commander to tense up, come back to reality again, snap out of his mindless stare at the statue. He looked on the floor, the demonic entities from earlier all lying motionlessly onto it, their necks twisted into an unnatural angle.\n\nHis team members tapped him on the shoulder, as they gestured to him to finally fucking move his ass, with even the junior researcher having already went through the door.\n\nThe technicians of the squad fiddled with the controls again, this time on the other side, creating a spark, and the door closed as soon as it opened.\n\nHe looked behind him through the small ballistic glass view-port of the door, gazing back at the sculpture, as the lights began to flicker, and in the blink of an eye, the sculpture pressed up right against the door. The glass laid smashed in itsy-bitsy fragments on the linoleum floor.\n\nThe commander began to run even faster.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[# Part3]]\n\n[[=]]\n**On a Cold Autumn Night**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nRamone burst through the entrance, her feet stepping onto the cold concrete pavement.\n\nHer tears streaked down her cheeks, giving off a slight tingling sensation, before she wiped them off with the back of her hand.

Just as his fingers were typing in the first few letters, static mounted onto the screen, with nothing that he did having an effect.\n\nThe device gave off one last //whirr//, before it completely shut down again. //Adam// was holding a metallic husk in his hands, a jumble of loose wires and whatnot, coated in his sweat, as he silently stared at the black screen. He dropped the device against the rocky ground, the fire before him having nearly extinguished in the meantime. He simply looked onto the dying flame, as its sparks danced and shone dimly.\n\nRamone was by Pietro’s side. Although she couldn’t see his chest, encased in that heap of metal, Pietro was breathing more noticeably now, sucking the air in through his nose at irregular intervals.\n\nShe looked back over at //Adam//, who had his head in his hands. Suddenly, she felt the cold sensation of the suit putting its hand on her. She looked at Pietro, who looked back at her, his mouth somewhat agape to breathe better. He smiled a rough smile.\n\n”Are... y--you all... right?” he mumbled.\n\n”Yes,” she answered. She smiled back. Pietro smiled even brighter now.\n\n”I...” he stuttered.

I...” The words were stuck in his throat.\n\n”I trie-- tried to do... the right... thing,” Pietro finally brought out.\n\nNo one noticed, but //Adam// clenched his hands into fists. His veins were pulsating, his heart was beating rapidly. ”Do the right thing?” He stood up. ”You thought you were doing the //right// thing by giving away the only hope humanity had left?”\n\nPietro said nothing. His smile dissipated, his eyes averted. Ramone didn’t stand up, but was still on her toes.\n\n”You had the chance of doing the right thing!” //Adam// nearly shouted. There were tears in his eyes. ”You had the chance of doing the right thing, and you didn’t take it, because you’re a //fucking **coward!**//”\n\n”We would’ve died!” Pietro suddenly shouted. Ramone and //Adam// both remained silent. ”We would’ve been dead! The three of us. I...”\n\nTears were welling up in his eyes now. ”I tried, okay? I tried... to save... all of us.”\n\n//Adam// took a few steps toward Pietro, his gaze never averting from him, both of his hands still clenched into fists. Ramone wanted to stand up, but //Adam// suddenly halted, remaining at a distance. ”The only one you tried to save was //yourself//,” he spoke. Pietro didn’t say anything in return.\n\nFor a few more seconds, he stared at Pietro. He wanted to say something else, Ramone could tell, but he didn’t in the end. He simply turned around and trudged back toward his fire.\n\nShe rose, then she spoke: ”The Adam I knew would’ve done the same thing.”\n\nThat was enough to stop him dead in his tracks. She felt fear unbearably pressing down her chest, but she remained in her stance, looking right at him.\n\nFor a moment, no one said anything. Just them huddled together in a small cave, acid pouring down onto the landscape outside, with their breathing being the only other audible noise.\n\nBut //Adam// broke the silence with his heavy footsteps, as he walked up to Ramone, until their faces were almost touching, until they could feel each other’s breath.\n\n”I am not who you say I am, and I don’t fucking care.

Pietro could simply nod, his hands still up.\n\nHe looked at Pietro for a while longer, before finally deciding to let him go. After an agonizing silence, looking back and forth at Pietro and the tracker, he picked it up from the dirt and tossed it at Pietro. ”You better be able to fix this whole thing.” He stepped away from both, as Pietro slowly righted himself, leaned-up against a wall.\n\nEventually, though, he did what he planned to do, and began messing with the device, with whatever tools were available.\n\n//Adam// didn’t even take a look at the process; he just stared out at the horizon.\n\nAfter about ten minutes or so, the device’s screen flickered back to life as it had minutes ago. ”Done!” Pietro exclaimed, as cold sweat dripped down along his face. //Adam// snatched the device out of his hands, and immediately began to type. He walked up and down, his eyes darting frantically over the device.\n\n//Come on, come on...// ”YES!” //Adam// exclaimed, tears of joy in his eyes.\n\nRamone had a look of confusion in her eyes, which quickly dissipated when Pietro tapped her lightly on the shoulder, and said: ”He’s... tracking down... 079.” Her eyes widened.

Not waiting for an answer, Ramone stepped up to see the answer for herself. Her eyes also became fixated on the screen.\n\n”What’s it say?” Pietro asked, feeling left out.\n\nThere was silence, deafening to the mind, which prevailed over all three of them.

Its long fingers wrapped themselves around her throat, as she felt the pressure being exerted around her neck slowly cutting off her supply of air.\n\nThe demon took a good look at her, tracing its fingers along her cheek, its claws etching markings into her flesh, as the blood trickled along its fingers, palm, then wrist and onto the floor tiles.\n\nShe looked up at the creature, gasping for breath, as she desperately tried to fall free from its grip. Her hands were punching against the arm of the demon, who didn’t budge for even an inch. It kept staring at her, its glowing white eyes piercing straight into her soul, mouth carved into a wide, teeth-ridden smile.\n\nIt placed its hand onto her forehead, dead to the touch, before it loosened its grip on her neck. Sophia slowly felt the air back in her lungs again, coughing with the pain radiating from her throat, before another kind of pain radiated throughout her body. Blood sickered down, her clothes were stained, as the entity began to wiggle its claws around in her abdomen, its nails scraping against her flesh, skin torn apart like paper.\n\nShe screamed. Screamed from the top of her lungs, her body jolting upwards at the stab. When the screams reached their peak, the entity opened its mouth and gave out an ear-piercing howl, before moving its body into her mouth. Its body began to contort and reshape, as it wiggled its way further down into her body. The life left her eyes, her body felt heavier, before finally falling limp.\n\nShe thought her final thoughts, breathed her final breath, before slipping into an eternal, silent bliss.\n\nThe entity slowly stood up, her new bun, her new clothes, her new body.

In fact, his excited demeanor only seemed to heighten. ”We made it! We fucking made it!”\n\nBefore he could say any more, footsteps rattled on from the stairwell, marching toward their direction.

One of them toppled and fell, fell, fell to their death. Their body looked like a squished mosquito on the ground.\n\nOne of the squirt-gunners aimed and shot at the creature, dissolving its abdomen right through. It quickly slashed at the operative, slicing open a deep gash in their throat, causing them to drop, coil and bleed out in agony, as they stared at the demon with wide eyes.\n\nThe pilot tried their best to control the metal behemoth, but a stray bullet hit them in the shoulder, causing the carrier to make a sharp left turn right back to the landing platform.\n\nThe commander, he himself having a wide gash across his cheek, grabbed the junior researcher by the arm, and jumped out of the carrier, pulling the researcher down with him.\n\nThey impacted the pavement. Paul saw the creature tearing off chunks off the pilot, before he shut his eyes tight, retreating into a fetal position, as the blades of the carrier scraped against the edges of the roof, denting, and sending sparks and debris flying everywhere, before falling out of sight.\n\nThe sound of metal impacting earth, dirt being upheaved, glass shattering, the moans and cries of the pilot as they neared the ground, and the unimaginable screeching of the creature rang out through the night sky.\n\nBut the screaming never stopped. He thought that maybe the pilot, or any of the others, had somehow made it out alive from the entire ordeal, but then he realized the screams weren’t coming from afar -- they came from right next to him.\n\nHe turned to see a large open wound on the leg of the commander, who was coiling and screaming in agony. He was dumbstruck, unable to move, as the commander held out something in his hand.\n\n”TAKE IT!”\n\nHalf awake, half in a trance, Paul took whatever it was in his hands -- it was an access card.

The breeze stopped, the leaves dried away, while the trees and the grass faded into obscurity, the graves and headstones crumbling into fine dust.\n\nAround them, tall concrete walls formed, then the outline of a large building. Their surroundings began to make more and more sense now, as the rough shadows formed back into the grounds of Site-62, SCP-004 ahead of them. The door was closed now.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**SITE-62**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nThey stared for a while at the old barn door, took a second to take in the barren concrete walls, the sky, the trees sprouting from every corner. The gate leading back to the main site, which they would’ve needed to get through in order to get to 004, hadn’t moved an inch.\n\nPietro was the first one to move, as he held the twelve rusty keys in his hands, the suit taking achingly slow steps toward the door, leaving large trails of his feet behind in the dirt. The others finally had the courage to take a few steps toward it, too.\n\n”Be careful with those keys,” Adam exclaimed. Pietro looked at him. ”The wrong key would tear this entire place inside-out. The seventh one leads to 62C.”\n\nPietro simply nodded. He squinted his eyes to better see the letters and numbers on the sides of the keys, all rusted, barely recognizable.\n\nRamani was the first one to hear it, although not the last one to do so. Loud, metallic clanking emanated from behind the gate, the metal bending and denting, as forces pounded against the reinforced gate.\n\nShe turned around to see...\n\nThere were many incidents, where the grasp of death was barely at an arm’s length, scenarios in which she felt the cold presence of oblivion shiver down her spine, instances where she could see flashes of her life before her. It was inevitable at the Foundation to not experience such feelings of dread, of finality.\n\nBut in all of her years at the Foundation, Ramani had never been so close to the face of death that she could feel its cold, concrete and rebar fingers lightly pressing against her neck.\n\nShe jumped back, but knew enough of 173 to keep her eyes trained on the statue, //no//, statue**s**, a side of its head chipped off somewhat.\n\nAdam turned around to face her, being met with the sight of dozens of statues standing motionlessly at the torn-open gate, their arms outstretched, their eyes unblinking. He could feel his heart sinking deeper into his chest.\n\n”Keep your eyes on it,” Ramone exclaimed, her eyes focused on them.\n\n”Wha--”\n\n”Don’t look away!”\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n> //Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173.//\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n\nShe could see the documentation right in front of her. Word for word. Adam remembered enough to trust her intuition.\n\nPietro fumbled around with the twelves rusty keys on the door, tossing those aside that would surely scatter their body parts across all time and space. Sweat rolled down his forehead, his eyes watering, fixated on that one single key.\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n> //Personnel [...] are instructed to alert one another before... [...]//\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n\n”Blinking.” His mind was suddenly filled with that singular word, so simple in its meaning, yet he couldn’t grasp it. To hear that word from Ramone no less, he was baffled at her sudden utterance of that word. And then it made //click//.\n\n”Blinking,” he said, feeling the freshness return to his eyes again, life invigorated.\n\nThe sculptures trained their own hollow sockets at them, gazing intently at them. Everything they are, everything they once were, everything they could have been, so easily wiped from the face of the earth by a single twitch of the eyes, a singular blink, a little **//crunch--//**\n\n”GOT IT!” Pietro yelled out, haphazardly inserting SCP-004-7 into the keyhole. He turned the key to the right and flung the door open, it almost flew off its hinges.\n\nThere was a gust of wind that breezed past them, nearly knocking them and the statues over. The wind was soon replaced with their bodies slowly being sucked into the door, unable to resist, nor have enough time to react.\n\nSpace and time distorted itself around them to pull them into the darkness of the barn door, a wailing and howling permeating inside their minds, until they left they world they had just been in.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n//...//\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[# Part11]]\n\n[[=]]\n**On a Cold Autumn Night**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n”Ramone,” Adam began, breaking the silence once again. Ramone was looking intently at him. ”I don’t know how to say this... You have been a great colleague and friend to me for the past nine years...”\n\nHe saw her attempts to hide her tears, then try to wipe them away inconspiciously with the back of her hand.\n\n”And I don’t want what happened tonight come between us.”\n\nRamone sniffed so loudly that it made Adam flinch a bit. ”You sure you didn’t practice that line beforehand?”\n\nAdam gave off a light chuckle. He held out his hand, his grey suit crumpling under his body and unnatural angle he had to move his arm. Ramone stared at it, and then took it, with only their heartbeats breaking the silence.\n\nThe seconds passed in the car, under the cold autumn night. Leaves were brushing by outside, the people still visible through the crystal-clear windows, eating their dinners on the silver platter.\n\n”You know... we didn’t even order anything there,” Ramone pointed out.\n\nAdam couldn’t help, but smile.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**//SO, if you only have one chance you oughta try your best to life as you like!//**\n**//One day you’re going to die.//**\n\n//...//\n\n//...//\n\n//...//\n\n**//[[[https://youtu.be/MX9LreOigJ8?si=7dV53CZmQsNeruCG|:)]]]//**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[# Part12]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Just Forty-Eight Hours after**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nHe felt his lungs filling in with air, before exiting again. His breaths echoed through the small room, coming in short, successive bursts, his eyes fixated upon the metal door, despite the flickering of the lights.\n\nThere were screams. Screams of people he didn’t recognize. Maybe he had seen one of them in the cafeteria, maybe in the yard, or on his way to the bathrooms. He’d never know.\n\nPaul was clutching a recorder in his hands, one that had been in one of the drawers of the cozy office, decorated with only the bare minimum to do one’s weekly amount of paperwork, Paul knew all too well.\n\nWith the //flick// of a button, Paul activated the recorder, and spoke into it:\n\n”I--I... I wanted to say that I... I...” He momentarily stopped the recorder, it giving off another //click//. He just sat there, tears welled-up in his eyes, which he wiped away, continuing:\n\n”I’ve never been one to, uhm... one to make a--anecdotes like these, but...” He exhaled loudly. ”I guess now’s the time.”\n\nThere was a loud banging against the metal door, the noises of stone scraping against metal. Paul noticeably tensed up, as the power began to dwindle more and more from the lights above.\n\n”To whomever finds this recording, please, fix this. T--there must be some way to fix this. Some way to prevent all of this shit. //There has to be.//”\n\nThe banging only grew louder and louder, before it was the only thing the junior researcher could hear. Each //bang// rang through his ears, the door quaking in its hinges. He took a long, stammered sigh. His hands tightened around the recorder.\n\nThe lights went out.\n\n”This is Paul Putsoiroytuorimaw.
