I'm RealSurrealSir. Welcome to my author page(let)! Go ahead and check out all //several// of my articles:\n\n++++ **__MAINLIST SCP'S__**\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-6094]]] - How to Spell //Lorem Ipsum// \n[[/=]]\n-----\nStyle: Dark Humor\n-----\n\"//Yep! Honestly it's been a fun couple weeks for the most part. You haven't lived until you watch a possum piss on a businessman's laptop in Starbucks while a raccoon pulls out the guy's wallet as he's too angrily distracted to notice.//\"\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commentary ■\" hide=\"□ I'm done. □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\nMy first article, not anything especially high-brow or overly conceptual. I wasn't trying to avoid an ambitious first SCP necessarily, it's just that the ambitious idea I've been working on for months was not remotely ready and I kind of wrote this one mostly while taking a break from it to focus on something more darkly whimsical, but just kinda got in the zone for this one and finished a draft with much less difficulty than what I had been working on.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-5496]]] - Site-43 Suggestion Box\n[[/=]]\n-----\nStyle: Dark Humor/absurdism\n-----\n\"//All site employees are to read this file in full at least once, and to be proactively apprised of any significant updates as necessary. Additionally, --monthly-- weekly reminders are to be given to all Site-43 staff that any complaints, issues, or suggestions relating to perceived issues with some aspect of their workplace environment are to be directed through the appropriate channels via Hiring and Regulation; and that there is not now, nor has there ever been, any sort of officially sanctioned Site-43 “Suggestion Box.”//\"\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commentary ■\" hide=\"□ I'm done. □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\nMy second article; simple concept, but really fun to write. At irst worried it might be a bit too silly to lend itself to a classic SCP article, but then almost immediately after //that// remembered that one of my favorite canons, **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard-43 Canon Hub]**, exists and might actually be the PERFECT setting to incorporate something like a malevolent suggestion box. Helped that some of the existing characters (i.e. Dir. McInnis, DHarold Blank, and ole --Willie Wettle-- SCP-7000-1) ended up fitting right in.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-6566]]] - Build-a-Boar Workshop\n[[/=]]\n-----\nStyle: Banal Horror/horror comedy.\n-----\n\"//SCP-6566-2: So first off, did you guys happen to bring your own ritual daggers?//\n\n//Stacy: …I’m sorry, wh—//\n\n//SCP-6566-1: That’s Ok, we should have a couple that the kiddos can borrow. (shouting) HEY KING? CAN YOU GRAB A COUPLE DAGGERS?//\n\n//A door in the back opens, and SCP-6566-3 walks out holding an ornately crafted dagger in each hand. Agonized screaming can be clearly heard from behind the door, though no one present remarks or noticeably reacts to this.//\"\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commentary ■\" hide=\"□ I'm done. □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\nEntry in DepartmentCon 2022, as part of the Demonics Division team.[[footnote]]AKA Faustian Jargon; kinda put further development on back shelf for now, but plan to return and add to eventually.[[/footnote]] It's a bit longer and more traditionally disturbing than my first two, but the subject matter kind of necessitates that. Since rewritten by myself to be more complete, more concise, a bit more joke-heavy, and also to just have a leas sudden/anti-climactic ending; so check it out *again* if you haven't read it since DeptCon! \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-4728]]] - God of THIS sea, at least...\n[[/=]]\n-----\nStyle: Humor, character piece\n-----\n//**Henson:** What, did you think that thing might actually be a god? It’s just a big salamander. Salamanders don’t even live in the ocean…//\n\n//**SCP-4728-1:** Oh I’m sorry, are your own gods native to your own environs? Did you share a midwife with your deity perhaps, growing up so close to them?//\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commentary ■\" hide=\"□ I'm done. □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\nShortest piece, kind a patchworked around a simple, silly central idea (self-proclaimed 'God of the sea' is just talking critter with a pond) and some funny quotes I'd imagined over a few months and saved until I had enough to stitch together into some sort of actual basic story.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-6850]]] - Feisty Fireball\n[[/=]]\n-----\nStyle: Humor, character piece\n-----\n//\"H.R. Weigl: No SCP-6850, I haven’t seen the show “Avatar: Last of Airbenders, people who totally had coming,” and so I can’t tell you why “Everyone so mean to Fire Nation” as I believe you so elegantly put it.//\n\n//SCP-6850: Just is baffling to me.//\n\n//H.R. Weigl: What I CAN tell you is that you won’t get to find out either if you don’t focus, because I gave you your TV privileges but can just as easily take them away.//\n\n...\n\n//SCP-6850: Is just… Why don’t other element peoples just accept their superiors as rightful leaders and be happy for opportunity?\"//\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Commentary ■\" hide=\"□ I'm done. □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\nMy first attempt at a real character piece. I Noticed there's a lot of SCP files focused on anomalous or anomalous-affected children, but not much on //child-like anomalies//.

My giftee Cubard mentioned SCP-507 (involuntary dimension hopper) as a favorite, and he's also a fave of mine. Thought about it some and realized there wasn't much I could find involving the B.Q.s, another character(s) with multiple versions across timelines so decided to write about 507 from their perspectives.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++++ **__F.A.Q.__**\n[[/=]]\n**Why the theme, are you super into cogwork orthodoxy or something?**\nNot really; I like it as much as the next luddite cult, don't get me wrong, but I mainly just really like this theme. \n@@ @@\n**Did you mean to adjust the main title but leave the secondary the same?**\nNo, I tried to change both but only one took. (Currently seeking more knowledgeable person to tell me how to fix it...)\n@@ @@\n**Do you write elsewhere?**\nGreat question, hypothetical fellow human! Yes(-ish) I also write short horror stories on reddit, mainly /nosleep, and I also have a grand total of one (1) story over at the [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/recipes-from-infinity-manor Wanderers Library] Same Username; haven't put out anything there in a minute, but plan to return soon to some extent.\n@@ @@\n**Do you have a real name?**\nYep! Next question.\n@@ @@\n**How did you get into the SCP Universe?**\nAccidentally, as with most good things in this world. I was watching a Youtube video on some thought experiment,[[footnote]]I thiiink it was Roko's Basilisk?[[/footnote]] and the guy explained the concept of an infohazard. I thought that was really neat, so I of course went and read the Wikipedia page on \"infohazard,\"[[footnote]]As one does.[[/footnote]] which mentioned its use in this thing called the //SCP Foundation// universe.

I'm removing links as a result, but still highly encourage any visitors here to check out those awesome SCPs (literally just replace the SCP-xxxx to the last part of any other SCPs URL, if interested).\n\n@@ @@\n**Has anyone actually asked any of these yet?**\nNot a one! next question.\n@@ @@\n**Wait, so why are you doing it like this then?**\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\nAnd that's all the time we have for now, folks!
