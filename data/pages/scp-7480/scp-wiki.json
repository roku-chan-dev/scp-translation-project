As part of Contract-7480, SCP-7480 is allowed to request cheap cigars, various refuse, and a sewing kit at monthly intervals.\n\nDue to various interpersonal relationships, SCP-7480 is obligated to stay on-site. This will continue so long as Foundation personnel continue to interact with SCP-7480.\n\n[[div style=\"text-align:center;background:#FFFFED;border:solid 1px black;font-family:'reenie beanie';font-size:200%;width:70%;margin:auto;\"]]\n**C0^Tact- 5;x 4 sIX ZevEN**\n**G1vE sTI3ks, Hearth, +ReAsure**\n**51qn YEs âœ“**\n\n[[span style=\"font-family:'birthstone';\"]]//Signed, Head Researcher Filia//[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7480 is a diminutive entity that commonly resides within dark and cramped spaces. SCP-7480 is reportedly uncomfortable when viewed in its entirety, and refuses to reveal itself unless lying prone with its rear hidden. SCP-7480 is generally wearing a mix of stained rags and newspapers.\n\nSCP-7480 is capable of short range teleportation in order to stay within its preferred environment, using it to either scavenge materials or discretely make contact with people. Although this property can potentially be used to escape containment, SCP-7480 is content with its current quality of life.\n\n[[div style=\"background:white;margin:10%;padding:5px;\"]]\n\n= ##blue|[BEGIN LOG]##\n\n= //##grey|Helena Aiolos is in the Site-12 breakroom.
