[[/footnote]]\n# The candidate will repeat the statement \"Yellow is the ugliest color in the world, and I wish I could never, ever, ever see it again.\" (This statement has been determined to be the most effective in initiating SCP-5835-A.)\n# Following the initial SCP-5835 manifestation event, the SCP-5835-A instance will be given preventative anger management seminars to ensure long-term containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5835 is a tutelary parasite[[footnote]] \"...while none of these types of reality-bending entities can be traced back to a single source, tutelary parasites all share a common purpose: defenders of abstract concepts from dissent. Though apparently omniscient, their potential for direct hostility is limited...\" Dr. Isaiah Henderson, __Advanced Classification of Reality Benders__, 1987 [[/footnote]] that takes the form of a male domestic canary[[footnote]] //Serinus canaria domestica// [[/footnote]]. It is capable of speech and answers to the name \"Mr. Cadmium Charleston Conrad Cole the Canary-Colored Canary, Esquire\", or \"Cadmium\" for short.\n\nSCP-5835 appears only when a human subject expresses a desire to no longer see the color yellow. When this happens, SCP-5835 will manifest before the human subject, remove their ability to perceive yellow, then disappear. (The location of SCP-5835 between manifestation events is unknown.) Subjects have described yellow objects appearing to be white or gray.\n\nWhile the perception of the color yellow is not necessary for human life[[footnote]] It should be noted that Junior Researcher Jacobs became an instance of SCP-5835-A by writing this article. [[/footnote]], SCP-5835 will continue to manifest before the subject, harassing them with facts about the color and its apparent importance. During this time, the subject is designated SCP-5835-A. \n\nSCP-5835 will continue its binding to SCP-5835-A until either the apology or death of the subject. Multiple instances of SCP-5835-A cannot exist at the same time. \n\nAdditionally, as demonstrated by SCP-5835-13 and corresponding behavioral citations, SCP-5835 is unaffected by blunt-force trauma and gunfire. \n\n**Addendum: Manifestation Logs for SCP-5835-16**\n\n++++ First Manifestation:\n\n> **Date:** 7/12/2017\n> \n> **Location:** Site-59, Testing Room B12\n> \n> **Time:** 09:35 EST\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **Dr. Mundy:** Read from the sheet of paper.\n> \n> **D-29583:** Um... \"I hate yellow.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Mundy:** Use the exact wording.\n> \n> **D-29583:** What?\n> \n> **Dr. Mundy:** Your cooperation is mandatory.\n> \n> **D-29583:** I said I hate yellow.
