Edifices and natural environments are to be remodeled to temporarily accommodate the new body structures and nature of human beings. A worldwide return to the standard human form is expected within three months.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[ + | OUTDATED CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES]\" hide=\"[ - | OUTDATED CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES]\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nThe Czech Republic is to be monitored for manifestations of SCP-6883, while MTF Kappa-083 (\"Surrealist Catchers\") is mandated to track any SCP-6883-1 instances. Meanwhile, Foundation webcrawlers must focus on keywords such as 'human cockroach', 'vermin', 'mid-life crises', and 'metamorphosis'.\n\nPsychological counseling and interviews are to be provided to select victims, particularly Foundation personnel. A review of work ethics and standards in the Foundation is pending for Foundation personnel.\n\n**Update (May 3, 2025):** Containment Procedures are to be applied worldwide. All reports, publications, or posting of disappearances related to SCP-6883 must be removed from the Internet.\n\n**Update (June 7, 2025):** As per the orders of the Administrator, the Foundation is mandated to switch from combatting the spread of SCP-6883-1 to promoting and providing aftercare for affected individuals.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n\nSCP-6883 refers to the spontaneous transfiguration of human individuals, generally workers and salary people, into human-sized entities resembling the American cockroach (//Periplaneta americana//). It is mainly localized to 12 cities in the Czech Republic, particularly in Prague.\n\nThe primary victims of SCP-6883, designated SCP-6883-1, are individuals who suffer from moderate or severe depression, are overworked, and have experienced burnout episodes. Another common trait is that they have histories of failures, as well as traumatic events.\n\nSCP-6883 manifestations primarily occur at nighttime, when the victims have entered deep sleep. After approximately two hours of deep sleep, a cocoon will rapidly wrap around the subject, demanifesting after the individual wakes up, now a fully-turned SCP-6883-1 instance. Once converted, the individual will experience limited mobility and cognitive dissonance, although their sanity notably remains at a baseline level over long observation periods. Attempts to break the cocoons have unilaterally ended in failure. Noospheric, memetic, and psychological techniques are similarly ineffective in communicating with the victim.\n\nInterviews indicate that the dreams of SCP-6883-1 instances mainly occur from the first-person point of view and consist of crawling through a variety of landscapes, greeneries, and empty fields with intensified feelings of euphoria.\n\nMany instances have often described a Baroque-style castle overgrown with trees, referred to as SCP-6883-2. It is described as featuring towers composed of documents, papers, and office supplies. Notably, Foundation personnel report that this castle evoked strong nostalgia and longing. Upon entering SCP-6883-2, the subjects report experiencing a feeling of lightheadedness, which is followed by cessation of sleep.\n\nThey also report seeing SCP-6883-3, often described as 'building-sized piles of scrap and blocks' composed of foliage, machines, and several greeneries, that can assemble into a man'. SCP-6883-1 instances often express mild hostility upon discussion of SCP-6883-3, calling it an affront to their happiness. In reality, SCP-6883-3 refers to the 43,500 metric tons of metallic and organic blocks currently stored in Site-345, near the Alpine Mountains delineating Italy and Austria.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Aviatica Background Report__**\n\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n| name=birb.png\n| caption= GoI-503's logo since 1990.\n| width=300px]]\n\nAnalysis indicates that SCP-6883 is connected with GoI-503 ([[[*scp-5631|\"Aviatica\"]]])[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]An anomalous journalistic organization focused on publicity stunts and large-scale social change.[[/span]], which in turn links back to the Administrator, a former reporter and journalist. As Aviatica is decentralized and composed of journalistic cells led by an officer called an Arch-editor, as well as its dealings with the anomalous world, regular contact with its constituents has been difficult to fully establish, although delegations are sent to entertain Aviatica's offers. Aviatica primarily compensates for its insufficient manpower and physical scope via the use of avian drones, robotics, software, and information-based deals.\n\nDue to Aviatica's connections with several high-profile news outlets and anomalous groups, the Foundation currently pursues a cordial working relationship with it as a source of information in the anomalous and occult in exchange for secrecy, protecting journalists and providing potential scoops. Meanwhile, both GoIs are receptive to inculcating each other's members. \n\nThe Administrator has approximately 10 years of service under Aviatica, before moving to the Foundation as an Agent. They have been involved in the highly classified EVNT-ALPINE-01, an Aviatican expedition to the Western parts of the Alpine Mountains to investigate an anomaly connected to SCP-6883, as well as a failed peace treaty involving several anomalous entities such as the **##green|life-givers of the forest.##**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__O5-13 Interview-6883 Report__**\n\nO5-13, stationed in the Czech Republic, is one of the individuals affected by SCP-6883.

However, the thaumaturgic readings we got from ya back at the castle are almost similar to what you're scatterin' around in this place. That's the gist of it.\n\n**##brown|Dr. Gregorius:##** Look, K.,  I'm sorry, but you guys have a few screws loose.

Look, Gregor, this is for our own sake. At that same place, at the Castello, something related to cockroaches is reappearing again.

At the same time, you stink of the same readings involved with those roaches.\n\n**##brown|Dr. Gregorius:##** Cockroaches, huh.

It was crushed by an assembled SCP-6883-3, based on the Administrator's visions.\n| width=100%]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Personnel Involved:** **##brown|Sandford Gregorius##** (Junior Aviatica Reporter), **##green|Mr. K##** (Aviatica Officer)\n[[/div]] \n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//A younger version of the Administrator is seated on the steps leading to the interior of a Baroque-style church in Broumov, Czech Republic. The church is unidentifiable and does not correspond to any known structure. However, it has a generally typical appearance with large spikes on its roof and a belfry tower nearby, save for massive overgrowth and foliage surrounding it. Meanwhile, a silhouette of a 100-meter-tall humanoid entity, SCP-6883-3, can be seen in the distance. The stomping of the entity can be heard, although the Administrator ignores it.//\n\n//As he tries to stop a cockroach pestering him via his hands, the Administrator briefly enters the church. The song 'Waymaker' can be heard playing, while wooden automatons clad in navy blue and black, with armbands bearing the Aviatica logo, can be seen.//\n\n//A casket can be found near the altar, surrounded by wreathes of flowers such as chrysanthemum and calla lilies. Most people had left, as the service had apparently ended. The Administrator converses with one automaton whose face is significantly blurred who called him, although he sighs. The automatons breaks into cockroach shells.//\n\n//After 30 minutes, the service concludes. The people then leave, heading towards the cemetery. Everyone is grouped in knots of three or five.//\n\n//Now with the casket interred in the cemetery, Mr. K, one of the few individuals with an organic appearance, approaches him. They talk on a nearby bench.//\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Yo, Gregor. <//Waves hand, as he takes a seat beside the Administrator. Both are silent for at least 30 seconds.//> I'm sorry for your loss. \n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius:##** ... Don't be so... ah well...  <//The Administrator's hands curl up into balls, but then relax after a while.//>\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** <//Looks around.//> At least she would have liked this weather. You know, the girl in red... what's her name aga - <//Turns silent.//> It's a good thing we managed to at least get her back.\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius:##** ...I suppose. It would have been somewhat cruel if, if she did not have the chance to at least see the damned sky. She often joked that it was so cloudy whenever she was in this godforsaken place. Even Britain showed her some of the sun, she said.\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** From the looks of it... that girl, you know, she seemed to have really seen a lot of places. Lots of memories. Though it's sad that she got hit by those fuckers. \n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius:##** Her parents, you know, even forgot their only daughter when I approached them about the funeral... those Fae... apparently, the Foundation had gotten 'em. Can't be sure where they are now exactly, or how they're rotting in a cell somewhere.\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** ...Well, let's, let's just... wait. I think I remember something now about the girl. A very faint memory, I guess. Gregor, do you know the one about the pen? I remember seeing it in an in-depth investigation of Crea.\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius:##** Hmmn... ah. The good ol' party trick Crea used to do. What of it?\n\n//Mr. K takes out several Faber-Castell pens, all of which are dotted with holes near the knib. He ties a chrysanthemum flower and a string to each pen, before throwing them into the sky. The pens shoot up like a rocket, scattering red, blue, and yellow water.//\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Compression... I never got tired of this trick.\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** I jogged my head a lot of times, and I think these pens saved us once. Don't exactly know where, but I remember them zipping through like firecrackers through a sea of...\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Damned corporate beetle fairies. They had this stench that I can still smell up to now. When I remember it, the deal we tried to broker so that everyone - humans, faeries, fuck-ups, everything - could live in peace. Too bad we overstepped as journalists, so they say.\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Beetles, huh? Crea used to be amazed by those. Back when we were kids, we used to get a very long tube or stick up, poke some trees in the middle of nowhere, and those beetles would fall. Then we scoop 'em up, or put them in a Tupperware container. (//Chuckles.//) Then we would be content for the whole day, at least until the beetles would start a revolution and somehow get the hell out of the container.\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Hmmn... it's amazing that you changed from that into a journo ready to throw flashbangs when needed.\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Well... that carelessness makes people screw up so badly... fuck that. \n\n//Both are silent for at least three minutes. The visor of Mr. K beeps steadily and more rapidly.//\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Ah, I remember something else that Crea said. Always give the last straw, the //poslední kapka//, or something like that. Even if it takes your identity. For her, it was for the happiness of the people. As a journo... well, I once told her that sort of thinking is stupid. As journalists, we hang out with motherfuckers all the time. But you see... she told something else. Do everything, she said. Live like a goddamn adventuring reporter, you know? Something like that?\n\n//The Administrator wipes his eyes.//\n\nShe also said some weird stuff like \"functionality transcends form and shape at all costs\", especially when we were comparing beetles and humans back then... ahhh. Damn it.\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** <//Sighs.//> Oi, oi, oi. Don't keep it bottled up. I know being stoic is one of your things, but... but, ah. \n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Oh well. K... I have been thinking about something. A question boiling in my mind.\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Hmm, what's it?\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Aviatica, you know, has that sort of calm, suave stance on everything. Not so militaristic - a very hopeful group of journalist nerds pushing for reforms and shit. Something, something like Crea, you know? But... you see, do you think the day will come when something drastic, a whiplash, you know, is needed for this world?\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Well... hasn't that been practiced pretty much everywhere? Most declarations of independence, 'round the world'. The Intelligentsia Uprising of the Free Ports. The Foundation-Aviatica Wars. Those times when the Philippines or pretty much the whole of Southeast Asia got fuckin' reset six times [[[*scp-5631|by our guys and a snake]]]. Something like that, no? Well...\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Well?\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** I don't really like those. The Philippines, for example, even if it got reset several times, still have nothing good enough occurring. Still a third world country, and in a state, you can't describe as 'better'. These events, you know, seem to bring more chaos than expected. I mean, sure, something good happens - would suck if that's not the case. In any case... <//A phone rings.//> Ah, something's come up. You ok if I leave ya here for a moment?\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** <//Fidgets for a few seconds, smoothening his suit.//> Ah, sure.\n\n//After a few minutes, the Administrator, now alone, begins to tear up, chuckling occasionally. The surroundings begin to drastically change, as he takes out a business card, labelled 'Castello'. It is shining, and the text on the card changes at a moment's notice.//\n\n**##brown|Sandford Gregorius##:** Ah, damn it. At least those beetles brought something good to me. Crea... damn it, I won't fuck up this time. I remember everything now... why, why I of all the people of Aviatica, had been brought to the Foundation.\n\n//A cockroach swarm then manifests, preying over the wooden automatons. Overgrowth of the trees and plants in the area also occurs, destroying the cemetery and making several buildings collapse in the vicinity. Meanwhile, the entity, now identified to be an amalgamation of SCP-6883-3, is closing into the Administrator, destroying the church in the process. The Administrator stands still, chuckling.//\n\n//The land where the casket was buried begins to inflate and rumble, revealing a large cockroach. It obtains several massive gashes that leak liters of colorless blood and becomes paralyzed at the end as it fights SCP-6883-3, although it wins and manages to return SCP-6883-3 into pieces. The cockroach that was previously pestering the Administrator also grows in size, and devours him. The remains, composed of bone and tissue, begin to turn into smaller cockroaches that then swarm.//\n-----\n= **End Log**\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n= **Begin Log**\n\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n| name=castello.png\n| caption= A room located in SCP-6883-2.\n| width=100%]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Personnel Involved:** **##brown|Sandford Gregorius##** (Just a normal cockroach), **##violet|POI-6883##**\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//The Administrator, still in human form, is in the middle of a medieval-style room, carrying a bulk of paperwork.//\n \n**##brown|Administrator##:** Ahh, you damn idiot.

The woman fixes her braided hair.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Oi, you, what's with the get-up? After 20 years, this is what your fashion sense amounted to?\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** You really are quite rude, Gregor, even two decades into the future. Is it bad for a nature goddess to wear clothing like this? Yes, I represent roaches, but technically, I still am a goddess, and I have the power to wear anything I want. You know, you know, it's boring to just always wear white, or a carapace.\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** You tell me. For starters, wearing wildly contrasting colors somewhat hurts my eyes. Two, the glass frames do not fit your jaws. Three, I don't think that this type of clothing is... //conducive// enough for things like human observation, like you always do.\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Hmmn... human observation eh. You see, Gregor, I was trying to play a scenario with this clothing. A friendless, ordinary, college school girl - something like that and without my memories to boot. Well... it's not... <//POI-6883 becomes silent.//> Well, it didn't turn out so bad? Dodged a few bullets here and there, and well... <//POI-6883's face considerably contorts, frowning.//> the worst thing I suffered from was being splashed with Listerine. That hurts a lot for a roach.\n\n//Both of them turn silent, with the Administrator sighing.//\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Any- anyway, how was it? The 20-year overdue stay, iya, more like an illegal settlement, at the Foundation? Up to this day, I still can't believe I managed to wring in those heathens from the Forest to help us out despite our actual plan with them, so you better have good results, Gregor.\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** ...it wasn't what I had expected. Two whole decades of backbreaking work, bureaucracy, as I climbed through the ranks from an Agent to an Administrator. Few, lucky strokes, I guess. But I kept my end of the deal when I visited you at the Castello.\n\n//The Administrator snaps their fingers. The room dematerializes, and they and POI-6883 manifest in the observation room of Site-354, where SCP-6883-3's remains are contained under Class-A Protocols.//\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Ahh, so the mighty //Uomino// has collapsed even under the Foundation's iron boots. If this wasn't only a vision, then I could mock him more effectively.\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** //Crea//, when we found it in the Alps, it was already heavily broken down, though still functioning. Ahh, I wonder if it has a connection with a certain nature, nah, idiot goddess here. Anyway, we delivered a grand beating to it, so it broke down into pieces we stashed somewhere in those mountains and then called it a day. Also, it was still functioning with a massive amount of thaumaturgic energy, so we implemented some tubing and cables to drain it. We'll be going there anyway, after I dealt... <//The voice lowers.//>\n\nAhhh, not exactly an easy thing to do, to be honest. //Treba//, if this thing wasn't attacked by those greenland inhabitants of... yore, well, the Italian and German branches would be in the dregs right now. <//Chuckles.//>  \n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Uomino... are you sure that It wouldn't be awakening anytime soon. It would suck if - \n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Well, I'm confident it will work. <//Takes out a cigarette.//> \n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Alright, alright. Looks like our next targets are focused on the Forest, Gregor... I almost couldn't hold it in when they killed me just a year after we made a deal. It was your idea though - we cockroaches are hardy and will survive fools like those, but we wouldn't be able to meet again to provide... emotional growth for you, I suppose?\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Hmmn... '\"Functionality over form\", right, Crea? If you exterminated them, we wouldn't have... an energy source for our grand salvo, and the Foundation would just be pissed. This is a game of planning and waiting, after all, as well as setting bets far into the future.\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Waiting, and waiting, and waiting... huh. You always made me wait, ever since we found each other as you ran away from your blazing village, Gregor.  Those beetles - the Scarabei - were really a blight on the world, and it seems that based on your dreams and fabricated memories, they really got lodged into your mind. Then we separated, you know?\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** I... ahh, I don't exactly know anymore. The stunts I pulled with my mind aren't particularly, well, good.\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Haah, it's fine, it's fine. Then you joined Aviatica - full of journalists who knew nothing better to do but want a better world by releasing the truth. You instead had to worry about your backs being shot by mooks, and nothing of actual note, aside from the stunts, happened.\n\nThen I had you got to the Foundation as a final measure - I do apologize for perverting your ideals as a journalist. But it was all for a chance to see if you can still fix the world, and for the sake of finding //Uomino//, that abomination. Ahh, I really forced a lot on you, haven't I? Still, you really... changed. Like a bleakened moth coming out of its cocoon.\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Nah... <//Sighs.//> It's, it's fine, Crea. You don't need to worry too much about that. Anyway, since our last... trial, no, test has failed, well, it's time to draw the conclusion.\n\nWe will head to the forest using a Way I know in Venice. Then, we will proceed with the plan.\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Ah, first thing. The Verwandlung. You haven't forgotten it, right?\n\n//The Administrator turns to POI-6883, appearing shocked for a few seconds, although they gradually relax.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Is it... is it really needed?\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Of course. You can't brace the full brunt of my capabilities, after all, even if you are already an Administrator. <//Chuckles.//>\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Ahhh, alright, alright. I won't... I won't budge from it now, especially if it's the only way remaining... one last thing. \n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** What's it?\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** After implementing the //Emergence// all over humanity, are you sure you can make everyone at least happy, especially at work?\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Hmnnn... of course. We nature goddesses don't renege on decade-old promises.\n\n//A pentagram then manifests, with the Administrator and POI-6883 inside.

A mass of bones, skin, and tissue are left behind.//\n\n//POI-6883, now fully identical  to an SCP-6883-1 instance aside from being 23 times the size, begins to amble forward; the vision of Site-354 collapses, reverting the surroundings into the medieval-style room. The abdomen of POI-6883 begins to inflate, causing the carapace to crack and leak fluids. Several cockroach swarms now appear at this point, surrounding POI-6883.//\n\n//POI-6883's ootheca sac drops from its abdomen after leaking several liters of black and green fluid. This also causes an influx of eggs, one of which hatches into a white nymph, whose rapidly growing size is comparable to POI-6883's. It molts several times in a span of minutes, with the instars, or intervals in between, only taking 30 seconds at most. The logos of Aviatica and the SCP Foundation appear on its mature carapace.//\n\n//A massive rumbling can be heard, as SCP-6883-2 manifests in front of the two, which then promptly board it.

It then fixed its location, hovering over the city.\n\nThree days after the disappearance of the Administrator, 80 percent of all Foundation Sites worldwide around the world lost contact with SCiPNet, following reports of destruction due to thousand-strong cockroach swarms. Physical entry into the Sites has been practically rendered impossible due to dense foliage, barriers composed of cockroach carapaces, and castle-like edifices. Meanwhile, all of the O5 Council members, save for O5-13, are reported as missing. \n\nFive days afterward, a Foundation Class-1 mandate was signed by the Ethics Committee.

Major Sites, such as Site-19, Site-24, and Site-120, are now compromised.\n\nFollowing the Foundation announcement, approximately 124,562,000 individuals worldwide, all of whom suffer from varying levels of depression and harbor feelings of mediocrity, have approached Provisional Sites set up by the Foundation over the past month to turn into SCP-6883-1 instances after undergoing thaumaturgic psychological techniques.\n\nAnalysis has only revealed that most of these individuals are only mildly affected by Foundation memetic agents and have come by their own volition. Meanwhile, more aggressive campaigns by the Foundation are focused on providing relief and purpose to citizens by turning them into highly-coordinated SCP-6883-1 instances.\n\nAfterward, these individuals are released back to their ordinary environments, with memetic agents normalizing their appearances. They display heightened levels of happiness, optimism, and productivity at work.\n\nAt the start, approximately 98,000 SCP-6883-related accidents occurred worldwide due to the lack of familiarity with cockroach-based functions. 11 Foundation Sites were then forcibly occupied by SCP-6883-1 instances, resulting in the release of 235 anomalies, all of which turn into deformed SCP-6883-1 instances. Due to freed Keter anomalies, many parts of the Americas and Asia have been obliterated. However, the world's population has not reacted negatively to the released entities or the incidents, and instead cheer and continue their daily routines.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Notice from O5-13__**\n\nThe following message is the transcript of O5-13's emergency declaration following the near total collapse of the Foundation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nWe are the last foundations of the Foundation, but we still have a plan.

All remaining thaumaturgic personnel and equipment of the Foundation are to be immediately transported to Site-354 and the Alpine outposts to commence preparations for channeling conduits into SCP-6883-3.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__\"Man In High Castle\" Report__**\n\nApproximately 81 percent of humanity has been converted into SCP-6883-1 instances, with record-high advances in workplace productivity, scientific progress, and quality of life, according to a Foundation update report released by the Ethics Committee. Meanwhile, the Foundation and Aviatica has launched an expedition to Venice, in hopes of luring the Administrator to Bolzano or the Western Alps in order to initiate Operation UOMINI.\n\nO5-13 was included in the roster for the expedition after the development and successful testing of the V-2 Eckernacht Noospheric Apparatus, a cerebral microchip which allowed for telepathic communication with other individuals. They were chosen due to their familiarity with the Administrator, lessened hostility of SCP-6883-1 instances in their vicinity, and augmented flight capabilities.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[ + | OPERATION UOMINI]\" hide=\"[ - | OPERATION UOMINI]\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n-----\n= **Begin Log**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Personnel Involved:** **##brown|Sandford Gregorius##** (SCP-6883-Ω), **##turquoise|O5-13##**, **##green|Mr. K##**\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//With the help of MTF Lambda-12 (\"Pest Control\"), MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\"), and MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\"), an opening for O5-13 and Mr. K. was created to reach the bottom of the central spire of SCP-6883-2 and enter it. Using preliminary data obtained by Aviatica and the surviving members of the **##green|residents of the land of green crucibles##**, they head down to the control room.//\n\n//Surveillance drones and data recorders attached to one of O5-13's compound eyes capture the interior of SCP-6883-2.

Kant levels indicate that they are now out of phase with baseline reality.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Yo, Harold and K.\n\n//The Administrator's appearance is a mix of cockroach and human forms, bleeding from several orifices, while a 50-meter-tall, bulging head, with one antenna missing, of a cockroach is located behind him.//\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** What a haircut you got there, Gregor.

These scenes are shown as they were in the vision.//\n\n//In Scene #1, Venice is depicted. An SCP-6883-1 instance, garbed only in a hat and burgeoning clothes, can be seen flapping its wings as it uses its appendages to row a gondola. Accompanying it are another instance with only a ribbon on its prothorax, and several smaller instances. The song \"Fame un spritz\" and \"Sarde in Saor\" plays in the background. Several Venetian landmarks, such as the Ponte di Rialto and Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, can be seen in the distance, albeit heavily modified with cockroach iconography.//\n\n//In Scene #9, Site-19 is depicted in the middle of a containment breach involving [[[*scp-682|SCP-682]]], which is now heavily modified with several antennae jutting out from several parts of its body as well as a flaking carapace. Cockroach swarms and SCP-6883-1 instances acting as Foundation personnel quickly subdue it in a eucalyptol and menthol bath//[[footnote]]Active components of products like Listerine, often touted as a cockroach remover.[[/footnote]].\n\n//Scene #2, meanwhile, shows a normal family of SCP-6883-1 instances, enjoying a dinner of normal human food. The largest instance smacks one of the smaller entities due to its rowdiness.//\n\n//Scene #4 shows Mr. K, the Administrator, O5-13, and Crea having a barbecue party, albeit with all of them now SCP-6883-1 instances.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Images from the present and the future... or what could happen with our plan to make the world a happier place.

Imagine losing your human form - aesthetics is not something you should mock, Gregor, just 'cause you are aiming for functionality. Now, considering you made a deal with a goddess from who knows where, then that sets an even more dangerous precedent.\n\nYou can change the world if you ask the fairies. The Sarkics. The Broken God peeps, and sure, something good can happen if you take the right steps and with the right amount of luck. But who knows if the result, no matter how perfect it is, will work.\n\nHell, even with insane shark punchers, I think the world can change.

O5-13 and Mr. K back down. However, he then relaxes, with his human appearance quickly returning.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Thank you for pointing that out... I guess, Harold. But you see...\n\n//The Administrator quickly reverts to their SCP-6883-1 form.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** That's another thing that I need to do in this new world. I paid too much for this opportunity, K and Harold. Crea too. The dignity of the Foundation. Everything, everything... everything, you see?\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Oi, that's the sunk cost fallacy, Gregor. One of the first few things we learned at journ school.\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Journ school... do you think it matters now with the administrator of a truth-bending organization. For this new chance for a better world, I'm willing to - \n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** I see, so you are prepared to even lose that part of yours. In the end, you know, Gregor <//Takes out a Faber-Castell pen from a pencil case.//>, if you remove the aspect of a journalist from yourself, don't you think that your actual identity will no longer exist?\n\nThink about it. Everything we talked about in these past few days, nay, even 20 years ago, was about you being a journo or you changing the world. Now... I guess you're just a man who blabs about changing the world... but nothing else.\n \n//Mr. K activates the pen - a disguised Scranton Reality Anchor -  warping them back to SCP-6883-2. Then, Mr. K and O5-13 are beset by several cockroach swarms, although they protect themselves via their PenShields.//\n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** Alrighty. One last thing, Gregor, we and your pal Uomino will be waiting for ya at the Western Alps!  \n \n**##brown|Administrator##:** Uomin...o? Shit, how the hell--\n\n//Mr. K launches himself into the air with the help of O5-13. His PenShield blocks any attacks from the SCP-6883-1 instances present in the area. He then throws the pencil, which then manifests into a reality anchor. Although the Administrator deactivates the anchor, it paralyzes them and all SCP-6883-1 instances. He lands near the window, signaling O5-13 to come near him.//\n\n**##brown|Administrator##:** Oi, K <//Holding the anchor//>, it's quite admirable you bypassed my safety checks for anchors via pen but did you just seriously think that this - \n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** Idio... take a closer lo-- \n\n**##green|Mr. K##:** <//Salutes towards the Administrator and POI-6883, with their visor shining bright yellow.//> Well, as Leggere often puts it, you should always leave a sort of gift at the house of the interviewee, particularly if they are an Otherworlder. Ciao! <//Signals O5-13 to leave a drone for documentation, and then escape together. Before that. however, he throws another pen at the Administrator.//> \n\n//After O5-13 and Mr. K have escaped the castle and into Venice, the Administrator looks at the second pen. Their legs lose balance, as the effects of paralysis persist.//\n\n**##violet|POI-6883##:** <//Sighs.//> A double feint, huh. Well, well, well... that was.... a fine play from your frie... wasn't... it? As for this... well, the good ol' compression trick, huh. Should've... seen it comin'...\n\n//The pen begins to emit beeping sounds, as Kant levels start destabilizing rapidly around it as the remains of the anchor also react with it. The Administrator is still holding it, however, but they soon emit a shrill scream. The pen shoots up from their hand, emitting red, blue, and yellow powder, before culminating in a nuclear explosion that obliterates the room and destroys the drone.//\n\n[[/div]]\n-----\n= **End Log**\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n\n[[size 110%]]FILED UNDER DOCUMENT TYPE TM-6883[[/size]]\n[[size 110%]]09/15/2025[[/size]]\n= **[[size 150%]]{{Timeline Log 6883-01}}[[/size]]**\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; margin: 30px\"]]\n\n= -- {{**BEGIN LOG**}} --\n\n= **{{00:00:25}}**\n\nA small mushroom cloud dominates the Venetian landscape, destroying approximately 10 percent of the city. SCP-6883-2 is in a heavily damaged condition, with several spires, battlements, towers, and half of the bailey collapsing after the combination of the Aviatican nuclear pen attack and the reality anchor. Mr. K, seated on O5-13, is escaping from SCP-6883-2 with multiple cockroach swarms in pursuit. Telemetry data indicates that they are heading towards the Western parts of the Alpine Mountains.\n\n= **{{00:05:16}}**\n\nA large, cockroach-like entity, designated SCP-6883-Ω, with deep gashes, manifests from the ruins of SCP-6883-2. It sports long trails of cockroach carapaces attached to its body. Mechanical tubing, wiring, cables, and tubes protrude out of its mesothorax and abdomen. Half of its prothorax, which corresponds to the head, is missing. Several florae, such as palm trees, azalea, and lilac, are rooted in the carapace. It then emits a shrill, hissing sound recorded to reach 140 decibels by an automatic Foundation outpost. \n\n= **{{00:15:21}}**\n\nVia somersaults and dives, O5-13 and Mr. K evade the cockroach swarms, although one of the cockroaches stabs a leg into the arm of Mr. K. before being terminated. Meanwhile, reinforcements from the Alpine Squadron have arrived, firing a barrage of missiles that slow down SCP-6883-Ω, severely damaging it. \n\nMeanwhile, Aviatica's [[[*scp-5630|SCP-5630]]] instances, which are thaumaturgically-enhanced bird drones, commit diving attacks on SCP-6883-Ω, delivering bombs. When severely damaged, they crash themselves into the now-bleeding carapace. They also explode into a black, sticky fluid upon contact with SCP-6883-Ω. The fluid has massively slowed down the entity due to its hardening properties.\n\nThrough time sinks and portable reality anchors, O5-13 and Mr. K manage to accelerate further. \n\n= **{{00:26:21}}**\n\nOperation UOMINI Mission Control in Site-354 notifies O5-13 and Mr. K via noospheric links that 10 more minutes are needed to distract SCP-6883-Ω. At this point, Site-354 now loses significant amounts of energy. A black-out is expected after 10 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, a combination of the Foundation and Aviatican dive-bombing attacks have crippled two legs of SCP-6883-Ω. However, 10,000-cockroach-strong swarms, several of which bear the Foundation logo, counter them.\n\n= **{{00:32:16}}**\n\nSeveral missiles and nuclear weapons originating from the Austrian border, most likely due to the assimilated German branch, arrive at Site-354. These weapons are terminated via the still-functional PENTERN system along the Alps, although two of them hit Sites-350 and 352. Thaumaturgic mages not assigned to energy diversion repel the swarms of SCP-6883-1 instances via Ways and railguns.\n\n= **{{00:40:51}}**\n\nO5-13 and Mr. K, now heavily injured, continue to resist the onslaught of SCP-6883-1 instances. As Mr. K's arm is no longer capable of wielding the gun, O5-13 has them rest and hang onto the carapace. O5-13 then wields a Gatling gun via its appendage, firing at the SCP-6883-1 instances while executing aerial maneuvers.\n\n= **{{00:46:11}}**\n\nMission Control announces that it is now operating at emergency power. Operation UOMINI is considered a success, and every involved Foundation and Aviatican asset retreat to designated safehouses. A massive rumbling then begins as parts of the Austrian Alps crumble. SCP-6883-3 is now active.\n\nFormerly a pile of blocks and remains that assembled upon sufficient energy diverted to it, SCP-6883-3 is a 100-meter-tall humanoid entity, with distinctive 'hat' and 'cane' portions. It is primarily composed of a mix of mechanical and organic materials. Steam rises from several holes in its body while gears and twines operate to maintain body rigor. A loud beeping sound, followed by bird chips, originates from the upper portion.\n\nSCP-6883-Ω emits a shrill hiss as it flaps its wings and crashes into SCP-6883-3 to engage it.\n\n= **{{00:56:11}}**\n\nSCP-6883-3 and SCP-6883-Ω viciously fight. SCP-6883-3, recovering from the battering ram attack earlier, knocks its cane into SCP-6883-Ω's compound eyes, which then shine from yellow to red. Meanwhile, SCP-6883-Ω stabs its appendages into SCP-6883-3's hat, tearing it, although SCP-6883-3 responds with a kick into SCP-6883-Ω's anal cercus. SCP-6883-3 launches a volley of punches and kicks, half of which SCP-6883-Ω counters.\n\nAs a result, SCP-6883-Ω's head bursts into pieces, although it continues to live and attack with substantial power.\n\n= **{{01:03:21}}**\n\nRetaliating, 100,000-member-strong cockroach swarms bind SCP-6883's legs, causing it to crash into mountains. Its facade is chipped away by dive attacks and acidic secretions, although it soon recovers. Meanwhile, a massive pentagram, composed of SCP-6883-1 instances, manifests on the horizon. It launches projectiles similar to a cockroach nymph, pummeling SCP-6883-3.\n\nThe fight continues for 30 more minutes until SCP-6883-3 begins to collapse and disassemble. Meanwhile, SCP-6883-Ω leaks massive amounts of blood while its organs, such as the gastric caecea and the esophagus, have detached. However, it continues to move towards Site-354, emitting shrill cries. Aviatican and Foundation flight assets continue bombing it.\n\n= **{{01:27:59}}**\n\nOn the verge of defeat, SCP-6883-Ω launches a 500km-wide pentagram into the sky, reviving all SCP-6883-1 instances neutralized by Foundation and Aviatica. However, most of these instances no longer attack and appear to act independently from SCP-6883-Ω.\n\n= **{{01:35:59}}**\n\nThe now-exposed heart of SCP-6883-Ω contains the mutated, half-cockroach body of the Administrator. O5-13 and Mr. K leave their outpost to attack it, claiming to know the most effective means of neutralization. Upon arrival, they throw a modified reality anchor into it, shifting the three of them into a virtual landscape.\n\n= -- {{**END LOG**}} --\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nO5-13 and Mr. K manifest one hour later, unconscious.
