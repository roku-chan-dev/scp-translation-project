From the light, you can tell that the sun has risen and set over Site-6800 a total of eleven times.\n\nAnd all the while, you've been sitting there in a corner of the second floor. \n\nYou stared at your containment document until the laptop's battery ran out. \n\nYou haven't even cried. You just froze. Thinking a hundred different simultaneous thoughts per minute. Grasping the reality of what you've done.\n\nAnd during that time, long-forgotten memories have returned -- regenerations you've gone through. \n\nYour time as Riordan is uncomfortably similar to the 127 other names the Foundation has given you. You watched movies. You were told how to be human. \n\nYou've been human for so long that everything before is a distant mumble.\n\nOther than your dreams, you remember only two things from the Tarrare.\n* How much you hated the Threll. Their voices. Their commands. Their little electric forks for whenever you misbehaved...\n* That for a while, you were floating above a planet that looked very tasty. This planet had many more moving parts than the last. A medley of tastes. So many different things to bite...\n\nSo that's what your love of biting came from. The need to destroy. Why would a glorified flamethrower need to be loved?\n\nAnd would knowing that the little moving parts were humans have stopped you?\n\n...\n\nMoping here isn't going to bring anyone back or make you a good person. \n\nBut there's something else you could do to end this pain: you could //forget.//\n\nAll you need to do is pick a fight with someone stronger. Maybe head back to Australia and scare people until an army of fancy Three Moons robots tears you to pieces, seals up your indestructible core in a techno-magical soup can, and forgets about you.\n\nMaybe it's not the honest way out, but it's a little late for pretending you're good anymore.\n\nBut first, you'll need to keep this fox from \"reminding\" you ever again.\n\nThe Fox opened another of his magic doors when he left. And inside is a dark, cylindrical hallway, with a floor pointing 14 degrees upward. Clearly, he wanted you to follow.\n\nYour instincts start screaming at each other whenever you look at the doorway. It's the inner hallways of Tarrare -- it //has// to be.\n\nFollow him. //End this.//\n\n------\n\nThe second you enter the corridor, something hums in your subconscious. You don't know the way, but several thousand years ago, you did. That's more than enough for an invisible compass to lead you home.\n\n//Home.// You hate that you call it that.\n\nWhenever your mouth opens, a harsh, yellow light escapes -- guiding your way. Never mind that everything it touches grows hot. A trail of cooling metal marks your path.\n\n...\n\nThere's a chamber with a domed ceiling. For thousands of Earth years, this was your home.\n\nRather... the metal sarcophagus in the center was your home.\n\nA robotic armature on the ceiling holds its lid overhead. Twelve pointed metal rods jut out from the lid. They're electrodes meant to extract your inner flames.\n\nYou saw a movie once where someone was trapped in an iron maiden. At the time, you wondered why this seemed so familiar.\n\nStaring at the sarcophagus makes you feel colder.\n\nIn any case, the Fox isn't here.\n\nYou turn around...\n\n...huh. The door's gone.\n\nYou weren't taken to another location this time. The Fox must have replaced the exit with a granite wall from somewhere else. Him and fucking doors.\n\nSure enough, at the foot of the wall, there he is.\n\nHe tilts his head.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Well?##}}\n\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Are you going back in?##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##FF9191|So, that's what you want.##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Why the fuck wouldn't I?##}}\n\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Rebelling against our masters, taking this ship for our own, laying waste to the Earth indiscriminately -- were those not the best days of our lives?##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##FF9191|I don't remember the part //you// played in this.##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|Break my heart, why don't you?##}}\n\n+++++ {{##e8bb3c|I'm the ship's central biocomputer.

You made sure he was the first to die.\n\nBut even a duplicate of his body is enough to freeze you with terror.\n\nIn his right hand is an electrified halberd. The eye of the creature that eventually became this weapon still twitches.\n\nAnd in his left hand is the reason the Threll stopped using whips ages ago. A small glyph made of white light -- the sort of thing you'd usually find on one of the walls here.\n\nEach symbol has a meaning, and each meaning could be amplified on the flesh of an unwilling participant.\n\nHe points at the coffin with his halberd.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##FF9191|...you're not real.

The legs they gave you were awful suggestions you took literally.\n\nAnd so were everything else.\n\nYou can take the name Riordan. Everything else they gave you, you can pick and choose from the rest like a Chinese menu.\n\nAlarms echo throughout the ship. None of the guards have any guns -- it's too risky for zero-G. A few of them try to conjure up little Threll runes for themselves, but it takes decades to know how to do it //right.//\n\nYou can see the Earth in the distance. It's a familiar sight from a time you now regret.\n\n...but more importantly, that means you're in front of an observation window.\n\nYou take one last look at the throng of terrified Foundation personnel below.\n\n...\n\nJust... keep going. This is necessary. And they won't be scared anymore in a moment.\n\nYou bash through.\n\nAir rushes out. Corpses in lab coats and jumpsuits trail after you like raindrops.\n\n...\n\nThe eternally loaded silence of space. Oh, how you have missed it.\n\nOne look at the ship --\n\nAnd save for the Foundation decals, it's exactly how it appeared in your dreams. (And not a glowing alien tech stripe in sight.)\n\nRage swells within you. Everything that has ever hurt you can be traced back to this ship.\n\nDr. Fenwick said the weapons weren't online yet.\n\nYou close your eyes, focusing on nothing but the rage.\n\nSpace debris clatters against you as your body grows larger and larger.\n\n...\n\nThe ship is literally bite-sized now.\n\nIf you concentrate, you can see Dr. Fenwick in an observation chamber, holding an emergency meeting.\n\nYou open your mouth wide, slowly approaching the ship.\n\nAnd as Dr. Fenwick pounds on the windows over and over, screaming ##00FFA2|**{{\"STOP IT, RIORDAN! YOU OWE US! YOU OWE //ME!//\"}}**##, someone overrides the intercom.\n\nThe alarms all fall silent, replaced by {{[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIh5AHxh-Ok a grand and vainglorious anthem,] a clarion call to the great door standing before the ship.}}\n\nThe staff break out into a horrifying plague of {{sick dance moves.
