The cell is to be inspected daily for both contraband and attempts to breach containment. Physiological and psychological evaluations of SCP-3860 are to occur on a weekly basis to address SCP-3860's attempts at self-repair and potential mental deterioration. Any physiological changes made by SCP-3860 to itself are to be logged and evaluated for potential threat to containment.\n\nSCP-3860 may be provided with mechanical and thaumatological components as means of coercing valuable intelligence. All components must be approved by both SCP-3860's primary investigator, a thaumatological consult, and Site Command prior to application. Any components which could potentially assist SCP-3860 in breach of containment are to be denied. Components may be removed from SCP-3860 to ease containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3860 is the former PoI-1115 (Vincent Anderson), a 67-year-old white male and former CEO/Founder of GoI-1115 ([[[Anderson Robotics Hub|Anderson Robotics]]])[[footnote]]A paratech firm specializing in the sale of anomalous robots, androids, artificial intelligence, computer programs, and cybernetics. Prior to its forceful disbanding, the group was responsible for several SCP objects and containment breaches.[[/footnote]]. SCP-3860's body has undergone numerous augmentation of various systems using a combination of thaumatological techniques and advanced prosthetic technology. These augmentations include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Replacement of both arms and legs with prosthetics constructed from combinations of aluminum, PMMA, polycarbonate casings, and white aramid fibers[[footnote]]Believed to be prototypes of [[[SCP-2806]]].[[/footnote]]. These prosthetics do not possess any discernible power source, and possess a network of thin cobalt-chromium alloy wires that connect into SCP-3860's central nervous system.\n* Replacement of both eyes with a complex series of optical lenses. Observation of these lenses during physical exams has shown them to be embedded with numerous thaumatological symbols.\n* Replacement of the nose by a single grated orifice. \n* Grafts of a white aramid fiber over various locations on the torso. These fibers have been demonstrated to weave into SCP-3860's non-anomalous tissues, and are capable of migrating to and filling in any scar tissue sustained by SCP-3860[[footnote]]Believed to be a prototype of [[[SCP-1360|SCP-1360-1]]].[[/footnote]].\n* Apparent replacement of the liver and kidneys with synthetic variations. Due to the inability to fully study these components without their removal from SCP-3860, the full extent of their differences from non-anomalous tissue is unknown.\n* A series of augmentations to various regions of the brain including the frontal and parietal lobes[[footnote]]Especially in areas associated with [[[another-goddamn-magic-system|thaumatological potential]]].[[/footnote]], as well as the cerebellum. \n\nSubsequent interviews with SCP-3860 indicate all augmentations were self-implemented, with SCP-3860 insisting it designed and worked alone on each one. The means by which SCP-3860 was able to perform these traumatic procedures on itself and survive are currently under investigation.\n\nSCP-3860 was initially apprehended by operatives of [[[task-forces#gamma-13|MTF Gamma-13]]] (\"Asimov's Lawbringers\") on [[[Austringers|15/11/2018]]], during a sting operation within the [[[three-portlands-hub|Three Portlands]]] Location of Interest[[footnote]]SCP-3860 experienced extensive damage during the course of this sting operation, necessitating its need for replacement components, which have proven a powerful bargaining chip in assuring SCP-3860's compliance.[[/footnote]]. Unbeknownst to SCP Foundation operatives, SCP-3860 avoided full apprehension until the joint [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|UIU]]]/Foundation raid on the Anderson Robotics Headquarters on [[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon|24/5/2024]]]. \n\n**Addendum: 3860-1: Interview Log 3860-6**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Interview\" hide=\"- Hide Interview\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3860\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Researcher Rose Labelle\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted on 29/8/2024, as part of the initial containment of SCP-3860 following its capture on 24/5/2024. The goal of the interview was to investigate the nature of SCP-3860's augmentations.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Labelle:** Good afternoon again, Vincent.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Is it? I don't have a clock or window in my cell, so it’s hard to tell. To what do I owe the pleasure, anyway?\n>  \n> **Labelle:** Believe it or not, I've come to talk with you about, well... you. How you became you. The amount of augmentations you've undergone is extensive. Really, it’s a miracle you're not dead.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 tsks.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** I thought the Foundation was of the opinion that one Vincent Anderson in the world was one too many. Why on earth are you going to try to make another one?\n> \n> **Labelle:** We're not. But you can't deny that the changes you've made to yourself are of interest to what we do here! For example, your ability to still perform both thaumatological rituals and incantations through your prosthetics as well as...\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Ah, so there it is! So long as the Robo-Wizard works for you guys it’s--\n> \n> **Labelle:** Well, you're missing my point.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Am I? Why else would you want to know how I became what I am today? I mean, did any of you ever ponder why I went through all this trouble to begin with?\n> \n> **Labelle:** That's not a bad place to start. Why did you undergo so many augmentations? Why go through such Herculean efforts?\n> \n> //SCP-3860 shifts in its seat, then pauses briefly.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** I had the means to raise myself above the shell I was born in, so I took the risk. Phineas helped at first but in the end I seized control of my form. I mean, I can read one-point font from half a mile away, hear a pin drop in the rain, identify your staff before they get within a hectometer of this cell by the brand of their cologne. If you could elevate yourself up above the normal human experience, and be a pioneer in that realm, wouldn't you strive to blaze that trail?\n> \n> **Labelle:** It’s tempting, sure, but I feel you're underselling the cost this transformation put on you.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 gestures at itself up and down.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Do you think I wanted to end up looking like the Pale Man from that Del Toro movie?\n> \n> **Labelle:** I'm going to guess no, you didn't.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 nods.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** I made countless mistakes in this process, and paid for it personally...\n> \n> //SCP-3860 looks at its right and then clenches its fist.// \n> \n> **SCP-3860:** A magician doesn't reveal his tricks, Miss Labelle. How I became what I am is the last thing the Foundation has to take away from me, and they won't get it. I'm sorry, but there is nothing else for me to tell you. \n> \n> **<End Log>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum: 3860-2: Update 2/2/2027**\n\nAs a result of increasing difficulty operating several of its augmentations, SCP-3860 has greatly expanded the number of requested components to facilitate its self-repair over the course of the last six months. A notably larger proportion of these requested components are believed to be of a thaumatological nature. SCP-3860 has likewise increased its cooperation with Foundation investigation efforts as a means of acquiring these components. SCP-3860 denies any change in behavior during interviews at this time.\n\n**Addendum: 3860-3: Interview Log 3860-13**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Interview\" hide=\"- Hide Interview\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3860\n> \n> **Interviewer:** MTF Commander Clarissa Shaw\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted on 13/6/2027, as part of MTF Gamma-13's ongoing containment of SCP-2806.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Shaw:** Good morning, Vincent.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** My good friend, Clarissa. Which of my fires have you come to have me help put out this time?\n> \n> **Shaw:** Glad to see you noticed the trend of my interviews...\n> \n> //Shaw hands SCP-3860 a file.//\n> \n> **Shaw:** While we've mopped up most of your products following your confinement here, the Gyrfalcon series prosthetics has been proving more elusive, most likely because they are attached to [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|Marshall, Carter, and Dark]]] customers. In exchange for a few of the components you requested from your repair list of our choosing, we want you to remotely deactivate them, if possible.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Well that is a fun thought, Clarissa, but it's not possible. \n> \n> **Shaw:** Why is that?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Because there is no means of remotely deactivating them. They don't have receivers of any sort, and deactivating them thaumatologically would have incredible side effects. You could send drones out to install a device to shut them down, I suppose, but that would require you to know the identity of the person to begin with. \n> \n> **Shaw:** So it can't be done.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** How astute.\n> \n> **Shaw:** Do they have any kind of thaumatological aura that could be remotely detected?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** The thaumatological components of the Gyrfalcon series are glorified power sources, so no. Can't help you put out this fire, champ.\n> \n> **Shaw:** I guess that's that then. Good chat, Vincent.\n> \n> //Shaw prepares to leave.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Wait... I do have one idea.\n> \n> //Shaw pauses.//\n> \n> **Shaw:** I'm listening.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Those robot ghosts that ended up in that [[[SCP-3560|pocket dimension]]]. If you have a means of detecting them, check to see if the same detector picks up still functioning droids. If so, you might be able to use them to detect the Gyrfalcon users.\n> \n> **Shaw:** Are... are you suggesting that these people will be displaced there when they die?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Hell if I know. Maybe? Like I said it’s just a thought.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 laughs briefly, then becomes sullen.// \n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Wonder if I'll end up there [[[Anderson the Alternative|in the end]]].\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum: 3860-4: Update 3/3/2038**\n\nSCP-3860 has greatly diminished its number of requested components over the course of the last three months, with SCP-3860 failing to make any more additional component requests after 15/2/2038. During this time period, SCP-3860 has become increasingly emaciated despite no change in nutrition levels and no discernible illness. SCP-3860 still maintains a high level of cooperation with the Foundation's investigative efforts. As before, SCP-3860 denies any changes in behavior.\n\n**Addendum: 3860-5: Interview Log 3860-32**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Interview\" hide=\"- Hide Interview\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3860\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Site Director Sasha Merlo\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following interview was conducted on 15/11/2040, following SCP-3860's agreement to divulge information about its transformation in exchange for an undisclosed service. SCP-3860 insisted the negotiation be held with Site Director Sasha Merlo, former CO of MTF Gamma-13, and refused contact with all other personnel regarding the subject.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** It’s been a very long time, Sasha. You've aged gracefully.\n> \n> **Merlo:** Same to you Vince, but you don't seem to age.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** How's Gabe? I see Jessie carried in your footsteps. A true Gamma-13 agent. Was that an engagement ring on her finger?\n> \n> //SCP-3860 sighs.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Did I tell you that my own [[[Priorities|daughter]]] got married a few years ago? Time just really gets away from-\n> \n> **Merlo:** My time is very valuable, Vince. What do you want, and what are you prepared to offer?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Right. Sorry. I guess I'm a little sentimental these days.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 chuckles.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** I am prepared to divulge, in full, all schematics regarding my personal augmentations. This includes all required rituals and surgical techniques. I am also willing to demonstrate their function on any person or persons of your choosing. In exchange, I request the termination of the Phineas AI construct[[footnote]]An AI construct created from a neural map, and potentially the soul, of PoI-45543 (Albert \"Phineas\" Frostman), a former Chief Operating Officer of Anderson Robotics and a long-time business associate of SCP-3860. Investigation by UIU operatives indicate that PoI-45543 was murdered by SCP-3860 prior to the AI construct's creation. The construct is currently in use at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]] as part of a joint project between [[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]] operatives and Anomalous Electronics Researchers.[[/footnote]] that was taken from my office during the raid in which you apprehended me.\n> \n> //Silence.//\n> \n> **Merlo:** That's... generous, Vince. Why?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **Merlo:** Why do you want us to kill Phineas? Again?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Because it’s what he wants.\n> \n> **Merlo:** I've interacted with the Phineas AI construct, and I hate to burst your bubble, but he's not exactly suicidal.\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Of course not. It's a protocol I added shortly after creating him. If he could self-end, or could even make the attempt to convince others to end him, I'm sure he would not waste a moment.\n> \n> **Merlo:** That's hearsay. Even if it was true, why are you making this bargain now?\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** It’s just the right thing to do, and now is the time to do it.\n> \n> //Silence.//\n> \n> **SCP-3860:** My systems are failing. I give myself two, maybe three more years. I'm just trying to make sure that I fix as many mistakes as I can before that. I can't undo what I did to Phineas, but I can at least respect his wishes. You're not a person without compassion, Sasha. I've known you long enough to know that. Please help a dying man.\n> \n> **Merlo:** I've known you a long time too, Vince. I know you tug at heartstrings and slip bills into wallets to make yourself feel better. \n> \n> **SCP-3860:** Then don't do this for my sake, Sasha. Please. Do it for Phineas's. You know he deserves better than this. Please.\n> \n> //Director Merlo shakes her head.//\n> \n> **Merlo:** Even if I believed you, I don't have the authority to make that kind of call. Can't budge here.\n> \n> //SCP-3860 nods.// \n> \n> **SCP-3860:** I'm sorry for wasting your time then, Sasha. I hope the rest of your career is fruitful, as is your daughter's. If we don't see one another again, well... we had fun times.\n> \n> //Director Merlo sighs, then turns and leaves.//\n> \n> **Merlo:** Goodbye, Vince.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3859]]] | SCP-3860 | [[[SCP-3861]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
