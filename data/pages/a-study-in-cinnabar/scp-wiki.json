The markers were all abandoned on the metal catch tray, because Dr. Dan — sitting with his head in his hands, elbows on the table — was out of ideas.  His subordinates beavered away at their computer stations, trying to remain quiet during his sulk.\n\n\"Felicitations, Dr. Dan! Whatever is the matter?\" Dr. Gat exclaimed. He was carrying a tray full of coffee mugs; he placed one in front of his morose supervisor.  \"Say, do you get sick of people saying 'Dr. Dan' all the time? One imagines it would become... irritating.\"\n\n\"It's better than the alternative,\" Dan mumbled. //And you know all about __irritating__, buddy.//\n\n\"Oh, yes, restricted personal information, so very secret society.  I like it.  But what has you in such a huff, on this fine underground afternoon?\"\n\nDan grimaced at him. \"You in the same briefing as me, Gat? You read the same documents?  Then you know how little we have to go on.  One lost agent's [/scp-093-recovered-materials info dump], a conspiracy wall's worth of cryptic clippings, and the [/lord-blackwood-and-the-land-of-the-unclean ravings] of a  mad, somehow sapient sea slug which form the only coherent narrative we have about the target.\"\n\n\"Well, let us assume that the information we have, vague as it is, is entirely accurate.  What do we actually know?\"\n\n\"Uh…\" Dan pushed back from the table. \"I'm paraphrasing, but we have some unknown anomalous being appearing on 093-E, an alternate Earth, in the 17^^th^^ century.  He gives out advanced technology like candy, and says there's gonna be a war to determine who is 'clean' of sin.  He says it's gonna happen in ten years, so get ready... and then he vanishes.\"\n\nHe smiled ruefully. \"Well, everyone goes to war anyway, because humans are already incredibly comfortable with self-destruction.  That's the last we hear of Him directly, if you can call myth and legend 'direct', but the people use his technology to make horrible weapons and wipe each other out.  We know the dominant culture still existed in the 19th century, based on Blackwood's journals, but in terms of actual firsthand information about Him? Goddamn nothing.\"  \n\n\"Hmmm.  'Weapons'.  Not quite the word I'd choose, Dr. Dan.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-bowe-decommission-part-one/Asterisk.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ Briefing Room A2, Area-09\n//Monday morning, four hours earlier//\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n\"Weapons?\" Carlotta leaned forward in her chair. \"What exactly are you talking about?\"\n\nSophia sighed.  \"Well, at some point during the war, the Holy Union of Land started experimenting with a substance known as His Tears.  It was supposed to cleanse His Chosen of sin, but it ended up creating abominations who walked the land and absorbed the sins of others. We have firsthand accounts of giant humanoid torso creatures that suck up and kill anything they find, and we're assuming they're one and the same.  Additionally, we've documented 'spirits' hanging around the dead cities, which can't be seen in person but show up on video; we have to assume these are also the result of experimentation.\"\n\nLucretia shook her head. \"Torso/head creatures? What?\"\n\nSophia dimmed the lights and started the overhead projector. An image came up on the screen, grainy and tinged blue, depicting a three-storey-tall detached humanoid torso [/scp-093-violet-test attacking] the members of a mobile task force.\n\n\"Oh,\" Lucretia nodded. \"That is very horrible.\"\n\n\"Yes. And the worst part is, they're not susceptible to firearms. At least not what we usually equip our MTFs with.\"\n\nDr. Dan piped up from the back of the room. \n\n\"We //do// have records of weaponry that should be effective. We even had a few examples in storage, at some point, and might still. I've got people looking into it. Until something turns up, anyone venturing into 093-E is best advised to avoid the torso party.\"\n\nCarlotta turned in her chair. \"Sorry, I know it's probably rude to just ask, but... who are you?\"\n\nHe waved at her. \"Dan. Hi!\"\n\n\"Very helpful,\" Sophia sighed.\n\nHe stood, and cleared his throat. \"That's //Dr.// Dan, surname redacted, and I'm the Director of ETTRA. It's my-slash-our job to preemptively, or reactively in the case of the recent [http://www.scpwiki.com/resurrection-old-foes-hub foofarah at Site-19], develop and implement plans to contain or neutralize anomalous emergencies.\"\n\n\"His department is also under the Project Resurrection mandate, so he answers to me.\" Dan was clearly about to say something clever, but Sophia paved right over him. \"We're combining our efforts on this one. Consider ETTRA a think tank focused on practical solutions that you, or our other assets, will implement.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Rainer. \"Dr. Dan Redacted... that's familiar.\"\n\nDan stuck his hands in the pockets of his lab coat and rocked back on his heels, looking at the ceiling.\n\n\"Weren't you incarcerated? For, like, ever?\"\n\nDan grumbled a response.\n\n\"Sorry, Redacted. What you say?\" asked Lucretia.\n\n\"Yes! I was locked up for the last ten years, for reasons you aren't and won't ever be cleared for.\" Boredom and irritation were fighting for control of his face. \"All you need to know is that I've proved my usefulness, and I'm out on a work release program.\"\n\nAn awkward silence settled over the room, as each of the Alpha-9 members openly stared at him.\n\n\"Okay, not a lot of moral high ground in this room right now. Until recently, //you// were a pit fighter for a Sarkic cult, //you// were in a medically-induced coma, and //you// were a reject from a 1930s radio drama. The only one of you who isn't a walking red flag is the UIU agent, but I'm sure Agent Deneb has some dirt under her fingernails too, or else why would she be here?\"\n\nLucretia, Carlotta and Rainer all started to say something when [[span class=\"shadow\"]]SCP-4494[[/span]] spoke up loudly. \"So, you're a criminal?\" He placed a hand on one of his shadowy holsters.\n\nDan's eyes widened. \"Chill out, Kent Allard! I did my time!\"\n\n\"That is //not// my name. My name is [[span class=\"shadow\"]]The Specter[[/span]].\" He stuck out his chest, even though he was sitting down.\n\nDan shrugged. \"Was that supposed to be impressive? I know a guy who gets a guitar chord from nowhere when he says his name.\" He shook his head. \"Anyway, it was a joke. Don't you read?\"\n\n\"Not really. My work keeps me pretty busy, putting down evildoers and enforcing the Law.\"\n\n\"He's got fifty-two rules about it, even,\" Rainer piped up.\n\n\"I do! Would you like to hear them, Dr. Redacted?\"\n\nLucretia and Carlotta both groaned. Dan smiled at them. \"Yeah, maybe some other time?\"\n\nSophia snapped her fingers, and all eyes returned to her. \"Can we focus on the matter at hand? Our initial forays into 093-E were brief, and only occasionally successful. We're going to have to go deeper.\" She smiled grimly. \"And that's not the royal 'we'.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-bowe-decommission-part-one/Asterisk.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ ETTRA Operations, Area-09\n//Monday afternoon//\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nGat looked dubious. \"Attending the multiversal bivouac yourself seems uncharacteristically brash, Dr. Dan.\"\n\n\"It's not my first choice, but I really feel like one of us needs to be on-site to get a sense of the big picture. It's either me, or Sophia.\" Dan grinned sheepishly. \"I don't think you've got the practical bent for an operation behind enemy lines.\"\n\n\"None taken,\" Gat smiled, as though Dan had said 'No offense', which he hadn't. \"But I do think you're underestimating the value of arm's-length delegation and armchair cogitation.\"\n\n\"We'll leave the first to whoever stays behind, and the second to you. I really think this is the way to go, though. Since 093 was originally tested, no-one's crossed the mirror. All we've got are spooky stories and some very visceral images. I suppose the Council thought it was contained well enough, as long as we don't activate the disk, but Bowe shot that theory full of holes.\"\n\n\"He punctured a great many pretensions with his sharp retort to the //status quo.//\" Gat stroked his chin. \"Unleashing an eldritch superbeing on the unsuspecting people of our Earth is so unsportsmanlike, don't you think?\"\n\nDan narrowed his eyes. \"Bowe wasn't playing sports, he was playing chess. He forced us to use anomalies against him, so we'd fast-track Alpha-9. Even dead, he's forcing us to keep the ball rolling. We're still playing his game, and please let's not overextend the metaphor any further. It is what it is, and we need to make the best of things.\"\n\nGat nodded. \"So, feet on the ground, field research and all that rot. Not a particularly enticing proposal, when set against the possibility of meeting up with these thrilling fellows.\" Gat pointed at the picture of the Unclean stuck to the whiteboard.\n\n\"Those 'fellows' are a good example of how little we know, though.

I need facts in hand, so I can start making my genius plans. You'll be collecting those facts. Think of it as... aggressive research.\" \n\n\"Not so good at 'research'.  Why we going?\" asked Lucretia.\n\nDan almost beat Sophia to it again, but she cleared her throat and he held up his hands in mock surrender. \"On the macro level,\" she said, \"we think these people, if there's any of them left, are about to declare war on us.\"\n\nShe let that sink in for a moment before continuing. \"On the micro level, //we// are going because Dr. Dan and I have both got it into our thick heads that we need to see it for ourselves, and given the fact that I'm an indispensable element of the Foundation's command structure and //he// subsists on three different types of caffeine and oxygen, we're going to need backup either way.\"\n\nLucretia cracked her knuckles with a theatrical flourish, and grinned. \"I can do backup, //and// aggressive.\"\n\nCarlotta and Rainer laughed. Dan blew air through his teeth.\n\n\"What are the operational guidelines?\" Rainer asked. \n\nDan's eyebrows raised themselves. //Better check the kid's service jacket, he's clearly got some experience,//\n\n\"Reconnaissance,\" Sophia responded. \"The minute you get serious hostiles, you exfiltrate. We're looking for intelligence, not victory.\"\n\n\"We don't even know what victory looks like,\" Dan added.\n\n\"Right.\" Carlotta nodded. \"So, what's the connection between the giant crawling torsos and our target?\"\n\n\"We don't know. That's the short answer. The long answer is—\"\n\n\"We don't know //shit//,\" Dan finished.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Sophia muttered.  \"The world is practically empty, but there's lots of documentation floating around. Even some computer systems left running, last we were there. Get what you can from wherever you can.\" \n\n\"Do we know the origin story of this multiversal crisis?\" [[span class=\"shadow\"]]The Specter[[/span]] asked. \"The content of their characters?\"\n\n\"We know they've got names that'll make you snort Coke up your nose,\" Dan responded.\n\n\"Come again?\"\n\n\"Alberious Farafan. Herverf Jakulsiv. A sweet little girl named, and I shit you not here, Lisstieria.\"\n\nSophia sighed. \"I'm glad you've been committing the important details to memory.\"\n\n\"Hey, these //are// important details. There are, in fact, no unimportant details where E-093 is concerned. I expect everybody who might come into contact with one of these creepy fuckers to be well and fully prepared to not snicker at their stupid names. We don't want an interplanetary incident because some MTF schmoe didn't expect to be greeted by Marlmolive Schlovokian or whatever.\"\n\nSophia snorted.\n\n\"As for soul searching, well.\" Dan shrugged. \"I doubt we're finding the secret Him bible. Which is actually a thing — part classic fire and brimstone, part otherworldly, eldritch mania — and it'd be a really cool thing to actually have. But this was an advanced society, at least technologically, so fingers crossed for something a little more... academic.\" He actually crossed his fingers as he said this.\n\nGat spoke up, over his shoulder; he'd been standing in the doorway, looking the wrong way. \"You will be entering the playground of a mad god, picking through the pieces of his discarded planetary playset and looking for the lost assembly instructions. I would caution you against expecting a rational environment, as I or you or I again might recognize.\"\n\n\"So, He's a reality bender?\" Carlotta ventured with a grimace.\n\nDan waved the question off. \"No, or at least it doesn't seem likely. He pursued technical solutions to the Unclean problem; why do that if you can just magic it away? Whoever, whatever He is, He went with the 'death cult' approach to get things done. That suggests practical limitations, to my mind at least.\" He paused. \"My mind is the //most,// by the way. But I do still expect input.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" Gat continued, still not turning around, \"that His worshipful masses regarded Him as a figure of awesome and terrible aspect, with powers both fantastic and frightening. If He cannot precisely bend reality 'round His knee, we should still not expect Him to play by the Laws of Cricket. All of you can no doubt attest,\" and he finally swivelled in place, gesturing at the members of Alpha-9, \"that a reality ruleset of significant strength can imprint itself on an otherwise mundane //mundi.// His connection to 093-E may be less physical, and more... esoteric.\"\n\nCarlotta blinked rapidly. \"What does that mean, Doctor?\" \n\nGat smiled earnestly. \"I have no idea!

Following it down its viscous trail of mystery requires stern vicissitude... and a healthy helping of blind luck, I've found.\"\n\n\"Ever so helpful. Remind me why I hired you?\"\n\nGat indicated the mug of steaming coffee. Dan laughed and took a sip, before coughing.\n\n\"Jesus Christ, did you make this?! It's like motor oil.\"\n\n\"Director Light mentioned you drink too much coffee, so I made it double strong so you don't have to drink as many cups!\" The tip of Gat's finger bounced off the tip of Dan's nose, lightly. \"It's all about gaming the systems.\"\n\nDan grimaced, but took another horrendous sip.

It was a very old mystery, at this point, but not the oldest one they hoped to solve.\n\n\"How'd you even get it here?\" Dan asked.\n\n\"O5-10 authorized further testing, for reconnaissance purposes only.

Well, I think we've put this off long enough. Who's going in?\"\n\nShe smiled.

She smiled apologetically. \"We've both got new regrets since 2007.\"\n\nHe looked at the small red disc, and sighed. \"That's... you're not wrong.\"\n\nShe plucked the disc off the mirror; it immediately emitted a soft green glow. She held it just a moment longer, then pressed it back against the glass. The reflection warped and wobbled, then faded entirely; the mirror now framed a vast, empty farmscape, covered in a verdant tinge.\n\n\"New regrets indeed,\" Dan remarked.\n\nShe pulled the disc back, and the glass swam into re-existence. \"Your turn.\"\n\nShe held it out to him.\n\nHe took it.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-bowe-decommission-part-one/Asterisk.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Mirror Test 6: Color (Orange)**\n>\n> Subject is Dr. Dan ███████, Male, 44 years of age, mildly atrophied muscular physique.\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**__[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/resurrection-his-will-be-done-hub | Resurrection - His Will Be Done]]]__**\n[[size 80%]] << [/old-faces-new-foes Old Faces, New Foes] | [/scp-093-orange-test SCP-093 'Orange' Test] >> [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Grigori Karpin and HarryBlank]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** A-9.png\n> **Author:** [[*user SunnyClockwork]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Asterisk.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
