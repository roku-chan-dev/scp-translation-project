Due to the endemic nature of the population, no further containment measures are necessary.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=pigeon |\ncaption=A Photographed SCP-6573 instance |\nalign=right |\nwidth=300px\n]]\n**Description:** SCP-6573 denotes the population of pigeons endemic to Site-357.\n\nWhile SCP-6573 instances are physiologically identical to rock pigeons,[[footnote]]or rock doves (Columba Livia)[[/footnote]] observations from site personnel identified strange behavior patterns across all instances, which are as follows:\n\n* They are passive in the presence of humans, rarely fleeing when personnel approach.\n* Instances shred scavenged and unattended food with their beaks rather than consuming it.\n* While they display mating behaviors, no SCP-6573 instance has been observed to produce offspring.\n* Personnel have reported feeling as though they are \"being watched\" by SCP-6573 instances.\n* Instances have been recorded \"falling out of the air\", and appear to struggle to maintain flight for long periods of time.\n* Site personnel note that instances \"walk weird\".\n\nDespite these traits, Site-357's SCP-6573 population has been steadily rising, measured at approximately 264 in the last population survey.\n\n**Incident 6573-1:** On 8/11/2023, Site Director Esther Sparks located an SCP-6573 instance within her office. After capturing the instance, she found the following note attached to its leg, coupled with a copy of the 6573 file.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nTook a gander at your review of my doves. Sorry they weren't quite up to scratch, but that's what happens when you wing it, eh! Lesson learned, I guess.\n@@ @@\nI even agree with you! I agree! They aren't realistic at all, but I'd prefer you'd contact me directly, y'know, so I can actually do anything about it. Still, the batch sucks. I'm abandoning it, just so you know.\n@@ @@\nWhatever though. Whatever. I don't care.\n@@ @@\nPlease, just tell me to my face next time rather than being weird about it, ok? What do I even do about them \"walking weird\"?\n@@ @@\nNevermind.\n[[>]]\nYours in song,\nLovebird\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nInvestigations into the whereabouts of PoI-6573 (\"Lovebird\") are underway.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=pigeons |\ncaption=Three petrified SCP-6573 instances |\nalign=right |\nwidth=300px\n]]\n**Incident 6573-2:** At 2:00PM on 8/13/2023, every SCP-6573 instance simultaneously underwent comprehensive petrification, the falling debris of which injured 15 members of staff, but killed none.\n\nFollowing the incident, on site MTF Psi-64 (\"Art Attack\") agents were deployed to recover all instances in the area. In total, while many were in a state of disrepair, approximately 305 petrified instances were recovered and show no further anomalous activity. Due to this, SCP-6573 is pending reclassification to Neutralized.\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=IndustryStandard]]\n[[<]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** pigeon\n> **Name:** Rock Pigeon-Mindaugas Urbonas-2.jpg\n> **Author:** Mindaugas Urbonas\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/deed.en Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.5)]\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rock_Pigeon-Mindaugas_Urbonas-2.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** pigeons\n> **Name:** Dordrecht kunstwerk Sabine Zwikker.jpg\n> **Author:** Wikifrits\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication]\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dordrecht_kunstwerk_Sabine_Zwikker.jpg\n=====\n[[/<]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6572]]] | SCP-6573 | [[[SCP-6574]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
