An artist learns she can control this.\n * //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-978-extended-test-logs#:~:text=Subject%3A%20SCP%2D6109%2D13%20(crucified%20instance) SCP-978 Extended Test Log (6109 Tests)]//: The artist is left broken, and all that remains of Yehoshua are the happy memories.\n * //[[[please g-d dont kill yourself |please G-d don't kill yourself]]]//: With His vessels destroyed, Yehoshua wanders the Earth as a spirit. The atrocities committed against His people discourage Him, and He falls into darkness.\n  * //[[[a shadow over |The Superstar]]]// (18+): Within the darkness, Yehoshua assumes the crown of Heaven and sits amongst His people. A play is performed in His honor.\n\n* **[[[a thorley little christmas |Alex Thorley's Christmas Special]]]:** In the absence of G-d, the great cicada attempts to chew his way into reality in His place. A minor god is released from the cicada's control, and she aids in the war against him.\n * //[[[agne and their deer |Agne Adomaitis & The Deep Dark Forest]]]//: This minor god takes an otherworldly soldier on a strange vision-quest.\n  * //[[[you deserve to be happy |I Am Ira Watts & You Are The Forest]]]//: She now (metaphorically) saves the soul of a young, hopeless man.\n\n* **[[[illcovetyouifyoucoverme |CO█VE█T███]]]:** Within the heart of the Demiurge, Alex Thorley is subjected to unusual horrors. G-d, hiding in the margins of the story itself, seeks to mount an offensive against the Demiurge.\n\n\n* **[[[returns |hauntology-antaka]]]:** G-d returns at the end of the universe, when all has fallen to darkness. But He shows His last follower that this might not be it.\n------\n//The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit// takes place in a heightened reality, a syncretic middle-ground between Tibetan Buddhism and ancient Catholicism through a Jewish perspective. We will mostly follow the story of the young Jew who would become the Messiah, Yehoshua, but we will also see the ways His actions ripple throughout the universe.\n\nBelow is a more in-depth explanation on the characters and their fates.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open for spoilers.\" hide=\"...\"]]\n__Our cast:__\n* **Yehoshua the Christ:** The Christian Messiah, born from a virgin and given mystical powers from birth. Existed in a state of quantum superposition after being cursed by Leah, an artist working with Are We Cool Yet?. However, the Foundation's Tactical Theology Department was able to reset the timeline. As such, He was restored to existing along only one timeline -- unfortunately, this confirms His death. He exists as a spirit on Earth for some time, before committing suicide in Palestine, having witnessed the massacres perpetuated by Israel. In turn, He reanimates as the Hanged King, dead for most of the year before returning, briefly, to life in June.\n\n* **[[[spikebrennan-s-proposal |Muhammad al-Taqi]]]:** Created by my fellow author [[*user spikebrennan]]. Former Director of the Tactical Theology Department. He was sent back in time to confront Yehoshua, inadvertently breaking the curse at the cost of resetting his own life completely. He now lives in a house that is the conceptual embodiment of heartbreak on his own, unaware of the life he once had.\n\n* **Leah:** Mostly unseen. A Jewish artist with Are We Cool Yet?, she appeared to have incredibly potent abilities when it came to manipulating timelines, and used this to mess with her Christian ex-boyfriend, cursing Yehoshua so that all the myths and truths of His life became true simultaneously. Seems to have chilled out after the Foundation undid her magic, and has laid low since.\n\n\n* **The Four Lords of Alagadda:** The Lords of Urine, Marrow, Menstruality and Shit are Yehoshua's right hand men and closest friends. They often put on grand shows in the city's porno theatre, including both sexual acts and acts of extreme violence. Kind-hearted and beloved by their people.\n\n\n* **[[[unreality hub |Alex Thorley, Jennifer Williams, and Jane Goe]]]:** Created by authors [[*user Fishish]], [[*user Deadly Bread]], and [[*user Quicksilvers]], respectively. An individual with some sort of dissociative identity issue, __**everything that occurs in the series is a product of their imagination.**__ Alex Thorley is shy and quaint and quiet, their Jennifer Williams personality is sweet and tender and kind, and their Jane Doe personality is rough and strong and adventurous. Working some stuff out, obviously.\n\n\n* **The Essodeer:** Another manifestation of Alex Thorley, though not something they directly identify with. The Essodeer is a beautiful anthromorphic deer, with a strong gait and even stronger legs. Helpful and very similar in personality to Jennifer Williams.\n\n\n* **[[[SCP-7502 |Audra Cesnavicius]]]:** Created by my fellow author Doctor Jiquan, Cesnavicius is a nonbinary soldier who fell out of a portal to another world. Sees visions of the Essodeer commanding them to dig through the ice and snow for an unclear, but beneficial, purpose.\n\n\n* **[[[holy terrors 1 |Ira Watts]]]:** Created by my fellow author [[*user Raddagher]]. Wonderful and kind man who was left disabled by an attack by an anomaly he worked with. Trains kids in a school program, to put it lightly. Sees visions of the Essodeer commanding him to be happier and less hard on himself.\n\n\n* **[[[SCP-3004 |The Cicada God]]]:** Created by my fellow author [[*user kinchtheknifeblade]]. Mimics the appearance of G-d, but is something much darker and much more vile. Unclear where it comes from or what it might represent. Appears to Alex Thorley (as Jennifer Williams) in the Great Freezing, one of the Buddhist Hells. Destroyed by Alex Thorley (as Jane Doe), casting its influence out of Thorley's psyche. Appears to exist on an opposite cycle of Yehoshua, returning to reality every 33 years at Christmastime.\n\n\n* **[[[So It Was |Researcher Rose Labelle]]]:** Created by my fellow author [[*user Decibelles]]. Lonely woman with an unclear connection to the life force of the universe itself. She is the last living human at the end of the world, and is led to salvation by G-d.\n\n* **The Demiurge:** Unseen. The ruler of physical reality, or Samsara, the Demiurge perpetuates sin through its dark influence. When Christ was sacrificed, He erased the sins of humanity, allowing them to go free, but the Demiurge was able to keep some of the souls and fashioned the world into an even worse place. Since Christ took on so many sins, He too was trapped in the reincarnation cycle. The Demiurge has no power over Alagadda -- the Kingdom of Heaven -- and is angered by this. Upon its death, its illusionary reality began to crumble, leaving only Labelle and a mysterious altar beneath the waves, possibly with the power to reset the universe.\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n__Further reading:__\n\n* **[[[scp-8994 |SCP-8994: Spellsteal]]]** -- An introduction to the world this series takes place in.\n* Everything tagged //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/alagadda alagadda]//, //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/hanged-king hanged-kind]// or //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/kindness kindness]//.\n* **[http://scpcommune.wikidot.com/collections#toc3 Ideoform]** -- Takes place in the same universe, but isn't tied directly to the plotlines in this series.\n* **[http://scpcommune.wikidot.com/infinite-mendacity-endless-fun INFINITE MYSTERY LOVERZ ZONE]** -- [[[scp-2293 |polaricecraps]]] x [[[scp-3999 |James Talloran]]] fanfic.
