As my writing predominately concerns the file you included in your message, I have attached it in my response for ease of reference: \n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number=7529\n|clearance=1\n|container-class=safe\n|secondary-class=\n|secondary-icon=\n|disruption-class=dark\n|risk-class=notice\n]]\n\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=BackCat.jpg|width=100%|align=center|caption=SCP-7529, left.]]\n-----\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7529 was initially confined within a kennel in Site-333's animal containment facility. However, due to Leonora Morales's concerns that the anomaly was distressing the variety of seabirds contained within the small space, as well as accompanying noise complaints from adjacent rooms, Director Bohart determined SCP-7529 should be given free rein of Site-333's upper floor -- provided staff members kept it out of the Director's office. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7529 is the back portion of a --Maine Coon-- --Somali-- --American Wirehair-- cat, consisting of the rear ribcage, hind legs, and tail. The forward end of SCP-7529 terminates in a uniform and indistinct black surface. Visual examination has determined SCP-7529 to be female and properly spayed.\n\nSCP-7529 is generally affectionate towards Site-333 personnel. While the entity displays no difficulty in supporting its present body using only its hind legs, it is notably clumsy and prone to knocking items over, bumping into people and objects, and walking off of or otherwise falling from elevated positions. Attempts to litter train SCP-7529 have thus far been unsuccessful. \n[[/div]]\nAfter reviewing this document and the attached 'samples' you mailed to our Site, I can state with reasonable confidence that 'SCP-7529' is unrelated to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-529 SCP-529]. I understand you were quite insistent upon a connection between these anomalies, so I have outlined my reasoning for this conclusion below:\n\n[[div class=\"generic yellow\"]]\n* DNA testing of the included fecal matter does not correspond to the genetic profile of SCP-529; \n* Due to SCP-529's current age, it has experienced a decline in mobility that does not correspond to your account of this entity; \n* The visual fur patterns on the cat depicted in your photograph do not match those of SCP-529, who possess gray tabby markings;\n* You have not included photographic evidence documenting the reported cross-section.\n[[/div]]\n\nIn fact, you have failed to demonstrate that this is not merely a cropped image of a whole, non-anomalous cat. Given these circumstances, as well as your repeated insistence on there being a 'Cash Prize' for finding the rear portion of SCP-529 -- something which has never been stated nor offered, to the best of my knowledge -- leads me to conclude you have not, in fact, found the rear portion of SCP-529. I believe that this is either some attempt at a prank or an effort to extort payment from the Foundation via issuing a false claim relating to an anomaly. \n\nEither way, this has been a gross misuse of my time and the time of my team. I ask that you do not contact me, or anyone on my staff, regarding this again. \n\nRegards, \n\nZacharias Hanneman\nChair, Department of Zoological Studies, Site-58\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"foundation raisa\"]]\n[[<]]\n**{{TO:}}** Zacharias Hanneman, Chair - Department of Zoological Studies, Site-58. \n\n**{{FROM:}}** Vincent Bohart, Director, Site-333.\n\n**{{SUBJECT:}}** Re:Re:Found the back half -- Reward?\n-----\nZacharias,\n \nNow listen, buddy.

Currently, two components of SCP-(7)529 have been independently contained by the Foundation. However, a reasonable assumption suggests that upwards of 4 SCP-(7)529 components may exist at present. \n\nUpon identification of an SCP-(7)529 component, relevant Foundation facilities are to notify O5 Command, who will ensure SCP-(7)529 remains ununified and contained within disparate, secure facilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-(7)529 denotes a collection of entities resembling either the front or rear portion of a domestic feline, terminating at the midsection, with a distinctive black, uniform surface covering the dividing area. SCP-(7)529 entities are behaviourally similar to non-anomalous equivalents and capable of a normal range of motion despite their physiology. \n\nFor unknown reasons, unifying two SCP-(7)529 entities into a singular form causes a sudden, violent disruption in localized space-time and consensus reality, triggering a KOT-Class Scenario. Associated phenomena include: \n[[div class=\"generic red\"]]\n* Mass die-offs of songbirds and rodents globally, resulting in severe ecological damage;\n* Breakdown of verbal communication through increasingly frequent and unintended annunciations of noises such as 'meow,' 'miau,' 'nya,' etc into spoken language;\n* Fluctuations in gravity causing the spontaneous reorientation of 'falling' objects in relation to an arbitrary central point -- during a late-stage KOT-Class Scenario, this affects objects of greater mass, including celestial bodies, at an increasing frequency;\n* Destabilization of physical matter at a subatomic level, as neutrons and protons oscillate between positions within and exterior to atomic nuclei;\n* Additional, minor phenomena.\n[[/div]]\n\nAdditionally, a KOT-Class Scenario possesses B.A.G. Memetic Characteristics: an antimemetic property prevents recollection of the inciting event -- the unification of SCP-(7)529 -- **B**efore **A**nnihilation **G**enesis [B.A.G.] occurs.\n\nThe Foundation's Deepwell Archives indicate that SCP-(7)529 has triggered 8, previous KOT-Class Scenarios.

Some kind of scam. You know the usual junk mail we get. One of you must have left it here. \n\n**Tony Catalano:** Just give them back here, Vincent. Remember when you said the electric bill missed-payment notice was a scam? \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** You know what, it's been a long day. How about we just put a pin in this whole-cat business? We'll try again later. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** They're about the cats, aren't they?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** No they're not. What cats? Oh, the half-cats? Yeah, this is totally unrelated, but I got some important stuff to do. Back to work, you all. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** You can just admit you're wrong. \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Why would I admit to being wrong about something I'm not wrong about?\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Still got one more addressed to you. \n\n//Tony holds the remaining, folded letter in the air. It appears to be printed on thick, grey paper with a clean wax seal.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Jesus, this paper looks handmade. You can see the literal paper grain. Did they use an actual typewriter to print your name on it? No way someone did the spacing of these letters by hand. Noah, check this out.

You are not the first to fly boldly into forwarned dangers.\n\nHowever, through this refusal to accept one's fate, great deeds are accomplished. Although you do not know, can not know, the extent of the efforts: the labour of mind and body that has been bent in a singular purpose -- put faith in our account that the horror you set in motion has been resolved through significant sacrifice and resolve.\n\nWe could speak of these things and more.

He walks to the table before kneeling to scoop up SCP-7529.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Alright, back to work all of you. I'm not paying you to sit around. I'm going to keep this one in my office for a bit. For uh, further consideration. \n\n**Noah Patel:** What about front-half-cat?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Right, stick it in with the birds for now. \n\n**Leonora Morales:** Vincent! \n\n//Vincent exits the room swiftly with SCP-7529 and proceeds down the hall to his office.// \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** If you don't like it, file a complaint! \n\n//Leonora follows after Vincent, trying to catch up to him.

You can all calm down, everything is fine! \n\n//Vincent opens his office door. As he does so, a clowder of front and rear feline entities, bearing the same anomalous characteristics of SCP-7529 and SCP-529, are revealed within. Several of them appear to be fighting on the carpet, while others sun themselves against the window. A single front portion of a Siamese cat stands on his desk; it pauses coughing up a furball to turn and face Vincent, before returning to hacking up a wad of fur. A small group rushes past Vincent into the hallway, with the rear portion of a hairless Sphynx cat colliding with his leg. Vincent jumps backwards, allowing SCP-7529 to break free of his grasp and begin chasing after the fleeing half-cats.// \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** //[Sighs]// I hate Mondays.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7528]]] | SCP-7529 | [[[SCP-7530]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** BackCat.jpg\n> **Name:** Cat stretching E02 6386 \n> **Author:** Hisashi\n> **License:**  CC BY 2.0\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cat_stretching_E02_6386_(4721982666).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-529-new.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Cat on concrete floor.JPG\n> **Author:** Ionutzmovie, edited by [[*user JackalRelated]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cat_on_concrete_floor.JPG\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
