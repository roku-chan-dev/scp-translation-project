In all cases, persons responsible for supervising the affected broadcasts are incapable of recognizing that anything unusual has taken place, either at the time or after the fact. The inserted material is, in all cases, a single pre-existing commercial music track. The phenomenon is always witnessed by one or more live subjects engaged in the act of remembering the deceased individual, most commonly during funerary rituals.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 6519-1, Investigation:** The SCP-6519 dossier was opened by Dr. Anastasios Mataxas, Chair of Spectrometry and Spectremetry, in 2020 after a chance conversation with Dr. Harold Blank. Dr. Blank had described a potentially supernatural, recurrent event which he himself had experienced, forming the template for all other manifestations since recorded. Dr. Mataxas subsequently encountered scattered references to other postmortem media interference in archival material, but was unable to engage in further research before his retirement. He passed the dossier to his successor, Dr. Polyxeni Mataxas, who collected preliminary witness testimony from Site-43 personnel.\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-bottom:3px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FBE9D6; padding: 12px; text-align: center\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n43NET: Catalogue of SCP-6519 Incidents [SELECTED, UNSORTED]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-bottom:3px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #F2F2C2; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"4\"]]\n__RAISA Notice__: Five (5) items in this 43NET request cross-link existing SCP database articles with their own unique security clearance levels and background context; credentials confirmation will be required to access them.

It might very well be that I'm remembering my mother talking about it later. I was sitting in the back of her van, and we were driving in my great-grandmother's funeral procession. You know, a little convoy following the hearse. Dunno if people do that anymore. Mom had the radio on -- she always had the radio on -- and this song came on straight away. Distant horns, otherworldly, like they were coming across a big black lake at night, and then this gospel rock thing kicks in. The upbeat take on death. One long assurance that the next life is a good one, and someone's gonna head on over there and put in a good word for you ahead of time. When it's your turn to go, there'll be a spot saved for you. Typical Christian boilerplate, but still a damn snappy song, and it never stops feeling... like it knows more than it lets on, like it's in on some cosmic secret, like it's coming from a place other than just some one-hit wonder nobody's ever heard of. It made a big impact on my mom, that's for sure; dunno if she really thought it was her grandma saying goodbye, but I can certainly understand her wanting to see it that way. She never got tired of telling that story. Especially when... okay. My personal religious beliefs //aren't,// you understand, and as far as I know she was the same, but we were agreed that something spooky was going on here because it damn well happened again, years and years later. She was driving to the hospital, alone this time, just after my grandmother -- her mother -- died, radio on as always, and along comes Mr. Greenbaum again to tell her it's alright. She told me about it when she got home, and I believed her. Still do, because... well. Fast forward another decade or so. I was driving home //from// the hospital, the day my mom... yeah. I've had the bottom drop out of my stomach a lot, doing this job, but my heart doesn't usually leap into my throat at the same time. After all the weird shit I've seen, I still wasn't ready to hear those distant horns again, but I was goddamn glad when I did. Once I stopped sobbing, and had time to let it sink in. Takes a lot to make me cry, I'm thoroughly shit at it, and gospel rock is //not// my usual ticket. Nevertheless... I don't know if my mom's still out there somewhere, in some sense, but I'd obviously like to think it's the case. And I'd like to think that she's... happy? So I'm biased. I want this to be real, and that makes me a less than reliable source. But you know what we say in A&R: once is odd, twice is strange, three times is data. As far as I'm concerned, my great-grandmother and my grandmother and my mom all phoned home to let us know they're okay, from wherever it is that they went.\"\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 12px; padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 24px;background-color: #F3F3F3\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n//Dr. Blank is a prime example of what I call 'esoaccumulation', the tendency for individuals encountering anomalous phenomena in their early life to continue to experience them as time progresses.

And this track comes on, almost right away, a sort of weird cloud of guitars and finger-snapping resolving into this halting sing-song, and an awkward harmony, tentative but heartfelt, and I let it play. It resonated, it was... like the music itself was working through something, the way I was working through something, and maybe we could figure out how to do it together. It was imperfect, but maybe that was the point? The perfect is the enemy of the good. And that's just the music; as for the words... well, that was a message.

Vivian[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Director Vivian Lesley Scout, founding Director of Site-43.[[/span]] had finally died, at the sprightly old age of much younger than I am right now, and I couldn't go to the funeral because of [[[SCP-5616|my condition]]].

Just one milestone on two long, long trips. So if there's a reason he saw fit to reach beyond the pale and drop it in my lap again, I can't imagine what it was.

I never returned to England until she was on her deathbed, which I thought had made the maintenance of my cover story simpler; to my surprise, she had largely guessed at the facts of the matter in my absence. There seemed little point in dissimulating, given her condition, so I confirmed them to her in her final moments. Nothing against protocol, you understand. What I told her certainly informed the lyrical intervention which followed, although I will note that there seemed to be details which I did not pass along, suggesting that the dead enjoy a certain expanded clarity or even omniscience which may prove problematic for maintenance of the Veil. In any event: the lyrics to \"The Land of Make-Believe\" are addressed to dwellers in a realm of fantasy who are unwilling to acknowledge that fact about themselves, underscoring the potential for them to nevertheless overcome their personal difficulties to find happiness. This fantasy-land supposedly occupies an unwarranted amount of space -- likely in this context a coded reference to our facility's location beneath indigenous land, one of the details I did not share, and perhaps even the Foundation's ever-growing net around the anomalous world. The concept of organizational secrecy is broached, in nearly direct allusion to the concept of living in the dark so that others might die in the light, and the singer rejects this whole-heartedly. Optimism is expressed that the fantasy-dwellers will nurture hope in their hearts, express it to the universe, and see it flower; they are further exhorted to open their locks and shutters and let the light in, breaking down the boundary between fantasy and reality to create a world where there are no more secrets. Engaging in this process will allow the subject of the song -- myself, presumably -- to ascend. Finally the singer demands that his audience take this message to the wider world, and surrender to universal love; the overall suggestion is, obviously, the end of consensus normalcy. I'm personally unimpressed with the song's utility for this particular allegory; it's too direct a metaphor, which detracts considerably from conceptual ambiguity of the original message.\"\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 12px; padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 24px;background-color: #F3F3F3\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n//Doctor of Communication, everyone.// [Blank, Dr. H.]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 12px; padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 36px;background-color: #F3F3F3\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n//Please don't make contentless comments, Dr. Blank!// [Mataxas, Dr. P.]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 12px; padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 36px;background-color: #F3F3F3\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n//A doctorate __in__ Communication, which is simply termed a PhD (as you well know).// [McInnis, Dr. A.]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-bottom:3px; margin-top: 3px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FBE9D6; padding: 6px;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» » CONFIRM CREDENTIALS: L4+/SCP-6500 « «\" hide=\"CREDENTIALS CONFIRMED\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-bottom:3px; margin-bottom:3px\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; width: 50%; padding: 12px\"]]\n**Subject:** Delfina M.
