Web crawlers have been instated to flag any complaints about SCP-5750, as this may leave evidence of its existence. As of 3/18/19, over 121 complaints have been flagged, all discredited and censored. Regardless of SCP-5750's un-containable properties, plans to protect normalcy have been maintained.\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=gamer|\n    caption=An instance of SCP-5750-2 sold by GoI-1912, also known as \"Thin Mints.\"|\n    align=right\n]]\n**Description:** \nSCP-5750 is the collective designation for multiple words that hold memetic properties when used together in a sentence. This effect causes an individual to seek out and buy products from GoI-1912 (\"Girl Scouts\"). The effect lasts until the subject has spent at least $10 (USD) buying one of their products, or SCP-5750-2. Members of GoI-1912, now designated SCP-5750-1, have been shown to be completely immune to SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances have been shown to have no recollection of the effect or their immunity of SCP-5750. SCP-5750-1 instances tend to be door to door sellers of SCP-5750-2, also known as \"Girl Scout Cookies.\" Juliette Gordon Low, (the founder of GoI-1912,) has been designated PoI-1912. The Foundation has failed to capture PoI-1912, as all attempts close to success have ended in triggering the effect of SCP-5750. Further attempts have been set to low priority.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5750 was discovered on 06/05/19 when Junior Researcher Craig Clark reported that the words may have had anomalous properties. He stated the number of social media posts complaining about GoI-1912's sales tactics had increased. This increase directly correlates with the exponential growth of GoI-1912 since first discovered. Evidence of an anomaly was further backed up by counter-memetic filtering of the posts.\n\n**Notes:** SCP-5750-2 instances sold by SCP-5750-1 have no anomalous properties and are chemically similar to other brands of similarly flavored cookies. SCP-5750 is the only anomaly when it comes to the cookies, as combining the words //(do not repeat)// \"Wanna buy girl scout cookies?\" together in a spoken sentence triggers its effect. SCP-5750-1 instances only appear to target those with spending power high enough to afford their products. \n\n\n\n**Addendum-SCP-5750.1:** On 03/11/2019, Foundation web crawlers picked up a string of tweets from a user going by the handle @ImMonster539. The individual was brought into custody, amnesticized, and returned to his home. The tweets have been removed; however, personnel captured a screenshot before censoring it. The image is attached here:\n[[=]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=veryepic|\n    caption=Removed tweets from an individual complaining about SCP-5750.|\n    align=center\n]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Addendum-SCP-5750.2:** On 03/07/2019, an incident was reported by Site Director Klaid Chandler. A note ended up in the mailbox of Chandler addressed to the Foundation. A transcription is attached below:\n> [[>]]\n> ###86026B|To Snickerdoodles, Chocolate Chips and Piayas.##\n> [[/>]]\n> It has come to the Girl Scout's attention that you are trying to facilitate capture of our leader.\n> \n> We would like to request you to stop.\n> \n> This is for your own good, as Juliette always said: \"**##darkred|Peace until War.##**\"\n> \n> If you continue these attempts, it'll be more than war.\n> \n> @@ @@\n> \n> ##red|Hope you like your cookies!##\n> \n> Signed,\n> \n> ###86026B|Carla Josephine, Chief Communications Executive of the Girl Scouts.##\n> \n> [[size 40%]]~Carla@GirlScouts[[/size]]\nOn top of this Chandler also received an email in which he responded to, both are held below:\n\n> [[>]]\n> ###86026B|From Carla@GirlScouts##\n> ###86026B|Recipient(s) KChandler32@SCiPNet##\n> [[/>]]\n> \n> Hey, friend!\n> \n> Just in-case the previous message gets lost in transit!~\n> \n> \n> \n> Your continued attempts at our leader will not stand.
