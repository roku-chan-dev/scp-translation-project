For many, it has become incredibly challenging to find verifiable, trustworthy information about the attempt, even (or perhaps especially!) considering the technology we now have access to. This article, however, aims to amend that issue. The following is all you need to know about what happened, when and where it happened, and -- most importantly of all -- //why// it happened.\n\nPresident Crenshaw was attacked during his yearly visit to Austin, Texas -- the state where his controversial rise to power began, and which he has regularly visited since to pay his respects to the local community. The attack occurred on the 24th of March at 5:37 PM local time, just as the President was approaching the Texas State Capitol, around which gathered a crowd of his local supporters.\n\nAs the happening was an informal affair, aimed more at upholding local spirits \"following the withdrawal of the occupation by the incompetent Coalition\" than achieving any real political agendas, most extant recordings of the event are those taken directly by the attendees. Out of all of those, one in particular has gained traction following the incident, taken by Void user [[span class=\"vactivity\"]] ⁂danielirvin[[/span]], one of the patrons of the pro-Crenshaw rally.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:void-post\n|profile-pic=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/failed-president-crenshaw-assassination-attempt/Illes_Daniel_profile_photo.jpg\n|username=Daniel Irvin 🇺🇸 \n|handle=danielirvin\n|void-msg=[[span class=\"vactivity\"]]#PresidentCrenshaw[[/span]] [[span class=\"vactivity\"]]#Mar25Attack[[/span]] [[image bitmapa.png style=\"border: 1px solid #cfd9de; border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 18px; margin-bottom: 12px; width: 100%;\"]] @@ @@\n|echoes=24\n|echoes=1,083\n|hums=31,471\n|time-and-date=9:02 PM · Mar 25, 2050\n]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe video -- backed by several independent witnesses to the event -- clearly showcases the moment of the tragedy, and remains the clearest record of the attack, in spite of its haphazardous nature. It evidently points to a singular offender being responsible.\n\nAs the federal Cabinet has since revealed, the attacker was 27-year-old Jacob Wilson, a human (and not, as some sources have claimed, half-Fae) male from Austin itself. Wilson performed his attack utilizing an improvised homemade thaumo-explosive device -- an asset he himself has created, in spite of his own lack of thaumaturgic talent and his personal beliefs, and which he has clandestinely planted and activated before the Terry's Texas Rangers Monument.\n\nThe explosion occurred just as the President was about to begin his speech. Though the device was mounted right behind him, due to its malfunction -- spawned by Wilson's lack of occult knowledge -- Crenshaw retained enough time to be alerted by one of the attending agents of the Secret Service, who then lept towards the explosive right as it activated, taking most of its impact onto himself, allowing the remaining agents to minimize the harm done to the President.\n\nStill, in spite of the Secret Service's actions, in the end, over 6 people have perished in the attack, with 17 more becoming severely wounded. Out of those 6, 3 were civilians attending the rally. From the 42 wounded, only 4 people were members of the official delegation, chief among which was President Crenshaw himself.\n\nThe President sustained heavy damage to his left arm and leg, doctors say, suffering a heavy concussion and further damage to his ribcage, chest, and back areas. In spite of his critical condition, Crenshaw remained lucid for long enough for medical aid to arrive. There have been numerous reports that despite his condition, the President allegedly rejected an offer for transportation to the Aeonian Health-operated [[[vnp-8002|Vanguard Research and Medical Site-12]]] -- a center suited to rapidly treating life-threatening injuries -- and opted for another local hospital, the location of which was not yet disclosed to the press. These reports have been neither confirmed nor denied by the White House.\n\nFollowing over 48 hours of surgery, the President's condition has stabilized itself, reports the White House Press Secretary. Although the exact health state of the president remains unknown, experts (all of whom have requested to remain anonymous) believe that he will survive and probably continue performing his presidential duties. In spite of this, due to the extent of the damage, it is highly unlikely that he will ever use his injured limbs again; not unless significant paratechnological augmentations are applied.\n\nThe President is expected to take 2 months to recover until he can re-assume his position and responsibilities from Vice President Charlie Kirk, currently performing in his stead as Crenshaw takes time to recuperate, as per the 25th Ammendement.\n\nIn the meantime, the site of the attack has been cordoned off and secured by dispatched Unusual Incidents Unit personnel, who promptly recovered the remains of the thaumo-explosive device and isolated the accidentally created orphic contamination.\n\n-----\n\nThat is how the situation stands, given all of the information currently available to the press and not withheld for the duration of the President's recovery by the Secret Service due to opsec concerns. The \"what,\" \"who,\" \"where,\" and \"when\" of the whole incident are clear enough -- but what about the \"why?\"\n\nAlthough the White House did not disclose specific details, its representatives confirmed that, when Wilson began to flee following the explosion -- the activator device still in his hand -- he was swiftly identified and terminated by the remaining members of the Secret Service. Though the action was later criticized as too abrupt and without immediately apparent cause by the President's political rivals, post-mortem occult analysis conducted by the UIU has shown a clear thaumic link between Wilson and the explosive, proving without any doubt it was his own personal doing. It has also been confirmed that Wilson's home was raided by the Mobile Occult Operations Team and that his personal belongings were seized; their contents were not yet however released to the media.\n\nBut the investigative trail into Wilson's mind does not end here, with the official version (or rather lack thereof) provided by the government. His online -- and real life -- activism and history paint us a rather clear picture of who he was, and why he has dared to do what he has done.\n\nJacob Wilson, just as both of his parents (both of whom have since perished due to health-related complications in the last decade), was a registered Republican (unlike some sources have claimed, the family has always been red-blooded, and has no history of ever supporting the Democrats). He openly supported President Crenshaw's campaign all the way back in 2044 when the President tried for a first term, continuing to spread pro-Crenshaw messages across all of his social media accounts during his attempted (and eventually successful) re-election in 2048. \n\nWilson took a particular interest in the Thaumic Security Act which the President had promised during his electoral speeches, fervently supporting strong state-overseen interventions in thaumically-talented neighborhoods in the country. During the Washington Virion pandemic itself, he was noted as a protester against the quarantine and the Coalition intervention, supporting \"the government's efforts to set the America straight and allow true independence.\"\n\nThis -- paired with a record of borderline bigoted behavior in the past, alongside his potential prior connections to local [[[armed-with-hell-flames-and-fury|Chaos Insurgency]]] cells -- has eventually landed Wilson before court, where he was trialed for violating several quarantine procedures as well as for calling for treason and discrimination against minorities. Though he was cleared of most charges, he was nevertheless fined a $10,000 fine for his disregard for the quarantine.\n\nFollowing this incident, his social media posting pattern has changed. He no longer believed that the fight against the virion was spawned merely by the federal government adhering to the \"neomarxist, nuclear war-threatening\" Coalition, but rather was an intentional act on behalf of the government, which he claimed has betrayed its own principles and American people. His support for Crenshaw -- which, before, had been unwavering -- noticeably began to fade, and was soon replaced by a belief that Crenshaw himself was sabotaging a campaign Wilson believed \"should have been carried through to the end,\" and which he thought would be better handled under a different President, often citing the now-AWOL Secretary of State Thomas Graham as a far more suitable replacement.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Wilson's social media accounts saw a rapid rise in his radicalization. Whereas before, Wilson was more of a self-described \"thaumic-skeptic\" than an open bigot, following the trial, he began to engage in behavior which eventually got most of his accounts deleted and banned for flagrant discrimination. His behavior culminated with his last post before his Void account was also flagged and suspended, in which he complained about the President's incoming visit to Austin, which he viewed as an \"insult to those who still care about our cause.\"\n\nThough the Unusual Incidents Unit was approached by members of the press, who attempted to inquire whether or not Wilson was flagged by them as a potentially dangerous individual prior to the incident, so far, the organization has declined to comment.\n\n-----\n\nBut what does any of this actually mean?\n\nOf course, (attempts at) political assassinations are no new thing of our current zeitgeist -- if anything, they are as old as America itself. Radicals of all different flavors have always existed, moreso those close in heart to politics. But would it be fair to say that this vile incident indicates nothing of significance? That we are just to accept it as merely an unfortunate feature of democracy, and not the appalling attack it truly is?\n\nIt is no secret that the American public has always been more or less polarized and divided between the only two options its bipartisan system permits. It is also no secret that this division has only grown larger in the wake of the recent Washington Virion pandemic and the Global Occult Coalition occupation that followed. Both of these events seemed to have, more than anything, only made the issue worse, giving rise to a whole new group of radicals (as seen by Wilson's example): desperate middle class men, falling into political paranoia, and [[[under-pressure|various far leftists rising from previously more-moderate groups of older citizens]]]. Unlike the radicals of yesterday, however, this new lot seems far more populous -- and far more prone to taking action.\n\nData released by the federal government shows us that in the last decade, the amount of political and hate crimes has grown by a staggering 38% when compared to those committed in the middle-to-late 2030s. Whereas following the immediate [[[hour-zero|collapse of the Veil back in 2021]]], the world seemed to have cooled off following the initial shock and chaos for over 15 years, providing America with a relatively peaceful political situation for years to come, recent data shows us that the worrying trend of acting upon the radicalism spreading throughout society is once again on the rise.\n\nWhat's even more worrying, however, is the fact that for all of the radicalism, American politics seems to remain in a standstill -- the same standstill that has plagued it for decades. Even in spite of the great change which has occurred worldwide following the occult world becoming revealed, America's policies -- both domestic and foreign -- have not undergone fundamental changes, despite some progress in the past decades.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 1px #799dce;padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px; border-left: 6px rgb(var(--medium-accent)) solid; margin: auto; max-width: 600px; text-align: left;\"]]\n\n++ ##3d8b2c|[[span class=\"dot\"]]●[[/span]] LIVE:## Nationwide opinion polling, 27/03/2050\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"bar dem\"]]  \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bar rep\"]]  \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bar non\"]]  \n[[/div]] \n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nThough with many big business players backing the Democrats after the pandemic, a blue victory seems inevitable in the next term, the Dems' most likely candidate, Robert Tem (the former Vice President under President Harvey Connors), has shown little interest in walking away from the Crenshaw-initiated Thaumic Security Act. Tem aims to uphold the \"moderate government of open dialogue\" of the Connors Administration and is even interested in pursuing further thaumic security measures (though, as he claims, he will be more focused on a humanitarian approach to the situation). He also said that he intends to \"tighten cooperation with international partners, the lack of which has been one of the key flaws of the Crenshaw administration\" -- referring to the deepening the USA's relationship with the Global Occult Coalition, with which they seek to make amends through a \"rehabilitated\" PENTAGRAM following General Bowe's removal from power.\n\nThis was met with criticism from a significant portion of the Democrat party, begging an observation: official proposals put forward by the Democrats are not at all different from what President Crenshaw has done. Both will, inevitably, have the same consequences. The only distinction between these approaches is that one of them -- at least publicly -- tries to appear more liberally inclined than the other. At least in theory, in any case.\n\nIndeed, America once again seems to come back to the cycle it has always been stuck in due to its political circumstances; one that, today, is more ripe for violence and vehemence than ever before. As the story of Jacob Wilson shows us, no matter where one goes, there is unease in politics, a vague promise of turmoil. Of something big approaching, with everyone more eager to take matters into their own hands than ever before.\n\n...Of course, all of this is merely speculation, spawned from the combination of this author's personal opinions and the analysis carried out by other geopolitical experts. Will any of these claims ever actually come to pass? //Are// we living in the preludium of the next great change, or is that merely paranoia? When will our Reichstag fire happen? Or perhaps has it already occurred?\n\nWell. It seems that, just like with everything else, only time will tell.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 1.3em]]**See Also**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[module css]]\n.end1 {\n    float: left;\n    width: 45%;\n}\n\n.end2 {\n    float: right;\n    width: 45%;\n}\n\n@media only screen and (max-width: 550px) {\n    .end1 {\n        float: none;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n    .end2 {\n        float: none;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"end1\"]]\n[[size 1.2em]]**[# Politics]**[[/size]]\n* [[[scp-4485|\"Dadaistischen Zentralrat Der Welt-HANSARP\" Wins Elections to Berlin Parliament With 104,9% of Votes]]]\n* [# Experts Say Thomas Graham Might Be Hiding in Panama]\n* [# China Announces Next Steps of Transition from \"Degenerated People's Democracy\" to \"Pure Dictatorship of the Developed Working Class\"]\n\n[[size 1.2em]]**[# Science & Technology]**[[/size]]\n* [# JAGPATO to Continue Its Investigation Into JOICL Business Practices]\n* [# The Post-Containment Syndrome, and Why Vanguard Can't Just Make a Miracle Drug to Cure It]\n* [[[excerpts-from-the-galileo-deep-space-observatory|Galileo to Act as Research Hub for Development of Further Mars Colonies]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"end2\"]]\n[[size 1.2em]]**[# Economy]**[[/size]]\n* [# Ancient Order of Hole Wardens Warns Darke Mining Group Ltd.
