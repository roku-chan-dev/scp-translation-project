Personnel entering the containment area should wear Level 1 biohazard suits to avoid being bitten by SCP-456, and the suits must be treated with insecticide upon leaving the enclosure.  When not being used in experiments, SCP-456 must be fed 70 ml of human or animal blood per 100 insects, weekly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-456 is a variety of the common bedbug (//Cimex lectularius//).  In addition to an anticoagulant, SCP-456 injects [DATA EXPUNGED] when biting its host, causing the brain to produce adenosine, endorphins, and a narcotic identified as an analogue of fentanyl.  As a result, victims of SCP-456 infestations experience increasing euphoria and somnolence as the number of insects increases, eventually sleeping 24 hours/day.\n\nSCP-456 was identified after a number of individuals were found dead in their homes, suffering from varying degrees of malnutrition, blood loss, and narcotics toxicity.  SCP-456 continues to be a problem in the wild.  To reduce the number of infestations, the CDC has issued a false report that bedbugs carry malaria and must be exterminated when found.\n\n**Addendum:** Four D-Class were requisitioned for exposure to SCP-456, to determine long-term effects.\n\n**Experiment 456-1:** D-17514 exposed to SCP-456 and fed standard rations, but given no other special treatment.  After 17 days of exposure, D-17514 slept constantly and was unable to care for himself.  Subject expired from malnutrition █ days later.\n\n**Experiment 456-2:** D-17515 exposed to SCP-456 and fed intravenously when unable to care for herself.  Subject expired from blood loss after ██ days.\n\n**Experiment 456-3:** D-17516 exposed to SCP-456, fed intravenously, and given periodic blood transfusions as needed.  Subject expired from narcotic overdose after ██ days.\n\n**Experiment 456-4:** D-17517 exposed to SCP-456, fed intravenously, and given periodic blood transfusions in addition to small doses of a narcotic antagonist.  Subject survived for ███ days, and was supporting a colony of ██████ insects at conclusion of experiment.  D-17517 remanded for amnestic treatment and reassignment on █/██/20██.\n\n**Addendum:** [[[task-forces#iota-10|Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\")]]] is investigating a report that a drug cartel located in ██████████, Mexico, is kidnapping members of the public, breeding SCP-456, and extracting the narcotics produced by the victims under the cover of DEA operatives. Anyone found to be using SCP-456 in this manner is to be terminated.\n________________________________________\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-455]]] | SCP-456 | [[[SCP-457]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=eric_h]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Datoteka:Bed bug, Cimex lectularius.jpg\n> **Name:** bug.jpg\n> **Author:** Piotr Naskrecki\n> **License:** Public Domain \n> **Source Link:** https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datoteka:Bed_bug,_Cimex_lectularius.jpg\n\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
