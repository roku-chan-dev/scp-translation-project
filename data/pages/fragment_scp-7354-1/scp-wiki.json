SCP-7354-A instances are invariably aggressive, physically resilient, and dangerous. Most manifestation events on record have resulted in structural damage to Area-354 and/or casualties among personnel.\n\nAs of 2007, the average length of time between SCP-7354-A manifestations has been decreasing.\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ **ADDENDUM 7354-1**\n+++ **RECORDED MANIFESTATION EVENTS**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Instance:** SCP-7354-A-1\n\n**Date:** 01/18/2009\n\n**Description:** Large chiropteran entity with a wingspan of 4.1 meters.
