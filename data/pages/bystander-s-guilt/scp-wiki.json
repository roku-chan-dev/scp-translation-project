I didn't realize that it was happening already.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site l\"]]\nNot yet. They just stuck our asses in our dorms and locked us in.\nFor 'our safety'\nI don't care about our safety. I just can't handle this, Jay, what am I supposed to do?\nHow the fuck do we do anything?\nAre we just\nsupposed\nto wait?\nDo we just pretend? Say 'Oh boy!

She's told me about the other branches, the...\nThe failed timelines. The **BAD** ones.\nI just... fuck Jay, what the fuck do I do?\nI am just fucking sitting here, in OUR dorm, staring at the life we've built together, but FUCK\nWhat if it's all gone? What if it's **not** okay?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site r\"]]\nHeather, they always figure it out.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site l\"]]\nSure, but what if the solution is bad?\nWhat if Lillian doesn't make it out this time? What if she has to stay behind to close the breach forever?\nWhat if she turns into a fucking spider Jay?\nI can't date a spider\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site r\"]]\nDo you really think she would turn into a spider?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site l\"]]\nI don't know what to think\nOne sec, brb\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n//6:10.

Tick. Tick.\n\nTick. Tick.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:21. What if I never hear her voice again?//\n\nTick.\n\nThe room full of their things, in their place, in their life they hade built together -- it all felt numb to Heather.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:22. What the fuck is going to happen to me? To us?//\n\nTick.\n\nThe ground beneath her feet felt hollow. //It is,// she belatedly thought.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:23. It'll work out. It has to.//\n\nTick.\n\nDoubt always sets in. It //has// gone wrong before.\n\nTick. \n\n//6:24. Please.//\n\nTick.\n\nThe room still smelled like her.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:25. It happens every year? Is this... Is this my life now?//\n\nTick. \n\nThe weight was oppressive.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:26.//\n\nTick.\n\nHeather's chest tightened as she held her breath.\n\nTick.\n\nTime slowed down as Heather felt every pump of her heart. When the world is still and every sound a hint to the truth, everything just takes a little bit //longer//.\n\nTick.\n\n//It's still 6:26.//\n\nHeather's memories flashed in her mind -- the ones she had made with Lillian, with her friends. With the family she has found.\n\nTick.\n\nThe only ones she had left. Her... Her entire life.\n\nTick.\n\n//6:27.//\n\nTick.\n\n//What happened?//\n\nTick.\n\n[[div class=\"danke site r\"]]\nI just heard from Ilse, she said it sounded like it went smoothly.\nHave you heard from Lillian yet?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site l\"]]\nNo. Not yet.\n[[/div]]\n\nTick.\n\nThe waiting wasn't done.\n\nTick.\n\nHeather would be waiting for longer, wouldn't she?\n\nTick.\n\nTick.\n\nTick.\n\nShe just hoped Lillian was okay.\n\n-----\n\n30 excruciating minutes later, the door to their habitation swung open, and Lillian lazily waltzed through their door.\n\n\"Heath? I'm home, are you ready for dinner?\"\n\nHeather barely gave her a second before launching herself at her girlfriend, pulling Lillian tight, sobbing into her chest.\n\n\"Thank god you're not a spider.\" Heather said through tears and sniffles. \"Didn't you see my messages?\"\n\nShe could feel Lillian's heart beat in perfectly imperfect syncopation, knowing that she was still here.\n\n\"What? Babe, I left my phone here. I told you.\"\n\nHeather blinked twice, before slowly exhaling from her nose, fighting back the tears.\n\n\"Oh. Right.\"\n\n\"What's wrong? Did something happen while I was-- oh my god, it was your first breach.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Fuck, you must have been so worried. Heather, I'm sorry. I forgot. I'm just... I'm used to it by now, you know? I just push a button.\"\n\n\"How did that go?\"\n\n\"How did what go?\"\n\n\"Pressing the button.\"\n\n\"Babe, I pressed that button so fucking well.\"\n\nTick.\n\nAnother year gone.\n\nTick. \n\nIt was over now.\n\nTick.\n\nAnd yet, Heather was still waiting.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ [[[Forgotten Memories Hub]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
