Every containment facility is to have at least one untested containment plan for SCP-5582 prepared at all times. Until permanent containment is deemed successful, the continued recapture of SCP-5582 under new conditions is intended to serve as a substitute for real containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5582 is a three-year-old common octopus[[footnote]]//Octopus Vulgaris//[[/footnote]], capable of surviving an indefinite amount of time without water. SCP-5582 is sapient and has advanced problem-solving skills. SCP-5582 could not be subjected to any test in this regard, due to its constant containment breaches, but to date, SCP-5582 was able to solve any logical problem encountered.\n\n**Discovery:** The Foundation became aware of SCP-5582 through multiple reports of a bank heist involving an octopus. Agents were dispatched to the scene and found SCP-5582 lurking in the immediate vicinity. SCP-5582 was apprehended and brought to Site-17 but was able to crawl out of the containment vehicle before its arrival due to the lack of octopus-specific restraints.\n\nSCP-5582 was again found a few weeks later observing Site-17. When Agents were again dispatched to apprehend SCP-5582, they were unable to find it. It is estimated that SCP-5582 infiltrated Site-17 prior to being noticed.\n\n**Interview-Log:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5582\n\n**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Mellow\n\n**Foreword:** //This interview was conducted after SCP-5582 showed up at the front entrance of Site-23. SCP-5582 used the stones of its provisional containment aquarium to write its answers.//\n\n**<Begin Log, skip to 05:34>**\n\n//Up to this point SCP-5582 had only been placing its stones at random.//\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** I don't see why you even requested an interview if you refuse to answer.\n\n**SCP-5582:** [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\" ]]Took you long enough to notice. Don't worry, I was listening.[[/span]] //(SCP-5582 looks directly at Junior Researcher Mellow)// [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\" ]]Yeah, you’ll do it.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** Me?\n\n**SCP-5582:** [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]What? No. You young people are always so self-centred. I mean all of you, obviously.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** And what exactly is it you want from us?\n\n**SCP-5582:** [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]You'll get it eventually.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** Then will you answer why you took part in the heist?\n\n**SCP-5582:** [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]Why does anyone rob a bank? For myself, obviously.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** Then why did you willingly let yourself be contained?\n\n**SCP-5582:** [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]Also for me.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** You're not making any sense.\n\n**SCP-5582:**  [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]You’ll understand it when you’re a little older.[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** I really don't think so? What do you get from letting yourself be contained?\n\n**SCP-5582:**  [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]No[[/span]]\n\n**Junior Researcher Mellow:** No?\n\n**SCP-5582:** //(it tips its head with one of its arms)//  [[span style=\"font-family:monospace; font-size: 10pt\"]]No stagnation.[[/span]]\n\n//SCP-5582 refused to communicate any further.//\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** //SCP-5582 breached containment shortly after the interview concluded. It was discovered that stones were disrupting the function of its cell door locking mechanism.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n3 days after this breach, Junior Researcher Mellow received an anonymous message titled \"Before you do it\" containing a picture of SCP-5582.\n\n**Further notable incidents:**\n* SCP-5582 was contained in Site-11 in a standard containment cell with a more complex locking mechanism. SCP-5582 was able to escape through the ventilation system with the help of a previously half-swallowed screwdriver.\n* Site-66 constructed a special cell for SCP-5582, that made an escape through life-supporting systems like ventilation and drainage impossible. SCP-5582 escaped through bribing a now-former junior researcher with its stolen money to aid in its containment breach.\n* SCP-5582 was captured by Site-06-3 from a local aquarium. Containment was planned to include several logic puzzles, but the octopus was found to be non-anomalous. On the same day, Site-06-3 Staff received an anonymous message titled \"Already solved\" containing the solutions to all logic puzzles.\n* During its stay at Site-19, SCP-5582 was informed of the existence of other sapient cephalopods in containment. SCP-5582 agreed to a meeting but fled during [[[the siege of Site-19]]]. The following message was received afterwards:\n> What, you want me to socialize at this age? Weird thing to ask a three-year-old. Still tempting, but I wished you’d have asked me when I wasn’t crawling on my last arm.\nThe next day, SCP-5582 was spotted in front of the containment tank of [[[SCP-2967]]][[footnote]] One of the cephalopods alluded to during the previous containment attempt.[[/footnote]] by surveillance cameras. They both communicated through an unknown sign language for about an hour after which SCP-5582 escaped before the footage was noticed. The following message was received afterwards:\n> Nah, I’m good.\n\n----\n\nAll further encounters with SCP-5582 are documented in the [[[SCP-5582 Containment Log]]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5581]]] | SCP-5582 | [[[SCP-5583]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
