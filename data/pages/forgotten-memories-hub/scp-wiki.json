Forgotten Memories explores stories about love, loss, intimacy, and not fitting in -- and despite all of that, the people who try to make the world a better place, even just for a moment.\n\nIt delves into the world of 'The Margins', a conceptual space between the Noosphere and Reality -- a place outside of existence, where only abstract concepts and lost souls dwell. The Margins leak and bleed through into our world all the time; and sometimes, what comes through just might end the world. Forgotten Memories spans scales, including stories of massive ramifications, and minor ones, focused on the minutiae of the lives of the people who are just struggling to make it through the day.\n\nForgotten Memories is split into two sections: the main flagship book, and other assorted works. \n\nThe main Forgotten Memories storyline begins with Book 1: 'Absence'. This is a story about Heather Garrison, a new transfer to Site-43, Lillian Lillihammer, the M&C Section chair at Site-43, and their misadventures together against the lurking shadow of 'absence'. Forgotten Memories is a romantic Foundation epic that will leave the two women forever changed. As of Feb 2025, the first book is now complete!\n\nOutside of the main storyline, however, this canon is fully open for contribution, and you have the freedom to take it in any direction you would like! Any work that is focused on the themes mentioned above, that focuses onto the human aspect of the struggle are welcome.

Transgender, lesbian and loudly sardonic, Heather Garrison is a Foundation Researcher specializing in ontological memetics -- the study of memetics as they relate to larger concepts. Impulsive, flirty, and driven, Heather has fought hard to get recognition in the Foundation.

Their expert communication skills often help pull the Foundation out of trouble, and even more often, help their troubled partner.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"bubble\"]]\n+++ Hana Thompson \n//\"I need to make sure that this— that **you** are real.\"//\n-----\nSCP-6317, Noble Knight, Memetic Mess. Hana met Heather by chance in Site-19 where they bonded over a nighttime swim. Now the two talk mainly about normalcy, their memories (or lack thereof), and girl trouble. \n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Setting]]\n+++ Forgotten Memories Canon:\n------\n[[<]]\nForgotten Memories is a canon that is designed to be compatible with other canons, while still having distinct elements that are 'Forgotten Memories', so to speak. In that way, many of the works are set in a splinter-canon of On Guard 43 -- in the context of OG43, Forgotten Memories is a parallel branch, independent of the mainline, and distinct from the Words of Power and Poison series. There are a number of differences from OG43, namely:\n* Resurrection is **not** considered canon for this splinter\n* Site-43 is even more culturally isolated from the Foundation than in mainline OG43\n\nBeyond that Forgotten Memories, at its core, is about ideas. Not just an idea that means something; in Forgotten Memories, ideas can change the very reality of what something is, though association, ontological overlap or otherwise. Ideas are individual things, and memories are how we contextualize them. In Forgotten Memories, ideas can be twisted, manipulated, broken, obliterated and even brought back or forcibly created.\n\nForgotten Memories also explores ideas of applied anomalous ontology, as explained in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-ontology-orientation|An Orientation on Anomalous Ontology]]]. If you write a story about anomalous ontology, it is more than welcome to be part of this canon!\n\nWhen we are talking about ideas, there are three main places an idea can exist: in the human mind, in the Noosphere, or in The Margins.\n\nThe Noosphere has a major role in Forgotten Memories, and is defined as this:\n> The Noosphere is the dimension of all concepts or ideas that are known by humanity, or //could// be known. The Noosphere is **not** the sum of all human consciousness in Forgotten Memories, rather, it is the sum of all present and //potential// concepts that can be conceived of by the human mind. Less like a social media feed, and more like an encyclopedia.\n\nHowever, the sum of all human consciousness, or all active thoughts that are being thought at the moment, is referred to as the 'Active Noosphere'.\n\nThe Human Mind is a bit stickier. Referred to often as an individual's \"Noospheric Field\", this is a mindscape, a mental zone, or in other words, every memory that you have. A noospheric field contains an **anchor**, **memories**, and **contextual connections**.\n\nAn **anchor** is something that typically takes the form of an object that is important to the person, that appears in their noospheric field. This anchor has a direct connection to the Noosphere, visually represented as a string, rope, chain or other line. This anchor is what allows people to think of new ideas -- it also flows both ways, with the Noosphere being able to 'rediscover' concepts through the minds of humanity.\n\nInside of the human mind, **memories** and their **connections** are major. The human mind does not store 'ideas' or 'concepts', rather it stores relations between ideas. We have our memories, which can be thought of as balls, baubles, spheres; those memories are forgotten if they are not connected to others, or to your anchor. Therefore, the human mind develops **contextual connections** -- in the same way thinking of white can make you think of rice, memories are structured and branch out, with your oldest memories first, closest to the top of your noospheric field, an interconnecting web of context and relative meanings. This does mean that, if connections are destroyed, via amnestics or otherwise, you will lose those memories, and they will fade away, disconnected from your 'mind' and the noosphere. If somebody forgets a memory, that memory is gone //forever//.\n\nThen we get to the most important aspect in Forgotten Memories: **The Margins**. Simply put, The Margins are the space outside of our dimension, and outside of the noosphere itself; it is the place where ideas that do not, or cannot exist, well, exist. Like the Margins of a page, it collects all of the spillover from the Noosphere, the ideas that are //truly// lost, obliterated, conceptually killed. This is the home of pattern screamers, of ideas that cannot and should not exist, beings that are not.\n\nThe Margins are not connected to the Noosphere. The Margins **should not** be connected to the Noosphere. But it is possible, and happened with //absence//.\n\nThe Margins and how ideas can interact and redefine themselves are at the heart of Forgotten Memories. This canon is about stories of things that were lost, of impossible ideas, of conceptual chaos, of the people who live on the edge of the world, daring to explore, whether they know what they're doing or not.\n\nSo come on in. Get a feel for it. Play around with ideas -- a canon is a collaborative thing, and all are welcome. I can't wait to see what spin you put on things!\n[[/<]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab How to Contribute]]\nSo you want to write a story in the setting or using the characters?
