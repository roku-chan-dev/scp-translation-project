I'm [[*user SynthPanda_]]. I'm a writer and artist hoping to use the wiki as a way to improve my craft. If you have a draft with, unsettling empty settings, speculative biology, animals in general, existential dread, or a more Science-Fantasy tinge, feel free to contact me for crit!\n\nHere's the stuff I've written that's worth reading:\n\n[[[Three Steps From Heaven]]] - A poem set in the Lampeter canon prior to the Foundation's involvement. Also a poem about being in a long distance relationship.\n\n[[[Shattered Love]]] - Written by myself and [[*User Prismal]] for pridecon. Will make you cry, possibly. \n\n[[[SCP-8993]]] ⁠— Embody - My extremely flawed article for 8kcon. Some people would be upset with me if i deleted it or rewrote it.\n\n[[[SCP-6361]]] ⁠— Meat the Director: The Disney Golden Age as Imagined by a Psychotic Meat Witch - Written with [[*User Prismal]] for lorecon. \n\n[[[In a New Light]]] - Written with [[*User Jack Waltz]]. Very fond memories of this one.\n\n[[[SCP-5863]]] ⁠— Myths Made Plain - I've wrote unreality before and I'll write it again.\n\n[[[A Bio-Scanner, Alone on A Dead World]]] - Certainly have improved a lot since then, but I like this one a lot.\n\nHere's the stuff I've made that's worth looking at:\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:donald-trump-and-19-others-indicted-in-georgia-on-charge Donald Trump and 19 Others Indicted in Georgia on Charges Related to the Illegal Attempt to Overturn the 2020 Election] - My magnum opus.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:the-elephant-is-not-a-metaphor The Elephant Is Not A Metaphor]\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-exchange-2023-for-salinesnotsalt SCP-1831 Fanart] - For Art Exchange 2023. Had a lot of fun making this.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:ae-2022-synthpanda Ryoto Hishakaku, Overseer of RAIDFRAME VIII] - For Art Exchange 2022.\n\nMega Collabs I've participated in:\n\n[[[Agent, Father, Motherfucker: Alto Clef, in memoriam]]]\n\n[[[One More Tomorrow]]]\n\n[[[Excerpts of Particular Interest From the Galileo Deep-Space Observatory Archives]]]\n\n----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:clock-tower]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:scp-trans-pride |trans-pride-logo= --] |trans-pride-footer= --]]]\n[[module CSS]]\n:root {\n  --header-title: \"SynthPanda_’s Author Page\";\n  --header-subtitle: \"CSS is fuck.
