In the interest of maintaining a positive psychological profile, a minimal number of Foundation staff are to be present during routine interactions. Personnel who have not been designated for this role are not to enter the containment chamber of SCP-6414, except in emergency situations.\n\nSCP-6414 is permitted access to kitchenware and foodstuffs in its containment chamber, at the discretion of Research Head Dr. Chmielewska and/or the Containment Technicians on duty. All recovered portions of SCP-6414-1 are to be preserved and placed in refrigerated storage; portions of SCP-6414-1 which are deemed no longer viable (left refrigerated for more than 2-3 days) shall be disposed of appropriately.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=4\n|speed=100\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=280px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Ajchmielewska-and-boogeyman23/Charlie_2\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-6414\n]]\n\n+++++* Description:\nSCP-6414 is a female mustelid closely related to both the European polecat (//Mustela putorius//) and domesticated ferret (//Mustela putorius furo//). SCP-6414 has demonstrated sapience and the ability to speak, which it does with a pronounced Scouse [[footnote]]An accent and dialect of English associated with Liverpool.[[/footnote]] English accent. SCP-6414 identifies itself with the name \"Charlie\" and has cooperated amicably with Foundation staff during the course of its containment.\n\nOf particular note is SCP-6414's ability and penchant for cooking and serving food. Any food items which have been prepared by SCP-6414 are given the designation SCP-6414-1. Most commonly, instances of SCP-6414-1 have been broth-based recipes (such as soups or stews). SCP-6414 claims familiarity with baking techniques as well; permissions to resources to pursue such research are pending.\n\nThere is (presently unsubstantiated) speculation that SCP-6414-1 has therapeutic properties, particularly against ailments of the digestive system. --Despite anecdotal evidence, deliberate testing to this end has provided variable results without enough consistency to form a conclusion.-- (See Incident Log 6414-A)\n\n\n----\n\n\n[[div_ class=\"no-addendum\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview Log 6414-1A\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=same-color\n|unique-name=unique-name-1\n|display-name=Interview Log 6414-1a\n]]\n> **Interview Subject:** SCP-6414\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher, Doctor Richard Clarkson\n> \n> **Foreword:** The first of SCP-6414's daily interview sessions with Site-293 personnel.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** This is Junior Researcher Doctor Richard Clarkson speaking, conducting an initial research interview with SCP-6414. I ask that you answer the following questions to the best of your ability.\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** I do not intend on jarggin'[[footnote]]To mess with/ruin.[[/footnote]]  your research, Mr. Clarkson.\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** Ok. What can you tell me about your origins or your earliest memories?\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** I believe I was born just like any other ferret was, abar nine years ago in Northern Africa. Then I was taken from me home not long after and brought to a quaint, well in town called \"Liverpool\". Was a cheery little place 'til your men in black suits went and took me afar from me home. Oh dear, mother must be worried sick.\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** How long do you recall having these anomalous properties?\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** If youse referrin' to me talkin', I ha' been speakin' for as long as I can remember. I believe I was born with it. English ain't my first language. I began speakin' in Arabic before I learned English. And then I caught the Scouse accent from growin' up in Liverpool. But if youse referrin' to the cookin', well, theres so much you can be learnin' from those around ya that raised ya. You wouldn't happen to be keepin' me mother away from me, are ya?\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** I can not disclose that information.\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Well I do be hopin' youse let me see her soon. She was deathly ill when your snide men took me away in that foul cat cage.\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** The well-being of the civilian who sheltered you is no concern to the Foundation.\n> \n> //SCP-6414 arches its spine in a defensive position before relaxing. 2 minutes pass before SCP-6414 speaks again.//\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Ol' Evie used to watch cookin' programs on the telly all the time... I picked up on the lessons after a while. Oh, she was proper skint, but sound nonetheless. She'd only ever spend her pounds on a bevvie or two, but started buyin' some scran when I showed off an interest in cookin'. She cared for me like no other did! She was like me ma' to me...\n> \n> //There is a moment of silence.//\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** You still don't care, do ya? That daft, blank expression on your face tells me everythin'. \n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** There will be no further questions at this time.\n> \n> //Dr. Clarkson stands and moves to the door, SCP-6414 becomes agitated.//\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Oi!

She's not well without me!\n> \n> //Dr. Clarkson does not respond.//\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Have you done somethin' to her? She's ill! She needs me!\n> \n> //SCP-6414 jumps from the table to the ground and runs towards the containment cell's door. SCP-6414 begins franticly scratching at the door.//\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Let me out!

For now, this interview is over.\n> \n> **SCP-6414:** Do ya promise to let me see her?\n> \n> **Dr. Clarkson:** I said, \"We will see.\"\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Notes:** //I hope you know we don't ever intend on releasing anomalous entities, but please don't give it any sort of false hope. Who knows what it will do if you agitate it into using some potentially dangerous anomalous properties we haven't seen yet.
