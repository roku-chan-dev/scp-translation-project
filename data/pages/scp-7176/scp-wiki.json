A Nirvana-class After-Dimensional Relay Console Device (NARC) has been outfitted within an isolated testing chamber located in the Memetic Research Lab. It is solely to be used for the purpose of monthly communication with SCP-7176.\n\nIndividuals who possess a Cognitive Resistance Value (or CRV) lower than 45 are strictly prohibited from ever interacting with the NARC Device. Excess infohazards reconstructed from the Device are to be disposed of via mechanical means. \n----\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7176 is the designation given to a room located somewhere in Site-400, though its exact location is as-of-yet unknown. SCP-7176 is approximately 5x5x5 meters in height and length, with its walls, floor, and ceiling being completely painted white. No other information regarding SCP-7176's interior, except that it lacks any doors or windows, is available at this time.\n\nNo physical or conceptual objects/entities are able to naturally enter SCP-7176, nor can any objects/entities naturally exit out of it. As such, all that occurs within SCP-7176 remains in SCP-7176 indefinitely. \n\nSCP-7176-A refers to Senior Researcher Zastryal Vnutri, previously a memeticist for Site-400's Department of Memetic and Countermemetic Research. He is an adult male of Russian descent, with blue eyes and a brown beard. Following the successful enactment of Project ÁSPRO, SCP-7176-A is now permanently located in SCP-7176 and is a central component of the anomaly.\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\"]]\n+++* NARC Broadcast #37\n\n**Date:** 01/09/2016\n\n**Assigned Communicator:** Dr. Kyran Kelly\n----\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Greetings, -A.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** {{Hello again, Kyran.}}\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** All quiet on the Western front?\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** {{All is quiet.}}\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Received.

Shortly after, he self-administered several Class-W mnestics, before reporting the phenomenon to his then Department Co-Head, Dr. Kyran Kelly. \n\nIt was ultimately realized that SCP-7176 was the natural byproduct created following the Department of Metafictional Research's recent discovery of [[[scp-000|SCP-███]]]. While information regarding SCP-7176 was lacking, it was overall decided that its properties could be used in furthering the Foundation's research into metafiction and pataphysics. \n\nWith approval from Site-400's current site director, Project ÁSPRO was developed and put into effect, with the Department of Memetic and Countermemetic Research managing its continued operational status. Dr. Vnutri volunteered himself to be the first (and only) SCP-7176-A instance that would be relocated within SCP-7176. As of this document, Project ÁSPRO has not overseen any sort of failures whatsoever.\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\"]]\n+++* NARC Broadcast #55\n\n**Date:** 01/03/2019\n\n**Assigned Communicator:** Dr. Kyran Kelly\n----\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Greetings, -A.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** {{Hello, Kyran.}}\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** All quiet on the Western front?\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** {{All is quiet.}}\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Received.

To summarize, its purpose is to utilize the true nature of SCP-7176's properties and apply them to the Foundation's core structure.\n\nApproval of Project ÁSPRO did not require extensive review and evaluation by any related parties, as it was found that the constituents necessary for its proper enactment were not difficult to fund and possess. This included:\n\n* The Saxon-Menard Fourth-Dimensional Flat-linear Hyper-Engine\n* The individual who would be SCP-7176-A (Dr. Zastryal Vnutri)\n* ███ ███████'█ █████, recovered from the components of the now-defunct [[[scp-3448|Project Dammerung]]].\n* A single dose of potassium cyanide.\n\nOf note, during Project ÁSPRO's enactment process, the entirety of Site-400's personnel reported that they continuously heard several noises described as similar to \"laughing and a typewriter being used\". These noises supposedly emanated from where Project ÁSPRO was undergoing its final inclusion process, though personnel present did not note any unusual occurrences.\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic\"]]\n+++* NARC Broadcast #72\n\n**Date:** 01/08/2020\n\n**Assigned Communicator:** Dr. Kyran Kelly\n----\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Greetings, -A.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** {{Kyran.

Usually, they serve no other purpose than to be present as soon as their associated narrative emerges and is incepted to baseline reality. Spotting initiumortypicals has been evidently difficult, as the inherent problem of detecting the emergence of their respective narratives often causes its properties and effects to be quickly negated and counterbalanced.\n\n@@ @@Initiumortypicals are almost always referred to in a plural sense, as an instance of a //single// initiumortypical is extremely rare. They are often killed in numbers, with the purpose of exacting the kind of tragedy no one truly cares about. For example, when a man is murdered and the detective has to solve his case by interviewing people close to him, that man is //not// an initiumortypical.

A small faint noise, similar to screaming, becomes audible. Dr. Kaydence takes a step back and scans his surrounding, as Junior Researcher Kobolsky awkwardly attempts to hide behind him. Dr. Kelly does not change from xeir original position.//\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** He's coming. Leave.\n\n**Dr. Kaydence:** About damn time. C'mon, we're up.\n\n**Rs. Kobolsky:** Roger.\n\n//Dr. Kaydence grabs Junior Researcher Kobolsky's shoulder and leads him to the entrance/exit door. Both of them depart, leaving behind Dr. Kelly alone in the Research Lab. Xe sighs and rubs xeir eyes, before sitting xemselves on a nearby stool.//\n\n//A floating white cube spontaneously manifested in the center of the Research Lab, though Dr. Kelly does not appear to be bemused. The cube slowly grows in size, eventually enveloping most of the objects within the Research Lab and bathing it in a bright white hue. Dr. Kelly covers xeir eyes, momentarily blinded. The screaming sound halts.//\n\n//From the center of the cube's source, a silhouette of a humanoid individual becomes visible. It began walking towards Dr. Kelly, before seemingly hesitating and staying in place.//\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Greetings, -A.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Hello, Kyran.\n\n//Several seconds of silence.//\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** All quiet on the Western front?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** (//chuckles dryly and gestures at xeir surroundings//) Obviously not.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Right, of course.\n\n//Several seconds of silence.//\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** You're not supposed to be here, -A.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** I know. I just wanted to see your face.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** I appreciate that.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** I'm afraid this might be the last time I'll ever see you.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** It won't be. Believe me.\n\n//Several seconds of silence.//\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** ...Kyran?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Yes?\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** We never knew each other that well, did we?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Everything you knew about me...\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Was from your personal file, yes.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** But who did I sang Summer Sunshine with?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** You sang it alone.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** ...why do you bother at all?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Because what you're doing now means so much more than you think. \n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Personally, I view deicide as a sin.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Don't lie. You were never religious, you said so. And this isn't deicide. This is liberation. Besides, to say it is a sin is more of an insult to //them// than to us.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Then when will my service to the Foundation end?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** It won't. Not until we surrender in the face of Armageddon.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** But that-\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Exactly.\n\n//Several seconds of silence.//\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** I don't feel upset.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** You're not supposed to. Not while you're here.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Did you do this to me? Am I dead?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Answering that question would take up a lot of our time, unfortunately. But the bottom line is that you did this to yourself.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** And you too?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** (//chuckles//) No. Kaydence said my death will be much more significant and established than yours in the coming future. I will die a glorious death, he said. Looking at how things are, it's hard to deny it.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** I'm starting to regret.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** Don't regret now, -A. Now is not exactly a good time. In fact, for you, all times are not good times. That's how you wrote it, if I remember correctly. Anyways, speaking of time-\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Who do you work for?\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** What? Oh, heh, good one. (//pauses//) The SCP Foundation and no other.\n\n**SCP-7176-A:** Thank you for your work, Dr. Kelly.\n\n**Dr. Kelly:** A pleasure.\n\n//The humanoid individual turns around and retreats back to the cube's source. The cube then shrinks, returning the color of the Research Lab, whose emergency lights had since been already turned off. The cube quickly demanifest, leaving Dr. Kelly alone.// \n\n//The entrance/exit door opens, and decontamination teams enter and began conducting depuration of hostile infohazards from the Research Lab. They are followed by Dr. Kaydence and Junior Researcher Kobolsky shortly after, who grabs the now unconscious Dr. Kelly by xeir arms and carries xem to the Health and Pathological Infirmary.//\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n**Addendum 7176-6, Untitled:**\n\n[[div class=\"overwatch-header\"]]\n[[div class=\"table0\"]]\n\n+++ **OVERSEER COUNCIL PROPOSAL SUMMARY**\n----\n[[<]]\n**PROPOSAL:**\n@@     @@\"Reclassify SCP-7176 as Thaumiel.
