  "content": "+ __Anonymous Articles Team__\n\nThe Anonymous Articles Team is responsible for allowing anonymous posting of articles on the wiki using The Community account, while maintaining anonymity. Anonymous Articles is tasked with posting and managing anonymous articles, as well as registering the original author.\n\nThe goal of the Anonymous Articles Team is to allow authors to post articles without directly attaching it to their username for a variety of reasons. These reasons can include (but aren't limited to) fear of recognition around a personal experience, a large style chance compared to usual output, a desire to participate in a contest anonymously, or other personal reasons. Anonymous articles still need to adhere to the [[[site-rules|site rules]]], but the Team does not review whether an article qualifies for anonymous posting based on content outside rule-breaking content.\n\n++ __Anonymous Articles Posting Procedures__\nThe Anonymous Article Team **does not require** the author to state their reason for posting anonymously, as this reason is not part of the article review. \n\nAll articles have to adhere to the following requirements:\n# Only articles that have not been posted before, can be posted anonymously.\n# The article cannot include content that goes against the [[[site-rules|site rules]]], [[[anti-harassment-policy|anti-harassment policy]]], or otherwise includes severe misconduct.\n# No custom HTML/CSS. As a result, only pre-existing CSS components and themes are allowed. The Anonymous Article Team will not manage tech review of custom CSS with the Tech team.\n# An article is required to have a completely filled out License box. Provide a link to all quotes and images used in the article, including those in the Public Domain. The Anonymous Articles Team will have the Licensing Team review the information in the license box before posting.\n\nIf no quotes or images are included, the following License box is to be included:\n\n> @@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author = Anonymous]]@@\n> @@[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]@@\n> @@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n\n+++ Accepting an Article for Anonymous Posting\nThe Anonymous Articles Team accepts anonymous posts on a case-by-case basis, and can deny the posting of an article if it sees fit. If an article was denied for posting and you wish to appeal, you can contact the sub-team captain.  \n\nOnly one article at a time is reviewed to be posted. Publication of several articles in a short period of time (example: a tale series, all entries to an event, etc.) is not accepted as a default. If you wish to publish anonymous articles in a larger volume for a specific reason, contact the sub-team captain to discuss options and requirements.\n\n+++ Posting Process For Users\n\n**Step 1**\nMessage a member of the Anonymous Article Team to inform them that you wish to post an article anonymously. This message should contain a link to the article you wish to post, as well as the title, desired slot or url, and author post. You need to include a complete license box, which includes links to images and quotes used. You must qualify for an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/authors-pages author page] to qualify for anonymous posting.\n\n**Step 2**\nThe Rewrite Team will make a copy of the article and do a review to make sure that the article does not contain any rule breaking content. Please allow the team sufficient time to review the article.\n\n**Step 3**\nOnce the article has been cleared, it will be posted by the Rewrite Team using the \"The Community\" account, at the anonymous author's discretion.\n\n+++ After Posting\nThe Anonymous Articles Team maintains a list of the authors of anonymously posted articles using The Community account. Curation's captain, vice-captain and admins have access to the list. If necessary, contents on the list can be shared with AHT or Disciplinary in extreme circumstances.\n\nThe Rewrite Team reserves the right to deny posting an anonymous article.\n\nRequests to delete or de-anonymise an article can be forwarded to a member of the Anonymous Article Team. After de-anonymisation of an article, it cannot be reposted anonymously again.\n\nEdits to text can be done on request by forwarding an update of the page source code to an Anonymous Articles Team member. This might result in additional review of edited text to make sure it is compliant with site rules. Requests for edits can only be done once per month. Edits to CSS follow the same rules, except in cases of page-breaking errors, in which case an edit request can be accepted before the reset of a month has passed.\n\nSubmitting an anonymous article for a contest counts as your submission for that contest. Posting a regular article for a contest after an anonymous one will result in the deletion of the regular article and automatic de-anonymisation of the initial article. \n\n+++ Team members\n\nThe Anonymous Articles Team currently consists of the following team members:\n[[*user FlyPurgatorio]] (Subteam-captain)\n[[*user Stormbreath]]\n[[*user Riemann]]\n[[*user HarryBlank]]",
