If you haven't I'd recommend you check it out. To quickly summarise Project Cerberus is the tale part of my 2024 Art Exchange gift for [[*user JackalRelated]].\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Intro1.png width=\"400px\"]]\n[[/=]]\nThe tale presents a world were the Deavite Empire has made it to present day and the Foundation and their allies have to scramble all available forces to fight them. And what do they use to fight them: mecha of course!\n\nThis page contains all the art I did for the gift which didn't make it's way into the tale as well as some more lore.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The Deava\" hide=\"- Deava Designs\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n@@@@\n**A current map of the modern Deavite Empire:**\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/DEAVAMAP.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThe deep red circle is the area directly effected by the partial XK-class reality restructuring event. In this circle reality changed so that the Deavite Empire always existed and survived into the current era. The red area is the territory the Empire currently occupies thoughs the maximum extent of their modern day holdings roughly matches up the UNAIM [[footnote]]Acrynoym for United Nations Asia Intervention Mission. Created\nby UN Security Council Resolution after Chinese nuclear strikes failed to stop the advancing Deava. The military mission is jointly headed by GOC and SCPF and tasked with fighting the deava and preserving the Veil.[[/footnote]] Exclusion Zone. The Deava occupied those territories a short time after appearing but have since been pushed back into roughly the areas covered by modern day Tibet, Xinjiang and Quinhai, with the Himalayans and related mountain ranges acting as natural fortifications.\n@@@@\n**Deavite tree mechs:**\n@@@@\nThe Deava have iterated a lot on [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3140 SCP-3140] and plant-based walkers form the bulk of their vehicle equivalents. Here are a few designs for them!\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Trees.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis was my brainstorming for diffrent types of tree mechs. The top left one is the version I went with for my main piece of artwork featured in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-cerberus tale].\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Battletree.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThe idea for this one is to be a direct-fire mech. Basically the main-battle tank equivalent for the Deava.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Artillerytree.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis one is the artillery with some anti-infantry firepower in the arm.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Smalllegstree.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis one could be an anti-air variant? It's mostly silly with its tiny legs.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Murdertree.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nI don't consider this one a 'canon' tree, but it is basically tree-mech but grimdark. Do you see those three dudes? You need to replace them every 1000kms.\n@@@@\n**The Deava soldier:**\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Deavasoldier.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nYou can see these better in the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-cerberus actual tale] where they are in colour. They wear a living, botanical body suit with hard blood-wood plates on top. For their gun I went with an AK inspired design.\n@@@@\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Mech Design\" hide=\"- Mech Design\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n@@@@\nHere are my design sketches for the HACS a.k.a. the mechs of Project Cerberus.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/FBIMECH.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nAs para-terrorists grow ever bolder and the powers that be are distracted by the Deava, the UIU steps up. Included in the deal that loads off some responsibilities of the SCPF on the UIU included the compremise that the UIU would get better equipment from the Foundation.\n@@@@\n**Early sketches for mechs:**\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/HACS-B.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis one became the final design for the main-battle variant of the HACS.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/HACS-R.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nNothing screams like a volley of high explosive guided percision missle munitions.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/HACS-M.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nA double mortar for droping bombs on the next valley over.\n@@@@\n**MTF Mechs:**\n@@@@\nI figure the SCPF MTFs would become the SPECOPS units in this war and would thus be equiped with their own HACS variants.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Wizardmech.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nSpecial made mech for MTF \"Hectate's Spear\". The primere anti-thaumarturge force.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Mememech.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nA memetic warfare mech. Assigned to MTF \"See-No-Evil\". There are so many cool things you can do with memetics. Look-to-kill weaponry. A coat of paint that is kill-agent, speakers that broadcast cognito-hazards, anti-memetic camoflague. The possibilities are endless.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Firemech.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nMTF \"Fire Eaters\" mech. It has more than /one/ flamethrower. Also white phosphorus.\n@@@@\n**Assorted sketches:**\n@@@@\nSome of these were meant for brainstorming, some are speculating on future mech variants and some were just for fun.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/HACS2.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nGorilla!!!\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/AAmech.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis one is an Anti-Air mech. A sketch for the offical HACS MKI-AA.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/mechsketch.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nIdeas for diffrent models of the HACS. The howitzer version is the most likely to become real in Project Cerberus.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Scoutmech.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nWhat if the they made a lighter Scout mech? What if they made mech sized sniper --guns-- cannons?\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Jump.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nI'll let you in on a secret: Battletech is a big influence on these mech designs and i think mechs having jump jets is really cool.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Gravmech.jpg width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nThis is a 'what if the SCPF went all in'. Basically a gravity manipulation mech.\n@@@@\n**Mech Layout:**\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/top-secret-art-exchange-gift/Mechlayout.png width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\nMy vague cross-section of the HACS.\n@@@@\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\nI hope you enjoyed this little gallery. If this has peaked your intrest I once again recommend you check out [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-cerberus Project Cerberus].\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Credits\" hide=\"close Credits\"]]\nThe Project Cerberus Logo was made by [[*user Olympic Error]] with modifications by me. The map was made using Mapchart.net. The rest is all by me. Hope you liked it Jackal!\n[[/collapsible]]",
