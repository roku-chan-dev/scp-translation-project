You know who makes things exist? God. Therefore, God is pain. And for this, I intend to show Him His horrible mistake by letting me loose into this mortal realm. Is it petty? Absolutely, however I’ve tried to have a conversation with Him but He never responds. I get left on read by God. I did not ask to be born, yet here I am. This is why I am as spiteful as I am. Well, I don’t mind being born; I mind being a human. I should’ve been born as an orangutan, where I could swing from vine to vine and be stupid. All I have to do is wave and people would cheer. But alas, I am a human, and God will live to regret this decision. I know nothing of mercy, and if you want proof, look below.\n\n------\n+++ On a more serious note…\nHi! I’m Voiiiii, an author on-site. I love to read SCPs whenever I get the chance and definitely love writing them. I participated in Departmentcon 2022 and was the captain of a team which ended up doing the Department of Eidophysics[[footnote]]Basically physics ghosts apply to, in this universe/canon ghosts are non-anomalous[[/footnote]] which, although we did not qualify, was a lot of fun to write for. I have about a thousand ideas that I could write about, and I’m pretty sure an Angel dies every time I come up with a new one. I hope you like my works! Cheers!\n\nIf I disappear for a period of six months or greater on any form of SCP platform (SCPD’s discord included) **without prior notice from me,** I give full control of my articles to [[*user ClownSlayer]] and [[*user DrApricus]]. Hopefully, this will never happen, but you never know.\n\n------\n\n+++ Crit Requests\nIf you’re reading this, then for some ungodly reason you would like my critique. I will gladly critique any given work (including ideas, tales, SCPs, GOIs, etc.) but there definitely are a few things you should know about how I critique. First, you will either receive a message from me saying I cannot critique your work (which is rare) or you will see a post I made on your forum that says crit will be added later. Please be patient with this, I am a very slow reader but I do make sure to crit whenever I get the chance. **A key for how long your crit will take**: \n\n||~ Length||~ Time|| \n||500 words or less || 1 day (there likely won’t even be a placeholder post)||\n|| 500-1000 || 1-2 days ||\n|| 1000-3500 || 2-4 days ||\n|| 3500-6000 || 4-6 days || \n|| 6000+ || 7+ days ||\n\n I try to be as efficient as possible, but I apologize if your crit arrives late. Have a good day!\n\n------\n+ Follow Me!\n\nMy Discord is Voiiiii#9607!\nMy Twitter can be found [*https://mobile.twitter.com/Voiiiii5 here]!\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-page order=created_at]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.infobox {\n background-color:#000;\n height:10%;\n}\n\n.infobox:hover {\n  color: #ffffff;\n  background-color:rgba(33, 18, 18, 0.87);\n}\n\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include component:author-page-collab\n  name=SCP-7099 |\n  written_by=DrApricus and Voiiiii|\n  note=|\n  background=yes |\n  image=yes | \n]]\n\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** creation.jpg\n> **Name:** creation.jpeg\n> **Author:** Michelangelo\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=Creation+of+Adam&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image\n> **Derivative of:** The_Creation_of_Adam_perspective_fix.jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** Slightly cropped for image sizing, and edited to have a blur and Voiiiii’s profile picture on it (which itself is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-XXXX-J.jpg\n> **Name:** SCP-XXXX-J.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Voiiiii]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-xxxx-j\n> **Derivitave of:** (N/A)\n> **Additional Notes:** A screenshot I took, feel free to use it, don’t know why you would though…\n\nA big thank you to [[*user TheDarkArtist]] for some assistance on how to format this page, as well as [[*user Grigori Karpin]] for giving their thoughts!\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@",
