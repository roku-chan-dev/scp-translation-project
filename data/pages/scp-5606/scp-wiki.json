After receiving a monthly medical evaluation, SCP-5606's infusion pump is to be calibrated.\n\nAll information regarding Gregori Talmov, Katrina Pernova, or Sicilia Pernova is to be given to the Site-51 POI Recovery Department. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\nSCP-5606 is a circular biological entity composed entirely of human tissue, measuring 32.5 cm in diameter and 12 cm in depth. Though incapable of movement, SCP-5606 vocalizes the word \"tick\" every 30 seconds. Initial analyses revealed substantial thaumaturgical residue, indicating a carnomantic ritual was responsible for SCP-5606's creation. Further information on SCP-5606 is available below:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ SCP-5606 Medical Analysis ■\" hide=\"□ SCP-5606 Medical Analysis □\"]]\n**Date:** 2020/01/28\n\n**Subject:** SCP-5606\n\n**Operator:** Dr. William Strauss\n------\n**Sex:** Unavailable \n**Body Weight:** 18.6 kg\n**Height:** 32.5 cm\n**BMI:** 2.1\n**Blood Type:** All\n------\n**External Examination**\nThe anterior section of the organism is composed of skin similar to that found on human scrotums. In the center sits an orifice resembling a mouth; although lacking teeth, the orifice does have a tongue. 12 evenly spaced thoracic vertebrae protrude through the edge of the anterior. The skin has been stretched tight, allowing the bones underneath to be visible. Located on each side of the orifice is a small prehensile hand, measuring 5.1 and 3.4 cm respectively. On the posterior of SCP-5606 there is a large sack containing the lungs, heart, and brain of the organism.\n\n**Internal Examination:**\nX-Ray and MRI analysis of SCP-5606 revealed all of its bones to be human collar and pelvic bones. The size of these bones indicates they all were originally from prepubescent children of various ages and sexes. SCP-5606 has three functional hearts crudely fused together. It also possesses a pair of lungs, the left of which is vestigial. A total of 17 human amygdalae are also present, along with two hypothalami. SCP-5606 has no nervous system and is devoid of all sensory organs.\n\n**Toxicity**\n\nSCP-5606 toxicology screening shows high concentrations of embryonic stem cells, estrogen, and progesterone. DNA analysis produced varied and unidentifiable results.\n\n**Prognosis**\nDue to lacking the organs required to digest food or water, subject must receive nutrition and hydration intravenously. Even so, the long term sustainability of SCP-5606 is unlikely.\n[[=]]\n[[html]]\n<img src=\"https://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/scp-5108/medical\" style=\"height:75px; width:75px; padding-left: 0%;\">\n[[/html]]\n[[size smaller]]**Medical Department**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nSCP-5606 was discovered when Timothy Perry contacted the Lakewood Police Department regarding a suspicious package. Subsequent police reports of a strange organism being recovered alerted the Foundation, and an item recovery team was dispatched. After successfully recovering the anomaly, the following document was found attached to the inside of the box:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Attached Document ■\" hide=\"□ Attached Document □\"]]\n> To Gregori,\n> \n> It's about //time// you made me a grandmother. This marriage was arranged for a reason. After all, a woman's biological clock only ticks for so long.\n> \n> Much Love, Sicilia\n> \n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe house next to Mr. Perry's is owned by Gregori Patlov, which was later discovered to be an alias of Gregori Talmov, a known affiliate of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2408 GoI-0432 (\"The Hunter's Black Lodge\")]. Mr. Talmov recently married Katrina Pernova, daughter of high ranking GOI-0432 member Sicilia Pernova. The location of the suspects is currently unknown.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5605]]] | SCP-5606 | [[[SCP-5607]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
