Due to its nature, however, no such procedures are necessary.\n\nThe consensus definition of SCP-0000-EX being an unexplainable and natural phenomenon is to be maintained -- however, should any non-Foundation research prove otherwise, all persons involved in such a study are to be immediately amnesticized. The work of said persons is to be cataloged and assessed for any research value for the Foundation and otherwise disposed of.\n\n**Description:** SCP-0000-EX is a global phenomenon manifesting inside the unconscious minds of individuals who have undergone amnesticization procedures; during an episode in which a human being experiences the effects of SCP-0000-EX, they are, for a short period of time, able to recollect memories erased by amnestics. In effect, affected individuals answer to past stimuli instead of present ones.\n\n0.01% of all individuals affected by SCP-0000-EX have been reported dead within ten years of exposure; whether or not this was caused by SCP-0000-EX is unknown.\n\nThe first appearance of SCP-0000-EX manifested in 1873, inside of the mind of Paul Verlaine, a French poet, without any apparent source; the Overwatch Council had not interacted with Verlaine in the past.\n\n**File update:** All Foundation files regarding \"The All-seeing Eye\" are to be limited access to the Overseer Council. All mentions of \"Project Immortality\" and other actions regarding inter-dimensional analyzing of deaths of alternate individuals are to be expunged from Foundation databases.\n\nFor more information regarding the source and nature of SCP-0000-EX, see Addendum 0000-EX-1.\n\n\n{{>access addendum 0000-ex-1}}\n\n> Do our minds forgive?\n\n{{Only in our deepest dreams.}}\n\n-----\n**Addendum 0000-EX:** The following articles are a series of letters written by O5-1 to the Overseer Council, concerning the discovery of SCP-0000-EX and its nature.\n\n> Fellow Overseers,\n> @@ @@\n> My research team has successfully been able to remove one's recollection of a day without damaging their memories or cognitive abilities.

During an SCP-0000-D event, the affected individual appears to recollect memories of events that never transpired. It appears that individuals suffering from the effects of SCP-0000-D believe the effect is a natural one[[footnote]] Except the members of the O5 Council, who appear to be assured the effect of SCP-0000-D had originated from mass amnestization procedures, attributing the effects of SCP-0000-D from undergoing such. [[/footnote]].\n\nThe first fourteen instances of SCP-0000-D were discovered within the minds of Paul Verlaine, a French poet, and the thirteen individuals known as the O5 Council. \n\nApproximately 0.1% of individuals affected by SCP-0000-D have been reported dead due to a total collapse of their consciousness. Though multiple attempts have been made to remove SCP-0000-D from the noospheric space human minds possess, no equipment, even anomalous, has been able to successfully do so.\n\n**Addendum 0000-D-1:** Foundation files regarding the elimination of all life within Dimensions 0000-1 through 0000-14 for the purpose of \"Project Immortality\" have been successfully removed from RAISA records. Further data obtained from said action has been redirected to the office of the Administrator.

Though the effects of SCP-0000-ARC have been found to be antimemetic, assuring individuals affected by it that its existence is a natural one, a total of fourteen individuals - the O5 Council and Paul Verlaine -- have been found to be resilient to this effect.\n\nIndividuals affected by SCP-0000-ARC have been found to repeatedly fall off synchronization with local reality, causing them to inevitably lose control of their bodies, totally collapsing their consciousnesses. Though only a total of 1% of individuals suffering from the SCP-0000-ARC phenomenon have perished because of it, based on the past growth rate it has been calculated that in three generations time, the entire population of Earth will most likely become eliminated due to it.\n\n**Addendum 0000-1:** [FATAL DATA ERROR] IT WAS A LIeEE3\n\n[PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CLOSES T RA I SA  OFFICE TO R3COLLECT D4T  A] W3 FAILED | 1T DO3SNT WORK\n\n[CRITICAL DATABASE ERROR] ALL TH0SE D3ATH5 F0R N.THI1NgG\n\nIT DOESNT WORK\n\nTHE 5Y5TEM DOESNT WORK\n\nTHEeyyy ARE fR3Eee e ///@@#Z$}{PKT!@\n\n\n|*&^%# THEY REBELLED|&&^$\n\n\n|OUR MINDS C00RUPTED *%#@}}}\n\nerase\n\nerase all\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nerase the minds erase the sins\n\n[CRITICAL DATABASE ERROR.

Congratulations. Consider its contents your reward.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures** A long, long time ago, the O5 Council, alongside myself, attempted to create an alert system for humanity to battle an ongoing XK Event. \n\nWith the help of all of the Thaumiels we could gather, we created a machine. A machine that could gather information from all possible realities and calculate the probabilities of specific people dying; \"The All-seeing Eye\", we called it. With it, we were able to make ourselves virtually immortal. We knew what would kill us and how to avoid it. But that wasn't enough. Nothing was ever enough.\n\n**Description:** We found the resolution to the biggest problem we could have, and actually have, ever faced. We implanted an alert system within all humans using the device and we concealed it with a meme that made everyone think it was natural. In the process, however, we killed them all. \n\nEveryone. \n\nIf you have any sense within you, you should now be asking how this could possibly make sense. If we killed everyone, then who was left to protect? You see, we murdered everyone else. Fourteen dimensions, each wiped out by one of us. We murdered all those people and studied their deaths with the machine, creating a pattern map of what could potentially happen in the process. Yes, it was the worst thing we had ever done. Hell, it was the worst thing anyone could have ever done. Except, we failed. You see, the alerting system was flawed. We realized this once we had already implemented it within everyone. It didn't work. Sure, it fired once in a while, but almost never at the proper time.\n\nYou see, the implementation of the system was designed to literally put the dead souls of those people into the minds of the population of our world. The hope was that they would know how they could possibly die and trigger an alert to avoid dying. Of course, as I said, that didn't work. But not because of us; it was due to the many people we had sacrificed. You see, we hadn’t considered that they might retain any of their intentionality and that they might not be satisfied with being a piece in the survival of humanity or ourselves. But then they tried to take control back from us. We tried to stop them, of course, but we failed.\n\nSo we all forgot.\n\nWe wiped every memory out, over, and over, and over, and over, in the result slowing down the potential mass genocide they had planned for us.\n\nBut even then, we were immortal. We knew about it, no matter how hard we tried. That was a part of a pact we made a long time ago; we had to live with our sins. So we deleted our minds, wiping everything about ourselves from the world. Thirteen Overseers gone, through means I can't even remember.\n\nExcept myself. I never forgot.\n\nAnd I'm here to make you remember. \n\nWake up, O5-12. \n\nRemember what we did.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= Remember data?\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= {{No.}}\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
