(1000~1200 words)**\nMy anomalous ability primarily involves writing résumés for those who request them. When someone submits a résumé form to me, I can craft an appealing résumé that makes the recipient want to hire the individual simply by looking at it. For instance, Mr. [REDACTED], who lives in Seoul, South Korea, asked me for help with his résumé and was accepted into [REDACTED]. His résumé passed current plagiarism detection systems without any issues. Up to this point, it might seem like I am just an ordinary ghostwriter, but I possess an anomalous ability that allows me to understand everything about a person through means that remain scientifically unexplained. This results in a perfect résumé that looks as if it were written by the individual themselves. Because of this, there is no need for additional consulting to prepare for interviews. The Foundation considers this a significant element that could lead to social disruption.\nAdditionally, I have a user-targeting ability, which means I am essentially in a non-contained state. In fact, the Foundation nearly failed to find me. It was revealed when [DATA EXPUNGED] sought my help without knowing that the Foundation uses truth serum interrogations during its researcher recruitment process and mentioned it during the //interview//. This user-targeting ability allows me to contact only potential users through anomalous means. Despite the Foundation blocking email addresses, phone numbers, and faxes and conducting extensive censorship of postal services, users have quadrupled in the past two years.\nOf course, I am aware that my document-editing capability is similar to [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-779-ko|SCP-779-KO]]] and [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-380-ko|SCP-380-KO]]]. Some scrutinous doctors might not appreciate this, but I plan to actively use another of my anomalous abilities to address this. I can edit any document, including those I am mentioned, to fit the résumé format. This applies to both online and offline documents, and even the SCP-703-KO report has long since been altered in this way. As a result, the Foundation has difficulty maintaining accurate records, including special containment procedures. Many experiments are currently planned, but I would like to state that they will not yield any results.\n\n**Object Class: Choose an object class of your liking from Safe, Euclid, and Keter, and state the reason why. (900~1000 words)**\nNaturally, I should be classified as Safe. I understand that the Foundation primarily bases its classifications on the ease of containment, which is why I am currently rated as Keter. However, an exception should be made in my case. Consider the classification system itself: Safe, Euclid, and Keter. Euclid is named after a mathematician, and Keter is a term from Jewish mysticism. These names carry implied meanings that are not immediately intuitive. In contrast, \"Safe\" conveys a clear image, suggesting that the object is not lethal or dangerous to humanity. Given this clear image, I should be classified as Safe for the smooth operation of my business. You might wonder, \"Why should the Foundation help an SCP with its business operations?\" There are two reasons for this.\nFirst, I pose no danger to humans. On the contrary, I provide significant benefits and increase social welfare, aligning with the Foundation's goal of protecting humanity. Analysis through user warranty services has shown that everyone who has received my help has been able to present their abilities optimally and get accepted into their desired universities or companies. There is no need to worry about the Foundation being included in this. As long as truth serum interrogations are used in the hiring process, abilities can be fairly evaluated.\nSecond, I am currently perceived by the public as a simple ghostwriter or résumé writing service, meaning my anomalous abilities are not known. Considering that the Foundation's containment measures disrupt my business, I am inclined to be as cooperative as possible. I have already taken measures such as obtaining fake personal information usage permits and fake surveillance permits from users. Given these considerations, I should be classified under the Safe category.\n\n**Choose a type of portfolio such as Special Containment Procedures, Description, and Addendum, and describe the most memorable event between you and the Foundation.**\n\n|| Category || Title || Description ||\n|| Addendum || Interview Log 703-KO-1 || After initial discovery, the Foundation tried to communicate with me. They called the publicly available number [REDACTED], and this is the answer that I gave them. ||\n\n> **Dr Z:** I have a question. Did you provide résumé writing services about [DATA EXPUNGED] in a recent researcher recruitment interview?\n> \n> **Me:** Yes, that is correct. Is this the \"SCP Foundation\"? I recall you required quite a sophisticated resume.\n> \n> **Dr Z:** Yes we are. What you're doing is based on anomalous abilities, and we demand you to cease operation immediately.\n> \n> **Me:** We are a respectable establishment that follows strict guidelines and provides services at a reasonable cost. As a courtesy, we should tell you we do not have any information about you, doctor. We follow a strict privacy policy that collects data only after agreeing to using our services. So-\n> \n> **Dr Z:** Cut the crap, why do you really run the business? Is it for profit like everyone else, or is there another purpose?\n> \n> **Me:** I'm sorry, but I can't answer questions irrelevant to the company's services. Trust between the client and our company is a base for a successful exchange.\n> \n> **Dr Z:** So, are you a company, or an individual? How big are you?\n> \n> **Me:** I'm sorry, but I can't answer questions irrelevant to the company's services. Trust between the client and our company is a base for a successful exchange.\n> \n> **Dr Z:** \"Company\", is it? You sure sound like one. \n> \n> **Me:** I'm sorry, but I can't answer questions irrelevant to my services. Trust between the client and our company is a base for a successful exchange.\n> \n> //(Further communication deemed pointless. Interview over.)//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Kaestine, translation by fluxman]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
