SCP-7057's backstory and relevant documentation have been created and any discrepancies found in said documents should be reported to Site-549 director Hugh Bradley immediately. SCP-7057's identity should be protected in accordance with the Ethics Committee to ensure Foundation personnel interact with them naturally within a public setting. Any prior procedures for SCP-7057 have been discontinued.\n----\n__**Description:**__ //##grey|SCP-7057 is a humanoid possessing anomalous DNA which contains 2 additional base pairs, labelled Sermothine (S) and Yatromine (Y). It is believed that SCP-7057 is an individual from a similar yet slightly different reality from our own, the leading explanation for their unique genetics. SCP-7057 also has an inability to produce basic communication, however can comprehend basic speech from other individuals. SCP-7057 is confirmed to not possess reality-bending capabilities, maintaining a level of 1 Hume throughout many tests (See **Addendum #1**).##//\n\nSCP-7057 was declassified as part of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6296 EVERSOR Initiative] and due to their apparent lack of any anomalous properties, save for their DNA and inexplicable origin. It was apparent to Site-549 personnel that containment of SCP-7057 was unnecessary and hence a declassification process for SCP-7057 begun.\n\n__NOTE:__ No further connection between [[[SCP-7805]]] and SCP-7057 has been documented up to the time of declassification of anomaly (6/12/2022).\n----\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"read\"]][[collapsible show=\"Click to view: Archived documentation on SCP-7057 (Already Viewed)\" hide=\"Archived documentation on SCP-7057 (Already Viewed)\"]][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[<]]\n__**Discovery:**__ SCP-7057 was brought to the Foundation's attention on 3/8/2015, a few days after a fatal car crash taking the lives of four individuals and critically injuring one in the City of Gosnells, Perth, Australia. A few witnesses to the crash were brought in to the local police station for questioning and one witness in particular caught the officers' attentions. This witness failed to produce basic speech and could not be found on any census database. DNA tests to find any potential family of the witness returned back a unique strand of DNA with six base pairs instead of four. It was then that the Foundation became aware of SCP-7057 who was swiftly sent into containment within Site-549 and all police and citizens who had heard about SCP-7057 were amnesticized.\n\n[[/<]]\n----\n\n= __**Addendum #1 - Summary of SCP-7057 Experiments 1-5**__\n= In order to better grasp SCP-7057's anomalous properties, tests were performed on both their DNA and person.\n||~ Experiment No. ||~ Description ||~ Findings ||\n||= #1 ||= A Kant counter is used on SCP-7057 for the duration of a day to determine their Hume level. ||= SCP-7057 maintained a level of 1 Hume throughout the whole 24 hours, showing no fluctuations. ||\n||= #2 ||= A Kant counter records SCP-7057's Hume levels while a source of danger is presented to them. ||= While SCP-7057 definitely exerted typical signs of stress and anxiety, Hume levels remained at 1. This verifies that SCP-7057 does not have any reality-bending or otherwise anomalous properties which would be activated under pressure. ||\n||= #3 ||= A Kant counter records SCP-7057's Hume levels while they are periodically shocked at a level of 30V every 3 minutes. ||= SCP-7057 reacted as expected, growing anxious anticipating the next shock. Hume levels remained consistent. Researchers conclude that SCP-7057 has no anomalous effects aside from their unique DNA. ||\n||= #4 ||= A sample of SCP-7057's blood is tested against pathogens to compare resistance to that of a human's. ||= SCP-7057's blood reacts as expected. Unique alterations of SCP-7057's DNA are theorized to be simply cosmetic and may not have any effect of function. ||\n||= #5 ||= A sample of SCP-7057's blood is mutated to determine any effects it may have on its composition. ||= No unique reactions are present. SCP-7057 appears to be a normal human with DNA that while unique does not impact any functionality at all. Reason for SCP-7057's inability to communicate is still to be determined. ||\n----\n\n= __**Addendum #2 - Notice from Ethics Committee regarding SCP-7057**__\nDated: 7/6/2016\n[[div class=\"ethics_memo\"]]\n[[size 130%]]\nFollowing research efforts to determine if SCP-7057 exerts any potential anomalous or reality-bending capabilities and the apparent absence of said qualities, the Ethics Committee believe it is in the best interest of Site-549 to cease all experimentation on SCP-7057, particularly tests which may contribute to psychological distress. We also believe that containment of SCP-7057 may be unnecessary and efforts to release and declassify SCP-7057 will be encouraged.\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n= __**Addendum #3 - Overseer Council Memo (November, 2022)**__\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"eversor\"]]\n++ **FROM THE OFFICE OF THE OVERSEERS**\n[[size 110%]]\n----\n//The following notice has been disseminated to every known network within the SCiP.Net database.//\n \nAttention to all staff,\n \nAs of November 2022, the majority of the Overseer Council (along with the Ethics Committee, the Directors' Command, the High Court, and the Administrator's Office) has officially commissioned a Foundation-manned operation known as the EVERSOR Initiative.\n \nThe Initiative will be primarily headed by the Decommissioning Department, and will be focused on neutralizing or otherwise nullifying the effects of low-level anomalous objects directly contained by the Foundation. The purpose of the Initiative is to hopefully lower the monetary costs relating to the Foundation's current budget (a memo explaining the circumstances of [[[scp-6004|Incident 6004-MONGOOSE]]] has been attached to this notice).\n \nA Site-01 liaison has been transferred and assigned to each individual Foundation facility to ensure that the proper personnel ensures the preservation of the EVERSOR Initiative. Keep in mind that the Initiative has been classed as a Class-V Priority in the SCP Foundation Dogma.\n \nWe thank you for your cooperation and understanding.\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n= __**Addendum #4 - Discussion regarding the declassification of SCP-7057**__\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Specialist Jayden Harman //(Site-01 Liaison)//\n**From:** Dir. Bradley //(Head of Site-549)//\n**Subject:** Request for the declassification of SCP-7057\n**Attachment:** **##grey|SCP-7057 Declassification Plan##**\n##grey|Sent: 23/11/2022, 12:35##\n[[/div]]\n------\nGood afternoon, Specialist Harman.\n\nWe at Site-549 have been following your advice on which low-level anomalies we should be neutralizing very closely. However, we think it would set a bad precedent if we were to neutralize SCP-7057. Hence, I propose that due to 7057 apparently not having any notable anomalous properties that we should instead declassify them and send them back into the world.\n\nAttached is a document outlining the steps we would take to ensure a smooth transition from anomaly to citizen, which I believe will still keep us above the line, economically speaking. Anyways, thanks for your guidance so far and hope you consider this option.\n\n- Director Hugh Bradley\n\n//**Staff of the SCP Foundation**//\n//##grey|Head of Site 549##//\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dir.

Hence, declassifying SCP-7057 seems like a viable option.\n\nShould this action backfire and cost the Foundation more than originally planned, then I am afraid it may lead to the termination of your position as Head of Site-549. I hope you don't let us down.\n\nRegards,\n@@ @@Specialist Jayden Harman\n\n//**Staff of the SCP Foundation**//\n//##grey|Site-01 Liaison##//\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __SITE-549 TERMINAL__\n[[/=]]\n[[size 150%]]__History:__[[/size]]\n\n* [[size 130%]]{{ARCHIVED}} - [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7057/offset/1 SCP-7057] (Last updated: 7/6/2016)[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]__You still have ##white|1## File(s) left to view:__[[/size]]\n[[size 130%]]\n* {{CURRENT VERSION}} - [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7057/offset/3 SCP-7057] (Last updated: 25/2/2023)\n[[/size]]\n@@@@\n[[span class=\"blink\"]]__[[/span]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[/div]]",
