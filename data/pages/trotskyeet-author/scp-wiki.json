I don't remember what was the first one I read unfortunately, but I do remember reading [*http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-1981 SCP-1981] in an empty hotel room that night and yelping in surprise at the last transcript.[[footnote]] My horror tolerance is a mere quarter of that of an average human. [[/footnote]] I continued lurking until later in the year when I realized \"Hey I should actually make an account,\" and did just that, starting my reign of the SCP Wiki with an iron fist.\n\nI'm primarily a comedic author and enjoy writing absurd situations played straight (I also enjoy the usage of parentheses and footnotes as asides.)[[footnote]] Case in point. [[/footnote]] For some reason, my topics tend to gravitate towards food, although I am a mediocre cook at best. As a reader I enjoy urban fantasy, sci-fi, and long walks by the beach.\n\n= **Author Will and stuff**\n= I, Trotskyeet being of mostly sound body and mind do declare that after an inactivity period of 2 years with no explanation posted on my author page (ex. \"Hey guys I'm stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean so I won't be that active for a while.\" or something like that) stewardship of my articles (minus collabs, those go to the coauthors obviously) shall be given to [[*user Ralliston]], who can do whatever they please with the articles except for deleting them. Alternatively, print out my articles, burn them, and scatter the ashes over the White Cliffs of Dover on a windy day. Whichever is more convenient.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nYou finished?
