This is unintentional.\n\n-- Eli Forkley, Director, DoMC\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:**\n\n**Object Class:**\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4773-2 has been moved to a 4 metre by 4 metre by 4 metre containment cell[[footnote]]Size of chamber acts as a baseline for testing; see **Addendum.1** for more information.[[/footnote]] at Site-96 for the purpose of testing. Containment Team CT-4773 are to remain on standby during the initial Preliminary Analysis phase of containment, which is ongoing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4773-2 is a brown, stuffed bear composed of synthetic fur and cotton. SCP-4773-2 will periodically levitate between 10 and 70 centimetres from the ground, and move in irregular patterns. Objects, entities, and surfaces near SCP-4773-2 may be wholly or partially imperceptible. This is considered normal behaviour.\n\nDue to events, it is suspected that the anomaly possesses some secondary mind-affecting effects. --This has been conclusively disproved.-- //This is considered --normal-- behaviour.// See below.\n\n**Tentative Description:** The following properties which may or may not relate to circumstances surrounding SCP-4773-2 are currently unconfirmed. Reader discretion is advised.\n* Mass, shape, etc. -- baseline, normal physical properties\n* Movement (__verified__)\n* Changes in environment (unspecified (__verified__))\n* Removal of food.\n* Triggering of //unspecified// subconscious instincts amongst personnel.\n* Improper disposal of food --waste--//, which was fully edible at the time//(?) by personnel\n * Fate unknown.\n * Currently three (3) sandwiches, four (4) packets of salted potato chips, and various assorted confectionery.\n* Movement (__unverified__)\n* --Mind-affecting--[[footnote]] Invoking emotions\n- sadness\n- pity --for what?--[[/footnote]]\n* It's difficult (__verified__)\n* --An inability to properly co--\n* --Staff are unable t--\n* The existence of implications (__unclear__)(?)\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum.1 | Testing Log:**\n\nOn April 10th, 1996, a proposal for testing involving SCP-4773-2 (intended to collect data on its anomalous visual effects) was approved by Site-96 staff, and conducted a week later.[[footnote]]During this time, SCP-4773-2's containment cell was designated off-limits and personnel were advised to create an acceptable baseline by keeping interaction with related anomalies to a minimum. Also of note, SCP-4773-2's visual properties did not correspond to its location.[[/footnote]] For the test, the east-facing wall of SCP-4773-2's containment cell was lined with numbered square tiles, 25 cm in length, and observed via closed-circuit surveillance systems. Every hour, a Researcher made note of which tiles they were unable to view, either partially or fully.[[footnote]] SCP-4773-2's location can be ascertained from the placement of the red tile. [[/footnote]] Five hours into testing, procedures were halted, as no conclusive evidence was able to be drawn. The data-sets can be found below.\n[[=image Times.png class=\"crom-thumbnail\"]]\nTesting concluded on April 18th, 1996.\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"There is (1) new update to the file\" hide=\"Showing update...\"]]\n[[<]]\n> **1996-04-23**\n> -----\n> SCP-4773-2 has been identified as non-anomalous and placed into storage. SCP-4773-1 was located in its containment chamber alongside the object, deceased due to dehydration -- cremation of the body is scheduled for 04-30, and decontamination of the chamber is ongoing\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++ Translations:\n**CN** - http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4773\n**JA** - http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-4773\n**DE** - http://scp-wiki-de.wikidot.com/scp-4773\n**RU** - http://scpfoundation.net/scp-4773\n**PL** - http://scp-wiki.net.pl/scp-4773\n**KO** - http://ko.scp-wiki.net/scp-4773\n**VN** - http://scp-vn.wikidot.com/scp-4773\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n« [[[SCP-4772]]] | SCP-4773-2 | [[[SCP-4774]]] »\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
