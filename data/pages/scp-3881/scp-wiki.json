No further containment procedures are necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3881 is a classic gold band style wedding ring with a few cosmetic alterations. When worn by a human being, SCP-3881 will immediately transport the wearer to an unknown location. Upon removal, the ring and the wearer will be returned to their previous position.\n\nThe location is a clearing in a forest containing a single thatched-roof house. The house is fully furnished, well maintained and shows signs of prior use. Clothing within the house presumably belonged to an adult male, shoe-size 10, with approximately five years of disuse.\n\nSCP-3881 was discovered within a pawn shop, being pawned by a Miss Pamela Smith.\n\n**Addendum A:**\n\n> [[=]]\n> +++ Interview Transcript\n> [[/=]]\n> **Interviewee:** Miss Pamela Smith\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Researcher ████\n>\n> ------\n> **<Begin Log>** \n> @@ @@\n> ████**:** For the record, name and occupation.\n> @@ @@\n> **Smith:** Pamela Smith, unemployed.\n> @@ @@\n> ████**:** Excellent, thank you.
