Skeptical to a fault, but that makes sense in the position.  Quietly fierce, protective of her agents, and inscrutable.

I amend my review: he is //intensely// unprofessional in every interaction.

It was cloudy outside, always fucking cloudy. The walls were covered in these artifacts—relics and paintings and diagrams, I don’t know. I didn’t get a good look at anything. His desk was this rich mahogany monstrosity, the kind with eighty drawers and sub-compartments, and on top is this white, almost crystal skull of some kind of sea animal. I got into 184 for a thesis on deep-sea crabs, but if I had to guess I’d say it was some kind of porpoise. Ivo pulled something out of the desk—a turquoise billiard ball—and set it gingerly down. He said I was to take five minutes before bed each night and stare into it, then I had to sleep right away. Make sure it’s the last thing I do every day. He gave me a number to call the following morning if I had the dream. He said I’d know the one.\n\nA thoroughly uncomfortable experience.

O5-1 insisted that he gut and clean all the fish we caught himself, and I was in no hurry to tell him otherwise.

I ended up questioning the last several years of my life: had I really been working for a secret non-government institution? Was the anamolous real? I became obsessed, drove my family and friends away, started breaking into buildings throughought Atlantic City, glancing over my shoulder every day expecting to see some shadowy figure stalking me; had they meant to amnesticize me and forgotten? Would they come back to finish the job?\n\nThis lasted for about a year. Then I realized I was still receiving bi-monthly payments from \"SCPF_333\" on my banking.
