Individual items vary in appearance and are modular in construction. Items are sentient and capable of independent motion.||\n||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n----\n||||||||~ Initial Report||\n||~ Author || Teodor Nordskov ||~ Date || February 08, 1979||\n||~ Interest||Low||~ Identifier||Lego MiniThinkers||\n||||||||Items were discovered after the sub rosa corporate takeover which was managed under orders from Mr. Carter. Upon review of the company's inventory, the items and their properties were discovered. Previously, Lego A/S had been automatically neutralizing the items via placement in large tubs of water for 1 hour and selling the unremarkable variant. Practice continues due to inexpensive bulk supply and the supplier's insistence on only providing the current version of the items. ||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| 8Y9D5/2X4H7/S89M2 ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n----\n||||||~ Tracking Information||\n||||||~ 8Y9D5/2X4H7/S89M2 ||\n||~ Owner ||~ Date ||~ Comments||\n|| Godtfred Kirk Christiansen || February 06, 1979 || Initial Discovery. ||\n|| Doctor Wondertainment || February 17, 1979 || Shipment of 10,000 items was received from an associate of Doctor Wondertainment.||\n|| Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. || November 08, 1979 || Item placed for sale in preparation for the Christmas spike.||\n|| Angelina Baar || December 19, 1979 || 200 items purchased.||\n|| Angelina Baar || May 05, 1980 || Attempted to return 198 items for monetary compensation.
