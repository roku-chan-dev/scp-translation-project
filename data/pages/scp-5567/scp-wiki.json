A label on the back cover claims it was distributed by a believed-to-be nonexistent \"East Blue Productions\"; investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe plot of SCP-5567 involves a detective named Toshiro Arikawa (SCP-5567-1) investigating a spike in missing person cases in the fictional seaside town of Michikomio, Japan. Although locals claim a yokai[[footnote]]Monsters, usually ghosts or demons in Japanese folklore.[[/footnote]]  is responsible, Toshiro remains skeptical. Every twenty-four-hours following the previous successful viewing of SCP-5567, the culprit of the disappearances changes, along with corresponding scenes and other details relating to the mystery.\n\n**Discovery of SCP-5567-1**\n\nSCP-5567-1 is an emergent awareness embedded in the character of Detective Arikawa, which developed upon repetitive viewing during preliminary Foundation testing.[[footnote]]As little is known of emergent awareness within the Foundation, study of SCP-5567-1 is considered to be higher priority than of SCP-5567.[[/footnote]]\n\nDuring testing, SCP-5567-1 gradually became aware of its status as a fictional character. Evidence of this included:\n\n* Dialogue by SCP-5567-1, considered unfitting to the scene\n* SCP-5567-1 appearing late to scenes\n* SCP-5567-1 not appearing in scenes\n* SCP-5567-1 responding to remarks made by Foundation personnel in the room[[footnote]]As SCP-5567-1 only understands Japanese, responses primarily consisted of confusion.[[/footnote]]\n* SCP-5567-1 failing to speak for extended periods of time\n\n\nTesting has revealed SCP-5567-1 is aware of when SCP-5567 is being watched, its place as a character in a direct to video anime, and the year SCP-5567 was supposedly created.[[footnote]]1985[[/footnote]] Additionally, testing has revealed that SCP-5567-1 is aware of previous iterations of itself, interactions with viewers, and plot resolutions.

After power was restored, it was discovered that substantial modifications had been made to SCP-5567, including the physical removal of a portion of the tape, which included the timestamp that the murders occurred within. It is unknown who, if anyone, is responsible for this vandalism. The emergent intelligence has been unaffected by the alteration.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Post Incident 19/12/2019**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nResearcher Fox put in for a transfer after the above incident, which was granted. Upon vacating his lodgings at the Site, the following correspondence was found.[[footnote]]Translated from Japanese.[[/footnote]]\n\n> Arikawa-San\n> \n> While I am sure you won’t get to read this, possibly some member of the research staff will take pity on me and read it to you. I won’t take too much of your time.\n> \n> I sincerely apologize to you. While I understand I violated your boundaries, at the time, I felt as if I was doing so for the right reasons. Please be assured that I am no longer a part of the research staff here, and you won't have to interact with me anymore. I am transferring because I feel I have lost my objective, and want to give you peace of mind.\n> \n> I hope someday you will come to forgive me.\n> \n> All my love,\n> \n> Daichi Fox\n\nUpon locating this correspondence, Dr. Apple requested a full enquiry be made into Researcher Fox’s behavior. The letter was not read to SCP-5567-1.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5566]]] | SCP-5567 | [[[SCP-5568]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** pic\n> **Name:** Umibe no Nazo\n> **Author:** Mew-ltiverse\n> **License:** cc-by-sa 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5567/Pic\n> **Derivative of:** https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:三浦海岸の日の出,_Sunrise_over_the_Uraga_waterway_-_panoramio.jpg\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
