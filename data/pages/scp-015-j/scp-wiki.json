It is hoped that SCP-015-J will be both capable of slithering and the flicking of the tongue. SCP-015-J is currently speculated to be just a baby, but this has not been confirmed. Direct consultation with Researcher Slug or other Foundation personnel connected with SCP-015-J has been restricted due to Agent Boyd being shy.\n\nAll details regarding SCP-015-J have been heard secondhand through overheard conversation, with details like \"long\" \"twirly\" and \"red\" occurring repeatedly along with references to SCP-015-J having imminent hunger needs. It is hoped that Researcher Slug will not be grossed out the first time that SCP-015-J does a big poop or eats a fuzzy mouse. Agent Boyd is available for reference in the event of such an occurrence, due to her years of experience in the field. \n\n//Cost-benefit analysis of lifting the ban on storing frozen mice in shared refrigeration spaces due to the presence of multiple animals utilizing said mice in their diets is ongoing. -- Agent Boyd//\n\n\n**Addendum:** \n[[collapsible show=\"Agent Boyd had moved to reclassify SCP-015-J as neutralized.\" hide=\"Additionally, is it possible to get stuff on a Foundation expense account refunded on short notice?\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[image collapsedimage]]\n\n\nSCP-015-J upon initial discovery.\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Anonymous]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
