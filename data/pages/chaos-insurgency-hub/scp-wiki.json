The Insurgency leadership was supported by research, security, and retrieval personnel, all taken from Foundation ranks.\n     \nTo the majority of the Foundation and the anomalous world, the Insurgency was a splinter group that went A.W.O.L. with several researchers and anomalous objects. In reality, the O5 Council had created the Insurgency to complete missions with ethically questionable methods and politically unsavory results--while keeping the Foundation's public reputation clean. For approximately twenty-four years, the Insurgency operated under the guise of Foundation defectors, using anomalous objects to secretly further the goals of the O5 Council.\n     \nIn 1948, as part of a seemingly routine staged operation, the Insurgency removed several SCP objects from Foundation containment and transported dozens of defecting Foundation researchers to various safe locations. That same day, multiple other unplanned raids of Foundation facilities occurred. The Insurgency seized SCP objects with great research and military potential and inflicted severe casualties to Foundation personnel. The Foundation's biggest lie had become a reality. Their covert black ops team had defected, and the Foundation faced a new threat from an organization now calling itself by a new name: the Chaos Insurgency.\n     \nThe O5 Council was stunned. The defection or even the slightest hint of disloyalty from Red Right Hand personnel had been unprecedented. The motives behind the Insurgency's betrayal remain unknown to the Foundation. All attempts to find, apprehend, or assassinate the defecting Insurgency operatives failed. This information is classified within the Foundation, which maintains that the Insurgency defected in 1924 and that the actual defections in 1948 were simply raids made by the already-existing splinter organization.\n     \nThe modern-day Chaos Insurgency bears some similarities to the organization that founded it. The Chaos Insurgency's Delta Command, shrouded in mystery, issues orders to the lower ranks. Gamma-class researchers and military commanders have oversight over the execution of the Delta Command's orders, while Beta-class personnel, while not given the same level of command as Gamma-class, carry out the Insurgency's work in the field. Alpha-class personnel, often recruited from individuals with little to no knowledge of the anomalous, accept offers of employment often because the alternative is to carry on a miserable existence outside the anomalous world. They are the grunt workers: numerous and expendable.\n     \nThe Insurgency is split into two divisions: military and R&D. Cells within both divisions work independently, unaware of the exact actions and goals of other cells. New recruits receive instructions from their superiors and are expected to follow them unquestioningly, not knowing that every action they take is part of a larger plan orchestrated by the Delta Command. They are told that they are carrying out a great rebellion against the anarchy of the status quo—a world where \"consensus reality\" itself is an illusion, history's great lie, perpetrated by the Foundation. They are told that they will use the anomalous to build a utopian future, where humanity is master of everything, not just a mirage.\n     \nBut really, who knows what the Chaos Insurgency actually wants?\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Collected Data]]\n++ Contest Tales\n\n* Darkness On the Face of the Deep\n * [[[gate-of-janus |Gate of Janus]]]\n * [[[asymptomatic-carrier |Asymptomatic Carrier]]]\n * [[[the-ant |The Ant]]]\n* [[[Polycephaly]]]\n* [[[cactus-insurgent |Cactus Insurgent]]]\n* [[[Headhunted]]]\n\n++ Object Documents\n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" order=\"created_at\"  tags=\"+_chaos-insurgency\" rating=\">-0\"  separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Further Research]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"ratingAsc\" tags=\"+scp +chaos-insurgency\" rating=\">-0\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Documented Accounts]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"ratingAsc\" tags=\"+tale +chaos-insurgency -goi2014\" rating=\">-0\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n\n**International Operations**\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/reunion-inexistante The meeting that never were]\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/jane Jane]\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/ghost-sign The Ghost Sign]\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/ventanas-a-otro-mundo Windows To Another World]\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-ru-178 SCP-RU-178 - The Heroes Of Vólorovsk] (ES Branch Regional SCP)\n* [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/the-plan-failed The Plan Failed]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Information]]\nWhen writing an object document for the Chaos Insurgency you have to keep in mind that unlike the Foundation, the Insurgency actively uses anomalous items. Due to the break down between cells and the differences in personnel class amongst the cells, Delta Command releases purely need-to-know documents. And all the Insurgency really needs to know is what to do with the anomalies, not what they are or their exact method of function.\n\nEssentially, a member of Delta Command codenamed the \"Engineer\" constantly transcribes a massive list of instructions (the \"Plan,\" and individual \"Steps\") without any immediate sense of correlation. Delta Command passes these instructions down to the bottom ranks of the Insurgency. The rest of Delta Command then scans and separates these Steps, and compiles relevant steps together in \"Step Compilation\" documents. \n\nSo those are the basics. Before you keep reading, you should probably read the \"Darkness on the Face of the Deep\" series. Just hop on over a couple of tabs and check it out. Because spoilers, or something. Also a lot of things won't, uh, make sense.\n\nLet's talk about the thematic foundation of these documents. The //point// of this portrayal of the Chaos Insurgency is that they're all getting absolutely played by the Engine. This \"object\" format is supposed to embody the inherent contradictions in the nature of the Chaos Insurgency. They're an organization that purports to have as its goal the perfect understanding and integration of the anomalous—but they don’t tell their operatives anything about these paranormal objects or phenomena. There is the //illusion// of order—they’re following a strict series of instructions. But the reality is chaos—the average Chaos Insurgency operative has //no idea// what they’re doing or why. They’re just following the Engine’s plan.\n\nOh, also, who’s the Engineer? A member of Delta Command who’s in constant telepathic conversation with the Engine, unceasingly transcribing the Engine’s will into the Plan. Basically a mouthpiece. The Engine is the real mastermind behind everything, but nobody but Delta Command is aware of the Engine’s existence or true nature. \n\nJust to close out, when approaching these documents, we think that it’s much more helpful for you, as a writer, not to think about an //object// you want to portray, but instead a //story// regarding that object, and even more specifically, //what the Chaos Insurgency wants to do with that object.// In order to portray exactly //what// the object is, you have to work around the knowledge blackout of the Insurgency to weave in implications, hints, or references to other parts of the Foundation universe. \n\n----\n\n+ Document Break-Down\n\n**DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** The DeCIRO (__De__lta __C__ommand __I__ntelligence __R__ecording __O__ffice) Catalogue Number is the Chaos Insurgency's basic equivalent of the Foundation's Item Number, except that it applies to all documents. \n\n**Document Type:** While \"Step Compilation\" will always been the Document Type at the top of the document, included sub-documents will have different Document Types. Sub-document information is detailed farther below.\n\n**Dates Received:** Pretty self explanatory. Using xx-xx-xxxx (month-day-year) as a template. (ex: 04-22-1955) Keep in mind these dates correlate with the DeCIRO number of the Steps Compilation document.\n\n**Operation Status:** If all the Steps on the document have been followed, and no further Steps are expected to be produced, the Operation Status is Closed. If the Insurgency is still following the Steps and/or it is suspected that more relevant Steps will be produced, the Operation Status is Open.\n\n**Foreword:** Delta Command is not exactly the most sane group of individuals. The Foreword is them essentially talking to themselves (as only they would ever see the Foreword), usually through colorful language or metaphors. Useful for cluing the reader onto exposition things you wouldn't be able to easily do within the Steps.\n\n**1. STEP _** This is where the fun starts. The Steps are what the Insurgency is actually going to do with the object(s) relevant to the document. As such, descriptions aren't all too common. Instead, the Step may call for research of a particular object and then the resulting documentation of the study would be attached.\n\n----\n\n+ Step Compilation Template\n\n[[code]]\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:right\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/chaos-insurgency-hub/CI%20Document.png width=\"310 px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** SC-[First Step]/[Last Step]\n\n**Document Type:** Step Compilation\n\n**Dates Received:** [Date of first Step] through [Date of last Step]\n\n**Operation Status:** Open/Closed\n\n**Foreword:** [Vague description of the object, the operation, and/or how Delta\nCommand feels about it.]\n\nHereafter we of Delta Command document the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.\n\n**1.
