In this regard, we can ensure that we always stay on top of rewrites, as an automated system can cause things to fall through the cracks.\n\nThe workbench consists of 4 sections:\n* Rewrite Listpages Module\n* Use Guide (You're looking at it!)\n* The In-Rewrite Tracker\n* Action Items List\n\n++ Rewrite Listpages Module\nThe Listpages Module displays all pages that are currently tagged 'in-rewrite'. They are sorted based on 'Last Updated At', which tracks when the last comment was left on the article. This isn't a perfect system, but generally that should be the comment that is left by the Rewrite Team Member, so the last authorized rewrite is generally at the top.\n\nWe use this as a reference tool, and to ensure that we can get easy visibility into all pages tagged in-rewrite.\n\n++ Use Guide\nSee this.\n\n++ In-Rewrite Tracker\nThis is the heart of the workbench, and the part that requires manual editing. The tracker lists all pages that are currently in rewrite, who is rewriting it, who is the point of contact, the status of the piece, and the date it is due/a check-in is to occur.\n\nWhen a new rewrite has been authorized, a rewrite team member should update the rewrite tracker with the information on the rewrite. The following section is a copy-paste version of the template used in the tracker:\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@@||[[[ArticleLink]]]|| Date Authorized || [[*user RewriteAuthor]] || [[*user RewritePointOfContact]] || CheckinDate || CurrentStatus||@@\n[[/div]]\n\nBreaking this down further, here are the definitions of each field:\n||~ Original Work || Hyperlink to the Article that is being rewritten. ||\n||~ Rewrite Authorization Date || This is the date that the rewrite was approved by Rewrite staff. The date should be formatted as DD Month YYYY, for example, 06 June 2024. ||\n||~ Rewrite Author || A linked @@[[*user Author]]@@ tag, to show at a glance who is working on the rewrite. In the event of it being collaborative, have one person listed as the primary contact for the rewrite. ||\n||~ Point of Contact|| The Rewrite Team Member who received the initial request for the rewrite. If a Rewrite Team Member is overloaded, they can delegate to another staff member to take over as point of contact, if both are agreed. The point of contact is responsible for updating and managing the tracker for that piece, as well as ensuring that the schedule is maintained. ||\n||~ Check-In Date || This is the date that a rewrite is due by, or in the case of a Harmony rewrite, the date where we check in on progress. The default check-in date is 90 days or 3 months after the authorization date. The date should be formatted as DD Month YYYY, for example, 05 August 2027. This field also utilizes a number of special tags, that can be found in the table below. ||\n||~ Status || This is the field that displays the current status of the rewrite. There are a number of different set statuses to choose from, and are listed in a table below. ||\n\n++++ Special Check-In Date Tags:\nTo aide with tracking more details, there are a number of special tags that can be applied before the check-in date. They are:\n||~ **HR** || Harmony Rewrite. These rewrites have no firm deadline, so instead, operate on a 90 day check-in system, to ensure the writer is still interested and working on the rewrite. There is no firm burden of proof, rather this just ensures that rewrites do not get stuck. ||\n||~ **EXT** || Extended Check-In. This is used when an official extension has been granted, to give visibility into why a check-in date is not 90 days after the authorization. When a work is given an extension, ensure you add this tag. ||\n\n++++ Status Field:\nThe status field uses a set of defined choices, to help with visibility into where in the process a rewrite is. They are:\n||~ In Rewrite || This is the initial status given to all rewrites. This signifies that the rewrite has been authorized, and the author is currently working on the piece. ||\n||~ Open For Review || This status is updated once the author has submitted a draft of the piece into review by the rewrite team. This tag should be updated once the Discord thread has been created. ||\n||~ In Revision || This status signifies that rewrite has reviewed a draft, and sent feedback to the author, when the rewrite has not been approved. This signifies that at least one round of feedback has occurred. ||\n||~ Pending Post || This status signifies that a rewrite has been approved by three rewrite team members, //but// the rewrite has not yet been posted on the wiki. This status should be temporary, and shouldn't last longer than a week, in general. ||\n||~ Unknown || This status is used when the current state of a rewrite is unknown. If this status is given for a rewrite, you **must** add it to the **Items Tagged 'in-rewrite' Needing Action** section. ||\n\n++ Items Tagged 'in-rewrite' Needing Action\nThis is a special section that is used for rewrites that have an {{unknown}} status - this section indicates that specific further action is required to determine the status of the rewrite. When adding to this section, use the following template:\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@@||[[[ArticleLink]]]|| Date Authorized || [[*user RewriteAuthor]] || Status || Notes || Last Updated||@@\n[[/div]]\n\nBreaking down each of the sections above:\n||~ Article Link || Same as the main tracker, this should link to the piece being rewritten. ||\n||~ Date Authorized || The initial authorization date, same as the main tracker. ||\n||~ Rewrite Author || The primary author in charge of the rewrite, same as the main tracker. ||\n||~ Status || This status field should be listed as Unknown, generally. Sometimes, if an article is tagged as {{Open for Review}} or {{Pending Posting}}, and has been that way for longer than 1-2 weeks, that item should be moved to this tracker, signifying that actions need to be taken on it. ||\n||~ Notes || In sentence format, describe the issue/what is unknown about the rewrite, effectively, the 'why' it is in the section. When adding an update to the notes, keep the old text, and in the next sentence, begin with **UPDATE:**. ||\n||~ Last Updated || This is the date when the last note was made by a member of the rewrite team. This should be formatted as DD Month YYYY, for example, 24 January 2022. ||\n\nAnd that's everything you need to know about this page!
