SCP-7062-A was an ink jar full of dried blood belonging to Dr. Becker. SCP-7062-B was Dr. Becker’s heart, functioning with no irregularities despite being completely disconnected from her body.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7062 was discovered post-neutralization on 08/09/1998 when Dr. Becker was found expired on her desk. After a standard sweep of her apartment, SCP-7062-A and SCP-7062-B were discovered on a personal desk, alongside several poems written in blood. A coroner's report found that the heart had suffered rapid takotsubo cardiomyopathy[[footnote]]A condition where the heart’s left ventricle becomes loosened as a result of stress[[/footnote]], resulting in the expiration of the researcher. Along with Dr. Becker’s corpse, a note in standard ink was found on the desk. A direct transcription can be found below.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[size larger]]Here I sit alone\nEverything is cold and dark\nStill waiting for you to phone\nYou were my spark\nNow tears stream down my face\nYour beauty reminded me of a dove\nI see shadows in your place\nNow I know the pain that comes with [[span style=\"color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 7px rgba(0,0,0,.5)\"]]love[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\nCharacters became increasingly illegible near the end of the note. Additionally, the final letters of the note were obscured due to the presence of lacrimal fluid.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\nCritters: [[*user Uncle Nicolini]], [[*user lordxvnv]], [[*user DrApricus]] [[*user elfLawyer]], [[*user Kish99]], [[*user SirSlash47]], [[*user ClownSlayer]], [[*user realsurrealsir]], [[*user Dr Trintavon]], [[*user UnnaHuz]], [[*user Swaxeman]], and [[*user Erminustay]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
