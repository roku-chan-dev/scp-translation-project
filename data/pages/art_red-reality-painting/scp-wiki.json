It holds a special place in my heart given the physical copy no longer exists, so it feels fitting for it to have its place on the wiki for others to enjoy. With SCP-3001 being a favorite of mine, it felt nice to create it and start my exploration of multi-media paintings. \n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** redreality.png\n> **Author:** [[*user EmotionalEntropy]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:red-reality-painting SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
