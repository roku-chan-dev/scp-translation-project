Any deceased individuals are to be transferred to Site-77 near Vatican City and imprisoned until they transform into SCP-6731-1 instances and burst. \n\nFollowing Addendum 6731.1 Bi-weekly rituals disguised as Catholic rites are to be performed by designated occult thaumaturge priests located in Site-777-B.[[footnote]]Vatican City.[[/footnote]]Any individual questioning these practices shall be given Class E amnestics and given a cover story about changing practices in Catholic faith.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6731 is a phenomenon affecting the outskirts of Vatican City that manifests itself after the Easter Vigil held by the Roman Catholic Church each Catholic Easter. The effects of SCP-6731 become apparent anywhere between two to five hours after Easter Vigil finishes with the Liturgy of the Eucharist[[footnote]] The liturgy of the Eucharist includes the offering and the presentation of bread and wine at the altar, their consecration by the priest during the eucharistic prayer (or canon of the mass), and the reception of the consecrated elements in Holy Communion.[[/footnote]], affecting an area roughly 60 kilometers in diameter.\n\nAny individuals who has passed away during the preceding Holy Week[[footnote]] Holy Week is the sixth and last week of Lent, beginning with Palm Sunday and concluding on Holy Saturday.[[/footnote]] in the affected area are resurrected through unknown means, with Cluster Formations (CFs)[[footnote]]Designated as SCP-6731-1.[[/footnote]] forming shortly afterward. SCP-6731-1 is comprised of a group of thirteen recently-deceased individuals, each claiming to be a biblical depiction of an Apostle of Jesus Christ, led by an individual taking on the appearance of Yeshua[[footnote]]Jesus Christ.[[/footnote]] which is designated as the Cluster Leader (CL)[[footnote]]Designated as SCP-6731-2.[[/footnote]] of the formation.\n\nSCP-6731-2 instances seem to have heightened sapience in comparison to SCP-6731-1 and possess rudimentary Kinetoglyphical[[footnote]]Kinetoglyphs, or kinetohazards, are physical and mental anomalous effects that occur when an entity performs specific motions and gestures.[[/footnote]] capabilities. SCP-6731-2 is able to use these abilities to perform basic miracles, similar to those found in Bible scripture performed by Yeshua.\n\nThe bodily features of each resurrected individual belonging to SCP-6731-1 grossly change over the course of three minutes following manifestation to approximately match the appearance of each biblical Apostle, ranging from the subject's facial structure reshaping through the changing of the mandible and nasal bone structures, to the rapid increase or decrease of the individuals' height to more closely match their designated Apostle. Any clothes or items on the individuals morph and combine into rough-sewn tunics. \n\nThe changes appearing in males are the least severe, with the most common effects being artificially altered heights, increased facial hair growth, and a change of pigmentation across the entire body.\n\nIf a member of an SCP-6731-1 instance is female, their features will change to better suit the biblical description of the designated Apostle: in most cases, the subject experiences sudden onset swelling of the larynx and vocal cords, heightened production of testosterone, and rapid hair growth around the jaw, chin, and lower lip. In some scenarios, the subject experiences a merging of the mammary glands with the thorax and abdomen regions; Any fat is dispersed around the deltoids, thorax and abdomen, forming a considerable gut in most cases, along with disproportionately sized arms.\n\nEach SCP-6731-1 instance exhibits relatively weak cognitohazardous properties, which are heavily amplified for people of Catholic belief, compelling them to stay near any SCP-6731-1 instance and worship them. \n\nAfter approximately one to three days of an SCP-6731-1 instance existing, the Cluster Leader of the formation will rise into the air before bursting into a flash of light. Individuals witnessing this event immediately begin transformation into SCP-6731-1 instances. \n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 6731.1\n+++ LOG BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND THE FOUNDATION\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\nUpon the first initial sighting of SCP-6731-1, MTF Eta-77 (\"Spheres Within Spheres\") was dispatched to the area near Vatican City to investigate the anomaly.

Vatican City has been assimilated into Foundation custody, with Pope Francis[[footnote]] Foundation agent Jorge Mario Bergoglio.[[/footnote]] being nominated as the new Pope.\n\nA news broadcast with built-in subliminal messaging containing Class Mystica Mnesticides on the topic of Rome has been sent to news stations across the world. The usage of pulverized Class E Amnestics has also been deployed in different parts of the world in which information about this phenomenon has potentially spread, alongside ground-based disinformation rallies.\n\nDue to the sudden changes in Vatican ideology and shift towards different, more ritualistic practices, several Abrahamic religious bodies have commented and critiqued the changes, with the Jehovah's Witnesses in particular calling out several \"Satanic rituals\" being employed in Vatican City, though disinformation campaigns along with forged Biblical scripture taken from the BAV[[footnote]]Vatican Apostolic Library.[[/footnote]] have temporarily quelled the concerns.\n\nAll subsequent manifestation events have been contained with no further escalation of conflict recorded to date, thanks to updated protocols and additional knowledge gained during the first manifestation event. SCP-6731-1 instances are to be apprehended immediately following a manifestation event, following containment procedures.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab @@ @@]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6730]]] | SCP-6731 | [[[SCP-6732]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** Jesus1.png\n> **Name:** Selva_Rasalingam_as_Jesus_in_the_The_Gospel_of_Luke_(2016).jpg\n> **Author:**  Jake Thomas \n> **License:** Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Selva_Rasalingam_as_Jesus_in_the_The_Gospel_of_Luke_(2016).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** 800px-Crowd_at_Knebworth_House_-_Rolling_Stones_1976.jpg\n> **Name:** Crowd_at_Knebworth_House_-_Rolling_Stones_1976.jpg\n> **Author:** Sérgio Valle Duarte\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crowd_at_Knebworth_House_-_Rolling_Stones_1976.jpg\n-----\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
