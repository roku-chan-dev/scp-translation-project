Tachyon bursts usually indicate significant alterations to consensus history (CK-Class reality restructuring scenarios). However, no immediate and obvious changes to history were observed; however, even state-of-the-art [[[SCP-3557|Foundation reality-monitoring apparatuses have known inadequacies.]]]\n\nThe purpose of the SCP-8008 investigation is to determine how, if at all, history has changed.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n+ Recovered Physical Evidence:\n\n[[div class=\"sepbox\"]]\n+++ SCP-8008-A: Ground Zero\n\nThe source of SCP-8008 has been triangulated to a private residence, designated SCP-8008-A.\n\nSCP-8008-A has interior dimensions larger than its exterior dimensions. It is zoned as a single-occupant residence in a building occupied primarily by workers in the tech industry, approximately 85% of whom are not in romantic relationships. (These characteristics do not apply to SCP-8008-B.)\n\nThere are approximately 500,000 corpses and an undetermined volume of protein slurry within SCP-8008-A. Of the corpses, 90% are recognizable as fully human and 9% appear to be parahuman or humanoid. The majority of intact corpses are wearing Foundation uniforms or equivalents from other organizations i.e. contemporary normalcy organizations (e.g. Global Occult Coalition) or known multiversal equivalents (e.g. Vanguard). \n\nMany of these individuals are alternative iterations of registered active Foundation personnel.

It is physiologically and genetically identical to currently-living renowned artificial intelligence risk researcher, fiction author, and American Twitter personality Eliezer Yudkowsky but possesses hypertrophied pectoral, abdominal, gluteal, and limb muscles. It is unclear whether SCP-8008-B transformed itself into the form of Eliezer Yudkowsky using its abilities or whether it retroactively altered reality so an alternate version of itself would attain the material success currently enjoyed by Eliezer Yudkowsky.\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky does not appear aware of the existence of SCP-8008. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sepbox\"]]\n+++ SCP-8008-C: Recovered Hardware\nSCP-8008-C is a non-functional computer that displays residual hallmarks of ontokinetic alteration. Analysis suggests SCP-8008-C's hard drive contains nearly-infinite storage capacity and that its CPU, if functional, would perform at extremely high speeds; however, it is believed that active ontokinetic manipulation is necessary to power SCP-8008-C. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=fractal2.jpg|align=right|caption=Electron Microscopy of SCP-8008-C. Note highly-irregular three-dimensional drive design.]]\n\nSCP-8008-C's hard drive is currently being investigated. It has two sections: a mundane, traditionally-structured portion constructed in accordance with established laws of computer engineering, and an ontokinetically transformed portion that requires extensive reverse-engineering in order to extract stored files and data.\n\nOf the current files recovered from traditionally-structured partitions of the hard drive, roughly 96% consist of pornography, 20% of which is Japanese cartoon pornography, colloquially known as \"hentai\". Further investigation of this media is on hold pending Ethics Committee review;[[footnote]]See //Cimmerian et al. 1996:// Factory Porn and the Casting Couch: Proper Controls in the Study of Anomalies with Sexual Aspects.[[/footnote]] however, while the primary storage directory was labeled \"C:/Users/ey/Desktop/Home work/Papers/Code Prototypes/Docs/Old Versions/New Folder\", suggesting a high desired degree of secrecy, an examined random sample is largely \"vanilla\", i.e. not containing a high level of taboo beyond that inherent to pornography. The remaining 4% consists of a mixture of personal files, all belonging to the individual physically resembling \"Eliezer Yudkowsky\", along with extensive documents authored by SCP-8008-B. These pre-SCP-8008 documents are primarily essays about SCP-8008-B's life philosophy with almost no fictional works, and have little to nothing in common with the works of baseline Eliezer Yudkowsky. \n\nThe remainder of recovered data is being extracted piecemeal from the exotic data storage structures of SCP-8008-C. A small portion of these logs appear to be produced by other individuals aware of the SCP-8008 event during its progression. These logs are primarily Foundation records. The rest are multimedia files, generally consisting of text or images. \n\nText files generally tend to be first person or third-person limited narratives from the perspective of SCP-8008-B. These narratives span over several thousand different settings with different premises and genres; however, common characters and themes recur throughout all recovered documents. Foundation personnel involved with the SCP-8008 event are recurring characters; SCP-8008-B and its worldviews are always major elements. A comprehensive narrative is still being constructed, as retrieval from SCP-8008-C is time-intensive and the retrieved data is not temporally linear. It is unclear whether these logs are accurate descriptions of the SCP-8008 event or if they are creative works produced by SCP-8008-B.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n+ Core Investigation Summary\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\nThe amount of data being recovered from SCP-8008-C is immense, measuring in the hundreds of yottabytes.[[footnote]]Equivalent to 1 trillion terabytes.[[/footnote]] To assist in the investigation, the Department of Sciences has engaged Foundation Artificial Intelligence Conscript HANAZONO.AIC to analyze the retrieved unstructured data and organize it into a human-readable form. \n\nCurrently, HANAZONO.AIC is classifying retrieved documents under 5 categories. Until HANAZONO.AIC completes its task, the exact organizational purpose of each category remains conjecture.\n* **\"Society\":** Alterations to society by SCP-8008, or the worldviews of SCP-8008-B;\n* **\"Science\":** Alterations to the fabric of reality by SCP-8008, or the intellectual interests of SCP-8008-B;\n* **\"Biology\":** Alterations to the human species by SCP-8008, or additional aspects of the worldview of SCP-8008-B;\n* **\"Want\":** Possible causes for the awakening of SCP-8008-B's abilities, or a psychological profile of SCP-8008-B;\n* **Foundation Response:** self-explanatory.\n\n[[=image hanazono.aic.png width=\"75px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ SCP-8008-1: \"Society\"\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[=image hanazono.aic.png width=\"75px\"]]\n\nRecovered documents from SCP-8008-C suggest that \"within/during\"[[footnote]]As SCP-8008 //may// have involved significant distortions to the fabric of spacetime, proximal and temporal language are used ambiguously.[[/footnote]] the SCP-8008 event, spacetime was highly compressed. SCP-8008-B may have trapped the entirety of the known multiverse within a form of reality at its whims. Alternatively, SCP-8008-B may have used alterations to spacetime in order to write extensive amounts of fictional works.\n\nEvidence is contradictory. If taken literally, files recovered from SCP-8008-C suggest that SCP-8008-B had the ability to completely rewrite spacetime, with unprecedented levels of temporal manipulation, ontokinetic, and matter reconfiguration abilities. However, the interpretation of recovered files as fictional works does not explain the presence of multiversal variants of Foundation temporal operators.\n\nFiles associated with SCP-8008-1 are believed to originate from the last 10% of elapsed time within SCP-8008, i.e. the 10% of the time experienced by entities within SCP-8008 closest to its disruption and the restoration of baseline reality.\n\n[[/div]]\n++ SCP-8008-1.01: Retrieved Communication\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n//2023-08-23 02:40 UTC//\n**To:** Alice Forth <aforth@SCiPNet.internal>\n**From:** Thaddeus Xyank <txyank@SCiPNet.internal>\n\n------\n\nYou're not going to believe this.\n\nYou //have// to come check this out.\n\n**I just had the most wonderful time.**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ SCP-8008-1.03: \"Eluthertopia\"\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n+++ Eluthertopia\n\n//As dictated by the First Citizen//[[footnote]]SCP-8008-B[[/footnote]]\n\n------\n\nEluthertopia, the greatest of the Free Cities of Nim Bii. In a continent ruined since the Fall of the Cathedral in the Great Burning 10,000 Cycles ago, the Free Cities stood as beacons of civilizations in a world with none.\n\nThese great cities were held together only by the power of their Benefactors -- good men of great merit and renown who chose, from the goodness of their hearts, to uphold society. They were as gods -- Pethriel the All-Seeing, Scalex of the Codex, and Elon and Zux and Bezeus who upheld their Cities through wealth alone. But greatest among them all is I, the First Citizen of Eluthertopia, Administrator of its Foundation, who bears the gift of Wisdom.\n\nMy power of Wisdom is even more powerful than what Pethriel possesses through the All-Seeing Stones. Pethriel must scry his stones to ascertain threats to his City, but my Wisdom allows me to infer threats that will occur from the slightest hints of influences, and act accordingly to cut them off before they even begin. \n\nNim Bii was a dangerous land. Ever since the Great Burning, civilization had been under constant threat from the shadow organization known as ΔT. Nobody knew who they were or what they wanted -- only that they hated everything that we had built. \n\nI watched the skies as we stood in the plaza before the Hall of Government. The white marble shone brilliantly in the dusk. My entourage stood behind me, nervously twisting in the wind. \n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=capitol.jpg |\ncaption=The Hall of Government. |\nalign=center |\nwidth=100%\n]]\n\n\n\"Administrator-sama, what is it?\" said my bodyguard, Alice. She was a very pretty cat woman, and she smiled at me.\n\n\"You idiot! Obviously his Wisdom let him know that an Incursion by ΔT is due to happen,\" said my secretary, Ilse. She was also a very pretty cat woman with cropped red hair and sharp blue eyes. __Of course, she felt the same way about me as I felt about her, but both of us were too shy to ever act on our feelings.__[[footnote]]Language similar to the underlined supports the hypothesis that recovered SCP-8008-C files include an automatic transcription of SCP-8008-B's thoughts.[[/footnote]] However, in an emergency, she would be more than happy to activate my true power.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said my administrative factotum, Thaddeus. He was one of the beast-folk, who had evolved in the wilds between the cities in the Decamillenium since the Great Burning, of one of the dog-tribes. We had fought when we had originally met, but now he was one of the most loyal people I knew. He had once had a magnificent mustache, but in the years since joining me he had lost the ability to grow one.\n\nHe checked [[[SCP-1780|his pocket watch.]]] \"In 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\"\n\nThere was a flash of violet light, and the enemy appeared.\n\nWe didn't know what these soldiers of ΔT truly were or where they truly came from, so we called them Demons. They were imposters, mimics, thieves. Whenever we encountered them, they wore the faces of our loved ones and yet were insistent on killing us. They might look different, might be human or elf or dwarf or goblin instead of being beastfolk, but always they stole our faces and tried to hurt us.\n\nOur enemies wore the features and faces of Ilse, Alice, and Thaddeus, though they were different species. False!Thaddeus was a human, and I only knew who it was for it had the mustache that True!Thaddeus could no longer wear.  \n\nFalse!Ilse was a reindeer woman, though its eyes remained blue. It also mimicked her signature battle garb, which displayed the 16 ribbons of each of her PhDs. \n\nFalse!Alice was a dingo -- no, more accurately it was a jackal. There was none of the warmth that the true Alice had towards me in its eyes.\n\n\"--Wolves and jackals are related, aren't they, Thaddeus?\" \n\n\"I have been neutered, Administrator-sama. You did the act yourself.\"\n\n\"Shit,\" said False!Ilse. \"We weren't fast enough.\"\n\n\"It's no matter, let's get ready to fight! To defend our home!\" said Ilse. Thaddeus took the wolf-stance of martial arts, and Ilse and Alice drew their SNEER[[footnote]]Sequence Node Extending Execution Radix[[/footnote]] clubs, a potent weapon of my own invention.\n\nThey looked at us with surprise. It is often common for Demons to underestimate the benefactors of the cities. While they had \"guns\", exotic weapons that used fire magic to propel bullets at lethal speeds, I had worked to counter them. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=not-ilse.jpg|width=300px|caption=A past \"False!Ilse\".]]\n\nThey fired their guns, a rapid barrage of thunderclaps.\n\n\"Administrator-sama!\" Ilse and Alice both cried, as they jumped into the path of the projectiles. The bullets clattered uselessly against the [[[SCP-8814|Chesterton Fields of their SNEER clubs]]], though their nervous charge to defend me perturbed their voluptuous chests. Thaddeus had no fear, and charged ruthlessly through the hail of bullets. He jumped upon the demon that mimicked him, tearing out its throat.\n\nThe other two demons screamed and fired bullets into Thaddeus's back, but to no avail. He shrugged them off. I thanked my foresight in splicing Thaddeus with unicorn DNA to grant him enhanced durability and regeneration. (This was also why it was necessary to neuter him so that his masculine Yang force would not react negatively with the purity essence of the unicorn.) He jumped off of false!Thaddeus's corpse, and lunged at False!Alice. It fought back with its own claws, but he was much stronger and much more suited for paw-to-paw combat. It, too, died.\n\nThe False!Ilse swore again and slapped at its wrist. It vanished in another burst of violet light.\n\n\"Drat, mine got away!\" said Ilse. \"Administrator-sama, do you know where it went or when it's coming back?\"\n\n\"Now who doesn't know what they're talking about?\" Alice said. \"There are some things that -- oh, I'm so sorry, Administrator-sama!\"\n\nI released a sigh of tension. \"It's alright, Alice.\"\n\nThe truth was that ΔT had long been a thorn in my side, and would do anything to bring down the perfect society I inhabited. I could stop their agents whenever they dared to show themselves before me, and yet I did not know where they came from or where they tried to escape to. I could not tear out the root -- the only evil remaining in this perfect society.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ SCP-8008-1.13: SCP-001\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ΔT Orientation\n\nFixed Point ΔT.001 \n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n//APPROVED BY://\n//ILSE REYNDERS 1, ADMINISTRATOR//\n//ALICE FORTH 6213, ETHICS COMMITTEE HEAD//\n//THADDEUS XYANK 809, RECORDS ARCHIVAL INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION HEAD//\n\n------\n\n**Item #:** SCP-001\n\n**Object Class:** Uncontained-Megiddo[[footnote]]Anomaly has already ended the world.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-001 is the temporal funnel trap that encompasses the entire observable multiverse. When traveling through time, regardless of multiversal or temporal origin, all time travelers will invariably encounter SCP-001. Once time travelers enter SCP-001, they can no longer escape. SCP-001 is also populated by the entirety of humanity, most of which is unaware of the current altered state of reality.\n\n[[[SCP-3091|Other examples of temporal funnel traps]]] known to the Foundation are believed to have been deliberately-created to prevent disruption of the present by parachronological material;  SCP-001 is qualitatively and quantitatively different, as it is a natural occurrence. \n\nWithin SCP-001, the only non-SCP-001 history that meaningfully exists is that which leads to 18:43 PST August 23rd, 2023 of Timeline-001-ΑΩ. While this designation breaks from standard timeline naming practice, from the perspective of SCP-001, Timeline-001-ΑΩ //is the only past that exists.// Traveling to any point in the past of Timeline-001-ΑΩ allows access to divergent timestreams; however, currently all invariably converge to the present of SCP-001. Travel to the past of Timeline-001-ΑΩ is currently recommended solely for salvage of objects that cannot be obtained within SCP-001.\n\nTravel to the future of Timeline-001-ΑΩ is not possible. To all traditional observational mechanisms, the future of Timeline-001-ΑΩ does not exist. Time progresses in Timeline-001-ΑΩ in direct proportion to the time progressed by SCP-001-1.\n\nThe \"present\" of SCP-001 is trapped within an iterative temporal loop. In intervals of twenty to eighty years, the entire observable universe will be reconfigured in response to the actions and stimuli experienced by SCP-001-1 in the \"current\" iteration. Nomenclature has not been formalized: personnel most commonly refer to the periods between these reconfigurations as \"world cycles\", \"reboots\", or \"kalpas\". This reconfiguration may be absolute; the entirety of the world can and has been reordered by the whims of SCP-001-1. No method of preventing this reconfiguration has been determined.\n\nSCP-001-1 is a humanoid entity, the upper limit of whose anomalous capabilities are currently unknown. Known capabilities include heightened senses, ontokinesis (\"reality warping\"), and temporal manipulation. SCP-001-1 has survived every assassination attempt executed by ΔT.\n\nΔT (\"Delta-T\") is the Foundation Department responsible for containing and reversing SCP-001. It is formed primarily of Foundation personnel from other timelines trapped within SCP-001, including members of Research and Containment Team Δt and the Temporal Anomalies Department, though members of other groups with temporal transit capabilities (e.g. the [[[golden-horde-blues|Golden Horde]]]) have also joined in the interest of eliminating SCP-001. ΔT is located in Fixed Point ΔT.001, an isolated temporal pocket that tracks the \"present\" of SCP-001 with a passage of time at a 1:1 ratio via Xyank/Anastasakos Constant Temporal Sink (XACTS).\n\nNo attempts to alter the past of SCP-001 from Fixed Point ΔT.001 have been successful.

We could make not just a great society -- but a perfect one.\n\nThis is how I use my Wisdom for the greatest benefit of the the Free City of Eluthertopia.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=paris.jpg|\ncaption=The Beautiful Streets of Eluthertopia. |\nalign=center |\nwidth=100%\n]]\n\nThese fond memories were on my mind as I walked with Thaddeus, Ilse, and Alice through Eluthertopia. While other Benefactors like Pethriel may have been satisfied with using their magical artifacts to maintain the order of their Free Cities, I liked to go out and get my hands dirty. Merely accompanying me gave Thaddeus, Ilse, and Alice significant boosts to their ESAS (Elutherian Social Assessment Scores), and the three of them were near the maximum value, with Thaddeus at 970, Ilse at 981, and Alice at 943. \n\nI smiled and waved as I walked through the streets of Eluthertopia. Those who smiled and waved back received +1 to their ESAS for contributing to the eudaemonic atmosphere, while I made a note to investigate any who frowned or glared. It was possible they were just having a bad day, but it was also possible that they had designs against me or their fellow citizens. It was better to be safe than sorry, and the mere fact that they were targets of investigation counted as -50 to their ESAS. \n\nThere were hundreds of other micro-expressions that my Wisdom incorporated; the presence of alcohol on their breath, the presence of their body odor, how harshly their voices rang through the market square. All for the greater good. My Wisdom worked in the background, passively maintaining society as I enjoyed the fresh air.\n\nThere was a SNAP in the back of my brain. I stopped walking, and Thaddeus, Ilse, and Alice stopped and watched me with concern. Someone's ESAS had gone negative.\n\n\"Administrator-sama?\" Ilse asked.\n\n\"We have a Breach,\" I said. Silently, Ilse and Alice drew their SNEER clubs. +5 ESAS points for vigilance.\n\nI crept towards a dim alleyway cutting off from the street, and signaled to my entourage to stay back. They seemed upset, but they obeyed me, which earned them +5 ESAS points for obedience.\n\nThere was a disheveled boy sitting in the alleyway, sobbing into his arms. -1 point per sob.\n\n\"What's wrong? How might I help you?\" I said. I was the Benefactor of Eluthertopia, the First Citizen, and the Administrator of its Foundation besides. No one should cry in my city.\n\nThe boy looked up at me. His eyes darkened. \"You! You're the tyrant (-50 ESAS for slander)! You killed my parents (-50 ESAS for false accusation)! This is all your fault (-50 ESAS for blame) (+10 ESAS for respecting power)!\"\n\nHe ineffectually stumbled towards me in rage and hunger, and raised his fists as if to strike me (-5000 ESAS).  I caught his weak, starved hands easily. \n\nI examined him. His parents had been soldiers who'd fallen in battle against the forces of another Free City to secure land that, in 500 years, would be a fruitful source of crude oil. The technology of this world had not yet advanced to the point where crude oil could be refined, but their sacrifices had not been in vain. Nevertheless, the ESAS he'd earned by being born to loyal citizens had been annihilated by his cursing my existence under his breath and his assault on my person. At over -5000 ESAS, there was no hope he would ever become a positive-ranked citizen ever again.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=oil.JPG |\ncaption=Oil. |\nalign=center |\nwidth=100%\n]]\n\nIt was possible he could be redeemed and become a productive citizen, but I looked into his future with my Wisdom. I saw fire. My city burning. The contents of my skull scattered into the wind. I stumbled back, shocked. Horrified.\n\nI grabbed him by the collar and dragged him into the light. \"This one has breached.\"\n\nThaddeus made to grab him.\n\n\"No. I'll handle him myself. His life is forfeit to the Harvest.\"\n\nMy entourage nodded gravely. They knew that for making the sacrifices necessary to maintain Eluthertopia, I was to take full responsibility. \n\n\"I still shudder whenever you do this,\" Alice said, batting her eyelashes at me. \"Why must you dirty your hands so?\"\n\nI adjusted her ESAS downward by 5 points for questioning me, but 10 points upward for doing it out of love.\n\n\"The beauty of this world is no coincidence. This is a perfect world. My perfect world, with my grand design. Every inch built with my blood, sweat and tears, and so it is my responsibility to maintain it.\"\n\n\"But why does it take this? Why must you sully your hands and your spirit with the Extraction of this soul?\"\n\n\"Because his life, to my Wisdom, was not just worthless, but less than worthless. An active detriment to our perfect world. He would have destabilized it, created a ripple just small enough to risk turning into a wave that would crest over everything we've built -- and wash it away. His life, you see, is nothing. I'll spare you the truth about his destiny, but he would have ended a hundred thousands lives if he lived to adulthood.\"\n\n\"Now, however, he will be useful. Through his suffering, I will extract enough mana to cast a powerful working, one that will reduce the suffering of good men for a thousand years. For a thousand years hence, no one in the Free City of Eleuthertopia will ever stub their big toes of their right foot -- all thanks to his contribution.\"\n\n\"That trade, in my eyes, is worth it.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ Excerpt: Global Occult Coalition PHYSICS Division Field Manual 13: Special Circumstances, Humanoid Threat Entities\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Notice: This is an [[[goc-supplemental-humanoid-guide|EXTERNAL document.]]] It is included here as an example of generally-accepted anomaly management precepts; however, consult the Foundation [[[decom-dept-hub|Decommissioning Department]]] before seeking permission to terminate an anomaly.**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/goc-hub-page/GOC-Logo-v4.png/medium.jpg width=\"100px\"]]\n\n------\n\n**PHASE 4: The Child-God:** Sadly, the majority of Type Greens will eventually progress to Phase 4.

This phase is marked by reduced empathy for other humans, inability to accept personal faults, and increased megalomania.\n\nAlthough warning signs are numerous, the key aspect of a Phase 4 is the use of their abilities to manipulate other humans. Teenage and young adult Type Greens will typically use their abilities for sexual purposes, while children will attempt to make strangers their \"friends.\" Older adults may attempt to manipulate others for love or financial gain. Although a few cases have resulted where the Type Green then reverts to Phase 3, 99% of them will remain at Phase 4 until eliminated. For this reason, Phase 4 Type Greens should be considered Threat Level 5 (Immediate Threat) and eliminated immediately, as they represent a major threat to all aspects of the Fivefold Mission.\n\n{{COSMIC TOP SECRET -- DECLASSIFIED IN EVENT OF POST-PIZZICATO RECONSTRUCTION PER [[[redtape |HOUSE ACCORDS]]]}}\n**PHASE 5: Unknown:** There are no known Phase 5 Type Greens.

As an orphan, he had been found by the Sisters of Erudite Nox. Erudite Nox was the most primeval and traditional aspect of Inanna-Gaea-Mary, the Goddess that blessed the Kingdom of Metegian.[[footnote]]Old English equivalent of \"regulation\". [[/footnote]]\n\nHenry was not like others, for he had a secret. He had lived through many, many lives, and so he was far wiser beyond his years. In the earliest life he could remember, he had lived on a planet called Earth, where the science was far more advanced than the Kingdom of Metegian. On Earth, there was sanitation like indoor plumbing, the ability to refine crude oil, mayonnaise, and machines that could almost think. Earth had also discovered the deepest secrets of the universe: that of quantum physics.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Metegian, magic fulfilled the role that science did on Earth. It powered things like hyperloops and the internet, so it was essential that every person knew it, just as it was essential for all Earthlings to know how to code. However, just like evil programmers could become hackers and cause great evils like Stuxnet or the heist of Mt Gox, evil magic users could destroy society as well. For this reason the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei had been founded, to prevent the proliferation of evil magic. Legally, any common citizen who wished to use magic had to go through 20 years of schooling with Woke Dei. Those who did not adhere to orthodoxy were cast out as criminals, for they tampered with powers that could destroy the world.\n\nSo unfortunately, despite his millennia of wisdom, Henry had to go to school, under the Ivory Tower of the Woke Dei. He was far better at learning things on his own, without the rigid structure and social conditioning of Woke Dei.\n\n------\n\n\"So, how was the first day of school?\" said Sister Alice, as Henry lay in her lap. Alice was one of the Sisters of Erudite Nox.\n\n\"Simply mind-numbing, as it has been for the past fifteen years,\" Henry replied tersely. \"They reiterated the Metegian system //again//.\"\n\nThe Metegian Standard Magic System was simple: All things in the world were composed of mana. Mana could be divided into three colors -- red, green, and blue. Each mana could furthermore be tuned to six Charges-- Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top, and Bottom. This magic system just so happened to follow the rules of quantum physics from Henry's past life. \n\n\n[[=image quark.png]]\n\n\"Aw, again? But you've always known it. You picked it up so fast right after we found you. If only you could have learned from us forever,\" said Alice.\n\nAll magic was said to come from the Goddess, and so her priestesses were among the most powerful in the land who were not the Scholars of Woke Dei. While the Sisters of Erudite Nox were considered the clergy, and so not subject to the schooling system of the Woke Dei, young boys were almost never adopted by the nunneries, and so he, Henry, was just a common citizen. Despite his brilliance of many lifetimes, he had to go through a repressive, factory-like schooling system. \n\n\nAlice stroked his hair. \"You're such a bright boy, Henry,\" Alice cooed. \"My bright and beautiful boy. You just have to be strong, just a bit longer. What did you daydream about in class?\"\n\nAlice was Henry's favorite of the Sisters of Erudite Nox. They were the holiest women in Metegian, even among the priestesses of Inanna-Gaea-Mary. The Sisters had been blessed with one of the rarest gifts of the goddess -- the gifts of all three of her Aspects. The ##blue|Blue of Inanna, Queen of Heaven##; the ##green|Green of Gaea, Midwife of Earth##; the ##red|Red of Mary, Mother of Blood.## Together, when the lights of red, green, and blue came together, they made the White of the Goddess. \n\n[[=image color.png]]\n\n\"I was thinking about time again,\" Henry said. He liked Alice's questions. They were never too hard for him to answer. He was preparing to enter a long speech when Alice groaned, cutting him off.\n\nNormal women, and indeed most of the clergy, could only channel the White of the Goddess rarely, after childbirth. But the Sisters of Erudite Nox were so blessed that their breasts were always engorged with Her White as part of their holy burden. The White of the Goddess was prized by mages as a powerful potion to restore their strength, but even they could only sell so much of it, to the point where it hurt them to carry the excess. For that reason Henry had been raised on the excess ever since he had been found, and it had made him a very powerful wizard, beyond on his knowledge.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Henry. It seems I... I failed to channel enough this morning. Would you care to... help me?\"\n\n\"It's the least I can do for you, Sister Alice. After all you've done for me.\"\n\nSister Alice pulled up her tunic, revealing her breasts. They were engorged and veiny, blue and green tapering to a perky red point. Henry knew she must be hurting from channeling so much of the Goddess's power, and his heart yearned to relieve her. So he contented himself with silently relieving Alice's burdens -- though she emitted great cries of relief -- and thought over his day's revelation:\n\nThe Ivory Tower of Woke Dei, fundamentally, was holding back the true potential of magic; that, he had always known. They taught that all magic came from the goddess, and from his place at Sister Alice's side, he certainly understood why the primitive codifiers of magic might have believed that. But all the magic of the Goddess, the only magic that the Ivory Tower taught, was magic of creation, which had been integrated into all of society's infrastructure. Magic with the power to destroy -- that was the domain of renegades and exiles and criminals. Anti-Magic, the evil opposite of creation magic, came from the Scarlet King. \n\nThat was the lie. \n\nHenry could see through it to the truth.\n\nThe magic of Metegian was rooted in quantum chromodynamics. Magic, clearly, worked by manipulating the world on the quantum level using the power of thought -- an ability of all humans -- but with coordinated probabilistic macroscopic manifestations through ritualism. Metaphorically, it was like sending requests to an online storefront. You asked the storefront -- magic -- what to do using search terms and money  -- incantations and mana-- and it responded by sending you a product -- the results of your spell.\n\nSister Alice's breath grew faster and faster. She caressed him closer and pulled her tunic out of the way so she could meet his eyes. Even as their eyes met, thoughts raced through his head. \n\nThe Ivory Tower of Woke Dei was emasculating the population by preventing them from accessing half of the store -- the dominating and masculine magic of the Scarlet King. It was like restricting the free market and stifling innovation. In fact, the schooling system was meant to stamp out curiosity and completely remove even the possibility of imagining how to access the Scarlet King's Anti-Magic. \n\nBut Henry had a very good guess. Henry knew from quantum physics that if matter went backwards in time, it became antimatter. If antimatter and normal matter met, they annihilated in a spectacular and destructive burst of energy. Therefore, the Anti-Magic of the Scarlet King was nothing more than the creation magic of the Goddess, but sent backwards in time -- a message from the future trying to reach the distant past.\n\n[[=image qcd.png]]\n\nThe White of the Goddess flowed freely from Sister Alice into Henry's mouth. He could feel the Goddess's mana flowing into his body and through his soul. Her holy power streamed into him as Sister Alice made great moans of relief. His body felt warm, and still harder and harder he accepted her gift. There was something there, wasn't there? The Scarlet King's power was the same as Inanna-Gaea-Mary's but from the future into the past. A reversal of the arrow of time. He was so close. He was so, so close.\n\nSister Alice let out a scream that suddenly hung in the air. Henry realized he had entered a trance. A great relief hung over him. It was as if time was standing still. And he remembered a gift from his previous life. \n\nThe power of time.[[footnote]]Narrative does not explain origin or nature of this power beyond stating that it is from a previous life.[[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ From //The Navigator's Handbook//, Delta-T internal publication\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n++++ \"Altered Origin\"\n\n------\n\n\"Altered Origin\" is a common problem for time travelers and multiverse travelers (further abbreviated travelers for brevity). The travelers' instruments often contain some navigation or coordinate system. They arrive at a place that their instruments tell them share the coordinates of their home multitemporalocale with reasonable variation. However, their supposed home is radically different from what they remember. How does the traveler distinguish between an ongoing CK-Class Restructuring scenario, butterfly effects from their own actions, non-anomalous transformations of society, or instrument error?\n\n------\n\nThe nature of worship, religion, and godhood cannot be used as reliable tentpoles for multiversal and temporal navigation or as proof of an active CK-Class Restructuring Scenario or HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario (as opposed to having been passively affected by the butterfly effect from actions in the distant past). In short, human belief is fragile, and human society shifts in accordance.\n\n\n**Deific Entities, Apex Tier Pluripotent Entities**\n\nThe question of what makes a \"god\" remains a matter of debate among Foundation theologians, as the boundaries between a god, a reality warper, and other entities such as an egregore are liquid and culturally dependent. For example, the Irish Saint Brigid of Kildare shares a beyond coincidental number of traits and domains with the pagan goddess Brigid. The shifting status and presentation of the gods is not proof that some outside force has elevated or reduced them. The presence of \"the gods\" in daily life should only be viewed as proof of an adversely altered timeline if there is evidence of an ongoing HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario.\n\n**Multiversal Entities**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=scarletking.jpg|width=300px|caption=The \"Scarlet King\"]]\n\n\nAcross domain of all possibility, the Scarlet King's recorded forms have included:\n\n* [[[SCP-231|A thinly veiled analogue of the American pop cultural understanding of Satan;]]]\n* [[[dust-and-blood|A cancer eating at the multiverse;]]]\n* [[[SCP-6747|An emergent pattern arising from the arrangement of 7 ritual objects;]]]\n* [[[tuftos proposal|The howling of the present as it longs for the past.]]]\n//All// of these are the Scarlet King. They may even be the //same// Scarlet King. Therefore, travelers commonly mistakenly assume that an unfamiliar manifestation of the Scarlet King is evidence that they are in a different timeline.\n\nThis is not so. The Scarlet King is an idea and a god and a pattern, but it is also multiversal in a way that other gods are not. One form of a multiversal entity in a timeline does not preclude alternate manifestations of that multiversal force in the same timeline.\n\n**Psychological archetypes**[[footnote]]This subsection will be undergoing sensitivity review in the next edition of //The Navigator's Handbook//.[[/footnote]]\n\nSome fixations arise from deep within the human psyche. The most infamous manifestations of these fixations are the various fetish objects classed as [[[SCP-597]]]. Across the multiverse, SCP-597 most often manifests as a blob of flesh with thousands of teats, heavily associated with the psychological and conceptual perception of \"motherhood\". \n\nIt is unknown if the various objects classed as SCP-597 are the same anomaly. However, a statistical analysis has shown a significant likelihood that SCP-597 is intrinsically tied to the conceptual matrix of motherhood. In universes with less historical misogyny i.e. those ruled by the matriarchal Daeva, SCP-597 analogues possess greater agency and many instances are fully sentient. Yet in most universes where the predominant society descends from Mesopotamian agriculture, SCP-597 is an unthinking lump of flesh.\n\nThe presence or popular knowledge of an entity like SCP-597 does not suggest a total alteration of reality, but could merely suggest a containment failure on part of the local normalcy enforcement organization. A different form of SCP-597 might also suggest that attitudes towards mothers in society have shifted. //In situ// observation can support or disprove this possibility.\n\n----\n\nIf: reality has been altered in the following ways //simultaneously://\n* Prominent worship, but not presence of gods that already existed but have fallen out of favor;\n* Mainstream worship of a multiversal entity\n* Mainstream worship of an archetype of the human psyche\nThen: the evidence is highly in favor that reality is being actively modified by an ontokinetic and its psychological hangups, but that the multiverse's natural ontological inertia is resisting highly drastic changes, allowing influence of multiversal entities upon the affected timeline.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ SCP-8008-2.72: \"The Schema of Syllogism, Chapter 65: For Love of Magic\"\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]Chapter 65:[[/size]]\n[[size 120%]]For Love of Magic[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\nThe villainous mafia known as DeiT (pronounced \"Deity\") was an atheist cult. They hated magic and society, and so would use Anti-Magic to destroy vital infrastructure like toll roads and also kill people. That was the party line of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei, and the masses ate it all up now that DeiT had announced that they would stop at nothing to topple the Ivory Tower and everything it stood for.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=pisa.jpg\n|width=300px|caption=The Ivory Tower of Woke Dei.]]\n\nThis was not enough to stop the Ivory Tower from holding its annual graduation ceremony. They were obsessed with signaling their power, which infuriated Henry. Of course they would place their best and brightest's lives on the line, just to prove that they didn't care. But if there was even a thousandths of a thousandths chance that something bad //would// happen, costing them an entire generation of the most brilliant young minds to grace the world, then holding a public event as a //taunt// was a //terrible idea.//\n\nThey would regret giving him the chance to speak, even though it was his right as top of the class. Never mind that the real challenge hadn't been doing well in the sanitized classes of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei, but making sure that his true experiments never got him noticed and exiled -- or worse, expelled. \n\nHis longtime rival, Ilse Reynders, scowled at him. [[[SCP-5616|She was the kind of girl to get 16 degrees of higher learning]]] just to have more letters after her name. He could respect that kind of discipline to some extent, but it also struck him as arduously pointless. His was a mind that idled until it sprinted; it was far better to think well and be sharp than to study simply for the sake of credentials. And his method had paid off. He was at the top of class, despite spending so much time slacking off and thinking, while she was at a distant second. \n\nShe was too loyal to her coursework, too willing to believe the teachings of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei. The Ivory Tower told obvious lies like \"men and women are magically equivalent\". Henry knew that was untrue simply from the gifts that Sister Alice granted him daily -- women, obviously, were able to channel the power of the Goddess in a way that men were not.  But the grand design of Woke Dei was to make unquestioning drones, not curious thinkers.\n\nA terrible thing happened to zealots, Henry tended to feel. It was easy to be sucked into patterns of thought and behavior that became dogma and then truth, increasing spirals of incorrectitude that became utterly unassailable. This was how all cults, political parties, and well-meaning movements worked. They started off as something reasonable, with practical goals -- prevent the destruction of society from the Scarlet King's Anti-Magic, in the case of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei, but slowly, along the line, that original goal got corrupted. Eventually, the practical goal of preventing the destruction of society was lost, and now the Ivory Tower was more concerned with maintaining the //perception// that it was useful and enforcing purity tests on everyone who wished to engage with it on a practical level of society.\n\n------\n\nThe ceremony dragged on, all of the professors saying the usual expected things -- generic well wishes for students, and the usual lies about how each and every one of them had changed their lives -- until it was finally Henry's turn to speak. Finally, he could set his fellow students free. Finally, he could start to change the world. Finally, he could start fighting the Ivory Tower.\n\nThere was an explosion.\n\nFrom the smoke, a slender woman appeared. Though she was lithe, she was also quite shapely, and though she glared at him with murderous intent in her eyes, Henry couldn't help but appreciate her great beauty.\n\n\"A DeiT agent!\" Ilse cried. \"Everyone, run!\"\n\n\"God, Reynders, what has he done to you?\" said the DeiT agent. \"It's me. Penelope. Penelope Panagiotopolous. 'Pataphysics.\"\n\n\"Get away from me!\" cried Ilse girlishly. \n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" said Penelope. \"So he's sunk his claws into you, hasn't he.\"\n\nIf Henry had one flaw, it would have been that he thought too much, but he viewed it as a necessary part of experiencing life to the fullest. He could dwell for hours to years on the exact nuances of a social interaction, deciphering exactly what everyone meant with the slightest turn of a phrase, the precise connotation conveyed by a microexpression and the delay of a release of breath. He had the advantage of a unique and singular power of time, which let him focus on these moments until he knew for certain what other people were thinking or doing at any given moment. With all of this time, he could achieve omniscience. Certitude. [[[SCP-5920|Through this repetitive and cyclic meditation, the contents of his mind had become far beyond the comprehension of any lesser beings.]]]\n\n\n\"What awfully convenient timing,\" Henry said. \"Right as I'm about to speak, a DeiT agent appears. And, right in the heart of the Ivory Tower, the base of your supposed enemy... It's clear what's going on. You've been in the employ of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei all along. I should've known -- even from the names. Woke Dei, DeiT... it's so obvious in retrospect.\"\n\n\"What the fuck? No, you're just delusional,\" said the woman. \"You really made up a group just to oppress you and now think anyone else who thinks you're a fucking psychopath is acting on their behest. This has to end.\"\n\n\"The only one with a fucked up worldview is you,\" Henry said. \"It's nothing personal, kid.\"\n\nThe magic of the Goddess was known as \"creation\" magic. The anti-magic of the Scarlet King was also known as \"destruction\" magic, because it permanently erased matter from reality, the greatest of taboos. Of course, Henry knew about Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^^2^^: Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Energy and matter were equivalent. All the Scarlet King's \"destruction\" magic did was convert solid matter into pure, wild energy -- another way that the teachings of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei were utterly and totally wrong.\n\n[[=image einstein.jpg]]\n\nNevertheless, due to the hegemony of the Ivory Tower, all combat magic was focused primarily on creating projectiles using mana -- water and wind from the blue mana of Inanna, plant life from the green mana of Gaea, and animal parts from the red mana of Mary. Most people could only use one type of mana well, but Henry was an exception. Due to being raised on the White of the Goddess, he was a master of all three mana colors, which gave him an unmatched edge in combat by letting him use all the spells of the Goddess.\n\n\"##red|Mary's Red: Lambce of God!##\" he shouted. An array of pikes, each of which had a bleating sheep's head on the tip, appeared before him in the air, before darting their way towards the DeiT agent.\n\nBut the DeiT agent had vanished. Harry felt a tiny pinprick of light on his skin and cast ##blue|Inanna's Blue: Great Ice Wall## to direct the incoming laser beam skyward. It blasted through the walls of the Ivory Tower of Woke Dei. Wreckage rained down, and the other students scrambled to safety.\n\n\"We've been watching you. I absolutely refuse to keep living in a reality that's a shitty sciencewank fanfiction with the original property absolutely sanitized, Harry James--\"\n\n\"The only one twisting this world is you, by wielding that destruction magic  -- child of the Scarlet King.\"\n\nHe was counting on the fundamental attribution error -- that everyone would think the laser weapon Penelope Panagiotopolous had used was the anti-magic of the Scarlet King instead of a light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, and so turn the crowd against her.\n\n\"The Scarlet King. I still can't believe that multiversal constant managed to leak its way into this delusion.\"\n\nBut Henry had said the magic words. Now the students had their resolve hardened, and they were willing to stand and fight. \n\n\"Dramatic final stands always do well,\" said Penelope Panagiotopolous. \"But bad fanfic always uses conservation of ninjutsu to raise the stakes.\"\n\nShe pulled out another laser rifle and started blasting, her breasts jiggling ever so slightly with the recoil of each shot. Henry cursed under his breath as his fellow graduates started dropping like flies. Laser weapons were outside context problems. They weren't like the Anti-Magic of the Scarlet King, so the magical shields his fellow students were raising were worthless. The Native Americans of his old world had no way to deal with the Europeans from across the sea, relying on their own verbal forms of diplomacy and bow and arrow against invaders with gunpowder and lawyers.

This is as close to empirically proven as facts about ontokinesis can get, in stark contrast with the traditional folklorish explanation: those who can bend the world bear a tiny fragment of the shattered soul of the Good Faerie Queen, and the glowing eyes are the touch of Mab's Madness -- an infection of the good soul with the poison of her Evil Twin. \n\nScientifically-literate reality warpers who have read this explanation about humic bleed reduce the effectiveness of germicidal ultraviolet lamps by 3% when they use their powers. Reality warpers who have //not// read this explanation, or otherwise do not understand it, do not affect the time it takes for a UV lamp to kill 99.99% of all bacteria -- and go mad almost five times as often as their scientifically literate peers. \n\nPast a certain level of power, both have glowing purple eyes.

He surveyed his soldiers. The best and brightest warriors of a generation, sick and tired of the Capitol's appeasement and calls for peace, ready to strike out on their own to make the hard decisions necessary for survival. \n\nThe Goblin Horde lingered just over the horizon. It was those few dark moments before dawn, and the Golden General knew this would be the day of the final battle.\n\n\"Gentlemen. Soldiers. Men of honor,\" said the Golden General. \"Today, we go to the biggest, most important fight of our generation. Today, we become legends.\"\n\nNo one knew where the goblins had come from. A few decades ago, they had simply appeared as if from a hole in the ground. While they had seemed benign at first, settling in inhospitable lands, soon they revealed themselves to be monstrous creatures:\n\nIn his prior life, he had once played a game called \"Starcraft\" with a race known as the Zerg. They were a nonsentient insect species, fast breeders which mutated at high rates and spread like wildfire through the cosmos, consuming everything in their wake. The goblins were like that. They worked together in perfect harmony. Their sick and dying would gladly work themselves to death, and the survivors would consume their corpses for sustenance. They didn't care for preserving natural resources and treated other living beings, including elves and humans, like raw material. Although they were capable of mimicking the civilized races, they were vermin that had to be exterminated, for if they were not, they would consume all the resources of the world and use it to propagate their own kind. \n\nWhat was worse, some of the humans had turned traitor. The Goblin Horde was an alliance between the Goblins, and the Horde, a tribe of warlike horse archers who hated society so much that they would rather ally with the goblins than their fellow man. \n\nMost people were like non-player characters from a video game. They went through life following the patterns that had been programmed into them by society. It was easy to get the responses you wanted out of people if you knew the flags for their behaviors. \n\n\"The cowards in the Capitol think coexistence with the Goblin Horde is possible. Out here, we know the truth. They come into our cities and our homes with their civil words and cries for coexistence, but once they're here, what do they do?\"\n\nHis soldiers, all clad in gleaming silvery armor, stood at rapt, murderous attention.\n\n\"They see the wealth of our cities and lie their way in, and once there the mask comes off and they show themselves as the savage beasts they truly are. They import their crimes and their alien ways, they corrupt our youth, and what's worse, they breed and spread so rapidly that in just a few decades, our way of life will be extinct! And what do we say to that!\"\n\n\"Never!\" the soldiers cried. Their lust for blood had been fully stirred. \n\nHumans were simply genetically disadvantaged. They were tied to estrus, and so the female half of the species was only in heat a few times a year.[[footnote]]Appears to be pre-SCP-8008 biology; see DEEPWELL data request.[[/footnote]] Breeding season, as it was called, triggered annually the battle of the sexes. In the old days, men were able to control their urges, but in the hyperstimulation of the new age, where goblin vendors hawked pheromonal perfumes to make their products irresistible, men became insatiable monsters. A pointless, wasteful lust, for outside of the cycles of estrus, women were infertile. Thus the eternal battle of the sexes raged on. \n\nThe goblins knew this, so they sold pheromone-laced products in human cities, taunting the men and destabilizing human society from within. Some men became homo-sexuals to cope, but that was only a solution on the individual level, and would lead to the extinction of the human race.\n\nThe elves of course fared little better. They were a long-lived race, so they reproduced on century scales, and so they were all slowly dying. \n\nEven on top of that, rich and intelligent humans and elves were able to delay reproduction. It was inevitable that those who were desperate, who needed more hands to work the farms and store tills, would see more value in more children than those who had wealth and wished to concentrate the power of their families in one place. It was the luxury of long term planning. And just as the poor would replace the rich and the stupid replace the smart, so too would the goblins replace humanity and the elves. \n\nHe would not let that happen. He alone would lead the human race through the thin needle of time into its glorious future. Even if he had to father it himself.\n\n\"Today, we end Goblinkind!\" he shouted. \"Today, we save man's future!\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n++ ETHCOM guideline 13017045: Guidelines for Species-Wide Genetic Modification\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n++++ Reproductive strategies: //K// vs //r//\nIn the field of ecology, there exists the concept of r/K selection. Without delving into technical details, the evolutionary survival strategies of species can be broadly divided into r-selecting or k-selecting. r-selecting species survive by producing many offspring, each one of which has a low chance of surviving to adulthood, but in aggregate are likely to have at least a few individuals survive. K-selecting species have few offspring and invest substantial resources into ensuring those individual offspring survive to adulthood. \n\nr/K selection is generally not accepted in literature as applicable within the human species. The idea that different countries and cultures within the human species have different socioeconomic outcomes because of r/K selection has been debunked as scientific racism akin to phrenology. Despite this, it is common for amateur anomalous social engineers[[footnote]]i.e. Individuals seeking to influence or alter the direction of human society via anomalous means without being affiliated with a major Group of Interest.[[/footnote]] to view r/K selection and other forms of scientific racism as viable paradigms or blueprints for their experiments. \n\n[[[SCP-752]]]-1 is an attempt to genetically engineer a \"perfect\" form of humanity by an organization of 19th century scientists and philosophers calling themselves 'Eudaimon'. The subspecies was designed to be cooperative, having almost no competitive instinct, to the extent where populations in the millions could be sustained with 19th-century technology -- in essence, SCP-752-1 was designed to have the reproductive rate of r-strategists and the individual investment of K-strategists. In facilitating this survival, the society developed by SCP-752-1 had no cannibalism taboo and a utilitarian approach to overwork and reproduction. \n\nAny design of a perfected humanity requires a normative judgment of what \"perfect\" means, in the context of human beings. The Foundation's mandate is to determine and enforce \"normal\", and even that is a topic of ongoing debate. The Foundation //cannot// become an authority on what is to be considered perfect.\n\n------\n\n++++ Acceptable Circumstances for Alteration\nEven lesser well-meaning intentioned alterations can have severe ethical ramifications: [[[SCP-3031]]] is a neural symbiote that is integral to the current baseline strain of humanity.

Its primary purpose is to amplify signals associated with fear within the human brain, including paranoia or fear against non-existent threats. Additionally, it incentivizes creativity as a defense mechanism against nonexistent threats.\n\nIn attempting to preserve the survival of humanity, a Foundation analogue significantly magnified the human capacity for racism and other bigotries, the susceptibility of human minds to memetic effects, and the risk of self-inflicted nuclear annihilation. \n\nGenetic modification of humanity, temporal or otherwise, is an absolute last resort. \n\n[[/div]]\n++ SCP-8008-3.575: Recovered writings of Möngke Khan\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n\n[[f<image mongke.png]]\nI am Möngke, grandson of Temujin.[[footnote]]commonly known as Genghis Khan.[[/footnote]] I have journeyed over one thousand years from my grandfather's death, and over nine hundred from when his loyal soldiers came to me at Diaoyu Fortress and called me to honor his memory and join in the forever war. I have fought here ever since my failure at Diaoyu, and once my people are free to journey even further I shall return to my death. \n\nThey told me they sought to honor the Great Khan's last wish -- that of an unmarked grave -- and would do so by delving ever deeper into the future until he had been forgotten by the winds of time. They had come to a world torn by war, a world with no true history, and thought perhaps that this might be his proper resting spot -- until they were beset upon by the Mad God.\n\nThe Mad God. The Golden General. The Shifter. The Secret King. The Time Pervert. Known by many names, he had constructed an entire false world. This place and its history were entirely false, beyond even the illusion of Maya. It was not a proper resting place for the Great Khan.\n\nAnd so they had fought to destroy him, and been utterly crushed underfoot, either to be slain or used as puppets in his endless game alongside the rest of mankind--\n\nThe Foundation woke us from the nightmare. This was a war fought within time, and they had built a fortress beyond his reach.\n\nIt has always been the Mongol way to use the talents of those we conquer. There is no shame in embracing a superior weapon. There is no shame in allying with a superior power. Those who we spared knew that well. It has been humbling to learn this lesson myself. It is preferable to dying at the hands of a Mad God.\n\nWe could dip into and out of his illusions, though only sparsely. My forces had sought to understand this \"Goblinkind\", determine if it was truly a threat to this false world, only to be disappointed in our entirety. They were puppets under the control of a distant puppetmaster. They followed clear, repeatable patterns and rules. In our conquests, the unpredictability of the conquered had been a source of refreshing intrigue -- but here there was no true menace. \n\nSo we armed them, gave them weapons they would never forge themselves, and set them on a path to collide with the Mad God. \n\nI watched the fruit of my plans from a cliff overlooking the field of battle, where the Golden General led his forces to clash against the goblins. Another was with me -- the scholar Montauk, who had been sucked into this world of nightmare upon trying to hear the howling upon the winds from the distant past. \n\n\"Do you ever feel like a coward, watching from up here instead of going down there? If I remember my history, you were hardly one to shirk from battle,\" said the scholar Montauk.\n\n\"I have fled a thousand years from my inevitable death,\" said I. \"When I have done my duty, I shall go to die in my place. This is part of my duty.\"\n\nThe Golden General met the goblins head first. He swung his ridiculous, oversized sword and hit 5 goblins at once. The weapon was blunt; they did not bleed but were flung through the air. \n\n\"You and I have seen true brutality. Bloody war. The concrete that chains it. The howling that follows,\" said Montauk. \"You and I, we understand it. But does he?\"\n\n\"Surely he does.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the letters that he sends to his imagined Capitol?\"\n\n\"I have. I did not care for them.\" \n\nNow the rest of his army had met the goblin horde. The goblins were far more numerous -- at least five for every soldier -- and it was beyond obvious that the forces of the Golden General would be overwhelmed. Still, they fought on -- and though many soldiers fell, it was clear that the Golden General stood unscathed. Proof of his \"godhood\". \n\n\"You are a man of two worlds, more than I. The blood of the battlefield, the concrete of the royal court,\" said the scholar Montauk. \"Which are his thoughts?\"\n\n\"Concrete,\" said I. \"He speaks like a sophist of the court. He gives reasons in multitude, interlocking with each other so that they might be an unassailable wall.\"\n\n\"And with that logic and reasons he justifies a primal hatred,\" said the scholar Montauk. \"That's all his sophistry comes to. That primal race hatred, transposed onto 'goblins'. Whatever they are, whoever they might be in the real world outside of this delusion, they're acceptable targets when on his puppet strings. The rules of this world that he has constructed make it acceptable to kill him. Does that seem like the concrete to you?\"\n\n\"Through concrete, he calls for blood. And so it is the howling.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said the scholar Montauk. \"He's rather obsessed with the idea of progeny. Perhaps it's only blood after all.\"\n\nThe Golden General's forces had almost been completely overwhelmed, buried under a sea of writhing goblin bodies, yet still he fought on. His armor gleamed as the sun rose. He pulled off his helmet, exposing the sweat of his brow, and raised his sword to catch the gleam of the sky. It was bad tactics, frankly, to fight by charging into the sunrise. I suppose there was an aesthetic appeal to it.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=sunrise.jpg|\ncaption=A new day.|\nalign=center |\nwidth=100%\n]]\n\n\n\"'What is he but the cry for a forgotten age?'\"  said the scholar Montauk. \"That's all this tawdry fantasy amounts to. The lost era when being good at killing made you a great man. I am no stranger to the lust for blood, justified through scientific objectivity, but this is baser. The delusions of a world where murderous strength led to reproductive success. The world your grandfather knew.\"\n\n\"I will never understand you future men,\" I said. \"I much prefer the comforts of my palace to that of the war camp.\"\n\n\"Easy to say for a man with four wives.\"\n\nThe Golden General opened his mouth as if to give a speech. I drew my bow and shot him in the head.\n\n\"Möngke.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to hear more of these words.\"\n\n\"I don't either. He knows we're here now.\"\n\n\"My aim is true. He will not last the hour.\"\n\nWe watched him collapse upon that field, his blood spilling below him as goblins tore off his chestplate and began stabbing at his flesh.\n\n\"What do you think shall happen, once he is ended? Will we continue on as we are, or shall we be restored to our proper times as if this had never occurred?\" \n\nThere was a flash of purple light from the Golden General. The goblins stabbing at him fell still. His power had activated, now that his fantasy had been shattered, and the world began to //change//. He would survive this, as he had a thousand times before.\n\n\"Question for another time,\" said the scholar Montauk. \n\nI apologize, honorary Khan Reynders, for my insolence in slaying him. In my defense, the \"SCP-001\" file you showed me when I first arrived stated that we were to \"kill the fucker\", though the honor rightfully belongs to you.\n\nAnd for that reason, honorary Khan Reynders, Administrator of the Foundation, defender of the righteous future, we beseech you for your blessing in the extermination of this foul and wretched man for good.

I walk towards it, but I hear screams, so I start running. Suddenly, I'm out of breath. I need a break. In my previous life, I was a computer programmer. Then I realize, what if I use my cheat skill to slow down time, so I can walk there comfortably but arrive quickly? So I take off my pants and activate my cheat skill.\n\nWhen I arrive, a group of bandits are assaulting the townspeople. They are the usual sort of fantasy bandits, as they are ugly and dirty and wear stained brown leather. \n\n\"Another one,\" says the bandit leader. \"Where did you come from? Well, you look too old to reeducate, so we will kill you.\"\n\nThe bandits approach me. Many of them point sharp swords at me. They are human. But there is one dog man and two cat girls, who are unarmed. The dog man lunges at me. \n\nI activate my cheat skill. I take all the swords from their hands, and put them in a pile. Then, I break the dog man's neck, as his teeth are sharp and I cannot disarm him. I don't hurt the cat girls since they are hanging back. They are cute, too.\n\nThe bandit leader seems surprised at what I have done.\n\n\"I will give you a chance,\" I say. \"Leave these good people be, and I will let you live. Otherwise, if you face me, you will perish.\"\n\n\"No! Thaddeus!\" says one of the cat girls.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" says one of the bandits. She immediately falls silent, choking on her tongue.\n\nI crack my knuckles.\n\n\"I was going to let you live, but I see now you are a slaver. Those who would impinge upon the inherent liberty of others do not deserve to live.\"\n\nI activate my cheat skill and kill them all. \n\n\"What have you done?\" says the same cat girl once she sees. She yowls in despair.\n\n\"I freed you, did I not? You're welcome.\"\n\nShe pulls down her blouse to reveal a collar around her neck. \n\n\"This is a Bostrom Alignment Collar, created by the dark wizard Nakamoto Bostrom. It removes the ability of the wearer to conceive of actions against the interests of their master, nya. It was originally created to prevent golems from rising up and destroying humanity, but now humans have used it to enslave all the other races of the world!\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=collar.png|caption=A Bostrom Alignment Collar.]]\n\n\"But the slaver is dead,\" I say. \"Doesn't that mean you are free?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Alignment Collars were forged by Blocked Chain enchantments. Even with the death of m... master, I cannot act against his wishes in life, nya... The only way I can be free now is if someone does the impossible and breaks the Blocked Chain. Otherwise, the Collars will Burn us, and then we will die...\"\n\n\"May I see it?\" I ask.\n\n\"If you try to take it off of me, I will be Burned, nya. I can't imagine you will be able to do anything. The Blocked Chain was enchanted by inscrutable and powerful lost magics -- forbidden powers called calculus and statistics.\"\n\nI had known calculus and statistics since I started teaching myself in middle school. I activate my cheat skill.\n\nMy first order of business is to examine one of the collars. I do not want to hurt the cat girls, so I take it off of the corpse of the dog man, Thaddeus. His flesh bursts into flames and crumbles into ashes as soon as I remove it. \n\nI know nothing about magic, but I have infinite time. After a hundred years of analyzing the collar using my cheat skill, I fully understand the magic of this world. Now, I can see the enchantments that define the Bostrom Alignment Collars. I can see the Ledger, the huge list of master-slave relationships defined by the Collars, and how they enforce their orders. Over the course of a decade, I look through the Ledger until I find the names of masters who had just gone dark -- because they had died very recently, in the past few minutes. \n\nI do not know the cat girls' names. Also, I realize that the Ledger was enchanted in an odd manner. If I were to delete the slavers' names from the Ledger, all of it would become invalidated, and might corrupt the system or worse, Burn all of the wearers to death. The most efficient way would be to delete the Ledger entirely, and so make the Bostrom Alignment Collars useless. \n\nBut then I remember what the cat girl said. The Bostrom Alignment Collars were originally created to prevent human society from being destroyed. They were doing a net utility, a net good, and I had no idea what consequences might happen if I destroyed them all. I might destroy society just to help two cat girls. What to do?\n\nThe answer is obvious. I must simply replace the names of all the dead masters with my own. This way, all of the slaves doomed to Burn would live. I make the change and end my cheat skill.\n\n\"I cannot free you,\" I say, \"But I've made it so you won't die. I've replaced his name in the Blocked Chain's ledger with my own. I promise you, I'll be a good master until I can free you for good.\"\n\n\"Thank you, hero...\" says the cat girl. \"My name is Alice, nya. And this is Ilse. Let's try to get along, now.\" \n\n\"What's your name, master?\"\n\nI had been reborn, so it feels right to choose a new name. \"My family name is Tengoku (天国).

SCP-597 is a fetish object that represents motherhood. It is a blob of flesh with thousands of nipples. When the nipples are sucked, it produces the milk of the drinker's mother. It has an effect that compels worship.\n\nThrough the redirection of faith across SCP-001 by exposure to SCP-597's compulsive effect, SCP-597 will be temporarily elevated to divinity for the duration of the invocation of the Scarlet King.\n\nThis apotheosis will counterbalance the destructive presence of the Scarlet King -- the Scarlet King will induce a desire to return to a primal state of being, but \"the Mother Goddess\" will induce interpretation of that state of being as infancy.

But I'm skeptical they will; for those less technically inclined, the mechanism of tachyon backpropagation allows the future to affect the past. Our actions will cause the SCP-001 \"time tumor\" to break, which will cause its effects to spill outwards into the multiverse. Despite the repetition and stagnation of this all, this nightmare contains a lot of \"future\", which needs to go somewhere. When we succeed -- or perhaps because our attempts so far have been failing -- we create a set of metastable timelines and timeplanes, which are able to exist only because we will have acted, which feed into SCP-001.

We can ruin him psychologically so that he can't even dream about ruling the world. We can turn his destiny into being a nervous wreck who can't even think about opposing us. -- Thaddeus Xyank 19673 (TAD)\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"discussion\"]]\nThis is the most psychopathic thing you've ever said.

One thing led to another, and you've come to the unfortunate conclusion that everything you know is a lie. Maybe a false god inserted itself into our reality and you're the only one who remembers the truth. Maybe the English language is missing a letter. Maybe an entire species has vanished from the earth. \n\nWhatever it is, you're likely understandably distraught. Here are some tips on coming to terms with this new reality:\n* **Change what you can change, accept what you cannot:** It's possible that you aren't crazy, and this new reality is a genuine aberration. You owe it to yourself to determine which reality is actually true. However, even if you end up completely certain that this reality is a new construct, you may lack the ability to actually do something about it.\n* **Consider amnestics:** A Foundation-provided course of amnestic therapy can help you align with consensus reality. However, pharmaceutical solutions are often rightfully considered a last resort. \n* **If you can't tell, does it matter?:** In the course of everyday life, our lives have been shaped by non-anomalous forces that define who we are and what we believe. The circumstances of our birth, the availability of resources and education, and ripple effects from the rich, the powerful, and the long-dead elite. We are all traumatized by our parents, just as they were traumatized by theirs. French King Louis XIV was insecure over being short, and as a result, centuries later, high heels are part of the uniform of femininity. Coming to terms with the inherent incongruity of human agency is a necessary step to thriving in a malleable world.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include more-by:lordxvnv]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8007]]] |  SCP-8008 | [[[SCP-8009]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** timepervertsplash2.jpg\n> **Name:** timepervertsplash2.jpg\n> **Author:** LORDXVNV\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [ Own Work]\n> From:\n> **Filename:**  \n> **Name:** File:Neuschwanstein Castle LOC print rotated.jpg\n> **Author:** Unknown Author\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neuschwanstein_Castle_LOC_print_rotated.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Filename:**  \n> **Name:** File:San Francisco at Sunset.jpg\n> **Author:** Digon3\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_at_Sunset.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Filename:**  \n> **Name:** File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg\n> **Author:** User:MatthiasKabel\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Venus_of_Willendorf_frontview_retouched_2.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** timepervert2.jpg\n> **Name:** timepervert2.jpg\n> **Author:** LORDXVNV\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [ own work]\n> From:\n> **Filename:**  \n> **Name:** File:Evidence for the Bayesian conspiracy.jpg\n> **Author:** Anders Sandberg\n> **License:** CC-BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/arenamontanus/3045777942/ Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** fractal2.jpg\n> **Name:** fractal2.jpg\n> **Author:** LORDXVNV\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [ own work]\n> From:\n> **Filename:**  \n> **Name:** File:Fractal Design Menger labyrinthe 3D.jpg\n> **Author:** Pete Linforth\n> **License:** Creative Commons 0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fractal_Design_Menger_labyrinthe_3D.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** capitol.jpg\n> **Name:** File:United States Capitol Building Panorama.jpg\n> **Author:** BrianKachejian\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_Capitol_Building_Panorama.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** not-ilse.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Beautiful-Caucasian-women-002.jpg\n> **Author:** Barry Roths\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/runningproduction/30459725181/ Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** paris.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Street of paris.jpg\n> **Author:** Mz.Akosua\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Street_of_paris.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** oil.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Korňanský ropný prameň.JPG\n> **Author:** Branork\n> **License:** CC-BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kor%C5%88ansk%C3%BD_ropn%C3%BD_prame%C5%88.JPG Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** hanazono.aic.png\n> **Name:** hanazono.aic.png\n> **Author:** LORDXVNV\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [ own work]\n-----\n> **Filename:** quark.png\n> **Name:** File:Quark structure proton.svg\n> **Author:** Arpad Horvath\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 2.5\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Quark_structure_proton.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** color.png\n> **Name:** File:AdditiveColorMixing.svg\n> **Author:** Quark67\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AdditiveColorMixing.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** qcd.png\n> **Name:** File:Qcd fields field (physics).svg\n> **Author:** Maschen\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Qcd_fields_field_(physics).svg Wikimedia Commons]\n-----\n> **Filename:** scarletking.jpg\n> **Name:** File:\"\"I'll paint the town red\"\", political cartoon, 1885.jpg\n> **Author:** Grant E.
