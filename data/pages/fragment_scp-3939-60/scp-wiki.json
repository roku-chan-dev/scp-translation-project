It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nIt's not fine. You'll have to rewrite it tomorrow.\n\nYour career could hinge on SCP-3939. If Carlos wants to ruin that, then he can go get his own project to fuck over, as far as you care. You definitely don't want him working with you anymore.\n\n> **3939-Alpha:** Don't come into work tomorrow. I don't want to see this quality of work all over this project.\n\nYou don't expect to see a response from him.\n\nAll you've managed to do is delay your workload. The article still needs to be rewritten.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/18 Let's do that tomorrow. Time to go home.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
