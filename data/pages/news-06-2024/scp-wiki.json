To celebrate all of our LGTBQ+ readers, writers, and artists, we are hosting PrideFest! PrideFest is an event where users are encouraged to write an article about or draw LGBTQ+ characters. Multiple entries are allowed per person, and the most important rule is to have fun!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n[[=image http://co-team.wikidot.com/local--files/site-news-image-hosting/zine.jpg]]\n\nThe ES wiki's 10-year anniversary zine is out... one year late!

If you want to learn about the Spanish-speaking branch of the SCP wiki, there is no better place to start than this zine.

Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. \n\nThis month's prompts are below! \n\n[[size x-large]]That's A Bold Move Cotton. Let's See If It Pays Off….[[/size]] //Submitted by DrSoot77//\nHave the main character or the SCP Foundation take a bold and big but risky move of some kind in the narrative of your SCP or Tale. Does have to be slightly out of character move for the SCP Foundation in this case.

Create something about our favorite statue!\n\nIf you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month's prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn't a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month's prompts as well!
