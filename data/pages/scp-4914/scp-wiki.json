Prepare for shenanigans.\n\n[[[mrpines-author-page|More from this author]]]\n[[include info:end]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4914\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers have confirmed that the only copy of SCP-4914 is in Foundation custody and the hard drive containing it is to be stored in a standard anomalous items locker. Testing of SCP-4914 is permitted by researchers level 1 or higher. These tests are only to be done on remote systems lacking internet access. \n\nThe internet activity of SCP-4914's creator[[footnote]] Real name: Carter Wick, online alias: 'Takeovermetal' [[/footnote]] is to be monitored for further anomalous incidents.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4914 is a modified digital copy of the video game Doom, originally released in 1993 by id Software. Unlike standard versions of Doom, SCP-4914 is 468 megabytes in size and functions from a single executable file. Upon running SCP-4914, it functions as a standard copy of Doom. \n\nSCP-4914-1 are anomalous growths of //Digitaria sanguinalis//, a species of grass commonly referred to as crabgrass. SCP-4914-1 grows directly on the motherboard of the computer SCP-4914 is run on. This growth occurs 16 hours after SCP-4914 is executed. During its growth cycle, SCP-4914-1 uses high amounts of computer processing power from any available components.[[footnote]] Central processing unit, graphics processing unit, and RAM. [[/footnote]] SCP-4914-1 is capable of regrowing to full maturity within 5 minutes if it is removed by any means other than the use of vinegar.\n\nTo date, no other alternately modified copies have been recovered.\n\n**Addendum 4914/1:** SCP-4914 was originally discovered after its online posting by known members of GoI '[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-hub Gamers Against Weed].' The following are chat logs documenting SCP-4914's creation and initial distribution.\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"â–¼ Access Chat Logs / Excerpt 1 â–¼\" hide=\"â–² Hide Logs â–²\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**Bingledorf:**[[/span]] but yeah, my cat is awesome\n> = **Takeovermetal has joined.**\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**liquid_water:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"ping\"]]@Takeovermetal[[/span]] who the hell are you?\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**lucy:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"ping\"]]@Bingledorf[[/span]] send more pics when u can\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Just another fuckin loser like you [[span class=\"ping\"]]@liquid_water[[/span]]\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] lmao\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] so what brings you here, guy\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**liquid_water:**[[/span]] lol thats fair\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] [[span class=\"ping\"]]@rocknrow[[/span]] Heard about you all, and thought I'd stop by to see what kinda crazy shenanigans occur here\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] So do you guys like doom?\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] like the game?\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Yeah\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] i fuckin love it, why?\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] I like to mod doom from time to time\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] oh shit can i see some of your stuff?\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Yeah, hold on\n> = **Takeovermetal uploaded file [[span class=\"fakedl\"]]doom2irl.exe[[/span]] 48mb [[span class=\"click\"]]â¬‡[[/span]]**\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] exe and not a wad?\n> [[span class=\"member\"]]**liquid_water:**[[/span]] 48 megabytes wtf\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Exes are easier to uh\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] You know, magically fuck with\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] are they? huh\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Yeah, everything's packed into it\n> [[span class=\"member2\"]]**rocknrow:**[[/span]] this is built on gzdoom right [[span class=\"edit\"]](edited)[[/span]]\n> [[span class=\"member0\"]]**Takeovermetal:**[[/span]] Yeah.
