Curious and crippled, a nuclear physicist who [[[Exit History| can't seem to stay away]]] from [[[SCP-2400|cataclysmic threats.]]] Fortunately, through an absurd combination of [[[Too Insane to Fail| improvisation and miracles]]], he seems to be the best man for the job.

Keeping several ends of the world in check, stopping XK, YK and ZK events, none of it will ever be enough to satiate his envy, his hatred...his great emptiness from which the tears will never run dry. He will never stop searching for answers, and, for the sake of humanity, it is imperative that he finds one.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth Dr. Daniel Asheworth]:** Thaumaturgist and self-proclaimed alchemist. Hot-headed, short-tempered, and sometimes arrogant, but with a good heart.  Born from an unknown American mother and an unknown Polish father in the late 1950s. One of few people in the Foundation capable of prolonging their youth through anomalous means.\n\nLead of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub| Damien Nowak Case]]]. Believed to once have had been a temporary member of the [[[a-library-empty| Wanderers' Library]]] and [[[critter-profile-sparky| Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]], Daniel Asheworth has proven numerous times to be a useful asset in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120| Site-120]]]'s Director Council.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"All magic comes with a price...\" hide=\"...but it is a price I am willing to pay.\"]]\n\nPast proven over and over to be surrounded in a fog mystery not easily penetrated, though believed to be interchangeably connected to PoI-5936 (\"Damien Nowak\"), the cult under his fist, \"the Children,\" and O5-9.

Thomas, Trevor and Tristan Bailey]:** [[[multi-u-101| Identical triplets]]] employed by the Foundation. [[[a-very-bailey-christmas| Sons of Tyler Bailey]]], inventor of the Multi-Universal Transit Array. Employed by the Foundation for an unknown period of time (employee records and personal accounts differ), and look anywhere between 20 and 40 as a side effect of constantly crossing universal barriers.\n\nTrevor Bailey is the former head of the Department of [[[a-multi-universal-affair| Multi-Universal Affairs]]], before being demoted to a desk job at Site-19 for mishandling of a Keter-class anomaly. [[[a-merry-fellow| Tom “Bombadill” Bailey]]] is currently the commissioner of [[[antarctic-exchange-hub| Site-1483]]] (within the [[[scp-1483| Third Antarctic Empire]]]), following a career spent exploring alternate universes. Tristan Bailey is a [[[unscience| physicist]]], diplomat and designer of a multi-universal translator. Formerly assigned to @@[@@[[[scp-2000| REDACTED]]]@@]@@, currently Director of [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub| Site-87]]].\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-blank Dr. Harold Blank]:** [[[SCP-6056 | An]]] historian of anomalous phenomena, Chair of Archives and Revision at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 | Site-43]]]. Grumpy, sarcastic, incapable of taking anything more seriously than it needs to be taken, including himself. One of a select few staff at his Site forced to [[[bury-the-survivors-hub | navigate]]] [[[wrong-tomorrow-hub | alternate]]] [[[deadlined-hub | timelines]]] every time he fucks up [[[SCP-5243 | one specific duty]]] on one specific day each year. \"Friends\" with Dr. Wettle, best friends with Dr. Lillihammer and [[[on-the-same-page | romantically linked]]] with research partner Dr. Melissa Bradbury.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"History is written by...\" hide=\"...me, generally speaking. Sometimes it's a rewrite.\"]]\nHarry Blank had more than his fair share of [[[SCP-5162 | anomalous discoveries]]] [[[SCP-5729 | early in life]]], and [[[SCP-5238 | one of them]]] eventually drove him into the arms of the Foundation... or, rather, he was [[[dissertation | driven there]]] in Lillihammer's truck, and they both got [[[defence | inducted]]]. He was the favourite [[[the-good-work | protégé]]] of Site-43 founder Vivian Scout, and has stood by his post across disasters both [[[the-b-b-decommission | paranormal]]] and [[[whose-lake-is-it-anyway | political]]]. He's happy in his Canadian dugout (with only occasional [[[the-green-machine | excursions beyond]]]), with his Canadian girlfriend, for the time being. But [[[BLANK | times change]]], as he and his colleagues know all too well. Hey, it could be [[[SCP-5956 | worse]]]...\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/django-bridge Dr. Django Bridge]:** [[[conclusions-red-173-2263-incident| Foundation Archivist]]]. Quiet but [[[rounderhouse-proposal| influential]]], with a touch of both melancholy and whimsy. Extraordinary memory. On a first-name basis with Dr. Bright, and has frequently acted as an informal assistant for him.\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-bright Dr. Jack Bright]:** [[[scp-5004|Director]]] of [[[an-evening-with-bright| Foundation Personnel]]]. Somewhat [[[the-best-and-the-wisest| amoral]]]. Extremely [[[unfinished-business| loyal]]] to the Foundation. May be ridiculous, [[[the-many-portraits-of-jack-bright| may be terrifying]]]; is certainly [[[we-re-off-to-be-the-lizard| blunt]]]. Attached to [[[SCP-963]]], and is therefore immortal, using the body of whatever SCP-963 has last touched.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I've been with the company for a long time.\" hide=\"I am not the damned monkey.\"]]\n\nHis [[[codebrown| family]]] has been associated with the Foundation (and other anomalous groups) since time immemorial. His younger brother is [[[SCP-590]]] (which a few know); [[[SCP-321]]] is a sister (which almost no one knows). At least two other relatives work for the Foundation at a high level. Several of Bright's discarded bodies -- still possessing his personality and knowledge at time of separation from SCP-963 -- have been put to work on secret Foundation projects. Bright possesses a [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs|desire]]] to permanently [[[the-executions-of-doctor-bright| die]]] that he may not be conscious of; ironic, for he only became part of SCP-963 because he was trying //not// to die.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-cimmerian Dr. Jeremiah Cimmerian]:** An [[[ethics]]] [[[scp-2713|committee]]] [[[scp-2632| liaison]]] that takes [[[lending-a-hand| his job]]] [[[a-tale-about-petty-revenge| only]]] [[[the-case-of-the-bathroom-cheese-labels| somewhat]]] [[[cimmerian-sends-650-pms| seriously]]]. He never thought his [[[scp-4690|doctorate in English Literature]]] or his minor in philosophy would actually help him stay employed, but the former got him recruited into the Foundation as a researcher and the latter secured his employment in the [[[scp-4971| long]]] [[[scp-5281| term]]]. Has an unusual interest in [[[orientation-for-the-pastaphysics-department| puns]]] and the [[[scp-4199| ethical]]] [[[scp-4864|treatment]]] of [[[scp-4175| humanoids]]].\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-clef Dr. Alto Clef]:** Enigmatic and genre-savvy. A highly adaptable, clever liar. Former [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] (GOC) [[[termination-order| operative]]], specializing in [[[clef101| reality benders]]]. Also a former file clerk. Undergone anomalous alterations that provide resistance to reality shifts and prevent his face from being [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| photographed]]]. Has a [[[clef-excerpts| long]]] and [[[clef-and-dimitri-hit-the-road| checkered]]] history, a flair for the [[[incident-239-b-clef-kondraki| dramatic]]], and a somewhat hidden streak of self-hatred. Reformed misogynist. Most rumors about him are [[[all-they-want-is-the-blood| exaggerated]]] or [[[chowderclef| off-point]]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"They'll say anything about me.\" hide=\"Except the truth.\"]]\n\nGOC codename [[[agent-ukelele| Agent Ukulele]]], prior to defection. [[[able-baker-charlie|May actually]]] be a [[[icky-ichabod| reality warper]]] himself or [[[chowderclef| just an ordinary SCP Foundation researcher then and now just like all the rest]]]. [[[scp-4231| May]]] or [[[originofclef| may not]]] have had a child with a \"nature goddess\" as a teenage boy; the \"goddess\" was killed by the GOC, but the daughter became a (current) [[[scp-166| SCP object in containment]]] -- if this even happened at all. [[[scp-2000| Involved in]]] a [[[yesterday | number of]]] CK-class reality restructuring events (and may be able to remember them). Unlikely to be a manifestation of the being popularly known as the Devil, despite [[[supplemental-report-239-b-192| claims]]] to the contrary.\n\nAccording to a [[[the-decoy| large]]] [[[intermission2| number]]] of [[[unfinished-business| inconsistent]]] [[[rounderhouse-proposal| reports]]], Alto Clef [[[a-suicide-note| may]]] [[[the-tombstone-of-alto-clef |well]]] [[[a-fitting-end| be]]] [[[the-death-of-alto-clef-etc| deceased]]]. Other accounts insist that he's [[[resurrection| still around]]], now working with his [[[gamedaypart1index| former secretary]]], [[[contingency| Andrea Adams]]]. \"Alto Clef\" is almost certainly [[[classicalrevivalindex| an alias]]], used by a man known as [[[the-great-site-87-bakesale| Francis Wojciechoski]]] or [[[intermission2| James Halforth]]], or possibly one used by [[[father-of-lies| multiple individuals]]].\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**Dr. Milford Cogent:** At one time a [[[SCP-7874|committed]]] researcher, now bitter and abrasive. Career is relatively unremarkable, with a few cases of ending up in the [[[SCP-7193|wrong place at the wrong time]]]. Previously at the forefront of a promising, now defunct, cooperation project with [[[SCP-7239|the Vatican]]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Following in the footsteps of giants...\" hide=\"...it's damn well too much sometimes.\"]]\n\nForced to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-liar-the-bird-and-the-choice terminate his nephew] as a test of loyalty. Recent events have led most personnel to consider him a traitor to the Foundation. His current allegiance remains unclear.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/kain-pathos-crow Dr. Kain \"Pathos\" Crow]:** [[[olympia| Cross-disciplinary]]] //wunderkind// researcher, specializing particularly in [[[dr-cog-and-the-plastic-fantastic| biochemistry]]] and [[[new-tricks| robotics]]]. Rarely, if ever, seen in public. May or may not have been permanently [[[classicalrevivalindex| transformed]]] into a [[[scp-4444| dog-like body]]] as the result of a particular [[[upswing-of-disorder| anomalous event]]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I'm so tired these days.\" hide=\" I don't even want to work on the walker...\"]]\n\nRan a number of highly classified cross-testing experiments with the aim of creating useful objects of anomalous origin, notably [[[olympia-project| Project Olympia]]]. Nearly terminated several times. Difficulties in the canine body and an [[[rounderhouse-proposal| unclear lifespan]]] have resulted in a considerable drop in productivity. Many of his side projects have become dormant.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-dan Dr. Dan] ███████:** Insufferable, emotive genius with a big-picture-centric set of principles. Former marine. Lead researcher on [[[scp-096 | an SCP]]] too dangerous to keep around, but couldn't make the O5 Council see it that way. [[[incident-096-1-a | Took matters into his own hands]]], getting dozens of people killed, getting his decommissioning request accepted, and getting a death sentence (in that order).\n\n[[collapsible show=\"You make one little mistake...\" hide=\"...and they give you an entire department.\"]]\n\nStill alive a decade later, spent the time drafting decommissioning proposals in detention before a [[[resurrection-old-foes-hub | mass containment breach]]] made his non-linear thinking skills invaluable again. Now serves as [[[the-bowe-decommission-part-one | Director]]] of the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA), masterminding the Foundation response to anomalous disasters like the one he famously engineered, ever mindful of the very human toll such cleverness can take on the world at large.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-edison Dr. Michael Edison]:** Level-3 Researcher, current head of the Foundation's Inter-Site Testing Initiative (ISTI). Dr. Edison has received disciplinary action on multiple occasions due to a repeated pattern of [[[scp-foundation-the-movie | unsanctioned]]] and [[[game-day-1-die-hardest|ill-conceived]]] behavior. These behaviors have resulted in temporary reassignment to the Site-██ Antarctic base. His current assignment at Site 19 is contingent on approval from his assigned therapist.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"My legends begins in the 12th century...\" hide=\"FOOL!\"]]\n\nThough quiet and reserved most of the time, Dr. Edison secretly dreams of being a badass like Dr. Clef (or at least the image most staffers have of Dr. Clef). While respected as a researcher, his attempts at more outrageous endeavors are most often met with derision. Has a petty, but long-standing grudge against Delivery Agent Roadrunner. [[[bargain-bin-of-direct-to-forum-sequels| Is known to]]] [[[dr-ikari-i-presume| sometimes write]]] [[[scp-foundation-the-movie-2| terrible fanfiction.]]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-elliott Dr. Chelsea \"Photosynthetic\" Elliott]:** Plant [[[scp-5954| specialist]]], both [[[scp-6288|anomalous]]] and non-anomalous. Dedicated, friendly, prone to tunnel vision. Often in the field; excessively [[[scp-978-extended-test-logs| 'hands-on']]] in her lab and field research, leading to a number of injuries. Scars cover her hands and arms.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"We're at the cusp of something here.\" hide=\"...\"]]\n\n[[[light-dependent-reactions| Anomalous capability]]] due to exposure to a [[[scp-2108|\"sun of unknown provenance\"]]]. Investigation is ongoing. Possible security risk due to strong personal desire to advance worldwide scientific knowledge in her chosen field; she's perhaps a little //too// excited about the marvels she has studied, and feels conflicted about [[[rounderhouse-proposal| her role]]] within the Foundation.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-elstrom Doctor Karen Elstrom]:** Chief of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 | Site-43's]]] Administration and Oversight Section. responsible for managing the logistics required to keep the facility in operation. A [[[scp-5109 | meticulous administrator]]] and [[[the-forms | consummate bureaucrat]]], respected but [[[bitch-hub | not particularly popular]]]. Dedicated to her work, but somewhat [[[the-huron-carol | prone]]] to [[[passing-sentence | illness]]]. \n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood Dr. Justine 'Jay' Everwood]:** GoI specialist, very well-read and knowledgeable on the many groups of interests the Foundation faces. Is particularly interested in [[[dr-wondertainment-hub| Dr. Wondertainment]]] and [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]]. Is generally approachable but is often lost in thought, be they [[[robin| mundane]]] or fantastical.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Have a wonderful day!\" hide=\"...\"]]\nPrefers to go by Jay rather than Justine, and presents themselves as nonbinary but also accepts female pronouns. They are missing their right arm, which was lost in an [[[scp-8725|unknown incident]]] involving a mysterious figure. Rex Alces is their trusted assistant, and they are often stationed at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-55|Site-55]]].\n\nThey are dating Doctor Ilse Reynders as of 2023 and as of 2025, have moved into Site-43 to live with her. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-fynegan Dr. Joseph \"Joe\" Fynegan]:** Senior researcher at Site-409 and lead on the containment/documentation on [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-wow-j/offset/2 several] [[[scp-4917|SCPs]]]. Was once suspected of [[[kaleidoscope-of-guilt|having murdered]]] a fellow Foundation employee but later exonerated of all charges. Expert on [[[arbh-class-debrief-file|ARBH Class Event Scenarios]]], AKA [[[arbh-class-hub|\"Insect Hell\"]]] extinction-level [[[zero-hour| events]]]. A little socially awkward and very much an oversized nerd, he has a very relaxed temperament and perhaps a little naïve for someone in his position.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I'm a very boring guy, you know...\" hide=\"I promise.\"]]\n\nInvolved (perhaps romantically) with former GOC operative, suspected CI spy, and current Foundation Agent Amelia Kabasic. She is also assigned to Site-409 for easy monitoring.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-garrison Dr. Heather Garrison]:** Loud, snarky and overconfident -- but she's usually right, so people still listen. Director of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-site|SITE]]], Head of the Anomalous Ontology Department, and sometimes MemeticsSpecialist at [[[On Guard 43 Hub|Site 43]]]; professionally [[[The Deadname Meme|breaking concepts]]] and getting away with it, in between unofficial research [[[Cat Got Your Tongue?|projects]]]. A frequent observer, visitor and manipulator of the Noosphere.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"You don't get it? Don't worry about it.\" hide=\"You'll forget about it, anyways.\"]]\n\n[[[Forgotten Memories Hub|Heather and Dr. Lillian Lillihammer are dating]]], and would do anything to stay together -- thankfully, Lillian is also a disaster lesbian, so it works. Her deadname is gone forever; and, for that matter, so are [[[Don't Let Me Forget|all of her memories]]] of being a child. It's fine, probably. Don't worry about it. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-gears Dr. Charles Gears] (\"COG\"):** A man [[[epitaph| strangely lacking]]] in [[[termination-log-scp-1016| emotional response]]] (to the point of lacking a startle response) and possessing unusual levels of [[[lullaby| logic and intellect]]]. Former Euclid-class object specialist before having his area of study expanded. Has been deeply involved with research regarding a truly shocking number of SCP objects both major and minor. A figure of [[[in-his-own-image| great influence]]] in recent Foundation [[[rounderhouse-proposal| history]]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"It is not acceptable to inquire that.\" hide=\"I do what is required.\"]]\nRecords claim he was recruited shortly after the founding of the Foundation... despite his age and personal history not quite matching up to that timeline. A personal fact that few know: He //does// feel emotion, when it's significant. He simply does not react to it or show it. Because he cannot. Why? If there is a reason, few know.\n\nPossibly the father of [[[pawn-to-e4| Alison Chao]]], the woman calling herself the [[[black-queen-hub| \"Black Queen\"]]]. [[[loosen-up-a-bit| Possibly]]] the [[[annon| son]]] of an O5 Council Member.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-glass Dr. Simon Glass]:** Head of Psychology. Trusted with performing [[[Routine Psychological Evaluations By Dr Glass| psychological evaluations]]] of highly ranked Foundation personnel. Very empathetic. Sometimes considered \"soft\" -- and that's true, for a Foundation researcher, but he's still well-trusted. In the course of [[[oneirocritic| his interviews]]], he has gained knowledge of more and more terrible secrets, yet still holds on to both his sanity and empathy.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I talk to everyone, I know everyone...\" hide=\"... Of course I'm loyal.\"]]\nAssociates linked to a number of groups of interest, including the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]] (via a relative) and the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub| Serpent's Hand]]]. Feels self-conscious about how higher-ups view him because of this.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-heiden Dr. Frederick Heiden]:** Neurology specialist. Anxious, uncertain, empathic, focused on logic. Involved in a number of highly classified projects, despite initially being barred from any non-Safe-classed objects.\n[[collapsible show=\"Shhhhhh.\" hide=\"...\"]]\n\nMay be secretly under Dr. Bright's wing. There are... \"plans\" for Heiden. Or... were. Perhaps. Heiden may or may not have been killed and brought back to life; he may or may not in fact be dead, though he is listed as active staff and appears to be playing some kind of role within the Foundation regardless.##white|^^1^^##\n##white|^^1^^he's just heiden'##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-hoygull Dr. Hoygull]:** Sapient seagull.

Despite this, he regularly contributes to internal Foundation intellectual periodicals.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I don't want any more goddamn apples.\" hide=\"And I've never gotten any...\"]]\n\nDr. King's testing must be heavily supervised, due to the [[[game-day-1-die-hardest| presence of apple seeds]]] that seem to be increasing exponentially in intensity.  Intensive observation indicates [[[long-live-the-king| Dr. King]]] is irritated by his seemingly inherent effect.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/mark-kiryu Dr. Mark Kiryu]:** Senior researcher and director of an anomalous items [[[kiryu labs hub | processing lab]]]. Upon initial recruitment, had a successful career as a therapist (licensed psychologist). Worked extensively with [[[SCP-1457]]] in his first years with the Foundation but doesn't talk about that, and has spearheaded several projects involving sapient SCP entities. Cheery attitude and a good listener; looks out for his coworkers and interns like a bit of a mother hen sometimes. Has a ceramic seahorse and potted bamboo on his desk.\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/zyn-kiryu Dr. Zyn Kiryu]:** Highly prolific researcher. Involved in a number of [[[lucky dinosaur| classified]]] Foundation projects. Obsessive, driven, often not eating or sleeping in favor of finishing tasks. Finished her schooling through an [[[snakes and ladders | accelerated program]]] after joining the Foundation. Initially closed-off and withdrawn, but opened up due to a latent ambitious streak. She often volunteers to handle new Foundation member intake, hoping to give new members a positive introduction to an often deeply horrifying organization. Has a private flair for poetry. Has accidentally inherited the absent Dr. Kondraki's affiliation with [[[scp-2332| anomalous butterflies]]], including [[[SCP-408]]] after Kondraki's disappearance.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I didn't ask for this.\" hide=\"You know that's from a game, right?\"]]\n\nHas a brother, Mark Kiryu, a higher-ranked researcher. O5 Command has its eye fixed on Zyn Kiryu for unknown reasons, having dismissed her higher-ranked brother as ultimately irrelevant. She is being watched and investigated by the Red Right Hand -- whether positively or negatively is unknown.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**Dr. Adam Leeward:** [[[baby-s-first-guide-to-keter-class-anomalies-and-other-questi|Emotionally confused]]] and [[[too-old-to-lie-too-cold-to-love| ethically conflicted]]] humanoid containment specialist from Site-11, living in [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81| Site-81]]]. May or may not have made a few mistakes, may or may not have cleaned up a few mistakes. Not without the standard degree of coldness in personality traits, but with a few (sometimes painful) soft spots.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"There's something off about you, Lee.\" hide=\"- Of course, there always was.\"]]\n\nUnder watch for abnormal behavior.

Bears minor facial scarring, and an old injury in her left hand sometimes impairs its functionality. Somewhat traumatic childhood; caretakers forced her to learn outdoor survival by leaving her stranded in the African wilderness for days on end.

Historical records report that a man known as [[[The Deathless Merchant of London]]] has been in the business of buying and selling anomalous objects since long before the establishment of his current organization, although it is unclear if this title has been held by multiple individuals, or by a singular man with an anomalously long life.

Although more recent reports of Marshall, Carter and Dark's activities refer to a Ms. Iris Dark as being in a leadership position, this individual may still be acting on behalf of [[[so-they-called-him-darke| Percival Darke]]], as [[[dark-and-disquieting| merely the latest]]] in [[[the-boy-who-cried-wolf| a series of younger proxies]]] used to obfuscate Darke's involvement.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/iris-dark Ms. Iris Dark]**: The heir to Mr Dark,  [[[Iris Dark]]] is a [[[dark-and-disquieting| technological and thaumaturgical prodigy]]].

In this capacity, Iris Dark has been involved in an ongoing effort to [[[rainbow-crapitalism| improve public perception]]] of Marshall, Carter and Dark within the anomalous community, although she has demonstrated that she can be [[[scp-5802| just as ruthless]]] as her predecessor on multiple occasions. \n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/ruiz-duchamp Ruiz Duchamp]:** --Obscure anartist.-- [[[wowwee-go-kill-ursefl| Dead]]].\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/the-engineer The Engineer]:** Enigmatic leader of the [[[chaos-insurgency-hub| Chaos Insurgency]]], an organisation that seeks to utilise rather than contain the anomalous.

Other reported possibilities for the meaning of L.S. include \"Lonely Serpent\", \"Last Saint\", \"Lost Sinner\", and \"Loki Scar-lip\". Either way, L.S. is definitely only one well-respected \"leader\" among many in the Hand; L.S. is, however, unique in their focus on targeting the SCP Foundation. (Other Hand leaders tend to primarily target the [[[goc-hub-page| Global Occult Coalition]]] as their first priority, with the Foundation coming second.)\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/mari-macphaerson Mari MacPhaerson]**: The Vice President of Public Relations for [[[vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Studies]]], an enigmatic corporation responsible for the creation and distribution of anomalous media. Despite ongoing efforts from the Foundation to bring an end to VKTM's activities, communications from MacPhearson have [[[scp-6123 | consistently]]] been [[[scp-6897 | friendly]]], to the point of being [[[scp-7953 | overly familiar]]] with [[[scp-8889 | Foundation personnel]]]. MacPhearson has also [[[scp-5571 | made appearances]]] in [[[scp-7756 | media produced]]] by VKTM, and was previously the owner of [[[scp-7830 | Viber, an anomalous social media platform]]]. In all footage obtained, MacPhearson's head is bandaged or [[[scp-7165 | otherwise obscured]]], and it is unclear whether or not she has any eyes.\n\n----\n\n**Rukmini Mankanshoku AKA \"The Rookie\":** [[[speed-demon-hub|One half of the Chicago Spectre]]], one of [[[zeitgeist| many successors]]] to the notorious [[[Chicago Spirit]]] crime syndicate. Active throughout the paranormal world, the Rookie's [[[hypervelocity| high-octane]]] [[[terminal-velocity| criminal activities]]] are fuelled by the [[[australian-rules| summoning of demons]]]. \n\nAllegedly detained in [[[Paramax]]], but claims to have been framed by an alternate version of herself [[[the-vice-girls| from another universe]]].\n\n----\n\n**Mr. Marshall:** One of the three [[[acquisitions1| leaders]]] and [[[from-vagrants-to-gentlemen| founders]]] of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshall, Carter and Dark]]], an organization selling anomalous items to the rich and powerful. Information on the upper management of this group is limited and often inconsistent, possibly because [[[when-situations-degenerate| several generations of the same families]]] are involved. According to [[[third-death| some accounts]]], \"Amos\" Marshal is wheelchair-bound, and regularly feeds on human souls in order to remain alive. This is contradicted by [[[mc-d-agent-orientation| other accounts]]] that claim that Marshal is in better health, while Carter is wheelchair-bound.\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/skitter-marshall Skitter Marshall]:** A descendant of the original Mr. Marshal of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub| Marshal, Carter and Dark]]]. Prior to his recruitment into the family business, [[[Skitter Marshall]]] was reportedly an explorer of anomalous Ways, and seeking objects of value for the firm to sell, and [[[get-out-of-her-way| tracking down individuals of interest]]]. While Skitter Marshall has been described as [[[all-that-glisters| merely a Junior Partner]]], only occasionally representing Marshal, Carter and Dark in an [[[masks-monsters-merchants| official capacity]]], by other accounts he now holds a [[[job-opportunities| much more important position]]], succeeding his ancestor as a Senior Partner, and working alongside Iris Dark and Robert Carter as the [[[your-number-one| public face]]] of Marshall, Carter and Dark.\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/midnight-the-cat Midnight]:** Sapient [[[gdp2-tunneling-between-worlds| female cat]]], [[[the-deathless-merchant-of-london| well-regarded member]]] of the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub| Serpent's Hand]]] and [[[searching-for-the-demon-foxes-1|representative]]] of the Serpent's Nest. Known to have anomalous abilities due to thaumaturgical training, or \"magic\".

According to Sarkic mythology, Nadox was once a wandering preacher speaking up for the [[[ancestrecall|poor and marginalised]]], before being captured, mutilated, and designated by the [[[daevite-hub|Daevites]]] as a \"Sufferer\", to be [[[and-the-fact-it-rains|tormented but never killed]]]. At some point Nadox became a [[[of-nadox-and-the-ozirmok| follower of the man]]] that would become known as Grand Karcist Ion. [[[nadox-and-the-mekhanite|Little is known]]] about his activities since the [[[but-thou-shalt-not-despair| fall of Adytum]]], but he is believed to have survived to the [[[memoria-adytum| present day]]], [[[patience| waiting patiently]]] for the right moment to make his [[[the-first-occult-flame-war| presence known again]]].\n\n----\n\n**[[[nobody-hub| \"Nobody\"]]]:** An [[[a-poem-for-nobody| individual]]] who [[[nobody-knows| appears]]] to be under anomalous effects partially [[[nobody-dies| stripping]]] them of their identity in exchange for anomalous ability. [[[the-man-who-wasnt-there-hub| May or may not]]] be multiple people (but only [[[note-a-part-of-nobody| one at a time]]]).

According to myth, Orok joined Ion's rebellion against the [[[daevite-hub| Daevite Empire]]] after being freed from a life as an [[[such-a-world-as-this| enslaved gladiator and guard]]], although other accounts instead describe him as a [[[of-orok-and-the-ozirmok| warrior waging war on the Daeva]]], even before his meeting with Ion.\n\nIn the present day, Orok's mutilated body lies beneath Moscow, worshipped by the Sarkic crime syndicate known as the [[[SCP-2408| Hunter's Black Lodge]]]. While it is unknown whether Orok is currently alive, it is possible he will [[[sarkic-heat| awaken in the future]]] to lend his strength to [[[god-meat-s-back-on-the-menu| a new cause]]].\n\n----\n\n**[/system:page-tags/tag/judy-papill Judith D.

Formerly associated with a US-based [[[how-to-remove-glitter-from-a-polyester-dress|radical feminist art collective]]], she left the country shortly after its collapse.

Sarkic myths describe her as a former servant of the [[[daevite-hub| Daevites]]], sentenced to death for murdering her masters, before being [[[tuae|rescued by Grand Karcist Ion himself]]]. She is described as Ion's [[[of-saarn-and-jade-tongues| assassin and spymaster]]], with the brutal efficacy of her network recorded in graphic detail in surviving [[[old-daevite-language| Daevite writings]]].\n\nLittle is known about her activities following the [[[memoria-adytum| fall of Adytum]]], but she is [[[unto-the-ages|believed to have survived it]]], and to have [[[of-saarn-and-the-ozirmok|remained loyal to Ion]]], [[[exierunt| continuing to target]]] the [[[scp-2834| enemies of Sarkicism]]].

[[[unusual-investigations| The investigations of both agents]]] are of continuing interest to the Foundation. They have collaborated with the Foundation on [[[permanent-waves| several occasions]]], including playing an instrumental role in the joint [[[the-blackbird-and-the-falcon| Foundation/UIU raid]]] of [[[anderson-robotics-hub| Anderson Robotics]]] World Headquarters. Additionally, both agents are members of Joint Task Force Delta-3 (\"Organic Free Trade\"), with Agent Spencer assuming command of the task force during operations in Three Portlands.\n \nAgent Thorne is a natural thaumaturge of moderate ability with extensive occult training; Agent Spencer is believed to be non-anomalous, but has significant experience in paranormal affairs. Both agents make extensive use of paratechnology and occult devices in the field, employing a number of custom items in addition to their standard issue UIU equipment. They should both be considered roughly equal to a Foundation agent in terms of capability and effectiveness.\n\n----\n\n**Sylvain:** [[[Spirit Staff of Eastern Avian Shaman | Bird Mage]]] in training, uses \"Ailier\" as a courtesy surname when prompted (allegedly, his family name is something that only birds can pronounce correctly).
