While this method has been largely successful in ensuring hostile deific entities do not gain significant traction in mainstream culture and religious practices, current reactive measures to emergent threats are often inadequate.

In its current use, a totem -- an item conceptually associated with a specific deific entity -- is inserted into the device, which subsequently identifies and traces the boundaries of the relevant deific entity within the Nöosphere.

Having identified and isolated the targeted deific entity within the Nöosphere via SCP-6659-A, SCP-6659-B applies a conceptual framework of universal acceleration to all individual data points forming the memetic construct. As a result, the data composing the deific entity is accelerated to supra-conceptual velocities -- whereby the individual components of the memetic construct can only be conceived in relation to their relative, accelerated movement. As a result, the lines of conceptual relations that form the construct weaken and subsequently dissolve, rendering the construct incapable of cohesively existing as an assemblage within the Nöosphere, and thus preventing any interaction between datapoints -- both external and internal to the construct.\n\n* **SCP-6659-C:** //Gen.

The Foundation -- for all its grandiose notions and ideas, its flirtations with concepts beyond the veil of normality -- remains an institution of bricks, mortar, bodies, and paper. //Applied Metaphysics// does not reject this notion: we need to know where our limitations are, as it's the only way to push beyond them.\n\nSCP-6659 is a culmination of that drive to extend beyond the physical. While the Nöosphere permeates every aspect of our lives -- what it means to think, what we can and cannot conceive of -- our ability to alter it has been unrefined at best. When it comes to non-physical threats, the Foundation requires a new approach to accomplish its goal: the securing, containment, and protection of humanity, and resultantly normalcy, at all costs. We have been dying aimlessly in the dark, hoping to pull it off. We needed to become the scalpel, capable of exorcising specific dangers with negligible damage to those living in the light.\n\nThat's where Deicidium comes in. While these memetic constructs are worshipped as deities, they each are only another Anomaly to be understood and will be treated as such. Those who threaten the Foundation will be contained, their influence and danger mitigated, and the world will keep turning.\n\nWelcome to the team.

Our modern society elevates nearly every facet of contemporary life beyond its inherent value and means: Democracy, Family, Capitalism; each of such concepts defines our relationship to the world. These concepts are in flux; they change and shift based on individual minds, informed by their beliefs and their local collective consciousnesses, developing new forms with cultural shifts over time.\n\nWhat is the distinction between such a concept and a deific entity? The difference we may point to is that these concepts are inert unless acted upon, responsive to the human, rather than engaged reciprocally. However, recent findings indicate this is a false assumption. We've begun to see that these concepts //do respond//: they influence us in ways we do not fully yet understand. Perhaps it is an issue of malice; does the conceptual entity wish us harm, to change our understanding of the world? But even then, the distinction is murky: does a new political theory, relationship to nature, or revolutionary technology not potentially straddle this divide? Have we not seen the world shift and change, responsive to what were presumed to be non-Anomalous processes and influences?\n\nThe process of apotheosis, so prevalent in our shared myths, is ill-understood at best. We claim to know what a god is, intrinsically, if not rationally, but are ignorant as to how exactly they are formed within our collective conscious. Our Foundation, a secret gathering of people working towards a common goal, elevating the notion of Securing, Containment, and Protection, may not seem so dissimilar from the faith-driven groups we target.\n\nThis project is necessary, yes; but it is a grave uncertainty. This is a new relationship between humans and the divine, and the very relation itself is a concept which, if elevated via worship, could have grave implications on the structure of reciprocity in deification. We risk idolizing the destruction of our idols, and we know not what ground we tread in doing so.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument widetable\"]]\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]ADDENDUM 6659/III:[[/span]] Activation Log\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nACTIVATION NUMBER: 001\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**TOTEMIZED OBJECT:** [[span style=\"filter: blur(4px);\"]]SCP-055, the skull of the last monarch of the //Homo sapiens invisibili//, a human subspecies which coexisted with //Homo sapiens sapiens// until their latent antimemetic properties became evident, motivating their non-Anomalous relatives to enact their genocide over the course of the 19th century.[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**WORSHIP GROUP:** [[span style=\"filter: blur(4px);\"]]Disciples of the Unseen[[/span]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**RESULTS:** [[span style=\"filter: blur(4px);\"]]Successful identification and acceleration of memetic construct.

With the tanks rupturing and everything, the whole system went haywire -- sorry, getting ahead of myself. Everyone here knows [SCP-6659]-C monitors previously-accelerated memetic constructs in the Nöosphere, to make sure everything goes as it should, meaning there's no latent activity within the dissociated construct. We call that baseline state \"sterile\"; assuming SCP-6659 functioned as intended, this entails no interaction between data points which previously composed the construct. Well, while reviewing the data, we noticed some activity in the data cluster of a deific entity that we'd previously successfully accelerated beyond conception. These slides are representations from SCP-6659-C over a 6-hour period -- sorry, how do I...?\n\n**Dr. John Blake:** Right-side of the pointer.\n\n**Tech. Sawdye:** There we go.

This is highly irregular, as you may be able to -\n\n**Dr. Milton:** Rupert, sorry. Are you suggesting that this previous activation didn't function properly?\n\n**Tech. Sawdye:** No, that's the odd part. The activation was completely successful, we've double-checked all the relevant data. This is the only irregularity; while it's entirely normal for new lines of conceptual association to form as human conception expands and changes, our use of SCP-6659 should have rendered this impossible.\n\n**Dr. Blake:** So this was spontaneous? Just a random series of interactions?\n\n**Tech. Sawdye:** That is one theory, yes -- but, uhm.\n\n**Dr. Milton:** Go on, Rupert.\n\n**Tech. Sawdye:** Well, that sort of... //spontaneity// doesn't seem feasible, given our understanding of Nöospherics and SCP-6659. It's a linked network, things respond to each other, but the individual points within this data cluster were completely isolated. They didn't just interact along previous lines of relation, either -- they formed new ones. Something like that requires this section of the cluster to be acted //upon,// but as we've already covered --\n\n**Dr. Blake:** Do you mean to suggest that something //external// to the Nöosphere caused this?\n\n**Tech.

Place H. McD., PhD., Project Lead, Esoteric Polymath\nExcerpt from Classified Project Update\n[[/=]]\n\n----\nAllow me to bring you up to speed.\n\nThe Nöosphere can be thought of as the set of all ideas humans are capable of conceptualizing. It can also be thought of as a \"collective consciousness\". However, much more literally, it is the aggregate of the informational structures contained within all human brains, ie. the sum total of exactly all conscious and subconscious thoughts humans are having at any given instant. Recent studies go so far as to suggest that every bit of noetic information within human thoughtspace corresponds directly to a unique neuron, or category thereof, in some number of human brains.\n\nThis has serious implications upon the consequences of Project Deicidium and SCP-6659. Consider what the machine does: by mapping a collection of concepts associated with an idolized, personified ideal, it alters said concepts such that connections between them cannot form within the Nöosphere. The individual conceptual elements can still be comprehended, but the ideatic construct of the targeted deity is no longer perceptible. If we are to understand that these conceptual elements map to physical segments of the human brain, much more is being severed than just deific relations.\n\nIn the six months since Incident Ø-E5/B, various forms of mental degradation have been observed in minor fractions of the population, including increased rates of early-onset dementia, aphasia, dysphasia, and acute paralysis; various disinformation campaigns have been enacted to hide such. The likelihood of such developments appear to be vastly more common in individuals whose primary entities of worship were those decommissioned via SCP-6659. Evidently, the complex nature of conceptual association is not, and likely functionally cannot be, understood by humans.\n\nWhat's more troubling is the extra-Nöospheric entity Dr. Blake gave his life to discover. His final actions represent an unprecedented leap of faith in the direction of an entity beyond conception -- one we should hardly be able to cogitate. Dr. Blake's faith was shattered by SCP-6659, resulting in a vacuum of worship -- yet, the brain is an adaptive instrument, and his began searching for bigger, more powerful ideas. And the idea //noticed//. We have forced human cognition to expand into deeper, uncharted waters, and we are unprepared for the horrors which lay there.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument table2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[span class=\"st\"]]OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES:[[/span]] The goal of Project Prometheum is to combat extra-Nöospheric threats via channeled worship of the ideal of Humanity, as achieved through the following vectors:\n\n* **PHASE ALPHA:** Project Prometheum, itself, is to be extrapolated from Humanity- and Normalcy-aligned ideals, personified as Titan-Class Olympian Entity-014 (\"Prometheus\"). This deity's identity as progenitor and assistant of human civilization and development, punished unfairly by its brethren, is to be propagated as a memetic construct by all possible non-disruptive vectors, including manipulation of education systems, entertainment industries, and religious Groups of Interest, Anomalous or otherwise.\n\n* **PHASE BETA:** Extra-Nöospheric ideatic constructs are to be generally ignored by as many personnel as possible while maintaining efficacy in Project Prometheum's operations. Following its manufactured re-apotheosis, Prometheus is to be elevated to the highest feasible level of worship, allowing highly beneficial reciprocal worship in Humanity due to the core tenets of its conceptual makeup.\n\n* **PHASE GAMMA:** Through systematized large-scale prayer by Foundation personnel, Promethean analysis is to locate potential hostile Extra-Nöospheric entities and isolate their constituent quanta into human-safe fragments. These fragments, themselves, must be targeted in tandem by Prometheus and SCP-6659, taking extreme care to re-render them dormant (as they were prior to Extra-Nöospheric influence).\n\n* **PHASE DELTA:** Dormant components of human thoughtspace are to be restructured into either the Prometheus-memeplex, or another Humanity- and Normalcy-aligned ideatic construct deemed symbiotic with It. The Nöosphere's gaps are to be filled and fortified such that it possesses the necessary cognitive defenses to handle higher-order concepts.\n\n----\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]STATUS REPORT:[[/span]] A composite of selectively human-safe fragments of the Extra-Nöospheric entity initially encountered by Dr. Blake has been located, and rendered into the following highly-antimemetic iconographic depiction:\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6659/Stars-bg-3.jpg]]\n\nThe following ideatic complexes have been targeted:\n\n* quinary mathematical operations;\n* the primordial ideals of rage, violence;\n* the perception of many disparate points as composing some larger shape (ie. constellation);\n* the arbitration of optimistic ideals into unreasoned/indefensible motivations (ie. defeatism);\n* [[span style=\"filter: blur(4px);\"]]the exhilaration of severing a finger from a squirming human hand (ie. transcendence).[[/span]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"admo-end_card\"]]\n[[div class=\"admo-credits\"]]\n[[div]]\n+ [[span class=\"ctrl\"]]ADMO[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[[span class=\"cond\"]]FEATURING @@ @@ **DODODEVIL**[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"cond\"]]WITH ART BY @@ @@ **DODODEVIL**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6658]]] | SCP-6659 | [[[SCP-6660]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"» SHOW FOOTNOTES «\" hide=\"« HIDE FOOTNOTES »\"]]\n[[div class=\"notation\" style=\"padding: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9em;\"]]\n[[<]]\n++++ @@      @@ FOOTNOTES & REFERENCES\n\n# Antiquated term for Nöosphere.\n# Jollymore, //Deific Manifestations: Past & Present,// 1988.\n# Deicidium-class anomalies are employed by the Foundation in the decommissioning of other Anomalous phenomena.\n# Initially developed by Dr. Vivian Elmwoods for the conceptual mapping of communal human consciousness, authorized in completion of the GOTTFRIED Research & Development initiative.
