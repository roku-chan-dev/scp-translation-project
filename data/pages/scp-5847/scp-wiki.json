A pair of guards are stationed at each entrance. No food is to be brought inside SCP-5847.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5847 is the food court of the Rhodes Plaza Mall in Newcastle, Australia. It has two main anomalous effects. \n\nThe first is that whenever a subject consumes food inside SCP-5847, it will morph into SCP-5847-1, a courtroom. SCP-5847-1 is fully populated by SCP-5847-2, which are sapient, animate foods resembling their non-anomalous counterparts in appearance but with the ability to anomalously perceive, vocalize, and locomote[[footnote]] Research into how SCP-5847-2 are able to do so is ongoing.[[/footnote]]. It has been hypothesized from recordings that all SCP-5847-2 instances inside SCP-5847-1 are food the subject has eaten throughout their life.\n\nOnce inside SCP-5847-1, the subject is transformed into a near facsimile of their previous appearance, but composed of what appears to be a thick cake icing. They must then defend the fact they eat food to a large piece of sugar candy. The only two rulings observed, have been that the subject is not guilty and free to go wherein SCP-5847-1 morphs back into SCP-5847, or that the subject is guilty of \"crimes against Humunchkind\" and is sentenced to death wherein an Execucumber will consume the subject whole.\n\nThe secondary effect of SCP-5847 is a memetic effect affecting anyone inside the courtroom that causes them to unintentionally replace words they say with the names of foods. \n\n\n\n**Addendum 5847-1 Transcription of security camera footage from a trial held inside SCP-5847-1:**\nThe following was recovered from a security camera set up in SCP-5847. For readability, the instances colloquial names have been used in place of SCP-5847-2[[footnote]] -A is referred to as Fudge, -B is referred to as Bailoaff, -C is referred to as Tomattorney, -D is referred to as Procharcuterie, and -E is referred to as Excecucumber.

It was early in the morning when that deviled man kidnapped me and my fellow eggs. We could tell he was carton us off to his murder room[[footnote]] Presumed to be their name for a kitchen.[[/footnote]].
