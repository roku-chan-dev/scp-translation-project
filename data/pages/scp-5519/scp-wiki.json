Further evidence of current SCP-5519-1 instances are to be investigated immediately, and information related to the composition and methods of creating SCP-5519-1 are to be considered the top priority when testing with existing SCP-5519-1 instances.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5519 is the official designation of a TK-Class Casual Restructuring Event, which most likely took place from 11/4/21 to 14/4/21. The effects of reality-based anomalies are usually impossible to determine, specifically what aspects of fundamental reality were damaged or replaced. However, the existence of SCP-5519-1 suggests that SCP-5519 was localized to a very small subdivision of physical matter. Investigations into the full extent and effects of SCP-5519 are ongoing.\n\nSCP-5519-1 is material that has evidently survived SCP-5519, and has extensive properties: \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-5519 Documented Traits\" hide=\"- [CLOSE FILE]\"]]\n\n> \n> * SCP-5519-1 is an off-white, oblong cylinder, approximately a foot in length.\n> \n> * SCP-5519-1 is noticeably moist, and residue from SCP-5519-1 will remain on substances or organisms that have come into contact with SCP-5519-1 for extended periods of time.\n> \n> * SCP-5519-1’s exterior is hard to the touch, although additional force causes its interior structure to buckle rapidly, giving the appearance of a dent where pressure was applied. Moderate amounts of damage are repaired, as the interior supports swell against the area of compression shortly after it has occured. The full extent of SCP-5519-1’s defensive abilities are not currently known.\n> \n> * SCP-5519-1 is evidently populated by fungal, eukaryotic organisms throughout the webbing of SCP-5519-1’s interior structure. Very few instances are currently living, as the vast majority of these organisms expired after or during SCP-5519. Due to possible signs of intelligence and the fungi not mapping to known species, they are henceforth referred to as SCP-5519-A.\n> \n> * Cross-sections of SCP-5519-1 show that the object was evidently under extreme temperature for a moderate period of time, which may have contributed to SCP-5519-1’s deformed appearance. It is currently estimated that this effect was an indirect result of SCP-5519.\n> \n> * SCP-5519-1 emits a noticeable scent, although no longer as potent as upon retrieval. Various tests have uniformly described SCP-5519-1’s smell as “pleasing”, “rich”, and “tangy”.\n> \n> * A collection of various green growths, presumably incorporated onto SCP-5519-1’s surface by SCP-5519-A after the TK-Class Event due to the lack of charring on these growths. They are attached to the upper exterior of SCP-5519-1.\n> \n> * Material analysis of SCP-5519-1 reveals that many substances incorporated into its design are of organic origin, despite the unknown, brittle material makeup of SCP-5519-1. A more recent theory on SCP-5519-1’s primary function is that the object was constructed by SCP-5519-A as a residential location, in a similar fashion to how human-built structures are made from naturally occuring material. A combination of substances used in construction does not result in the structure qualifying or appearing organic, which is possibly the case for SCP-5519-A’s involvement regarding SCP-5519-1.\n> \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum:** On 17/4/21, mass gatherings of SCP-5519-A became visible on the surface of SCP-5519-1, presumably creating repairs or otherwise modifying SCP-5519-1. In direct response to this behavior, the original recovery site of SCP-5519-1 and the surrounding area were investigated extensively, uncovering SCP-5519-2.\n\nSCP-5519-2 is the official designation of a mildly-damaged doorbell camera, which contains the following footage within the video storage files of the device. Other files were found to be entirely corrupted, and recovery of additional footage would be considered impossible.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **SCP-5519-2 VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 12/4/21\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//A uniformed individual, carrying various small crates, is shown approaching SCP-5519-2, before ringing the doorbell (Due to the markings and patches on the individual’s uniform, it is suspected that they possessed some level of military or governmental importance). Several seconds pass, and the presumed owner of SCP-5519-2 is seen opening their door to greet the officer.//\n\n**Transportation Officer:** Hello sir, I’ve got your order right here.\n\n//The officer sets down the stack of crates, and removes the top box before handing it to the other humanoid. The logo of an orange disc with a beige outline is visible on the crates, possibly a symbol representing high status and influence.//\n\n**Receiving Individual:** Thank God, you got here just in time. The game’s almost started, and the fam was starting to get rowdy.\n\n//Due to the mention of a theological figure, it is suspected that either the act of delivery or the contents of these crates possessed religious or ritual significance.//\n\n**Transportation Officer:** Yeah, there was a bit of a wreck on 285, so that took a bit more time.\n\n//The receiving individual opens the swinging lid of the crate, revealing an additional SCP-5519-1 instance.//\n\n**Receiving Individual:** Alright, and the others?\n\n//Over the course of the next minute, the officer identifies the contents of the crates, and hands them over to the individual after the contents of the crates are described. Notably, various clear cylinders are visible, evidently containing bubbling liquid.//\n\n**Transportation Officer:** And there’s the last of the garlic bread.\n\n//At this moment, the footage ends. The phrase “Be Careful What You Wish For” is visible on the screen for a very brief amount of time before cutting to black.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nResearch into SCP-5519-1’s former status as “Garlic Bread” is ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5518]]] | SCP-5519 | [[[SCP-5520]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
