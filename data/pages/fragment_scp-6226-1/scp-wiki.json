It uses its attached oars to ambulate through the water. It is very friendly with personnel and will float along the edge of its enclosure following anyone passing by its fence.\n\n**Addendum-6226.1 Anomaly Transferral:**\nDue to the Boring Agreement, since SCP-6226 was discovered in Crater Lake, it is planned to be transferred to GoI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions) for documenting and care. A full document from WWS is expected upon its arrival.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"â–¡ Email Relations â–¡\" hide=\"â–£ Email Relations â–£\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Tim Wilson\n**From:** Dr. Jerimiah Greene\n**Subject:** New Anomaly\n[[/div]]\n------\nWe have come into the possession of a new anomaly.

Quite docile. He even likes to follow around our staff when they come to greet him! I will attach a photo of the enclosure he is currently being kept in.

We haven't had many birds some in our doors for a while. Everyone's very excited to meet him! I'm especially intrigued as I've been wanting to care for a Shoebill for quite a while. I've also come up with a name, Eddie!\n\nThat enclosure seems a little small. We've picked out a nice roomy habitat for him. We suspect he'll love it! The enclosure is nice, but I do wish we could see his smiling face! Speaking of Eddie, what anomalous properties should we be expecting?\n[[>]]\nTim Wilson\nWWS\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Tim Wilson\n**From:** Dr. Jerimiah Greene\n**Subject:** Re:New Anomaly\n[[/div]]\n------\nThere isn't much you'll need to worry about vis-Ã -vis anomalous traits. My only gripe about him is he doesn't need to eat or sleep (His squawking could get a little loud during the night!). But for the most part, he's just like a baseline shoebill. I've packed a copy of the full documentation we have on him (including some wonderful photos from our on-site amateur photographer that are just so lovely) along with him in the truck we're sending him to you in.
