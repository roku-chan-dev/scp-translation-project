All operation of SCP-001-TOME is to be directed by the Commander — however, preparations are to be made so SCP-001-TOME can operate autonomously in the event that the Commander is obliterated. This will ensure that SCP-001-TOME can remain operational as long as possible following the extinction of conscious life.\n\nAll signals intercepted by SCP-001-TOME are to be recorded and filed within its central computer. In order to prevent other entities from attempting to salvage or take control of SCP-001-TOME, no signals are to be sent out from the station under any circumstances.\n\nThe Singular Conceptual Bunker (SCB) located within SCP-001-TOME is not to be disturbed under any circumstances.\n\n**Description:** SCP-001-TOME is an installation designed to serve as a memorial following the extinction of conscious life via intercepting the final transmissions of civilizations prior to obliteration. It is spherical in shape, fifty meters in diameter, and concealed from detection using a number of cloaking systems. In order to remain functioning as long as possible, the engine contained at the heart of SCP-001-TOME is capable of producing power via the harvesting of ambient hypothetical energy. \n\nThe artificial intelligence operating SCP-001-TOME's systems also serves as a filter for signals being intercepted, allowing the majority of junk data to be deleted while retaining statements of historical and sentimental value. Note that this artificial intelligence has not passed the Yover Test, and is thus not conscious enough to qualify for obliteration.\n\nFollowing the simultaneous obliteration of two-hundred and nine human colonies in the year 7329, it was determined that the continued existence of conscious life was no longer possible. In order to ensure information regarding conscious life survived as long as possible, the previously defunct SCP-001-TOME project was revived and launched.\n\nAt the time of writing, SCP-001-TOME has been in operation for [BUFFER_OVERFLOW] years.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum 001-TOME-01 (Transmission Record)**\n\nThe following is a record of relevant transmissions filed within SCP-001-TOME. Note that this is only a partial record — a full database is stored within the SCP-001-TOME computers.\n\n> **Location:** Lucifer, Human Colony\n> **Filed By:** The Commander\n> \n> **Message:** //\"Hello, is there anyone here? We — we require assistance! There's ... it's ... it's taking people every day! We need help! There's barely anyone left! We need help! Hello? Hello?!\"//\n\n> **Location:** Venn-Guabala, Anti-Human Religious Site\n> **Filed By:** The Commander\n> \n> **Message:** //\"Cabal 09:43! We have abandoned the false flesh! We have abandoned the false flesh! The shepherds crook broken 'neath my knee! Cabal 09:43! Cabal 09:43! Forgive us! Forgive us!\"//\n\n> **Location:** Kitchen Sink, Human Colony\n> **Filed By:** The Commander\n> \n> **Message:** //\"We're going to leave this on. It's so dark outside now. It's blotting out the sun. It's ... I have to go now.\"//\n\n> **Location:** X92, Android Commune\n> **Automatically Filed**\n> \n> **Message:** //\"RESPOND•FIRST•CONVENIENCE EMERGENCY•SITUATION•DEVELOPING REQUIRE•ADDITIONAL•RESOURCES\"//\n\n> **Location:** Ocean Hate, Thoughtspace\n> **Automatically Filed**\n> \n> **Message:** //\"My fault.
