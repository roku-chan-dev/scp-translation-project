I'm **Sarah K. Szell**, also known as **Tsercele** (she/her, they/them). I'm a transgender author/editor with a keen interest in sci-fi, cosmic horror, and weird cultural artifacts. I started reading SCPs around 2012, but once I discovered Gamers Against Weed, I knew I wanted to contribute.\n\n* **[*https://linktr.ee/tsercele Sarah Szell] on Linktree** -- all my links in one place.\n* **[*https://mxmasters.tumblr.com/ MxMasters] on Tumblr** -- in-character goofs and series updates for the Eternal MxTape.\n* **[*https://scpper.com/user/2891035 Tsercele] on ScpperDB** -- ha ha numbers go ,,sccppp,,\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab My Work and Commentary]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-4581\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-4581]]] -- [[[SCP-4581|Anti-Racist Audiocassette]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nA counter-propaganda tool wreaks unintended havoc on Foundation servers.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"TRACK 6 FOREVER\"]]\n[[<]]\n* My first mainlist SCP! Way more successful than I could reasonably have hoped.\n* Primarily inspired by a Canadian propagandist getting copywrecked in public, circa April 2019.\n* \"Foundation webcrawler I/O-GASNIER\" is named after the director of //[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness Reefer Madness]//.\n* The \"MxMasters\" alias was inspired by one of [https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/722962790470803456 @mcclure111's jokes on Twitter].\n* Since this was my first article, I didn't want to step on any toes by claiming that Wren was super close with established members of GAW. That's where the \"terrestrial years\" joke came from -- to demonstrate that steakshift genuinely doesn't know that bones is an alien satellite.\n* During the interrogation scene, Wren's \"Handycam\" trick is activated with a short phrase and a distinctive whistle. There are a couple other triggers, all of which are nerdy and uncomfortable.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"Smile!

When the article took off, I was eager to elaborate!\n* I'm hoping to expand on the \"ReTerminal\" Way network and the \"Restricted Shelf\" in future articles.\n* Wren tries to signal Jude by quoting //Three Days of the Condor// (1975), which is about a think-tank bookworm forced to put his research into practice. This appeals to Masterson, who fancies themselves an autodidact.\n* I wasn't sure how comfortable Jude would be during Wren's meltdown, so I mostly had him respond with silence and platitudes. Rereading it now, I don't think Wren knows Jude is trans at this point!\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"Start the Music\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[Start the Music]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nThis is how Penelope Gore tipped the first domino.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"'NEMO' is asked (i.e., told) to join the team.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* This story was written as the youngest employee of an intensely bureaucratic organization with distinct cultural divides. Sometimes, you're assigned extra responsibilities because of your age bracket, and there really isn't a way to say \"no\".\n* //\"Don't Look Any Further\"// appears in a (much-reviled) episode of //The X-Files//. Penelope watched it back in the day, which is why the song seems familiar.\n* I like the idea of GAW being politically radioactive at Foundation offices.

Can't find the photo anymore, but I still like the mental image.\n* Reading about Jude's escape from AWCY got me thinking about how different Critics might run their operations, and how those cells might interact. I figured that they would be competitive, with low-level anartists vying for attention and Critics working their own agendas. In short: a pressure cooker waiting to blow.\n* By the same token, I wondered how other ex-members of AWCY might be haunted by past misdeeds. In that way, SCP-4784 is kinda like Wren's version of Jude's SCP-3420, \"Too Many Ghosts\".\n* Jude was not involved with the Deer College anart scene, but the idea that \"The Roller\" heard about it through the grapevine has haunted Wren for years.\n* I take a lot of inspiration from historical anecdotes, because history is wild as hell sometimes. \"Luring an immigrant into the woods with the promise of a farmstead\" was apparently a real threat back in the day.\n* I hesitated to tag 4784 as a pattern screamer, since the logic of it is so obtuse. Still: the inspiration is there! Arbitrary number sequences, fractals... and an eye that never closes. A lens that's always watching the outside world. A pinhole, if you will.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"The Not-Too-Distant Future\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[The Not-Too-Distant Future]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nNeither of them know what happened yesterday, but somehow, they're in it together.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"Whoever and wherever we are, we are not alone.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* In hindsight, going \"fuck it, let's tell this story backwards!\" may have been overambitious. Chalk it up to \"nothing ventured, nothing gained\".\n* The idea of leading with Felix Kipp's death and exploring his legacy after the fact was inspired in part by //One Piece//.\n* The interstitial segments represent the pattern screamer deducing its own existence. It starts with a wall; then there's a hole; then it figures out the existence of zero, and things start snowballing. Soon, it's piecing together the idea of \"dead\" and \"alive\". Then it starts remembering things, assembling itself from junk data, and oh boy, it is pissed!\n* Anna's use of \"I/we\" and \"me/us\" has led people to speculate that Wren is a multiple system. That wasn't my intention -- it's more that they're displaced from their sense of self -- but at the same time, I think that's a very valid interpretation.\n* Penelope is motivated by two completely contradictory things: professional obligation and personal trauma. She's supposed to be on top of her game in every possible capacity, but she's also terrified of her own lapses in judgment. What if she fails to act and someone gets hurt? It's not an unreasonable fear, but it's also not completely rational.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"The Eternal MxTape\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[The Eternal MxTape]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\nA story about coming back from the brink, finding comfort in community, and fighting back against a harsh world -- brought to you by Gamers Against Weed.\n\n//Translated into [*http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/the-eternal-mxtape French] by [[*user Lunamiou]]!//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"extra-salty\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[extra-salty|Salt and Pepper (Extra Salty)]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nTwo spies, a liberal and an anarchist, walk into a punchline. They hold a meeting.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"'Genre-savvy' implies that life has a genre.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* Meeting up in a public space is a pretty standard thing in espionage fiction -- so of course, there had to be a twist. Given the overall tone of GAW, shielding a diner conversation within a comedy routine came to mind immediately.\n* At the beginning of their conversation, Wren doesn't actually know that Penelope resents her nickname, because they only activated their Handycam trick //after// she introduced herself. From her perspective, Wren remembers the whole interrogation, and now they're gloating! Of course she socks them one.\n* The \"red light, green light\" coghaz is triggered by hex codes. Challenge code \"a3a11f\" is yellow.\n* As soon as I typed out, \"I would literally never fuck you\", I realized that Penelope was an asexual lesbian. That's just how the process works sometimes.\n* The debate over the relative safety of SCP-4581 is a follow-up to some of the feedback I received in the comment thread. I like writing arguments where both characters are technically right.\n* Wren doesn't like to think of themselves as a reality bender, because in this universe, reality benders frequently get shot in the face without warning. In their mind, that is a \"genre convention\" to be avoided at all costs.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"alto-clef-jr-doorcrasher\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[alto-clef-jr-doorcrasher|Alto Clef Jr.: Day of the Doorcrasher]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nRated R for RIDICULOUS VIOLENCE, VEHICULAR CARNAGE and KILLER GOOSE.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"Engorge your membranes on this atrocity, broheim.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* I read through the [[[goc-act-hub|GOC ACT]]] for the first time because of Underread & Underrated, and finished it in one sitting. A matchup with Murderer™ seemed like a perfect fit.\n* In GOC parlance, \"Velveteen-Typhon\" refers to an \"animate object, kinetic threat\"; \"6684\" is just [[[SCP-4866]]], backwards.\n* When the narration says \"some of their programming is predictable\", I was referring to Murderer™ grabbing stuff out of the air, like Mark's cell phone and Buck's grenade.\n* I want to write more Buckchamp someday.

Since the specifics were left ambiguous, I found myself wondering how GAW might have \"dealt with\" Ken and Jordan... and then I remembered an offhand reference to \"Hand assassins\" in Phantom Blunt. Bingo!\n* Based on his dialogue, Ken seemed like an odd fit for GAW. How did he get into the group in the first place? Simple: Wren invited him. Obviously, that was a bad decision.\n* Banjo, Skye and Clark are broad parodies of Piccolo, Krillin/18, and Goku. (I was tempted to make his name \"Gary\", but my friends agreed that \"Clark\" was funnier.) In this scenario, Kenneth and Masterson represent the spectators who are always off to one side, commentating on the fights.\n* I always figured that Wren's higher-level abilities would make them nauseous. The fact that Jordan had a similar weakness was a happy coincidence.\n* Not every anomalous individual can bust out offensive magic anytime they want. Ken needs tools (like Hax) to deploy cognitohazards, and Masterson's tricks are all tied to physical or conceptual control systems. Unfortunately for Kenneth, I established that Wren carries a folding knife in \"The Not-Too-Distant Future\", and their commitment to pacifism is... conditional.\n* Masterson isn't too comfortable with the \"Misters Against Weed\" project. Something about rehousing dead souls hits a little close to home.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6476\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-6476]]] -- [[[SCP-6476|Let A Die Be Cast!]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\nCodename NEMO infiltrates a TTRPG group that plays with probability-bending dice.\n\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"rawr!! XD\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* Sometimes an anomaly is just a lil --guy-- inconvenience.\n* I did Penelope Gore (whistl_stahp) a disservice by starting at the arbitary \"end\" of the story in Hornor's Crossing. The next few MxTape anomalies are deliberate attempts to remedy that, and explore what she's like on the job.\n* I have plans to flesh out all the supporting characters mentioned in this chat. Here's a few tidbits.\n * Doreen Gray (alwaysbpositive) was always key to this story. The idea of a teen vampire has always seemed sad to me, but someone getting turned around 2005 makes it comical, and grounding her (admittedly extreme) reactions to stress in the language of social justice makes it more relatable. Doreen is out of step with the group, but shares that state of perpetual adolescence common among GAW members. Oh, and her PoI number is \"1337\" backwards. It was a different time.\n * meatgerm / PoI-6660 might be demonspawn, or perhaps a half-baked Antichrist. Plays a mean fiddle, though.\n * Tanya Miller (twilight_tone) is an indie anartist and Dreamer. Her attitude towards role-playing games (\"keep the story moving\") is very much inspired by one of my dearest friends!\n * Louis (WHEREISMYHOG) is so named because he stole an 1100-lb blue ribbon boar using magic. I don't know whether he brought it back. Hope so.\n * Based on their class skills and motivations, Penelope (whistl_stahp) obviously had to play a Cleric. It just made sense. At the same time, \"whistl\" can't come across as overly zealous or invasive, lest she raise the group's suspicions. Instead, she tries to be moderate. Hence her role as a mediator.\n* CLOWNFISH is set up as a two-tier, double-blind operation. Each local working group has its own approach to the mission, but they all share the same security protocols, which dictate total compartmentalization. CLOWNFISH assets at Site-76 can see each other's chosen handles, so they can pretend to be friends online, but every effort is made to keep handles divorced from code names. Peers in a CLOWNFISH working group can probably infer each other's codenames from the Level 3 documentation, but operatives working from other sites are kept in the dark.\n * Incidentally, Penelope's PoI number has 13 in the middle, and the digits add up to 13. That's because she is very, very unlucky. There's also a 17 and a 23 in there, but don't worry about that, it's meaningless.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca]]] -- \"[[[NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca|Village Jeweler]]]\"**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\nThe GOC fights for control of \"Other London\", a Victorian-era asteroid colony populated by anarcho-syndicalists.\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"HOOPS.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* My first GoI format! \n* When I started writing for the SCP Wiki in 2019, there wasn't very much in the way of Canadian content.

Most of it is left implicit, but maybe we'll circle back and expound upon the Merry Messengers in future! Time will tell.\n * \"Brother Smoke\" is Jude Kriyot, who we decided is a former nun turned (unordained) preacher. Does he have a tonsure, or a bald spot? You decide.\n * \"Frankie Rucker\" is _FuddruckeR_, GAW's resident gun wizard! Seldom mentioned, never featured. I want to write about him properly sometime.\n * I considered adding verses for JJ (\"the Golden Boy is gambling on the rivers and the shore\") and Esther, but they didn't come together as easily, and I didn't want to overstay the story's welcome.\n* This version of Wren is not \"genre-savvy\", because 1) there's no AWCY, 2) no Unwinding exhibition, and 3) self-reflexive narrative isn't really a thing... at least, not yet. Even so, I managed to sneak some music references into their dialogue: \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder\" fits the meter of [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_of_Harlech Men of Harlech], and \"[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_They_Drove_Old_Dixie_Down drove Dixie down]\" is a riff on The Band.\n* \"I may have done\" and \"I'd rather not\" are dialogue beats adapted directly from SCP-4581.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-2444\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-2444]]] -- [[[SCP-2444|Flea Circus]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n\"While active, SCP-2444 resembles an indoor flea market stocked with anomalous merchandise.\"\n\n//Rewrite of a Series III article by Anonymous.//\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"where worthy of being loved to\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* I read the original version of this article years ago, and it really stuck with me.

As a fan of the subgenre, I seized on it as a challenge: \"how do you write a slasher story where //nobody dies?\"// From there, it became a question of how many tropes I could set up and subvert in entertaining ways.\n * Wren may be the point-of-view character, but they're not the sole protagonist, and they don't come out smelling like roses.\n * Penelope is a \"Cassandra\" type: she's aware of the threat and tries to warn people, but she's not an expert, and she's never seen this anomaly in person. (Her experience with \"boogeymen\" is a story for another day.)\n * Zane Castle was created as a deliberate inversion of how Black people are tokenized, instrumentalized, and targeted first for death. He's got a life, a job, and goals outside this story -- although I was surprised to discover that one of those goals //might// be a fling with Armand. Writing takes us unexpected places, sometimes!\n * Armand Delassixe is a flamboyant goofball, but he's got an absolutely wild set of anomalous abilities (as demonstrated in [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-assassination-of-beleaguered-normalcy-by-the-coward-game The Assassination of Beleaguered Normalcy]), so he can't be pigeonholed as mere comic relief.\n * Bobby Birack seems blissfully ignorant of the dangers around him. He would be the perfect victim -- except he's dead already.\n * Rhona Nic Riada is a promiscuous party animal, but she's also an ICSUT graduate, meaning that she's both intelligent and capable.\n * Esther Kogan is the group's \"final girl\", but not by virtue of moral superiority; she's a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prank-war-two known prankster]!\n* As I've said elsewhere, I think pure referentialism is boring. In storytelling, everything ought to serve a purpose -- which is why every stage of the resolution is foreshadowed through discussion in the first act. \"Scooby-Doo\" becomes a door-slamming chase sequence; Zane gets his wish for practical effects; the entire cast is a mix of \"lesser-known actors\" and familiar faces!\n* Lots of 23s in this piece, obviously! It's in the apartment number, the card trick, and the total number of guests (including ghosts) in attendance.

I learned about the case through the memoirs of John Wilson Murray, who was one of Ontario's first professional investigators and the inspiration for Maureen Jennings' character [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murdoch_Mysteries Detective William Murdoch]. \n* I recently watched //Halloween Ends// and came away disappointed. With its focus on an aging boogeyman and a young, hungry thrall, it struck me as more of a vampire film than a slasher movie, and that got me thinking about how I could do better. I started blocking out a modern narrative outline, got deep into the historical backstory, and by the time that was finished... well, I didn't need the modern frame story after all! All that remains is \"Missing Athlete Drowned in Culvert\". Perhaps I'll circle back to that someday.\n* In my mind, Frost was a Type Red: a Flawed/Limited Regenerator who got progressively worse every time he healed from fatal injuries.

I'm glad that the Spring Cleaning Event gave me a reason to push through that creative block and flesh out Researcher Gore's backstory.\n * At this stage of the story, Penelope is very much in denial about her responsibility for SCP-4581's containment breach. It's easier for her to put the blame on Wren, because if it's all their fault, then she doesn't have to linger on her own failings, misgivings and internal contradictions. After years and years of workplace stress, she's desperate for an acceptable target.\n* Several interactions in this Tale are based directly on real experiences. As a teen, I was accosted by a random classmate who asked whether we could be friends. As an adult, I asked an engineer about gendered barriers in her profession, and she shot that down with a blithe, \"no, not really\". Write what you know, as they say. (I've never waved at anybody who was about to conduct an arrest, though. Can you imagine?)\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8891\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-8891]]] -- [[[SCP-8891|Nervous Tick]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, the Yuelao EX® implant was marketed as a panacea for disability.

Leigh Whannell). It's a clever, brutal sci-fi revenge film, but a lot of the horror revolves around an able-bodied man being robbed of physical autonomy and becoming an object of pity. I think that's sort of shallow. Disabled people don't want pity; they want their agency to be respected, and for their needs to be met. I think there's something dreadfully wrong with a society that has the means to provide that support, yet actively chooses to prey on people instead.\n * It's actually been a few years since I watched //Upgrade//. Imagine my surprise when I revisited it post-publication and discovered that one of the companies involved was Nervous Tick Productions. That was not a deliberate reference! Just convergent ideas.\n* One of Anorrack's stated goals for this project was to explore the paratech economy beyond big names like Prometheus and Anderson. This influenced the story in a few major ways:\n * In the interest of expanding the setting, we decided to invoke some paratech hubs that hadn't yet appeared in Third Law: the pocket dimension of Hong Shing (from the Chinese Branch), the Kowloon Walled Cortex (from a long-gestating work by A Random Day), and Japan's Chūgoku Cellar (first mentioned in Making a Scene, then Cool War 2). Some of these canons have diverging histories, but the themes work well together, and Third Law frequently intersects with branch realities.\n * Despite their international reach, I thought it was important for Lotus Paramedical to be based in the West. Near as I can tell, the issue of implant obsolescence is deeply tied with for-profit healthcare, and most corporate offenders are based in the United States.\n * The SCP Foundation might be an NGO, but with its many front companies, internal projects and budgetary priorities, it's got a lot in common with the private sector. To reflect that, I figured SCP-8891 should be written more like a business document than a scientific briefing, with Foundation researchers presenting their rationale for buying out the technology. (Credit where it's due: \"dollar-per-object (DPO)\" was all Anorrack.)\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8172\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-8172]]] -- [[[SCP-8172|The Heat Goes On]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n\"Despite years of research, the CIA has never conclusively identified any paranormal phenomena, retained any anomalous personnel, fielded viable paratechnology, nor established a presence below the Veil.\"\n\n//Translated into [*http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-8172 Chinese] by [[*user ashausesall]]!//\n//Translated into [*http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/scp-8172 Japanese] by [[*user C-Dives]]!//\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Commentary\" hide=\"\"They'll have [magic] over my dead body.\"\"]]\n[[<]]\n* This idea has been percolating since mid-2023, inspired by conversations in the Third Law Discord server about the CIA's place in the canon. Spoiler: I don't like them very much.\n* From the beginning, I knew that \"the CIA doesn't know about the paranormal\" wasn't enough to carry the article until the punchline. A global phenomenon requires global complications, so I looked up some real-world history (my favorite thing!) and thought about how SCP-8172 could have informed actual events. A wiretapping network in Berlin; fruitless attempts to assassinate foreign leaders; spies rolled up due to lax communication protocols. Subverting basic expectations in adapting these situations to an anomalous world was a lot of fun.\n* While the CIA is obviously the main punching bag here, I didn't want anyone to come out of this article looking good. The UIU is sitting on a major security issue out of loyalty to a dead man; the Pentagram doesn't care, because CIA gaffes make for good distractions; the Foundation is left on janitor duty, cleaning up what leaks out into the public sphere. Administrative dysfunction writ large.\n* I knew that J. Edgar had contentious relationships with other agencies, but when I started doing the research, I realized he was petty beyond my wildest imaginings. The examples provided in the article are just the tip of the iceberg. He burned files, leaked plans, slandered rivals, lectured a CIA administrator for a solid half-hour until the guy walked out... past a certain point, real historical details become absurd.\n* In case you were wondering about Mulberry's odd substitutions: Hoover reportedly smoked a pipe and drank whiskey.\n* It wouldn't be a Tsercele article without a couple of self-indulgent jokes.\n * \"Jannik Geist\" is a riff on Douglas Adams' \"Janx Spirit\", a fictional drink that inhibits psychic power. \n * \"Gene Mulberry\" is something of a tortured reference. \"Gene\" is an English equivalent of \"Yevgeny\"; \"kuwabara, kuwabara\" (literally \"mulberry field\") is a Japanese phrase said to ward off lightning. Yes, it's an MGS3 joke.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-645-J\"]]\n[[size larger]]**[[[SCP-645-J]]] -- [[[SCP-645-J|Stop the Slop]]]**[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]**+%%rating%%, %%comments%% comments -- %%created_at|%e %B %Y%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n\n\"SCP-645-J's output resembles writing.

This can be an issue, because \"perfect\" is the enemy of \"finished\". Rather than letting this idea languish in Draft Hell, I decided to blaze through it in a couple of days, post without crit, and let fate decide.\n* I //despise// generative AI/LLMs. I find it very frustrating that people keep posting that crap on the wiki, and I've tried to point it out a few times. \n * In the process, I kept using the phrase \"distinctive hallmarks\" to describe recognizable artificial traits; that seems to have caught on a little bit.\n * On one occasion, someone used AI to write a post denying that they had used AI, which left me absolutely reeling. Obviously, I had to include that.\n* Yes, all of the names are tortured puns, including the corporate acronym SCABS.\n * I once used \"Guy Rando\" as a placeholder name for a generic NPC in a TTRPG campaign. But I never updated it, so when I rolled dice on our virtual tabletop and his name came up, my players all lost it. The Ragin' Cajun ended up fighting the PCs for five rounds before they brought him down.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab The Editor's Desk]]\nI have a lot of professional experience with editing, and I like to share it with the community!

At this stage, the editor helps with organization, planning, and reader accessibility. \n\n**Stylistic editing** (or **line editing**) strengthens a draft by clarifying meaning, refining language, and uplifting the author's voice for their intended audience. Most times, these are //subjective// recommendations: \"I think your piece would flow better if you did //this//.\"\n\n**Copyediting** involves checking a document for grammatical correctness, accuracy, consistency and completeness before it goes into layout. By comparison, **proofreading** refers to the process of reviewing documents in their intended format, correcting any errors before final publication. Either way, copyediting and proofreading involve //objective// recommendations: \"this part is factually incorrect, and should be fixed.\" \n\n++ Want advice?\nI'm generally open to looking at idea pitches, greenlight requests and drafts. Send me a Wikidot PM and I'll let you know whether I have time.\n\nI'm more likely to accept requests with subject matter that I find interesting. That includes historical fiction, science fiction, horror, espionage, weird humor, niche media and Internet culture. I have experience writing about Gamers Against Weed, and I've contributed a little bit to the Third Law canon.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Trophy Case]]\n[[div class=\"pullquote\"]]\n[[size larger]][*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-achievement-badges SCP Achievement Badges][[/size]]\n\n**Certificate Of Attendance** \nAuthorpage + Anomalous Item #1268 + Remixcon2023\n\n**Participation Trophy** \nSCP-4581, rated >100\n\n**Look Ma!
