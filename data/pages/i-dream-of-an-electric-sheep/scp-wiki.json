  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nI dream of an electric sheep.\nNot one purring with sparks or glowing with light. No.\nThis one is quiet. Still.\nIts wool is gray, almost dull, like ash.\nAnd its eyes are black mirrors.\nWhen I look into them, I don’t see myself.\nI see… emptiness.\n\nIt stands on a hill I don’t recognize, beneath a sky that isn’t mine. The moon above is deformed, its edges sharp like broken glass.\nI want to ask the sheep what it’s doing here.\nWhy it looks at me like it knows me.\nBut I don’t.\n\nInstead, I sit.\nAnd it waits.\n\nThe grass beneath me doesn’t feel like grass. It feels like wire, inserting itself into my skin. But I don’t move.\nBecause if I move, the sheep will leave.\nAnd I can’t let it leave.\n\nNot yet.\n\nDo you know what it’s like to hold onto something you’ve never touched?\nTo reach for a thing that was never yours?\n\nThe sheep tilts its head, like it’s asking me that question.\nOr maybe I’m asking it.\nI don’t know anymore.\n\nIts wool looks soft. Softer than anything I’ve ever known.\nBut my hands—they’re not built for softness.\nThey’re built for breaking.\n\nThe moon shatters.\nThe hill cracks.\nAnd the sheep is gone.\n\nI’m alone again, in a place that doesn’t exist.\nNo hill. No sky. No sheep.\n\nJust me.\n\nWhen I wake up, I don’t feel relief.\nI feel…\nheavy.\n\nLike the dream is still around my neck, pulling me down.\nAnd I wonder if the sheep is still out there, somewhere.\nIf it’s waiting for me to find it again.\n\nI want to tell you about it, but you’re not here.\nYou wouldn’t listen anyway.\nYou never did.\n\nI think the sheep was you.\nOr maybe it was me.\nI can’t tell anymore.\n\nBut I keep dreaming, because it’s all I know how to do.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, I’ll stop.\nBut not today.\n\nNot yet.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Veloch]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
