He was breathing low, so low that he seemed almost still.\n\n\"How long has he been like this?\"\n\nHarry glanced at [[[scp-6382 | Thilo Zwist]]]. The old thaumaturge seemed just moments away from tapping the glass, as though they were watching a reptile basking in a vivarium and not an eldritch horror in human form lying comatose in containment.\n\n\"[[[the-time-after-time-password-hub | January of last year]]],\" Harry responded. \"Our former Chief of Security shot him. We don't really know why.\"\n\nZwist shook his head. \"Of course you know why. You've had these two locked up for a generation. You know everything there is to know about them.\"\n\n\"We know //more// than there is to know about them,\" Lillian Lillihammer corrected him. \"We blew almost twenty years on [[[scp-5243 | alternate timeline shenanigans]]] thanks to the other one.\"\n\n\"So you say,\" Zwist nodded. \"But I'll note those timeline reports have yet to be declassified.\"\n\n\"I'm working on it,\" Harry muttered.\n\n\"So tell me,\" Zwist pressed. \"Who is this man?

Who is he?\"\n\nHarry squirmed. \"It's a long story.\"\n\n\"Then you had better start telling it, and soon.\" Zwist turned back to the glass, and pressed one palm against it. The figure on the cot stirred in his endless sleep. \"The end of the world poses something of a tight timeframe.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[SCP-6484]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[SCP-6519]]]** >>\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Asterisk43.png/22222.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n>\n> Despite embedded claims to the contrary, the poems presented here are the author's own.\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
