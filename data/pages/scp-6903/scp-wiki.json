Research bay door should meet a Level II hazard control rating (steel door, reinforced hinges, SCPassport keycard access with manual override). Any instances of SCP-6903-2 exiting SCP-6903 are to be contained and interrogated. SCP-6903 must be kept under constant video surveillance. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6903 is a mirror measuring 1.7 meters in height and 0.7 meters in width. SCP-6903 presents the reflections of only non-anomalous objects and entities. Otherwise non-anomalous entities that have been altered by anomalous effects are also observed to be reflected in SCP-6903. Objects or entities that seemed to have exhibited paranormal behavior but that did possess reflections in SCP-6903 have consistently been revealed to operate through natural means and according to classical physical laws of reality.\n\nEntities that are not reflected in SCP-6903 are able to pass through SCP-6903 into a non-euclidean space that mirrors SCP-6903's surroundings. Objects within SCP-6903 can be retrieved, though only by entities capable of passing within the mirror's boundary. Objects retrieved, which are three dimensional reflections of objects placed in front of SCP-6903, are nearly always observed to possess anomalous qualities.\n\nWhen an object is retrieved from SCP-6903, its counterpart outside the mirror no longer possesses a reflection in SCP-6903. Retrieved reflections of objects, or instances of SCP-6903-1, typically possess anomalous properties.  A list of items retrieved from SCP-6903 is listed below:\n\n* A knife capable of cutting through any solid object with little force.\n* A pencil that can only be used to write factually correct statements.\n* A U.S. $5 bank note that regularly produces copies of itself. (currently missing)\n* A chair that has not yet been observed to possess any anomalous properties.\n* An instant print camera that when used, prints a photo of what its user most desires in that moment.\n\nReflections of a sentient entities retrieved from SCP-6903 have in each recorded instance deceased immediately upon exiting SCP-6903. In some instances, entities with no external counterpart have exited SCP-6903 themselves. These entities, labeled as SCP-6903-2, possess no shared or consistent qualities.\n\n**Incident 1:** ██/██/████ 11:03\nAn instance of SCP-6903-2, SCP-6903-2-A was recorded exiting SCP-6903. The entity was vaguely humanoid, and measured over 2 meters in height. Security footage depicts the entity phasing through the test chamber walls and reentering 48 minutes later. SCP-6903-2-A then reentered SCP-6903. No other information is available.\n\n**Incident 2:** ██/██/████ 21:43\n3 instances of SCP-6903-2 exited SCP-6903, all human and wearing SCP Foundation Task Force uniforms. The entities looked around the test chamber for a moment appearing confused as if they had forgotten why they had entered the room. The instances of SCP-6903-2 then reentered SCP-6903.\n\n**SCP-6903 Expedition 1:**\n> **Expedition Supervisor:** Dr. █████\n> **Subject:** D-9405. Has been recently exposed to the anomalous effects of [[[SCP-884]]] and has lost reflection in SCP-6903.\n> **Note:** A camera previously affected by [[[SCP-895]]] was used to make entry into SCP-6903 possible.\n> **Results:** Upon entering SCP-6903, D-9405 reported feeling disoriented but confirmed that the interior space mirrored the layout of Site ██. The environment appeared as a perfect yet empty reflection, devoid of personnel, activity, or sounds. At approximately 5 minutes into the exploration, D-9405 noted slight structural changes in the site's layout. The subject also noted an ambient sound that was not present outside the mirror, described as a faint \"whispering\" echo. At 13 minutes, the camera transmission began to distort, displaying intermittent static. Just before the signal cut out completely, the last visual captured depicted a group of humanoid figures (presumably instances of SCP-6903-2) observing D-9405 from a distance. Communication with D-9405 ceased, and attempts to re-establish contact have been unsuccessful. Recovery efforts to retrieve D-9405 are ongoing, though no further reflections or instances of D-9405 have reemerged from SCP-6903.\n\n**Addendum 6903-1: Discovery and Initial Research**\nSCP-6903 was brought to the Foundation’s attention after a peculiar incident involving a regular customer at █████ Antiques. The store owner reported that an individual, ████ ██████, noticed their reflection was missing from SCP-6903. According to the store owner, ████ had seemed oddly unsurprised by the situation. After witnessing the anomaly, the store owner contacted local authorities, suspecting that they had witnessed a vampire. Foundation personnel intercepted the report and launched an investigation.\n\nTesting with D-Class personnel and select items confirmed SCP-6903’s selective reflection properties: non-anomalous objects reflected normally, while anomalous items did not. Following these findings, SCP-6903 was secured and transferred to Site ██ for further research.\n\n------\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6902]]] | SCP-6903 | [[[SCP-6904]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
