Any infringement is to be considered a lost cause.\n\n----\n\n[[size 125%]] **Description:** [[/size]]\n\nSCP-8523 is a gravitational phenomenon observed in the ocean of the terrestrial planet HD 50655 Ad, located 20 light-years away from Earth. SCP-8523 is activated when an object crosses HD 50655 Ad's bathypelagic zone[[footnote]]The part of the open ocean that extends from a depth of 1,000 to 4,000 m below its surface.[[/footnote]], correspondingly adjusting the gravitational pull for the object to sink indefinitely. \n\nRegarding its effects on living beings, it is currently believed either SCP-8523 does not affect any form of organic matter anywise or the several creatures inhabiting HD 50655 Ad's deep ocean have simply adapted to survive in an anomalous environment.\n\nFinally, the very behavior of other laws of physics and matter itself in the areas affected by SCP-8523 is equally deviant from Normalcy — but throughout irregular periods of time. Extensive investigation of this phenomenon is being conducted; for detailed information on its nature, see the section below. \n\n----\n\n[[size 125%]] **Item History:** [[/size]]\n\nOn September 6, 2344, the United States Space Administration (USSA) designated the astronauts Agatha Ripley and Leah Weaver to the Nyx Project, a human spaceflight program intended to discover extraterrestrial life on the ocean world[[footnote]]A type of planet that contains a substantial amount of water in the form of oceans, as part of its hydrosphere, either beneath the surface, as subsurface oceans, or on the surface, potentially submerging all dry land.[[/footnote]]HD 50655 Ad following the detection of high concentrations of dimethyl sulfide[[footnote]]Indication of biological activity.[[/footnote]] by Elizabeth Kane Telescope.\n\nAlthough the operation was primarily focused on remote data gathering and field researches of the mesopelagic zone[[footnote]]The part of the open ocean that extends from a depth of 200 to 1,000 m below its surface.[[/footnote]], Weaver eventually embarked on the submarine Nyx 1 to commence exploration of the deep sea, activating SCP-8523. This led to the mission being called off on October 9, 2353.\n\nThe Foundation would only discover SCP-8523 on December 24, 2363, following suspicions regarding the inconclusive details released about Weaver's death and the immediate disappearance of Ripley from the media after her arrival in the past month.\n\nThe following transcriptions were conceded by the USSA for archival and further research. The original footage was recovered with the help of the multi-information system interconnecting Nyx 1 to the spaceship Hermes 1, where Ripley was stationed.\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG NUMBER #1**\n\n----\n**DATE:** July 27th, 2353\n\n**NOTES:** Upon reaching a depth of 1,336 m, Nyx 1 began preparations to return to the surface. SCP-8523 is seen for the first time.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Weaver is sitting on a chair in a white room built out of titanium. In front of her, instrument panels to operate the submarine functions are adjacent to a sonar, displaying readouts of her route and position. She is tampering with the ballast control while monitoring the readouts but stops after a few minutes to reach for the communicator, a confused look on her face.//\n\n**Weaver:** Hermes 1, do you hear me?\n\n**Ripley:** I do. Any problem?\n\n**Weaver:** I'm not going up. 1,339 m as of now.\n\n**Ripley:** Have you double-checked?\n\n**Weaver:** Yeah. I'm sinking—\n\n//She turns to check her position again on the sonar when an abrupt ping reverberates through the sub. It is the proximity alarm.//\n\n**Weaver:** Hold on.\n\n**Ripley:** What's wrong?\n\n//The alarm pings twice. It is closer. There is a beat of silence, then it pings three more times.//\n\n**Ripley:** Nyx 1?\n\n**Weaver:** There's something around here.\n\n//Weaver takes a photo.//\n@@@@\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/yXM4hIP.jpeg\n|caption=Photo 1\n|width=100%\n|align=center]]\n@@@@\n**Ripley:** What is it?\n\n**Weaver:** I wouldn't know. It's well hidden.\n\n//The pinging stops. The presence remains in the sonar for a few seconds, then disappears.//\n\n**Weaver:** Weird. It seems to be gone.\n\n**Ripley:** I'm preparing the ROVs[[footnote]]Remotely operated underwater vehicle.[[/footnote]]. Hang in there.\n\n**Weaver:** You sure that's necessary already?\n\n**Ripley:** Better safe than sorry. Just call me if you need anything, okay?\n\n**Weaver:** Sure.\n\n//Three hours pass as Ripley prepares all the equipment, coming back from time to time to check on Weaver. She is nervous, restlessly tapping her fingers against the panel. Nyx 1 is at a depth of 1,391 m when the ROV Soteria 2 is finally launched, with Soteria 1 prepared to intervene and support its sister at all times.//\n\n**Ripley:** How are you feeling?\n\n**Weaver:** A bit anxious.\n\n**Ripley:** Oh, my love. Wanna talk about it?\n\n//Her fingers stop. She lets out a sharp exhale.//\n\n**Weaver:** I just don't know what to expect.\n\n**Ripley:** It's not because our future is unknown that it'll hurt us. My mom loved to say that.\n\n**Weaver:** She also loved to say you're a magnet for 'weird stuff'. Maybe that's why all of this is happening, at the end of the day.\n\n**Ripley:** ... You remember she would include you among the 'weird stuff' too, don't you?\n\n**Weaver:** I do, and I prefer to ignore that part.\n\n//The two laugh. A few seconds later, a sharp noise echoes across the sub, followed by a faint scratching. Soteria 2 has arrived, and Weaver follows Ripley's instructions for the next few minutes without any complications.//\n\n**Ripley:** What's your position, please?\n\n**Weaver:** 1,419 m. Sinking yet again.\n\n**Ripley:** Alright, sending Soteria 1 down there.\n\n//The sonar displays an amorphous presence nearby, but there's no pinging from the alarm. Weaver doesn't seem to notice it, and then it quickly surrounds Nyx 1 before fading away.//\n\n**Ripley:** It's ready. Where are you?\n\n**Weaver:** 1,431 m. What about the ROVs?\n\n**Ripley:** Both are at 1,425 m.\n\n//The proximity alarm pings.//\n\n**Weaver:** Hold on. \n\n//She takes a photo.//\n@@@@\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/1RWpnaN.jpeg\n|caption=Photo 2\n|width=100%\n|align=center]]\n@@@@\n**Weaver:** There are three... things nearby. They're small. Also remind me of a hive. \n\n//She zooms in on the photo.//\n\n**Weaver:** Should we investigate?\n\n**Ripley:** You're the priority for now, so ignore the mission. I'll just change our route.\n\n**Weaver:** Roger that.\n\n//She sighs.//\n\n**Weaver:** But what a shame.\n\n**Ripley:** Relax. We'll have time for them later.\n\n//The operation is conducted for the following hour with no further results. The two are silent throughout, and the sound of water crashing against the sub is prevalent, heavy and close.//\n\n**Ripley:** Can we call it a day, Leah?\n\n**Weaver:** Do I have a choice?\n\n//Radio silence for a few moments.//\n\n**Weaver:** Sorry. I'm just nervous.\n\n**Ripley:** Hey, hey. It'll be fine. Accidents happen.\n\n**Weaver:** It's worse when you're far from home.\n\n//Weaver pauses and shakes her head. Silence.//\n\n**Weaver:** What you always say when I'm down?\n\n**Ripley:** Love today, and seize all tomorrows.\n\n//Weaver nods to herself, sighing. A slight smile.//\n\n**Weaver:** Okay then. I will try my best. \n\n**Ripley:** //We// will.
