Testing may only take place if a long-term humanoid containment pod is available. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3866 refers to a group of unmarked pharmaceutical tablets recovered during the raid of an amateur medical facility in Palm Beach, Florida (See Addendum SCP-3866-1 for details).\n\nIngestion of SCP-3866 causes the subject to immediately enter a hibernation-like state, lowering brain activity immensely and slowing the subject's heart-rate to approximately one beat every thirty-four days. It is currently unknown exactly how long an individual can survive in this state, although estimates project that a human can survive for at least 3,000 years[[footnote]] This assumes the subject is a baseline human and is given an adequate oxygen and nutrition supply[[/footnote]]. There is no known method to achieve this state with modern medical equipment.\n\n**Addendum SCP-3866-1:** On 04/18/20██, MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\") commenced an investigation of an unnamed amateur medical facility offering euthanasia in Palm Beach, Florida. The majority of the patients who approached the facility sought physician-assisted suicide. The investigation was initiated after the onset of an [[[SCP-3984| ΩK-Class end-of-death scenario]]]. Due to the nature of the Scenario, it was necessary to determine if the operation was fraudulent or anomalous.\n\nMonitoring of the facility showed that the operation was, to some degree, both fraudulent and anomalous. It did not terminate the patients, and what results it did achieve, were obtained through anomalous means. Once patients ingested SCP-3866, employees of the facility would bury the body behind the facility.\n\nMTF Epsilon-6 raided the facility on 04/29/20██, and apprehended all personnel. This included the leader of the operation, Jacob Possman. A series of text messages were recovered from Possman's phone between him and an individual labeled in Possman's contacts as \"dado\"[[footnote]]Denoted below as the text in red.[[/footnote]].\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : 700px ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n##blue|Ok, I was told to message you directly about details about the medicine, but just making sure, you talked to Alex Bennings right?##\n[[/>]]\n\n##red|yes. spoke with bening. good talk.##\n\n[[>]]\n##blue| So, are you able to make pills for euthanasia?##\n[[/>]]\n \n##red|uthanasia? y u need asian pills?##\n\n[[>]]\n##blue|No, like... like pills used for putting people down?##\n[[/>]]\n \n##red|like cyanide?##\n\n[[>]]\n##blue|Sorta?

At the address was a small apartment containing only a phone, a half-eaten donut, three empty Amazon delivery boxes, and a mattress.\n\n**Addendum SCP-3866-2:** Between 07/03/20██ and 07/16/20██, civilians reported vocalizations from the area behind the medical facility, generally in the form of screaming, weeping, or retching. Investigation into the disturbance determined that the noise was caused by 541 buried ex-patients of the medical facility, 491 of whom had been buried without a casket. After the patients were exhumed, medical personnel extracted all soil, minerals, and insects from their bodies to remove evidence of the event. Personnel then administered the patients amnestics, and returned them to society with appropriate cover stories.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3865]]] | SCP-3866 | [[[SCP-3867]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
