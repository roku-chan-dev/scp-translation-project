You have spent your days nervously pacing around the hallways for hours on end. \n\nDr. Fenwick promised that if you were ever lost, she would trace your ankle bracelet to come and get you - so where //is// she? But after you broke your promise, does she even want anything to do with you in the first place?!\n\nQuestions for later. You're miserable. You don't need to eat, but you've never been hungrier, and the rebar you've been chewing on has lost its flavor.\n\nTo make matters worse, the wrecking crew came, so you have to find a new home. Which meant that you were woken up this morning by a nasty man in a yellow vest and hard hat. His raspy voice startled you out of your sleep so viciously that you came within microseconds of letting a yelp loose - before just barely suppressing it.\n\n...which brings us to the worst part of all: your weekly stay-quiet medicine. Whenever you took it, it always left a lingering, bitter taste on the back of your tongue for the rest of the day, like if \"beige\" were a lollipop flavor. The pill itself was too small to chomp in any satisfying way. \n\nBut now that you've had no access to it for a month, you miss it terribly.\n\nThe sensitivity of your nerves has tripled, and the struggle to stay silent is now a full-blown war with your five senses. The pebbles under your bare feet dig into your flesh with sharp, dry stings. You found an old nine-volt battery the other day and tried to dampen your sorrows with a little snack -- but without your medicine, sucking out the innards of the battery gave you none of the tangy goodness that it usually did. It burned, and it only burned, and it took everything you had not to scream.\n\n...\n\nWell, you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. \n\n------\n\n> +++ ☐ Go outside.\n\nYou plod through the smashed-open doorway to the apartment complex. The pathway is flanked by two lines of construction workers, glaring at you. It reminds you of one of the movies you had to see when you were younger. There was a scene where a soldier was drummed up and cashiered out of an army. You cling to your shirt anxiously - you aren't about to let any nasty generals rip the hard-earned mustard stains off your uniform.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##white|Yeah, that's right.

The majority of buildings are soulless glass monoliths. You have to quietly remind yourself not to look up at them - their height makes you feel like either you'll fall over or the towers are going to eat you. Or maybe both!\n\nExhausted, you rest against a lamppost at a six-way intersection. You can see a huddle of old men and women, only about half as grimy as yourself, holding up cardboard signs: \"I'M JUST HUNGRY.\" \"ANYTHING HELPS! JALAKÅRA BLESS YOU!\" \"CLASS WAR VETERAN LOOKING TO FUND MY ONE-MAN REVOLUTION!\"\n\nWhat an excellent idea! Just crowdsource for your location by holding up your whiteboard in public. Better show the sign guys your appreciation.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|THANKS FOR THE IDEA, SIGN GUYS!##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n++++ {{##white|//**PISS OFF, GOBSHITE!**//##}}\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat an interesting word! You've never heard it at Site-6800.\n\nSo, you turn to face the near-endless stream of passers-by and hold up your new message:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|WHAT CITY IS THIS??##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n...\n\nAn hour passes, and no one pays you any mind.\n\nSeems you'll need to update your strategy.

The youngest daughter, no more than six, glances at your sign.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##white|You're in Sydney!##}}\n[[/div]]\n\nYou quickly scribble up a response before the family pulls her away.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|SIDNI??

But you're awfully proud of yourself for such restraint.\n\nSo... Sydney, Australia? You've seen that place in your movies! \n\nBut something feels different about //this// Sydney. Maybe it's the levitating trolleys in the middle of the road. Maybe it's all the little dragonfly-shaped robots you see in the air, delivering packages. \n\nAnd besides that, you don't remember exactly what the Australian flag looks like, but you know it involves that blue-and-red X thing that England likes -- and you haven't seen any of that. The main flag you see is a black, white, and teal thing with three orange crescent moon symbols. \n\nMost of all, you were always under the impression that Australia had 73 kangaroos per square meter - and you haven't seen //one!//\n\nSo either that kid was lying , or this is the same city...\n\n> +++ ☑ Figure out where you are.\n\n------\n\n> +++ ☐ Figure out //when// you are.\n\n...but a different time.\n\nThat'll be easy enough. You've eaten enough Site-6800 employee newsletters to tell you that newspapers always have the date on the front page. \n\nYou meander down the street, scanning every bright and shiny storefront for an indication of newspapers. And just as you're about to give up this strategy and move on to something else, you see a sign on top of a dingy little booth: \"SOO YUN'S VINTAGE NEWSSTAND - KEEPING PRINT ALIVE SINCE 2140!\"\n\nBehind a mountain of magazines, there's a tired old woman reading a Korean-language novel.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|HELLO YOU GOBSHITE!

As if pulled up from a marionette string, a limp, withered hand covered in age spots is drawn in front of her. She flicks her hand twice in an unspoken \"shoo, shoo.\"\n\nJoke's on her, there's still a mountain of newspapers and magazines within your reach. Slapping your fingers through front pages, you come across all sorts of headlines...\n\n> Prefect Gainsborough: South America \"On Track\" to 30% Biome Restoration by Fall 2300\n\n> Poll: 57% of Australians are Tired of the Three Moons Initiative's Occupation of the Earth during the Post-##orange|**Tarrare**## Restoration\n\n> \"We Have Bridges to Rebuild\" - Perdition Committee Removes Worship of ABBAD of the Red Crater from List of Class-L Heresies\n\n> Opposing Perspectives: Does our Direct Communication With the Afterlife Cheapen the Concept of Death? \n\n...\n\nTarrare.\n\nThat's the first time you've seen that name outside of your dreams. Outside of asking about it. Outside of being brushed off.\n\nMaybe this is a coincidence. Maybe there was a different thing called Tarrare.\n\nBecause the alternative is that Tarrare is - or, at some point //was// - real. \n\nYou don't know how to feel about this.\n\n...\n\nOh, and it's December 12th, 2287. Neat.\n\nYour wrenching, stabbing hunger can no longer be ignored. When's the last time you had real food? Something that's meant for human consumption?\n\n> +++ ☑ Figure out //when// you are.\n\n------\n\n> +++ ☐ Eat something.\n\nThere's a restaurant on the next corner over. \"Bubba Gump's Shrimp Company.\" The sign has a nice little shrimp-thing who's smiling at you.\n\nYour eye twitches. Shrimp are definitely human-grade food.\n\nYou scramble forth. You no longer caring about the icky way the concrete feels under your fingertips. It'll be the first real food you've had in a month! You can eat it! You MUST eat it! You're going to have a meal! You're going to put food in your mouth and bite it and bite it and bite it and swallow!\n\nRun. Run. Jump.\n\nYour overgrown fingernails dig into the brick wall on the side of the restaurant. \n\nClimb. Climb. Climb.\n\nYou bite the shrimp.\n\nTurns out shrimp tastes like a sign. Who knew?\n\n...\n\nAfter being dogpiled by waiters and busboys, they drag you to the employee break room \"until the police arrive.\"\n\nAre you scared of the police? //Should// you be? You've seen too many conflicting depictions of the police in your movies to really know what reaction to have.\n\n> +++ ☑ Eat something.\n\n------\n\n> +++ ☐ Figure out if it's the same \"Tarrare.\"\n\nThere's a TV on for the employees. A rerun of a talk show is starting...\n\n> **Jerry Springer:** Hello, and welcome to After-Lifestyles! I'm your host, Jerry Springer, recording live (as it were) from Luna Major in Corbenic.

Did Dr. Fenwick know you had this power?\n\n> +++ ☑ Figure out if it's the same \"Tarrare.\"\n\n------\n\n> +++ ☐ Escape.\n\nWell, now that you've got both your meal and some useful information from this Bubba Gump establishment, it's high time you said goodbye before the police come and skip saying \"hello.\"\n\nThere's a rather large line cook behind you, holding your shoulders in place. He was nice enough to let you still have your whiteboard.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|I'M GOING TO ESCAPE NOW!

Perhaps you should make an addition to clarify things.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##purple|I'M GOING TO ^^BITE YOU AND THEN^^ ESCAPE NOW!

But a good chomp that barely leaves a mark is one of life's greatest pleasures.\n\nBut you're an expert. You've had 19 years of training on the staff of Site-6800. \n\nSo when you give his thumb a good nip, the cook is angry enough to let you go, but not scared enough to call an ambulance.\n\nOnce he's clasping his left hand instead of your body, you tumble out of the chair, bash open the door to the back alley with your forehead, regret doing that immediately, rub your aching forehead, and scamper off into the darkness.\n\n> +++ ☑ Escape.\n\n------\n\nThe next ten minutes are a blur of alleyways, jaywalking, and hoping nobody sees you. There's a dark, concrete alcove in the back of a department store -- ostensibly to shelter their HVAC unit, which is in a fenced-off area.\n\nYou squat in a corner, waiting for the sound of police sirens to die down.\n\nAnd they do!\n\nBut by the time that happens, you're still squatting in the corner - because you're still not sure what your next move should be.\n\nIs this alcove the new replacement for the condemned apartment?\n\n...\n\nIt's getting dark. A dull, brownish-orange light bulb flickers from the ceiling. This little concrete cave will have to do for now.\n\nYou stay there, frozen in the same spot, until something new happens.\n\nAnd three hours later, that something turns out to be some//one//...\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px\"]]\n[[image caseyboss.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##FAFF91|//You.//##}}\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat's this? \n\nThere's a young man in in the alley.

Down your throat...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...you made it.\n\nYou //did// vocalize a little -- but only a smidgen more than you do when you cough. The sound was almost completely muffled by your fist.\n\nIt still hurts, but the worst of it is over. You touch the entry-point of the knife. Where there was a slit a few seconds ago, there's only a pinhole. The doctors always said you were very good at \"bouncing back\", whatever that means.\n\nYou smile weakly in relief. Now you have a backup plan for screaming-emergencies, at least.\n\nBut something's off. You did hear the faintest mumble of your voice, in a way that you've never heard before. So why does it sound so //familiar?// ...questions for later.\n\nYou turn toward your attacker. Even in the darkness, you can see that all the anger is gone from his face. There's only bewilderment, and maybe even fear. ...no, on second thought, that's guilt.\n\nThe knife, still glowing red-hot, drops from his hand.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #ffffff; background:#000000; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px\"]]\n{{##FAFF91|Why... didn't you bleed?##}}\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nBoth of you sit in the alcove.
