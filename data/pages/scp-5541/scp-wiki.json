So far, over 150 attempts of varying methodology have been initiated by RCT-Δt traveling back to prevent RCT-Δt from traveling back and providing this document to a trusted member of Overwatch. If this document still exists in the repository before the date of its creation, then all tests have been unsuccessful.\n\nIt is postulated that SCP-5541 cannot be prevented nor delayed without use of extreme measures such as anomalous tools or retrocausal weapons, which would be used to terminate or otherwise displace one or more parties involved in the creation of the paradox. However, it is impossible to confirm whether intervention of this type would have any effect on the outcome without doing so, let alone result in the desired outcome versus any number of potential negative impacts, such as an ontological breakdown of reality or unwanted alteration of future timelines.[[footnote]] Most notably, one or more parties involved have an intrinsic relationship with the career progression of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-assassination-of-xyank late Thaddeus Xyank], that, if disturbed sufficiently, could result in the nonexistence of RCT-Δt and/or a subsequent \"grandfather\" temporal paradox effect.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]The timeline of events surrounding the manifestation of a \"grandfather\" paradox would lack a true beginning and end, as said events would occur in an endless causal loop of destructive action and the nullification of said action.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-5541 is described as a global paradigm shift, affecting all timelines tangent to and including our own, starting at a single 4th-dimensional point that encompasses all frames of reality that occur during the causal loop—regardless of other initial conditions and outcomes leading up until the point of Emergence.[[footnote]]Timelines that end prematurely due to other causes or experience phenomena that render humans inert/incapable of carrying out SCP-5541 are excluded from this criteria.[[/footnote]] This makes SCP-5541 the only known or hypothesized outcome to do so other than the heat death of this iteration of the universe.

It is typically marked by the loss of Foundation sites, important members of the Administration, and/or many personnel, ultimately leading to larger-scale failures.\n\nIn majority of instances, the destruction of one or more vital Foundation sites can be cited as the primary cause of systemic collapse of all organization operations. In some cases (~30%), this event can be traced to a severe containment breach. In less cases (<10%), the cause is associated with internal sabotage, either as premeditated attempts by insurgents or stochastic incidents from disillusioned personnel acting as lone assailants. Nearly 60% of all cases were due to administrative/infrastructural failures such as communications breakdowns or containment constraints. ~1% of cases involve the spontaneous detonation of one or more on-site nuclear warheads or similar \"black swan\" preventative measures. \n\nAttempts to divert or otherwise prevent Foundation collapse in timelines impacted by SCP-5541 have proven unsuccessful in all cases. Individual events can be mitigated, but without the proper foresight associated with backwards travel, it is impossible to predict when the next may occur. It appears that in most of these timelines, the Foundation was at risk of catastrophic failure for some time leading up to the event itself. Agents of Tactical Operations Command have attempted to \"prime\" specific timelines by traveling to a point prior to the window in which SCP-5541 will emerge, however, events occur that are beyond the scope of reach, or personnel are hampered by one or more individuals acting against the interests of the agents and the Foundation as a whole, rendering these efforts futile.\n\nAttempts to establish contact with future members of the Temporal Anomalies Department have been similarly unproductive. Personnel in observed timelines generally express confusion at the presence of RCT-Δt agents from the past, possibly suggesting future agents are still traveling forward to deal with threats, isolating themselves from past members to safeguard against annihilation via self-interaction, and/or are aware of some information regarding SCP-5541 that, for an unknown reason, prohibits them from informing current RCT-Δt members of their status and whereabouts. Investigations into the future actions of the Temporal Anomalies Department are being considered, however, logistical concerns and inherent trust-related risks are major obstacles to these operations.\n\nIt is also to note that in most affected timelines, by the end of the third millennium, containment efforts have increased in cost, size, and complexity such that tracking all facets related to sustaining uniform operations is nearly impossible. In addition, average employee morale is at an all-time low in almost every instance.  \n[[/div]]\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=◆ Apollyon-Class Containment Breach\n| hide=-confirmed\n| nohide=1\n]]\n\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n[[div class=\"notation mod\"]]\n> **Incident 5541-Gleipnir**\n> **Date:** 10/12/2999\n> **Location:** Containment Area-179, Universe-Kappa-Erikesh\n> **Subject:** Breach of [[[SCP-2317]]]\n> **Preface:** //Up until now, SCP-2317 had been defying all previous predictions regarding its activation.

Now every 20-30 years || All biological growth and decomposition in the solar system ceases for duration of event. Radioactive isotopes do not decay. Humans unable to experience personal growth (emotional, spiritual, or physical). Global AEP rate[[footnote]] Artifact-Event-Phenomena Rate is used to determine the frequency of aberrant activity.[[/footnote]] decreases to ~0.0%||\n|| #90G-1IPN-Y190-B || The moon/Venus/Mars occults Jupiter. Occurs every ~32 years || All technological advancements of greater complexity than simple mechanisms like pulleys and levers cease function until event passes. Humans report sporadic cases of epistaxis and loss of consciousness. Boundary reality found to drop sharply for duration of event, leading to an inversely proportional AEP spike||\n|| #90G-1IPN-Y190-C || Jupiter occults Neptune. Experienced 04/30/2998, configuration had not occurred since 9/19/1702 || Global intelligence decreases dramatically for duration of alignment. General fatigue is often reported. Sentient beings cannot dream during this period||\n|| #90G-1IPN-Y190-D || Jupiter occults Uranus. Occurs every 300-400 years || Earth's oceans rapidly change to a mix of water, water-ice, methane and ammonia. Atmospheric conditions change to primarily hydrogen and helium. A faint ring is visible in the sky for duration of event, after which everything returns to its previous state. No adverse health or environmental reactions are detected||\n|| #90G-1IPN-Y190-E || Jupiter occults Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune simultaneously. Does not exist naturally. Occured only once, as a result of a sporadic aberration pocket on 10/10/3001 || Location of previously unconfirmed but hypothesized trans-Neptunian planet reveals itself in spectacular fashion, designated #90G-1IPN-Y190-IX. Observation shows planet is occupied by a single, massive, omnipotent entity, observed to be covered in eyes hundreds of kilometers across||\n|| #90G-1IPN-Y190-F || Jupiter occults #90G-1IPN-Y190-IX. Will occur sometime around 02/3012 || Reality on far side of Jupiter stops existing while unobserved by omnipotent entity||\n[[/div]]\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\n+++++  **Addendum 5541-Aion:** Additional Materials\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show= ◆ RCT-Δt's Proposal\n| hide=-confirmed\n| nohide=1\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation mod\"]]\n//In light of information gained from extensive observations of SCP-5541 and its related effects, as well as various statistical and historical data, the Temporal Anomalies Department has decided to submit for review a proposal for SCP-001. Submitted Document 001-Δt can be found below, which is currently under review by the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Temporal Intelligence Community.//\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n> **Item #:** SCP-001 (Pending Assignment)\n> \n> **Object Class:** Aisna-Boltzmann[[footnote]]Anomaly related to a demiurge is responsible for the generation of anomalous activity, while being both necessary for and inimical to the current state of reality.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001 is to be limited in scope to the best ability of the Foundation, but must not be completely contained nor abandoned at any time. This is to continue until such actions become impossible or are no longer necessary. It is believed that SCP-001's effects possess a certain \"acceptable\" range so as to ensure Foundation operations remain manageable and secure facilities self-sustainable for an indeterminate amount of time. Adhering to this range while undergoing a complete restructuring of protocol to one prioritizing rehabilitation, low-profile relocation, and reintegration services is the most optimal means of preserving consensus reality and the lives of nearly every being in the entire universe, across all universes and timelines that are impacted by SCP-001 itself. \n> \n> **Description:** SCP-001 is the designation for an anachronistic metaphysical quality that permeates all systems of complex structures that possess sentience, can be defined as \"human\"/\"humanoid\", or can otherwise receive, store, and transmit high-order information. SCP-001 is believed to manifest as the outcome of a probabilistic scenario initiated when any 3rd-dimensional frame within a 4th-dimensional octahedral reality is subject to wave function collapse. \n> \n> When probabilistic scenarios collapse via observation, there is an unknown likelihood[[footnote]]Due to the scope of the effect and being unable to preclude the location of all physical spaces being unobserved without observing said spaces.[[/footnote]] that SCP-001 will occur. When this happens, SCP-001 will randomly manifest anomalous phenomena at any synchronous point on the 3D frame that is also experiencing wave function collapse. This effect does not appear to have a limited range outside of the field of view and the ability to observe at a distance, so long as the space is unobserved in one frame, and is observed in some way in the next. Additionally, the process or sensory function in which the observation occurs does not appear to matter, although vision remains the most effective means of doing so that humans possess.\n> \n> The intensity, frequency, and density of SCP-001's effect increases over each quantum of time elapsed, by a rate determined through the previous density of the effect and other factors such as broad awareness of this aspect of reality. When human entities gain knowledge of the anomalous, increase their population density, and/or unify their thought processes, the rate at which anomalous phenomena generates via SCP-001 increases. This also influences the radius of the same effect impacting a spherical area surrounding the brains of all affected organisms.[[footnote]]This serves as a possible explanation for novel anomalous activity manifesting within Foundation Secure Facilities such as but not limited to [[[scp-8190|Site-19]]] and [[[scp-1730|Site-13]]].[[/footnote]] Therefore, it is possible for this system to reach a \"cascade\" point, wherein a positive feedback loop of anomalous activity leads to the collapse of quantum systems due to insufficient universal resources. It is the conclusion of the Temporal Anomalies Department that \"anomalies\" are as intrinsic to reality as reality itself, perhaps associated with some unknown form of higher-order mathematics and/or sciences not yet known to us. \n> \n> The inverse of this appears to also be true; when there are less observers in a space, the area being observed becomes less real by a faint, imperceptible, but entirely measurable change in Humes. As such, SCP-001 appears to suggest that \"baseline\" reality is malleable and \"anomalous\" in its entirety.\n>  \n> It is speculated that Hume loss of unobserved space correlates with a limited amount of \"processing power\" within the universe. Use of this finite quantity appears to be offset by an endogenous self-adjusting limiting/boosting mechanism, which helps regulate the Hume field of the surrounding reality. This is further corroborated by reports within spaces in which the Hume field logarithmically approaches zero, where human minds have been seen to [[[scp-3545|individually generate their own localized reality]]]. It appears there is an inherent property of reality that is necessary to observe in order to exist within, and yet cannot exist while unobserved.\n> \n> **Conclusion:** The observer effect within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, SCP-001, appears to be at least partially responsible for the generation of large portions of our current universe, utilizing or being generated by humanoid life-forms. Thus the phenomenon is responsible both for the generation of anomalous activity/baseline reality and cannot be contained fully, nor should it remain uncontained. Due to the relationship with the very objects the Foundation has spent centuries studying, and the Organization's [[[scp-4002|strained relationship]]] with various groups considered \"different\" than humanity, such as [[[scp-1000|The Children of the Night]]], RCT-Δt urges the Council to immediately reclassify all phenomena as explained through the nature of consensus reality and begin rehabilitation/reintroduction programs for all sentient creatures in containment that are capable of doing so. \n> \n> This may be the only recourse we have to avoid the fate of our future selves. We will lose the war—but we believe things can still change so that it never happens in the first place. \n\n= {{END FILE}}\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation mod\"]]\n//Note: As of May 23rd, 2858, no records of a \"Temporal Anomalies Department\" exist within Foundation record, other than this document, which was found sealed with a metastable tachyonic displacement mechanism of unidentifiable origin.
