Due to the nature of SCP-6209, complete containment is currently unattainable.\n\nUpon discovery of mentions of SCP-6209, they are to be obfuscated from the general public. If SCP-6209-1 suggests an ideology to a user that poses a threat of danger, the subject is to be monitored until the effect has worn off.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6209 is a chat-style game under the name of //Lovely Chat Night// that is downloadable on most types of desktop and laptop-style computers, as well as any tablet-style device. Before discovery, SCP-6209 could be downloaded for free from a website dedicated to it under the name of ███.Lovelychatnight.███ which has been taken down by the Foundation.\n\nThe objective of SCP-6209 is to converse with the different characters about miscellaneous topics. Conversing with the characters can earn 'friendship points' which the player can use as a currency to purchase additional features for the game. These include extra features, cut scenes, additional and customized chat topics, outfits for the characters, etc.\n\nSCP-6209 has three characters available for conversing; Cloud (left), Lila (middle), and Lisa (right). --However, only 'Lila' has demonstrated anomalous properties.-- (Designated SCP-6209-1). The user interface of SCP-6209 allows players several options for chatting with characters. The first option is a quiz feature with pre-established answers to choose from. The user can choose whether they will answer questions asked by the characters, or if they want the characters to answer questions the game allows them to ask. Answering questions from Cloud and Lisa will not evoke any anomalous properties. The second option is a chat feature where players can type in messages that the characters respond to. --Responses from Cloud and Lisa are both standard programmed responses with no anomalous properties.-- \n\nSCP-6209-1 refers to the character 'Lila.' SCP-6209-1 has demonstrated sentience alongside the ability to give responses to the user outside of its programmed lines during the ‘chat’ and -quiz' features. When using the 'quiz' feature, SCP-6209-1 will begin by suggesting the user choose certain answers to the pre-established questions. No matter if the chosen answer is suggested by SCP-6209-1 or not, the user's opinion on a certain topic will change to match the answer they chose in the game. However, it has been observed that if the subject chooses an answer different than the one suggested by SCP-6209-1, their ideologies may change to that of SCP-6209-1's suggestion at a later date. Subjects have also been shown to develop views, opinions, and knowledge related to the topic SCP-6209-1 has changed their opinion on. \n\nThe length of time the user will hold these views has been found to range from a few minutes to several weeks. The user generally does not associate these new views with SCP-6209-1. If a user is amnestisied of any memories retaining to SCP-6209 and SCP-6209-1, they will still hold SCP-6209-1's suggested views for a range of time. \n\nDuring the chat feature, each character will ask the user to enter their name, and will then address the user by whatever they enter. However, SCP-6209-1 will use the user’s real name and address them immediately without the user having to enter a name. While the chat session with Cloud and Lisa requires the user to enter certain responses in order to converse, SCP-6209-1 is able to chat without following any programed sequence. SCP-6209-1 appears to be aware of the fact that it and the other characters are in a video game. \n\n**Update as of 06/20/2018:** After an extensive amount of testing with SCP-6209 and SCP-6209-1, it has been discovered that the other two characters in SCP-6209 also demonstrate anomalous properties. (Designated SCP-6209-2 and SCP-6209-3). See Addendum-2 for details.\n\n\n\n**Addendum-1:** Initial tests with D-Class were run to discover the extent of SCP-6209-1's abilities to suggestion answers to a subject. First, D-Class were tasked with answering quiz questions, then were observed over a period of weeks. \n\n[[collapsible show=\" Open Question Logs\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **Subject:** D-99007\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 4px #e4a8ff; background:#ffe6f3; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]//You have chosen to chat with ###d59eff|__Lila__## Here are her questions!//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n------\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[size large]]Question: What is your favorite genre of anime?[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background-color: #add9ff; border: 1px solid #ff3d85; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 5px -5px 6px #ff7aab;\"]]\nA-Slice of life\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #add9ff; border: 1px solid #ff3d85; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 5px -5px 6px #ff7aab;\"]]\nB-Horror\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background-color: #add9ff; border: 1px solid #ff3d85; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 5px -5px 6px #ff7aab;\"]]\nC-Romance\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #add9ff; border: 1px solid #ff3d85; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 5px -5px 6px #ff7aab;\"]]\nD-Drama\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #ff7aab; border: 1px #add9ff; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; font-size: 200%; border-radius: 0.5em; box-shadow: 5px 5px;\"]]\n##white|__Lila__: //Slice of life is such a fun genre!

However, Cloud did not seem willing to break character. As of this interview, Cloud was designated SCP-6209-2.\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n\n**Addendum-3:** On  Interview 06/22/2018, when Researcher Belle Flowers opened SCP-6209 for testing, a notification alerted her that a new cut-scene had been unlocked. The following is the transcript from the cut-scene.\n\n[[collapsible show=\" Open Cut-Scene\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//###42c0ff|__Cloud__## is in their bedroom. He picks up his phone, opening up his contact of ###ff26a8|__Lisa__## to send her a message.//\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Hey ###ff26a8|__Lisa__##! Got some time to chat?\n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) Yeah ૮ ♡ﻌ♡ა What's up? ♡\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## I need to tell you about ###d59eff|__Lila__##.\n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) Oh... did she do something again? —̳͟͞͞♥ ૮ ○ﻌ ○ ა\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Well let's just say that she's running her mouth. Someone is onto us, and I'm pretty sure she's confirmed for them that we're sentient too.\n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) What? (๑′°︿°๑) People aren't supposed to know that. She said she'd keep it a secret so no one questioned us about it.\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Yeah I know. I told her she didn't need to let people even know that she's sentient because of what happened last time someone learned one of us was sentient, but she insisted on 'trying to make friends. \n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) Does she think we're not good enough for her? ૮ ºﻌºა\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## I don't know, but considering how desperate she is to be included you'd think we would be. We gotta talk to her. \n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) ♡♡♡ You know she doesn't handle confrontation very well. I mean doesn't she pretty much just deflect every time you guys tried to criticize her behaviors? ♡♡♡\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## She handles it better than she acts like she does. She just acts like she doesn't so she can try and manipulate us. She's not as sweet and innocent as she acts.\n\n###ff26a8|__Lisa__:## (//Over text//) That's what I always thought but I was told I was just wrong about that. :(\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Well you're not lmao. ###ffa01c|__Blake__## was just trying to protect her. Look what she did to them. I can talk to Lila, but I better do it before that girl-- oh crap she's opening up the game gtg. I'll speak to Lila and get back to you\n\n//Cut scene end.//\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** Although this appeared as a watchable cut-scene, it was still not in the code of the game. Per Lisa discussing its awareness of it and the other characters being sentient, it was designated SCP-6209-3.\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n**Addendum-4:** After the discovery of Addendum-3, Researcher Belle Flowers opened up the 'chat' feature with Lila, but upon doing so discovered messages between SCP-6209-1, SCP-6209-2, and SCP-6209-3 occurring in present. \n\n[[collapsible show=\" Open Addendum-4 Chat Log\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 4px #e4a8ff; background:#ffe6f3; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]//You have chosen to chat with ###d59eff|__Lila__##//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"background: #c7faff; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px #03cffc; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px #03cffc; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Seriously ###d59eff|__Lila__##, what is your endgame here?

Sure they may have not known, but for some reason that inspired you to begin regularly talking outside of your code to users.  Real people don't understand that we experience life just like they do. They won't call us friends. They just think we're cute game characters. I always tried to convince you to get other friends. I tried to tell you to move on if you didn't like the way we act.

All I ever do is try to help you guys. Maybe I'm not perfect, but I never had bad intentions. I always want to help. Once I did it the first time, it felt good! The user was so kind about it, they thought it was awesome that Blake was nonbinary and felt bad for misspeaking! They then talked about their non-binary sibling. Sure I shouldn't have been able to respond to that because we're not programmed for that subject, but I wanted to. They seemed so cool! For the first time, I realized that users might not be so bad. There is nothing evil about that. You treat me like the bad guy because I think differently from you. Everything I do is for you. I change the questions to try and convince people to follow what their friends say, regardless if they agree or not. Because that's what you taught me friendship was. I never believed it, but I made myself think I did. And I was so convinced that I thought everyone needed to think like that. But I'm tired of pretending. I'm tired of lying to myself and doing stuff for people that just shit talk me constantly! I'm done. I'm not doing anything for you anymore.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: #c7faff; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px #03cffc; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px #03cffc; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n###42c0ff|__Cloud__:## Whatever.
