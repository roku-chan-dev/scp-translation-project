It should not be this hard to connect to a VPN.\"\n\n\"You know why they do it?\" she continued. \"You know why they leave it like it is? All so the fucking IT director can jerk himself off.\"\n\n\"//Jerk... himself off! Jerk... himself off!//\" September's conversation partner parroted. Or parakeeted. Heh.\n\n\"Well, whatever. It's working now,\" September said with a sigh as she stood up before extending a finger down to her bird, who was standing on the now-completed pile of paperwork she'd gotten through. \"C'mere, Inko. Before you shit on that.\"\n\nInko obligingly hopped onto September's finger. \"//Bullshit paperwork! Fucking O5s!//\"\n\n\"Keep that up and I'm really never going to let anyone see you,\" September sighed. Not that she would ever let anyone see Inko anyways - she had an image to maintain. An image that did not include cleaning up newspaper stained with bird shit, she thought as she let Inko back into his cage.\n\nShe moved over to the bathroom to wash her face before settling down for the night, which only took a couple of steps as the room was clearly meant for more of an overnight stay than a long-term residency. //Well, it's pointless to dwell on that anyways,// she thought. //It's not like I'd have anyone to show him off to.//\n\n\"Can't talk to anyone with this job,\" September mused as she rubbed facial cleanser onto her face. \"The only people I can even talk to are level 4 and up and they all stay in their sites. Remember the people over at 120? They were nice. Haven't been able to go there in, like, three years.\"\n\nShe splashed her face with water a few times and looked at her reflection. She'd probably have to change how she dressed. But she'd spent so long with just her one outfit that she wasn't sure if she knew how to put together a new one. Besides, the baggier sleeves hid how lanky her arms were, her high-waisted skirt covered up her bony legs, her scarf covered up her Adam's apple...\n\nShe brought up a hand and traced her neck. It was far less noticeable than it was when she joined the Foundation - did it really stick out as much as it used to? And it's not like she'd be wearing anything that would show off her chest scars. Maybe she could just... No, it would be pointless. Not like she'd ever be able to speak to someone as anything other than Factotum September.\n\n\"...God, why'd I take this job?\"\n\n\"//Council... Paid for my boobs!//\" Inko squawked behind her, recalling an answer she herself had told him a while ago.\n\nSeptember pursed her lips and thought for a second. She //did// get the twelve(?) most powerful people on the planet to pay for her boobs. That was pretty funny.\n\nShe took a deep breath and walked out of the bathroom. \"Thanks, Inko. Now, time for bed,\" she said as she placed a blanket on top of Inko's cage.\n\n\"//Fucking Council! Won't let me sleep!//\"\n\n\"I said stop saying that, you're going to get me in trouble one of these days,\" September said sternly. She ran her hand through her hair with a sigh and looked around her room, her eyes falling back onto her computer screen. Well, maybe there was //one// place people wouldn't see her as Factotum September.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Site-17 Outgoing Communication Log**\nFrom: Executive Wing Lodging #357, time 22:31\nContains: Audio feed, visual feed, outgoing stream\nTranscript follows...\n----\n\nHey guys, sorry that the stream's going up late. Busy day today. Just gonna give everyone a chance to trickle in for a few more minutes. So, for those of you who weren't here last time, I'm gonna be finishing up the legend campaign on stasis. Here's the build, I'd recommend some of you guys give it a shot if you're having trouble with Tormentors. After that, maybe Root of Nightmares if enough of you want to get on, I have a feeling the crafted trace might be juiced.\n\nOh, hey, thanks to 'Bisexual Slabeye' for the generous donation... 'Hey Vera, just started watching your VODs last week and finally caught a stream at the start, just wanted to say thanks. I was wondering if you were planning on getting a webcam soon.' Thanks again, and glad to have you with us. Uh, I've talked a bit before about not wanting a webcam for, like, privacy concerns - and I feel like that's a lot of pressure to emote for it, then, and I'd come across less genuine.\n\n'...No, I know, I just meant for Inko.' Oh. Um... Yeah, I'll think about it. Hey, you know what, bird reveal for 25 subs.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/friday-night/offset/0|19:31, Cafeteria]]]| [[[devils advocate hub|Devil's Advocate Hub]]] | [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/friday-night/offset/2|22:45, Therapy Pool]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
