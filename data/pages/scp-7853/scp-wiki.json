Until such a method of containment is discovered, specialized Foundation Task Force N-77 (“Whack a Mole”) are to focus their efforts on documenting, researching, and investigating information related to SCP-7853 and the Segreto crime family.\n\nN-77 agents and informants embedded in the American Mafia are to undergo biotechnical augmentation for the purposes of active information monitoring. This process includes the implementation of discreet listening and recording devices, primarily in the ocular region. All agents are to refrain from engaging in active sabotage of criminal activities or other actions that may draw attention to themselves until a holistic understanding of SCP-7853 is achieved.\n\nInformation related to SCP-7853 is classified to members of Task Force N-77. If this document is accessible to the Foundation at large [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7853 is an anomalous method of execution employed by GoI-027, the Segreto crime family, to assassinate individuals that threaten their activities.\n\nPhysical evidence of SCP-7853 has yet to be discovered, but known victims have corroborated a universal description of a component of the anomaly: a hulking, humanoid figure clothed in a trenchcoat, wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Its facial features are heavily obscured by shadow, save for the presence of red, luminescent eyes. This entity is invisible to all but the individual targeted by SCP-7853.\n\nVictims describe this entity as perpetually moving towards them at a steady pace. They are fully conscious of the figure’s location in relation to theirs at all times. Attempts to impede or slow the entity’s advance are futile, as victims describe the figure phasing through any obstacles placed in its way. Attempts to physically damage SCP-7853 invariably fail, potentially due to its incorporeality. SCP-7853 is reportedly capable of maintaining its own center of gravity, demonstrating this ability by walking on surfaces such as walls or ceilings if its path is obstructed.\n\nCompletion of SCP-7853 results in the targeted individual suddenly disappearing, leaving no physical trace of their body, presumably killing them. It is assumed that this occurs when the SCP-7853 entity reaches the victim, but due to the nature of the anomaly, little verifiable evidence exists to confirm this.\n\nHow SCP-7853 functions, whether it’s controlled remotely or is a sentient anomaly itself, and how targets are chosen remains unknown. All information regarding SCP-7853 has been obtained through Task Force N-77 agents embedded in organized criminal systems related to the Segreto crime family. All incidents suspected or confirmed to involve SCP-7853 also involved victims who were in conflict with the Segreto crime family.\n\nIt is possible that interfacing with information regarding SCP-7853 increases an individual’s likelihood to be targeted by the anomaly. N-77 agents aware of SCP-7853 and involved in the creation of this document have reported seeing a figure consistent with descriptions of the entity, though none have experienced being pursued or followed by it. \n\nAs of March, 2004, no Foundation deaths are suspected to have occurred as a result of SCP-7853.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Fuck[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Yeah, that’s helpful[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]this is what’s following you??[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]1:1[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]seriously joey what did you do[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Put my nose where it shouldn’t have been a hell of a lot less carefully than I could have been[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]what[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Site-22 has a big fucking problem, and I don’t know how deep it goes[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]We’re selling X-908 to the Segreto family[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Our site’s the hotbed.

An excerpt from the group’s Foundation intelligence dossier has been included below.\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\nGoI-027, also known as the Segreto crime family, is an organized crime group primarily operating in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. Unofficially referred to as the “Sixth Family” due to their powerful standing within the American Mafia, the organization has ties to an estimated 30% of known criminal activity in their locus of influence. This includes standard Mob operations, such as gambling, racketeering, trafficking, and theft, among others.\n\nGoI-027 is notable for its knowledge and usage of the anomalous. The use of paratechnology, targeting known Groups of Interest, smuggling anomalous objects, distributing anomalous drugs, and carrying out operations in populated Nexuses are further documented events that have warranted the organization’s GoI status.\n\nIt is believed a portion of GoI-027’s members are anomalous themselves. The Segretos have managed to gain access to information confidential to organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation, leading intelligence to believe that the Segretos have exploited information security flaws in both groups. The existence of Segreto informants within the Foundation is presently being investigated. \n\nAt the head of GoI-027 is an individual referred to as “The Duke”. The family’s structure and the identities of its members are largely unknown, though its overall origin can most likely be traced back to the folding of GoI-001, The Chicago Spirit, in the late 1940s. The majority of its history is lost, as American Mob culture has largely upheld the tradition of not openly speaking about GoI-027. Certain details regarding the family contradict themselves between sources, and Foundation informants have expressed fear over revealing information about GoI-027, potentially due to attracting the attention of SCP-7853. \n\nA number of Task Force N-77 members have succeeded in embedding themselves in GoI-027 or criminal organizations close to. Further intelligence reports are awaiting declassification.\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]N-77.

Lombardi had reportedly had sexual relations with the wife of a Segreto //Caporegieme//. Lombardi made several telephone calls to his peers panicking that he was being followed by an individual matching SCP-7853’s description. Soldiers stood guard at his compound, but could not see the assailant, even when Lombardi pointed directly to the entity. Lombardi drove off in his car in an attempt to escape, and was officially declared missing a week later. Presumed dead as a result of SCP-7853.\n\n> **Date:** 1995/04/27 \n> \n> **Victim:** Nicostrato Mazzanti \n> \n> **Description:** Mazzanti owned a prominent casino chain on the east coast, and became targeted by the Segretos after a dispute over earnings resulted in the deaths of several GoI-027 associates. Mazzanti reported flying from the United States to Italy in an attempt to flee SCP-7853. SCP-7853’s pursuit occured for over a week, and allegedly involved a crazed Mazzanti acquiescing to Segreto demands before being caught and presumably killed by the entity.\n\n> **Date:** 1998/09/04 \n> \n> **Victim:** Enzo “Zombie” Rosiello \n> \n> **Description:** Details of prior conflict with GoI-027 are unknown. Rosiello was noted to be a highly aggressive individual, and his continued operation was considered a massive risk for the Mob due to his frequent outbursts and sporadic killings. Rosiello believed he was being followed, and attempted to attack the assailant in broad daylight. According to bystanders, Rosiello fired several shots into the air that quickly disappeared. After a struggle, Rosiello disappeared after being dragged into a back alley by an unknown force.\n\n----\n\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]you read these yet[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Last one’s interesting.

A task force that no longer exists.\n\nIt’s March 13th, 2004. I’ve been on the run for two days. I’ve been investigating the Segreto family for the past decade of my life. And according to my memory, I’ve been doing it alone. But that memory’s wrong. There are names I can’t remember. People whose faces don’t register in my mind. Work I didn’t write that’s sitting in front of my face. It’s a family photo with everyone cut out. Except for me.\n\nThe last documents I know I didn’t write were uploaded two weeks ago. In those two weeks, Task Force N-77, a group of 77 Foundation personnel investigating the Segreto crime family, has been whittled down to one. And I can’t tell you a single thing about any of those people I risked my life with. It’s picking us off, and it’s making it seem like we never existed. And my mind believes it. But then I look at the mounds of work sitting in my office that I don’t remember writing, or the equipment that I could never operate, and I know it’s a lie.\n\nIt won’t stop until I’m dead. Until the only thing left of this team is a spare room that no one’s entered in years, and a file that no one has the clearance to access. \n\nI’m holed up on-site right now. Guards armed to the teeth. They know what’s happening, but it doesn’t matter, it’s still coming for me. And once I’m gone, they’ll all forget. No one’s going to remember what they were assigned to protect, or that any of us existed. Not like I remember them either.\n\nI declassified the file. Level 4 clearances. If this gets lost in the shuffle, start asking questions. We were all real. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]joey please you need to read this[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]SHIT[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]holy fuck are you okay??[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]I’M finE just hurt[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]i shot it[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]you fired off a shot in the middle of nyc? are you fucking stupid[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]waited until it was clsoe[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]paced around your building[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]shot it in the knees and the bullet hit but people still heard obv[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]guy tackled me fucked up my leg. got away b biting him[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]did you kill that thing??[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]no it just took the fucking shot like a tank[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]joey please read what i just sent[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]there’s an addendum that was reverted right after it was edited in. from the captain of the task force. last thing added to the page[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]i’m fucking hurt ill be there in a minute[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]please. it makes no sense, pls read it[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]what the Fuck[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]oh god of course[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]it’s the fucking compnd[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]the isomer?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]YES. the problem before was that this thing still left evidence behind, just like any other hitman. no body, no proof, but people still remembered[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]wht if u could make the memories disappear too?
