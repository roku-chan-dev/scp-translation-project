Except this year, there is a twist. We will be hosting the very first official 19cord Draft Swap! How does it work? I'm glad you asked. \n\nAlice submits a draft. The drafts are scrambled around between participants, and Alice winds up with Bob's draft, which she now has a few weeks to complete and change however she sees fit. Posting is optional, so don't feel pressured to submit if you don't want to, but this is a great opportunity to make new friends and write outside of your comfort zone!\n\nDraft Swap starts March 10th (hub goes up on the same day) and lasts until April 10th.\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n------\n\nHey all! As you might remember from the contest schedule earlier this year, there is an international contest coming up this month! Stay tuned at http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ to catch when it's released!\n\n**Edit: Unfortunately the International Contest had to be delayed by a month.

Every month there will be user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] or [[*user ProblemPal]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. \n\nThis month's prompts are below! \n\n[[size x-large]]It's not gonna be good[[/size]] //Submitted by ParallelPotatoes//\nWrite a story where everything just gets worse.\n\n[[size x-large]]Foundation Mundanity[[/size]] //Submitted by IndustryStandard//\nWrite a tale about something mundane that happens in the Foundation, like taking out the trash or paperwork!\n\nIf you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month's prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn't a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month's prompts as well!
