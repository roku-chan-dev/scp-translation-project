SCP-7894 has been reported to manifest as typical 'poltergeist' activity, with SCP-7894 incidents including the movement or disappearance of items, inexplicable noises, and disembodied voices. These sounds have been reported to mimic speech, environmental noises, conversations, recordings, and even specific individual's voices. Those affected by SCP-7894 have also reported persistent feelings of being watched, but have stated they ##c40233|can't explain## or identify a source.\n\nTo date, SCP-7894 has not shown to cause any major disruptions on site. Staff have been encouraged to document potential evidence for SCP-7894 activity for research purposes.\n\nA partial list of various missing items attributed to SCP-7894 are as follows;\n\n- Seven phones of different models.\n- Three separate lightbulbs illuminating the East wing.\n- ##c40233|Over one-hundred## mundane documents relating to security camera observations.\n- An entire lockbox filled with tape recordings.\n- Over thirty more classified reports relating to civilian and ##c40233|Foundation casualties##.\n- The entire contents of the East wing's security room.\n- Fifteen security cameras across three offices.\n- One standard issue Foundation lab coat covered in crude drawings.\n\n##c40233|It is not## known how many items have been lost in total. While some misplaced items attributed to SCP-7894 may be the result of ##c40233|human## error, the volume of missing materials seem to suggest anomalous activity.\n\nNo trigger or discernible pattern for SCP-7894 occurrences has been discovered as of yet.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 7894-1: Outbound Requests**\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-7894 a number of requests have been made to replace lost equipment and documentation, as well as various requests for tools, staff, or other actions to be taken. All requests have been reviewed by acquisition staff on Site-61.\n\nRequests are as follows:\n\n||~ Request ||~ Purpose ||~ Outcome||\n||Replacement ##c40233|Information## Documents ||Replace all lost ##c40233|documentation## due to SCP-7894's effects/##c40233|staff## error. ||Approved||\n||Replacement Security Equipment ||Replace all lost equipment due to SCP-7894's effects. ||Approved||\n||Shipment of Food Supplies ||Replace ##c40233|all## provisions lost to SCP-7894's effects or ##c40233|consumed## by staff. ||Approved||\n||Shipment of Heavy Weaponry ||Security purposes. ||Denied||\n||Assistance ||No reason given. ||Denied||\n||Extraction ||No reason given. ||Denied||\n||help ||No reason given. ||Denied||\n||N/A ||No reason given. ||Denied||\n||N/A ||No reason given. ||Denied||\n\n##c40233|It's## noted that ##c40233|over## 200 blank requests have been automatically denied and removed from the above record. Please avoid submitting blank requests in future. Thank you.

I am part of the team dedicated to researching SCP-7894's recorded 'poltergeist' activity and archiving it accordingly. Over the past several months we have had no major leads regarding the activity on site, and we are content to simply file it as a low risk anomaly.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves shuffles in his chair.//@@]@@\n\n\"We weren't sure if it was anomalous to begin with but uh, it has definitely proven us wrong! The Director has even sent out a really important message every day as a reminder to report potential evidence, you know? But uh, s-some of the stuff we reported just made things more complicated.\"\n\n@@[@@//Ten seconds of silence.//@@]@@\n\n\"In the end, we had to really be careful what was filed away. We could get in big trouble with our bosses if we filed the wrong thing or wrote something the wrong way. They're quite the sticklers here! If they decided you shared the wrong thing, or even shared too much, you could be terminated. And the others, God, before they all... made mistakes, they even tried filing personal mail as evidence. Letters to loved ones, requests for assistance, self termination letters. Y-you know, things like that? It didn't matter in the end though, they've all been... erased now.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves begins to audibly sob.//@@]@@\n\n\"B-but anyway! The uh... th-the SCP in question has been keeping us all here around the clock! It- I mean the ones in charge just w-won't let us leave. Hours are long and, well, we all miss our families a lot. Including me. God I really do.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves begins to sniff and continues crying.//@@]@@\n\n\"B-but I get it! Gotta keep these things contained no matter what, huh? Some of them, hoo boy they are... they are super dangerous. Like, if they got out? End-of-the-world type dangerous.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves lets out a forced laugh. Light knocking can be heard at the door.@@]@@//\n\n\"So w-what we do, we do to keep the world s-safe! What I'm doing is to keep the world safe. Keep everyone safe. Keep Jacob safe.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves voice begins to crack and waver//@@]@@\n\n\"I'm sorry, Jacob, I'm so s-sorry. I won't be able to take you out to see your s-sister this weekend. I won't be able to see Mr. Monocles again e-either. And I really wish I could see you, see you both, god, even just spend one more night together. Just to hear your voice, hear Monocles' little meows. Just to fall asleep in your arms one more time. Just us, our little happy family. Just one m-more t-time.\"\n\n@@[@@//Researcher Hargreaves' sobs grow louder.//@@]@@\n\n\"Please just be happy o-ok? I love you so much. More than anything.
