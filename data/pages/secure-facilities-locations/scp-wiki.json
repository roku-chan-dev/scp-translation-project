It's main purpose is to be a hub for containment and research for these anomalies. It also serves as an observation post for the Nile river, a location that has very recently become an area of high anomalous activity.\n\nCurrently, the site suffers from gross mismanagement, mainly stemming from a lack of funding or aid from Central Command. The effects of this mismanagement include a lack of proper cooling equipment, outdated audio/visual systems and inadequate on-site containment facilities.

Sites are often built in relatively close proximity to civilian populations, where facilities would require such cover.\n\n++ Area\n\nFoundation facilities designated as Areas are //clandestine// facilities, meaning that civilians are not aware of their existence at all. Such facilities are often built far away from civilian populations and may contain highly dangerous anomalies and extreme fail-safe measures such as on-site nuclear warheads.\n\n++ Outposts\n\nOutposts are small facilities subordinate to a nearby Site or Area, used to contain immobile objects or to monitor anomalous locations.\n\n++ Observation Posts\n\nObservation Posts are tiny facilities, often small standalone buildings or single units within larger buildings, and are typically used to monitor regional communications, nearby Foundation facilities, or immobile SCP objects. Many Observation Posts also serve as secure communications hubs or safe-houses for undercover Foundation agents.\n\n@@ @@\n+ Prefixes\n\nThese prefixes are often used to denote specializations of facilities or facility sections, and are often omitted even in internal communication. These prefixes are not exclusive and can be used together to form a Facility name, and additional prefixes may be used for sites with a particular specialisation. Certain terms have been assigned their own color codes to enable Sites and Areas with a similar function to be more easily identified.\n\n++ ##a00|Armed##\n\nArmed denotes a facility or facility section with abnormally high physical security concerns, either due to containment of violent hostile entities or threat of outside attack. Such facilities typically have a large amount of military-grade weaponry and vehicles as well as a disproportionately large number of permanent security staff; in the case of a full facility, this typically entails a detachment of at least battalion or regiment strength.\n\n++ ##060|Biological##\n\nBiological or Bio-facilities contain and research living organisms and infectious or otherwise biohazardous anomalies. These facilities are both isolated and self-contained to prevent the escape and spread of these entities.\n\n++ Containment\n\nContainment facilities or facility sections are primarily equipped and intended for the mass containment of anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena.\n\n++ ##606|Dimensional##\n\nDimensional containment facilities or facility sections deal with extradimensional apertures or anomalies exhibiting inconsistent or warped spacetime, or anomalies of ontokinetic nature in general.\n\n++ ##743|Humanoid##\n\nHumanoid containment facilities or facility sections primarily deal with sentient, sapient human or near-human entities capable of understanding and complying with instructions, and often attempt to develop means of communication with them to facilitate containment.\n\n++ Exclusionary\n\nMost often used by [[[welcome-to-delta-t|Δt personnel]]], [[[scp-3936| Exclusionary Sites]]] are unaffected by reality-changing effects, and are often built outside of reality itself.\n\n++ Extrasolar \n\nExtrasolar Facilities are located outside of the Solar System containing the planet Earth.\n\n++ ##777|Lunar##\n\nA Lunar facility is located on the moon, for the containment of extraplanetary anomalies.\n\n++ ##ea805c|Protected##\n\nProtected facilities and facility sections are \"safe zones\" kept free of anomalous influence. No anomalies are allowed within these facilities at any time. Generally used for administration, data storage, and for housing essential personnel.\n\n++ Provisional\n\nProvisional facilities are those that are established or built around an immobile anomaly. Provisional facilities typically contain only a single anomaly, although many Provisional facilities have later been expanded to contain additional anomalies.\n\n++ ##04b|Reliquary##\n\nReliquary facilities or facility sections are designed for handling artifacts and objects of religious or historical significance.\n\n++ Research\n\nResearch facilities or facility sections are designed for either the handling and study of anomalies or anomalous materials, or research and development into new containment schemes and methods.\n\n++ ##777|Storage##\n\nStorage facilities or facility sections are intended for long-term mass storage of non-anomalous material or inert anomalies  with no risk of autonomous interaction, including [[[log-of-anomalous-items |Anomalous Items]]] and inanimate Safe-class SCP objects.\n\n++ Surveillance \n\nSurveillance sites monitor their surroundings, or send field operatives out further afield, in order to search for anomalies not currently in containment.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab About this Page]]\n\n[[size 120%]]**What Is This Page?**[[/size]]\n\nThis is a list of Foundation facilities that have been extensively and consistently used across multiple articles. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive or exhaustive -- there's [[[facilities-complete-list|another page for that]]]. If you are writing a work set in the SCP universe, you are free to use any of the existing facilities, or to make up your own facility and give it any designation you choose.\n\nIn-universe, inconsistencies in the database can be explained by disinformation, timeliness of information, anomalous influence and alternative timelines/realities. For example, Site-06 was not always located in France and is explicitly listed as the third such facility to receive the designation. Certain other sites might no longer be in operation or even have been deliberately fabricated to mislead agents from rival organizations.\n\n----\n[[size 120%]]**Why is there a separate map of International Facilities? Where can I find out more about them?**[[/size]]\n\nThe SCP Foundation [[[scp-international| has a number of translation branches]]], and most of them have their own list of facilities, which are linked below the map  - both original articles, and translations where those exist. If you want to find out more, I recommend following the links!  Since the requirements for inclusion vary, and many branches have a different system for naming their own sites, it was simplest to put them on a separate map. The color coding indicates areas where that language is the most widely spoken - for regions left in grey, the main language spoken there doesn't have a translation Wiki yet. It's mostly just to make it clearer which Facilities belong to which branch, and whether or not the Foundation has different branches in-universe is left up to individual authors to decide.\n\nIf Sites or Areas from other branches meet the requirements for inclusion on this list (5 Appearances or a Secure Facility Dossier published on this Wiki), they can be added to it, although so far the only one that has been added is Site-34 from the Spanish-speaking branch.\n\n----\n[[size 120%]]**Why are there two Site-45s? (And other numbering issues)**[[/size]]\n\nAuthors are free to use any facility number they like, and so most facility numbers have been used inconsistently in various articles. While these can sometimes be considered the \"same facility\", or omitted due to being very minor, at other times (e.g. with Site-45) there are multiple versions of the same Site that meet the requirements to be included on this list. If you want an in-universe explanation, perhaps different branches or departments of the Foundation have their own numbering systems?\n\n----\n[[size 120%]]**Just How Big Is The Foundation?**[[/size]]\n\nThis is entirely up to the author. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is very small, consisting of only half a dozen facilities or less, and no more than a thousand personnel - in which case, it makes a lot of sense to include only a few of these facilities (or none at all) in your personal version of the Foundation. Some choose to believe that the Foundation is vastly larger and far-reaching, employing hundreds of thousands of personnel squirreled away in hundreds of facilities around the globe - perhaps all of these facilities and every number in between! Neither is incorrect, and whatever works better to further your narrative is the one that's appropriate. \n\nAn important thing to remember is that there is [[[canon-hub| not one canon, but many]]], and the above list is merely a collection of some of the more noteworthy Sites and Areas that have been consistently used in articles. The fact that they coexist on this page does not mean they all coexist in-universe as well - that's entirely up to the author.\n\n----\n\n[[size 120%]]**What are all these Site and Area Insignia?**[[/size]]\n\nThey were initially created by [[*user Jerden]] and [[*user HarryBlank]], in part to make this page more visually appealing and easier to navigate. They can be freely used (or freely ignored) outside of this page, and many sites have their own logos in a different style. Many of the more recent Site Insignia have been made by other people - advice and templates are attached to [[[jerden-insignia| this art page]]]. The font used for the text is [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee Bungee].\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Adding to Existing Entries]]\nAnyone is welcome to add additional Contained Objects (SCPs) or Notable Incidents (Tales, GoI Formats, and SCPs where the facility is featured prominently but is not actually containing the object) to the entries for existing Facilities, as long as the SCP or Tale doesn't describe the Site or Area in a way that is inconsistent with the description here. If the Facility has its own Secure Facility Dossier, that will generally contain similar lists. \n\nIndividual SCPs and Tales linked from this page may still contradict each other since authors are free to use a Facility without considering all other works set there as canon. For new SCPs and tales, it's best to wait a few days before adding it, to make sure that it isn't deleted or rewritten. Humorous Addenda are for Joke SCPs, and for tales that are obvious parodies.\n\nThe SCP Lists for [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-06-scp|Site-06]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-17-scp|Site-17]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-19-scp|Site-19]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-23-scp|Site-23]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-66-scp|Site-66]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-73-scp|Site-73]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-76-scp|Site-76]]], [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-83-scp|Site-83]]] and [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-area-12-scp|Area-12]]] are long enough that they've been placed on separate fragment pages and listed via the [[include]] component, as have the [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-17-incidents|Site-17]]] and [[[fragment:secure-facilities-locations-site-19-incidents|Site-19]]] incident lists, but they can still be added to, you'll just have to edit the list on the fragment page.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Adding New Entries]]\n\n[[size 120%]]**Requirements for Inclusion**[[/size]]\n\nNew facilities may be added to this list if the Site or Area has been used in a consistent way in at least five articles (by any author), or if the Site has its own Secure Facility Dossier. Entries that do not meet this requirement will be removed. \n\n[[size 120%]]**Contact Information**[[/size]]\n\nThis page is the responsibility of the [http://05command.wikidot.com/curation-main Curation Team].

Alternatively, you can add it yourself, if it definitely meets the requirements and you feel confident putting it into the right format.\n* Facility Name and Number (e.g. Armed Biological Containment Area-14) \n* A short description of the facility's function, ideally with details that make your Site or Area stand out - we already have a lot of rather generic containment facilities.\n* Links to at least five articles describing SCP objects contained there or incidents occurring there, or a link to your Secure Facility Dossier.\n\nA defined location for your site is optional, but including it in the post will enable your Facility to be added to the Map.\nIf your site is the focus of a canon or tale series, mention this and it can be prominently featured below the description.\n\nThe attached .svg templates can be used to create new [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facilities-locations/template-site.svg Site] and [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facilities-locations/template-area.svg Area] icons in the same style as the ones already on this page, but the creation of a logo is optional, and you can just use the default icon. While we try to keep the icons in the grid consistent with each other, you're welcome to add insignia in a different style to this page to appear on the popout, especially if there's a more detailed alternative design.\n\n[[size 120%]]**Template for Additions**[[/size]]\n\nWhen adding a new site to the list, use the following template.\n\n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n{{@@[[include :scp-wiki:fragment:site-snippets start=--@@}}\n{{|type=site/area |number=XXX}}\n{{]]}}\n@@+ Site or Area Name@@\nDescription of Site/Area\n{{@@[[include :scp-wiki:fragment:site-snippets | end=--]]@@}}\n[[/div]]\n\nTo use a custom icon, capitalize SITE or AREA, and add an {{icon}} parameter specifying the URL of the image.
