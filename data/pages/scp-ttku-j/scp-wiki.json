  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=ttku.jpg|\n    caption=Summary of SCP-TTKU-J's desires\n]]\n**Item #:** SCP-TTKU-J\n\n**Object Class:** Keter, because it can and will kill you\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-TTKU-J is contained in a reinforced standard containment cell at Area-0000 - far away from you, whom it wants to kill. Due to the fact that SCP-TTKU-J is a very dangerous thing that desires to and has the means to kill you, SCP-TTKU-J is to not be handled by you specifically. This containment method would render you effectively immortal as far as SCP-TTKU-J's killing-you objective is concerned.\n\n**Description:** SCP-TTKU-J is a thing that kills you. Though murder is an illegal action in every national jurisdiction on Earth, condemned in most religious scriptures, and generally looked down upon, SCP-TTKU-J as an entity has no regard for any rule against killing you and has the means to do so in multiple ways - including, but not limited to:\n* Use of a weapon to kill you,\n* Use of a torture device to torture you, then kill you,\n* Use of its own bare [REDACTED]s to kill you,\n* Enlisting the aid of different thing that kills you as a means to kill you,\n* Killing you until your life functions cease, then continuing to kill you,\n* --Giving you a hug-- use of anomalous means to kill you, and\n* [DATA EXPUNGED] ██ ████ you.\n\nIn the event of a total containment breach of SCP-TTKU-J, the inevitable result would be a URK-class you-are-about-to-be-killed event, followed by a UHK-class you-have-been-killed scenario. As you are, presumably, a thing that should not be killed, the latter scenario is to be avoided at all costs.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Interview with SCP-TTKU-J, 2/23/15:**\n> **Dr. Henderson:** Good morning, SCP-TTKU-J, I hope you're doing well.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Eh, could be better. Right now, all I can think about is how much I want to kill you in many different ways.\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** You know we can't allow you to do that.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I figured as much. Still, it would be very nice if you'd let me stick a shiv into your ribcage right this very minute, until your heart stops. \n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Believe me, I've felt the same way many times.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** About yourself?\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Not quite.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Man, I could go for some good ol'-fashioned you-murder right about now.\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Isn't there anything else you think about?\n> \n> //(Brief pause)//\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I want to take up knitting.\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** That's harmless enough.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Because I could lure you into a false sense of security, then, when you least expect it, BAM! One knitting needle in each eye, as I tear out your heart with my teeth!\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** This conversation is going nowhere.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Obviously not! We haven't murdered you yet!\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** If you hypothetically could kill me, what do you intend to do afterwards?\n>  \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Hmm... I kinda want to start a grindcore outfit.\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** What would it be called?\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** \"Pile of Dead You.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** ...we're done here.\n\n[[module ListUsers users=\".\"]] \n**Addendum 2 - Interview 2/24/15:**\n> **Dr. Henderson:** Hello again. Please do not kill me.\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** I make no promises there, buddy.\n> \n> **Dr. Henderson:** Is there anyone else you'd like to kill other than me?\n> \n> //(SCP-TTKU-J pauses in thought)//\n> \n> **SCP-TTKU-J:** Well, there's always that \"%%title%%\" asshole.\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Name:** ttku.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user daveyoufool]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
