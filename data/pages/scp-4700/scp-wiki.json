Operations personnel are to ensure that SCP-4700-1 is both invisible and intangible at all times until instructed otherwise. \n\nThe Finnfolk[[footnote]] Previously SCP-████. [[/footnote]] have been granted permanent asylum aboard SCP-4700-1 under the tenets of the Foundation-Finnfolk Cooperative Agreement. Containment of individual Finnfolk has been deemed unnecessary due to their historical role in containment of hostile and dangerous anomalies.\n\nIn the event of an SCP-001 Failure event, SCP-4700-1 is to be deployed to a predetermined location for Deific subjugation. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4700 is the designation assigned to several large-scale submersible vehicles under the joint Foundation-Finnfolk command of Operation HIGH TIDE. Each vehicle has been designated SCP-4700-1 onward. At this time, SCP-4700-1 is complete; SCP-4700-2 through -4 are under construction.\n\nSCP-4700-1 is a large, motile, deep-sea vehicle resembling //Coenobita brevimanus//,[[footnote]]Members of this species do not inhabit large shells, a notable difference that SCP-4700-1 does not retain.[[/footnote]] a large species of \"hermit crab\". At its broadest point, it is approximately 5 kilometers in width; its highest point is approximately 3 kilometers terminating at a singular point along its shell. The vehicle portion of SCP-4700-1's interior consists of roughly 250 individual levels/decks, occupied by a diverse array of tall, narrow hallways and facilities necessary for maintaining the vehicle's functions and providing sufficient habitation for its crew for long periods of time.\n\nSCP-4700-1 serves as the home and capital for the thaumotologically advanced, aquatic hominid race known as the Finnfolk, (//Homo aqueous//) [[footnote]] SCP-4700-1 is referenced in numerous literary works, official records, and artistic depictions during the late Bronze Age up until the end of the Roman Empire. The most notable of these references originate from obscure pieces of Orkney Folklore, with references to the Finnfolk as being the Mither's chosen people. Such references revere the vehicle as a gift from the goddess, and the peoples who reside in it as holy champions. Numerous sightings of the vehicle during this period are recorded, often with inconsistent details that are currently not present. [[/footnote]] though the events of I-4700-01 have significantly reduced the extant population. It also serves as a large-scale military assault vehicle and weapons platform. Historical recordings and motifs are prevalent throughout the structure and decorations of the vehicle in the forms of murals. \n\nDuring normal motion, all components of SCP-4700-1 remain both invisible and selectively intangible through advanced thaumotology, allowing it to remain hidden and unobstructed in oceanic areas possessing significantly shallower depths than its maximal height. [[footnote]]Motion is the proximal method by which this function is activated; however, it can also be switched on and off at will by operation crews, allowing entry into and exit from the vehicle.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-4700-1 can be further subdivided into two sections, designated SCP-4700-1-A and SCP-4700-1-B, based on function.\n\n+++++ SCP-4700-1-A\n\nSCP-4700-1-A designates the crab-like portion of the vehicle, which is responsible for locomotion along the sea floor, and for all defensive and offensive measures protecting the vehicle. The hull is made of various organo-metallic polymers[[footnote]]Isotope dating indicates all of these alloys were forged 4800 years before the necessary metallurgical processes to smith such metals were invented.[[/footnote]].  Segments of SCP-4700-1-A have been painted and adorned with various colors, including pinks, greens, yellows, and blues forming the visage of a four-eyed human woman. Additional structural features of SCP-4700-1-A include: \n\n* 130 weapon emplacements along the dorsal ridge.\n* Direct beam emplacements on the eye stalks, used for multi-direction energy channeling and deep sea lighting. \n* Rapid electrostatic discharge devices along the interior of each claw.\n* A single large bore weapon attached along the bottom of the vehicle's hull. \n* Carrier bays allowing deployment of smaller submersible vessels.\n* Large grooved alcoves at staggered positions along the hull, emit blue light when properly powered, and repel all projectiles regardless of composition.\n\n+++++ SCP-4700-1-B\n\nAttached to the tail of SCP-4700-1-A is a green-blue corundum structure resembling a spiked, symmetric gastropod shell. When not intangible, SCP-4700-1-B refracts all light entering its immediate vicinity, creating a localized aurora due to intricately carved murals. These auroras depict various events in the history of the Finnfolk. [[footnote]]Recovered records indicate this phenomenon served both as a form of long-term information storage, and as a beacon to returning expeditions.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Cylinder.png|\n    caption=Cutaway Diagram of SCP-4700-1's interior displaying the three nested cylinders.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Spacecolony3edit.jpeg.jpeg|\n    caption=An O'Neil Cylinder, a theoretical space colonization structure which the interior of SCP-4700-1-B closely resembles.\n]]\n\nSCP-4700-1-B's interior does not align with the dimensions of the exterior crystal structure. It contains a gradually sloping cylindrical space (60 kilometers in diameter and length), which is partially hollow, connected to SCP-4700-1-A by sliding lead-lined doors. An image of this space has been attached to this document in order to aid in visualizing the following description. \n\nThe interior of the cylinder consists of three hollowed out, nested, free-floating cylinders, with smoother, sloped edges. Each nested cylinder is described below:\n\n\n* A, D, and G represent the solid cylinders. Each cylinder is 3 km thick and is made up of bedrock and topsoil.\n* B represents the hollow space between cylinders 1 and 2. Contains a significant terrestrial and aquatic biosphere with a predominantly, oceanic, lake, and river-based ecosystems, with a singular mountain chain running across the middle of the cylinder's surface. Nomadic tribes of Finnfolk are present and were able to evade the consequences of Incident I-4700-01.\n* E represents the hollow space between cylinders 2 and 3. It is filled with saltwater and hosts a number of agrarian complexes. These are insufficient to support the population of H. \n* H represents a large urban environment on the surface of cylinder 3. It previously housed 8-10 million Finnfolk and was served by a transport network of current driven Canals.\n* C and F represent intersections of hollow space with cylinders 2 and 3 respectively. They are covered in corundum and provide light in day-night circles in a similar manner to SCP-4700-1-B.\n* I represents the hollow interior of cylinder 3.\n* J represents the approximate location of an [[[SCP-3703]]] instance, encased in diamond, and connected to a system of tubes which provide energy to the rest of SCP-4700-1. Also serves as a light source for cylinder 3.\n\nLarge columns of glass enclose dual lane, current driven water highways that are attached to, and permeate each subsequent cylinder. This allows for free movement between the different layers.\n\n\n+++++ Additional Schematic Information\n\nSCP-4700-1 has experienced extensive and varied modification in its 5000-year history, which will be covered in full in Document D-4700-1-17. A few of the more notable modifications are presented below:\n\n* Improvised desalination plants at 8 points along the exterior of the vehicle, 4 along SCP-4700-1-A and 4 along SCP-4700-1-B. \n* Expansion of SCP-4700-1-B well beyond its original size to accommodate a large influx of Finnfolk populations due to territory conflicts with humans.\n* Incorporation of net deployment mechanisms for corralling and capturing schools of fish during movement, alongside automated smaller vehicles.\n* 1300 functional undocumented variants of [[[SCP-3706]]]. Holding bays within both sections of SCP-4700-1 are capable of inundating up to 15400 vehicles of varying size.[[footnote]]Vehicles of large sizes are primarily kept within SCP-4700-4-1B.[[/footnote]] --Reasoning behind the absence of the majority of these vehicles is unknown.--(See Reactivation Log and historical documents).\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"Access fileserv:/S:/4700-1/records/Discovery.Log\" hide=\"Hide Discovery Log\"]]\n\n**Initial Discovery log:** \n\nThe following transcript depicts the initial approach and discovery of SCP-4700-1. \n[[div style=\"background:#F5F5F5;\" \"float: center; border: solid 3px #666666; width: 100%; padding: 2px 10px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[div style=\"background-color:#990036\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"color:white\"]]**{{Discovery Log}}**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Discovery Log SCP-4700-D**\n\n**Date:** ██/██/████\n\n**Discovery Team:** Delta-7 Recons 1, 2 and 3. \n\n**Vehicles:** Mark 4 advanced submersibles. \n \n**Field Leader:** Silus Smith\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-4700-1 was discovered following the events of Incident I-3700-032. Three submersibles were deployed to identify a previously undetected metallic object on the seafloor. Visibility in the post-incident aftermath was notably poor due to large quantities of silt and sand debris. Recon teams were directed to proceed to the target locations. Due to abnormal topography generated by both the object and SCP-3700, Recon teams descended 10 km before reaching the object, at which time contact with Recon teams 2 and 3 was lost. \n----\n**Begin Log**\n\n[Recon teams depart from NTF Delta-7 and begin their descent. The subs proceed to dive 10 km, due to the anomalous nature of SCP-3700's depth.]\n\n[At the end of their descent, recon teams begin accelerating forwards at 15 km/h. Visibility is noted to be severely reduced due to a large cloud of silt and sand, obscuring all visibility within 30 meters of the submersibles. On the ocean floor, a distinctly large number of wrecks from varying historical periods are visible, alongside a number of non-functional SCP-3706 instances. Skeletal remains of several large unidentified species are briefly visible, before the ocean floor shifts, and additional debris obscures further observation.]\n\n[Over the course of the next 10 minutes of footage, the Three recon subs proceed towards the source of a singular large sonar ping. The dust and silt remain constant; however, at several points during their progression, recon 1's camera captures small dark shapes moving through the debris. After approximately 30 minutes of travel, Recon 1, 2, and 3 all capture images of a large humanoid hand drawing across the ocean floor, the rest of its limb obscured by the cloud. At a later point, four round sources of yellow light are visible through the cloud.]\n\n[At 45 minutes, recon teams exit part of the debris cloud into a dome of clear water near the ocean bed. Turbulence shakes the cameras as they pass through a barely visible membrane in the water. In front of them is SCP-4700-1, collapsed on the ocean floor with a 50 m hole in its side. The front half of the vehicle is unpowered and inert, the Proto-Nordic runes across its surface dark. From the hole back, runes are visibly glowing, and energy discharges are observed emanating from the hole.]\n\n[Recon teams proceed in their approach of the vehicle. The camera on each sub is swiveled in a broad arc to capture any potential details. When the subs draw within 200 m of the vehicle, significant turbulence begins, accompanied by blue streaks of light. At this time, footage and communication from recons 2 and 3 cease. Recon team 1's footage is obscured with static, depicting numerous dark shapes resembling large ocean fauna, and streaks of multicolored luminescent light. Recon one appears to avoid pursuing entities for approximately one minute before the video feed is lost.]\n\n**Epilogue:** Following the apparent loss of recon teams 1, 2, and 3, armed task forces were briefed and prepared for neutralization of potential hostile entities, and boarding SCP-4700-1.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"background:#F5F5F5;\" \"float: center; border: solid 3px #666666; width: 100%; padding: 2px 10px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[div style=\"background-color:#990036\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"color:white\"]]**{{Recovered Materials A}}**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n{{The following section contains materials recovered from SCP-4700-1.

Prior to launch, communication was reestablished with Recon team 1.\n\n[[div style=\"background:#F5F5F5;\" \"float: center; border: solid 3px #666666; width: 100%; padding: 2px 10px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[div style=\"background-color:#990036\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"color:white\"]]**{{Exploration Log 1}}**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Date:** ██/██/████ Three hours post discovery.\n\n**Exploration Team:** Recon 1\n\n**Field Leader:** Silus Smith (R-Cap)\n\n**Team:** Rugio Balet (R-3, Demolitions), Sarah Ochev (R-4, Engineer), Zirron Wong (R-5, Scout), Robert Sheffield (R-6, Linguistics, and thaumotology), Jane Sandora (Pilot, R-2, Second in command)\n\n----\n**Begin Log**\n\n[Radio Communications regained with Recon Team 1 at approximately 17:38, three hours after loss of contact. Video feeds remained offline.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Ughh...\"\n\n**NTF Command:** \"Recon 1, do you read?\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Agh... roger command, you're coming through.\"\n\n**NTF Command:** \"Recon Captain, what is your status? We lost visual contact three hours ago, and have not been able to reestablish.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Alive, for the moment.\" \n\n[Sounds of rubble moving and creaking metal are audible.]\n\n**NTF-Command:** \"What is the status of your team?\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"Great question.\" [R-Cap opens radio frequencies for broader communication.] \"Alright, headcount: who's dead, who's alive, and who's hurt?\"\n\n[All five radios of the remaining recon team members reactivate, and begin broadcasting. Several groans are recorded, followed by shifting rubble.]\n\n**R-2:** \"We're alive cap, not that the crash did my back any favors.\"\n\n**R-4:** [With a thick Russian Accent] \"What the hell hit us? Felt like a bomb.\"\n\n**R-3:** \"It wasn't me this time, I swear.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Cut the chatter, we all took a tumble. Ochev, get the door open, we need to see where we landed. Sandora, check on the Tactical Team.\"\n\n[Footsteps and additional rubble being moved. A mechanical whirring is heard as the exterior door of the submersible is opened. R-2's mic broadcasts a series of expletives.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Tactical didn't make it. Figured out why we lost control too.\"\n\n**R-6:** \"How bad is it?\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Bad bad. Bits everywhere bad. Took a direct hit from one of those things, the engine blew up, took tactical with them. Its a wonder we made it... wherever we are.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"Big hangar, lots of open space. Blood everywhere.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Loss of tactical may preclude us from going further. Command, sub is totalled, took a direct hit to the engine compartment. Tactical bit it. We're in some sort of hangar complex in the unpowered part of whatever this thing is. Long and short of it, we got fucked by a swarm of laser shooting fish, and we're stranded without fire support.\"\n\n**NTF-Command:** \"Understood R-Cap. Hold position while we determine your next course of action.\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"Understood.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"I got a bad feeling about all of this.\"\n\n**R-3:** \"You get bad feelings about everything.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"They usually aren't wrong!\"\n\n**R-3:** \"That's because you're a walking cliche 90% of the time.\"\n\n[Extraneous discussion removed.]\n\n**NTF-Command:** \"R-Cap, your new prerogative is to explore the interior of the object until extraction and/or additional support are able to arrive. Document and collect artifacts, documents, schematics, and details on the vehicle's functions and its inhabitants.  Your primary objective is to cross the breach observed in approach footage and identify the function of the large crystal structure. Additionally, reset your cameras. We are currently not receiving video feeds.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Roger command. Alright, folks, you heard the lady, pack it up, grab tactical's weapons, and let's get a move on. Wong, Balet, you've got point. Sandora and I have rear. Ochev, Sheffield, you're in the middle. Keep chatter to a minimum. We don't know who or what's here, and if they're hostile. Everyone stay close, and for the love of all that is holy, do not touch anything that's glowing or pulsing until Ochev gives the go ahead.\"\n\n[Rest of Recon confirms. Cameras are reset. A large open facility with racks containing an indeterminate number of SCP-3706 instances line the walls to either side. The sub is visible as R-6 rotates to capture the interior, the back of the vehicle is breached, and the remainder crushed together as if it were a tin can.]\n\n[Large grooved channels run across the room. Team members activate their headlamps. They proceed into the hangar after retrieving tactical's heavier weapons. At this time, it was noted that tactical teams were not equipped with thaumotologic weaponry.] \n\n[Dark liquid trails along the floors of the hangar, accompanied by dented metal. R-6 recovers several personal items/artifacts including a toy humanoid figurine[[footnote]] With painted scales and fins along the arms and legs.[[/footnote]], several small nonfunctional square devices with cracked glass surfaces, and a case/trunk filled with waterproof clothing derived from Algal products.]\n\n[The exploration team exits the hangar complex into a series of maneuverable large hallways, which branch at unusually spaced intervals. A film of water is visible along the floor, reaching ankle depth. Channels run along the walls. Doors are spaced at inconsistent intervals and tight junctions. The team attempts to access them, but they are unsuccessful as the unpowered doors fail to respond.]\n\n[Engravings are carved at each branching point. R-6's camera pauses at each mural capturing them in detail. Occasionally side halls have trails of dark liquid leading down them, and every three or four, arrows and illegible runic script are scribbled, above or below the engravings.]\n\n[As the party proceeds deeper into SCP-4700-1, they pass a number of moving picture posters and depictions of a singular Finnfolk figure with yellow scales. Scrolling Proto-Nordic runes on these posters translate into mandates and requisitions of specific individuals who were selected for a \"Holy War Against the Demons\" followed by changing dates, and long lists of names. Several posters have been defaced with graffiti reading \"Skreyja Sends us not to Glory, but to Die. We all go to [Coordinates Redacted][[footnote]] Coordinates are now believed to have been associated with SCP-████.[[/footnote]] until the beacons are lit.\"]\n\n[Shadows are noted to move as they approach, Recon Team 1 does not notice this and are not informed by Command. The group reaches a crossroads branch, R-Cap holds up a hand signaling to stop, as R-5 looks down each hallway. A single doorway is open to their right, and three hallways in front. The water is darker to the right. Dark liquid is streaked along the right wall and continues down the rightmost hallway. A humanoid hand is visible for two seconds before it vanishes around a corner.]\n\n**R-5:** \"Anyone else hear that?\"\n\n[The party ceases all movement. Hooves contacting metal and splashes are audible.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Everyone, in the room now. Go go.\" \n\n[The door to the room is moved to prevent entrance, leaving enough room for a camera to be fit through. Headlamps are extinguished, night vision is enabled. An [[[SCP-3456]]][[footnote]] Notably different from previously observed instances due to gills on the neck of both the human and horse portions of the body, and fins attached to all limbs.[[/footnote]] instance enters into frame and sniffs the air. Four humanoids, 1.5 meters in height come into frame. They are covered in warts, and have disproportionately large, twisted arms.]\n\n[The SCP-3456 instance walks towards the door in which the exploration team is hidden, sniffing the air, before a loud metallic bang echoes from the direction of the far left hallway. The equine turns, and emits a high-pitched scream, before galloping full speed in that direction, knocking over three of the humanoids, which scramble to follow the entity.]\n\n[Five minutes of silence.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Well, we're fucked.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"That may yet be an understatement, Jane. Command, please be advised, we have 3456 aboard, I repeat we have 3456 aboard.\"\n\n**NTF Command:** \"Acknowledged R-Cap. Mission remains the same.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"They're not serious, are they?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"I'm not one to normally protest... but this feels like a suicide mission.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"This doesn't look good. Perhaps we should go back to the hangar?\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"Negative. We press on. We've been through worse than this. Just gotta play it smart.\" \n\n[Headlamps are turned back on, and the party observes the room. SCP-3456 instances can be heard vocalizing, in addition to creaking metal, and far lower frog-like vocalizations. The room is an armory, and navigation hub, with a number of large bows and sharpened, feather-like projectiles, and three-pronged tridents, all of which glow dimly. R-6 explores the interior of the room settling on an elevated table-like device. A small cube is slotted into the middle of the table which emits a constant dull blue luminescence. Inverted humanoid shadows are visible, unnoticed by the team.]\n\n**R-3:** [Picks up one of the bows, and a quiver of arrows, and twangs the string.] \"For a civilization that builds fish with magic lasers, you'd think their small arms would be a bit more... explosive.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Never underestimate the power of a good old bow and... feather thing?\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"Any chance these are more effective than our peashooters?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"Considering what we know about the creators, and their technology and the fact that the bows are glowing, it's probably safe to assume they're magic.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"So magic bows with feather arrows are going to be more effective than light machine guns and RPGs against these things? That sounds ridiculous.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"Only one way to know. Use on the ugly horsemen.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"We're not seriously considering this are we? This isn't what we do.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Desperate situations call for improvisation Wong. Not the first time we've gone unconventional. Grab a bow.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"Right. On another note, what was up with those wart covered monstrosities? Have those been classified?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"They're Trows.\"\n\n**R-3:** \"Drows?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"No, Trows. They're a type of fairy, mean and unfriendly. Shouldn't get close to them.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"Yeah well, that's easier said than done.\"\n\n[R-6 removes the cube from its slot, resulting in a burst of light as a map of the interior of SCP-4700-1 projects into the air. The rest of the party has equipped themselves with the oddly glowing bows.]\n\n**R-6:** \"Jackpot.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"That what I think it is, Sheffield?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"If you're thinking a floor by floor blueprint, then yes.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Good, tell us where we need to go.\"\n\n**R-6:** \"We're here currently...\" [R-6 Points to a green blinking triangle in the layout. A large red cylinder is visible in the diagram.] \"The breach is here. Readings say all the stairways are blocked, and the elevator is out.\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"What options does that leave us?\" \n\n**R-6:** \"We'll have to cros-\"\n\n[R-6 is interrupted by a droplet of blood falling onto his face. The party takes several seconds to process before all camera's point towards the ceiling. The remains of 5 Finnfolk, previously unobserved, are suspended vertically from the ceiling by amorphous layers of flesh.]\n\n[Slowly tearing flesh is audible, and a sudden snap as one of the corpses detaches from the ceiling and slams into the table which previously held the cube. The table lights up, and previously unobserved speakers slide into place along the walls and begin playing a series of loud rhythmic electronic tones with large amounts of bass accompanied by a range of instruments not matching any in Foundation records.]\n\n[R-6 turns around and begins pressing indentations on the surface of the table until the music ceases. Everyone moves to the door, R-5 sticks his head out into the hallway. No entities are visible.]\n\n**R-5:** \"Think they heard that?\"\n\n[Numerous SCP-3456 vocalizations emanate from different areas of the vehicle.]\n\n**R-2:** \"You had to ask.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"We gotta move now. Sheffield, which way.\" \n\n**R-6:** \"Middle Hallway!\"\n\n[All 6 members of recon team sprint towards the middle hallway, and follow it.]\n\n[R-5 briefly looks back, catching the silhouette of an SCP-3456 instance behind them. They pass through a large doorway into what at first appears to be a large open chamber. It becomes apparent this is not the case, it is instead the breach in the vehicle's side. The expedition is near the top of the breach, narrow support beams cross the gap in front of them. A membrane of thick luminescent fluid prevents ocean water from flowing inwards. On the far end of the beach, 15 m down is the shattered end of a diamond tube, from which a plasma-like substance flows into the air. R-6 turns and sees a panel on the doorframe. He attempts to get it to turn on.]\n\n**R-6:** \"No good can't get it to turn on.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Better figure out something fast, they're going to be on us.\"\n\n[A high-pitched vocalization is heard.]\n\n**R-2:** \"And they sound pissed.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"Let me.\" \n\n[R-4 steps forward and smashes the glass screen of the panel, using a crowbar pry open the device. She looks through the components, and reaches in and pulls out a tiny sphere. The door slams closed.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Gonna have to cross the gap using the support beams. One by one.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"Does not look stable. May collapse.\" \n\n**R-3:** \"We don't have much choice in the matter.\"\n\n[The door behind them dents with a metallic bang.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Sheffield first, then Ochev, Wong, Balet, Jane. I'll go last.\" \n\n[R-6 makes his way onto the beams at a slow but careful pace. The door dents further.] \n\n**R-2:** \"We're gonna have to speed things up, there's no way we'll all be across when they come through.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Rest of you on the beams, slow and careful, Jane and I will cover you.\"\n\n[R-3, R-4, and R-5 move onto the support beams as R-6 reaches the halfway point.

Additional entities arrive as R-6 successfully steps onto the other side of the gap, helping the remaining members of the party depart the beams.]\n\n[The blue luminescence previously illuminating the breach shifts in color to a dark red. The party does not notice. Several of the humanoids begin attempting to cross the breach as R-Cap and R-2 reach the halfway point.

All hostile entities in the area look out the liquid membrane into the ocean water. Numerous ominous lights are visibly approaching. R-Cap and R-2 reach the other side with the humanoids still near the middle.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"What on earth?\"\n\n[20 automated drones[[footnote]]All resembling hammerhead sharks with carved channels emitting red luminescent light, forming ornate iconography.[[/footnote]] fly through the membrane of the breach.

For several seconds they are alone, walking through various terrains as the lights shift. Then, an increasing number of Finnfolk are around them. Thousands of lights depict the Finnfolk building, growing, and feeding a great machine.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"From the ashes of our home's destruction, a daughter came forth. The last Matriarch's daughter, Triemedes, set forth under the Orcadian sky, and took visit, one by one, with the scattered tribes, bringing them together through five brutal trials. She swore upon herself a sacred vow, to seal away the terrible tyrant... and in return, was rewarded with great knowledge of a powerful machine, Guð-Bani.\"\n\n[SCP-4700-1 is shown completed, rising from the ground. An enormous column of light fills the room, emanating from its primary weapon. The lights shift once more, to an island of fire and ice. Triemedes is there, with the Finnfolk. Then humans. Then men made from cogs. Then men made of indiscriminate flesh. Then men made from plants. The lights shift once more, to what is now the Ring of Brodgar.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"In the fires of Garðar a last desperate alliance was forged between Finn, Man, Machine, Flesh, and Plant. Triemedes led all to the homelands cloudy skys and barren hills, and there we waited.\"\n\n[The next several minutes of footage depict SCP-4700-1 rising from a lake and engaging the large humanoid seen in I-SCP-3703-01, as the combined groups of humanoids are assaulted by varying anomalies. A large humanoid approaches and is hit by SCP-4700-1's primary weapon. A second large humanoid, with four yellow eyes leaps from the lake and strikes the first with a massive sword, impaling it. The lights fade to depictions of hundreds of monolithic structures.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"On the shores of yee old Orkney, the tyrant was struck down, and so began the first of the great sealing wars, wherein we trapped those ancient evil things in rock and stone.\"\n\n[The lights fade from the room, followed by 30 seconds of silence. Ragnhild begins to cackle.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"That's the legend my mother gave me when I was a wee little girl. You humans lost so much of your own history, and we just burnt the oldest of ours, so who knows if its true.\" [Five seconds of cackling.]\n\n**R-6:** \"Why did you not stay in Orkney, or other parts of the world?\"\n\n[A brief change in expression.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"Humans drove us into the sea. It seems that even alliances can crumble.\"\n\n**R-6:** \"...and the person with four yellow eyes. You didn't speak about her.\"\n\n[Two minutes of silence, the Finnfolk look between one another. Ragnhild's cackling ceases. She begins to speak, but is interrupted by A Finnfolk rushing into the tent.]\n\n**Finnfolk Nomad:** \"{Matriarch, the city is in flames! Knoggelevi everywhere!}\"\n\n[Tent erupts into various Finnfolk speaking at, and over each other. Members of Recon remain seated. This continues for three minutes. Ragnhild bangs her cane on the floor. She is no longer smiling or cackling.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"{Silence! Grindwald, speak, and quickly.}\"\n\n**Grindwald:** \"{The city is overrun and aflame, Knoggelevi and Trows are in the streets.}\"\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"{And survivors?}\" \n\n**Grindwald:** \"{At the palace... many already taken.}\"\n\n[Ragnhild is quiet for five minutes before looking back to the Recon team members.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"You lied before when you said you were just explorers. State your true purpose.\"\n\n[R-6 looks to R-Cap, he hesitantly nods.]\n\n**R-6:** \"We're with an international organization that contains and protects mankind against... anomalies.\"\n\n[30 seconds of silence.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"You do as we once did... you know of the Knoggelevi?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"We've had our fair share of encounters.\"\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"Then you know of their terror.\" [Five-second pause.] \"We do not have the numbers to take back the homes of our brothers and sisters if what Grindwald said is true. Grindwald, take your brothers, go cross every river, every lake and great sea. Rouse those who remember the old ways.\" \n\n[Grindwald and several male Finnfolk leave the tent.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"Human... we find ourselves once more in desperation, turning to your blood-stained hands for aid. Will your organization provide aid?\"\n\n[Five seconds of silent hesitation.]\n\n**R-6:** \"I can't promise command will jump at it... but we will try to make it happen.\"\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"Mither help us if it doesn't.\"\n\n**End Log**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: #F2F2F2;\" \"float: center; border: solid 3px #666666; width: 100%; padding: 2px 10px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[div style=\"background-color:#990036\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"color:white\"]]**{{Recovered Materials D}}**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n{{**Excerpt Type:** Newspaper Headline}}\n\n{{**Date:** 4899 YSSS (1899)}}\n\n{{**Title:** GROWING UNREST AMID POLICY CHANGES BY KING SKREYJA IN THE HOME GUARD AND AMONG FORMER MAGISTERS.}}\n\n-----\n\n{{**Excerpt Type:** Personal Journal Commanding officer of Guð-Bani}}\n\n{{**Date:** 4900 YSSS (1900 AD)}}\n\n> He's done what we all feared the moment we heard of Hege's death in the blazes. \n> \n> Purges. \n> \n> The rat wolf bastard announced it a few weeks ago with no warning.

The following log contains transcripts depicting large scale combat operations. Material within is under level 5 restriction. Unauthorized access is grounds for termination.\n\n----\n\n**Begin Log**\n\n[Recon team breaches the surface of a single water highway into the Urban environment of cylinder three using submersibles. They are accompanied by several dozen Finnfolk operated SCP-3706 craft.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Alright listen up folks. This ain't our run of the mill mission. This is a war zone. Stealth, asset collection, document analysis, there will be none of that. Don't stop, keep your eyes in front of you, let the Finnfolk and the CTFs handle hostiles. We won't be dealing with the small things here. This is an open environment. Expect full scale 3456 instances. Any questions?\"\n\n**R-5:** \"What if one gets in our path?\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"We make it a pincushion.\" \n\n**R-2:** \"And If we can't?\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"We run.\"\n\n[The hatch for the submersible pops open, and the team, one by one, exits onto a tiled path. In all directions is a large urban environment of combined Greco-Roman, Japanese, and Arabic architecture. Skyscrapers are visible in the distance. Rubble and dark liquid is visible in the luminescent lined canals. A collapsed building blocks the street to the immediate right. Smoke obscures most of the sky.]\n\n[Several squads of Finnfolk exit larger SCP-3706 instances. CTF Elements exit submersibles to the right of recon team. Hundreds of voices acknowledge operations command via radio transmission.]\n\n**Operations Command:** \"This is Operations command to all assets. You are a go.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Lets move!\"\n\n[Recon and the accompanying escorts begin moving into the city. SCP-3456 vocalizations begin in all directions. CTF elements and Finnfolk break off from the grouping, and engage several groupings of humanoids, and smaller SCP-3456 instances. Recon team, and a single squad of Finnfolk[[footnote]] Containing members of the tribe which previously captured the recon team.[[/footnote]] advance further into the ruined city, as a single, severed, large limb lands to the right of the team.]\n\n**CTF-Omega Leader:**  \"This is CTF-Omega to all units. Air Support is inbound. ETA one minute.\"\n\n**R-3:** \"Air support? How the hell are they moving air units in here?\"\n\n**R-2:** \"It's better not to question, and just be fucking glad they are.\"\n\n[Recon comes to a stop as a single, 30 m tall SCP-3456 trots into the path in front of them. Hundreds of Finnfolk corpses are scattered on the street at its feet. It notices the team and turns, emitting a single vocalization and begins moving towards them.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"OPEN FIRE!\"\n\n[The Finnfolk and Recon team begin firing the feather arrows at the equine entity. It halts its advance, rearing up on two legs. The entity makes emits a distressed vocalization as the hoofs contact the ground,  knocking R-3 and R-4 off their feet. The 3456 instance begins to swell. It explodes, sending internal components and limbs flying in all directions.]\n\n**R-5:** \"Ah goddammit, that's disgusting.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"We can take showers when we get home.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Lets m-\" \n\n[R-Cap is cut off by one of the Finnfolk holding out an arm to prevent passage.]\n\n**Grinwald:** \"Not done.\"\n\n[The entities remnants begin to undulate, and coalesce, congealing together into 20 smaller SCP-3456 instances.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Jesus fuck, how can they do that!\"\n\n[Three Additional 30 m SCP-3456 instances come into frame, accompanied by a large number of the previously observed humanoids.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Fuck, time to run!\"\n\n[2 additional SCP-3456 and accompanying humanoids block the path behind.]\n\n**R-6:** \"We're boxed in.\" \n\n**Grinwald:** \"{Only one thing to do now Brynhild.}\"\n\n**Brynhild:** \"{We live by the Mither, and we die by the Mither. So be it.}\"\n\n[The Finnfolk form a protective circle around the Recon team, holding three-pronged tridents extended.]\n\n**Brynhild:** \"Ragnhild requested we protect you. We honor that request with our lives. Shoot, and we shall stab.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"That's... actually very noble.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"On 3 we open fire. Take as many with us as possible.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Heh, of all the days to die, it's on your birthday.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"That was a lie. My birthday's in September, Jane.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Dammit Silus, we can't die after that. I have to yell at you now.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Tell that to them. On 3 we start shooting, and we don't stop. Everyone got it?\"\n\n[All parties acknowledge. The crowd of hostile entities advance, charging the group.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"One\"\n\n[A dull humming begins in the distance. The entities continue charging.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Two.\"\n\n[The humming gets louder, the majority of the humanoids and equine entities do not stop their advance, the larger SCP-3456 instances pause to look to the source of the humming.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Three!\"\n\n[Recon team opens fire as the crowd begins sprinting towards the group, 6 arrows streak through lines of humanoids impaling themselves on 3456 instances, which catch fire and explode. The crowd continues to advance.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"What the...\"\n\n[78 SCP-3706 instances manned by CTF-Delta 7 pilots approach at high velocity. The vehicles dive less than 80 meters away and open fire upon both groupings of hostile entities, instantly vaporizing the 30 m tall equines, and strafing the crowd of hostiles.]\n\n**CTF-Omega-Leader:** \"Air support has arrived.\"\n\n[The crowd reaches the circular formation. Right before contact, the Finnfolk's tridents emit an eerie luminescence, which erupts into streaks of electric energy upon contact, vaporizing both humanoids and SCP-3456 instances. Brynhild wields both a trident and a heavy net, which she uses to trap a humanoid, before spinning the net in a circle and using her momentum to release the mechanism, sending the trapped humanoid back into the crowd with some force.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Oh fuck yes! Flying magic fish, that's what I call fucking air support.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Don't stop shooting til' they are all dead, we've got a date with that palace.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"I got a date with yelling at your ass for lying about that birthday.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Save it for when I buy you drinks after this is all said and done.\"\n\n[The CTF Squadron make a second pass, picking off a large number of additional hostiles, while Recon and the Finnfolk continue to repel the advancing assault. One of the Finnfolk falls to a smaller SCP-3456 instance, allowing a few hostiles to breach the circle, charging at R-6. R-2 steps in front of R-6 and manually stabs the hostiles with several of the feather arrows. Grinwald quickly plugs the hole, demonstrating visible grief at the loss.]\n\n**R-6:** \"...I think I just saw my life flash before my eyes.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"As long as you didn't shit your pants, you're fine.\"\n\n[The CTF squadron makes their third pass, as the ranks of hostiles finally break, and begin to flee in 3 separate groups. Air support gives chase, leaving Recon to proceed, over the next 15 minutes to run towards the palace complex. No further hostile entities are encountered, due to CTF air support. Their arrival is greeted by thousands of Finnfolk who took shelter behind the Palace defenses. MTF elements begin arriving. Over the next half hour evacuations aboard larger SCP-3706 transports are arranged. 15,000 individuals are estimated to be in the palace complex.]\n\n[CTF elements begin combing the palace for additional survivors. At this time, they discover hidden dungeon complexes, containing what are believed to have been high ranking political opponents of the previous regime. Recon team awaits further orders at a large temple complex.]\n\n**R-6:** \"Has uh... has anyone else noticed the person-sized pile of sand by that giant statue?\"\n\n**Royal Guard:** \"That is Skreyja. Or what is left.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"What on earth happened to him?\"\n\n**Brynhild:** \"Its his [[[SCP-3702|punishment]]] for his sins.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"Is he... still conscious? Cause that sounds pretty awful.\"\n\n**Brynhild:** \"No, he is in hell.\"\n\n[Further conversation is interrupted by the emergence of roughly 50-60 additional Finnfolk who are guided into the surrounding crowd awaiting evacuation. The last individual to emerge is an emaciated Finnwoman with golden scales and hair. She is supported by two MTF agents. She stops at the edge of the stairs.]\n\n[The individual turns and looks back, for five seconds, and then turns to face the crowd. Several Finnfolk in the crowd look in her direction. Like a wave, more and more Finnfolk turn to look at the Finnwoman. They begin to bow, as several members of the royal guard move to stand around her.]\n\n**Grinwald:** \"{Princess Hege lives.}\"\n\n**Brynhild:** \"{Queen Hege. Long may she live.}\"\n\n**R-6:** \"Cap... that's... uh... that's their Queen.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"That would explain the bowing. You said she was dead?\"\n\n**R-6:** \"I guess not.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Operations command this is Recon Captain. We have discovered and freed the Finnfolk's Queen. I repeat, high priority asset has been rescued.\"\n\n**Operations Command:** \"Roger R-Cap... your priority is to escort them out alive.\"\n\n**Operations Command:** \"We have a new directive coming from CTF Command.\"\n\n**CTF-Omega Leader:** \"Recon, this is CTF-Omega Leader. We have a big, angry problem.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Of course we do, just look out at the city. It's all a big angry problem.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Roger command, we're reading.\" [To R-2] \"Jane, cut the sarcasm to command. Save the banter for the field.\"\n\n**CTF-Omega Leader:** \"We've got a large, hostile entity, capable of flight, and directed thaumotologic breath sitting on the 3703 instance at the center of that big hollow space above you. I've already lost 2 whole squads trying to take it out. It's attempting to breach the containment field.\"\n\n**R-3:** \"What did he just describe? And what happens if it breaches the chamber?\"\n\n**Hege:** [Quietly.] \"The cylinders stop spinning.\"\n\n**R-4:** \"That would be bad. Very bad.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"I appreciate your situation Omega Leader, but we can't exactly sprout wings and fly. What do you want us to do about that?\"\n\n**Royal Guard:** \"Pardon, but there are fish in the hangar.\" \n\n**R-2:** \"If this were any other day, that would be nonsensical.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Can they fly?\"\n\n**Royal Guard:** \"Yes.\" \n\n**R-Cap:** \"Then let's go.\"\n\n**Hege:** \"I'm going.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"That's a no go Madame. You're these folks' last hope, and I am most certainly not risking you dying.\"\n\n**Hege:** \"These are my people, and this my home. I would rather die doing what I can than sit helplessly on the sidelines.\"\n\n[Further debate is cut short by a sudden intense tremor.]\n\n**R-2:** \"I don't think we have time to debate this, and she ain't backing down.\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Fine, she rides with me. Everyone else, grab your own fish.\"\n\n[They proceed to the hangar and are directed on how to use the fish by their Finnfolk escorts. The group takes off and heads up into the sky, where they are joined by a squad of Finnfolk nomads including Ragnhild.]\n\n**Brynhild:** \"{Grandmother what are you doing? You should not be here!}\"\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"You don't expect an old girl like me to lay down and die without a fight.\" [Cackling.] \"Let's go cook a fish! Yeeeeehawwww. Oh, hi Hege. Knew you weren't dead. Too much of a fighter.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"She really is mad.\"\n\n**R-5:** \"I'm just glad she's on our side.\"\n\n[The group breaches the clouds, and fly into a vast hollow space, heading towards diamond encased 3703 instances at high velocity. As they approach, the aforementioned hostile entity becomes visible. It is 50 m long, covered in thick scales, with two legs ending in claws, a head with a long snout and horns, two large wings, and a long tail with a spade shape at the end.]\n\n**R-3:** \"DRAGON!\"\n\n**R-6:** \"Actually, it's a Wyvern.\"\n\n**R-2:** \"Well it's about to be dead, so it doesn't matter either way.\"\n\n[The 3706 instances fly towards the entity, which notes their approach. It emits a hostile vocalization and opens its mouth. Large ice fragments begin manifesting in the air, and launch at the group.]\n\n**R-Cap:** \"Evasive maneuvers!\"\n\n[The group scatters, avoiding the Ice fragments, only to be met by bolts of electric thaumotology, forcing them into spins, and dives to avoid being hit. Ragnhild begins cackling, as she remains in place, the thaumotologic energy glancing off an invisible bubble around her. The clouds beneath the elderly Finnfolk begin swirling, and rise through the air as she chants in Proto-Nordic.]\n\n[The Wyvern continues to slam its tail into the diamond casing surrounding the SCP-3703 instance. Ragnhild starts to move and sway on her vehicle, the clouds encircling her sparking, before transmuting into green thaumotologic fire. The fire streaks out at the Wyvern, hitting it but causing no physical damage.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** [Cackling] \"You're going to be a plump roast for my grandchildren you fat lizard!\"\n\n[Recon and the Finnfolk begin diving their SCP-3706 instances in erratic patterns, striking the entity. They manage to punch holes in its flesh. It roars in distress.]\n\n**R-2:** \"That's what I'm talking about! Eat magic fish lasers!\"\n\n[The Wyverns flesh begins regenerating.]\n\n**R-3:** \"Well that's not fucking good!\"\n\n[The Wyvern swings its tail away from the SCP-3703 instance, causing the group to scatter again, while making impact and instantly killing one of the Finnfolk. The holes inflicted by the Recon team heal completely, and begin to bulge. Dozens of small, faster-flying entities identical to the Wyvern burst from each inflicted hole, and begin harassing Recon team.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Holy fuck, kill the small ones!\"\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"Stolwold! You scale covered, foul-smelling, wolf frolicking lizard. I will send you back to the abyss from whence you came! Then I'll make cookies and eat them over your fried corpse!\"\n\n[Ragnhild cackles, and directs all of the fire enveloping her to incinerate many of the smaller Wyverns, before directing it at the larger instance. Scales on the entity crack and burn off, but quickly regenerate, releasing more of the small instances.]\n\n**R-6:** \"We're not doing anything!\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"We have to hit it all at once. Everyone, dive on me!\"\n\n**R-2:** \"That's kind of hard when we're being swarmed!\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"All in on me, blast the small ones as a group.\"\n\n[Recon and the Finnfolk gather into a wedge formation and clear out the smaller Wyverns. Several are able to land scratches, deep cuts, and bites, and another Finnfolk goes down as two clog up the vehicle's engines. R-Cap dives into the entity, followed by the remaining members of the party. They open fire on it, striking it repeatedly. The Wyvern roars in distress.]\n\n**R-5:** \"Fuck yeah, its swiss cheese now!\"\n\n**R-2:** \"I don't think it's enough, it's already starting to regenerate... look out, here come more of the small ones!\"\n\n[Large holes in the Wyvern's form begin to regenerate, unleashing hundreds of the smaller entities, as it flings Ice fragments, and bolts of lightning at the party. Two more Finnfolk are struck, and perish in the explosion of their vehicles.]\n\n**Ragnhild:** \"You rat bastard!\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"No good, we don't have the firepower to take this thing down, and we're taking casualties.\"\n\n[The Wyvern slams its tail into the diamond, causing it to crack.]\n\n**R-6:** \"We don't have time to call for help, it's going to breach any second!\"\n\n**R-2:** \"We need a bigger gun!\"\n\n**Hege:** \"{Only a titan of the deep may bring ruin to the great Wyrms of Stoor, for the mightiest of fish may only unleash pestilence upon the earth... Mither help us.}\"\n\n[A humming fills the air immediately below the recon team members as they dodge the cloud of smaller entities. From the cloud a beam of light emerges, accompanied by a mechanical roar. A large mechanical form emerges, as the beam of light severs the Wyverns tail with a loud concussive blast. It does not regenerate.]\n\n**R-2:** \"Fuck. Yes. It's about time we got bigger toys.\"\n\n**R-6:** \"We gotta weaken and sever the limbs!\"\n\n**R-Cap:** \"All in folks! Lets go!\"\n\n[Recon team and the surviving Finnfolk dive onto the entity, and open fire, punching holes. They manage to sever its wings, preventing it from escaping. The large mechanical shape comes into view, an SCP-3706 instance in the shape of a cuttlefish. Its primary weapon fires again, as smaller emplacements vaporize the cloud of smaller Wyverns. The Wyvern, with no escape route, takes the blast head on and is instantly vaporized.]\n\n**CTF-Command:** \"This is CTF command to all units. Wyvern neutralized.\"\n\n**End Log**\n\n**Epilogue:** Following neutralization of what is now being designated SCP-████, evacuations were completed. 55,973 Finnfolk were successfully evacuated from the SCP-4700-1-B into SCP-4700-1-A and surrounding surface vessels. All three cylinders were cleared of hostile entities 15 days post discovery. Negotiations began in earnest, and the Finnfolk-Foundation cooperative agreement was signed on April 16th, 2017.

It is unable to fully maintain either state.]\n\n**Engineering:** \"No good, we're still having trouble syncing all the generators.\"\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"We have movement and some weapons, good enough for a shakedown run.\"\n\n[SCP-4700-01 is directed in slow circles for the next five minutes.]\n\n**Sensors Officer:** \"Large sonar contact, bearing three o'clock, depth 6.5 km.\" \n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Bring us around, and put it up on the viewscreen.\"\n\n**Princess Hege:** {Mither almighty, the Great Wyrm of Stoor.}\n\n[SCP-3700-02 comes into frame, having manifested as consistent with prior observations. It turns, and notices SCP-4700-1, and begins swimming towards the vehicle.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Hostile inbound, launch all support craft. Fire all weapons, and get that primary cannon online! Bring us around to three o'clock of its bearing, and prepare for evasive maneuvers.\"\n\n[SCP-3706 instances begin launching from SCP-4700-1's carrier bays. Weapon emplacements along the vehicle's hull fire several barrages. Beams of light, and fauna shaped guided torpedos fly through the ocean water and impact SCP-3700-02, knocking it slightly off course. It vocalizes in distress.]\n\n**Sensors Officer:** \"Brace for impact!\"\n\n[SCP-3700-02 collides with the vehicle, toppling it onto its side, before the entity continues swimming, impacting the ocean floor. SCP-4700-1 rights itself, having sustained a large dent in its exterior armor. Weapon emplacements resume firing at the downed entity as it rises from the ocean floor and turns to engage at closer range.]\n\n[Supporting SCP-3706 instances begin firing on the entity. It swings its sharpened tail, but is too slow to catch the smaller vehicles.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"What's the status on our primary weapon?\"\n\n**Weapons Officer:** \"Still no response, we can get it to charge, but not to full power.\"\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"How much?\"\n\n**Weapons Officer:** \"30%. There's another problem. The circuits aren't completely repaired. We fire more than two, maybe three shots, we risk blowing the entire vehicle to hell.\"\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"We'll have to hope that's enough.\"\n\n[Four SCP-3706 cuttlefish-shaped capital ships approach the 32 km long entity as it prepares to assault the vehicle. They open fire with their primary weapons, striking the entity as it begins breathing characteristic fire from its mouth. The resulting blasts manage to sever three of its tentacles, causing a distressed vocalization as it emits fire directly above and back onto itself, resulting in additional physical damage. SCP-4700-1 turns and aligns its primary weapon with the entity.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Fire primary weapon!\"\n\n[A low humming fills the vehicle's bridge, and the surrounding water as smaller vehicles move out of the way. The barrel of SCP-4700-1's primary weapon begins to glow, and water surrounding it begins to boil. The vehicle emits a mechanical roar, and an enormous column of light flies forth, pushing the entire vehicle backward, as the beam impacts the ocean floor. All recording devices are obscured by five seconds of bright light. Water rushes to fill the sudden empty space caused by the blast, an immense crater left in the ocean floor.]\n\n[SCP-3700-02 manages to avoid the first shot at the last second but receives heavy physical damage from the impacting blast. It sideswipes the SCP-3706 capital ships as they are temporarily blinded by the blast, sending them sinking into the seabed. The entity then proceeds to swim at SCP-4700-01 once more.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Dammit we missed! How long till next charge?\"\n\n**Weapons Officer:** \"30 Seconds!\"\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Don't have that long! Activate the claws.\"\n\n[SCP-4700-01 raises its claws, electrostatic discharge devices activating, as serrated edges move to the interior surface. The vehicle scuttles slightly to one side, avoiding SCP-3700-02's charging advance, and uses both claws to grasp its tail. One claw cleaves the spiked tail, preventing its further use, while the other maintains a grip on the entity. SCP-4700-1 raises its claw arm, and turns, before bringing it down, slamming SCP-3700-02 into the sand as it discharges its electric potential.]\n\n[The entity emits another distressed vocalization and manages to slip free of SCP-4700-01's claw. Despite severe physical damage to its body, SCP-3700-02 manages to wrap its body around the vehicle and proceeds to lock its jaw onto SCP-4700-1's outer armor. It begins to constrict, in an attempt to crush the vehicle in its entirety.]\n\n[The vehicle attempts to grab the entity with its claws, but the limited motions of its front appendages prevent it from reaching back. Supporting SCP-3706 instances attempt to sever portions of its body using focused assaults, but are beaten back by both tentacles and SCP-3700-02 emitting streams of blockading fire. Weapon emplacements are unable to fire at the entity without damaging the vehicle further.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Weapons status!\"\n\n**Weapons Officer:** \"Fully charged, but we can't get it off!\"\n\n[SCP-3700-02 constricts tighter, causing several hull breaches which are quickly sealed.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Dammit all.\"\n\n[SCP-4700-01 attempts to move and shake the enraptured entity from its form for several seconds before it is pulled to the sand by SCP-3700-02.]\n\n[A large humanoid hand emerges from the seabed and grasps SCP-3700-02 by its tail, and pulls it from SCP-4700-1. The arm begins slamming it into the seabed, stunning it, before holding it up. It curls and bites into the Humanoid arm, causing an enormous tremor across the ocean floor. SCP-4700-1 rights itself once more, and turns to align its primary weapon with the arm and entity.]\n\n**NTF-Delta 7 Commanding Officer:** \"Open fire!\"\n\n[SCP-4700-1 charges and fires its second shot. It impacts SCP-3700-02 barely avoiding the humanoid arm, and incinerating the entity instantly]\n\n[A humanoid figure, covered in pink, yellow, green, and blue luminescent markings, and possessing four yellow eyes upon its otherwise human face emerges from the seabed. It stretches in an upward motion, nursing the arm which suffered indirect damage, before pausing and surveying the surrounding area. It spots SCP-4700-01. Leaning forward, it pats the vehicle's \"head\" before speaking briefly in Proto-Nordic. Surveying the surrounding area once more, it stands, and then dissolves into large quantities of kelp, which fall to the ocean floor.]\n\n**Sensors Officer:** \"Sonar Contacts! Thousands of them!\"\n\n[More than 9000 SCP-3706 instances are suddenly visible in all directions.]\n\n**End Log**\n\n----\n\n{{**Postword:** 9846 SCP-3706 instances containing more than 200,000 surviving Finnfolk were, according to numerous eyewitness reports, instantly transported to SCP-4700-1's location following the Humanoid entities departure. The humanoid entity has been designated EoI-001-00 as a result of these events.}}\n\n{{Transcription of EoI-001-00's speech:}}\n\n> I wake from my deep slumber to find you in ruins. Do not worry. Do not fret. I shall bring home those who were exiled. Do not worry. Do not panic. Teran wakens in the deeps. Do not worry. \n> \n> For I am woken, and my love is endless.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n« [[[SCP-4699]]] | SCP-4700 | [[[SCP-4701]]] »\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
