Personnel working in greenhouse are to be screened upon exit to prevent accidental dispersal of SCP-1147-1. Following test SCP-1147-DC all handling of SCP-1147-1 must be done with approved tools.\n\nTesting the safety and edibility of any specimen of SCP-1147-2 is restricted to D-Class personnel. --After 48 hours of observation specimens may be cleared for general consumption.--\n\nAll tests must be approved by Dr. Laurel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1147 is an unclassified species of plum tree whose seeds, designated SCP-1147-1, can be planted in practically any substance. The resulting plant will adopt physical attributes from the utilized substance. SCP-1147 has proven capable of growing in solids, loose material, and liquids via hydroponics. SCP-1147 produces fruit, designated SCP-1147-2.\n\nThe original specimen of SCP-1147 was discovered growing from the steel base of a lamp post in ████ ██████, Georgia, where it was believed to be an art installation by the local population.\n\n**SCP-1147 Control**\n**Substance:** Standard potting soil.\n**Result:** Normal plum tree closely matching similar species. Seeds retain anomalous properties.\n**Fruit:** Sweeter than expected.\n**Notes:** //To eliminate as many variables as possible, only seeds from SCP-1147 control should be used for new tests. -Dr. Laurel// \n\n**SCP-1147-ST**\n**Substance:** 20cm cube of galvanized steel. 5cm hole drilled into top, seed placed within, plugged with steel shavings.\n**Result:** Trunk is high quality steel with a superior tensile strength. Leaves and flowers are thin, rigid zinc sheets and give off no scent.\n**Fruit:** Inedible. D-182 cracked tooth in attempt. Subsequent taste tests denied for specimens that can't be cut with a knife.\n**Notes:** //This is the same material in which SCP-1147 was discovered. Original specimen successfully reproduced. -Dr. Laurel//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Mineral Test Log\" hide=\"Close Mineral Test Log\"]]\n**SCP-1147-SA**\n**Substance:** Sand collected from ocean beach.\n**Result:** Trunk rough, brittle, and pale. Crumbles easily to touch into individual grains of sand. Leaves and flowers are translucent and colorless. Scent resembles ocean breeze.

Inedible.\n**Notes:** //Personnel requests to give SCP-1147-GL as gifts denied. -Dr. Laurel//\n\n**SCP-1147-CO**\n**Substance:** Planter filled with poured concrete. Seed pressed 5cm under surface.\n**Result:** Trunk matches color, texture, and strength of concrete. Leaves are pliable. When soaked in water and applied to a surface they harden into a firm shell. Flowers share similar properties and have a chalky scent.\n**Fruit:** Inedible.\n**Notes:** //Leaves could be useful to quickly repair damaged walls/floors. Further research recommended. -Dr. Laurel//\n\n**SCP-1147-CH**\n**Substance:** Charcoal ground into rough powder.\n**Result:** Trunk dry and cracked, resembling a tree after a forest fire. Leaves black and crumble easily. Flowers smell like burnt wood. Recommend storing away from other specimens in case of accidental combustion.\n**Fruit:** Withered and smoky flavored. Produces a small quantity of liquid which is easily ignited.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Plantae Test Log\" hide=\"Close Plantae Test Log\"]]\n**SCP-1147-PA**\n**Substance:** Shredded white printer paper mixed with water into pulp.\n**Result:** Trunk composed of layered sheets of white paper that can be peeled away individually. Leaves are yellow with light blue veins. Flowers multicolored with the texture of tissue paper. Scent resembles a new book.\n**Fruit:** Edible, but largely flavorless. D-431 received minor cuts on lips/tongue.\n\n**SCP-1147-CT**\n**Substance:** Processed, compressed cotton stored in fabric sack.\n**Result:** Bark is a brown felt with a cotton core, giving in to pressure. Bark does not heal naturally, but can be stitched closed with no negative effects. Leaves are green felt with stitched veins. Flowers are pink cotton with the scent of freshly washed laundry.\n**Fruit:** Resembles a plush plum.

Surface smooth and polished with a visible grain.\n\n**SCP-1147-MO**\n**Substance:** $2,183 US in mixed bills, shredded and mixed with water to form pulp.\n**Result:** Similar structure to SCP-1147-PA, but trunk is a pale green in color. Leaves bear a random mix of symbols and images commonly found on currency, but do not resemble complete and passable bills. Flowers have the scent of fresh dollar bills.\n**Fruit:** A paper skin filled with dark ink. Sample of ink had a mild plum flavor.\n**Notes:** //I told you it wouldn't work. I'm glad I didn't chip in to the collection. -Dr. Laurel//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Liquid Test Log\" hide=\"Close Liquid Test Log\"]]\n**SCP-1147-WA**\n**Substance:** Filtered water.\n**Result:** Trunk is smooth, transparent and cool to the touch, resembling quartz.

Vulnerable to deformation at higher temperatures.\n**Fruit:** Edible, with a soft plum flavor, but no nutritional value. With wick inserted, fruit will burn for approximately 12 hours. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Animalia Test Log\" hide=\"Close Animalia Test Log\"]]\n**Note:** All specimens in this category raised in isolated underground testing chambers at Sector ██. Access restricted to Security Level 3.\n\n**SCP-1147-BL**\n**Substance:** 30 liters cow's blood.\n**Result:** Bark is flaky, with a dark color reminiscent of dried blood. Leaves are thin and translucent, featuring a web of red veins. Flowers are a dark crimson and emit a red mist once a day. Specimens should be tended and watered only by D-Class wearing environmental suits until the nature of Researcher Parker's illness can be determined. \n**Fruit:** Resembles a regular plum with a nearly black skin and dark red juices.

Cooked fruit more edible but taste described as \"gross\" and \"wrong.\"\n\n**SCP-1147-DC**\n**Substance:** Seed implanted under the forearm skin of restrained D-Class subject.\n**Result:** Growth resembled an additional limb, with roots entangled in the veins, nerves and bones of the arm. D-1052 reported no ill effects and responded to stimulus given to SCP-1147-DC. After surgical removal both specimen and D-1052 expired on the operating table, autopsy pending.\n**Fruit:** [REDACTED] All samples of SCP-1147-DC-1 and SCP-1147-DC-2 destroyed.\n**Notes:** //Further testing requires O5 level approval. -Dr. Laurel//\n\n**SCP-1147-BR**\n**Substance:** Complete human brain from D-1398.\n**Result:** Bark is pale and membranous, with dark veins visible beneath the surface. Specimen responds to harmful stimulus by shifting away at a rate of 1cm/min. Leaves laced with a dense web of veins and nerves. Flowers resemble primitive sensory organs, sensitivity tests ongoing.\n**Fruit:** Upon attempted removal of fruit [DATA EXPUNGED]. Agents ██████████ and █████ from MTF Theta-4 responded and specimen now under control and observation. Requesting all available records pertaining to D-1398.\n**Notes:** //Further testing requires O5-█ approval. Not that it'll do Researcher Paulsen any good. I accept full responsibility for not taking his suspicions more seriously. Dammit. I went into botany to avoid this sort of thing. -Dr. Laurel//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1146]]] | SCP-1147 | [[[SCP-1148]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
