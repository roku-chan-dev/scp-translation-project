This examination is being performed with the objective of obtaining information pertinent to the understanding and repair of Item #234 (the core component of SDI-██ System \"Xye\").  \"R\" and \"N\" are mechanical engineers with a background in space exploration.  \"E\" and \"A\" are agents overseeing the procedure.\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **R:** There's no conduit from these panels...are they just for show?\n> \n> **E:** Most likely, we are not sure as of yet what it is powered by.\n> \n> **N:** Opening superior side access point.\n> \n> //A metallic sound is heard, accompanied by a grunt from \"N\".//\n> \n> **N:** What in all—?\n> \n> **R:** What—is that //blood//?\n> \n> **N:** No, blood is brighter-colored and more opaque, and—\n> \n> //A sharp inhalation is heard.//\n> \n> **N:** It smells like iron, this doesn't.\n> \n> **A:** What does it smell like?\n> \n> **N:** I have no idea.  R, here, take a sample to the lab.\n> \n> **R:** Roger.\n> \n> //\"R\" is heard leaving the room.//\n> \n> **N:** Continuing with the examination.\n> \n> //Wet, rustling sounds are heard.//\n> \n> **N:** Components 23, 24, 27...missing.  Unsurprising, all the solar conversion components are gone.  There's a lot of wiring, much more than there should be.  Looks like fiber-optics, all pale gray, tightly-bundled.  Wait a moment...there's no charge, it's certainly not electrical...It's unusually warm in here.\n> \n> **E:** Internal temperature?\n> \n> **N:** ...37 degrees Centigrade.\n> \n> **A:** What's that in—\n> \n> **N:** 98 degrees.\n> \n> **A:** ...Odd.\n> \n> **N:** That //is// odd.  There's really an enormous amount of wiring in here, and I barely see any of the original components—wait a moment.\n> \n> **E:** What?\n> \n> **N:** I found...something, it's not a component I recognize but-Jesus, what is this—\n> \n> //The sounds of rummaging can be heard.//\n> \n> **N:** It's an irregularly-shaped container, I'm not sure what it's made of, but it's not metallic...the wiring seems to congregate on this object.\n> \n> **A:** How big?\n> \n> **N:** Maybe 25cm across at the widest, 15cm at the thinnest...it's fairly light.\n> \n> **A:** What—\n> \n> **N:** It's warm.\n> \n> **A:** Same temperature?\n> \n> **N:** Warm...\n> \n> **A:** N?\n> \n> **E:** N, are you okay?\n> \n> **N:** Are you warm enough?\n> \n> **E:** N, what—\n> \n> **N:** Sleep now...warm and cozy...\n> \n> **A:** Fuck.\n> \n> **E:** Get him out of there.  Now!  Get him out now—open!\n> \n> //Loud thrashing is heard, \"N\" appears to be crying or laughing, it is unclear.//\n> \n> **A:** Oh God—\n> \n> **E:** Get them out of him—\n> \n> **A:** They're getting longer—\n> \n> **E:** That's not fiber-optics—\n> \n> **N:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> \n> **E:** Who is he talking about?!\n> \n> **A:** //Cut the wires!//\n>  \n> <End Log>\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
