In the event of a positive identification, the contaminated record is to be temporarily sealed and monitored until the phenomenon abates.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6088 is a phenomenon in which written records pertaining to NASA's Voyager program are spontaneously altered to include reference to a fictitious //Herald// space probe. These alterations are relatively minor, consisting of at most a single paragraph, but details described are consistent across occurrences. Alterations caused by SCP-6088 are believed to persist only for a short amount of time -- the longest observed alteration lasting only six hours.\n\nAlterations caused by SCP-6088 most often consist of brief and macabre references to //Herald// as a counterpart to //Voyager//, usually replacing //Voyager 2// in descriptions. Even in cases where they are not outright replaced, mentions of //Voyager 2// are often excised during SCP-6088. No records to date have explicitly described the supposed purpose of //Herald//, and what information is provided does not give any wider context.\n\nMentions of a 'Black Accusation' -- a presumed counterpart to the Golden Record carried by //Voyager 1// and //2// -- are also included in a number of SCP-6088 alterations.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ Addendum 6088-1 (Alteration Log)\n[[/=]]\n\nThe following is a curated log of records altered by occurrences of SCP-6088.

Voyager. Herald. Voyager. Herald. Voyager. Herald. If we are ourselves blameless, then by what metric can we be forgiven?\"//\n> \n> **Source:** Note written below a report on probe integrity.\n> **Original Text:** //Not one-hundred percent on this -- further tests before next deadline, please!// \n> **Writer:** 'John Oscar Herald'.
