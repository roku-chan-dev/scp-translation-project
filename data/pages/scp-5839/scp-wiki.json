Individual documents may be viewed upon official request.\n\nSCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 are to be kept under observation of senior staff on site.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5839 refers to a phenomenon that the Foundation utilized between 1970 and 1975. It was an anomaly that allowed paperwork between SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 to shift temporally.\n\nSCP-5839-1 was a researcher assigned to Site-65, age 24, named Neil Schofield. It possessed the ability to send handwritten notes addressed to SCP-5839-2 five years into the future.\n\nSCP-5839-2 was an archivist on Archival Site-33, age 25, named Ella Hauser. It possessed the ability to send handwritten notes addressed to SCP-5839-1 five years back into the past.\n\nSCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 did not possess their abilities simultaneously. Instead, the ability to send notes to a different time period was transferred from SCP-5839-1 to SCP-5839-2 during the events of Addendum-2.\n\nSCP-5839 has been used by the Foundation for the following purposes;\n* Recovering damaged or lost documents.\n* Tracking and containment of undiscovered anomalies.\n* Preventing containment breaches and incidents.\n* Arresting agents of GoI's and finding other Persons of Interest.\n\n**Discovery:** The notes of SCP-5839-1 on [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5978 | SCP-5978]]] kept disappearing after being written. It was discovered that this was not a side effect of the studied anomaly. Before an internal audit and disciplinary action were carried out, a note appeared before senior staff where the notes of SCP-5839-1 were supposed to be.\n\n[[size 120%]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n08/05/1975\n@@ @@\nTo researcher Neil Schofield and his superiors,\n@@ @@\nI finally have obtained your notes regarding SCP-5978 that disappeared 5 years ago.

Would you like me to still follow up on this request?\n@@ @@\nElla Hauser\nArchivist on Site-33\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\nThe note was found to be dated 5 years into the future. Senior staff hypothesized that this note experienced an opposite effect of the note that disappeared.\n\n+ Addendum-1: Correspondence\nAfter several experiments with SCP-5839-1, another note was successfully sent into the future to request the assistance of SCP-5839-2 and the future Foundation.\n\nAfter two weeks of experimenting, the following conditions were identified;\n* Each note is to be handwritten by either SCP-5839-1 or SCP-5839-2.\n* Each note is to be addressed to the other party by name.\n* Notes need to be sent on a physical sheet of paper, they could not be sent in other formats[[footnote]]Trying to send cassette tapes or bundles of documents with an attached note only resulted in the note being sent.[[/footnote]].\n\nHowever, SCP-5839-1 showed high levels of stress when writing these notes. Upon questioning, SCP-5839-2 stated that it was not familiar with this effect.\n\nOn 04/06/1970, SCP-5839-1 was transferred to Site-33. After several days it became acquainted with the present version of SCP-5839-2 who did not yet possess any anomalous features. Over time the stress of SCP-5839-1 got better the more it seemed to trust SCP-5839-2.\n\nSCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 were encouraged to write each other to reduce the stress of SCP-5839-1. SCP-5839-1 also showed more interest in the present version of SCP-5839-2 because of this. Several examples are included below.\n[[size 120%]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n11/07/1970\n@@ @@\nTo Ella Hauser,\n@@ @@\nNothing out of the ordinary happened as of late.

Although the footage is blurry, SCP-5839-1 can be seen kneeling down and presenting some sort of box. After three days, it was discovered that they both had changed their marital status. SCP-5839-1 lost its anomalous characteristics whilst SCP-5839-2 gained them. It is hypothesized that the acceptance of the proposal is associated with the acceptance of the phenomenon SCP-5839-1 possessed. Shortly after this, several notes on SCP-5978 appeared on Site-65, and Site-33 was informed to open a new file in the archive.\n\nOn 29/04/1980, SCP-5839-1 and SCP-5839-2 celebrated their fifth anniversary and upon renewing their vows, lost all anomalous abilities. After this, both individuals agreed to be administered with Class C amnestics to remove classified information from their memory.\n\nSCP-5839 was subsequently reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5838]]] | SCP-5839 | [[[SCP-5840]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
