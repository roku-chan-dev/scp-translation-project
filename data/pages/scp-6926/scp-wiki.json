SCP-6926 always appears dressed in a manner somewhat resembling traditional depictions of Santa Claus, with additional articles of clothing worn in cold weather.\n\nAreas within a twenty-five mile radius of SCP-6926 experience the following phenomena:\n\n**Environmental:**\n* Decrease in local temperatures; enough to sustain the presence of ice and snow.\n* The appearance of partially drunk alcoholic beverages within local homes.\n\n**Phenomena displayed in humans:**\n* Increased fatigue and idleness. Often causing subjects to remain sleeping longer than usual.\n* The inability to keep track of time consistently throughout the day.\n* Severe headaches in subjects that drank alcohol the previous day, no matter how minimal the amount consumed.\n* Feelings of melancholy and regret (Reasons vary between subjects).\n\nAdditionally, SCP-6926 has displayed various anomalous abilities, including instant teleportation between locations, manipulation  and control of ice and snow, inducing alcoholic intoxication through physical contact, and the manifestation of holiday themed/related beverages (Eggnog, Irish-cream, Coca-Cola). SCP-6926 only uses these abilities to aid itself in its annual activities.\n\nSCP-6926 manifests annually on the 26th of December in countries that celebrate the holiday “Boxing Day”. During such times SCP-6926 will travel between locations that have hosted social gatherings the night prior, specifically those containing uneaten foodstuffs and beverages leftover from the night before. While there, SCP-6926 will take part in recreational activities such as drinking, eating, and general relaxation. SCP-6926 will de-manifest at 12:00am local time on December 27th.\n\n**Discovery Log:** Local phenomena resulting from SCP-6926’s anomalous properties were first detected in the village of ██████, England, on December 26th 1995. Due to the sudden drastic change in local weather, Foundation agents in the area were dispatched to investigate. SCP-6926 was discovered traveling between pubs in the area, joined by civilians partaking in a pub-crawl that had begun the previous night. Interviews with witnesses revealed SCP-6926 had become heavily intoxicated over the night, during which they made various references to a confidential event that took place on [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5925 | September 22nd the same year]]].\n\n**Interview Log:** The following is an improvised interview that was recorded following SCP-6926’s sudden manifestation at Site-17’s annual employee boxing day gathering in 1996.\n\n> //Foundation personnel can be heard talking to one another over the sound of music. The room goes silent and the music stops, as personnel notice the presence of SCP-6926. Loud crunching can be heard from SCP-6926. Researcher Agnew approaches.//\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** Wow. Um, excuse me? Who’re you?\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** Hi. What’s up? I’m Santa Claus.\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** Yeah… Um, what are you doing here?\n> \n> //SCP-6926 continues eating cookies//\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** Eating right now.\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** Right. Any particular reason you’re here though?\n> \n>//SCP-6926 continues eating//\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** Food. You want some?\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** No thanks. //Researcher Agnew gestures to personnel to alert security.//\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** So you’re Saint Nick then?\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** No. I’m Santa Claus. Well, not today at least. It’s my day off.\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** You don’t seem quite jolly enough to be Santa Claus.\n> \n> //SCP-6926 picks up a can of coke and notices that it is warm. Frost forms around the can and SCP-6926 smiles.//\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** I don’t care.\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** You know, it’s strange. When I was a kid, I didn’t believe in Santa.\n> \n> //SCP-6926 looks at researcher Agnew. SCP-6926 takes a sip of coke.//\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** You’re an idiot.\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** Any other business?\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** Probably finish off here. Go someplace else. You’re kinda bringing down the mood here buddy.\n> \n> //Security personnel enter the room and approach SCP-6926. Both restrain SCP-6926 and escort them into the hallway. Shortly afterwards, both security personnel begin to stupor and suddenly collapse onto the floor. SCP-6926 re-enters the room.//\n> \n> **Researcher Agnew:** Hey! What’re you-\n> \n> //SCP-6926 grabs a bottle of whisky from a nearby table.//\n> \n> **SCP-6926:** Haha. Lightweights.\n> \n> //SCP-6926 disappears//\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6925]]] | SCP-6926 | [[[SCP-6927]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
