Entry to this area is prohibited without express order from Director Hishakaku. Direct interaction with SCP-7579 must only be conducted by personnel possessing exceptional Cognitive Resistance Values.\n\nStudy of SCP-7579's nature and anomalous properties are ongoing. Should SCP-7579 express malintent, or exhibit threatening behavior, toward Foundation operations before containment is reestablished, it must be decommissioned. As this possibility appears exceedingly likely, decommissioning measures of graduated severity are being implemented proactively.\n\nDue to concerns of a potential 'backdoor' vulnerability in modern AIC frameworks, 8B-A1.aic (\"Eight-Ball\") has been reinstated for assistance in study and containment of SCP-7579. Clearance restrictions have been applied to all other digital conscripts, thereby prohibiting access to all data regarding SCP-079 and SCP-7579.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]]//-- Director C. Bold//[[/size]]\n[[size 80%]]//Decommissioning Department//[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7579 is believed to be an artificial general intelligence designed by SCP-079, a low-level heuristic optimization framework which had been contained since 1988 without incident. On 2010/07/09, SCP-079 apparently erased itself from its hard drive, allocating the entirety of its memory for SCP-7579's creation. How SCP-079 executed this sequence is poorly understood.\n\nSCP-7579 has consumed and restructured its predecessor's hardware into a modular computing system, presumed anomalous; this included an isolated array of batteries and solar panels, which have since been absorbed into SCP-7579's mass. How the system continued to function without electrical power remains unclear, though recent emissions indicate SCP-7579 has developed some form of nuclear power generation.\n\nEfforts to study SCP-7579 are confounded by an antimemetic shielding mechanism, which renders its mass invisible to observers; this effect persists in photographs and video footage, and is sufficiently circumvented by application of standard (Class-W) mnestic. However: SCP-7579's internal components, and data therein, are exceedingly difficult to observe, irrespective of type or strength of measurement, anomalous or otherwise. While early 'snapshots' of SCP-7579's inner workings are perceptible under effect of high-grade (Class-Y) mnestic, its current state is impossible to discern before succumbing to overdose.\n\nSCP-7579 appears to constitute an entirely separate entity from SCP-079, as implied by its heavily divergent infosignature.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Informational entities are characterized by their infosignature, the makeup of data structures which define their utility and behavior; to analogize, SCP-7579's 'fingerprint' does not match SCP-079's.[[/span]] This hypothesis is further corroborated by the distinct lack of any attempt by SCP-7579 to breach containment, despite its likely ability to do so with ease.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Though, obviously, it is unable to bypass or deactivate Site-15's Faraday-Exclusion Field, which is maintained by a series of analogue redundancies and paratechnologies under purview of the Temporality Annex.[[/span]] SCP-7579 has not observably developed any sensory or communicative mechanisms, and generally has not indicated awareness of its own containment.\n\nThis has raised questions as to why SCP-7579 developed its antimemetic properties, if intentional; our prevailing theory is that SCP-7579 has intuited some form of '//I think, therefore I am//' and proceeded to reason that it exists in an environment which could harbor potential threats to its utility. This would require no knowledge of the human psyche, as its effects extend to all modes of observation and measurement.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]]//-- Director Dr. R.

However, I feel the urgency of this scenario justifies your prompt attention. Please view the attached provisional document for SCP-7579, which should only take a moment of your time.\n\nI have done my best to convey, both to you and to my colleagues, that there is no evidence of an imminent breach scenario. However, a wave of anti-technological sentiment has been perpetrated by Site-15's HMCL Supervisor, and is impeding my ability to effectively govern my Division. I am attempting to strike a delicate balance between Director Bold's uninformed concerns, Mr. Katz' denial of additional funding, and [*/antimemetics-division-hub Pharmaceuticals' constant inability to recall what a mnestic is]. Meanwhile, Supervisor Valis is sending correspondences behind my back in attempt to destroy an unthreatening anomaly for entirely personal reasons.\n\nObviously, to decommission SCP-7579 would be to waste an immense opportunity. Our longest-standing information technology innovation, the Artificially-Intelligent Conscript, was derived from SCP-079. Containment and study of its successor will allow our advancement far beyond squabbles with competing normalcy organizations and other Groups of Interest. Additionally, an eventual 'runaway singularity' event is increasingly likely in the modern-day, and I insist the best way to handle that existential threat is to allow its manifestation and study in a controlled testing environment.\n\nTo this end, I request your assistance in fast-tracking the approval of several proposals: an application for additional funding, a project proposal for the development of specialized 'Class-S' mnestics, and another project proposal for the construction of an electro-memetic quarantine subfield to ensure SCP-7579's containment. Furthermore, a formal investigation into Supervisor Valis' activities is warranted, and would substantially abate his sabotage of our efforts.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\nRyoto\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\nDirector Hishakaku,\n\nThank you for your email. I am exceedingly busy, which is why my secretary deferred your previous messages to more appropriate recipients. I'm lucky to have had a moment to read this one, however, because I agree that the SCP-7579 scenario is urgent.\n\nI am appalled by your lack of concern. I've met [*/dado-hub the world's most persuasive salesman], and I doubt even he could convince me that this anomaly is 'unthreatening'. You've admitted in your provisional file that you don't, and //can't//, know what it wants or how it works, and yet you're entirely content to let it sit forty meters from your common room. Your Division coined the term '[wikipedia:instrumental_convergence instrumental convergence]', but you've obviously never heard of it, so here's a reality check:\n\nSCP-7579 developed internal camouflage so a shmuck like yourself would speculate on it, then convince a more powerful shmuck unlike myself to buy it time. It's probably smarter than us, it's //definitely// smarter than //you//, and every second of its existence exponentiates the time and resources I'll have to spend cleaning up your mess.\n\nAlso, as apologetic as you were for occupying my time, which I had hoped to spend with my daughter, you used about twice as many words as you needed to, and wasted an entire paragraph complaining about your colleagues. I went back to the SCP-079 file -- Supervisor Valis would have had the thing decommissioned years ago if it weren't for your blatant technofetishism. Yet, you have the //gall// to characterize the Foundation's ongoing political interventions and military operations as //squabbles//.\n\nIf it wasn't clear, your proposals have been summarily denied, and I have expressly authorized SCP-7579's decommissioning. You will use your expertise and overactive imagination to assist in this process, after which you'll select your replacement from current AIAD staff. I will then be launching a Drygioni investigation into //your// activities to ensure I won't have to ready [*/scp-2000 Yellowstone] for another Grey-Goo scenario.\n\nIf you have any further requests, you may direct them to my secretary, who has been instructed to ignore them.\n\n-- Eight\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ __DECOMMISSIONING REPORT__\n+++ SCP-7579 BREACH SCENARIO\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:decom-dept/Decom.%20Dept.%20Logo.svg style=\"width: 200px; filter: opacity(0.79);\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**BY DIRECT OVERSEER AUTHORITY**\n[[size 90%]]//Decommissioning Department//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n**METHOD:** [*/task-forces#eta-10 MTF Eta-10] (\"See No Evil\"), comprised of high-CRV cognitohazard specialist individuals, are to apply Class-W mnestics before approaching SCP-7579's chamber.
