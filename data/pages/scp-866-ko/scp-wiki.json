Ulundi, South African Republic, April 5th, 1974]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-866-KO\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Since the South African Republic's ban on Apartheid in the early 90s, SCP-866-KO manifestations have not been reported. Proposals to reclassify SCP-866-KO's containment class as Neutralised are under discussion.\n\n**Description:** SCP-866-KO is a phenomenon where the death of the anomalous artist Ingoma Ezulwini's death is reproduced in other people. Ingoma Ezulwini is a Zulu male of South African nationality and the founder of the African rights organisation, \"Iculo Labokumelana\"[[footnote]]\"Song of Resistance\" in Zulu. It's a sub-organisation of the anomalous artist GoI, \"Noonday Oak troupe\"[[/footnote]], which actively utilised anomalous technologies for its activities.\n\nIn the mid-late 20th century SAR, many African thaumaturgists such as Ingoma sought methods to utilise their anomalous powers to fight against the oppression of the SAR government. Iculo Labokumelana(IL) was formed in 1962, shortly after the incarceration of Nelson Mandela. It was a small organisation comprised of 20 thaumaturgists from various tribes, including Ingoma, his son Inkhanyezi Ezulwini, Thomas Mahlangu, and Maria Nombuyiselo Sontonga. Their primary activity method was using anomalous technology to organise street protests and marches that would otherwise be too big to commence. The most well-known anti-Apartheid protest led by the IL was the march demanding the dissolution of Bantustan, where a great crowd of over 20,000 protesters marched distance of 480 kilometres from uMgungundlovu[[footnote]]Zulu name for the South African city, Pietermaritzburg[[/footnote]] to Pretoria for thirty days, and returned to uMgungundlovu the very next day.\n\nThe SAR police were aware that Ingoma and his colleagues were using anomalous technologies for their activities. However, they hesitated to arrest IL thaumaturgists because the IL is a subgroup of an international NGO rather than an independent organisation. Nevertheless, African lives under the Apartheid government's rule were tough. As a consequence, some thaumaturgists abandoned the anti-Apartheid movement altogether in despair or became radical, changing their methods into armed struggles. Ingoma was loyal to his peaceful methods throughout his lifetime. However, young Inkhanyezi grew sceptical about his father's path, leading to a disagreement about the IL's direction.\n\nThe conflict between the Ezulwinis ended in the death of Ingoma on April 5th, 1974, when he was shot dead by Inkhanyezi in a Zulu rally held in Ulundi. The void in leadership eventually resulted in the dissolution of the IL as the thaumaturgists scattered. Some of them, such as Maria N. Sontonga, were killed for various reasons. However, they all died the same way Ingoma died, murdered by people who were close to them. Inkhanyezi Ezulwini was arrested on the day of the murder by the SAR police but was released on parole a few months later. After that, he stopped all external activities and recluded in his small home in the suburbs of Ulundi.\n\nOn November 2nd, 1979, the first SCP-866-KO manifestation was reported. SAR police records show that several police informants dispatched to Zulu territories reported witnessing a Zulu male visually identical to Ingoma Ezulwini in a place not too far from Inkhanyezi's house. While the authority's response was delayed as they were suspicious of the report, the person approached Inkhanyezi's house, wandered around, leapt over the fence, forced open the door, and subdued Inkhanyezi.\n\nInkhanyezi was trying to commit suicide with his shotgun but failed as he had his shotgun taken away and subdued. Inkhanyezi immediately identified the person as Ingoma Ezulwini, who spoke with his son for approximately 30 minutes before disappearing. The following day, Inkhanyezi Ezulwini vanished, after which he was seen again a week later in a small rally demanding the release of Nelson Mandela in Umtata[[footnote]]Modern-day Mthatha, South African Republic. It is famous as the birthplace of Nelson Mandela.[[/footnote]], which was over 900 kilometres away. In the rally, he announced the reorganisation of IL. Shortly after, thaumaturgists, mainly comprised of the children of former IL members, joined the newly formed IL, continuing their anti-Apartheid efforts via peaceful methods.\n\nInkhanyezi Ezulwini died on June 2nd, 1982, by an explosive set by the police. However, SCP-866-KO started manifesting again in all of the SAR after his death. The formerly dead thaumaturgists, such as Maria N. Sontonga, were seen alive in the process, leading to mass confusion among the police authorities. This was when the Foundation started an investigation of SCP-866-KO, discovering that the anomalous phenomenon after Ingoma Ezulwini's death is occurring again to other thaumaturgists. The subjects of the phenomena, including Ingoma Ezulwini, fit the following criteria:\n\n* The dead subject possessed anomalous abilities such as thaumaturgy and ontokinetics, either acquired or from birth.\n* The target is still alive and has formed a strong mental bond with the dead subject.\n* The target is physically healthy but has no physical or mental support besides the dead subject.\n* The dead subject is deliberately and directly killed by the target.\n\nThaumaturgists subject to SCP-866-KO all appeared near the target's current location, attempting to interact with them before disappearing after 20 minutes to 3 hours. In all observed SCP-866-KO manifestations, none of the revived thaumaturgists showed hostility or hatred towards the target but rather showed positive interactions, such as reconciliation, mundane conversations, and advice.\n\nUntil the de-facto abolition of Apartheid by the SAR government in the mid-1990s, there were 34 observed cases of SCP-866-KO. No further manifestations have been reported since the election of President Nelson Mandela on 27-02-2019.\n\n**Addendum:** Twenty-three (23) target individuals of SCP-866-KO have made contact with the Foundation. All of them reported hearing voices a few hours before the manifestation. What the voice said varied in detail depending on the person, but in common, the voice was a male singing the traditional Zulu folk song, \"Thula Baba\". Those who knew Inkhanyezi Ezulwini in his life reported that the male voice was his.\n\nBelow is the lyrics of Thula Baba and its translation.\n\n> //Thula thul, thula baba, thula sana//\n> //Hush, hush, hush-a-bye little man, be quiet baby//\n> \n> //Thul'ubab uzofika ekuseni//\n> //Be quiet. Daddy will be back in the morning.//\n> \n> //Thula thul, thula baba, thula sana//\n> //Hush, hush, hush-a-bye little man, be quiet baby,//\n> \n> //Thul'ubab uzofika ekuseni//\n> //Be quiet. Daddy will be back in the morning.//\n> \n> //Kukh'inkhanyezi zi-holel'ubaba//\n> //There's a star that will draw him home.//\n> \n> //Zimkhanyisela indlel'e ziyakhaya//\n> //It will illuminate his path home to where we are//\n> \n> //Sobe sikhona, ka bonke bashoyo//\n> //All will urge on, they'll say, go back.//\n> \n> //Bayathi buyela, ubuye le khaya//\n> //He returned to this home.//\n[[footnoteblock]]",
