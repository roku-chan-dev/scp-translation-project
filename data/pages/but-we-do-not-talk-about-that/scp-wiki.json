Seven minutes. Seven minutes he had been pointing his rifle, seven minutes without moving a muscle, going on eight. He had heard the screams, but seen nothing. He could not hold it off any longer. He had to see what was going on.\n\nStrelnikov inched his way towards the doors, then peeked. He saw the thing standing near a pile of corpses, tapping madly on the device in its hands, its body glowing with a dull red heat. Strelnikov recognised beeps of confirmation. He rounded the corner, keeping his sights trained on the figure. His boot squeaked. The thing glanced over its shoulder.\n\nStrelnikov saw red splatter from his chest, then saw nothing at all.\n\n------\n\nTechnical Researcher [[[david-rosen-file| David Rosen]]] stared at his screens, listening to his boxes hum.\n\nThe database, Rosen thought, was a giant brain. A constant influx of sensory data, reaching out and categorising the world. The brain is easily distracted, easily disturbed. A hit to its metaphorical noggin, and a metaphorical concussion would transpire. But there were more subtle problems, and it was one of these that plagued him now.\n\nRequests could be made in the field; transfers, requisitions. The system automated most of these, when reasonable. But here was an order to provide an asset to an unrelated person, seemingly without justifiable need. The system consulted Rosen. Rosen looked at the words, felt himself approve it against his will, then fell to the floor.\n\nRosen felt his ears buzz with white noise; silent screams, then screaming silence.\n\n------\n\nDr. Ellis \"Iceberg\" Gill looked at the small pill in his hand.\n\nIt could cure any illness, they said. He had asked before. Many, many times. And he had been denied just as many. Yet here he held one in his hands. He smiled. Perhaps some administrator had seen fit to ease his discomfort. Empathy was a rare thing in this line of work. Iceberg gulped down the pill. He felt a gurgling, then a wrongness.\n\nThe room grew colder, and colder, and colder. Iceberg shivered, and shivered, and shivered, and then the shivers stopped as the water in his cells froze and expanded and popped the neurons that passed on the message that he was far, far, far too cold. The man of cold realised that the pill was not curing the cold. It was curing the man.\n\nIceberg dropped, then shattered, blue shards of human clattering across the floor.\n\n------\n\n> Sometimes it is more than two in three.\n> But we do not talk about that.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
