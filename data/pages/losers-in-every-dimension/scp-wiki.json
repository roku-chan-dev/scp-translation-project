FOREST – EVENING**\n\n//The sun is dropping over a small, sleepy-looking town, surrounded on all sides by the Cascade Mountains. The woods are lush and green in the early summer.//\n\n//A long, narrow gravel road winds into the forest. At the end of it, a pair of red shipping containers refurbished into a small cabin. An ATV is parked next to it.//\n\n//A strange-looking wind chime object hangs in front of one window. It’s made entirely out of different types of teeth.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nI’m not “self-isolating.”\n _\n _\n**INT. CABIN – CONTINUOUS**\n\n//Inside the cabin is what amounts to a studio apartment. Small and cluttered, but cozy enough. The furniture is mismatched and secondhand, sometimes with DIY repairs to broken pieces. There’s a dumbbell rack and a punching bag in one corner, beside a large firearm safe. One full size bed in another corner.//\n\n//WATTS, early 30’s, uses a prosthetic arm to sweep a few empty beer cans off a coffee table into a garbage bag. A partial commitment to a beard, overgrown black, wavy hair mostly obscuring the fractal-like scar across half his face. A black glass prosthetic in place of his left eye. He’s talking on the phone into a pair of earbuds. He looks tired.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nI don’t know what she expects me to do. Nobody does shit out here. At least I agreed to this. \n _\n//We follow him out a sliding glass door to where he tosses the bag into a bear-proof trash can. It takes a second for his prosthetic hand to get a good grip on the lid.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nNo. I have no idea. There’s people here from some other site. Contracts for sending more retirees out here or something, I dunno. It’s some guy from that, I think. It’s only a couple hours and then Capra will get off my ass. Hopefully. Fuck off, I’m not nervous.\n _\n//Back inside. He picks up his phone from the kitchen counter, dropping into one of two chairs at a small dining table. He snorts sarcastically.//\n _\n**WATTS**\n(sarcastic)\nYeah. The devil from the Bible, that’s who it’s gonna be. Okay, I gotta go. No. Ask him, I’m not telling you shit. Bye. BYE, I have to go.\n _\n//He sits in silence for a moment. Drops his head onto the table and lets out a long sigh.//\n\n//KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK//\n\n//Watts looks toward the front door. He stands, bracing himself against the table for a moment before crossing the room.//\n\n _\n**EXT. CABIN – CONTINUOUS**\n\n//The blue front door of the cabin opens to where Watts stands behind it, glancing distractedly back over his shoulder.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nSorry for the walk, I know it’s a-\n _\n//He finally looks toward the stranger in the doorway, stopping mid-sentence. He stares for a moment. Looks the stranger up and down.//\n\n//BELIAL, mid 40’s, is a tall, smartly-dressed man wearing tortoiseshell glasses and a beige suit. There isn’t a speck of dirt on him. He grins amicably.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nGood evening! Ira, was it? I hope I’m not too late!\n _\n//Watts stares at him for several more seconds.//\n\n//Belial coughs awkwardly.//\n\n//Watts glances toward the clock on the microwave inside. It reads 8:01.//\n\n//He shakes it off, gesturing Belial inside.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah. Sorry. Thanks for coming, uh, come on in.\n _\n _\n**INT. CABIN – EVENING**\n\n//Belial looks around the small cabin with amused curiosity.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nSo you’re… Ben? \n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes indeed! “Ben.” That’s me! Very interesting flat you’ve got, mate.\n _\n**WATTS**\nSorry, what site are you from again? Er, I thought your group was coming in from- like, Indiana, or something. \n _\n**BELIAL**\nOh, I’m not local.\n _\n**WATTS**\nFrom somewhere around London then?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nOr something.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWant anything to drink?\n _\n//Belial sits down on a slightly rickety barstool across the kitchen counter as Watts opens the fridge.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nChamomile, if you have any?\n _\n//Watts looks up past the fridge door and cringes awkwardly.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNo tea?\n _\n**WATTS**\nI have beer?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nEugh…\n _\n**WATTS**\nI have a fifteen dollar bottle of red.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nBrilliant!\n _\n _\n**EXT. CABIN – NIGHT**\n\n//The sun has set over the Cascades. Crickets and night birds are alive around the cabin. The light from the windows looks inviting.//\n\n _\n**INT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS**\n\n//Belial sits at the tiny bar counter, Watts leans up against a wall across the room. Both hold unmatched coffee mugs half-full of red wine. Belial talks animatedly as Watts polishes off his mug.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nAnd they didn’t even INVITE me! I mean, bloody hell, after everything I’d done for them. All worked out in my favor, though. I eventually pulled some strings and got two of them fired.\n _\n**WATTS**\nFrom your agency?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes. Not from the Foundation.\n _\n**WATTS**\nSo you’re like a private contractor?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMore of a consultant, I like to think. \n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat do you do?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNothing very interesting! It’s a lot of paperwork. The type of paperwork the Foundation doesn’t want to do. Takes centuries, you could even say.\n _\n//Watts studies Belial as he’s talking, squinting suspiciously.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI like to think I used to have it a lot like you did, actually! Glory days and all. My life was much more exciting before all… this. But what is one to do? Things turn out the way they’re going to turn out, don’t they?\n _\n**WATTS**\nDon’t I know it.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThat’s why I’m here, I suppose. I have a friend who has a friend who has a friend who might need some company. And I’m always keen on meeting interesting new people.\n _\n**WATTS** \n(chuckling)\nSorry to disappoint.\n _\n//Belial claps him on the shoulder, laughing.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou and I both then!\n _\n**WATTS**\nHonestly, I’m really curious what kind of “glory days” somebody like you would have.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nSomeone like me?\n _\n**WATTS**\nPencil pushers. No offense. \n _\n**BELIAL**\nNone taken. But between us,\n _\n//Belial sips his wine, smiling mysteriously over the rim of the mug.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThat might be second date material.\n _\n**WATTS**\n...Right.\n _\n//They sit in silence for a moment. It’s a little uncomfortable. Belial clears his throat.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m happy to help start dinner, if you’re-\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhy are you here?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nSite-68 is meeting with Dr. Church for discussions on-\n _\n**WATTS**\nNo, why are //you// here? You’re not even an employee of 68. You’re a contractor. \n _\n//Watts’ demeanor has become significantly more tense.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nSo what is a private contractor doing at a mundane retirement plan negotiation?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m sorry, have I said something to upset you?\n _\n**WATTS**\nCan you answer the question?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI needed time away from the office. This town is one of the Foundation’s best kept little secrets. It’s beautiful. \n _\n**WATTS**\nYou’re sure there’s nothing else?\n _\n//Belial is getting defensive. The two of them are beginning to bristle at each other like cats.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMr. Watts, I think you’ve spent an awful lot of time in danger and there might be a possibility that you’re reading signals into this situation that aren’t there.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWe’re in the middle of an illusion nexus. I’m pretty good at reading the right fucking signals.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nDoes it have anything to do with that eye of yours?\n _\n//They stare each other down. Watts’ eyes narrow.//\n\n//WATTS’ POV: A bright, shimmering orange-red cast oscillates around Belial’s body.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat are you?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m leaving.\n _\n//Belial stands and steps toward the door.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nWait a second, I don’t think you are.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t have the patience for this. Goodnight, Mr. Watts.\n _\n//Watts suddenly plunges his hand into the gravel of a fake potted plant and withdraws a handgun.//\n\n//There’s a rune of some kind carved messily into the barrel. He trains the sight on Belial’s forehead.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou’re not going anywhere until I know you’re not planning on hurting the kids.\n _\n//Belial sighs, barely reacting.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou can’t see what I am?\n _\n**WATTS**\nI can see that you’re not human.\n _\n//Belial chuckles coldly.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nSo you’re at least aware that I’m not mortal. \n _\n**WATTS**\nThat body you’re in is mortal enough.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYour gun can’t hurt me.\n _\n**WATTS**\nEh. It packs a punch.\n _\n//Belial’s body dissolves, vanishing into the air in ribbons of white sand. The lights in the room flicker, and every shadow stretches toward the spot where he stood, like black water flowing into a drain.//\n\n//Watts steps back against the wall, scanning the room, the pistol held in front of him. Belial steps back into existence, his body reforming barely two feet from where Watts stands. He’s several inches taller.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI have no interest in hurting anyone in this town. Not even you.\n _\n**WATTS**\nThen leave.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThat was the plan.\n _\n//The lights in the cabin return to normal as Belial turns on his heels, back to the front door. His face is written with frustration and disappointment.//\n\n _\n**EXT. CABIN – NIGHT**\n\n//Darkness has fallen fully now. Watts watches from the doorway as Belial walks down the gravel path into the dark, unlit woods. The gun is still in his hand.//\n\n//Belial abruptly stops about thirty feet from the door, just in front of the mailbox. He moves to take another step, but doesn’t.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nUhh…\n _\n//Belial turns over his shoulder, shooting Watts a perplexed expression.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThere’s… some kind of barrier?\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat? Oh, shit-\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI assume you know?\n _\n**WATTS**\nGod dammit.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNot God, but close enough.\n _\n**WATTS**\nMy fucking wards, they’re stronger after dark.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYour wards.\n _\n**WATTS**\nMy house is warded, there’s- there’s weird shit out here, alright? You’re not a fairy, are you? Are you a fairy?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNo. I’m not a “fairy.”\n _\n**WATTS**\nShit. Okay. They’re for keeping stuff out, I’ve never seen them keep anything in. \n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t think I could cross this safely.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat? Really? You’re not afraid of an enchanted weapon but you //are// afraid of some shitty folk magic wards?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI could get out if I wanted to. That wouldn’t be a problem at all. It’s more an issue of the- er, the discharge of energy that would occur when I did. You see, it’s a negligible amount of power for me, but it’s a fairly small area, and that amount of-\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou’d blow up my house?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI would most likely blow up your house, yes. \n _\n//Watts rubs his hand down his face.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nGreat. Shit. Shit!\n _\n//He kicks the dirt, dropping onto the front step with an exasperated groan.// \n\n//Belial stands awkwardly at the end of the drive. He straightens his suit jacket just to have something to do with his hands.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m happy to- uh, wait out here until morning, if that’s preferable. I don’t have much of a desire to leave a crater in your lovely forest.\n _\n//Watts says nothing. Belial looks uncomfortable.//\n\n//Then, with a sharp, deep inhale, Watts stands back up.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nI don’t want you- //lurking// around out here all night.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t //lurk//. I’m not a //lurker.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nGoddammit, just come back inside.\n _\n//Belial watches Watts shove his hand in his pocket and turn back around, disappearing into the cabin.//\n _\n**WATTS OFFSCREEN**\nAre you coming in or not? \n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes! Yes, sorry.\n _\n//Belial follows after him, closing the front door behind him.//\n\n _\n**INT. CABIN – CONTINUOUS**\n\n//Belial stands in the doorway as Watts rounds the cabin, drawing shades over all the windows.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nOkay. Here’s how this is going to work. You’re staying on //that// side and I’m staying on //this// side. And I’m not sleeping all night, and I’m not letting go of this gun, and in about eleven hours the sun will come back up and you can get the hell out. Sound cool?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI never should have come here. \n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah, you shouldn’t have.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThis was even more of a waste of time than I thought it would be.\n _\n**WATTS**\nI bet “Ben” isn’t even your real name.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIt’s not. It’s Belial.\n _\n**WATTS**\n//Belial?!// Like the demon?! From Hell?!\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes.\n _\n**WATTS**\nLike, in the Gregorian chants and the Bible and shit?!\n _\n**BELIAL**\n//Yes.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nAwesome. Course this happens. Why does everything always have to be so- Fuck. I’m getting a new therapist.\n _\n//Belial rolls his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose under his glasses.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIra-\n _\n**WATTS**\nNah, don’t use the first one.\n _\n**BELIAL**\n//Mr. Watts.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nBetter.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m not trying to be hostile. //All// of this is coming from //you.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah. You’re right. You’re right.\n _\n//Watts stands up stiffly, bee-lining for the kitchen. He throws open a cupboard and starts digging through it. Belial watches, eyes narrowed in annoyed confusion.//\n _\n**WATTS OFFSCREEN**\nThis should help-\n _\n//Watts passes by Belial on his way back to his spot on the floor on the opposite side of the room. He drops something in Belial’s lap – A half-full handle of scotch. He pats Belial’s head on his way past.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nMaybe we both need to calm down.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m a demon, this isn’t going to-\n _\n**WATTS**\nDoes your frail human body get drunk?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIt //can.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nThen bottoms up. I’m not doing twelve hours of this sober.\n _\n//Watts pops the cork of his bottle of rum and flicks it across the room before taking a long pull.//\n\n//Belial shrugs and uncorks his as well.//\n\n _\n**MONTAGE**\n\n//A. Belial and Watts bicker heatedly from opposite sides of the room.//\n\n//B. Belial paces the room in circles, rambling animatedly about something. His suit jacket is piled on the floor. Watts has moved to a chair and rolls his eyes as Belial prattles on.//\n\n//C. Belial rolls up his shirt sleeve and they plant their elbows on the table- arm wrestling. Watts wins easily, giving Belial a smug victorious laugh. Belial shakes out his arm and goes for a rematch. The moment they start, a thick haze of sandy white particles forms around Belial’s arm, and he slams Watts’ hand back to the table. Watts curses at him.//\n\n**END MONTAGE**\n\n _\n**INT. CABIN – NIGHT**\n\n//Watts stands at the kitchen counter, still sipping from a bottle. Belial is lying on the floor with his feet on a chair. He’s throwing a tiny [[[scp-6326 |Manbear]]] plush up in the air and catching it.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou’re a real twat, you know.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat the //fuck// does that even mean?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou’re an arsehole.\n _\n**WATTS**\nShut up. You could have picked any human body and you still picked British.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI happen to like this one. Not like it’s any of your business. You’re not seeing the rest of it. \n _\n**WATTS**\nWho said I wanna see the rest of it?!\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThis is a date, isn’t it?\n _\n**WATTS**\nOh, fuck off.\n _\n**BELIAL**\n//Isn’t// it?\n _\n**WATTS**\nNo! Not anymore! And you don’t fuck on the first date anyway!\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMaybe //you// don’t.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah. I don’t.\n _\n//Belial mutters under his breath.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nBut you //do// have the general air of someone who hasn’t gotten a bit of tail in a //long// time.\n _\n**WATTS**\nHey!\n _\n**BELIAL**\nAm I wrong?\n _\n//Watts pauses, glaring at him. He opens his mouth. Closes it.//\n _\n**WATTS**\n...No. \n _\n**BELIAL**\nHa.\n _\n**WATTS**\nBut //you// look like if a filing cabinet came to life.\n _\n//Belial fails to catch the Manbear plush. It bounces off his face. He props himself up on his elbows, wearing an expression of very competitive offense.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou look like you got one sleeve caught in an ice auger. \n _\n**WATTS**\nYou look like you eat the color beige.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou look like something they’d pull out of a shower drain at a crime scene.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou look like you’re going to try and sell me a timeshare.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou look like //you’re// going to try and sell me your mix CD on the subway.\n _\n//Watts barks out a laugh before doubling over, dropping his head onto his arms and wheezing. Belial chuckles as he sits up.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou got me.\n _\n**WATTS**\nThat was good. You roast me almost as good as the kids do. \n _\n**BELIAL**\nI saw some of them today. Absolutely monstrous. Did you teach them to be like that?\n _\n**WATTS**\nLike what?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nWell, one of them called me a “five head.”\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah, they’re going through a mean phase.\n _\n**BELIAL**\n//All// of them?\n _\n**WATTS**\nThey’re //all// thirteen.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t know how you manage it. Sticky little creatures.\n _\n//Watts’ body language relaxes as he’s talking. He’s also pretty drunk.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nIt’s not as bad as people say. You just have to respect them and meet them at their level. They’re mostly fine as long as you’re not totally shitty to them. God, I was a little dickhead when I was their age too. \n _\n//Belial quietly watches him ramble.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nDon’t get me wrong, they still piss me off. But they’re teenagers, they’re //supposed// to piss everybody off. They’re good kids, though. They try really hard.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou look very different right now.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWhat?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou look different. Clearer. \n _\n**WATTS**\nMan, look, I’m too drunk for whatever it is you’re talking about.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNevermind. Should we make dinner?\n _\n**WATTS**\nOh, shit. Yeah.\n _\n _\n**MONTAGE**\n\n//A. Watts is washing rice as Belial shoots a bouncy ball into a beer pong arrangement of random mugs. He misses repeatedly.//\n\n//B. They stand on opposite sides of the kitchen counter, both angrily ranting about something, but they’re on the same side of the issue. A pot simmers on the stove.//\n\n//C. They’re sitting on the floor with dishes of stew and tahdig, laughing so hard they’re borderline crying.//\n\n**END MONTAGE**\n _\n**INT. CABIN – NIGHT**\n\n//Belial is still sipping from a bottle of wine. Watts is lying on his back on the floor. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink. It’s late.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIt’s so… //different// now. You’re all so connected and disconnected at the same time. I don’t know how you all do it.\n _\n**WATTS**\nWe all have depression and hate ourselves, that’s how.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI miss orgies. People don’t have orgies like they used to.\n _\n**WATTS**\nDude, that suuuucks for you.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIt does. It does suck for me. Nobody invites me to orgies anymore.\n _\n**WATTS**\nNobody ever invited //me// to orgies.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nDid you //want// to go to orgies?\n _\n**WATTS**\nNo. But I dunno, it’d be nice to be asked.\n _\n//Watts pries himself off the floor with an exhausted groan.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nUgh, I need to go to bed. I’m drunk. I’m too old to be doing this shit.\n _\n//He gestures toward the single full-size bed in the back corner of the cabin.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou can take the bed. I’ll be on the floor.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nNo. I can sleep on the floor. My mortal body isn’t even real, in the sense that yours is.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou’re a guest. I’m not making you sleep on the fucking floor.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMost people have a pull-out sofa or something.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYou’re really overestimating how many people come here.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI insist that you take the bed.\n _\n**WATTS**\nI insist //you// take the damn bed.\n _\n//They stare each other down for a moment. Stalemate.//\n\n _\n**INT. CABIN – LATER**\n\n//Watts and Belial are in sleeping bags on the floor on opposite sides of the empty bed. Watts’ prosthetic lies on the floor a few feet away.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThis is really how you want to do this?\n _\n**WATTS**\nYes.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nAlright.\n _\n**WATTS**\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve drank this much.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMe as well.\n _\n**WATTS**\nIt doesn’t count for you. You don’t even feel it.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI //do// feel it. I’m in this meat person shell. I //want// to feel it.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah? How is it?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nFeels brilliant. And also shit.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYuuuup.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYou’re a decent cook though.\n _\n**WATTS**\nCan I tell you a secret?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes?\n _\n**WATTS**\nThat’s the only thing I really know how to cook. I’m shit at everything else.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t know if I believe that.\n _\n**WATTS**\nIt’s true. I hate cooking. I used to eat MRE’s like half the time but my doctor said it was destroying my intestines.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nThere’s something wrong with you.\n _\n**WATTS**\n(laughing)\nYeah.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI used to be somebody, you know.\n _\n**WATTS**\nYeah. You said.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI used to be somebody //important.//\n _\n//Watts turns toward him, watching his face through the space under the bed.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nPeople admired me. Feared me. //Worshipped// me. And now look at me. I’m drunk on the floor of a shipping container and my favorite body looks like a divorced accountant.\n _\n**WATTS**\n(snort laugh)\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI don’t know what happened. I should have people fawning over me. I shouldn’t have to resort to seeking company from… socially inept //Foundation// employees, of all things. No offense.\n _\n**WATTS**\nNo, I get it.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI miss it terribly. The action. The excitement.\n _\n**WATTS**\nThe point.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI’m sorry?\n _\n**WATTS**\nThe point. Having one.\n _\n**BELIAL**\nOh. Yes.\n _\n//Belial stares up at the ceiling, lost in thought.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIt’s strange. One day it seems like you’re king of the whole universe, and the next thing you know you’re doing paperwork in an office that always smells like burnt popcorn and wondering what you did wrong. And everybody looks at you with this dreadful sort of-\n _\n**WATTS**\nPity.\n _\n**BELIAL**\n//Yes!// All because now you can’t do what everyone thinks you’re //supposed// to do-\n _\n**WATTS**\nSo you just sit around trying to find some new shit to do-\n _\n**BELIAL**\nAnd you wake up one century and suddenly you don’t even recognize yourself anymore.\n _\n**WATTS**\nLike there’s only parts of that person left.\n _\n//Belial stops, turning his head toward Watts in surprise. Watts isn’t looking at him, just staring into space above him.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nYes. Just like that.\n _\n**WATTS**\nGuess it’s nice to know there’s losers in every dimension, huh?\n _\n**BELIAL**\nI suppose. I think it would be much worse if I was the only one.\n _\n**WATTS**\nMm.\n _\n//A pause for a moment. Crickets chirp loudly outside. Something in the forest makes an otherworldly, chortling laughter noise. Belial watches a strip of moonlight on the ceiling, the shadow of tree branches wavering through it.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nMaybe I’m just drunk, but I think I envy you, mate. You say you miss having a point but you have this. This place. Your students. You have //something.// I’m not even sure what I have left. Maybe I could try harder, but I’m tired. I don’t expect anything from anyone anymore. I lied to myself for a long time that I deserved better than this. But when all’s said and done, it’s my own fault, isn’t it? I only wish I knew what I //did.// But now I figure it follows that other people don’t like me. //I// don’t even like me.\n _\n//He pauses, sighing.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nBut it seems maybe you don’t entirely despise me. I suppose that counts for something.\n _\n//No response. The cabin is dark and quiet.//\n _\n**BELIAL**\nIra?\n _\n//Watts snores quietly. Belial chuckles to himself under his breath.//\n\n _\n**EXT. FOREST – MORNING**\n\n//A songbird sits on a tree branch as the sun streams through the pine needles. It shakes its feathers, briefly cycling through a rainbow of colors before it flies off.//\n\n _\n**INT. CABIN – CONTINUOUS**\n\n//Watts rolls over in his tangled sleeping bag into a patch of sunlight streaming in from between the blinds. It beams directly into his face. He groans, blinking awake and squinting against the light.//\n _\n**WATTS**\nFuck…\n _\n//He peels himself off the floor, sitting up and rubbing his hand down his face. He looks like shit.//\n\n//He pauses, and bends down to look under the bed toward the other side. Belial is gone, his sleeping bag folded up on the floor.//\n\n//Watts looks toward the kitchen, where the dishes are clean and all the empty liquor and wine bottle are lined up beside the sink.//\n\n//He stands up slowly, clearly hungover. He doesn’t bother to open the blinds on the windows. Watts shuffles to the kitchen, looking over the general lack of mess. Something catches his eye.//\n\n//On the clean counter is a small, square white card. Written neatly in ballpoint pen: “CALL ME.” Watts turns it over. On the back is a neat illustration of a summoning circle.//\n\n _\n**EXT. CABIN – CONTINUOUS**\n\n//Watts opens his blue front door, stepping out into the partly cloudy Pacific Northwest morning. He squints against the sun, then spots something, his face wrinkling in irritation.//\n\n//A few yards away is the charred evidence of a demonic circle, burned into the brush.
