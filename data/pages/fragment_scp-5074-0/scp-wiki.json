Requests made by SCP-5074 for further amenities are to be vetted by the resident Simian Containment Director.\n \nAll anomalous phenomena documented by SCP-5074 are to be researched and contained by MTF Epsilon-4 (\"Ape's Men\"). In the event that SCP-5074 documents an anomaly using a previously undiscovered esoteric object class, said classification is to be added to the Foundation Esoteric-Class Database.\n \n**Additional Note:** In a joint effort with GoI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions), SCP-5074 has been transferred to Enclosure 03 at Wilson's Wildlife Center to improve its morale and ensure continued cooperation. All documentation produced by SCP-5074 pertaining to anomalies and anomalous phenomena are to be analyzed by Foundation operatives working at Enclosure 03.\n \n**Description:** SCP-5074 is an adult male chimpanzee (//Pan troglodytes//) displaying advanced sapience. The entity is capable of reading and writing in English, Arabic, Bantu, and Swahili, and is fluent in Tanzanian Sign Language.\n \nSCP-5074 possesses extensive knowledge of human and world history, as well as an abnormal, encyclopedic intuition regarding anomalous phenomena. SCP-5074 is capable of explaining and writing documentation for anomalies unknown to the Foundation, and often does so without any instruction. The means by which SCP-5074 gains knowledge of anomalous phenomena is unknown.\n \nTo date, SCP-5074 has contributed 240 documents relating to novel anomalies to the Foundation.\n \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n||||||||~ Memo 354||\n||||||||~ 15/04/2014 ||\n||~ Sender || Michael Kilger ||~ Recipient || Duncan Ayers ||\n|||||||| Hey Duncan, I found this in that chimp's cage and I thought you'd get a kick out of it.
