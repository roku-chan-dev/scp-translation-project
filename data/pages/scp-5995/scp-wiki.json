Containment is a priority following the completed investigation into the murder of Mr Jake Brown in collaboration with the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5995 is an unidentified entity responsible for the murder of Mr. Jake Brown[[footnote]]To be referred to as Jake Brown in respect to his status as a victim of  murder according to GOC guidelines until investigation is complete.[[/footnote]]. Jake Brown was an ontokinetic anomaly whose presence required the rewriting of hume measurement procedures 13.A to 72.A-P. The following is a collection of related documentation in lieu of a description pending the discovery of SCP-5995.\n@@ @@\n[[code]]\n[[/code]]\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Report of Initial Discovery\" hide=\"Hide Report of Initial Discovery\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 7px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n||||||||~ __Authorization 044EM Memo to SCP Foundation Parties Regarding Incident 5995__||\n||~ Sender||Christopher Malone, Jr.  [[footnote]]A Global Occult Coalition Operative.[[/footnote]] ||~ Recipient||Nelson Aariak, PhD||\n||||||~ Subject|| Regarding Incident 5995||\n\nThe following events took place on February 19, 2008, 0530 EST.\n\nThree pieces of measurement technology, the furthest approximately 165km from the epicenter, notified surveying parties to EVE energy readings far beyond normal; I believe the conservative estimate was five standard deviations beyond baseline. I was deployed first in order to investigate. There were no reports among mundane communication channels(ie. calls to emergency services). My time to arrival was approximately two minutes, one of which was putting on my equipment.\n\nSince I was told I have to tell you almost everything, I'll be upfront. We knew about Jake Brown long before you did. We projected that the chances someone of his magnitude would appear in the general population at approximately one in five trillion. We put a target on his back since his abilities began to manifest back on his fourteenth birthday.\n\nObviously he caused no trouble until now and we knew immediately that he must've been the source of the sudden EVE spike.\n\nWhen I got to his place, my measurement equipment couldn't find traces of thaumaturgic energy laying around anymore. You know as well as I do that energy that big doesn't vanish like that unintentionally. I unlocked the door and walked in with a weapon drawn. The lights were on. \n\nI saw him laying on the carpet in the living area of the apartment. There looked be a large wound in his abdominal area. I couldn't be sure; chunks of him spilled up towards the ceiling as if that was the direction of gravity. I spotted a firearm[[footnote]]Origins of the firearm are currently unidentified.[[/footnote]] floating between himself and the ceiling, with a bullet frozen in the process of being fired. Jake Brown has no history of owning firearms. The whole place smelled like one spot in my childhood; a family trip to a 'breathing cave'. Each gust of air out of the cave smelled like this place- a mix of moisture and mold like an exhale from the earth.\n\nI spent the next two minutes surveying the rest of the space, then the entrails of Jake Brown remembered where gravity was supposed to go and fell back onto his body. Imagine a particularly heavy bout of rainfall.\n\nYour organization showed up after, so you know the rest of the story.\n\nAlso, regarding your request into equipment descriptions and schematics, you have to file a 4455EM-88-S. I attached an empty one and you can send it back to me.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Persons of Interest List\" hide=\"Hide Person of Interest List\"]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Vincent Matthew]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=bossman.jpg|caption=Matthew, January 2017|width=300px]]\n**Person of Interest: Vincent Matthew**\n\n**Age:** 56\n\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Height:** 1.82m\n\n**Weight:** 76 kg\n\n**Hair Color:** Grey\n\n**Eye Color:** Hazel\n\n**Current Location:** Ellisburg, New York, United States Of America\n\n**Relation to Victim:** Last Known Employer\n\n**Known Interactions With Jake Brown:** Vincent Matthew employed Jake Brown for the purposes of office organization at Symmetry Accounting and Tax Services, of which Vincent Matthew is Director of Human Resources. Jake Brown was employed by Vincent Matthew for thirteen months before an internal audit revealed that Jake Brown had utilized his access to payroll systems to be paid for hours he did not work. This caused a scandal within the Human Resources department which reflected poorly on Vincent Matthew, who was suspended without pay for the remainder of the auditing process. \n\nApproximately two weeks before Jake Brown's murder, Vincent Matthew was reinstated. One week before Jake Brown's murder, Vincent Matthew initiated communications with the Director of Legal Affairs in order to pursue legal action against Jake Brown. The Director of Legal Affairs rebuffed Vincent Matthew and indicated any further communication of interest in the subject will be reported to internal compliance personnel.\n\n**Other Notes:** Vincent Matthew frequents //The Stray Chickadee// (a Marshal, Carter & Dark affiliate), and has bid upon several artifacts but has reportedly yet to own any. He notably bids on weapons and keeps a collection of rifles.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Jaquelynne Strauss]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=ladymiss.jpg|caption=Strauss, August 2005|width=300px]]\n**Person of Interest: Jaquelynne Strauss**\n\n**Age:** 47\n\n**Sex:** Female\n\n**Gender:** Female\n\n**Height:** 1.60m\n\n**Weight:** 66kg\n\n**Hair Color:** Brown\n\n**Eye Color:** Brown\n\n**Current Location:** Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States Of America\n\n**Relation to Victim:** First Wife, Since Divorced\n\n**Known Interactions With Jake Brown:** Jaquelynne Strauss and Jake Brown attended Red Brook Highschool and remained in communication during Jaquelynne Strauss's attendance of Trillum Community College. After becoming pregnant with Jake's first son, Warden Strauss, Jaquelynne ceased her tertiary education in order to marry Jake Brown and raise Warden.\n\nJaquelynne Strauss currently has sole custody of Warden Strauss. Her relationship with Jake Brown lasted approximately ten years, after which she filed for divorce due to Jake Brown's failure to find employment. \n\nJaquelynne is currently in a legal disagreement with Jake Brown's current wife, Lauren Brown, for Jake Brown's life insurance payout and estate as Jake Brown was murdered while owing several thousand dollars in unpaid child support.\n\n**Other Notes:** Jaquelynne Strauss failed baseline measurement RI-9958, indicating an ontokinetic ability deviating from normal. No further clarifications were made from subsequent measurements. It is speculated Jaquelynne Strauss failed RI-9958 as a result of longterm proximity to Jake Brown.  \n[[/div]][[/tab]][[tab Samuel Farley]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=dudeguy.jpg|caption=Farley, June 2014|width=300px]]\n**Person of Interest: Samuel Farley**\n\n**Age:** 40\n\n**Sex:** Male\n\n**Gender:** Male\n\n**Height:** 1.81m\n\n**Weight:** 78kg\n\n**Hair Color:** Brown\n\n**Eye Color:** Blue\n\n**Current Location:** Ellisburg, New York, United States Of America\n\n**Relation to Victim:** In Relationship With Widow, Lauren Brown\n\n**Known Interactions With Jake Brown:** None\n\n**Other Notes:** Samuel Farley is in an ongoing, sexual relationship with Lauren Brown.

Malone replaces a near-empty box of tissues beside her. He places a cup of water in front of her. Brown drinks twice before speaking.//\n\n**Brown:** Okay. Okay. I'm. Oh god. Yes, okay. Call me Lauren. Just- what do you want?\n\n**Malone:** Could you tell us what you know about Jake? Was he in any trouble shortly before today?\n\n**Brown:** He- he just lost his job a while ago. Couldn't find another. With some tax firm, he, he was caught penciling in some extra hours. But he needed the money. They wouldn't kill him over a few hundred fucking dollars! \n\n**Malone:** Thank you. Please take a few breaths. We can go as slow as you need, Lauren. I'm here for you.\n\n**Brown:** He. He's a good man, Jacob. He doesn't have money- never even graduated- god. God. He never accomplished a thing but he was trying. He never stopped trying to get it together. He never should've done that stupid fucking thing. Never. \n\n**Malone:** Could you tell me more about the last few days leading up to today?\n\n**Brown:** Jake and I were, were having troubles. He was... He was really down. But I was telling him we were gonna make it work. We were gonna. He kept saying- he kept saying that— he didn't get it. Why it was so hard for him.\n\n**Malone:** Where were you last night, Lauren?\n\n**Brown:** Oh god, you don't-- you don't suspect-- fuck. I have a fucking alibi. I'm a waitress. I work evenings when my girls are with their dad. From another marriage.\n\n//Malone nods and waits for Brown to continue.//\n\n**Brown:** Okay, I'm more like a bartender. At //Mulligan's//.

It's clear that he has been crying for some time. His voice pauses as he sobs involuntarily between words.\n\n//**Jake Brown:** But I'm giving up, Lauren. It's just too hard for me to live the way the rest of you do. Maybe it's 'cause of what I got. I knew it since I was a boy but I thought I didn't need it. It was weak. But maybe that's what I am, Lauren. Maybe I'm too weak. Took me forty fucking years for me to get it through my thick goddamn skull.//\n\n//**Jake Brown:** Maybe that's why I got it.

After that I watch TV with my wife until bedtime. Around ten.\n\n**Malone:** Could you describe Jake Brown's employment at Symmetry Accounting and Tax Services?\n\n**Matthew:** Honestly, I shouldn't have hired the guy. Who applies to be a paper pusher at like, must've been at least thirty, maybe thirty-five? Either way. He just had such an earnestness about him, and I figured he couldn't be too much trouble. He was alright. No complaints. Until he started stealing money. //[Laughs.]//\n\n**Malone:** Could you talk more about that?\n\n**Matthew:** About the hiring or the stealing? I mean. His resume wasn't great. He doesn't even have an Associate's. He worked in construction, but his back blew out from an old sports injury. His references were decent. He worked well enough for a deadbeat, then he started adding hours he didn't work. Just a little each paycheck.\n\n**Malone:** So he was terminated.\n\n**Matthew:** And it was such a scandal he put me out of work while auditing counted everything there was the count. Huge pain for everyone. He sure got his karma, I say.\n\n**Malone:** Do you recall anything unusual happening in the days leading up to the murder?\n\n**Matthew:** Nope! So the rumor mill's saying that men in spacesuits were coming in and out of that apartment all day. I'd love to see //that// autopsy report!\n\n**Malone:** //[Pause.]// We'll see what we can do.

He couldn't hold a job. Couldn't even do community college. Look, Jake, is he in some sort of trouble?\n\n**McHannon:** We can talk about that later. Could you tell me more about what you know?\n\n//Strauss narrows her eyes and looks at McHannon for the next five seconds.//\n\n**Strauss:** He grew up an only child. I knew him since highschool. He was charming, handsome, but a little spaced out. Seemed always sort of... uncomfortable, though. Like he was sitting on the world's biggest secret and was terrible at hiding it.\n\n**McHannon:** //[Nodding.]// How did you and he interact in college?\n\n**Strauss:** I guess... I thought I could cure him? Of his discomfort? But I never could get through to him. I guess he needed a therapist, not a wife. At first I thought he was just on drugs or something. Always had that sort of really, deeply distressed look about him. Saw it in my brother sometimes, before the family found his drinking habit.\n\n**Strauss:** Warden, my son, sometimes looks like that, by the way. I tested him up and down and couldn't find a thing wrong about him. He tells me that there's strings in spaces no one else seems to know anything about. Except his arms are too short to reach them.\n\n**McHannon:** That must be really kind of you, to see a haunted soul and to try and help them.\n\n**Strauss:** I wouldn't use the word //haunted//. Just... tense. All over. Like he's holding a fist too long. Anyhow, what's this about, officer? I need to go pick up Warden.\n\n**McHannon:** Would you mind if we met with Warden?\n\n**Strauss:** //[Agitated.]// What's this about, officer.\n\n//McHannon takes off his hat.//\n\n**McHannon:** Well, ma’am. We have reason to believe your ex-husband has been murdered.\n\n//Strauss does not speak for the next fifteen seconds. Her gaze travels from the photo to her hands, her purse, and finally McHannon.//\n\n**Strauss:** I'd like to continue this conversation with my lawyer present.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n**Notes:** Warden Strauss was tested to have a higher than normal level of thaumaturgic potential according to Global Occult Coalition measurement reports. However, the reports speculated that Warden Strauss's potential to achieve any anomalous effect is similar to that of a baseline human and is therefore not a concern.

You want me to wait for //years//?!\n\n**McHannon:** I can. I can ask. //[Pause. Several deep breaths.]// I can ask to release to you details of the weapon. I'm sorry, Lauren.
