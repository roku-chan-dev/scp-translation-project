Lancaster\n**Subject:** Disciplinary Update\n[[/div]]\n------\nMr. Engle,\n\nA disciplinary hearing has been made regarding your recent actions. Not only did you ignore your present assignment, but your rogue behavior resulted in the death of an innocent bystander. The Analytics Department has found that the victim in question, an anartist by the name of Wally Mannington, had been following the crime scenes due to knowledge of them spreading through anomalous communities; several other individuals have been discovered doing the same, none having any connection to the crime spree.\n\nBarring unusual circumstances, you would be suspended from active duty. However, these are indeed unusual circumstances, as all our other investigators are either unavailable or are preoccupied with other assignments. You are to continue the investigation, under close watch by your superiors. The disciplinary review will be put on hold until further notice.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nMannington's blood is on my hands. Everything that happened was an absolute disaster, and I take full responsibility for it. He wasn't fully innocent, not by a long shot, but he was still a witness and I failed to protect them. I lost my only clue into what the hell Manahiem has to do with this all. Along with that, Disciplinary's recent ruling is frustrating.\n@@ @@\nI'm being railroaded into following a single lead. Though given the fact I haven't told anyone about the caller, I'm not surprised. The higher ups don't seem keen on me investigating some unsolved murder from 7 years ago when an active crime spree is going on.\n@@ @@\nI'll just have to bury myself in the SCP-7547 case for the time being. Take each one as they come and do the best with what I can find.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n||~ **Date** ||~ **Location** ||~ **Summary of Event** ||~ **Notes** ||\n|| 20/07/2019 || Boston Harbour || While unloading crates from a shipping vessel, a loose line suddenly tightened and snapped, resulting in the death of a nearby worker. Despite no injuries taking place in the facial region, the corpse was unrecognizable. || My superiors told me these incidents are being folded into the original SCP-7547 file, which makes writing about them easier. Regarding the death, no evidence of foul play has been found. None of the witnesses observed the actual impact either. I have a workmate who used to encounter anomalies like this when he first started working here. Effects with incongruent causes. Almost designed to be unsettling, he’d say. Perhaps something to look into. ||\n|| 20/07/2019 || I-95 Highway || A collision of two vehicles along I-95, resulting in two casualties: one death and the other in a comatose state. The engine of the vehicles poured saline water for an hour after the initial crash, and continued to emit a low droning noise after. || The family in the minivan said they saw someone (or something) in the middle of the road before the crash. They described it as red eyed. Possibly a trauma response, but not something to rule out just yet. As a side note, I still haven't been told why these anomalies are all being put under the SCP-7547 designation.||\n|| 29/07/2019 || Mattapan, Boston  || Last Thursday, a Hefftone Assoc. employee by the name of Amy Smith entered the building, wearing casual attire and sporting a large gash on her right forearm. Witnesses stated Smith was in a trance like state, ignoring external stimuli while walking towards the CEO’s office. After entering the office, the door could not be unlocked and its occupants were unable to be contacted. Following this, quality of life improvements were implemented; prior to this, all requests to change the company’s working conditions had been repeatedly ignored. Smith has not been seen since, and the CEO has refused to comment.|| From interviews with Smith’s coworkers, she was the type of person who placed the needs of others before her own. No indications of behavioral changes or that she was planning something, but everyone said a feeling of discontent had been growing in the atmosphere for a while. ||\n|| 16/08/2019 || Malcolm Dam ||Employees at a hydro-electric plant reported one of their coworkers had begun acting strangely. The worker in question, George Willis, was spending an increased amount of his off hours around the lake by the facility, and less time around other people. Additionally, traces of blood and hair were discovered at various points throughout the facility. These occurrences culminated in CCTV footage of an unknown animal exiting the plant at night and entering the lake. Willis could not be located. || Nothing came up when diving teams searched the lakebed. The area’s been placed under watch for the time being. There wasn’t much to go off of in Willis’ personal belongings, besides a couple books on Daoism with some sections highlighted; most of them had to do with //bianhua//, something which means “change” or “metamorphosis”. A couple folks on the nightshift also said something weird happened some days ago: they saw an elephant seal wandering the halls. No one reported it cause whenever the thing walked out of view it would disappear. Lines up with the sighting during the car crash, of some out of place fat animal showing up before it happens. As of now it’s our current suspect, though the idea that it’s trying to //stop// these events hasn’t escaped me. ||\n|| 18/08/2019 || Great Meadows National Reserve || A sudden drop in deer population in the nearby Great Meadows National Reserve show signs of being outcompeted by the invasive northern snakehead fish, which have adopted an artiodactyl lifestyle and morphology. || Each SCP-7547 event seems to share a common theme of change. At first I thought the only commonality was violence, but each time, that violence leads to something changing. The woman escaping her abuser, the company improving their working conditions, George Willis. And here, a change in the ecosystem through an invasive species.  ||\n|| 23/08/2019 to 29/08/2019 || Blue Hills Correctional Facility || Security guards within the facility are sporadically found murdered. Nobody present at the scene of the murders could recall having witnessed them. Prison officers did not acknowledge these killings, even to the point where the drop in working staff should have been noticeable. On August 29th, the prison was found to be fully staffed as it was pre-SCP-7547. The replacement prison officers were found to have been former prisoners at Blue Hills Correctional Facility, with said population evidently decreasing from previous records as well. Following this, reports of prisoner abuse declined. The acting prison warden refused to comment. || Likely antimemetic, though one of those [[[scp-4288|more discreet ones]]], if I had to guess. I wonder if a buildup of emotions correlates with SCP-7547 events. Actually, scratch that: abuse and isolation are meant to make you feel weak and compliant. Or maybe it's different in prison, since you're surrounded by people in the same boat as you. I can only speak from my own experience. ||\n|| 01/08/2019 || Carson Beach || A wrecked fishing boat was discovered on the beach, its structure heavily deformed to resemble a dolphin. Additionally, the vehicle displayed animate properties, mimicking shallow breathing. A hole was found on its underbelly, resembling a wound common in dolphin drive hunting attacks. || Aquatic life seems to be a recurring element. Elephant seals, sealions, seawater. And I know a similar calling card, back at Manahiem. ||\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nThe anartist called Suspect 7547 a “sealion,” the victims of SCP-7547 were babbling about sealife. Whoever’s behind this is going for an aquatic motif. I’m reminded of the bodies at Manaheim.\n@@ @@\nIf the killer has resurfaced, then what made them come back?\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**[AUDIO LOG]**\n**Location:** Adam Engle’s house\n**Date:** 02/08/2019\n**Time:** 05:00\n--------------\n\n[[=]]\n**Begin Log**\n[[/=]]\n\n//(Engle's bedside alarm goes off, waking him up. He sits on his bed for the next 15 minutes, seeming to contemplate. His phone buzzes with a call from an unknown number; he answers.)//\n\n**Engle:** Hello?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** Have you ever read //The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time//?\n\n**Engle:** You again.\n\n**Unknown Voice:** It’s about a young boy trying to solve the murder of his neighbor’s dog. At one point, the boy’s father grows frustrated with what he’s doing and makes him promise certain things to prevent him from investigating further. However, the boy stumbles across a couple loopholes that let him investigate without breaking his promise.\n\n**Engle:** So what’s the loophole here?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** You can’t go off the book if you’re not using company time in the first place. For your morning coffee, go to the Starbucks 86 miles south of Site-55. Sit on the second bench to the left of the entrance. You’ll meet someone for casual coffee talk.\n\n**Engle:** Why, though? What are you getting out of this?\n\n**Unknown Voice:** Everyone has dreams, Adam.\n\n//(Phone line disconnects.)//\n\n[[=]]\n**End Log**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nI went to the Starbucks, like the tinny voice said. Ordered my coffee and sat down for maybe 20 minutes, before a well-dressed woman in a business suit joined across from me. After a couple minutes of her being cryptic and trying to seem mysterious, she informed me she was an agent from Marshall, Carter, and Dark.\n@@ @@\nI asked her what a Mickey D employee was doing getting breakfast at a cheap cafe. She told me she did it on a whim based on a dream she had, but that she was happy to see me. When I asked why, she said “You’re the one trying to find that elephant seal, aren’t you?” Suspect 7547.\n@@ @@\nApparently, a lot of para-orgs are keeping tabs on the crime spree, and this isn't some nutjob with a tendency for sadism. She was vague (of course she was), but she said the incidents are leading up to something, something that everyone wants to get their hands on when it’s done; even the Foundation. Looks like there’s a reason they didn’t want me following leads they didn’t like.\n@@ @@\nThe agent gave me an offer: her people help me to get into the Foundation’s high security data storage, I help them grab some anomaly they’ve had their eyes set on. It felt less like a choice than it did a general formality. I don’t trust Mickey D, but I’m not gonna let the Foundation keep me in the dark on who killed my friends 7 years ago.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]] __Terminal #317__[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@------@@\n[[size 130%]]__**Notice**__[[/size]]\n@@------@@\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n> Greetings, {Adam Engle}.
