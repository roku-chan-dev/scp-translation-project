It’s in 2013, with the New Years Canon Contest, that they started gaining popularity and today, almost 45 of them exist on the Wiki. Some of them popular, some of them less popular, some others being dormant, some others being still alive and kicking to this day… not to mention that it’s pretty rare for two canons to have the same style and vibe (read //Third Law//, then //Lolfoundation//, then //Rat’s Nest// and contact me if you manage to see similarities).\n\nSo, yes, Canons are an essential part of the site… but what happens when people decide to take it a step further and create something even bigger: a megacanon? This is what some authors decided to do and, as such, //Metafoundation// was created. I sat down with [[*user Ralliston]], [[*user Grigori Karpin]], [[*user HarryBlank]], [[*user Liryn]] & [[*user Placeholder McD]], co-creators/active contributors to this canon[[footnote]] Also, big shout-out to [[*user Ihp]] & [[*user Nagiros]]! They declined to participate in the interview but their contributions to this megacanon and to the Wiki in general should not be overlooked. [[/footnote]], in order to know more about it.\n\n**So, thank you for accepting this interview! In order to start with the basics, can you explain in your words what //Metafoundation// is and which canons are a part of it?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|The best way to put it, I think, would be to say that //Metafoundation// is an attempt to make the site about collaboration together, at least to me. The entire project is rooted in crossing over with stuff other people have written in a way that expands on the work of both parties. It's what the Wiki was founded on and relied on for a large part of its existence, but I feel like in recent years, the site has been getting more about what you yourself write rather than what you and the other person writes. What we're trying to do -- at least how I myself see it -- is creating a large, unified world consisting of many smaller parts while still keeping their internal uniqueness, rather than an entirely disconnected collection of said parts, basically going against the trend I mentioned. And it so happened that making one \"unified\" world of a few canons we often cross over between was the most pleasant and natural way to do so.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|//Metafoundation// is an attempt to connect various ideas/canons together on the wiki through a concept of a multiverse. It’s an idea that has been tossed around a few times before, either casually or implied as so many different versions of the Foundation exist.##\n\n##purple|//Metafoundation// is an attempt to collect several canons we’ve created and concretely connect them in and out of the narrative.##\n\n##purple|But don’t take this the wrong way, it’s still formulated with the same sort of concepts as the rest of the wiki... you can take or leave the concept, as the reader wishes. One could read anything in Vanguard or OG43 (my focus being VKTM) and only think about them alone. Or if you’re interested, try to see them on a larger scale, as different narrative settings weave together.##\n\n##purple|Both are totally viable views on //Metafoundation//. For myself, it’s a background hum to the stories I want to tell.##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|//Metafoundation// is a collective of canonical approaches to the SCP Wiki which are more or less compatible with each other. Canons and series which can co-exist in the same reality peacefully enough that they can cross over, that they don't directly contradict each other in ways that would prevent them from doing so, and which stand to gain from being combined with other words. Most simply, the widest possible net of fiction on the wiki to create the sense of a diverse, varied, lived-in universe. It's also, because of that, a coalition of writers who enjoy working with each other to create such a world. There's an in-universe explanation for how these universes cross over when they do contradict each other occasionally, and they definitely do — some of them take place in realities clearly separate from that of the 'vanilla' Foundation — but that part is likely an answer to a different question.##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|Thanks for having me!##\n\n##green|//Metafoundation// is, in essence, a syndicate of connected canons and stories on the wiki, built to promote intense collaboration and creativity. It's the first of what we're choosing to call a \"megacanon\" — a larger canon-like structure made up of smaller, individual canons.##\n\n##green|Right now, we've welcomed //[[[on-guard-43-hub|On Guard 43]]]//, //[[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives]]]//, //[[[the-s-c-plastics-hub|S&C Plastics]]]//, //[[[no-return-hub|No Return]]]//, //[[[resurrection|Resurrection]]]//, //[[[the-gulf|The Gulf]]]//, //[[[site-17-hub|Deepwell Catalog]]]//, //[[[war-on-all-fronts-hub|War On All Fronts]]]//, //[[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD]]]//, and //[[[wonder-world|What A Wonderful World]]]// into the project, and there's several more on the way.##\n\n##green|These are all canons that have historically maintained notable compatibility with one another, or have crossed over frequently. //Metafoundation// is our way of officiating these connections, and pushing for more of them.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|//Metafoundation// is a project a few friends and I are working on, where a bunch of versions of the Foundation within our Megacanon (a group of related timelines in the SCPverse) decide to sign a contract (mentioned in a few articles as the 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement) which regulates interactions between their universes -- the transfer of goods and information, interactions between interations of the temporal anomalies department, et cetera. Only certain iterations of the Foundation are allowed into the Metafoundation, based on whether their storylines are closely-aligned-enough with that of the Prime-Timeline, which is the \"average\" timeline which has the most narrative potential and encompasses the most other SCP Wiki content within its canon (for example, the SPC is too different of a Foundation-entity to be accepted into the Agreement). All of this is going to be explained in an upcoming SCP which directly examines the Agreement and the histories of its creation.##\n\n**This looks like a pretty impressive project, frankly! Where did this idea come from and how did it take its current form? Is it something that grew in an \"organic\" way or were you planning of doing this ? How did you joined the project ?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|Well, the entire thing started off as a simple crossover in Harry's series between his //On Guard 43// and Ihp's //S&C Plastics//, and it somehow... just went from there. In //Metafoundation//'s very early days (before we even had a name), we were all still young authors that were developing their respective canons and were trying to find out places to branch out to, and the things our friends were writing at the time just felt like the best and most fun place to go. Over time, it just spiraled more and more, until we realized we came to share a universe of sorts with our projects. I myself have been playing with the idea of making a dedicated Discord server for my canon for a while back then, but I knew that something for such a small project alone wouldn't be too exciting, so I reached out to a few other friends that have been writing for this collaborative world about this idea, and the rest is pretty much history.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|Well, in some ways, my projects were folded in. Because of my central role in helping birth //No Return// (and specifically Vanguard within that canon) and [[[vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub|Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]] being a central part of //On Guard 43// canon, the projects I am working on are some of the central poles of this project.## \n\n##purple|But interestingly, I don’t have much to do with the idea of //Metafoundation//, which was mostly the brainchild of Ralliston, Liryn and Placeholder McD... that being said, I’m very happy to be a part of it.##\n\n##purple|I think it’s a fun new way to look at the ever-expanding world of SCP fiction, and I love that it’s there to enjoy or not, at the reader’s discretion. Because of the multiversal nature of it, one could easily focus in on one part and not worry about the rest. //Metafoundation// is not about ascribing concrete essential lore to all SCP. It’s a porous concept, with room for expanding understanding.##\n\n##purple|What’s funny is that my two projects, Vanguard and VKTM aren’t really going to directly address the wider concepts of Metafoundation. At least at first. Vanguard is a baby canon, just getting its feet under it and VKTM isn’t ever interested in deep lore specific treatises.##\n\n##purple|//although I will say that VKTM is Pan-universal as evidenced by [https://twitter.com/KneedVikander the canonical Twitter antics] of that GOI//##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|It happened around me. I've always liked big fictional settings where everything that's happened in earlier pieces of writing is considered to actually have happened unless it directly contradicts other, more important things, so that's how I've always written SCP. All the stuff that doesn't blow up the Earth or the Veil or completely alter the core conception of the universe is canon to my... canon, //On Guard 43//, and I have crossed over with a lot of that stuff. I wrote an entire tale series, //[[[the-time-after-time-password-hub|The Time-After-Time Password]]]//, which is ninety-five thousand words of crossing over my characters with other people's characters and locations and scenarios, and almost everything outside of OG43 that I write is implied to be canonical to it as well. When I joined Locke's SCP-6000 contest team my only stipulation was that our entry had to be a thing that would actually happen, a thing I could later reference, because I want to keep building continuing stories rather than doing one-offs with no later resonance. Linking with all this other stuff provided an entry point to bring it together more formally, a process to which I've been present for but haven't made my big contributions to yet. So I guess my contribution was to go \"is this a neat way of doing things? I think it is\" and other people ran with it. I like and respect those other people, and am happy to keep running with them!##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|I would definitely say it was an organic thing; these connections have existed for years now, but they have steadily grown in number. Towards the end of 2021 we would consistently refer to their existence — this is what prompted the project's creation.##\n\n##green|I can't say for sure that Metafoundation as a movement came from any specific person. It was a group effort.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|Well, Rall’ kept talking about this connected canon of canons and Liryn and I have both been planning some inter-timeline stuff for a while as a logical extension of some existing projects. We eventually realized that exploring the connections between timelines preemptively by representing the megacanon in-universe would be pretty nifty, so we started to create a server/community where people can talk about the different canons and their relationships while we work on our project that connects them.##\n\n**I see… but now, I’m wondering because I’ve read Canons for quite a long time and they’re all always pretty big. How does mixing them works? How do you look at this Canon and this other one and you say \"Hm, yup, these two look compatible, I’mma fusing them\"? Is it an easy process?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|It's a mostly natural process, at least for me. Whenever I crosslink (and I do that a lot) I try to think of an element from another friendly canon or article I could expand on both within the boundaries of its own world and my piece. Almost always, it comes naturally when I try to craft together some larger context I think would be interesting to include other things in to make it feel both more exciting and more believable. And using logical crosslinks helps achieve that state of verisimilitude and makes the world feel more connected, which I really, really enjoy. It's one of the first things that really made me interested in the Foundation universe when I first joined, its extreme expansiveness and size that still forms a coherent self. After all, two pieces of lore coming together to form a cohesive whole are almost always more exciting than when they're separate.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|Yeah, absolutely. They’ve certainly asked my opinion on things and I’ve given it, but also they respect the fact that my projects don’t really fit in the idea of being expressly concerned with establishing a wider meta canon.##\n\n##purple|That being said, I’ve certainly encouraged this project and think it’s super interesting. Plus, both my projects that are folded in are wide open to be used explicitly in such establishment (given one is a GOI and the other a canon, we welcome any and all contributors)##\n\n##purple|But yeah, Vanguard is already an “alternate universe” version of the SCP Foundation, so it makes perfect sense to be folded in. And VKTM is fitting in any universe where there’s media™️.##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|Well on the one hand it's very easy to make small contributions to pulling this stuff together: find a way to tell a story that's best told using your toys and someone else's toys. I've done that a bunch, and most of the other Metafoundation writers have as well. Pulling it all together on a larger scale, more formally, is something else entirely. It involves actually reading other people's stuff — not something SCP writers are natural experts at doing — but also having bigger projects that can cohere stuff together. SCP-6500: //Inevitable// was a great example, since it's this gigantic thing which relies on the interconnected nature of the universe to work. Ralliston wrote a tale called \"//[[[o4-s-summit|O4's Summit]]]//\" because I don't think he understands how apostrophes work, where he included characters from a wide variety of settings at a pivotal moment to show the scale of the threat going on in his series. It's a combination of these approaches — keeping other people's work in mind on a day-to-day basis, but also working to make some Big Moment pieces that show them all off (we've got one in the works which should be quite special) that makes this uber-setting work.##\n\n##blue|As for choosing which works we want to... work, with, well in one sense it's a desire to catch as many good things in the net as we can. If I think something makes a valuable contribution to the SCP Foundation as an overall setting, I want it to have happened in my headcanon. It's actually been quite easy in that respect, since most of us share some stylistic tendencies and literary interests; we can decide pretty easily if we think something's fun or cool, and after all most stuff written for SCP is fun or cool. And nobody who's come up to us and said \"this looks fun, can I play too\" has been turned away, because at the end of the day it's about broadening your toolset and getting as many neat storytelling devices in your repertoire as possible. People have been using the old lolFoundation characters as stock characters for years and years now, and this is sort of an outgrowth of this. You want to tell a story that needs a mage? Why not grab [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-sinclair Katherine Sinclair] from ihp's //S&C Plastics// canon, or [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/doctor-asheworth Daniel Asheworth] from Ralliston's //From 120's Archives//? You setting a tale in England that needs the Foundation involved? Grigori Karpin already has a whole mythology around Site-91 in the [[[hecatoncheires-cycle-hub|Hecatoncheires Cycle]]]. Any time you don't want or need to be making your own stuff up to fill a niche, there's this whole website full of stuff you can draw on to both make your own work better and increase that sense of connectivity. So... we do that!##\n\n##blue|And to do that, to know how to do that, we do have to read. And support each other.##\n\n##blue|//Which we need to be doing anyway.//##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|\"Fusion\" in our case is really just a gesture of officially stating that those connections are there, that they exist. New connections spring up as a result of that, pushing the stories closer together. That's what we hope to accomplish.##\n\n##green|In terms of how everything is actually sewn together on the in-universe, canonical level, we have a flexible cosmology in place. It separates MetaF's canons into intertwining timelines, or universes, which all coexist by virtue of whatever force you prefer — it can be represented by pataphysics, or by ontokinetics, or magic, or really anything you want. Whatever suits your story the best.##\n\n##green|I would like to strongly infer that the existence of this cosmology is not intended to be a limiting force, it is intended to be a liberating one. Whether or not you choose to dive into Place's maniacal pataphysical theory, or Ralliston's enchanting Multiversal Compass, or any other interpretation, our framework is one that can be stretched, squeezed, pulverized, and remade at your whim. Use it as a tool, do not view it as a restriction.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|Well, fusing disconnected canons isn't really something we're aiming to do. The Megacanon kinda starts from the connections between //S&C Plastics// and //On Guard 43//, which are a couple of the largest canons on-site and share characters, references, events, and elements of tone and style. This is deliberate, and certain other deliberate connections, small or large, can be used to relate things to one another; events relating to the AIAD are implied to be canon (where possible) to the Megacanon because characters and from the //[[[ai-classification-guide|Limited Memory]]]// series are present in //On Guard 43//, for example. The connection to //Deepwell// with //ADMONITION// is also deliberate because I'm heavily inspired by the awesome stuff that's been written for that canon, and I want to explore interpretations like SCP-4755 being the Deepwell-timeline's universal narrative structure, etc.##\n\n##orange|To be clear, not all canons in the Megacanon have Foundations which qualify for being included in the Metafoundation Agreement, and Foundations can lose their membership if they actively show disregard for their timeline's stability.##\n\n**How many authors are working with you on the megacanon right now ? Is the number growing ? Are you satisfied to see that a bunch of other people are invested in this project ?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|Our server itself has, at the time, if i recall correctly, approximately 200 users. I cannot tell you for certain how many people have contributed at least once to the canons that make Metafoundation up, but the number's definitely more than 50, with our \"base contributors\" (by which I mean people that are and have been actively contributing to our canons for a long time) being approximately 18. This -- paired with the fact it's constantly getting bigger -- is incredibly exciting! It's always satisfying when people enjoy what you're doing, but it's even more gratifying when previously total strangers get interested in your major project here on-site. Really motivates you like almost nothing else.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|Oh yeah, just speaking for my projects VKTM has had 16 unique contributors, and //No Return// (not counting for duplicates of VKTM contributors) brings in another 7 unique author contributors, not to mention all the artists and my coauthors on 6500.##\n\n##purple|So, I rather love the huge collaborative spirit of this wider project. It’s at the very heart of why SCP is special. Disparate voices coming together to write about a common setting and universe(s).##\n\n##purple|From the very beginning of our thoughts on 6500, we knew we wanted to make a setting where consequences mattered and the status quo was changed, to inspire new authors to jump in. Similarly, I’ve always welcomed new VKTM authors and tried to help, even going so far as to make images for multiple articles that weren’t my own.## \n\n##purple|The diverse collaboration of //Metafoundation// is at the core of what I love about this fiction website inspired by the peanut.##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|It's immensely satisfying. It's one thing to sit back and be pleased at how well all this stuff knits together, but it's something else entirely to see all these people taking it up. First it was people I talk to every day making sly references and occasional uses of other people's stuff, almost little tributes to our friendship and how well the products of our writing gel, and then it was friends from farther afield doing it, and then Liryn was putting in the work to formalize this as a setting and create a Discord server for anyone interested — which is when the project really took off as A Thing — and we started coming up with projects that were //Metafoundation// at their core. And now we've got tons of people chatting in that server every day, and all these interconnected works in the pipe, and honestly it's just so energizing to see that people are interested in sharing a world with us.##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|It's certainly amazing to see that we're already carrying a lot of momentum, even before anything official goes up on the site. We hope that, when things are in full throttle, we'll see an unprecedented spike in contribution and collaboration.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|Yeah, it's super cool that so many people are contributing to this connected universe and I'm excited to see how this type of content expands in the future! I find collaboration really fulfilling and good for developing more varied writing skills.##\n\n**What is the thing related to the canon that you are the most proud of?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|I think it would either be the completion of my series set in //From 120's Archives//, //[[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|And Every Time We Meet Again]]]//, or the posting of my 001 Proposal, //[[[ralliston-s-proposal|The Queen's Gambit]]]//. I've poured my heart into both of them like almost no other project and they both embody what I love most about the SCP universe -- crafting large, expansive, and connected narratives. The completion of both of these projects took significant time and effort and, when they were finally done, really made me feel like they put together everything I've been working on in my early days. And the fact both of them were major milestones when it came to F120A as a whole and its validity as a canon helped a lot, too.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|I’m incredibly proud of VKTM as a whole, and numerous articles I’ve done and others have done for the GOI. The fact that it’s resonated so much with the audience is incredibly touching, because I’ve always wanted to write things that were socially conscious while still being absurd and unsettling.##\n\n##purple|But also, Vanguard is basically the thing I’ve been building towards writing since I joined SCP. I’ve always had significant problems with the idea of the global conspiracy that the Foundation represents in universe... and instead of trying to utilize a resurgence of Chaos Insurgency, I got to help create Vanguard with my 6500 coauthors (mostly Placeholder and HarryBlank) where we can directly address how we might like to see the Foundation respond to the world in a more optimistic and responsible way... plus redoing old stories in a new light like my Clef and Karcist Varis tales in that canon.##\n\n##purple|Writing [[[SCP-6500]]] was a dream, and we’ve extended it out into a whole setting for people to play with, and I’m not done exploring this new era for the Foundation, not by a long shot. //Inevitable// is both our love letter to everything on the wiki but also a chance to address serious issues with the fictional universe itself.##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|There's been a proliferation of memes and a whole heap of fanart (I prefer to be a shit-eating neologist and call it 'friendart' because the idea that I have 'fans' triggers my academic impostor syndrome so badly that I need to sit down — which, luckily, I almost always am already) created by people who're interested in what we're doing, and that just makes me so pleased. It's validating to see that someone has taken some form of inspiration from what you're doing, and that they want to create work based on it, and that they want to show it to other people and get them interested. That's the same sense of community which makes the //Metafoundation// project itself so satisfying. We want to show each other off, and created entertaining derivatives of the stuff we like. I'll never stop being grateful for the excellent readers, writers and artists that make up the SCP community.##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|I think //On Guard 43// is the guiding force of this project. Harry's world, his characters, his stories, are all incredibly alive, and exceptionally memorable. OG43 has contributed immensely to //Metafoundation//’ structural integrity, and continues to be the \"poster-child\" of the project.##\n\n##green|Above all, I'm proud of the connections it has managed to create.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|Out of the works I've helped contribute to the Megacanon, I'd say I'm most proud of SCP-6500. It's emblematic of the type of both in-universe and out-of-universe scale I personally want to strive for in much of my writing, and it has connected with many people in a way I had not at all anticipated. I had such a blast working on that project and, while weaving together disparate lore elements was already part of my style, I learned a lot about writing with others (since each of my coauthors had their own distinct style and were fantastic contributors).##\n\n**And finally, what are your hopes and your goals for the future of Metafoundation?**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|One that comes to mind first is writing more articles for more topics, groups, and canons -- there's only so much of an expansive world you can craft or explore with one piece, so in the future, I'm really hoping to explore some grounds I previously hadn't. Things like GoI Formats for more obscure groups or tales set in not obvious time periods, that's what I'm after. With most stories here on the Wiki being focused on, well, the Foundation, and set in modern times, I really do think what I mentioned can bring something new and exciting to the table, and it would definitely prove an interesting challenge for myself. Another thing is, of course, hoping to see even more people interested in both reading and contributing to the entire project. Like I mentioned, the number of people already invested is incredible and really exciting, but I'm hoping we can expand even more through the various and diverse topics I'm hoping to touch on in the near future, so that everyone can find something they are into in //Metafoundation//.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|Mostly, I hope we get more contributors, both are designed to inspire a variety of stories/articles. And there’s just so much left we could see done with VKTM and Vanguard, I’m excited to see new people come in and get inspired by them.##\n\n##purple|Specifically, I want to either see or be involved with a video VKTM article at some point, and I’m teaching myself video editing just for that reason... but a more impressive visual mind than myself tackling the weird satire/horror of VKTM is a dream come true for me.##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|I hope we help people to find cool and interesting works they wouldn't otherwise see; those of us who have a higher profile ought to be using it to show off the things that have fallen through the cracks. I hope we get people inspired to write more and deeper connected narratives; there will always be a place for one-offs, and works with no entry requirement at all will always appeal to casual readers, but for me the real joy in writing is seeing things get more nuanced, more varied, and building up to something with more emotional and dramatic resonance. I hope, at the end of the day, we've created a body of work which can be enjoyed in individual portions but fallen in love with as a big ol' complex messy whole. Above all else, I hope everyone has fun, feels validated, gets their work read, and builds relationships. Between authors, between artists, between readers, between all of them together, everybody working to make something greater than the sum of its parts. What else is collaborative fiction for?##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|My hopes, though grand in scale, are that //Metafoundation// and structures like it inspire a new direction for connected stories on the wiki, and lead us to a richer, more intricately-linked set of worlds.\nI think a big part of this would involve the creation of new, equally diverse megacanons. Go wild! Link up your stories. Work together to make the future a collaborative one.##\n\n**Placeholder:** ##orange|I hope the projects we have planned for the Metafoundation are ultimately fun and interesting to read, and that they inspire many more collaborators to write interesting stuff for the SCP Wiki. I'm excited to work with a lot of authors who inspired me to write for the site in the first place, and tell stories that pay homage to the works they and others have written for the SCPverse over the years.##\n\n**Well, great! Now, if you have one last thing to say, people to shout-out, anything, the mic is still on, the floor is yours!**\n\n**Ralliston:** ##red|Never got an official chance to say this, but I simply wanted to say thank you to my incredible friends who have made my canon and the entirety of the Metafoundation project even possible. The amazing people like you are what keeps me wanting to come back to the Wiki every day and write even more. You are what pushes me forward through almost every day here on-site and I truly couldn't have asked for any better companions. Thank you, friends, because I just simply wouldn't be here without you and your continued support.##\n\n**Grigori:** ##purple|Listen to Simply Creative People, HarryBlank’s and my podcast, doing deep dives into in-fiction lore and IRL history of writing on the wiki, with loads of author guests. [[[simply-creative-people-hub|Here’s the hub]]] (Sorry, gotta promote whenever possible! Haha).##\n\n**Harry:** ##blue|Oh god, oh god, uh…##\n\n##blue|Big thanks to everyone who reads SCP, you make all this possible! And thanks to everyone who's shoving this project forward despite my sloth and ineptitude! Listen to Simply Creative People, the podcast about Grigori Karpin trying to talk about SCP and HarryBlank opening Coke cans so you can't hear him! I'm finishing a sprawling SCP novel called //Bury the Survivors// very soon! Thanks for the interview! Exclamation points.##\n\n##blue|Huzzah!##\n\n**Liryn:** ##green|Go read everything by HarryBlank.
