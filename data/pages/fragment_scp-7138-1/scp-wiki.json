On at least one occasion, exposure to SCP-7138 has caused subjects to self-mutilate and remove their own eyes. \nSCP-7138 does not emit any thaumic radiation, nor are its effects hampered by Scranton reality anchors.##\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7138 came to the Foundation’s attention during an investigation into the deaths of several suspected members of AWCY (designated subjects 7138-A through C) during a \"twenty-four-hour art contest\". ##blue|Interviews with 7138-C indicate that they may not have intended to create SCP-7138.##\n\n**Supplementary Documents:**\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Research Log Transcripts\" hide=\"- Close Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Log 7138-1**\n-----\n**Dr. Montgomery:** Okie Dokie. This is log entry number one for research into SCP-7138. Results so far have been... inconclusive, to say the least.\n\n[Papers shuffle]\n\nSCP-7138 isn't like any other AWCY anomaly I've encountered, and as far as we can tell, it's not memetic. So there goes my best guess out the window. None of the D-class that have been exposed to SCP-7138 have done anything like gouging out their eyes. They just sit around, reporting feelings of \"anxiety\" and \"nervousness\". Hardly anything to work with.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume there's some kind of criteria that has to be met before SCP-7138 displays its full abilities, but what that criteria is, I have no idea. I have some tests in mind, though. Hopefully one of them will give me some clues.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Log 7138-2**\n-----\n**Dr. Montgomery:** Alright, this is the second log for SCP-7138 research. Yesterday, a D-class exposed to SCP-7138 went crazy and plucked out their eyes, making them Subject 7138-D. So yay! Case Closed!\n\n[Sighs] \n\nI wish. We still have no idea what SCP-7138 actually did, or how it did it. That guy was locked in a room with SCP-7138 for two whole days. Heck, if I had to stare at that painting for two days, I'd probably want to go blind. \n\nAll this proves is that there is something to SCP-7138. Something makes it act the way it does. Something will make all of this make sense. But I have no idea what that something could be.\n\nHonestly, I'm running out of ideas for tests to run on this thing. I feel like I'm just throwing stuff at it to see what sticks.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Log 7138-3**\n-----\n[Approximately five minutes of shuffling expunged.]\n**Dr. Montgomery:** Well, this is the... third? fourth? SCP-7138 research log, and I'm still staring at a stupid painting trying to figure out what the heck makes it tick.\n\n[Significant silence]\n\nCarl called the other day. Said he wanted an update on my progress. It was more than that, though. He'd seen my experiment proposals. He was checking in to make sure I'm still sane.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nI don't blame him. What does he expect? I'm at the end of my rope, trying to figure out an SCP that just doesn't make sense! It's impossible! Anyone who actually experiences it goes insane, and everyone else just sees some weird magenta shapes on a piece of canvas! Where's the sense in that? How does it do it? Who knows?\n\n[A shaky breath can be heard]\n\nNo. It has to make sense. I know it does. Everything makes sense, if you strip away the fluff. It's no different here. There is a truth in SCP-7138, under that stupid magenta paint. A truth that will make this whole thing click. And I'm going to find that truth.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Rejected SCP-7138 Experiment Proposals \" hide=\"- Close Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n****\n------\n|| Number || Proposed Procedure || Reason for Rejection ||\n|| 7138-2a || SCP-7138 will be exposed to radiation from Site ██’s nuclear reactor. || No reason for the necessity of radiation exposure provided. ||\n|| 7138-2b || SCP-7138 will be exposed to [[[SCP-079]]]. || No reason for cross testing of SCPs provided. ||\n|| 7138-2d || SCP-7138 will be used in a ritual generated by [[[SCP-2105]]] || No reason for cross testing of SCPs provided. ||\n|| 7138-2c || SCP-7138 will be flown to Lagrange point five and tested in a zero-gravity environment. ||  Monty, I get that you’re looking for a new angle, but there’s nothing to indicate that this anomaly’s space-related. ||\n|| 7138-2e || SCP-7138 will be presented with a blood offering taken from D-class scheduled for termination. || No. ||\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\nA newer version of this document has been detected.\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7138/offset/2|VIEW NEXT ITERATION]]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
