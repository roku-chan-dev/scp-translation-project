Hell may be full of weeping and gnashing of teeth, but if you left hell, your eyes would dry.

You think that's very clever, don't you? I'm not impressed. Metafiction is the last resort of the creatively bankrupt. If you had a better written character you might be able to pull this off, but \"The Dentalist\"? You're not even trying. There's a difference between absurdism and the laughable.\n\nDenied. Take some time off, look at some real art.
