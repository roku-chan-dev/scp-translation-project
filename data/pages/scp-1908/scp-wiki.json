It will be provided 40 grams of soap flakes a day for sustenance. As per current regulations regarding \"Mister\" anomalies, the anomaly's cell has been situated in Hall 34-B of [[[secure-facilities-locations | Site-55]]].\n\nMedia may not be brought into contact with SCP-1908 without the approval of Dr. Everwood. Newly obtained SCP-1908-B and SCP-1908-C instances are to be examined and transcribed by NOUS.AIC, then stored in Site-55's anomalous media archive. Direct viewing of SCP-1908-B and SCP-1908-C instances is strictly prohibited.\n\nCleaning staff are restricted from entering SCP-1908's containment cell; it has been allowed to maintain the cleanliness of its space. If SCP-1908 is observed to become especially discontent, up to 1 kilogram of dirt is to be dispersed about its cell for enrichment purposes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1908 is a sapient mass of opaque, white-blue soap water that is approximately 190 liters in volume. The anomaly can locomote by rolling itself across the ground in a roughly spherical mass, though maintaining this shape appears to be particularly taxing. Consequently, SCP-1908 generally prefers to remain stationary within an appropriately-sized container.\n\nTo interact with its environment in more complex manners, SCP-1908 will partially coalesce itself into portions of human anatomy (SCP-1908-A). When the anomaly is not consciously exerting control over SCP-1908-A, particularly during its regular periods of dormancy, instances will manifest and demanifest at random intervals. Upon being questioned about this phenomenon, SCP-1908 displayed significant frustration with its inability to fully regulate its own body.\n\nApproximately 5% of SCP-1908-A instances generate with a tattoo printed somewhere on their surface, each being a variation of the words: \"Mr. Bath, from Little Misters Â® by Dr. Wondertainment\". In 85% of all noted tattoo manifestations, the name \"Mr. Bath\" was replaced by \"Mr. Wash\", \"Mr. Scrub\", \"Mr. Water\", \"Mr. Kleen\" [sic], \"Mr. Bubble\", or \"Mr. No-More-Dirt\". At no point has any variation of \"Mr. Soap\" been observed on an SCP-1908-A instance.\n\nThe anomaly was first discovered when it appeared at Site-55's primary entrance within an ornate clawfoot bathtub emblazoned with Dr. Wondertainment's logo. SCP-1908-C-01 was subsequently found floating within SCP-1908.\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ **ADDENDUM 1908-1**\n+++ **MEDIA ALTERATION**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\nAdult-oriented media that comes into physical contact with SCP-1908 becomes an SCP-1908-B instance. SCP-1908-B instances lack any form of mature language, violence, or bloodshed, regardless of original subject matter. Their tone is lighthearted and upbeat, with conflicts that are primarily resolved by usage of Dr. Wondertainment-brand products.

A majority of the film's runtime is devoted to a series of slapstick pranks that Danny Torrance plays on his father with the aid of the spirits of the Overlook Hotel, who are portrayed as 2D animation \"bedsheet ghosts.\"\n\nDuring the famous \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, Wendy Torrance abruptly turns away from the typewriter to look directly into the camera. She proceeds to praise the \"[[[scp-445 | super paper]]]\" that Jack Torrance had been typing on, describing its many favorable traits for several minutes.\n\nThe film ends with the Torrance family celebrating Christmas together, in which they receive various Dr. Wondertainment-brand gifts.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nChild-oriented media that contacts SCP-1908 becomes an SCP-1908-C instance.
