HUMINT previously gathered from the area establishes:\n> 3.1. Transient foreign community in Cherinmark remains agitated after the deaths of several adventuring parties within its borders (outside areas historically recognized as dungeons, lairs, or delving zones)\n> \n> 3.2. Communities bordering Cherinmark also agitated over deaths. Local investigators have yet to identify motive or suspects \n> \n> 3.3.

At the Master of Whispers' request, drakes are dispatched from Aerie #10 on 3/4/901 to gather information without activating national assets. Overflight of the Peliogar and Ultigar border regions reveals no unusual activity, amulets detect no unusual energies\n\n5. Drakes again dispatched on 3/5/901 to survey territories including Cherinmark (denial zone penetration not authorized). Riders observe deforestation around three unregistered silos and note paths leading deeper into neutral territory\n\n6. Royal agents determine on 3/6/901 that a buried hanger built to store at least 50 {{{POSTURE 12 TOPIC}}} was not reported in violation of disarmament treaties\n\n**FURTHER ACTION:**\n__Preference:__ If, in her wisdom, in her ineffable grace, Her Immortal Majesty seeks to ascertain where these hidden weapons of war have been delivered and for what purpose, there could be no swifter means than dispatching deniable MIDAR teams into Cherinmark under the guise of \"adventurers seeking a peerless blade.\" Several score should be undetectable within the influx currently underway, and would provide a contact surface with transient communities as well as agents of those poxed claimants to inferior crowns.\n\n__Alternate:__ If instead seeking to display what might resides within the Saltmade Throne, to humble worms yet crawling, Her Immortal Majesty might be advised to dispatch the fifth and sixth royal battalions for peacekeeping operations in tandem with a more thorough search. This is permitted under standing treaties for a period of no more than 90 days, although objections are likely to rise before that cutoff—wasted paper when lodged in our Sovereign's light. \n\n__Not favored:__ Inaction (although, as but humble subjects, wandering blind through the night of royal affairs, we could not hope to understand the fullness of Her Immortal Majesty's decisions or judge their wisdom without first donning jester's garb).\n[[=]]\n**POSTURE 6 || UNLIT INCANT**\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size:90%;\"]]**<< [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/as-bruises-linger-and-munitions-molder Previous Tale] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/swords-unto-scramjets Swords unto Scramjets] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sodium-deficiency-pacing-problems Next Tale] >>**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
