Footage captured by MTF Iota-3 (\"Neighbourhood Watch\") on 15/07/2021.]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-6609 is not currently in Foundation containment. Mobile Task Force Iota-3 (\"Neighbourhood Watch\") is to maintain surveillance on PoI:S_1182 and SCP-6609 to determine the extent of his anomalous properties in preparation for their potential detainment.  \n\n**Description:** SCP-6609 is the physical body of Sid. G Haworth. SCP-6609 is mobile and displays signs of sentience and sapience analogous to a baseline human, despite SCP-6609's brain existing in a comatose state.[[footnote]] As of 02/08/2021, SCP-6609's brain is no longer in a comatose state; this has had no effect on the anomalous properties of SCP-6609. See Addendum MR3—22/08/2021 for additional information.[[/footnote]] \n\n**Discovery:** On 23/07/2021, SCP-6609 became animate, having previously been in an unresponsive, immobile, comatose state following an automobile collision. This occurred despite no noticeable change in SCP-6609's brain activity, which scans indicated remained unresponsive to stimuli. Hospital staff recorded this occurrence and a Foundation .aic[[footnote]] Artificially Intelligent Conscript. [[/footnote]] embedded within the provincial healthcare's digital systems flagged the event as a potential anomaly. On 05/08/2021, SCP-6609 was discharged from the hospital and arrangements were made for weekly visits with Dr. Sarah M. Fultie, a Foundation-employed specialist in anomalies related to the human brain.\n\nPrior to this event PoI:S_1182: \"Violet Newton\" —  SCP-6609's long-term romantic partner — had been placed on passive Foundation surveillance due to her affiliation with the \"VVicked VVitches.\" This self-proclaimed \"coven\" of individuals based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, is suspected to associate with GoI-α-019: The Serpent's Hand. This collective is presumed to be unaware of the Foundation and its operations and has been permitted to operate — under observation — due to its minimal threat to The Veil and the general public. \n\n-----\n**Addendum SR1—14/07/2021:**\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+ Surveillance Report - 14/07/2021\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Subject(s) of Interest:** PoI:S_118 — Violet Newton\n\n**Date & Time:** 14/07/2021 - 9:41 pm. \n\n**Location:** 5█32 █████ St., Halifax, Nova Scotia. \n\n**Camera and/or Microphone Position:** L1: Livingroom\n-----\n\n//At 9:41 pm PoI:S_1182's electronically bugged cellphone begins ringing.

The caller is identified as Elton Haworth, the father of SCP-6609.//\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Hey, it's Violet. Is everything alright?\n\n**Elton Haworth:** Hi Violet, I'm sorry to call so late. Martha's gone to bed but I couldn't seem to rest. I meant to call earlier, but I've lost track of time. I, uh, well how are you?\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Pretty awful, if I'm being honest. \n\n**Elton Haworth:** Yeah. Listen, I just wanted to thank you — \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Oh, Elton there's really no need to that.\n\n**Elton Haworth:** I know, but I just needed to say. \n\n//Pause.//\n\n**Elton Haworth:** When we got that call about what happened to Sid, I don't know, Martha and I were distraught. I was trying to drive us to the hospital and the whole way there, shit maybe this isn't right to say, I was just thinking about what it must have been like, right before it happened. God, it's a miracle we made it to the hospital at all, us worrying the whole way there 'bout our boy and all. \n\n**Elton Haworth:** When we made it into the room, seeing you there with him, made it a little bit better. Here we were, his parents, hours away driving through the night. And I just, I wanted to thank you, thank you for being there. I know it sounds stupid, and I know of course you would have been. But times like these, well they remind you of the past. Knowing Sid's got you there for him as well, it means a heck of a lot. You've always been family to us, you know? Ever since that lanky teenager brought you round to meet us. We really care, love you both, and I don't just mean 'cause you're with Sid. You're an amazing person, Violet. \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Oh, Elton //[Pause. The speaker is noticeably choked up]// I'm not sure what to say. It was awful being there, watching him be wheeled into one room and another. God I — I'm sorry, I must seem so out of it. Thank you. \n\n**Elton Haworth:** Please, there's nothing to apologize for, nothing at all. I should be getting to bed. I'm sure I mentioned that Martha and I are staying at the Johnson's. They wanted me to invite you over for dinner this weekend, if that works for you? Obviously, there's no pressure. \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** I think, I think I'd really like that. Yeah, that sounds lovely. How about you get to bed and I'll call you back tomorrow. Would that be fine, Elton?\n\n**Elton Haworth:** Of course! Goodnight Violet. Be sure to get some rest as well.\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** I will, and thank you again. Goodnight.\n\n//PoI:S_1182 sets the phone down and remains still for a minute before sitting in an armchair.

Fultie, who was assigned to SCP-6609 following the atypical nature of the subject's recovery from his comatose state. \n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Medical Report Concerning SCP-6609: 05/08/2021\n[[/=]]\n-----\n@@ @@\nI was first assigned to SCP-6609 on August 5^^th^^. As per my usual approach when encountering nonhazardous, nonhostile, humanoid anomalies related to my area of study, I did not read the entirety of SCP-6609's file prior to meeting him. I have found too much background knowledge can obscure my ability to intuit ways anomalous influences may affect and manifest in the human brain and subtly influence a person's behaviour. \n\nAs such, I can say confidently that before conducting any equipment-assisted tests, I did not notice any behavioural difference that would distinguish SCP-6609 from a typical, baseline human. The subject was conversational, remembered details of his life pre-accident, and behaved in a rational manner. He was grateful for our help, thankful that he was permitted visitors, and eager to be released from the hospital; I hope that I, had I been in his place, would have acted in much the same way. \n\nI was genuinely surprised to learn, after having concluded my initial assessment of SCP-6609 and thoroughly examined the assorted reports prepared for me, that all testing indicates his brain is unchanged from its comatose state. Subsequent tests on the subject's cerebrum and cerebellum confirmed the initial diagnosis is correct. As SCP-6609 appears capable of functioning as a completely normal human being despite its anomalous properties — of which it appears ignorant, I have approved SCP-6609's discharge from the hospital and arranged weekly appointments for continued study and observation. \n\nIt is my understanding that my colleagues are investigating the possibility that a thaumaturgic ritual employed by PoI: S_1182 or other anomalous influence is responsible for SCP-6609's current condition. While I cannot speculate on the validity of these hypotheses, I can acknowledge that I have not, thus far, come across any causal indicators behind this event. \n\nSarah Fultie, MD,\n[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-184|Site-184]]] Research Chair & Medical Practitioner.\n[[/div]] \n-----\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum SR2—05/08/2021:**\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+ Surveillance Report - 05/08/2021\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Subject(s) of Interest:** SCP-6609 — Sid Haworth & PoI:S_118 — Violet Newton.\n\n**Date & Time:** 05/08/2021 - 7:42 pm. \n\n**Location:** 5█32 █████ St., Halifax, Nova Scotia. \n\n**Camera and/or Microphone Position:** D3: Dining Room\n-----\n//SCP-6609 and PoI:S_1182 sit at the dining room table.

Barring medical examination of the subject's brain, SCP-6609 is functionally indistinguishable from an average person. \n> \n> Additionally, the individual appears to retain comprehensive memories of his life prior to the accident and persons familiar with SCP-6609 have declared no noticeable alteration in his behaviour, mannerisms, or actions. \n> \n> As such, I believe SCP-6609 does not present a threat to normality, public safety, or the operations of the SCP Foundation. While I advocate for the continued observance of SCP-6609, detainment of the individual is neither necessary nor advisable.\n\nSince this prior report, a recent change in SCP-6609's brain activity has prompted me to rethink my understanding of this anomaly: SCP-6609's brain has resumed its full range of activity and appears to respond to stimuli. However, it does so in a way that fundamentally //does not correspond// to the actions undertaken by SCP-6609, his verbal responses to prompts and questions, and the apparent emotional state of the subject. \n\nFor example, when performing simple physical tasks, scans of SCP-6609's brain indicate activity within lobes that do not correspond to the respective actions. Such scans furthermore suggest that SCP-6609's frontal lobe is extremely agitated, indicating distress, although SCP-6609 appears outwardly calm and claims to be relaxed. Additionally, SCP-6609 does not express any discomfort due to headaches or other physiological symptoms. \n\nI am hereby requisitioning a set of programmable Elisa-Cartes Memetic Agents[[footnote]] Used to assess consciousness and sapience, these memetic agents encode predetermined messages comprehensible to the human brain in visually chaotic forms, primarily consisting of intersecting lines.

While the specifics of the experience were unsettling, the experiment showed that the consciousness of SCP-6609 is not in direct control of their body. Additionally, it would seem to suggest that the entity responsible for SCP-6609's ability to interact with the world physically and process and respond to information is both aware of the initial consciousness and, itself, capable of distinguishing itself from it. \n\nWhile the first session was, admittedly, not as productive as I would have hoped, I believe with future tetherings of my and SCP-6609's consciousness, we may be able to uncover the cause of this event, and if so, \n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum SR5—05/09/2021:**\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+ Surveillance Report - 05/09/2021\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Subject(s) of Interest:**  SCP-6609 — Sid Haworth & PoI:S_1182 — Violet Newton.\n\n**Date & Time:** 05/09/2021 - 10:41 pm. \n\n**Location:** 5█32 █████ St., Halifax, Nova Scotia. \n\n**Camera and/or Microphone Position:** L1: Livingroom; M1: MTF Iota-3 \n-----\n//SCP-6609 sits in the living room, in a hunched-over position.

You haven't really spoken to me at all since getting home \n\n**SCP-6609:** I've just been distracted. I'm sorry. \n\n**PoI:S_1182** No, it's okay, really. \n\n//Pause//\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** So I was reading through emails, and I saw one from Dr. Fultie. She wanted to speak about some other healthcare options. There's apparently a clinic she's aware of that's doing some cutting-edge work on coma recovery. It's out of town so we'd need to stay for a few nights, but I think this could be really good for us. \n\n**SCP-6609:** I'm fine. Really.\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Sid, I'm saying this because I love you, okay? But you really don't seem fine. You've been jumpy and out of it the last few weeks. I'm not trying to rush you into things, but you've blown off meeting up with Chris[[footnote]] A known previously close associate of SCP-6609 pre-collision. [[/footnote]], what 3 times? This just, this isn't like you, Sid.\n\n**SCP-6609:** I can't do it, okay? I can't go there. \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Why not? If you're scared we can talk about it beforehand and they said I'd be welcome to come with you. \n\n**SCP-6609:** They'll take me away! I saw it, I could tell what she wanted. She was in there. \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Who's going to take you away? What are you talking about, Sid?\n\n**SCP-6609:** I won't go. I refuse. I'm here and I'm not going. I need to stay. I saw what she wanted and I won't let it happen. \n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Sid, you're scaring me. What's wrong?\n\n**SCP-6609:** I'm fine. Just, I need a minute, okay?\n\n**PoI:S_1182:** Alright, but I'll just be in the other room. \n\n//PoI:S_1182 moves to give SCP-6609 a hug, who hesitates before reciprocating. As she leaves the room SCP-6609 remains motionless on the chair, before quickly grabbing something from the nearby table and bolting to the front door.//\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n//SCP-6609 is seen rapidly exiting the front doorway of the townhouse, holding a series of unidentified objects in his right hand. The individual pauses on the front lawn before running down the street. Members of  MTF Iota-3 (\"Neighbourhood Watch\")'s surveillance detail assigned to SCP-6609 on-location are given permission to pursue from a distance, but not directly engage SCP-6609 unless in immediate danger. Additional personnel are placed on standby to aid in the detainment of SCP-6609 and PoI:S_118 if necessary.// \n\n//Iota-3-A and -B are advised to follow on-foot.

I just saw him, he ducked into the backyard up ahead.\n\n**Iota-3-A:** Jesus, okay. Hang back a bit, we don't want him seeing us.\n\n@@ @@\n//Iota-3-A and -B turn the corner. On-person cameras capture SCP-6609 scaling a waist-high chainlink fence and entering a small forested ravine on the other side of the property. Permission to use electronic stuns guns to subdue the suspect is given. Iota-3-A and -B proceed to progress over the fence and into the wooded area.//\n@@ @@\n\n**Iota-3-A:** Shit, it got dark in here. You got a flashlight with you, I left mine in the van. \n\n**Iota-3-B:** Yeah, here we go.

Command, the subject appears to be wounded. We need medical evacuation ASAP. \n\n//The flashlight swings over SCP-6609, partially illuminating the subject's body. The individual's legs and footwear are caked in layers of mud, and the shirt appears to be stained; as the light moves upwards this staining is revealed to be a large quantity of dried blood, which progressively gets heavier towards the subject's neck and head. The individual appears unconscious and unresponsive to Iota-3-B's presence. SCP-6609 is revealed to have two wooden objects embedded within its head: one emerges from the right nostril and the other appears to have been inserted beneath the eye. One of SCP-6609's hands sways limply at its side while the other grasps the end of the object protruding from the subjects eye.//\n\n//A medical team dispatched to the location manages to confirm the entity is alive and undertakes transportation to Site-184's trauma response center.//\n\n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum: Containment & Reclassification of SCP-6609**\nFollowing the recovery of SCP-6609, medical examination indicated that the inserted objects, a pair of knitting needles, managed to severely damage the individual's cerebellum and primary motor cortex — areas of the brain predominately associated with muscle movement and intentional body control. Damage to other parts of the subject's cerebrum appears to be superficial and nonintrusive towards regular brain activity. \n\nFollowing a rehabilitation period of 5 days, SCP-6609 was recovered enough to resume basic locomotion. The subject has shown a disinterest in conversing with Foundation personnel. Routine scans of SCP-6609's brain indicate signs of agitation and distress, but no unusual physical behaviours have been observed.\n\nSCP-6609 has been formally taken into Foundation containment; Object Class and updated Special Containment Procedures are pending review and approval. \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6608]]] | SCP-6609 | [[[SCP-6610]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** house.jpg\n> **Name:** house\n> **Author:** Chris Lott\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/fncll/8757745/in/photostream/\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
