You probably know me as \"That guy who never posts anything\" or \"Who?\" \n\nAnyway, if you're here, it's probably because you read some of my work, and enjoyed it enough to see more! --...or you want to leave a scathing review about my historical inaccuracies, of which there are many.--\n\nWhatever reason you're here, I hope you enjoy my work! \n\n##transparent|Also if you're here from the SCPD discord, and are wondering \"Hey, doesn't he have more stuff than this?\", that's because I create (And post onto discord) about 6 good ideas for every 1 I actually write. Let's just say I have a HELL of a writing backlog I've been meaning to get to...##\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\n**[[[SCP-6091]]]:** It is World War 2. All is not quiet on the Eastern front. But it will be. \n\n[[collapsible show=\" ► A more informative summary\" hide=\" ▼ Close\"]]\nA series of documents detailing clashes between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Your typical Obskuracorps story where Nazis meddle in things beyond their comprehension...only this time it's not from the Nazi perspective.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tales]]\n**[[[PSA Cognitohazards and You!]]]** You know Broken Masquerade? Where the world wakes up to the anomalous insanity around it? Have you heard about the \"Duck, and Cover!\" PSA's from the Cold War that heavily imply that a picnic blanket can shield you from the radioactive output of a nuclear detonation? \n\nTake a wild guess what we wrote here. :)\n\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Author's Opinions\" hide=\" ▼ Close\"]]\nOkay, all the things I write are fun, that's why I write them, but this one was REALLY fun. I just loved going to town on \"How would I make this as unsettling, but believable, as possible?\" \n\nAlso, Jack Waltz's comment is 100% correct when he said \"Skippie do be looking kinda cute though.\"\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[The Generally Uncomfortable Laboratory Adolescents Group]]]:** The Foundation has, quite frankly, a disturbing number of teenagers in their care. A short story about some of them meeting. \n\n(Recommend reading [[[SCP-3009]]]/the accompanying tales, and [[[SCP-105]]]/Resurrection Hub if you want the full emotional heft of this)\n\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Author's Opinions\" hide=\" ▼ Close\"]]\nI 100% rushed this out because I wanted the \"author\" tag on the SCPD discord server. It's not bad enough that I entirely hate it, but I fully intend on doing a small rewrite at some point in the future.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
