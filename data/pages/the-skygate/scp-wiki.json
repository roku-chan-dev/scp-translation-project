  "content": "I went through the Skygate. It's called a Skygate. But it doesn't sit in the sky. It's a weird White, Orange, Green, and Yellow portal. \n\nYou fall from a height into the land. But when you hit the ground you expect to splat like a pancake. But you just hit the ground. And you're fine.\n \nI found the towers. He's not here. He promised he'd be here. Footsteps to the top. There is no normal anymore.\n \nFloor 23. My head is pounding. I saw something. It was too fast to make out. It wasn't human. They're looking for me. I can feel it. Time is running out. I'm going to find the well. Life goes on. Without me. There's no turning back. I know that.\n \nI made it to the top. I know how to get to the well. I have to jump. 109 stories. I won't die. I never die. This shouldn't be any different. He's still alive. He leaves notes. I saw it again. It jumped. I'm going to follow it.\n \nI'm leaving notes for myself. I found one of his notes. I'll put it in this journal. If you find it. You'll find me. And hopefully. Him.\n> 01/23/2016 - Log 2\n> \n> I jumped, and I fell through the floor. I've never been here before so it took me a second to figure out what to do. I'm lost in this weird ass town. It's got no streetlights, no cars, no human indication, the houses and buildings are in pristine condition, why did they leave, I'm going to figure it out. I brought things to me, a flashlight, some duck tape, my phone, it's almost dead, i'm guessing there are no outlets that work in here, and i brought some paper, when my phone runs out of battery I'll start making paper notes, I've already started, to conserve battery. It's getting dark, I'm going to find somewhere to sleep.\n> \n> - Subject 3243\n \nI found a patch of flowers. They remind me of who I was before. Before all of this. Before they became subjects. I found an MP3 played with a note attached to it. But it wasnt him. It was something else. I'll add it here. There's one song on the MP3. I'm going to listen to it. It's labeled \"Mice on Venus\" I'm not sure what it means. But I'm sure I'll find out.\n\n> Dear, Subject 4,\n> \n> I've left this MP3 player for you. It's got your favorite song. I hope you enjoy it. Goodbye friend. I never got your name, but mine was Alisha.\n> \n> - Alisha (Subject 10)\n \nIf I don't find him soon. I will find his body. In the snow. Blue and cold. Either frozen. Or killed. According to this note I found. He's going for an exit. I must find it. And destroy it. Before he find it. He is in danger. He just isn't aware of it yet.\n\n> ??/??/2016? - Log 14\n> \n> I've lost track of time. My phone died. I found a watch tower outside the town an dI climbed up it. This motherfucking hell scape goes on for thousands of miles, I can't even see the end, just grass and farm fields. I did however find a car, it's got some gas in it, about half a tank. I'm pretty sure the overseers gave it to me. I'll write when either, I run out of gas, or when I find a spot to fill up.\n> \n> -Subject 3243\n \nThe overseers don't normally give us equipment. I should probably tell you my name. It used to be Liam. Now they call me; Subject 1. I've been here before. At least 26 times. They keep bringing me back. Should never have said yes. I built the Skygate. They had me test it. And left me to rot. The final levels are painful and terribly difficult. He won't make it past the Winters. Other Subjects have left rules for the Entities. Based on his logs, I don't think he found them. Let's hope he does.\n \nI found a corner store. It was run by a Spring. I got food and water for free. It just said it was on the house. I wasn't sure if it meant //The House// of the corner store. If it was //The House// then I'm in for a treat. I think the overseers are helping us because they haven't see the final levels since I made it there. I'm close to the town. So far I've seen one subject. Their Hazmat Suit said 'Subject 3564.' They weren't alive. They belonged to the Summers. I left it alone. The Summers don't like people rummaging through their stuff.\n \n> To whom it may concern,\n> \n> You have found a rule book. This world is not what you think it is. You found a Skygate. And were either pulled through or decided to walk through. \n> \n> In this place there are entities that have rules that you must oblige by or you will not make it. The rules are as follows:\n> \n> The Summers: We have no idea what happens during this season. Or how to deal with it's entities, but not to worry as long as it isn't Summer you should be fine because The Summers don't come out during other seasons. But if you do come across a Summer you must speak in rhymes. If not, something will happen. But we aren't really sure what happens.\n> \n> The Springs: The springs are probably the most kind of the //The Houses.// If you encounter a Spring, you are to not ask questions and not to answer questions they ask you.\n> \n> The Winters: Do not look at The Winters. Do not address The Winters directly. Hide from The Winters. They only know you exist if you address their existence.\n> \n> The Falls: Always speak in the third person. Not much else.\n> \n> Good luck Subject.\n> \n> The Null States: These entities do not exist. Do address them. Pretend they are not there. Look right through them. As soon as you address them, you are as good as dead. You can write about it. You can think about it. But just don't talk about it.\n> \n> Those are //The Houses,// upset them and god bless you, because you gonna need him.\n> \n> - Subject 2\n \nI got out of the town. It was like he wrote. Desolate. Eerie. There was one car. There was a note on it. I included it. It had a full tank. It smelled like a flower bed. A Spring. I read the note. It let me take the car. So I did. I'll write later.\n\n> To help find him.\n> \n> - Overseer 9 via The House of Spring\n \nI made it to a gas station. There was a note on one of the pumps. It was from him. There was also a note from Subject 2. I included them both.\n\n> There was a gas station, with a note, I had found a rule book about the houses earlier, and this note was the same person from before. It told me what was going on. I filled the tank and got out of there. I paid for my gas with a story and a drawing. I think they liked it, I'm not sure.\n> \n> -Subject 3243\n\n> Welcome to //The Somewhere Worse.// Where your nightmares come true. This place is like nothing you ever seen before. This place is different for everybody. Whatever your worst fear is, this place quintuples it. You communicate with other subjects with notes, or if you run into someone you can talk to them verbally, just be aware that they are always listening. There are multiple levels, they get harder and harder as you progress towards the end. It will take you weeks to get out, sometimes months, depending on the season. The people that run this place are called //The Overseers// and the person that created it is called //Subject 1.// This place has been running for 20 years I was the second person to escape from this bloody hell hole. There were 10 of us who escaped out of 25 who were in the first group. The rest are either dead, or still trapped inside. Those of us who escaped keep getting called back in, our families are worried about us. The only way in is by a Skygate, which only gets put in places where //The Overseers// want it, and //**WHO**// they want.\n> \n> Hopefully that explains enough to get you out of here. Good Luck.\n> \n> -Subject 2\n \nI've stopped writing cryptically. Just normally. This place changes a person. Once you get in there is a slim chance you get out. But if you do. Your life will never be the same.\n \nI drove until I found another car. There was a note on it. I don't think I'm going to find him alive. Getting out alive myself will be a problem.\n\n> ??/??/???? - Log 21\n> \n> I ran out of gas, It's getting colder, I think it's becoming Fall. Soon It will be Winter, I don't know how long I'll last in Winter. My hands are getting cold, I can't write very well, my brain is slowly shutting down, I haven't slept a full night since I got in here, which is like 4 weeks. I don't know how far the exit is, or if I'm going to make it to the end. This might be my last log, if so, goodbye. \n> \n> - Subject 3243\n \nI ran into a Winter on the road. I almost looked at it. I had to swerve off the road to miss it. This place really is hell.\n \nI found a pack of gummy worms. They didn't look claimed. I left a story and some water. I hope that was enough. \n\nI found another body. 'Subject 3421.' looked about 25 years old. Young. Too young.\n \nI made it to level 3. Two more and I'm out.\n \nI'm almost out of gas. There's a station up ahead. I hope it's a Autumn. They really don't take much. As long as you stay in the Third-Person. I should be fine.\n \nIt was an Autumn. It's been weeks since I've been on the outside world. I'm getting tired and my writing is showing that. I'm going to try and make it to the end. I'm going to stop writing for a while. I'll let you know if anything interesting happens.\n\nI found him. Not human. Tarrend. Looks like the Springs got him. Subject 3243. Has ended his ride here. I feel bad for him. So close too. I'll put him in the trunk. He deserves a funeral with his family.\n \nNothing interesting has happened so far. More bodies. Subject 3117, Subject 3143, Subject 2890, and others. Just a couple more miles. Then I'm out. Hopefully for good.\n \nI've made it to the end. I'm leaving this journal here, to hopefully mark my journey. And tell my story to anyone who makes it past this here land. Next time I see it. I'm going to destroy it. I've made other notes, taken pictures, and grabbed things from this land to take back to our universe. Life will go on. But soon. Life will go on without this wretched place. I'm going to expose them. I will stop this.\n\nTo anyone who is reading this journal now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you were put through this. And I'm sorry I couldn't help you. But I'm happy you're alive. Take this book with you. Or leave it for the next person. The choice is yours. Godspeed.\n\n- Subject 1\n \n[[collapsible show=\"Message from Author\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nHello. 'Tis I, the least qualified author on this site (Hey, at least I'm trying), I starting writing this tale a few weeks ago (03/01/2025) and just finished it last night (03/14/2025) so the writing styles change a bit from the start and the end. I've done the reviewing parts and all, but if there are any SPaG issues, please point them out. My Dyslexic brain will not be able to find them. I based the entities and world design on Hymns for the Road by Anna Mugire, so if things seem similar, that's where they come from. Anyways, that's really all I wanted to say. Please do not hesitate to give criticism and feedback, I could really use it. Thank you so much for reading, and Happy Travels (and, in my opinion; don't enter The Skygate. It's not worth it). Some SPaG issues are intentional, most of them will be in the notes, other ones are unintentional.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[=]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Dr John Blackwood]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
