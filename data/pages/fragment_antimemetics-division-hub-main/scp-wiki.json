  "content": "An antimeme is //an idea with self-censoring properties//; an idea which, by its intrinsic nature, discourages or prevents people from spreading it.\n\n**Antimemes are real.** Think of any piece of information which you wouldn't share with anybody, like passwords, taboos and dirty secrets. Or any piece of information which would be difficult to share even if you tried: complex equations, very boring passages of text, large blocks of random numbers, and dreams...\n\nBut anomalous antimemes are another matter entirely. How do you contain something you can't record or remember? How do you fight a war against an enemy with effortless, perfect camouflage, when you can never even know that you're at war?\n\nWelcome to the Antimemetics Division.\n\nNo, this is not your first day.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Suggested reading order is from top to bottom.//\n\n++ Critical background reading\n\n* [[[SCP-055]]] by [[[qntm-s-author-page|qntm]]] (first half) and CptBellman (Addendum A onwards)\n\n++ //There Is No Antimemetics Division// by [[[qntm-s-author-page|qntm]]]\n\nThis story is complete.\n\n* [[[we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five|We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five]]]\n* [[[introductory-antimemetics|Introductory Antimemetics]]]\n* [[[unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are|Unforgettable, That's What You Are]]]\n* [[[case-colourless-green|CASE COLOURLESS GREEN]]]\n* [[[your-last-first-day|Your Last First Day]]]\n\n++ Interlude\n\nRead this before //Five Five Five Five Five//.\n\n* [[[SCP-2256]]] by qntm\n\n++ //Five Five Five Five Five// by qntm\n\nThis story is a direct sequel to //There Is No Antimemetics Division//.
