The object is presumed self-containing, and has been afforded the Safe classification.\n\nWhenever possible, the Foundation is to monitor and regulate any extraterrestrial craft entering and exiting Earth's atmosphere within the maximum possible range of SCP-6848. This is to be accomplished from secure containment Site-51 in collaboration with the United States federal government. For Veil preservation purposes, interplanetary transit in the southwestern United States is to be limited to a select number of approved spaceports. The list of ports in question must be unanimously agreed upon by the administrative council of Site-51, composed of a Foundation site director and the members of the MJ-12.\n\nNegotiations are underway with non-hostile extraterrestrial civilizations, with the objective of having said civilizations willingly reduce their presence on Earth to Site-51 and associated spaceports so as to respect Earth's Veil preservation policies in exchange for scientific collaboration with the Foundation and Pentagram.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6848 is an extremely antimemetic object presumably located somewhere in or beneath the southwestern United States. Due to SCP-6848's potent anomalous property, no other information concerning its size, shape, capabilities, purpose, identity, or any other element of its nature can be ascertained.\n\n[[div class=\"limit\"]] \n[[div class=\"anchor\"]] \n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Site-51 Status Report and Overview of Policy History\n++++ Address to the O4 Courts by Director M. Posadas, 2018\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/oOl46sj.png]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nIt would be easy to assume that the misinformation staff at Site-51 have experienced some sort of catastrophic failure. After all, ask any Veiled conspiracy theorist -- any casual UFO enthusiast or Parawatch regular -- and they'll give you the same story; a story that isn't far from the truth of what occurs at the site, involving extraterrestrial paratechnology and some vague conspiracy by the federal government of the United States.\n\nThough you would be forgiven for making such an assumption, it would be dead wrong.\n\nSite-51 policy serves as a lesson in soft power when it comes to Veil enforcement. Every absurd conspiracy theory you've ever heard about so-called \"Area 51\", we wanted you to hear. We engineered them to be absurd; disseminated them with careful thought and deliberation. And, after years of close collaboration with the Disinfo Department's best and brightest, we've came up with a formula for strategic misinformation that we believe can be of great use to the rest of the Foundation. After all, in a great many cases dealing with the anomalous, billions spent on mass amnesticization, media manipulation, and rewriting history seem wasted when one can instead simply trick the public by making the things hidden from them seem so absurd, so conspiratorial and crackpot, so laughably outlandish -- that [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6460 | nobody bothers to look into them seriously]]].\n\nIt isn't just a reduced need for a Veil budget that covers our paratech research, though. Site-51 is known for its collaboration, and not just in-house collaboration with our friends at M&D[[footnote]]Department of Misinformation and Disinformation[[/footnote]]. As you all know, the Site is co-owned with the American government, which uses it -- much as we do -- primarily for experimental paratech testing and as a base for extraterrestrial relations. //Technically//, their neck of the woods is called the \"Nevada Test and Training Range\", and ours is called \"Secure Research & Development Facility-51\"; Site-51 is the union of these two coinciding facilities. Makes more sense to have a single term, they're in the same complex after all. Decisions relevant to the entire site are made by an administrative council representing both parties[[footnote]]Composed of a Foundation site director and twelve Pentagram representatives (sometimes called the \"MJ-12\"), with each side controlling 50% of the vote collectively. A plebiscite of Site personnel is used as a tiebreaking vote, if necessary.[[/footnote]]. Despite our sometimes mixed relationship with the USA over the years, this collaboration has endured. It represents a relationship between Site-51 and the Pentagram Southwestern Command that lasted through the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal |Panopticon Crisis]]], the affairs of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/resurrection |Bowe Commission]]], and every other squabble had between our parent organizations from 1955 to present.\n\nBasically, it is only through collaboration -- be it with our own M&D Department, with the Pentagram, or even with the extraterrestrial Groups of Interest with which Site-51 negotiates -- that allows our site to exist. That allows us to reverse-engineer paratech and distribute the fruits of that labor to other Secure Containment Facilities and Departments. And that is why, fellow Site Directors, honorable Chairwoman of the Committee, I urge you to vote today not for isolation, but for further collaboration and integration; both within our own organization and with our allies, wherever in the world -- wherever in the //galaxy// -- they may reside.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nDue to their high level of involvement in the region surrounding SCP-6848 in addition to first-hand accounts, it is believed that SCP-6848 is an artifact of extreme importance to a number of extraterrestrial civilizations across the Milky Way galaxy. Frequent attempts to seek out and obtain the object by said civilizations have resulted in a swell of extraterrestrial activity in the southwestern United States, with 72% of appearances of unidentified extraterrestrial craft in North America occurring in the area. The first known mission in modern history by organisms of extra-planetary origin to seek out SCP-6848 crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, causing a major normalcy-endangering incident (see Addendum 1).\n[[/div]] \n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://i.imgur.com/reF9GLA.png\n| align=center\n| width=500px\n| height=200px\n| caption=Above: Map of U.S. counties deemed within the region of SCP-6848, which account for 72% of UFO sightings in North America.

However, almost all contacted expeditions universally view SCP-6848 as of high import in some way.[[/footnote]]. However, all information in such messages pertaining to SCP-6848's nature is rendered imperceptible to human listeners. This has led researchers to believe that the object is only antimemetic within the context of the human noosphere, as it ostensibly can be perceived in full clarity by non-Earth native observers.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ Addendum 6848.1: History\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nIt is unknown when SCP-6848 was created or first transported to Earth, however the parascientific and parahistorical consensus now accepts that the first earthbound extraterrestrial mission relating to it was indeed the Roswell incident of Human-Zeta Reticulan first contact in July of 1947. This incident, involving the crash landing of a Zeta Reticulan spacecraft near a ranch in New Mexico, saw the recovery of the ruined craft with an intact outer ring and anti-gravity apparatus, as well as four (4) intact or partially intact Zeta Reticulan cadavers belonging to its crew, by the United States. In later correspondences with Site-51 authorities[[footnote]]See document 704-Roswell-1967[[/footnote]], emissaries claiming to belong to the Reticulan Expeditionary Alliance[[footnote]]Reticulan: \"Ylgaof-ssdykl Hakdnanka\"[[/footnote]] clarified that the ship's crew had crashed, presumably due to failure to operate (or malfunction of) their craft's anti-gravity system, in a botched landing, and did in fact possess the deliberate intention to land in New Mexico with the purpose of discovering a \"Holy Ark, of great significance to our people\" (presumed to be SCP-6848).\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=8\n|speed=80\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Roswell_UFO_Museum_-_Alien_Autopsy_%286080682876%29.jpg/640px-Roswell_UFO_Museum_-_Alien_Autopsy_%286080682876%29.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Above: Cryogenically-preserved Zeta Reticulan cadaver.\n]]\n\nFollowing the recovery of the destroyed Roswell craft, national governments and paranormalcy agencies initially panicked over the discovery of potentially revolutionary paratechnology. Many, including the Pentagram at the time of the crash, believed they had uncovered technology similar to that used by the Ahnenerbe Obskurakorps to create //[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whats-going-down |Luftplatten]]]// and other so-called \"Wonder-weapons\" during the Seventh Occult War and that it could be applied for eigenweapon production or enabling travel at relativistic speeds. It is also believed that American possession of new extraterrestrial technology starting in 1947 heightened Cold War tensions and accelerated the inevitable coming arms race, with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin ordering the creation of the GRU Psychotronics Division later the same year. Ultimately, recovered material proved useful in discovering other extraterrestrial anomalies and research acquired from it was in fact used in a number of paratechnology development projects such as the Pentagram's black project //[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4220 |Helios]]]//.\n\nIn an attempt to ease these tensions and acquire help upholding the Veil during the Roswell situation, the Department of Defense requested the aid of the Foundation, a neutral organization in the Cold War, in dealing with the recovered material and suppressing public outcry. The Foundation agreed on the condition that the recovered material and any findings made regarding it be open to the Foundation and testing by its researchers, to which the American government assented. This agreement would serve as the basis of what would eventually become Site-51 under joint supervision of the Foundation and Pentagram.\n\nIn the coming decade, SCP-6848-related incidents increased in frequency and landings of extraterrestrial craft became a common occurrence across the southwestern deserts. The areas of landing were often isolated from large cities, inhospitable, or sparsely populated, aiding in the preservation of secrecy. Nevertheless, in the 1950s and 1960s, the Foundation and the United States continued to collaborate on the construction of a number of spaceports in the area intended for commercial and military collaboration between humankind and extraterrestrial civilizations, as to place earthbound landing sites for interplanetary activity and inquiry into SCP-6848 under the jurisdiction of normalcy-preserving authorities capable of regulating commercial, personal, and military interplanetary travel between terrestrial and alien parties. \n\nAs a base of operations for control of these ports and for the reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial paratechnology more broadly, Site-51 was constructed in 1955, greatly increasing the Foundation's administrative ability to control spaceflight to and from Earth and reducing the number of associated normalcy risks and containment breaches.\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ Addendum 6848.2: Record of SCP-6848-related Incidents\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 19 January 2018\n\n**PARTIES PRESENT:** \n* Galvin Chu, researcher, Department of Paratechnology\n* Doug McCarthy, major general, Pentagram\n* Agnes Hartmann, ambassador, Department of Extraterrestrial Relations\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION REMOVED]\n[[/=]]\n\n**CHU:** ...So //that's// really it?

Closer inspection revealed multiple objects, with Pentagram officers identifying them as unidentified aerial craft of seemingly artificial extraterrestrial origin, prompting Site-51 authorities to be contacted. Airborne objects were round, elongated, and white in coloration, composed of an unknown material. Entirely smooth, they showed no external markings and possessed no signs of a conventional propulsion system. Objects appeared to display the ability to become intangible at will and were able to accelerate to relativistic speeds almost instantaneously from a state of zero acceleration. \n\nCrafts were attacked by Pentagram battleships and fighter jets, though proved incredibly resilient and remained mostly intact after being shot down into the ocean. Site-51 authorities requested the recover of the partially damaged craft for it to be brought to the site, studied and reverse-engineered, to which Pentagram command assented.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/USS_Nimitz_%28CVN-68%29_returning_to_Norfolk_1981.JPEG/640px-USS_Nimitz_%28CVN-68%29_returning_to_Norfolk_1981.JPEG |\n    caption=Above: USS //Nimitz// aircraft carrier. |\n    align=center |\n    width=100%\n]]\n\n**Project Aim:** Project //Shipwreck// was the joint initiative between the Foundation and Department of Defense Pentagram at Site-51 to manufacture reverse-engineered anomalous aircraft from advanced extraterrestrial vessels recovered in 2004 and utilize said vessels to locate and identify SCP-6848.\n\n//Shipwreck// was initially intended as purely a reverse-engineering mission for scientific and military application. It was only upon the discovery by Site-51's paratechnology office that piloting of the recovered vehicles required uploading of the consciousness to a secure network onboard the craft, thereby temporarily isolating oneself from the human noosphere, that their use as a means to identify or locate SCP-6848 was considered. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=8\n|speed=80\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=40%\n|url=https://i.imgur.com/vh1w00o.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Above: Frame from the fabricated footage disseminated by Site-51.\n]]\n\nOnce a sufficient understanding of the technology was attained and a working aircraft constructed, it was planned to outfit said craft with a camera system, utilize a human test subject as pilot, and upload said subject's consciousness to the craft, at which point it was theorized their consciousness would no longer be considered human and would prove capable of mentally rendering SCP-6848. From this point, the subject would be instructed to fly the craft toward SCP-6848, activating on-demand intangibility if necessitated.\n\nBy 2016, an effective model based off of the recovered craft had been devised and a number of prototypes produced. The produced model demonstrated all conventional capabilities expected, but did not conceptualize SCP-6848 upon insertion of a human intelligence. As such, Project //Shipwreck// has been deemed complete and Project //Dockyard// has been instantiated to determine possible flaws in the previous hypotheses regarding SCP-6848 such that the issue of reverse-engineering a conceptualization of the object can later be revisited.\n\nDespite the project's nominal failure for its intended purpose, //Shipwreck// was later approved by Site-51's Disinformation and Misinformation authorities as a favorable candidate for conspiracization disinfo procedures. In 2017, Disinformation personnel facilitated the production of faked footage using reverse-engineered crafts, releasing it to the Veiled population through a secure civilian cover under the false explanation that they were recordings depicting the sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena by the crews of the Navy aircraft carriers USS //Nimitz// and USS //Theodore Roosevelt// at varying points in 2004, 2014, and 2015. This disinformation campaign proved successful, with the majority of the population defaulting to the authority of official investigations promised by the US government on the matter of aerial phenomena following the publication of the footage. Also in line with disinformation goals, those members of the civilian population who did not do such were successfully portrayed as conspiracists and largely discredited.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\n[[span
