All staff who enter the subject's quarters must wear disposable gloves, safety goggles and mask. Physical contact with SCP-6879 must remain limited and avoided if possible. When staff exit the containment area all equipment and clothing worn/used must be removed and either washed or disposed of.\n\nSCP-6879 is to be fitted with a catheter and rectal tube, which is to be changed every 12 hours. All feeding and hydration must be provided through an IV drip. The concentration of SCP-6879-A present around SCP-6879 is to be monitored. Recitation items and standard humanoid furnishings are not to be provided until improvements in SCP-6879-A containment and disposal can be found.\n\nAll deposits of SCP-6879-A that are produced from SCP-6879 should be neutralized. Testing should not be conducted on SCP-6879-A unless approved by the site director. Should any suspected instances involving SCP-6879-A be discovered outside of containment, they must be reported to MTF Beta-7 (\"Maz Hatters\") and Tau-51 (\"Urban Brawl\") who must be immediately dispatched to secure the instance. In the event SCP-6879-A has already been consumed, Rho-6 (\"Deifecators\") can be dispatched if required.\n\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block name=kaboom.jpg|\n    caption= SCP-6879 at Site-17 recreational centre.|\n    align=right\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6879 is the designation for a male humanoid of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, measuring 1.8m in height and weighing 90kg and appearing in their late twenties. Several scars cover portions of the subject's body, specifically the abdomen, upper arms, hips, crown and nape of the head. A faded tattoo reading \"Mr. Kaboom, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment\" is located on the front of SCP-6879’s right shoulder. The only notable feature the subject exhibits outside of these markings is heterochromia iridum, possessing one blue eye and one pink eye.\n\nSCP-6879's body is capable of secreting seemingly limitless amounts of various chemical substances from any orifice on their body. Although SCP-6879 is easily able to secrete substances in liquid or gaseous form, they struggle to produce substances in solid form and have only managed to successfully produce them via ██████████. Corrosive, irritating, poisonous or highly reactive substances do not appear to affect SCP-6879's body, whether they originated from SCP-6879 themself or from an outside source. Testing has found that this isn't due to SCP-6879 possessing a natural immunity to said substance, but rather when interact with them, SCP-6879's body will counteract the chemicals by secreting substances that will negate or otherwise remedy the said effects. It is currently unknown whether SCP-6879 has control of this reaction. \n\nSCP-6879-A is the group designation for a paranarcotics, referred to as \"Pinkie\" by those who supplied and used them. In all recovered instances, SCP-6879-A has only been found in capsule form in various shades of pink. SCP-6879-A is composed of various chemical compounds, with experimentation and analysis only able to identify 76% of them.\n\nHistory and testing proved that SCP-6879-A is highly addictive and when ingested by --humans--  animals, SCP-6879-A causes various effects, both anomalous and non-anomalous. Evidence suggested that the effects are related to the consumer's desired 'high'. Effects ranged from abdominal cell growth, partial transformation, levitation, short-range translocation and temporary short-range reality warping. Continuous consumption of SCP-6879-A results in consumers' development of pink skin rash, similar to urticaria, damaged nerve cells and [REDACTED]. In liquid or gaseous form, SCP-6879-A can be absorbed by the skin and can act as a vesicant in high concentrations. The effects when absorbed through the skin are identical to consumption. There have been no recorded recoveries of SCP-6879-A addiction and all known consumers of SCP-6879-A have expired.\n\nDisposal of SCP-6879-A is incredibly difficult, as it is very unreactive and stains easily. The only known way of disposing of SCP-6879-A is to submerge it in a solution consisting of water, hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride and sodium chloride[[footnote]] Matching concentrations found in stomach acid. [[/footnote]]. No means of artificially reproducing SCP-6879-A has been discovered by the Foundation, so it is assumed that SCP-6879's anomalous properties are intrinsic to producing SCP-6879-A.\n\n------\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6879 came to the Foundation's attention as a result of the Foundation's investigation into SCP-6879-A. Between 1991 and 2003, the Foundation had been aware of SCP-6879-A usage as it was commonly used among the anomalous community as a recreational drug, especially in the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nexus-series#freeport |Free Ports]]]. Due to the animosity between the Foundation and the anomalous community, the Foundation were unable to investigate the production and supply of SCP-6879-A properly.\n\nThis changed when, on 21/12/2003, numerous students at Deer College consumed SCP-6879-A at a Christmas party, resulting in a 500m dimensional extrusion occurring between Portland, Oregon and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub |FP-01]]] (\"Three Portlands\"). Tau-51 were deployed and, along with the Three Portlands Police Department, were able to close the breach. Following this incident, a temporary agreement was made between the Foundation and the FP-01's Mayor-Council, to terminate all supply of SCP-6879-A.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=lighthouse.jpg|\n    caption= Interior of GoI-101 (\"Lighthouse Mafia\") plant. Tanks contained traces of Wodin, Neo Neo Coke, [REDACTED] and SCP-6879-A|\n    align=right\n]]\n\nWith the help of the Mayor-Council, the Foundation were able to locate SCP-6879-A's manufacturing plant in Jaghatu, Afghanistan. On 02/01/2004, a team comprised of members of Beta-7 and Tau-51 raided the plant. The plant was found to be empty although analysis indicated that numerous Rosen-Fortune Bridges[[footnote]] More commonly known among the anomalous community as 'Ways'. [[/footnote]] had been opened a few hours earlier. Items and documents recovered at the plant indicated that it was used by GoI-101 (\"Lighthouse Mafia\")[[footnote]] Before this event, it was believed GoI-101 only traded in paratech. However, recent activity has shown they have branched into trading paranarcotics and other anomalous chemicals. See attached UIU report for further details: [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-file-2003-112 |2003-112]]] [[/footnote]] base of production.\n\nIn the basement of the plant, numerous tanks were discovered containing a variety of paranarcotics, including SCP-6879-A, although the tanks containing SCP-6879-A were connected to a single sealed vat in an adjacent room. Surgical equipment and bloodstains were found nearby. Upon opening and draining the contents of the vat, members of Beta-7 discovered SCP-6879, chained to the bottom with tubes feeding into their body, where they were recovered and taken for immediate medical assessment and potential questioning. Attached is SCP-6879's initial medical assessment:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Medical Assessment\" hide=\"▽ Medical Assessment\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: #f4f4e0; text-color:black;\"]]\n= **MEDICAL ASSESSMENT (MA-6879-01)**\n----\n**SUBJECT:** ##red|SCP-6879-A##[[footnote]] Before the discovery that SCP-6879 was the source of SCP-6879-A, SCP-6879 was referred to as SCP-6879-A and vice versa.

Weighing a total of 55kg, measured at 180cm. Subject suffered progressive alopecia. Remaining hair showed pink pigment. The skin was coated in equally pink welts, featuring universally present scar tissue, indicating the subject had recently undergone several surgical procedures. Their jaw and throat showed swelling and minor internal bleeding, likely due to a dental vacuum found in the subject's mouth. Teeth were damaged and undermaintained however gums showed no inflammation.\n\nThe subject showed an impaired motor control, visceral motor control over lower intestine and detrusor. NCS confirmed the subject's pelvic, pudendal and femoral nerves had undergone individual lesions at post-synaptic locale.\n\nThe subject appears to be continually producing SCP-6879 from their pores and orifices. Analysis has also found high concentrations of SCP-6879 in the subject's urine and stools. It is essential that the subject must be examined with the appropriate PPE equipment.\n\nThe subject was incredibly distressed upon recovery and showed fear to all personnel who approached them, especially those dressed in standard medical uniforms. To ease examination and transportation, the subject was sedated with 1.5mg propofol IV.\n----\nForward: ##red|SCP-6879-A## was taken to Site-228 to receive nutrition, further physical examination and possible treatment.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**Addendum 6879.1: Interviews**\n\nAfter it was confirmed that SCP-6879's containment was stable and secure, attempts were made to interview SCP-6879 about their time in the plant and GoI-101. However, SCP-6879 remained distressed and uncompliant, claiming they \"wouldn't tell\" and \"they'll hurt me\". They also repeatedly claimed they \"wanted their dad\" or \"mum\". In hopes of retrieving any information, the site manager requested the assistance of Site-12's psychotherapist, Dr. Zachary Dafydd.\n\nThe following transcripts are interviews with SCP-6879:\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Transcript 6879-1\" hide=\"▽ Transcript 6879-1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 13/01/2004\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Zachary Dafydd, Level 3 Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6879\n------\n**Forward:** Interview was conducted in SCP-6879's containment chamber, with SCP-6879 set up in their bed.

Their legs are still in bad shape. Hair is still a mess. All in all not much has changed.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Hamilton?\n\n**Hamilton:** Their teeth are fine. There is a build-up of that pink stuff around the tonsils and tongue. I think that's going to be a problem in the future.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** As I thought. OK, Steff, how much do you know about Prometheus's engineering?\n\n**Dr. González:** Only what I've seen from the Ports when I worked with UIU and only the medical stuff. Good stuff. Bit temperamental and clunky but -\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** SCP-6879's scars. Is there something about them that's unusual?\n\n**Dr. González:** Not really. Actually - they are a bit haphazard in spots, especially on the stomach and hips. Plus there is some timing difference between some of the scars. I can't say how much but enough that I could spot it. A months difference I'd think.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** So those areas have repeatedly had the same surgical attention?\n\n**Dr. González:** That's a good guess.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** OK, good. Things are starting to make sense.\n\n**Hamilton:** Care to share your conclusions?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** I'm theorising that whatever the Mafia did to 6879 wasn't permanent. I think they probably got hold of dash-A's formula from MC&D after Lab's liquidation and used 6879 as a means of making it. But, if I remember correctly, the Mafia aren't the most assiduous scientists. So they have to update 6879 now and again, making sure they can continue producing dash-A.\n\n**Dr. González:** You think Labs invented dash-A?\n\n **Dr. Dafydd:** Sort of. Wodin and [REDACTED] were found at the plant. We know Wodin is an adaption of one of Lab's Gods' Eyes, so Lab's is somehow mixed up in this. It's likely that dash-A or something similar was a Lab's formulation and the Mafia somehow managed to get 6879 to make it.\n\n**Hamilton:** So what's this got to do with SCP-6879 and what we just did?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** 6879 told me they used to be able to make other chemicals before they were altered by the Mafia. I think 6879's current condition may be reversible. If we could restore 6879's original abilities, that would take a huge weight off our resources and make 6879's containment way easier.\n\n**Dr. González:** Hold on. If what your saying about the Mafia and dash-A is true, how come 6879 hasn't flushed it out of their system already. It's been about two months since we found them and their condition seems to be getting worse, not better.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Psychosomatic.\n\n**Hamilton:** What?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Psychosomatic. 6879-A's increase in production is a direct result of 6879's mental and physical condition. Their surroundings, trauma, memories and stress are influencing their mind, in turn influencing their body, forcing it to continue dash-A's production. They're essentially stuck in a feedback loop.

Not only has the production of SCP-6879-A increased but SCP-6879 has grown increasingly withdrawn and despondent and has started to show signs of regression. My concern is that given these factors, 6879 containment is likely to grow in difficulty as time goes on, resulting in even more Foundation time and resources being used. I am also not a fan of seeing someone in such a state, even if they are an anomaly.\n\nWith that said, I would like to propose an improvement in SCP-6879's containment. I would like 6879 to undergo nerve grafting. After this, I believe 6879 should receive physical and occupational therapy to hopeful regain independence. Steffano believes there is a good chance of it working if he performs the operation. This will be done in parallel with continuous counselling sessions with myself, where I will focus on helping 6879 adjust to their new environment and better deal with their past issues.\n\nI believe these changes will positively influence both 6879's mental and physical health. This will shift 6879's focus as a result, motivating them and will influence them to subconsciously break the cycle of 6879-A production.\n\nPlease reply with your thoughts,\n\nZac\n\nP.S. I shall make enquiries regarding GoI-101 and GoI-386[[footnote]]\"Dr. Wondertainment\"[[/footnote]] if 6879's mental health improves.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**DATE:** 08/02/2004\n**FROM:** Dr. Cren <{{bertiecren@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Dr. Dafydd <{{z2dafydd@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** RE: Containment of SCP-6879\n[[/div]]\n----\nHi Zac,\n\nA nerve grafting is a very time-consuming and complex procedure. That sort of procedure isn't even offered to our staff, let alone an anomaly.\n\nThat being said, our resources are stretching thin and it would be beneficial to simplify 6879's containment procedures.\n\nZac, can you and Steffano confidently say this will work? I don't want to risk altering an anomaly's condition too much.

Dr. Dafydd witnessed the surgery from an observation room. Surgery was successfully completed 10 hours later, with no incidence. Following the surgery, SCP-6879 was sent to Site-228 medical ward for medical observation and postoperative care for a minimum of 4 weeks.\n\nDuring this time, SCP-6879 received psychological counselling from Dr. Zachary Dafydd. As part of SCP-6879's psychiatric care, SCP-6879 was permitted to listen to music and audiobooks. Over the course of their postoperative care and their session with Dr. Dafydd, SCP-6879 began to display improvement in their mental stability. SCP-6879's physical health improved too, with SCP-6879's skin clearing of all welts, regaining control of their bowels and bladder and their hair beginning to thicken and shift to a browner pigment. SCP-6879-A's production also began to decrease, with personnel only required to wear standard PPE after 3 weeks.\n\nThe following transcript is a conversation between Dr. Dafydd and SCP-6879 regarding SCP-6879's recovery:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Transcript 6879-3\" hide=\"▽ Transcript 6879-3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 07/03/2004\n**Interviewers:** Dr. Zachary Dafydd, Level 3 Department of Anomalous Humanoid Psychology\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6879\n------\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Good afternoon, Mr Kaboom.\n\n**SCP-6879:** Hello Dr. Dafydd.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** What were you listing to just now?\n\n**SCP-6879:** //The Graveya - yard Book// by Neil Gaiman.

However, it has been determined that SCP-6879 still suffers from a form of PTSD. Topics involving the Lighthouse Mafia and  SCP-6879-A cause SCP-6879 severe discomfort and increases SCP-6879-A production. SCP-6879 also shows signs of sociotropic tendencies, perfectionism, low self-esteem and a strong desire to 'do better'. They also appear to engage in thumb sucking when alone. These issues and patterns are to be monitored and addressed if needed.\n\nThrough observation and tests, it's been determined that SCP-6879 shows an above-average intelligence and memory capacity, being able to perform and understand given tasks at remarkable speeds. Their most noticeable traits, however, are their dexterity and crafting skills. SCP-6879 has shown a variety of handicraft capabilities, showing intermediate knowledge in sewing, marquetry, dyeing, carpentry, metalworking and technical drawing. They've also shown, unsurprisingly, intermediate knowledge of chemistry. It has also been discovered that SCP-6879 has some understanding of other languages, including Russian, Yiddish and German, although only phrases and greetings. How SCP-6879 has accumulated these skills is yet to be determined.\n\nIt should be noted, that SCP-6879's characteristics are rather unusual compared to other SCPs under the 'Misters' title.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nOn 10/05/2004, secretion of SCP-6879-A from SCP-6879 stopped altogether with no traces found in SCP-6879 waste.

As a result, SCP-6879's physical and occupational therapy sessions were put to an end and deemed successful, although suspicion was raised over SCP-6879's quick recovery.

Dr. Dafydd accompanied SCP-6879 and remained with them until they went to sleep. SCP-6879 was not given any sedatives or drugs. SCP-6879 ejections were taken to the Department of Chemistry for study.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-6879 received several other sessions with Dr. Dafydd over the next few weeks, focusing on SCP-6879's relationship with Dr. Wondertainment, their time with the Mafia, their mental wealth and techniques to cope with their issues. Oneiric and psionic techniques were not employed during these sessions. SCP-6879-A continued to be produced in low concentrations. To mitigate this, Dr. Dafydd taught SCP-6879 several coping techniques and was told how to neutralise it themselves.\n\nAfter several weeks, SCP-6879 once again showed signs of recovery, with their personality and behaviour returning to a state similar to 6 months before. SCP-6879 once again, cease producing SCP-6879-A soon after too. As well as improvements in behaviour, SCP-6879 no longer engaged in self-medication and showed an improvement in self-esteem. With these improvements in mental stability and self-control, SCP-6879 threat level was reclassified was [[span style=\"color:green\"]]●[[/span]] Green.\n\nOn 11/11/2004, Dr, Dafydd conducted one final session with SCP-6879.

Just the same old images.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** How do you feel about them now?\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**SCP-6879:** It's odd. I was angry in the beginning, and scared, but now -  now it's just - oh what's the word - melancholy, maybe. It's like, the memories make me feel sad but I'm - separated from it. I don't care about it anymore. Does that make sense?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n**SCP-6879:** It's odd. Before, I didn't want to think about what happened to me. I didn't want to remember. Now, I can't help wondering what used to be in those blank gaps in my mind. And then, I wonder if the others are like this.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Others?\n\n**SCP-6879:** The other Little Misters. What were we? What were our former lives and names?

I would've liked to know just a little bit more. That Mad fellow was so familiar.\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Do you think you'll keep your name?\n\n**SCP-6879:** I thought about that. I guess you could start calling me SCP-6879, but - I don't know why, but I want to keep my name. Despite the fact, that he gave me the name as part of her - control - it's still a part of me. It's the only name I've ever known.

It's the best site we have for humanoids and special phenomena like you and it's got plenty more to offer you rather than this place. You can do so much there. You could be with people like you.\n\n**SCP-6879:** Will I get to continue my work?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** //(nods)// I bet you'll be making PJs for everyone.\n\n**SCP-6879:** I like the sound of that.

To get you to a point where you can be the most comfortable you can be in our care. I've done that. You can move on now. So can I. We aren't - friends but - I still want you to be happy.\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**SCP-6879:** Is this goodbye?\n\n**Dr. Dafydd:** Yes. Yes, it is.\n\n//(SCP-6879 stands up and holds out a hand.

I just wanted to let you know that I'm OK and I think I'm going to be OK for the rest of my time here. You should see the place we've got. I mean, my rooms are fine. Bit of a bland colour but they've let me paint the interior.\n\nYeah, I can make paint now. And others. They've got me learning all sorts of things. Medicine. Cosmetics. They're going to let me try food soon, apparently.\n\nYou were right. There are people like me. There's this one [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-208 |guy]]]. Huge, he is. He's got me helping with kids in the medical wing. Made a whole line of teddy bears just for them. They're also this [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4818 |girl]]] who can do cool things with light and a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-073 |guy]]] with metal hands! He's real nice. He like the jackets and sweaters I made for him. They've got me doing that now. Making things for the others. Some of the staff want stuff too!\n\nThe best is the jumper [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-507 |dude]]]. He seemed lonely when I first met him, but we hit it off. I'm making a jumper for him when he comes back. Apparently, he lost his other one in a world covered in sand.\n\nI guess, I just wanted to confirm that, I'm fine. You were right. Everything's alright now.\n\nThank you,\n\nMr. Kaboom\n[[/div]]\n\nI've spoken with RAISE and given what they're doing for us, we might grant them a Blue classification. You should see what they've made. I'm talking about some Met Gala level work here. They were waisted working for the Doctor.\n\nAnyway, I hope you're proud of what you've done.
