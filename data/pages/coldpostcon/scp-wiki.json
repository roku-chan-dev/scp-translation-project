Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated and can lead to disqualification of your own entry.\n\n* Only one entry is allowed per user. **No collaborations are allowed.** Your entry can not be reviewed by anyone but yourself. If we find out your work was shared prior to posting, then it will be disqualified.\n\n* **Pre-existing drafts are not allowed.** All entries should be brand new in origin.\n\n* Edits are not allowed while the contest is ongoing. //This includes SPaG edits and any other changes to add, remove, or modify content.// The only edits that will be allowed are edits to fix broken themes, images, or other issues that may occur during posting. However, these edits must be performed right after posting. Improper edits or late edits will result in a reversion of the edits and possible disqualification.\n\n* Articles can not be submitted anonymously for this contest due to time constraints regarding the short posting period.\n\n* Winners will be determined by vote count by category: SCP entries and non-SCP entries.\n\n* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.\n\n* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests with the possibility of further disciplinary action being taken depending upon the act in question. Examples of shenanigans include, but are in not limited to:\n * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of posting.\n * Spamming other users with messages concerning your work.\n * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's.\n\n* The contest marshals for this contest are [[*user Modulum]], [[*user Naepic]] and [[*user WhiteGuard]]. As stated above, if you have questions concerning the contest, feel free to reach out to them or another [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/community-outreach-main|Community Outreach team member]]]. The contest marshals will have the ability to disqualify entries for violations of the above-listed rules, egregiously poor sportsmanship not otherwise enumerated, or failure to fit the theme. All decisions are appealable to the contest marshals.\n\n\n+ ##368BC1|Tagging:##\n\nAs previously stated, adding the tag \"{{coldpostcon}}\" to your entry will cause it to show up on this page. We encourage you to also //tag your entries yourself// if you feel comfortable with doing so.  To make the whole process smoother, we have [[[a-laymen-s-guide-to-tagging|Laymen's Tagging Guide]]] and a [http://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list list of all current tags]. Please make sure to consult these when self-tagging, they're great resources!\n\n[[=]]\n-- **Do not add the \"{{scp}}\" tag yourself!
