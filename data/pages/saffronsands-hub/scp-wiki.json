The world of I.S.S. is a completely godless one; in which rampant factions attempt to corral power and support to fulfill what roles have been opened, and one fellow (and his occasionally assholish snake demon) attempt to nix a plot long running behind the scenes. \n> \n> The Foundation's role here is a passive one; new to the landscape of India, they mainly rely on such groups as The House of the Naga to provide major intel. As such, they're often late to the party, gambling on large scale control rather than preventative measures. Most developing problems are met with force by the House -- psychokinetic fiends that do whatever the hell they want, as long as it's for the good of India.\n> \n> Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Samanee Samaj is quite against this. A splinter from the House, they attempt to enforce normalcy via any means necessary; whether that be poisoning the force that House members manipulate, effectively killing them, or destroying the minor deities that foolishly roam the area.\n> \n> India is a place of conflict, where the House has retreated into the shadows, the Foundation is lost, the BSS reigns, and the anomalous is not discussed. Despite this, a number of minor deities decide to make their move once more...\n> \n> ----\n> \n> In Saffron Sands is intended to discuss important topics; stuff like xenophobia, homophobia, poverty, and the like. Despite this, expect some comedy too; it is what the gods do best, and in the words of The Devil; \"Unpleasantness is the worst kind of pleasantness. Humor is needed to make the drab worth getting through.\"\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 175%]] ##330000|**Prologue: What Was Left Behind (Or; Godless Skies)**## [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[include component:image-block name=ruins | caption= --- | align= center]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]][[[scp-3279 |  Part One: In Which We Learn Of A Peaceful Existence]]][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n> SCP-3279-1 has been abandoned since 1947, due to the Partition of India. It was formerly owned by a Mr. Raj Singh and Mrs. Gurpreet Kaur. Singh was killed during the movement of refugees during Partition, and Kaur passed away in Chandigarh in 1987.\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]][[[scp-5413 | Part Two: In Which We See No Divinity Here]]][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n> A single unmarked bottle lays near the back wall, filled with syringes.

Perhaps I should plant a few.\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]][[[lo-behold-the-tiger | Part Four: In Which We Learn Of The Ghost's Aforementioned Past]]][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n> The dying evening light was reflected in the tiger's eyes as they devoured the landscape for a few final moments. And for those moments, time seemed to slow to a crawl. The once valiant enemy saw a revenant, a specter from the dead, and ran. Turned tail and ran, as fast as their legs could carry them.\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]][[[scp-5903 | Part Five: In Which The Madness Begins To Spread]]][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n> Our fellow Sardars are losing strength.

Lepers, the starving, sick, poor. Everywhere. There was no dancing, no songs, no happiness. Everything had been stripped away like rabid dogs on a carcass; an image I saw far too frequently there.
