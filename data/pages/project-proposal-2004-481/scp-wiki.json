  "content": "[[include :scp-wiki:theme:much-cool]]\n  \n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**Name:** Helen Novak  \n  \n**Title:** //Over The Facts//  \n  \n**Material Requirements:**  \n* A set of used crayons (already in my possession)  \n* Copies of //Geschichte der Botanik//, //Origin and Geography of Cultivated Plants//, //Plant Physiology// alongside several used notebooks (already in my possession)  \n* A method to make a plant drawing grow\n* A wall large enough to display hundreds of pages (reserved for the entire event)  \n**Abstract:** I will paint a flowering plant on canvas, with a crayon set from my childhood. It will replicate the style and color palette of the attached artwork. I want this painting to be animate: it should be able to grow over other two dimensional media. This process can be more complicated if necessary, depending on the method of supernatural animation.\n  \nAt the start of the event, I will tear apart the textbooks and notebooks. I will hang each page on a wall in no particular order, covering up the entire wall. I am willing to do this part as a performance piece if desired. Finally, I will place the animated painting at the center of the wall.\n\nDuring the event, the painting will gradually spread across the displayed pages. This growth will reach all of the displayed pages, hopefully approaching the end of the event. As a closing act, I will welcome all audience members to take away a single page of their choosing with them.\n  \n**Intent:** This work will be an actualization of the revelations I recently had.\n\nI have always loved flowers and plants, even as a little girl. But I never had a specific reason. In high school, I often sketched flowers with charcoal, though in an amateur way. Coming into adulthood, I interpreted my interest in drawing plants as a desire to learn. As a result I pursued a bachelor's degree in biology. Later, I started graduate school, focusing on plant biology.\n\nI was unaware of the anart movement until several years ago: until the time I was visiting Amsterdam for a seminar. During my free time there, I decided to visit a sculpture exhibition. There, I met a visitor named Pavel Novak. I was chatting about one of the sculptures with other visitors, and Pavel asked us if we wanted to see an //underground// art gallery. Others were hesitant, but I was intrigued and decided to go with him. Long story short, he introduced me to the European anart scene.\n\nAt first, my amazement was strictly scientific. When a friend of Pavel showed me a mirror that reflected an alternate version of myself, I wondered how it worked. Does this [[[SCP-919|mirror]]] just create an illusion for the viewer? Does that Helen actually exist and beg for her lifeÂ //every time//? I get that this mirror is a symbol for an innate desire to be seen or someting similar. But how does it actually function? Things got weirder. I saw [[[SCP-6255 | walking coffee cups]]], [[[SCP-5701| Polaroids that show people after they are photographed]]] and [[[SCP-807| a plate that transforms any food into delicious junk food]]]... The artists behind the plate said that it is still a work in progress and the food would taste even better in the final work. \n  \nMy mind could not grasp any of these. Any attempt I made for an explanation caused even more confusion. After some time I realized that everything I learned at school was a lie. It is not that there are a few bizarre things in this universe... Nothing is //normal// about life. I lost all interest in academic work, dropped out of grad school, and moved in with Pavel. While unpacking, I found my old crayons alongside several pages I scribbled on as a kid. One of these was an attempt at painting a flower. Probably one of the flowers from our backyard. However, it did not look like an attempt at understanding; it looked like an attempt at creation. I decided to put it in my handbag right away, as a little memento. I did not put much thought into it at first, but looking at that terribly executed painting filled me with a renewed joy for experimentation. I am calling it //The Seed//, as it will be the seed of my artistic endeavours.\n  \n[[include component:image-block  \n|name=the_seed.png  \n|caption=Jefferson, Helen. The Seed. Circa 1974  \n|width=50%  \n|align=center]]\n\nFor my debut, I want to do what little Helen tried to do all those years ago: creating a live plant using crayons. And it will close a chapter of my life filled with \"facts\", by growing over them.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Response:** //Over the Facts//\n\nHelen,  \n\nI can see that your intention is to make a declaration about an awakening. And you are clearly willing to pour your newly discovered soul over this piece. \n\nI am willing to sponsor your proposal as is. This will involve a little bit of help from [[[clef101|another uniquely talented artist]]] for the duration of the event. But I do not believe that this would satisfy your yearning for creation. Someone else will be animating your work after all. And the growth will vanish after the event, leaving the pages as they were.\n\nSince I personally know about Pavel and his work, I will extend the trust I have with him to you. So, I have an offer. I am assembling a team of artists to collect the material requirements of a few proposals. They could find a more fitting method for //Over The Facts//. And you can be part of the process. Would you be interested to join?\n\nPS Pavel is also invited. Happy to learn that he found someone cool to hang out with by the way.\n    \n- The Patron\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** the_seed.png\n> **Name:** The Seed\n> **Author:** [[*user clutterArranger]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2004-481 SCP Foundation Wiki] \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
