The nebulae of SCP-5843 exhibit functions similar to lacrimal secretion of the eyes, to prevent them from becoming irritated.\n\nSCP-5843 is capable of verbal communication using words that echo throughout its system. It is not yet known how it is capable of vocalizations, nor how the sound is able to travel through the vacuum of space. SCP-5843 learned human languages from observation alone prior to its education by Binary Star and therefore displayed a limited means of communication upon initial discovery. SCP-5843 is capable of observing events and communicate without delay.\n\nBecause of its observational skills, SCP-5843 has a vast knowledge of the universe, specifically of the orientation of the universe. It remembers the position of everything it has ever seen and has made a mental map. It has provided the Foundation with coordinates of other anomalies and Locations of Interest in exchange for English lessons to improve its speech. Files related to the given coordinates are listed below.\n* SCP-████\n* SCP-████\n* SCP-████\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3195|SCP-3195]]] -- \"The Fault in Our Star\"\n* SCP-████\n* SCP-████\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4524|SCP-4524]]] -- \"A Flesh, New World\"\n* SCP-████\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5364|SCP-5364]]] -- \"Seventy Millimeter Projector\"\n* SCP-████\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5623|SCP-5623]]] -- \"Star Euthanizer\"\n* SCP-████\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5979|SCP-5979]]] -- \"Star Crossed Lovers\"\n* SCP-████\nFurther research in other coordinates is ongoing.\n\n**Discovery:** On 25 February 1955, the Foundation launched probes from the //Beholder// line into space to detect and study extraterrestrial anomalies. On 27 June 1982, Beholder-8 ceased to function after collision with debris. After three days, Binary Star was able to reconnect to Beholder-8, but could not maneuver it anymore due to damaged equipment. After internal deliberation, the probe was set to alert status instead of active.\n\nOn 13 March 2015, Beholder-8 gave out an emergency signal when it suddenly experienced heavy gravitational pull. Upon re-activation, SCP-5843 was discovered and had put the probe in a stable orbit around its central eye. Staff was ordered to establish contact with the anomaly immediately.\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ Addendum-1: Interview Logs\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Interview-5843-1**\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Interviewed:** SCP-5843\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Maurice Arkand and Site Director Maria Maxwells\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview happened after the initial discovery of the anomaly.\n----\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log, [13 March 2015]>**\n[[/=]]\n**Dr. Arkand:** //Crackling.// This is-\n\n**SCP-5843:** Engg- glishh?\n\n**Site Director Maxwells:** Did it just...
