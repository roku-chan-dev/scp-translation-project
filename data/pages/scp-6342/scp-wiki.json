This area extends from the Long Island Sound in the south to the Bay of Fundy in the north. Additionally, reports of SCP-6342 are to be discredited as nautical folklore attributed to prolonged periods of dehydration while on the water. \n\n**Description:** \n\nSCP-6342 is the designation given to an oversized //Cancer borealis//[[footnote]]More commonly known as Jonah Crab.[[/footnote]] identified as the mythical \"Crimson Pincer\" by local residents of Providence, Rhode Island, United States.\n\nReports of SCP-6342 seem to increase during the late winter/early spring, directly correlating with Providence's foggy season. Based on testimonials from locals, Foundation researchers theorize SCP-6342 to be between 1-7 meters across, with smallest size measurements coming from well-known members of Providence's fishing community. Correlational analysis into this phenomenon is currently ongoing. \n \n-----\n[[div class=\"comptext\"]]\n= |\n= |\n= Welcome \"Dr. Glass\"!\n= Would You Like To Update SCP-6342 Documentation?\n= |\n= |\n= Uploading Files...\n= |\n= Files Uploaded!\n= |\n= |\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Addendum - 01**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//SCP-6342 Exploration Logs//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Personnel Present:** Dr. Simon Glass; Junior Field Agent Hana \"Iris\" Thompson\n**Date:** June 3rd, 2018\n-----\n= **<<Begin Log>>** \n\n//<Dr. Glass and Agent Thompson sit on a bench at a bus stop.

Vesper closes the book as a small faerie with glasses flits by, staring at Vesper as it passes.>// \n\n**Vesper:** Skin-bound novels are deadly to those without resistance to the anomalous. \n\n**Thompson:** I appreciate the warning. What if you weren't here and I opened that book? \n\n**Vesper:** You would probably die. Although fate seems fluid, it's better to think of it as strands in a weave. Divination is all about interpreting those strands and recognizing which one you are currently travelling on. On this strand, I'm here to save you, on others I may not be. \n\n//<They reach out their hand to Agent Thompson, who takes it and stands back on her feet.>//\n\n**Thompson:** Thanks... I think? //<She sits with her back to the railing as Vesper skims through the shelves.>// Can I ask a question? \n\n**Vesper:** I'll save you from struggling with your wording: Yes, there's something for everyone here at Serena Verdae, and I can't think of many examples of people never finding friends. As long as you try, which you've already shown you do, and aren't completely abrasive, which you haven't been, you'll find your people.  \n\n//<Hana sighs. Vesper pulls out a heavy, barnacled tome from the shelf and places it in her arms. They turn around.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Yeah‚ÄîI should have guessed you would have an answer ready. \n\n**Vesper:** You're valid for feeling the way you do, Hana. //Many// of us were once in your shoes, and we were scared too. //<They walk over to a nearby table. Agent Thompson follows.>// That fear is only as large as you make it, though, and someday you have to face it in order to live your life. \n\n//<Vesper sits at the table and begins to carefully thumb through the tome's pages. Agent Thompson stops just before the table, removing a camera from her pocket before quickly hiding it again. She sits down.>// \n\n**Vesper:** Here, look at this.\n\n= **<<Break>>**\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"storybook\"]]\n= [[size larger]]**Ballad of the Crab Killer**[[/size]]\n[[=]]\nLong ago, on rocky shores, the bastard crab arise\nWith terror it sunk the sailing ships, of empires who claim the skies\nBut mortal men care not for myth, for their coffers have run dry\nTo slay the beast, they sent their fleets, the terror that must die\n\nThe fog fell fast upon them, the ropes they shake and sway\nThe sun consumed by greying clouds, the final lights of day\nTheir cannons aimed, the powder dry, men ready to attack\nFrom crow's nest the scouter shouts, \"I see its crimson back!\"\n\nTheir hulls lie broke and splintered, the water turned foamy red\nThe rocks became the resting place of those that wound up dead\nSurvivors told their fishing tales, their lucid word appends\n\"Long will live the bastard crab, and the harbor he defends\"\n\nAnd so the myth grows larger, a shadow across the land \nWeary eyes search the tides, their fear will make it grand\nWarriors come to slay the beast, their hubris stains the docks\nThe hunting men hid fast away, taken beneath the rocks\n\nBut one will come who'll kill the crab, who slays it without fear\nFor on that day, the greying skies, will finally recede and clear\nBlessed be the Crab Killer, armed with pale moonlight\nBlessed be the Crab Killer, who ends the city's blight\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<Continued>>**\n\n**Thompson:** Oh!

Agent Thompson wipes off the lens with her thumb.>//\n\n**Thompson:** //Before embarking on an expedition, it's important a field agent has all the necessary equipment.// //(Mumbling)// Let's see: boots? Check. Rain coat? Check. Ever increasing sense of dread that I'm making the wrong choice? //<She sighs.>// Check.\n\n**Thompson:** So I didn't drown‚Äîyet. At least whoever finds this footage will be able to pick up that much. //<She begins pacing the shore.>// Now if I were a big scary crab who can apparently sink boats, where would I be? \n\n//<She removes a glow stick from her backpack and cracks it. The surrounding fog begins to glow a light green.>// \n\n**Thompson:** I would probably just hide under rocks all day. I can't imagine wanting to get some food only for some asshole to crush me with a rock or boil me alive in a pot of water. \n\n//<The sound of her stomach growling can be heard.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Although at this point, that doesn't seem too bad. \n\n//<She removes a granola bar from her backpack and begins scanning the shoreline.>//\n\n**Thompson:** Was this a stupid idea? Would people really care if I walked up to them and said \"Hey, I'm the person who went out in a storm to take a photo of a crab\"? \n\n//<A crunching noise can be heard as Agent Thompson crushes the remains of a crab shell. She jumps.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Fuck! //<She struggles to catch her breath.>// It's just a crab. A dead crab. Not a crab that has killed hundreds of people. \n\n//<Agent Thompson pulls the camera slightly out of her pocket, thumbing over the runes carved on its surface. She walks to a nearby puddle, her appearance distorted by the ripple of raindrops.>// \n\n**Thompson:** You really look like shit, don't you, Hana? //<She sighs.>// How did you get here? \n\n//<Somewhere in the distance the sound of scraping against rock can be heard. Agent Thompson spins to face the noise. A dog-sized shadow can be seen retreating behind a rock.>//\n\n**Thompson:** Got you! \n\n//<She sprints over to the rock, camera in hand. Seaweed and algae cover the rock. Agent Thompson crosses her arms.>// \n\n**Thompson:** What's the point of this? I'm soaked and I probably look like an idiot kicking around in the sand at who knows what time. //<She sighs.>// Mist Crab! Mist Crab are you there? I know where we can find some ships to feed you! //<A pause, silence.>// Yeah, fuck this.\n\n//<Agent Thompson begins to walk back towards the dock. As she crosses from grass to sand, she hears a collection of rocks shift and begin to roll. She grabs a loose stick and holds it outstretched, lifting one of the rocks up and reveals a small hermit crab.>// \n\n**Thompson:** //(Whispering)// Oh, thank Christ. //<She clears her throat.>// Hey, little fella. Are you the Crimson Pincer? Are you going to spill my blood on the rocks of this island too? \n\n//<A rumbling noise can be heard, soft at first, but louder as the hermit crab takes shelter in its shell. The a cacophany of clicks can be heard as a car-sized shadow begins to approach Agent Thompson. She drops the stick and stumbles backwards.>// \n\n**Thompson:** //(Mumbling)// Wow you really are real. Holy shit! My classmates aren't going to believe what I bring back. They'll all want to hear about how I met the crab and lived. //<She pauses.>// Hey... we're cool, right? Just let me write down some notes on what you look like, maybe take a picture or two and I'll be out of your hair-er, uh antennae? \n\n//<She takes the camera out of her pocket and hesitates for a moment, allowing the crab to get closer.>//\n\n**Thompson:** It's just a photo, Hana. Just one photo and you can put it back in your jacket and pretend it doesn't exist. \n\n//<With a mumbled prayer she takes a picture, illuminating the fog around her, and momentarily dazing the crab. She grabs the polaroid, shakes it, and places it in her pocket.>//\n\n**Thompson:** Now to get the fuck out of here. \n\n//<Agent Thompson begins to run towards the dock but the creature blocks her path. It grows in size and she begins to walk backwards.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Come on. Just go away already! You're just a crab! Seagulls own you guys.\n\n//<She grips the glowstick with her hand and throws it at the creature, harmlessly bouncing off its shell. The sound of a door opening can be heard behind her.>//\n\n**Vesper:** Hana, get inside! \n\n**Thompson:** Vesper? What the fuck are you doing here? \n\n**Vesper:** Now!\n\n//<Agent Thompson runs towards the lighthouse proper. A vaguely humanoid figure can be seen holding open the door, calling to her. The crab, hissing and snapping, chases Agent Thompson to the lighthouse. Once inside, the creature begins banging at the walls of the building, shaking it and causing dust to fall from the ceiling.>//\n\n**Thompson:** //(Panting)// What the fuck was that!? First it was so //so// little and then‚Äî \n\n**Vesper:** Breathe, Hana. It's alright. \n\n**Thompson:** Why are you here? I thought you'd be happy just watching this from the sideline.\n\n**Vesper:** I knew you would be safe because I knew I would be here to save your ass. Besides, having your partner get killed during a group project isn't a good look. \n\n//<Agent Thompson embraces Vesper.>//\n\n**Thompson:** You're still a sight for sore eyes, but I'm really happy you're here. \n\n**Vesper:** It's not over yet, we still have to make it back to the harbor. \n\n//<A pause. Agent Thompson removes the polaroid and camera from her jacket pocket. The image of a crab slowly begins to appear.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Aw fuck, it's blurry, but hopefully this will still work. \n\n//<Agent Thompson removes a black cloth survival kit from her backpack, and takes a bottle of rubbing alcohol from within it. She takes the polaroid, rolls it, places it in the rubbing alcohol. She shakes the bottle for a few minutes, causing the contents of the clear white bottle to turn a muddled grey. After some time, she removes the photo from the bottle.>//\n\n**Vesper:** Ew, gross it's all gooey now. \n\n//<They gag.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Isn't that what you expected? \n\n**Vesper:** Worse.\n\n//<A pause. Silence.>//\n\n**Thompson:** God, I haven't done that in a while. \n\n//<She takes a deep breath in, then out.>//  \n\n**Vesper:** How are you feeling?\n\n**Thompson:** I-I think I'm good. Do you want to go outside now?\n\n**Vesper:** Aren't you still worried?\n\n//<She holds up the picture.>// \n\n**Thompson:** I think I just got so caught up with everything that it all just piled up, you know? //<She pauses for a moment, before tearing the photo into a collection of small pieces.>// I think I'm ready now. \n\n//<The pair exit the library and find the creature still scuttling outside. Its form is torn and melty, and it begins to shrink as Agent Thompson approaches.>//\n\n**Vesper:** I knew you could do it, you know? \n\n**Thompson:** Pfft, that? It's just a lame party trick. Nothing compared to what you can do. \n\n**Vesper:** Well I feel like a lot of people would like this \"lame party trick\" of yours. \n\n//<Agent Thompson pauses.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Maybe. I think I'd like to share it sometime. //<She points at the crab.>// So what do we do with it? I doubt many people will be scared of a melty crab now. \n\n**Vesper:** //(Mockingly)// Behold, the //terrifying// Crimson Pincer. \n\n//<They both begin to laugh. Agent Thompson takes another photo, then picks the crab up with her hands.>// \n\n**Thompson:** Maybe we can bring it to class. That'll definitely impress the professor, won't it? \n\n**Vesper:** Considering you already broke the rule about disrupting the creature, I wouldn't show her any evidence of you doing that. \n\n//<Agent Thompson pauses. Vesper laughs.>//\n\n**Thompson:** Oh... fuck. I'm going to fail now, aren't I? \n\n**Vesper:** I think I warned you. Twice. Oh well, it's just an entry-level course.  \n\n**Thompson:** //(Mumbling)// That's easy for you to say. What if the school doesn't want me back now? \n\n**Vesper:** This is nothing compared to what people have done in the past, especially to Lisera. Don't worry, Hana, you'll be back. \n\n//<They begin to walk towards the dock. Suddenly a pained yelp can be heard in the recording. Agent Thompson tries to shake the crab off of her thumb, throwing it against the ground. It shatters on the rocks.>// \n\n**Vesper:** So about‚Äî\n\n**Thompson:** I don't want to talk about it. \n\n//<The sun begins rising in the distance, and a small dinghy with two figures appears. As they begin to prepare to leave the island, Hana removes the rune-carved camera from her jacket, offering it to one of the figures to take a photo of the pair. They pose together in front of the lighthouse, then board the boat as a flock of seagull's begin to pick at the creature's corpse.>//  \n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[span class=\"comptext\"]]\n= |\n= |\n= Show Updated Documentation? \n= |\n= Loading...
