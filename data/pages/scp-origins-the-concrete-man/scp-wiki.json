He didn’t mind the stares, continuing on through the streets, by the people, to his home.\n\nHe held a bottle in his hand, a curious label adorning its side, the contents therein splashing against the walls of their glass container.\n\nWhen he arrived at the street, his home just across, he sprinted full throttle from one side to the other. The //honk// of a gentleman’s car rang through the day, his bewildered words falling upon deaf ears.\n\nThe door swung open to awaken even the deepest of sleepy birds. But there was only his mother, resting in her bed upstairs.\n\nHe made his way through the corridor, the paint on the walls slowly withering away, the floorboards adorned with holes down to the basement, still wet from last week’s storm.\n\n”Mother! Mother!” Robert yelled up the stairs. His footsteps echoed on the dilapitated walls, the stairs creaking under him. ”Mother!”\n\nHis hands firmly grasped the corroding brass handle of his mother’s bedroom, turned and opened it. In the corner of the room, there lied his mother, wrapped in blankets warm enough to boil an egg, on cushions softer than the thickest clouds. The shudders of the window were shut, only letting sparse rays of the sun shine through.\n\nRobert simply stood at the door, the bottle firmly in his hands, as he stared at the brittle husk of his mother. She slowly moved her arm, so careful, one might’ve assumed she was one of those people cursed with their bones to be glass he had heard about. He quickly waved away the thought.\n\nShe raised her arm, but it quickly fell onto the blankets again. Robert made his way toward her.\n\n”Mother. Rest,” he said in the calmest tone he could muster up with the bottle in his hands.\n\nShe looked up at him, barely able to turn her head. Her eyes were sunken in, almost hollowed-out looking, appearing like absolute blackness in the shadows. Her skin was raggedy, hanging over her bones like wet paper. She moved with the slowness of a snail, with the fear of an oyster with no shell, sitting on the coast.\n\nRobert fought off a gulp, his voice brittle and little: ”Mother, I’ve brought you some medicine.” He held the bottle to her eyes, so that she might recognize it.\n\nHer eyes strained at the thing in her son’s hands, her mind too weak to form coherent thoughts. Eventually, she moved her dry lips to speak, her teeth yellow and rotten.\n\n”This... th--this...”\n\nHe laid his warm hand against his mother’s skin. ”Rest, mother. I’ll bring you a cup. You’ll--”\n\n”... is... a f--fabrication...”\n\nShe watched as her son’s expression changed in an instant. That expression she had only seen on her son when he was still a little child changed to that of a man being confronted with the horrors of the real world.\n\nHe turned the bottle around to see the label so symmetrically plastered onto the front, his eyes widening upon inspecting the label closer.\n\nThe bottle fell to the floor, shattering into a thousand fragments. The contents spilled onto the wooden floor, he could hear the droplets seeping to the floor below them.\n\nTears ran down Robert’s face. He couldn’t even look at his own mother.\n\nShe raised her hand with all of the life she could well up, and lightly touched the cheek of her son. He looked up to meet his mother’s eyes, so lively in their eternal blueness, like the deepest blue of the seas.\n\n”Robert... this is... our... //curse//.”\n\nRobert’s mouth was agape, speechless. He wrapped his hands around his mother’s, knelt down, and looked onto her like a beggar would a man or woman in a fine suit.\n\n”Mother, stop with this madness!”\n\nShe shushed him. ”Robert... liste--”\n\n”No!” He erupted from his stance. He looked onto his mother, the tears welling up in his eyes, hands balled into fists. ”Stop with this //curse//!”\n\nShe could feel her son’s breathing, so heavy, so rapid. It pained her to see him angry, to see him sad, to see him crying.\n\nRobert calmed down again. He hadn’t stepped through the door yet, so that meant he wasn’t too angry with her, that he was still willing to listen.\n\nShe curled her lips once again: ”My father died in the War... my mother died when he never came back... Your father died when he went down an alley he shouldn’t have.”\n\nRobert wiped away his tears. The sleeves were soaking.\n\n”We are the Chetfords, Robert. //This// is our curse. //To die a young death.//”\n\nHe didn’t say anything. He couldn’t say anything.

There were rumors prevailing of his father sinning, going out every night to meet another woman in dark alleyways.\n\nWhen he died, the kids told to each other that God had punished him, to die alone in another one of his alleys, stabbed by some low-life criminal; when the authorities found him, they didn’t find anything stolen, or maybe he didn’t have anything on him.\n\nMoney got sparse after that.\n\nAs a kid, he was told stories of his grandfather. The hero, fighting for his country, dying on the battlefield as many men did during that time. But it was a death with honor, a death with pride. His grandmother died of a heart attack, regardless of how honorable it supposedly was.\n\nAnd now his mother. Sometimes, when he returned late after midnight, he would peep into his mother’s room, to see if she was okay -- he could see the flies on the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, on her face. But when he turned the light on, there wasn’t anything. The buzzing of the flies would suddenly cease to be.\n\nHe loved his mother. He tried to save her. But without much money, he couldn’t afford a doctor, he couldn’t afford the medicine.\n\nHe cried for hours.

Only a few shines broke through, but they were miles away from where Robert was standing.\n\nHe was standing in front of a small headstone, the elements having corroded away whatever once stood on the granite block. A flower was in his hand, one he had plucked from the side of the road on his way here.\n\n”Mother has been getting more sick lately,” Robert said to the headstone. He took a long pause. ”Not much more than that...”\n\nHis head tilted down. He realized he was wearing his suit. A smile formed on his face. ”Oh, and your suit fits me fine, father.” He gave off a light chuckle. It quieted down again.\n\nRobert held back the tears. He wiped as many of them away as he could, but they kept on coming.\n\n”I miss you, father. I wish when I come up here I had something better to say, but I--I...”\n\nHe fell silent again. ”Happy birthday, father. Hope you are doing well.”\n\nHe placed the flower on the top of his father’s headstone, looking at the petals move in the breeze. He turned to the exit, when suddenly there was a silhouette in the corner of his vision appearing and vanishing soon again.\n\nHis instincts told him to look, but when he did, he saw nothing there -- only a few green bushes.\n\nJust as he was about to write it off as a figment of his imagination, the silhouette appeared again, and Robert turned his head faster now. Again, there was nothing there, but for a few tall-standing trees.\n\n[[=]]\n//##transparent|”Robert.”##//\n[[/=]]\n\nA shiver went down his spine. He could have sworn the wind had whispered his name.\n\nThe silhouette appeared for a final time, and Robert turned behind him to be met with the shape of his father, wearing the exact same suit he was wearing, multiple red stains and wounds adorning his chest and arms.\n\nRobert stood there, unable to move, unable to breathe, as his eyes could not avert their gaze at the sight of his own father, //exactly// the way he had appeared on his death.\n\nThe shape retreated into the foliage, appearing to not even touch the ground, and muttering something incomprehensible. Robert felt his mucles tense up, as he sprinted after the figure, the leaves scraping against his skin.\n\nHe followed the figure for what felt like hours, the foliage and plant growth seeming to try to hold him back.\n\nEventually, the growths diminshed. An empty patch of grass revealed itself to him. His eyes darted all around, but he found no trace of the figure of his father.\n\nInstead, what he found was a leather-bound book, looking new and pristine, as if just having come out of the press, its surface smooth, laced with an intricate zinc pattern, reflecting the little moonlight there was.\n\nHis curiosity piqued, he grasped the book and held it firmly in his hands. Despite its appearance, the book was practically weightless, no more than a chicken’s feather or a pebble.\n\nRobert smelled the scent of some perfume emanating from the pages, reminding him of the ones his mother used to have.\n\nWhen he turned back, he found himself back at where he had started, back at the cemetery, with no time having passed at all. Waving it off as just a figment of his imagination, Robert held onto the book and made his way back to the exit.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nRobert rushed back into his home, the book under his arm. He was soaking wet, as a storm had decided to give its gift of water from the grey clouds. Peculiar enough, though, the book didn’t seem to be wet at all, as dry as the desert. Robert was too annoyed to notice.\n\nOnce inside, Robert hurried upstairs, his steps leaving wet stains on the floor and carpet, at least in the areas, which hadn’t been hit by the leaks.\n\nPassing his mother’s bedroom, he peeped inside -- she was deep asleep within her bed, the shudders tightly shut on the far side. He quickly closed the door again.\n\nThe door to his bedroom made a quiet //click// as he closed it shut behind him. He placed the leather-bound book onto his desk, the little light there was just being barely enough. Robert didn’t even change his clothes, as he pushed a chair up toward the desk, its brittle legs scraping against the floorboards.\n\nA combination of sweat and drops of water from his wet hair, accompanied by his rapid heartbeat, his arms shaking, and the light being dimmer than he remembered, prevented him from opening the book immediately.\n\nThere was a part of himself that whispered to him to not open the book, to toss it into the fire, bring it back to wherever he had found it. He didn’t know if it belonged to anyone -- somebody might be looking for it.\n\nBut it looked to be worth a lot. He might be able to sell it for whatever it was worth, and //might as well look what’s within, when he was going to sell it, right?//\n\nHis fingers rested lightly upon the book‘s edge, the odor of roses dissipating, overtaken by the sensation of dust filling his nose and lungs. He coughed loudly, but felt the sensation leaving his body soon after.\n\nThe book flung open. Whether it was because of his own movement or something else he couldn’t place during all his coughing.\n\nThe pages were just as pristine as they looked from the exterior. Black letters were written in such delicacy that Robert couldn’t help himself, but trace the outlines of them with his fingers.\n\nHis eyes were transfixed on the letters, the structures of sentences boring themselves into his mind.\n\nThey told of a //process//. A process beyond the laws of man, beyond the laws of nature, of even He Himself. A path for eternal youth, to be immune from all ailments, all injury, all wars and plagues, destruction and death itself.\n\nRobert could feel himself being reinvigorated. New life in his body, his cells, his soul.\n\nHe quickly closed the book again, a large cloud of dust settling into his room. He stood up, stepped away, and began to feel dizzy from all the movement.\n\nRough shapes and outlines of his room spun around him, as he leaned up against the wall to steady himself. As time passed, he found himself back in his room again. He looked upon the book, its zinc outlines shining in the dim light, while the storm raged outside.\n\n//I shall burn it, get a chest and sink it to the bottom of the sea. This book shall never see the light of day ever agai--//\n\nThen the most agonizing scream a son could ever picture jolted him awake. It took a few seconds for him to start running to his mother’s bedroom. He nearly stumbled and fell to the floor on the short way there, his hand nearly missing the corroded brass door handle.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nRobert sprinted to his mother, his footsteps so loud that he thought that the very ground beneath him might come apart. He turned on the bedside lamp to see his mother’s face.\n\n”Mother! Mother!”\n\nHis mother was coiling and twitching within her bed, her limbs spazzing out in all directions, her chest rummaging up and down, as if something was shaking her soul. Her eyes were closed, tears streaming through the lids, as she screamed from the bottom of her lungs.\n\nRobert was looking all around, grasping his head, breathing heavily, while he went up and down. The soul-piercing screams of his mother nearly deafened him.\n\nWith no other resolve, Robert took his mother by the shoulders and shook her, ’til she awoke. He tried his best to be forceful, but not harm his mother’s frail body. ”MOTHER! It’s me, mother!”\n\nThe screaming ceased. She opened her eyes to stare at her son, who was still tense, but more at ease now. ”S--son...”\n\n”It’s me, mother. Everything is fine again.” He hugged his mother with a tight grasp. They looked into each others’ eyes again.\n\n”What happened?” Robert asked.\n\nShe stared absent-mindedly to the floor, unable, //no//, un//willing// to recount the events in her mind.\n\n”Please, tell me, mother,” he begged.\n\nShe stared back into his eyes; what little life remained in them was completely overshadowed by the absolute terror reflecting in the darkness.\n\n”I saw... death. Reaching... its hand out at me...” She looked at him with the most fearful eyes Robert had ever seen. Like a piglet before slaughter. ”And I saw your father, Robert. By all that is holy... I saw him.”\n\nNow it was her who hugged her son. Robert just stood there, held his mother in his arms, //so weightless//, and stared into the darkness. Her sobs and sniffs permeated through the room, as his mind wandered.

The large metal door was heavy standing between him inside and the doctors outside. The footsteps stopped in front of the door, as the shadows of the people stretched out from underneath the door.\n\nThe head doctor spoke: ”Mr. Robert Chetford, a man who believes he has been cursed to become concrete, and is immortal in the process. Ain’t that dazzling?”\n\nA few snickers from the crowd. Robert paid them no mind.\n\n”Mr. Chetford?” it suddenly rang out in his ears. He looked up again, his neck stiff, his eyes trained to the barren floor.\n\n”I can hear you.”\n\nThe doctor chuckled. ”Well, I’m glad to know your ear wax hasn’t turned into concrete slurry.”\n\nThere was a brief pause. Robert just ignored the doctor’s words.\n\n”I swear, if it weren’t for his delusion, he’d be a great mime! The greatest around, even!”\n\nEven more snickers this time.

The tree branches bristled in the autumn breeze, but what it felt like, he couldn’t place his mind on.\n\nMany things had happened since that night in 1915 -- his insitutionalization, his capture by this //’Foundation’//, this room he found himself in, a mere imitation. There were metal birds flying through the sky, marking their path with white trails; iron horses so foreign from the ones he knew that he thought them alien. But the clouds and the sky had remained the same over all these decades.\n\nHe gave off a long exhale, but couldn’t feel his lungs move -- he put no mind to the matter. His exhale slowly turned into a light chuckle, one he had not felt in decades.\n\nHis chuckle was due to the book, and whatever inherited it, controlled it, or caused it to behave the way it did -- such an otherwordly being, an entity from the great beyond, older than the universe itself, even defying the great Lord’s rules, had come to curse such a lowly man like him.\n\nHe thought that whatever it was had altered the curse to make it act slower, to spite him, to punish him longer than it did his mother; that such an entity would be about such madness of a single act of defiance of a man like him made him chuckle.\n\nHis chuckle quieted down.\n\nHe’d like to think that, //maybe//, when it was all done, that he could look out the window one final time, before these old eyes finally dried and set like the rest of him. //Maybe//, when the last words left his lips, he’d be concrete all over, and break away like he should’ve so long ago.\n\nIf he waited long enough.
