This correlation is believed to arise from the ventilation shaft formerly connected to the Assistant Director of Research’s office, which now leads to an indeterminate point within SCP-4379 several kilometres above the ground; however, it is unlikely the generator is sustaining the anomaly’s atmosphere, or is doing so with the assistance of an ectoentropic anomaly.[[footnote]]From the //Foundation Handbook of Terms//: ‘**Ectoentropic** (adj.): violates the first and/or second law of thermodynamics by generating matter and/or energy in a fashion that directly violates entropy.’[[/footnote]]\n\nThe biodiversity of SCP-4379 consists entirely of seven endemic species of flora, all genetically related to species found on Earth; of these //Pinus cembra// var. //lunae//[[footnote]]Closest related to //Pinus cembra//, the Stone pine.[[/footnote]] is the only non-grass species present.

Inspection of the FAM-32 reactor confirmed it was functioning at full capacity for the entire period, however all produced power was being drawn to an unknown source; a search of Lunar Area-32 for the source resulted in the discovery of SCP-4379.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Exploration Audio Log Transcript**\n\n**Exploration Team:** Distributed Task Force Sigma-6 Division 9 (‘Spacemen’)\n\n**Team Lead:** D-6 ‘Roller’\n\n**Team Members:** \nD-7 ‘Skywalker’\nD-8 ‘Buzz’\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Roller:** Microphones on?\n\n**Buzz:** Yep.\n\n**Roller:** I want it on the record that we’re trained for general security, not melting realities, so the moment the freaky stuff starts we’re bailing.\n\n**Skywalker** (distant, via Buzz’s microphone): Blondies should’ve gotten this, not us.\n\n**Roller:** Fix your mic Skywalker, it’s not coming through.\n\n//Crackling feedback.//\n\n**Skywalker** (distorted): Wah, wah…\n\n**Buzz:** Still buggered.\n\n**Skywalker** (distorted): Oh for…\n\n//Crackling feedback.//\n\n**Skywalker:** How about now?\n\n**Roller:** Perfect.

If we’re getting stuff erased, we can’t find out until we’re back, and there’s no point in doubting ourselves. Do you have a better idea?\n\n**Buzz:** No sir.\n\n**Roller:** Then can it, both of you.

Big first mission, and it seems to be going fine thus far.\n\n**Roller:** What are you thinking of?\n\n**Skywalker:** I reckon we crack open some cold ones with the D’s. Maybe then Winston will stop thinking enough for me to beat him at cards.\n\n**Buzz:** You know he cheats, right?\n\n**Skywalker:** What? How?\n\n**Roller:** You know that pack of cards Dianne won off Buzz last year? The D-classes have been sharing it around; they all cheat, if they’re good at it.\n\n**Skywalker:** Why the hell wouldn’t you take it off them?\n\n**Roller:** Three reasons.

Anything out of the ordinary?\n\n**Skywalker:** Other than the fact that nothing happened, nope.\n\n**Roller:** Nobody got killed?\n\n**Skywalker:** No.\n\n**Roller:** No pursuits by a primordial curb-stomping deity?\n\n**Buzz:** Not that I recall.\n\n**Roller:** We just… came in, took some samples, wandered around, left?\n\n**Skywalker:** That sums it up.\n\n//A moment’s silence.//\n\n**Roller:** Well then.

These abnormalities have consistently reoccurred in all samples taken from within SCP-4379.\n\nIn agreeance with Ethics Committee Liaison Devlin Winston, these details have been classified in the interest of maintaining on-site morale, and preventing unwarranted speculation or overreactions as demonstrated by MTF Sigma-6 Division-9 Agents 6 (‘Roller’), 7 (‘Skywalker’) and 8 in the first exploratory log for SCP-4379.\n\nThe surface of SCP-4379 is uniformly covered in a thin layer of dead human skin cells. \n\nSoil and stone samples taken from throughout SCP-4379 universally contain traces of human DNA in varying states of decomposition, and are significantly composed of decayed and/or compacted human faecal matter.\n\nWater samples taken from throughout SCP-4379 universally contain traces of human DNA and contain evidence to suggest they are, or formerly were, predominantly composed of human saliva, sweat, and/or urine.\n\nAll DNA samples recovered from SCP-4379 match, but do not match records in any databases accessible to the Foundation.\n\nAnalysis of the aforementioned faecal matter suggests the source subsists on a diet consisting exclusively of the flora found within SCP-4379, predominantly the seeds of //Pinus cembra// var. //lunae//.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=Home\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Hover to enlarge.\n]]\nOn February 8, 2017, the members of a Mobile Task Force engaging in a week-long exploration into SCP-4379 reported discovering a single building south-south-west of the main entrance to SCP-4379 (with ‘north’ being assigned to the direction the entrance of SCP-4379 is facing). A photograph is attached.\n\nThe building was comprised entirely from materials found within SCP-4379, predominantly stone, and showed strong evidence of having been inhabited at an indeterminate point. Numerous stone tablets were found throughout, all of which were engraved with text that appears to be a heavily degraded dialect of, or linguistic descendant of, modern English.\n\nSeveral rooms throughout the building were devoted entirely to the storage of large quantities of //Pinus cembra// var. //lunae// seeds.\n\nSeveral members of staff have reported seeing glimpses of a ‘man in black clothing, mid-stride’ approaching the entrance of SCP-4379 from the interior. Comparison of the reported locations of the entity (now designated as SCP-4379-A) in consideration with physical proximity strongly suggests that the entity has approached / is approaching / will approach the entrance of SCP-4379 in an asynchronous order; SCP-4379-A has not yet been sighted outside of SCP-4379.\n[!--Throughout the history of Lunar Area-32, staff have intermittently reported seeing glimps{{[DATA CORRUPT]}}arious locations throughout the facility.
