For some reason, this office has been abandoned, left, forgotten, at the end of the corridor to fester. It doesn't look like no one's been here for ages, rather, it looks clean and orderly. You chalk it up to the janitor just doing their job and remembering to clean the place.//\n\n//The dresser in the corner of the room catches your eye. You approach the forgotten dresser. It's odd and out of place, with splatters of paint and scratches marring it's surface. A large \"37\" is scratched onto its side.//\n\n//Curious, you pull open the first drawer. A worn drawer, with a couple scratches and nicks. Inside, its littered with random pieces of paper. There's a message scratched onto the bottom of the drawer, \"å¤¢\". you rifle through them below.//\n\n//The first thing you see is a sticky note on top of all the papers inside.//\n\n> --some-- most of the drawings in here are just too massive to shove in here so you're gonna have to stretch out your little fingers and unwrap them, 'kay?
