This operation was designed by Dr. ████ and Agent ████████, as they theorized that from observations made of SCP-2770-1, divorcing it from any notable source of water would both render SCP-2770-2 incapable of manifesting, and remove SCP-2770-1's ability to retreat back into the water.\n> \n> The operation was divided into three parts:\n> \n> # Gamma-6 would locate and then lift SCP-2770-1 from the water via a modified Mi-26 (operating name: \"Lifeguard\") equipped with a hooking device created specifically for the operation.\n> # With SCP-2770-1 hooked, Lifeguard would then transport SCP-2770-1 to Site ██, a secure location in the hyper-arid ████████ Desert.\n> # Once arrived, Gamma-6 personnel would take custody of SCP-2770-1, well isolated from any possible source of water.\n> \n> On █/█/████, Operation Kiddie Pool commenced at ████ hours. At the time of the operation, SCP-2770-1 was being tracked off the coast of southern Norway, and was intercepted by Lifeguard thirty minutes, twelve seconds after the commencement of the operation. SCP-2770-1 was attached to the hook without any difficulties and lifted out of the water with no appearance by SCP-2770-2.\n> \n> Six hours, seventeen minutes later, Lifeguard arrived at Site ██, delivering SCP-2770-1 into its custody. SCP-2770-1 surrendered itself with no struggle, and SCP-2770-2 failed to manifest. Operation Kiddie Pool was deemed a success.\n> \n> \n> \n> An interrogation was conducted one week later. SCP-2770-1 had not escaped custody with its previously recorded anomalous abilities, and had been generally cooperative with staff at Site ██. Transcript of video will now follow:\n> \n> [SCP-2770-1 is escorted into the room by two Gamma-6 personnel and sits down to a chair across from Agent ████████]\n> \n> **Agent ████████:** Hello, SCP-2770-1.\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** Hello, sir. Once again, I cannot tell you how grateful I am for the rescue with your crazy hoverin' plane. I've been stranded out there for...I don't know how long.\n> \n> **Agent ████████:** We're always glad to help. So, SCP-2770-1, do you have a name?\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** I do, sir. Lieutenant Edward Rowling, Royal Navy, at your service.\n> \n> **Agent ████████:**  I see. What year do you think this is? Your uniform is quite out of date.\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** [rubs neck] I...do not know. Truth be told, the months and years just started to meld together after a while. And apologies about my uniform, I'll admit it's seen better days.\n> \n> **Agent ████████:** About your days melding together. What can you tell me about SCP-2770-2?\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** Come again?\n> \n> **Agent ████████:** The submarine. We have records of you being rescued by ships, only for them to be attacked by a broken-down sub that shouldn't even be able to move. \n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** Oh. //That thing.//\n> \n> [SCP-2770-1 leans in]\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** Well.\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** I think...\n> \n> **Agent ████████:** You think what?\n> \n> **SCP-2770-1:** I think you forgot about the water table, you fucking idiot.\n> \n> [What appears to be the conning tower of SCP-2770-2 erupts in the middle of the interrogation room. The hatch immediately opens, followed by a total loss of communication with Site ██.]\n> \n> **END TRANSCRIPT**\n\n> MTF dispatched to Site ██ finds the facility missing. Orbital assets confirm that at the time of communication loss, Site ██ was pulled in its entirety under the sand. Recovery teams present detect no traces of the facility with subterranean imaging, and all staff are presumed KIA.\n> \n> After this event, SCP-2770-1 did not appear for another █ years.\n> \n> Foundation secure site protocols now in full review. \n> \n> SCP-2770 reclassification to Keter pending.\n> \n> **END INCIDENT REPORT**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
