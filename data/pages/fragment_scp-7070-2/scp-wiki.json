SCP-7070 is subject to routine maintenance and upkeep on a weekly basis to ensure secure transmission and storage of information. \n\nFoundation archivists and automated web-crawlers are to search SCP-7070 for instances of SCP-7070-1. Once discovered, documents are to be logged, researched, and ritualistically scrubbed from the network via thaumaturgy. A series of mock-servers have been created to automatically quarantine SCP-7070-1 following their creation.\n\nAll Foundation sites are to maintain a primary and backup connection to SCP-7070.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=13\n|speed=400\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=45% \n|url=http://smlt.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Adysadune2/hogslice3.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Example of SCP-7070-1 infected documentation. Corruption highlighted in yellow -- hover / click to zoom.\n]]\n\n**Description:**  SCP-7070 is the SCiPNET network, the database containing the totality of the SCP Foundation’s knowledge. Established in 1960 as a way to digitize and preserve Foundation records, SCP-7070 has progressed into the organization's primary means of cross-site communication, with every Secure Facility possessing a connection to SCP-7070. \n\nSCP-7070’s servers possess storage capabilities far beyond what their specifications should allow. Presently, the network hosts over 500 petabytes of information, a number that has grown exponentially each year. It is unknown if there is an upper limit to the amount of data SCP-7070 can process and store. SCiPNET servers are responsible for hosting:\n* Files on every anomaly documented by the Foundation, of which there are, as of 2048, over 30,000;\n* A complete database of research papers and lab work carried out by the Foundation;\n* Private and public channels for site to site communication, including an email network, a messaging service, and a record of every communication between Foundation personnel through SCP-7070;\n* Over 50,000 extensive profiles on all Foundation personnel employed since the organization’s inception;\n* 3,000,000 extensive profiles on persons-of-interest and anomalous individuals across the world;\n* Access to the internet, with the ability to manipulate and process information on a world-wide scale due to Foundation back-ends in major networks and the use of web-crawlers;\n* An automated backup of all information contained within, with frequent integrity checks to prevent data corruption over time;\n\nSCP-7070-1 refers to documents in SCP-7070 of unknown origin. SCP-7070-1 usually take the form of SCP files, and describe entirely fictitious objects, events, persons, and information. These documents are often accompanied by falsified or otherwise impossible metadata, such as edits by non-existent Foundation personnel. While the majority of SCP-7070-1 are incomprehensible in composition, there are a number of motifs and thorough lines consistent across all such documents. The predominant motif is a mention of the “Black Moon”, a phrase of ill-defined significance and meaning. \n\nSCP-7070-1 documents, if left unattended, will corrupt and alter data within SCP-7070, bypassing built-in edit authorization software. Alterations can occur seconds after the creation of an SCP-7070-1 instance; these range from slight changes in naming conventions or numbers, to large falsifications of entire events and objects within the files of existing ones. Removal of an SCP-7070-1 instance cannot be performed through manual deletion, as doing so will create another identical instance in its place. Permanent deletion is presently only possible through the completion of a thaumaturgic ritual. \n\nOver 10,000 instances of SCP-7070-1 are created daily, a number that has been increasing yearly since the phenomenon’s discovery in 2030. As such, extensive research into SCP-7070-1 is limited due to exhaustion of Foundation resources.\n\n**Addendum 01 -- History of SCP-7070-1 Countermeasures:** In 2030, SCP-7070’s Head Technician, Thomas Holden, sent the following memo to the overseer council:\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** O5-council@SCiP.NET\n**From:** T-holden@SCiP.NET\n**Subject:** Help Needed: SCP-7070-1 \n[[/div]]\n------\nGreetings Overseers,\n\nThe SCP-7070 technical research team is happy to report that employing a duo of on-site thaumaturgists seems to be an active containment solution for the SCP-7070-1 file situation. At the current rate of 10 instances generated per day, we’ve seemed to work out a doable balance when it comes to logging and exorcising them in a timely fashion. Any alterations are easily flagged and reverted minutes later, and we can safely say that the technical backbone of the Foundation has been spared from any lasting damage to its infrastructure. \n\nOf course, there is still room to investigate any potential causes of SCP-7070-1’s manifestations, an avenue we feel is worth looking into due to the potential security risks within the Foundation’s own network. With your permission, the team would like to begin testing on the SCiPNET servers in an attempt to uncover more in-depth information about the Black Moon documents. We’ve sent you dozens of research proposals, and we hope that our technical mastery will inspire confidence that this team is capable of fielding storms without sinking the ship.\n\nRegards,\nT. Holden\n//SCiPNET Head Technician//\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the O5 council’s approval, the SCP-7070-1 research team performed a series of tests to discern more information about the anomaly. Their results have been included below.\n\n||= **Date** ||= **Proposal** ||= **Result**||\n||2030/10/13 || Introduce a web-crawler with the capability of performing a techno-thaumaturgic ritual similar to the one used to exorcise SCP-7070-1 instances. || Initial success. One week later, SCP-7070-1 instance production increased from 10 per 24 hours to 50. Web-crawler is barely capable of keeping up with added workload.||\n||2031/4/04 ||Introduce scripts that automatically redirect SCP-7070-1 files to a quarantine server detached from SCP-7070. || Failure. Files still affect SCP-7070’s data regardless of where they have been redirected. Instance production is increased from 50 per 24 hours to 175. Testing halted. ||\n||2033/8/23 || Introduce web-crawlers to place a blacklist filter on new documentation containing phrases found in SCP-7070-1. || Failure. Filters detect file creation, but are unable to prevent SCP-7070-1 instances from appearing on the network. Instance production increases from 175 to 330 per 24 hours.||\n||2034/11/02 ||SCP-7070 server wipe. Maintenance installing entirely new hardware over a period of three days is carried out. Backups of SCP-7070 servers, free from -1 instances, are downloaded.|| Failure. SCP-7070-1 instances continue to manifest. Instance production increases from 330 to 650 per 24 hours. Testing halted permanently.||\n\nFollowing the attempt to reconstruct SCP-7070’s servers anew, SCP-7070-1 instances began manifesting in increasing intensity without Foundation prompting, usually in an increment of one additional instance per day. \n\nOn 2036/08/29, Head Technician Thomas Holden wrote a petition to Overseer O5-13 regarding SCP-7070. It has been reproduced below.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** O5-council@SCiP.NET\n**From:** T-holden@SCiP.NET\n**Subject:** Help Needed: SCP-7070-1 \n[[/div]]\n------\nGreetings Overseers,\n\nWe’re struggling. We stopped fighting years ago, when we realized that meddling with SCP-7070 increased the amount of -1 instances, but even though we’ve stopped, the anomaly hasn’t let up.\n\nEven with the increased funding, the covenants of thaumaturgists inhabiting Site-03, the hundreds of webcrawlers, and the revolving door of personnel on my team, we are losing.\n\nWhen we’re not too exhausted to talk, we’ve been throwing around ideas. Destroying Site-03, rebuilding SCiPNET from the ground up, forgoing the idea of our own privatized network entirely. It’s all very grand, but when our greatest paracyber technology is unable to handle something as superficially simple as a self-sustaining virus, we’re left with remarkably little options. \n\nSome of them want to toss an .AIC at it, maybe one that could do all of our jobs for us. The searching, the logging, the ritual. Others feel there’s a solution in cross testing SCP-7070 with other objects. I’m not in a position to authorize that.\n\nPlease, Overseer, if you haven’t already, present our dilemma before the Council. It may be time to accept that SCiPNET is compromised. \n\nRegards,\nT. Holden\n//SCiPNET Head Technician//\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** T-holden@SCiP.NET\n**From:** O5-13@SCiP.NET\n**Subject:** Re: Help Needed: SCP-7070-1 \n[[/div]]\n------\nThomas, I appreciate the difficult position you’re in, I really do. Frankly though, our resources are stretched enough as it is. Whilst we appreciate the criticality of accurate information to our organization, database corruption – no matter how severe – will not take precedence in the race for time and resources over teams and units dealing with tangible anomalies in need of containment. \n\nIf some of your men think an .AIC is a valid solution, let’s test it out. There’s been talk for a while about implementing a construct to manage the entirety of SCiPNET.  I’ll forward you the details you’ll be privy to. Expect an invitation to a more thorough conference soon enough. While I’m more than convinced that this is a potential solution, there still remain some persistent issues that I would prefer to discuss in a different medium.\n\nSophia\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Addendum 02 -- SCP-7070-1 Volumes:** Following response from O5-13, the SCiPNET team has begun design of an .AIC capable of both managing SCP-7070 and hypothetically containing SCP-7070-1 documents. The AIC has yet to be implemented, and completion of its development is estimated to be several years in the future. \n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 66%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; width: 25%;\"]]\nYear\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; width: 75%;\"]]\nAverage daily volumes of SCP-7070-1 instances generated\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2030\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: right; border: 1px solid black; \"]]\n10\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2035\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: right; border: 1px solid black; \"]]\n700\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2040\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: right; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n1200\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2045\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: right; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2000\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n2048\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .2em .2em; text-align: right; border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n3500\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"oracle\"]]\n= [[span class=\"oraclet\"]]ORACLE[[/span]]\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 80%;  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .0em .0em; text-align: center; border: 2px solid navy; ; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[div class=\"o5\"]]\nThat's enough.
