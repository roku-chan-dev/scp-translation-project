Remote surveillance is currently maintained using Foundation submarines present in the Atlantic near the equator. All results of examinations and studies must be sent to Site-34.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=aquacat.png|caption=SCP-ES-227-A instance. Image taken during preliminary investigations.]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-227 is the designation given to an anomalous area located at the coordinates 9°39'39.9\"S 12°54'13.1\"W, in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge area of ​​the Atlantic Ocean, near the equator, at a depth of ~2500m. This area consists of an emulation of the Earth's atmosphere in a dome-like shape that covers ~6.4km^^2^^ in area; equal in pressure and composition to that of the surface, which repels seawater to the surroundings, keeping the area stable. It contains ~37,460,000m^^3^^ of breathable air.\n\nThere is, as such, no solid/distinguishable barrier separating the air from the surrounding water, and any material, object, or living being can cross the boundary of SCP-ES-227 without difficulty. Studies carried out on the edge of SCP-ES-227 indicate that the area is not affected by the oceanic pressure of the location (approximately 250 atmospheres) due to a gravitational anomaly that alters the flow of water in accordance with conventional physics, which is why water from the outside does not exert any type of weight nor does it enter SCP-ES-227.\n\nWithin SCP-ES-227, there lives a population of 438 specimens of subspecies of the wild cat (//Felis silvestris//)[[footnote]] The habitat is composed mostly of specimens of the domestic cat (//Felis silvestris catus//) and also by specimens of the European wild cat (//Felis silvestris silvestris//) and the African wild cat (//Felis silvestris lybica//).[[/footnote]] which carry out their entire life cycle //in-situ// feeding on fish, crustaceans and mollusks in the area, they are designated SCP-ES-227-A specimens.\n\nExaminations made on captured SCP-ES-227-A specimens show that they are biologically identical to specimens of //Felis silvestris// that conventionally inhabit the rest of the world. SCP-ES-227-A specimens display highly aggressive behavior towards any form of life that does not belong to the same species or is not a type of marine life.[[footnote]] Attempts to integrate drones have upset the SCP-ES-227-A instances. For more details about the behavior of SCP-ES-227-A specimens, review **Addendum ES-227-B/2** to **Addendum ES-227-B/4**.[[/footnote]]\n\n\nCurrently, it is not known how SCP-ES-227 could have originated or how the SCP-ES-227-A specimens could have appeared within it.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum ES-227-A/1:** Discovery.\n\nDuring the month of February, an anomalous aquatic species (named SCP-ES-███) was being monitored throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean, until on 02/25/2021 unconventional low-volume sound waves were detected near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the equator. Along with the latter, an analysis of the populations of marine species done weeks prior indicated a fairly slight inconsistency between the mortality rate and the proportion of predatory species, suggesting the existence of an unknown species. After observation from a pair of submarines in an area of ​​35 km^^2^^ in the area, it was possible to determine the origin of the sound waves, thus finding the location of SCP-ES-227[[footnote]] It is believed that the reason these sound waves showed a slight variation from other ocean waves is because the sound passes through a body of air before entering the water. [[/footnote]] and also explained the slight variation in the analysis.\n\n**Addendum ES-227-A/2:** Preliminary post-discovery studies.\n\nSmall-scale unmanned underwater research vehicles were used to determine the gravitational characteristics of SCP-ES-227's edge.\n\nAfter confirming its stability, it was decided to send two agents in a small-scale tactical submarine model Foxtrot-8V to enter SCP-ES-227. Upon entry, they were immediately attacked by fourteen nearby SCP-ES-227-A instances, forcing them to retreat, since they had orders not to harm the specimens.\n\nThe following month, another attempt was made to enter SCP-ES-227 by three armed agents, this time, they were accompanied by a domestic cat; Although the agents were attacked by the SCP-ES-227-A specimens, as planned, the domestic cat was ignored by the specimens, who acted peacefully in response to its presence.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum ES-227-B/1:** Research Proposal from the Ethics Committee\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n**From:** Dr. Borja Dowell\n**To:** Dir. █████████\n**Date:** 12/04/2021\n\n//**RE:** SCP-ES-227 research proposal.//\n------\n\nGreetings, director. I am speaking as a representative of the Ethics Committee to offer a proposal regarding SCP-ES-227. It was developed by the members of the committee and is presented to you for your approval.\n\nRecently, the leadership of the Anomalous Marine Biodiversity Examination Department has expressed a slightly heightened interest in an investigation of SCP-ES-227, since the department believes that an intervention by a terrestrial animal in an aquatic environment could allow the development of behaviors worthy of analysis. This is in addition to superficial observations of socially complex behaviors of SCP-ES-227-A specimens. Together they create an environment with elements that should be analyzed in order to determine exactly how it came to be and why.\n\nWe have reviewed various alternatives for intervention in the anomaly, and we reached a conclusion: The deployment of agents to capture the specimens to be contained in the Foundation or Wilson's Wildlife Solutions enclosures, although logistically possible, would be counterproductive. since it would permanently alter the behavior of the SCP-ES-227-A specimens, eliminating the aforementioned factor of interest. The same problem applies to the extraction of all the instances.\n\nIt was then when several members of the Committee considered the idea of ​​introducing a researcher who would not disturb the SCP-ES-227-A specimens; specifically, [[[SCP-ES-234]]], also referred to as \"Detective Marw\".\n\nSince his recruitment as E-Class personnel, SCP-ES-234 has proven to be a valuable resource to the Foundation, highlighting his contributions to criminology research. Having been carrying out agent and investigator activities for about a year, we can say that he is familiar with our protocols for handling information, which is why the possibility of granting him Level 3 Clearance permits on a temporary basis is being debated. His participation could be ideal for this particular case.\n\nIn this way, the resurgence of new Noir or Street events could also be prevented due to the little activity of SCP-ES-234 during the last few months.\n\nFor all that has been said, we propose SCP-ES-234 as the head researcher of SCP-ES-227.\n\nWe await your prompt response.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n**From** Dir. █████████\n**To:** Dr. Borja Dowell\n**Date:** 15/04/2021\n\n//**RE:** RE:SCP-ES-227 research proposal.//\n------\n\nDear Dr. Dowell, your proposal has been reviewed and you have approval to begin the exploration. You can start the corresponding preparations.\n\nSCP-ES-234 will be sent to the area in a reasonable time frame, weekly, you will write down all relevant information down there and will undergo periodic interviews to verify your progress. I give you the opportunity to conduct the interviews yourself.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSix days after the approval of Dr. Borja Dowell's proposal, Detective Marw was transferred to the ship //SCPS F. Giral// two kilometers away from SCP-ES-227, to begin studies of SCP-ES-227. Detective Marw responded positively to the study proposal, and was first sent to SCP-ES-227 on 04/22/2021. He was given a small notebook to record his observations.\n\n**Addendum ES-227-B/2:** SCP-ES-227-A observations by Detective Marw. Week [19/04/21-25/04/21] to Week [26/04/21 - 02/05/21].\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]] //Marw, Private Investigation//\n//Thursday, 22nd of April.//\n\n//The day before yesterday they told me that I was going to participate in an investigation of a marine phenomenon, and today I am 2 kilometers underwater; unexpected, to say the least.//\n\n//I thought I would spend a lot of time in a submarine or on a ship, but when Dowell told me about a giant air bubble, I deduced that it would be a more personal encounter. He also told me, before entering the place, that I had to take off my hat and trenchcoat, and I had to walk on four legs. Outrageous, but I understand why.//\n\n[...]\n\n//It's hard to see in this place, there's no light at all; Even if my eyes are adapted to these environments, it is still impressively dark. At first I wondered how my colleagues observed their surroundings, but it only took a few minutes to easily understand that they were guided mainly by their hearing, although without neglecting their sight. To untrained ears the enveloping sound of marine, and not so marine, life may seem somewhat overwhelming.//\n\n[...]\n\n//I'm trying to get used to the conditions of the place, and I don't think I can notice everything as easily as I like to boast about, but I can notice some peculiarities; my fellows behave much more socially with each other and with me than any other wild cat has ever done before for... survival? yes, that's what I deduced after half an hour; I noticed how a few groups of 12 hunted some large fish and shared them among themselves, very equitably.//[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//Marw, Private investigation.//\n//Thursday, 29th of April.//\n\n//I spoke for a few moments on Saturday with a ship worker to ask for some night vision goggles adapted to my size, it took a while to get them but he brought them to me; they're really useful here.//\n\n[...]\n\n//Now with more visual clarity, something that captures my interest is the hunting techniques used by these cats, they are better planned than those of other felines. They collect dozens of kilograms of food per day (which is totally understandable because they have a population of at least 500 down here). I also noticed the common preference for the use of bait in this kind of community, something that I already had the opportunity to witness on land (during the months that there was an ordinary pet cat in the place, I managed to teach her that method to get rid of of some mice).//\n\n//I saw several of the 227-A instances make perfectly synchronized movements with their legs on the edge of the \"pod\" to bring in some fish and it was... strangely effective. Then I saw other cats capturing small fish, biting them until they bled and spreading their blood in the sea water to attract larger carnivores... I think I saw a medium-sized shark which rushed furiously to the place without knowing about the body of air. which he would encounter; considerably impressive.//\n\n//I tried to replicate some tricks to get a snack, and I caught a monochromatic fish, but it was not to my taste when it came to trying it. It was my luck that I later managed to catch a bigger and better tasting crab. They are better cooked, but they are still an exquisite appetizer.//\n\n[...][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum ES-227-B/3:** Detective Marw Interview.

This case has been most interesting in these strange times.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Any particular reason?\n\n**Detective Marw:** There's no specific reason, but it somehow catches my attention, a lot.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** I see. Judging from your notes, there aren't many outstanding details other than what we've already seen.\n\n**Detective Marw:** Your assumptions are correct, dear Borja. These first two days, my observations have been more of recognition. From now on I plan to focus on its social structure. There are small details that catch my attention and I would like to go into more detail about them.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Do you have something to add?\n\n**Detective Marw:** Everything of value is in my notebook, so that's it for now. Although, if I had to add something—\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Do you feel any kind of connection to the 227-A instances?\n\n//There is a brief silence.//\n\n//Marw lights a cigarette and takes a drag of it.//\n\n**Detective Marw:** What kind of question is that, Dowell? How could I be attached to that place?\n\n//Marw takes a puff on his cigarette and blows out smoke.//\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** I never mentioned anything about getting attached.\n\n**Detective Marw:** ...You understand what I'm trying to say. My loyalty remains with the Foundation.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Good to know, Marw.\n\n**Detective Marw:** In any case, when is my next deployment?\n\n[[=]]\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum ES-227-B/4:** Detective Marw's SCP-ES-227-A logs. Week of [03/05/21 - 09/05/21] to week [17/05/21 - 23/05/21].\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//Marw, private investigation.//\n//Thursday, 6th of May.//\n\n[...]\n\n//Getting closer is becoming easier, I deduced with a few glances that the signs are the same as those used by normal cats with the difference that the responses seem more complex. The displays of affection are continuous between them and seem to be concentrated in certain groups. They develop different deals and connections between them to communicate in a globalized way.//\n\n//I spotted what could be considered work areas, there are cats that specialize in hunting (mostly males) while others are in charge of distributing food between groups (mostly females). The most important thing is the... you could call them \"social groups\", \"fraternities\" or \"families\", a dozen kitties get together and maintain a united and highly emotional group. These groups establish hierarchies with \"leaders\" who distribute food and allow communication with other groups.//\n\n//But not all social contact is maintained within these groups, each individual instance likes to form \"friendships\" or \"hunting groups\" with other kittens that are not from their main group, friendships of two or three cats that meet to play or fool around with each other... and groups that dedicate most of their time to hunting.//\n\n//It's almost as if a real society has been founded down here.//\n\n[...] [[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//Marw, private investigation.//\n//Thursday, 13th of May.//\n\n//To continue studying the cat society of 227, I tried to integrate myself into their playing and hunting activities. I admit that they are entertaining, but I did not deviate from my objective.//\n\n[…]\n\n//I noticed something that indicates that the instances are even more intelligent than I assumed, as they have developed structures. I had written all my records while being in the east of 227, but today I decided to take a few hours to cross the entire area until I reached the southwest; and there I discovered a behavior that I had not seen before.//\n\n//It was simple, the cats dug a hole that was not very deep, but very wide in the ground, and then they used part of the earth and sand to build small walls that they hardened with some water. They used the area to keep small litters of 5 or 6 sleeping cats.//\n\n//It is clear that they learn and evolve over time, I almost certainly see that this behavior could extend to all SCP-ES-227-A specimens, I am excited to see it, too.//\n\n[…]\n\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//Marw, private investigation.//\n//Thursday, 20th of May.//\n\n//When I saw those structures in the southwest of 227, I didn't think about it, but the question came to me the next day, why in the southwest and not in the east? And there, a conclusion was reached, culture by geography.//\n\n//Absurd to think? Yes, very much so, but all the more plausible the more I consider it. I decided to move north, and I paid as much attention as I could to the actions of the kittens. And my idea was correct, different behavior. The cats of the southwest and east (by extension, south, southeast and west) were affectionate, they dedicated much of their time to playing and sharing affection; but in the north, they were somewhat more solitary, and spent much more time grooming themselves. Here there are no friendships or fraternities, only families of the same lineage stay together, even when hunting.//\n\n//In the south, cats showed a preference for hunting fish, but in the north, shellfish and mollusks were more coveted. I reaffirm my hypothesis of culture by geography, even if it is on a reduced scale.//\n\n//In the north, I didn't see any burrow construction, so I think it's something that has recently started to develop in those cats in the southwest.//\n\n[...][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[size 90%]]//Marw, private investigation.//\n//Sunday, 23rd of May.//\n\n[...]\n\n//Knowing that tomorrow is my monthly interview with Borja, I decided to review 227's documents for a while. I stopped at the section detailing the studies of the edge of the area, and analyzing carefully, I came to a catastrophic conclusion.//\n\n//I find it more appropriate to explain it directly to Dowell tomorrow, as I need to make a suggestion.//\n\n[...][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum ES-227-B/5:** Evaluation Interview with Detective Marw. [Month of May]\n\n[[div class=\"yeklog\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**INTERVIEW ES-227/A/S34/37890 — 24/05/2021 - 09:42**\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**Interviewer/s:** Dr. Borja Dowell\n\n**Interviewee/s:** Detective Marw\n\n------\n[[=]]\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n\n//Introductions redacted for brevity.//\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** I read your latest notes, Marw. What did you want to discuss today?\n\n**Detective Marw:** Your reading saves me preambles, I appreciate it. I need to report a problem and suggest something about it, about 227's containment.\n\n//Marw approaches the doctor and sits a half a meter away from him.//\n\n**Detective Marw:** I decided to take a look at the report made on the limits that make up the anomaly, this led me to several hypotheses and an inescapable fact; The air present in 227 is not unlimited, and will eventually run out, likewise, it is possible that the collapse of the gravitational phenomenon will follow and ending the anomaly as such. Although it must also be clarified, the 227-A specimens will end up poisoning their environment within a not so distant future.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** How do you figure?\n\n**Detective Marw:** Elementary, dear Dowell. In a reduced environment that imitates our planet, it is not surprising that they also leave a carbon footprint and, consequently, deal with their own greenhouse effect. Air quality deteriorates over time and with it all 227-A specimens will perish.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Yes, the Department of Marine Biodiversity proposed a similar idea originally. So do you have any suggestions?\n\n**Detective Marw:** I propose the extraction of all SCP-ES-227-A specimens and their containment in specially conditioned enclosures.\n\n//There is a brief silence.//\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Marw, you know that—\n\n//Marw interrumpts him.//\n\n**Detective Marw:** I think it could be adapted, I know of enclosures of up to three thousand square meters at Site-34, and it could perfectly accommodate just under four hundred and fifty cats in one of them. They could be left in complete darkness and given a sandy floor so as not to break their habit, which would be economically and logistically affordable.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** But—\n \n**Detective Marw:** I know you're thinking about how to feed them, but it's actually simple; If the Foundation can feed lunch to the twelve million two hundred thousand Foundation employees in Europe alone, couldn't it feed a few hundred kittens?\n\n//Another brief silence.//\n\n**Detective Marw:** Any conclusion, Dowell?\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** May I ask where this altruism is coming from?\n\n**Detective Marw:** A detective is still a public servant, even to other species.\n\n//Dowell thinks quietly for a moment.//\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Chapter II, article 16; \"The Foundation will spend a fraction of its resources on the preservation of anomalous or native species from anomalous environments or their transfer through bureaucratic action, partially or totally ceding containment responsibilities as required.\"\n\n**Dr. Marw:** What's that from?\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** A fragment of the Boring agreement. If anything is to be done about 227-A, it must be based on prescribed regulations.\n\n//Marw moves a little closer to Dowell.//\n\n**Detective Marw:** If it's any incentive, we also need to mention the problem of dealing with future bodies in the ocean. The idea of ​​removal is also intended to safeguard the veil.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** That sounds reasonable.\n \n**Detective Marw:** The only thing that causes me some sadness is that these traces of developing civilization are lost. I wonder what could have happened to them in other conditions.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** If it comforts you, there is still a chance that they will retain their usual behavior in the appropriate enclosure.\n\n**Detective Marw:** Unlikely, but maybe.\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Very well then, Marw, I will make the request to the Ethics Committee and the Containment Department of Site-34, surely there I will reach director Jacobo Merlín. Anything else to say?\n\n**Detective Marw:** Thank you, Borja. \n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Not a problem.\n\n**Detective Marw:** Care for a smoke after this interview?\n\n**Dr. Dowell:** Why not.\n\n[[=]]\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n**Addendum ES-227-C/1:** Proposal to restructure Special Containment Procedures.\n\nOn 05/01/2021, Dr. Borja Dowell proposed the capture and transfer of all SCP-ES-227-A specimens to Site-34 for permanent containment in Natural Enclosure #062 with slight adaptations, due to to the expected collapse of SCP-ES-227 within the next few years.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea of ​​extracting all the air contained in SCP-ES-227 after the new containment of the SCP-ES-227-A specimens is proposed, eliminating SCP-ES-227 and reclassifying the SCP-ES-227 specimens. 227-A as Safe Class or Eparch Class objects.[[footnote]] Pending review by the Classifications Committee.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe first proposal was approved by the Containment Committee and Director Jacobo Merlín on 05/09/2021 and operation planning for the activity has begun.
