All with the same protagonist experiencing her own life in ways she wishes would never happen.\n\nEventually, this will clock down to my 001 proposal. After posting that, I plan on leaving the site and leaving this series up for people to add their own stories, in a respectful way of course.\n\nThank you,\n\n[[>]]\n- Troutmaskreplica\n[[/>]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
