She's the newbie of her team, but pulls tries to pull her weight. In the spin-off comic //Coaltion! Casefile!//, [# she's the point of view of the central storyline], and serves as the introduction to The Coalition storyline in Crumbling Foundation.\n\n\n++ Gameplay\n\nSpider is a Marksman class character, with the subclass thaumaturge. Her playstyle involves focusing on one target with intense ranged damage, while buffing herself and her allies with thaumaturgy. Her optimal gameplay loop involves intially buffing herself with her //Lucky Break// ability, which prevents status effects.  The engaging in ranged fire, triggering the bleed status effect. This then allows her to activate her //Part Effects Whole// ability, which stunlocks the targeted enemy for fifteen seconds, allowing to have interrupted ranged damage for that period of time. When damaged, she can use //Thaumaturgic Healing// to heal herself and allies.\n\n+ Trivia\n\n* Stated to be transgender through several dialogue interactions with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fandation/offset/2 Princess Meri], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fandation/offset/1 Nurse Glass] and [# Clef]. It's implied she used magic to transition.\n* Was originally a starting character for Girls Occult Coalition, a sister project to Foundation Crumbling, but after budgeting issues, several characters were folded into FC, including Ara Fang.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#3a3a3a;font-weight:bold;\"]]9 comments[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user moto42]] sillypilled · 3/31/2025\n\neveryone copy and paste this everywhere!!!\non april 1st we take over this wiki!!\nwe have to overtake the new admin and we can only do this together!\nspread the word!!!\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Fish^12]] concisecritique · 3/30/2025\n\nOne of the worst characters to ever hit the game, and this is just the first update for the full release. Astronomically high rarity (Apollyon is a deeply silly class, and should of never been added. Safe, Euclid, Keter were fine. Even Thaumiel is pushing it.) forces you to spend ridiculous amounts of money for even the chance to get her. Sure, there's the free daily rolls, but with a pull rate of 0.002%, do you think you're actually going to get her? That's not even getting into the skins. Every time I see an Occult Master Arachne I weep for the poor sod who spent their morgage on Cute Anime Girl.\n\nGameplay wise, she's utterly broken. The AOE from the thaumaturgy skill, alongside high single target damage from her rifle fire means that any bosses are trivalised. Sure, this wasn't a problem in the Girls Occult Coalition, but that had entirely different balancing. Crumbling Foundation is not the same hyper-offence FPS. The developers say she's balanced because she has no capture mechanic, but when her DPS is enough to outmatch Giant Enemy Lizard, does that really matter? Combine that with the rarity, and she's a pay to win character.\n\nEven her Lore is bad. GOC was not meant to be in the same game lorewise, the sci-fi futurism does not mesh with the fantasy aesthetics. Literally, this is so visible in team comps. When the meta involves her being in the same team as characters like Meri, it becomes painfully obvious she's a character hastily reused for a different project. Honestly, it's probably the reason why she's so rare and so mechanically busted. Pity points.\n\nAnyone who enjoys or plays this character should be stoned to death publically.\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user Alexander245]] stangoc! · 3/30/2025\n\nbut... she's my babygril...\n\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user Fish^12]] possessedpizzzzah · 3/30/2025\n\nomg pfp twins.\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user moto42]] THESKELETONATTACKS4 · 3/30/2025\n\nAnd i just realised.
