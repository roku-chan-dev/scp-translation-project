They're a private military company that dabbles in anomalous research. We've even hired them a couple of times (under the table, of course). As for Mercer himself... well.\n> \n> He had an associate once -- a lawyer by the name of Harold Rosenthal. In 1995, Rosenthal embezzled money from Myrmidon. Mercer went after him, but Rosenthal found a way to tie him up in litigation that would last for decades. Two weeks later, Rosenthal was reported missing. \n> \n> They found the exsanguinated corpse in his New York City office. 85th floor. No witnesses, no puncture wounds, no explanation. \n> \n> Mercer had an ironclad alibi -- meeting in Paris to push some sort of anti-piracy law. Convenient, right? His life is plagued by happy coincidences like that. Unsolved disappearances, weird deaths, disasters that benefited him financially. \n> \n> Investors love him -- he eats shit and shits gold. He loses a little money here and there, but never a lot. Just enough to avoid kicking up red flags. GOC has a file on him. They figure him for a Type Blue. I'm not so sure (besides, we both know their taxonomy is full of shit). But whatever he's got going on, I'll bet my left nut it's more than just \"the luck of the Irish\".\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #0e1325; color: #c8cfea; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n= TRANSMISSION INTERCEPT LOG\n----\nDATE: 07-09-2016\nSATELLITE ID: JE6-LA5J671-3GMNAZ\nCALL LENGTH: 00:02:26\n----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n >> -- not sure about this.

Have you been tracking me since I left to work for Prometheus? Of course you have. The Foundation is a bit like the mafia, isn't it? No one gets to leave our little family. Not forever.\n> \n> But you've got this all wrong, Robert. Myrmidon isn't your enemy. \n> \n> I'm actually glad you've been spying on us. I've been meaning to catch up with you for some time, now. Have you enjoyed what you've seen so far? No doubt it stirs familiar feelings in that withered, blackened heart of yours. Nostalgia for the good old days -- back before our precious Foundation lost its way.\n> \n> Do you remember what they offered me? After I made the decision none of them had the courage to make? After I saved them -- after I saved us all?  \n> \n> Forced retirement. A pittance of a pension. A garish little wristwatch. My name on a wall.\n> \n> Look at what our Foundation has become: A sanctuary for effete, over-sensitive dullards who extol the virtues of appeasement and immobility over swift, decisive action -- over advancement, over strife, over //progress//. Men paralyzed by endless moral bickering, Christian timidity, and maudlin sentiments. Their glassy eyes are forever fixed backwards, gazing upon the imagined sins of the past.\n> \n> But you and I know better: There //is// no past. There is no present. There is only the unbound future, stretched before us in all its infinite potential and glorious promise. It is only through momentum that this potential can be realized. It is only through power that this promise can be secured. The meek shall have their earth -- once the bold have abandoned it for the stars. \n> \n> You linger in the dark. We accelerate toward the light. You are driven by complacency and security. We are driven by a feverish insomnia, exulting the beauty of speed and the sublime poetry of violence. You are a mausoleum, your graves maintained by ghosts; fixated on a history that is long dead and gone. We are your legacy -- bright and burning, racing forward to eclipse even the very sun.\n> \n> But make no mistake, Robert: I did not forge this company to quarrel with crumbling museums and their decrepit curators. Myrmidon is not here to destroy the Foundation.\n> \n> It is here to //replace// it. \n> \n> I think it's time you came over to the winning side, old friend. The one that can calculate precisely what a man of your resolve is worth -- and offer you triple.\n> \n> Shoot me an email. We'll talk stock options.\n> \n> //Aut  inveniam viam aut faciam.//\n> \n> - Mendel Mercer\n> ----\n> [[=image myrmidon.png]] \n\n----\n= **Next: Any Colour You Like**\n----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** myrmidon.png\n> **Author:** [[*user The Great Hippo]]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/money SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
