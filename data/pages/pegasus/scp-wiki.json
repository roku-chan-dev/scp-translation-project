Variations of his adventures are known far and wide, but most people do not know the whole story of this once revered hero. Nowadays, he is but a shadow of his former self ever since he lost his wings.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Pegasus_woodcut_1715.png]]\nAn 18th century woodcut of Pegasus.\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Perseus_Rescuing_Andromeda_LACMA_65.37.124.jpg]]\n\nPegasus being ridden by Perseus to rescue Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus.\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Annibale_Carracci_Bellerophon.png]]\n\nBellerophon and Pegasus battling the Chimera. It must be noted that the size of the Chimera depicted in the illustration is inaccurate.[[footnote]] \"By how much? How big was it?\" - L.B. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Based on what we can find it was probably around 5 meters. The numbers vary between sources, but it is the best estimate that can be made with the data. Some texts vaguely refered to Chimera as bigger than Pegasus.\" - M [[/footnote]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Redon_-_The_Poet_and_Pegasus_%28Pegasus_Captive%29%2C_c._1891-1898.jpg]]\n\nThe illustration depicts Pegasus mourning the death of Bellerophon, and the loss of his wings. To the left is a humanized depiction of Pangloss, whom the illustrator referred to as The Poet, offering his condolences.[[footnote]] \"Has anybody asked Pangloss about this? I would like to know if he has any comments about Pegasus these days.\" - W.K.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"I'll make a note to do so when I see him. He is busy most of the time.\" - L.S.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Pegasus is a pale stallion who had beautiful wings. He could stretch them out wide enough to provide as much shade as a tree. Unfortunately, Pegasus had lost them and all that remains on his back are the wounds proving they were once there. Furthermore, Pegasus is no longer muscular and healthy. Instead he is now deathly thin and frail.\n\n**Nature:** Pegasus was very adventurous and energetic in his early years. No beast could frighten him, and he freely went wherever he desired. Fountains of water were made when he would will it at the stomp of his hooves. He is also immortal, but it does not make him invincible.\n\nHowever, in the present day, Pegasus is constantly in a state of depression. He refuses all food and water to the point of becoming malnourished. Pegasus also causes droughts wherever he goes. This makes him immensely dangerous to the environment.\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Pegasus was born from Medusa after Perseus killed her. They both became great friends, and accompanied each other on a few adventures.[[footnote]]\"Kind of awkward to befriend your mother's killer.\" - Kunj[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"It did not matter to Pegasus. He didn't really know her. What was the saying? The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\" - L.S.[[/footnote]] The most famous of course is the tale of Perseus rescuing Andromeda.\n\nPegasus had a fondness for Andromeda as much as he did for Perseus. He would often visit their nine children, and they all adored him too. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Perseus was killed by his cousin Megapenthes, son of Proetus.[[footnote]]Megapenthes was known by a few to have had an interest in the occult, and studied whatever he could find, including Nälkän / Sarkic texts. Further information can be found in his entry by the Hand.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] The death of Perseus is discussed in greater detail elsewhere, but it is said Megapenthes had sent a witch knowledgeable in poisons to end his life.[[/footnote]]Pegasus sought the aid of the Olympians to resurrect Perseus, but they could not find his soul.[[footnote]] \"What do you mean they couldn't find it? Where could he have gone?\" - L.B. [[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"Nobody knows. Some believe he was snatched up into one of the many afterlives that exist.\" - M[[/footnote]] The goddess Athena then took in Pegasus until she gave him to Bellerophon. During a battle, Pegasus lost his wings, and remained hidden for many years until he was found.\n\nDuring the years he was absent, many people learned of his adventures with Perseus and Bellerophon as myth. His heroic reputation made him a source of inspiration for many people who would use him in their symbols across generations.\n\nIn the present day, Pegasus is in the custody of the Jailors, and they refer to him as SCP-042.[[footnote]]\"I have a copy of his file from the Jailors if anyone wants to read it. However, it may be a little outdated.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]] His treatment was cruel in the early years they had him, however, internal changes created a less horrible environment. They have been keeping Pegasus alive despite him losing the will to live.[[footnote]] \"This is just depressing. Before I joined the Hand I loved Greek mythology, and Pegasus was one of my favorites. Something about him always intrigued me. To know this is what became of him breaks my heart.\" - IV [[/footnote]]\n\nThe only noteworthy event that occurred with Pegasus in the custody of the Jailors is a Dr. Andreas Pantziri. Dr. Pantziri was an ill Jailor who pitied the flightless Pegasus. He orchestrated a plot that would allow Pegasus to experience flight through free fall aboard a plane. His fellow Jailors punished him for his actions, and when his illness grew worse they euthanized him.[[footnote]] \"He would have been a good member of the Serpent's Hand.\" - W.S.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Coincidentally, we found that Dr. Pantziri shares some ancestry with Perseus. This happens from time to time as a result of people descending from the bloodlines of his children. There is even a Bookburner who is related to Perseus. It's kind of cool how many people born there can be traced back to a mythological figure. Don't get me started on Zeus.\" - M[[/footnote]]\n\n**Approach:** The Jailors currently have him at a secure location that prevents him from causing droughts. As much as it displeases many in the Hand, Pegasus must remain in their custody until further notice.[[footnote]] \"Where would we keep him if we did took him away from the Jailors? Here in the Wanderer's Library? It's one of the safest places in Creation, but I don't think people will be comfortable with a depressed horse staring at them while reading about the history of corn.\" - L.B.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"Why don't we just give him some antidepressants? Maybe it will put him in a much better mood.\" - Kunj[[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"We are not going to drug Pegasus, Kunj.\" - Trünan[[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"I'm afraid Trünan is right. It would only be a temporary solution, and there is also all the potential side-effects to consider. What if he goes through withdraws when we stop giving it to him? What if he starts flooding the Library from being too happy off the stuff? Do you remember how angry the Librarians were when Tim brought over that inebriated water witch?\" - L.S.[[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"I said I was sorry. We had a little too much to drink that night.\" - Tim [[/footnote]] Possibilities into healing Pegasus are to be looked into in the meantime.[[footnote]] \"I feel like this should be easy.\" - L.B.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"It's not. Healing magic is hard to come by, especially ones with no catch. Nälkän sorcery is off the table for none of us can use it, and how badly wrong it can go. The more effective healing rituals that we know of have disturbing requirements like human hearts.\" - L.S.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\nThe following text is from //A Biography of Pegasus//.\n------\n\n//After the death of Perseus, Pegasus joined with Bellerophon, the Slayer of Monsters, to cleanse the land of wicked things. A lone, powerful sorcerer who could twist the flesh created many horrible creatures, but each were slain by Bellerophon and Pegasus. The most famous beast they battled was the dreadful Chimera. No one could slay it, not even the few remaining Dactyls of brass and copper. With the aid of Pegasus, Bellerophon struck from above where its claws or fire could not reach them. Together they were able to defeat the abomination with a block of lead given to them by the Dactyls. Bellerophon threw the block into Chimera's mouth, and it choked as the lead melted down its throat. The beast was then stabbed to death by Bellerophon's spear, and the two emerged victorious.//\n\n//For his deeds, Bellerophon was invited to ascend and become one of the Olympians. This angered the flesh sorcerer for ascension was their greatest ambition, and they envied all who could become a god before they could. To best Bellerophon and Pegasus, the sorcerer conjured a hideous gadfly that had the face of a man. It could soar through the skies like a bolt of lightning, and no blade was ever meant cut through its armored shell of bone.//\n\n//As Pegasus travelled to Mt. Olympus with Bellerophon on his back, the Gadfly ambushed the both of them. The terrible creature had stung Pegasus, and Bellerophon fell from his back into its twisted arms. In their struggle, the Gadfly slashed the eyes of Bellerophon, but he managed to pierce a wing with his spear. They immediately fell to the earth, but the Gadfly whispered a cursed incantation from its master to Bellerophon.//\n\n//They both landed in a thick thorn bush where they became entangled. Pegasus descended as he watched the Gadfly thrash among the thorns with Bellerophon beneath it. Pegasus struck the beast several times with his hooves as hard as he could. Before the creature can snap its tendrils at him, water started to fill its body until it collapsed under the weight and drowned.//\n\n//Pegasus turned his back to the creature, and approached the wounded Bellerophon. He was trying to blindly crawl away somewhere, but the warrior screamed as his mind descended into madness from the words he heard. As Pegasus lowered his head to raise up his companion, the Gadfly rose once more to grab Pegasus by the wings, and it tore them from his back. A bolt of lightning then struck the creature, leaving it as a charred corpse when Zeus himself arrived. He found the heroes in great pain, so he brought them both to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4500 Athens where the Scholars were.][[footnote]] For further information regarding the Scholars of Athens, consult their entry by the Hand.[[/footnote]]//\n\n//The Scholars tended to Pegasus' wounds, but Bellerophon was not fortunate. He began to devour himself in both body and soul, screaming of an undulating vastness in a great abyss. The Scholars could not cure him of this madness, and he soon suffered a miserable death.//\n\n//Upon learning the death of Bellerophon, Pegasus was stricken with grief, and the added loss of his wings brought him into further despair. The Scholars expressed their sympathy, and many more came to do the same. The Oracle of Delphi herself travelled to Athens to visit Pegasus, but she was there to share with him a prophecy. She foretold a day where Perseus will return, and it will be at the end of days where the two will be together again.//\n\n//So Pegasus began to wait.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\nThere has been doubt over the Oracle's prophecy. Some people believe it is one that will never come to pass for Pegasus, and it would be humane to help him be laid to rest. Others feel Pegasus must live. However, it can be agreed by both sides that it is tragic to see a wonderful hero in such a horrid state.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Pegasus woodcut 1715.png\n> **Author:** Anonymous\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pegasus_woodcut_1715.png Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** Perseus Rescuing Andromeda LACMA 65.37.124.jpg\n> **Author:** Antonio Tempesta, Wilhelm Janson\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Perseus_Rescuing_Andromeda_LACMA_65.37.124.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** Annibale Carracci Bellerophon.png\n> **Author:** Annibale Carracci\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Annibale_Carracci_Bellerophon.png Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** Redon - The Poet and Pegasus (Pegasus Captive), c. 1891-1898.jpg\n> **Author:** Odilon Redon\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Redon_-_The_Poet_and_Pegasus_(Pegasus_Captive),_c._1891-1898.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
