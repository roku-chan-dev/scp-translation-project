Please direct request for Boxercrat Solstice's assistance to the CICAPOCO Section of Personnel Capabilities.\n\n--Boxercrat Solstice (Please do not contact me directly about selachians you want to see pugilisated. I have my own priorities. This means you, %%title%%)\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/module]]\n\n> Please see below for my project punchfolio. By my own reckoning, my work has led to the pugilification of over 803,420,609 naturally occurring Selachian Entities.\n> \n> Unfortunately, the Centre seems to be suffering from some extra-universal contamination.\n> \n> Personally, I blame my cousin for stealing my credentials and dumping his fanfiction on my work laptop.\n> \n> If need be, I volunteer him for selachification and pugilation.\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Best-Of]]\n+ The Stories that Best Represent LORDXVNV\n\n------\n++++ - [[[SCP-8008]]] - Time Pervert\n\n------\n\n++++ - [[[SCP-6987]]] - Your Legally Entitled Coverage As An Employee of the SCP Foundation (Provided by Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.) \n\n//They are the only insurer with a proven record when it comes to anomalous, esoteric, and extremely rare world-changing \"black swan\" events.
