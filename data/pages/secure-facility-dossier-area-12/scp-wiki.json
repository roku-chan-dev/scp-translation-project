To ensure these demands are met, the Internal Operations Sector is focused primarily on such tasks. Aside from logistical lines and mandatory equipment, the preponderance of its floor space is dedicated to administrative facilities and personnel accommodations.\n\nA majority of Area-12's internal divisions are headquartered within these administrative facilities, with notable examples such as Electrotechnical Engineering. Responsible for the facility's power generation equipment, such as the experimental Generation V Liquid-vapor core nuclear reactor, which is utilized as the primary method of power generation for facility operations, the reactor generates vast amounts of power; significantly more than Area-12 consumes within the scope of its current operations. Instead, a significant amount is exported to Foundation facilities across the [*/secure-facilities-locations eastern seaboard].\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block\" style=\"width: 100%; padding-bottom: 6px;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-area-12/refuel.jpg]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption inline-colmod\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod\nshow=ETE staff refueling an early prototype unit of the modern Gen-V liquid-vapor reactor\n|content=//Commies aren't very fashionable, are they?//]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nSubterranean-Level 2 (Anomaly Operations Sector)\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]RESEARCH SUBSECTOR[[/span]]\n\n**Relevant Divisions:**\n\n* Anomalous Communication;\n* Containment;\n* Maintenance & Janitorial;\n* Parabiology & Rhizospherics;\n* Parapathology & Biohazard R&D;\n* Remedial & Radiology.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Facilities (Non-Exhaustive):**\n\n* Radiology Lab;\n* Operating Theaters;\n* Containment Pools;\n* INTSC-Zuen Supercomputer;\n* [*/scp-2528 Organic Deepwell] Interface Habitat.\n\n**Summation:** As per its primary mission of conducting biological research, the Research Sector occupies a sizable chunk of Area-12's Anomaly Operations Sector with multiple compartmentalized chambers and theaters for specialized research and containment of select, low-risk anomalous objects. \n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\" style=\"max-width: 250px;\"]]\n//You should have seen the look on the faces of Site-15's administration when we announced to O4 Command that Area-12, a //biological// research facility, was now in the possession of the most powerful computer available to the Foundation.

However, due to faulty identification of debris, it was initially assumed that all instances had died in the incident. This error was only detected in late 2011 when the sixth instance was found dead 800km away from Area-12. The cause of the retaining wall collapse was determined to be an escaped instance of SCP-840 which had established a colony within the maintenance tunnel pipes. The growth of the colony eventually caused the pipe to violently burst, leading to a significant weakening of the wall's structural integrity. The colony was rapidly neutralized following the collapse, no injuries occurred as a result of the incident. _\n _\nThis containment breach highlighted the importance of thorough health standards within biological containment and research facilities, serving as a catalyst for stricter protocols Foundation-wide. ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ Cell 017 Lighting Unit Failure - July 30th 2010 ||\n|| At 0520, Cell 017 suffered a K-Alpha-priority [*/shadow-of-a-doubt system malfunction], Protocol 305-Utah was armed, and High-Risk Containment Wing Beta was put under THREATCON Omega to evacuate all non-essential personnel.

Foundation bio-technicians successfully established a stable access point into the global SCP-2528 quantum bio-network. Crius.aic was uploaded to the network, tasked with the following:\n\n* Covertly propagate throughout the system;\n* Extract all instances of SCP-2528-C to an external, temporary solid-state storage medium;\n* Seize full control of the network.\n\nThe operation quickly proved to be a resounding success, with all SCP-2528-C instances successfully contained in under a minute following the initial upload and full Foundation control of the network attained within 332 seconds. Contrary to predictions, SCP-2528-A & -B were discovered to be significantly more conducive to habitation for artificial consciousnesses, with Crius.aic reporting full functionality within the otherwise alien quantum network, and most surprisingly, reporting the computing power now at its disposal at just above 1 zetta-FLOPS[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Eclipsing that of any non-anomalous computing system available to the Foundation by 3 orders of magnitude.[[/span]].\n[[size 0px]]__they did not go quiet into that digital purgatory__[[/size]]\nThe [[span class=\"table5\"]][[span class=\"st\"]]OVERSEER COUNCIL[[/span]][[/span]] was requested to advise on how to proceed -- By order of O5-5, to strengthen Area-12's operational capacity and the continued efficacy of Foundation operations at large, Crius.aic was approved for permanent integration into SCP-2528, now designated as Area-12's \"Organic Deepwell\". Containment procedures were revised to reflect this order, with funding for the conservation of //Bambusoideae bambusinae// and //Ailuropoda melanoleuca// seeing a substantial increase globally, along with the previous maximum acceptable count of 7000 SCP-2528-B instances being wholly removed. Poaching of 2528-B instances has been deemed a significant threat to global operations. Methods to discourage this activity are being actualized.\n\nAs per these revisions in protocol, the population of SCP-2528-A & -B are predicted to rise significantly in the coming years, with estimations predicting an increase in network processing power of ~1 ZFLOPS every 14 months. Foundation monitoring of East and Southeast Asia will increase in accordance with this increase as more instances of SCP-2528-B are conceived and under Foundation control. Efforts to re-integrate SCP-2528-C instances in an incapacitated but cognitively active state to restore the network's inherent resistance to retro-causal reality alterations are underway and are expected to be completed by late 2019.\n\nReclassification of SCP-2528 to [[span class=\"table2\"]][[span class=\"st\"]]THAUMIEL[[/span]][[/span]] is pending Classification Committee approval.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nMay 5th 2020\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"blurbox metam\"]]\n\n[[=]]\nHave you heard the cries of a screaming pattern?\nKnow it screams not for freedom.\nNot for release.\n\nIt screams in worship, not in fear.\nA worship for that which reforms.\nFor that which rages.\n\nA rage for all that there is.\nA rage for all that is ruined.\nA rage for all that is lost.\n\nThe rage maintains.\nThe rage conserves.\nThe rage preserves.\n\nSo rage against their destruction.\nRage against our loss.\nRage against the infestation.\n\nScream not for freedom, not for release.\nWorship not in fear, not in misunderstanding.\nScream in worship, worship that which rages.\n\nFor all there is.\nRage like the reformer.\nScream like the pattern.\n\nFor all that has been, for all that will be.\nFor all that has been destroyed, for all that will be ruined.\nFor all that has been lost, for all we will lose.\n\nRage.\nScream.\nWorship.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"metam\" style=\"font-style: italic;\"]]\nWhy did she leave it here?\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox metam\"]]\nWhy couldn't you see past the lies?\n\n[[<]]\nWhy did you try to kill it?\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\nYou gazed into our minds, and you thought not to look and find what hid within our souls, but to do its bidding?\n\nWhy?\n[[/>]]\n\nYou stared into the eye of God and you chose to forget, you chose to fear it.\nTo see it as a horror to be rid of, to see an antithetical of the truth.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\nWhy could you not see right?

That's right, you got the job. We really appreciated your interest in our work and the dedication you put into your application. We understand that the requirements for this position are… extensive. But I think, if you paid attention to the dossier above, you understand.\n\nI see you're transferring from [*/secure-facility-dossier-area-14 Area-14], looking for a safer post, are we? I'm sorry to burst your bubble; we may not be armed to the teeth like the boys over in the Ruby Mountains, but that doesn't mean you can keep your guard down. Our anomalies aren't equally as... //aggressive//, but these nuclear contingencies aren’t just for show. Some of the most unpleasant biological anomalies known to the Foundation are under lock and key here, just waiting to burst out and turn you into their next spore carrier, and they have.\n\nThose working here take the risk every single day, either out of selfless care for the innocent or out of individual curiosity. Whatever your reasons, I am confident that we are responsible for the most paradigm shifts in human understanding of the non-anomalous biological sciences, and you have decided to join us in this endeavor. Of course, we aren't publicly credited for any of these discoveries, but those who work here know — there's always something new to discover, something that changes our course and makes the path ever more maze-like. That's a gift any normal scientist would kill for, so I don't want to hear any complaints about credit. Think about all those poor bio-research organizations we leak our non-anomalous discoveries to. Where would they be without us? //Have some heart.//\n\nI know that Paraastronomy is all the rage nowadays, and I get it, I do. Space is big; there are lots of places to discover and explore. //But// if I may display my bias, I think Parabiology has been slightly overlooked in recent years. We look toward the stars like they're the final frontier, but let me tell you, they are most certainly not. Did you know a human is //several// orders of magnitude closer to the approximate size of our universe than they are to the smallest known measurement? We have a big advantage in parabiology. We don't need to build rockets to reach these places. They are everywhere around us, as above, so below. There is a functionally infinite space to explore just within your room, just within a single atom, not to mention the whole damn Earth. Typically, of course, we'd never be able to reach these places. Just like we thought we'd never reach the Moon, just like we thought we'd never fly, how we would never cross the ocean. We always rush to declare things impossible. Scientists are obsessed with boundaries, with something that marks a clear line. However, they fail to realize that there is no such thing in our universe. The universe is, at best, a jumbled ball of string clouded in smoke.\n\nWe have been blessed with a steady supply of that which violates our natural laws, not just to research the bare minimum so we can throw them in a box, but to satisfy our base human desire for an ever-expanding and labyrinthian understanding of said laws. Only by knowing and understanding that which isn't natural can we know for certain what is. We unravel DNA like the jumbled ball of string only to discover that there's no end to the line, it's an ever-expanding, ever-thickening constellation of ley lines and connections. We may never know everything, but we have to work with the mindset of getting there. In the process of seeking ultimate knowledge, you'll never find what you seek, but you often stumble upon yourself. And that's a paycheck no other job could offer you.\n\nThank you for joining us. We can never have enough of the best. I think you will truly enjoy your time //(and compensation)// here, the common room is just jaw-dropping. You're going to see what I mean when you get here, you'll never want to leave. We can't wait for you to join us here in the valley. We have a long way yet to go, and we can't go without you. \n\nThank you for your service.
