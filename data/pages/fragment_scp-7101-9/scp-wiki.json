After some discussion, O5-01 instructs SET-B to retrieve Director Roufhous. SET-B escorts Director Roufhous to a stand facing the majority of the group//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Ohh... G'day, everyone.\n\n**O5-01:** Mx. Roufhous-\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Director. I've been here quite a few years, Overseer.\n\n**O5-01:** And that may very well change depending on how you continue to act in front of the entirety of the O5 Council. You should know how serious this is.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** If being pulled from my site, a site of which I'll have you know is quite dependant on me wasn't enough.\n\n**O5-09:** That's being taken care of. We are here today to decide how to proceed with yourself and Six.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Pardon?\n\n**O5-08:** It was rather suspicious when we found something above //our// clearance. We had Director Jones take a look into it, and we don't like what we've found.\n\n**O5-04:** Your meeting with Six, regarding the potential manipulation of SCP-7101.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Oh... that.\n\n**O5-01:** Yes. //That.// Were you aware that by partaking in that little deal, and by not informing the rest of the council that you have participated in what we can and do consider conspiracy to the Foundation and the public at large?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** That did cross my mind, once or twice, yes.\n\n**O5-03:** So you were complacent?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** At the time, it seemed like it was in both our best interests to go through with it. That, and self-defense.\n\n**E5 Dr. Cimmerian:** Self-defense?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Between sending Doctor Xyank to get amnesticized and him threatening me with the Red Right Hand, one could argue that I did it in self-defense.\n\n**E5 Dr. Cimmerian:** Right, but you didn't exactly seem too scared at the time. One could even argue that you seemed pretty confident; threatening a member of the O5 Council afterward.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Does how I reacted in the time change what he said or implied?\n\n**O5-12:** It does, //significantly//.\n\n**Dir. Jones:** Roufhous, you said you believed it was in your best interest. Could you elaborate on that?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** He had just informed me of something that occurred directly attributing to his idea.\n\n**O5-04:** And did you look into his claim?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Afterwards, yes.\n\n**E5 Dr. Cimmerian:** So, at the time, you ha no tangible confirmation that this idea would produce idealistic results? Manipulating a deity to change the timeline, after the head of temporal relations was removed from the meeting?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** All I did was say \"Yes, sir\", and then leap out the window. I haven't actually started the process of changing the file, an-\n\n**O5-09:** And now it looks like you won't.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I was getting to that; yes.\n\n**O5-07:** Any changes to the timeline, any at all, that are incurred in some part by the Foundation, are to receive a majority vote from the O5 Council prior to enacting it. Director Roufhous, by actively agreeing to it, and by admitting that you were originally planning on performing it, you have confirmed that you had planned on harming the timeline, a **very** serious offense.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** And yet, I haven't done anything to achieve it. It has not been done, there is no harm anymore. 2 - O\n\n**O5-01:** This is going nowhere. Bring in Six.\n\n= //SET-A momentarily leaves, before escorting O5-06 to a podium beside Roufhous//\n\n**O5-01:** Six-\n\n**O5-06:** Yeah, yeah, I heard everything from out there. Let's just get to playing Clue already.\n\n**O5-01:** Very well. Six, please inform us of why exactly you did not inform the rest of us about your plan to utilize an unstable, uncontrolled SCP-7101, to change the timeline.\n\n**O5-06:** I didn't want to change the timeline, blame Pendant over there!\n\n**O5-09:** They had no intention of changing the timeline, nor knowledge that they had caused that change. We are not here for Roufhous, at the moment; we are here for you, Six.\n\n**O5-06:** Well it sure doesn't seem it! Why is there only one Alpha-01, and three Omega-01s?\n\n**O5-01:** Six. Why?\n\n**O5-06:** 'Cause of this! All of this. Assembling a group of 30 fuckin' people just to decide if we do somethin' or don't do somethin'. How many of y'all would turn your nose up as soon as I mention what I want to do? We're in deep shit right now, sorry for wanting to help.\n\n**E5 Dr. Cimmerian:** The situation of GOIs wasn't your concern. What is concerning, however, is how you threatened a subordinate into doing what you wanted and did everything possible to make sure no one found out about this.\n\n**O5-06:** Say, how'd y'all find out about our deal, exactly?\n\n**Dir. Jones:**  By accident. We randomly found a document that had a collapsible requiring 5/7101 clearance. Seeing as I have full clearance over all Foundation documentati-\n\n**O5-06:** You motherfucker!\n\n= //O5-06 faces Director Roufhous//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Wha-\n\n**O5-06:** You did this on purpose, you little shit! You handed it to them on a silver fucking platter, you rat!\n\n**O5-01:** Six, calm down, now!\n\n**O5-06:** Fuck you! SET, kill this son of a bitch!\n\n= //SET-A turns toward Director Roufhous, before firing upon them. Director Roufhous does not react upon being shot and no wounds are observable//\n\n= //Agents Cartwright and Hart neutralize SET-A//\n\n**O5-01:** Six, that is enough!\n\n**O5-02:** Everyone. I would like to take a recession. Later on, I would like to then have a vote, regarding O5-06's title, with more members of the Ethics Committee present.\n\n**O5-01:** Yes, I think that would be best. Six, until that time comes, you will be confined to your room within Site-01, lacking any form of outside communication. Then, we will decide your current position within the Foundation.\n\n**O5-06:** And what about him?\n\n= //O5-06 points towards where Director Roufhous was. The space now empty//\n\n**O5-10:** They will be dealt with in a separate matter.\n\n**O5-06:** He gets off scot-free, and I get D-Class.\n\n**O5-01:** Six-\n\n= //O5-06 pulls out a handgun and fires upon O5-01, turning to O5-02 before being terminated by Agent Schneider//\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n//Afterward, outside security footage showed Director Roufhous fleeing the Site-01 premises. Further information regarding this situation is Level-5 restricted.//\n\n\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n##black|Ending 2/8: \"Higher you climb, harder you'll fall\"##\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
