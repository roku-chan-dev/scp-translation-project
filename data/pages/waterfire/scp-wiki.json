He is currently stationed in Site-101, and specializes in accident reconstruction. He has been noted to be very casual and outgoing among close colleagues, but quiet among personnel he is unfamiliar with.\n\nWaterfire has been known to keep a Rubik's Cube type puzzle on his person at all times. He has regularly produced abstract drawings following his exposure to [REDACTED] (see photo).\n\n__SCP Reports Authored__:\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Waterfire\" separate=\"no\" limit=\"250\" perPage=\"250\" tags=\"scp, -joke\" order=\"title\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n__Field Reports Authored__\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Waterfire\" separate=\"no\" limit=\"250\" perPage=\"250\" tags=\"tale\" order=\"title\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[https://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/waterfire Current Assignments]\n\n[https://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-684347/snippets-from-chat-you-had-to-save-for-all-time-11#post-1912788 Why Waterfire Doesn't Get Any Promotions]\n\n//It has come to my attention that Researcher Waterfire has made a habit of using [https://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-684347/snippets-from-chat-you-had-to-save-for-all-time-11#post-1874809 mysterious symbols] in his notes regarding Incident-████-█.

Don't tell anyone.|width=300px]]\n[[[SCP-1363]]] - Possessed Virus\n\nThis was my first skip posted to the mainlist.\n\nWhen I first wrote it up, it was this awful thing about contagious radiation sickness that made zombies, and had this really poorly executed historical reference. Initially, I had a lot of trouble figuring out what to do with it.\n\nAfter a long time on the IRC, and about three iterations, I ended up with the disease that makes you talk to dead people.\n\nNot a bad trade, I'd say.\n\n[[[SCP-306]]] - The Frogs\n\nThis article was a rewrite of \"Frog Rot\", by DrGears. The original article is available [https://scpclassic.wikidot.com/scp-306 here].\n\nI volunteered to rewrite this article, largely because it was one of the articles I had liked the most before joining. The biggest issue was trying to make this skip more unusual and interesting. I settled on building off that whole myth that frogs can cause warts, then (sort of) reversed it.\nThe article almost kicked the bucket within a few hours, but with some quick edits, I was able to keep the article afloat. --It's currently hovering at about +20-- Somehow it broke +30.\n\n[[[SCP-1387]]] - Giant Seagull Airlines\n\nI started writing this article just after finishing 1363, but put it on hold when rewriting 306.\n\nThe biggest problem I had with this article was getting the interview right, which took up the bulk of the time spent on the article. Once I finally got that worked out, the only thing left to do was to post.\n\n[[[SCP-2333]]] - One Week To Live\n\nThis article was probably the most odd one posted in the 2000 contest, as it was not based on common Sci-Fi tropes. Instead, I approached the contest as a challenge to write \"Fiction about Science.\" In hindsight, this wasn't the best idea.\n\nWell, I wasn't hoping to win anyway.\n\n[[[SCP-2033]]] - Coincidental Tree\n\nThis skip, which at the time was my favorite one to write, is based on an odd tradition at a school near my house. Basically, people stick their gum onto this tree in the bus loop. The only thing that I could think of about this tradition was how random it was. I thought, \"how can I make it more random?\"\n\nThe answer was simple: make the tree sing show tunes.\n\n[[[SCP-2123]]] - I Accidentally the Whole Universe\n\nYes, I am extremely proud of that title. It's still not as good a title as 2137 though (see next tab).\n\nWhat makes this one my favorite article so far was that fact that it was the first time I felt like I told a cohesive, complex story. Sure, my other articles do have a plot to them, but none of them were quite as complicated.\n\nThe idea behind this article, something that turns the universe into antimatter, was an idea I had early on after I joined the site. Actually conveying the idea was a challenge because of just how technical everything got. But I think I was able to do it pretty well.\n\n[[[SCP-2153]]] - Charitable Clovers\n\nFor most of the the first half of 2015, I was incredibly inactive on the site due to having way too much schoolwork. By spring, I desperately wanted to get back into it, but didn't know where to begin.\n\nAlong comes the Short Contest. I decide to give it a try, using an old, kinda dumb concept I came up with a while back: a virus which makes clovers have 4 leaves. I knew the concept needed more, so a brainstormed in the chat to expand it a bit. The result was this odd anomalous charity.\n\nA certain user complimented this article, and from what I could tell it was their favorite contest entry. I won't say who it was, but their approval made me feel incredibly proud.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Top 23 Favorite Articles]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/i/2014/296/0/6/fixing_my_sleep_schedule_by_w4t3rf1r3-d83x0hq.jpg|caption=Something else that I drew.|width=275px]]\nThese are the articles which left the biggest impact on me. Whether they were packed with feels, made me laugh, gave me nightmares, or just had an excellent story, these are the skips that I found most memorable.\n\nThere's 23 here because 23 is my favorite number.\n\n# [[[SCP-1875]]] \"Antique Chess Computer\"\n# [[[SCP-179]]] \"Sauelsuesor\"\n# [[[SCP-1830]]] \"The Guardian Projection\"\n# [[[SCP-818]]] \"An Abandoned Project\"\n# [[[SCP-2000]]] \"Deus Ex Machina\"\n# [[[SCP-1958]]] \"Magic Bus\"\n# [[[SCP-1619]]] \"Site-45-C: Floor 24\"\n# [[[SCP-1762]]] \"Where The Dragons Went\"\n# [[[SCP-1994]]] \"Rot\"\n# [[[SCP-1296]]] \"Dial-a-Llama\"\n# [[[SCP-1522]]] \"Ships That Pass in the Night\"\n# [[[SCP-610]]] \"The Flesh That Hates\"\n# [[[SCP-2420]]] \"A Good Dog\"\n# [[[SCP-035]]] \"Possessive Mask\"\n# [[[SCP-1342]]] \"To The Makers of Music\"\n# [[[SCP-2718]]] \"What Happens After\"\n# [[[SCP-1322]]] \"Glory Hole\"\n# [[[SCP-093]]] \"Red Sea Object\"\n# [[[SCP-940]]] \"Araneae Marionettes\"\n# [[[SCP-1730]]] \"What Happened to Site-13?\"\n# [[[SCP-645]]] \"Mouth of Truth\"\n# [[[SCP-319]]] \"A Curious Device\"\n# [[[SCP-370]]] \"A Key\"\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
