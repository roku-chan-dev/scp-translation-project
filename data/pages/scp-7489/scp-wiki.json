Upon skin to skin contact with a physically injured human (or any organism with features congruent to a human), any and all wounds present on the organism's body will be healed, and SCP-7489 will gain these wounds in their place.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7489 was brought into Foundation custody by Agent Buck in critical condition after accidentally absorbing a wound he had sustained in a prior mission. Subject, named TJ, was ten years old with no prior experience of formal schooling due to living in a rural farm in Cosby, Tennessee, USA. Agent Buck lived in that town prior and was there due to a family gathering when he encountered SCP-7489 and caused the activation of the anomaly.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Interview Log\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[<]]\n\n**Date:** December 10, 1995\n\n**Interviewers:** Dr. Teresa Milna, Psy. D\n\n**Interviewee:** TJ Hatcher (SCP-7489)\n\n**Presiding:** Agent Buck as overseer proxy.\n\n------\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Hello, SCP-7489.\n\n**SCP-7489:** ...\n\n**Dr. Milna:** What's your name?\n\n**SCP-7489:** TJ.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** TJ, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Milna, and I'm going to ask you some questions, okay?\n\n**SCP-7489:** //(nods)//\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Okay. Let's start simple. Tell me about yourself. It's okay to look at me, don't be scared.\n\n**SCP-7489:** ...is that a question?\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Of course it is. I want to know something, so you tell me something.\n\n**SCP-7489:** Mikky told JJ and Claire and everyone to use \"real\" questions when asking me anything.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Oh, is Mikky what you call Agent Buck?\n\n**SCP-7489:** I don't know Agent Buck.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Tall man, looks a little like you, wears a white suit everywhere. Has a white hat?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Oh! Mmhm. Mm-hmm. Mikky is a cowboy for space cows. That's why he has two guns.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Space cows?\n\n**SCP-7489:** I wanna draw now. Do you have paper, miss doctor Milna?\n\n**Dr. Milna:** You can draw on the back of this paper. Sorry it's just pen and not crayons.\n\n**SCP-7489:** It's okay. I like everything that draws.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** ...how is your wound doing?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Wound?\n\n**Dr. Milna:** The bleeding, the... your tummy.\n\n**SCP-7489:** It hurts. On the outside, not a tummyache.\n\n//Dr. Milna takes note here that SCP-7489 has no additional anomalous healing factor to counteract his own anomaly. Note is in line with Medical Department findings.//\n\n**SCP-7489:** But Mikky stopped hurting. I touched a bird once and twisted my arm but it flew. Then a cat and I got this scar here then that disappeared. And our cow Coco...\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Are you aware most kids can't do that?\n\n**SCP-7489:** I think JJ and Claire can't. I don't know a lot of other kids. I see the neighbor kid sometimes but I'm not allowed to talk about the family to strangers.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** I'm not a stranger?\n\n**SCP-7489:** I know your name. You know my name. Not strangers. JJ said that names are important.\n \n**Dr. Milna:** Tell me about JJ, your... sibling? All of your family, actually. Tell me any story you want to.\n\n**SCP-7489:** Hmmm..... So our parents had Mikky, then JJ, then Claire, then me, and Serra but she died before she became a person. Coco died of sick a few weeks before that and Mikky told me she's buried with her. I mean, I didn't see it because I got sick too and sleeped too much.\n\n//SCP-7489 holds up his piece of paper, having drawn four stick figures and two grassy mounds before putting the paper back to resume drawing.//\n\n**SCP-7489:** Like this. //(SCP-7489 draws a mass with limbs under the hill by scribbling in circles.)// After that, mom and dad didn't really come home a lot. Mikky got more jobs to make sure we still got food and stuff, and we grew stuff and took care of the animals too so he wouldn't do that too much. JJ taught me and Claire how to cut up a chicken, but Mikky yelled at them when I almost touched Henry without gloves.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Henry?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Hen-ry. Hen, chicken. She got old so that meant we could eat her. But Mikky got super mad because he thought if I touched her being cut up I would die too, and then Claire said I would've been smushed like that state fair hotdog if that could happen. Hotdogs are made of pigs, not dogs. That's why they're so tasty.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Uh-huh. Say, when did you figure out you could do that?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Well-\n\n//The intercom phone rings, prompting Dr. Milna to receive a radio box from the door after listening to the message to do so. The radio is placed on the table in front of SCP-7489.//\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Agent Buck is going to radio in at any second now, uh, your Mikky, that is.\n\n**SCP-7489:** At work?\n\n//The radio crackles and Agent Buck's voice comes in. He speaks calmly, in accordance to the anomaly interaction guidelines of the time period.//\n\n**Agent Buck:** SCP-7489.\n\n**Dr. Milna:** ...he means you, TJ.\n\n**SCP-7489:** No. It made sense when miss doctor Milna called me that but you know what I'm called and also she just called me TJ.\n\n**Agent Buck:** Which she shouldn't be doing because she's at work, and when someone works here, they are to refer to anomalies by their number designation.\n\n**SCP-7489:** What's a... oh.\n\n**Agent Buck:** Just how it is.\n\n**SCP-7489:** Why?\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Because there's a lot of people and things like you in here, and not everyone is a psychologist like me... who was //specifically instructed// to use TJ's name because I speak directly to him, Agent Buck. I suggest for this interview to go smoothly you treat this kid like a person you actually care about.\n\n**Agent Buck:** Assets cannot be spoken to in a familiar manner to minimize human error-based weak links in information security. SCP-7489, are you adhering to all the containment procedures laid out for you to follow?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Big words...\n\n**Dr. Milna:** Get to what you're saying before he stops complying because you can't spend two seconds being nice.\n\n**Agent Buck:** It was //nice//...humane enough that I brought the anomaly here instead of a normal hospital where more injuries could happen. Could have been neutralized from the initial injury alone. I only apologize to the Foundation for activating it and risking the integrity of the veil in the first place.\n\n//SCP-7489 was distressed at this point, and Dr. Milna held SCP-7489's hand. Both were wearing appropriate PPE to prevent anomaly activation.//\n\n**Dr. Milna:** At least pretend to remember the kid is your //ten year old// brother. TJ, if you want to do this interview tomorrow instead, we can.\n\n**SCP-7489:** No! No. Sorry. Inside voice. Mikky can't call a lot and he did today so something important is...\n\n**Agent Buck:** Thank you for agreeing with me. The information I want to relay to SCP-7489 is the transfer of all its personal effects from Cosby to its containment cell in Site-19 in light of a decision to put this asset in permanent containment without homecoming. Cell to be furnished to accommodate the longer stay with help from the Architecture department. There will be assured visitation from Mikell Navarro, James-Jackal \"JJ\" Hatcher, and Claire Hatcher within the following week.\n\n**SCP-7489:** But //you're//... Mikell.\n\n**Agent Buck:** I'm Agent Buck, nice to meet you.\n\n**SCP-7489:** ...oh. I'm TJ, nice to meet you.\n\n**Agent Buck:** Unlike prisons, you will be given amenities with access to courtyards and inner facilities. Additional things, such as crayons, paint, paper, clothes, or toys can be requested from a provided internal cellphone.\n\n**SCP-7489:** What about laundry? And food. We didn't eat turkey because you had to drive me here.\n\n**Agent Buck:** Details will be explained to you by containment staff. Dr. Milna, have Site-19's kitchens been updated to the new pastaphysics department standards?\n\n**SCP-7489:** JJ made turkey for the first time since mom and you did, and then we didn't– (sob) have turkey on Serra's thanksgiving, and then when mom and dad—\n\n//SCP-7489 began crying, and was soothed to the best of Dr. Milna's ability. Interview was ended in the best interest of personnel private information and ethical humanoid containment protocols.//\n\n------\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Miss doctor Milna told me to sit here. The room was bright blue and white. I’m not really used to colors like this. The bright light made me uncomfortable. The doctors were nice.

You’re not hurt, and you’re wearing this stupid costume.”//\n//“I have to wear it.” I didn’t know what he meant by costume. But I didn’t like it, either. The way it feels against my skin makes me feel weird.//\n\n//The woman from earlier enters the room again.

We were just talking.” He replies.//\n//The woman looked at me, and then quickly looked back at Kenny. “Oh. Kenny, be careful. You should probably leave him alone.”//\n\n//“What? Why? You’re gonna bring me to a hospital I’ve never heard of, and expect me to just sit nice and pretty in the corner?”//\n//“Goddamn it, Kenneth. Just listen to me.”//\n\n//Kenneth laughed at that. “Oooooooh, you’re bringing out my full name. You must mean business.”//\n//The woman looked angry. “I’m telling your parents about this. Just behave. And be nice to the doctors when they come to you.” She walks away.//\n\n//The kid turns to me with a sigh. “Sorry about her. She’s a bitch.”//\n//“What does that mean?” I ask. “I’ve never heard that word before.”//\n\n//He made a face. “Bitch?”//\n//I nod. “Yes.”//\n\n//He laughed. “Jesus, do you live under a rock? How old are you?”//\n//“I’m 10.”//\n\n//“I’m 12. I thought you looked younger than me. Maybe I'm the one that learned cuss words too young.” He shrugs. \"You're strange.\"//\n//\"I'm strange?\" I ask.//\n\n//\"Yeah. You're quiet.

When supervision laxed due to the inherent security of the area, SCP-7489 was fed a cheese puff from the Foundling's hand, who was not in PPE. Presumably, his fingers touched SCP-7489's lips, causing activation of the anomaly.

Hatcher:** Although we know this trainee's skillset from test scores and capability on small missions so far, this interview's purpose is to document the fit-and-properness of Junior Field Agent Terrence Jovial Hatcher—\n\n**Dr. Hart:** //(suppressed laughter)// Sorry– sorry. Oh my God Teej that's your full name?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Just TJ or Teej to you, unless you're a bitch, Kenneth.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** //(Dr. Hart rolls his eyes with a slight smile)// Unneeded.\n\n**SCP-7489:** Or in this case, my... sibling?\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** //(also suppressing laughter)// Stay on focus, you two.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Sorry. It's just that it's because this really is just a formality. Look at him, he's top of his class!\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** That's true. Now, let's review your file real fast so we can get this over with.\n\n//Director Hatcher takes a moment to flip through the pages, and frowns at one of them. This page is SCP-7489's autism diagnosis, signed by Head of Psychology Dr. Glass.//\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** There are no technical qualms or problems in any of your files. However, I spoke to Dr. Glass before this interview, and have tried to understand a little about your... condition? Over the past few years. I trust you more than life itself, but I'm running through the hazards that could possibly occur in communication when you're on the field. Do you think your autism has affected your life negatively at all?\n\n**SCP-7489:** ...as I said before this recording started—\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** –which is off the record which means you can answer differently,\n\n**SCP-7489:** —my opinion on my autism is entirely anecdotal and does not and should never be a baseline for every autistic personnel employed ever. I am here as an agent on my own volition, because I know I can make a difference, and I know that I can use my anomaly to the best of my ability assisting our senior agents on the field.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** If anything fucked him up it's the isolation and that... suit... that he still has to put on.\n\n//Director Hatcher suddenly gets up from the table, but they sit back down to maintain composure.//\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** The same suit that's been keeping him safe all these years, the one that you breached when you were twelve, and now I have to grapple with the fact that my baby brother might die out there? I mean, realistically, The Foundation won't let anyone too useful die that easily, but—\n\n**Dr. Hart:** TJ and I have been meeting up with no suits for over a decade now. I even added to his very fancy glove collection a birthday ago. He isn't an //actual baby//, Director, stop acting like that.\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** Maybe if you didn't break his hand by giving him a stupid cheeto in the first place I'd consider it, ha-ha.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Well maybe if //he—//\n\n**SCP-7489:** I am, in fact, in the room and can be directly spoken to.\n\n//[Director Hatcher puts their face in their hands.]//\n\n**SCP-7489:** This interview is a formality, sure, but this is on the record, and that means everything I say here matters. That's also why there's a non-speaking witness to verify everything said here and the subsequent recording.\n\nI am TJ Hatcher. I am thirty-two years old and I just finished my Junior Foundation Agent Training on top of getting a Foundling Program Associate's Degree in anomalous medicine. My field training was twofold in Field Agent responsibilities and learning battlefield emergency medicine and learning multiple arts of healing- I applied my first-semester knowledge when I was on the ground after the Containment Area 25B breach where //[Details of Incident 25B have been redacted on infosec request.]//. You don't get to say how horrified at the thought of me dying is when I have not only been through that horror, but also came out stronger.\n\nI am capable, I am the only one of my kind, and I am the objective best at what I do.\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** Okay. I believe you. //[pause]// ...Mikell's gonna //hate// this, though.\n\n//There is ten seconds of silence as SCP-7489 and Dr. Hart look at each other.//\n\n**Dr. Hart:** ...I'm gonna point it out.\n\n**Dir. Hatcher:** What?\n\n**Dr. Hart:** TJ, can I point it out?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Yeah you can point it out.\n\n**Dr. Hart:** Minus Claire, this table situation is actually the same as back then, without uh. All the punching. I'm still sorry about that. This... formality meeting? You know that not every single agent, even anomalous ones, get this quote \"mandatory\" interview, right?\n\n**SCP-7489:** Magpie works in Mikky's office and this is probably on speaker.\n\n//[Spacing in document changed to reflect crosstalk.]//\n**Dr. Hart:** I was going to //monologue!// Teej!\n**SCP-7489:** Too slow.\n**Dir. Hatcher:** Oh my fucking God.\n\n//[SCP-7489 retrieves a picnic basket from under the table and pulls out several parchment-wrapped sandwiches, juice boxes, and a plastic container of apple slices. The other two in the room take these items.]//\n\n**SCP-7489:** Made these for the occasion. I'll stop the recor–\n**Dir. Hatcher:** Huh. Cheetos and tur–\n\n//SCP-7489 stops the recording.//\n\n------\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n++++ __//Year: 2023//__\n[[/=]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7489\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7489 is to live within Foundation Staff Housing Site-29.
