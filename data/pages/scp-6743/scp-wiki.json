Outside of testing, the locker is to be filled with nitrogen gas while sealed to prevent corrosion.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6743 was a standard size 11 iron ring, featuring an empty setting at the center. Its design was consistent with a typical promise ring.\n\nPrior to Incident 6743-1, after being removed from the finger of a properly fitting subject, SCP-6743 would cause the former wearer to lose their ability to speak and write adjectives, verbs, and common nouns[[footnote]]Each inflected form of a word counts as a separate word for this purpose. Contractions function as if they were the full form. For example, using \"I'm\" prevents the later use of \"I am\", and \"don't\" prevents the later use of \"do\".[[/footnote]] more than once, however symbolic language[[footnote]]This includes languages such as sign languages and other hand gestures.[[/footnote]] is unaffected. In almost all cases, this effect wore off after approximately 72 hours.\n\nAs of 1/21/1999, SCP-6743 is nonfunctional and considered neutralized following its destruction during Incident 6743-1.\n\n**History:** SCP-6743 was recovered on 6/22/1998 during a raid on an Black Prince Jewelers warehouse in New York City, New York. The object was found in a crate, next to the following note:\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nHey Vanessa[[footnote]]Believed to be POI-88912 (\"Vanessa Landyz\"), who was made aware to the Foundation and terminated shortly after, prior to the discovery of SCP-6743.[[/footnote]]. I made the ring just like you asked- it'll only work temporarily on most people, but it's permanent on that fucker you were talking about. Can't believe he screwed you over like that, sold you out to the jailers.\n@@ @@\nThis world is a cruel place, unfortunately. I hope this can make what he did to you somewhat better.\n@@ @@\n[[>]]\n-Rob, Black Prince Jewelers\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6743-1:** As of 1/5/1999, SCP-6743 is pending reclassification to anomalous object status due to its relatively low risk compared to other anomalies. //-Dr. Patrick Lyons//\n\n**Incident 6743-1:** At 16:34 local time, 1/21/1999, Dr. Patrick Lyons of the Anomaly Reclassification Committee destroyed SCP-6743 by shattering it with a hammer.

Unfortunately, you are the first recorded instance where SCP-6743 has affected an individual for longer than 72 hours, and due to its safe properties, there has been no research into cancelling its effects on a subject.

Do you know if you've been affected by any anomalies at any point in your life?\n> \n> **Lyons:** No, as long as I remember.\n> \n> **Faheem:** Hmm, I see. Has this been affecting you in any way other than what the files suggest? Perhaps you're a unique case.\n> \n> **Lyons:** My symptoms act essentially identical to those in the file. I never believed that it was anything exclusive, at least not yet.\n> \n> **Faheem:** Aren't making this easy, are you? At this rate you may just need to learn sign language...\n> \n> //Dr. Faheem and Dr. Lyons chuckle.//\n> \n> **Faheem:** Well, I think that's all I have for now.
