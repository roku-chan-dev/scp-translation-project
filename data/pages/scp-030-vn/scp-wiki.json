The chemical formula of SCP-030-VN is thermodynamically highly unstable, making its artificial synthesis impossible. SCP-030-VN can only be synthesized and stabilized through an anomalous biochemical process with thaumaturgical traces, which was named the Moly cycle. \n\nUp until this point, the Foundation has only been able to observe the Moly cycle on //Lycoris radiata//. The two main products of this process are SCP-030-VN and Galantamine (C,,17,,H,,21,,NO,,3,,), with the ratio of SCP-030-VN varying from negligible [[footnote]]p = 0,043.[[/footnote]] to roughly 1:1, depending on the environment in which the aforementioned //Lycoris radiata// instance grows. The specific conditions to heighten the ratio of SCP-030-VN in the product mixture has only been speculated from practical observation. \n\nSCP-030-VN has the ability to anomalously stimulate the human pineal gland, allowing any subject who consumed SCP-030-VN to directly interfere with their own far-metaphysical memory zone, which is positioned outside of the normal human nervous system. This phenomenon allows the subject to surpass all physical, chemical and biological limits in recalling every event ever sensed by themselves in a limited time frame in reverse chronological order. The scope of memories recalled is proportional to the extent that their pineal gland is stimulated, which is directly correlated to the amount of SCP-030-VN consumed.  \n\n@@ @@\n----\n= **##red|Addendum 1##**\n= **EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING THE ANOMALOUS PROPERTIES OF SCP-030-VN**\n----\n\n||~ Subject||~ Consumed Amount ||~ Administered Form||~ Results||\n|| D-49345 || 0,2 mg/kg || Through subject’s digestive system || Subject showed symptoms of moderate vomiting, and was medically treated to prevent the excretion of SCP-030-VN.

The Commodore will do his best to delay the journey, so that we can catch up with the Squadron timely in Hong Kong at the end of April.\n\n[...] These people are friendlier than I thought, which is different from populated anomalous sites in the West. The population primarily consists of Annamite and Chinese, mostly possessing no anomalous abilities, and are mainly families of magicians with knowledge of thaumaturgy.

At least they are willing to fight to the end on the seas, the shores, the fields, the streets, the hills without any thoughts about surrendering.\n\n[...] As I witnessed countless inventions of the Pasteur Institute being utilised as biological weapons, for the first time I had to question the advancement of science, and it was also the first time my belief in the Neo Enlightenment movement wavered this much. The things I have done and contributed, are they morally justified, and will they ever be meaningful for the future?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Nha Trang, Indochina, 01/03/1943//\n[[/>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n|name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Yersin_House.jpg\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|caption=POI-220963’s private residence in Nha Trang around the year 1900.]]\n\nThe moment I had long awaited has finally arrived. As a doctor who has practiced his profession all his life, I know how long I have left to live. It is time I get to experience what he did. One pill is enough, its efficacy was adjusted to the optimum level, thanks to our decades of work.\n\nOh, now I understand, that’s how it is. The future is not predetermined by some unseeable higher being, or a sacred script pre-written, but by the choices we humans made, which are unfortunately, extremely predictable. We are creatures constructed from past experiences, we make decisions according to what we have gone through, like a shallow book with an easily predictable ending.\n\nRight at this moment, my small intellect suddenly turns into Laplace’s demon. [[footnote]] “We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state and as the cause of the state that is to follow. An intelligence knowing all the forces acting in nature at a given instant, as well as the momentary positions of all things in the universe, would be able to comprehend in one single formula the motions of the largest bodies as well as the lightest atoms in the world, provided that its intellect were sufficiently powerful to subject all data to analysis; to it nothing would be uncertain, the future as well as the past would be present to its eyes.”  -- //Pierre Laplace, A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities// [[/footnote]] With enough data about the past, any of us can play the role of a prophet.\n\nWhen you guys arrive, take all the documents you need, leave everything else, and do not touch my body, you have half a day to acquire them before my housekeeper comes the next morning. I have no more regrets, I am aware of the meanings of what I have done. I wish you success in finding applications for the results of my research.\n\n\nWe die in the dark, so they can live in the light.\n\n[[>]]\n-- //Gentlemen Alexandre// ███ --\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFoundation agents tasked with observing POI-220963 have decided to break in after observing no movement from the subject’s bedroom for an extended period. The subject was found deceased while peacefully asleep and smiling, with the aforementioned letter beside him. The Foundation quickly retrieved all relevant documents in the scene before the subject’s housekeeper discovered the situation.\n\nAll of POI-220963’s research regarding SCP-030-VN has been recovered and further developed by the Foundation. In the years 1950’s, the results of these studies became the prototype of class W, X, Y, and Z [[[updated-amnestics-guide|Mnestics]]], which are widely used in the antimemetic field and to contain memory-affecting anomalies.
