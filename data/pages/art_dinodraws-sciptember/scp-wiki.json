I loved the SCP itself, the MTF coming in defense of this entity in the face of a cruel doctor and giving that doctor a metaphorical (and probably literal once) middle finger. Does this doggy have a name? They should name the dog. \n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Day 3 - Twisted Pines]]\noh god oh fuck i forgot this one i'll get back to it i prommy\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Day 4 - Apian]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/NjAD9N4.png]]\nDone for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4611 'SCP-4661'] by [[*user Mortos]]\nThis entry fucking bizarred me and I wanted to draw. bear,,,, \nputting a whole new meaning to the term 'bugbear' methinks dfjghdfkjgdjkfhg\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Day 5 - Skeletal]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/xKYmuLh.png]]\nOh look I did something on time this time!! Found [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2999 SCP-2999]  by [[*user Fantem]] and liked the funky kibby. (SCP-2999-B) \nDr. Staurt <3 \nThe SCP in general is honestly very cool! I liked the story told with -A and -B. (And the main image on the page fucking jumpscared me. \"it's gonna fuckin move\" I mutter, still jumping when it does.)\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Day 6 - Future]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/3V27xHg.jpg]]\nI found [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5215 SCP-5215] and chose it from both title (\"Whelp. Sky's Haunted\") and aesthetic. I'm a sucker for celestial/star themes!\nI just think it was a funky little SCP, messing with fonts to find something that fit what the SCP's description had was fun too!\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** fpuVxsC.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/fpuVxsC Imgur]\n\n> **Filename:** 05MkmW7.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/05MkmW7 Imgur]\n\n> **Filename:** NjAD9N4.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/NjAD9N4 Imgur]\n\n> **Filename:** xKYmuLh.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/xKYmuLh Imgur]\n\n> **Filename:** 3V27xHg.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/3V27xHg Imgur]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
