While conducting initial geological testing for the Aswan Low Dam renovation, Suez Canal Company workers accidentally breached an underwater chamber, releasing a flow of viscous white fluid. Workers 15 meters from the Lake Nasser embankment made physical contact with the fluid and experienced immediate glossolalia.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**glossolalia:** The phenomenon of speaking in an unknown language. Known colloquially as \"speaking in tongues.\"[[/span]]\n\nLanguage interpretation officials[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The Suez Canal Company employed a multitude of national and international specialists during its pre-Suez Crisis management of the Suez Canal region, which includes American, British, French, Saudi, and Egyptian nationals.[[/span]] identified the glossolalia as pre-Ptolemaic Era Egyptian. The phenomenon affected one Maat Mohamed (designated Person of Interest #11366) for the next three days. Mohamed later underwent medical evacuation at St. Sophia's Asylum -- a Foundation-owned medical facility -- under the guise of demonic possession affecting his memetic health. He became the first recorded vector for SCP-3739-1 phenomena.\n\nThe following is a translated excerpt of a key phrase spoken by Mohamed:\n\n[[div class=\"log\"]]\n**##gray|\"Bat,##**[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Bat:** The name of a Middle Egyptian goddess associated with femininity and fertility, typically depicted as a cow or ox.[[/span]] **##gray|my Earthly mother. She leads me out of the depths of my head. She says it is nutritious. Should I siphon the teat?\"##**\n[[/div]]\n\nWhilst in the recreational room at St. Sophia's Asylum, Mohamed imitated marketing jargon from commercials and shows played on television. He produced SCP-3739-1 marketing jargon after viewing Coca-Cola advertisements.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Corporate advertisements used minor compulsion memetics (which POI-11366 was likely affected by) until the UNGOC Extranormal Advertisement Act passed in 1961. [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere[[/span]] falls outside legal jurisdiction because of its location in metaphysical space.[[/span]] A week into his inpatient stay, Mohamed lactated, flooding his room. Mohamed displayed no further anomalous properties over the course of his month-long psychiatric containment.\n\nThree months after his release, Mohamed fled Egypt, escaping Foundation surveillance. Local law enforcement discovered his apartment abandoned, containing the following materials:\n\n# Publications by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Sigmund Freud.\n# Books on cattle farming and entrepreneurship.\n# Several documents indicating plans to establish a dairy farm.\n# A bathroom containing 200 liters of curdled milk in the sinks, toilet, and bathtub.\n\nThe Foundation became aware of [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere[[/span]] in 20██ following a sudden influx of online and television advertisements flagged with memetic and cognitohazardous properties. The advertisements drew a similarity to POI-11366's behavior, prompting a formal investigation. The Department of Analytics tracked [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere[[/span]] company presence for several years but could not locate physical operation locations.\n\nAs of 2023, [[span class=\"moo\"]]Moosphere[[/span]] has reported a total global workforce of 61,000 employees. With anomalous control of an estimated 1% of the noöspheric market share, their product manufacturing output has a capacity 100 times a company of its size.\n\nIn June 2023, Analytics Management deployed field operatives (impersonating FDA inspectors) to multiple Eastern Wisconsin dairy farms flagged with irregularities. The following is one such inspection.\n\n[[div class=\"log-bg\"]]\n[[div class=\"log\"]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▷ Recovery Log 3739.2 ◁\" hide=\"△ Recovery Log 3739.2 △\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: left\"]]\n+++ VIDEO LOG\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n(//NOTE: Keys for format: Time | Source of Sound//)\n\n**0m 00s |** @@[@@//Field Agents Smith and Wollensky are inside a police car, driving on roads intersecting cornfields and distant barns.

The livestream, entitled \"Sights of Wausaukee, Northeastern Wisconsin,\" displayed normative footage of the town's attractions interspersed with shocking imagery of large, writhing, gelatinous bovine masses. Simurgh.aic could not determine a geolocation and blocked the stream.\n\nFoundation officials investigated Wausaukee as part of a mandatory sweep for anomalous threats. An attached crew of field pataphysicists detected an aberrant mass of 150,000 individual bovine memes in and around the town, most of which centered on a 640 m^^2^^ area. MTF-Eta-33 members initiated further investigation, and with the help of pataphysicists, tracked the memes to a nearby warehouse at the town's outskirts.\n\nA raid on the facility was scheduled for the following evening. Aware of the pataphysical findings, Site-82 Command became convinced of a likely risk to civilian populations and authorized the use of esoteric materials to combat potential oneiric threats and anomalous dairy entities.\n----\n**EXPLORATION TEAM:** MTF-η-33\n\n**TEAM MEMBERS:**\n* η-1 / Samara Maclear\n* η-2 / Eli Hall\n* η-3 / Allen Foxglove\n\n**TEAM NOTES:** Task force specialists were selected based on:\n# Their teamwork skills.\n# Pataphysical markers pointing to their archetypal significance, necessary for an operation of this nature.\n\n**EQUIPMENT:**\n* Three sets of standard Spectra-fiber body armor. Each set is fitted with multiple built-in body cameras, a transmission stream, and headset.\n* Infrared night-vision goggles.\n* Three M4 carbines.\n* One tactical astral projection kit and subdermal sigil (carried by η-1).\n* One reconnaissance drone and a remote controller (carried by η-2).\n* One breach kit (carried by η-3).\n* [[[scp-3863|SCP-3863]]]-1-type milk-honey, 250 mL.\n\n**PREAMBLE:** A small team of MTF-η-33 specialists deployed via combat search and rescue helicopter. On arrival, the cast iron and steel roofing were partially collapsed, leaving a large breach above the warehouse.\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG | 09:47 PM]**\n----\n**«9:47:»** η-1 and η-3 hold position outside the front entrance. η-2 operates a quadcopter drone over the exposed roof.\n\n**«9:50:»** The drone enters a dimly lit interior containing 25 docile cows inside compact rooms, guarded behind slide-doors. The cows display fitted metallic portholes on their left flank and udders.\n\n**«9:52:»** Manure and hay compositions surround a hole directly beneath the roof's breach. Gelatinous purple tubing networks lead out of the hole and crisscross between compact cow stalls.\n\n**«9:57:»** The drone feed captures generic farming utilities, fertilizer, and seed bags.\n\n**«9:58:»** Small outlines move within bushes near η-1's camera. η-1 shines her flashlight at the location of movement. After a moment, η-1 states, \"//Negative sighting, remain alert//.\"\n\n**«9:58:»** η-1 gestures an \"all-clear\" signal. η-2 places the drone on auto-pilot and nods to η-3. η-3 installs a breach charge at the facility's front doors. The three pile behind a breaching blanket.\n\n**«9:59:»** The charge detonates. η-3 enters the facility, followed by η-2 and η-1.\n\n**«10:01:»** The team proceeds through a tight windowless vestibule into a wide foyer. No persons are present within, and the interior lacks light sources. Team members activate night-vision.\n\n**«10:04:»** The team makes a thorough sweep of the area, and two-thirds of the way down, turns left. They encounter a door, ajar, to an open office space. The office displays hundreds of laminated posters, each sporting motivational messages overlaid onto stock images of persons consuming dairy products.\n\n**«10:06:»** η-1 discovers milk leaking from the ceiling. Drone feed captures undulating movement from no discernible source. η-2 whispers, \"//It's coming from everywhere//.\"\n\n**«10:07:»** η-1 takes a milk sample, enclosing it in a rally bag. The milk emits a faint green bioluminescence.\n\n**«10:08:»** η-3 leads the team into an antechamber at the back of the office and claims he \"//smells a sulfuric scent//.\" η-1 activates electro-photonic sensors and registers aetheric radiation[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A byproduct of aetheric energy, which powers all Thaumatology.[[/span]] leaking from an adjacent chamber.\n\n**«10:09:»** η-3 pushes into the next chamber, which is filled with curdled milk. η-3 opens a metal door, drawing his carbine. A cow comes into view, mooing. Aetheric emission flows from its posterior, consistent with bovine flatulence.\n\n**«10:11:»** The team returns to the foyer, traveling east through winding halls.\n\n**«10:15:»** A tremor shakes the facility, followed by a long bovine vocalization. η-1's milk sample vibrates and grows ten times in volume. She abandons the sample.\n\n**«10:18:»** η-3 reports a 3-meter-wide teat intersecting through support columns. The teat leaks faint green fluids.\n\n**«10:19:»** η-1 makes incisions into the teat, revealing more flesh within. The flesh gurgles and pushes through the incision, consuming the cutting implement. She abandons cutting operation.\n\n**«10:20:»** The drone views cows either fleeing from, or charging toward, an indiscernible point.\n\n**«10:23:»** η-3 heaves open frosted double doors into a massive chamber ~20 meters in height that slopes downward toward the center. A writhing light brown udder (hereafter \"**Udder**\") of indeterminable width fills the chamber, producing hundreds of large teats, which stretch and collapse. Sleeping persons, presumably employees, levitate mid-air and upside down in groups of three around smaller teats. Cream cheese flows in bulk from their craniums down into a giant subterranean tank below.\n\n**«10:24:»** η-2's drone captures footage of a cow falling from an upper walkway, yelping. A moment before striking the floor, the Udder trembles. The cow contacts the floor in slow-motion and dissolves into a translucent white liquid. This liquid flows toward the room's center.\n\n**«10:25:»** Additional cows follow until all 25 have fallen. Newly transmogrified fluids spray the team members.\n\n**«10:27:»** A pale, floating pink udder (**SCP-3739-1-B**) approaches the trio. η-1 recoils, clutching her temples -- she receives a telepathic payload. η-1 asks, \"//What do you want?//\" The entity undulates as if laughing and approaches the team. η-3 fires on the entity. In due part to its apparent metaphysical nature, it does not take damage.\n\n**«10:27:»** η-1 and η-3 share a nod. η-3 then stands at guard in front of her, and η-2 steps beside him. η-1 sets down her tool kit and unpacks it. She burns incense and reads an excerpt from her personal dream journal.\n\n**«10:28:»** The entity sports multiple arms that unfold from within each other and into view. It grows an attractive, plump face, spewing off-white fluids from its mouth. With a giggle and piercing shriek, it says, \"//Your mother wants you to finish your milk//.\"\n\n**«10:29:»** η-2 trains the drone on a fleshy off-color sack near the middle of the Udder's anterior face. η-3 levels his carbine, waiting to fire.\n\n**«10:30:»** η-2 says, \"//I'm lactose intolerant//,\" and curses the entity with reductionist profanities. The drone registers natural chemosignals[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Pheromones used to convey emotion and directions to those under its effect.[[/span]] emerging from the entity (hereafter \"**Mother**\"). Fifteen smaller bovine entities with the appearance of animated cartoon characters (SCP-3739-1-C, hereafter \"**Children**\") separate from the Udder. Ten Children bombard η-2 with runny cream cheese projectiles. Others siphon fluids directly from the Mother and chant: \"//Eat it! Eat it!//\"\n\nη-2 refuses to comply.\n\n**«10:31:»** η-1 strikes a match, burning her thumb tip. She thumbs her tactical sigil, and then downs the milk-honey. Her body goes limp. An astral body sprouts up from her physical body's chest and flips toward the Mother. She grabs at loose teats and pulls.\n\n**«10:32:»** η-2 is fully covered in cream cheese but refuses to consume it. The Children drag him toward the Udder, causing him to drop the remote control as he fights to be freed. They force a leaking teat into his mouth. He has no choice but to comply.\n\n**«10:33:»** η-1 combats the Mother. Both scream, trading blows. η-3 walks to the Udder, aims, and fires at the exposed fleshy protrusion. He yells, \"//You're not real//.\" The flesh goes erect and sprays raw milk at him. He consumes the milk at will, downing liters without apparent stress.\n\n**«10:34:»** η-1 spirals and pirouettes through the air, faster than the Mother. It squeezes green liquids at her. She grabs a teat and stretches it with ease. The Mother screams in shock, deflates, and then falls to the floor. A palpable wet smack echoes throughout the room. The entity finally becomes tangible, leaking the rest of its fluids.\n\n**«10:35:»** η-2 is no longer visible. The large Udder shakes and spills raw milk into the vast room. η-1's astral body reconnects with her physical body. She ditches the astral projection kit. η-1 and η-3 escape.\n----\n= **[END LOG | 10:35 PM]**\n----\n**EXTRACTION:** Post-log footage taken autonomously from η-2's drone records η-2 screaming in distress. This occurs for roughly 30 minutes as the warehouse fills with milk.\n\nNear the end of the footage, η-2 emerges naked, and a disembodied cattle branding prosthesis marks him on the upper thigh. He shudders, mooing. The prosthesis spots the drone, extends, and emits electricity from a cattle prod, frying it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"raisa-block\"]]\n++++ __RAISA POST-INVESTIGATION NOTICE__\n\nBetween [[span class=\"spangles\"]]12 October[[/span]] and [[span class=\"spangles\"]]19 October 2023[[/span]], a wide-scale interrogation campaign across U.S. farmlands reveals that over 3,100 oneiric advertisements coerced dairy corporate executives, regional managers, and ranchers to sign away rights to their dreams.\n\nOn [[span class=\"spangles\"]]21 November 2023[[/span]], several hundred livestock facilities experience bovine and human inflation.
