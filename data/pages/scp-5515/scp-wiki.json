Anyone who made visual contact with SCP-5515 would anomalously gain awareness of the fact that SCP-5515 possessed a vitally important secret known to no other living person.\n\nThose affected by SCP-5515 also experienced occasional intrusive thoughts about possible means of extracting this information from SCP-5515. These thoughts were often violent in nature, but did not compel an affected subject to carry out the action. Attempts to nonviolently ascertain the information possessed by SCP-5515 or determine its possible relevance to the Foundation and its goals were unsuccessful. \n\nPersonnel involved in containment of SCP-5515 reported mental fatigue and negative emotional states as a result of intrusive thoughts. Those dealing with such issues were encouraged to write down the thoughts that bothered them as a cognitive therapy exercise and research opportunity. Examples of submissions are given below:\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I threatened his family.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I gave him a lap dance.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I beat him within an inch of his life.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I made him eat glass.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I strapped him to the underside of a helicopter and flew him over the Grand Tsingy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I covered him in honey and stapled live rats to him by the tail.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I stitched his lips to the end of a pool noodle.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I put duct tape on his corneas and pulled.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I slammed a door on his foot until his toes fell off. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I stuck a scissor blade all the way under his fingernail and snipped.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I shoved a razor between each of his teeth til they were wedged in his jawbones.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I pumped him full of drugs and made him eat his wife alive.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I ordered the Foundation to bomb every city on earth one by one. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I pulled the tendons from his hands and sucked them up like spaghetti. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I cut off a little bit of him every day until there was nothing left. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I cut spirals in his skin and peeled him like an orange.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I gave him too much Ritalin and let him watch me drill holes in his bones.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"thot\"]]\nHe would tell me his secret if I blowtorched every inch of his body, gave him an escharotomy, and then did it again after his scar tissue grew in.\n[[/div]]\n\n\nOn 13/03/2020, SCP-5515 confessed to Foundation personnel that he was a closeted homosexual. Special concessions were made to allow SCP-5515 to come out publicly via social media, after which all anomalous activity ceased. SCP-5515 was pronounced neutralized, administered selective amnestics, and later emigrated to Canada with the aid of Foundation resources.\n\nThe origins of SCP-5515's anomalous properties remain unknown. SCP-5515 has claimed to have full knowledge of how the phenomenon began, what party was responsible, and what that party plans to do next. SCP-5515 readily offered this information to the Foundation at several junctures; however, no testimony was ever documented due to a lack of interest among presiding staff.\n\n[[module CSS]]\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Karla&display=swap');\n\n.thot {\n  width: 50%;\n  margin: 10px auto;\n  border: 1px solid #c9c9c9;\n  background: #ebebeb;\n  padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;\n  font-family: 'Karla', sans-serif;  \n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  letter-spacing: -0.05em;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\nPeppo Jamcon 2020 \n<< [[[SCP-5031]]] | SCP-5515 | [[[SCP-5155]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5514]]] | SCP-5515 | [[[SCP-5516]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
