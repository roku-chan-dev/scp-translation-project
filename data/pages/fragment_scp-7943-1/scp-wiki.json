Further testing is forbidden by order of Site Director Meyer. _\n\n**Description:** SCP-7943 is a solid cube 46 cm in width with numerous minor anomalous properties. Any attempt to test for a new property is likely to cause it to manifest a new property to ensure that the test returns a positive result. It is expected to remain static and harmless if no further testing is performed. The only current safety concern is that it emits ionizing radiation.  _\n\n**Personal Note:** //\"Leave this one alone. It's for the best.\"// - Dr. Mendoza  _\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7943|For further information, the archived investigation process is available here.]]]\n[[/<]]",
