SCP-1938 also has a catastrophic effect on the behavior of site information technology and security personnel, forcing them to laugh uncontrollably, break down into tears, then become incoherently angry at life (generally in that order).\n\nThis ability is suspected to result from SCP-1938's inability to understand that all those stupid \"click me\" emails aren't actually telling you that you won some stupid prize or that a hundred puppies will die if you don't forward the goddamn thing.\n\nSCP-1938 came to the attention of Site 06-3's technical staff following an incident in which she reported sluggish computer performance and requested assistance. The responding technician performed a cursory inspection of the affected terminal and discovered that its hard drive contained a physically impossible amount of viruses.\n\n**Addendum 1938-1:** Researcher Note\n\n> As a reminder to all site staff, if you're gonna prank each other with this kind of stuff, keep it to yourselves and don't \"accidentally\" file personal documentation in the primary containment database.\n> \n> And, no, I'm not authorizing the request to ban Dr. Walker from the network. She needs to work, and you need to keep her terminal working.\n> \n> Dr. ████ ████\n> Site Director, Humanoid Containment Site 06-3\n\n**Addendum 1938-2:** Technician Note\n\n> With all due respect, you realize that she infected her //phone// with a virus, right? It's not even a smartphone!\n> \n> ████ █████\n> Information Technology, Humanoid Containment Site 06-3\n\n**Addendum 1938-3:** Researcher Note\n\n> Not funny, guys. This was mean and completely out of line.\n> \n> Dr. Mary-Ann Walker\n> Researcher, Anthropology Department\n> \n> //Win $5000 in cold hard cash!
