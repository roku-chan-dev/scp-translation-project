All settlements within ten miles of SCP-7415's outermost perimeter of effect must be evacuated by 2030, using pro-urban life propaganda, economic decay for the surrounding area, and the creation of a false crisis to raise the urgency to move.\n\nThe perimeter of SCP-7415 must be surrounded by Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA), spaced twenty feet from one another. Outpost-7415 is responsible for monitoring SCP-7415 and SCP-7415-LAUREN. No further action is required.\n\nSCP-7415-STEPHEN is on the Foundation Watchlist. Interviews with SCP-7415-STEPHEN are to be conducted annually to assess their mental health.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7415 is a reality-altering area centered around Darrell High School and surrounding Darrell, Texas. SCP-7415 qualifies as a Class-B episodic time loop, where subjects within SCP-7415 are disconnected from their continuity, constantly reverting to their initial physical state when a change occurs.[[footnote]]Unlike Class-A episodic loops, Class-B loops follow a universal baseline temporal continuity, preventing the effects of elapsed time instead of undermining temporal stability.[[/footnote]] SCP-7415's episodic loop is centered around the period of time from June 1975 to May 1976. Residents of SCP-7415 are unaware of this phenomenon, assuming SCP-7415 is a component of baseline reality.\n\nWhen a subject enters SCP-7415, they will experience a cognitohazardous effect that will mentally regress them to their late teens. Subjects that have gone through secondary school will integrate themselves into SCP-7415, reporting feelings of nostalgia and regret. These effects dissipate once the subject is removed from SCP-7415.\n\nSCP-7415 is maintained through two Type-Green reality-benders, designated as SCP-7415-STEPHEN and SCP-7415-LAUREN. All reality-benders are seniors at Darrell High School and seem to be aware of their influence on SCP-7415.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7415 was discovered in 1998 when the U.S. Department of Education noticed records from Darrell High School indicating that no changes in the student population had occurred since the 1975-1976 school year. After multiple attempts to contact the school failed, a representative was sent to Darrell, Texas. Foundation forces intervened after the representative had been missing for two months.\n\n**Addendum 7415.1:** Observation Logs\n\nUpon Foundation intervention, Outpost-7415 was constructed to monitor SCP-7415 on the outskirts of Darrell, Texas. Video surveillance footage of Darrell High School was rerouted to Outpost-7415 for observation.

Your CRV is pretty high, you hated school, I just want to hear the specifics. Whenever you're ready.\n\n**Martinez:** Well, my mom worked in the military and was moving around. My dad and I followed her around until around the middle of my freshman year. I'd already been hit with the pain of making and losing friends in elementary and middle school, so I didn't really make friends when I arrived.\n\nThere wasn't really one notable event, it was just a lot of constant little things that added up. The food, the teachers, the people. It was just annoying, all of it. Add that to the fact that my mom wasn't present for most of it, and it becomes my own personal hellhole.\n\n**Steele:** Sorry to hear that. Was there anyone in particular that was close to you? Anyone you might //remember?//\n\n**Martinez:** Yeah, there was this one girl, Selena. She was the only person I could tolerate. She was in most of my classes, the only one that tried to talk to me when I moved in. The other kids ragged on her a lot through the years, made her the \"weird kid.\"\n\nOne time they started hiding her things. Anytime she was gone, they'd take her pens, her water bottle, she had this necklace she loved, last gift from her mother, and they hid it. When she couldn't find them, she just went to the bathroom and cried. That's when I knew that they were irredeemable.\n\n**Steele:** That's awful.\n\n**Martinez:** It's not even that, it's that these kids were the \"popular\" ones. They weren't popular, they were just flashy and we knew their names! When I found out what happened, I went and gave them flat tires. All of them. Fuckers deserved it. Worst years of my life.\n\n**Steele:** What happened to her after you graduated? Do you keep in touch?\n\n**Martinez:** No, we got into a fight near the end of it and didn't makeup. I don't know what happened to her. I don't even remember what the fight was about. I just regret losing my only friend.\n\n**Steele:** Okay, I think you're fit to go in. Your CRV will make up for any nostalgia you still have. Keep a sharp mind and check in with us regularly.

A faceless figure addresses the class as the teacher. “FUTURE PLANS” is written on the chalkboard.)//\n\n**Teacher:** (mid-lecture) Well, it’s part of growing up. Y’know, I remember what it was like when I was your age. I remember living my senior year like it was my last. This is the last time you’ll have the freedom to do what you want without any of the major responsibilities.\n\nLook around at the people in this class with you. There’s a high chance that you’ll never see these people again after you graduate. You’ll move away, you’ll get a job somewhere else, and you’ll start a new life. And you’ll look back on these days fondly because you were young.\n\n//(Martinez prepares the reality anchor in the back of the class, unnoticed by the figures.)//\n\n**Teacher:** Enjoy it while it lasts. Enjoy it while it lasts. Enjoy it while it lasts.\n\n//(The teacher continues to repeat the phrase until Martinez activates the anchor. The figures disappear, leaving the classroom empty. Martinez gets up and leaves the room. She walks down the hallway, retracing her steps.)//\n\n**Martinez:** That's it?! That's all they were scared about? No family issues, no present danger, they're just some kids that don't want to grow up?!\n\nIt makes no sense. Why would anyone want to do this to themselves? Just live out the worst four years of their life.[[footnote]]At this point, Martinez had succumbed to SCP-7415’s cognitohazardous effect and mentally regressed to her teenage years.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Command:** Focus on the mission, Miranda — one more left.\n\n**Martinez:** (scoffs) You can’t tell me what to do. Nobody can. Who do they think they are, forcing everything through this because they’re babies about it?\n\n**Command:** Martinez, are you okay? We’re sending another counter meme, just in case.\n\n//(Martinez groans in frustration and shuts the receiving end of her headphones. Command is still able to hear Martinez.)//\n\n**Martinez:** (screaming) And I put up these anchors and what? They can just continue living their fantasy because they're too scared to get out of their own selfish, fucking heads! Is that it?! Are they just going to float around in their senior year and avoid growing up, while everyone else has to suffer because of them?\n\n(scoffs) I’m dragging them out of here, and I'll give them a piece of my mind.\n\n[[=]]\n**<<END LOG>>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**EXPLORATION LOG**\n[[/=]]\n------\n**Date:** October 9th, 1999\n**Involved Personnel:** Agent Martinez\n**Mission:** Exit SCP-7415\n------\n[[=]]\n**<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n[[/=]]\n\n//(Martinez reaches the front entrance. Heavy rain hits the front windows with an occasional clap of thunder. A crowd of students blocks the entrance. SCP-7415-LAUREN and SCP-7415-STEPHEN stand at the front, facing Agent Martinez. SCP-7415-LAUREN is visibly agitated.)//\n\n**Lauren:** Well, there you are! What have you been doing, sneaking around like that?\n\n**Martinez:** Both of you, turn it off. We’re leaving.\n\n**Lauren:** Turn it off? Turn it off?!\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN stomps her foot, causing the floor to shift to a sharp incline. Agent Martinez loses her balance and falls toward the crowd, who immediately swarm her.)//\n\n**Lauren:** (yelling) I am not letting another nosy outsider mess with this!\n\n//(The crowd grabs at Agent Martinez’s limbs, holding her down. All members of the crowd are faceless, with their rubber skin sinking into their orifices. Martinez is unable to overpower them.)//\n\n**Lauren:** I only wanted this to last! Don’t you remember being a kid? Why would you want to take that away?!\n\n//(Orchestral music is played from an indiscernible source. SCP-7415-LAUREN approaches Martinez and makes eye contact. The floor levels.)//\n\n**Lauren:** (shaking) You have to remember don’t you? Don’t you remember your mom dropping you off at school? All your friends that you’ve known all your life? Your boyfriend treating you to ice cream after a rough test? The football games, the school dances? Remember the smell of the damp carpet after a thunderstorm knocks out power in the middle of class? Can’t you remember the rain?!\n\n//(Tears begin forming in SCP-7415-LAUREN’s eyes. Agent Martinez struggles for a minute, then spits in SCP-7415-LAUREN’s general direction.)//\n\n**Martinez:** Oh, grow up.\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN’s eyes widen. She clenches her hands into fists and glares at Martinez, mumbling to herself.)//\n\n**Stephen:** Uh, Lauren?\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN turns to face SCP-7415-STEPHEN. Her demeanor visibly relaxes. She gives a slight smile.)//\n\n**Lauren:** Stephen! Sorry you have to see this side of me, but I’m doing this for… for us! We just need to-\n\n**Stephen:** Lauren, I don’t know how to say this, but I think the lady is right. We need a break from all this.\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN smile drops immediately. She takes a step backward.)//\n\n**Lauren:** You… you want to leave?\n\n**Stephen:** No, of course not! I’m just saying we can leave together! It’s just gotten a little boring, and-\n\n**Lauren:** Boring?! I’m too boring for you?\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN takes several steps backward, stepping on one of the crowd member’s arm. It shrieks and lets go of Martinez’s right arm, allowing her to pull out an emergency reality anchor and set it down.)//\n\n//(The crowd members release Martinez and enter a dazed state. They begin to claw at their faces in shock and panic. SCP-7415-LAUREN turns around and notices the member’s autonomy.)//\n\n**Lauren:** (panicked) Calm down guys! It’s only temporary, so just, uhm…\n\n//(Martinez attempts to leave the building but is interrupted by SCP-7415-STEPHEN.)//\n\n**Stephen:** (softly) Are you leaving the school?\n\n//(Martinez glances at the door and then at SCP-7415-LAUREN, who is trying to calm the crowd members. She looks back at SCP-7415-STEPHEN and nods.)//\n\n**Stephen:** Then can you….\n\n//(SCP-7415-STEPHEN looks longingly at SCP-7415-LAUREN.)//\n\n**Stephen:** Take me with you.\n\n//(Martinez nods again, grabs SCP-7415-STEPHEN's hand, and begins moving towards the exit. SCP-7415-LAUREN notices and attempts to move toward them, tripping on wailing crowd members laying on the floor.)//\n\n**Lauren:** STEPHEN! No, don’t go! We can- agh!\n\n//(SCP-7415-LAUREN trips and falls. She reaches out her hand, tears running down her cheeks.)//\n\n**Lauren:** (softly) Please don’t go.\n\n//(Agent Martinez and SCP-7415-STEPHEN exit the school and approach Outpost-7415. As they distance themselves from SCP-7415’s center, the weather begins to clear and the rain stops.)//\n[[=]]\n**<<END LOG>>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 7415.5:** Relocation\n\nSCP-7415-STEPHEN has since entered Foundation custody.
