Representations of states, of concepts, of true being.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6747|The True Narrative]]] splayed itself across my mind and all things. Everything, interconnected, intersected, interacting.\n\nI knew what fulfillment was.  I knew what glory was. I knew what beauty was.\n\nAnd then I saw the door. The door away from physicality. Away from functionality. Away from flesh.\n\nIt brought me into the world of ideas and forms. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6699|Trueness.]]]\n\nI came through, I felt warmth.\n\n//The door promised lies.//\n\nIt was horror.\n\nI saw everything, everywhere, everyhow, everywhat, **everywhy**.\n\nI was lesser again.\n\nI was dust.\n\nAnd then the other gods came.\n\nGrand.\n\nComplex.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659|Uncompromising.]]]\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Sisters.]]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub|Twins.]]] They condemned my very form and being. Both in unison and in opposition.\n\nA [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cotsk-hub|king dressed in red]]] cut me down and drank my blood.\n\nA [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3125|foreign, fathomless five-finned fish]]] ripped my mind apart.\n\nA [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747|queen crowned by thorns]]] smothered me away from all.\n\nI heard a dark howling ring throughout my body and then I knew what nothingness was.\n\nAnd when all was done, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/don-t-let-the-fire-die|I found a note]]]. A kind note. A comforting note.\n\nAnd I was sent back to flesh once more.\n\n------\n\nI write this as a warning. A warning for all that we are all but fish.\n\nFish in a vast ocean.\n\nFish in the sunlight.\n\nDo not sink.\n\nDo not dive.\n\nTerror awaits there.\n\nOne must accept:\n\nThe flesh is more kind than the mind.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
