MTF-Xi-75 (\"The Sniveling Scips\") is assigned to attend these performances and monitor the venues themselves for suspicious activity. In the event SCP-5075 manifests, MTF-Xi-75 will secure the area and alert the Amnestics Department for the detainment of civilians.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5075 was the designation given to the Merseybeat/garage-rock band known as //The Porcelain Gang Bang//, who were active between 1961 and 1975. Music performed by SCP-5075 often dealt with themes of anti-authoritarianism, pestilence, and sexual activity. Music performed by SCP-5075 was sung in a mixture of English and an unidentified second language, and possibly carried a memetic effect that allowed all listeners to understand the lyrics in a literal and emotional sense.\n\nThe members of SCP-5075 (designated 5075-1 through -4) were humanoid entities dressed in costumes resembling 16th century English masquerade ball outfits with porcelain comedy masks.\n\nSCP-5075 demonstrated the ability to materialize and dematerialize, often appearing in a flicker of light during performances. However, they notably only manifested at venues that could house no more than 900 attendees (primarily pubs). Though the entities were always included on the set list and promotional material of performances they manifested at, organizers do not recall interacting with SCP-5075 or any individual member.\n\nSCP-5075's music appeared to have a psychotropic effect on listeners, causing existential melancholy or overwhelming dread. A select amount of listeners, hereby referred to as SCP-5075-A, expressed feelings of malaise and incompleteness after listening to SCP-5075, and noted a desire to learn the music themselves.\n\n------\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-5075-001: Interview Log (1963)\" hide=\"- Addendum-5075-001: Interview Log (1963)\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n= **Interview Log**\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Geoff Simpson\n\n**Interviewee(s):** SCP-5075-1, SCP-5075-2\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-5075-1 and -2 were informed that Researcher Simpson was a journalist from the occult talk show //Thautamenagerie//, which was active from 1951 to 1999. \n\n------\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Simpson <speaking to the camera>:** Is it rolling? Okay. Good evening!

They're fancy, yeah, very pretty, but don't they get hot?\n\n**SCP-5075-1:** What costumes?\n\n//There is a brief pause, before -1 and -2 burst into laughter. Simpson smiles.//\n\n**SCP-5075-2:** A'ight, a'ight, I'll admit, yeah, we dress up a li'l fancy, we never got to back home! It was horrible, we had to dress like peasants, yeah.\n\n**SCP-5075-1:** There wasn't a lot we was allowed to do at 'ome- it was all fuckin', dyin' and watchin' the [[[scp 701|plays]]]- well, okay, haha, the plays were fun, great fun.\n\n**SCP-5075-2:** Oohoo, great fun, yeah!

SCP-5075-1 laughs, and SCP-5075-2's hand remains on SCP-5075-1's knee.//\n\n**Simpson:** So, you say you aren't from around here, where are you from?\n\n**SCP-5075-1:** Don't worry about that bit, it's the mystery that makes it worth the attendance. Same reason we don't sell vinyl.\n\n//All three laugh.//\n\n**SCP-5075-1:** Besides... they don't want us, back [[[scp 2264|home]]]. They don't like us, \"smears on the community\", the Ambassador says.\n\n**Simpson:** Oh, dear. My deepest apologies. Pardon me, but, the Ambassador?\n\n**SCP-5075-2:** Ye'h… the jester, sits all high and mighty, up in their, their, uh, hole in the ground, just rubbish. Rubbish, they are, everything has to be for them- But we don't perform for them, right?\n\n**SCP-5075-1:** 'Ight! We only perform for the King! Spreading the sounds, the true will and such.\n\n//Both entities laugh and SCP-5075-2 takes its hand off of SCP-5075-1's knee. Simpson appears confused, but quickly regains his composure.//\n\n**Simpson:** Aha! You certainly are from somewhere else. I can't believe I'm asking this so late in the interview, but, what are your names?\n\n//SCP-5075-1 and SCP-5075-2 exchange glances.//\n\n**SCP-5075-2:** Don't worry about that bit. \n\n//SCP-5075-2 places its fingers to its lips.//\n\n//SCP-5075-1 laughs. Simpson briefly talks to the camera about SCP-5075 attempting to mimic promotional material, has SCP-5075-1 and SCP-5075-2 say goodbye, and then ends the interview.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-5075-002: Melody Maker magazine report of interest (1972)\" hide=\"- Addendum-5075-002: Melody Maker clipping (1972)\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n= ##7f0000|**'Violent incident at Porcelain Gang Bang show'**##\n\nStrange events haunted the popular venue \"The Canvey Club\" this Saturday evening.

Though they were dragged back by security, the attacker managed to strike the lead singer's leg, injuring his knee. The attacker proceeded to [PSYCHOTROPIC HAZARD REMOVED.] The attendees, though alive, remain in critical condition, and several police officers were killed in the fallout.
