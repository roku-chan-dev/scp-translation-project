Vocalizations recorded from SCP-4607 specimens during deep-sea surveillance are to be submitted for analysis.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4607 is a complex localized ecosystem of anomalous deep-sea organisms inhabiting the carcass of an adult gray whale (designated as SCP-4607-A), composed of hagfish, sleeper sharks, abyssal sea cucumbers, squat lobsters and bone-eating zombie worms. Calculations indicate that SCP-4607-A will reach the sulfophilic stage[[footnote]]The third stage of a whalefall ecosystem, where \"sulfophilic bacteria\" anaerobically break down the lipids embedded in the bones. Due to the toxicity of H,,2,,S, only resistant chemosynthetic bacteria survive.[[/footnote]] in eight years. \n\nSCP-4607 organisms have been observed to communicate with each other through emitting infrasonic vocalizations. Although these sounds are detectable by any standard equipment capable of recording audio, all communication attempts have failed since specimens in captivity have been unresponsive during testing.\n\nSCP-4607-A was discovered by a team of marine biologists led by Site-113 oceanographer and acoustic ecologist Imogen Casbolt in 1987. SCP-4607-A was identified using scanning sonar technology at 1,240-m in the Cascadia Basin, northern Pacific Ocean. On 02/09/1987, during a deep-sea robotic exploration, the first series of vocalizations from SCP-4607 organisms were incidentally recorded.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Open Video Log 4607-01\" hide=\"◀ Close\"]]\n> **Foreword:** This transcript follows the recorded conversation involving two hagfish specimens.

As expected, none of the captive SCP-4607 instances shown the same anomalous auditory properties as previously recorded. On 03/28/████, all captive SCP-4607 specimens attached with specialized underwater audio recorders were released on another whalefall on the Cascadia Basin. Research of SCP-4607 is ongoing.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4606]]] | SCP-4607 | [[[SCP-4608]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Kenoma]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** File:Whale fall.jpg\n> **Name:** whalefall.jpg\n> **Author:** NOAA's Undersea Research Program\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Whale_fall.jpg\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
