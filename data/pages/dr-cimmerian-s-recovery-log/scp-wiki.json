I cry for a little while and try not to vomit.\n\nThe problem started small. A few beers after work. I took a drink. Then another. I didn't know this feeling was possible, I was warm. I was happy.\n\nMidnight became dawn and I was still chasing it. Long since thrown out of whatever dive bar we'd haunted. I was in someone's house. With people I don't recognize in the mirror. We laughed. I had another drink.\n\nI drove to the site. I sleepwalked through my workday. Back to the start. I was there in the bathroom for a few minutes to get myself together. Time to go home.\n\nI carry everything with me. This time I don't bother going out with friends. My brain releases the same endorphins in the presence of my dining table as it does with people who might care about me. I forget. I wake up an hour after. I drink again.\n\nWarm. Happy.\n\nHours become months. People know I have a problem. I have to get it under control or else I'm useless to them. \n\nI'm useless to them anyway. That's why I have a problem.\n\nLater that night. I drink some more. It doesn't keep the voices out, but it does take the edge off. This is impossible to carry.\n\nI go to the sink. I pour out all the bottles. I can be good. For a few hours it's true. Then I see the empty bottles in the garbage can. I'm not drinking because I can't, not because I'm better.\n\nI go to bed. I cannot sleep. I cry for a little while and try not to vomit. Minutes become hours. I'm staring at the ceiling and feeling like I'm dying. This is torture. \n\nI've made a mistake. I know facts and figures about this. I just need to push through. The muscle shakes, the nausea, the pure distilled pain in my head. If I can just get to the other side I'll be alright.\n\nI won't go into work tomorrow. I'll call and say I'm sick. They'll accept the shared lie.\n\nShivering. Hurting. This is my own doing.\n\nOf course there's a bottle in the end table. Of course I failed to find them all when I was good. I'm not good anymore. I pull it out. There's no struggle. I drink it immediately. Before it even has time to hit my bloodstream I feel better. Never good. But better.\n\nI go outside and lay on the damp green grass. The deep black sky and cool night air suffuse my being. I am alone and wondrous and this feeling is beautiful. The stars twinkle in the night. I want to be here always. I drink again. And again.\n\nI wake up on my side. The light is blinding. People are yelling. A tube is down my throat. Concerned people are trying to look into my eyes.\n\nI want to skip this moment in time. They try to fix me. They save my body. They don't know where the rot is.\n\nThe next day I make a decision. No more. Everyone knows now. I can just live. I don't get out of the hospital for 2 weeks. I'm 14 days sober.\n\nI'm not alone at home. The Foundation sent someone to monitor me. To make sure I'm good. To turn 14 days into 15.\n\nA month later I'm back at work. Light duty for a while. \n\nDay 63 was not a particularly rough day. We had pizza and pasta for lunch. I laughed with my friends. The drive home was peaceful. Beautiful music on the radio. I go up to my apartment. I nod to my neighbor. The one that called the ambulance for me. She smiles back.\n\nI close the door and lock it. I go into the kitchen. I drink until I feel love again. I cry for a little while and try not to vomit. I pass out on the kitchen floor. I wake up in the morning.\n\nNo one comes to save me.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
