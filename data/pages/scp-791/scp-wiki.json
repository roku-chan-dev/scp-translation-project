Emergency drainage systems are to be maintained at all times, and must possess no fewer then eight filtration screens.\n\nSCP-791 is to be held in a wide-weave steel mesh bag, to allow for ease of location in a “Draining” event, and to pre-contain any biological events.  Removal from the bag may only be done under testing conditions. \n \n**Description:** SCP-791 appears to be a mass of liquid water held in a spherical shape by an unknown and undetectable force.  Biological tissues can pass through SCP-791 as they would through normal water, and reports indicate the water to be similar to normal sea water, but with a lower salt content.  It is impossible to “splash” SCP-791, however, water may be drawn out via the hands or mouth.\n\nSCP-791 reacts to non-biological materials, such as stone or metal, as if it were a sphere of solid concrete.  SCP-791 may be lifted, rolled, or otherwise manipulated in this way, but acquiring samples with non-biological materials is extremely difficult due to the extreme hardness and weight of SCP-791.  SCP-791 does not reduce in dimensions when water is drawn from it.  This is true even when withdrawing very high volumes of water.\n\nThe water of SCP-791 is sterile, and contains no microbes of any kind.  It is almost identical to earth water, but has a slightly elevated amount of hydrogen.  SCP-791 will randomly undergo “Draining” events, where massive amounts of water will pour from SCP-791.  SCP-791 retains its properties during these events, and “Draining” can last between several hours to four months.\n\nItems will sometimes exit SCP-791.  It is unknown where these items originate from, though most appear to be “oceanic” in origin.  Items resembling seaweed, fish, ████████, ██████, plankton, [DATA EXPUNGED] note possible awareness.\n\nThe ████████-like entities have occurred multiple times, and have [DATA EXPUNGED] unknown. Communication via █████ and similar alternate realities observed via [[[SCP-2684]]], [[[SCP-3374]]] or indirectly through [[[SCP-257]]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-790]]] | SCP-791 | [[[SCP-792]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
