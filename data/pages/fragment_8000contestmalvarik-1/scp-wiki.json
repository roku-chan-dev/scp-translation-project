If you somehow got here without an invite, scram. The site only goes online for a few minutes at any point during the day, so if you got in, either grab a clone of the site as fast as possible or find someone else that can.  \n\nRemember, this shit is **not** to be talked about with anyone outside our group unless its someone you're inviting(with everyone's permission). If the higher-ups catches wind of this, we're probably looking at suspensions at the very least. We all want to keep our jobs, so keep your mouth shut. When we're done with the site clone for the week, clear the drive.\n\nUpdate this page with your pick by 10 pm on Sunday, PST. Buy in is 110$, get in contact with Hackett in Site-99's Media Archive Wing for more about that. Prize money is distributed between the top three at the end of the week. \n\nThe site's point system is pretty easy to remember. +5 for each anomaly interacted with in the week, -10 per injury, +10 for every page of Paperwork, +5 for every hour. Remember, you can't pick yourself or anyone else in this group. If your pick dies, you're out for the week, sorry. Feel free to vent or brag below your entry. Just in case some busybody finds this site, we're posting under usernames.\n------\n[[=]]\n+* STAT SHEET: WEEK OF 01/05/2024\n[[/=]]\n------\n||~ Name ||~ Team ||~ Division ||~ Anomalies Studied ||~ Injuries Incurred ||~ Paperwork Filed ||~ Hours Spent With Anomalies  ||~ Status ||~ Total Points ||\n|| Dr. Jamie Barnes || Site-99 || Department of Extra-Dimensional Studies || SCP-4258, SCP-5028, SCP-6108 || 0 Injuries || Fifteen Pages || 16 Hours || Alive || 245 ||\n\n> Let's fucking go, Barnes!
