While the death was initially ruled a suicide, the victim's family have revealed information that may shine a new light on this case.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .75\"]]\nHansen was a 25-year-old employee at Scout's Cargo Packing, an interstate delivery service, and a promising young man. His life was cut short by an unknown party, however, as his brother found him dead in his apartment on the 25th of May. All five digits on his left hand were missing, with their locations remaining unidentified, with no other damage or signs of struggle found on his body. The cause of death was ruled to be blood loss, and the injuries were deemed to be self-inflicted.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .5\"]]\nOf suspicion, however, is the fact that drawings of a five-armed star, similar to the satanic pentagram, were found in multiple locations of the victim's house. Some were drawn using the victim's blood, some using a pink, pastel paint. A questionnaire belonging to an alleged self-help association, calling itself the \"Society of Outer Light\" was also found. No information could be found about the group, but the family suspects ties to the occult.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .25\"]]\nCould this be a work of satanic cults, with Hansen serving as human sacrifice?
