A radius of 1.5 km has been established as an exclusionary zone around the area, and a 3-meter-tall fence lines the circumference. Security personnel are to patrol the perimeter on a bi-hourly basis, with cameras constantly surveying the surrounding area.\n SCP-8423 is to be contained within a 5m x 5m x 5m steel cube, with 2.5 meters above and below ground level. The containment chamber is to be fitted with a six (6) door air lock system, with incineration capabilities in each of the six (6) individual chambers. Should any single airlock fail at any point, the chambers shall undergo decontamination as described in document 8423- F-31c:\n\n* All airlocks will initiate incineration sequence for a period of thirty (30) minutes, regardless of personnel located within.\n* Airlocks will be flooded with Hydrogen Peroxide, which will sit for a period of no less than twenty-four (24) hours before draining.\n* Airlocks will be flooded with boiling salt water for no less than twelve (12) hours before draining.\n* Airlocks are flushed with boiling, soapy water.\n* Hazmat teams will enter airlocks and decide whether decontamination is sufficient. Regardless of decontamination status, hazmat teams are to incinerate all clothes worn into airlocks after exiting.\n* This process will be repeated at least two (2) times, with further decontamination at the discretion of area staff.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name= http://scp-sandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/wiki:scp-8422/8423-Map.png\n|caption= Area-87 Layout\n|width=300px \n]]\n\nAny personnel who enter SCP-8423’s containment chamber are required to wear IDLH certified self-contained air supply SCBA respirators and level A hazard totally-encapsulating hazmat suits. Personnel returning from interaction with SCP-8423 must quarantine for two weeks in a room with a monitoring camera, closed airflow system and incineration capabilities. If any personnel are suspected of disregarding any one of these directives they are to be terminated immediately by incineration.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8423 is a fungus similar in appearance to //Psilocybin Semilanceata//[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as Magic Mushrooms[[/footnote]]. SCP-8423 growths average around 3.0 cm in diameter; growths have been recorded to grow up to 3.4 cm. Growths are notable for their conical bell-shaped cap with a small white spot on the peak. The colour of the growth ranges from brown to a rust-like colour. The stipes appear long and slender, some recording up to 10 cm in height, however, most range from 5-7 cm on average. Stipes range from dirty white to light brown. The lamella [[footnote]]The 'gill'[[/footnote]] to stipe is adnexed [[footnote]]Narrowly attached[[/footnote]], with the lamella changing from white to black as they mature. Spores are completely transparent. Foundation mycologists estimate the spores to be roughly 10.5-11.5 x 6.5-7.0 micrometers and ellipsoid in shape. SCP-8423 exhibits saprotrophic ecology and can grow without access to sunlight.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name= http://scp-sandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/wiki:scp-8422/mushroom.jpg\n|caption= //Psilocybin Semilanceata//. Images of SCP-8423 are classified under protocol GT-83d.\n|width=300px \n]]\n\n\nSCP-8423 demonstrates high resistance to extreme cold and heat, with research indicating it is capable of withstanding temperatures as low as -██˚C and as high as ██˚C.\n\nSCP-8423 is not biologically related to any other documented fungi, and is theorized to be native to █████ ████. Growths spread through the use of airborne spores. Infection by SCP-8423 occurs when a subject, referred to as SCP-8423-1, inhales spores emitted by SCP-8423 or SCP-8423-1 instances. SCP-8423 spores then enter the brain, where they begin to grow and feed implanted in the brain cavity. Infection from SCP-8423 occurs in seven (7) identifiable stages:\n\n# Subject inhales spores of SCP-8423.\n# Spores enter the subject's brain cavity, latching on. Subject is now considered SCP-8423-1.\n# Subject will begin to feel smarter, stronger and clear-headed for a period of 1-3 months. Notably, patients with dementia and Alzheimer's report being completely cured of all affliction. Cognitive scans confirm that Alzheimer's and dementia symptoms cease.\n# Subjects begin to become obsessive with the preservation and spread of SCP-8423.\n# Subjects will begin to exhibit [REDACTED].\n# Subjects will root into the ground and emit SCP-8423 spores into the air, with a range of up to █ kilometers.\n# [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\nIn total, the lifecycle for SCP-8423-1 instances is roughly 6 months. SCP-8423 first came to Foundation attention when reports coming out of the [REDACTED] province began reporting [REDACTED] on local wildlife, and increasingly aggressive territorial behaviour from the affected.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE FOLLOWING FILE IS LEVEL 4/8423 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THIS FILE WITHOUT LEVEL 4/8423 AUTHORIZATION WILL BE LOGGED AND WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size 150%]][[collapsible show=\"- Enter valid 4/8423 credentials -\" hide=\"Credentials validated - Welcome, Dr. Martin\"]][[/size]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+Operation Closed Canal\n| hide=-Hide Document\n]]\n> **Supervisors Note**\n> Below are a transcription of the video logs from the late Dr. Edward Zhang during his initial research into SCP-8423.

Dr. Zhang removes a sheet of paper from the folder and begins to read it.//\n\n**Zhang:** Yes, that's right. Okay. Foundation operatives had begun receiving reports of wildlife exhibiting anomalous behavior, namely that most local wildlife has begun exhibiting signs of, quote unquote, 'large fungal growths and increasingly aggressive and territorial behaviours, so much so that local townsfolk cannot enter the surrounding rainforest without risk of assault by wildlife.' And we're here to see if this stuff is anomalous, or, you know, just fungus.\n\n**Dr. Abarca:** Yeah, and to add to that, Edward, the main thing we're here to do is to see if whatever this is can affect humans. So far, only signs of animal infection are present.\n\n**Zhang:** Right. We'll be interviewing the local population, as well as taking blood samples, and, if needed, body scans. We are to operate under the guise that we're medical staff from the [REDACTED] government sent as a temporary hospital set up. We're way out in the fucking sticks here, so if any of these country bumpkins suspect anything I'd be shocked. Anyhow, there's plenty of work to be done here.

Now, as I was saying, your granddaughter tells us you previously were suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease until about three months ago. Is that correct?\n\n**S:** Oh, yes dear, yes. Truly awful thing, but then one day not three months ago, I woke up and poof! Gone! I could walk, talk, think and felt like I was 30 years younger. God truly is good.\n\n**Z:** Interesting. Now, could you tell us what happened before this seeming miracle happened? Anything out of the ordinary in the days leading up?\n\n**S:** Oh, nothing, nothing. I just went on my walks as usual, and had tea with █████ as per usual.\n\n**Z:** Where did you take these walks?\n\n**S:** Just out in the forest, on the path. Found some interesting little mushrooms out there, I did. Never seen the likes of them out there before. But, can't go in the forest no more because of the animals going crazy. Let me tell you.....\n\n//The subject proceeded to go on a fifteen minute rant about how the younger generations are screwing everything up and are too soft. Attempts at cutting the subject off were unsuccessful. After the interview, Agents Hellebuyck and Rodriguez were sent into the rainforest to collect samples of fungus. During this time, they would also recover a half-eaten bird, which displayed symptoms of infection from SCP-8423.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Days 4-8\n| hide=- June 09 - June 13\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Video Log 04 Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 13/06/2022\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8423\n\n**Team Lead:** Dr. Edward Zhang\n\n**Team Members:** Dr. Manuel Abarca, Agent Jarron Hellebuyck, Agent Lupita Rodriguez\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Dr. Zhang can be seen taking a seat at a desk. He pulls a file folder out of a drawer. Dr. Abarca enters frame, sitting next to him.//\n\n**Dr. Zhang:** Lots of new developments since the log was last updated. The samples Jarron and Lupita collected were interesting, to say the least. The samples we collected we initially thought were Psilocybin Semilanceata-\n\n**Dr. Abarca:** You mean shrooms.\n\n//Both researchers laugh briefly.//\n\n**Z:** Sure, whatever hippie shit you want to call them. Shrooms, magic mushrooms, whatever. Anyway, the point is they were not Psilocybin Semilanceata, testing shows they're a whole new thing. We checked the data against the foundation database, and these little shits aren't related to any other fungi that anyone has found. Hell, they're not related to any plants either. They don't appear to produce spores, either - not that I've seen at least, unless they're transparent, which I'm not ruling out. Now Manuel will report on the human and animal side of things.\n\n**A:** Right. Well, after running blood samples and the like, we've determined that this fungus can infect humans. We tested the samples of the fungi against samples of the blood we collected, and oh boy, is it ever there. We've been wearing respirators since, which we hope is enough. As for that bird that Hellebuyck and Rodriguez found, what a scare. The things organs, brain, basically the entire body was covered in fungus. The thing was more fungus than animal. Anyway, we've been running brain scans on patients, and this thing is impressive. On average, this thing is increasing cognition rates by [REDACTED] percent. We also scanned the old woman's brain, Mrs.... well, I forget now, but the old woman who had Alzheimer's. No signs of it at all. The most worrying part is... well, Edward, you can say if you'd like.\n\n**Z:** Sure. This thing is in people's brain. Scans are showing that the fungus plants itself into the brain and slowly spreads. People at around the three month mark have around ninety percent of their brain covered in the fungus. These patients who are further along also have begun showing fungal growths themselves, usually in the damper and darker areas of the body - think the armpits and groin area - however some people demonstrate growths around the face, particularly the eyes, ears, nose and mouth. For an unknow reason, no one in the town seem to point this out, or notice at all. Our current theory is those infected simply ignore the fact that the growths are happening - which would mean this entire damn town is infected. I've sent reports off to site command to close down this whole area if possible. If this thing spreads out of here, I don't know what we'll be able to do. But, we'll keep at work.

The work of the late Drs. Zhang & Abarca were invaluable to the containment of SCP-8423. The method in which Operation Closed Canal was concluded however is under no circumstances to be released to any personnel barring the O5 council. All that staff need to know is Operation Closed Canal resulted in the termination of all Foundation and civilian life. Any family or friend relations with townsfolk were given amnestics. The town and the people who lived there never existed. Discussion on this topic will be punishable by suspension. I will hear no more on the matter.//\n> //- Dr. Martin, Area-87 Senior Supervisor//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8422 |SCP-8422]]] | SCP-8423 | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8424 |SCP-8424]]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** mushroom.jpg\n> **Author:** Alan Rockefeller\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Psilocybe.semilanceata.Alan.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** 8423-Map.png\n> **Author:** DocMart\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-sandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/wiki:scp-8422/8423-Map.png\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
