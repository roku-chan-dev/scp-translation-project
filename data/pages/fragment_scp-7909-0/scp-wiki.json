Free will does not exist. ||\n|| Universes are said to be [[span class=\"bt\"]]pataphysically linked[[/span]] if one is represented in the other as a fictional narrative or scenario conceived of by a sapient entity. These universes are arranged along a specific pataphysical dimension. When an individual conceives of a non-real scenario, an information packet representing that scenario emanates out of their universe and travels downwards in the pataphysical dimension before attaching itself to a nascent universe with low information content, bringing about the imagined scenario in that universe. ||\n||~ ||\n|| A [[span class=\"bt\"]]nullspace void[[/span]] is a space in reality that measures 0-0-0 daumals, meaning it possesses no physical, causal or narrative potential.

When this effect ends, all species suddenly become highly likely to enter one or more large narratives with multiple subnarrative layers. This increases this reality's narrative potential to higher than average for 2 weeks. This is caused by heavy pataphysical transmissions from sapient beings in a relatively higher universe.\n\nAs time goes on, more individuals will gain knowledge and engage in discussions about SCP-7909, especially if they've experienced its effects multiple times. Due to the range of SCP-7909 events, it is expected that the Foundation will have to enact ENNUI protocol or a similar global amnestization procedure ultimately to lessen the scope of civilian knowledge about the anomaly.\n\nThe cause, or the purpose, of SCP-7909, is unknown. \n\nThe following is a timed list of the occurrences of an SCP-7909 event:\n\n[[div class=\"table2\"]]\n||~ Theorized Time (In seconds) ||~ Actions ||\n||= **[[span class=\"bt\"]]0.1-0.3[[/span]]** || All entities in reality either become blind or lose sight completely.
