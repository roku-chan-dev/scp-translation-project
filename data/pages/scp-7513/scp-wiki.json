Access to SCP-7513 is restricted to humans with Level 4 access or above.\n\nSite-13 is not to be used for any mission involving extraterrestrials. Staff at Site-13 are to be vetted for any extraterrestrial DNA, while staff working with SCP-7513 are to be intensely monitored for any sign of extraterrestrial influence via monthly check-ins and daily self-testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7513 is Forrest O‚ÄôSullivan, a 25-year-old male of Irish-American descent.\n\nSCP-7513 has an anomalously high encounter rate with sapient extraterrestrial entities, with most reported encounters ending with zero casualties, and the species that said extraterrestrial entity originates from having an amicable relationship with humans from that point on.\n\nInteractions between extraterrestrials and SCP-7513 are almost always sexual, with entities offering SCP-7513 to partake in customary courting rituals or to engage in casual sexual activity. When encountering species that are asexual, or have no intention of copulating with SCP-7513, the actions and words of said entities are usually interpreted as flirtatious by SCP-7513.\n\nBefore containment, SCP-7513 was involved in 13% of incidents regarding Foundation encounters with extraterrestrial species in the past 20 years, the earliest of which being in 2003. Of these incidents that SCP-7513 was involved in, 51% of them have ended with a diplomatic relationship being established between the Foundation and said extraterrestrial species. The other 49% resulted in no further activity being reported from these extraterrestrial species.\n\nSCP-7513 was discovered on August 5th, 2021 during Incident 7513-1. SCP-7513 was one of the individuals interrogated for the incident, and upon the investigation of its Tinder account, it was discovered that 75% of all the accounts it had matched with were accounts flagged by Foundation webcrawlers as belonging to undercover extraterrestrials (henceforth referred to as UEs). An investigation into its other social media accounts revealed that:\n\n* 59% of all of SCP-7513‚Äôs Twitter followers were accounts belonging to UEs.\n* 77% of Facebook groups that SCP-7513 had joined were being run entirely by UEs, sometimes with SCP-7513 being the only human in said groups.\n* 95% of SCP-7513‚Äôs Instagram followers were accounts belonging to UEs, with 100% of comments found under posts made by SCP-7513 belonging to said accounts.\n\nFollowing this investigation, as well as the discovery of his involvement in prior Foundation incidents, SCP-7513 was informed of its anomalous properties and willingly entered containment.\n\n**Addendum 7513.1:** Online profiles.\n\nThe following is a collection of profiles utilized by accounts belonging to SCP-7513.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Twitter Profile:**\nForrest, 25, he/him, bisexual, BLM, trans ally.

Fortunately, SCP-7513 was recording the incident on its phone, the transcription can be read below.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//<Camera feed starts, it is a closeup of SCP-7513‚Äôs face>//\n\n**SCP-7513:** Okay, I‚Äôm recording.

The embedded Foundation agents take out their firearms and fire at the entity. Several civilians take out weapons and attempt to take it down>//\n\n**SCP-7513:** JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!\n\n//<POI-481 flies at SCP-7513, picking it up and flying into the air.

The footage ends abruptly>//\n\n//[END LOG]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nPOI-481 entered the ship and disappeared with the rest of its species. Its whereabouts are currently unknown. No casualties were reported.
