The containment chamber housing SCP-4260 has been augmented with a Strayer Density Matrix designed to coalesce and bind its disparate elements.\n\nMaintenance of the Strayer Density Matrix is integral to SCP-4260's containment and requires a specialized team of technicians and speculative essophysicists[[footnote]] A science devoted to the study of entities which exert an effect on reality by existing. [[/footnote]]. MTF Gamma-8 (\"Baphomites\") has been assembled for this expressed purpose and will perform any necessary repairs to the Matrix and operate it during Procedure 8917[[footnote]] Archive Index: \"Termination of Primary Asset SCP-4260\" [[/footnote]].\n\nProcedure 8917 requires a joint operation between three mobile task forces, assembled to ensure its effective completion. The assigned task forces, denoted collectively as Amalgamate Force Omicron-45, and their functions are as follows:\n\n* **MTF Gamma-8 (\"Baphomites\"):** Assembled from technicians proficient in the operation of Strayer Density Matrices and speculative essophysicists from RTF Iota-39 (\"Gods and Monsters\") who will assist in their direction.\n* **MTF Xi-2 (\"Out of the Shadows Come We, Darkly\"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in combat with essophysical, deity-class entities. MTF Xi-2 will engage SCP-4260 and terminate it, ending the initial stage of Procedure 8917.\n* **MTF Tau-900 (\"Deliverance\"):** An armed Mobile Task Force specializing in the location of civilians accidentally affected by a successful neutralization of SCP-4260. MTF Tau-900 will then terminate all targets and remove evidence of the procedure's efficacy.\n\nProcedure 8917 is considered complete when the following criteria are met.\n\n> # SCP-4260 has been successfully terminated.\n> # The Strayer Density Matrix is fully operational.\n> # All affected civilians have been located and terminated.\n> # All evidence of Procedure 8917 has been removed.\n> # SCP-4260 has been resurrected.\n\nThe document detailing SCP-4260 uploaded to the Foundation intranet is to contain numerous omissions, in order to obfuscate the identity of SCP-4260.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4260 refers to the consciousness of an essophysical entity which has permeated itself through the known universe. The effect of SCP-4260's existence has been well documented by almost every sapient culture. Termination of SCP-4260 has resulted in the neutralization of its primary anomalous effect until its resurrection during Procedure 8917.\n\n**Addendum.4260.1:** Activations of Procedure 8917\n\n||~ Date ||~ Termination Method ||~ Procedure Causation ||~ Duration of Effect ||~ Affected ||~ Status ||\n|| ████, 1999 || Fatal puncture wounds and blood loss, administered by MTF Xi-2. || A massive containment failure at [[[SCP-579 | Site-62C]]]. || 110 seconds || 3 civilians || Recontained[[footnote]] Reanimated by [[[SCP-3914 | SCP-3914-1]]] in exchange for lifting of economic sanctions against Amazon, Inc.
