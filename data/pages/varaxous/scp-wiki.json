Originally, it was more or less just 'the self-inserting character is revealed to be the reader using a list users module.' Eventually, I realized (with the help of some people :P) that while the list users module was bad, the other parts of the idea. So I started drafting it, took about a month, when the SCP-910 slot was put under the deletion vote. Rushing to complete the article, I got the interview and incident log done before waiting for the slot to be deleted. Sadly, I didn't get the slot, but I eventually decided to post. I've made a few changes to it as well.\n> On Sam Micheals: Sam Micheals was originally made from a typo of sammich in #site19 with [[*user MaliceAforethought]]. Thus, he became an interdimensional sammich thief in that immediate moment. Not to say he wasn't one before hand. I would look out for some things with him in the future.\n> [[/collapsible]]\n> \n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-1654\"]]\n> [**{{[[[SCP-1654]]]}}**] - [**N/A**] - **Tuned to a Dead Channel**\n> {{[%%created_at%%] [##green|+%%rating%%##] [Comments: %%comments%%] [Last Comment: %%commented_at%%]}}\n> [[collapsible show=\"Show Author Commentary\" hide=\"Hide Commentary\"]]\n> This was written in an hour.

Not the most original, but it was mine. Fast forward about 3 months (My writing takes awhile ok), [[*user Darkstuff]] was dumping ideas in a side channel, when he started talking about a moving production that forced the residents to participate in the production. It was a match made in heaven.\n> \n> Working with [[*user Darkstuff]] was awesome, one of my favorite experiences on this entire site.

I remember being very intrigued in the object I chose, as to me, it was the perfect example of an Anomalous Object. It told a story in a single sentence, which could be interpreted in a vast number of ways.
