The //Chugat Zar//. The //Book of the Year//. One of only nine Daevite texts in Foundation hands, smuggled out of China when the Revolution came.\n\nThe researchers move it beneath the mounted camera; Santana unrolls the forward end. Love rolls up the trailing. Notovich clicks the button.\n\nRoll roll click\n\nColumn by column, row by row, hour upon hour. \n\nRoll roll click\n\nTheir role is not to understand, merely to catalog. \n\nWhen the microfilms are developed, they are handed off to the linguists. Hunched over their desks in office 515, Barnes, Singh, and Altman continue their patient progress on the decades-long task. \n\nThey copy out the endless rows of symbols by hand, compare them to the catalog of glyphs, narrow down potential meanings, mark out uncertainties, pick out patterns. Notebooks fill with shorthand. Reams of paper are fed into the typewriters. Meaning hangs in the balance of an ancient scribe’s handwriting.\n\nThe language of that dead empire has resisted them at every step, as if out of spite or pride it refuses to be sullied by the lesser men of a lesser age. It will not give up its secrets until it has fought to the last breath.\n\nThere had been an entire [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1726 library] in the Foundation’s grasp when the translation efforts had begun, but that was forty years ago and more. Now there were just these nine books, the fragmentary account from a Persian general in the time of Xerxes 1, a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076 tomb] and its barrow-goods, a broken victory stele, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140 Chronicle], and one surviving L2 speaker.\n\nAltman takes the elevator down to the containment levels, a half-translated passage in his briefcase. He passes through three security checkpoints and is whisked along by the guards  to a remote observation chamber. He sits down, his hindbrain reminding him that the two men behind him are under orders to blow his brains out if he shows any signs of being compromised.\n\nHe switches on the camera and the microphone\n\nAsset ABLE is in a good mood today, grading on a curve. He sits cross-legged on his bed, braiding his beard with the aid of a mirror bolted to the wall. A puppy sleeps soundly in his lap. Altman greets him with the appropriate level of deference for a military superior, and then briskly runs through a series of pre-vetted questions regarding this particular text. Asset ABLE doesn’t bother to interrupt his personal grooming or look into the camera. Questions go ignored, or are answered only with a grunt or the occasional gravelly laconism.\n\nCigarette stubs pile up in the ash tray. \n\nThe current status of the game of telephone, forty-some years on: \n* Orthographic fossilization, phonologic drift, and an extremely conservative literati resulted in two languages where words with no similarity in pronunciation are spelled identically.\n* The Foundation has a sizable corpus of High Daevite text, less than a thousand defined words, and only hypothetical reconstructions of the original pronunciation.\n* Asset ABLE speaks Vulgar Daevite accented by an unknown mother tongue and only a little High Daevite.\n* Altman and his team use an English-Daevite pidgin for these interviews, but it is poorly suited for complex ideas.\n* Asset ABLE is wholly disinterested in learning more English or teaching more Daevite than the absolute necessities.\n\nFor historical linguists, this situation and all its frustrations is still a triple-seven jackpot, the equivalent of finding a contemporary of Cicero who knew even a few words in Proto-Indo-European. But the magic bullet is jammed in the chamber:\n\nAsset ABLE is completely illiterate.\n\nUnable to simply show him the glyphs and ask for their Vulgar pronunciation and definition, Altman and his team are stuck taking shots in the dark and hoping that their reconstructions  are close enough for ABLE to recognize them. Anything he provides in response is fed back into the long list of sound changes. Eventually, they will have enough to reverse-engineer a functioning lexicon, but ‘eventually’ remains stalled years in the future instead of the months they had hoped for. \n\nThe puppy yawns and lifts her head, signaling the end of the session. Deaf to Altman’s inquiry of //*tew.s₁aq₃// vs. //*tsəʊ.zaq₂//, Asset ABLE scratches her ears and says something the microphone can’t pick up. They won’t get anything more from him today; the research team’s gift to encourage cooperation has instead given Asset ABLE an evergreen excuse to brush them off. Where he holds humanity in mixed apathy or disdain, little Chunuki is spoiled like a princess.\n\nAltman thanks Asset ABLE for his assistance and packs up his things. He has three words he can conclusively identify, six more that can be pencilled in, and two more symbols that can be assigned sounds. A productive meeting, compared to how these interviews usually go. Maybe in five years, maybe in ten, they’ll have the breakthrough that makes it all click. There’s no rush; Dead languages rarely go anywhere.\n\nBut languages don’t really die. Their speakers die, as all men must, but when the last speaker is laid in the ground their language does not go with them. It lingers at the grave, sleeping with one eye open. Waiting for the day when it is stirred from its vigil and spoken once again.\n\n> The High Daevite alphasyllabary consists of eight hundred and fifty-six glyphs, with an additional three and a half thousand logographs used for proper nouns or common root words. The script is modeled on that used by the Himalayan STS-Γ[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]//Megapithicus pattersoni sapiens//; The Sapient Terrestrial Species designation is used specifically for metacognitive organisms native to baseline Earth.[[/span]] culture group, despite the Empire’s propaganda to the contrary. It was not reformed at any point after its adoption, and this fossilization eventually lead to an orthography that bore no resemblance to how the words were spoken in day-to-day speech[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]High Daevite had a sizable taboo register, where set euphemistic terms or phrases were used to allude to topics considered unworthy of direct inclusion. The phrase “//haddagh ya shen khoe//” (“[the beast] snorts and eats its shit”) is one of the most common in the corpus, used to replace the speech of those considered both sub-human and ritually unclean.[[/span]]. Added complexity came from from the methods of writing those symbols; most of the alphasyllabary glyphs had multiple positional variants, and even in the Late Imperial period texts were written in boustrophedon without spaces with syllable glyphs used as punctuation. \n>\n> This extreme divergence reinforced already extremely low literacy standards of the Empire, eventually leading to the Late Imperial legal code explicating punishments of low-caste individuals for both possession and comprehension of written text beyond the list of approved logographs.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/4| Previous]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/6| Next]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
