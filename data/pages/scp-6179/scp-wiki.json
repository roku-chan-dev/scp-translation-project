SCP-6179 has a number of signs of advanced arthritis, including a reduced range of motion, swelling, and hand muscles seized in a manner that indicates cramping. SCP-6179 lacks fingerprints on the middle finger and ring finger. \n\n**Addendum-6179-1:** Testing revealed the fingerprint present on the index finger matched that of Senior Researcher McConnell's left index finger as held in the Foundation database.[[footnote]]McConnell lost this finger in an accident at 25.[[/footnote]] Investigations to determine any matches for the pinky finger and thumb, which do not match McConnell's, are ongoing.\n\n**Addendum-6179-2:** Following proposals for further analysis, a full autopsy was conducted on the cadaver of Senior Researcher McConnell. Autopsy results include a bruising pattern on the heart matching that of SCP-6179.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6178]]] | SCP-6179 | [[[SCP-6180]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
