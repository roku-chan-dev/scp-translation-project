Foundation agents successfully purchased a number of items from these branches, and their assorted anomalous properties were later confirmed. They included:\n\n* A batch of pens whose ink spontaneously changed colour approximately once per minute;\n* A batch of pencils which could write effectively despite containing elemental lead instead of graphite;\n* A block of sticky notes which, if any numeric date was written on them in YYYY-MM-DD format, would immediately lose their adhesive properties once said date had passed;\n* An item which periodically alternated between being a stack of blank paper, a whiteboard, an empty CD, and various other media of communication (later designated SCP-6625-1).\n\nShortly after these discoveries, Site-128 was established for the purposes of monitoring GoI-6625 (alongside other low-level GoI activity in the area), as well as conducting research on the anomalous items procured from it. The Site's efforts in these areas are ongoing.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote s128\"]]\nSite-128 is now fully operational, and we've made a lot of progress on studying the items we've got. Unfortunately, trying to shut this GoI down has been less successful; they seem to open a new branch every month or so, but whenever we send a team to raid one, they've completely shuttered the place by the time we get there.\n\nOccasionally they're kind enough to leave us a note. This one, for instance, was taped to the front door of the shop we tried last week:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote table2\"]]\nTo our loyal customer(s),\n\nThank you for shopping with us!
