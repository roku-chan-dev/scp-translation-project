Between the person-hour cost, and the audit revealing that we are contributing around $900 Billion exclusively for the care of a single animal, it is the committee decision of the Supervisors that care be significantly reduced, and eventually stopped for Messier 1, NGC 1952, Taurus A.\n\nWhen we first started this project, humanity had no context for the stars. We were like blind babes, wandering around in the darkness. Just because Messier 1, NGC 1952, Taurus A was one of the first major animal lifeforms we found with a completely exoterrestrial origin, does not provide enough rationale to continue such expensive care.\n\nEventually, Corey will die. We need to refocus our efforts onto species where we can actually affect their quality of life; Messier 1, NGC 1952, Taurus A is just too big of an undertaking for us to handle.\n\nTo the staff who are passionate about Corey; we are sorry, but there are bigger issues we need to address. Space is a big place. We will make sure that you find meaningful work, no matter where you are.\n\nFrom today on, we will begin the process of removing containment and care from Messier 1, NGC 1952, Taurus A.

From a young age, she worked with her father at Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, an organization dedicated to finding and rescuing animals in need across the Earth. Now, at 66 years old, Faeowynn has turned her attention to the stars.\n[[/div]]\n\n\"You know, I never thought that I would still be doing this at my age. But I guess you never grow out of loving animals. I know my father didn't.\"\n\nGrowing up in Boring, Oregon, life was anything but for a young Faeowynn, being exposed to the incredible animals from a young age. Her father, Tim Wilson, founded Wilson's Wildlife Solutions to help deal with the massive concentration of anomalous animals found in the area, while ensuring that they had the best lives possible. She has carried those ideals to the future, even adapting, as we all did, to leaving the Earth.\n\n\"I didn't know what to think when I heard we we all going to leave the planet. I saw all the plans for humanity's survival, but I didn't see one for all of the anomalous fauna we cared for. Our critters needed a way off of this planet too.\"\n\nSo Faeowynn Wilson got to work. She began gathering support for the Wilson's Wildlife ARK Project, an attempt to rescue as many anomalous animals as possible.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"magContent\"]]\n\nWhile the support was massive, the funds were not.\n\n\"It was a tough sell, asking for help saving the animals when people were worried about their own futures. We managed though. The ARK isn't pretty, but it does it's job.\"\n\nThe ARK, of course, is the Titania-Class carrier ship created for WWS in partnership with **MANUFACTURER**. This ship, ARK-1, contains all of the surviving critters that had been under the protection of WWS, as well as the majority of the staff. It exists as a living zoo, trying to simulate their environs as well as they possibly can.\n\nWe asked Faeowynn if she had a favorite critter from all of her years.\n\n\"A favorite? I truly do love them all. However, there was one critter that I wished we could have helped more.\"\n\nThat critter, funnily enough, was in space, far out of reach.\n\n\"We first discovered Corey thanks to Ol' Blue. At first all we got from him was static over our radios - but then we noticed the Blue was talking back to something. We did some digging and figured out that Corey was somehow speaking to Ol' Blue on a 52hz signal - once we realized that, we were able to locate Corey and identify that he was a giant animal, just looking for a friend.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color:white;background:#13433e;border-top:3px solid #ccc;border-left:3px solid #ccc;border-right:3px solid #ccc;border-radius:10px 10px 0px 0px;padding:15px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**Proposal for Specialized Care Team for Corey**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:white;border:3px solid #ccc;background:#26867C;padding:1em;\"]]\nWe are finally in a place where I can write this proposal; for years I have dreamed of being able to care for Corey, but he's just been out of our reach. Impossible to even get near him, forced to hear his calls for companionship year after year.\n\nToday, I would like to change that.\n\nWe have already demonstrated that we have the technology and capability to create anomalous animal care facilities for space travel, such as the WWS-ARK. I propose that we create a second, exploratory spacecraft, WWS-ARK-2. This spacecraft would not be focused on the mass care for multiple life forms, but would instead act as a method of transporting research teams to larger animals that we wouldn't be able to fit in a ship.\n\nIf we start working on WWS-ARK-2 now, we can launch it by 2045. Assuming nothing changes from the proposed design, the ship would arrive around 2445 - we have collected a team of individuals who are willing to enter cryo-sleep and abandon their lives as they know it in search of knowledge. To meet Corey.\n\nThese would be their mission goals:\n\n# Meet Corey and try to establish communication\n# Identify ways to support Corey\n# Learn\n\nWith normalcy gone, our next best goal is discovery. Corey has so much to teach us, if we can just get to him.\n\nFaeowynn Wilson\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"text-align:center;font-size:130%;margin-top:150px;margin-bottom:150px;\"]]\n\nARK-2 was approved, with a crew of 5 members being sent into cryo-sleep until they would reach Corey some 400 years later.\n\nIn the time since ARK-2 had launched, humanity's control over space travel accelerated beyond previous estimates. Care was established for Messier 1, NGC 1952, Taurus A, with billions of individuals involved in the research, in approximately 2230, well over 200 years before ARK-2 would arrive.\n\nIn 2350, The Supervisors made the decision to cease care for Corey, citing a predicted proximal end of life and extraneous costs.\n\nNearly 100 years later, by the time ARK-2 finally arrived at their destination, all that remained of containment were scraps and abandoned structures. Corey, however, was thriving.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]] __ARK-2 Main Terminal__[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n++++ ** Active Crew Member Status:**\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"overflow: auto;\"]]\n|| CREW || PRONOUNS || POSITION || STATUS ||\n|| Lauren Stone || she/her ||Lead Researcher/Captain|| Healthy ||\n|| Bear 'The Duke' Ellington || he/him ||Pilot/Mechanic|| Healthy ||\n|| Perri Khan || they/them ||Macrobiologist|| Healthy ||\n|| Sarah Wilson || she/her ||Anomalous Veterinarian|| Healthy ||\n|| Bradleigh Cooke || he/him ||Exoterrestrial Linguistics Specialist|| Healthy ||\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Captain's Log - Day 0\n[[/=]]\n------\nWell, we're finally here.

We were a little passion project of Fae's that barely got off the ground, it's no wonder they didn't care what happened to us.\n\nWe finally got things sorted out, and that was when they informed me that care for Corey had already began, ran for over a century, and then was suspended by the Supervisors. All while we were asleep in our ship, waiting to arrive for our mission. ARK-1 instructed us to await further orders, while they scrambled and tried to figure out what to do with us.\n\nWe came here for Corey - we were all excited to be able to be part of this mission. We sacrificed our lives at home, leaving behind the places and people we knew, all to travel across the universe and get here.

In the worst cases, sometimes trying to help the animal ends up hurting them more.\"\n[[/div]]\nI asked if Faeowynn had any examples - she brought up the case of an anomalous fish, Slipper, that they had tried to care for.\n\n\"Slipper just kept trying to jump out of the water - we didn't want it to get into the open air, so we added more and more layers of security to make sure that the fish couldn't get out while we weren't here. As time went on, Slipper grew lethargic, getting sicker and sicker. When we had to transfer Slipper to our treatment tanks, there was a brief period of time when he was out of the water. To our shock, he improved immediately. We didn't realize that the animal needed to be able to leave the water for periods of time; that's what I mean about us hurting the animals by mistake.\"\n\nThat struck me, dear reader, as the biggest challenge that Wilson's Wildlife Solutions faces on a daily basis. A doctor can talk to their patient. An anthropologist can talk to the people they're studying. Wilson's Wildlife can't talk to animals; the best cases are when they are able to figure out a way to open communication.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"magContent\"]]\n\"Some of our greatest success stories come from figuring out how to communicate. Think about it like a non-anomalous dog. While they can't speak to you, you can learn from their body language what they are feeling, observe their reactions to understand their mental and emotional state, and notice behavioral shifts that may indicate something deeper.\n\nWhen you're talking about an animal like Corey, who is not only completely alien to us, but is unlike any critter that we've ever encountered, things get a lot more complicated. Not only do you need to figure out a way to communicate with them, you also need to start from scratch. Dogs have had millennia around humans, and we still only partially understand them. An animal from a foreign world can be the biggest challenge. So it just goes, bit by bit, until you figure out positive and negative reactions, and hope that you're correct.\"\n\nI asked Faeowynn what happens if you can't figure out how to speak the same language.\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n\"We do our best then.

Perri, where are we on the macrosystem simulations?\n\n**Perri Khan:** I just finished the latest set today. And I don't know an easy way to say this, but... I think that the care provided during our extended nap ended up hurting Corey more than it helped.\n\n**Sarah Wilson:** I saw that on the analysis, they almost caused Corey to collapse! How dare they harm such a beautiful creature, using MY name? My Grandmother's name? When we finally ge-\n\n**Lauren Stone:** Sarah, I know you're upset about this. But ARK-1 is hundreds of years away, and any Wilson family members that are left have forgotten the core ideals. Except for you, that is. As far as I'm concerned, ARK-2 is the new Wilson's Wildlife Sanctuary, and we are the founding members. Remember what we all came here for, why we joined the mission. All we can do right now is give Corey the best care we are able.\n\n//The crew looks at Stone, all nodding in assent.//\n\n**Lauren Stone:** We're all relying on each other now, but I know we can do this. Perri, do you have a theory as to what happened to Corey to cause those numbers?\n\n**Perri Khan:** I need to run some more modelling to confirm it, but I think the biggest issue was the Star Mammoth Division. I compared the data on the parasites, and a major part of the problem was that ARK-1 and the other ships ended up bringing tons of both macro and micro parasites which infected Corey and disrupted the ecosystem. The extra competition pushes the native parasites out, since the local macropredators hadn't adapted yet to hunting the new invasive species.\n\n**Bear 'The Duke' Ellington:** So in other words-\n\n**Perri Khan:** Think of it like your stomach.\n\n//The Duke laughs, patting his belly.//\n\n**Perri Khan:** Your stomach is full of bacteria, but you need those to be able to have a healthy gut biome. Your gut biome regulates how you process the food, your nutrient intake, it has a knock-on impact for everything. Corey is a giant stomach, and the parasites were the gut biome bacteria. What the Supervisors did was come in here, kill all of the good bacteria, bring in new bacteria that Corey didn't know how to deal with by mistake, and then maintained the imbalance with their routine parasite cleansings.\n\n**Lauren Stone:** Are you sure that's the only answer Perri? Let's not start a fight with the Supervisors for no reason.\n\n**Perri Khan:** Lauren, not only did they cripple the microfauna's biodiversity, they almost killed Corey. Sure, the macrofauna biodiversity seems to be recovering well enough, but the microfauna's competition had such an impact that they might never recover to the same levels.\n\n**Sarah Wilson:** That means... millions, if not billions of microfauna species went extinct. Because they were trying to help. What the fuck.\n\n//The team is silent. All team members look to Dr. Stone for guidance.//\n\n**Lauren Stone:** I haven't been fully honest with you, but at this point, I need to come clean.

There's no reason to listen to the people who hurt Corey, plus, we're here. We have our goals given to us directly by Fae, we joined this team because we believed in them. Even if WWS has forgotten their mission, we haven't. We will continue research into and caring for Corey until they come here and physically stop us. Of course, only if that is alright with everybody. If not, speak now.\n\n//The crew looks around at each other. Nobody moves to speak, nodding in assent and sharing in their plan.//\n\n**Lauren Stone:** Excellent. Our new priority one is to establish communication with Corey. Where are we with that Dr. Cooke?\n\n**Bradleigh Cooke:** I've been trying to detect any regular seismic events or other astrological happenings that could indicate an attempt at communication, but I've had no success. I want to try and see if we can't build a strong radio transmitter and receiver; if we can send and receive at 52hz, maybe we can try and filter the static and noise into some pattern of communication?\n\n**Lauren Stone:** Duke, can you help Bradleigh gather the parts he needs to finish that radio?\n\n**Bear 'The Duke' Ellington:** Sure, I think we've got some spare mechanics down in the cargo bay. We can get that built in a day, maybe two tops.\n\n**Bradleigh Cooke:** Once we have it built, it will still be a couple of days before I feel confident in declaring anything as an intentional communiqué. This might not even work, but it's our best lead.\n\n//Sarah Wilson raises her hand -- the crew stares at her quizzically, before Lauren points to her.//\n\n**Sarah Wilson:** If it does work, can I be the first person to talk to Corey?

We had tried to expose Corey to both visual and physical stimuli, but had no success. I must assume that while Corey is able to detect those stimuli in part, Perri tells me that they may be connected to a different nervous system entirely -- an animal with separate systems, organized around need and use.\n\nSo we went back to how we first discovered Corey - 52hz radio waves.\n\nTo our delight, Corey hadn't stopped broadcasting on that frequency. Being even closer to the source, we had much more frequent and detailed transmissions - still static, however. But we were making progress.\n\nI compared the original recordings that we had from back in the 2000s, to those we were taking now and noticed some similarities. I kept watching the sound waves of the noise and static, when I was struck by a thought. Maybe the duration, pitch shift and rhythm could be Corey's form of communicating.\n\nI started programming a language model into a digital translator, looking for any patterns that I could see. Nothing was working - so I decided to try and talk back to Corey. We didn't have any clue how to say anything, so we started by transmitting the same static noise back -- hopefully mimicry would let Corey know we were trying to communicate.\n\nWe powered on the transmitter, and waited. Corey has a routine pattern, of sending out a specific signal of static once per cycle. Once we received the transmission, we sent the same noise back at 52hz.\n\nCorey responded. He kept sending transmission after transmission, repeating the same pattern of noise, over and over and over again. With what we know now, that segment of static translates to a single idea.\n\n'Friend'.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Captain's Log - Day 17\n[[/=]]\n------\nI'm not sure how he did it, but Bradleigh has managed to figure out a way of communicating with Corey.

Nearly 100,000 times more powerful than our sun was, Corey can intentionally send out radiation throughout the galaxy, across the known electromagnetic spectrum, while also simulcasting on multiple different wavelengths. On top of that, Corey demonstrates complete control over its four magnetic poles, able to move celestial bodies throughout its zone of influence purely through the manipulation of the magnetic field it generates! Visually, Corey is stunning, and is never exactly the same in photographs.\n\nUp close and personal, the void at the center of Corey explodes out into a sea of vibrant colors and lifeforms. Echoes of azurite, chalcopyrite, creedite, carnelian and peridot crash apart into a cacophony of visual delight - from up close, the colors are always shifting, bending with the light in a dance. The colors can indicate Corey's mood - green tones are joy, so that is the color we most often see!\n\nLooking even closer into Corey, he is a veritable cradle of creation, filled with Twenty-Four **Sextillion** different species of Macrofauna, microfauna and fauna of all sizes! Incredibly, these species consist of nearly 1,000,000 distinct and unique body plans! Compare this to Earth's miniscule 36, you can see just how much of a biological treasure trove Corey is.\n\nThe best part about Corey? Thanks to ARK-2's translator, we can talk directly with Corey! He has emotions, feelings, and a full understanding of every part of him. He's a charming __old__ soul and always wants to make sure that you're okay and enjoying being in his miasmic clouds.
