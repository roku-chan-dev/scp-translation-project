This space is detectable through anomalous fluctuations in cosmological constants at the boundaries of universes, which can only be observed and measured near intersidereal defects in spacetime topology. N-00-DX-32 is theoretically accessible through all topological defects that lead between domain walls, however, specially-designed [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/billiths-proposal Casimirium] probes are necessary to traverse these rifts successfully. Direct containment is impossible; therefore, containment efforts focus on obfuscation, research, and analysis.\n\nThe Astrophysical Anomalies Department's RCS YGGDRASIL, located near topological defect XR-08, is to maintain passive observation of N-00-DX32, scanning for anomalous energy signatures and cataloging debris extruded by SCP-8878-A, if possible. General findings of this nature should be reported to Site-77’s Office of Extraplanar and Astroarchaeological Studies. \n\nEfforts to establish direct communication with SCP-8878-B are prohibited under Ethics Committee Non-Interaction Directive EC-1127. However, any significant changes in activity should be immediately reported to the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA).\n\nFollowing the events of [[span class=\"bd\"]]INCIDENT 8878/01[[/span]], probe surveillance efforts are limited to periods of reduced activity from SCP-8878-A.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div]]\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-8878 is the designation for the anomalous nature of N-00-DX32, the central locus of which is a spacetime fold resembling a supermassive white hole, located at its approximate center (SCP-8878-A). SCP-8878-A has been observed to function similarly to predicted models of white holes, expelling vast quantities of matter, energy, and debris into the surrounding space. Due to dense gasses and particulate matter in the space surrounding SCP-8878-A, a continuous low-frequency hum can be heard, along with a variety of unknown sounds without pattern or cause, originating from beyond the event horizon.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/sgc2c/abcd|caption=The four major classifications of topological defects and an example of each; the Orphic Scar (Type-A/String); Echidna's Gate (Type-B/Gap); Chiron's Tether (Type-C/Knot); Ariadne’s Thread (Type-D/Helix). |width=300px]]\n@@ @@\nThough N-00-DX32 appears devoid of life and many of the expected cosmological features, it contains a significant quantity of debris, nearly all of which are artifacts and detritus of human origin. These items present in variable condition, spanning a wide range of technological and cultural epochs, including those unfamiliar to our history and current time period.\n@@ @@\nMany of these artifacts provide extremely valuable insight into the nature of human civilization. Monolithic ruins, partially-intact megastructures, derelict vessels, unknown technologies, exotic materials, historical records, and personal effects comprise only a portion of the objects observed by RCS YGGDRASIL's survey probes. Though this suggests a diverse history of human activity, no coherent timeline of events has been reconstructed. This is further complicated by limited points of contact with N-00-DX32; previously-used entry points have slowly disappeared over time, though the exact mechanics behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Some speculation exists that defects are being repaired or otherwise removed from reality to deter investigative efforts, though this has not been confirmed.\n@@ @@\nSome notable observations include:\n\n* A child's drawing on crumpled paper, portraying a number of stick figures, labelled in an unknown script and holding hands under a red sun. All but one figure has been scribbled over with red coloring.\n* A stone triptych of a terrestrial landscape progressively overtaken by crystalline growths. \n* An intact satellite identical to the decommissioned Voyager 3 probe, with \"AD ASTRA SED CORPORA NOSTRA RELIQUIT\" etched into the fuselage.\n* A burnt tapestry depicting human figures carrying a yellow, radiant sphere and placing it into a dark spiral.\n* A large, ornate hourglass, its contents now jagged clumps fused into a single mass.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/sgc2c/hole|caption=SCP-8878-A.

Preliminary readings identified N-00-DX32 as a cosmological outlier, possessing extremely low entropy and an unusually-luminous domain wall, which was later determined to be responsible for the characteristically bright appearance of topological defects.
