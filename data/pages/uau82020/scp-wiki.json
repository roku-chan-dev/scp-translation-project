What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[australian-rules|Australian Rules Drag Racing]]] and the Speed Demon series\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[thaumiel|Project Thaumiel]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWriting a 001-proposal is //hard//. While the number \"001\" is barely different from 002 or 003, the slot comes with a veneer of significance and grandeur. One can imagine the stress of writing something of such expectations, trying not to be derivative of others attempts at the task; for many writers over the years, it was a reality for a time. Often, it's an author's magnum opus.\n\nThat's not what [[*user TroyL]] did, though.\n\nThe consequences and logical conclusions of many 001-proposals, while implied, are often left unexplored. This is where Project Thaumiel comes in. By taking another perspective, or bringing something to its eventual end, or simply re-imagining it, each installation of Project Thaumiel explores the implications of each 001-proposal being real, in their individual bubbles of narrative.\n\nSometimes the Foundation tries to stop them. Thaumiel is the opposite of Keter. Sometimes they're complicit. But in each installation, a 001-proposal is given its time in the limelight, the full work of the author shining through. And given \"project-thaumiel\" is a tag, other authors are within their right to create something just as exploratory themselves.\n\nProject Thaumiel has initiated.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write a Project Thaumiel article.\n* **For artists:** Re-imagine an existing 001-proposal, then translate that into a creative medium.",
