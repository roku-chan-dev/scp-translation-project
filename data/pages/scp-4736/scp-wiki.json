[[/footnote]] while under Foundation custody as a result of its inextricable self-relation. This self-relation extended to all aspects of its intersection with hyper-conceptual reality (AKA the Infosphere, the post-dormant Noosphere, the aggregate deific realm), rendering all attempted metaphysical assaults ineffective so long as SCP-4736 understood itself to be immune.\n\nPer accepted workings of forced apotheosis, SCP-4736's previous identity was retroactively purged from hyper-conceptual reality and repurposed into a weapon useful to the Foundation. Following the implementation of a [[[SCP-2578 | hypnestic]]][[footnote]] An injection-based method of altering and manipulating human thought. [[/footnote]]-loaded subdermal [[[SCP-1463|auto-injector]]][[footnote]] Dose Alpha-Cameo; baseline for Class-V Theo-Weapons produced in the modern era. [[/footnote]], it performed certain actions guided by Foundation Central Control such that Operation Astaroth became feasible.\n\nAccolades have been rendered unnecessary by Operation Astaroth. The following remain unawarded to the deceased:\n\n* Foundation Medal of Honor (Bravery, Accomplishment, Control)\n* Foundation Consolation for Theft of Human Goodness (Irreversible)\n* General human recognition/appreciation (Rendered unnecessary)\n* Foundation Recognition of Theocide (First Class)\n\n[!--\n\n[[div class=\"excerpt\"]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n//Tell me again how you died:\nHow you saved the world one last time,\nHow you conquered the future\nAnd came back alive,\nBut withered at the end.//\n\n//Tell me how the world moved on:\nHow the Foundation left\nYour spark to\nSmolder\nAnd\nDes-\ncend.//\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n--]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[DATA LOCKED]\" hide=\"[DATA RELEASED]\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n= [[size 125%]]**<EXPLORATION_LOG.4736 (INITIAL)>**[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**{{DATE:}}** 12/31/[[[SCP-4755 | 2102]]] | 00:00 - 00:47\n\n**{{PERSONNEL INVOLVED:}}** SCP-4736, Sr. Researcher [[[SCP-4260 | Preston Bracks]]] (SiteCommand)\n\n**{{STATION:}}** Site-873\n\n**{{PURPOSE:}}** The necessity of the operation was confirmed by Overwatch Command on May 26, 2005, in order to achieve optimal containment.
