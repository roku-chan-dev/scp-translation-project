The Senior Researcher for SCP-6113[[footnote]]Currently Dr. James Park.[[/footnote]] is to act as SCP-6113-3's \"social worker,\" responsible for SCP-6113-3's wellbeing as well as their normal duties. SCP-6113-3 is to receive a standard education by Foundation educators up until the twelfth grade. While SCP-6113-3 is non-anomalous, standard humanoid containment protocol is in effect.\n\nIn exchange for continued cooperation and good behavior, SCP-6113-3 is allowed limited socialization privileges with approved site personnel of Level 3 or higher as well as access to approved on-site entertainment activities and weekly visits to the Site-17 courtyard, supervised by one project member of Level 3/6113 or higher. Requests for personal items and containment modifications within reason may also be granted upon approval by the SCP-6113 Senior Researcher. To date, SCP-6113-3 has requested:\n* A personal laptop [DENIED]\n* A personal smartphone [DENIED]\n* A Nintendo Switch console with various games [GRANTED]\n* Personalized meals from the Site-17 Cafeteria [DENIED]\n* Various snacks and beverages on request --[DENIED]-- --[GRANTED]-- [OVERRULED BY SITE DIRECTOR, DENIED]\n* Release from containment [DENIED]\n\nOnce SCP-6113-3 reaches the age of 18 in 2025, preparations are to be made for her amnesticization and release in accordance with the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4395 Reintegration Committee].\n\n**Description:** SCP-6113-3 (known as █████ ███████, formerly █████ ███████[[footnote]]Personally identifiable information redacted to protect identity.[[/footnote]]), is a non-anomalous[[footnote]]Objects classed as \"Eparch\" are done so for its anomalous circumstances or relationship to the anomalous rather than for having anomalous properties.[[/footnote]] female human of Filipino descent. Records indicate SCP-6113-3 was born on ██/██/2007, making her 12 years old. She is 152 cm tall and weighs 50 kg, and is generally healthy.\n\nSCP-6113-3 was one of several subjects of SCP-6113. Assigned male at birth, SCP-6113-3 considers herself a transgender female and uses the pronouns \"she/her.\"\n\nDespite SCP-6113-3 being completely non-anomalous, her containment is necessary out of altruism by order of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4175 Ethics Subcommittee for Humanoid Entities] due to the nature of her discovery.\n\n**Addendum 6113-3.1:** Discovery, Personal Background, and Reason for Containment\n\nSCP-6113-3 was discovered on 20/04/2019 in the San Diego, California Stillwater Hospital system when baffled doctors and nurses attempted to treat the effects of her transition event. A child abuse report to Child Protective Services had also been filed by the Jefferson family and the hospital. Before SCP-6113-3's containment, the Jefferson family and hospital staff were questioned to confirm her condition. However, the Jeffersons were mistakenly amnesticized due to a miscommunication before SCP-6113-3 could be returned. Hospital records, legal records, and the CPS report were expunged from all databases.\n\nSCP-6113-3 faced emotional and verbal abuse by her biological parents Jorge and Victoria ███████. She lacked friends and would often face bullying at school. SCP-6113-3 would frequently visit her friend Alena Jefferson, as well as her parents Dameon and Rie Jefferson. SCP-6113-3 would accompany the Jeffersons to their family lake house at what is believed to be SCP-6113-2. After being expelled from her home, SCP-6113-3 came to the Jeffersons, with whom she was discovered. Jorge and Victoria ███████ were not amnesticized, however.\n\nThree days into SCP-6113-3's week-long holding period, during which she was uncooperative, the following memo was sent to Site Director Thomas Graham.\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-6113-1/HR-edit.png) top right no-repeat; background-size: 75px 75px; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n**Ethics Committee Memo**\n\n**Date:** 23/04/2019\n**To:** Site-17 Director Thomas Graham\n**From:** Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian\n**Subject:** SCP-6113 Subject #126\n-----\nGraham,\n\nWe have been watching the SCP-6113 situation closely. With hundreds of civilian subjects passing through our facilities, it is our duty to confirm they are being treated ethically. One of these subjects at your facility has captured our attention: SCP-6113 Subject #126. I am sure you have read her file.\n\nNevertheless, according to the report, she was recently expelled from her home and faced homelessness. In the chaos, it seems the Jefferson family has already been amnesticized by mistake, despite their kindness. Returning Subject #126 would be difficult as the reason for her expulsion has already been cleared from the Jeffersons' memories, and returning her to her biological parents is a non-starter. Under any other circumstances, we would not have interfered, however, this was a massive oversight on the field agents' part.\n\nAs a consequence of their malfeasance, we have deemed it unethical to release Subject #126 into civilian life. We cannot accept her ending up homeless, in foster care, or dead. Therefore, she has been designated SCP-6113-3 and will be held at Site-17 until the age of 18. She is under your care now, draft Containment Procedures appropriately.\n\nWe will be checking on her regularly. Any faults found in her care can and will fall on you.\n\n- Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6113-3.2:** Interview Log 1\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6113-3\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. James Park\n\n**Foreword:** Earliest recorded interview with SCP-6113-3, conducted 4 days after acquisition.\n\n= **<Begin Log, 24/04/2019>**\n\n= //<Dr. Park enters the interview room and sits down.

This gathering of information is, without a doubt, imperative to SCP-6113 containment efforts. However, it is of this commitee's opinion that your interviews with SCP-6113-3 number in unnecessary excess without any significant progress made towards containment. We are to remind you that the separation between object and researcher is an important one. Please remember your duties as a Senior Researcher, or a full investigation of your actions with the Foundation will be conducted, with possible disciplinary measures.\n\n- Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6113-3.11:** Interview Log 21\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6113-3\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. James Park\n\n**Foreword:** Scheduled interview.\n\n= **<Begin Log, 06/09/2019>**\n\n= //<Dr. Park enters the interview room.>//\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** What's up, James?\n\n**Dr. Park:** Hi, █████. How are you?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Eh, could be better. Could be not trapped in here. Oh, speaking of that, James. James. //James,// you have //got// to get a different person to bring me to the courtyard.

No, no, it's fine.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** James, it's been like three months. I can tell when something's on your mind.

I'm... being pressured by my superiors.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Uh huh.\n\n**Dr. Park:** I'm going to have to ask you about -1 and -2.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Wow. So, you get to know me and //then// you go back to using me for information. I see how it is.\n\n**Dr. Park:** █████, I have a job here. Unfortunately, I'm not being paid to talk with you all day.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <thinks for a moment> And, why //should// I help you, anyway? Like, if what you said is true, you're just going to stop people from using it, right? I don't wanna do that. It helped me, it can help others like me.\n\n**Dr. Park:** That is a good point.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** I'm not helping y'all find it.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Hm...\n\n= //<There is silence for a few moments.>//\n\n**Dr. Park:** Think about it this way, █████.

But, that doesn't mean we can't //not// have anyone use it. We could protect those who //do// use it. I'm the leader of this entire project, anyway. I'm sure I could organize //something.//\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Why me, though? You've talked to like hundreds of other people about the lake.

I probably don't want you to get, like, fired or anything.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Then, you do understand I have to remain professional, right?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses> Yeah.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Alright. <sits down> This is Interview Log 22 with SCP-6113-3. <hesitates> Date is September 17th, 2019. Time is 1:04 PM. Now... you were one of SCP-6113-1's subjects, correct?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <shifts in her seat> Yes.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Can you tell me what happened when it appeared to you?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Well, um. After... //that// happened—\n\n**Dr. Park:** Sorry to interrupt, please describe what \"that\" was for the record.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Right, uh, after my parents... kicked me out, //\"it\"// kinda just appeared to me. I don't know, I was kinda just... like... walking down my street. There was no one around, most people were sleeping.\n\n**Dr. Park:** <writing> Mhm. Go on?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** So, there was no one on the street. It was like midnight or something. Obviously, I was in shock and crying and shit, but I looked up and like... she was there?\n\n**Dr. Park:** \"She?\"\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Err, Alena. Well, not like, //Alena// Alena, obviously. But, it looked like her. I didn't see her dad or mom, not even their car. They don't live in the same neighborhood. I didn't... question it, though. Like, it was weird, obviously, but I didn't realize it at the time. And, suddenly, we were talking and walking. I stopped crying, we talked about... y'know... makeup and shit, whatever teenage girls talk about. Didn't even realize it, but there we were at their lake house.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Do you mind telling me what it looked like?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses for a few minutes> I don't... remember.\n\n**Dr. Park:** That's okay. So, you're at the lake, and then what?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** We just... sat at the edge and talked. Felt like hours, I swear I watched the moon set. Just talked and talked and talked.\n\n**Dr. Park:** About what?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Y'know. Her family, our vacations together, shit only her and I knew. Didn't even realize it wasn't her.\n\n**Dr. Park:** It knew all of it without asking you.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Right. <pauses> Then, she brought it up.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Brought \"what\" up?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Y'know, transitioning, like that sorta thing.\n\n**Dr. Park:** What kind of things?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Like, clothes I wanted to wear, HRT, name changes, surgery, all that jazz.\n\n**Dr. Park:** And, how'd that make you feel?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Nervous? Uncomfortable? I kinda forgot that I was //just// kicked out. I even told her that.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Right... what happened after that?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** She took me in this big warm hug. It was like 30 degrees and she was //warm.// Told me everything was going to be alright and all. She said she loved me and she'd pick me up soon.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Huh.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** She told me to look in the lake. And, I mean, yeah. You probably know what happened from there.\n\n**Dr. Park:** Well, say it anyway. For the records.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Okay, well, I stood up and looked in the water. And, like, dude, it was //weird.// I //saw// myself turn into a girl. //Me.// A //girl.// Like, holy //shit.// I kinda just... got on my knees and started crying. Then, Alena grabbed me by the shoulders and picked me up and said we had to go. So, we walked away and suddenly I was back on my home street. Not even at the end of the block.\n\n= //<There is silence for a few moments.>//\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** She said she had to go, but that she'd be back. So, we hugged and said \"bye,\" and then she was just gone.\n\n**Dr. Park:** You weren't confused or anything?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Of course, I was. All of this was confusing. I was angry, depressed, I suddenly had a girl's body. <pauses> I was //euphoric//, though. I called Alena and told her everything. Her and her parents came to pick me up. And, well, then we went to the hospital. You know what happened then.\n\n**Dr. Park:** How did they react?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** Wouldn't you know?\n\n**Dr. Park:** Please, SC— Please, just tell me if you're comfortable.\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <sigh> Okay. They were furious at my parents mostly. Then, they noticed I looked different. Smaller shoulders, big hips, my clothes not really fitting me anymore. Chalked it up to puberty. Alena didn't even remember what just happened. Thought I was so depressed I was hallucinating or something, I don't know. When she gave me a hug, though, she just... didn't feel as warm. The real kicker, though, is when I had to go to the bathroom. //That's// when they took me to the hospital.\n\n= //<Dr. Park writes on his clipboard for several minutes in silence.>//\n\n**Dr. Park:** Thank you for the testimony. We'll talk more about this later. Is there anything else you would like to state?\n\n**SCP-6113-3:** <pauses> Um... no.
