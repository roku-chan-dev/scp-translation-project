Talan\n\n**Clearance Level:** Level 3\n\n**Position:** Involved in documentation of objects and events pertaining to the Foundaton and SCP objects. \n\n\n**History:** Dr. Talan was recruited by the Foundation following his graduation from ███████ █████ ███████████ in 19██. Following his recruitment, Talan quickly proved valuable to the Human Resources department, with superiors citing that he is “friendly, companionable, easy to get along with, and level-headed.” Talan is currently on assignment to HR, being transferred as needed from location to location.\n\n//Note: Talan, while generally a good worker, does have a tendency to put things off until the last possible minute. Attempts to bring this to his attention typically result in the phrase, “I’ll fix it later.” Attempts are ongoing to solve the issue. – Dr. ███████ Psychology Dept.//\n\n//Note: Moderate success noted. Attempts are ongoing, but at a greatly increased time-frame. – Dr. ███████ Psychology Dept.//\n\n\n\n__Event Reports Filed__:\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Montala\" separate=\"no\" limit=\"250\" perPage=\"250\" tags=\"tale\" order=\"title\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Out of Character]]\n\nWell, if you’re here reading this, you actually want to find out a bit more about //me//, as opposed to him. \n\n--At the time of writing-- Following updates, because life has a tendency to change directions, I’m a 20 year old college student double-majoring in Computer Engineering Technology and also Information Technology, in addition to a possible two minors on top of that, Electrical Engineering Technology and (possibly) Computer Science, if I like it well enough. I’m generally very affable, very easy to get along with, always willing to crack a (sometimes bad) joke, and overall friendly, at least until you give me a good reason not to be. Even then, I’m very much the forgive-and-forget type of person, so I’ll likely forget about it eventually. Unless it was something serious, in which case it may take a long time. \n\nI’m very willing to help out anyone who needs help, so feel free to send me a PM if you need a draft looked over or something…with scips, I’m decent with tone and grammar/spelling/sentence flow stuff, though you’d be better served to go to someone else for ideas…I can get my own, but I have some slight difficulty helping others flesh out their ideas a majority of the time, which is why I don’t lurk on the Ideas and Brainstorming forum. \n\nWith Tales, which is so far what I write, I’m good with grammar, spelling, sentence flow, decent with character development, dialogue, dialogue flow, etc. I’ll be one of the first to tell you when your dialogue is stilted and unnatural. Like I said, if you have something you’d like looked over, feel free to PM me. \n\nI’m in site19 more regularly now, but not for as long of periods of time as I'd like when I am. I'm semi-active in chat and looking to be more active on a consistent basis, which should be somewhat easy to accomplish now. I'm typically on at least once a day or more, and easy to get ahold of...just send me a .tell through Alex and I'll get it in short order.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Data on my stuff]]\n\nThis is just for my personal ease more than anything…just a place to keep all my ratings and such in one place.\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Montala\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"scp, joke, tale, scp-fuel, project\" order=\"title\" prependLine=\"||~ Article ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Last Comment ||\"]] \n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%commented_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
