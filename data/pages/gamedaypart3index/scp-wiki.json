The Foundation is on its back foot. Chaos Insurgency elements are openly attacking SCP Foundation facilities. Marshall, Carter, and Dark are rushing around snatching up everything they can find. The war of the paranormal has gone overt. \n\nThe theme for Phase 3 is PROTECT. This is the Foundation's darkest hour. They are in a fight for their own survival. Some story ideas include:\n\n* Tempest Night 2: a massive-scale attack on multiple Foundation sites.\n* Pizzicato: Will the GOC join the overt war? And what will happen if they do?\n\nAct 3 is wide-open. Anyone can contribute a story to this metaplot. Go nuts. Refer to other stories. Let's build a world.\n\nThis page here will serve as an index and reference for the Phase 3 storyline, including a rough timeline and index by storyline.\n\nFinally: there is no \"approved writers\" list for Game Day Phase 3. Anyone and everyone should feel free to contribute to this as a writer: however, the normal rules for story deletion (deleted at -10 votes) still apply.\n\nWe now have a chatroom: #scpgameday on SynIRC\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n [[[game-day-part-3-synchronous| Game Day Part 3: Synchronous]]] by Anonymous\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
