The whole damn season!\n\nIf you're wondering why, there's a pretty good reason.\n\nWhen Cim was a child, Christmas gave him a fright,\n\nOn holiday's eve, getting tucked in at night.\n\nThere was a loud //CRASH//, a //BANG//, and a //FALL//!\n\nAnd on the next morning, there was no Christmas at all!\n\nNo tree, no presents, they had all disappeared!\n\nA curious case, unsolved for years.\n\nSo he sat in his cave in a furious rage.\n\n\"19's Christmas party planner? That'll be the day!\"\n\nHe knew all the staff at 19 beneath,\n\nWere busy now, hanging their Christmas wreathes\n\n\"There's a secret santa!\" he cried, as he chugged another beer,\n\n\"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's the worst time of the year!\"\n\nCimmerian pouted, with his large fingers drumming,\n\n\"I MUST find a way to stop Christmas from coming!\"\n\nFor tomorrow, he knew all the Foundation's personnel,\n\nWould get a day off! They'd be backed up to hell.\n\nAnd then! Oh, the music! The music just sucked!\n\nThe same 5 songs made him want to collide with a truck!\n\nThen the Staff, young and old, would talk about their kids.\n\nTheir families, how they celebrated, every last thing they did!\n\nCimmerian was lonely, and he liked it that way!\n\nHe could make YouTube videos for fun every day!\n\nAnd then there was the thing he liked least of all.\n\nAll staff at -19, the tall and the small,\n\nWould throw a Christmas party, with feasting and singing!\n\nA Gingerbread contest? His alarm bells were ringing.\n\nAnd the more Cim thought of this Christmas partying,\n\nThe more Cim thought, \"I must stop this whole thing!\"\n\n\"Why, for forty-some years I've put up with it now!\"\n\n\"I MUST stop this party from happening. But HOW?\"\n\nThen he got an idea! An awful idea!\n\nJEREMIAH CIMMERIAN GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!\n\n\"I know just what to do! I've done it before!\"\n\n\"Six hundred and fifty, no less and no more!\"\n\nHe chuckled and clucked, \"What a Cimmerian-trick!\"\n\n\"It's brash, it's bold, and Cimmerian-slick!\"\n\n\"Wait, what was that?\" Cim looked around.\n\nHe could have sworn that he heard a loud banging sound!\n\nHis worries were heightening as he crept from his bed,\n\nWhile visions of burglary danced in his head!  \n\nHe tip-toed to the living room, prepared to attack,\n\nBut when he saw what he saw, he tried to turn back!\n\nA naked, green... //thing// was crouched on the ground,\n\nWho met Cim's gaze with a prodigious, green frown.\n\nCim looked to his right, and what a sight did he see!\n\nThis furry green fucker was decorating a tree!\n\nWith tinsel and lights and ornaments galore,\n\nThere were dozens of presents, all set on the floor!\n\n\"And who the hell are you?\" Cimmerian hissed.\n\nThe creature jumped up, and Cim's chin met its fist.\n\nHis face stung red, that was no mere pinch!\n\n\"I'll give you a hint. I'm the motherfucking Grinch.\"\n\n\"I used to hate Christmas, and what I say is true,\"\n\n\"It was //ME// who once stole that Christmas from you!\"\n\nCimmerian's mouth had morphed to an 'O'\n\nHis blood boiled red, he was ready to go!\n\n\"But Cim, I've changed! Christmas is most pleasant!\"\n\n\"So I've come back here to give you some presents!\"\n\nBut Cim wouldn't listen to that ugly green bum,\n\nHe hated Christmas for sure, and he was drunk off the rum.\n\n\"Get your ass out my house!\" The alcohol spoke,\n\nAnd then the Grinch realized Cim was no joke!\n\nThe Grinch put his hands up, \"At least can we talk?\"\n\nAs if from thin air, Cim whipped out his Glock!\n\nWhen Cim pulled the trigger, there was a blinding flash!\n\nDid it hit? Was there a pile of Grinchy Who-Ash?\n\nBut the smoke clearedâ€” the Grinch dodged Cim's attack!\n\n\"If this is what you want,\" The Grinch said, \"Let's dance.\"\n\nA salvo of bullets, which the Grinch dodged with ease.\n\nHe ran across the room, and ducked behind the tree!\n\nFighting was something the Grinch came to love,\n\nAnd he was no bitch when push came to shove!\n\nAs Jeremiah reloaded, the Grinch leapt fast,\n\nWith his Grinchy Kung-//Who//, he'd whip Cim's ass!\n\nHe kicked away the gun - disarming was no bother!\n\nAs the two exchanged blows, their fighting spirits grew hotter!\n\nA left hook from Cim! A block from the Grinch!\n\nA sharp Christmas Jab! A sweeping right kick!\n\nThe two thought swiftly, and moved very quick,\n\nUntil the Grinch keeled over from Cim's kick-the-dick-trick!\n\n\"It's over, I've won, you merry-making bastard!\"\n\n\"You're pathetically weak, and I beat you while plastered!\"\n\nThe Grinch regained his senses, (except in his crotch)\n\nAnd mentally prepared to turn up a notch.\n\nHe began with a flip that hit Cim in the face.\n\nIt carried the strength of the whole Who race!\n\n\"Taste my Grinch fingers!\" He said, quite hostile,\n\nAnd shoved his green talons up Dr. C's nostrils!\n\nBut Cim pushed back, and though it hurt bunches,\n\nHe proceeded to deal out 650 punches!\n\nHit after hit, the Grinch only felt pain.\n\nHe thought to himself, \"I must win this foul game!\"\n\nThe Grinch caught Cim's fist, \"I was saving this for later.\"\n\nAnd later was now! \"Say hello to my Lightsaber!\"\n\nIt was candy-cane colored, an elegant weapon.\n\nWould Cimmerian lose? There would be no question!\n\nA swing from above caught Cim off guard,\n\nBut in the heat of the moment, Cimmerian dove far!\n\nHe landed in a corner, and what did he see?\n\nHis trusty old gun, which the Grinch knocked from thee!\n\nCim shot from behind, and the Grinch failed to notice!\n\nThe bullet hit his back, \"So happy I didn't blow it!\"\n\nThe Grinch, poorly wounded, let go of his saber,\n\nAnd uttered his last words to the Christmas-day hater.\n\n\"All I wanted to do, was to show you some cheer,\"\n\n\"After all, Jeremiah, Christmas comes once a year.\"\n\nThe blade rolled slowly towards Cim's feet,\n\nAnd he picked it up quickly while gritting his teeth.\n\n\"You'll never change my mind,\" Cimmerian said,\n\nAnd as the blade connected it lopped off the Grinch's head!\n\nHe sighed with relief. How hard he had fought!\n\n\"You're wrong about Christmas, you little green twat.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 8590135543_58cfb6fddb_b.jpg\n> **Name:** Soft...Spring...Snowfall\n> **Author:**  Javcon117*\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://wordpress.org/openverse/image/ca7004c9-3680-4a2a-8d86-1974e3da1cdc/?referrer=creativecommons.org Openverse]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
