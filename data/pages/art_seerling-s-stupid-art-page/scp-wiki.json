Keep yourself entertained with whatever I puked up. (Most of my art are uploaded from different sites back then.)\n\nBTW, I use Procreate for everything.

The petting tests aimed to see how specific SCPs would react to affectionate physical touch, although some suspect it was an excuse just to pet them.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Series |]]\n+ SCP-173\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629721_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.46cbb3309026916069b8a3c48e9dd995.jpg?f1711769557]]\n**Report:** For this experiment, Dr Baskerville sends out three D-Class to maintain eye contact, with one providing petting. However, in 20 minutes, at least one D-Class, the one who petted the anomaly, made it out alive while the other two died from the SCP.\nWhen questioned, he provided that the entity's body texture is cold rough concrete. He also said that, during petting, he suddenly felt warmth slowly coming from the entity. His claims are yet to be proven.\n+ SCP-729-J\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629719_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.313b3755022016eabbbf9c470316ab97.jpg?f1711769556]]\n**Report:** Due to SCP-729-J's...nature, Dr Baskerville resorted to using a long wooden stick to attempt to touch that monstrosity. She can only do as far as slightly caressing it with the tip of the stick before bailing out.\nWhen asked about the experience, Dr Baskerville still felt petrified and agitated from the experiment. Due to this, Dr Baskerville was given SCP-999 to calm her down.\n+ SCP-999\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629722_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.46cbb3309026916069b8a3c48e9dd995.jpg?f1711769557]]\n**Report:** The test on SCP-999 is easily approved due to its friendly nature and trouble-free containment procedure. SCP-999 is later found during its feeding time, during which the test is postponed temporarily until it is done eating.\nUpon contacting it, as expected, Dr Baskerville and the entity enjoyed the activity without slowing down. Once it ended, both expressed satisfaction, but only 999 expressed a longing for more petting again.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Series |||]]\n+ ●●|●●●●●|●●|●\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629723_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.7dc8b8a0fa6cd043ca143aee17009f2f.webp?f1711769615]]\n+ SCP-2913\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629724_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.7dc8b8a0fa6cd043ca143aee17009f2f.jpg?f1711769558]]\n**Report:** SCP-2913 is currently in its containment cell, watching television. With much cooperation, SCP-2913 expressed approval for Dr Baskerville to pet it. During the process, SCP-2913 showed physical signs of happiness with its fingers forming a smile.\nWhen asked, SCP-2913 expressed how it felt tenderness from the test and wished for more of it. Dr Baskerville remarks that it felt like holding someone's attached hand.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Series V]]\n+ SCP-4342\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629725_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.5b505fdb038352b4785414a0f6119110.jpg?f1711769565]]\n**Report:** Because SCP-4342 is open for testing, Dr Baskerville went in and pet the object. Here is the result:\n> **Testing Personnel:** Dr Baskerville\n> **Stimuli:** Being petted by Dr Baskerville.\n> \n> **Results:** SCP-4342 becomes red.\n> //I think it likes it. We should do more tests.// - Dr Baskerville\n+ ⋆𐙚₊˚⊹♡ SCP-4494\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629726_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.5b505fdb038352b4785414a0f6119110.jpg?f1711769565]]\n**Report:** After another successful crime control, Dr Baskerville conducted a small talk with //**The Specter**//. Halfway through the conversation, Dr Baskerville asked the entity if she could pet them. Initially confused and sceptical, //**SCP-4494**// ultimately accepts the offer.\nWhen petting, Dr Baskerville recounted how its skin felt human-like. It is also observed that //**The Specter**// seemed to appreciate the physical contact. When asked about the experience, it said that the only bad thing about it was that it ended sooner. Further discussion revealed that //**The Specter**// was initially flustered and embarrassed, but also said that it appreciated the gesture.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Series V|]]\n+ SCP-5031\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629727_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.5b505fdb038352b4785414a0f6119110.jpg?f1711769565]]\n**Report:** Following the approval of the O5 and Stanley Huxtable, D-52125 is authorize to pet the entity. It was during this time that the entity finished cooking up blueberry pancakes. It is observed that, through the entity's casting shadow, the tail seemingly wags during the process.\nWhen questioned, D-52125 commented that the texture of the skin was soft but tight, and he could feel some bone poking out slightly from its skin. He also mentions that this test made him and SCP-5031 have an emotional connection.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Series V||]]\n+ SCP-6369\n[[image https://art.ngfiles.com/images/5572000/5572532_629728_asylumdisorder_scp-petting-tests.aaef9a465818143a0a0cbfe31b0a8c12.jpg?f1711769571]]\n**Report:** \n> **Caller:** Dr. Baskerville\n> **Lost Item:** Dr. Baskerville’s key, lost in hallway\n>  **SCP-6369 Response:** 1 rat, searched for 8 minutes.\n> **Payment Given:** 3 blueberries and a light head pet (in between the ears)\n> **Note:** SCP-6369-A seemed to enjoy the petting, lasted 1 minute before departing.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n(BTW, is any of this too ooc for its good?
