Each day, SCP-████ would generate a brief statement regarding Foundation operations and personnel, contained or uncontained anomalies, Groups of Interest, and other //sub velamine// topics, presented by the character \"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8190 Sammy Skipper]\".[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]No such mascot had been previously used by the Office of Personnel Engagement prior to the non-anomalous version of the column.[[/span]]\n\nAttempts to remove SCP-████ from the scipnet homepage proved ineffectual, as the underlying code was not altered by the anomaly's presence. Creation of an alternate homepage likewise had no effect, as the anomaly migrated to the new version as soon as it was instituted.\n\nNot all statements are factually correct within baseline reality as it is currently understood; SCP-████ makes numerous references to non-existent persons, locations, and events, presents unproven hypotheses or opinions as fact, and regularly contradicts its own statements.\n\nIt is not known if this is deliberate misinformation or reflective of non-baseline reality. In the latter scenario, the corpus of Sammy Skipper's Fact of the Day presents one of the most thorough surveys of non-baseline reality currently available.\n\nA complete log of all 377 entries generated by SCP-████ is included below for archival purposes. So as to obscure any classified information within the corpus, this version of the document does not mark verifiable statements or provide additional contextual notes.\n\n[[=]]\n------------------------\n++ **Sammy Skipper's Fact of the Day (2022 Archive)**\n------------------------\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n------------------------\n+++ **January**\n------------------------\n[[/=]]\n[[size 125%]]//Sammy Skipper Says...//[[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]]\"Howdy-hey Foundationeers, I’m Sammy Skipper!

Flocks of saucers, zooming over the forests of prototaxites and moss? The vast fungal intelligences of the deep mycelium? Magnificent. ||\n||~ 4.JAN || [[[SCP-076]]] is normally only 5’2” tall, but can reach a height of 8’9” during riastrad. ||\n||~ 5.JAN || [[[SCP-073]]] is 6’4”, cannot enter riastrad, and is regularly confused for Bigfoot. He isn't actually one of the Children of the Night, just very tall and very hairy.||\n||~ 6.JAN || SCP-076’s common name comes from his initial Omega-7 designation as “Asset ABLE”. It wasn’t until the recovery of SCP-073 almost a decade later that they became “Cain and Able” as a joke. ||\n||~ 7.JAN || Documents referring to them as Qayim and Hevel are using poetic license. ||\n||~ 8.JAN || Their actual names are Ngatûk and Tègwa. Their younger brother is Sho. ||\n||~ 9.JAN || SCP-076 had several dogs prior to his enslavement by the Dhamaughr-kòm. Translated, their names are Mighty One, Thunderer, Black-Spotted, and Dumbass. ||\n||~ 10.JAN || “Ab-leshal” comes from a transcription error in the early Daevite translation project. Properly translated, the glyphs would be read as “Aveshal”. ||\n||~ 11.JAN || DNA analysis of SCP-076 and SCP-073 reveals that they are about 35% neanderthal. ||\n||~ 12.JAN || Five different civilizations are referred to as “Daevites”, four of them erroneously. ||\n||~ 13.JAN || First are the Dhamaughr-kòm, who existed prior to the Tenzing-Wolfe Restructuring Event. ||\n||~ 14.JAN || Second are the Anggyut, the post-TWRE equivalent of the Dhamaughr-kòm, who were called //daevas// by Xerxes I.||\n||~ 15.JAN || Third are the Daevites, a fictionalized and highly distorted version of the Anggyut Khanate invented and subsequently forced upon reality by Thomas Bruce, 6th Earl of Elgin. ||\n||~ 16.JAN || Fourth is the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6140 Republic of Daevastan], the modern descendants of the Anggyut Khanate that have since returned to baseline after the dissolution of the Chronicle’s effects. ||\n||~ 17.JAN || Lastly is the Red Empire, an interstellar-interuniversal polity currently warring against the Solidarity and its allies. ||\n||~ 18.JAN || The written form of Archaic Daevite never underwent spelling reform in its thousand plus years of use. Making it all even worse, the symbols were adapted from the script used by the Shushèngo despite the languages having little phonological overlap. It is a fucking nightmare ||\n||~ 19.JAN || The Anggyut trace their political lineage back to the god-king Shomash Udal, who according to legend united seven tribes through his marriage to the daughters of seven kings. ||\n||~ 20.JAN || This was the justification given for both the Anggyut kings’ harem and the later transformation of that group into the seat of the Sevenfold Empress. ||\n||~ 21.JAN || Radical cultural and political changes swept through the Anggyut during the Heptarchy Period by necessity: the Ionite Rebellion had shattered the empire beyond any hope of return to its former state. ||\n||~ 22.JAN || Ion could have assumed control of the empire, but the war with the Mekhanites drew his attention elsewhere. It’s unclear if he actually would have, considering his apparent goals.||\n||~ 23.JAN || Incidentally, Ion is the winner of the “Scariest Motherfucker to Walk this Base Earth” award. That is some stiff competition, let me tell you. Lots of people will go for Sigurrós Stefánsdóttir, which is understandable, but Ion actually became Thaumarch. ||\n||~ 24.JAN || Casualty estimates for the sacking of Amoni-Ram are wildly divergent, thanks to lack of reliable records: the lower end is 350,000 dead in the space of less than four months, plus the shattering of the last fully functional Sophia node on Earth. ||\n||~ 25.JAN || Amoni-Ram, filled with the dying breath of the Broken Goddess, tore herself from the earth and cast herself into the unknown. She floats there still, unmoored from time and place, her streets haunted by ruined mechanisms and Adiyumite ghouls.   ||\n||~ 26.JAN || With the city vanished and Ion ascended, the armies of Adi-um found themselves a very long way from home. The final months before the Bronze Age Collapse CK Event saw Mekhanite forces regroup and launch a brutal counterattack. ||\n||~ 27.JAN || Among the Dhamaughr-kòm nobility, a woman taking top position was considered equivalent to bestiality. If caught, the male partner would be castrated as punishment; the woman would be executed immediately. ||\n||~ 28.JAN || The most-reviled figure among the Dhamaughr cosmology was //Aung-su-Dhazu//: a force of primordial chaos slain by the Wounded Lord, whose body was used to build the cosmos. ||\n||~ 29.JAN || SCP-████ (“The Postman Thoth and the Chapar Khaneh”) is an inter-universal postal service, operated through the Way network by legions of postbirds. Thoth himself is one of the ten Great Librarians, though he’s more concerned with what passes through the Library than what remains in it. ||\n||~ 30.JAN || The 12 Lords of San Kowloon are wizard crime lords. They and their gangs are easily identified by their zodiac-based masks, some astoundingly fucked up and gross magic (ever see someone’s bones melt and then resolidify inside their own body?), and iron-fisted control of the occult drug trade in southeast Asia. ||\n||~ 31.JAN || In the modern day, Daevastani biomancers are a vital component of the Confederation’s ecological recovery efforts. ||\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n------------------------\n+++ **February**\n------------------------\n[[/=]]\n[[size 125%]]//Did You Know?//[[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]]\"The 'kill kill kill' characterization of the Coalition isn't unfounded (Operations ICHABOD, CALICO, and FARRAGUT would like to say hello), but it's definitely some serious projection and revisionism on the Foundation's part; we really don't like admitting how often we've interpreted 'containment' as 'put a bullet in everyone on site'.\"[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sammy-skipper-s-fact-of-the-day/samhmm.png width=\"175px\" style=\"right:0!important;bottom:0!important;position:absolute;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n||~ 1.FEB || No currently-used cosmological model can adequately classify the thing beyond [[[SCP-093]]]. ||\n||~ 2.FEB || The last direct-descendant state of the Ortothan Ecumene collapsed 37 million years ago.
