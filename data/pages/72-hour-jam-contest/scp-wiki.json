From February 17th through February 19th, you will write three stories over a three day period, competing for honor, glory, and meaningless prizes. This contest is designed to squeeze inspiration out of you and see what kind of works you can produce in an accelerated timeframe. \n\n+ The Grand Prize\n\n+++ The Grand Prize goes to [[*user Rimple]] with a cumulative 197 upvotes!\n++++ The Silver Medal goes to [[*user Weryllium]] with 139 total upvotes!\nCongratulations to you both, as well as to every other participant for submitting damn fine work!\n\n+ The Contest\n\nThe contest will be broken up into three periods of 24 hours each. At the beginning of each period, a **THEME** will be announced. From the moment the THEME is announced, contestants will have exactly 24 hours to write an article based on that theme. All contest articles posted for each period must adhere to that period's theme - if you write an article for the first period but only post it in the second period, that article will be disqualified. \n\nWinners will be determined by vote count. There will be first place winners for each theme, as well as a Grand Prize Winner for the entrant who writes for all three themes and amasses the highest overall vote count.\n\nYou are free to solicit as much critique as you can get within the time period. \n\n\n+ Rules:\n\n# The contest will begin at 12:01 AM (EST) on February 17 and end at 12:01 AM (EST) on February 20.\n# Authors may not collab with each other. One author per article only! You can still get critique from as many people as you can! \n# As soon as a theme is announced, entries for that theme are OPEN. As soon as the NEXT theme is announced, entries for the PREVIOUS theme are CLOSED. You can still post articles for closed themes, but they will not be considered as valid entries.\n# Authors may submit any number of entries per theme. Only the three highest-rated entries (highest entry per theme) will be considered for voting totals.\n# Each theme's entries will have seven days, beginning from the END of their posting period, to accumulate votes. At the end of this period, net upvotes will be tallied and used to determine the final placements.\n# All types of articles - SCPs, Tales, and GOI Formats - are allowed.\n# Entries can be as long or as short as you want, stretching over multiple articles or centered on a single page. \n# Authors do not have to submit entries for all three themes; you may pick and choose which themes to submit to, but only authors who submit entries for all three themes will be considered for the Grand Prize.\n# No significant edits after the entry has been posted. If you wouldn't do it to someone else's work, don't do it to your own until the contest ends.\n# Contest entries will go through the normal deletion process. As there is no limit on the number of entries you may post, you may always reenter. However, you may **not** repost a new version of a previously deleted entry in the contest. You can always submit these documents to the site again, but they cannot reenter the contest. \n# Entries must be new. You cannot edit or suggest an existing document for this contest.\n# **Tag your entries with 'jam-con2018'.**\n\nWinners will be chosen through total upvotes. At the conclusion of the contest, a post will be made by the judges announcing winners and awarding special prizes to deserving entries. The judges for this contest are [[*user A Random Day]] and [[*user ProcyonLotor]] - please PM them with any further questions you might have.\n\n+ The Themes\n\n+++ **Dawn of the First Day: Murder Mystery**\n\n++++ Murder Mystery Top 3!\n* [[*user Communism Will Win]] with [[[scp-3154|SCP-3154: Terminal State Inducer]]].\n* [[*user Weryllium]] with [[[SCP-049-D]]].\n* [[*user PeppersGhost]] with [[[scp-3306|SCP-3306: The Murder-Go-Round]]].\n\n++++ Special Awards!\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Special Awards\" hide=\"- Awarded at judge's discretion\" hideLocation=\"both\"]] \n\n**Nostradamus:**  [[*user Weryllium]], with [[[SCP-049-D]]], for predicting the Jam Contest Theme of the Third Day before it was announced!\n**Begone, Thot:** [[*user Rimple]], with [[[SCP-3772]]], for being convinced by the judges to add a Bad and Boujee reference to their article in exchange for a gag award!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ All Entries!\n [[collapsible show=\"+ Show entries\" hide=\"- Hide entries\" hideLocation=\"both\"]] \n\n[[module css]]\n.contest-block .contest-entry {\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 110%;\n    margin-bottom: 5px;\n    color: #633;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"contest-block content-panel\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nEntries\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"+jam-con2018 +_murder-mystery -hub\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\" date=\"2018.02.17\"]]\n* [[size 120%]]**%%title_linked%%**[[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// **%%created_by%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ **Dawn of the Second Day: Tropical**\n\n++++ Tropical Top 3!\n* [[*user Kalinin]] with [[[scp-3977|SCP-3977: Hawaiian Punch]]].\n* [[*user Weryllium]] with [[[scp-3759|SCP-3759: Isle of the Tortoise Terminarch]]].\n* [[*user Rimple]] with [[[scp-3224|SCP-3224: The Miracle of Life]]].\n\n++++ Special Awards!\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Special Awards\" hide=\"- Awarded at judge's discretion\" hideLocation=\"both\"]] \n\n**Why We Can't Have Nice Things**: The official complainants, for making sure there will be a new rule in the next contest, and the sly dogs involved, who know what they did.\n\n**/r/HailCorporate:** Kalinin, with [[[SCP-3977]]], for writing the best article that made me want to buy a commercial product!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ All Entries!\n [[collapsible show=\"+ Show entries\" hide=\"- Hide entries\" hideLocation=\"both\"]] \n\n[[module css]]\n.contest-block .contest-entry {\n    font-weight: bold;\n    font-size: 110%;\n    margin-bottom: 5px;\n    color: #633;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"contest-block content-panel\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nEntries\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages separate=\"no\" tags=\"+jam-con2018 +_tropical -hub\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\" date=\"2018.02.17\"]]\n* [[size 120%]]**%%title_linked%%**[[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// **%%created_by%%**[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n+++ **Dawn of the Third Day: \"It was a dark and stormy night...\"**\n\n++++ Dark and Stormy Night Top 3!\n* [[*user Rimple]] with [[[scp-3880|SCP-3880: ILLEST RAIN SOUNDS âˆž Hours No Looping - White Noise, Nature/Healing/Ambient, Meditation/Insomnia/Study ASMR (ORIGINAL)]]]\n* [[*user Tanhony]] with [[[scp-3271|SCP-3271: It was a Dark and Stormy Knight]]].\n* [[*user MaliceAforethought]] with [[[magnum-opus-or-a-diatribe-in-defence-of-cliche|Magnum Opus;
