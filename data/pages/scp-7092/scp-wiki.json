Their corpses were discovered in an open plot of land in Greeley, Colorado on October 19, 2021 when both entities crashed and expired.\n\nSCP-7092-1 was the first of the two entities to land. Satellite footage shows that it had manifested in the northern hemisphere above the earth's exosphere at around 8:40 pm MDT before landing in Greeley. It was illuminated with a bright-orange color and appeared to be riding another entity in the shape of a steed. This entity dissipated when it entered the mesosphere, leading SCP-7092-1 to lose its balance and expire upon colliding with the ground.\n\nAn autopsy showed that SCP-7092-1's entire body was constructed out of hot embers, which had decreased in warmth at the time of examination. It wore a grey coat sewn with threads of an unidentifiable metal and a tan bandana made of mineral wool wrapped around its mouth.\n\nInside the left pocket of SCP-7092-1's jacket was a package wrapped in a leather sheet held together with twine wrapped in a bow. Within the package was a heart-shaped locket made of steel. Inside the locket was a music box that played the tune of \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" by Elvis Presley when opened.\n\nAt around 9:00 pm MDT, SCP-7092-2 manifested in the southern hemisphere. It emitted a white gas from its body and accelerated towards the surface in an orb-shaped formation before it collided with the ground, landing approximately 8 meters away from SCP-7092-1.\n\nThe body of SCP-7092-2 was found to be constructed of nitrogen ice and iron-nickel rock. It bore a wide-brimmed hat made of titanium and a damaged leather jacket. \n\nAdditional items found on SCP-7092-2's body were a banjo withered from collision damage and a folded-up page of sheet music of the song \"You Are My Sunshine\" by Jimmie Davis.\n\nFurther research concerning the connection between SCP-7092-1 and SCP-7092-2 is ongoing.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** landingsite.jpg\n> **Name:** Tswaing crater montage.jpg\n> **Author:** Myiu\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tswaing_crater_montage.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7091]]] | SCP-7092 | [[[SCP-7093]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
