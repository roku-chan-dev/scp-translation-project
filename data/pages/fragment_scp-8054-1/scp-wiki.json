Transcriptions, whether digital or manual, from SCP-8054's contents are strictly prohibited unless expressly sanctioned for research purposes. Authorized research endeavors involving SCP-8054 require pre-approval from a minimum of two Level 4 personnel and should be performed in Isolation Chamber IC-8054-A.\n\nSCP-8054 is to be stored in a high-security vault and must be kept free of any computer hardware or digital interfaces. Despite the current inactivity of SCP-8054's anomalous properties, stringent operational and access protocols are to be maintained. This includes specialized training for security personnel assigned to SCP-8054, focusing on detection and countering of reality-bending anomalies.\n\nAny unsanctioned activation, distribution, or transcription of VeritasCode is regarded as a containment breach. In the event of such a breach, Site-46 is to undergo an immediate lockdown. MTF Rho-0 (\"Technical Support\") should be mobilized to decode and neutralize any potentially executed VeritasCode sequences.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:**\nSCP-8054 consists of three distinct manuals titled \"Lingua Veritas Vols. I-III.\" These manuals serve as comprehensive guides to an anomalous programming language dubbed \"VeritasCode.\" At a cursory glance, VeritasCode borrows syntactical structures from conventional object-oriented programming languages. However, its functions, operators, and data structures directly interact with and manipulate reality rather than a digital environment.\n\nVeritasCode's capability to enact tangible alterations in the physical realm range from simple object manipulations, such as transmuting materials, to complex spatial and temporal alterations. VeritasCode was observed displaying the ability to rewind localized time, to alter gravitational constants within confined areas, to dictate existence or non-existence of matter, and more. Extremely intricate codes, especially those attempting to rewrite large swathes of reality, were noted to have a higher failure rate.\n\nHowever, the current dormant state of SCP-8054 stands in stark contrast to its formerly limitless abilities. The possibility of its reactivation, while speculated, remains unverified.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access File System\" hide=\"Access File System\"]]\n@@    @@> [[a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8054/offset/2\"]]SCP-8054 File - Discovery Log - Addendum.
