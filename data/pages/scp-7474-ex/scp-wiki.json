Initial communication with SCP-7474-1 established that it had not been harmed by the gunfire, and that it was willing to co-operate with the Foundation. SCP-7474-1 was then transported to Interview Room 24B and Dr Kowal arranged to interview the entity, from behind reinforced glass.\n\n-----\n**Dr. Kowal:** Hello, my name is Dr. Edna Kowal. Can you understand me?\n\n**SCP-7474-1:** YOUR SPEECH IS COMPREHENSIBLE.\n\n//Dr. Kowal flinches, but quickly regains her composure.//\n\n**SCP-7474-1:** YOU APPEAR TO BE IN DISTRESS.\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** No no, I’m ok, I just didn’t expect you to sound so… never mind. I’d like to start by apologising for how you were treated by those soldiers earlier. I can promise you, you’ll not be harmed here, we’re much better prepared to deal with situations like this than those soldiers were. Although I will ask that you not spray anyone again, humans generally find that experience unpleasant.\n\n**SCP-7474-1:** YES, I AM NOW AWARE. I ACCESSED YOUR RADIO SIGNALS FROM MY CRAFT AFTER THE INCIDENT AND LEARNED YOUR METHOD OF SPEECH. YOURS CONSISTS OF VIBRATING THE AIR AT EACH OTHER, RATHER THAN DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER VIA THE EJACULATION OF SPORES. INEFFICIENT.\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** I see. Excuse me for asking the obvious, but can you tell me what exactly you are?\n\n**SCP-7474-1:** NO\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** No?

I SEEK ONLY TO BE ALLOWED TO REPAIR MY VESSEL AND EXIT THIS PLACE.\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** … I’m sorry, I thought the intake officer had made this clear already. We can’t let you go.

I’m just suggesting we take a different tack, there’s other anomalies we could look to for clues on building an interstellar craft of our own. Besides, it’s not like you’re making any progress in understanding SCP-7474, it’s been months and we’re just as clueless as when we started.\n\n**Dr. Warner:** This is nuts. It goes against Foundation principals, we are a scientific organisation, it makes no sense to stop pursuing knowledge. Think of the good we could do if we understood the mechanics of its craft, or even how its biology functions. \n\n**Dr. Kowal:** You’re wrong. The Foundation isn’t a scientific organisation, and those aren’t our principles. Sure, we’re scientists and we try to learn all we can from the anomalies we contain, but our principles above all are to Secure, Contain and Protect. Holding an intelligent and non-anomalous being hostage because we want it to tell us its secrets doesn’t fit those goals. Hell, if a human had invented something we didn’t understand, we wouldn’t hold them prisoner.\n\n**Dr. Warner:** That’s different and you know it. I mean, come on, you can’t tell me that thing doesn’t violate normalcy, just look at it!\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** You might have a point if it wanted to move to the suburbs, but SCP-7474 just wants to go back home, and it’s not violating any sort of normalcy there.\n\n**Dr. Warner:** Yes, go back home and take with it any chance we have of figuring out its technology. When the Foundation found it, it was in the hands of the US military. If it’s not anomalous, then protocol would be to return it to the custody of those who had the SCP object last. Is that what you want, to hand it over to those idiots?\n\n//Dr. Kowal sighs//\n\n**Dr. Kowal:** We’re going in circles here. Otto, just try to talk to SCP-7474. Get to know it and you’ll see its no threat to anyone, and it’s not like you’re making any headway with your experiments anyway. Let it go, and we can focus this department’s efforts somewhere we can actually do some good.\n\n**Dr. Warner:** I’m sorry, but no.
