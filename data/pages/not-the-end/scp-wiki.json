She could hear the sounds of a car door being opened and the voice of an angered man shouting back at her.\n\nShe ran past women standing at storefronts eyeing the dresses on display, fathers carrying their daughters on piggy-back, the homeless stretching their hands out for just enough to get by through the days.\n\nSome she just ran past. Others she ran into. An occasional rustle of plastic bags, another arm touching hers.\n\nSome gave her weird and curious looks, as she hurried past them. Others continued on with their days, showing the figure of a worried woman no attention.\n\nOut of breath, her lungs finally gave in on the hospital’s courtyard. She caught a few of the glances others gave her. She returned those glances with a repelling expression, urging those people to hurriedly carry on.\n\nHer legs were trembling. Her lungs were working overtime, her breaths deep and rapid, while her heart pounded faster and faster, second by second.

She headed straight for the elevators.\n\n//”Third floor, third floor, third...”// she mumbled under her breath.\n\nThe assistant stood up from her desk, looking worriedly at the woman looking frantically around at the end of the hall. ”Miss?” She tried again, again, to no avail.\n\n//Where was the// fucking //button?// There.\n\n”MISS!”\n\nShe hurried into the elevator, the doors sliding shut behind her.

The staff already made their way toward her.\n\n”Miss!

The second a nurse, short, brown hair, shoulder-long, blue eyes. The other two were her daughters.\n\n”What happened?” she gasped, out of breath, more sweat rolling down her face. She stared at her two daughters.\n\nThey only averted their gaze. No words came out of their mouths. The youngest one had trails of tears on her face.\n\nShe turned to look at her oldest daughter, desperately longing for an answer. She, too, only averted her gaze, but with a flimmer of //hatred// reflecting within her eyes. They remained silent amongst the sterile walls of the hospital.\n\n”What happened?” she now asked the short, brown-haired, blue-eyed nurse.\n\nThe staff who previously chased her to the third floor remained completely silent and still.\n\n”I’m sorry, Mrs. Ramani,” the nurse spoke, ”It happened five minutes ago.”\n\nIt took a few seconds for the meaning of those words to finally hit her. The nurse continued talking, but the words all welled up into a dissonant cacophony of distant mumbling and white noise.\n\nShe first stared at the nurse, then at the doctor, then at the hospital staff, and then at her own daughters. First the youngest one, then the oldest.\n\nShe stared at her oldest daughter the longest.\n\nEverything became clear again.

She took a look at the meter, half-expecting what came next: //No fuel.//\n\nHer body was overtaken by fear and panic, but also an instinctual anger and annoyance. //Old habits die hard.//\n\nShe stepped out of her vehicle, opened its trunk, and retrieved a canister of gasoline from it. She had gotten some from the storage areas back at 67 and loaded as many of them up as her car could hold.\n\nIt made running out of fuel an impossibility, but also made her car a moving dry stack of hay on a particular hot summer day for any pyromancer, who decided to blow something up for no particular reason. //As if the world wasn’t already enough of a trash fire.//\n\nAs she stood there and refueled her car, her ears began to pick up a distant crackle of cement and asphalt.\n\nDarting her eyes all around, there was nothing out of the ordinary, //well//, nothing that surprised her.\n\nThe sounds became louder. Like droplets of water seeping into stone, wet //pops// and //snaps//, which became ever so louder, ever so //closer//.\n\nHer body tensed up with fear, with a sensation of finality sprinkled on top of it.\n\nShe poured whatever was left in the canister in haphazardly, before she tossed it on the barren, rippled asphalt street.\n\nHer hand reached for the handle of the door, before a mass of [[[SCP-171|tiny, white tendrils]]], bigger than an apartment building, burst out of the rippled asphalt, between the small stores and shops that were arranged in rows all over the town.\n\nThe mass of writhing, coiling, twisting foam consumed anything in its path. Ramani couldn’t move. She could just stare at this massive heap of foam and humans, writhing and moaning together in unison.\n\nBefore she even knew it, the mass engulfed her car entirely in one swift motion, before the millions of tiny tendrils made their way toward her.\n\nThe foam quickly enveloped her legs, before moving up to her waist, pulling her by the chest, before the tendrils wrapped themselves around her neck and head.\n\nShe tried to scream.

Her body felt like //shit//. There was a piercing, deafening ring within her ears, as her eyes slowly adjusted to her surroundings, like a deep sea fish being fished-up onto the colorful surface of the ocean for the first time.\n\nOnce the ringing subsided, her eyes adjusted, she could make out the rough shapes of houses, stores, or rather the remnants of those houses and stores.\n\nThe ringing in her ears was replaced with loud squishy, wet sounds, and the stench of rotted flesh made its way into her nose.\n\nThen a couch landed a few feet right of her.\n\nIt wasn’t a large couch. Just big enough to seat a parent and her child between, maybe a dog if they squeezed together tightly. The more Ramani stared at the couch, the more the stench built up.\n\nShe stared at the couch more intently, and found large bulges of a writhing //something// underneath, wiggling its way under the surface.\n\nThen the couch started opening its mouths, revealing long, sticky tongues wiggling all around. Pairs of eyes opened up all over it. What seemed like human toes and fingernails began to grow out of its flesh. It was staring right at her.\n\nRamani recoiled in terror, as she felt the urge to throw up, if there was even anything to throw up in her stomach.\n\nThen another piece of furniture landed beside her.

Some of those people were grabbed by fleshy tentacles and moved into giant ulcers on the surface of the tumorous mass. Soon enough, more furniture was ejected from ulcers on its rear, like meteorites impacting the earth below.\n\nRamani could do nothing else, but stay and stare.\n\nHer fight-or-flight instinct finally kicked in, and she found herself on her feet, sprinting in the opposite direction of whatever was stretched out over the horizon.\n\nBut she found herself not fast enough. As the ball of flesh consumed more and more of the foamy creature, more and more furniture were shot out in all directions, leaving the impact sites craters of blood, viscera and other human body parts.\n\nOne of them took the form of a pick-up truck, tongues spilling out, giving out the most twisted of moans, and impacted what was left of the right side of an apartment building.\n\nThe entire structure collapsed, as Ramani could do nothing, but watch.

There were a bunch of people dressed in lab coats of various ethnicities, heights, genders and age. Some were delighting themselves at the buffet table, while others were already sitting at their respective places.\n\nRamani, not particularly feeling hungry, picked a seat somewhere farther back. When a chime played through the PA system, and everyone got to their seats and stood up, she realized that a seat so far back was a rather stupid idea.\n\nShe could barely make out the podium, much less whoever was about to stand behind it. She should’ve worn her high heels.\n\nA figure stepped up to the podium. The man was tall, slender, wearing a pristine lab coat, somewhat balding. He quickly disappeared behind the crowd.\n\nThe man spoke: ”Humanity, in its present state, has been around for over a hundred thousand years, yet only a fraction of it has been of any significance. So I ask you, what did we do the last 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we did not understand...” The man spoke these words in a calm, monotonous, seemingly bored voice, the very sound of which nearly brought her fast asleep.\n\nShe caught herself slowly trailing off, fixating upon other things in the room. There were a dozen more men and women all lined up in a neat little row, reaching all the way to backstage. There were guards and security staff armed with tasers, ever-so-vigilant for any dangers that might arise, there was an empty seat next to her, and--\n\n”Excuse me, could I get through?” a man asked.\n\n”Oh,” she began, ”of course.”\n\n”Thanks,” he replied.\n\nHe squeezed his way past her. The man took residency on the empty seat next to her. He tried to get a better view of the man at the podium, still giving his speech, past the crowd.\n\n”That’s Doctor Charles Octen Gears,” the man said. ”His colleagues call him Cog.”\n\nRamani nodded, still not getting a good view of the man at the podium.\n\n”Hi, I’m Adam. Krug,” he suddenly said. He held out his hand.\n\n”Ramone Ramani. Pleasure to meet you.” They shook hands.\n\n”Pleasure to meet //you//, Ramani.”\n\n”You new here?” she asked.\n\n”Oh, yes,” he answered. ”You?”\n\n”Like you, a rookie. You seem to know a lot about this organization already,” Ramani jokingly remarked.\n\n”Well, he was our, well, my guide. Of our group. Who was yours?”\n\n”A lady called Agatha Rights.

I even got to talk to it for a little.” Adam smiled.\n\n”That sounds exciting.” Ramani smiled back.\n\n”Is there anything you’d like to discuss with us?” This Dr. Gears fellow was looking directly at them.\n\nRamani felt her blood run cold. Suddenly, dozens of people turned behind them to stare at her. She could feel the gazes of each and every individual in the room, pointed straight at her.\n\n”We’re sorry, Mister-- I mean, //Doctor// Gears,” Adam stepped in.\n\nDr. Gears then turned back to his speech again. ”In time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear...” The man continued on. Everyone’s gaze was turned to the man at the podium again.\n\n”Sorry about that,” Adam apologized, now more quietly.\n\n”No worries,” Ramani said, equally as quiet. Her heart began to ease up a little.\n\nThey were listening to the speech now. //Actually// listening to the speech now. ”The Foundation is a secret organization that aims to secure, contain, and...”\n\n**”Protect.”** Adam finished the sentence.

She fell to the ground again, onto a muddy puddle. Pain radiated from her left leg.\n\nShe remained like this for a few more minutes. Her sobs were drowned out by the chaos going on on the surface. There was an unnatural sound echoing throughout.\n\nThere was a notable //whirring// within the dark confines of the rubble, suddenly.\n\n”Who goes there?”\n\n//No response. Of course not.//\n\nShe quickly leaned against the far side of the small chamber, as her eyes darted across everywhere. It was pitch black, so she really couldn’t see anything.\n\nUntil there was a spark.\n\nIt was quiet unnoticeable, but in the utter darkness she now found herself in, a small spark was as bright as the sun. Soon, more sparks started flying, with the whirring sound becoming louder and louder by the second.\n\nShe had enough of it. In a panic, Ramani let her hands go over every surface around her. She grabbed a small rock, //sharp to the touch//, and held it over her head. As best as she could, she aimed the rock at the sparkling figure, ready to--\n\n”Woah, woah, woah, //woah!//” a voice echoed. It sounded young and exhausted, //fearful//.\n\n”Calm down, lady! Relax! Just... just put the rock down, all right?”\n\nThe panic in her eyes was quickly replaced by a new feeling: //Confusion//. She put the rock down, but still held it in her left hand, just in case. ”What-- //who// the fuck are you?”\n\n”Okay, okay, lady, just let me... let me--”\n\nAll of a sudden, sparks went flying everywhere, the whirring peaked at an unbearable decibell level, until everything just suddenly ceased.\n\nSoon later, a suit appeared in front of her, //no//, had always been there and was now visible to her, illuminated by the sensors around the facial area and a light attached to one of the arms, glowing weakly.\n\nThe face plate of the suit flipped open, revealing a young, worn man underneath.

He winced and coiled in pain for a moment.\n\n”Ow...”\n\n”//Jesus.//”\n\n”What...?” he asked, out of breath.\n\n”It’s... your face, it's just...” She dared not speak any further.

There was already too much she-- ”What is that?”\n\n”What is what?”\n\n”The suit//case//!”\n\nShe pointed at a small suitcase on the right of the young man.\n\n”Oh, that is... that is, um...

Horror overcame her, when she realized she couldn’t help him, that they were buried under how many tons of concrete, and her only companion through all of this was about to die.\n\nShe did the only thing she could think of doing. She steadied herself, feeling the rubble shift under her weight, dust settle from the ceiling, and made her way toward Pietro. She suppressed a groan, clenching her teeth as tight as she could manage, as the pain from her leg radiated even stronger now.\n\nThe pain was crippling, but she continued on.\n\nShe steadied herself on the wall and shook Pietro by the shoulders. His words were barely a whisper.\n\n”I can’t, I can’t, I-- I can’t...”\n\n”Listen-- LISTEN TO ME! Look at me! Pietro! Look at me!”\n\nShe shook him as hard as she could. She read somewhere that that was //not// the best way of going about treating a person suffering from a panic attack -- //if it even was one// -- but she couldn’t think of anything better to do.\n\n”Stop thinking about all of this, and think about, I don’t know... happy thoughts!”\n\nIn the dim light, Ramani saw Pietro’s eyes lighten up.\n\n”Happy thoughts...” he whispered to no one in particular.\n\n”Yes! Happy thoughts! Any happy thoughts.”\n\nPietro’s voice began to grow calmer, less rapid. The life in his eyes returned, as Ramani could feel her soul ease up.\n\n”Damian...” Pietro said, ”my first cat... only cat...” His breathing calmed down. ”Getting my first job... joining the Foundation... discovering I could do something in the world...”\n\nPietro eased up more and more.\n\nAs the seconds passed, Ramani could see the life return within Pietro’s eyes, as his breathing slowed and his mumbling stopped.\n\nHe placed his hand, cold to the touch, on Ramani’s hand, reassuringly.\n\n”Thanks,” he said.\n\nPietro smiled. Ramani returned the smile. Then she collapsed onto the ground, wincing slightly as her shatterd leg hit the pavement.\n\n”Shit... Your leg,” Pietro exclaimed.\n\n”No, no, it’s... it’s nothing really.” She held onto her leg dearly.\n\n”Hold on. Let me... I think I might have something that can deal with your leg...”\n\nPietro leaned in and pulled out a small object out of a compartment inside the suit. The little light there was reflected on the surface of the [[[SCP-427|locket]]], intricate patterns carefully etched onto its surface, shimmering in the darkness.\n\n”I recovered it from one of the destroyed Foundation facilities. All I know is that it can heal you... and is dangerous. Probably shouldn’t keep onto it for too long.”\n\nHe handed her the locket, so light in her grasp, opened it, revealing an almost blinding orb of light contained within. She held it against her injured leg, feeling the warmth radiating throughout her body. ”Thanks,” Ramani said, already feeling alleviated of her pain.\n\n”No worries,” Pietro replied.\n\nThey remained like this for a while.\n\n”So...” Pietro suddenly spoke. It was nice hearing him talk normally again. ”Do you have any happy thoughts to tell?” He looked over at Ramani.\n\nRamani gave off a light chuckle. ”What?” Pietro asked.\n\n”Oh, it’s...

Her mind was rushed with dozens of thoughts, her indecision piqued by the long silence. Eventually, though, she gave in.\n\n”I...” The words were, again, stuck in her throat. She took a moment to contemplate, before being sure of her choice of words. ”My... //mother//... she spent too much time on her job.

But we would eavesdrop. Listen to every word they’d say.”\n\nThere was a long sigh, as Ramani looked onto the ceiling. Pietro kept quiet the entire time. ”Then, my father got cancer. It... it didn’t help that my mother wasn’t there for... us.”\n\nRamani suddenly stopped. Tears rolled down her face, as she tried to not let Pietro notice. He definitely noticed.\n\n”If it makes you feel better, I also had a shitty mother.”\n\nRamani winced at those words. She looked over at Pietro, but he didn’t seem to notice. She listened to him intently.\n\n”You know, I also had a pretty shitty father... Never was there anything he couldn’t solve with the belt. Kicked my cat to death when I was little. Was into detective stories and-- anyway, besides the point. I hated my father, I hated him so //much//...\n\n”But even with everything that he did to me... and my brother...

It’s like... like she gave up on us.”\n\nThere was a pause. A long pause.\n\n”Pietro, don’t //ever// think like that,” was her only response.\n\n”Yeah... maybe you’re right. I mean, what does dwelling on the past do for you?” He said that last part mainly to himself; yet, somehow, those were the words that stuck with her the most.\n\n//...//\n\n//...//\n\n//...//\n\n”How’s your leg?”\n\nShe moved her leg around. There was no pain anymore. ”Better.”\n\n”That’s good.”\n\nRamani clapped the locket shut, plunging the chamber into pitch blackness again.\n\nPietro rested up against a wall, clapping some dust off his suit and face. There was a distinct //clanking// sound as he did so. ”So that’s how it is, oh?” He stared up at the ceiling.\n\n”Yep.”\n\n”I’m just gonna rest a little. Suit’s gonna run out of battery pretty soon, I think, or at least it feels like it. It’s pretty tattered up and feels really heavy...”\n\nSomething sparked up within Ramani’s eyes. It was a small spark, //a glimmer of hope//, yet it was enough to spring Researcher Ramani back into action.\n\n”How do you move your suit?”\n\nPietro looked quite perplexed at Ramani. ”I--”\n\n”How do you move it?”\n\nStill, quite confused. ”Why--”\n\n”A suit like that’s gonna weigh a few pounds; no way for a normal human body to maneuver it like that.”\n\nDespite Pietro’s persistent confusion, Ramani’s mind was blitzing thoughts, //zip-zap//, all over. Like a snowball rolling down a snowy tundra.\n\n”Ramani, I’m not really sure what’re--”\n\n”The suit must be directly connected to your brain! Of course!” Ramani exclaimed. ”Lift up your arm.”\n\nHesitant, Pietro lifted up his arm. It was touching the ceiling.\n\n”How did it //feel//?”\n\n”It... it...” Pietro’s mind was now rumbling like Ramani’s.\n\n”Like the suit moved according to where your mind //commanded// it to move? Instead of //you// moving your arm and the mechanics of the suit following with you?”\n\n”Now that you mention it... it does feel kinda weird.”\n\n”Try recording a log,” Ramani ordered.\n\nPietro’s expression, just grasping something, fell back into the ever-persistent confusion again. ”Wait, you can record on this thi--”\n\n> [[=]]\n> **JOURNAL ENTRY 0001-1**\n> [[/=]]\n\n”Woah...”\n\n”Try //thinking// something into the log.”\n\n> //My name is Pietro Wilson. I don't know what's happening.//\n> \n> //Thought transcription is tricky. Sorry, I’m not used to this yet, uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...//\n\nHe immediately shut it off. He looked back at Ramani with a look of wonder and amazement. He knew //exactly// what she was thinking.\n\n”Do you think it’ll work?”\n\n”It //must//.”\n\n”All right...”\n\nWithout hesitation, Pietro stood up, //as best as one could within this even tinier space now//, and looked back at Ramani.\n\n”Are you absolutely //sure// it’ll work? Because I’ve heard being crushed to death is one of the most brutal ways to go--”\n\n”Do it!” she urged him. There was no other way.\n\n”All right...” he mutterd to himself. ”Let’s do this thing.”\n\nThe face plate of the suit shut tight around his head. Fully enveloped in the absolute exclusion harness, he pressed his hands against the concrete and began to push upwards.\n\nFrom the noises and locomotion, it must’ve been several dozen tons of rubble that laid on top of them that somehow hadn’t crushed them into mush already.\n\nIt should have been difficult. It should have been the most physically taxing thing Pietro had ever, //would’ve ever//, done, yet it didn’t feel much too different from lifting weights on a bench-press in the gym (Pietro had never entered a gym in his entire life).\n\nHe simply //thought// what the suit //should// do, and the internal mechanism and resistant materials withstood the rest. Like the suit was an airplane and he was the pilot (or something like that).\n\nRamani covered her eyes and ears, as she huddled in the corner, hoping that nothing would decide to fall onto her. Besides a few particles of dust, there was nothing too major.\n\nSoon, Ramani could see the first rays of light through her squinted eyes, as Pietro heaved tons of rubble away; she could hear him audibly straining.\n\nAnd then there was nothing, but the fresh, cold air. When they climbed out of the pit, she could catch herself coughing and breathing heavily, taking as much air in as possible.\n\nWhen the face plate of Pietro’s suit retracted, he, too, took as much of the surrounding air in as he possibly could. Both remained like this for quite a while.\n\nPietro helped Ramani stand up.\n\nThen they took a sweeping view over the deseccrated landscape. What little remained of the town before was gone, reduced to nothing, but dust and rubble. The giants once at the horizon were long gone, yet the traces of their battle were strewn out all around them. Then there was the sky, tinted in a deep red, shattered into millions of fragments. And then there were the gods raging farther on the horizon.\n\nPietro picked up his briefcase from the rubble.\n\n”Where’re you headed?”\n\n”[[[SCP-579|Site-62C]]]. That’s what this Mister Something Krug guy told me,” Pietro answered, staring at the remains of a kindergarten in front of him.\n\n”I guess this is where we part ways.”\n\nPietro turned to look at Ramani and reached out his hand. She looked at Pietro, the suit he was wearing, the briefcase, then at his hand.\n\nThen echoes of the past started to come up again.\n\nShe said the next words with a conscious, sane and sound mind.\n\n”I’m going with you.”\n\nShe couldn’t even fully believe her words herself.\n\nPietro had an expression of concern on his face, which quickly abated into a smile. ”All right.”\n\nRamani looked down at her arm again. She rubbed the previous message she had written in blue marker away...\n\n> ##blue|//Objective: Get to Green Lawn Cemetery//##\n\n@@ @@\n\n... and replaced it with a new one. At least in her mind:\n\n> ##blue|//Objective: __**Save the world.**__//##\n\n@@ @@\n\nRamani took a few steps forward. She looked back at Pietro, who had an absent expression lingering on his face.\n\nPietro looked down at the [[[SCP-055|suitcase]]], quite confused.\n\n”Wait... what was it that we were gonna do again?”\n\n------\n[[<]]\n**« [[[Or maybe it is...|Previous]]]**\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n**» [[[Just Fragments Hub|HUB]]] «**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n**[[[Five-Seven-Nine|Next]]] »**\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
